# Attack Outline

Standard of Review

Burden of Proof

Procedural Posture

**For the exam:**

- Frame answer in terms of procedure

- Also be aware of what role you are in and what kind of document you are producing.

- Fondle the facts! Which facts are most important. Use facts to distinguish from cases.

- Issue, Standard, Application, Conclusion

- Emphasize the issues that are most pivotal.

- No testing on the states. Time management. Doctrine v. policy.

- Secondary readings -- not tested directly, but you can usefully draw on them.

- Takeaways and memorize table of contents

# Nature and Function of Tort Law

A tort is a legally cognizable wrong that is not part of another discrete field of law. There are **accidental** and **intentional** torts which each merits a different standard of care. To make out a tort, you must show **duty**, **breach of duty**, **causation** and **damages**.

- Four important features of tort law include:

  - Jury trials

  - Liability Insurance

  - Contingent Fee System

  - American Rule for Costs

## Hammontree v. Jenner

This is the case of epileptic seizure and subsequent crash into bicycle shop. No negligence.

- Distinction between Strict Liability and Negligence

  - Case where it isn't clear that anyone did anything wrong or that there should be a clear-cut decision one way or the other 🡪 Shift from Strict Liability to Negligence

- Considerations: Backward-Looking vs. Forward-Looking

  - Someone has to pay bills 🡪 backward-looking

  - Forward-looking

    - How will people behave differently

    - Effect on litigation behavior

    - Business costs

    - [Strong]{.underline} message of responsibility

## Goals of Tort Law

- **Corrective justice** -- rights based understanding of the functions of tort law. Correction of the wrong to restore moral balance between parties.

- **Civil Recourse** -- recourse for civil wrongs, not necessarily corrective.

- **Optimal Deterrence** -- some losses are not worth avoiding (those not caused by negligence) and some are worth avoiding (those caused by negligence)

- **Loss Distribution** -- promoting the broad distribution of loss so the plaintiff does not have to bear the burden.

- **Compensation** -- of those who have suffered injury. Since qualifications to recover are not the extent of suffering, this is more of a benefit than goal of tort law.

- **Redress of social grievances** -- against impersonal institutions.

- **Mixed System** -- Perhaps it depends on the case and both rights-based and instrumental goals can be met.

# Procedure in Tort Suit; Where Tort Law Comes From

- Pleadings -- Complaint states a cause of action and an answer states affirmative defenses.

- Discovery

- Pre-Trial Motions -

  - **Motion to Dismiss** (before discovery) --D claims that even if all P's allegations are true, P does not have a legally cognizable claim.

  - **Motion for Summary Judgment** (after discovery) -- P or D asserts 1) no genuine issue of material fact, 2) motioning party is entitled to judgment based on those facts.

- Trial -- Jury decides issues of fact, judge decides issues of law (except bench trials)

  - **Jury** finds issues of pure fact and mixed questions of fact and law (applying law to facts already found). P bears the **burden of proof** which consists of a **production** (evidence) burden and a **persuasion** (preponderance, more probable than not) burden. If evidence is **equipoise**, burden has not been met.

  - **Judge** rules on admissibility of evidence (nothing irrelevant is admissible). Judges decide whether there is enough evidence to make out a jury question (whether reasonable people could disagree) or whether DV, JML or JNOV should be granted. Also rules on motion and jury instructions.

  - **General Verdicts** are most common and only find for one party and determine damages. **Special Verdicts** answer specific questions. We don't always use special verdicts because tort law is supposed to be less ridged. Juries can also **nullify** the law with their verdicts.

  - **Appeals** are based on trial judge legal error which can only be based on an evidentiary ruling, motion ruling, or jury instruction. Appellate courts can only make findings of law, cannot re-review the facts, and can affirm, reverse or reverse and remand.

# The Negligence Standard

Negligence is defined as the **failure to exercise reasonable** care to avoid injury or damage to another person or property. There is a general duty not to be negligent.

## History of Negligence

- **Trespass** (trespass by force of arms) v. **Case** (trespass by breaching boundary), direct harm (defendant usually liable) v. indirect or consequential harm (defendant only liable through negligence)

- Historically -- you had to choose the correct writ (trespass or case), not just have a cause of action. Writs represented selective justice/jurisdiction of the King. They were a combined substance and procedural tool.

- **Brown v. Kendall** (dogfight) --

  - Plaintiff contended that his claim was brought in trespass, so there should be strict liability, i.e. defendant has to prove he exercised extraordinary care (was utterly without fault); Judge Shaw rejected this theory and said that neither trespass nor case would lie unless defendant had intended to injure plaintiff or had negligently injured him.

  - Plaintiff has the burden of proof. Standard to judge defendant is always ordinary or reasonable care. If he acted in reasonable care, he is not liable.

- Brown was a change in the law away from strict liability. This is the general case by late 19^th^ century.

+===========+==================+===================+===================+

- **Adams v. Bullock**

  - Cardozo opinion

  - The minor was burned when he swung a long wire over the edge of a bridge striking the wires of a trolley that ran below the bridge and above the train tracks. No one could reach the wires by bending over the bridge or the parapet. The court concluded that only an extraordinary casualty could make the wires dangerous. The court reversed the judgment and held that the railroad did not have the power or duty to avert the possibility of the accident because there was no special danger at the bridge that warned the railroad of the necessity of special precaution, and the wires could not be insulated.

  - Arguments brought to bear:

    - Only "reasonable" care 🡪 saves costly (further) care

    - Nothing like this before/freak accident

    - Foreseeable?

    - Custom (people in general) 🡪 standards of practice, regulations

    - Burden of proof

## The Reasonable Person Standard

- Question is not what average people do, but rather what they OUGHT to do.

- The reasonable person never fails to behave reasonably.

- **Objective Standard** -- not subjective. That the defendant did his best or acted in good faith is not enough. Shortcomings not relevant. There is a difference between moral and legal fault.

  - Subjective standard too variable and hard to find

  - Subjective standard encourages fraud

  - Objective standard encourages D to exercise more care and treats everyone equally

  - Objective standard gives public assurance of predictable care level or liability

  - Jurors need not engage in psychology or mind reading

- Arguments in Favor

  - Cost and ease of adjudication and feasibility of fact-finding

    - Clear jury instructions result from this

      - Simple: How would a reasonable person behave?

    - Fair, uniform results

  - Incentives and Deterrence

    - Principle: By setting a standard of care (what a reasonable person would/should do), you incentivize a certain degree of care and skill; also, if a future defendant/tortfeasor knows he/she cannot exercise that minimum threshold of care, he/she will limit his/her activity levels accordingly

  - Fairness

    - Treat everyone equally; everyone benefits

- **Bethel v. New York**

  - Re-instates reasonable person standard for adjudicating public transport/negligence cases

  - Policy Question: How much tailoring of rules do we want? How much do we want to impose as universal?

- **Daniels v. Clegg** and **Little Rock v. Tankersly**

  - Daniels v. Clegg -- head-on carriage collision; woman driver

  - Little Rock v. Tankersly -- woman injured while jumping off of moving train

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Clegg                                               Tankersly
  --------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------
  Takes age + sex into account in Plaintiff's favor   Takes age and sex into account against plaintiff

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Exceptions to the Objective Standard

- **Children -- semi-objective standard**

  - Children under 5 cannot be negligence because they cannot be expected to exercise care

  - Other children are expected to exercise the degree of care that would be reasonable in a child of similar age, intelligence and experience

  - EXCEPT, when children engage in dangerous adult activities they are held to an adult standard of care

- **Infirm Adults -- semi-objective standard**

  - Typically physical infirmities are taken into account in judging the reasonableness of behavior, but mental infirmities are not.

  - Under common law usually insane people are responsible for their torts.

  - Difference comes from the idea that physical infirmities are visible, measureable and verifiable.

  - With physical infirmities, jury can be permitted to take into account whether the infirmities should have led to different or additional precautions. Evidence of what people with similar infirmities do can be taken.

### The Foreseeability Requirement

- Not negligent unless he knew or reasonably should have known that his actions posed a risk of harm. Even then, not negligence unless a reasonable person under the circumstance would have taken more precautions.

- Thus, person cannot be negligent for failing to take precautions against an unforeseeable risk of harm.

### The Negligence "Calculus"

- Learned Hand Formulation: BPL from US v. Carroll Towing Co.

  - The **probability** that the harm will happen (P)

  - **Gravity** of the resulting harm (L)

  - **Burden** of adequate precautions (B)

  - Is B greater or less than P times L?

  - It is unreasonable not to take the precautions if they cost less than probability and magnitude of harm. If costs of precautions are higher, it is reasonable to take the risk.

  - BPL not usually used in jury instruction but instead by the court when deciding between jury questions and directed verdict.

- **US v. Carroll Towing** -- Admiralty law, no jury. Negligence doesn't matter unless it is causal negligence. Did bargee's absence cause harm?

- **Eckert v. Long Island RR** (baby on tracks) -- Court found that "the law has so high a regard for human life that it will not impute negligence on an effort to preserve it, unless made under such circumstance as to constitute rashness in the judgment of prudent persons." This is true of rescuing people, not property. **Danger invites rescue**. (Also fits into Act/Omission policy section)

- **Andrews v. United Airlines** -- Falling bags from overhead bins. P claims injury was foreseeable. Common carrier has a heightened duty because P has little control. United took precaution of warning but nothing else. United says further precaution is too costly. Trial court grants Sum. Jug. for D and 9^th^ Cir. remands saying this is appropriate jury question.

- **Which Arguments Don't Fit into B\<PxL?**

  - Future Harm

  - Foreseeability (beyond probability)

  - Custom

  - Morality

  - Quantification? -- Is that something we want?

- **Criticisms of the Calculus:**

  - Incommensurability = can't compare an eye lost to costs of precaution

  - Sometimes, the cost of preventing an accident is not worth the added burden of prevention (CB, page 45)

  - Doesn't address momentary lapses that amount to negligence (carelessness)

  - Omits whether a party engaged in impartial deliberation about a possible course of action. Perhaps they just made the wrong decision about the calculus.

  - Crass towards real human suffering, boils down to equating suffering with money (awarding damages already does this)

  - Tries to create a uniform unit of comparison. Also, probabilities are often not available for these things.

  - Is it an economic or moral theory of negligence?

    - Posner says economic theory

    - Can also be seen as a moral theory which values self interest equally with the interests of others effected by behavior.

- In many cases the Plaintiff tries to prove the untaken precaution.

### Custom

- Evidence of non-compliance with custom may be use offensively (as a sword) to show negligence, and evidence of compliance with custom may be use defensively (as a shield) to show reasonable care. This evidence is not dispositive.

- Custom used to be a complete defense. Now, except for med. malpractice, custom is admissible but not determinative.

- What is a custom -- Does not need to be universal but must be sufficiently widespread.

- Establishment of a custom gives rise to jury instructions permitting consideration of the compliance or non-compliance. Even if practice is not a full custom, evidence of compliance/non-compliance with a practice in which some engage may also be admitted and considered by jury.

- **TJ Hooper** -- (tugs with radios) Court found that it was not a full custom to have radios but that defendant was still negligent because "there are precautions so imperative that even their universal disregard will not excuse their omission." A whole industry can be lagging. Court ruled this was negligence as a matter of law but this would typically be a jury question.

- Benefits of custom evidence:

  - Direct normative force -- custom may be probative of what constitutes reasonable care. Jury *permitted* to take reasonable care "ought" from customary "is."

  - Evidence of custom cautions the jury (they might find a whole industry negligent)

  - Evidence of compliance with custom is evidence of a lack of opportunity to learn of other precautions

  - Shows what level of self-protection plaintiff should have taken if they know the custom

  - It is rare for an entire industry to implement more care than is necessary. Therefore departure from custom is more probative than compliance, even though a whole industry can be negligent.

## Violation of Statutes

- Abraham Book notes

  - Some statutes create civil liability either expressly or by intent although many are silent on this issue.

  - Standard approach -- unexcused violation of a statute designed to promote safety is negligence "per se" (negligence as a matter of law). A few states say it is not per se negligence but that evidence of statute violate is admissible.

  - Reasonable care may require more than mere compliance with a statutory requirement.

  - Two kinds of cases:

    - P claims statute sets a standard of care. Source of duty and recovery come from the statute. (either explicit cause of action or implied)

    - Statute is for regulatory purpose but the standard it sets is useful in defining common law negligence. Cause of action already exists in the common law.

- **Martin v. Herzog** -- P didn't have headlight on as required by law. Cardozo says statute must be followed; this is contributory negligence per se and enters verdict for D. Did the statutory violations contribute to the accident? Jury question suggesting remand would have been more appropriate.

  - Cardozo: follows rule/statute/precondition and does not submit issues to jury; bends statutes to fit facts

- Negligence per se in the common law -- reasonable people do not violate statutes. But when a statute is codifying the common law, common law exceptions still apply (**Tedla v. Ellman**).

  - **Tedla v. Ellman** (CB, page 79)

    - "We cannot assume reasonably that the Legislature intended that a statute enacted for the preservation of the life and limb of pedestrians must be observed when observance would subject them to more imminent danger." (79)

    - Plaintiff was struck from behind by traffic while walking with back to traffic, even though statute said you had to walk facing traffic. Plaintiff contended that, due to heavy traffic on opposite side, it would have been more dangerous/risky to walk facing traffic.

- Violation of ordinance is NOT negligence per se. Criminal statute does not create per se liability.

- Legally Cognizable Excuses --

  - **Necessity - Tedla v. Ellman**

  - **Incapacity** -- Children. Reasonable efforts to comply. No knowledge.

  - **Emergency** - noncompliance is safer (**Tedla v. Ellman**, walking on the wrong side of the street)

- Defense of Limited Statutory Purpose

  - Permits the defendant to show that the plaintiff was not in the class of persons, or did not suffer the type of harm, intended to be protected by the statute that the defendant violated.

  - **DiCaprio v. NY Central RR** -- Fences to keep livestock off the railroad track. Kid was killed but no recovery because protection against this risk was not object of statute.

  - Defense rarely prevails as statutes usually do not have their purpose on their face. Room for courts to find a "secondary purpose"

  - Examples: Dram shop laws -- Some states will extend liability of servers of alcohol to third parties who were injured by drunk drivers. Key in Ignition -- if your car is stolen and then injures someone when you initially left your key in, you can be liable for statutory violation.

  - Two methods of determining liability:

    - Legislative history that mentions anything close to injury/protection suffered by plaintiff

    - If not, then did the statutory violation increase the risk to plaintiff?

## Negligence as a Matter of Law: Judges and Jury

- Juries -- Issues are submitted to jury if reasonable people could disagree about the resolution of that issue.

- Court -- issues are decided by the court as a matter of law if reasonable people could not disagree

- The above applies to both pure questions of fact and mixed questions of fact and law (whether a party was negligent)

- Holmes -- **Baltimore and Ohio RR v. Goodman** (CB, p. 63) -- Truck crossing RR. SCOTUS overturned ruling for P saying that there was no evidence to relieve P of responsibility for his own death. Someone in this situation should stop and get out of his vehicle.

  - Rule: Get out of the car, look, then cross

  - Holmes worried that a general standard would lead to inconsistency in jury application (Note 2, p. 61)

- Cardozo -- **Pakora v. Wabash RR** -- SCOTUS overturned ruling for D (based on Goodman), saying that each case depends on the facts. Goodman may have been negligent, but that doesn't mean everyone in the same situation is.

  - Standard: reasonable to expect you'd hear a train coming; lower standard of care

  - Tries pulling Holmes's rule back into general standard of conduct

  - Criticizes Holmes: judges don't know everything and can't make a rule, since situations vary too much (CB, p. 63)

- Holmes v. Cardozo (Goodman/Pakera): Holmes says common law draws on experience but that doesn't mean it should be unsettled. He thinks that for some subset of cases can't we create standards because they happen over and over. Cardozo says RR crossing accident has so many variables that you need a jury.

  - Who decides?

    - Rules: made by legislatures (statutes), agencies (regulations), and judges (precedent)

    - Standards: made by judges/juries based on a specific case

- Generally there has not been a tendency for rules of law to develop regarding what is and is not negligent behavior. This is usually a decision for the jury.

- Rules v. Standards

- **Andrews v. United Airlines** -- perhaps appropriate for a rule-based decision since this accident occurs in basically the same way over and over. But courts have allowed this type of development through procedural moves, like class action and collateral estoppel.

# Proof of Negligence

Plaintiff introduces evidence of Ds behavior and contents that they failed to take a precaution that would have been reasonable to take. Use of **direct evidence** (physical, demonstrative, eyewitness), **circumstantial** or **res ipsa** evidence.

## Burden of Proof

- Burdens in the Ordinary Case

  - Plaintiff in a torts suit bears the burden of proof on each element of the case, including the burden of production and the burden of persuasion.

  - Satisfying the burden of **production** is sometimes referred to as making out a **prima facie** case. This is an evidence burden where P can support an inference of breach of standard by the jury. (Negligence **per se** is the same as prima facie. Some courts say that per se means the case is closed while prima facie means defendant could still give some defense)

  - Satisfaction of burden of **production** is determined by the court in a ruling on legal sufficiency of the evidence on all elements. If reasonable people could disagree on all elements, then D directed verdict motion is denied. Jury then determines the "weight" of the evidence.

    - Inference of negligence must be permissible based on evidence.

  - Burden of **persuasion** -- met only if jury is persuaded by a preponderance of the evidence (more probably than not) that the D breached the applicable standard of care, injury resulted and D's breach caused the injury. If evidence shows that it is just as probable as not (in **equipoise**), then burden is not satisfied.

- Product of the probabilities problem -- 1) mathematically complex, 2) jury unanimity, 3) defendant incentives, 4) comparative persuasion.

- **Proving negligence** -- 1) what defendant did, 2) what they did or did not do constituted lack of reasonable care, 3) (optional but recommended) what would have constituted reasonable care?

- Circumstantial Evidence of Negligence --

  - Sometimes proof of the circumstances is sufficient to prove negligence, but sometimes it is not.

  - Some cases draw on court and jury's past experience. Some are sufficiently technical to need experts to create a common understanding of past experiences regarding the issues in the case.

## Res Ipsa Loquitur

- Circumstantial evidence that the defendant was negligent in some way, without supporting an inference of the particular way in which the defendant was negligent. Res Ipsa means that because Ds who do this are ordinarily negligent, there is sufficient circumstantial evidence to allow this to go to the jury. Generally shifts burden of proof to D.

- Event causing the Plaintiff's injury must be one that: (parts 2 and 3 are part of the traditional approach)

  - Ordinarily occurs because of negligence by someone in the defendant's position

  - Instrumentality causing injury must be in the exclusive control of the defendant

  - The injury must not be due to any voluntary action or contribution by the plaintiff

- **Modern view**: requiring that causes other than the defendant's negligence (the defendant's non-negligent conduct, the negligent conduct of someone else, and the non-negligent conduct of someone else or some thing) be sufficiently eliminated by evidence.

- Applications: when requirements are met, the effect is that the jury is permitted, though not required, to find that the defendant was negligent. Because of discovery rules, now, this is only useful if D lies in deposition but is willing to tell the truth at trial.

- **Byrne v. Boadle** -- Barrel of flour that fell from a warehouse. Mere fact that the accident occurred is evidence of negligence and satisfies P's burden of production. Court essentially shifts burden of proof to defendant since plaintiff has no access to proof and D has a duty to care for barrels. D provides no affirmative evidence against negligence so court upholds CofA finding for P.

- Smoking Out the Evidence from the Defendant: Essentially res ipsa shifts the burden of proof to the defendant to submit something to prove that they were not negligent.

- **The Ybarra Problem** -- Case of shoulder pain after surgery. Res Ipsa may still serve to smoke out evidence regarding multiple defendants. Res Ipsa caused burden of proof to shift to doctors and nurses who had unique ability to identify the negligence when patient, who was unconscious, cannot. "Hold that where a P receives unusual injuries while unconscious and in the course of medical treatment, all those Ds who had any control over the body or instrumentalities . . . may be properly be called upon to meet the inference of negligence by giving an explanation of their conduct." Finding of nonsuit reversed. *Only used in conspiracy of silence cases.*

# Cause-In-Fact

In the absence of tortious conduct, no injury. 1) what caused the harm, 2) who caused the harm, 3) whether negligence caused the harm, and 4) what part of the harm was caused by what or whom.

## Types of Causation

- **Causal link** -- what happens as a matter of probability for these cases? Perhaps other possible reason for event.

- **But for cause** (cause in fact) -- in this case, what exactly happened

- **Proximate cause** -- see below.

## The "But For" Test 

- (**sine qua non**) -- but for the defendant's negligence (or breach of applicable standard of care) the plaintiff would have suffered injury or damage.

- Cause-in-fact also requires negligence (i.e. parents having a child, who commits a tort, are not liable even though that is a but-for cause).

  - Defendant is not liable unless negligence was also **proximate cause**.

- **[Test]{.underline}**: Causation question is **counter-factual** -- does not require a finding of what actually happened, but of what would have happened if the defendant had not been negligent. Jury must rely on experience and knowledge of the world to determine this.

  - Question of Proof: Can you preclude other possible causes?

- In cause in fact disputes court must decide whether an inference about what would have happened in this situation if the defendant had not been negligent is permissible, because of what ordinarily happens in situations like this when there is no negligence.

- **But for test** -- requires a finding that, more probable than not, the defendant's negligence was a prerequisite to what happened

- **[Substantial factor test]{.underline}** -- requires a finding that the defendant's negligence was influential in some way. (too vague except in cases of multiple causes).

- Self-proving Causation: Fall-Downs, Dart-Outs, and Zuchowitz

  - Some cases allow that plaintiff has introduced sufficient evidence of causation if the negligence of the defendant **substantially increased** the chance that the plaintiff would be injured. (self-proving)

  - **Reynolds v. Texas & Pacific** -- Plaintiff was overweight and warned to hurry to catch a train. She fell down unlighted steps and was injured. Plaintiff claimed unlit stairs was negligence while defendant said she may have fallen in daylight too. Court held that if the plaintiff proves that the negligence of the defendant "**greatly multiplied**" the chance of accident, then P made out a jury question on causation.

  - Jury is permitted to find, in the absence of other probable cause, that defendant's negligence is probable cause. Sometimes it is effective to eliminate other possibilities to prove that defendant's acts were probable cause.

  - **Stubbs v. City of Rochester** -- Plaintiff resident brought suit against defendant city to recover damages alleged to have been sustained due to drinking contaminated water from the city\'s domestic service. The resident argued that he produced sufficient evidence from which inference might reasonably have been drawn that the causes of the resident\'s illness was due to the use of contaminated water furnished by the city. The court examined the evidence presented at trial and determined that the evidence presented justified a submission of the facts to the jury. Accordingly, the court determined that the trial court erred in directing a verdict against the resident.

  - **Zuchowicz v. United States** -- overdose of prescription drug allegedly caused sickness and death. Would even an appropriate does cause the harm? Did negligent overdose cause the harm? Calabresi found plaintiff had a case due to expert testimony ruling out other causes. Calabresi thinks negligent overdose is a causal link to injury because wouldn't limit dosage unless there was a danger.

## Multiple Causes, Indeterminate Causes, and Exceptions to the Conventional Test

### Theories Underlying the Causation Requirement

- If there is an injured plaintiff and negligent defendant, why do we need causation?

<!-- -->

- Justice between the Parties

  - If defendant did not cause the loss, then it seems obvious that there is no liability.

  - But if plaintiff has proved that defendant negligently risked harm to her, isn't that enough since defendant has wronged her?

  - Aren't defendants who do not hurt anyone just as blameworthy, but also lucky? Not practical to dispense with causation requirement.

  - **[Moral Luck]{.underline}**: A defendant who is negligent, but does not harm a plaintiff is not held liable for his negligence

- Causation and Deterrence

  - Instrumental view -- deter unreasonable behavior. Give an incentive to compare the amount of liability that they anticipate from taking a risk with the cost of reducing that risk by taking precautions.

  - Requiring causation communicates expectation in advance. Creating optimal deterrence.

### Injury Caused by Multiple Sufficient Causes

- Practical Reasons for MSC:

  a.  Can't calculate risk for each party

  b.  If we punish every risk created, life would be dull.

- Definition of MSC: not acting in concert but they could individually be a sufficient cause for the accident

  a.  Example: 2 cars, no headlights, collision

- Not "but for" causation; non-tortious (could have used extreme care and just had bad luck)

- Restatement 3d

- Substantial Factor test: Defendant's Negligence has to be found influential in some way

- Two Simultaneous Causes: **Both Negligent** -- two fires negligently started converge at the same time. Neither can avoid liability even though each fire individually is not the but-for cause. Each was a substantial factor. Law threatens too much liability over too little.

- Two Simultaneous Causes: **One Negligent, One Not** -- One fire is negligently caused. Negligent fire is cause of some damage, but damage would have happened anyway from non-negligent fire. Courts vary on the outcome in this situation.

- Sequential Causes: **Pre-emptive Causation** -- two fires arrive sequentially. First destroys the house and then second arrives (and would have destroyed house). First fire was "pre-emptive" cause and party causing first fire is liable if fire negligently set. Second fire is not responsible even if set negligently.

### Joint and Several Liability

- When two or more defendants are liable to the plaintiff for the same harm

  - All joint tortfeasors have to have all made a necessary contribution to the harm

  - Harm wouldn't have happened but for combined negligence of tortfeasors

- Each is liable as if he were the sole wrongdoer, responsible for the entirety of the plaintiff's damages. P can recover from either, but cannot recover more than the total damages awarded.

- Common law allowed a windfall for the defendant who didn't pay but states have remedied that with statutes that create rights of contribution among jointly and severally liable tortfeasors, meaning one defendant can be reimbursed by the other if they pay more than their share of the award.

- This rule places risk of defendant insolvency on other defendants instead of plaintiff.

- Many states now assess contribution shares of co-defendants in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to each co-defendant (like comparative negligence).

- **Joint tortfeasors** -- joint enterprise and one is negligent

- **Independent tortfeasors** -- single, theoretically indivisible harm

- **Independent tortfeasors** -- single, theoretically divisible but practically indivisible harm. Evidence does not show how much harm was caused by whom, although it is obvious that they are not equal.

- **Hymowitz** (CB, page 372) -- can joint/several liability apply here?

### Indeterminate Causes

- Plaintiff clearly injured by tortious conduct but cannot determine which of several defendants was more probably than not the cause of injury.

- **Alternative Liability**: **Summers v. Tice -** Two different hunters negligently shot in the direction of plaintiff. One shot created great injury. Each defendant was as probably as not the but-for cause. Court held that under these circumstances, the burden of proof shifted to the defendants to prove if they did not cause the harm. "Alternative liability" imposing liability on negligent defendants, each of whom is equally likely to have harmed the plaintiff. Some kind of connection amongst the defendants seems necessary with alternative liability. Also, in this case, plaintiff did not argue joint liability because he was part of the same hunting trip (Contributory negligence)

  - Distinguish from MSC

    - It's not that either shot could have caused harm; we know for sure one is causal and one is not

  - Holding both people liable though we know one is not, since we can't tell which one is not liable.

    - Reasoning:

      - Plaintiff can't prove which one and doesn't have the means or knowledge to do so; shifting the burden of proof to defendant

      - Don't want to exonerate both from liability just because one got lucky and didn't harm the plaintiff (they were both equally negligent, remember?)

  - Applying Alternative Liability to Hymowitz v. Eli Lily & Co. (CB, p. 372)

    - DES manufacturers would be in no better position to know about causation; shifting burden to them wouldn't work to resolve the issue

    - Many companies were not around anymore so couldn't shift burden to them

    - A lot has to do with damages and compensation (Hymowitz dissent)

- **Loss of Chance to Survive**

  - Already injured or ill plaintiff, whose chances of recovery or survival are reduced by the negligent actions of the defendant.

  - **Herskovits v. Group Health Cooperative** -- Doc failed to diagnose cancer until plaintiff's chance of survival was only 25%. Even without malpractice, chances would only have been 39%. Court held that there could be recovery, though not for all damage resulting from plaintiff's death. (This was a hypo in class)

  - Possible explanation -- defendant was held liable for the loss of the opportunity to survive. Defendant was the but-for cause of the loss or reduction in chances. Only for medical cases because of duty to prolong survival.

  - **Matsuyama v. Birnbaum** (890 N.E. 2d 819)

    - Case based on loss of chance

    - Special jury had decided, at trial, that, at time of negligence, there were 37.5% chances of survival; so, they gave damages for 37.5% of \$875,000 plus \$160k to estate for pain and suffering

    - Court's decision

      - Limits "lost chance" calculation to medical negligence cases

- **Market-Share Liability**

  - **Sindell v. Abbott Labs** (DES case) --Problem was that no individual plaintiff could identify which individual defendant caused the harm. Court circumvented the problem by holding that each plaintiff could recover from each defendant a portion of her damages equal to the defendant's share of the market for DES.

  - Theory behind Sindell -- It is clear that each defendant injured some plaintiffs, they should not escape liability because plaintiffs can't show which caused the injury.

  - Important -- DES made by all defendants was identical and harm could only be caused by DES. Therefore market share liability was an accurate surrogate

  - **Relative-market share** -- take available defendants and make them 100% of the market. Imposes excessive liability but provides complete recovery for plaintiffs

  - **Absolute-market share** -- only hold defendant liable for the actual percentage of the market, giving plaintiff less than complete recovery.

  - **Hymowitz v. Eli Lily & Co.**

+===========================+===================================================================================================+=========================+

- **Indeterminate Plaintiff**

  - Cases in which D causes injury, but impossible to say which P is injured (if a drug causes cancer in 60% of patients -- how to identify?)

  - *All or nothing* -- impose 100% liability when D at least 51% likely cause of harm -- threatens right amount of liability in the long run

  - *Proportional damages* -- some D are perpetually underdeterred since they are never over 51% responsible for damages. Courts have not imposed proportional liability since good data does not exist, and since proportional logic hard to confine to these cases alone.

- **Toxic Harms and Statistical Proof of Causation**

  - With respect to any given plaintiff in the area suffering from the particular cancer/harm, it is more probable than not that defendant was the but-for cause.

  - For most courts this kind of proof is insufficient to create liability because plaintiffs cannot prove their individual causation.

  - Proportional liability based on naked statistics is not usually enforced because of an array of problems, although such liability may cause good incentives for producers of such harm.

# The Scope of Liability: Proximate Cause

**Proximate Cause** -- liability is not imposed unless negligence is both cause in fact and proximate cause of injury.

## The Basics

Most issues of proximate cause can be resolved using a foreseeability test or by the harm-within-the-risk test.

- **Foreseeability (Forward looking)**

  - In ordinary cases, touchstone of proximate cause is foreseeability.

  - Defendant's negligence is the proximate cause of plaintiff's harm if causing that harm was a foreseeable result of acting as the defendant did.

- **The Harm-Within-The-Risk-Test**

  - In some "freak" cases, people would agree that as a matter of law, defendant's negligence was not a proximate cause of plaintiff's injury because injury was not a harm-within-the-risk that made the defendant's act negligent.

  - Is the risk of the injury suffered one of the risks that makes the defendant negligent for blocking access to the fire hydrant?

  - Act of negligence did not foreseeably increase risk of harm. What happened was not foreseeable.

  - **Berry v. Borough of Sugar Notch** -- Whether negligence of operating a trolley above speed limit was proximate cause of harm that resulted from a tree falling on the trolley as it passed? No, it was not.

  - **Gorris v. Scott** -- Sheep washed overboard because of failure to follow statutory requirement to have pens. But that regulation was to reduce risk of disease, so no proximate cause.

  - Scope of liability for negligence did not extend to these harms.

  - Trickier cases where harm was foreseeable but was not the principle risk (secondary risk):

    - **Wagner v. International RR** (Cardozo)-- Negligent in failing to close a train door, causing cousin to be thrown out. Plaintiff went to his rescue and was also injured. Principle risk of negligence was cousin falling out, but plaintiff's injury was also foreseeable. How much scope should you give the jury? Cardozo "**danger invites rescue**" so defendant's negligence makes plaintiff's injury foreseeable.

## Advanced Issues 

### Remoteness in Time or Space, and Directness

- Was the harm too remote in time and space? Or in directness?

- **Directness test** -- (backward looking) did the negligence cause harm to the plaintiff directly? In order to satisfy this test, usually it must also be close in time and space.

- Courts sometimes talk about a chain of causation, or a sequence of events set off by defendant's negligence.

- Usually, these tests have been integrated into the foreseeability test. They are not determinative, but are considerations.

### Intervention and Enablement

- Subsequent acts of third parties or other forces are the immediate cause of harm, but the original negligence is also a cause in fact of that harm.

- Is the first actor relieved of liability because of the subsequent acts of the second actor?

- Early courts followed **last-wrongdoer rule**.

- Sometimes this issue hinges on whether there was a duty between first actor and plaintiff. (bartender and person injured by drunk driver)

- Typically cases in which first actor enabled but did not cause harm through the second actor. Liability turns on the foreseeability of the subsequent wrongdoing or harm.

- **Intervening cause** -- when foreseeability of injury is one of the risks that is taken into account in deciding whether defendant's actions were negligent.

- Example -- driver who causes injury is also proximate cause for subsequent malpractice of doctors in treating that injury.

- **Superseding cause** -- risk of injury is so unforeseeable that it is not a factor to be taken into account at all in deciding whether defendant's actions were negligent.

- Sometimes subsequent intentional or criminal conduct breaks the chain between first actor and plaintiff. (Exception: leaving keys in car, car stolen, plaintiff injured by negligent thief)

- Even non-negligent actions by third parties may not break the chain. But also, in the car thief example, if the thief was using reasonable care when driving and still injured the plaintiff, there might not be enough connection with the first part.

### What Must be Foreseeable?

- **Unforeseeable Plaintiffs** - **Palsgraf v. LIR** (Cardozo)-- RR employee helping passenger on moving train, knocks package on track, package has fireworks and explodes, causing Mrs. Palsgraf's injury. Was injury to Mrs. P, down the track foreseeable when helping a passenger onto the train, even if done so negligently? Held that case could not go to jury as a matter of law because, although RR had duty of reasonable care towards Mrs. P, RR didn't breach that duty because harm to her was not a foreseeable risk of defendant's conduct.

  - Cardozo argues defendant's negligence doesn't foreseeably endanger this particular plaintiff. No need to determine proximate cause. Negligence is essentially relational and there is no duty relationship here.

  - **Andrews Dissent** -- There is a duty to the world, not just relational duties

    - Natural and continuous sequence

    - Not too many intervening causes

    - Is negligence likely to create that effect

    - Foreseeable post negligence

    - Not too remote time and place

- Restatement, Section 29

  - Definition of Negligence here as applied to Palsgraf

  - What makes risks tortious?

    - When a risk taken makes an act tortious (Negligent), then it counts.

      - E.g. give a gun to a child and she hurts herself by dropping it on her toe vs. give a gun to a child and she hurts herself or others by shooting it

      - Risk of giving gun = shooting it, not dropping it.

  - Restatement ties proximate cause to negligence

    - Where does foreseeability fit in?

    - 2-step test:

      - What is the Negligent risk "zone"?

      - Was what actually happened within foreseeable (negligent) risk?

- \*BP Oil Spill Story\*

- **Unforeseeable Extent of Harm** --

<!-- -->

- **Thin-skull rule** -- virtually universal -- foreseeable plaintiffs who suffer an unforeseeable extent of harm. No defense that plaintiff had an unforeseeable weakness that made extent of harm so great. "**Take the victim as you find them**."

- Thin skull rule avoids litigation complications of proving normal injury level and imposes a desirable level of strict liability for level of harm caused by negligence as defendants can foresee thin-skulled plaintiffs.

- Exceptions to thin-skull rule are in cases where it makes more sense for plaintiff to bear the risk of injury (plaintiff's negligence or plaintiff who does not mitigate damages)

<!-- -->

- **Unforeseeable Type of Harm**

  - Uncertain outcomes in these cases. (explosives fall on foot but do not explode example).

  - **In re Polemis** -- Plank fell into the ship hold and started a fire. Negligence caused plank to fall but fire could not reasonably been foreseen as a result of this negligence, although some damage was foreseen. Court held that defendant's negligence was proximate cause of harm since it was a direct consequence of the negligence.

  - **Wagon Mound** (overrules Polemis) -- Oil spill in harbor, causes fire two days later which damages plaintiff's dock and second plaintiff's ships on the dock. It was foreseeable that the oil would cause damage but not fire. 1^st^ plaintiff didn't argue that fire was foreseeable presumably because that would imply it was also foreseeable to plaintiff (contributory negligence wasn't in the common law yet). 2^nd^ plaintiff did argue it and won, probably because they were not on the scene. Unforeseeable type of harm, even if caused directly by defendant's negligence is not proximate cause, while unforeseeable extent of harm is. WM1 is not precedent for WMII because it is finding of facts for one case versus other case, even if cases arise out of same circumstances

- **Unforeseeable Manner of Harm**

  - Foreseeable plaintiff and injury, but injury occurs in a bizarre manner.

  - **Marshall v. Nugent** -- Plaintiff run off the road by defendant. Then goes to warn oncoming cars and gets hit. This did not preclude liability for the first actor, defendant. The fact that the foreseeable harm occurred in an unforeseeable manner is still proximate cause. Mcgruder says this is a case for the jury. Facts plus foreseeability matter a lot. Unforeseeable type of harm or unforeseeable details of the manner of harm?

## Judge, Jury, and the Underlying Purpose of Proximate Cause

- Judge and Jury

  - **Proximate cause as a matter of law** -- most cases this is obvious either there was or was not proximate cause and the judge decides.

  - Exceptional cases from this section show that the jury decides whether there is proximate cause if it is not obvious (reasonable people could disagree).

<!-- -->

- The Underlying Purpose of Proximate Cause

  - Proximate cause is a liability limiting doctrine.

  - Negligent defendants should not always bear liability to all the people or for all the harm they have caused. Enough is enough.

- **Causation is key!**

<!-- -->

- Defendant must prove that plaintiff's conduct was negligent or consisted of assumption of risk, that such conduct was a cause in fact of the plaintiff's injury, and that such conduct was a proximate cause of this injury.

- Both parties must prove what amounts to a full tort against each other but defendant has to prove that plaintiff breached a **duty to himself or herself.**

- **Contributory negligence** -- failure of the plaintiff to exercise reasonable care to protect himself or his property from the risk of harm or loss.

- Law and economics is not as concerned about contributory negligence as the moral approach because we already have an incentive to preserve ourselves, do not need a legal incentive.

- Aggregate social welfare -- person in best position to implement due care/precaution should do so. Sometimes that is the P not the D.

- **Butterfield v. Forrester** -- D put pole across road and P ran into it on a horse. Court finds that if P hadn't been going so fast, he would have noticed it. Court seemed to think it self-evident that a negligent plaintiff had no right to recover from a negligent defendant.

- Until about 1970 in the US, contributory negligence was a complete bar to recovery, regardless of the level of negligence.

- Contributory negligence is not fair nor does it create good incentives.

- **The Safety Statute Exception** - When defendant's negligence consisted of breach of a statute designed specifically to protect a class of persons unable to protect themselves, the contributory negligence of a member of the protected class does not bar recovery. Trying to cure harshness of contributory negligence rule.

- **The Greater-Degree-of-Blame Exception** -- Not a defense to an intentional tort because defendant is much more blameworthy. Same for willful or wanton torts that are not intentional but defendant acted in a way that is blameworthy. But if the plaintiff was also willfully or wantonly negligent, this cancelled out the defendant's blameworthy behavior.

- **Last Clear Chance**

  - If the negligence defendant had the last clear chance to avoid harming the plaintiff, then the plaintiff's contributory negligence was not a bar to recovery.

  - When the defendant had a chance that was both last and clear, it may be more blameworthy than ordinary negligence, even if plaintiff's negligence was present.

  - Clear chance is **open and obvious**. Last chance means at that point **plaintiff cannot remove himself** from harms way and defendant knows this OR has reason to know.

  - **Davies v. Mann** -- Plaintiff ties his donkey up and defendant drove his wagon over it. Defendant had the last clear chance.

  - Isn't this just a comparison of fault, giving more weight to the defendant's fault if they had a last clear chance to avoid it? LCC will not survive into comparative neg. regime.

  - **Li v.** **Yellow Cab** -- superceding cause

- Jury Question/General Verdict Approach -- Practice of submitting contributory negligence cases to the jury contributed to the demise of the regime. Jury applied "under the table" comparative negligence returning "quotient" verdicts in which they reduced plaintiff's recovery through a comparison of faults.

## Comparative Negligence

- All states except AL, MD, NC, VA and DC have some form of comparative negligence.

<!-- -->

- The Basics -- **Contributory negligence does not bar recovery**. Recovery is reduced in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to plaintiff.

  - **Pure v. Modified Comparative Negligence**

    - **Pure** form -- Plaintiff's negligence is never a complete bar from recovery. Comparative negligence applies even if the Plaintiff is more negligent than the defendant.

    - **Modified** -- If the plaintiff is more negligent or sometimes if equally negligent as defendant, plaintiff cannot recover.

  - The Basis for Comparison - Negligence not causation is what is measured. Someone can be minimally negligent but cause a lot of harm. The difficult decision regarding comparison is a job for the jury; there is not much law to guide it

  - Assessment -- Hard to tell different incentives that comparative v. contributory negligence regimes create. Comparative creates a greater sense of justice.

<!-- -->

- Applications

  - **Multiple Defendants** -- How to handle when plaintiff is more responsible than either defendant, but not both combined? Seems to sway towards no recovery in a modified comparative system because plaintiff is the actor with the most responsibility.

  - **Joint and Several Liability** -- if two defendants are responsible for different amounts of negligence, can one be responsible for both parts in the case of insolvency?

    - Hold defendants jointly and severally liable for the amount of the judgment (this has less appeal if defendants are just concurrent defendants, as opposed to joint tortfeasors)

    - Hold each defendant liable for only his or her own proportional share of the reduced judgment. If one is not able to pay, the loss rests with the plaintiff.

    - Plaintiff and solvent defendant are proportionally responsible for the insolvent defendant's share.

    - If plaintiff is even minutely contributorily negligent, then plaintiff gets nothing. If plaintive is comparatively negligent, only gets portion that was not caused by plaintiff.

  - **Effect on Other Common Law Doctrines** -- Comparative negligence statutes and cases do not outline effect on other doctrines such as last clear chance, assumption of risk or greater-degree-of-blame exceptions to contributory negligence

    - Last clear chance -- most courts have ruled that this is no longer dispositive and these cases should follow the comparative negligence scheme. Jury can take the last clear chance into account when dividing negligence.

    - Greater-degree-of-blame -- largely unnecessary once jury is already dividing degree of negligence. But some courts have said that plaintiff's negligence is no defense to an intentional or similar tort but same-degree-of-blame can be a defense in these same torts.

    - Assumption of risk still completely bars recovery when plaintiff knowingly assumes the risk that defendant will injure. Usually this only works if plaintiff's assumption was unreasonable and therefore negligent, which the jury when dividing negligence can take into account.

  - **Strict Liability** -- contributory negligence is only a defense against strict liability in some jurisdictions. Easiest to apply comparative negligence whenever contributory negligence used to apply but some still bar recovery based on plaintiff negligence in strict liability cases. Some say plaintiff's behavior is irrelevant

  - **Setoffs** -- If defendant counterclaims and both are given a judgment, so the party owing more just pay the difference or should both parties be required to pay out the whole amount? Seems to be that when insurance is involved, both insurers must pay the entire amount to the opposing party.

<!-- -->

- **Li v. Yellow Cab Co. of CA** -- P crossed three lanes and D hit her while going fast through a yellow light. P's contributory neg. barred recovery and court established a comparative negligence regime instead.

<!-- -->

- Comparative negligence is preferable to all-or-nothing because of logic, experience and justice

- This doesn't violate the statute which codifies all-or-nothing

- Practical difficulties should not dissuade the court

- Should be applied in the pure form

- New rule should be given limited retrospective application

- Also -- flavor of superceding cause in "Last Clear Chance" exception to contributory N

<!-- -->

- Comparative Negligence via Statute -- many state legislatures dictate what type of comparative negligence (pure or modified) to use in court.

## Assumption of Risk 

- Flavor of contracts; Subjective standard

- Historically, assumption of risk is a class-based doctrine requiring workers and servants to assume work risks instead of their employers.

- **Express Assumption of Risk** -- Individual contractually agrees in advance to waive his or her right to bring a tort action against a potential injurer. These agreements are often valid when entered knowingly, voluntarily, and with appreciation of significance. Type of service and bargaining power are also important.

- **No Duty of Care Breached by Defendant** -- **Primary assumption of risk** -- The injury was not caused by a breach of duty by defendant because plaintiff assumed the risk of such an injury by participating, generally knowing this type of injury was possible. Example of being hit with a ball in a baseball stadium.

- **A Subset of Contributory Negligence** -- **Secondary assumption of risk** -- This is a subset of comparative negligence and therefore does not bar recovery

  - Failure to recognize or appreciate a risk that a reasonable person would have (not assumption of risk since they didn't know, this is contributory negligence)

  - Conscious taking of an unreasonable risk (assumption of risk since they knowingly took the risk)

<!-- -->

- **Conscious, Reasonable Risk-Taking** -- Eckert (rescue baby on tracks) -- Sometimes even a reasonable assumption of risk can be a defense against plaintiff's recovery if that assumption **implies a waiver**.

- Historically this doctrine just barred employees from recovering (Lamson). This is now irrelevant because workers compensation laws, which mostly reject assumption of risk because it is not a free choice when it is a job.

- **Murphy v. Steeplechase --** Flopper Case! Court found that P assumed the risk of participating in the theme park ride due to his information and the fact that his injury could have been foreseen by him. Court reversed finding for P and ordered a new trial.

  - Risk assumed was the fall, in general

    - Assumed they would fall

    - Also assumed risk of defendant being negligent

  - Defendants have burden of showing plaintiff's contributory negligence or assumption of risk

  - Express

    - Unconscionability

# Strict Liability and Nuisance 

Liability for abnormally dangerous activities, nuisance and vicarious liability, all can be imposed without regard for negligence. Key is to understand the criteria for which the negligence requirement is dropped. Also understand what motivates the courts (policy, fairness, etc.).

## Theories of Strict Liability

- **Reducing Information and Error Costs**

<!-- -->

- Adducing proof of negligence can be costly as opposed to just showing that defendant was involved in a particular activity that has strict liability. Less litigation costs.

- But, with strict liability there will be more claims, which counters the lower cost.

- Greater risk of error in individual negligence cases but may be a greater rate of imposing liability on non-negligence defendants under strict liability.

<!-- -->

- **Influencing Activity Level and Research Decisions**

<!-- -->

- Assuming that negligence liability is accurately imposed by strict liability, strict liability may not increase safety measures due to economics of cost of safety measures versus cost of litigation/liability.

- But those who participate in the activities a lot will consider alternative methods of conducting their activities, i.e. activities that cause fewer non-negligent accidents.

- Negligence regime creates incentives to take economic safety measures (as does strict liability) but strict liability also incentivizes shifting to safer activities altogether.

- This will encourage more research to find ways to better avoid liability even for accidents that are technically not worth avoiding in a negligence regime. Although investments in research do not always result in better alternatives.

- Even when there is no strict liability, strict liability is then imposed on the injured, not the injurer as they have to bear the cost of a non-negligently caused harm.

<!-- -->

- **Promoting Insurance or Broad Distribution of Losses**

<!-- -->

- Who is in a better position to avoid harm? Injured or injurer?

- Also, who is in a better position to insure against the harm and distribute the loss?

- Frequently, large institutions/injurers are better able to distribute loss, but this is not always the case (auto accident liability where individuals distribute loss).

<!-- -->

- **Satisfying Rights-Based Norms of Responsibility**

<!-- -->

- Responsibility for harm-causing conduct. Those who benefit from engaging in activity should pay the costs associated with it.

- Reciprocity theory -- strict liability when defendant poses risks for potential victims that victims do not pose for others. Defendant creates a disproportionate risk. This means relational strict liability.

- Libertarian -- liability should be imposed when an injurer acts in a manner that causes the invasion of the liberty of others. But this is only imposed when harm is caused through violation of liberty. (force, compulsion, dangerous condition)

## Traditional Strict Liability (Rylands through 1960s)

- The rise of liability for **Ultra-hazardous Activities**

<!-- -->

- **Rylands v Fletcher** -- Defendant's reservoir leaked onto Plaintiff's land. Defendant not negligent but presumably his contractors were. Case appeals through several layers of courts and ultimately found strict liability against the Defendant. Court found this was **non-natural use of land** (negligence standard for natural use of land). Could have been decided in negligence - D is vicariously liable for the independent contractors. Vicarious liability is a form of strict liability anyway, except only for negligence of employees, not all actions. Strict liability that sounds in negligence.

  - Re-emergence of Strict Liability, separated from old system of trespass; working against backdrop of Negligence

  - **Trial Court** -- liable because water came onto P's land

  - **Appeals Court** -- liable for anything that could escape onto P's land

    - What is emphasized?

      - No negligence on Ryland's part -- blame-free plaintiff

      - Expressly mentions list of thigns that are dangerous and could cause "mischief" (list on page 509, CB)

> These things = operating at own peril = Liability

- Things that can "escape" and cause "mischief"

  - Talking about beasts -- tame v. vicious distinction

<!-- -->

- (Foreseeability) Expectations

<!-- -->

- **Supreme Court** -- liable for artificial/non-natural use

  - Natural/Non-Natural distinction

    - Some idea of action/creation that leads to non-natural use

    - "Pushing boundaries of safety" = non-natural

<!-- -->

- Look at **Turner v. Big Lake Oil**, **Cities Service Co. v. State**, and **State v. Ventron**

  - Factors/Values

    - Necessity (TX case -- need water)

    - Good for Society

    - Pay your own way (FL case 🡪 spillovers are worrisome because society all clumped together)

    - Strict Liability for toxic waste (all 3 cases)

      - Danger! Foreseeability of harm/danger

- American courts began to develop a series of specific and limited exceptions finding liability with no negligence. Starting with explosions, oil wells and storage of water or damage from livestock. Court decided which activities had strict liability, not jury.

- Absolute nuisance became ultra hazardous activity -- 1) degree of danger it posed, 2) how common it was in the area. The more dangerous and less common, the more likely to be found ultra hazardous.

<!-- -->

- The Modern Conception: Strict Liability for "**Abnormally Dangerous**" Activities (1960s through present)

<!-- -->

- **Factors assessing strict liability** (dangerousness and commonness -- From Restatement 2d and 3d):

<!-- -->

- Dangerousness

  - Degree of risk

  - Probability of harm

  - Inability to eliminate the risk by the exercise of reasonable care (most influential)

- Commonness

  - Extent to which the activity is uncommon (most influential)

  - Its inappropriateness to the area; AND

  - Extent to which the value of the activity to the community is outweighed by its dangerousness (least influential)

<!-- -->

- New test reflects courts tendency to engage in case-by-case analysis

- Lose a level of generality but allowed courts to weigh different factors.

- **Indiana Harbor v. American Cyanamid Co.** (CB, p. 521)-- Shipping of toxic/flammable chemicals via leased RR. Car leaked while switching cars. Plaintiff had to do the clean up. Court declined to impose strict liability for fairly specific reasons, because:

  - Probability that the leak could have been prevented through reasonable care (leaks do not obscure evidence)

  - Impossibility of strict liability having an activity-level effect

  - Posner wants us to think about care and negligence

  - Why not use Strict Liability?

    - Strict Liability would affect activity levels in this case and 52 other chemicals 🡪 don't want to discourage future shipping by imposing Strict Liability when Negligence is sufficient (p. 525)

    - Restatement Section 519(c) = organizing, central factor for determining Strict Liability

      - If unable to eliminate risk through due care, Strict Liability applies. If so, Negligence applies.

    <!-- -->

    - Posner's Policy arguments against Strict Liability

      - Lots of things went wrong but could all be tied to lack of due care, which is Negligence

      - Negligence is a better answer because if courts get analysis wrong, fewer cases are affected; under SL, whole industry bears costs/burdens of effects

      - Functionalist analysis

      - Sometimes, there are mutually created risks too

        - Example: House on O'Hare Airport runway (526)

        - Under SL, one side pays all costs and other side goes scot-free; this reduces incentives to exercise care for future plaintiffs since all costs are shifted to defendants

<!-- -->

- Restatements:

  - Second Restatement: (6 qualifications of abnormally dangerous, p.630)

    - Abnormally dangerous activity subject to liability for harm, even if due care is exercised.

    - Liability is limited to the kind of harm which makes the activity abnormally dangerous.

  - Third Restatement: Activity is abnormally dangerous if . . .

    - 1\) whether activity poses a foreseeable and highly significant risk of harm,

    - 2\) whether activity is a matter of common usage.

<!-- -->

- Animals:

  - There is strict liability (which sounds in negligence) for all wild animals and domestic animals with demonstrated violence. If no demonstrated tendency, regular foreseeability negligence regime.

<!-- -->

- Scope of Liability and Defenses

<!-- -->

- There is liability only for the kind of harm whose risk makes the activity abnormally dangerous (characteristic risks)

- Relevant activity must be the cause in fact and the proximate cause of the harm. Therefore, strict liability is not absolute.

- Defendant is usually not strictly liable if harm results from an act of god, unforeseeable intervention of third party or plaintiff's knowing and unreasonable assumption of risk.

<!-- -->

- Justifications for Strict Liability:

<!-- -->

- Epstein, Calabresi. Posner pushes back. Assuming a partial regime where only some activities merit strict liability, why is Rylands an appropriate place to start?

- Reciprocity of risk.

- Posner: Best situation for strict liability is when you are trying to achieve activity level effects. If you can manage risk by taking better care, then negligence can handle by incentivizing reasonable care. Some activities that even when greatest care is taken, there is still risk.

- Abraham: Thinks activity level effects are a good reason to have strict liability.

- We think about strict liability on the category level, not on a case-by-case level. But how specific are these categories? Driving or driving with known medical conditions?

- Why does uncommonness matter? Does it limit the floodgates?

- SL cases can be adjudicated more efficiently but may have floodgates if all you have to do is show causation and damages.

- Is SL about duty? Higher level of care if activities put others at risk/others are vulnerable? Then duty goes beyond a negligence standard?

  - Strict Liability v. Negligence

    - How does SL affect care levels?

      - SL is about activity levels; N is about care levels

      - However, SL also affects care levels; SL might be better where care could eliminate risk

      - Courts determine the threshold of care in Negligence cases; individuals determine care levels in SL cases

      - Negligence can affect activity levels too; cost of taking care can affect activity levels

  - What do regimes of liability for Defendant mean for Plaintiffs?

    - Policy Question: Should D's have defenses of contrib. N and comp. N available to them for SL? (i.e. SL+Contrib. N and SL+Comp. N)

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Defendant**                          **Plaintiff (P's Loss)**
  -------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  No Liability (no duty)                 Strict Liability

  Strict Liability                       No Liability

  Negligence Only                        Strict Liability, unless D is Negligent (contributory negligence)

  Negligence + Contributory Negligence   Strict Liability, unless P is not Negligent and Defendant is Negligent

  Pure Comparative Negligence            Pure Comparative Negligence
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Activity/Care Levels

  - Strict Liability says "pay your own way" so it forces people to decide their activity AND care levels. Courts don't have to set the levels.

- Think Like Posner: Cheapest Cost Avoider (CCA)

  - If you're looking for CCA, and you know Strict Liability will take care of this, why even look at negligence?

    - Institutional Competence

      - Sometimes, courts are better at setting care levels

      - If courts make errors, negligence is a better form

        - Setting care levels wrong = not a big deal

    - If Strict Liability, one side goes scot-free and has no incentive to regulate their behavior/"levels"

    - Functionality of Negligence Standard

      - If you know the law sets a particular care level for folks to follow, you know how much care to take yourself.

      - Coordinating function

      - If you know there's a particular standard, you'll adjust accordingly.

    - Aim of Tort Law -- Loss distribution

      - If SL, can't spread losses the way you might want to

      - When no liability, everyone else like you bears the risk 🡪 all potential plaintiffs

    - Aim of Tort Law -- Fairness

      - Fairness is subjective and hard to define

      - Principles

        - Societal interest 🡪 blame/fault

          - Those who are blameworthy should be punished

        - With SL, it seems that one side bears the loss.

        - Without SL, plaintiff seems to bear more of the loss.

- Holmes' Argument: If government gets involved, it should be for good reason. Else, people should be left to their own devices.

- **Palsgraf v. LIRR (w/facts changed a bit) Hypothetical**

  - Hypothetical: What if the man who was carrying the explosives was caught and was actually employed by a company to transport the explosives? What if the company was said by Palsgraf? Should SL apply?

  - Restatement: If you can apply care levels, use Negligence.

  - How we define the activity = important

  - Applying Restatement (2d) factors to activity (defined as transporting explosives)

    - Commonality of usage? - Yes.

    - Inappropriateness of activity to place? -- Is there another way to transport?

    - High Risk? --Yes.

    - Likelihood of great harm? -- Yes

    - Inability to eliminate risk by due care? -- No, maybe could exercise more care; don't get on train!

## 

## Vicarious Liability

- Liability for injury caused by the conduct of another party -- is the doctrine known as **respondeat superior**. Employer is liable under some circumstances for the torts committed by an employee.

- Employers have their own liability for negligence of their own acts. This is for when the employer is technically not negligent.

- Negligence of their employees must be "**within the scope of employment**."

- Employer is in a better position to pay and to make decisions regarding safety. Also it will sometimes be difficult to prove a singular employee responsible.

- Employee continues to be liable for his or her own negligence, this just adds the employer as an additional defendant.

- **Qualifications** of vicarious liability:

  - Who is the employee? There is a bright-line distinction between employees and independent contractors with regard to respondeat superior.

  - Tort at issue must be committed within the **scope of employment**. Distinction between a **detour** (which is within the scope) and a **frolic** (outside the scope). Not always possible to draw a bright line between detours and frolics.

# Trespass (The Property Torts)

## Basic Factors/"Moving Parts" of Trespass

1)  Entry

2)  \$ damages 🡪 What's the remedy?

3)  Harm? (not necessarily linked to damages; can get nominal damages without harm)

4)  Care/Fault? (Doesn't matter)

5)  Intent? (Have to intend entry, not nec. intend to trespass; very low threshold of proof)

## Nature of Property Torts

- **Trespass** to land or personal property -- Breach the boundary of or touches the plaintiff's real or personal property, or otherwise physically interferes with the plaintiff's right of possession, which includes the right to exclude others from occupying or using that property. No intent to trespass necessary.

- **Conversion** -- unauthorized transfer of the plaintiff's personal property to a third party's possession. Often more is at stake than money. Pets are property.

## Defenses, Especially the Privilege of Necessity

- Other privileges can be defenses to property invasion such as necessity, defense of property, recapture of chattels or land, action in pursuit of legal process.

- **Necessity** means defendant acted reasonably in harming property in order to avoid harm to himself or his property (risk of harm cannot be created by the plaintiff).

  - **Public necessity** -- risk to a large amount of property and damage to plaintiff's property was necessary to avoid larger loss. Absolute defense against liability.

  - **Private necessity** -- risk to one party/property only which can be reduced or eliminated by damaging plaintiff's property. This is qualified or conditional privilege defense and therefore compensation for damage is required.

    - Privilege to do harm to another's property to prevent harm to yourself or your property, which is of greater value (p. 957, CB)

    - Not just about weighing risk; has huge element of necessity

    - If you have time and know in advance that you need to use a person's private property, contract for it. Strike a bargain.

- **Ploof and Vincent**: The Basics --

  - Ploof -- Plaintiff had privilege of necessity to tie up at defendant's dock. Privilege means this was not a trespass so defendant did not have the right to untie the boat. Defendant was liable for damages.

  - Vincent -- Ship docked during storm causes damage to the dock. Even though it might have been negligent for defendant to leave the dock, they were still liable for damages because they had a conditional privilege. No wrongdoing, but saving the ship at the expense of the dock required compensation. There was an opportunity to contract. Dissent -- was the act of placing the cables what shifted liability?

+=================================+=======================================+======================================+

- Asymmetry between owner and trespasser when doing the reasonable thing.

- You have to pay under usage both under "privilege" [and]{.underline} under "trespass"

  - Pay your own way 🡪 forces you to weigh gains vs. harms you have to pay for

<!-- -->

- The Property Rights Explained -- Sometimes liability for damage caused when necessity exists stems from foreseeability of the harm (Vincent).

- **The Deterrence/Resource Allocation Explanation**

  - Who Should be Liable? Whomever was in the best place to avoid damage/assess damage?

  - When it Matters Who is Liable: **The Coase Theorem**

    - Let the parties come to a solution together through cost shifting. This possibility means making the wrong rule in court doesn't matter much since parties can avoid it.

    - When parties are strangers, this is prohibitive because parties cannot contract in advance.

## Unintended Intrusions

Under this theory, you can be liable for trespass for damages incurred when you are on another's property. Damages have to be proven (Harm). There is a recognition that one can be being negligent (or another tort) and be liable under trespass for damages too.

## Martin v. Reynolds Metals Co.

- Under this jurisdiction, energy is a good argument

  - Could have drawn connections to old-fashioned trespass cases (flying boiler) too though.

- Case suggests that energy could count -- rays of light, etc.- for trespass

- This case was litigated as a trespass case since the statute of limitations on nuisance claims had expired.

- When we think of trespass as old-fashioned and rule like, it does soften up when it overlaps with other torts.

- **Tools for Arguing Against Trespass**

  - Landowner's feelings -- violation of person's boundaries; hard to prove this

    - Think about landowner's interest in keeping property private (p. 678, CB)

    - May lead to violence if trespass occurs

  - Directness of Intrusion

    - No way to avoid it

- How would you characterize Martin on line of traditional trespass and modern trespass?

  - Characterization of particles as an intrusion = modern, new age trespass

  - Softened up edges of old-fashioned trespass law

    - Particles = intrusion

    - Exclusive possession

      - Protecting dignitary interest and Feeling of exclusive possession, not just the fact of it

      - If you\'re sending something over and if people feel like that\'s interfering with exclusive possession, trespass.

      - Need to show some harm to get trespass

    - If you don\'t show harm in trespass, you just get nominal damages.

# Nuisance

3 Factors/Moving Parts (CB, p. 681):

1)  Using and enjoying property; not necessarily about [entry]{.underline}

2)  What about [harm]{.underline}?

    a.  Has to be shown (invasion of use and enjoyment; have to prove that it's intuitive)

3)  Intent?

    a.  Not necessary (see Section 822, Restatement)

        i.  Intentional and unreasonable; or

        ii. Unintentional and arising out of negligent or reckless conduct or abnormally dangerous conditions or activities

- Section 825 -- deals with intentional nuisances

## Private Nuisance

![](media/image3.png){width="7.084904855643044in" height="3.584905949256343in"}

- Intentional Nuisance requires unreasonable interference

  - When looking at unreasonable interference, courts look at the gravity of harm vs. the utility of the conduct

    - There could be substantial harm that outweighs the utility of the conduct and plaintiff shouldn't have to bear it

  - Courts also look at the seriousness/substantiality of the unreasonable interference

    - Is it possible for the defendant to keep paying for the conduct's harm without discontinuing the conduct?

      - Sometimes that's what happens.

- What do we mean by intent?

  - If you know your conduct will create a nuisance, that's sufficient for intent.

- Restatement 829(a), p. 683 of CB -- defines when gravity outweighs utility

  - Presuming the nuisance is unreasonable, what if the utility outweighs the gravity?

    - ***Boomer v. Atlantic Cement Co.***

## Boomer v. Atlantic Cement Co.

- Would Boomer have fit under unreasonable interference under the gravity v. utility analysis?

  - No. The utility outweighed gravity of harm.

  - Need something else for Boomer to qualify it as unreasonable.

    - Second component of Restatement Section 826

      - Logic of Boomer = defendant keeps paying without stopping conduct

## Remedies 

- Injunctions

  - Lots of nuisances are ongoing, so you want to stop the activity or provide for future claims/ongoing claims

- Boomer Remedies

  - Injunction = old remedy (serious business -- difficult to get)

    - If damage was substantial and continuing, then there was an injunction

# Conversion

- One party assumes possession over another's party without consent or lawful justification

- That party becomes effectively the owner of the property by doing something only the owner can do

  - Stealing car and selling it = conversion

  - Stealing car, denting it, returning it = trespass of chattels

## Moore v. Regents of California

- Patient at UCLA 🡪 hairy-cell leukemia

  - Spleen removed; cells were unique and valuable for research

  - Cells were used to develop pharma products; highly profitable

  - Used his cells for research continuously over 7 years without permission

- Case framed under conversion -- "HIS genetic material"

- Defendant's Case -- The research made it into something, so the benefits were derived from that work, not the cells

- Intent = important

- Issues with applying conversion law to this case

  - Moore abandoned the organ

    - But: he didn't express intent to abandon or any desire to keep it

  - Expanded impact of applying conversion to this case 🡪 How does this affect the activities here?

    - Policy Arguments

      - Consequences for research and scientists

      - Legislative interest

- Think about *Boomer* in this context too

  - Environmental arguments 🡪 Extend/Apply?

## Kremen v. Cohen

- Sex.com case

  - Conversion without document

- What kind of moves does the Kremen court case make re: conversion?

  - Chooses a squarely "apply" angle

  - Cites other CA cases where conversion without document is involved and Restatement is ignored

  - No idea that domain registration was put into a document

    - CA has already rejected the Restatement

    - CA courts, although dealing with rights merged into documents, doesn't put too much weight into documentation. So, the intangible right (domain name) can count without being documented.

  - Case tries to suggest domain name is property and links it to how CA courts have decided on documentation.

# Trespass to Chattels

## Intel v. Hamidi

- Trespass to chattels alleged because using a computer is not amounting to taking ownership of it or using it only as an owner could

- Theory based on: Distraction to Employees/Loss of Employee Time due to content of emails

  - **Burden of Proof:** have to show damage/harm for trespass of chattels; Intel does not show this

  - Court sees this as an extension of the law

  - Court does not extend trespass to chattels rule for this case 🡪 Other areas of tort law are able to deal with this issue

- Theory based on: Trespass to land because Hamidi used Intel servers for his emails

  - Why think about trespass to land?

    - Clear, hard-lined rule

    - Intent would not matter

    - Would not need to show damage/harm

# Remedies

## Injunctions

### Ebay v. MercExchange

- Seen as creating major change in how courts are thinking of when/how to give an injunction

- MercExchange tried to get an injunction against half.com/ebay for using a payment system that it had patented.

- Case History

  - District court denied MercExchange injunction; Court of Appeals reversed

  - Law/Equity divide

    - Jury does law decisions; gives damages

    - Judge does more equity functions

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **eBay Majority**                             **Chief Justice Rehnquist + Concurrence**                                                                                                                **Kennedy + Concurrence**
  --------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Always do the equitable analysis (Standard)   Property = injunction, i.e. if you allow someone to use the property by paying someone for it, then not something you can get an injunction for (Rule)   Right ≠ remedy\
                                                                                                                                                                                                         Need to do case-by-case analysis to identify whether there are "patent trolls" who should be enjoined (Standard)

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- 4-Prong Test for Equitable Analysis - Plaintiff must demonstrate:

  - that it has suffered an irreparable injury

  - that remedies available at law are inadequate to compensate for that injury

  - that considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; AND

  - that the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction

- Problems with 4-prong test (Gregen/Golden/Smith journal article)

  - First 2 prongs are essentially one and the same

    - Requirement of proof of past irreparable injury to justify injunction to prohibit future infringing behavior (p. 209)

  - What does 4-prong test leave out? What concerns about outcomes?

    - If limiting equitable analysis to these 4 things, there are other traditional equitable concerns left out 🡪 estoppel, etc.

    - Worried about the use of presumptions 🡪 are they okay?

### TVA v. Long

- What does the judge keep coming back to?

  - Government interest in protecting their property rights

## Compensatory Damages

### Seffert []{.mark}v. Los Angeles Transit Lines, p. 711-18 of CB

- Plaintiff is getting onto bus and door closes on her leg; bus drags her and causes serious and permanent harm, all described in graphic detail in opinion. Huge pain and suffering damages in comparison to damages for economic loss.

- Types of Compensatory Damages

  - Economic Loss

    - Medical bills - \$

    - Loss of earnings/lost income - \$

  - Pecuniary Loss

    - Pain and suffering - \$?

- Judge Traynor -- worried about consistency in awarding damages; thought pain and suffering damages were excessive

## Punitive Damages

- Purposes of Punitive Damages

  - Deter

    - Forward-looking

    - Deterring [this]{.underline} plaintiff's harm

    - Deterring [other]{.underline} plaintiffs'/society's harm

  - Punish

    - Backward-looking

    - Punishing Defendant's badness

      - With regard to [this]{.underline} Plaintiff

      - With regard to [other]{.underline} Plaintiffs/Society

### Exxon v. Baker

- Exxon Valdez tanker has accident. Captain had been an alcoholic and went to do "paperwork" during a dangerous maneuver instead of keeping an eye on operations. Ship hit iceberg, giant oil spill. Billions of dollars of damages

- Oil Spill: 1989, Decision:2008

- Issues: Whether punitive damages can be applied in maritime law? If so, how much? How can we set limits on it, if we want to set limits on it?

- What influences Supreme Court in deciding how to constrain punitive damages?

  - Federal statutes

  - State statutes

  - Criminal law

  - International history

  - Actual awards given in other cases

  - Jury instructions from prior cases

### State Farm v. Campbell, p. 760 of CB

- Judicial Review of damages set by jury, using BMW v. Gore Guideposts

  - Reprehensibility

  - Multiplier/ratio between punitive and compensatory damages

  - Other penalties that could have been applied

- Ratio of Punitive Damages to Compensatory damages should not be higher than single digit

### Philip Morris

- Talking about jury instructions here

  - Lead you to take harms to non-parties into account

### Ways to Constrain Punitive Damages

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Exxon**                  **State Farm**                      **Phillip Morris**

  Maximum multiplier (1:1)   "Single-Digit" multiplier maximum   Ignores multiplier issue
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Mass Torts/Class Actions

- Why Class Actions?

  - Plaintiffs

    - \$ in controversy too small individually

    - Pool resources (legal, discovery, etc.)

    - Shows a pattern of harm

    - Avoid duplication, save \$\$

    - Get more \$; push settlement (leverage)

    - Get more press attention

  - Defendants

    - Be done with it in one go

    - "global peace"

    - Don't have to litigate again since future plaintiffs are precluded

  - Rest of society

    - Administration/coordination

    - Avoid clogging courts

    - Substitute for Punitive Damages which are passed onto consumers

    - Distributional limit benefits; no "windfalls"

- Limited Fund Class Actions -- think about companies that will go bankrupt if all members of class don't sue together; don't want funds to dry up

  - Mandatory; only works if people cannot opt out

- Settlement Class Actions

  - You settle before you file so the whole package goes to the court/judge for approval at once

    - You go through certification and settlement approval at the same time (FRCP Rule 23e)

- **Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor**

  - Asbestos case

  - Conflicts within class

  - Present/future harms

    - Some have present injuries; some will get future injuries

  - Problems: issues of notice, variations in harm

- "Punitive Damages Classes"

  - **In Re Simon II**

    - Consolidation of tobacco cases in 2000

    - "plaintiffs sought, and the district court certified, a nation-wide class of smokers seeking only punitive damages in 'an attempt to provide a procedural solution to the problem of repetitive and unrelated judgments for punitive damages (limited by constitutionally required overall caps) in this massive and complex litigation.' In re Simon 11,211 F.R.D. at 96." (Surgeon General Amicus Brief)

    - Individual claims are too varied; different plaintiffs are from different states which all have different punitive damages laws -- this will make it difficult to calculate PD for all

- Repeat Punitive Damages Problem

  - PD might be repeated. What's wrong with that?

    - Plaintiff 1 sues and gets compensatory damages + PD

    - Plaintiff 2 sues and gets compensatory damages + PD too

    - ...

    - Plaintiff 15 sues and gets compensatory damages + PD as well

  - This is over-punishment if the court issues judgment thinking that this is all Punitive Damages not only for this specific plaintiff's harm but also for society, etc.

  - If there's a strong individualistic view of what PD is doing, maybe no problem after all

    - Overlapping and redundant PD if not individualistic

  - Judge Weinstein says combine all the plaintiffs to solve the repeat PD problem

    - Reprehensibility

      - With separate claims, reprehensibility grows as you get to later plaintiffs

      - When combined, can look wholly more reprehensible too, though.

    - Defendant hit hard only once when combined claims, rather than again and again.

    - Limited Fund Theory Class Action

      - Might run out of money since there is only a fixed-total amount of PD the Defendant should have to pay; that would run out if you kept applying PD to multiple individual cases in a row

## Multi-District Litigation (MDL)

- Substitute for mass tort class actions

- Draws a bunch of cases together from anywhere and consolidates across districts

  - All pre-trial

- Bellwether trials = representative couple of trials

- Designed for discovery for mass torts

  - Get them together and do discovery all at once, rather than separately

  - Saves costs and gives a clear idea of how each individual case would turn out if tried separately

  - Plaintiffs have the opportunity to opt out of the decision if they don't agree with the decision and want to try it out on their own.

- 2 things happening

  - Bellwether trials

  - Settlements while consolidated in the transferee court (quick, easier)

- What devices are useful for deciding cases under MDL/litigating them?

  - Opt-out optin

  - Not binding

  - Bellwethers

  - Settlement threshold (e.g. 85% sign up for it to go through)

- **Vioxx**

  - Merck lost 11 of 16 bellwethers/state court cases. So Merck issued a substantial settlement.

  - Also, Merck had set aside \$700 million for fighting the 28,000 cases, so settling early on meant they could put that money toward the settlement and issue a handsome settlement early on.

# Compensation Funds

- 9/11, BP(I), BP(II)

- 9/11 Fund

  - Set up by Congress; part of a package; got rid of airline liability and port authority liability, etc.

- BP (I)

  - Set up by BP

- BP (II)

  - BP(I) was taken over by court approved settlement in an MDL

# Policy Issues

At various points in the course, we discussed different policy considerations that come into play when courts decide how to rule. Various judges and scholars, including Calabresi and Posner, have made elaborate arguments about the policies and incentives that come out of various types of decisions. Some of these arguments are outlined here. Full list of these types of arguments: Rules v. Standards, (Conflicting) Aims of Tort Law, Who Decides?, Moral Luck, No Duty, Sovereign Immunity, Coase Theorem, Extend/Apply Doctrines of Law, and Act vs. Omission

## Rules v. Standards

+==================+=====================================+===============================+

- How to make a standard rule-like = "specifying the content" beforehand (list out what it would apply to)

- Rules specify things in advance; Standards deal with issues after the fact

## No Duty

- Policy-Based: Strauss v. Belle Realty Co. (1985) -- CB, p. 168-173

  - Strauss sued landlord and ConEdison when he was injured on the stairs in a common area of his apartment building during a power outage.

  - The Court compared ConEdison to a public service

    - Natural monopoly because no way to find another company to provide same utilities without significant costs and a time lag

    - ConEd = essentially a public actor

      - Have to be careful about tort liability with public actors

      - Don't want ConEd to have to cut power or to go under in order to cover liability costs

  - **Perverse Incentives** from giving ConEd immunity

    - Policy question: How do we relieve a company, the government or an officer of liability without creating perverse incentives?

    - If ConEd is given immunity, and only held liable for blackout damages to customers in the place for which they are paying light bills, ConEd will have a perverse incentive to contract only with the city or the apartment building owner to prevent owing liability.

  - Summary: Strauss

    - Limiting principle: privity of contract

    - Reasoning: appeal to public services/public policy

    - Worry: ConEd will have "crushing burden" (would we care so much if it was a private corporation?)

    - Bright-Line Rule

- No Duty: Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of California (CB, p. 151)

  - When the patient makes a threat, there is a duty to protect the patient and those specific third parties he threatens. Highly contested rule but this duty is supposed to be carefully and narrowly circumscribed. 2 sets of relationships. Why is there a relationship/duty between doctor and Tarasoff? Medicine prescription (increases harm, misfeasance) v. mental health (doesn't increase likelihood of harm, non-feasance). Ds could be liable and P can amend complaint.

  - When is there no duty?

    - Doctor-Patient confidentiality and Ethics

    - No affirmative duty under special relationships

    - When predictions could be bad -- false alarms, stigma, false negatives

  - Duty to warn?

    - Note 5, CA Civil Code Reaction to Tarasoff

    - Must warn "foreseeable victim of danger" (p. 153)

    - Must warn "reasonably identifiable victim" (p. 154)

  - Drawing a "Duty Line" (p. 151, last paragraph) -- Tarasoff Test (balancing)

    - Foreseeability

    - "certainty"

    - Connection

    - Moral blame

    - Prevention

    - Burden to defendant

    - Community

    - Insurance?

## Sovereign Immunity

- Federal Torts Claims Act (FTCA)

  - The way the US government waived sovereign immunity, opening itself up to liability with some limitations:

    - No jury

    - No punitive damages

    - Suits brought under state law

    - Primarily talking about Negligence

    - Principle exception = discretionary exemption

  - Discretionary Exemption 🡪 2-step test (from *Cope v. Scott*, p. 251 of CB)

    - Specific directive? (specified)

    - "policy judgment" -- "fraught" with public policy considerations?

    - Specific Language - "In the first step, we determine whether it is appropriate to analyze the action under the first or the second clause of the exception. In other words, we ask whether any \"federal statute, regulation, or policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an employee to follow.\".... If a specific directive exists, then the employee had no \"choice.\" The only issue is whether the employee followed the directive, and is thus exempt under the first clause, or whether the employee did not follow the directive, thus opening the government to suit....This brings us to the second step of the test, where the \"basic inquiry\" is whether the challenged discretionary acts of a government employee \"are of the nature and quality that Congress intended to shield from tort liability.\".... Decisions that require choice are exempt from suit under the FTCA only if they are \"susceptible to policy judgment\" and involve an exercise of \"political, social, \[or\] economic judgment.\" ... Only discretionary actions of greater significance\--those grounded in \"social, economic, or political goals\"\--fall within the protection of the statute."

- Sovereign Immunity: ***Cope v. Scott***

  - FTCA case

  - Rock Creek parkway accident

  - Plaintiff made allegations that road was not properly maintained

  - 2 issues with road safety/maintenance:

    - Road Signs

      - Not specified directive 🡪 don't have to do it; there also were "some" signs

      - Public Policy: not a big deal; aesthetic concerns; engineering concerns

    - Road Maintenance

      - Manuals prescribing safety conditions = not enough

      - Public policy: too big a project to fix the roads all at once; there were something like 60 road concerns to fix and this stretch was low on the list of priorities; not #1 priority

  - Policy concerns underlying judgment:

    - Don't want to second-guess policy-makers

    - Courts reluctant to deal with issues of limited resources and how they're allocated. (Judges, not "experts")

    - Don't want to undermine "democracy" (i.e. judgment of publically elected officials)

- Sovereign Immunity: ***Riss v. City of New York***

  - A rejected suitor terrorized appellant by threatening to have appellant killed or maimed if she did not date him. In fear for her life, appellant went to respondent city\'s police for protection, which was refused. After appellant became engaged to another man, the rejected suitor hired someone to throw lye in appellant\'s face. Consequently, appellant was blind in one eye, lost a portion of her vision in the other eye, and her face was permanently scarred. Appellant sued respondent for its failure to protect her from harm. The lower court dismissed appellant\'s complaint. The appellate division affirmed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that there was no warrant in judicial tradition or in the proper allocation of the powers of government for the courts, in absence of legislation, to carve out an area of tort liability for respondent\'s failure to provide police protection to appellant or other members of the public.

  - Court here concerned about second-guessing the police

  - "police" vs. other public services (hospital, transport, roads)

    - No duty to provide protection no matter what because protection provided is limited by resources of community; Also, only legislature can decide police isn't immune.

      - Legislation already there but police not included

      - E.g. Good Samaritan Statute, Crime Victim's compensation, etc.

## Coase Theorem

Calabresi talks about the Coase Theorem in great depth within the context of discussing two aims of tort law -- Compensation and Deterrence. Abraham covers this [on p.]{.mark}

- Compensation and Deterrence

+----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Compensation**                 | **Deterrence**                                                                                        |
+----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| - Loss-spreading                 | - "specific" (regulatory?)                                                                            |
+----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| - Wealth (re)distribution        | - "general" (price/tax)                                                                               |
|                                  |                                                                                                       |
|                                  | - Paying more for your bad behavior/habits so as to deter you (smoking taxes; higher insurance rates) |
+==================================+=======================================================================================================+

- General Deterrence Exercise (Coase Theorem)

  - Factory directly affecting school through its pollution

    - Harm = \$100, Factory making \$90

    - Shifting harm to the factory would lead to -\$10 net profits for continuing harmful activity, so factory will find a way to reduce or stop the harm.

  - Factors impacting deterrence: 1) Care levels; 2) Activity Levels

  - Advantages of price mechanism instead of mandates?

    - Even if harm/cost is less to affected party, we still may want to impact the factory.

    - You allow people to make their own choice, without forcing it.

  - No matter where you put the liability (on factory, school, product purchaser, etc.), you get the same outcome -- greater safety or protection from harm

  - Problems?

    - Motivations of people = variant

    - Transaction costs? (search, information, etc.)

  - Requirements of Coase Theorem

    - No transaction costs

    - Not about distribution of costs

    - CCA = cheapest cost avoider = "Best Briber"

## Act v. Omission

- **Eckert v. LIRR**

  - Baby on tracks scenario\
    Court found that "the law has so high a regard for human life that it will not impute negligence on an effort to preserve it, unless made under such circumstance as to constitute rashness in the judgment of prudent persons." This is true of rescuing people, not property. **Danger invites rescue**.

- Act = "can" be liable

- Omission = Not liable

- Continuous act = fold omission into an act to prove liability

  - **Moch** (p. 175, Cardozo opinion)

    - Moch Co. v. Rensselaer Water - hard to not find liability if it's based on foreseeability. Why no duty? McPherson -- privity is not essential in tort.

    - Contract part -- what can we see about the intentions regarding allocation of risk?

    - Tort part -- becoming an instrument of harm v. failing to be a remedy for harm.

    - "undertaking" = earlier act created reliance

- Act/Omission: 3 Moves (Things you can do to prove liability -- prove it was an act)

  - "actively" omit -- proving defendant made an active omission

    - Test for situations where omission can be described as an act

    - "but-for" causation

  - Earlier act created risk

    - "negligence"

  - Earlier act created reliance

    - Discouraged aid/self-help (example of starting to save baby but stopping at last moment)

    - "undertaking"

    - Maybe works if you think of it in terms of "but for" causation

- **Harper v. Herman**

  - The guest was injured when he dove off the owner\'s boat into shallow water. The guest filed a personal injury action against the owner, claiming that the owner negligently failed to warn him about the shallow water. The court held that an affirmative duty to act arose only when a special relationship existed between the parties. The court determined that no special relationship existed between the owner and the guest, so the owner had no duty to warn the guest about the shallow water. The court ruled that the owner\'s actual knowledge of the dangerous condition, in the absence of a duty to provide protection, was insufficient to establish liability in negligence. The court held that the guest had no reasonable expectation to look to the owner for protection, and the owner had no duty to warn the guest that the water was shallow.

# Damages

## Functions of Damages

- Achieving **corrective justice** or providing **civil recourse** by compensation for losses resulting from tortious act

- Promoting **deterrence** by threatening liability for costs of tortious acts

- Recognizing the social and individual signification of less

## Compensatory Damages

- general rule is that successful plaintiff is **entitled to be made "whole"** by recovering damages to compensate for losses proximately resulting from tortious act or omission.

- For property this is loss in value or cost to repair. Consequential losses such as diminished profits can be reimbursed too.

- Bodily injury case:

  - The "**special**" or out-of-pocket losses proximately resulting from tortious act, including lost earnings

  - "**General**" damages for non-economic losses, often referred to as "pain and suffering" but also includes all other intangible losses (disfigurement, loss of enjoyment)

<!-- -->

- **Proof of damages**: Plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she has suffered or will in the future suffer, the losses for which she claims damage.

- Principle of a **Single Recovery**: Compensation for Both Past and Future Loss

  - Advantages - Case does not go on forever. There is beneficial closure on both sides and for the legal system. Plaintiff has incentive to get better, defendant can plan past this financial requirement and court can butt out, saving litigation costs.

  - Disadvantages -- less accuracy in estimating future damages. Periodic awards will be more accurate. Plaintiff must be a good investor to cover future damages (which are discounted per the assumption that the award will grow over time).

  - **Discounting Awards to Present Value** -- Single recovery requires jury to discount award to present value because of time value of money. Requires two steps, 1) estimate plaintiff's total future loss, perhaps by year, and 2) since juries are meant not to overcompensate, amount of future loss must then be discounted to the present value (reduced to a sum which, if invested, will equal the total amount of future loss at the time it occurs.)

  - Must determine what discount rate to use, inflation v. pure rate of interest.

  - Implications:

    - Courts that do not have uniform rules regarding discounting practices usually means that parties will invest in expert testimony regarding the correct rate of discount which can seem to be a waste with inconsistent results.

    - Plaintiff must be at least an average investor to make this work.

<!-- -->

- **Inchoate and Future Loss**

  - There is no independent cause of action for losses that have not yet occurred. Tangible loss must take place first and then compensation for all future loss that will more probably than not occur is available.

  - Fact that plaintiff will more probably than not suffer some loss in the future is not enough, usually. Occasional award of medical monitoring when defendant has exposed plaintiff to risk of suffering future injury like cancer.

<!-- -->

- **Pain and Suffering Awards**

  - The Function of the Award

    - When there is serious injury, compensation for purely out of pocket expenses do not seem to make the plaintiff whole again. Pain and suffering acknowledges the wrong done and the fact that there are intangible losses. Perhaps creates some consolation.

    - Pain and suffering can provide enjoyments that substitute for those lost as a result of the injury.

    - Pain and suffering is a consequence that the law aims to deter optimally. But for this, it doesn't matter if defendant pays to plaintiff or some other entity.

    - Practical reason -- attorney's fees. Might make more sense to treat attorney's fees as a separate item.

  - Limitations on Awards

    - Unpredictable and inconsistent pain and suffering damages create over deterrence.

    - Most functions of pain and suffering awards can be served even with the implementation of limits.

    - **Remittitur** -- permitting the court to reduce or limit jury awards. When award is too high, court gives plaintiff choice of reduced award or new trial. (ad hoc -- court will only apply in extreme circumstances)

    - **Additur** -- when award is too low, opposite offer is given to the defendant to increase award or have a new trial. (ad hoc -- court will only apply in extreme circumstances)

    - About half the states have put a ceiling on pain and suffering, usually around \$250,000. Some ceilings are universal while others only apply to certain types of cases. This is unfair to young and seriously injured persons who would get more in pain and suffering while those who would have gotten less are not affected.

    - Solution to above problem might be a schedule of awards to exact a toll on all awards, instead of just those that are limited by the ceiling. This is much more fair but also less workable.

<!-- -->

- Pain and Suffering for Property Damage?

  - Pain and suffering damages are not recoverable in cases involving property damage.

  - Abraham thinks this black letter rule might start to give way over time.

  - Some states have passed legislation allowing up to \$5000 in specific cases such as pet deaths.

## Collateral Sources and Benefits

whether payment of insurance is taken into account when awarding damages can make a large difference. Evidence of collateral payments/benefits are not admissible in plaintiff's tort action against defendant. This means plaintiff can prove losses and recover for them even if they have already been covered.

- The "**Rewarding Prudence**" Argument for the Rule

  - Plaintiff who has invested in insurance should not be penalized for his prudence.

  - Mitigation through insurance is not penalization; it is compensatory which means double recovery is a windfall for the plaintiff. But, if taken into account then the defendant gets a windfall.

  - But this creates deterrence for defendants. And incentives to get insurance.

- The "**Preventing Double Recovery**" Argument against the Rule

  - Recover once from insurer and once from defendant. This violates the principle underlying damages.

  - Collateral source rule resolves tension in favor of optimal deterrence even if that means overcompensation in some instances.

  - Also, contingent fee system reduces the value of award actually received by plaintiff.

- The **Subrogation Solution**

  - Usually, plaintiff pays insurance company back for amount of the benefits paid by company. Under this system both purposes of the law are achieved.

  - Subrogation occurs under terms of insurance contract, except for life insurance. Subrogation gives insurer right to step into the plaintiff's shoes to the extent of the payment made by the insurer to plaintiff.

  - Any extra award would go to plaintiff.

  - Insurers right to subrogation usually transferred into a right to recovery since a suit is already in process. Indemnification.

  - While this rule negates many of the cons of collateral sources, often in practice it does not actually happen due to the time lapse between when insurance is usually paid to plaintiff and when awards are paid years later.

  - Also frequent use of settlements for less than the whole amount of damages creates problems with reimbursing insurance companies. Some states have created rules regarding how to do this.

  - There is also a problem with future medical expenses that insurance presumably covers even though plaintiff has been award future expenses damages.

  - Some states have begun to partially or completely eliminate collateral sources rules. Some direct a reduction in award; others make evidence of collateral payments admissible. Problems arise with discounting awards for future collateral payments.

## Punitive Damages

- In exceptional cases there is the possibility of punishment damages.

- Known as punitive or exemplary damages.

- Threat of these damages has more impact than the small percentage of cases in which they are actually awarded.

- Usually behavior that is more blameworthy than gross negligence is necessary for punitive damages. Some states limit punitive damages.

- SCOTUS factors regarding constitutionality of punitive damages:

  - Degree of reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct (judgment call)

  - Disparity or proportion between the harm or potential harm resulting from defendant's conduct and the amount of compensatory damages awarded (**State Farm v. Campbell** -- few awards in which there was more than a single-digit ratio would satisfy due process, i.e. if more than 9 times more than compensatory damages, punitive damages are unconstitutional)

  - Difference between this remedy and the civil or criminal penalties authorized to punish defendants in comparable cases (judgment call)

# Affirmative and Limited Duties

Obligation to take some action or refrain from taking some action, which is a question of law (although breach is a matter of fact). There can sometimes be a general duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid injuring the plaintiff, which means that duty is usually pretty obvious but there are some classes of cases where it is not as clear. There is no general duty not to be negligent, no general duty to exercise reasonable care -- only particular duties to exercise reasonable care based on pre-existing relationships and knowledge of risks of harm.

## Affirmative v. Limited duties

- **Affirmative** -- defendant's conduct does not negligently create a risk of physical harm to the plaintiff but the plaintiff is independently at risk and the defendant might, through the exercise of reasonable care, eliminate or reduce the risk of harm. Does the defendant have an affirmative duty to do so? (nonfeasance).

- **Limited** -- defendant's conduct foreseeably creates an unreasonable risk of harming the plaintiff. (misfeasance). Premises liability, pure emotional and pure economic harm.

- List of factors courts will use when finding duty:

  - Foreseeability of harm

  - Closeness of the connection between defendant's conduct and the harm suffered by plaintiff

  - Moral blame attached to the defendant's conduct

  - Extent of the burden on the defendant and the consequences for the community if a duty is imposed

  - Policy of preventing future harm

  - The availability and prevalence of insurance that is or would be available if a duty is imposed

## Special Relationships

- When there is a special relationship, there is an exception to the general rule that there is no affirmative duty to rescue or protect plaintiff from harm.

- Common carriers and innkeepers with their customers, Parents or custodians with children, (**Andrews v. United Airlines, Hines v. Garrett**)

- Special relationships usually involves dependence by the plaintiff on the defendant, in which case defendant has waived the right to mind their own business and has undertaken a duty to protect.

- Mental health professionals -- **Tarasoff v. Regents of U of C.** -- when the patient makes a threat, there is a duty to protect the patient and those specific third parties he threatens. Highly contested rule but this duty is supposed to be carefully and narrowly circumscribed. 2 sets of relationships. Why is there a relationship/duty between doctor and Tarasoff? Medicine prescription (increases harm, misfeasance) v. mental health (doesn't increase likelihood of harm, non-feasance). Ds could be liable and P can amend complaint.

# Torts and Their Elements

- **Negligence:**

  - Duty

  - Breach of Duty

  - Cause In Fact

  - Proximate Cause

  - Damages

- **Strict Liability:**

  - Absolute duty to make safe

  - Actual and proximate cause

  - Damages

- **Trespass:**

  - Entry

  - \$ damages 🡪 What's the remedy?

  - Harm? (not necessarily linked to damages; can get nominal damages without harm)

  - Care/Fault? (Doesn't matter)

  - Intent? (Have to intend entry, not nec. intend to trespass; very low threshold of proof)

- **Nuisance:**

  - Using and enjoying property; not necessarily about [entry]{.underline}

  - What about [harm]{.underline}?

    - Has to be shown (invasion of use and enjoyment; have to prove that it's intuitive)

  - Intent?

    - Not necessary (see Section 822, Restatement)

      - Intentional and unreasonable; or

      - Unintentional and arising out of negligent or reckless conduct or abnormally dangerous conditions or activities

- **Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress:**

  - "Pure" emotional loss: not the result of a negligently caused physical injury

    - [Independent duty]{.underline} -- failure to exercise reasonable care causes another person emotional distress

      - Not common, but there are two exceptions:

        - 1\. When a D negligently mishandles the corpse of a loved one

        - 2\. When a D negligently sends a telegram to the P that incorrectly announces the death of a loved one (extended to include a Dr. misinforming the P that he has an STD)

    - [Derivative duty]{.underline} -- failure to exercise reasonable care to avoid causing physical injury does not result in physical injury to the P, but does result in emotional distress, either because the person whose physical safety was risked by the D suffers emotional distress or some third party suffers such distress

      - E.g. A car negligently hits a baby, but does not cause injury to the mother. The mother suffers emotional distress as a result

    - Exceptions to no duty:

      - Impact Rule -- Recovery permitted only if D's conduct resulted in some sort of physical symptom on the P's body (e.g. P vomited); replaced by ZDR

      - Zone of Danger Rule -- Even if no physical harm, if P w/in the "zone" where physical injury could have occurred, and feared for his/her own safety, then P can recover

      - *Dillon* Rule -- Proximity, visibility, and relationship (the greater these things, the more foreseeable the possibility of emotional harm)

- **Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress:**

  - Defendant acted intentionally or recklessly; and

  - Defendant's conduct was extreme and outrageous; and

  - Defendant's act is the cause of the distress; and

  - Plaintiff suffers severe emotional distress as a result of defendant's conduct
