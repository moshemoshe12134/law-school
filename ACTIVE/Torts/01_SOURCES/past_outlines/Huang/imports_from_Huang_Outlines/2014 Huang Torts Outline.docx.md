a.  **[Big Questions in Torts]{.underline}**

- Judges v. Jury?

- Rules v. Standards?

- Who decides? (pg. 26)

- Legislature v. Courts? (pg. 28)

- Symmetry btw P and D?

  - Joint and Several Liability that spreads costs of insolvent D's on both P and D

  - Calabresi: weigh B=PL considering costs and benefits to everyone

**b. [Rules v. Standards\]{.underline}**

- Consistency easier to achieve • Good for fact-important situations

- Good for one-off cases (**[Strauss]{.underline}**) • Politically less dangerous for elected judges\
  to leave these decisions up to jury

- Once and for all decision

- Ignores facts of the case •Same types of cases could "oscillate to and fro"

> •susceptible to judicial and jury discretion

- Rigid/arbitrary • costly to litigate over details![](media/image6.png){width="0.375in" height="2.7777777777777776e-2in"}

- Easy to alter actions to dodge • inconsistent rulings since subjective to facts\*

(Safety of overhead bins, **[Andrews]{.underline}**) (Emergency doctrine situations)**[\]{.underline}**

> **[Principles:]{.underline}** provides guidance, don't solve legal issues

- **Reasonable Person Standard:** If you let courts tailor to sex, can lead to conflict. Reasonable person should take more care w/ woman who can't jump from trains (**[Clegg]{.underline}**) but reasonable woman should know better than to drive (**[Tankersly]{.underline}**)

  - [ citing the Restatement of Torts 2d, defines a reasonable person as "someone who uses such qualities as attention, knowledge, intelligence and judgment which a society requires of its members to protect their own interests and the interests of others"]{.mark}

- **Standards:**

  - **Proximate Cause**: (subjective questions of what's F, Cardozo v. Andrews, pgs. 15-16)

  - **Superseding Causes**: broadly speaking, superseding causes interrupt causal chain if harm that occurred was totally unF. But note the discrepancy that then occurs (pg. 17o)

- **Rules:**

- **Tedla v. Ellman:** statue doesn't apply well, following vehicle statute causes **more** harm.

- **[Rule changed to Standard]{.underline}:** w/ permanent injunctions for patent infringement (pg. 29) **[\]{.underline}**

- **[Rules v. Standard]{.underline}:**

  - **[Pokora]{.underline}:** (killed driving on train tracks, shouldn't stop/see)

<!-- -->

- **Standard:** Whether P should've gotten out of car is a question of situational facts.

- **Jury:** Cardozo said jury should decide what is reasonable**.** Rules are too rigid.

  - **[Baltimore RR]{.underline}:** (husband killed by train while driving over tracks)

- **Rule:** You must stop, get out of car, and look for trains.

- **Judge:** Holmes said judge should decide as rule of law. Reasonable care means get out of car and listen for trains

**c. [Aims of Tort Law\]{.underline}**

1.  **Fairness / morality**

2.  **Incentives / Deterrence / Perverse Incentives** - optimal levels

3.  **Costs / Social welfare**

4.  **Loss distribution** -- who should bear the cost of injury?

5.  **Compensation** -- for those who suffer

6.  **Administrative Concerns** (can court handle it?)

7.  **Too Speculative**

8.  **Limited Resources**

**\
e. [Judge v. Jury & Courts v. Legislature]{.underline}**

- **Judges:** Decide matters of statute and questions where "reasonable people could not disagree"

<!-- -->

- Consistency

- Knows the rules to apply

- Common law is more **fair** since based off real cases and facts

<!-- -->

- **Juries:** Decide questions of fact, where "reasonable people could disagree" 🡪 rules on directed verdict. However here it's saying that the jury "should not" find any different. Fair?

<!-- -->

- More flexible

<!-- -->

- Influenced by prejudice and passion

- Amateurish nature

<!-- -->

- **Legislature:** more **fair** since closer to ground and we've elected them

<!-- -->

- **Cardozo**: legislature is fairer than common law, if directly relates to case facts (**[Herzog]{.underline}**, buggy had lights off)

<!-- -->

- Not up to jury to decide if statute was violated.

<!-- -->

- **[Judge v. Jury]{.underline}:**

  - **[Pokora]{.underline}:** (killed driving on train tracks, shouldn't stop/see) overturns Baltimore RR

<!-- -->

- **Standard:** Whether P should've gotten out of car is a question of situational facts.

- **Jury:** Cardozo said jury should decide what is reasonable**.** Rules are too rigid.

  - **[Baltimore RR]{.underline}:** (husband killed by train while driving over tracks)

- **Rule:** You must stop, get out of car, and look for trains.

- **Judge:** Holmes said judge should decide as rule of law. Reasonable care means get out of car and listen for train.

<!-- -->

- **[Who Decides btw CN or Comp N?]{.underline}** : Courts v. Legislature

  - Li v. Yellow Cab Co. court thought CN "all or nothing" was too strict.

  - **Did court have a right to decide?**

    - Legislature passed Civil Code 1715 saying D is liable "except so far as" P is too. Leg didn't *intend* to bar courts from altering, just wanted to codify for 'consistency's sake.' (Says the Court)

  - Could have just reinterpreted Civil Code to mean Comp N, but has been CN for so long that wanted to change the whole thing for consistency.

  - **Potential issues**:

    - What to do w/ last clear chance rule? (Get rid of it.)

    - What to do w/ multiple D's? And if not all there?

    - What to do w/ willful/wanton misconduct? (Leave up to trial court.)

  - **Pro-Courts**:

    - Can take baby steps as issues arise, rather than all at once

    - Bases decisions on practice facts rather than theoretical realm of Legislature

      - Ex, how they dealt with potential issues above

    - B/c based on issues ex poste, legitimizes the decisions that are made

  - **Pro-Legislature:**

    - More time and staff to analyze potential effects

    - Solves the issue once and for all in a thorough manner

    - Potentially more legitimate

    - We've elected them to do this kind of analysis 🡪 likely to accept results

- **[Courts v. Legislature]{.underline}**:

  - Should court extend or apply laws regarding conversion and trespass to chattels? (pg. 28)

- **[Judge & Jury, regarding Proximate Cause:]{.underline}**

  - Few extreme cases ask whether D's N was a proximate cause of P's harm as a matter of law. In these cases, finding D N of breaking a **rule** is enough to show proximate cause.

    - Ex: run a red light, causing an accident? If so, PC is found w/out going to jury.

    - Ex: thin-skull rule

  - Most cases, however, are not so clear, and go to jury.

  - **[Palsgraf]{.underline}** did not go to the jury

  - **[Wagon Mound]{.underline}** was decided by judge as a matter of law

***\
Res ipsa loquitur*** ultimately decided by jury. **[Byrne v. Boadle]{.mark}:** (barrel of flour fell from window and knocked P in the head) jury gets facts and decides if D was at fault.

**Decided Before Incident:** statutes (legislature), regulations (agencies), precedent (judges)

**Decided After Incident:** specific rulings (judges and juries)

**f. [Moral Luck]{.underline}**: If lots of people are N, why do we only punish those who's N causes injury? Why do we need causation? On the other hand, is it fair to fine everyone who is N, even if they don't hurt anyone?

- **For causation:**

  - D shouldn't have to pay for a harm he didn't cause (pay everyone on a street you speed down)

  - Could dry D's coffers before an actual accident

  - Even if you pay P now she could spend it before she needs it

  - **Admin costs**: impractical to administer

- **Against needing causation:**

  - **Fairness**: those who're N but **by luck** don't hurt anyone are just as N as those who do

**g. [Theories (Calabresi, Coase Theorum)]{.underline}**

**[CALABRESI]{.underline}**: "Cheapest Cost Avoider" -- joins law and economics

1.  **Compensation Goals:**

- Total impact of injury can be diminished w/ proper allocation of cost.

- If compensation is the only goal, **don't need causal link**.

- Could use:

  a.  **Social Spreading:**

<!-- -->

- Could use social insurance, raised through taxes, to spread accident costs

- **Goals Served**: spreading costs to society

- **Proximate Cause:** could be a limitation, select best spreader out of the group of proximate actors.

  a.  **"Deep Pockets" / Wealth Distribution**: How do you justify it? Juries might do it already

<!-- -->

- Put costs on Warren Buffet

- **Goals Served**:

  - Fairness: burden on those able to bear it easiest

  - Deterrence: b/c they have most power and influence, able to make changes

2.  **Deterrence Goals:**

- Seek to minimize sum of injury costs + safety costs, creating incentives to avoid future injuries

- If deterrence was only goal, **causal linkage would be the most crucial**, b/c no reason to restrict behavior that didn't/wont cause the injury

- Could use:

  a.  **Regulatory/Specific Deterrence:**

<!-- -->

- Safety Costs

- Punish people for N even if harm isn't caused, regulating a dangerous activity as a whole (don't need causation)

- Only punish if causing a harm is F, otherwise wont do any good at deterring

- But is it efficient to modify *all* related activities?

  a.  **Market/General Deterrence:**

<!-- -->

- Injury Costs

- Only tax people once a harm is caused (rests on causation)

- Saves causation and proximate cause

- **Cheapest cost avoider!**

  - Places burden on those who can best decide whether avoidance is cheaper than bearing costs.

  - Burden will create incentive to avoid those injuries worth avoiding

  - B = PL!

![](media/image11.png){width="7.260416666666667in" height="2.6354166666666665in"}

**[CALABRESI]{.underline}**: "Cost of Accidents"

- B = PL sometimes allows for hurting people. We don't totally agree or we'd allow very lucrative prostitution.

- We often ignore "the market" (B = PL) in light of what is best for society as a whole

  - **Ex**: See Drawing Page

- General \> Specific Deterrence

  - General identifies the person who *should* bear the cost, not just tax everyone

  - Costs change quickly, regulatory specific deterrence couldn't keep up

  - Huge transaction costs of specific deterrence to update information, not as responsive

**[COASE THEORUM]{.underline}**: See Drawing Page

**To Structure this Section:**

1.  Calabresi's Two Goals of Tort Law 🡪 General Deterrence gets us to Cheapest Cost Avoider

2.  Coase: It doesn't matter! We'll get to the same precaution in the end!

3.  Problems with Coase: ignores transaction costs and compensation goals.

4.  How does law help get to the lowest cost option?

- Law shifts liability onto those w/ lowest transaction costs, most information, most able to prevent action (w/ ideas like duty and last shot rule): **Best Briber**

- Best Briber will maximize chances that errors in marketplace will be corrected

- Sometimes it's easier to find the Best Briber than the Cheapest Cost Avoider

**[2. ELEMENTS OF A TORT (breach of some duty that causes an injury)]{.smallcaps}**

a.  **[DUTY]{.underline}**

<!-- -->

i.  **Reasonable Care Standard**: We have a duty to avoid acting unreasonably in a way that foreseeably poses risks to others. Only liable for unintentional harm if it was foreseeable (**[Bethel; Adams v Bulloch]{.underline}**).

- **Objective Standard:** No differentiating among people.

<!-- -->

- **Fair and reduces administrative costs**. (*But do we want to account for some of the below factors? Do we want more/less duty sometimes? Is that **fairer**?*) (Rules v. Standards)

<!-- -->

- **Conduct, not mindset**

- **Foreseeability**: not liable for freak accidents (not random wire, **[Adams]{.underline}**)

- **Ordinary Care:** only have to show ordinary care, not extraordinary (**[Brown]{.underline}**)

- **Burden of proof:** P must show D's lack of ordinary care (**[Brown]{.underline}**)

> **[Should we consider]{.underline}:**

- **Mental Ability** -- Too subjective, not a factor to consider

  - *[Evidentiary issue 🡺hard to prove that this is the case. Also we expect people to act like reasonable people regardless of their mental infirmities...if you know you have issues, you are negligent in not taking precautions to keep you from cutting up (again a scoping of the "under the circumstances"]{.underline}*

- **Physical Disability** --

  - **Physical Disabilities are taken into account if you can show them in court...the jury will be instructed to use this in a semi objective standard...can cut both ways as you frame how the person should have acted prior to the accident**

  - *[This can and likely will cut both ways however, once the situation is framed for the jury. A person who has a physical defect might need to be even more cautious under the circumstances to never end up in the situation that has brought them to court, but also a person who has a physical disability might not be able to do anymore and the reasobale care he shows leads to some injury. (some injuries are not worth avoiding/some risks are worth taking🡺BPL)]{.underline}*

- **Sex**: reasonable person take more care with woman who can't jump from trains (**[Clegg]{.underline}**) but reasonable woman should know better than to drive (**[Tankersly]{.underline}**)

- **Emergency Doctrine**: if emergency that is not of the defendant's doing, only have to exhibit an 'honest exercise of judgment.' Because of the unforeseeability of the circumstances in this situation, asking for prudence in the ex-post is unfair. (car accident, **Levey**) NOT ANYMORE - "reasonable care" under the circumstances is broad/flexible enough to consider this.

  - even though "under the circumstances" may be sufficient to cover this, a defendant may want to argue for this extra instruction to the jury as a way to help more narrowly frame the situation that brought forth the harm.

- **[Children: (see reasonable care/negligence below)]{.mark}**

<!-- -->

- Not liable under age of 4 or 7 in some states(**fair cut off?**); presumably because children this young cannot exercise care at all.

- Otherwise, held to standards of reasonable children their age (intelligence, experience, etc)🡪semi-objective standard. But a child of unusual or superior intelligence will likely be required to excersise such care (much like the superior attributes that are supposed to be excercised by other folks)

  - If the child is too young and acting negligent the liability often kicks over to the parent for failure to supervise.

- *[If child is engaging in adult activity, compare to reasonable adult (**Dellwo**). No way to know that the pilot of a plane is a kid (opposite of Clegg). In Goss v. Allen, the court ruled as a matter of Law that skiing is a sport for everyone so a Kid did not have to get jammed with the adult standard of reasonableness for the accident.]{.underline}*

  - Effectively an exercise in scoping the circumstances of what a reasonable person should do.

<!-- -->

- **Superior Attributes:** § 289 (b) of the Restatement says that defendant, must also exercise superior attributes that he has.

  - We normally want people to do their best and provide their talents to a situation, a reasonable person would do these things. Asymmetrical, however, to the mental infirmities.

- **Common carriers:** no longer need highest degree of care, just reasonable (**[Beth]{.underline}**el)

  - Shift from SL for common carriers because they are not dangerous as they were back in the day...We don't want common carriers taking people around less so we don't want to hold them to this SL standard.

ii. **Highest Degree of Care**

- Gun Cases🡺Wood v Groh

  - Plaintiff is owed the highest degree of care in safekeeping a handgun. Simply locking the box won't get it done, rather you need to keep the bullets and the gun separate and make the box unreachable by minors

    - *[A circumstance where the parents were sued for the malfeasance of their kid (although the kid was 15 at the time of the accident)]{.mark}*

iii. **Affirmative Duty/Nonfeasance (Duty to act)**: When D's conduct doesn't *negligently create a risk of harm* but that P is independently at risk and D might, through reasonable care, be able to *reduce or eliminate* it. Does he have an affirmative duty to do so? Generally speaking there are no affirmative duties to do anything but there are exceptions to this rule:

> **Duty🡺**is a question of Law and the jury decides if there has been a breach of said duty based on the facts.

- **When determining whether there is an affirmative duty to act, [Balance these factors (especially as it relates to a 3^rd^ party) (Tarasoff):]{.underline}**

<!-- -->

- Foreseeability of harm (Tarasoff court says is most important)

- Closeness of connection btw D's conduct and P's injury

- Moral blame attached to D's conduct

- Extent of burden on D & consequences to community of duty is imposed (ConEd, **[Strauss]{.underline}**)

- Policy of preventing future harm

- Availability and prevalence of insurance if duty's imposed

<!-- -->

- **2^nd^ Restatement:**

1.  If actor knows or should FORESEE that his actions, N or innocent, would put others in potentially harmful situation, actor has a duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent such harm. (Leaving drunk kid in car)

- **Duty to Rescue because of Misfeasance** **(** act **)** -- If you Negligently create a risk you have to rescue P

<!-- -->

- **Ex**: move baby out of RR tracks, but put it on hill and it rolls

- **Earlier act created risk** (2 ft. of water, **[Harper]{.underline}**)

- **Sounds like N**

- [If you START, you have to FOLLOW THROUGH in a non-negligent manner or you would be liable for a negligent rescue; Once you have undertaken the rescue, the duty is to not be negligent with it.]{.mark}

  - The question to ask is whether the wrongdoer has advanced to such a point as to have launched a force or instrument of harm or has stopped where inaction is at most a refusal to become an instrument of harm? (when there may be a duty to act re: some activities already undertaken.)

<!-- -->

- **Feasance** -- folding omission into act

<!-- -->

- **Reliance** created by earlier act (discouraging aid & self-help)

  - Once you start rescuing, others may fall back.

- **Non-Nly create risk --** (truck stalling, **[Moch]{.underline}**)

<!-- -->

- Especially when risk is "characteristic" of the activity

- **Sounds like "but for" causation**

<!-- -->

- Perverse incentive, pple wont even try to help. Is that better?

<!-- -->

- **Special Relationship🡺creating dependence by the Plaintiff**

<!-- -->

- Parental relationships

- Common Carriers and innkeepers

- **Police**, when (1) assumption through promises, (2) knowledge that inaction could lead to harm, (3) direct contact w/ victim, (4) victim's justifiable reliance (**[Cuffy]{.underline}**)

- **Surrogate parent/custodial role**

<!-- -->

- **Duty to Warn:**

1.  **Created the risk:** once you have created the danger that the P may fall into, you have a duty to warn them about the danger (possibly rescue🡪see above)

2.  **Therapists:** duty to warn when patient makes serious threat of violence against a reasonably identifiable victim (Civil Code §43.92 in response to **[Tarasoff]{.underline}**)

3.  **Manufacturers:** medtronics-hood

4.  **Child abuse:** ALWAYS report

5.  **Doctors:** side effects of drugs to patient.

- Unless special relationship w/ dangerous person or potential victim AND victim is foreseeable (**[Tarasoff]{.underline}**)

<!-- -->

- **Confidentiality**: encourage info-exchange, false positive, defamatory, waste resources, discourage necessary trust, discourage treatment (**[Tarasoff]{.underline}**)

<!-- -->

- **[Affirmative Duty?  Warnings, Products Liability]{.mark}**

> Duties to warn as it relates to products and their potential harms comes from a desire to transfer risk-utility information to the purchaser and thereby to put the purchaser in a position to decide whether the risks posed by the product design are worth the benefits associated.
>
> The Restatement Third of Torts refers to unavoidable risks associated with certain products and declines to impose liability for the injuries that result after an adequate warning of the risk of those injuries has been given.
>
> Adequacy of the Warning

- What is required is an adequate warning or instruction typically of foreseeable risks

  - Not SL since the adequacy of the warnings will take into account the feasibility and cost of providing a warning as well as the kind of information that purchasers want to read

- Label Clutter🡺refers to the problem of having too many labels where people will not take seriously the labels, or they are confusing, or broadly diminishing returns on labels...

- Causation Issue: Much like Informed consent, the Plaintiff must prove that the lack of warnings was a "but-for" cause of the Plaintiff using the product (in the manner that caused the injury)

  - Heeded Presumption: some jurisdictions have created this legal fiction that shows that someone would have heeded the warning had it been adequate as a way to soften the hurdle that causation may bring.

> Hood v Ryobi
>
> Here the court rules as a matter of law that the warnings placed by the company on the mider saw were such that Plaintiff should have known the risks associated with the activities. Plaintiff attempted to argue that because the warnings were vague and not specific to the saw jumping off the track (as opposed to P's presumption of cut clothing or fingers) that the warning was inadequate. *[Maryland does not require an encyclopedia of warnings but simply be reasonable under the circumstances. A clear and specific warning is usually sufficient.]{.underline}*
>
> **Duty to report to a third Party**

- Medtronic

  - Arizona law provides that there is an affirmative duty to report to a third party notice of defect in the product, if such reporting would provide reasonable assurance that the information would reach the people who would be harmed by not having the information.

  - Medtronic case is one of Federal Preemption, where Medtronic argues that the Federal MDA statute provides that state tort claims are preempted.

  - Court holds that, in the event that the state law duties (and therefore the cognizable claims) parallel that of the Federal laws, there is no preemption.

<!-- -->

- **Federal Torts Claim Act**: when govn't employees are liable

<!-- -->

- Negligent

- Discretionary Functions, liable (exceptions, see below)

> Cuyler Case:

- Simply because a federal statute creates a criminal liability, there is not necessarily a tort remedy at play as well, unless the tort is cognizable in tort law already, or the statute expressly calls for civil remedies.

<!-- -->

- **"Pure" emotional harm:** Nly inflicted emotional distress that isn't the result of Nly caused physical injury.

<!-- -->

- **[Derivative Duty]{.underline}**

<!-- -->

- **Impact Rule:** Liable if emotional loss resulted in physical impact on P's body

- **Zone of Danger:** Liable if P was in "ZONE" in which physical injury was threatened, have to prove physical symptoms.

<!-- -->

- Ex: Fear caused by car coming at you, when causes bodily harm (**[Falzone]{.underline}**)

- Asbestos dust is not enough of physical impact (**[MTA]{.underline}**)

<!-- -->

- **The *Dillon* Rule:** Weigh (1) proximity to scene (2) visibility and (3) relationship

- **Ex**: someone else put baby on hill and it rolls

- **Active omission** (stepping out of way of stroller to tie shoe)

- "Denial of a benefit, not commission of a wrong." -- Cardozo in **[Moch]{.underline}**

- Regardless of whether cost to D of rescuing P is small (throwing life vest)

- **Rule** \> **Standard** here to make duty clear, but has poor consequences!

- **BLURRY LINE!** What would reasonable person do?

<!-- -->

- **Public Policy** -- when holding duty would impose huge burden on *important,* *societal* (not BP), *monopolizing* entity (like ConEd, **[Strauss]{.underline}**).

<!-- -->

- **Perverse incentives**: larger the company, less likely it's liable

<!-- -->

- **Infinite P's**: when it's hard to prove and so many potential P's (second hand asbestos)**\**

- **Privity of contract** -- when otherwise floodgates would open to infinite P's (Con Ed only liable to contracted building, **[Strauss]{.underline}**)**\**

- **Good Samaritan Rule**: to protect those who give emergency aid

- **Sovereign Immunity**: state/federal govn't used to be immune to give it leeway to make laws w/o conflicting concern for their liability. Now this is the exception. **\**

- **Govn't Officials Dealing w/ Discretionary Functions where:** (**[Cope v. Scott]{.underline}**)

1.  Specified action (rule, manual, code) employee should follow (rule)

2.  Act is "fraught w/ policy judgment," per Congress (standard).

- B/c they have to balance limited resources, judges might not know as much as govn't officials, govn't officials closer to democratic interests, pple vote for them based on how they perform. **\**

<!-- -->

- **Emergency/Rescue:** don't have to rescue, regardless of cost to you v. benefit to other

<!-- -->

- Some states (VT) make exceptions

<!-- -->

- **Police:** protected from liability (exceptions for special relationships, above)

<!-- -->

- Reasons to protect from liability (sorry about the lye, **[Riss]{.underline}**)

<!-- -->

- Limited resources, Court can't tell them how to allocate

- Legislature loosened restrictions on public trans. but not this for a reason

<!-- -->

- Does this make sense? "B/c we owe a duty to everyone, we owe duty to no one."

<!-- -->

- Fear of financial burden is a myth

- No predictable limitations is also a myth

- Wont be "crushing burden" since we have other limiting principles (proximate cause, F, fault)

- Courts *do* have power to review admin. practices.

<!-- -->

- **"Pure" emotional harm:** Negligently inflicted emotional distress that isn't the result of Nly caused physical injury.

1.  **Independent Duty:** failure to exercise reasonable care causes emotional distress

- NO DUTY, except mishandling a loved one's body.

<!-- -->

- Fear of fraud, floodgates, hard to make a standard

<!-- -->

- **"Pure" economic harm:** Nly created economic harm but **no** bodily or property damage

<!-- -->

- **Rarely ever allowed**

- Loss of income but no physical or property harm? Then too bad (**[Madison Ave]{.underline}**)

<!-- -->

- Floodgates (BP), huge burden/"urban chaos," too variable to get insurance, stunt progress, D already deterred from creating bodily harm, loss distribution can be spread already

> Economic Analysis of SL by Richard Posner:

- Whenever the damages exceed the cost of the deterring injury the D is likely to choose the precaution, even in a SL regime. But when the cost of damages is less than the precaution the SL tortfeasor will probably just pay the damages (not exactly the aim of the SL regime to deter activity levels)

- Courts usually don't say that an activity, even taken with all possible care is negligent. Ex: court won't assess values for driving to the grocery store vs going on a weekend roadtrip...the court looks at the level of care assoicated with your activity not the activity prima facie vis-à-vis the amount or reasoning.

  - This represents a pitfall of negligence

- SL however works to reduce activity levels deemed dangerous and therefore more activity would definitely necessiate more risk

  - Howver SL doesn't take into account plaintiffs here and their activity levels that bring forth injury

- Novel activities are often deemed dangerous until we learn about them (think Bethel) so attaching SL will presumably allow for cautious development of expertise

  - However some activities like explosives and wild animals will likely always be in the SL regime.

- Judicial Efficiency:

  - Will make tort claims easier through eliinating Negligence *but* will also encourage more claims. So while easier, may have more volume

- Insurance:

  - Its cheaper for the D's to self insure than for the plaintiffs to have to find releif throuugh the Negligence regime.

1.  **Beasts:** strict liability if they go on someone else's land

> ***[Doerr Case:]{.underline}***
>
> The case involves a biker being injured as a dog gets in his way and makes him have an accident. The dog was beckoned across the street by one of the owners from the other owner. The accident occurred in the middle of the street. Plaintiff sues for Negligence
>
> NY State rule: as it relates to animals, P can only recover under Strict Liability, showing that the owner knew of the vicious propensities of the animal.
>
> The appellate court, while not flat rejecting the above rule, gets around this by saying that this is a case that is like two people who decided to toss a ball back and forth and not like an animal case. So the NY State law doesn't apply here and negligence can be a thing to prove liability. ***[[Policy argument]{.underline}]{.mark}*** here is that otherwise, Defendants are cloaked in immunization that will allow them to not that the appropriate care.
>
> Dissent: points out that there was a case allowed for negligence for farm animals that are negligently allowed to stray, but the court did not extend to other animals explicitly, so the high court of the state should make that call.
>
> ***[Connecticut Horse Cases:]{.underline}***
>
> In the end the Connecticut legislature passed a law that says Horse in any civil action shall not be found to belong to a species that posseses a natural mischevious or vicious propensity. This law rebuts an automatic legal presumption that injury from horses are foreseeable, thus making negligence very easy to prove. Now the cases will be entirely on a case by case in every respect.
>
> In a case from the CT supreme court, the court ruled that horses were of the class of animals that are naturally inclined to cause injury and as a species they have the natural inclination to bite. The Supreme court had set forth a 2 part test for case-by-case analysis. 1) whether the particular horse was dangerous (making the injury foreseeable) 2) whether the horse owner was negligent in meeting a standard of care controlling the horse.
>
> Policy concerns: CT residents were concerned about the insurance associated with having horses being deemed vicious and inherently dangerous (which could have effectively made these cases like SL)...

2.  **Non-Natural Land Use:**

- If you bring something onto your land that'd cause mischief if escapes, you're liable for damage it causes (**[Rylands I]{.underline}**). D can excuse himself by saying that it was the plaintiff's fault or that it was some act of God that caused the damage. However if the D is the but for cause by some unnatural use of the land, he must own the consequences at his own peril. The policy being, the plaintiff cannot protect himself from unnatural uses of land.

- If your use of land is non-natural, you're liable for harms to others (**[Rylands II]{.underline}**)

- **\^ TOO EXTREME**! Court's didn't follow it.

<!-- -->

- Later, steam boiler exploded? Too bad. Fear of stunting industrial progress (**[Losee]{.underline}**)

- What's non-natural some places is natural others! (Digging for water in **[TX]{.underline}**)

- Except when toxic waste hurts others! (Mercury, **[FL]{.underline}**)

B.  **Restatement Standards\**

<!-- -->

3.  **Ultrahazardous Activity (R1):**

- High degree of danger

- Not a common activity (also, was P or D there first?)**\**

4.  **[Abnormally Dangerous (R2d):]{.mark}**

<!-- -->

1.  High risk of harm

2.  Likelihood that harm would be great

3.  Inability to eliminate risk w/ care levels \*

- B/c if we can just take more care, don't need SL for this, just use N.

4.  Not a common activity \*

5.  Inappropriateness of activity given location

6.  Value of activity to community vs. danger

- Courts focused on particular legs, ignored others. **Ex: [Cyanamid]{.underline}** 🡪 no strict liability to D:

<!-- -->

- Could have been easily prevented with more care, don't use SL. ![](media/image12.png){width="0.6527777777777778in" height="0.9027777777777778in"}

- Liability wont affect activity levels, b/c have to ship through urban areas

5.  **Abnormally Dangerous (R3d):**

<!-- -->

1.  Foreseeable and large risk of physical harm *even w/ reasonable care*

2.  Not a common activity

> **[commentary mentions that two factors omitted from the 2^nd^ Restatement: locational appropriateness and value to the community, may have some bearing on the remaining factors. Location can affect risks posed; and the value to the community could make a strong claim for negligence (think BPL)]{.mark}**

**v. [Strict Liability v. Negligence]{.underline}**

- SL could cause actors to change their activity levels. For example, if we held Cyanamid SL, they'd have to try alternate ways of shipping their chemicals, or not ship them at all. Is this really the most desirable outcome? Instead, if we hold them N, they can just focus on shipping more carefully, which would likely reduce the majority of the problem.

**When to use SL?**

- Very dangerous activities that cant be made safer with more care.

- **Activity Levels:** When we want to affect activity levels, in cases where we think it's highly unlikely that you can make the activity safer just by taking more care. We'd rather you just don't do it (Posner's ex: keeping tigers in your backyard).

- **Activity Levels:** When market will be better at determining activity levels than the court.

- **Care Levels:** since actor is internalizing all the costs with SL, he'll still want to affect care levels to minimize chances of an injury. Esp. w/ lucrative industry, will want to adjust care levels as much as possible before having to touch activity.

- **Care Levels:** Could promote R&D

**When to use N?**

- When we can probably use more care to make it safer.

<!-- -->

- **Care Levels:** When you can probably just take more care and eradicate most of the risks of the activity (**ex**: package your chemicals better, **[Cyanamid]{.underline}**). This will incentivize people to take care.

- When there's huge value to society of doing thing, so we want them to be able to do it, w/ care.

<!-- -->

- **Activity Levels**: Theoretically, liability could be imposed for engaging in too much of an activity, even with reasonable care, when the benefits of doing something, even with utmost care, are very slight, you just shouldn't do them. **Ex**: running into burning house really carefully to get a hat. In practice, the Courts will rarely do this b/c they don't like stepping in. They'd rather say "Drive safely," than "Don't drive."

**Who Decides? Court/Leg v. Actors**

- **Care Levels:** With SL, actor is internalizing all the costs so he is incentivized to change care levels too. Here, amount to change dial is up to actor, vs. with N the court decides. We'd rather let the actor decide when we can:

<!-- -->

- **[Cyanamid]{.underline}:** Court said Cyanamid wasn't liable b/c likely w/ more care the accident could've been avoided. Court didn't want to set care/activity levels, rather wanted to let Cyanamid do it on it's own.

<!-- -->

- **3^rd^ Restatement: "**Foreseeable and large risk of physical harm *even w/ reasonable care,*" reflecting sentiment in **[Cyanamid]{.underline}** that Courts should let actors change these dials if they can. Posner said this was the most important prong from R2d, and says others are folded into it. He differentiates btw SL and N b/c SL will more directly affect activity levels. It will also affect care levels, like N, because B=PL so it will want to make activity as safe as possible. Maybe it even does a **better job** at affecting care levels b/c puts onus on person who knows best: actor.

<!-- -->

- **[Hammontree v. Jenner]{.underline}**: The question of who decides was also addressed. P originally moved for both SL and N, then dropped N when it realized that Jenner did take all reasonable care. Court recognized that with both SL and N, D can internalize costs. With SL, D has to pay his own way for all harms caused. With N, D still has to pay his own way, *unless* it's not reasonable to take *extra* care. Court was saying that sometimes if you take enough care, you should not have to pay. (Like here, where Hammontree passed DMV requirements and was on medication. Ct reluctant to employ SL here because we don't want people driving less, it's not an inherently dangerous activity)

**If SL affects both activity and care levels, why not just use that? Why use N?**

**(**Who is the cheapest cost avoider?**)**

1.  **Institutional Competence:** maybe courts are better at setting care levels in N. If they make errors they make them less with N b/c harder to prove.

2.  **Overkill:** Don't need SL if N could reduce enough of the risk. Look at **[Cyanamid]{.underline}**: this is a pure care level case.

3.  **Admin Costs:** Focus on efficiency of tort system by optimizing care and activity levels given costs and benefits, minimizing sum of accident + prevention costs:

- SL is cheap b/c you don't have to prove N, but it could also cause more litigation since it's easier to sue, costing more in the end.

<!-- -->

- Since N trial are more expensive b/c longer and more fact based, less of them happen

4.  **Tradition:** N has traditionally been applied in common law.

5.  **Commerce:** In **[Cyanamid]{.underline}**, applying SL and affecting activity levels could negatively affect commerce b/c there's no way around metropolitan railroads, at least not cheap enough to make it worth while (tho this could happen with N too, if taking care is more expensive).

6.  **Economic Efficiency:**

7.  **Innovation:** SL has chilling effect, N let's them

8.  **Deterrence of Victim**: if you apply SL, potential victims have no incentive to take care themselves. Might even put themselves in dangerous positions -- build house at O'Hare. If you apply N, victim is more likely to alter behavior. (But should we be concerned with victims' behavior??) Similarly,

9.  **Coordinating Function**: w/ N, companies know the amount of care they have to take, so victims can act accordingly.

10. **Flexible Cost Spreading**: w/ N, b/c we can have comparative N and split the cost 🡪 deterrence

11. **Fairness**: on it's own, very subjective but ground fairness in other arguments: **Who's the fairest cost spreader?** Rather than forcing activity levels w/ SL, apply N and give them a chance to adjust their behavior. You want to punish those **are** blameworthy, those who **don't** take care, not just everyone who is SL.

b.  **[NEGLIGENCE/ "Breach of Duty"]{.underline}** (Objective standard, not about a good faith effort)

> The burden is on the plaintiff to prove that the defendant did not act with reasonable care *under the circumstances* (before Brown, it was on the D to prove that he acted with the utmost, extraordinary care) Defendant can also prove that the P acted negligent and there for contributed to her own injuries (comparative, modified comparative, contributory negligence regimes)

i.  **[Failure to take "due" care]{.underline} =** what a reasonably prudent person ought to have done.**\**

<!-- -->

1.  **Ordinary (**not extra**) & Intent:** (didn't mean to hit you with the sick, **[Kendall]{.underline}**)

    a.  **Untaken Precautions:** another way to prove that a party was negligent is to talk about the untaken precautions that a person could have done and how little they would have cost (BPL)

    b.  This is a subjective test, not what was going on in the mind of the defendant...

- Industrialism and infant industry **\**

2.  **Foreseeability:** (don't have to worry about freak kid with the wire, **[Adams]{.underline}**)

    a.  **Known or knowable possibility that there exists a risk that will result in harm.**

    b.  **Foreseeability doesn't equal probability...**simply because you can foresee that something will happen, doesn't necessarily mean that it is likely to occur and vice versa. Some probable occurrences may be unknown at the time, and the court will not require that someone be prudent about something that was not foreseeable in the circumstance. Similarly an activity may be foreseeable, but not so probable to occur. The courts impose a duty on you to take the reasonable care to avoid such dangers. The remoteness of the event happening may be something that will be argued within the BPL stage of the negligence claim.

3.  **Reasonable person** -- objective, not subjective. (took reasonable care driving epileptically, **[Hammontree]{.underline}**)

- **Jury:** objective reasonable person is easier than each case fact finding

- Subjective 🡪 **manipulative**

- **Incentives** D to take all care she can. If that's the best you can do, don't do it. **\**

- Would the reasonably prudent defendant taken such precautions (how would it stack up in the BPL analysis)

> **Cons:**

- **B \< PL =** makes it okay to take risks? (Questioned Posner, looked at economics)

  - **See Calabresi:** This isn't a huge risk, we often ignore market for social values

- Assumes we will equally weigh costs to us w/ costs to others on same scale

- Information costs

- Juries might ignore it/hate it**\**

Restatement (third) of Torts §3: A person acts negligently if the person does not exercises reasonable care under all the circumstances. Primary factors to consider in asserting whether the person's conduct lacks reasonable care are the foreseeable likelihood that the person's conduct will result in harm that may ensue, and the burden of precautions to eliminate or reduce the risk of harm.

ii. **[Negligence "per se"]{.underline}** -- violating a statute (normally judge question); this is a common law creation based on the idea that we don't think that reasonable people violate statutes

- ***NOTE!** Compliance w/ statute is just MINIMUM requirement. Simply complying with the statute means that you were not unreasonable, but it does not necessarily mean that you were reasonable under the circumstances.*

- Negligence if don't follow statute (bars you from recovery if lights are off, **[Herzog]{.underline}**)

- Violation of a statute doesn't automatically create a tort remedy (Cuyler)**\**

- **Exceptions:**

  - \(a\) the violation is reasonable because of the actor\'s incapacity (ex: a child is incapable of complying with the statute or an infirm adult cannot comply) (b) he neither knows nor should know of the occasion for compliance (ex: the statute wasn't inacted at the time of the accident); (c) he is unable after reasonable diligence or care to comply; (d) he is confronted by an emergency not due to his own misconduct (emergency doctrine); (e) compliance would involve a greater risk of harm to the actor or to others (Tedla)

  - The statute was not designed to protect the kind of injury that came about (Proximate cause argument here; we can't have an endless stream of liability just because some kind of affair was not ordered correctly)

    - However, when arguing this, remember that there may be other kinds of negligence that could have created the risk and injury. This kind of defense would likely only work if there was no conceivable way that the injured party was not supposed to benefit from the violated statute

      - Ways to analyze: 1) look to the legislative history or to the preamble or anything that may suggest the victim was thought of in the manner in which she was injured

      - 2\) decided if the violation of the statute increases any risk to the plaintiff's situation. If no; its likely that the person wasn't a beneficiary.

- **[Role of Licensing:]{.underline}**

  - Licensing statutes have generally not been used to set the standard of care, the explanation being licenses are designed to protect the public from unskilled actor Under this premise, it would not be negligent per se to show that someone was driving w/o a license, rather the Plaintiff would have to prove the Defendant lacked driving skills.

  - In medical Malpractice cases in NY, the CPLR codified a rule that unlicensed practicing of medicine is negligence per se. However, in some states it is possible that the unlicencsed practitioner will simply be held to the standard of care as the reasonable medical practitioner.

iii. **[Role of custom]{.underline}** -- (normally jury question)

- Evidence may be offered to prove negligence or reasonableness, but in and of itself, it is not dispositive of a breach of some kind of standard of care.**\**

<!-- -->

- Negligence can be found if you fail to comply with a custom that allows for great aversion to risks. (T.J. Hooper)

  - Ask yourself what is the purpose of the custom, and why do we necessarily not make it a rule?

  - Does the custom cut the other way? Is an industry necessarily negligent with the use of a custom (MKT Share Liability)

  - Non-compliance with a custom can be an untaken precaution that the P can point out.

- **Malpractice**

  - Majority rule as it relates to Malpractice is that compliance with the custom will insulate the defendant from liability

    - Failure to comply with the custom is malpractice

  - Proof of malpractice means proving that the D violated the standards of the profession

  - When there are **[[2 schools of thought]{.mark}]{.underline}** there is a respectable ***[[minority standard]{.mark}]{.underline}*** in which Drs and others may be able to rely on a respectable minority of practitioners who do things the way the Defendant did it to show that they have not deviated from a standard of care.

- *Common Knowledge*

  - There are times when the injury that is before the court is so egregious that there is no need for expert testimony. The jury doesn't need to rely on expert testimony, rather they can use common knowledge about the injury and its causes. Examples: operating on the wrong foot or leaving an instrument in a person.

> **Duty to Disclose/Informed Consent**

- The P needs to show that "but for the D's negligence" P would not have gone through with the medical procedure, fully aware of the risks associated therewith. Often difficult to prove

  - But when there are multiple alternatives it is easier and if the doctor knows of the idyosyncracies of the Patient then it can be easier to prove.

- Causation:

  - Semi-objective standard allows for the jury to get into the head of the patient and ask what would have reasonable patient in her shoes have done

  - Objective standard: disregards the unknown idiosyncrasies of the patient and does the normal reasonable patient.

- Basically this idea that the Patient has the right to make an autonomous decision about his care...right to determine if they are comfortable with the risks associated with a procedure

- Sounds in torts because they didn't do enough to make sure the Patient was consenting (not battery, where there is no consent)

- BPL should be pretty easy for the Patent here (what's a few extra words?)

**2 standards of review for Informed Consent**

- Reasonable patient standard

  - Duty of the doctor to disclose what he thinks a reasonable person in that patient's position would want to know when making his decision

    - Doesn't require that the physician be a mind reader🡺idiosyncrasies of the patient do not force additional disclosure unless they are known beforehand.

  - Amounts to an ordinary negligence standard to determine if disclosure was proper

- Reasonable physician standard

  - The failure to obtain informed consent sounds in malpractice

    - The plaintiff must prove that the physician did not adhere to the customs of the medical profession

**Causation**

- once you've proven the misinformation under a standard, you still must prove that there was a but for cause that the patient would not have gone on with the procedure if they had more information.

- This can take an objective or semi-objective form when making the case. Under objective, idiosyncracies will not be included about the patient

i.  **[Factual Causation/Actual Cause]{.underline}**

<!-- -->

A.  **"But for" Causation** = injury wouldn't have happened BUT FOR D.

- **But For Test**:

  - But for D's N, accident wouldn't have happened. If the answer is yes, then it is likely that the D will not be found liable bc his actions are not the reason that there was an injury. The critical question to ask is the "but-for" cause a negligent one.

    - The defendant will likely want to argue the counter-factual saying: even if D was not negligent, there is no way the injury could have been avoided...asking the jury to imagine the scenario without the defendant and asking the judge to judge as a matter of law if this "hypothetical" is sufficient as a matter of law to go to the jury.

    - D may also want to impart that there was no duty (proximate cause argument) and therefore, there could not have been any negligent behaviors.

- **Substantial Factor Test**

  - a minority of courts use a substantial factor test that asks the juries to decide if the Negligence of the D was influential in causing the injury. This is not a very helpful jury instruction because it does not really drive at the D being the cause of the harm to a preponderance of the evidence.

- **Cause in Fact for Informed Consent Cases**

  - The P must prove but for causation as it relates to procedure. Often difficult to prove because many people listen to their doctors.

  - Not quite battery because there was some consent, but not the appropriate level of invasiveness.

  - 2 Tests/Views for this:

    - Objective🡺simply a reasonable Patient Standard, ignores the idiosyncracies of the patient and only looks at the reasonable patient.

    - Semi-Objective🡺 mixed bag of law and fact here, allows the Patient to introduce evidence of idiosyncracies but only as evidence.

  - Serves two aims:

    - Information sharing

    - Protecting the autonomy of the Patient in making her decisions.

***[Three kinds of causation in fact]{.underline}***

- But-for

  - Common sense rule

  - Has no limiting principle

- Multiple sufficient causation

  - Avoids perverse outcomes

  - Harder for plaintiff to get relief

  - Deterrence and fairness

- Multiple necessary cause

  - Special type of "but-for" cause

  - Precaution proportional to the risk, but should not be related to other people's negligence

Causation in fact can be established without the need to rule out every other possible cause of injury; all that is required to establish causation in fact is reasonable certainty that conduct was the direct cause of injury.

**[[Aegis Insurance v. 7 World Trade Center]{.underline}]{.mark}**

P is suing allging that the negligence of the people constructing the building was a "but-for" cause to the collapse.

Appellate court ruled that there was a duty; whereas the trial court ruled that there was no duty and therefore no Negligent cause of the collapse.

The appellate court rules that there was no breach, however, because there was no but-for cause that happened. They ruled that the but-for cause was the planes crashing into the building and many other causes.

**[\]{.underline}**

- **Diseases**: Only sue for harm that materialized already. Sue later if another develops (**[Simmons]{.underline}**)

<!-- -->

- Anti-money now: what if 2^nd^ disease never develops? Empty D's coffers before others can claim, P might spend it all before disease strikes, deters economic and medical advances

<!-- -->

- Otherwise D is incentivized to continue N behavior, harder to gather evidence when disease #2 does appear.

B.  **Multiple (& Potential) D's:\**

<!-- -->

a.  If 2 or more potential causes exist, only one of which D is liable for, P has to show w/ "**reasonable certainty**" that her injury was caused by D. (**[Stubbs]{.underline}**)

- Use expert testimony\* (See **[Daubert]{.underline}** standards, below)

- Statistical data (compare to baseline and rising trends)

- Timely changes (symptoms followed by high doses)

- Timely changes to others

- Rule out alternatives

\* **[Expert Testimony]{.underline}**: especially when causation rests on testimony, check **[Daubert]{.underline}** standards:

- General acceptance of the theory

- Has theory been tested, peer reviewed, published

- Known or potential rate of error of scientific techniques**\

b.  **Substantial Factor Test:** If (a) act is N b/c increases chances of an injury and (2) that injury occurs, enough to show N was substantial cause of injury. Burden on D to show otherwise. (High dose of medicine, **[Zuchowicz]{.underline}**). **[\
    \]{.underline}**

c.  **Multiple Sufficient Causes**: but for test fails (Tort law often punts the causation issue back to damages, because it could be too difficult to determine causation); Places burden on the defendant to show that he wasn't the one who casued the injury

<!-- -->

1.  **Two N causes**: two fires converging on a house; neither can satisfy the but for requirement

    - Now, Joint and Severally liable (see below) even for small %; If jury can't figure out %, split it even.

    - In this case the court instead of choosing to relieve both negligent actors of their liability, the court will choose to impose too much liability rather than too little

2.  **Two causes, one N, one not**: usually burden back on P to prove D's liability

    a.  Many states do not impose liability on the tortious actor because the injury would have occurred either way...some states do hold the tortious actor liable.

    b.  Under some comparative negligence regimes, states may choose to reduce the liability of the tortious actor in accordance with the non-tortious actor's cause to the injury.

    c.  Some states do not impose any liability when one of the MSC is not tortious

3.  **Two sequential causes:** only the first is liable, regardless of N.

    - Sometimes there is moral luck in that you would have been liable to a party, but your negligence either affected no one or someone has already caused the damage.

      - Similar line of reasoning when deciding not to impose liability in the scenario above

    - P would've died if not for grabbing electrical wire -- damages reduced (**[Dillon]{.underline}**)

      - In this case the kid was falling to his death and grabbed a wire, courts ruled that even though he would have died, the electric company is responsible for the 10seconds of life they deprived him off. (kicking the issue back over to damages as opposed to causation)

> **[Restatment third of Torts view]{.underline}**
>
> §26 Factual Cause
>
> Tortious conduct must be a factual cause of harm for liability to be imposed. Conduct is a factual case of harm when the harm would not have occurred absent the conduct. Tortious conduct may also be a factual cause of harm under §27
>
> §27 Multiple Sufficient Causes
>
> If multiple acts occur, each of which under §26 alone would have been a factual cause of the physical harm at the same time in the absencse of the other act(s), each act is regarded as a factual cause of the harm.

***d*. *One cause tortious, the other innocent.* This Section applies in a case of multiple sufficient causes, regardless of whether the competing cause involves tortious conduct or consists only of innocent conduct. So long as each of the competing causes was sufficient to produce the same harm as the defendant\'s tortious conduct, this Section is applicable. Conduct is a factual cause of harm regardless of whether it is tortious or innocent and regardless of any other cause with which it concurs to produce overdetermined harm.**

**When one of multiple sufficient causes is not tortious, the question of damages is a different matter from the causal question. The question of what (if any) damages should be awarded against these tortfeasors properly belongs to the law of damages and is not addressed in this Restatement.**

**The Restatement Second of Torts § 432(2), Comment *d*, provides that when innocent and tortious multiple sufficient causes concur, the actor responsible for the tortious cause is a legal cause of the harm and subject to liability for all of the harm. Unlike the Second Restatement, this Section does not address the matter of the amount of liability of such an actor---it only provides that such tortious conduct is a factual cause of the harm.**

d.  **Multiple Necessary Cause**: but for test fails

- **Joint and Several Liability**: 2 or more N D's, both liable.

- **Three different scenarios**

a.  joint tortfeasors (defendants acting in concert)

b.  independent tortfeasors for a single indivisible harm

c.  for a single theoretically divisible, but practically indivisible har

    - P can collect from either or both (*several* -- divided among D's)

    - No more than 100% total.

    - D's work out % in later proceedings through contribution statutes

    - If one is insolvent, other covers 100% (*joint* -- cover for absent D's); removes the risk of a judgement proof defendant away from the plaintiff

- **Concert/Enterprise**: all liable, even if P can't prove they each did it

- **Indivisible Harm**: all liable for equal parts of 100%**\
  [\]{.underline}**

e.  **Alternative Liability**: not all D's caused injury, but P can't prove which one

    - Court shifts burden on D's to prove they're not N and or the cause of the injury, since they're closer to evidence, otherwise they're joint and severally liable (who's got the smoking gun, **[Summers]{.underline}**)

      - B/c otherwise, even tho both N and 1 N *did* cause injury, both are off the hook

      - Typically more likely to impose this on people who are acting in the same arena rather than total strangers BUT if the Ds are acting together (joint enterprise) Joint & Several liability can be imposed

    - More potential D's, harder this is to justify burden shifting b/c can they really know?

- **Summers v. Tice (1948) -** Each of several potential tortfeasors, any of whose negligence could've been cause of single indivisible injury to plaintiff, will be jointly & severally liable.

- Alternative liability should not be imposed where one of the potential causes of the harm is nontortious. Ex: fencer puts defective saber back with other sabers.

- Importance of 'common enterprise' among tortfeasors (important to think about with Market Share liability)

- Rationale much weaker when \>2 tortfeasors

  - Easier to determine fault among two than among many

  - Small difference between 50% and 50.1% likely to have caused fault

  <!-- -->

  - **[Moral Luck!]{.underline}** (See above)

  - **Two causes, one N, one not**: usually burden back on P to prove D's liability

**\**

f.  **Lost Chance Doctrine --** ONLY med-mal

    - P can recover for lost chance of survival, even if chance of survival was less than 50% before D's N. (cancer, not gas **[Matsuyama]{.underline}**)

    - **\^** Overturned **All or Nothing**: If P had less than 50% survival anyway, D isn't liable at all.

    - "Lost chance," not increased chance of death. The latter would allow P to recover for all little harms. Here, P was either over or under compensated for same amount of N.

- Lowers threshold of proof of causation (+ P has to prove D caused the injury)

- Statistical likelihood of survival is speculative (+ Estimates are based on data)

- Hard for jury to measure (+ " )

- Dr.'s job is uncertain and complex (+ But there are some things they should know)

- Ramifications are too intense (+ This cost is outweighed by benefits of care)**\**

g.  **Market Share Liability**

> Theory being that Market Share is an appropriate proxy for how much harm the manufactures caused. Defendant should not be able to escape liability because causation cannot be proved.
>
> **Not Alt. Liability:**

1.  Too many D's at different times for burden shifting to work

2.  D's don't have access to more info than P (several, not joint; don't owe for insolvent D's)

3.  Here, each D *did* hurt *someone*, so fairness concern from quail case disappears

4.  There is no greater information to be forced for sharing. So Alt Liability won't get the same benefits to it.

Questions to ask re: market Liability

1)  signature disease at it relates to the pill or whatever

    a.  answer needs to be yes

    b.  this means that only this disease is caused by the pill or whatever (bc Plaintiff doesn't have to prove exact causation, they need to prove the drug at least was that)

2)  identical products throughout the market. Is the chemical composition the same

    a.  answer needs to be yes; otherwise you could be providing damages to a plaintiff when the D had no possibility of causing the harm

3)  Which Market

    a.  National Market

    b.  Potential argumentation for the Defendant that it didn't operate at that time or ever sell in that region

4)  Defendant Can exculpate?

    a.  Yes: didn't market that good for Negligent purposes, wasn't in the market at the time (region or nationally)

5)  Were the people acting in concert?

    a.  If yes, you could impose Joint & Several Liability here

6)  Who bears the risk of the loss

    a.  Plaintiff ultimately does; liability is several only

- **[Hymowitz]{.underline}** + other examples on 382.

- Could apply to toxins, chemicals, environmental concerns (384)

h.  Lost Chance Doctrine

> Characterized as the defendant doctor causing the plaintiff to lose an opportunity to survive. These cases are limited to medical malpractice case rather thann broader implications.
>
> The theory is not so much that the doctor caused death, but he more than likely caused the loss of chance to survive.
>
> Calculating Damages under Lost Chance.

i.  find the total amount of damages allowable under wrongful death

ii. determine the % chance of survival before the negligence

iii. find the survival rate after the negligence

iv. subtract 2) from 3)

v.  multiply the value for 4) by the value for 1)

> i(ii-iii)= damages under lost chance doctrine

ii. **[Proximate Cause = Scope of Liability]{.underline}**-- Was proximate cause a result of D's N? Or bark?![](media/image13.png){width="3.6354166666666665in" height="2.7604166666666665in"}

**Note**: this can be a "fudge-factor" allowing judges/juries to decide whether liability should be imposed even after other prerequisites have been satisfied.

A.  **Foreseeability Standard\*:**

> D's N is a proximate cause of P's harm if causing that harm was a foreseeable result of action. (Ex: accident after running red light.)

\* **Note:** sometimes P claims harm was unforeseeable in order to dodge contributory N.

- Did something unexpected contribute to the occurrence or severity of harm?

- If you couldn't foresee it, how could you prevent it, or balance B \>PL?

- **[Traditional Rule]{.underline}:** D is liable for **all** harm "directly" caused by N, even if it wasn't the foreseeable harm (even the explosion, **[In re Polemis]{.underline}**)

<!-- -->

- **Rationale:**

  1.  Act was N b/c harmful. Even if not *expected* harm, you're still N (**[Kinsman]{.underline}**).

  2.  Act is N in itself.

<!-- -->

- **[Modern Rule]{.underline}:** D only liable for Foreseeable consequences of his N (slippery, not fire, **[WagonMound]{.underline}**).

<!-- -->

- **Rationale:**

1.  If D anticipated this harm, might not have done it. Couldn't do B \> PL.

2.  N is a term of relation, only liable when you breach a duty you owed

3.  In life there are unavoidable risks and some of them are unforeseen; the charge of the court is not to dodge every risk, but to not create risks. The court cannot ask you to avert that which is unknown.

> Foreseeability is the hallmark of proximate cause.
>
> 2 step analysis

a)  was the D negligent

    a.  all risks considered inquiry

b)  whether the harm or injury was forseeable result of the negligence

    a.  asks about the nature and relation if the relatin between the defendant's negligence and what actually happened to the plaintiff

Harm within the Risk analysis demands the question: is the risk of the injury the plaintiff one of the risks that makes the defendant negligent? Did the defendant's negligence increase the risk of the injury

This analysis becomes more murky when you get to the secondary risks associated with negligence and these should go to juries to determine.

- **[Does it matter for N if you can Foresee:]{.underline}** \*

1.  **Type of harm** -- YES (Cardozo's view prevails, this affects whether D was N), but also a case by case type deal

    - Ex: If you didn't foresee the type of harm happening, not w/in scope (**[WagonMound]{.underline}**)

    - Though most courts will decide this on a case-by-case basis, usually by jury.

      - Normally will weigh using questions like in Andrews dissent below.

2.  **Mechanism/manner of harm** -- NO (Andrews's view prevails, shouldn't matter)

    - **[Rule]{.underline}**: unless ex poste the manner was so totally extremely unforeseeable the fact that manner was weird does not bar recovery.

    - Andrews's view in **[Palsgraf]{.underline}**: shouldn't matter if manner that caused harm was unforeseeable to D.

    - Cardozo even says that manner shouldn't matter for dangerous items (explosives, chemicals, guns) where it's more likely that a random, bizarre harm could occur.

    - Relates where P was harmed in a bizarre way (staff falling on her, hit walking down road after initial car accident.)

3.  **Extent of harm** -- NO (Andrews's view prevails, shouldn't matter)

    - **[Thin Skull Rule]{.underline}**: D "takes victim as he finds him." D is liable for full extent of harm, even if extent is unforeseeable.

    - Otherwise P's would have to prove that extent of their harm was F, would involve subjective jury consideration.

    - Andrew's view in **[Palsgraf]{.underline}**: shouldn't matter that D couldn't F extent of harm done to P

> **[\]{.underline}**

4.  **Victim** -- YES (Cardozo's view prevails, matters whether you can F victim)

- **N is a term of relation**. If no duty, no N. No duty if you can't foresee the victim (Cardozo)

  - Cardozo's view in **[Palsgraf]{.underline}**: not Foreseeable at all that Mrs. Palsgraf would be there, be affected. Thus, D did not owe her a duty of care. Not a question for the jury.

  - Andrews's view in **[Palsgraf]{.underline}**: we have a **public duty not to do N acts.** Ex: If you speed, you're N whether you hit someone or not.

- But, maybe people scared by explosion trampling into scale, causing it to hit P was F...

\* If any of the YES's are in question, they go to jury to decide.

**[Palsgraf:]{.underline}**

- **[Majority/Cardozo]{.underline}**:

  - **Negligence:** D wasn't N towards P b/c no direct duty btw them. N is a term of relation.

  - **Limiting Principle:** Were you N to this person that you owed duty too?

  - **Foreseeability:** Only have a duty to those victims you can foresee hurting.

- **[Dissent/Andrews:]{.underline}**

  - **Negligence:** We have a public duty not to be N.

  - **Limiting Principle:** Proximate Cause... but very subjective (see below)

  - **Foreseeability:** Just one part of proximate cause. Doesn't matter if direct act is totally unforeseeable. Unforeseeable harms are caused by your N and you're liable for these to a certain degree. This "degree" is subjective, but can be gauged: (425)

    - "Natural and continuous sequence between cause and effect?"

    - Was cause a substantial factor in producing the effect?

    - Direct connection btw the two w/o too many intervening causes?

    - Was effect of the cause on the result not too attenuated (weakened)?

    - Was the cause F (per reasonable person) to produce the result? (**[Wagon]{.underline}**)

      - [NOTE!]{.underline} For Cardozo, this is the whole question. For Andrews, just one point of proximate cause.

**Q**: What if you can foresee the victim but not type of harm? (Ex: girl drops gun on foot and hurts it)

- Cardozo: That person no longer counts as a foreseeably injured party 🡪 no N

- Andrews: It's a direct result of your N action, giving gun to girl, (go thru Q's above) 🡪 N.

- Ex: like **[Wagonmound]{.underline}**, where victim was F but type of harm was not.

**Q:** What if you can foresee it hitting her foot, but then she drops it on another person's hand?

- Cardozo: unforeseeable Victim 🡪 no N.

- Andrews: grey area. Subjective.

B.  **HARM-Within-The Risk (HWTR) Test:\**

> Is the risk of the injury P suffered one of the risks that makes D N for doing X in the first place? (Ex: accident in front of hydrant?)

- A sharper and clearer alternative to Foreseeability Test.

- Was a HWTR if D's N **foreseeably increases** **the likelihood of that injury happening.**

  - **Ex**: Trolley speeding (N) put train at point X and tree fell on it there. Not a HWTR (**[Berry]{.underline}**)**[\]{.underline}**

C.  **R3d (more like Cardozo than Andrews)**:

    - Calls proximate cause = scope of liability

    - **Negligence:** D's N is proximate cause of injury if harm that results is that which made D's conduct N in the first place. To answer this, ask:

      - Did D's action increase risk of harm occurring?

      - Was the harm foreseeable to a reasonable person? If, so, D is liable.

    - **Foreseeability:** Restatement uses F to establish whether D was N (like Cardozo)

    - **Limiting Principle:** Was harm foreseeable to reasonable person (takes one step further than Cardozo, who ends at N. R3d more likely to say risks caused by a superseding factor, if reasonable person could've foreseen it, was w/in scope of liability.)

D.  **Superseding Causes:** is an intervening force or actor to blame instead of D?

- If superseding cause creates an unF harm, outside scope of risk, to P, D is not liable

- Whether superseding causes break causal chain of liability is totally subjective, depends on the specificity of facts that are given at trial (like peg-leg guy, **[Hines]{.underline}**). Note discrepancy:

  - **NOT LIABLE**:

    - Nly maintained pole. D is liable if it just fell on P, but not if N driver hit it (**[Gibson]{.underline}**)

    - Selling booze to gang members who rape/kill girls, since that's unF (**[Phan Son]{.underline}**)

      - But what if they looked really dangerous? Talked about initiation to D?

  - **LIABLE**:

    - Injury sustained when guy with peg-leg tried to tow car stuck in mud.

<!-- -->

- R3d and case law have diminished ability of superseding causes to break causal chain. Why? B/c Comp N allows D to claim back damages from another third party later on.

d.  **[DAMAGES]{.underline}**

- Lots of states have damage caps on tort reform, though usually just on non-economic damages, like pain & suffering.

i.  **Joint and Several Liability** (see Causation \> Multiple Necessary Causes)

- 2 or more N D's, both liable.

  - P can collect from either or both (*several* -- divided among D's)

  - No more than 100% total.

  - D's work out % in later proceedings.

- If one is insolvent, other covers 100% (*joint* -- cover for absent D's).

ii. **Alternative Liability** (see Causation)

- **Liability**: not all D's caused injury, but P can't prove which one

  - Court shifts burden on D's to prove they're not N, since they're closer to evidence, otherwise they're joint and severally liable (who's got the smoking gun, **[Summers]{.underline}**)

    - B/c otherwise, even tho both N and 1 N *did* cause injury, both are off the hook

  - More potential D's, harder this is to justify burden shifting b/c can they really know?

  - **[Moral Luck!]{.underline}** (See above)

  - **Two causes, one N, one not**: usually burden back on P to prove D's liability

iii. **Market Share Liability** (see pg. 14o)

iv. **"Pure" emotional harm:** Nly inflicted emotional distress that isn't the result of Nly caused physical injury. (see Affirmative Duty/No Duty)

<!-- -->

1.  **[Independent Duty]{.underline}:** Nly fail to avoid emotional distress

- NO DAMAGES

2.  **[Derivative Duty]{.underline}:** Nly fail to avoid physical harm 🡪 emotional harm only

- NO DAMAGES

3.  **[Derivative Duty]{.underline}:** Nly fail to avoid physical harm 🡪 physical impact on P's body

- **Zone of Danger:** Liable if P was in "ZONE" in which physical injury was threatened, have to prove physical symptoms.

<!-- -->

- Ex: Fear caused by car coming at you, when causes bodily harm (**[Falzone]{.underline}**)

- P can recover for emotional injuries arising therefrom.

<!-- -->

- **Many states have damage caps on pain & suffering\**

- A few courts have thrown out categorical approach all together and analyze emotion damages just as they do other damages on **a case-by-case basis**. Limit by developing categorical rules over time and relying on the jury; require reasonableness. \[Gammon (leg in bag caused guy to have nightmares when thought it was loved one - unreasonable)\]

v.  **"Pure" economic harm:** (see No Duty)

- **Rarely ever allowed**

- Loss of income but no physical or property harm? Then too bad (**[Madison Ave]{.underline}**)

<!-- -->

- Floodgates (BP), huge burden/"urban chaos," too variable to get insurance, stunt progress, D already deterred from creating bodily harm, loss distribution can be spread already

<!-- -->

- **Exception**: Natural resource damage (BP) where compensation funds are established.

**[3. DEFENSES\
]{.smallcaps}**

a.  **[Plaintiff's Negligence\*\]{.underline}**
    \* Note, P's Negligence must also be a proximate cause to matter and a cause in fact! Ex: P is told not to stand on railing, does anyway, and D's Nly built wall knocks her down. P's N wasn't a proximate cause.

> \* Burden is on D to show.**[\]{.underline}**

i.  **Contributory Negligence (old)**

- If P contributes *slightly* (even 1%) to accident, then unable to collect anything.

- Ex: Dog/stick case? (**[Brown]{.underline}**)

**[Limitations on Contributory N]{.underline}**: (mitigate all-or-nothing harshness of CN)

1)  **D's Recklessness**: D can't use CN as defense if he was reckless or willful misconduct

2)  **Statutes**: can bar using CN as a defense. (School bus, protect kids against their own N)

3)  **Avoidable Consequences**: if after injury P didn't mitigate, award was decreased (458)

4)  **Last Clear Chance**: D can't use CN if he had the last clear chance to avoid harm and didn't

    a.  **NOTE**: sounds like calling D a superseding cause!

5)  **Juries**: usually didn't follow the strict all or nothing rule, just wouldn't give P as much.

- **Cost Shifting:** can't collect damages if you've contributed to harm happening in 1^st^ place

- **Incentivizes** P's to be careful\... but doesn't incentivize D at all, so was quickly replaced.

- **Administrative Ease**: easier to give Y/N answer than assigning %

- **Fairness:** leads to more consistent damages and rulings that future P's and D's can rely on

> **\-\-- Fairness:** But, just b/c P is 5% N, should she be barred from recovery?
>
> **\-\--** Juries seem to do comparative N analysis anyways!

ii. **Comparative Negligence (modern)**

<!-- -->

1)  **Pure Form:** P can collect whatever % that D was N for.

2)  **Modified Form:** If P is \>50% N, can't collect anything

> \-\-- **Fairness**: notice that if P moves from 49% to 51%, all of a sudden get's nothing.

- Almost all states now use comparative N

- First decide what P should recover, THEN apply damages cap, if state has one

- Those courts that adopted through legislation usually chose modified form

- Those courts that adopted through judicial decision adopted pure form

- **Superseding Causes:** eradicated by Comp N b/c gives another way to soften D's liability

<!-- -->

- **Rescuers**: when they're P's suing D for causing the initial harm, don't need special protection b/c only their willful or wanton conduct counts towards Comp N. (some still want protection)

- **Drunk Driving:** if P can recover from D for supplying alcohol, perverse incentives to encourage P to drive drunk and profit from his actions. Comp. N solves this problem.

<!-- -->

- **[Who Decides btw CN or Comp N?]{.underline}** : Courts v. Legislature

  - Li v. Yellow Cab Co. court thought CN "all or nothing" was too strict.

  - Did court have a right to decide?

  - Legislature passed Civil Code 1715 saying D is liable "except so far as" P is too

  - Could have just reinterpreted Civil Code to mean Comp N, but has been CN for so long that wanted to change the whole thing for consistency.

  - **Potential issues**:

    - What to do w/ last clear chance rule? (Get rid of it.)

    - What to do w/ multiple D's? And if not all there?

    - What to do w/ willful/wanton misconduct? (Leave up to trial court.)

  - **Pro-Courts**:

    - Can take baby steps as issues arise, rather than all at once

    - Bases decisions on practice facts rather than theoretical realm of Legislature

  - **Pro-Legislature:**

    - More time and staff to analyze potential effects

    - Solves the issue once and for all in a thorough manner

    - Potentially more legitimate

    - We've elected them to do this kind of analysis 🡪 likely to accept results

i.  **Express:** When person waives right to bring tort action against potential injurer.

- Valid when waiver is signed knowingly, voluntarily, and aware of significance

  a.  Residential leases -- disclaim landlord's liability to tenants

  b.  Gym memberships

  c.  Lift Tickets**\**

ii. **Implied** -- Assumption of risks are implied in the behavior

<!-- -->

a.  **Primary:** P accepts Inherent Risks of an activity where **D isn't N**

- Rests on voluntariness of P's actions to undertake an unnecessary activity

  - P had knowledge of facts constituting dangerous situation

  - P knew situation was dangerous

  - P appreciated nature and extent of danger

  - Voluntarily exposed himself to the danger

- **Ex**: People hurt at sporting events

- **Ex**: Jerking is part of Flopper ride, D not N if P's hurt by it's proper course. Cardozo says P even assumes the *risk* of D's N, here. But is that 2ndary? (**[Flopper]{.underline}**)

- NOTE: Even after defense is established, D might be liable for not making changes to the ride later on. Or don't, and future P's will be barred under 2ndary.

b.  **Secondary**: P consciously and ***unreasonably*** subjects himself to D's N

- Note: **Sounds like P being CN/Comp N**

- Juries might mistake non-N risks taken as assumption of the risk when it's presented to them along w/ contributory N. **\**

c.  **Non-N Risk Assumption of Risk:**

- P isn't N but still assumes a risk knowingly:

  - **D IS STILL LIABLE:** P hurt while saving kid from train tracks (most courts)

  - **D IS OFF THE HOOK:** Emergency, only way to hospital is drunk driver.

- **Fireman's Rule**: bars FF's from recovering for injuries they suffer fighting N fires

iii. **Assumption of Risk v. Comparative Negligence**:

- Are they similar? Overlap? Do we need both? Are there benefits of having both?

ii. **Quasi-Public Duty**

- **Public Policy** -- when holding duty would impose huge burden on *important,* *societal* (not BP), *monopolizing* entity (like ConEd, **[Strauss]{.underline}**).

<!-- -->

- **Perverse incentives**: larger the company, less likely it's liable

> **The tension here is the court is trying to be fair to all the parties, figure out ways that can extend the liability to foreseeable harm to foreseeable parties, but also not extend liability to oppressive levels**. Here foreseeability as it relates to duty is such that the "orbit of duty" includes policy considerations as well.

iii. **Pure economic Harm absent proof of damage**

- **Public policy here is:**

  - Absent proof of injury, there are limitless amount of people who maybe able to claim econ loss for even if the causation is directly proven...

  - Court notes that the arbitrary nature of NJ's rule would mean that damages could be whimsical, pursuant to people being around or moral non-luck. This would be terrible for the "orbit of duty" because it offers no predictability that foreseeability demands.

  - However, the court in NY emphasizes further that foreseeability is not the end all re: duty

**[4. PROPERTY\
]{.smallcaps}**

a.  **[Trespass]{.underline}**: Protects right to exclusive possession

- Unauthorized entry by a person onto another's land based on intent to enter

- Terms softened over time: Rule changed into a standard.

  - As Trespass separated from its criminal law background; the question to ask: is the act on the part of the defendant, in interfering with the plaintiff's right to possession likely to cause conflict between them?

- Trespass \> Nuisance b/c for nuisance damages are much less

  - Additionally Trespass is about the property rights to exclude and autonomy of alnd things like protecting yourself against adverse posessors of your title.

- **Damages:**

  - **Remedy**: to compensate for the harm/damage that was caused

  - **Nominal**: to prove your ownership (\$1)

  - Note, damages much larger for trespass than nuisance

<!-- -->

- **Intent:**

  - \(1\) Only need to have intent to enter. Still liable if you think it's your dock.

  - \(2\) **Or Not:** Now, R2d, only liable for unintended intrusions if they cause actual harm

- **Care:**

  - Even if you weren't N, took all due care, still liable for your entry

- **Harm:**

  - \(1\) Physical harm does not need to be shown, only harm to your feelings of ownership (**[Reynolds]{.underline}**) -- subjective!

  - \(2\) **It does**: for unintentional trespass, under R2d

- **Entry:**

  - \(1\) Only entry needs to be shown

  - \(2\) **Or Not**: Even molecules, light, particles vibrations, but only those interfere with the property interests of exclusive possession and exclusion (**[Reynolds]{.underline}**)

<!-- -->

- Trespass is important b/c can cause conflict in the community. People could turn to self-help. When feelings of ownership are violated 🡪 violence, war!

<!-- -->

- **[Note]{.underline}**: Diff from **[Losee]{.underline}** (pg.10o) which would cause huge burden on industrial society

- **[Private Necessity]{.underline}**:

  - We allow trespass when person is protecting themselves in **emergency** (ex: storm), but she, herself, didn't create the risk that brings forth the necessity

  - Allowed when need **outweighs** harm caused by trespassing (family on board, **[Ploof]{.underline}**)

    - this is qualified by the fact that I may still have to pay damages for the harm I cause.

      - I can't tie my POS boat to your glass dock.

      - How big of a danger would be caused? Social harms? Big storm?

<!-- -->

- Would others be harmed?

- What are your alternatives?

- Is there time to spare? (if so you should contract with landowner🡺Coase)

> In the event of a true private necessity, the court recognizes a limited property right of the "trespasser," therefore the true landowner can't just cut you off or harm you because you have not trespassed in this respect.

  ------------------ -------------------
                     

  ------------------ -------------------

(1) Even under private necessity, still have to pay owner for harm that you caused his property (**[Vincent]{.underline}**)\*

- **Trespasser:**

  - Has to pay for damage regardless of whether it's trespass or privilege (1) (2)

  - Incentives D to weigh whether it's really necessary to trespass or not (activity levels!)

  - Looks like **strict liability** for trespasser!

- **Owner:**

  - Only has to pay as to pay necessary when his actions are unreasonable (4)

  - Looks like **N** for property owner!

<!-- -->

- **Who Decides What's Reasonable? (P/D/Court?)**

  - Court:

    - Owner will do what he assumes the COURT will call reasonable since that would protect him from paying (3)

<!-- -->

- Trespasser

<!-- -->

- Trespasser will weigh his own harm/benefits because if he has to pay anyway he has to decide if it's actually worth it or not.

<!-- -->

- Owner

<!-- -->

- Does his own analysis to see whether he can get away w/ untying it or not.

> **🡪 Thus,** trespass will only be allowed (when it benefits trespasser, and when property owner knows he can untie for free, b/c court will say it's reasonable) when all three agree/decide
>
> **[\]{.underline}**

b.  **[Nuisance]{.underline}**: Protects right to use and enjoy land

- **Entry:**

  - Violating right to enjoy land, doesn't involve a physical entry

- **Harm:**

  - Have to show that harm was caused (not concerned with minor/trivial interferences)

1)  **Intentional + Unreasonable Nuisance**:

- **Intent:**

  - Per R2d, have to **intend** to violate someone's usage/enjoyment of property **and** it be **unreasonable**; or it must be **negligen**t or **reckless** or **abnormally dangerous**

  - Easy to show: just have to be **aware** of your activity, (b/c you can assume it'll hurt someone, emitting particles into the air)

<!-- -->

- **Unreasonable if:**

  - \(1\) Harm \> Benefit (as we've seen) or

  - \(2\) Serious and P shouldn't have to pay, but cutting off the activity as a whole is not (in which case, D should pay for it! **[Boomer]{.underline}**)

  - **Why Both?**

    - Without (2) we might call some bad behavior "reasonable" (like polluters in **[Boomer]{.underline}**). With (2), courts can still make polluters pay.

    - Shows shift away from reasonableness as we understood it before.

- **Damages:**

  - In nuisance, damage can be continuing at time of trial, unlike other torts. Hence:

  - **Monetary**: P can claim past and future losses

  - **Injunctive Relief**:

    - Enjoin D from continuing activity (+ past loss)

    - Court weigh costs & benefits to each, who was there first, value to society

    - Court can deny injunction when cost of discontinuing activity is much greater than harm to P (like in **[Boomer]{.underline}**, pollution). (Note that dissent said pollution to society outweighed economic value of factory).

    - Does it matter, or will parties bargain around it? ... see below**[\]{.underline}**

<!-- -->

- **4 Types of Remedial Alternatives in Nuisance**

  - No Nuisance, D Enjoins P:![](media/image7.png){width="2.8854166666666665in" height="2.1354166666666665in"}![](media/image9.png){width="1.3888888888888888e-2in" height="2.125in"}

    - No Liability

    - P looses nuisance suit, D continues his activity, P can't enjoy land.

    - If P values his enjoyment more than D's activity, P can bargain (Coase). ![](media/image17.png){width="2.875in" height="1.3888888888888888e-2in"}

    - **D sets the price and D decides if nuisance should continue.\**

<!-- -->

- Nuisance, P enjoins D:

<!-- -->

- P get's property rights

- P wins nuisance suit, D pays for harm and is barred from continuing activity

- If D values his activity more than P's enjoyment, D can bargain.

- (Coase: Transaction costs are high, tho. Parties might not want to bargain, or there might be lots of P's to reach out to. Could be "hold outs" trying to make lot of money as last P.)

- **P sets the price and P decides if nuisance should continue.\**

<!-- -->

- Nuisance, D compensates P:

<!-- -->

- P just gets damages

- Court decides cost of discontinuing activity outweighs harm to P (**[Boomer]{.underline}**)

- Court might think injunctions would cause messy bargaining, so just make D pay it's way forward. If not worth it to D, it'll stop nuisance.

- **Jury sets the price and D decides if it will continue\**

<!-- -->

- Nuisance, P compensates D:

<!-- -->

- Court allows P's to pay D to not continue nuisance

- Ex: P wanted to develop land next to D's cattle ranch but smell was really bad. Court ruled it was a nuisance but said P had to pay D for cost of moving since D was there first (**[Spur Industries v. Del E. Webb]{.underline}**)

- **Jury sets price and P decides if it will continue**

2)  **Unintentional Nuisance**:

- Liable if it arises out of N, reckless conduct, or abnormally dangerous activities

- Injury has to restrict use and enjoyment of land

c.  **[Conversion🡺SL tort]{.underline}**

- When D practically makes himself owner of P's property (not land)

- **Intent:** Just that you intended to take ownership, doesn't require malice

- **Damages**: can claim full value of property

> **[3 elements of conversion:]{.underline}**

i)  ownership or right to possession

ii) wrongful disposition of the property right

iii) damages

> **[Why would Courts say They're Extending or Applying?]{.underline}**

- **Extension:** allows Court to make their own rules and also to bring in PP arguments.

- **Application**: doesn't infringe on legislature

- **Extending Conversion:**

  - No conversion if you do something owner couldn't (like reproduce cells, **[Moore]{.underline}**)

  - No conversion from concern w/ property to body parts (like spleen, **[Moore]{.underline}**)

  - No conversion if you gave up your property rights (like operation, **[Moore]{.underline}**)

  - Court concerned with policy arguments of fairness: research, medical progress.

<!-- -->

- **Extending Nuisance:**

  - Didn't, in **[Boomer]{.underline}**. **[\]{.underline}**

- **Applying Conversion:**

  - Court applies conversion laws to intangible property (domain names, **[Kremen]{.underline}**)

  - Says that CA doesn't follow Restatement very strictly, so can stretch application

  - Kremen allows the plaintiff to sue the person who facilitated the conversion as well as the person who retains the property.

  - Against allowing conversion for intangibles: opening floodgates

  - Pro allowing conversion to intangibles: valuable ownership of IP

d.  **[Trespass to Chattels]{.underline}**

- When D does minor damage to P's property (not land)

- **Damages:** can only claim value of harm done

- **Harm:** damage to use or value of property actually has to be shown (wasn't in **[Intel]{.underline}**)

- **Extending Trespass to Chattels**:

<!-- -->

- Trespass to chattels does not extend to electronic communication when there's no damage to use or value of property (email systems, **[Intel]{.underline}**).

  - Against extending: open floodgates (telemarketers, intrusive ads)

<!-- -->

- **Extend Trespass to Chattel from Server Trespass to Land?**

  - Try to argue that Internet server is a *place* where things are kept, pass thru.

  - Courts not comfortable extending servers to Trespass to Land

  - Pro extending: gets rid of 'offensive content' issue that'd open floodgates to ads

5.  **[DAMAGES]{.smallcaps}**

<!-- -->

a.  **[See Damages under Element of a Tort\]{.underline}**

b.  **[Injunctions (Equitable)\]{.underline}**

- Rule changed to Standard

  - \(1\) **Hard Rule**: Give injunctive relief for patent infringement absent exceptional circumstances (Circuit Court in **[Ebay]{.underline}**; ultimately reversed by the SC)

> **[eBay moving us to a standard like test:]{.underline}**

- \(2\) **4 Factor Standard Test for Injunctive Relief** (Majority in **[Ebay]{.underline}**):

> Justice Thomas, writing for a unanimous court, says that the equitable power of the court in this instance maintains considerable discretion. Basically the court will not look into the decision, once the judges have appropriately used the test. *[[Who decides? Judge when it comes to granting Injunctive relief over damages]{.underline}]{.mark}*
>
> Plaintiff must prove all of the four factors below.

- \(1\) Has irreparable harm been caused?

- \(2\) Monetary damages are inadequate?

- \(3\) Is equitable remedy warranted after weighing the burdens and benefits to both the plaintiff and defendant?

- \(4\) The public interest be will not be disserved by the injunction?

<!-- -->

- **Chief Justice Roberts** (concurring in **[Ebay]{.underline}**): weigh the factors but limit our outcome with history and tradition (pro-Rule). We should allow the injunction. Roberts is saying that the trouble with factors 1&2 almost always leads to an Injunction (almost like history as a gloss on those factors to sway for the P)

- **Pro-Standards (+AMK)**:

<!-- -->

- Concern with giving companies leverage in cases where patents aren't huge part of their business, just gives them bargaining power, like property rights. Compare to nuisance/**[Boomer]{.underline}**.

- Allow court to keep up with changing times

- Pro standards

- Look case by case

**[Concerns w/ Ebay 4 Factor Test]{.underline}**:

- Led to revolution in equitable damages even though claimed it was following history

- Leaves out other fairness factors (such as, does P have clean hands?)

- Concerned with getting rid of presumptions from history

> **[4 Factor Test]{.underline}** now applies for all IR questions.

- Was applied in Western Land:

  - The court says that no fact finding is required and the court can make a judgement on the papers. Seems to be construing the words of eBay court, because Thomas says that courts have tremendous equitable latitude. BUT these questions/factors are matters of fact!

>
> **[Property Rights:]{.underline}**
>
> *What is it?*
>
> An entitlement is comes in the form of a property right in it is alienable, and the only way for someone to get it from the holder of the property right is to provide consideration (usually in the form of \$\$\$). This allows for the least amount of state intervention because the parties are in a position to negotiate with each other.
>
> *How does it work?*
>
> the tortfeasor has an ability to pay the "bribe" or to let it go and do his harmful activities at a cheaper price elsewhere. The plaintiff or, he holding the injunction, sets the price for the bargain.
>
> *Why them over damages?*
>
> Encourages bargaining; takes the guessing out of calculating damages
>
> **[Liability Rules:]{.underline}**
>
> *What is it?*
>
> A liability rule is an objectively set value by the court for the entitlement. This allows the Defendant to determine what he wants to do because continued violations will bring set damages pursuant to the harm. He decides if it is worth it for him to keep doing what he does. Similarly once the Plaintiff receives the damages, he must decide if the damages cover any idiosyncrasies of him and is it worth enduring the nuisance.
>
> *How does it work?*
>
> State says value of the harm is XYZ and Defendant pays it. He cannot buy the right to cause the nuisance, he must pay everytime it is brought to the court...There is no alienability between defendant and the plaintiff in this instance but the right to sue runs with the land and the next person could then sue. Requires more government monitoring.
>
> *Why liability rules over an injunction?*
>
> Better when parties cannot bargain for whatever reason; bargaining can be inefficient and not leave the parties better off when it's all said and done

c.  **[Compensatory Damages (Legal)\]{.underline}**
    The aim of compensatory damages is to make the person "whole/put them where they would have been w/o the injury"

> This includes the compensation for the medical bills and things like that (like reliance damages in that you have to do these things because of the situation the D put you in.) And Pain and suffering (like restitution damages in that this is a disgorgement of the D and accounting for the losses you have had above the cost of what it takes to fix your injury)

**[Seffert v. LA Trans]{.underline}:**

- Medical costs, lost income, pain and suffering

- **Aim:**

  - To make P whole again. Put P in position she'd have been in before the injury.

- **Concerns:**

  - Excessive

  - Fraud (pain and suffering)

  - No Consistency -- makes it hard for D's to anticipate and balance B = PL

  - Judge Traynor:

    - Pain and suffering shouldn't be allowed -- too subjective for P to talk to jury

    - Future medical procedures are hard to quantify

    - Future wages difficult

    - How long would she live anyway? If you could prove she'd die next year, could reduce damages (**[Dillon]{.underline}** -- boy would've died if not for electrical wire)**\**

<!-- -->

- **Restraining Excessive Damages:**

  - Statutory caps on pain and suffering

    - Makes things more predicable, but at the costs of those who are really injured above the cost.

  - Sometimes statutory caps on total award

    - Same issue as above

  - Schedules:

    - Potentially not feasible, but it spreads the sacrifice around

    - Would need legislative action

  - Court can reduce:

1.  Jury gives \#

2.  Trial Judge can reduce ("shocks the conscious" "suggests passion, prejudice or corruption")

    a.  Much deference given to the Jury and judge (who serves as the 13^th^ juror and approves by not granting appeal on the award) Appeals Court can't change as much b/c not as close to the facts

> **[Example of Court Restraining the excessive damages:]{.underline}**
>
> Spamhouse Case:
>
> Facts: default judgment for the plaintiffs after defendant revokes his pleadings or something procedural like that. The court then issues a judgment for the plaintiff based off affidavits presented by the plaintiffs for damages and injunctive relief.
>
> Judicial appellate review:
>
> **Damages:** the court rules that simply because the judgment was a default one, there needs to be an inquiry into the adequacy of the affidavits presented by the P. simply taking his word wil not be sufficient.
>
> **Injunctive relief**: the trial court gave injunctive relief and this was viewed for abuse of discretion. The court also holds that on remand the trial court needs to consider the injunctive relief 4 part test.

a)  Spamhouse cannot call Plaintiff a spammer w/o having clear and convincing evidence that P violated US law

    a.  this was not what was said on the website, so the standard of US law is arbitrary and excessive.

b)  Spamhouse cannot contact anyone about P being a spammer

    a.  Not fair, because P may become a spammer if not one today

c)  Spamhouse has to post a picture on its website saying P is not a spammer.

    a.  P may become a spammer tomorrow, so this would require them to have something going forward that was not true.

> Lastly court raises caution about injunctive relief for defamation bc of 1^st^ amendment jurisprudence.
>
> The court here, while giving deference finds flaws in the damages awards because there was no factual inquiries (what a trial court must do) and the logical implications of the injunctive relief were not in line with the pleadings, and could be illegal.

d.  **[Punitive Damages (Legal)]{.underline}**

**[Exxon v. Baker]{.underline}**:

- Aims of punitive damages is to compensate the plaintiff, punish and deter.

- TC awarded \$5Bn punitive damages (jury)

- Circuit court remanded, remitted down to \$2.5Bn

- SCOTUS: multiplier of 1:1

Unanswered question: can punitive damages be awarded at maritime law for viacarious liability. The court punts on this issue.

**Vicarious Liability in general:** SL applied through respondeat superior to the employer when the tort is done by the employee and when it is within the scope of employment.

Different than when the employer himself is negligent...this liability is not applied when the agent is a contractor and therefore the employer has no control over the worker and when the activity is outside the business scope.

**[State Farm v. Campbell]{.underline}**:

- Lower court: \$145MM PD's and small compensatory damages

- Judges lowered PD

- SCOTUS: multiplier should not be above single digits...145:1 is clearly excessive.

  - Applied BMW test to limit damages...Damages are grossly excessive when :1) degree of reprehensibility of the plaintiff 2) [the disparity between the actual or potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award; and 3) the difference between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases]{.mark}

  - Didn't make it a rule.

**[Philip Morris:]{.underline}**

- Awarded \$820,000 in CD and \$80MM in PD. Didn't follow State Farm b/c wasn't a Rule.

- Have to give instructions that say you can consider harms to non-party P's to gauge reprehensibility but can't include weight of that harm in damage amount.

  - But juries are human and will probably do this anyway!

<!-- -->

- **Aims:**

1.  **Deterrence** -- Forward Looking

    a.  Absorb cost to this P

    b.  Absorb cost of future P's/society

2.  **Punish** -- Backward Looking

    a.  How bad was behavior

- To this P

- To other P's

**[Pro-High Punitive Damages, In Light of Deterrence and Punish Aims]{.underline}** (**[Exxon]{.underline}**)

1.  Based on similar facts**:**

- **Deterrence**: Were other P's harmed, and will they be?

- **Punish**: What was D's motive? Did he take care to avoid harm to others? Will he?

  - B/c future P's/past P/s might not sue, have to make up for those

  - B/c high PD's might encourage future P's to sue!

  - Compensatory damages only make up for this specific P's losses

2.  Both tie damages to size of D:

- Damages in Exxon were only one year of global revenue.

<!-- -->

- If only compensatory damages, might not deter or punish D

3.  Some damages are hard to quantify and have to be made up with PD's

- Some things cant be quantified for Compensatory Damages, so are added to PD's

4.  Want to punish and deter not just for harm caused but also for motives/intent. Sometimes even want to punish "reasonable care" (like **[Pinto]{.underline}** case where Ford was found to weigh costs/benefits of peoples lives vs. redesigning vehicles).

> **[Against Excessive Damages]{.underline}** (**[State Farm]{.underline}**):

- **Concerns:** fairness, unnecessary, arbitrary. Juries have large discretion, no clear instructions, evidence of D's wealth skews perspectives

- **Reprehensibility**: shouldn't be allowed to take into account D's harm to others.

- **Juries** overcompensate by adding some punitive damages into compensatory damages

- **Due Process**: violates 14^th^ amendment right to notice if CD's are so huge

- **Inconsistent**: hurts legitimacy of the system

<!-- -->

- **[How to Limit Punitive Damages in light of Aims of Tort Law?]{.underline}**

  - **Words**:

    - Look at other states

    - Federal Statutes

    - What would criminal law give?

    - Phillip Morris just adjusted jury instructions regarding reprehensibility.

> \- *But words confuse judges and juries "shock the conscious"* (**[Exxon]{.underline}**)

- **Cap on \$:**

<!-- -->

- What have other courts awarded

> \- *But what number would we even pick? Is one fair across the board? While arbitrary is bad b/c people cant balance B = PL, too hard of a consistent number lets them do it easily, like in* **Pinto.** *Companies would use cap \$ as "cost of doing business." (***[Exxon]{.underline}**)

- **Multiplier Max:**

<!-- -->

- **[Exxon]{.underline}**: out of concern for admin and society, 1:1 multiplier is fairest option

- **[State Farm]{.underline}**: single digit ratio, based on:

  - Reprehensibility of D's actions\*

  - Disparity btw compensatory and punitive damages

  - Diff btw civil penalties in comparable cases

> \- *But where compensatory damages are low, D's win!* (Car accident, **[State Farm)]{.underline}***\*

- **Other countries:**

<!-- -->

- Internationally, much less PD's than US. Some don't award any.

<!-- -->

- **Historical Sources:**

<!-- -->

- Eye for an eye in Babylon, nothing more. Only compensatory.

<!-- -->

- **Reprehensibility:**

  - Physical or emotional harm?

  - Disregard for health/safety of others?

  - Repeated or isolated accident?

  - Intentional malice or accident?

e.  **Statutory Damages:**

> Three reasons for them

1.  Encourage suits that may have small amounts of damage because the set \#

2.  Speed up lawsuits/encourage settlement

3.  Create punitive damages

+================+=====================+====================================+=================================+

- **Substitute for Punitive damage issues:** instead of concern over charging huge PD's, just bring class action!

  - Forces D to absorb all the harm, and really only have to give compensatory damages

  - Because optimal deterrence should be achieved theoretically

**[Benefits of Class Actions]{.underline}**

- **Money:** P's able to get more \$\$, ensures first P doesn't clean out D, reduce discovery costs

- **Incentives:** incentivize lawyers through higher fees

- **Purpose:** makes more meaningful

- **Efficiency:** get it all done at once

- **Bargaining Power:** power in numbers; no one is suing for \$300 (posner)

- **Publicity:** to garner and discover more support; raise awareness of systematic practices

- **Injunctive Relief:** easier to ask for this if you represent a class of people

- **Gets rid of 'mooting out' problem:** if P dies or graduates from middle school

- **Impact/deterrence:** broader impact on D of damages if claims are aggregated

- **Global peace/Finality**: D able to have issue decided once and for all. Preclusive effect bars future individual lawsuits that are based on same claims

**[Against Class Actions]{.underline}**

- **Blackmail:** D's don't want to run the risk of huge damages so might mitigate once class is certified

- **+/- Settlement:** pejorative connotation, D faces huge set of damages, motivates him to settle cases even they aren't meritorious b/c potential damages or even litigation costs would be huge

- **Unfair:** possibility of al P's losing, even when merits of some cases could win

- **Control:** deprives class members of autonomy and control over their litigation

- **Due Process:** named parties representing unnamed people?

- **Collusions:** do benefits to attorneys outweigh those of claimants?

**[Federal Class Actions:]{.underline}** Rule 23

**Rule 23(a):** Prerequisites

\(1\) **Numerosity**: class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable (but no set #)

> \(2\) **Commonality**: question of law or fact is common (not necessarily same events but patterns; do you get the same answer, can you settle it all with one stroke of the pen🡺Scalia in Dukes)
>
> \(3\) **Typicality**: claims/defenses of represented parties are typical of those of class

- Due process: to make sure interests are adequately represented

> \(4\) **Representativeness**: fair and adequate protection of class' interests

- No conflict of interests

- Evaluation of counsel

**Chose One or More**

- **23(b)(1)(B):** limited fund class action (mandatory)

  - Company would go bankrupt otherwise (asbestos)

- **23(b)(2):** Injunctive Class Action

- **23(b)(3):** \$ Opt-out Class Action

  - P wants as many people to join as possible, D wants to take care of it all at once

  - But some P's might have different interest and want to opt out

> \*\*\*you can't be in 3 and 2 at the same time (WalMart🡺can't get an injunction when there is an adequate remedy at law\*\*

**Litigation Class**:

1.  Files action

2.  Certifies class (depends on requirements above)

3.  Adversarial area happens up until:

4.  Want to Settle?

5.  Trial -- court needs to approve settlement to make sure it's fair for all

**Settlement Class:**

1.  Files action

2.  Settlement approval + Certification (23(e)) -- happen all at once. Have to be careful not to let it all bundle together. Still have to check certification requirements very closely

- **Concerns**:

<!-- -->

- No adversarial area where people can add in claims, argue issues, join in

**Amchem---**Asbestos limited fund settlement class.

District court certified and approved the settlement, but the supreme court reversed.

Conflicts between Present Plaintiffs, and Future Plaintiffs - court was not satisfied that the interests of all sub-groups of plaintiffs were adequately represented. Lack of commonality, typicality.

Variations of harm---everyone harmed in different ways, in different places

To what extent can this be solved by subcategorization

Since *[Amchem]{.underline},* Supreme Court is making it harder to certify class actions because it concerned with individualized issues in mass torts using federal rules of procedure.

**Repeat Punitive Damages Problem**

If each P receives punitive damage punishing underlying reprehensibility, D is paying punitive damage multiple times, and will be punished over and over again for the single act.

**Potential Solution**: Create subclasses. But then you lose some of the efficiency arguments. (posner)

- Note: concerns will differ depending on what class you have (maybe they can just opt out)

- Why not let Legislation do it?

- 

**[Compensation Class v. Punitive Damages Class]{.underline}**

- Not a problem for:

  - Civil Rights cases, where just asking for injunctions

  - Consumer Class actions where everyone was overcharged by same amount

- **Compensation Class**:

  - Don't apply punitive damages:

    - "In mass torts, \$ too varied and facts too varied." (Regarding P's)

    - optimal deterrence may have been achieved

**Class Actions**:

- Useful tool to bring together all P's and bind them.

- Takes care of compensation, deterrence, loss distribution

- Hard to accomplish!

  - Rule 23 raises bar to bring suit

  - Settlement Class Actions seemed to be the best way, but makes these hard too

- What would alternatives be?

  - **Multi-District Litigation**:

    - Take classes from diff. districts and consolidate into pre-trial evidentiary gathering.

    - Purpose: to aid with discovery costs; the vision that judge Posner had when it related to certifying a class and then separating it out once you've reached discovery

    - 2 Affects:

      - Encourages settlement

      - Bell weather trials

    - Bell Weather trials:

      - Should have opt out provisions (**BP**)

      - Should be non-binding, just use as estimates to see how causation plays out

      - 🡪 information benefits! Evidence shows these make difference: Judge Fallon article, in Merck, there were 6 bell weather trials, P only won 1, then Merk decided to settle for \$5Bn

      - Should have threshold acceptance for settlement (80%)

      - Should allow judge to decide ways to contract around court law

    - \^\^\^ looks like a Settlement Class Action! Except here the bell weather trials give adversarial area.

<!-- -->

- **Compensation Funds**

  - **9/11:** set up by **Congress** as package to protect Port Authority and airline industry.

    - **Pro:** congressionally established makes it (1) easier to administer, (2) legitimizes it (3) gets money to people fast

    - **Con:** (1) P's get damages but lose day in court (2) lose their expressive value of courts (3) limited claims are allowed (4) administration tasks can be difficult, like who should be the beneficiary (gay couples, divorce.)

<!-- -->

- **BP Claims Fund I:** Gulf fund set up by BP, they anchored the \$ amount

<!-- -->

- **Pro:** No preclusion, didn't have to opt out of right to sue.

- **Con:** (1) They set the amount of money! (2) Added condition that it should be allowed to keep drilling! What about deterrence?

<!-- -->

- **BP Claims Fund II:** result of settlement in MDL

<!-- -->

- **Pro:** (1) MDL added legitimacy to \$ amount that BP anchored, b/c Court said it was okay, and let amount be open ended, (2) Claimants had to show some tort law "causation" in order to claim, retains some aspects of tort law.

+===========================================+==================================================================================================================================================+===================================================+

**Repeat Punitive Damages**:

- **Problem:** Repeating PD's is an issue if courts aren't aware of others given before, given aims of Deterrence and Punishment. Not fair to keep charging for the same harm to society (**[Philip Morris]{.underline}**).

- **Or is it okay?** Are we just punishing for a "core badness" that's fair to keep adding? Does just the first P get to claim it? Not fair! **[Philip Morris]{.underline}** doesn't help us w/ this.

  - More P's show that harm was a big deal to society, so it's okay to keep giving PD's! (Like **[State Farm]{.underline}** saying we can take reprehensibility into account)

<!-- -->

- Some states say you can only apply once, or offset P2 with what P1 got.

- Should each P get PD = 10xCompensatory damages, like **State Farm** said?

- Class Actions:

  - Award more PD's because shows that there's so many people harmed

  - Judge Weinstein in Simon II:

    - Less PD's will be awarded b/c see people as group, not individuals

    - Less PD's will be awarded b/c we're starting with a limited fund.

2.  Reasonable care was exercised

3.  Unforeseeable

- **[Brown v. Kendall]{.mark}:** (dogs fighting, break up with stick and accidently hit P in eye)

  - **Lowered bar from extraordinary to** **ordinary care**

  - Burden of proof should lie on P to prove lack of ordinary care

  - Start of **contributory negligence** and shoved **N** into existence

  - D isn't liable unless P shows **(1) intentional harm** or **(2) D didn't take ordinary care**.

  - Jury Instructions incorrectly said D was @ fault unless can prove used extraordinary care.

- **[Bethel v. NYC Transit Authority]{.mark}:** (wheelchair accessible seat collapsed on bus, fixed 11 days prior)

  - shift from a SL regime for common carriers to a regular negligence standard because common carriers are no longer ultrahazardous like when this SL was applied

ii. **Affirmative Duty/Nonfeasance (Duty to act)**:

- **[Harper v. Herman]{.mark}:** Herman docked boat; Harper dove in 2 ft. water and sued for affirmative duty under special relationship -- only exist where (1) D has custody of P **AND** (2) P can't protect himself. Here, court said (2) wasn't met, so Herman was not liable. Knowledge of danger isn't enough to impose a liability.**\**

- **[Moch]{.mark}** (175): Water company didn't supply enough water to hydrant, fire burnt down P's warehouse

<!-- -->

- **Cardozo:** Denial of a benefit, not commission of a wrong.

i.  **No Duty (Lost Chance)**

- **[Strauss v. Belle Realty Co]{.mark}** (168): Strauss falls down Nly maintained stairs during blackout caused by Con Ed 🡪 sues building and Con Ed. Court says we must use **public policy** to limit Con Ed's duty, otherwise crushing burden and we all lose power.

<!-- -->

- Do not define duty by F or Privity of contract.

- Company could protect itself w/ insurance, but then **perverse incentive** not to take care. Is it even insurable in the first place?

- **Dissent**: but the more people hurt, the less chance of liability!

<!-- -->

- **[Cope v. Scott]{.mark}** (249): Scott hit Cope while driving. Cope sued Scott and National Park Service for (1) not maintaining roads properly and (2) not putting up proper signs.

<!-- -->

- Is govn't employee shielded from liability? Only if (1) action was specified by a manual or rule or (2) action was "fraught with policy judgment," of the type Congress would try to shield?

1.  **Road Signs**: no rule (manual too vague) or policy implications

2.  **Road Maintenance**: no rule but fraught with PP, so **govn't employee is protected, no duty**

- **[Tarasoff v. Uni. Of CA]{.mark}** (151): Dr. Moore of school was treating Poddar, who told him he wanted to kill Tatiana, then he did. Was detained, released, then killed her. Parents sue for not warning her, say **Doctor had a duty to warn**.

- **[MTA Commuter RR v. Buckley]{.mark}** (268): RR worker Nly exposed to asbestos, but no symptoms. Can he recover for emotional distress? Does exposure to 'asbestos dust' constitute physical impact needed in **[Falzone]{.underline}**? **NO.\**

- **[Ayers v. Norfolk and Western Railway]{.mark}** (274): P able to recover for fear of future cancer caused by asbestos since it already caused him non-malignant respiratory problems, since emotional distress was **"genuine and serious."**

<!-- -->

- (Reiterated in **[Potter]{.underline}** \[274\], especially if there's **sufficient proof** of future harm).

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

- No physical or property harm, no economic damages.

ii. **Strict Liability\**

- **[Rylands v. Fletcher]{.mark}** (507): Fletcher non-Nly made a reservoir that flooded P's property via coal mine. Though Fletcher took all necessary precautions and harm wasn't F, he was strictly liable for damages.

<!-- -->

- If you bring something onto your land that'd cause mischief if escapes, you're liable for damage it causes (**[Rylands I]{.underline}**)

<!-- -->

- If your use of land is non-natural, you're liable for harms to others (**[Rylands II]{.underline}**)

<!-- -->

- **[Losee v. Buchanan]{.mark}** (513): No liability when careful D's steam boiler exploded.

<!-- -->

- Concern with stunting industrial progress.

<!-- -->

**[Weighed R2d Standards]{.underline}**:

- Could have been easily prevented

- Liability wont affect activity levels, b/c have to ship through urban areas

**b. [Negligence\]{.underline}**

i.  **Failure to take "due" care\**

- **[Brown v. Kendall]{.mark}** (35): breaking up dogfight, Kendall accidently hit Brown w/ stick.

- **[Tedla v. Ellman]{.mark}** (77)**:** P struck by D's car while, breaking statute, she walked on wrong side of road with back to statute. But walking on right side of road would've been more dangerous, so she wasn't N.

<!-- -->

- **Don't have to follow statute if it causes more risk.**

iii. **Role of Custom\**

- **[TJ Hooper]{.mark}:** P shipped cargo on D's barges, sank during storm. D didn't have effective radio sets that could've received warning of storm. But custom is to have those radios 🡪 negligent.

- **Liable for not following custom.\**

- **[Trimarco v. Klein]{.mark}** (68): P fell through shower curtain of D's apartment building, custom was to replace w/ shatterproof glass.

**[N for not following custom if]{.underline}:**

1.  Well defined

2.  In same business so actor should've known

3.  Jury is satisfied w/ reasonableness of custom

c.  **[CAUSATION\]{.underline}**

<!-- -->

i.  **[Factual Causation/Actual Cause]{.underline}**

<!-- -->

A.  **"But for" Causation\**

- **[Stubbs v. Rochester]{.mark}** (334): Water system contaminated and P got typhoid.

<!-- -->

- **P only has to show w/ reasonably certainty that D's injury was the cause.**

<!-- -->

- **[Suchowicz v. US]{.mark}** (343): P claims death caused by overdose of prescription. Would appropriate dose have caused injury? Or did the N overdose cause the harm?

<!-- -->

- **Expert**: ruled out other causes

<!-- -->

- "Higher the dose, higher the risk of side effects." 🡪 self-proving causation

B.  **Multiple (& Potential) D's:\**

- **Matsuyama v. Birnbaum** (355): P's chance of survival was reduced by the N delayed diagnosis of the D. But P had 37% chance of survival pre-D's N, so but for D, still had bad chances.

  - **Lost Chance Doctrine:** P can recover for lost chance of survival, even if prior chance of recover was less than 50% before D's N. **\**

- **[Summers v. Tice]{.mark}** (367): Hunting trip, bullets fired, only one of them hit P. Which one?

<!-- -->

- Burden of proof on D's to show who was at fault, otherwise

<!-- -->

- **[Hymowitz v. Eli Lilly]{.mark}** (372): P's hurt by DES during their mothers' pregnancy. Damages were divided based on % of market share. **[\]{.underline}**

ii. **[Proximate or Legal Causation\]{.underline}**

- **[In re Polemis]{.mark}** (399): plank fell into hold where petrol exploded. D N caused plank to fall but explosion was totally unforeseeable.

<!-- -->

- And harm directly resulting is a proximate cause of D's N, even if totally unforeseeable

<!-- -->

- **[Kinsman]{.mark}** (431): Improperly moored boat drifted away, crashed into another, those crashed into a bridge, which collapsed and blocked the river, which flooded nearby land.

  - **Kinsman I:** owner of boat that was hit was able to recover since damage was F

  - **Kinsman II:** owners of other boats that were blocked in the river could not recover.

- **[Wagon Mound]{.mark}** (402): D's N caused oil spill, which set fire to P's dock. It was only foreseeable that oil would make dock slippery.

- **[Palsgraf v. LIRR]{.mark}** (418): guy w/ box of fireworks, when servant helps him on train he knocks it out of hands, it explodes and scale falls on P.

<!-- -->

- Harm and Victim were not foreseeable, so no proximate cause.

<!-- -->

- **[Gibson v. Garcia]{.mark}** (408): P clamed D (LA Transit) let pole on main road deteriorate to point that when N driver hit it, it fell onto P.

<!-- -->

- D is not liable when injury was caused by superseding cause (the N driver).

<!-- -->

- **[Hines v. Morrow]{.mark}** (416): Service truck went to tow car stuck in mud whole. P got peg-leg stuck in hole, was injured. Claimed D negligently maintained the roads.

<!-- -->

- **[Phan Son Van v. Pena]{.mark}** (417): gang got alcohol from D, got drunk and raped/killed 2 girls.

<!-- -->

- D not liable for murder, since the harm was unF to him at the time.

Federal Preemption:

There are three kinds of preemption: Expressed, Field, and Conflict (the last two being derivatives of Implied Preemption)

**When Congress chooses to expressly preempt state law, the only question for courts becomes determining whether the challenged state law is one that the federal law is intended to preempt.  Implied preemption presents more difficult issues, at least when the state law in question does not directly conflict with federal law.  The Court then looks beyond the express language of federal statutes to determine whether Congress has \"occupied the field\" in which the state is attempting to regulate, or whether a state law directly conflicts with federal law, or whether enforcement of the state law might frustrate federal purposes.**

**Federal \"occupation of the field\" occurs, according to the Court in *Pennsylvania v Nelson* (1956), when there is \"no room\" left for state regulation.  Courts are to look to the pervasiveness of the federal scheme of regulation, the federal interest at stake, and the danger of frustration of federal goals in making the determination as to whether a challenged state law can stand.**

In order to limit the otherwise potential infinite liability which would follow every negligent act, the law of torts holds defendant amenable only for injuries to others which to defendant at the time were reasonably foreseeable.

In the absence of 'overriding policy considerations \* \* \* foreseeability of risk (is) of \* \* \* primary importance in establishing the element of duty.' (Grafton v. Mollica (1965) 231 Cal.App.2d 860, 865, 42 Cal.Rptr. 306, 310. See also McEvoy v. American Pool Corp. (1948) 32 Cal.2d 295, 195 P.2d 783; Hergenrether v. East (1964) 61 Cal.2d 440, 39 Cal.Rptr. 4, 393 P.2d 164.) As a classic opinion states: 'The risk reasonably to be perceived defines the duty to be obeyed.' (Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co. (1928) 248 N.Y. 339, 344, 162 N.E. 99, 100.) Defendant owes a duty, in the sense of a potential liability for damages, only with respect to those risks or hazards whose \*\*\*80 \*\*920 likelihood made the conduct unreasonably dangerous, and hence negligent, in the first instance. (See Keeton, Legal Cause in the Law of Torts (1963) 18---20; Seavey, Mr. Justice Cardozo and the Law of Torts (1939) 52 Harv.L.Rev. 372; Seavey, Principles of Torts (1942) 56 Harv.L.Rev. 72.)

Harper and James state the prevailing view. The obligation turns on whether 'the offending conduct foreseeably involved unreasonably great risk of harm to the interests of someone other than the actor. \* \* \* (T)he obligation to refain from \* \* \* particular conduct is owed only to those who are foreseeably endangered by the conduct and only with respect to those risks or hazards whose likelihood made the conduct unreasonably dangerous. Duty, in other words, is measured by the scope of the risk which negligent conduct foreseeably entails

[Dillon v. Legg]{.underline}, 68 Cal. 2d 728, 739, 441 P.2d 912, 919-20 (1968)

the existence and scope of a tortfeasor\'s duty is, of course, a legal question for the courts, which "fix the duty point by balancing factors, including the reasonable expectations of parties and society generally, the proliferation of claims, the likelihood of unlimited or insurer-like liability, disproportionate risk and reparation allocation, and public policies affecting the expansion or limitation of new channels of liability" ([*Hamilton v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp.,* [96 N.Y.2d 222, 727 N.Y.S.2d 7, 750 N.E.2d 1055]{.underline}](https://a.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2001341580&pubNum=578&originatingDoc=I637c45bedbe611d98ac8f235252e36df&refType=RP&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Search)) \[quoting [*Palka v. Servicemaster **\*289** Mgt. Servs. Corp.,* [83 N.Y.2d 579, 586, 611 N.Y.S.2d 817, 634 N.E.2d 189\]]{.underline} *).*](https://a.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1994101514&pubNum=578&originatingDoc=I637c45bedbe611d98ac8f235252e36df&refType=RP&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Search)) At its foundation, the common law of torts is a means of apportioning risks and allocating the burden of loss. In drawing lines defining actionable duty, courts must therefore always be mindful of the consequential, and precedential, effects of their decisions.

[^1]: But if rule is specified ex ante, difficult to specify boundaries (ex: try to list all adult-like activities)...Rules often blur back into standards once things occur that weren't considered when the rule was created.
