>
> *Daniels v. Clegg (Mich 1873) Handout: **OLD because of plaintiff's age and sex, she is not subjected to contributory negligence -- ordinary young woman standard, not general person** 12*

D. Judges and Juries, Rules vs. Standards 12

> *RULES VS. STANDARDS 12*
>
> *Judge vs. Jury 13*
>
> *Interpreting Reasonable Care 13*
>
> *Baltimore & Ohio RR Co. v. Goodman (US Sup Ct 1927) 60: [Holmes Rule]{.underline}**: a driver needs to take every possible precaution, including getting out of a car, to see a RR coming** 14*
>
> *Pokora v. Wabash Railway Co. (US Sup Ct 1934) 62: [Cardozo Standard]{.underline}**: Since getting out of a car at a RR crossing is an uncommon precaution, contributory negligence here depends on context and circumstances, and we should leave it up to the jury to decide if it is reasonable** 14*
>
> *Andrews v. United Airlines (9^th^ circuit 1994) 65: **Even within a duty of utmost care, def's negligence must be understood to be reasonably exercised consistent with practical operation of business** 14*
>
> *Byrne v. Boadle (Court of exchequer Eng 1863) 90: **when an accident speaks for itself, you can derive negligence from def's property; [Res Ipsa Loquitor]{.underline}: if an accident happens that couldn't usually happen without negligence, the burden of proof shifts to the def to prove non-negligence (when the burden is normally on plaintiff to prove negligence**) 15*
>
> *McDougald v. Perry (FL sup ct 1998) 92**: Res ipsa loquitor applies even in rare instances: the fact that the accident occurred, along with a showing of an immediate precipitating cause, permits the inference of negligence**. 15*

E. Custom 15

> *The TJ Hooper (2nd circuit CA, 1932): **When a new technology is so extensive and** 16*
>
> ***universal in custom, there is a duty of reasonable prudence to use it even though it's not required by statute** 16*
>
> *Trimarco v. Klein (NY Ct. of Appeals 1982) 68: **Although custom and practice are relevant to whether or not one has acted with due care, it remains a jury question whether one has acted with due care under particular circumstances** 16*
>
> *Negligence Per Se -- an act is considered negligent because it violates a statute (speed limit, building code) 16*
>
> *Martin v. Herzog (NY Ct of Appeals 1920) 71: **Where a party has been negligent per se, in order for that party to be liable there also must be causation and damages. Negligence alone is not enough** 17*
>
> *Tedla v. Ellman (NY Ct of Appeals 1939) 77: **Even if plaintiffs violate a statute, there is no negligence per se when violating it prevents further danger as an exception, and the cause of accident was because of the defendant; and statute was not designed to protect these plaintiffs** 17*

**III. Causation 17**

Overview of Types of Causation 17

Cause in Fact 20

> *Stubbs v. City of Rochester (NY Ct of Appeals 1919) 334: **If more than one possible causes of harm exist, and the defendant would be liable for one of them, the plaintiff must establish with reasonable certainty that the cause of the injury was the one for which the defendant was liable** 20*

Funky Liability outside of direct causation 20

> *Zuchowicz v. US (2nd Circ 1998) 343: **when you cannot use a causal direct but-for test, you can use the substantial factor test: if several causes could have caused the harm, any cause that was a substantial factor is held liable (shifts burden to def) -- DON'T USE** 20*
>
> *Matsuyama v. Birnbaum (Mass Sup Ct 2008) 355: **when you cannot use but-for test with a terminally ill patient, you can apply a lost chance doctrine, which calculates decrease in plaintiff's lost chance of living absent defendant's negligence** 21*
>
> *Ravo v. Rogatnick (NY 1987) 365: **when tortfeasors' actions cause a joint harm (even if you cannot tell who caused what harm), then there is "joint enterprise" liability among them for the damages** 21*
>
> *Summers v. Tice (Calif Sup ct 1948) 367: **in order to get around but-for loophole with two possible joint tortfeasors, courts will hold both defendants liable and put burden on defendants for liability between themselves** 21*
>
> *Dillon v. Twin State Gas - notes 370: **Court will sometimes apply but-for test and find for defendant and reduce awards; with boy who slips off landing and then gets electrocuted by exposed wire, jury found he would be killed anyway** 21*
>
> *Hymowitz v. Eli Lylly & Co (NY Ct of Appeals 1989) 372: **especially when injury is dormant, court will employ a Market Share Liability determination to defendant companies (national); shifts burden to def** 22*

Proximate Cause / Scope of Liability 22

> ∙ *Abraham on Prox Cause 22*
>
> o *Foreseeable Extent of Harm (thin skull rule) -- does not matter 23*
>
> *In re Polemis (British Court of Appeal KB 1921) 399: **a defendant's negligence can still be the proximate cause of an unforeseeable harm, so long as harm was a "direct" consequence of def's negligence; negligence can be enough** 24*
>
> *The Wagon Mound Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v. Mort's Dock & Engineering Co. LTD (UK Privy Council 1961) 402: **overturns Polemis limits negligence only standard with foreseeability: even if plaintiff's property is injured as a direct result of def's negligence, when it is an unforeseen consequence, you may not have liability** 25*
>
> *Palsgraf v. LIRR Co. (NY Ct of Appeals 1928) 418: **A defendant owes a duty of care only to those who are in the reasonably foreseeable zone of danger, which must be determined from the risk that can reasonably be foreseen under the circumstances** 25*
>
> *Kinsman Case (2nd Circ 1964) 430: **when the timing of negligence will foreseeably cause further reasonable damage, you can infer causation; under proximate cause, the property owners adjacent to the river could sue (Kinsman I), but not the owners of the boats or the cargoes which could not move until the river was reopened for business (Kinsman II**) 26*

**IV. Defenses 27**

Negligence Regimes 27

> *Contributory negligence 27*
>
> *Comparative Negligence 27*
>
> ∙ *Comp Neg and Joint and Several Liability Possibilities 27*
>
> *Li v. Yellow Cab (Calif. Sup Ct 1975) Handout: **California Court shifts from contributory to pure comparative negligence regime because it is a better and fairer system** 28*
>
> *Assumption of Risk 29*
>
> *The Flopper: Murphy v. Steeplechase Amusement Co. (NY Ct of Appeals 1929) 470: **there is an implied assumption of risk to a plaintiff who takes on a dangerous activity or sport** 30*
>
> *Davenport v. Cotton Hope Plantation Horizontal Property Regime (Sup Ct South Carolina 1998) 475: **a plaintiff is not barred from recovery by the doctrine of assumption of risk unless the degree of fault arising therefrom is greater than the negligence of the defendant (comp neg regime)** 30*
>
> *Calabresi on Causation/Risk 30*

Coase Theorem 32

**V. Duty 32**

Affirmative Obligations to Act/Warn 33

> *Harper v. Herman (Sup Ct Minnesota 1993) 131: **a special relationship requiring an affirmative duty to act only exist when plaintiff was deprived of normal opportunities to protect himself; actual knowledge of a condition is insufficient itself to impose liability** 34*
>
> *Tarasoff v. Regents of Univ. of Calif. (Calif Sup Ct 1976) 151: **Because of a special relationship between doctor and patient, we will extend affirmative duty to act to third parties when they are in danger (foreseeability is important)** 34*
>
> *In re NYC Asbestos Litigation (NY 2005): **employer had no duty to employee's spouse for asbestos "taken home" by employee (though NJ Court disagreed)** 34*

Sovereign Immunity and No Duty 34

> *Strauss v. Belle Realty Co. (NY Ct of Appeals 1985) 168: **with a quasi-public important institution as Con Ed, the Court will limit its negligence duty to privity relationships because the consequences of opening litigation are too grave** 35*
>
> *Moch case -- **Cardozo failed to find liability for the water supply company when a building caught on fire, because there was no duty; misfeasance vs. nonfeasance: failure to provide a public benefit (water supply) is not the same as the commission of a wrong); liability would be unduly extended if we found a duty** 35*
>
> *Cope v. Scott (DC Circuit 1995) 249: **in order to be exempt from the FTCA, the gov't needs to show that a purportedly "discretionary function" activity is susceptible to a policy, economic, political, or social judgment choices. The decision of when and where to place signage on a dangerous road does not implicate these choices** 36*
>
> *Riss v. City of New York: (NY Ct of Appeals 1968): **the Court will not carve out an area of tort liability for the city absent specific legislation even when the police do not adequately "protect" someone seeking help** 36*
>
> *Schuster v. City of NY (notes 232): **Small exception to Riss; Court sustained plaintiff's claim that police were under a legal duty to respond reasonably to plaintiff's request for protection since the police made use of a private citizen (he was an informant)** 36*
>
> *Sorichetti v. City of NY (1985 notes 232): **court imposed duty on police officers to act on preventing abusive father; distinguished from Riss on basis of protective orders, history of violent behavior, and front desk assurance somebody would help** 36*
>
> *Cuffy v. City of NY (notes): **there is generally no tort duty to provide police protection, but there is an exception when there exists a special relationship** 37*

Emotional Harm 38

> *Falzone v. Busch (NJ Sup Ct 1965) 260: **no longer need physical impact; Zone of danger: when negligence created the potential but not the occurrence for physical harm, and emotional harm as manifest symptoms, it can go to the jury** 40*
>
> *Metro-North v. Buckley (US Up Ct 1997) 268: **plaintiffs can only recover for emotional harm if he manifests symptoms of a disease, not solely on the possibility that he may develop the disease later on** 40*
>
> *Ayres (notes): **Court allowed workers suffering from non-malignant respiratory disease to recover under FELA for emotional distress on idea they might contract cancer in the future provided it was genuine and serious** 41*
>
> *Potter v. Firestone (notes): **Since plaintiffs faced enhanced but quantified risk of developing cancer in future (serious and medical opinion), they can recover against defs who dump toxic wastes into a landfill and exposed plaintiffs to carcinogens over a prolonged period** 41*

Economic Harm 41

> *532 Madison Ave. v. Finlandia (NY Ct of Appeals 2001) 310: **Foreseeability of harm does not define a duty -- it must arise from a special relationship; a special relationship of a landowner does not owe a duty to the general public to protect them from economic harm; no liability for pure economic loss** 41*

**VI. Strict Liability 41**

> *Rylands v. Fletcher (Exchequer Chamber 1866) 507: **non-natural use of land induces SL: when you keep something that is likely to cause harm if it escapes, you are strictly liable if it does escape (even if you inspected it and had no knowledge)** 42*
>
> *Indiana Harbor Belt RR v. American Cyanmid (7th Circ 1990) 521: **Posner: when negligence is possible and you can affect the "care levels" of a material, you do not apply strict liability** 42*
>
> *2^nd^ Restatement SL test: (BE SURE TO STILL ADDRESS CAUSATION) 43*
>
> *3^rd^ Restatement SL: "abnormally dangerous" if activity creates a risk even when care does not mitigate risk; it is not common 43*
>
> *Benefits of SL vs. Negligence Chart 43*

Theoretical Perspectives of Strict Liability (Posner, Rabin and King) 45

**VII. Conversion, Trespass, Nuisance 45**

Trespass 45

> *Martin v. Reynolds Metals Co (Oregon Sup Ct 1959) 676: **there was a trespass on plaintiff's land for the reason the actual deposit of "unseen things" caused his land to be unfit for the cattle he was trying to raise there; trespass and nuisance can exist concurrently; all you need is a feeling of exclusive possession** 46*
>
> *Private necessity 46*
>
> *Defenses to Trespass (Abraham) 46*
>
> o *Ploof v. Putnam, **when def's servant untied a family's boat from a dock -- court found there was necessity to use the dock and did not constitute trespass, def did not have right to exclude from dock** 46*
>
> *Vincent v. Lake Erie Transportation Co (Minn sup Ct 1910) 958: **you can trespass on to another person's property out of private necessity, but you are still liable for damages you cause to the dock (as destruction was not necessary)** 47*
>
> *Policy -- Who should be liable in Trespass? 47*

Nuisance 48

> *Private Nuisance 48*
>
> *Boomer v. Atlantic Cement Co (NY Ct of Appeals 1970) 683: **When a nuisance is of such a permanent and uneatable nature that a single recovery can be had, the Court will allow for damages (future), but not grant an injunction because of the public policy reasons against granting it; cost of discontinuing nuisance (in jobs and dollars) is grossly disproportionate to amount of harm nuisance was harming** 49*

Conversion 50

> *Moore v. Regents of UC (Calif ct of appeal/sup ct) Handout**: Calif Sup Ct failed to find conversion when UC profited on discarded cells from surgery because Moore discarded his cells afterwards and valued relevant policy considerations of finding conversion** 51*
>
> *Kremen v. Cohen (9th circ 2003): **Court found that an internet domain name (intangible property) satisfied property criteria primarily because registering a domain name is exclusive, and because registering a domain name informs others that domain name is no one else's, therefore conversion** 51*
>
> *Intel v. Hamdi (Calif Sup Ct 2003) Handout: **In this case, electronic communication does not constitute an actionable trespass to chattels as to personal property (the computer system) because it does not interfere with the use or possession of, or any other legally protected interest in, the personal property itself.** 52*

Injunctions and Trespass 52

> *EBay v. Merchexchange LLC (Sup Ct 2006) Handout: **Court establishes factor test for granting injunction** 52*

**VIII. Damages and Remedies 53**

Compensatory Damages 53

> *Seffert v. Los Angeles Transit Lines (Calif Sup Ct 1961) 711: **example of high compensatory damages that were upheld on appeal because of severity of injury; did not shock the conscience of the court** 54*

Punitive Damages 54

> *Exonn Shipping v. Baker (Sup Ct 2008) Handout**: in federal maritime cases, Souter believes it is appropriate to cap punitive damages at a 1:1 ratio with compensatory damages** 57*
>
> *State Farm v. Campbell (US Sup Ct 2003) 760: **single digit ratio is most usually appropriate when considering punitive damages; 145:1 is a DP violation** 57*
>
> *WR Grace & Co v. Waters -- **repetitive awards and asbestos -- court refused to bar multiple awards of punitive damages and put a limit on punitive damage claims just because the company would be repeatedly charged for the same claims by various plaintiffs because of the company\'s own negligence** 57*
>
> *Philip Morris USA v. Williams (Sup Ct 2006) Handout: **when considering punitive damages under DP, you cannot consider \[alleged\] harm to 3^rd^ parties ("Strangers to the litigation") as its own prong (though you may consider it peripherally in relation to the degree of reprehensibility)** 57*
>
> *Grimshaw v. Ford (Pinto case 1972): **Court upheld very high punitive damage ratio (1:75) because Ford distributed a memo which put value on human life in relation to lower safety standards** 58*

Class Actions and Settlement Classes 58

# High Level Overview

**Big Concepts**

1.  Rules v. Standards

2.  Aims of Tort law

    a.  Compensation for civil recourse when someone is wronged (corrective justice)

    b.  Punishment for bad defs (over-punishment)

    c.  Loss-spreading

    d.  Wealth redistribution

    e.  Optimal Deterrence and Risk creation-- too much or too little? *Perverse* incentives

    f.  Fairness

    g.  Burden shifting

    h.  Administrative Ease / Fraud / Floodgates

    i.  Redress for social grievances (populist mechanism)

    j.  Moral Luck elements

3.  Who decides -- *judge/jury*, *court/legislature*

**Four Elements of Tort Case**

1.  Duty

    a.  Judge usually decides this as a matter of law

    b.  Standard duty of reasonable care

    c.  Affirmative duty

    d.  Strict Liability (restatements)

2.  Breach ("negligence")

    a.  B\<PL Learned Hand

    b.  Subjective vs. Objective -- what is reasonable?

    c.  Judge v. Jury (reasonable person finds breach v. matter of fact for jury to decide)

    d.  Negligence per se

    e.  Custom

3.  Causation

    a.  Factual Causation

        i.  But-for, MSC, MNC

        ii. Also consider, market-share, loss chance

    b.  Proximate Cause/Scope of risk

        i.  You need to factual causation too

4.  Damages

    a.  Emotional Harm (questions of fraud, opening floodgates/Asbestos, impact rule vs. zone of danger)

    b.  Economic harm

    c.  Compensatory vs. Injunctive vs. Punitive

    d.  Class actions and PD certification

**Defenses**

- Contributory vs. comparative negligence

- Assumption of risk (express, implied primary and secondary) - LOOK AT HOW THIS INTERSECTS WITH COMPARATIVE NEG REGIMES

- Immunity -- FTCA and Municipal

**Trespass**

- Trespass, nuisance, conversion, trespass to chattels

- LOOK OUT FOR **LAND** TO APPLY THIS

**Class Actions**

- Problems for mass torts and punitive damages settlement classes

- Alternatives to CAs

# I. INTRODUCTION

Abramson general Intro

- Tort - wrong not arising out of contract" -- too simple def

- Two categories

  - Accident law -- imposes strict liability (no regard to degree of care of def) or negligence liability (physical/bodily injury; only on proof of carelessness)

  - Intentional torts

    - No liability of negligence, but on proof of def's intention to invade legally protected interest of another

- Four US fundamental features

1.  Jury Trial

2.  Liability Insurance -- increased industrialization led to more liability, and insurance

3.  Contingency Fee System -- plaint's attorneys take cases on a contingent-fee basis

4.  "American Rule" for Costs - each side pays his own costs, not just the loser, so plaintiffs are less discouraged from bringing suit

*Hammontree v. Jenner (Cal. Ct of Appeals 1971): **An actor facing sudden incapacitation is only negligent if the incapacitation was reasonably foreseeable; Driver who is epileptic (but treated) is not liable for damages he causes while crashing his car during a fit because he wasn't negligent and we're not going to hold drivers strictly liable***

- We're not going to impose the same standard of liability as manufacturing defects as there is no public good distribution here

- Problems with exceptions if we ruled the other way: sudden illnesses

- It's the legislature's job, not our job

- No negligence because def met all requirements (doctors, meds, approved by DMV)

- Types of possible arguments:

  - Fairness (he exercised all precautions)

  - Costs (to def in not driving, changing behavior, social values, danger of continued driving and unknown risk)

  - Administrative DMV)

  - Incentives/deterrence

# II. Negligence

- Negligence: the failure to exercise reasonable care to avoid injury or damage to another person or property.

## A. History of Fault (injury is not enough)

*Brown v. Kendal (Mass Sup Ct 1850) 35: **When a Defendant unintentionally injures another while undertaking a lawful act, the Plaintiff must prove that the Defendant acted without due care as adapted to the exigencies of the circumstances.***

- Dogs are fighting and defendant backs up and pokes plaintiff in eye

- Plaintiff must show that intention was unlawful and def was at fault (burden of proof on plaintiff)

- The requisite standard of ordinary care is the same for accidental injuries resulting from lawful actions, whether the actions are characterized as necessary, or merely permissible

## B. Standard of Care (reasonable care) 

![](media/image4.png){width="5.194444444444445in" height="3.0416666666666665in"}

*Adams v. Bullock (NY Ct of Appeals 1919) 39: **when defendant takes adequate precautions given the limitations and context of its product, you cannot impose liability; there is a duty to adopt (only) reasonable care***

- 12 y/o boy gets electrocuted after playing with wire on bridge and hits wires of trolley

- Only extraordinary effort could reach the wires; you cannot insulate them like electric wires

- Only a duty to adopt reasonable care (as it saves costs, foreseeable etc)

*US v. Carroll Towing Co. (US 2^nd^ Circuit 1947) 43: **Owner of a barge may be liable for being absent when a barge breaks free and harms other barges depending on custom. LEARNED HAND FORUMA: If liable, owner's duty is typified by (1) The probability of the kind of incident in question; (2) the gravity of the resulting injury; and (3) the burden of adequate precautions. If B \< PL, then standard of care is not met***

- Bargee should have been on the barge, but was not and it hit another barge causing cargo of US to sink

- Threshold for reasonable care: If Burden is greater than Probability x Injury (L)

- PARTIES WILL DISAGREE ABOUT HOW THEY FRAME THE BURDEN, SO DISCUSS FRAMING THE **[BURDEN]{.underline}** [DIFFERENTLY]{.underline}

- Custom should determine if bargee's absence is permissible (but here he was away for 21 hours, so no excuse) in a crowded harbor in war time and thus he should have been aboard during daytime working hours

*Abraham 68 Negligence Calculus*

- Negligence Calculus -- circumstances under which a reasonable person would risk ham or would instead take steps to reduce risk

  - 1\) probability that act or omission with cause harm

  - 2\) magnitude of that harm if it occurs

  - 3\) value of interest that must be forgone or sacrificed in order to reduce risk of harm

## C. Reasonable Person 

![](media/image3.png){width="7.125in" height="4.208333333333333in"}

*Bethel v. NYC Transit Authority (NY Ct of Appeals 1998) 49***: *Court can redefine standard of care (here from utmost to reasonable) when old standard of care is no longer contemporarily applicable***

- Plaintiff is hurt on def's bus when wheelchair accessible seat collapsed and argues for "utmost" standard of care (past 100 years) which says that carriers must exercise utmost standard of care

- Court rejects this standard (because it was enacted in accident-prone RR time) in favor of reasonable person standard because it is now flexible enough for juries:

  - Takes in to account reasonably perceivable risk and gravity of harm to others

  - Provides leeway for due allowance to be made for particular circumstance

- Question of tailoring: how much tailoring do you want?

*Daniels v. Clegg (Mich 1873) Handout: **OLD because of plaintiff's age and sex, she is not subjected to contributory negligence -- ordinary young woman standard, not general person***

- Young woman gets into buggy accident; court finds for plaintiff woman because she is held to her own standard, you shouldn't have expected the same care as an ordinary man driving the horse

*Little Rock v. Tankersly (Ark. 1890) Handout: **OLD**: **reverse of Daniels: your sex (woman and wearing a big dress) can require you to take greater care***

- Jury can be instructed as to a woman's age, sex, attire as they affected woman's safety in stepping out from a moving train (young man is different)

*Courts will reject a standard of care that is **too vague** (Vaughan v. Menlove (England 1837) fire damage case; court rejects a new standard sought by def: "acting at his best judgment standard)"*

*Roberts v. Ramsbottom (England 1980) Note 8 55: **Anything other than total loss of consciousness avoids liability; man who suffered stroke but still aware of surroundings is liable***

*Benefits of objective reasonable person standard*

- Costs/Efficiency, Incentives/Deterrence, and Fairness.

- Does not require jury to engage in psychology.

- Easier to communicate to the below-average individual the kind of actions he is accountable for.

- Policy Argument: Objective Standard gives the public assurance that those whose actions they are exposed to will either have predictable level of care, or actor will be liable for failure to do so

## D. Judges and Juries, Rules vs. Standards

- Reasonable vs. Rational

  - Rational -- instrumental rationality (it is rational for me to steal from you if you have something I want and I think I won't get caught)

    - Doesn't take the interests of others into account

  - Reasonable goes beyond instrumental rationality -- it may be rational for me to steal from you, but unreasonable to do so

    - Takes interests of others into account

    - Reasonable person (objective) vs. reasonably intoxicated/disabled person (subjective)

*RULES VS. STANDARDS*

- **Rules** are the most constraining and rigid. Once a rule has been interpreted and the facts have been found, then the application of the rule to the facts decides the issue to which it is relevant (unless the case falls within the penumbra of a rule with vague content). (ex, 4 year olds can be sued for negligence reasonable for her age and intellect)

- **Standards** provide an intermediate level of constraint. Standards guide decisions but provide a greater range of choice or discretion; standards define a set of mandatory considerations.

- **Principles** are even less constraining. Principles provide mandatory considerations for judges. Whereas, standards identify an exhaustive set of considerations for adjudication or policy making, a principle identifies a nonexhaustive set, leaving open the possibility that other considerations may be relevant to the decision.

[Emergency exceptions]{.underline}: in some states, different standard of negligence applied when you're in an emergency situation (but many states have eliminated these emergency standards because reasonable care incorporates emergency concern)

*Judge vs. Jury*

- Restatement (Third) § 8 -- when reasonable minds can differ as to facts relating to actor's conduct, function of jury to determine those facts

  - Also when reasonable minds can differ as to whether conduct lacks reasonable care, for jury

- When there is only one reasonable conclusion, the judge should direct a verdict

- Otherwise, the judge generally only determines whether a duty exists and what the law is

- Occasionally, the need for a clear and stable answer to the question of negligence is so overwhelming that a court may withdraw the negligence evaluation from the jury

- Juries, many of whom have been airline passengers, will be well equipped to determine whether the airline should have done more than warn about the possibility of falling baggage (Andrews)

### Interpreting Reasonable Care

![](media/image6.png){width="6.819444444444445in" height="4.166666666666667in"}

*Baltimore & Ohio RR Co. v. Goodman (US Sup Ct 1927) 60: [Holmes Rule]{.underline}**: a driver needs to take every possible precaution, including getting out of a car, to see a RR coming***

- Holmes found for defs because plaintiff [was contributorily negligent for not stopping and looking and getting out of his car when crossing train track]{.mark}

*Pokora v. Wabash Railway Co. (US Sup Ct 1934) 62: [Cardozo Standard]{.underline}**: Since getting out of a car at a RR crossing is an uncommon precaution, contributory negligence here depends on context and circumstances, and we should leave it up to the jury to decide if it is reasonable***

- Cardozo believes this situation is too tailored for a clear cut rule, so you have to ask a jury what a reasonable person would do in those circumstances

+========================================================================================+=====================================================================================================================================+

*Andrews v. United Airlines (9^th^ circuit 1994) 65: **Even within a duty of utmost care, def's negligence must be understood to be reasonably exercised consistent with practical operation of business***

- Kozinski finds for plaintiff who was injured when at landing gate when luggage fell on his head and overturns SJ for def

- United has a heightened duty of utmost care for slightest negligence; there were previous injuries reported -- United hasn't taken extra precautions (nets) as some airlines have done) and a jury could find either way

*Byrne v. Boadle (Court of exchequer Eng 1863) 90: **when an accident speaks for itself, you can derive negligence from def's property; [Res Ipsa Loquitor]{.underline}: if an accident happens that couldn't usually happen without negligence, the burden of proof shifts to the def to prove non-negligence (when the burden is normally on plaintiff to prove negligence**)*

- Barrels don't just fall out of shop windows by themselves so the fact that the accident took place is enough to show negligence.

- Because Barrel was custody of def -- he is responsible

- Plaintiff is not required to show that it could not fall without negligence, but if there are any facts inconsistent with negligence, the def must prove them

*McDougald v. Perry (FL sup ct 1998) 92**: Res ipsa loquitor applies even in rare instances: the fact that the accident occurred, along with a showing of an immediate precipitating cause, permits the inference of negligence**.*

- Spare tire would not have come loose had the Defendant exercised reasonable care when inspecting his vehicle and therefore Res Ipsa Loquitur applies and the Defendant is liable

- things do not usually happen unless someone has been negligent -- that's where res ipsa loquitor: This escape of tire would not occur but for the failure to exercise reasonable care by person in control of tire

- Res ipsa loquitur properly applies: (1) evidence was in the control of the defendant; (2) common experience suggests that accidents of this type do not occur except when the person in control is negligent; (3) plaintiff is not required to eliminate all other possible causes; (4) res ipsa loquitur can apply even if direct evidence is available

## E. Custom

![](media/image5.png){width="6.063888888888889in" height="2.325in"}

*The TJ Hooper (2nd circuit CA, 1932): **When a new technology is so extensive and***

***universal in custom, there is a duty of reasonable prudence to use it even though it's not required by statute***

- Because boats were not equipped with radios that would have told them of impending storm, they didn't fulfill duty to have them based on universal customary practice, especially when utility outweighs the cost -- reasonable prudence

- "Custom is **probative**, but not dispositive"

*Trimarco v. Klein (NY Ct. of Appeals 1982) 68: **Although custom and practice are relevant to whether or not one has acted with due care, it remains a jury question whether one has acted with due care under particular circumstances***

- Even with custom, adherence or non-adherence thereto is not conclusive proof of liability or innocence

- Proof of custom and practice coupled with evidence of adherence may establish due care

- Proof of existence of a custom and practice coupled with evidence showing failure to adhere may establish liability

![](media/image8.png){width="7.0in" height="2.4027777777777777in"}

*Negligence Per Se -- an act is considered negligent because it violates a statute (speed limit, building code)*

- Unlike ordinary negligence, a plaintiff alleging negligence per se need not prove that a reasonable person should have acted differently \-- the conduct is automatically considered negligent, and the focus of the suit will be over whether it proximately caused damage to the plaintiff

- When legislation enacts a statute to protect one type of person, and someone else is harmed by conduct, it's still negligence per se

- MAKE SURE THAT [PURPOSE]{.underline} OF STATUTE IS TO PREVENT THAT SPECIFIC TYPE OF HARM (Telda)

  - Minimum standards are different from negligence per se

- Law expects an independent assessment from a reasonable person given the circumstances

*Martin v. Herzog (NY Ct of Appeals 1920) 71: **Where a party has been negligent per se, in order for that party to be liable there also must be causation and damages. Negligence alone is not enough***

- Plaintiff was driving at night and def was driving on wrong side of road; Def claimed contributory negligence

- You cannot just be negligent -- you need to show that conduct led to injury incurred

- We'll respect legislature's rule of contributory negligence

*Tedla v. Ellman (NY Ct of Appeals 1939) 77: **Even if plaintiffs violate a statute, there is no negligence per se when violating it prevents further danger as an exception, and the cause of accident was because of the defendant; and statute was not designed to protect these plaintiffs***

- Brother and sister junk collectors could not walk on grass median because of wheels of cart, so they walked on road instead, in violation of stay to the center line statute, and were struck by car

- A violation of a statute does not always result in negligence per se

# III. Causation

## Overview of Types of Causation

- ALWAYS LOOK OUT FOR **CAUSATION IN FACT**, AND SEE IF THAT IS **DEBATABLE** (but for the negligent act, you would not have injury -- negligent act related to injury, not SL idea of having the dangerous thing in the first place)

- Factual Causation

<!-- -->

- 1\) but-for causation

  - counterfactual: if def had not done x, injury would not have occurred

  - reason for: we don't wan to punish people who didn't cause the injury

    - counter: butterfly effect, the chain goes back way far

- 2\) multiple sufficient causes

  - two fires scenario -- two people both cause an injury, and both of the their negligence would have been sufficient to cause the injury, they are both liable

  - not but for causation

  - reason for: intuitive -- you don't want a world where there is more negligence piling on and plaintiff gets less compensation -- just because here are two people doesn't negate plaintiff's need to be negated

  - If only one fire is negligently set (but arrive at the same time), some jurisdictions impose liability on the negligent actor only, while some do not (to give parties incentive to take precautions against harms that will occasionally occur anyway because of a simultaneous non-negligent cause)

  - *Restatement*: with MSC, which alone would have been the factual cause of harm at the same time in the absence of the other acts, then they are each the factual cause of the harm

- 3\) multiple necessary causes

  - a but-for test (both causes are but-for)

  - if 4 people all spill poison into their food while cooking, but eating one person's dish isn't sufficient to kill, but a plaintiff decides to sample all 4 dishes, and dies, there is multiple necessary causes

  - reason against: when you're doing actions you're not taking into account other people's negligence (this regime does not do anything)

  - Related to moral luck

- Funky Stuff outside of causation

  - Alternative Liability (not a causal test) -- Summers v. Tice, even if we know that only one def caused the harm, we'll hold both liable so plaintiff is not screwed

    - Imposing liability on negligent defendants, each of whom is equally likely ("as likely as not") to have harmed the plaintiff.

  - Market Share Liability

    - Requirements:

      - 1\) Identical Produce

      - 2\) "Relevant Market" (national, regional, local)?

      - Signature disease

    - Then All you need to show is that you've been harmed (shifts burden to defs)

  - Loss Chance

    - Usually limited to malpractice

    - Same as risk-creation suit --you cannot generally sue someone just for creating risk

    - When but-for doesn't work, you calculate loss chance by subtracting chance of surviving before negligence from chance of surviving after negligence

But for, sine qua non -- absent def's action, harm would not have occurred

- Counterfactual and facts together -- you have to prive them together

- You can have dual but for causes, but not unlimited as a means of distracting from essential but-for cause (aka "a" cause vs. "the" cause)

## Cause in Fact

*Stubbs v. City of Rochester (NY Ct of Appeals 1919) 334: **If more than one possible causes of harm exist, and the defendant would be liable for one of them, the plaintiff must establish with reasonable certainty that the cause of the injury was the one for which the defendant was liable***

- Dirty water in drinking system and plaintiff contracted Typhoid

- Court found for plaintiff and ordered a new trial since Plaintiff presented enough evidence to make a reasonable inference that the cause of the illness was due to contaminated water:

  - 57 other people ill on same street; plaintiff only drank that water; expert opinion says contaminated water is a very frequent cause of typhoid)

## Funky Liability outside of direct causation

*Zuchowicz v. US (2nd Circ 1998) 343: **when you cannot use a causal direct but-for test, you can use the substantial factor test: if several causes could have caused the harm, any cause that was a substantial factor is held liable (shifts burden to def) -- DON'T USE***

- Def doctors gave nearly double maximum amount of danocrine; plaintiff contract PPH and died after giving birth

- Expert testimony can be sufficient to prove causation in fact

- Defs fail test, so court affirms for plaintiff:

  - 1\) Def's negligent act or omission was a but-for cause of injury (FDA said it was unacceptable at that use -- since they've never tested at those levels, you can assume it's unsafe)

  - 2\) Negligence was causally linked to the harm (experts say yes with a reasonable degree of certainty)

  - 3\) Def's negligent act or omission was proximate cause to resulting injury

- Court said they weren't going to instruct jury to make the jump, but would inform them of the jump 🡪 Shifts burden to def (similar to Cardozo's inferences in Herzog for the jury to decide)

*Matsuyama v. Birnbaum (Mass Sup Ct 2008) 355: **when you cannot use but-for test with a terminally ill patient, you can apply a lost chance doctrine, which calculates decrease in plaintiff's lost chance of living absent defendant's negligence***

- Def doctor negligently did not order proper tests (even though he knew he was a smoker and of Japanese ancestry) that would have discovered gastric cancer

- Court employs loss of chance doctrine since we can now estimate patient's chance of survival (theory of injury, not a causation; limited to medical cases)

- Jury decided it was a 37.5% chance

- But for your negligence, I would have had a higher chance at living

If D1 and D2 each negligently cause an accident, Plaintiff could recover in full from D2, and then D1 must sue D2 for his share (usually happens in insolvency cases -- to protect plaintiff) \[not to be confused with joint/MNC)

*Ravo v. Rogatnick (NY 1987) 365: **when tortfeasors' actions cause a joint harm (even if you cannot tell who caused what harm), then there is "joint enterprise" liability among them for the damages***

- Unclear whether obs. or pediatrician's negligence caused injury

- Unfair possibly to def 1 who is only 25% liable and may need to pay 100% of damages if def 2 is insolvent

- This is replaced by comparative negligence rules in some states

*Summers v. Tice (Calif Sup ct 1948) 367: **in order to get around but-for loophole with two possible joint tortfeasors, courts will hold both defendants liable and put burden on defendants for liability between themselves***

- Both defendants were quail hunting when they shot at plaintiff, one striking his eye and another his lip -- unable to tell which gun harmed in eye

- Courts will treat both defendants as though they are joint tortfeasors so that plaintiff does not screwed with exonerated liability; defs can then apportion liability between themselves after case with plaintiff

- Encourages silent defs to speak

- Not a MSC case -- only one act here, not that both shots hit him in the eye

*Dillon v. Twin State Gas - notes 370: **Court will sometimes apply but-for test and find for defendant and reduce awards; with boy who slips off landing and then gets electrocuted by exposed wire, jury found he would be killed anyway***

Key aspects of [Market Share Liability]{.underline}: which market, absent def's share, how exactly to exculpate, who pays what

*Hymowitz v. Eli Lylly & Co (NY Ct of Appeals 1989) 372: **especially when injury is dormant, court will employ a Market Share Liability determination to defendant companies (national); shifts burden to def***

- Plaintiffs allege harm when mother ingested dangerous DES drug during pregnancy; problems in determining exact manufacturer (over 300)

- In order to address such an injury that remains dormant and to prevent manufacturers from hiding behind a curtain, Court adopts National Market Share apportionment of damages to manufacture

- Even if not all plaintiffs are present -- it will prevent some plaintiffs from recovering 100% of their problems

- Summers precedent does not work because we have a def ID problem

- No industry wide enterprise liability

- Dissent: National Market share approach except those who were able to prove that their product caused the injury; preponderance of the evidence standard

- Analysis

  - No more link between plaintiff and def -- its presumed

  - Not an all or nothing standard -- far on the proportional spectrum side of things

  - Legislature asked Court to "legislate" by lifting statute of limitations

## Proximate Cause / Scope of Liability

- "An actor's liability is limited to those harms that result from the risks that made the actor's conduct tortious"

- BEFORE CONSIDERING FORESEEABILITY, ASK WHETHER DEFENDANT WAS [NEGLIGENT]{.underline}

- After all elements (breach of duty, damages, cause in fact), prox cause limits liability for def

- We often ask juries why do we think that a certain type of action was negligent in the first place

  - Why is speeding bad? You might crash into other people, animals, you might leave someone stuck on a highway

- Foreseeable vs. unforeseeable (make arguments on both sides)

- Very fact intensive -- Very nebulous

- *Abraham on Prox Cause*

  - Foreseeable Type of Harm

    - Varies on a case-by-case basis

    - Polemis (wood plank fire ship case) -- different types of harm -- falling plank farm and catastrophic harm to ship

      - Def;'s negligence was proximate cause of even unforeseeable harm, so long as harm was a direct consequence of def's negligence

    - Wagon Mound -- oil harms (polluting a bay) vs. fire harms

      - Foreseeability not important because plaintiff didn't want to admit contributory negligence

    - Palsgraf (box falling on someone's foot vs. box of explosives injuring Palsgraff -- changes if box was labeled)

  - Foreseeable Manner and Mechanism (does not matter)

    - General rule: unless in retrospect the manner in which foreseeable P suffered foreseeable type of harm appears to be so extraordinary as to be completely unforeseeable, the fact that the harm occurred in unforeseeable manner does **not** bar recovery

    - Didn't break the chain unless it's unforeseeable

    - One person negligently hits another car, is uninjured, but as he exists, is hit by a 3^rd^ car -- type of harm is the same but manner is different -- foreseeability in getting hit by a different car does not matter

    - What if injury occurs in a bizarre manner?

      - Plaintiff is struck by a third car after pulling over after accident -- as long as plaintiff was injured at roughly the same time and roughly same place as was foreseeable, it is not necessary that precise manner injury took place have been foreseeable

  - *Foreseeable Extent of Harm (thin skull rule) -- does not matter*

    - This has fallen by the way side for egg-shell, thin skull rule -- you take your victim as he comes, and you are liable for full extent of harm, even if you didn't realize he had a heart condition

      - Reasons: too many practical problems: what are the normal amount of injuries under circumstances? Most people are in good health (requiring expert testimony complicating cases); this in effect imposes strict liability (and could deter defendants from doing things altogether, such as driving which would not be good)

      - Exception: intervening cause (man is struck by lightening on stretcher after being assaulted)

  - Foreseeable Victim/Plaintiff? -- Matters a lot

    - Passing through a red light, it's foreseeable you would collide with someone else

    - Since injury to Palsgraf was not even remotely one of the risks to be taken into account by RR employee helping a 3^rd^ passenger, injury was not foreseeable and highly improbable

    - For Andrews, RR company could have foreseen because of proximity in space and time -- prox cause is malleable; once RR was negligent, it's enough

      - Cardozo said before question of prox could even be reached, def must have breached a duty to exercise reasonable care toward plaintiff vs. Andrews who said that it was about prox cause

      - Cardozo is about a breach of duty (not an existence of duty)

      - Policy:

        - Andrews liability protects plaintiffs (like strict liability); Cardozo doesn't hold people always liable (liability without fault?)

        - Maybe it makes more sense for negligent def to bear more costs

  - [Harm within the Risk Test]{.underline} 143

    - Is the risk of injury plaintiff suffered one of the risks that makes the def negligent for act?

    - Plaintiff, driving by blocked hydrant where def is parked, skids on road and collides with def's parked vehicle

    - Is the risk of injury the plaintiff suffered one of the risks that makes the def negligent for blocking access to the fire hydrant? (no)

    - Def's negligence did not foreseeably *increase* risk of harm that materialized

  - Intervention -- with 2 actors

    - Does def owe a duty to plaintiff? How foreseeable to def injury to parties in plaintiff's position in, which party is in a better position

      - Ex, bartender owes a duty to 3^rd^ parties harmed

    - If you have a duty, then you consider prox cause of injury -- [foreseeability]{.underline} of injury to plaintiff as a risk that is taken into account in deciding whether def's actions were negligent

    - Intervention [does not break]{.underline} chain of causation

  - Superseding Causes

    - You can use it as a limiting principle, intervening cause that breaks the causal change

    - Yes this thing happened, but it was still within the scope of risk

  - Purpose of Proximate Cause

    - Liability-limiting doctrine for defs

    - Withholding a case from jury on prox cause grounds limits considerations of many factors

    - Need for jury instruction that acquaints jury with its responsibility not for a mechanical decision, in tort law, but to use its judgment in deciding whether a def was sufficiently blameworthy under all circumstances

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Judges think of normative aspects -- you only want to deter what you can think of                                                                                          Negligence and caused me to get injured, what's the big deal? We should punish people who are negligent and compensate people who are injured

  Administration of tort law in general -- everything is a cause of everything, but if you go there, the whole system fails apart, so we need to break the chain somewhere   Moral luck -- it could just happen to be that your tortious action went through other actions and because of that, you're not negligent (but most other days, you would have caused the damage) -- are we going to let people off the hook cause it happened to be that day

                                                                                                                                                                             Requires courts to consider an arguably **endless** possibility of hypothetical situations (courts can thus abuse it if they wish)

*In re Polemis (British Court of Appeal KB 1921) 399: **a defendant's negligence can still be the proximate cause of an unforeseeable harm, so long as harm was a "direct" consequence of def's negligence; negligence can be enough***

- Actual anticipations of negligent party in falling of plank are irrelevant when considering whether resulting damage is remote

- Fire was a direct result of the negligent act, so defs are liable

- Damage that might result when a plank falls is a foreseeable consequence of negligence, whatever damage might be

*The Wagon Mound Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v. Mort's Dock & Engineering Co. LTD (UK Privy Council 1961) 402: **overturns Polemis limits negligence only standard with foreseeability: even if plaintiff's property is injured as a direct result of def's negligence, when it is an unforeseen consequence, you may not have liability***

- Def's ship negligently spilled oil, but then oil ignited later on and fire spread, causing extensive damage to property

- Overturns Polemis: not consistent with current ideas of justice that an act of negligence, however slight, which results in some unforeseen damage should make actor liable for all consequences simply because they are direct

- Minimum standard of behavior (though every case is different and should be judged as such

- Defendants liable for injuries defendant should have anticipated at time it released oil into the water (for fouling slips on dock, but not fire which destroyed the dock itself)

*Palsgraf v. LIRR Co. (NY Ct of Appeals 1928) 418: **A defendant owes a duty of care only to those who are in the reasonably foreseeable zone of danger, which must be determined from the risk that can reasonably be foreseen under the circumstances***

- Cardozo found for def because def's action were not reasonably foreseeable to harm plaintiff; case cannot go to jury

- Conduct of def's guard might have been wrong in relation to holder of package, but not to plaintiff, who was far away

- Negligence is not actionable unless it involves the invasion of a legally protected interest or right; and plaintiff does *not* have a right in relation to wrong of someone else

- Appearance of the package could not have warned the guard to take extra care

- Dissent Andrews: "negligence in the air"

  - You don't need a right affected to have negligence, it's a relationship to the injured

  - Everyone owes a duty to world to refrain from dangerous acts

  - Proximate cause as a stream of events

    - Foresight assumes prevision of explosion for immediate results 🡪 plaintiff is responsible (injury was probable)

    - It doesn't really matter if 2^nd^ action was foreseeable

[Foreseeability]{.underline}

- Type of harm (matters -- wagon mound)

- Manner/Mechanism (doesn't matter)

- Extent of harm (doesn't matter -- Polemis)

- Victim/plaintiff (matters -- Cardozo)

Restatement 3^rd^:

- Scope of risk test: "actor's liability is limited to those physical harms that result from the risks that made the actor's conduct tortious.

- if you give a kid a shotgun and he shots his head off, you have prox cause; if you give him a gun and he drops it on his foot, not proximate cause since risk that made the conduct negligent was the risk of the child accidentally firing the gun; the harm suffered could just as easily have resulted from handing the child an unloaded gun

- Reasonable person standard (implies foreseeability) -- what made the act tortious? What made it negligent? -- figure out what happened and if it is in foreseeable risks

- Similar to Cardozo

*Kinsman Case (2nd Circ 1964) 430: **when the timing of negligence will foreseeably cause further reasonable damage, you can infer causation; under proximate cause, the property owners adjacent to the river could sue (Kinsman I), but not the owners of the boats or the cargoes which could not move until the river was reopened for business (Kinsman II**)*

- Two boats break lose on icy river and crash together to form a dam, flooding parts of the city

- Court found Continental boat liable because they failed to inspect the boat, so the timing of negligence of crew was such that what followed was foreseeable

  - Crashing was foreseeable but not flooding?

    - Court rejects Wagon Mound analysis, which excludes liability when injury springs from a different hazard (scope of risk)

    - Accepts spirit of Polemis: foreseeably of danger is necessary to render conduct negligent -- a party cannot believed of liability when negligent simply because chance of occurrence when viewed alone may not have been large enough to require exercise of care

- Court found the city liable as well because conditions that day made it reasonably foreseeable that a dam might be created at the bridge

- Policy: Could this lead to unbounded liability as long as the type of injury is foreseeable even though the extent is not? Discussion of Andrews' expediency -- common sense, public policy, what seems fair and just?

- Kinsman II -- court rejected claims against the city for closure of the bridge and economic loss -- connection between city's negligence and plaintiffs harm is too tenuous and remote to permit recovery (Similar to Andrews in Palsgraf)

# IV. Defenses 

## Negligence Regimes

### Contributory negligence

- Complete bar recovery to any plaintiff who is contributorily negligent

- Most states now put burden on Defendant to prove (previously in Brown v. Kendall, plaintiff had burden)

- Very harsh regime -- MD and CA grapple with this idea

- Limitations:

  - Recklessness (or willful misconduct) -- contributory neg is irrelevant

  - Statutory protected class (school bus driver cannot rely on contrib. neg. of children)

  - [Last clear chance]{.underline} - plaintiff behaved carelessly and got into a dangerous situation that led to injury; def had failed to utilize his last clear chance to avoid injury to the plaintiff (despite plaintiff's negligence) (Prox. Cause questions?)

    - In order to prove this, plaintiff need not prove that def appreciated position of danger in relation to plaintiff; rather, only that def had reason to appreciate danger

    - Transitional doctrine that melded into comp neg

  - Refusal to impute contrib. negligence (respondeat superior) -- this has been largely eliminated except in wrongful death actions

  - Jury's role -- jury would sometimes reduce plaintiff's damages by some amount rather than return a defense verdict (ignore judge's instructions)

  - Avoidable consequences (mitigation) -- even if accident was entirely def's fault, plaintiff's recovery might be reduced to the extent he failed to exercise due care to mitigate harm dome (medical advice)

### Comparative Negligence

- Pure Comp. Neg

  - Negligent plaintiff's recovery depended on how serious plaintiff's negligence was compared to the def's

  - The more plaintiff is negligent, the less plaintiff gets with no cutoff

- Modified Comp Neg

  - 50% cutoff (or sometimes 51% cutoff)

  - The more you're negligent, the less you get up to 50%; once you're at 51%, you get nothing

- Inherently related to causation -- though it seeks not to be (difficult for juries to separate out)

- What kind of negligence? Stop sign vs. speeding -- difficult to compute

- With joint/several, solvent def and plaintiff bear risk of other defendant's insolvency, in proportion to amount of negligence attributable to them

- *Comp Neg and Joint and Several Liability Possibilities*

  - Hypo: P=40%; D1=35% and D2 = 25%:

1.  Hold Ds J&S liable for full amount of the judgment (60% of P's losses), even though P was also negligent (only works with joint tort-feasors)

2.  Hold each Defendant liable for his own proportional share of the reduced judgment (effectively revoking J&S liability)

    a.  D1 pays 35/60 of judgment. \[& if 2nd D can't pay their 25/60 share, burden falls on P/P goes uncompensated for that amount. \*\* And the point of J&S liability is that burden should not have to fall on P if one of the neg Ds can't pay.\]

    - If one of the Ds is insolvent, then the injurers as a group (the 2 Ds plus P) are responsible for the extra burden, and should the burden of the 2nd D's amount in proportion to their own responsibility (since plaintiff was negligent too, we are not concerned about protecting him from insolvency

Who should make the negligence regime change?

- Legislature

  - They will think about many scenarios in advance, whereas more courts will do it piece meal = ex ante clarity

  - Big change in law -- democratic legitimacy and no judicial activism

  - Maryland court said this was a role of the legislature

- Judiciary

  - Judges may have more real life experience with the issues, in their jurisdiction

  - Legislatures have reelection in mind, and it take them a long time to do anything

  - CA court said they had the authority to do it

*Li v. Yellow Cab (Calif. Sup Ct 1975) Handout: **California Court shifts from contributory to pure comparative negligence regime because it is a better and fairer system***

- Court stretches the CA statute in contributory negligence because original drafters did not want to preclude further judicial development; they wanted to codify existing common law principles

- Benefits of comp neg regime outweigh its difficulties and benefits of contrib. neg. regime; fairness concerns

- Pure form is better because modified distorts principle that persons are responsible for their acts to the extent their fault contributes to an injurious result

Maryland thought it was a better role for the **legislature** to decide the negligence regime

### 

### Assumption of Risk

MAKE SURE YOU TELL THE **[TYPE]{.underline}** OF ASSUMPTION OF RISK (Implied, inherent, primary, secondary)

- Note also that assumption of risk has been folded into comparative negligence in most states since it does not make much sense to have AOR with comparative negligence

<!-- -->

- Express -- contractual wavier of liability (ski resort wavier, adhesion, forum selection or arbitration clauses

- Implied

  - Inherent - Where you put yourself in a situation where you know, or should know that you will be susceptible to someone else's negligence (there's a burning building and you go in anyway)

    - Last clear chance -- if plaintiff had last clear chance not to go into burning building, then they are limited in ability to sues

    - Primary: "inherent" assumption of risk (sports; absolute bar to recovery under Cardozo)

      - Sugarman article -- baseball fans hit by foul balls take on an implied assumption of risk

        - Satisfies the breach of duty -- informed consent -- def did not breach duty of care because exercise of reasonable care did not require a net

      - If it's rare, there may be a duty (common = duty)

      - Only happens when risks are inherent in activity and unavoidable at a reasonable cost

    - Secondary: Plaintiff voluntarily encounters a known risk; requires actual knowledge (subjective; reasonableness of plaintiff and risk)

      - It is contributory negligence with: plaintiff's careless failure to recognize a risk; plaintiff's conscious taking of an unreasonable risk by def's actions (juries use comp neg to assess plaintiff's fault)

      - Defendant sets off fireworks in public street -- plaintiff, anxious to see the show, stands next to him and is injured

    - Non-negligent risk taking (Conscious reasonable) -- NON ASSUMPTION

      - Plaintiff killed while rescuing a child stuck by a train

      - Court held jury would find this was not contributory negligence because def's behavior was not unreasonable

      - Plaintiff may be in a better position than def to decide whether risk to be injured by def's negligence, or not

  - Negligence -- if you get injured on a road, and you get out, and someone offers to drive you is drunk, but you get in and you know and you're injured -- you cannot recover because you assumed the risk

  - Only real way to overcome this is some overriding policy concern

- Distinction: inherent risks does [not]{.underline} mean you're assuming the risk of no negligence of others

- Davenport factor test of Assumption of Risk:

  - 1\) Plaintiff must have knowledge of the facts constituting a dangerous condition

  - 2\) Plaintiff must know the condition is dangerous

  - 3\) Plaintiff must appreciate the nature and extent of the danger

  - 4\) Plaintiff must voluntarily expose himself to the danger

*The Flopper: Murphy v. Steeplechase Amusement Co. (NY Ct of Appeals 1929) 470: **there is an implied assumption of risk to a plaintiff who takes on a dangerous activity or sport***

- Plaintiff is injured on amusement ride and sues for negligence

- Cardozo finds for defs because he assumed the risk of falling in general (he saw people falling before he got on the ride) and cannot discriminate between jerk and instantaneous fall

  - As long as you acknowledge risk of falling you take into account repercussions (and def's negligence!?)

- No malfunction of ride, though even if defs weren't operating properly, he accepted risks; he was in good shape and should have expected fall

- Danger inherent in sport was clear

*Davenport v. Cotton Hope Plantation Horizontal Property Regime (Sup Ct South Carolina 1998) 475: **a plaintiff is not barred from recovery by the doctrine of assumption of risk unless the degree of fault arising therefrom is greater than the negligence of the defendant (comp neg regime)***

- Plaintiff fell on stairs with no light; he did not use handrail

- Court said that assumption of risk is not a complete bar to recovery under the rules of S.C. comparative negligence system

- Issue of fact as to plaintiff's actual knowledge of assumption of risk and comp neg, so its remanded for new trial

- Assumption of risk = plaintiff's comparative fault

- Factor test for assumption of risk:

  - 1\) Plaintiff must have knowledge of the facts constituting a dangerous condition

  - 2\) Plaintiff must know the condition is dangerous

  - 3\) Plaintiff must appreciate the nature and extent of the danger

  - 4\) Plaintiff must voluntarily expose himself to the danger

*Calabresi on Causation/Risk*

- Deterrence (spreading is not the only goal of tort law)

  - Common law judging -- "fit and justify" -- we should try to make sense and justify what common law has done, and not just consider case by case)

    - judges may be able to weigh deterrence goals; jury verdicts are variable; customs relevant?

  - Collective or Specific Deterrence (regulatory system)

    - Some acts are so dangerous, society has an interest in deterring them

    - Causation/proximate cause requirements are important here

  - Market / General Deterrence (tax)

    - Leave judgment to market which determines price of activity

    - Works through causation by charging for harm (injury cost on actors who can best decide if avoidance is cheaper as determined by prox cause)

- Compensation is not the only goal of tort law (we need causation)

  - Distribution of wealth -- Warren Buffett pays everything

  - Loss spreading -- everyone pays a dollar

- Foreseeability

  - Plaintiff - existence of an unforeseeable or only slightly foreseeable plaintiff requires the court or jury to make an independent examination of relative cost avoidance potential between the defendant and this plaintiff category

  - Defendant - once proximate cause between defendant\'s fault and the injury exists, liability extends to more serious, but unexpected damages as well, seems to be a good starting point from a market deterrence point of view (market exceptions -- assumption of risk/contrib negligence)

  - Type of Damage -- kid drops gun you gave him on foot: it is known, either before or after the accident, that loaded guns are particularly hard for infants to hold. Causal linkage is, therefore, established because the evidence indicates that handing loaded guns to children substantially increases the risk that they will be dropped and thus the risk that elderly feet will be injured as a result.

- Cheapest cost avoider

  - Put the burden on the CCA - who can most easily and cheaply avoid accidents or lowest burden of precaution -- role for the law?

  - We don't want to avoid all accidents, just the ones that are feasibly avoidable (valuing human lives)

- Difficulties with insurance spreading:

  - Basic causal link between what happened and what person did

  - Deterrence (ex ante?)

  - Minimizing costs of accidents as a tort aim

  - Precautions

- Requirements for coase theorem: no transaction costs; no distribution costs in society; CCA = best briber

Cost of accidents -- Calabresi

- Some accidents are not worth avoiding (market is not only factor for deciding avoidance of accidents)

  - 1\) Reduction number severity of accidents

    - Market and collective deterrence

  - 2\) Reduction in societal costs

    - loss spreading and deep pockets

  - 3\) Reduction in cost of administering treatment of accidents (efficiency costs)

    - tertiary -- aim is to reduce costs of 1) and 2)

## Coase Theorem

- Regardless of where you put liability, parties will come to the most efficient outcome anyway (so you do not need care)

- Factory and school example, harm is 100, and scrubber costs 50 and would reduce harm to 10

  - It does not matter who puts the scrubber in, because both parties will be motivated to put the scrubber in no matter what (cheaper to harm or prevent harm)

- Coase theorem is about FUTURE conduct (ex ante), but an example might be about neglgeince ex postd

- Problems:

  - Transaction costs must be low, and parties must be able to communicate with each other to actually bargain

    - With Car accidents, people cannot bargain so no coase because they have no pre-existing relationship

  - Information costs -- you might not know who is better at taking the precaution, so you need the court to figure it out

  - No sense of morality or fairness in determining who should bear costs

# V. Duty

General

- Negligence referred to as a breach of duty (move away from privity doctrine); breach of duty to exercise reasonable care

- Duty is a question of law for the **court**, whereas breach is a question for **jury**

- Affirmative duty -- defendant's conduct does not negligently create a risk of physical harm to plaintiff (and has therefore not breached)

  - But def might eliminate or reduce risks of independent harms to plaintiff -- def has an affirmative duty to reduce (duty to rescue)

  - There is rarely a duty to rescue, but sometimes there is if there is a special relationship

  - Gratuitous service exception -- you cannot see a victim, agree to help, and then take action to further his injury

  - Duty to warm: duty of stalled truck to warn approaching drivers of danger created in some states)

- Limited Duty - def's conduct foreseeably creates an unreasonable risk of haring the plaintiff

  - Def has committed misfeasance rather than nonfeasance

  - Some cases place limit on duty t exercise reasonable care not to risk such harm (limited duty)

  - Liability of owners for injuries to those who have entered property to *warn* the licensee, though not necessarily remove the harm

  - Social host has no duty in serving a drunken guests

  - Trespassers --only a duty to refrain from wantonly and willfully injuring them (hidden traps)

- List of factors courts take in to account

  - 1\) foreseeability of harm

  - 2\) closeness of connection b/w defs conduct and plaintiff's harm

  - 3\) moral blame of def's conduct

  - 4\) extend of burden on def and consequences for community if duty is imposed

  - 5\) policy of preventing future harm

  - 6\) availability and prevalence of insurance that is or would be available if duty is imposed

- [Misfeasance]{.underline} -- def who negligently created a risk of harm (**duty**) (re-roofer drops his hammer on a pedestrian)

- [Nonfeasance]{.underline} -- def who did not remove a risk of harm created by someone or something else (**no duty**/liability) (sunbather has no duty to save drowning child or notify)

  - Policy reasons for nonfeasance exception: nonfeasance made the plaintiff's situation no worse; infringement on individual liberty on unwilling bystanders; difficulty on defining duty to be imposed (what if bystanders could not swim; whole beach of bystanders?)In

- Factors for considering imposition of a duty: morality, burden of new duty, alternative ways of protecting plaintiff, effect of imposing duty on def's conduct, administrative concerns, foreseeability and avoidance, legislature

- Duty v. Proximate Cause

  - Courts use proximate cause to limit liability to foreseeable consequences of a negligent act

    - Driver leaves key in car and terrorist steals car and blows up building -- driver owes duty not to leave care open to theft, but result is so idiosyncratic and beyond the cope of harm that def is not liable for bombing damages

  - Duty concept denies liability for consequences that *are* foreseeable -- courts refuse to impose liability for policy reasons (not foreseeable that you could injure a fetus)

    - Though Palsgraf is the exception because it considers foreseeability

## Affirmative Obligations to Act/Warn

Exceptions to no-duty/obligation:

- Special relationships -- LOOK OUT FOR THE EXACT TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP (subcontractor, employer, landlord, school-student etc)

  - Landlord has a duty to his tenant to maintain locks if tenant is assaulted (Kline v. Mass Act Apt Corp)- preexisting relationship; past history requires notice

- Non-negligent injury -- one who innocently injured another had no duty to exercise due care to ensure other's subsequent well-being

- Non-negligent creation of risk -- def can sometimes have a duty to remove hazard or warn others, even if he didn't create the hazard

  - Cab driver left scene with car; he left in another cab; other cab driver owed no duty to other people who hit his car because he had not voluntarily assumed a duty to plaintiffs by acting affirmatively to induce them to rely on him

  - Doctor has a duty to warn a plaintiff if a medical device suddenly gets new risks

  - Predictions can be bad (false alarms / stigmas, false negatives)

- Statutes

  - Vermont and some other states impose a duty to rescue

  - Duty to report child abuse (in most states since children cannot report themselves)

  - Babysitter abused child and was previously dismissed by US for abusing children; US didn't report it -- Posner said there was a difference b/w negligence per se and adopting an affirmative obligation in tort -- no common law duty to report (US has risk in defamation)

*Harper v. Herman (Sup Ct Minnesota 1993) 131: **a special relationship requiring an affirmative duty to act only exist when plaintiff was deprived of normal opportunities to protect himself; actual knowledge of a condition is insufficient itself to impose liability***

- Diver is hurt on def's boat when def did not warn him of shallow depth

- Court did not find there to be a special relationship because plaintiff was not deprived of normal opportunities to protect himself since plaintiff was an adult; knowledge of danger does not create liability

*Tarasoff v. Regents of Univ. of Calif. (Calif Sup Ct 1976) 151: **Because of a special relationship between doctor and patient, we will extend affirmative duty to act to third parties when they are in danger (foreseeability is important)***

- Therapists' patient kills girlfriend after telling therapist he intends to; therapist tells police but not girlfriend

- Court found he had a duty to tell girlfriend because relationship b/w therapist and patient is special and duty is extended to others to warn them of potential danger, just as a hospital has a duty to others (foreseeability is important here)

- The legislature created an exception to confidentiality when patient is dangerous to himself or others

- Dissent, false positives; destroys confidentiality

- [Policy]{.underline} -- duty to warn whom? Needs to be specific

*In re NYC Asbestos Litigation (NY 2005): **employer had no duty to employee's spouse for asbestos "taken home" by employee (though NJ Court disagreed)***

## Sovereign Immunity and No Duty

Policy reasons for invoking No duty

- Liability with a societal impact (BP oil spill, financial crisis shutting down the NY subway/electric systems)

  - Potential limitless liability of parties where you do not want it

  - Imposing liability wouldn't make a deterrence incentive for power company -- quasi public institution, or police, army etc.

  - Contracts and privity as a limiting principle -- easy to administer and can still cause deterrence

- 3^rd^ restatement: when cases articulate categorical, bright-line rules of law applicable to a general class of cases" there is a policy reason whereby no duty exists

- Duty is made up by courts in the first place; its all about whether a court decides it can create a duty by making society substantially safer

Sovereign Immunity -- LOOK OUT FOR FED (FTCA), MUNICIPAL, [QUASI GOV'T ENTITY]{.underline} (con ed)

- Federal - FTCA limits sov imm. and says you can sue employees of the gov't

  - Exceptions: military actions, wartime

  - Cope -- 2 part test

    - 1\) is statute setting out a clear course of action

    - 2\) if no, then was the discretionary act fraught with policy implications (economic costs, apportioning money); courts should not always step in to an administrator's shoe because they have limited expertise

- Municipal Liability

  - Riss

    - Monetary principle - courts don't think they should tell cops how to use their resources

    - Decision making perspective-we don't want police to weigh which call to take when they get two calls based on which might expose them to more liability

Act/Omissions

- 1\) Actively Omit -- looks like a test, if you step aside as a stroller goes down a hill

- 2\) Earlier Act created risk -- pushing a baby on top of a hill and leaving it (=negligence)

- 3\) Earlier act created reliance -- you created a situation where to cut it off is to create a risk (you discourage others from aiding, you do something that makes someone think you are going to be the one rendering help) (still a fuzzy line)

+===========================+=========================================+=======================================+========================+

*Strauss v. Belle Realty Co. (NY Ct of Appeals 1985) 168: **with a quasi-public important institution as Con Ed, the Court will limit its negligence duty to privity relationships because the consequences of opening litigation are too grave***

- Man is hurt tripping during blackout in common area of building (landlord pays con ed for common area)

- Court did not find a duty owed to plaintiff because as a matter of public policy, they wanted to limit the Con Ed's liability

  - Foreseeability is difficult for con ed here

  - Quasi-public institution -- too big to insure

- We have to define an "orbit of duty" with controllable limits on liability; not really about drawing a line

- Dissent: The more persons injured trough a tort-feasor's gross negligence, the less the responsibility for injuries incurred?? What's the rational boundary

- Policy: perverse incentive? -- Con ed may only want to contract with building owners now

*Moch case -- **Cardozo failed to find liability for the water supply company when a building caught on fire, because there was no duty; misfeasance vs. nonfeasance: failure to provide a public benefit (water supply) is not the same as the commission of a wrong); liability would be unduly extended if we found a duty***

Federal Tort Claims act

- Federal gov't waives its tort immunity

- Exceptions for military, post office, and "discretionary functions"

*Cope v. Scott (DC Circuit 1995) 249: **in order to be exempt from the FTCA, the gov't needs to show that a purportedly "discretionary function" activity is susceptible to a policy, economic, political, or social judgment choices. The decision of when and where to place signage on a dangerous road does not implicate these choices***

- Cope sues federal gov't after car accident for failure to do road maintenance and failure to post adequate signage; Gov't claims exception to the FTCA for discretionary function

- Court finds for gov't on maintenance, but for Cope on signage. Factor test:

  - 1\) whether any federal statute regulation or policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an employee to follow

  - 2\) Challenged discretionary function are of the nature and quality Congress intended to shield from liability (ie, susceptible to a policy judgment and an economic, political, social judgment)

    - Budgetary constraints count (but mere choice does not)

      - Regular maintenance can only be prevented by reducing traffic load or repaving, so it's a discretionary function

    - It cannot be associated with regulatory concerns, has to be grounded in regulatory scheme

    - Types of signs are not "fraught" with public policy considerations, so they are not a discretionary function

  - Court does not want to second guess policy makers -- legislature

*Riss v. City of New York: (NY Ct of Appeals 1968): **the Court will not carve out an area of tort liability for the city absent specific legislation even when the police do not adequately "protect" someone seeking help***

- Plaintiff's boyfriend throws lye in her face after she unsuccessfully sought police protection following earlier threats

- This is not a role for the judiciary to carve out an area of tort liability for police protection to members of the public (different than if cops undertook responsibility themselves)

- Dissent: fear of financial disaster is a myth, and we should not punish victims; courts always do an administrative function in tort cases; courts should be able to instruct police to improve public administration or accept costs

*Schuster v. City of NY (notes 232): **Small exception to Riss; Court sustained plaintiff's claim that police were under a legal duty to respond reasonably to plaintiff's request for protection since the police made use of a private citizen (he was an informant)***

*Sorichetti v. City of NY (1985 notes 232): **court imposed duty on police officers to act on preventing abusive father; distinguished from Riss on basis of protective orders, history of violent behavior, and front desk assurance somebody would help***

*Cuffy v. City of NY (notes): **there is generally no tort duty to provide police protection, but there is an exception when there exists a special relationship***

- 1\) Assumption by municipality through promises or action of an affirmative duty to act on injured party; 2) knowledge of muni's agents that indication could lead to harm; 3) some form of direct contact b/w muni's agent and injured party; 4) party's justifiable reliance on muni's (cuffy was denied because he could not establish direct reliance on a promise)

## Emotional Harm

![Macintosh HD:Users:Jonathankay:Desktop:Screen Shot 2013-12-11 at 5.46.39 PM.png](media/image1.png){width="8.830686789151356in" height="6.202505468066492in"}

Emotional Harm General

- Only a limited duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid causing negligently inflicted emotional distress (pure emotional Distress)

- Eggshell plaintiff -- check to see whether the emotional harm claimed would be normal for a plaintiff to claim (or unreasonable type of suffering)

- [Independent duty]{.underline} -- failure to exercise reasonable care causes another person emotional distress (very rare)

  - There is generally no duty to exercise reasonable care here

    - Too much **fraud** when plaintiff claims he is frightened

      - Counter: its for juries to assess credibility

    - Opens the **floodgates** of litigation

    - Imposing liability for ED would require development of standards of reasonable care that do not now exist except in a vague way

    - Remedying NEID in tort suits is beyond what we want law to devote its limited energies too -- practical problems of money and time -- finite sums of money

  - Exceptions where it is applied: Defendant negligently conveys important information \[and emotional harm is foreseeable result\] (mistaken death announcement), defendant is in a power of authority (hospital lets newborn be stolen)

- [Derivative duty]{.underline} -- failure to exercise reasonable care to avoid causing physical injury does not cause physical injury, but does cause ED

  - **Impact Rule** -- not a requirement that plaintiff be injured, but just that there was impact

    - Result: very arbitrary at the margins for all-or-nothing rule

  - **Zone of Danger Rule**

    - Intermediate level of generality

    - Plaintiff could recover for Emotional distress even if no impact, but if plaintiff was in zone n which physical injury was threatened and feared for safety

    - Not as arbitrary, but there still were some losers: plaintiffs who were outside zone but still suffered emotional loss

  - **Dillon rule**: no more zone of danger, mother who suffered daughter's injury could recover (three factors: proximity, visibility, and relationship)

    - Pretty rare and supreme court limits it

  - **Fear of future injury**

    - Some courts permit plaintiff under limited circumstances to recover damages from [future cancer]{.underline}, asbestos effects (*Ayres,* provided it was serious) but others limit it since it did not actually occur

    - *Metro-North* -- you need to actually manifest symptoms of the future disease

    - Fraudulent claims; and preserving scarce dollars from a pool

*Falzone v. Busch (NJ Sup Ct 1965) 260: **no longer need physical impact; Zone of danger: when negligence created the potential but not the occurrence for physical harm, and emotional harm as manifest symptoms, it can go to the jury***

- Plaintiff's wife almost gets hit by negligent car and then sees her husband get hit; she gets sick out of emotional harm

- Court finds for plaintiff because medical evidence is possible, and because you trace a causal connection from negligence to emotional injury (even though it still is difficult)

- Plaintiff should get the opportunity to submit evidence to jury of the symptoms of her emotional harm

- Car and plane case (notes) -- plaintiff could recover emotional harm when def drives car onto property and hits plaintiff; plaintiffs cannot recover under fear of falling plane that never hits them because fear was fleeting

*Metro-North v. Buckley (US Up Ct 1997) 268: **plaintiffs can only recover for emotional harm if he manifests symptoms of a disease, not solely on the possibility that he may develop the disease later on***

- Plaintiff is exposed to asbestos and gets increased risk of cancer, but does not actually contract it

- Court refuses to grant plaintiff's claim for emotional harm because doing so would force court to create a whole new category for plaintiff, as he has no common law support

- Ginsburg -- no objective evidence of emotional distress (no professional mental help or medical testimony) -- similar to Falzone

- No physical impact test -- he had contact part but not injury

VS.

*Ayres (notes): **Court allowed workers suffering from non-malignant respiratory disease to recover under FELA for emotional distress on idea they might contract cancer in the future provided it was genuine and serious***

*Potter v. Firestone (notes): **Since plaintiffs faced enhanced but quantified risk of developing cancer in future (serious and medical opinion), they can recover against defs who dump toxic wastes into a landfill and exposed plaintiffs to carcinogens over a prolonged period***

## Economic Harm

Economic loss rule -- you generally cannot recover for economic loss caused to you by unrelated negligence (blocking a bridge for example) because tortfeasor owes you no duty

- Policy reasons for limiting liability:

  - Scope would be difficult to predict (liability insurance becomes difficult and uninsurable)

  - Deterrence -- def is already deterred by injury negligence, so you don't need economic deterrence here (over deterrence risks)

  - Third party economic losses are distributed among large numbers of people (what about when injurer is weak)?

  - Economic losses can spread far and wide -- ad infinitim down the chain

*532 Madison Ave. v. Finlandia (NY Ct of Appeals 2001) 310: **Foreseeability of harm does not define a duty -- it must arise from a special relationship; a special relationship of a landowner does not owe a duty to the general public to protect them from economic harm; no liability for pure economic loss***

- Office tower collapses closing streets and nearby store sue for loss of business

- Court declines to impose a duty of economic harm on defs because doing so would extend unreasonably to the whole public -- we have to draw the line somewhere

  - We're going to draw the line at property damage and personal injury

- Question of impact: precedent case with explosion of a chemical factory had an impact on the special relationship they had with their neighbors

- Koch v. Con Ed -- in 1977 blackout, city tried to recover from con ed -- court allowed cause of action for damages caused by looting, but not for recover of wages emergency city personnel

# VI. Strict Liability

General

- SL -- liability w/o fault

- ALWAYS APPLY CAUSATION STILL

- Courts were conscious of creating a principle that was contrary to ordinary negligence standard

- Posner - Strict liability is in place to give actor inventive to avoid accidents and experiment with ways of being more careful -- affects activity levels

  - Activity levels in the sense of not driving at all, *or* how much driving you are going to undertake in the first place (vs. care in driving)

  - keeping a tiger is a dangerous act, so he should consider not having the tiger altogether, not just that he exercise due care for the tiger to escape

  - It is only really in *negligence cases* that a court is in the business of affecting care or activity levels; in SL cases, it's pay your own way, so Court does not really address care and activity levels

- Main question becomes: *Who decides*? (institutional competence -- courts, agency, actors?)

- Think about **HOW** you are going to craft the activity to fit your liability regime:

  - Palsgraff -- activity of just selling explosives (SL) vs. transferring explosives (Neg -- training courier)

- Think about CONTEXT of where the activity takes place (city, farm, important com. crossing)

- Comparative Negligence and SL (Abraham 180)

  - In some jurisdiction, comp neg is a defense to SL

  - It is still possible to compare negligence of defendant with negligence of plaintiff\]

  - What about when def is not at fault? Then you can compare plaintiff's negligence to how he should have behaved (Sup Ct of California allowed this: not apples and oranges -- it was equitable apportionment of liability)

*Rylands v. Fletcher (Exchequer Chamber 1866) 507: **non-natural use of land induces SL: when you keep something that is likely to cause harm if it escapes, you are strictly liable if it does escape (even if you inspected it and had no knowledge)***

- Plaintiffs property is damaged from water from defs who had a reservoir (and inspected it by engineers)

- Court found for plaintiff deeming def strictly liable; similar to if cattle escapes and damages others' property

- No negligence is required because no one is to blame

- defendant brings reservoir at his own peril - he "assumes risk" by actively putting reservoir on his land; he had a **non-natural** use of the land (artificial)

- Other cases

  - Losee -- applied same standard to steam boiler in industrializing society

  - Texas case refused to apply same standard because storage of water is a natural use of land in arid Texas

*Indiana Harbor Belt RR v. American Cyanmid (7th Circ 1990) 521: **Posner: when negligence is possible and you can affect the "care levels" of a material, you do not apply strict liability***

- Def is manufacturer of acrylonitrile and liquid leaks while in a train car; RR company seeks decontamination costs

- Posner does not apply SL to defs, since leak was caused by carelessness, not the chemical itself

  - You can affect the care levels (part C of test below is most important)

  - This couldn't have been prevented at a reasonable cost, so not a case for strict liability

  - This is not Rylands because it is not the actors here; passive shipper vs. active shipper

- Huang: Posner does not examine how SL can affect care levels too (ie, whether transportation of flammable toxic material is abnormally dangerous); it asked only whether there is SL when particular means of escape of such material from the RR care could have been prevented by reasonable care

*2^nd^ Restatement SL test: (BE SURE TO STILL ADDRESS CAUSATION)*

- A\) risk of harm was great

- B\) harm that would ensue if risk materialized could be great (though didn't have to be

- C\) such accidents could not be prevented by exercise of due care \*\*

- D\) activity was not a matter of common usage

- E\) activity was inappropriate to the place which it took place (i.e. densely populated)

- F\) reinforcing d, value to community of activity is not great enough to offset unavoidable risks

- Example: explosion case -- no proximate cause requirement if you are transferring explosives

- Disadvantages - Ultrahazardous previous approach was simpler for court and jury

- Causation is still important

  - 2^nd^ allows for recovery in SL cases even if an unexpected act intervened

  - Madsen case where mother mink ate young after blasting; def was not SL because possibility that this would occur is not even one of the secondary risks that enters into the decision to impose SL for blasting (Mink owners are in a better position than blasters to make activity-level and research calculations that strict liability induces)

*3^rd^ Restatement SL: "abnormally dangerous" if activity creates a risk even when care does not mitigate risk; it is not common*

- Whether activity poses a foreseeable and highly significant risk of harm

- Activity is not common usage

- Victim is usually passive, third party

- SL should still be limited to the type of harm that makes the conduct dangerous

\*Problem with SL+ Comparative Negligence: what are you comparing with -- when you leave it to a jury and ask them how much fault is responsible -- if you're in a SL regime it's not coherent, because then you're not asking about def's conduct at all

- Solution: you just say we by SL + comp neg, if no one is negligence, then plaintiff bears loss, but if both sides are negligence, then we determine how much each side is at fault

- Abraham page 181 says Courts disagree:

  - Calif court says you can have both regimes and that it is not instructing the jury to compare apples and juries -- jury was not to compare fault of parties, but to engage in equitable apportionment of liability -- it should be done because it is fair to do so

## Theoretical Perspectives of Strict Liability (Posner, Rabin and King)

Posner on SL -- Allocative Efficiency as an aim of tort law

- When you create a regime liability for defs you implicitly and explicitly affect liability of plaintiff

- Activity vs. Care Levels

  - SL is good for activity levels when you do not care about care levels (more care does not do much to reduce the risk)

  - Courts are not very good for affecting activity levels (Courts want to say drive carefully, rather than say do not drive at all)

  - SL -- pay your own way -- you determine your cost of operation, not the court

- You also need to consider social costs of affecting activity levels -- should we just have gentle animals at the zoo (seems absurd as dangerous animals are main attraction)

Rabin 531

- Domicile was important in 19^th^ century England for Rylands (do right by your neighbor)

- Explosion of RR cars: Carrier is innocent and we will not create a public duty exception when rationale for subjecting carrier to absolute liability is the carrier's ability to distribute loss to the public

- No connection w/ strict liability and ideology of enterprise liability

# VII. Conversion, Trespass, Nuisance

## Trespass

- Intentional entry of another person's land

- You can still get nominal damages if no demonstrable harm was showed (nominal)

- No "intent" needed for regular trespass -- all you need that you were intending to use land

  - Unintentional trespass, when you do not intend to use property, is basically regular negligence according to restatement; Here, no damage/harm, no liability

- Necessity exceptions (discussed below)

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Moving parts of Trespass**                **Liability Calculus / Hard-edge Rule Line**
  ------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Entry into land, property w/o consent       "Things"

  \$\$ Remedy                                 Yes (Nominal)

  No Harm (nominal damages will be awarded)   Not needed (unless in regular tort)

  Care/Fault can still sometimes matter       Irrelevant (unless in regular tort)

  Intent (you did not know you trespassed)    Entry is the intent; no real intent needed, though it depends on the jurisdiction

                                              Lines of trespass sometimes soften when they intersect with other areas of tort law (harm, care) or when court want them to (Martin)
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Martin v. Reynolds Metals Co (Oregon Sup Ct 1959) 676: **there was a trespass on plaintiff's land for the reason the actual deposit of "unseen things" caused his land to be unfit for the cattle he was trying to raise there; trespass and nuisance can exist concurrently; all you need is a feeling of exclusive possession***

- Court found that with advancements in science, we can define trespass as any intrusion which invades possessor's protected interest in exclusive possession, whether invisible or not (so fluoride counts as trespass)

  - This was originally a nuisance case but plaintiffs wanted trespass because of SOL

- Court said that all you need is a violation of a [FEELING]{.underline} of exclusive possession

  - What is the degree of feeling? Abuse?

  - This is an extreme form of nuisance and trespass standard; this is about protecting the safety of land ownership

- Probably an [objective standard]{.underline} -- whether a reasonable person would view vibrations as infringements on ownership

*Private necessity*

- Suppose private party uses or destroys the property of another in order to preserve his person or property of greater value (plaintiff mores ship at a dock of def's private island to avoid storm; def cut loose boat, and boat was harmed -- court awarded damages to plaintiff, recognizing privilege, born of necessity, to use def's property") -- as long as harm you're preventing is not greater than harm you are causing to land

- Important to note that the harm is not caused by the def himself here

*Defenses to Trespass (Abraham)*

- Public/private necessity, defense of property, recapture of chattels, lands

- Necessity is reserved for those cases in which def has acted reasonably in destroying plaintiff's property in order to avoid harm to himself or his property, but risk of harm to plaintiff has not been created by plaintiff

  - *Ploof v. Putnam, **when def's servant untied a family's boat from a dock -- court found there was necessity to use the dock and did not constitute trespass, def did not have right to exclude from dock***

- Public -- when risk property of a sufficiently large number of people to make risk public (tearing plaintiff's house down to prevent spread of fire to remainder of town) -- privilege is absolute, a complete defense

- Private -- risk to one party or his property only, and party can reduce risk by damaging or destroying someone else's property -- qualified or conditional -- def may be liable for damage done to plaintiff's property

You dock your boat up to a porcelain dock in an upcoming storm:

*Vincent v. Lake Erie Transportation Co (Minn sup Ct 1910) 958: **you can trespass on to another person's property out of private necessity, but you are still liable for damages you cause to the dock (as destruction was not necessary)***

- Def mores ship to plaintiff's dock with upcoming storm

- Court finds no trespass because given the character of the storm, it would have been highly imprudent to attempt to leave (boat is more valuable than dock)

- But Court does award damages for injury to dock -- not a total act of god -- def advisedly took advantage of plaintiff's property for the purposes of preserving its own more valuable property

- Dissent: def should not be liable for damages because is was the result of an accident

- Abraham:

  - Between two innocent parties, **the one whom nature put at risk to bear the cost** rather than owner

  - Dock owner chose to have a dock where ships might tie up -- if we did not have this system, docks would be worth less (more risk) and ships would be worth more (more right)

*Policy -- Who should be liable in Trespass?*

- If dock owners can recover from non-negligent defendants during storms, then dock owners have less incentive to take measures to reduce risk of damage to their docks (and vice versa)

  - At the same time, if ship owners are not liable, then they will increasingly moor up on docks and risk damage

  - But with the Ploof and Vincent cases, threatening a party with liability gives this party incentive to compare the cost of liability with the cost of alternatives that may avoid liability (the threat induces more careful behavior)

  - Then it becomes a question of which party is in a better position to compare risk to the dock with risk to the ship (cheapest cost avoider)

  - If no party knows more, and no legal privilege, then maybe shipowners will be willing to pay for docking in storms (then balance costs)

    - Coase theorem -- Wrong-doer will pay as much as is profitable to continue to do the wrong

      - when parties themselves can identify the most cost-effective approach and can inexpensively set aside otherwise-applicable tort liability rule, then cost of courts' adopting the "wrong" rule is simply the cost of setting the rule aside in advance by contract

      - The same levels of production are achieved whether the perpetrator of the negative externalities is legally liable for the externality costs or is the victims of the negative externalities make a payment to the perpetrator that is reduced by the amounts of the externalities

## Nuisance

- A *[substantial]{.underline}* and *[unreasonable]{.underline}* interference with the right of an owner or occupier of land to the use and enjoyment of the land (usually pollution)

  - Public nuisance -- not a tort, but a species of low-level quasi criminal offense that affects general public in common (blocking public access to a highway)

  - Intentional Nuisance -- interference itself must be unreasonable

  - Unintentional -- like negligence -- something an owner would be able to do like selling an item

- Differences between trespass

  - Trespasser is liable for even trivial intrusions (a single act)

  - Granting an injunction is usually easier in trespass cases

*Private Nuisance*

- Courts must consider context and balance the equities to consider substantial (you don't want people "coming to the nuisance", like building a house next to a power plant)

  - But first person deserves active use is not the rule -- it would encourage development race

- Unintentional nuisance (arising out of negligent, reckless conduct, or abnormally dangerous conditions or activities (A "SL" tort)

- Injury must also be related to an invasion of interests in use and enjoyment of land

- Remedies

  - Factory may be required to pay for past and future harms, but may still be able to continue nuisance activity (Boomer)

- Unreasonableness requirement

  - A\) if gravity of harm outweighs utility of actor's conduct

  - B\) harm caused by conduct is serious and financial burden of compensating for this and similar harm to others would not make continuation of conduct feasible

- Gravity of Harm

  - Extent of harm

  - Character of harm

  - Social value that law attaches to type of use or enjoyment invaded

  - Suitability of use invaded to character of locality

  - Burden on person harmed of avoiding the ham

- Utility of Conduct:

  - Social value that law attaches to primary purpose of conduct

  - Suitability of conduct to character of locality

  - Impracticability of preventing or avoiding invasion

*Boomer v. Atlantic Cement Co (NY Ct of Appeals 1970) 683: **When a nuisance is of such a permanent and uneatable nature that a single recovery can be had, the Court will allow for damages (future), but not grant an injunction because of the public policy reasons against granting it; cost of discontinuing nuisance (in jobs and dollars) is grossly disproportionate to amount of harm nuisance was harming***

- Def operates cement plant and is sued by owners of neighboring land to injury from dirt, smoke, vibration

- Court grants payments that compensate for present and future loss, but refuses injunction

- Court is hesitant to address overall problem of pollution; does not want to put everyone out of work (Cos theorem -- service of factory is too great in shutting down)

- Dissent: this violates a rule about granting injunctions; licenses a wrong; private interest with no public benefit

Abraham on Nuisance

- Usually pollution, contamination or noise; substantial harm

- Formally a SL tort, but some negligence calculations come in to play on the Gravity vs. Utility prong, or on whether Plaintiff should bear ham overall

- Public nuisance -- not a tort, low level criminal activity (blocking access to a public highway)

- Private nuisance -- affects particular individuals and entities

- Even if you have a factory, then plaintiff builds house nearby in woods, you can still sometimes have nuisance

  - Permit def automatically to insulate himself from law of nuisance is giving him a right to restrict plaintiff's potential use and enjoyment simply by bing the first in the area to do something more with his land than natural condition

  - Plaintiff was using the woods beforehand

- Intent is not really that applicable here (if you know your plant will cause soot, you know it will land somewhere)

- Damages vs. Injunction

  - Court balances equities: faults, hardship on both side, value

    - Boomer: court found that important economic cement plant would not be enjoined because discontinuing nuisance cost was grossly disproportionate to amount of harm nuisance was causing (usually the outcome)

    - Look at 209 for factors on damages v. injunction

## Conversion

- Conversion -- tort against personal property rather than land

  - You have effectively become the owner because you do something only the owner can do (ex, stealing and selling a car) -- usually for a period of time

- Trespass of chattels -- mere minor damage to property that is not yours (stealing a car and denting it) (chattels are your personal property)

- Factor Test for Conversion: (1) plaintiffs\' ownership or right to possession of the property at the time of the conversion; (2) defendants\' conversion by a wrongful act or disposition of plaintiffs\' property rights; and (3) damages.

- Factor Test for Property Rights (Kremen): (1) an interest capable of precise definition, (2) it must be capable of exclusive control, and (3) the putative owner must have established a legitimate claim to exclusivity

- Remedies are different b/w conversion and trespass to chattels

  - Damages for complete value to property (conversion)

  - Trespass to chattels -- damages for whatever actual harm you caused

- Look at remedies to determine whether to apply conversion to trespass chattels (partial or continued use after harm done)

*Moore v. Regents of UC (Calif ct of appeal/sup ct) Handout**: Calif Sup Ct failed to find conversion when UC profited on discarded cells from surgery because Moore discarded his cells afterwards and valued relevant policy considerations of finding conversion***

- Without plaintiff's knowledge or consent, doctors used plaintiffs cells and patented them

- Appellate division found trespass because you can derive property benefits from cells, so they are plaintiff's personal property and therefore have conversion (no abandonment because you didn't have intent to discard)

- Supreme Court reverses, finding no property rights because cells were abandoned; finds a breach of physician's disclosure obligations instead of conversion

- Policy considerations

  - protection of a competent patient\'s right to make autonomous medical decisions vs. motivating researchers (hindering research)

  - Liability based upon existing disclosure obligations, rather than an unprecedented extension of the conversion theory, protects patients\' rights of privacy and autonomy without unnecessarily hindering research.

  - This is legislature's roles not ours

*Kremen v. Cohen (9th circ 2003): **Court found that an internet domain name (intangible property) satisfied property criteria primarily because registering a domain name is exclusive, and because registering a domain name informs others that domain name is no one else's, therefore conversion***

- Sex.com case where plaintiff owner sues theif and domain name services

- Court found that domain name is property because:

  - \(1\) a domain registrant decides where on the internet those who invoke that particular name are sent

  - \(2\) ownership is exclusive because the registrant alone makes that decision

  - \(3\) registering a domain name informs others that the domain name is the registrant's and no one else's

- Court was careful about making an extension -- domain fit already into definition, not extended

*Intel v. Hamdi (Calif Sup Ct 2003) Handout: **In this case, electronic communication does not constitute an actionable trespass to chattels as to personal property (the computer system) because it does not interfere with the use or possession of, or any other legally protected interest in, the personal property itself.***

- Ex-employee emailed criticizing statements to current employees; Intel sues for trespass

- California common law should not be extended to cover, as a trespass to chattels, an otherwise harmless e-mail whose contents are objectionable

- Court refuses to grant injunction, because no irreparable injury

  - You cannot just show you were harmed in an abstract intentional way- you have to show harm in an intentional way, such as slowing down the server or damaging the property in some way

- Dissent - The majority refused to distinguish the Internet from unauthorized intermeddling on a private Intranet

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  \- always do the equitable analysis                                         \- Discretions on injunctions by appealing to history and traditions         \- Patent trolls get leverage from injunctions so we should be cautious (thereby limiting tech innovations) -- so injunctions can be dangerous

  \- both lower courts used too broad or narrow way of granting injunctions   Property = injunction (because it would defeat purpose of property rights)   Right ≠ remedy

  Always do case-by-case analysis                                             Relatively easy to grand injunctions                                         

  Standard (not rule)                                                         Rule --excluding damages does not make sense                                 Standard (using a rule is a bad idea)
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*EBay v. Merchexchange LLC (Sup Ct 2006) Handout: **Court establishes factor test for granting injunction***

- Plaintiff must show

  - **(1) that it has suffered an irreparable injury;**

  - **(2) that remedies available at law are inadequate to compensate for that injury;**

  - **(3) that considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted;**

  - **(4) that the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction**

- Concurring Opinion Roberts: long standing tradition of granting injunctions -- it's not an entitlement but a discretionary function

- Concurring opinion (Kennedy): injunctions sometimes have consequences (not in public interest, leverage in pressuring, patent trolls etc.), but we still should grant it

- Problems with this factor test: it's redundant, prongs are interrelated and should not be considered independently, it is vague in irreparable

  - We are not talking about equitable remedies here

  - Fairness factors -- unclean hands -- other traditional concerns that are left out (estoppel, bad actor); overlapping factors

- Effect now is that courts apply this for all injunctions, not just patents; They will stretch it and especially focus on gov't interests in protecting land

  - Even with 4-part test, result would have come out the same -- does the 4-part test matter?

# VIII. Damages and Remedies

![](media/image9.png){width="6.0in" height="3.5in"}

## Compensatory Damages

- To return plaintiff as closely as possible to his condition before accident -- measure harm in past and future terms

- Pain and Suffering -- depends on how you *frame* the question to the jury: how much would you pay not to have this happen to you (before) vs. how much would you pay to go back (afterwards)

  - Some states have caps and maximums, but some courts have found that they violate Constitutional as an impermissible intrusion into jury's assessment of damages

- Factors to be considered: proportionality, consistency with past awards, who bears the loss (the public at large?)

- Principle of Single recovery (past and future losses)

  - Advantages: legal closure as case does not go on forever; legal incentive for plaintiff to stay sick disappears; def's financial exposure ends; lower administrative with one proceeding

  - Disadvantages: less accuracy; present value problem with inflation

*Seffert v. Los Angeles Transit Lines (Calif Sup Ct 1961) 711: **example of high compensatory damages that were upheld on appeal because of severity of injury; did not shock the conscience of the court***

- Plaintiff was severely injured for life and required multiple surgeries after being dragged along by a bus; Trial court issued 188k for plaintiff

- Court upheld damages as appropriate and not excessive: valid pecuniary lost calculation (medical bills, lost income) and high pain and suffering calculation (Trial Court is entitled to deference)

- Traynor Dissent:

  - Not proportional to low salary

  - Emphasis shift from ad hoc punishing in a mechanized society to orderly distribution of losses through insurance and the prices of goods -- loses are borne by a public free of fault

  - Consistency: highest award in history

## Punitive Damages

- Huang: we still may want to deter negligence with punitive damages because it is still something we want to deter, especially when it has serious ramifications

- Reasons defendants might not self-deter before PD:

  - Def knows potential plaintiffs face difficulty in proving causation and does not expect them to sue

  - Def wishes to harm plaintiff and is willing to pay compensatory damages to be able to do so

  - Defendant has been paying insufficient attention to the threat of liability for compensatory damages

- Gore Guideposts

  - 1\) Degree of reprehensibility of def's misconduct

  - 2\) Disparity b/w actual or potential harm suffered by plaintiff and punitive damage award

  - 3\) Difference between punitive damages awarded by jury and civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases

  Other plaintiffs might not come forward                                               Look at motive/nature of acts of def

  Gets their attention (for big companies)                                              

  It's possible to have nominative and punitive damages (to make up for other limits)

*Exonn Shipping v. Baker (Sup Ct 2008) Handout**: in federal maritime cases, Souter believes it is appropriate to cap punitive damages at a 1:1 ratio with compensatory damages***

- Original award by district court was 500m compensatory and 2.5b punitive (9^th^ circuit later reduced)

- Souter found that a 1:1 ratio was appropriate as upper limit:

  - The Court needs to be especially conscientious of highly punitive verdicts as they may be unfair

  - Juries are inconsistent and you need a system for courts to reach an optimal level of penalty and deterrence (like criminal system where you don't want to have unequal sentences)

  - Cap is untenable because court will not be able to modify routinely (arbitrary)

- Dissent: no state courts have adopted this common multiplier rule

- Exonn wanted a reputation of litigating aggressively

*State Farm v. Campbell (US Sup Ct 2003) 760: **single digit ratio is most usually appropriate when considering punitive damages; 145:1 is a DP violation***

- Campbell and former plaintiffs got together to try and show that state farm engaged in nation-wide practice of forcing people to litigate rather than settle (because they have a liability maximum, they want to see if they do not have to pay) Jury awarded 1m compensatory and 145m punitive

- Kennedy held the ratio was too high under DP and applied the 3 Gore guideposts

  - 1\) Degree of reprehensibility of def's misconduct

    - Defs deserve no praise in their conduct, but nationwide activities are not really applicable since they bear no relation to Campbell's harm (DP

  - 2\) Disparity b/w actual or potential harm suffered by plaintiff and punitive damage award

    - No bright-line ratio, but 145:1 is too high; single-digit ratio is appropriate

    - Compensatory damages contain a punitive element as well

  - 3\) Difference between punitive damages awarded by jury and civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases

    - not really applicable -- loss of business license and disgorgement of profits

- Scalia Dissent: DP clause offers no substantive protections against excessive or unreasonable awards of punitive damages

- Ginsberg Dissent: damage capping legislation available; state sovereignty when federal courts instate a single-digit ratio

*WR Grace & Co v. Waters -- **repetitive awards and asbestos -- court refused to bar multiple awards of punitive damages and put a limit on punitive damage claims just because the company would be repeatedly charged for the same claims by various plaintiffs because of the company\'s own negligence***

*Philip Morris USA v. Williams (Sup Ct 2006) Handout: **when considering punitive damages under DP, you cannot consider \[alleged\] harm to 3^rd^ parties ("Strangers to the litigation") as its own prong (though you may consider it peripherally in relation to the degree of reprehensibility)***

- Widow of heavy smoker sues Phillip Morris and gets 821 in compensatory and 80m in punitive damages

  - Oregon Court tried to say that this is distinguished from State Farm by saying that harm is similar to others

- Breyer ordered a new trial on DP grounds with new instructions to the jury:

  - DP prohibits a State to use punitive damages to punish a def for injury it inflicts to non parties (strangers to the litigation), since there is no authority and we would have a standard-less determination

  - Jury can consider harm to others in considering the degree of reprehensibility, but cannot go any father than that

  - State Court cannot create confusion

- Stevens dissent: novel limit on State's power to impose punishment on civil litigation (harming others should not) be taken into account

  - Distinction between 3^rd^ parties in reprehensibility and punishing def directly eludes Stevens

- Ginsberg Dissent: what is the point of punitive damages then? Oregon court followed BMW appropriately; plus, Phillip never objected to jury instructions at trial

- Kicker: jury instructions were crazy after this ruling and unclear

*Grimshaw v. Ford (Pinto case 1972): **Court upheld very high punitive damage ratio (1:75) because Ford distributed a memo which put value on human life in relation to lower safety standards***

- Kicker was that this memo was not about pinto but in response to a proposed safety rule to later manufactured cars; and 200k/human life was from gov't

- But reprehensibility came from that they deliberately included a dangers feature in design because of cost

## Class Actions and Settlement Classes

Reasons for Wanting a Mass Torts Class Action:

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Plaintiff**                                      **Defendant**                        **Society**
  -------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ ---------------------------------------------------
  \$ is too small to bring individually              Done, "*global peace*", preclusion   Administrative Benefits/coordination

  Pool Resources                                                                          Avoids clogging the court

  Helpful for establishing a pattern (evidentiary)                                        Substitute for distributional benefits of damages

  Duplication (same expert)                          Duplication

### 

### Litigation Classes vs. Settlement Classes

- Litigation Class

  - Must meet requirements of Rule 23

  - 23e -- Court has to approve any settlement to ensure class' interests are best met (Fairness, no kickbacks)

- Settlement classes -- certifying a class only for settlement

  - Kind of "contracting around the law"

  - Are we worried about there being a **fair fight**? Removing adversity, judge does not hear arguments against class; parties want same outcome, to bind parties

  - What about plaintiffs who aren't present too and their interests?

  - Court might not be doing DD because they just have to approve settlements on the dotted line

  - Issues of notice, variations in harm

- Subclasses -- generic solution to some problems with aggregating large, diverse classes

  - Tradeoff is that some of the efficiency brining it all together is compromised

- Litigation Class vs. Settlement Class

  - \[File -- cert -- settle\] vs. \[settle -- file -- cert for settlement -- one package\]

*Amchem Products v. Windsor: **asbestos settlement class: you still need to do a robust Rule 23 analysis for a mass tort settlement class, with "common questions of law and fact" among class members***

- In asbestos CA, question was whether to include all plaintiffs who were or would become injured as a result of exposure

- Court rejected settlement class because it did not meet the Rule 23 criteria in lack of commonality -- they should have divided it into subclasses

- Concerns over:

  - Adequacy of representation

  - Inter-class conflict (people injured now vs. future) -- they will have different opinions/incentives of how fund is used (invested or doled out now)

    - Variations in harms

    - Future plaintiffs

  - Adequacy of notice

- Breyer Dissent: settlement is important here; Differences in state law or uncommon questions should not make a difference; Sup Ct is too distant to decide on commonality here

- Facially, it is not harder to get a settlement class cert; Tidmarsh thinks it is actually easier

- Court did not articulate circumstances under which mass tort class actions would be appropriate - single calamitous event?

### Punitive Damages Classes

*Sharkey Article*

- PD are important because they have an important societal element and avoid the DP issues of damages for harm done to non-present plaintiffs

- Viability of the punitive damages class depends upon the persuasiveness of the societal conception of punitive damages

- Phillip Morris did not present a problem for PD classes since Court left untouched the non-retributive deterrence conception of punitive damages as a legitimate state interest

*In re Simon (Tobacco Certification case): **PD class cert does not work here because it does not bear sufficient nexus to actual and potential harm to plaintiff class***

- Weinstein tries to create a PD class for this mass tort in a mandatory limited fund (using the constitutional ceiling on PD ration)

  - Advocates for an advisory jury that would make a class-wide determination of harm and PD to whole class (actual jury would then determine whether conduct warranted damages)

  - This is an innovation with an "advisory" jury

- Surgeons do not support this PD class cert because of preclusive effects on unrepresented parties and DP concerns:

  - No futures -- people who develop disease later

  - Excludes second-hand smokers as well

- Chamber of commerce do not support cert because of jurisdictional concerns: New York has no legitimate interest in punishing conduct that took place outside its borders; that's what federalism is all about

- Holding: Weinstein's PD Class Cert Denied

  - There is no evidence to ascertain the limits of either the fund or the aggregate value of punitive claims against it, such that the postulated fund could be deemed inadequate to pay all legitimate claims.

  - Certification Order would fail to ensure that a jury will be able to assess an award that, in the first instance, will bear a sufficient nexus to the actual and potential harm to the plaintiff class, and that will be reasonable and proportionate to those harms

*"Repeat" Punitive Damages*

- Should PD decisions be awarded for successive plaintiffs?

- Problems

  - Each jury is not aware of other suits and awards high PDs, so you over-punish defendant

  - Problematic for deterrence in that you are over-punishing for societal/other ham repeatedly

  - Why should 1^st^ plaintiff get the windfall over other plaintiffs?

  - When you have a "core" bad to everyone you should not punish def more than once with PDs

    - Counter: you can include core badness piecemeal for each plaintiff

  - Tension between deterrence and punishment

  - With Weinstein's theory of PD class, you avoid the problem of over punishment with juries thinking they are the only case punishing defs, so we do not run out of money from the "PD fund"

- Pros

  - Repetition is ok because harm is worse with more plaintiffs coming forward and def should be punished accordingly

  - With the SF 1:10 ratio, you are only punishing for 10 people of extra harm, so you need repetition to reach optimal level of deterrence (for 100 people for example)

  - You should allow repeat PDs if you cannot consider harm to 3^rd^ parties

### Alternatives to Class Actions (MDL and Compensation Funds)

*MDL*

- Essentially consolidation across districts

- Bellwether trials:

  - Consolidates all trials to one jurisdiction for fact-finding/discovery

  - In theory, transferee district sends back for individualized trials, but parties usually end up settling

- Judge decides during settlement what is an acceptable way of contracting around the law (preclusive effect; similar to CA) (only transferee judge authorizes settlement)

- Problems: opt-out, are plaintiffs required to accept settlements?

- Pros: not binding, you get an idea of the merits of the whole case where you could not from an individual case

- *Vioxx* showed that Bellwethers might not be that informative, and parallel litigation might still be important (Vioxx settled despite favorable Bellwether trails because they did not want people to opt-out or have cases get sent back to original jurisdictions after MDL)

*Compensation Funds*
