# The Aims of Tort Law

## General Policy Points

- We don't like to punish just for risk creation.

- Tort law may sometimes adapt to changing times- EG custom, evolution of injunction test

## Overview

![](media/image1.png){width="6.263888888888889in" height="6.252083333333333in"}

- Tort law might also be a mixed system; which one or combination of these goals is more important will vary given the circumstances

## Deciding Who Should Pay Based on Aims of Tort Law (Includes Examples from Cases)

- **Deterrence**

  - **Hammontree:**

    - We don't want to **over-deter people who aren't dangerous** drivers.

    - Social implications of **discriminating/shutting away** people just because they have a disability.

  - **Who is in a better position to protect against the risk?**

<!-- -->

- **Corrective justice**

  - Argue based on how direct the connection is between P and D. Does D have insurance?

<!-- -->

- **Fairness**

  - **Two relatively innocent parties:** In cases like Hammontree (epilepsy), both parties are innocent. Does fairness dictate that business owners having more resources than individuals should pay, especially because the seizure was beyond J's control? Or are resources irrelevant because payment isn't about who has what?

  - **Who is in a better position to protect against the risk?**

1.  []{#_heading=h.3znysh7 .anchor}Aims of Tort Law and When We Should Require Fault (Strict Liability vs Negligence)

    - **Alternate Scheme: New Zealand No Fault System:** As long as injury falls within legislative scheme, you are covered regardless of fault or when injury happened

      - Serves Fairness

        - P does not have to suffer for judgment proof defendants

        - City steps in where there are two relatively innocent parties. Neither is unfairly burdened

      - Serves Civil Recourse: Plaintiff's harm is always recognized, and they are given the right to recover for it

      - Does not serve corrective justice -- no moral balance restored between 2 parties

      - Does not serve deterrence either for P or D

      - Goes both ways on administrative costs:

        - Might be more efficient to let accident occur; but city is still giving money

        - Decreases expensive fact findings and trials that go into negligence determination.

    - **Hammontree arguments for staying with negligence:**

      - Difference from Product Liability Cases, where there is strict liability for manufacturers: Manufacturers are distributing goods to public at large. Not just about insurers bearing cost.

      - Maloney rejected SL where fact patterns can get complicated

      - Overinclusive **--** Driver might be struck by illness he could not have foreseen because of no prior history. Unfair to impose fault.

      - Legislature should decide.

# Negligence

## The Objective Reasonable Person Standard

- **Objecitvity**

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Pros of Objectivity**                                                                                                                   **Cons of Objectivity**
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Cost/East of Adjudication**---including mental ability creates line drawing issues/less measurable                                      

  Jury doesn't have to enter D mind; D doesn't have incentives to mislead jury about characteristics.                                       Jury already looks at state of mind in criminal cases

  **Activity Levels:** Objective standard influences activity levels and informs society on self- protective care they need to take.        

  **Optimal Deterrence**: Incentive for highest care and more uniform care on D's part, easier for self-protective care on P part.          For Ds to exercise all care and skill they must actually know the standard

  **Fairness** -- everyone treated equally. If some exempt, they benefit from higher care of other people without taking care themselves.   **Fairness** doesn't always mean treating everyone the same
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Who Decides -- Judge v Jury:

a.  Currently, jury decides what a reasonable person would do.

    i.  Pros:

        1.  Reflects community norms.

        2.  Maybe more appropriate when it is a question of community norms. Jury is more competent to decide that.

            a.  Eg Vaughn -- in early 19^th^ century, jury would probably know how far hay should be kept to avoid fire.

            b.  Today -- equivalent should be whether D took care in changing lanes on 4 lane highway.

        3.  Can take circumstances into account -- Eg did you recklessly change lanes because you were driving your friend to the hospital?

    ii. Cons/When it may not be a good idea

        1.  Inconsistency -- Different fact patterns and different values might lead juries to go different ways on similar cases. Nothing about negligence requires perfect consistency.

            a.  When certain fact patterns appear in the same form over and over, and we don't want juries deciding inconsistently, maybe give it to judge and make it a rule.

                i.  **Counterargument: Can be overinclusive.** Circumstances where following the law would be more dangerous; or rule out all the possibilities and show that in all of them, following the rule is more dangerous

                    1.  EG Pokora: 1) He gets out and gets hit by train 2) He gets out, thinks it's fine, gets back in car and ends up getting hit by train

                    2.  EG things falling out of bins on airplanes.

### External Standards

## Custom

- Hurts the first sued.

- Discouraging innovation and other opportunities to be safe.

## Tailoring the Standard

#### Rationales for Current Tailoring/Not Tailoring

- Tailor Children

  - Observable: People have notice they are dealing with a child

  - Corrective Justice More Attenuated: More likely to be covered under parent's insurance policies

  - Requires line-drawing (17-18)

  - **Area for change:** Empirical evidence based on different brain function development of boys and girls. Take it into account for kids? For adults?

- Tailor Superior Ability

  - Fairness -- Live up to full capacity

  - Optimal Deterrence -- highest care possible

  - Counterarguments:

    - Don't people act on instinct sometimes?

- Tailoring Physical Infirmity

  - Observable

    - Counter: You can classify some illnesses as mental or physical infirmity. Take Ramsbottom's stroke.

  - Fairness

    - Counter -- can cut either way

- No tailoring for Mental infirmity

  - Efficiency: Not observable (contrast physical)

  - Deterrence: Having it as defense can create perverse incentives

  - Counterarguments:

    - Fairness?

    - Severe mental infirmities might be observable

  - **Area for Change:** Science is changing the way we think about mental infirmity

- No Tailoring for Mental ability

  - Not measurable

  - Perverse incentives for deterrence.

#### Opportunities for Tailoring:

- **Advanced technology as an argument for lowering a heightened standard back to reasonable care:**

  - Ex ***Bethel*** -- Heightened standard for common carriers --"As far as human prudence and foresight can go"

    - Do we no longer need a heightened standard of care or does ordinary care under the circumstances already account for cases in which heightened care is required?

- **Heighten it for dangerous instrumentality**?

  - Straw buying for guns:

    - For:

      - Jury might not know what do with reasonable standard

      - Send message to carriers -- They won't want to lose their license over one sale

      - Informational Asymmetry: Who is better positioned to bear loss?

    - Against:

      - Circumstances might indicate what was reasonable. EX in Bethel the straw buyer was right there and indicated that it was a straw transaction

      - Minimal effect on deterrence: Are you really deterring a small number of bad repeat players, or putting a higher standard on everyone else?

<!-- -->

- **Emergencies:**

  - **For:**

    - How can jury imagine what is ordinary in extraordinary circumstances.

    - Deterrence and Foeseeability: We don't foresee emergencies and you can't really deter in that setting.

    - Fairness -- sometimes parties act on instinct.

  - **Against:**

    - **Institutional Competence**: jury knows what it's like to be in an accident...that's the whole point of sending cases to juries

    - **Fairness**: Must still apportion liability between two parties

    - Emergencies aren't entirely unforeseeable

  - **Alternative Scheme**: Michigan has a best judgment rule as long as the person didn't create the emergency.

# Duty

- Duty to warn -- tension between consumer sovereignty and obviously dangerous products (we didn't really talk about it in class. It was in Abraham)

  - If you want to argue that D didn't have duty to warn, you want to show that the warning would not have made a difference. One possible way is to show that for the activity considered, consumers always disregard the warning. EG: consumers always remove guard off power tools despite warnings not to do so.

- Informed consent:

  - Reasonable patient standard -- Jury decides. Need expert evidence on what risks and benefits are, but not what breach is. Jury decides

  - Reasonable doctor -- Industry decides

  - They might converge because physicians give more info out of concern.

- Special Relationship -- Psychiatrist and Patient -- Tarasoff

  - **Arguments against Tarasoff result:**

    - Liability is far reaching

    - Confidentiality might be important to treat mentally ill patients in the first place. So actually having a chilling effect on not only the cure, but the profession.

# Causation

- But for causation -- exposing P to risk is a wrong in itself. We are missing those who are blameworthy. The only reason we don't recognize that is that it's impractical -\> Ton of suits and those plaintiffs don't need the money.

- Multiple sufficient causes: Why do we think differently when its 2 tortious actors vs 1 tortious actor + 1 act of god?

  - Moral luck

- Proximate cause -- cut off liability later. Duty cuts off liability as a matter of law.

- Eggshell plaintiff rule: Who is in a better position to guard against the risks? The 'eggshell plaintiff' might know more about their condition and be in a better position to guard against the risk.

- Maybe alternative liability deals with information asymmetry.

# Lost Chance

- Maybe limited to medical cases because less reliable statistical data about probability of harm in other fields

- Without lost chance, arbitrary line drawing -- 49% chance before doctor vs 51% chance without doctor

- Difference in lost chance cases -- patient carries increased risk of harm forever

- Reason for requiring accompanying death (possibly): giving resources to those who need it most.

- Possible reform: Allow recovery even when patients have over 50% chance of survival

# Market Share Liability

- May depart from causation.

# Strict Liability

- Not entirely clear that SL🡪 Only activity levels and N 🡪 Only care

- Why we don't apply SL:

  - Effect on victim incentives

  - Over-deterring socially desirable activities

  - Coordination benefits

  - Blameworthiness

- Maybe first bite rule can extend elsewhere

# Property Torts

- Who can best bear the risk

- Why P should pay for private necessity -- chose to risk damaging property to save own

- Boomer and Ebay -- more standards based; departed from more rules based approaches

  - Maybe want rules for business method patents

- Coase theorem: May want to stick liability to party that can free up bargaining power, either because they are holding out or being strategic.

# Remedies 

## Compensatory Damages

- No pure economic loss -- draw lines some other way (contract, but-for causation, even geography) OR maybe you want crushing liability

- Law's concern that people would be reluctant to participate in socially beneficial activities if they were concerned that liability for an accident extended to its innumerable effects.

### Statutory Damages

- Pros: Rule, predictable and everyone gets something

- Con: Inflexible, not in line with aims of tort law, may still be profitable to infringe, claims can stack up

### 

### Punitive Damages

- Repeat punitive damages

- By letting jury decide, society decides how much to punish defendants and what harms to recognize.

## 

## Injunctions

- Test whether injunction should be awarded for nuisance:

  - In valuing D's activity to community as a whole, the doctrine doesn't consider whether P gets the benefit.

  - Doesn't account for disparity in resources.

- Ebay

  - Rejected bright line rule for awarding injunctions -- used 4 part test.

  - Automatic injunction ignores public interest

  - BUT undermines right to exclude from property.
