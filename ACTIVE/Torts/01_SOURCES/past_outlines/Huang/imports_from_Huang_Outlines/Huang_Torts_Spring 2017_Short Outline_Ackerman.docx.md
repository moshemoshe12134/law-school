[**Abnormally dangerous activity**:]{.underline}

1)  Foreseeability

2)  Highly significant risk

3)  Common usage (can be framed -- to people/area/industry)

    a)  Also consider: location appropriateness and value to community

**[Animal]{.underline}:**

1)  **Highly vicious?** If yes, then strict liability

2)  **Non-vicious animal?** If yes, then no negligence (one-bight rule)

    a)  Consider if animal is causing injury as animal (or as football thrown across the street)

**[Benefits of SL v. Negligence]{.underline}**

1)  Reduces information costs (costly to determine proof of negligence)

2)  Reduces error costs (more predictable, less fact-intensive)

3)  Influences activity levels and research decisions

4)  Distributes loss

5)  Rights-based theories:

    a)  Benefit: those benefiting from activity should rightly bear costs associated

    b)  Reciprocity: SL should be imposed when activity poses risks for potential victims that victims do not pose for others

**Choosing:**

- If you can take (more care) to eliminate risk you are in the world of negligence

- If you cannot eliminate the risk with more care, you are in the world of SL

# (5) Intentional Torts

**[[Trespass to land]{.underline}]{.mark}: (STRICT LIABILITY)**

1)  **Elements:**

    a)  **Entry** 🡪 anything fits, including intangibles (bacteria?)

    b)  **Harm** 🡪 not necessary (presumptive invasion of ownership feelings); BUT if no injury🡪nominal damages

    c)  **Intent** 🡪 only need intent to enter land; NOT intent to enter someone else's land (no intent 🡪 negligence)

2)  **Defenses to trespass: Necessity Exceptions**

    a)  **Private necessity: qualified/conditional defense (must compensate)**

        i)  **When:** risk to one party's property only, who can reduce/eliminate risk by damaging someone else's

        ii) **Liability:** D liable to P for damage to P's property; privilege conditioned on P later compensating

        iii) **Incentivizes cheapest cost avoidance calculation** (deterrence)

    b)  **Public necessity: absolute defense (no compensation)**

        i)  **When:** risk to property of many ('public') can be reduced by damaging property of D

+--------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| Owner (cuts ship) *like N*     | *[Unreasonable]{.underline}*: owner must pay damages | *[Reasonable]{.underline}*: owner need **not** pay damages |
+================================+======================================================+============================================================+

**[[Nuisance]{.underline}]{.mark}:** **substantial & unreasonable interference with right of [real property]{.mark} owner to enjoy land**

1)  Unreasonable and substantial interference with person's use and enjoyment of their real property

2)  Gravity of harm outweighs utility of conduct? (Factors from restatement)

3)  Coming to the nuisance? Continued nuisance? Injunction v. damages?

4)  **[GO TO THE RESTATEMENT IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT THIS ! ! !]{.underline}**

**[[Conversion]{.underline}]{.mark} (like trespass, but with [personal property]{.mark}):**

1)  **Elements:**

    a)  **P owns real property** ([Kremen]{.underline} provides 3 part test; all property meets it)

        i)  Interest capable of precise defintion

        ii) Capable of exclusive possession or control

        iii) Putative owner must have legitimate claim to exclusivity

        iv) *See also*: Tangibility requirement (physical item) or Merger requirement (tangible document merged)

    b)  **Wrongful deprivation** (D deprives P or property; must be **permanent/indefinite**; not giving back)

    c)  **Unauthorized conduct by D** (did not have P's permission)

    d)  **Harm or injury** (damages = full value of good converted + loss of extra profits OR return of property)

**[[Trespass to chattels]{.underline}]{.mark} (interference with possession of [personal property]{.mark}):** recovery for *interference* with possession of personal property, but *not severe or important enough* to be conversion.

1)  **Impaired use of chattel v. Conversion**:

    a)  **Duration of interference** (forever gone or just a few days?)

    b)  **Type of possession** (stole care or sat in back seat?)

    c)  **Profit/benefit to defendant** (used machine to make \$ or just blocked usage of machine?)

2)  **Elements: (1) Intentionally (2) interfered with the (3) P's right of possession in chattel; (4) injury**

    a)  **No requirement for D's ownership** (only current right of possession)

    b)  **Intent: to touch or use** (not intent to invade legal right or harm chattel

    c)  **[Actual injury]{.underline}**: BIGGEST DIFFERENCE FROM TRESPASS TO LAND; For liability, need (1) actual damage; (2) actual dispossession f the chattel; (3) loss of use of the chattel for some appreciable amount of time, OR (4) harm to P or to something or someone in whom P had legal interest, because of D's action.

# (6) Damages

**[Property v. Liability rules]{.underline} (for private nuisance specifically):**

1)  Possibility of bargaining: (low *n*, relationship-Injunction) (high *n*, strangers, bilateral monopoly-damages)

2)  Existence or measurement of damages (if difficult to measure-Injunction)

3)  Administrative costs (Damages may be costly/erroneous to estimate for court; Injunction needs maintenance)

4)  Fairness factors and concerns about CCA

**[Legal remedies]{.underline}:**

1)  Compensatory damages 🡪 includes pain and suffering for physical injury

    a)  Pain and suffering: for physical damage only; cap? Purpose?

    b)  Single recovery: only one recovery including past & future losses

    c)  Inchoate and future loss: no independent COA for losses yet to occur, must wait for actual occurrence

    d)  Reasonably certain through preponderance of the evidence

    e)  Disgorgement: Huang-Equipoise effect (part of time doesn\'t change incentives of former remedy all time)

2)  Punitive damages (still ongoing)

    a)  Purposes: Deterrence (absolute or optimal) and Punishment (justice and retribution)

    b)  When: *small incentive for many little suits*, *hard to detect*

    c)  Problems: bankruptcy, uncertainty, encourages vindictiveness and revenge-seeking state of mind, DPC

    d)  Procedures: *Bifurcation*-liability for PD at all? If yes, jury sets PD award; *Special verdict*-jury gives findings on factual issues not necessarily stating which party should win, judge decides Q's and draws legal implications

    e)  Repetitive awards: punitive damages multiple times over, may violate DPC

3)  Nominal damages

**[Equitable remedies]{.underline}:**

1)  Permanent injunctions ([eBay]{.underline} test)

    a)  4-factors:

        i)  Suffered irreparable harm

        ii) Remedies at law are inadequate to compensate

        iii) Balance of hardships between P & D (is injunction warranted)

        iv) Public interest (is it disserved by granting injunction?)

2)  TRO/Preliminary Injunctions

**[Statutory remedies]{.underline}:**

1)  Set by legislatures (may be criminal-like)

2)  Pro: fair notice/deterrence, predictable, incentivize suit, actual damages may be difficult to calculate

3)  Problems: inflexible, may be arbitrary, tailoring & judicial freedom

**[Limitations on damages]{.underline}:**

1)  **Partial defenses**

    a)  Proximate cause?

    b)  Contributory negligence?

2)  **Full defenses to injury**

    a)  **"Pure" economic harm**: no liability; must have property or personal damage to recover economic loss

        i)  **Exceptions**: NJ allowed pure economic harm if it is foreseeable

        ii) **Pros if allowed**: easily calculable, recognizes compensatory aim of tort law, added deterrence

        iii) **Cons if allowed**: causation difficult to determine without injury, chilling effect

    b)  **"Pure" emotional harm**: no liability without physical injury

        i)  **Why**: would open floodgates (anything can be emotional loss); potential for fraud; require standards of reasonable care that don't exist; legal resources limited, save for people needing it more.

        ii) **Exceptions**: mishandle corpse of loved one, telegram incorrectly announcing death (STD?)

3)  **Judicial Review**

    a)  **Too speculative: must be 'reasonably certain'**

        i)  **Appeals: "Shocks the conscience"**

    b)  **Additur:** jury award unduly low, must add or retrial

    c)  **Remittitur:** jury award unduly high, must lower or retrial

4)  **Alternative Limits:**

    a)  **DPC for punitive damages**

    b)  **Statutory Ceiling/cap**

# (7) Mass torts

**[Class actions]{.underline} (FRCP 23):**

1)  **Requirements for all classes (a)**

    a)  **Numerosity** (joinder impracticable)

    b)  **Commonality** (common question of law or fact); Posner-use subclasses or sub-issues

    c)  **Typicality** (claims or defenses of representative parties typical of claims or defenses of the class)

    d)  **Adequate representation** (representative party will fairly and adequately protect class' interest)

2)  **Types of classes (b); Need AT LEAST ONE of:**

    a)  **Limited fund/Inconsistency**: limited pool for recovery or incompatible legal standards

        i)  **Notice mandatory & cannot drop out**

    b)  **Injunctive class:** injunction or declaratory relief; remedy would itself affect entire class

        i)  **Must show:** D acted or refused to act on ground applying generally to class (common practice)

        ii) **Notice not mandatory**

    c)  **Damages class** (most common and controversial; most difficult to certify)

        i)  **Requirements:**

            (1) **Common issues [predominate]{.underline}**

            (2) **Class action is superior to alternative methods** for fairly & efficiently adjudicating controversy

            (3) **Need notice & opt-out mechanism**

3)  Sub-classes and issue classes?

4)  **Mass Settlements (e):** Non-adversarial class action settlement requiring judge's approval.

    a)  **Requires:** notice and Fairness Hearing, where 3^rd^ parties can object, etc.

**[Multi-District Litigation]{.underline}?**

1)  **Protective effect; non-binding if Opt-Out; Judges apoitn special masters & manage settlement**

2)  Can we bargain or settle?
