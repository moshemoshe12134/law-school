# **NEGLIGENCE**

## **Reasonable person**

**B. Children and the Infirm**

Not withstanding the objective standard, the law has always made certain accommodations for children and the inform. The scope of these accommodations sheds some additional light on the overall purpose of the objective standard

1\. Children

- Children below the age of 5 cannot be negligent at all -- cannot be expected to exercise care

- Until mid-20^th^ century, expectation was that children above that age should exercise care that would be reasonable in a child of similar age, intelligence and experience

  - "Semi-objective standard," in that reasonableness of the child's behavior measured against the capacities in the age group

  - Child of unusual intelligence might be expected to exercise more care than others his age

  - Rule concession to reality that there is a limit to the degree of care that can be expected of children: incentive-creating effects of an objective standard on adults highly unlikely to influence children

  - Until mid-20^th^ century, little point to suing children in tort because parents were not and are not liable for torts of their children (though potentially liable for negligent supervision), and children have no assets

  - Younger the child, the more likely to have a claim of negligent supervision against parents

- **Semi-objective standard** has now been qualified in many jurisdictions, by proviso that when children engage in dangerous adult activities, held to an adult standard of care

  - Potential of children who drive boats, airplanes, etc -- no way for someone to actually anticipate that it's a child driving

  - No benefit to immunizing child

  - With rise of post-WWII auto and homeowners' insurance, much more likely than in past that child is independently insured under parents' liability insurance

  - Where insurance has gone, tort law has followed

2\. Infirm adults

- Pinpointing the standard that applies to physically and mentally infirm adults is more complicated

- **Typically, physical infirmities are taken into account** when determining the reasonableness of the behavior but **mental ones are not**

  - Ie, insane can be liable for their torts

- Why? What's the reason for allowing physical but not mental considerations

  - Physical infirmities are visible, measurable, and verifiable

  - Mental infirmities are invisible, hard to measure, and incompletely verifiable

  - Whole focus of the objective standard is on this

- Objective standard rejects the assertion that someone doesn't have judgment or intelligence to be as careful as the reasonable person, not because it isn't true, but because it may be false and it's difficult to know what's true and what isn't

  - People who suffer from delusions have periods of lucidity, maybe obligation to take action to prevent self from causing these problems (basis of *Breunig v. American Family Ins*, in which defendant thought that she and her car could fly)

  - Application of the more **general emergency doctrine -- when danger arises without warning, circumstance may be taken into account in assessing reasonableness of the behavior of the party faced with danger**

    - However, when warning, fact that there was opportunity for deliberation rather than instinctive reaction must be taken into account

  - People who are psychotic may still be able to exercise care: just because I think I'm Napoleon doesn't mean I don't know that I should stop at red lights

  - Finally, people often have guardians -- incentive diminished if mentally ill not held for negligence

- Physical infirmities pose measurement and verifiability problems to much lesser degree, therefore subject to semi-objective standard

  - Blind person can't read warning signs, so tough to hold liable for negligence if smoking in a room w/flammable vapors

  - At the same time, blind people shouldn't drive, probably; jury can take into account that fact when determining whether should have taken different or extra precautions

- Over time, social attitudes toward physical and mental infirmities have evolved in favor of greater and greater involvement of the disabled in everyday activities

  - What might be considered an imprudent risk 30 years ago might be seen as OK today

***Gross v. Allen*** (N.J. 1975)

**[Facts]{.underline}**: Skiing accident -- plaintiff presumably injured. Defendant 17 years old, on beginner slope, never skied before. Trial court instructs jury that applicable standard of care applicable was not the same as that of an adult, but the degree of care a reasonably prudent person of that age would use in the same situation. Appeal on evidence, but appellate court, sua sponte, raises issue of plain error. Says that trial court erred in instruction: applicable standard is an adult standard of care, because skiing is an adult activity, dangerous to others, like driving a motor vehicle

**[Issue]{.underline}:** What applicable standard of care for a 17 year old skier?

**[Holding]{.underline}**: Trial court was correct -- care exercised by reasonably prudent person of same age in same situation. Reversed and judgment for defendant reinstated.

**[Reasoning]{.underline}**: Certain activities done by minors are so inherently dangerous as to require adult standard of care, like driving or operating a motor boat. However, in those situations, minors are licensed, must demonstrate adult competence. Skiing does not have those same requirements. Appellate court also says that should have tried a 17 year like an 18 year old, who would be deemed an adult. Supreme Court says that line has to be drawn somewhere, age of legal maturity is 18 in NJ, and defendant wasn't 18. No reason to change

**Gender (from Casebook)**

- Gender references regarding reasonable conduct, among other issues, persuasively male in content

- Unclear impact on women, whether created more favorable or unfavorable treatment of female litigants

- "Recognizing difference may lead to marginalization, while ignoring difference may lead to inequitable results -- Syclla and Charybdis of feminist theory"

**Mental Ability (from casebook)**

- *Vaughan v. Menlove*: Defendant landowner piled hay in way that created fire hazard to neighbors, including plaintiff. Fire occurred, plaintiff sued and won. Defendant sought new trial on ground that instead of charging the standard of ordinary prudence, judge should have asked jury to decide whether the man acted to best of judgment, since he was (essentially) mentally unfit.

  - Court rejects: **"It would leave so vague a line as to afford no rule at all, degree of judgment belonging to each individual being infinitely various"**

**Physical Disability (from casebook)**

- *Roberts v. Ramsbottom*: judge found that the 73 YO suffered stroke a few minutes before going to drive -- no previous warnings or symptoms. Didn't know that he was unfit to drive, so started driving, presumably crashed.

  - Court: "Driver will escape liability if his actions at the time were totally out of his control, ie sudden unconsciousness. But if retained some, imperfect control, culpable. "One cannot accept as exculpation anything less than total loss of consciousness

  - Alternatively, liability on basis of failure to realize after one or two incidents unfit to drive. Not morally to blame for failing to realize it, defendant nonetheless responsible for failing to appreciate proper significance of mishaps

**Superior Attributes (from casebook)**

- Actors with skills or knowledge exceeding those possessed by others are circumstances that should be taken into account.

- *Dakter v. Cavallino*: Court affirmed a trial court instruction that a semi-truck driver would exercise the degree of care that a reasonable semi-truck driver would exercise under the circumstances

**Children (casebook)**

- Apart from statues making parents vicariously liable for malicious mischief, parents are rarely vicariously liable for their children. May be liable for negligence in permitting child to do something dangerous

- Narrow scope: plaintiffs must often sue child directly. Children traditionally held to blended standard -- recognizes age, abilities, but also objective component: how would a reasonably prudent child of his/her age, intelligence, experience act?

- Minority rule: Children below the age of 6 or 7 conclusively presumed unable to comprehend risk sufficiently to be held negligent. Rebuttable presumption for children ages 7-14

- Children engaging in adult activities, courts have applied adult standards.\
  *Dellwo v. Pearson*: 12-year-old driving a motor boat.

  - Court: While minors entitled to be judged based on standards commensurate with age, experience, and wisdom when engaging in activities appropriate, unfair to public to permit a minor in operation of motor vehicle to be judged by any standard of care other than that expected of all others.

  - Can't know whether the operator of an airplane is a minor or adult, and therefore can't prepare as such

2\. The Reasonable Person

***Bethel v. New York City Transit Authority*** (Court of Appeals NY 1998)

**[Facts]{.underline}**:

- Plaintiff hurt on defendant's bus when the wheelchair-accessible seat collapsed under him. Plaintiff couldn't prove that the defendant actually knew of the defect but relied on a theory of constructive notice -- computer printout repair record contained two notations that indicated that repairs were made to the "life wheelchair" seat 11 days prior and that a proper inspection should have revealed the defect

- Trial court charged jury that as a common carrier, bus company had a duty to use the highest degree of care

- On issue of constructive notice, jury instructions were "considering duty of care imposed on common carriers \[ie the highest\]," need to determine whether a reasonable inspection would have led to discovery of the defect

- Jury found for plaintiff, appellate division affirmed without addressing standard of care issue, \[court of appeals concluded instruction was dispositive\]

- 

**[Issue]{.underline}**: Should the duty of highest care continue to be applied, as a matter of law, to common carriers?

**[Holding]{.underline}**: No. Standard of care should be the traditional. Basic negligence standard of reasonable care under the circumstances. Under that standard, there is no stratification of degrees of care as a matter of law -- only 'different amounts of care as a matter of fact."

**[Reasoning]{.underline}**:

- Duty of common carriers to exercise the highest degree of care adopted at the advent of the age of steam railroads, and primitive safety features = explosion of personal injury and litigation

- However, tech advances, government regulation, now as safe as private modes of travel

- Inconsistent to have higher duty of care, byproduct of older system?

- Use objective, "reasonable person" standard like everywhere else -- sufficiently flexible by itself to permit courts and juries to take into account the ultra-hazardous nature of the activity

- **"Common carrier is subject to the same duty of care as any other potential tortfeasor -- reasonable care under all of the circumstances of the particular case"**

**C. The Roles of Judge and Jury**

1\. In General

***Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co. v. Goodman*** (SCOTUS 1927)

**[Facts]{.underline}**:

- Suit brought by the widow and administratix of decedent against the petitioner for causing his death by running him down at a "grade crossing"

- Defense = contributory negligence

- Defendant -- asked for directed verdict at trial, request refused, plaintiff won, judgment affirmed by Circuit Court

- Decedent driving truck, killed by train crossing the road at 60mph. He was going 5-6mph, plaintiff claims emergency

**[Issue]{.underline}**:

- Contributory negligence?

**[Holding]{.underline}**

- Yes

**[Reasoning]{.underline}**

- "Where a man goes upon a railroad track he knows that he goes to a place where he will be killed if train comes upon him before he is clear of the track"

- Plaintiff should have stopped, made sure train wasn't coming -- if he relies upon not hearing it, or takes no other precaution, does so at his own risk

- "Said that the question of due care very generally left to the jury, **but we are dealing with a standard of conduct, and when the standard is clear it should be laid down once and for all by the Courts**"

> **Note 2**: Holmes: Says that standard of care set by court, then up to the jury to decide whether or not it was met. However, Holmes says that if there is an activity in which, repeatedly, same thing happens (in this case grade crossing injuries), court will gain greater experience and can take more prominent role

***Pokora v. Wavash Railway*** (SCOTUS 1934)

**[Facts]{.underline}**

- Pokora driving his truck across tracks of railroad

- Boxcars cut off his view of on track

- Moved past, didn't hear bell or whistle, reached main track, struck by train at 25-30mph

- Train was 150 feet away

- Court of Appeals upheld verdict for defendant, following *Goodman*

**[Issue]{.underline}**

- Whether reasonable caution forbade going forward in reliance on hearing, unaided by sight (ie should he have got out and looked)

**[Holding]{.underline}**

- Cardozo distinguishes from *Goodman* like...somehow. On the facts

- "Standards of prudent conduct are declared at times by courts, but they are taken over from the facts of life"

- Basically says that shouldn't have to get out of car and look, although that was what Holmes said

- "Train may emerge out of obscurity as the driver turns his back to regain the waiting car, and may descend upon him suddenly when his car is on the track"

  - This is the stupidest thing I have ever read. Cardozo has never been near a train track

- "A train at a neighboring station, apparently at rest and harmless, may be transformed in a few seconds into an engine of destruction"

- **Illustrations such as these bear witness to the need for caution in framing standards of behavior that amount to rules of law**

- **Good man has been a source of confusion in the federal courts to the extent thatit imposes a standard for application by the judge and has had only wavering support in the courts of states, we limit it accordingly**

| Holmes and Cardozo are at the opposite sides of a railroad crossing dispute. Homes wants a rule: need to stop and look. Cardozo wants a standard, driver should approach with reasonable caution |
+==================================================================================================================================================================================================+

**Rules v. Standards v. Principles**

- [Rules]{.underline}: Once rule has been interpreted and facts found, application of rule to the facts determines the outcome of the decision

  - However, some rules more stringent that others -- "must be over 35 to be president" and "must be an adult to be president" are both rules, but one is more black and white than the other

- [Standards]{.underline}: Intermediate level of constraint, guide decisions but provide greater range of choice or discretion. Maybe a framework for balancing, for example

  - While rules define a triggering condition and a consequence, a standard may define relevant considerations and options instead

  - For example: *International Shoe* five factor balancing test

    - Defendant's interest, plaintiff's interest, interest of the forum, judicial efficiency and economy, and substantive policy considerations

    - A standard for presidency might require "sufficiently mature"

- [Principles]{.underline}: Rules and standards help resolve issues in a legal case, but principles only provide guidance for interpretation or application of a particular rule. Does not by itself resolve a particular legal issue

  - "One should not be allowed to profit from his or her wrongdoing" is a principle, but it doesn't tell you how to resolve a case in the same way

- Policy reasons for rules and standards

  - Predictability and certainty

    - Rules provide ex ante benefits: clear what the outcome is from particular conduct. Consistency leads to predictability, which creates deterrence benefits. In a more abstract sense, isn't it better that people are given fair warning of the consequences of their behavior?

  - Fairness and sensitivity

    - If the goal is ex post fairness, standards may be better. Standards permit flexibility and consideration of mitigating circumstances. Rules are a hammer, standards are a scalpel. Can't bake in all the exceptions into any given rule

  - Purpose of principles

    - Give legal form to concerns that cross a variety of fields

Schauer -- ***The Convergence of Rules and Standards***

- While we assume that rules and standards are different and distinction is important, institutions and individuals trusted with their interpretation generally collapse the two, distinction becomes grey, less important

- Frequently heard them is that the specificity of the directive is a valuable tool in allocating decision-making authority among the rule-maker, rule-interpreter, rule-enforcer, and rule-subject

- Specific rules allow the rule-maker to make many of the decisions, while vaguer rules permit the rule-maker to delegate decisions to the interpreter or enforcer

- What if the form of the directive is less important, less resistant? Ie, what if the directives, regardless of the form in which they are set, may be subject to modification in the hands of the individuals they were

  - Says that there isn't as much importance as we might think because of "convergence"

- Conventional wisdom is that rule-makers can actually make the choice between rules and standards

- Convergence hypothesis

  - Adaptive behavior of those who are given rules or standards. When authorized to act in accordance with rules, rules-subjects will tend to convert rules into standards by employing a battery of rule-avoiding devices that serve to soften the hard edges. Ability to employ or not employ those rule-avoiding devices gives rule-subjects precisely the discretion that it was the intention of the rule-maker to restrain

  - On the flip side, standards often harden because people don't want maximal freedom

- Argues that the US focuses more on getting the right outcome than following the rules

**Negligence and No Negligence as a Matter of Law: The Roles of Judge and Jury**

- Exploring ways that the law pours meaning into the concept of negligence, in order to assist jury in making the negligence determination

- Assumes that the jury ordinarily makes the determination, but this isn't always the case!

  - Class of cases in which the defendant is not liable for negligence: landowner's limited duty to trespassers, duty and no-duty questions

  - These are questions of **law** -- sometimes, legally no negligence, no question for jury to decide

- Even when defendant has a duty to exercise reasonable care to persons in the plaintiff's position, there are cases in which the court holds, as a matter of law, that the defendant did or did no breach that duty

- There is also a general rule about whether an issue is or is not a jury question

  - Issues are submitted for decision if "reasonable people could disagree" about the resolution of the issue

  - Issues are [not]{.underline} submitted to the jury if "reasonable people could not disagree" -- ie this would be decided at summary judgment or something

    - Applies to questions of fact and to mixed questions of fact and law, such as whether a party was negligent

- Question whether a particular issue poses a jury question is made at trial through rulings on motions for directed verdict or JML, or sometimes jury instructions

  - For example, if I'm driving blindfolded down the street and crash into someone and no one disputes that this happened, I'm negligent. This isn't getting submitted to a jury. No question on which reasonable people could disagree

  - However, if there's a genuine dispute as to whether or not I was blindfolded, THAT'S a jury question

  - Court would instruct that a jury would HAVE TO find that I was negligent if they found that I was blindfolded though

- This is functionally lawmaking by the courts about what constitutes negligence

  - When court rules on motion for a directed verdict on the negligence issue, the court isn't saying what a jury would do, but what a jury SHOULD do

  - Over time, these decisions are harmonized by appellate courts, and eventually there's a set of law, through court decisions (ie common law) that says XYZ is negligence or not

- Significance in decision to deny a motion for a directed verdict

  - In holding that reasonable people could disagree about the negligence issue, the court is implying that a decision for either party would be acceptable

  - Only precedent set by such a holding is that the facts pose a jury question, follows that if the same situation arose again, acceptable for a different jury to arrive at different outcome

- Holmes felt that this potential oscillating back and forth was unacceptable, so court should eventually say what the law is, assuming repeated set of facts coming up over and over

  - *Balitmore and Ohio RR v. Goodman* -- our car-hit-by-train case. Holmes, for the Supreme Court, says that DV should have been granted for the defendant because the plaintiff was negligent [as a matter of law]{.underline}

  - *Pokora v. Wabash Railway* -- presented with almost identical fact situation, Justice Cardozo overrules him, saying that doesn't follow that everyone who has not stopped, looked, listened, and gotten out of car is contributorily negligent. Depends on the circumstances

- Move from *Goodman* to *Pokora* reflects the treatment that Holmes' view has received generally -- not a tendency over time for multiple rules of law to develop regarding tort behavior and contributory negligence -- if anything, courts have given juries more leeway and tried to make fewer rulings

- Entire issue involves distinction between [rules and standards]{.underline}

- Rules

  - Rules are comparatively concrete and self-applying, while standards are more general norms

  - Rules facilitate predictability of outcome and are therefore more likely to lead to settlements

  - Rules treat cases alike

  - Rules have greater capacity to avoid dangers of discretion, like prejudice

  - In negligence cases, rules may circumvent the conundrum, of when inadvertence is negligent and when it is not

    - This is because a rule that a particular form of conduct is or is not negligent as a matter of law makes the reason the conduct occurred immaterial -- negligent per se

- Standards

  - Greater flexibility!

  - More room for nuanced distinctions between and among fact situations

  - More conducive to doing "justice"

- We've evolved towards standards, not rules. Why?

  - Fact situations that are sufficiently similar to warrant the development of rules of law governing them have not recurred

    - Courts have usually concluded, like Cardozo in *Pokora*, that reasonable people could consider the factual variations between cases such as *Goodman* and *Pokora* sufficiently important to permit juries to arrive at different outcomes

  - Less politically dangerous to pass things on to juries, and tort cases are decided at the state level, where most judges are elected

- However, sometimes things do recur over and over

  - We've...sort of arrived at a rules-y system with collateral estoppel and class actions, rather than rule of law

  - So there, a jury is deciding for a shitload of people all at once

  - These are procedural solutions, rather than legal ones

## **BPL**

**The Negligence Calculus**

- Negligence calculus affords a way of thinking about the circumstances under which a reasonable person would risk harm or would instead take steps to reduce that risk

- Major contribution of the calculus is that it breaks the behavior up into three different components

  - Probability that a particular act or omission will cause harm

  - Magnitude of that harm if it occurs

  - Value of the interest that must be foregone or sacrificed in order to reduce the risk of harm

A. The Learned Hand Formulation

- *United States v. Carroll Towing Co.* (2d Cir. 1947): first formulated by Judge Learned Hand. Question -- whether it was negligent not to have personnel at all times on a barge under tow?

- Function of three variables -- can be done algebraically

  - 1\) The probability that the barge will break away -- P

  - 2\) The gravity of the resulting injury if it does -- L

  - 3\) The burden of adequate precautions -- B

- So if P x L \> B, then better to have the precautions, or irrational not to, put another way

- Intuition is straightforward -- to determine whether taking a particular risky action is or is not reasonable, useful to compare the expected accident costs with the likelihood of them occurring and then seeing how much it would cost to avoid it

- This can be described as **cost benefit, or utility analysis**

- Section 3 of the Restatement (Third) of Torts talks about this, also discussed in appellate decisions

  - Could be helpful for JML (judgment as a matter of law) and directed verdict

- *Eckert v. Long Island RR*: plaintiff's decedent had saved a small child from near-certain death by sweeping the child off the tracks of a negligently-operated railroad, and rescuer was killed

  - At the trial defendant moved for a nonsuit -- ie, directed verdict -- on the grounds that it was negligent as a matter of law for the rescuer to have risked his life and that such contributory negligence by the plaintiff barred recovery

  - Court rejected: "the law has sigh high a regard for human life that it will not impute negligence to an effort to preserve it, unless made under such circumstances as to constitute rashness in the judgment of prudent persons"

  - But court then went on to say that if the rescuer had attempted to merely protect property, the result would have been different

- Basically, this is all intuitive stuff at some level -- like, you're just saying "ok it was not very likely that this would occur but so extraordinarily dangerous that worth taking the precaution anyway"

- In another sense though, negligence calculus is subject to criticism

  - First, negligence calculus takes a unitary concept (reasonably prudent conduct) based on a simple prototype (reasonably prudent person) and turns it into something that is both complicated and sometimes unrealistic

    - Reasonableness is a norm, not a decision calculus but a way of behaving

      - *Eckert* -- if we were balancing lives, plaintiff's decedent might have been negligent. Like who knows if he could have rescued the kid, but he certainly could have been killed

    - Doesn't really tell us if someone is being careless or not, or momentary lapses

      - Sometimes, maybe carelessness is the norm? We're not all rational actors

  - Second -- did the party engage in impartial deliberation about the possible course of action?

    - Notwithstanding the objective standard, some people might consider the fact that the defendant tried in good faith to reach the right decision to be relevant to the question of whether the defendant behaved reasonably

    - Maybe made the wrong decision from the standpoint of the standard, but made the decision unselfishly

    - But maybe it's also callous?

### Moral or economic calculus

B. Is the Calculus a Moral or an Economic Theory of Negligence?

- One view of the negligence calculus is that it adopts a certain moral perspective of selfishness

- Requires that the interests of others, represented by expected accident costs -- the probability and gravity of the injury -- be given equal weight as the costs of prevention

  - At the core of this requirement is the norm of equal concern and respect for others that is the hallmark of at least certain conceptions of morality

  - On this view, the calculus provides a method of striking an appropriate balance

- On the other hand, some academics in "law and economics" have pressed the concept of negligence calculus in a very different direction, saying that Hand was articulating what amounts to an economic theory of negligence

  - Posner: argued in a famous article that the factors in the calculus are essentially economic.

    - Ie, a defendant who did the proper cost-benefit analysis and determined that would be wasteful to implement a safety procedure isn't negligent, but a rational actor

- Proponents see this not only as the best way of determining whether a party has been negligent, but also as a tool for deterring future accidents

- Critics who consider tort law from an ex post perspective, though, would say it's really ignoring justice entirely

  - Ignoring remedying a past wrong

  - Also, is the fact that it costs more to prevent something like...a justification for having a faulty train engine? OK, you saved money, but how does that answer the question of liability

- Also seems to reduce everything to money -- presumably the reasonably prudent person takes action to avoid those actions that are "worth" avoiding and not those that are not worth avoiding

  - The qhole questions is what we should then take into account, though

  - The implication -- that sometimes we will tolerate risking injury rather than requiring it be avoided -- is not an entirely comfortable one, and it is a fact about which many people are ambivalent

- Concerns with money approach

  - Not clear that economic efficiency is necessarily the preferred goal?

    - But it would be dumb to entirely avoid it, otherwise we'd drive around in tanks

    - How do we define "waste?"

    - Should at least consider the cost-effectiveness of safety precautions

  - To be operational, economic theory of negligence requires that we place a dollar value on human safety in order to decide how much it is worth paying to avoid injury

    - Seems wrong to value human safety in this way, but how else would we do it?

    - The whole thing of tort law is that we're fighting over money -- that's literally what tort law is about

    - We're determining damages, so money IS the question

  - Finally, notion that factors that would figure in the negligence calculus in many cases -- human safety, convenience, the value of jobs foregone, etc -- can all be reduced to a single currency of exchange and balanced against one another

    - More importantly, some of this stuff is kinda unquantifiable -- how helpful are the statistics

    - The probability of harm depends on the severity of the injury

    - Hand was envisioning, more or less loose efforts at quantification

- Worth considering that the parties involved in these suits are **explicitly** doing the calculations themselves

- Even if the law were to employ a non-economic approach, defendants will attempt to compare the monetary cost of risking liability with the cost of prevention

- So it has to be relevant at some level

## Untaken precautions

C. Simpler Calculus: the Untaken Precaution

- Sometimes said that a plaintiff is under no obligation to prove the particular safety measure that the defendant should have employed

  - Plaintiff need only prove that in acting as he did, the defendant did not behave with reasonable care

- In most cases though, plaintiff actually attempts to prove that there was a particular precaution that should have been taken, and therefore plaintiff would not have been harmed

- Sometimes it's obvious -- don't drive through the red light

- This implicates the possibility of requiring perfect compliance with the reasonableness standard

  - Although in theory the negligence standard could take the high cost of achieving consistently reasonable conduct into account, that doesn't necessarily occur

  - Law permits a jury to find that a driver who takes his eyes off the road one time out of 100 was negligent!

  - Most juries would say that it was

  - In such cases, the implication is the reasonable person never fails to behave responsibly

- Disputes over the viability over the untaken precaution are often at the core of the cases

- Such disputes often presuppose something like the negligence calculus, even when not explicit

  - Plaintiff says you should have done this

  - Defendant says that could not easily have been done, would have been insanely expensive, or wouldn't have worked anyway

- This is all in the shadow of the negligence calculus, but explicit argument might not be being made

**How is the Learned Hand formula used today?**

- Restatement of Torts has long recognized, including Restatement (Third), which basically writes it into the definition

  - A person acts negligently if the person does not exercise reasonable care under all the circumstances. Primary factors to consider in ascertaining whether the person's conduct lacks reasonable care are the **foreseeable likelihood that the person's conduct will result in harm, the foreseeable severity of any harm that may ensue, and the burden of precautions to eliminate or reduce the risk of harm.**

- Appeals courts

  - Michigan and Louisiana use it all the time, even *sua sponte*

  - Most courts will consider if the appeal is couched in cost-benefit terms or ignore it by disposing even of explicit cost benefit claims under the "reasonable person" standard

  - No one has rejected it as a matter of law entirely

- Is it really just common sense?

  - *Adams* (Cardozo, kid electrocutes himself): Chance of harm, though remote, may betoken negligence, if needless. Facility of protection may impose a duty to protect.

***[United States v. Carroll]{.underline}*** (2d Cir. 1947)

- Facts

  - Couple different parties involved, but lower court found no negligence on part of the bargee, who said he was on the boat and basically let it sink, although he wasn't

  - United States had flour

  - Two other parties joined together (see that Gilles)

- Reasoning / Rule

  - Learned Hand's famous formulation: Probability of Incident x Damages Resulting = Cost of Precautions

    - So where equal, indifferent. If greater, rational actor would take precautions. If less, rational not to

  - So in this case, Hand says that the likelihood that the barge would break and the damage it would do would vary, but the bargee must be able to go ashore at times

  - Custom should control when this happens

  - But Bargee wasn't there at all (trial court held), fabricated story evidence no excuse for absence

  - Very limited ruling -- doesn't want to make rule about barges. But says bargee was liable

- Note 3

  - *McCarty v. Pheasant Run* (7d Cir. 1987)

    - Plaintiff guest assaulted in her room at defendant's resort by an intruder who entered through the sliding glass door, which was not locked, although chain fastened

    - Plaintiff said negligence included that defendant should have made locked before renting, better lock, more guards

    - Plaintiff loses, moves for JNOV

      - Posner: Says that Hand formula kinda limited because parties don't give the information. Tough to come up with the numbers that go into it

      - Trial court affirms

  - *Moisan v. Loftus*

    - Hand: Statistics rarely available =, tough to quantify, etc

  - How significant is it that this *Moisan* case involves personal injury?

- Note 5

  - Recall concern with notice and foreseeability in *Adams v. Bullock*

  - *Carroll Towing* doesn't quantify any of his variables in the opinion, but when these factors are considered, they are understood to be limited to foreseeable probability and severity

  - So it's kinda the same thing?

## **Negligence per se**

**VI. Violation of Statutes**

- We live in an age of statutes, so many acts alleged to be "negligent" also violate statutes

- Federal statutes sometimes held to preempt the imposition of state tort liability, either expressly or by strong implication

  - Most preemption cases involve products liability

- Conversely, from time to time, statutes create civil liability for their violation, expressly or by implication

  - Most statutes, however, don't actually say anything about how their violation would be treated in a tort action

| - All states hold that evidence of compliance with a statute is admissible, **[but not dispositive. Reasonable care may require more than mere compliance with a statute]{.underline}**       |
+===============================================================================================================================================================================================+

- Majority negligence per se rule enunciated by Judge Cardozo in the famous *Martin v. Herzog* case, so there's no actual statutory basis for it -- common law creation

  - Some argue that because the legislature frequently does not specify a cause of action in statutes (only criminal penalties for violation, if included), and because the legislation knows how to include a cause of action for statutory violation of the laws, absence of such provision should be taken as an expression of legislative intent that there is no cause of action

    - This is probably wrong

  - More accurate: negligence per se rule is a common law creation, based on the notion that reasonable people do not violate statutes

    - **In an ordinary case therefore, negligence is a matter of law, not fact -- unexcused violation of a statute is negligence**

    - Some jurisdictions also include administrative decisions and municipal ordinances, though often only considered evidence

  - Since sometimes violation of a statute can be excused, technically there is only presumption that the violation of a statute is negligence per se

    - Absence of excuse = negligence as a matter of law, jury required to rule that

  - Minority of states, virtually all excuses are acceptable

### Excuses

A. Legally Cognizable Excuses

- Under the negligence per se rule, a lot turns on what can and cannot be "excused"

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Traditional Excuses to Avoid Negligence Per Se**                                          |
|                                                                                             |
| - Necessity                                                                                 |
|                                                                                             |
| - Incapacity                                                                                |
|                                                                                             |
| - Emergency                                                                                 |
|                                                                                             |
| Some color...                                                                               |
|                                                                                             |
| - Children (if deemed incapable)                                                            |
|                                                                                             |
| - Reasonable efforts of compliance (sometimes)                                              |
|                                                                                             |
| - No reasonable opportunity to know of factual circumstances that make a statute applicable |
+=============================================================================================+

- Sometimes noncompliance may be safer

  - *Tedla v. Ellman*: plaintiff struck by car while walking with her back to the traffic on her side of a road instead of walking with her back to face traffic, as statutorily required

    - Court agrees that because traffic on the other side was much heavier, excuse of emergency deemed reasonable (one could also argue it's necessity though)

- **Categories allow judges to rule out putative excuses as a matter of law**

  - For example, if I say that I was speeding because I couldn't be late to school, that's not a legally cognizable defense -- it won't make it to the jury

### The Defense of Limited Statutory Purpose

- **Another defense -- defendant can show that the plaintiff wasn't in the class of persons that the statute was intended to protect**

  - Statute says that have to put up fences to keep livestock off of a train track

    - My son is hit by a train -- court would reject argument that the defendant is negligent per se; the statute about the fences was to keep livestock off, not children

<!-- -->

- **However, rarely succeeds in practice -- modern courts are likely to hold that there was at least a secondary purpose to the statute that would make the plaintiff protected**

  - Statutes usually do not have extremely obvious purpose

  - Purpose is a matter of *judicial construction and judgment*

  - Example: many states have laws that prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages to people who appear to be inebriated

    - A seems drunk, served anyway by waiter B; A gets in his car to drive home drunk, hits C. C sues A and B

    - B could argue that C isn't of the class protected by the statute; actually it's A that the state is trying to protect. But courts have rejected this construction

  - Example: states have laws prohibiting leaving vehicles parked with keys in the ignition

    - Thief steals a vehicle with key in ignition, negligent driving injures a plaintiff, who sues the thief as well as the owner of the vehicle

    - Defense of limited statutory purpose does not protect the custodian of the vehicle

- Two ways of trying to determine how a court would rule on a limited statutory purpose defense

  - See whether there is any legislative history or preamble to the statute in question

    - If any reference at all to someone in the plaintiff's position, courts likely to find for him

    - Absence isn't determinative however

  - Violation of statute does not increase the risk of harm to those in the plaintiff's situation, courts unlikely to hold plaintiff intended beneficiary

    - Weird example in the book about a lightning strike while person speeding? Speeding is negligent per se, but it didn't make getting hit by lightning any more likely

    - This gets into proximate cause too, which we'll touch later

***[Martin v. Herzog]{.underline}*** (NY COA, 1920) Cardozo

**[Facts]{.underline}**

- Plaintiff and husband driving to Tarrytown in a buggy. Struck by defendant's car coming in opposite direction. Man was killed

- Car was rounding a curve when buggy popped out of nowhere

- Negligence charge against DF: car driver was driving in the center of the road (statutory)

- Negligence charge against PL: didn't have lights on the buggy (statutory)

  - Says that there wasn't anything wrong with the car, wasn't going too fast

- Jury said DF to blame, victim blameless, appeals reversed and ordered a new trial

**[Issue]{.underline}**

- Whether plaintiff driving in the center of the road in violation of highway law was negligent

**[Holding]{.underline}**

- Jury instructions were erroneous -- violation of statute is negligence per se lacking an excuse when violation causally related to the injury

**[Reasoning]{.underline}**

- Appellate division was correct that the instructions were misleading

  - Case tried under assumption that the lights were necessary

  - Trial judge said that jury could consider the absence of light when deciding on contributory negligence, but not dispositive

  - Defendant argues that absence of light prima facie evidence of contributory negligence, but this wasn't included in the instructions ie was refused

- **However, the unexcused omission of the lights is more than some evidence of negligence; it is negligence in itself**

  - To willfully ignore the safeguards of the law is to fall short of the standard of diligence to which those who live in organized society are expected to conform

- Whether breach of statute unavoidable not being considered

  - Sets up the "legally cognizable excuses"

  - Sometimes breach and negligence may be separate, but here they're not

- In the present case, have an admitted violation of statute intended to protect, but jurors instructed that can ignore it

- Cardozo: jruies have no dispensing power by which they may relax the duty that one traveler on the highway owes under statute to another

  - It is error to tell them otherwise

- **Violation of the statute was a wrong, and being wholly unexcused was also a negligent wrong**

- \[Judge Cardozo then concludes that the lights were causally related to the accident\]

- **"A statute designed for the protect**

- **tion of human life is not to be brushed aside as a form of words, its commands reduced to the level of cautions, and the duty to obey attenuated into an option to conform"**

> ***[Tedla v. Ellman]{.underline}*** (NY 1939)
>
> **[Facts]{.underline}**

- Two junk collectors walking along highway connecting NYC and Long Island

- NO sidewalks, could not use grass because they had junk in baby carriages

- Statute: pedestrians need to keep left of the center line, turn to their left instead of right side to permit vehicles passing them in either direction to pass on the right

- Heavy traffic, plaintiffs hit by car, lower court finds for plaintiffs, now appealed, with defendant arguing contributory negligence

**[Issue]{.underline}**

- Whether the plaintiff was contributorily negligent

**[Holding]{.underline}**

- No. Although plaintiff was in violation of statute, court says that he/she was not negligent per se because necessity dictated violating it -- dangerous to follow the law given the flow of traffic

  - Should consider legislative intent -- some statutes dictate standard of care which must always be followed

  - Others are general rules of conduct

**[Reasoning]{.underline}**

- Plaintiff leans on *Martin v. Herzog*, but court says the analogy is incomplete

- Long paragraph about how important to follow what the legislature says once law passed

  - Sometimes legislature will, anticipating that the "indefinite and flexible standard of care," pass legislation dictating care which much be exercised

  - Then it must be followed (implication negligent per se)

- However, court says that this statute is different, as "it does not provide additional safeguards which pedestrians must provide for the preservation of life or limb or property of others, or even of themselves"

- Statute rather gives rules of the road to be observed by pedestrians and vehicles

- "Strict observance may defeat the purpose of this rule and produce catastrophic results"

- Negligence is the failure to exercise the care required by law

  - Where a statute defines a standard of care and the safeguards required, no other measure may be applied in determining whether a person has carried out the duty

  - Failure to observe is negligent as a matter of law

- But where a statutory general rule of conduct fixes no definite standard of care, but just codifies or supplements common law rule; regulates conflicting rights and obligations in a manner calculated to promote public convenience or safety...

  - **Then should not be construed as to wipe out the limitations and exceptions which judicial decisions have attached duty**

  - **Also doesn't require that the rules must be followed when observance would cause accidents**

- **Can assume that legislature wanted pedestrians to do something here, but can't assume that it intended the statute to be observed when dangerous**

  - But need good reason

- **\[So basically have the emergency and necessity excuses established\]**

**[Note 6]{.underline}**

- **[Statutory purpose]{.underline}**

  - Courts have long been unwilling to use statutory violations in cases in which the harm that occurred was different from the harm that the legislature was seeking to prevent

  - *Gorris v. Scott*: Requires that pens be put up on ship per the Contagious Disease Act, presumably to prevent disease from spreading?

    - Wasn't done, sheep wash overboard, plaintiff argues negligence per se because there weren't any pens to prevent the sheep from being washed up

    - Court says no, **"the damage is of such a nature as was not contemplated at all by the statute, and as to which it was not intended to confer any benefit on the plaintiffs"**

**[Note 10]{.underline}**

- **[Licensing]{.underline}**

  - Licenses are generally not used to set standards of care

    - Explanation has been that the purpose of such a statute is to protect the public from actions performed by unskilled persons

    - **Plaintiff must prove that the defendant lacked the required skill -- in effect proving negligence**

  - Most common one -- motor vehicle accident, unlicensed driver

    - Lack of license is irrelevant to the tort claim -- whether the driver or defendant is unlicensed

  - *Brown v. Shyne* (N.Y. 1926): Chiropractor allegedly hurt the plaintiff by undertaking a treatment that only licensed physicians could perform

    - Court held the defendant to the standard of care of a physician but instructed that jury would not be told about the violation of the licensing statute

    - This was later changed by statute in New York

- **Should this be the case? Distinction between person who accidentally let license expire and person who never took a driving test?**

***[Sheeley v. Memorial Hospital]{.underline}*** (RI 1998)

**[Facts]{.underline}**

- Plaintiff gave birth, doctor performed an episiotomy, which involves cutting into the mother's (something) to facilitate the birth and then stitching the incision after the birth

- Patient developed complications, sued

- Appellate court DV against plaintiff, appealing to RI Supreme Court

- Argument: trial court erred in excluding the testimony of her expert witness, which resulted in a DV

- At trial, PL wanted to bring in expert witness, Dr. Leslie, a board-certified OB/GYN, who planned to testify about defendant's alleged malpractice and the applicable standard of care in medicine as it relates to episiotomy

- DF filed motion of limine, argued that OB/GYN not qualified under \[statute\] to testify against a family practice resident who was performing OB/GYN stuff

  - Guy seems to have a number of qualifications, professor, board certified, continuing education, etc

  - Retired in 1975, but apparently kept up

- Trial court said under *Soares v. Vestal* that testifying expert must be in the same medical field (in that court, had someone certified in neurology and internal medicine testifying regarding family medicine administering emergency medication)

- Trial court granted defendant's motion in limine

- Two-day period to get another expert, no others prepared, so couldn't get one and DV granted

**[Issue]{.underline}**

- Whether motion of limine, which excluded expert witness testimony because the expert, under *Soares*, did not practice in same type of medicine

**[Holding]{.underline}**

- Reversed. Trial court erred in excluding the expert testimony, reverse the judgment, send back for retrial

- Locality rule, or "same or similar" communities requirement dropped, in addition to requirement that be practitioner in same area. National rule, any doctor with knowledge, education, experience, etc

**[Reasoning]{.underline}**

- In medical malpractice cases, expert testimony is an essential requirement in proving the standard of care applicable to the defendant, "unless the lack of care is so obvious as to e be within the layman's common knowledge"

- Determination of the competency of an expert witness is within the discretion of the trial justice

  - Court will not disturb that decision in the absence of clear error or abuse (presumably *Soares*)

- Other decisions have distinguished *Soares*, limited its holding to situations in which the physician lacks knowledge, skill, etc

- Holds that it's clear that there was abuse of discretion and error in excluding the testimony of the expert witness

- *Buja* (case distinguishing *Soares*): PL brings medical malpractice suit after child suffers mental retardation, cerebral palsy after being deprived of oxygen just prior to birth

  - Wanted to introduce evidence, ie expert testimony, by a board certified obstetrician

  - Trial court said that testimony concerning the applicable standard of care required of a family practitioner practicing obstetrics had to be introduced by an expert in family medicine, not obstetrics

  - Appellate court reversed, saying that the expert may not practice in the same specialty, he clearly had the prerequisite knowledge, etc in the field

  - Nothing in this statute requires that they practice in the same area

- DF's say that's not all, still not qualified to testify -- Dr. Leslie is actually overqualified, because the board certified guy who knows all this stuff doesn't have the same training as a second-year family practice resident performing OB/GYN stuff

  - Additionally, because he hasn't practiced medicine since 1975, experience is outdated and not competent

- "Locality rule" -- Dr. Leslie doesn't know enough about obstetrics in Rhode Island being practiced by a family practice resident

  - This is getting so absurdly specific

  - Not qualified to testify on the local standard of care, ie national experience is irrelevant

- **Revisiting the position on the standard of care and the locality rule**

  - For over 75 years, position in RI has been "that *when a physician undertakes to treat or diagnose a patient, he or she is under a duty to exercise 'the same degree of diligence and skill which is commonly possessed by other members of the profession who are engaged in the same type of practice in similar localities having due regard for the state of scientific knowledge at the time of treatment*"

    - "Same or similar" locality rule a variation on the "strict locality rule" which requires that the expert testifying be from the same community

    - Rationale was that there was difference between urban and rural communities? Practice of medicine may be of a different quality?

  - Restrictive rule was attacked

    - Seems to justify low standard of care in rural communities

    - "Conspiracy of silence" by doctors in that community not to testify against one another

    - Anachronism -- modern systems of transportation let people travel to get different care

    - This led to the "same or similar" locality rule

    - Medical malpractice bar has still urged a narrow application of the rule

  - **The appropriate standard of care to be utilized in any given procedure should not be compartmentalized by a physician's area of professional specialization or certification. Rather the focus should be the procedure performed and the question of whether it was executed in conformity with the recognized standard of care, the primary concern being whether the treatment was done in a reasonable manner**

    - Any doctor with knowledge of or familiarity with the procedure, acquired through experience, observation, association, or education, is competent to testify concerning the requisite standard of care and whether the care in any given case deviated from it

    - Issues should be considered including experience of the expert, practice, resources available -- but no one issue should be determinative

    - Witness that has board certification, except in extreme cases, in the area in question should be presumptively qualified to testify

  - **Whatever geographical impediments may previously have justified the need for "similar locality" are no longer applicable**

    - Legislature also didn't refer to "locality"

  - **We join a growing number of jurisdictions that have repudiated the "same or similar" communities test in favor of a national standard**

  - Hold that physician is under duty to use the degree of care and skill that is expected of a reasonably competent practitioner in the same class to which he or she belongs, acting in the same or similar circumstances

**[Note 4 -- Schools]{.underline}**

- *Gala v. Hamilton* (Pa. 1998): defendants used local anesthetic while working on a patient's neck tumor. Plaintiff alleged general should have been used

- **"Where there are two schools of thought in X, physician may rightfully choose to practice under either"**

  - Jury instruction is that as a matter of [law]{.underline}, if defendant followed a procedure recognized by reputable, respected, etc number of medical experts, defendant is NOT in violation of the standard of care and [must]{.underline} find for defendant on the issue

- "School" doesn't even have to be described ever in medical materials -- pretty generous

**[Note 6 -- Silence]{.underline}**

- *Sheeley* allusion to conspiracy of silence -- can be difficult to find doctors willing to testify against one another. In *Sheeley*, same court confronted issue where all three pediatric surgeons were associated in the same office

- Courts have allowed plaintiffs to read treatises, call defendant physician, etc

**[Note 7 -- Common knowledge]{.underline}**

- *Sheeley* court refers to situations "within the layman's common knowledge." AS that suggests, on such occasions plaintiffs in malpractice don't need experts

  - For example, say an instrument was left in the plaintiff's abdomen -- do we need an expert to say this is malpractice?

  - Or the doctor operated on the wrong leg?

- In "common knowledge" instances, jury doesn't have to, legally, accept expert testimony that says it's common practice

## **Custom** 

- The rule governing "custom" is well-developed and reasonably clear

  - Evidence of non-compliance with "custom" may be used offensively to show negligence

  - Evidence of compliance with custom may be used defensively, to prove reasonable care

- Evidence is relevant and admissible, but it is not dispositive

- Whether a particular practice is widespread enough to constitute custom may itself be a question

  - Practice need not be universal to constitute a custom, although it must be more than just one of a number of different practices

  - To be a custom, must be something done by most of those whose behavior is relevant to the issue

- If qualifies, party on whose behalf the evidence is being submitted is entitled to an instruction expressly permitting the jury to consider the fact that there was compliance or non-compliance with that custom

- But even if a practice doesn't qualify as a custom, may still be considered anyway

  - Plaintiff can always point out that a precaution could have been taken and that it was common for others to do it

  - Even if not admissible for negligence, can be used to show whether or not a precaution was realistic

- Failing to prove something is a custom will not preclude the party from proving some of what he or she wishes, although probably preclude showing how many others take it

- So why have this rule at all?

A. The History Behind the Custom Rule

- Previously, two theories surrounding custom

  - 1\. Rule that compliance with custom was actually a safe-harbor -- ie, once you've proved it, no negligence as a matter of law

  - 2\. Compliance with custom was irrelevant and evidence inadmissible

- Custom rule today comes from Judge Learned Hand, another tug boat case

  - *The TJ Hooper*: Defendant operated a tug boat, towed barges that were lost in a storm. Plaintiff alleged negligence, saying should have supplied radios. Court held that while it wasn't the custom for the tug owners to supply radios, it was still negligent on the part of the owner not to do so

    - "There are cautions so imperative that even their universal disregard will not excuse their omission"

    - Held that failure to have radios was negligence [as a matter of law]{.underline} but that generally this would be a jury question

- So the modern, seemingly weak rule, strikes the middle ground between *per se* safe-harbor and inadmissibility

> B. The Rationales for the Rule

- Number of arguments for including custom

  - 1\) Normative force -- "Definitionally, 'reasonableness' is what everyone else in my position does, and I did that"

    - Based on experience and authority that comes from a widespread way of doing things, custom may be probative of what constitutes reasonable care

    - Holding someone liable for doing what everyone else does seems unfair

    - That said, want to demonstrate that the custom is actually justified on the merits, rather than just asserted based on authority

      - Proper cost-benefit analysis, etc

  - 2\) Admitting evidence of compliance with custom cautions the jury that if it finds that an actor was negligent despite compliance with the custom, the jury is holding [everyone]{.underline} in that industry negligent

    - Inverse: if defendant wasn't in compliance with the industry standard, he's an outsider and that seems unreasonable

  - 3\) Evidence of compliance with custom is some evidence of the lack of an opportunity to learn of other precautions

    - Demonstrates a party's opportunity to learn what is feasible and normal as well

  - 4\) In certain instances custom = coordinating function

    - Victims are aware of the custom, what is typical

    - Non-compliance may show negligence if the plaintiff can also show that the defendant knew that the victims were relying on adherence to the custom

    - Compliance shows that took the precautions that victims should anticipate, so it's reasonable and the plaintiff is the outlier

- One could argue that departure from custom is perhaps more probative than evidence of compliance

  - An entire industry may be negligent, but it would be rare for an entire industry to exercise more caution than what is reasonable

- So therefore, maybe privilege evidence of departure over evidence of compliance?

- However, sometimes not exercising less caution, but just different caution

  - Sub-conformity vs non-conformity

- Finally, legal system has an interest in promoting reliable and accurate decisions about whether conduct is or is not negligent

  - Trial with no evidence about how others engage in the same activity as the defendant would be curiously devoid of information that would be relevant for making a decision in almost any context

  - The first thing we do, usually, when trying to learn something is to figure out how everyone else does is

- In complex, technical industries, juries need more and more information and context to evaluate "reasonableness"

  - In the 19^th^-century, simple farming accident is easy

  - Car accidents are similar today

  - But say, determining whether someone was negligent in operating a semiconductor fab, need to know what other people would do

## Malpractice

- In contrast to the rules that govern ordinary negligence cases, different rules govern the conduct of professionals, including physicians, attorneys, and accountants

- Most of the action in the field revolves around medical malpractice, although the future in continuing growth of the American service economy may spawn suits in a variety of fields

- Medical malpractice litigation has grown exponentially in the last several decades

  - 1960: \$199 million for insurance against liability for medical malpractice

  - 2010: \$10 billion annually

- What's changed?

  - Legal rules permitting more suits

  - Increases in the cost of healthcare

  - Greater willingness of some people to bring suit against physicians (specialist = no longstanding relationship)

  - Increasing specialization and greater ability of plaintiff's attorneys

  - Medical advances (more "error")

A. The Special Standard of Care for Professionals

- In ordinary negligence litigation, failure to comply with custom is not automatically negligent, and complying is not an automatic reasonable care

- In contrast, for professionals, compliance is generally safe harbor, while failure to comply is malpractice

  - Minority of jurisdictions have a general reasonableness standard

- In medical malpractice, the relevant standard is the "custom"

  - Plaintiff needs to show evidence that behavior of the professional deviated from the norm

  - Defendant needs to prove that he complied with the professional standard

- "Two schools of thought" is acceptable in many jurisdictions

  - Even if really in the minority, still "custom" if can prove that a respectable minority of practitioners do it this way

- Why does medical malpractice (and professional standard of care more generally) differ from other custom rules?

  - 1\) Necessity

    - Subject of scrutiny is normally incredibly complex -- technical accounting methodologies, medical judgment, etc

    - What you're essentially asking a jury to do, in medical malpractice cases, is give their medical judgment, which they're really not qualified to do absent adherence to a professional standard of conduct

  - 2\) Deference/solicitude to professionals as a class, of which appellate judges are members

  - 3\) Not that different than ordinary cases?

    - Expert testimony generally doesn't point to a precise way that it should be done every time

    - Instead, both sides bring in expert witnesses, who testify about what they would have done

    - Often, this could be interpreted to trigger the "two schools" rule

    - Some courts though might say that the conflict is actually about what the majority standard really is, not argument for a different one

    - Juries may be giving less consideration to the "two schools" rule than they should though

  - One might argue that this is too lax a standard, but it cuts both ways

    - Failure to comply with custom = malpractice. It's dispositive

B. Demise of the "Locality" Rule

- Demise of the Locality Rule is another factor contributing to the rise of medical malpractice liability

- Rule operated in following way

  - Proof of the relevant medical standards almost always is provided in the form of expert testimony by physicians practicing in the defendant's specialty

  - Without such testimony, plaintiff could not survive motion for summary judgment, directed verdict, or a JML since the jury is rarely familiar with the rules on its own

    - So what question of law or fact would there be to send if can't provide alternative evidence of the relevant standard of care?

  - For years, plaintiffs would actually need a physician, practicing in the relevant area, from the defendant's own community

    - Strict locality said that you need a doctor from that [specific]{.underline} community, otherwise expert testimony inadmissible

  - Doctors were pretty reluctant to testify against one another

    - Result: "conspiracy of silence," as doctors wouldn't testify against one another

  - Given that plaintiffs could not secure an expert witness whose testimony would be admissible per the locality rule, and such a witness was a prerequisite for making a prima facie case, no point in even bringing the claim

- Maybe made sense at the time, as medical practices might have varied greatly from community to community, but as degree of variation declined and medical standards became increasingly uniform, justification for the strict locality rule diminished

  - Just placing an artificial obstacle in the way of plaintiffs

- Law broke down -- some courts held that although the standard to be applied in assessing the defendant's conduct was that of the locality in which she practiced, physicians from other localities who knew about it could testify

  - Other courts went further, holding that strict locality rule was too restrictive, appropriate test to measure the defendant's conduct was the standard of practice in the same locality or "similar" localities

    - Basically a national standard

  - Finally, many courts today have gone all the way in rejecting any form of locality rule, holding that national standards govern

- Result: much more free-wheeling litigation, in which some physicians have become professional witnesses, spending most or even all of their time as experts in litigation rather than practicing medicine

  - Number of states have enacting rules limiting potential witnesses to those who still practice or have other qualifications like board certification

  - Some have come full circle, worried about malpractice litigation becoming excessive

- Data suggest that only a small number of suits are completely groundless, other criticism can be made

  - System doesn't seem very good at sorting out the deserving from the undeserving claimants -- many who were genuinely hurt can't sue, many who win don't seem to have actually suffered any injury

**BP Oil Spill**

United States and BP disagreed over the meaning of **gross negligence**

- United States: Gross negligence, like ordinary negligence, requires only objective, not subjective proof. Gross negligence differs from ordinary negligence only in degree, not in kind

  - Ordinary negligence is a failure to exercise the degree of care that someone of ordinary prudence would have exercised in the same situation

  - Gross negligence is an extreme departure from the care required under the circumstances

- BP: Gross negligence has objective but also subjective elements

  - Gross negligence requires an extreme departure from the standard of ordinary care (objective element) but also a "culpable mental state" (subjective element) -- actual, subjective awareness of the risk involved, but nevertheless proceed with conscious indifference to the rights, safety, or welfare of others

Generally agree over the meaning of **willful misconduct**

- Requires a culpable mental state -- defendant knows that its conduct will naturally or probably cause injury

Recklessness helps frame it

- BP: Gross negligence and recklessness are synonyms, and willful misconduct includes reckless conduct as well, but extends to intentional misconduct. So reckless conduct falls in both

- United States: Reckless is a part of willful misconduct.

- Court: United States is better, given that "gross negligence or willful misconduct" seem like distinct things

- Restatement (Second) of Torts: The actor's conduct is in reckless disregard of the safety of another if he does an act or intentionally fails to do an act which it is his duty to the other to do, knowing or having reason to know of facts which would lead a reasonable man to realize, not only that his conduct creates an unreasonable risk of physical harm to another, but also that such risk is substantially greater than that which is necessary to make his conduct negligent.

  - Recklessness may consist of either of two different types of conduct.

    - One the actor knows, or has reason to know . . . of facts which create a high degree of risk of physical harm to another, and deliberately proceeds to act, or to fail to act, in conscious disregard of, or indifference to, that risk.

    - In the other the actor has such knowledge, or reason to know, of the facts, but does not realize or appreciate the high degree of risk involved, although a reasonable man in his position would do so.

  - For either type of conduct, to be reckless it must be unreasonable; but to

> be reckless, it must be something more than negligent. It must not only be unreasonable, but it must involve a risk of harm to others substantially in excess of that necessary to make the conduct negligent. It must involve an easily perceptible danger of death or substantial physical harm, and the probability that it will so result must be substantially greater than is required for ordinary negligence.

- 

Court goes through the statutes -- United States' definition has more support, but "gross negligence" is a somewhat nebulous term

- So gross negligence = doesn't require conscious intent

**Series of negligent acts may also constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct**

**CHAPTER 7: DEFENSES BASED ON PLAINTIFF'S CONDUCT**

- **Two defenses based on plaintiff's conduct**

  - **Contributory negligence**

  - **Comparative negligence**

- **Each is an "affirmative" defense, ie the defendant bears the burden of pleading and proving the facts necessary to support one of these defenses. Must prove plaintiff's burden was:**

  - **1) Negligent OR consisted of assumption of risk**

  - **2) Cause in fact of plaintiff's injury**

  - **3) Conduct was proximate cause of the injury**

  - **[Defendant has burden of proof in an affirmative defense]{.mark}**

- Basically, each side in this scenario is making a full tort claim against the other

  - Defendant just claiming plaintiff violated a duty to and caused harmed to himself

## **Contributory negligence** 

- Failure of plaintiff to exercise reasonable care to protect himself or his property from the risk of harm or loss

  - Comparative negligence exists in all but a few states

  - Full defense of contributory negligence is basically thing of the past

  - But, still reference point for modern reforms

- History: from inception of the doctrine until 1970, most states the contributory negligence defense was a complete bar to recovery

- Replaced with comparative negligence, under which the negligence does not bar recovery but reduces it

- Conduct that constitutes contributory negligence can also be [primary negligence]{.underline}

  - Ie, if I'm driving wildly, I'm risking harm to myself as well as others, and whether or not I'm injury or the other person is (or both) is basically a matter of chance

  - Whether plaintiff was negligent ought to consider whether plaintiff was negligent to his own safety, but ALSO whether or not he was violating safety of others

    - *Restatement (Third) of Torts* holds this view

    - Little case law on this though

- Contributory negligence can be sole risk to self -- like using a defective chainsaw

- Basic point of contributory negligence is that it would be unfair to hold the defendant liable when the plaintiff has caused his/her own injury

  - However, opposite is also true! Would be unfair to completely void defendant's liability if he/she contributed to plaintiff's injury simply because the plaintiff took insufficient caution to protect his/herself

  - In doctrine, defendant doesn't need to prove that the plaintiff is the [sole]{.underline} cause in fact or sole proximate cause of injury, or even the primary one

  - Deterrence can't explain: doesn't seem to have much power. Ie, why would I want to hurt myself?

  - Actually incentivizes defendant to be LESS careful, if anything

- Scholarship not completely clear on why it developed the way it did

  - Maybe courts wanted to reign in juries?

## **Comparative negligence**

- Comparative negligence has essentially replaced contributory negligence in the US -- all but four states have adopted (AL, MD, NC, VA, + DC)

- Was probably practiced under the table for a good while before, but now we hace formal rules, system of common law adjudication

A. The Basics

- Under comparative negligence, contributory negligence does not necessarily bar recovery

- Plaintiff's recovery instead reduced "in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable"

1\. Pure Versus Modified Comparative negligence

- Two forms

  - **Pure comparative negligence**

    - Plaintiff's negligence never complete bar

    - Applies regardless of how much more negligent plaintiff was

    - Minority rule: 13 states

  - **Modified comparative negligence**

    - If plaintiff is more negligent than defendant, does not allow recovery

    - If less negligent, reduced proportionately

    - So a small variation in the amount of negligence attributed can mean the difference between a substantial recovery or nothing at all

    - Most common ruling probably 50-50

      - Depending on language of statute, this can lead to 50% recovery or none

      - Juries are instructed about this ahead of time, so can sort of adjust the negligence such that they don't completely bar recovery if that's preference

      - 

    - Majority rule (33 states)

# **DUTY**

- Four elements of a cause of action in tort

  - Duty

  - Breach of duty

  - Damages

  - Causation

- Duty

  - Obligation to take some actin or to refrain from taking an action

  - Question of law: for the courts, not jury to decide

  - However, where duty exists, juries decide whether there has been a breach

  - Many cases this is unnecessary though: ordinary tort with foreseeable physical harm, obviously has duty to avoid injuring the plaintiff

- Where simple physical harm, asking whether there was a duty adds nothing, may actually distract from issue

- However, there are some classes in which existence or non-existence of a duty on part of the defendant to take or refrain from taking action is key

- Most frameworks: distinction between **affirmative and limited duties**

- **[Affirmative duty]{.underline}**

  - Question is whether plaintiff has a duty eliminate or reduce risk of harm to plaintiff that **was not negligently created by him/her**

  - Failure to do so is called **[nonfeasance]{.underline}**

  - Obviously have duty not to create this harm -- this is a separate issue though

- Tort law general rule is that there's no such thing as an affirmative duty, but there are exceptions

- Bulk of these affirmative duty cases about the **duty to rescue**

  - Rescue really implies an emergency, and that's not always the case

- Some also raise question of whether there's an affirmative duty to exercise **reasonable care** to protect plaintiff from the risk of physical harm, or reduce when there's no imminent emergency

- Arises in cases of

  - 1\) special relationship

  - 2\) activity creating risk of harm

  - 3\) undertaking by the defendant to supply services on which the plaintiff relies

- **[Limited duty]{.underline}**

  - Defendant commits **misfeasance** rather than nonfeasance by **foreseeably** **creating an unreasonable risk of harming the plaintiff**

    - So this is a classic tort

- However, law places **limits** on duty to exercise reasonable care

  - Premises liability: landowner maintaining his own property

  - Pure emotional harm

  - Pure economic harm

- These are cases in which as a matter of law, there is no liability or limited liability for negligently causing harm

  - In other words, **a limited duty**

- No general formula to use in predicting whether courts will hold whether there is an affirmative duty, limits on the duty, or no duty

+==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================+

## **Rescue**

- In the absence of special circumstances, **there is no affirmative duty at common law to rescue another person from danger, either by action or by warning, regardless of how minimal the cost is to the defendant**

- **Key distinction: whether or not the defendant created the risk of harm**

  - [If created the risk of harm: misfeasance]{.underline}, tort law classically willing to impose liability, whether through act or omission

  - But if not, just failed to remove risk of harm created by someone or something else, nonfeasance

- Principle

  - Common law cares enough about individual liberty that it does not ask people to do more than mind their own business, not create harms for others

- Policy issues with "duty to rescue"

  - Who should be liable if more than one person in position to rescue?

  - Slipper slope of permitting liability for the failure to rescue that would be imposed under a reasonable behavior under-all-the-circumstances

- Key: at common law, once undertaking a rescue, have duty not to do so negligently! Have waived right to not be held liable

- *Montgomery v. National Convey & Trucking Company*: Defendant's truck stalls on an icy highway, behind a hill, so not visible to others coming over it

  - Plaintiff crashes into truck, couldn't see until it was too late

  - Court holds trucker liable for injury resulting from failure to warn others of the danger

  - Why? Could distinguish this as **defendants created liability in the first place**

  - However, defendants didn't do so negligently: court wasn't holding that reasonable person wouldn't have stalled, but that reasonable person would have warned? Seems odd

- Number of cases like Montgomery though

  - Suggests willingness of courts to impose a duty to rescue when they can find what they believe to be a "principled" basis for doing so

  - One such principle: duty to rescue when one's activity non-negligently creates a risk characteristic of the activity

  - Once you engage in an activity that substantially raises the level of risk to which others are subjected, even if non-negligently, arguably no longer "minding my own business" in the sense that the no-duty rule contemplates

**Maryland**

- Court says that no statute mandates contributory negligence, but public policy favors keeping it

- Maryland legislature had considered abolishing contributory negligence and shifting to comparative standard ten different times in recent years but none of the bill passed

  - Should give deference to that choice to no go forward

  - Institutional competence argument

- Dissent says that "it's a dinosaur"

- Favors defendant on early motion grounds as well -- summary judgment follows trial standard via *Liberty Lobby* or something

> **BP**

- Allocates negligence 67/30/3 to BP/Transocean/Halliburton

- Standard for stating a claim is that plaintiff must demonstrate

  - 1\) Duty owed by plaintiff to defendant

  - 2\) Breach of that duty

  - 3\) Injury sustained by the plaintiff

  - 4\) Causal connection between defendant's conduct and plaintiff's injury

    - **[This is key]{.underline}**

## **Law and Moral Intuitions: Duty to rescue?**

- Law can influence our intuitions about the most basic trolley dilemma, and content of the law influences even when it's not enforced

- Why? Maybe it's a tie-breaker in morally difficult circumstances? Maybe we look to the law as a source of moral guidance? Do we see following the law as a morally good thing to do itself? Is it an indicator of social proof, that other people agree with you? Does being informed about different legal regimes amplify different mental processes?

**Sources of Affirmative Duty**

- ***[Cuyler v. U.S.]{.underline}*** (7th Cir. 1994) (Posner)

  - **Facts:** Higgs babysat for Norman, a Navy enlisted man stationed near Chicago. She abused Norman's son, which resulted in injuries to the 14-month-old sufficient to require hospitalization at the Naval Hospital, a federal facility, subject to the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act (ANCRA, Illinois state law)

    - Higgs said that the child's injuries had been caused by him falling down the steps -- medical personnel ask Norman if the child was abused, but he said he didn't know. They asked whether he wanted them to report abuse, and he said they should do their job.

    - Act [requires]{.underline} that medical personnel report abuse if reasonable cause to believe it in their official capacity

    - Twenty-eight days later, Higgs babysat for another Navy family, the Cuylers; she abused that child as well, and the injuries were fatal

    - Higgs suing federal government, arguing that there is an implied right of action for damages under the statute, or if not, then because the statute is intended to protect children, this is prima facie evidence of negligence under the [common law]{.underline} of Illinois

  - **Issue**: Whether hospital's failure to report abuse under ANCRA creates prima facie evidence of negligence under Illinois common law

  - **Held:** No.

    - Under common law there is no duty to rescue, so without ANCRA Cuyler would not have a cause of action

    - However, the mere fact that the legislature can and sometimes does create a duty of care to a new class of injured persons, that does not in and of itself create a duty enforceable via tort law.

    - Negligence per se exists when the common law recognizes a cause of action, the standard of care may be that required by statute, rather than the reasonable person standard

    - Every statute specifying a standard of care does not create an implied private right of action

    - The legislature did not create a private right of action here, and while there has never been an Illinois case addressing the issue of whether ANCRA creates a private right of action, other jurisdictions with nearly identical statutes have ruled that there is no right of private action

    - **Policy reason why:** While creating such an action would lead to more reporting (probably), it could also lead (probably) false reporting. Moreover, general common law aversion to duty to rescue: line drawing problems, concern over establishing causation, etc

## **Special Relationships: Schools**

- Exception to the general rule that there is no duty of care or affirmative duty to rescue: special relationships

- When plaintiff and defendant are ina special relationship, like that of a common carrier, innkeeper (traditionally), a custodial relationship (babysitter, childcare professional), or familial one

  - By entering into this special relationship, which ordinarily involves dependence by the plaintiff on the dependent, the defendant has waived its right to mind its own business and has undertaken a duty to protect the plaintiff from harm

- Outer reaches are cases involving mental health professionals such as psychiatrists who have a duty to warn persons endangered by their patients after the patient has communicated intention to cause them harm

  - *Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of California* (Cal. 1976): Established duty to protect persons endangered by their patients; patient of the defendant murdered his ex-girlfriend, family sued the psychiatrist's employer and won

- ***[Munn v. The Hotchkiss School]{.underline}***: Plaintiff goes on school trip to China sponsored by The Hotchkiss School. Employee went on United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention website, saw that there was information about tick-borne encephalitis, failed to mention it to the students and their parents about the risks or ensuring that they took sufficient preventive measures. Plaintiff contracts disease, seemingly permanent damage results.

  - Second Circuit certifies question to the \[state court of Connecticut?\], which says that public policy of Connecticut does not preclude imposing duty to protect/warn/whatever students about insect-borne illnesses when traveling abroad

    - Schools generally obligated to exercise reasonable care to protect from foreseeable harm

## **Special Relationships: Tarasoff**

***[Tarasoff v. Regents of Univ. of Calif., pp. 150-155]{.underline}***

- **Facts:** Poddar kills Tarasoff after confiding intention to kill her to Moore, a psychologist employed by hospital at UC Berkeley. Moore told police to detain, briefly did so but released and superior directed no further action

  - Tarasoff not warned

  - Plaintiffs (decedent's parents) allege liability on two grounds: 1) defendant's failure to warn decedent of the danger and 2) failure to confine Poddar pursuant to \[some California state act\]

  - Argue that although police called, therapists failed to exercise care to protect decedent and apprise of danger

- **Issue:** Can therapist be held liable for death of decedent at hands of his patient, who had confided to him his intention to kill?

- **Holding:** Yes, "when a therapist determines, or pursuant to standards of his profession should determine, that his patient presents a serious danger of violence, incurs an obligation to use [reasonable care]{.underline} to protect intended victim"

  - Affirmative duties may include one or more steps: call victim, notify police, etc

  - **Defendants can state cause of action against defendant for "negligent failure to protect plaintiff"**

- **Reasoning**

  - Plaintiffs: Allegations of negligence and proximate causation, with resulting damages, establish a cause of action

  - Defendants: Owed no duty of care and in the absence of such duty, free to act in careless disregard of Tarasoff's life and safety

  - Liability should be imposed for "an injury occasioned to another by want of ordinary care or skill," per the California code.

  - "Whenever one person is by circumstances placed in such a position with regard to another, that if he did not use ordinary care and skill in his own conduct, he would cause danger of injury to the person or property of the other, a duty arises to use ordinary care and skill to avoid such danger"

  - Number of considerations to establishing duty

    - Foreseeability

    - Degree of certainty

    - Closeness of the connection

    - Moral blame

    - Policy of preventing future harm

    - Extent of the burden to the defendant and consequences to the community of imposing it

    - Availability, cost and prevalence of insurance for risk involved

  - Where avoidance of foreseeable harm requires a defendant to control conduct of another, common law traditionally only imposes such liability (or duty to warn) if there is a special relationship between dangerous person [or victim]{.underline}

    - There is a special relationship here

  - Admittedly, no common law duty to control as a general rule, nor to warn -- exception for special relationships

  - Normally duty of care only imposed on defendant for injury to third party where relationship exists between both the defendant and the victim, court says that there's no reason to limit it to that

  - **Defendant needs to exercise "that reasonable degree of skill, knowledge, and care ordinarily possessed and exercised by members of (that professional specialty) under similar circumstances"**

  - While patients have right to privacy, need to weigh against public interest though and here (apparently) outweighed

- Cal. Civil Code section 43.92 enacted post-*Tarasoff* to make therapists immune for failure to warn except when the patient has communicated to psychotherapist a serious threat of physical violence against reasonably identifiable victim or victims. If thre is a duty to warn, discharged by reasonable effort to communicate threat to the victim or victims and to a law enforcement agency

  - Reasonable care v. reasonable efforts? Standards of profession? So liken a custom thing?

## **Adequacy of Warning: Products Liability**

Intro

- Warnings can serve on or both of two functions: 1) providing instructions as to how to use a product safely, and 2) giving consumers information about the unavoidable risks posed by a product so that they can decide whether to take these risks

- Law regarding instructions is straightforward

  - Reasonable instructions must be provided

  - Complicated though: what about unavoidable risks

- Impossible to provide purchasers with complete information about risks and liabilities

- Some product designs are defective even after fully warned, so complete consumer choice can't completely displace mandatory product liability

- Warning law: occupies area in which it is both feasible and normatively desirable to transfer risk-utility information to the purchaser

  - Ie, where we want the purchaser to make the decision for himself as to whether it's "worth it"

  - Once this has been done, buyer is liable

- Example: duty to warn of users about pharmaceutical side effects

  - Aspirin, for example -- small number of users will develop ulcers after prolonged use; apparently nothing you can do about it

  - So aspirin warns you up front, and it's on you to decide whether or not you want to take anyway

  - **Aspirin maker discharges liability by warning**

1\. Adequacy of Warning

- If we could transfer complete risk-utility information, easy to determine whether the warning or instructions were sufficient to insulate the manufacturer or seller from liability

  - This isn't possible obviously

- So what's required is an "adequate warning" or instruction, typically of foreseeable risks

  - Warning liability isn't "strict" liability, since adequacy determinations inevitably take into account feasibility and cost of providing a warning, as well as the kind of info need

- Problem 1: Diminishing Returns from Additional Information

  - More warnings are given, the less likely an individual is to heed any individual one -- harder to digest, seems so remote

  - "Label clutter"

  - But adequacy issue is normally left to jury to decide, so low-probability outcome may occur and jury will decide should have had it anyway, or that wasn't specific enough

    - Example: *MacDonald v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp.*, jury finds that while birth control manufacturer had included on label information about risk of stroke, insufficient because didn't use the word stroke

  - This is problematic but not really clear what the alternative is

- Problem 2: Causation

  - Must prove that plaintiff would not have used the product, or would not have used it in the way that it was used, had the alternative warning been given

  - Drugs always an issue: how can you provide evidence that the patient would / wouldn't have taken it with the other label. Defendant has duty to discharge

  - **Courts have presumption that the plaintiff would have heeded an adequate drug warning had it been given**

    - This is questionable logic at some level: seems pretty unlikely that someone would have decided not to take a drug that their doctor recommended simply because of an additional warning label

      - 1\) Courts concerned that without heeding presumption, few if any plaintiffs will be able to prove their case

      - 2\) Functions as insurance for the small number of people who may suffer this side effect

2\. The Warning / Design Defect Connection

- Risk posed by some products outweigh utility when there is no warning or instructions, but are outweighed by utility when they have warning or instructions

  - No dispute that in cases there is a duty to warn, and if that duty is satisfied there is no liability for a risk that is the subject of adequate warning

- But what if product could have been designed better? What if could have reduced risks, but decided not to?

- **Patent danger rule: Used to prevail in many states. Adequate warning was always sufficient, since it provided that when the defects in the design were obvious, manufacturer could not be held for liable injuries that resulted**

  - Overruled in many jurisdictions

  - Sometimes product is just too risky, regardless of the warning *O'Brien v. Muskin Corp.*

    - Above ground swimming pool 3.5 feet deep

    - Can instruct jury that allowed to find liability simply because of defective design

  - Inherent tension

Casebook 608-609

- Words may reduce risk by instructing user sin how to obtain the benefits from the product's intended use and in the care required for safe use

- Threshold issue: common knowledge and duty to warn

  - **If the ordinary consumer already knows about the risk in question, manufacturer has no duty to warn**

    - Ie, *Brown Forman Corp. v. Brune*, no warning label required to warn against drinking a large amount of tequila in a short period of time

    - *Maneely v. General Motors Corp.*: no duty to warn on truck about dangers of riding without a seatbelt in the cargo bed of a pickup truck

<!-- -->

- Design defect relevant: design in *Maneely*, court rules benefits of the design outweighed the dangers as to matters of use

  - Redesigning a pickup to provide protective seats and occupant packaging would destroy utility of actually having a pickup bed

- *Emery v,. Federated Foods*: 2.5 YO choked on marshmallows, court holds jury should decide whether it was common knowledge that young children were in danger in eating marshmallows because they expand when they are soaked in liquid secretions

  - Aspirated marshmallow fragment might not be reachable with finger

***[Hood v. Ryobi]{.underline}*** (4th Cir. 1999)

- **Facts:** Hood purchased a Ryobi TS-254 miter for purposes of home repair; saw fully assembled at time of purchase, had a 10 inch blade controlled by a finger trigger, had blade guards

  - Warnings in the owner's manual and affixed to the saw itself said operate only with blade guards in place

  - Dude removes the blade guards, works with it -- the blade flys off the saw and partially amputates left thumb and cuts up right leg

  - Guy says that he was unaware that removing the blade would permit it to detach from the saw itself, thought it was just to prevent clothing or fingers from coming in contact

  - Says that Ryobi was aware that this could happen; had happened before

  - District Court enters summary judgment

    - State law -- Maryland

- **Issue:** 1) Is Ryobi liable for failing to adequately warn of dangers of using saw without the guards; 2) liable for defective design?

- **Holding:** 1+2) No.

- **Reasoning**

  - 1\) Warnings were insufficiently specific?

    - Hood says that the warnings were inadequate because they didn't explain the actual consequences

    - Maryland does not require an encyclopedic warning; need only be one that is "reasonable under the circumstances"

    - Clear and specific fine -- doesn't need to warn of every potential mishap

    - "In deciding whether a warning is adequate, Maryland asks whether the benefits of a more detailed warning outweigh the costs of requiring the change

    - Hood says it's not a big change; court disagrees, says that label proliferation can undermine effectiveness

      - Ryobi's warnings are clear and unequivocal

    - Plaintiff can come up with only one case in 15 years w/facts similar to his case

      - Holds that warnings are adequate

- **Note: Design defect**

  - Adequate warning here must be "reasonable under the circumstances" -- is this different than the negligence standard?

    - Criteria: Must adequately indicate the scope of the danger, 2) warning must reasonably communicate the extent or seriousness, 3) physical aspects must be adequate, 4) simple directive can be inadequate when doesn't explain the consequences, 5) means to convey must be adequate

  - Why are these appropriate? How does *Hood* fit in?

- **Note: Information costs**

  - *Hood* suggests that proliferation of labels can increase cost of acquiring and retaining the information

  - Post-internet, is it reasonable to assume that supplying more and more information is actually helpful and better for the consumer?

  - Can defendants be liable for putting "too much info" on the label, diluting the message altogether/

## **Duty to Disclose and Informed Consent**

KA 93-96

- Most medical treatments involve risk

- Treatment may not succeed: pain, inconvenience, disturbance of normal bodily functions, etc

- Doctrine of informed consent requires the physician to inform the patient of the risks to that the patient may decide whether to undertake

  - Because most patients would want to weigh the side effects vs the benefits, physician must inform the patient of the benefits, including probability that it will or will not work

- To prevail on the claim, plaintiff doesn't need to show that there was malpractice: **informed consent is about inherent risk of proper medical treatment, not subpar**

  - **May prevail even if provided in accordance with standards if 1) treatment resulted in injury, AND 2) plaintiff would have decided not to consent if properly informed of risks**

- Difference between "informed" decision and "independent decision" though -- doctrine of informed consent attempts to secure the former, not the latter

  - Sometimes doctrines speak as if they are the same, that physician's disclosure of information transmits to the patient everything needed for the patient to make the treatment decision

  - Not realistic though -- patients frequently psychologically dependent on others, including physicians

  - Perhaps doctrine should take into account informing others, like family and friends to open an informed dialogue

- Two different standards for determining whether the requirements of the doctrine are satisfied

  - **Reasonable patient standard**: Requires the physician to disclose information about the risks and benefits of treatment that a reasonable patient in what the physician knows to be the patient's situation would want to know

    - Doesn't ask physician to be a mind reader: objective standard

      - If patient has unusual concerns or whatever, don't count; question is about the "reasonable" patient, not "this" patient

      - Ex: I'm an earring model, can't risk scarring on ears. Reasonable patient standard wouldn't hold doctor liable for failing to take this into account **[if]{.underline}** no reason to be aware of this weird condition

    - Basically, this is an ordinary negligence test: evidence of medical standards regarding disclosure relevant, but not dispositive

    - **Failure to obtain informed consent is not actionable as malpractice, but as negligence**

    - Expert testimony required to determine what the risks and benefits of treatment were but no expert testimony regarding the defendant's violation of the standard of care: [jury can decide what a reasonable patient would do]{.underline}

  - **Reasonable physiciam standard**: actionable only as malpractice

    - Must prove that the defendant-physician failed to comply with the standards of the profession regarding disclosure of information

    - **Expert testimony required not only as to risks and benefits of the procedure, but also as to the medical standard regarding disclosure**

- Seemingly very different, but in practice arriving at same outcome: physicians disclose what patients want to know

  - **Key difference is in the requirement that there be expert testimony as to the applicable medical disclosure standard and possibility that liability won't be imposed as often under the respectable-minority rule (where it applies)**

# **CAUSATION**

## **Cause-in-Fact**

- In any tort suit, plaintiff must prove not only that the defendant was negligent and breached the requisite standard of care, but also that that the defendant's act or omission [caused the injury or damage for which the plaintiff claims compensation]{.underline}

  - **Ie, in absence of the defendant's tortious conduct, injury would not have occurred**

- Several components

  - 1\) What caused the harm

  - 2\) Who caused the harm

  - 3\) Whether [negligence]{.underline} caused the harm

  - 4\) What part of the harm was caused by what or whom?

### The "But-For" Test

- **Simplest, most widely accepted test for cause-in-fact is the "but-for" test, or sine qua non test**

  - Question: "But for" the defendant's negligence (or breach of applicable standard of care), would the plaintiff have suffered injury or damage

    - No: Cause-in-fact is established

    - Yes: Ordinarily not satisfied, defendant not liable

- Example: Someone falls out of a boat that negligently carries not life buoys to throw to those in the water. Person sinks immediately and drowns

  - Although the defendant was negligent, that [negligence was not a "but-for" cause of the drowning. Even if there had been a buoy to throw, no way to reach the person drowning because he sank immediately]{.underline}

- Example: Same facts, but the person is bobbing in the water

  - Could be a jury question whether a properly placed buoy could have been thrown

  - Some courts would want testimony about the placement, throwing ability, etc

- There are obviously many causes in fact -- or "but for" causes -- in any given event

  - For example, "but for" your parents meeting, you would not be born. "But for" the ship captain showing up to pilot the boat, person wouldn't have drowned

  - **The key question, though, is whether this cause-in-fact was [negligent]{.underline}**

    - If yes, then this act is [a cause-in-fact]{.underline}

- **Cause-in-fact is not the same as responsibility, though -- merely establishes that the party is [eligible]{.underline} for liability. To establish liability, also need to prove that the action was the [proximate cause]{.underline} of the injury**

  - We'll see this next chapter

- So, cause-in-fact is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for liability. Without cause-in-fact, party cannot be held liable; but establishing cause-in-fact does not guarantee liability

- Unlike pure empirical questions of fact, and unlike mixed questions of fact and law, the causation question is not factual but **counterfactual** -- we're asking the jury to rely on their own experience to make a decision about what would have happened, absent a given act or omission

  - Also asks court, in determining what evidence is legally sufficient to go to a jury, to determine whether an inference of what would have happened if the defendant had not been negligent is permissible

  - Inherently counterfactual nature of this inquiry means that jury's own conscious or unconscious biases may come into play when people consider what is normal

  - However, the more strictly we require a strict, concrete basis for bringing case to the jury, more often we'll say that the plaintiff hasn't made a *prima facie* case on the issue

  - Court must decide whether an inference about what would have happened [in a given situation]{.underline} is permissible (at motion to dismiss/summary judgment)

- No rule about how much narrative detail court will require before ruling that the plaintiff's burden of production on the causation issue has been satisfied

  - For example: in our drowning case, courts generally understand that people will bob about for a bit before sinking under the water, people generally aggressive about tossing out a life preserver, so this could be sufficient

  - Other courts might say that there must be more evidence about causation in this particular case

- **Some courts use the "substantial factor" test in place of the "but for" test**

  - **But for**: requires a [finding that, more probably than not]{.underline}, the defendant's negligence was a prerequisite to what happened

  - **Substantial factor:** Merely must require a finding that the [defendant's negligence was influential in some way]{.underline}

    - KA does not like this test. Not helpful way of thinking about the problem except in cases where multiple separate acts of negligence each would have been a sufficient "but for" cause of harm

### Multiple Causes, Indeterminate Causes, and Exceptions to the Conventional Test

- The "but-for" test usually works in straightforward fashion in cases involving [only one defendant]{.underline}

  - However, when multiple possible causes are involved, the [causation requirement is sometimes held to be satisfied even when the defendant's negligence is not a but-for cause]{.underline}

- Number of different exceptions, not easy to bucket into a single category

**A. Theories Underlying the Causation Requirement**

- Why is causation an element of a cause of action in a tort suit?

  - Answer may seem obvious- ie, if the defendant wasn't the cause of the injury, why should he/she be liable?

  - However, there is still a plaintiff with an injury -- if the defendant was negligent, why must there be a causal relationship between the defendant's actions and the plaintiff's injury?

**1. Justice Between the Parties**

- Doing justice between the parties; if the defendant did not cause the plaintiff's loss, seems obvious that the defendant has not wronged the plaintiff

  - No injustice to correct for, no basis for giving civil recourse

- Counterargument: negligence is still negligence; we should judge an act as blameworthy regardless of the consequences, not exclusively by them

  - What damages should be awarded then?

  - One answer is the probability-weighted damages

  - So you're compensating for "wrongs" committed

- Practically speaking, this is impossible to do -- we don't provide damages for "wrongs" but for "injuries"

  - So in this sense, proof of causation is required not for deep principled reasons but practical ones

- Causation provides [evidence of the injury]{.underline}

**2. Causation and Deterrence**

- Instrumental view of the causation requirement: deterrence, rather than justice (ie utilitarian rather than retributive view)

- Point is to deter unreasonable behavior, disincentivize potential injurers

- The problem with this argument is that [the actual damages are random]{.underline} -- ie, if I'm speeding, I'm risking anything from a \$50 ticket to a multi-million lawsuit

  - Maybe you can consider the average, but that's more helpful to an insurer with large numbers situation than any individual

- From a deterrence perspective, requiring proof of causation is not a moral imperative but rather a way to communicate to the defendant the scope of the liability

- If had a way of threatening potential defendants with liability for the cost of the risks, that might actually work better

  - However, no real reliable and accurate way of doing this

## **Causation in Informed Consent Cases**

- Back to "informed consent" cases -- after plaintiff has proven failure to make proper information disclosure, **needs to prove causal connection between the lack of disclosure and the injury**

- "But for" causation requirement here as well

  - In medical case, for example, would need to prove that "but for" the disclosure, plaintiff would not have undergone the treatment

  - [Some courts also require the plaintiff to show that the treatment would have caused less injury]{.underline}

- Difficult to prove because many, if not most people, take the advice of their physicians even after they have received disclosure

- Two situations where less likely to follow

  - Multiple treatment options, physician recommends one but the other is reasonable

  - Patient is sufficiently idiosyncratic that individual's sense of risks worth taking and plaintiff's are not aligned

    - However, plaintiff wouldn't be suing if did not think that with requisitite information, would have made a different choice, so conclusory testimony may not be worth much

- **Many courts have adopted objective standard governing this causation issue, with two views of the standard**

  - **Fully-objective standard**: Test is what an "objectively reasonable" person would have done with the additional information, ignoring preferences and idiosyncrasies

    - Plaintiff can't testify about specific preferences, etc

    - Sometimes plaintiff unable to recover even though in fact would have declined treatment

  - **Semi-objective standard**: Whether a reasonable person [in the plaintiff's position]{.underline} would have declined treatment

    - Plaintiff preferences are given consideration -- this is a piece of evidence

    - Can either be totally useless or very helpful, depending on the evidence the plaintiff may be able to provide (ie, documentation medical records, etc)

    - Basically just consider the credibility of the plaintiff's testimony

- Two different interests being protected by the doctrine of informed consent

  - 1\) Semi-objective test can protect the interest of patients who do not share the values of their doctors or most patients

  - 2\) Even if the test for causation is fully objective, doctrine can encourage disclosure to patients who, even if take doctor's advice, are doing so with full information/understanding of the risks and benefits

## **Loss of a Chance to Survive**

- *Herskovits v. Group Health Cooperative* and *Matsuyama v. Birnbaum* best known series of decisions involving already-injured or ill patients whose chance of recovery was **reduced** by the negligent actions of the defendant

  - Physician failed to diagnose cancer, from which patient would have had better chance of surviving

  - However, survival less than 50% chance even with proper diagnosis

  - **Under the conventional but-for test, no recovery**

- *Herskovits*: failed to diagnose the plaintiff's cancer until chances of survival 25% - but testimony suggested that survival only 39% with proper diagnosis

  - **Court held that could still be partial recovery**

- One way to describe: defendant held liable for the loss of the opportunity to survive

  - This is true in a superficial sense

- However, courts explain this way because otherwise slippery slope

  - Describing recovery as compensating for the loss of a chance awards damages based on the [probability that the defendant caused harm]{.underline}

  - This is generally not consistent with the but-for theory, which looks at causation as binary -- either responsible for the injury or not

  - To look at it another way: a pest control company that negligently fails to find insects in a house that would have had a less than 50% chance of avoiding infestation is also a "loss of chance"

- However, not done this way: **only look at liability for loss of a chance in medical cases**

  - One explanation: health care providers undertake to maximize a patient's chances of survival and their failure to do so should be actionable

    - But that's true of many other defendants

  - Another: *Herskovits* and *Matsuyama* would have insufficient legally created incentives to exercise care in treating patients

    - But they have plenty of non-legal incentives, and we don't apply it to other professions

  - KA explanation: there is statistical data about survival rates, especially cancer, but less in other circumstances. (Me: Medicine different than these other examples in that you frequently **don't known the outcome of the procedure or treatment**, whereas with pest control guy, you're not saying "well, there's a 34% chance we'll get these bugs, but..")

***[Matsuyama v. Birnbaum]{.underline}*** (MA 2008)

- **Facts**

  - Jury trial, found that physician was negligent in misdiagnosing the condition of the decedent over a period of approximately 3 years

  - Substantial contributing factor to decedent's death

  - Award \~\$500K -- appeal says that "loss of chance" isn't cognizable cause of action under MA law

    - \$160K for pain and suffering, \$875K full wrongful death damages based on additional 18 years of work and 28 years of life, multiplied by initial survival rate of 37.5% - I guess they're saying that he reduced it by that amount

- **Issue:** Whether Massachusetts law permits recovery for a "loss of chance" in a medical malpractice wrongful death action, where jury found that defendant physician reduced likelihood of survival of the decedent

- **Holding:** Yes, "loss of chance" doctrine views a persona's prospects for surviving a serious medical condition as something of value, even if the possibility of recovery was less than even prior to the physician's tortious conduct

  - **Where a physician's negligence reduces or eliminates the patient's prospects for achieving a more favorable medical outcome, the physician has harmed the patient and is liable for damages**

  - Limited to claims for medical negligence

- **Reasoning**

  - Addressing issue of "loss of chance" for the first time in this court, but 20 other states have adopted it, 10 refused to do so

    - Join the majority

  - Court outlines the development of why it is needed

    - Originated in dissatisfaction with the "all or nothing" rule of tort recovery

    - Plaintiff can recover only by showing that the defendant's negligence more likely than not caused the ultimate outcome -- 51% chance of survival, negligent action causes it to drop to 0, get FULL damages, while if it was at 49%, get nothing

    - Blanket release from liability whenever survival chance is less than 50%, regardless of how flagrant the negligence was

  - All or nothing rule is **inadequate to address the fundamental aims of tort law**

    - Fairly allocating the costs and risks of injuries

    - Failing to deter medical negligence

    - Doesn't provide proper incentives to ensure that doesn't slip below standard of care of the average member of the profession

    - Fails to ensure that victims are compensated

  - Additional unfair because the person doesn't have a chance to demonstrate counterfactual

    - That's not really specific to medicine though?

  - Defendants argue that the loss of chance doctrine "lowers the threshold of proof of causation" by diluting the preponderance of the evidence standard that is the "bedrock of the MA civil justice system"

    - Some courts have approached the issue of how to recognize loss of chance by carving out an exception to the rule that the plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that has "caused" the injuries

  - **MA rejects this approach**: in cases involving loss of chance, as in any other negligence context, plaintiff must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant caused his injury

    - **However, injury doesn't mean death**

    - Injury = diminishing or destroying chance of survival

  - **Loss of chance isn't a theory of causation (in MA) but a theory of injury**

    - **In order to prove loss of chance, plaintiff must prove by preponderance of the evidence that the physician's negligence caused the likelihood of achieving a more favorable outcome to diminish**

      - This is stupid. How do you prove by a preponderance of the evidence that you reduced likelihood of survival by 20%?

  - Court says that survival statistics aren't speculative -- the magnitude of the probability is distinct from the degree of confidence in it

    - This is true?

  - Key is the reliability of the evidence available to the fact-finder

    - For certain conditions, medical science has progressed to the point that physicians can gauge chance of survival to reasonable degree of accuracy; don't need to speculate

    - Expert witnesses can be pretty confident

  - Ramifications are not immense -- limited to medical malpractice

    - Unique obligations in medical space -- LOL quotes Abrams

    - Not uncommon to have less than even chance of survival

  - Damages: proportional to amount of life reduced

  - **Evidence of causation**

    - Defendants say that judge instructed on a substantial contributing factor

      - Court says that this is useful in cases in which there are multiple causes / multiple tortfeasors where impossible to say who was the but-for cause of harm, even though it can be shown that in aggregate, cause of harm

      - However, not in loss of chance case in which one defendant's malpractice alone is alleged to have caused the victim's diminished likelihood of a more favorable outcome

    - Court says that this didn't prejudice the defendant though

## **Injury Caused by Multiple Sufficient Causes**

- Going to look at but-for causation where two forces converge on the plaintiff and either one alone would be sufficient to be but-for causation

1\. Two Simultaneous Causes: Both Negligent

- Two independently and negligently-set fires are burning toward the plaintiff's house

- Either fire alone is sufficient to destroy the house, but they both reach the house at the same time, destroying it together

- In a suit against those who set the fires, plaintiff cannot satisfy the but-for test: but-for EITHER defendant's negligence, the house would have been destroyed

  - However, courts have held that plaintiffs can't escape liability this way: both are held to have caused it

- One way of looking at it is that although neither was a but-for cause of the plaintiff's harm, both were substantial

- Abraham likes another way: the tests are just meant to capture broader concept of liability, and it would be absurd to say that neither "caused" the fire, or to hold that plaintiff can't get compensation because two people burned his house down rather than one

2\. Two Simultaneous Causes: One Negligent, One Not

- Next suppose the same facts, but that only one of the fires is negligently set

- Again, the but-for test is not satisfied, because the house would have been destroyed by a single fire alone

- This is a tougher case, but courts will impose liability here, but ONLY if the negligently set fire arrived no later than the non-negligently set one

  - It would be peculiar to say that the negligently set fire didn't contribute to the damage, as it was literally burning the house down

  - Additionally, imposing liability will give incentive to not set negligent fires

3\. Sequential Causes: Pre-Emptive Causation

- Next, suppose that two fires arrive sequentially

- First totally destroys the plaintiff's house, very shortly after second arrives

- Neither can be said to be a but-for cause of the harm, but the first fire was the actual physical cause of the harm, or the "pre-emptive" cause

  - In this case, first fire, if negligently set, bears all liability

  - Second fire cannot be liable because it did not physically cause the harm

    - So in this case, kind of luck out

- Rules are firmly established, they're not entirely consistent

  - Example: I run into you with my car and break your leg, causing you to miss your flight. The plane crashes, everyone is killed. But-for this car accident, you would have been killed. However, but-for this accident, you would not have broken your leg

    - I bear full liability for the broken leg, under the theory of causation. I pre-empted the alternative theory of causation. I also pay full damages. Damages award does not consider the but-for fact that had I not crashed into you, you would be dead.

  - Alternative: I run into you with my car and break your leg. However, you have terminal cancer and only a few months to live. But-for the car accident, you would have a whole leg

    - I bear full liability for the broken leg, under the but-for theory of causation, pre-empting the plane crash theory of causation. However, the damages award takes into account the fact that you only have a few months to live, reducing the damages award.

## **Alternative liability**

- Cluster of cases that are is especially troublesome under conventional rules of causation -- plaintiff is clearly injured by tortious conduct but cannot prove which of several possible defendants was more probably than not the actual cause of his or her injury

  - Or, defendant has clearly injured some but not all of the plaintiffs, and cannot prove which of them the defendant injured

- Number of classic cases, different approaches to dealing with it

**1. Alternative Liability -- *Summers v. Tice*** (Cal. 1948)

- In *Summers*, two different hunters negligently show in the direction of the plaintiff, a third hunter

- One struck the eye of the plaintiff, who sued both hunters

  - Each was "as probably as not" the but-for cause of injury to the plaintiff, but not more probably than not the cause

  - Court held that under these circumstances the burden shifted to each of the defendants to disprove that he had caused the harm

- ***Summers* understood to involve more than a shift of the burden of proof: classic case of "alternative" liability, imposing liability on negligent defendants, each of whom is equally likely to have harmed the plaintiff**

  - Rationale for this method not obvious

    - Court says that applying the conventional but-for approach would exonerate the defendants, even though both were negligent and the injury resulted from only one of them

    - But this just shows that the but-for test relieves them of liability, not justification for not using it

  - These cases are fairly uncommon -- suggests that court unwilling to relieve from liability in borderline cases, so just say \>50% liability

    - Add three or more defendants and equal odds pushes everyone below the 50% threshold

  - Connection between defendants and the plaintiffs can be determinative

    - When connection between plaintiff and defendant is very remote, less likely liability is imposed

    - Another factor for invoking alternative liability: connection among the defendants

      - If defendants had been doing something together, could hold them "jointly and severally liable," ie without proof of which of them did it

        - Potentially plaintiff felt that if that happened, he'd be deemed part of the group and therefore contributory negligence would be incurred

***[Summers v. Tice]{.underline}*** (Cal. 1948)

- **Facts:** Plaintiff and defendant were hunting quail when both fired in plaintiff's direction -- one shot the eye and the other shot the lip. Both using same type of shotgun. Trial judge found both defendants negligent and found that plaintiff in no way at fault

  - Unable to decide between the two of them, court awards damage to both; they appeal

- **Issue**: How to determine liability when two defendants equal probability of being liable, but not greater than 50%. Can both be liable? Neither?

- **Holding**: Defendants bear the burden of proof of establishing their lack of liability -- each one is liable for the **whole** injury and has obligation to discharge that burden

- **Reasoning**

  - Defendants argue that they are

    - Not joint tortfeasors, thus jointly and severally liable, as not acting in concert

    - Insufficient evidence to show which one guilty of the negligence which caused the injuries

  - Lower court determined that they are **both** liable, ie both responsible

    - Implicit in the finding is the assumption that the court was unable to determine whether the shots were from the gun of one defendant or the other

    - Shot that hit in the eye major cause of damages, couldn't have come from both

  - Court notes that while there have been cases where group of people are held collectively liable because they were acting together and made a collective decision

    - Court doesn't like that in this case -- seems like it was independent action

  - Instead, draws on *Oliver v. Miles*, where hunting together, shot at same partridges, hit plaintiff across the highway

    - Court there holds that each is liable for the injury although no one can say definitively who shot him

    - Otherwise would have to exonerate both defendants from liability, even though the injury resulted from someone's negligence

  - Defendants should therefore bear the burden of proof

    - Both wrongdoers -- both negligent toward the plaintiff

    - Should rest with each to defendant themselves, absolve

    - Injured party in position of pointing to which plaintiff is the one that caused the harm

      - Both shouldn't be able to escape liability simply because it's difficult to point to which one of the two caused the harm

    - Gives example of *Ybarra v. Spangard*, plaintiff unconscious on the operating table and doesn't know which person who came by injured

  - Plaintiff changed theory of the case in claiming a concert of action, but didn't plead that

  - Joint liability, as well as the lack of knowledge as to which defendant was liable -- pleaded and proof developed under the theory

  - **Case is based on the legal proposition that, under the circumstances, each defendant is liable for the [whole]{.underline} damage whether they are deemed to be acting in concert or independently**

- **Note**

  - What if although either pellet hit, only Tice was negligent?

  - *Garcia v. Joseph Vince Co.* (Cal. 1978): Plaintiff was injured by a defective saber, fencing. Can't pick which saber it is in the pile that injured him, choice between two manufacturers. Court declines to apply *Summers v. Tice*, case dismissed

**APPORTIONMENT**

## **Comparative negligence**

**2. Basis for Comparison**

- Comparative *[negligence]{.underline}* is distinct from comparative *[causation]{.underline}*

  - Possible for a party to be slightly negligent and cause a lot of damage, or be extremely negligent and cause very little damage

  - Not completely separate concepts though, because foreseeable probability of causing harm is a part of negligence, but that probability is also causation

  - Jury decision regarding the degree of negligence attributable should therefore take into account the probability that the conduct in question will cause harm, even though the amount of causal contribution under the circumstances in any particular case is not relevant

    - So, sort of an average potential causal contribution under the circumstances rather than a particular amount

  - Pure comparative causation system difficult to separate from negligence

    - Example, car A is driving 60 miles per hour in a 30 zone, car B is driving 90 miles per hour. How do I calculate the causation?

      - Using negligence as a proxy: Car A is responsible for 30/90 of the negligence, car B responsible for 60/90 negligence

      - Not negligence, total speed: 60/150 Car A, 90/150 Car B

      - But both of these ignore other factors like weight

    - But comparing negligence is also not so straightforward: in our example, is it really true that driving 90 mph in a 30 zone is only twice as negligent as driving 60? When 60, you have control of your car, but when 90, many of us have almost no experience

- Comparing different ***types of negligence*** (apples and oranges, or apples and unicorns?)

  - I fail to trim my bushes, obscuring stop sign. Defendant doesn't see, and driving above the speed limit, hits a third party. How do we determine the relative/comparative negligence?

    - It all adds up to 100%, but...how do we get there

- **Note: When determining damages, you apportion by [negligence]{.underline}, after determining whether or not the actor was a cause-in-fact. Theoretically at least -- look to BP, doesn't really seem like that's how it happened**

**3. Assessment**

- Debate about the effectiveness of contributory vs comparative negligence in deterring accidents

  - Consensus seems to be that neither is systematically better at deterring accidents

    - Idea that plaintiffs "choose" to get in accidents pretty silly

    - Most people not even aware of the system

- Appeal of comparative vs contributory negligence fundamentally that it's more fair -- we don't like the idea of someone who is a little bit negligent losing out on any opportunity to recover

**APPLICATIONS**

## **Multiple Defendants**

- Suppose that the plaintiff is 40% negligent and two defendants are 35% and 25% negligent, respectively. In a modified comparative negligence regime, does the plaintiff recover anything?

  - Modified comparative negligence: if plaintiff above 50%, then nothing, otherwise recovery reduced proportionally

  - Depends on the logic

    - If the idea is that the plaintiff shouldn't be able to recover if she is responsible for the absolute majority of her harm, then permit recovery

      - Majority rule (for those using modified comparative negligence)

    - If idea is that the plaintiff shouldn't be able to recover if she is responsible for more harm than any of the defendants, then no

      - Minority rule (for those using modified comparative negligence)

### Joint and Several Liability

- Joint and several liability means that each of the multiple defendants is liable to the plaintiff for the FULL AMOUNT of the damages, until the judgment is satisfied

- Prior to adoption of comparative negligence, imposing joint and several was not problematic

  - Only completely innocent plaintiff was recovering, so defendants bore all of the risk of the insolvency of one of the defendants

<!-- -->

- **Under comparative negligence though, this is problematic**

- Example: P is 40% negligent, D1 is 35% negligence, and D2 is 25% negligent. The defendants are jointly and severally liable. How much of the damages is each defendant liable for

  - 1\) Each defendant liable for all

    - If award is \$100, P's 40% negligence reduces it to \$60, and both D1 and D2 are responsible for that amount

    - If defendants are joint tortfeasors, this makes sense, or if acted in concert. If concurrently negligent, not as much

  - 2\) Each defendant responsible for his/her own part, rejecting joint and several liability entirely

    - If the award is \$100, D1 is liable for \$35 and D2 is liable for \$25

    - Flaw -- plaintiff bears burden of insolvency entirely

  - 3\) Proportional burden of insolvency

    - Award is \$100, plaintiff bears 40% negligence, D1 35%, D2 25%. D2 is insolvent

    - \$25 credit is owed to the defendant, can't get it

      - Plaintiff missing out of 40/(40+35) x \$25. His responsibility to recover

      - D1 liable for \$35 plus an additional 35/(40+35) x \$25. Could sue for contribution to get it back obviously

<!-- -->

- When two or more defendants are liable to the plaintiff for the same harm, law typically treats as "joint and severally liable"

  - Just means each is liable for the WHOLE harm

- **Joint and several liability imposed in three situations**

  - 1\) Defendants may be **joint tortfeasors**, ie engaging in the activity together

  - 2\) Independent tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable for a **single, theoretically indivisible harm**

    - Ex: One defendant speeds through an intersection and another fails to stop at a red light -- the two collide and one runs onto the sidewalk, injuring pedestrian

    - Under but-for causation, each one is cause-in-fact of the pedestrian's injuries, because neither alone would be sufficient

  - 3\) Independent TF J&S liable for a single, theoretically divisible but **practically indivisible harm**

    - Example -- one defendant's negligence leads to collision with plaintiff's vehicle, second caused a second collision. Theoretically could divide the harm up between the two vehicles, but practically it's impossible to tell who damaged what with the car

    - Early common law: plaintiff can't recover because he can't prove the amount of harm each defendant caused

    - **Modern rule: each defendant is entitled to prove how much harm he caused. If successful, liability is apportioned**

      - Ie, not jointly and severally liable

- **When there is joint and several liability, need to apportion damages among the tortfeasors**

  - Plaintiff can recover the full amount of his injuries in aggregate, but not **greater** than the total amount of damages

  - Ie, if I have \$100K in damages from a car crash, two defendants simultaneously crashed into me while I was parked in the parking lot, I can recover \$100K in aggregate, not \$200K

  - Judgment is "satisfied" at \$100K, regardless of how apportioned

- At common law, if first defendant paid the full amount, second received a windfall, and when each paid only a portion, that was it

  - **This is obviously unfair, and in every state, [rights of contribution]{.underline} established among joint and severally liable tortfeasors**

    - **Right of contribution:** Right to be reimbursed for a portion of the damages paid to the plaintiff

- **Traditionally, damage threshold apportioned fractionally in proportion to the number of defendants**

  - If three tortfeasors jointly and severally liable and one pays the full award, entitled to contribution for up to 1/3 of the total from each of the other two

  - *[Still the approach in some states]{.underline}*

- **Why allocate share of responsibility later rather than doing so in the first instance?**

  - One or more of the defendants may be insolvent or otherwise impossible to collect from

  - Imposing joint and several liability shifts the burden onto the *[defendants]{.underline}* for the insolvency, not the plaintiff

  - Policy: if we have an innocent plaintiff and negligent or otherwise liable defendants, plaintiff for fairness reasons should be able to recover, then force the defendans to figure out how to collect from the insolvent defendant

- However, **comparative negligence** has replaced contributory negligence in [most states]{.underline}

  - Now, plaintiff is not always innocent

  - Negligent plaintiff is not barred from recovery - recovery reduced in proportion to the percentage of negligence attributable to him

  - Many states assess contribution shares of co-defendants **in proportion to their amount of negligence attributable to each co-defendant**, rather than on a straight fractional basis

  - Several dozen states have enacted statutes modifying their rules governing joint and several liability

  - Some impose liability, for example, only on a defendant whose negligence consists of more than 50 percent of the negligence attributable to all of the defendants

### Market Share Liability

- *Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories* (Cal. 1980): Class action. Women whose mothers had taken the drug while they were pregnant. Issue is that no one can figure out **which** drug they took, even though all making the same, chemically identical, product

  - Court's solution: "Market-share liability," plaintiff could recover from each drug company \$ amount equivalent to the company's market share

    - So if I have \$100 worth of damages and Abbott had 60% of the market, can recover \$6 without proving Abbott individually manufactured the drug that injured me

  - This way, Abbott, who it is established in aggregate did harm equivalent to its market share of DES (this drug that hurt people), can't escape liability simply because each individual plaintiff cannot prove that it made the specific dose she ingested

  - **Positives:** Optimal for deterrence and plaintiff recovery

  - **Negatives**: Corrective justice not well-served; plaintiff doesn't get a chance to recover from the specific defendant that injured her

- There are limitations, however -- can't use market-share liability for all diseases

  - **1) Diseases have multiple causes**

    - If I have X disease, there are a number of different toxins or whatever that could have caused it, each with a number of different defendants

    - In *Sindell*, there was a signature disease with one drug that worked, so didn't have this issue

    - So no market-share liability for asbestos, lead-based paint, etc

  - **2) Products in same market aren't always fungible**

    - *Skipworth v. Lead Industries Associates* (Pa. 1997): court refused to apply market-share liability to manufacturers of a lead pigment that was in the past used in house paint, in part because different pigments had different chemical formations. Because these pigments therefore resulted in different levels of bioavailability, different manufacturers didn't necessarily cause harm in proportion to their market share

  - **3) Relevant market share data isn't always available**

    - If harm was actually incurred say, 20 years ago, relevant market share data might not be available

    - Which market share? State? Local? National?

    - What if the defendant can prove it never sold drugs in a given state, so 100% not responsible?

  - **4) Not feasible to sue all possible defendants**

    - Some have gone out of business, others not subject to jurisdiction, so result is that recovering from smaller pool

    - **Relative market-share approach** used in *Sindell*, later discarded: so sue a substantial portion of the market, have them collectively responsible for the remainder

      - So if 5 companies each had 20%, one of them is bankrupt, plaintiff has claim to ¼ of the damages from each of them, or 20/(20x4)

    - **Absolute market share approach** also a possibility, but then, like joint and several liability issues, it is the plaintiff who is bearing the burden of insolvency

    - Minimum threshold of market available to sue before allowing?

- **Purpose is to say that while theoretically appealing, substantial practical limitations, so the market-share liability method is not a panacea**

  - Only half of the fifteen states that have addressed the issue have allowed it for DES cases specifically

  - Number of those courts rejected outright

  - Minority have applied to other products

***[Hymowitz v. Eli Lilly]{.underline}*** (COA NY 1989)

- **Facts:** Plaintiffs suing over drug DES, ingested by their mothers during pregnancy, against drug manufacturers. [Not class action]{.underline}, but court says there are many similar cases so wants to structure such that can do justice and be administratively feasible

- **Issue:** Does plaintiff have a cognizable tort claim

- **Holding:**

- **Reasoning**

  - DES made by a number of different manufacturers, used widely by 1951 through 1971, when FDA banned it as a miscarriage preventative; studies showed that could lead to harmful latent effects upon offspring who took the drug -- specifically, vaginal adenocarcinoma and adenosis

  - Strong evidence links prenatal DES exposure to later development of serious medical issues, plaintiffs facing issue

    - 1\) Identification of the manufacturer of a given DES drug very difficult

    - 2\) Many claims barred by the statute of limitations

  - Druggists general filling DES with whatever on hand, many different players entering and exiting the market, long latency period makes very difficult to track down any given record

  - Statute of limitations issued resolved via legislation, which made the statute begin to run upon discovery of the latent effects of exposure, not initial exposure

  - In a products liability action, identification of the exact defendant whose product has injured the plaintiff is generally very important, but impossibility in a DES case

  - **But, alternative liability established in *Summers v. Tice* (summarizes the case, two guys shoot at plaintiff, both held liable jointly and severally for single injury)**

    - Court says that this is similarly applicable here, or at least the concept of holding several accountable, but the issue is that the DES manufacturers aren't in any position to know who did what than the plaintiff

    - Moreover, lots of different defendants, so likelihood of any given defendant causing harm is very remote (so contribution actions not helpful either)

  - Theory of concerted action not helpful -- no indication that the defendants were all working together

    - Parallel activity insufficient to establish the agreement element necessary

  - Notes *Sindell* in passing, says that some sort of judicial action is necessary to resolve this issue

  - Policy considerations demand some action

    - Legislature has passed laws reviving statute of limitations for people to make claims

    - Uniquely difficult to discover who is responsible

    - Justice and fairness requires some action

  - DES singular case, where manufacturers producing identical product generically marketed, which caused injury many years ago, evoking legislative response reviving barred actions.

    - Appropriate that the loss be borne by the producers of the drug, rather than the individuals

    - So question is how to create judicial remedy

  - **Application of the *Sindell* method -- notes years of litigation** (national market eventually established, liability limited to absolute market share, etc)

  - **Market share theory based on the national market is the best solution**

    - Can't reliably determine market share in any smaller market

    - Particular case could require a separate market share matrix, which sort of defeats the point and makes it administratively difficult

    - Acknowledges that liability will not come to approximate the causation in the given state, or that the use of a national market will provide a reasonable link between liability and risk to particular plaintiff

    - Choose to apportion liability so as to correspond to the **[overall]{.underline}** culpability of the defendant

    - Defendant can show that it didn't participate in the marketing for pregnancy use, if it wasn't a member of the market (which market)

    - However, showing that it wasn't responsible for a particular dose insufficient

    - **Liability is several only (ie, not inflated because of other defendants not available for recovery)**

- **Concurrence**

  - Has his own version of market-share liability

  - Plaintiff must establish

    - 1\) That the mother ingested DES during the pregnancy

    - 2\) That the plaintiff's injuries caused by DES

    - 3\) That the defendant or defendants marketed or sold DES for pregnancy purposes

  - Then burden shifts to the defendant

    - Must establish that could not have made a particular pill by a preponderance of the evidence

    - Defendants unable to do so are liable based on national market share

  - Would also make liability joint and several

  - Says that the majority is creating a system that's a fundamental departure from the principles of tort law

    - If defendant can prove that it was not responsible for an individual injury, then it shouldn't have to bear liability

- **Notes**

  - 1\) Judges in *Hymowitz* disagree over whether defendants should be able to exculpate themselves.

  - 2\) Disagree over joint and several liability vs several liability

    - **Joint liability**: Each liable for all, but can't sue for remaining amount from the others

      - Can only once though -- if someone defaults, can't go after the others

    - **Several liability**: Each liable for discrete portion

    - **Joint and several liability**: Each individual responsible for the collective whole, and plaintiff can sue each until gets the judgment. Responsibility of the others to apportion liability via contribution

  - 3\) Market-share liability greatly limited

    - Fungibility an issue with asbestos and childhood vaccines

    - SDNY 2005 found liability for groundwater contamination due to MTBE, chemical gasoline additive

      - Fungible

      - Plaintiffs can't identify manufacturers

      - Clear causal relationship between product and harm

## **Proximate cause / scope of liability**

**Introduction and Basics**

- Defendants are not necessarily liable for all of the harm that their breach of the applicable standard of care have caused

  - Even after it is determined that the defendant is under a duty to exercise reasonable care, and even after the plaintiff has proved the other elements of his cause (breach of duty, damages, and cause in fact), **liability is not imposed unless the defendant's actions were a "proximate cause" of the plaintiff's injury**

    - As with cause in fact, there can be more than one proximate cause of a harm

    - Multiple defendants each may be a proximate cause of the same harm

  - After the other prerequisites to liability are satisfied, the doctrine of proximate cause operates as a limitation on the scope of the defendant's liability

- Proximate cause requirement also applies in strict liability cases (ask whether the plaintiff suffered a harm)

**I. The Basics**

### Foreseeability

- In ordinary cases, the touchstone of proximate cause is foreseeability (a minority of courts subscribe to a "directness" test, discussed in Section II)

- Defendant

- **Negligence is a proximate cause of the plaintiff's harm if causing that harm was a foreseeable result of the plaintiff's actions**

  - Ordinary cases, no question at all that if the defendant was in fact negligent and this negligence was a cause in fact of the plaintiff's harm, then the proximate cause requirement is also fulfilled

  - For example: defendant fails to stop at a red light and collides with the defendant's vehicle

    - Defendant is 1) negligent, 2) plaintiff suffered damage, 3) defendant's negligence was a cause in fact of that damage

    - Was the defendant's negligence a "proximate cause" of that damage? *[Of course]{.underline}*

    - Highly foreseeable that someone passing through the intersection would be harmed if the defendant did not stop at the red light!

      - In fact, the risk that this harm would result from running the red light is the principal basis for concluding that the defendant was negligent in the first place

    - In this instance, jury wouldn't even be instructed on proximate cause -- question is whether the defendant was negligent because the rest follows so obviously

- **Worth noting that foreseeability figures in both negligent and proximate cause determination**

  - Negligence: Whether the defendant was *[negligent at all]{.underline}*, ie unreasonably risking harm to someone or something

    - Foreseeability a factor here as cannot be negligent if reasonable person wouldn't have thought this would occur

  - Proximate cause: Whether the *[harm to this plaintiff or class of plaintiffs]{.underline}* was foreseeable

    - Foreseeability a factor as can't really say it was a cause if freak thing occurred

### Harm Within the Risk Test 

- Foreseeability test sometimes clarified and sharpened by the harm-within-the-harm test

- Typical negligence cause almost always automatically satisfies the proximate cause requirement if the defendant was negligent

- However, occasional freak cases where defendant's negligence was *[not]{.underline}* a proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury

  - **Injury to the plaintiff was not a "harm-within-the-risk" that made the defendant's action negligent**

- Example: Defendant negligently parks his car next to a fire hydrant -- principal risk posed by this act is that blocked access to the hydrant will result in the destruction of property or injury to people by fire because the firefighters cannot gain access to the hydrant

  - Plaintiff skids on the road and collides with the defendant's parked vehicle

  - Plaintiff proves that but-for the defendant's negligence in being parked where he was, the plaintiff would not have crashed into the defendant's car

  - So we've proved that the defendant was negligent for parking in this spot, the plaintiff suffered injury, and defendant's parking in the wrong spot was a cause-in-fact for the plaintiff's injury (had he parked in a different spot, the plaintiff wouldn't have crashed)

  - But is the location of the plaintiff's car a proximate cause of the defendant's injury?

    - **No. Harm-within-the-risk test. The act of parking next to the fire hydrant instead of a dozen feet further down the road did not increase the risk that this harm would materialize. A motorist is no more likely to crash into a car parked next to a hydrant than it is a car parked a legal distance from the hydrant**

- Negligence is conduct that *[unreasonably increases the risk of harm]{.underline}*; the act of negligence in this case did not increase the risk of this harm occurring

  - What happened was not "foreseeable"

    - It was in the sense that it was "imaginable"

    - But not in the sense that it was a risk we would want the defendant to consider this risk when making parking decisions

- Number of cases like this

  - *Berry v. Borough of Sugar Notch*: negligence of operating a trolley above the speed limit proximate cause of harm that resulted when a tree fell on the speeding trolley as it passed by

    - **Holding: No; while it was a factual cause of the harm, was not a result of the negligent act, speeding. Speeding didn't increase the risk of being hit by a falling tree. As a matter of law, the negligence at issue was not a proximate cause of the damage that occurred**

  - *Gorris Scott*: Sheep washed overboard from a ship as a result of negligent violation of a regulation saying that they should be kept in pens. But the regulation was promulgated under a statute designed to protect the sheep from contagious disease not to keep them from being washed overboard.

    - **Holding: Under the harm within the risk framework, this harm (being washed overboard) was not increased by failure to follow the statute designed to protect the sheep from getting sick. *[The scope of the defendant's liability for negligence did not extend to those harm]{.underline}***

- However, not always so simple, as the harm within the risk framework does not easily resolve them

  - For example: say a railroad company violates a statute requiring that it put up a fence its right of way area. As a result, a child walks onto the tracks and is injured. Legislative history suggests that the purpose of the statute was to prevent livestock from wandering on to the tracks

    - However, many courts would find that while this injury to the child does not fall within the primary harm within the risk framework, a secondary purpose of the statute was to reduce risk of injury to people as well as livestock. So, liability

- Issues can arise even lacking a specific statute: question is whether, although the risk that materialized in harm was not the *[principal]{.underline}* risk that made the defendant's action negligent, it was still sufficiently significant to be a factor in the negligence determination

  - **"Was the defendant's negligence a proximate cause of the plaintiff's harm,"** essentially

  - *Wagner v. International Railway Co.*: defendant had been negligent in failing to close the door to one of its cars, permitting the plaintiff's cousin to be thrown out as the train rounded a curve. Plaintiff was injured while attempting to rescue his cousin

    - **Holding (Cardozo):** While negligence was in risking harm to someone thrown from the train, court holds that "danger invites rescue." One of the risks that makes it negligent to risk harm to another (when it's negligent to do so) is the risk that a different individual will be injured trying to rescue

      - Many jurisdictions would hold a defendant liable even if rescue not foreseeable (as long as initial danger negligently caused, obviously)

- Foreseeability and harm within the risk tests straightforward ways of attempting to understand the basic scope of a defendant's liability of negligence and understand the doctrine of proximate cause

- However, not the end of the inquiry

  - 1\) When the tests are satisfied, usually liability for physical harm, but when not satisfied, can still be liability

  - 2\) Scope of liability can be complex

***[Berry v. Sugar Notch Borough]{.underline}*** (PA 1899)

- **Facts:** Plaintiff "motorman" (driving a car?) through borough of Sugar Notch. City ordinance says can't go above 8mph, which he apparently is. Tree falls on the car, crushing it and injuring him. Plaintiff sues \[apparently the borough\]. City claiming contributory negligence for exceeding the speed limit, appeals on loss

- **Issue:** Whether fact that motorman's negligence in exceeding speed limit when tree fell on him was a/the proximate cause of the accident, therefore he was contributorily negligent

- **Holding:** No, judgment affirmed

- **Reasoning**

  - Defense argues that because the tree fell on him while he was driving underneath it, the speed was the immediate cause of the injury. Had he been driving at or below the posted limit, he would not have been injured

  - Court rejects this argument; the tree fell on him by chance, was not a foreseeable harm within the risk

    - Speeding made him no more or less likely to be hit by a falling tree in the abstract than were he driving the speed limit

  - Alternatively, defense argues that the speed made him more injured

    - Court says maybe that's true, but what basis would jury have for finding that, or differentiating between his injuries at legal speed

**RESTATEMENT (3RD) OF TORTS** *§29*

An actor's liability is limited to those harms that result from the risks that made the actor's conduct tortious

**Comment D**

Harm is different from the harms risked by the tortious conduct

- Central idea: an actor should be held liable *[only for the harm that was among the potential harms]{.underline}* that made the actor's conduct tortious

- "Scope of liability" used to describe the harms that fall within this and for which the defendant is subject to liability and to differentiate from those harms for which the defendant is not. Consider

  - 1\) risks that made the actor's conduct tortious

  - 2\) whether the harm for which recovery is sought was a result of any of those risks

- Jury (or court, if matter of law) should go back to the reasons for find the defendant engaged in negligent or other tortious conduct

  - If the harms risked by that tortious conduct include the general sort of harm suffered by the plaintiff, the defendant is subject to liability for the plaintiff's harm

- Standard imposed: "harm must be within the *[scope of the risk]{.underline}*"

- [Example]{.underline}: Richard, a hunter, finishes his day in the field and stops at a friend's house; nine-year-old daughter, Kim, greets Richard, who hands her his loaded shotgun. She drops it on her toe, breaking it

  - Richard is [negligent]{.underline} for giving the nine-year-old girl a loaded shotgun

  - However, he is negligent because the child might accidentally shoot herself or someone else with it, not because she might drop it on her toe and hurt herself

  - **His negligent and tortious action was not the proximate cause/within the scope of liability of her harm.** **He is not liable**

- [Example]{.underline}: ABC Transport Co. provides a company-owned vehicle to Henry for personal and business use. Henry, while driving on vacation, loses control of his vehicle and crashes into a billboard owned by XYZ Company. XYZ sues ABC, claiming that it negligently entrusted this vehicle to Henry because Henry had an history of moving violations and accidents, all of which were known by ABC

  - **If the factfinder determines that ABC was negligent in providing the vehicle to Henry, XYZ's harm will be within the scope of liability because the risk that made ABC negligent was that Henry would drive poorly**

- [Counterexample]{.underline}: Henry lends his car to Michelle after they go out for dinner. Michelle negligently runs into Vivian, a pedestrian. Vivian introduces no evidence that Henry had a propensity to lend his car to poor drivers

  - **Vivian's harm is outside the scope of liability of any negligence by ABC in entrusting the car to Henry, as a matter of law. (Whether ABC is liable merely because it is the owner is a separate issue.)**

- Tortious conduct may be wrongful because of a variety of risks. For example, driving a vehicle negligently poses risks not only to person and property who could be injured by a collision, but also may cause incidental harms incurred by say, a narrowly averted collision, confusion and distraction caused by the accident scene

  - [Example]{.underline}: Parker is run off a narrow hill by Wilson, who is driving negligently. Because the accident is unusual, Deborah stops to take a look and is hit by another vehicle driven carelessly into her car. Whether Deborah's harm is within the scope of liability created by Wilson's negligence in causing the accident is a question for the factfinder.

- **Different factual situations can lead to different outcomes**

  - [Example]{.underline}: Arthur owns a convenience store located within an exclusive, gated community. Sandy, who lives there, trips in his parking lot one night, fracturing her skull. Sandy sues, arguing that because Arthur failed to have a light illuminating the parking lot, it was pitch dark and she couldn't see; this caused her injury.

    - If the factfinder determines that Arthur was negligent in failing to provide a light, Sandy's harm would be within the scope of Arthur's liability, because the risk of someone falling in the parking lot due to darkness is among the risks that made Arthur negligent for failing to provide lighting in the parking lot.

  - [Counterexample]{.underline}: Same facts, but Sheldon, a thief, tunnels under the fence owned and maintained by the homeowner's association that surrounds the community. Sheldon sees Sandy leave the store and approaches her from behind, tripping her. Sandy suffers a skull fracture. No prior assaults had occurred at the store. Sheldon's role in causing Sandy's harm is relevant to whether that harm is outside the scope of Arthur's liability. **The factfinder may decide that the harm she suffered arose from the risk of a criminal attack due to darkness but that this was not a foreseeable risk because it occurred in a gated community without any previous criminal history.**

- **Many jurisdictions are hesitant to impose liability for failing to protect others from risk of criminal attack if there was no prior criminal history and may say that Sandy's harm is outside the scope of liability as a matter of law**

  - Thus, points out the fact-intensive nature of these inquiries

**NEW JERSEY PROXIMATE CAUSE JURY INSTRUCTIONS**

If you find that \[name of defendant or other party\] was negligent, **you must find that** \[name of defendant or other party\] **negligence was a proximate cause of the accident/incident/event before you can find that \[name of defendant or other party\] was responsible for \[name of plaintiff or other party\]' s claimed injury/loss/harm**. It is the duty of \[name of plaintiff\] to establish, by the preponderance of evidence, that the negligence of \[name of defendant or other party\] was a proximate cause of the accident/incident/event and of the injury/loss/harm allegedly to have resulted from \[name of defendant or other party\] negligence.

The basic question for you to resolve is whether \[name of plaintiff or other party\]'s injury/loss/harm is so connected with the negligent actions or inactions of \[name of defendant or other party\] that you decide it is reasonable, in accordance with the instructions I will now give you, that \[name of defendant or other party\] should be held wholly or partially1 responsible for the injury/loss/harm.

**NEW JERSEY INTERVENING OR SUPERSEDING CAUSE JURY INSTRUCTIONS**

In this case, \[name of defendant or other party\] claims that the accident/incident/event or plaintiff's injury/loss/harm was caused by an independent intervening cause and, therefore, that \[name of defendant or other party\] was not a contributing factor to the accident/incident/event or injury/loss/harm.

An intervening cause is the act of an independent agency that destroys the causal connection between the defendant's \[or other party's\] negligence and the accident/incident/event or injury/loss/harm. To be an intervening cause the independent act must be the immediate and sole cause of the accident/incident/event or injury/loss/harm. **The intervening cause must be one that so completely supersedes the operation of** \[name of defendant or other party\]' s **negligence that you find that the intervening event caused the** **accident/incident/event or injury/loss/harm, without** \[name of defendant or other party\]**'s negligence contributing to it in any material way**. In that case liability will not be established because \[name of defendant or other party\]'s negligence is not a proximate cause of the accident/incident/event or injury/loss/harm.

However, \[name of defendant or other party\] **would not be relieved from liability for his/her/its negligence by the intervention of acts of third persons, if those acts were reasonably foreseeable**. By that I mean, that the causal connection between \[name of defendant or other party\]' s negligence and the accident/incident/event or injury/loss/harm is not broken if the intervening cause is one that might, in the natural and ordinary course of things, be anticipated as not entirely improbable.2 **Where the intervention of third parties is reasonably foreseeable, then there still may be a causal connection between the defendant's \[or other party's\] negligence and the accident/incident/event or injury/loss/harm. The fact that there were intervening causes that were foreseeable or that were normal incidents of the risk created does not relieve the defendant of liability**.3

**What Must Be Foreseeable: When May Liability Be Imposed for the Unforeseeable?**

- Four categories of cases in which something unforeseeable has occurred and question is whether there is (or whether the jury could impose) liability despite this unforeseeability

  - **Unforeseeable plaintiffs**

    - *[Matters a lot]{.underline}*

  - **Unforeseeable extent of harm**

    - *[Doesn't matter much]{.underline}*

  - **Unforeseeable types of harm**

  - **Unforeseeable manner of harm**

    - *[Doesn't matter much]{.underline}*

### Unforeseeable plaintiffs

- *Palsgraf v. Long Island Railway*

  - **Facts:** Railroad employee is helping a passenger onto a train that is pulling out of a station. Dislodges pack of fireworks in package the passenger is carrying. The fireworks explode, causing scales piled on the platform to fall over, injuring the plaintiff. She sues for negligence.

    - Negligence of the employee (if there is any) consisted of his failure to exercise reasonable care of the package -- it's not foreseeable that a plaintiff all the way down the platform could be. Thus, **unforeseeable plaintiff category**

    - Cardozo/majority doesn't even let jury handle it

      - Seems to say that there was potentially no duty to Palsgraf at all (in this situation? Doesn't make sense to say in all situations)

    - Andrews, dissent: Should have gone to the jury -- injury was potentially remotely foreseeable. Question isn't about duty but proximate cause

- Question -- should it matter whether an injury to a plaintiff was wholly foreseeable/unforeseeable, if the defendant was negligent towards a **different** plaintiff?

  - **SHOULD allow jury to find against unforeseeable plaintiff**

    - Defendant already take an unreasonable risk

    - May encourage plaintiffs to deter risk in general, also towards the foreseeable plaintiff

  - **SHOULD NOT allow jury to find against unforeseeable plaintiff**

    - Too much like imposing injury without fault

    - Can't take risk of harming unforeseeable plaintiff into account

    - Slippery slope

    - Basically just strict liability for negligence

- **Most courts use Cardozo's approach, but they are willing to let foreseeability issue (including time and space considerations) go to the jury**

  - If the jury finds foreseeability, then can hold liable

  - However, seems like if factfinder determines negligent act harmed a wholly unforeseeable plaintiff, can't though

### Unforeseeable extent of harm 

- Cases where **amount** of harm out of proportion to what could be expected (defendant burns down an entire forest after dropping a lit match)

<!-- -->

- **Thin-skill rule**

  - Governs the rights of "foreseeable plaintiffs" who suffer an *[unforeseeable extent of harm]{.underline}*

  - **No defense that plaintiff had an infirmity that caused broader scope of injury**

  - "Take the victim as you find him"

- Justifications

  - *[Administrability]{.underline}*: Lacking the rule, plaintiff in every single case would have to prove that injuries were "foreseeable" and "normal

  - *[Fairness]{.underline}*: Defendant wronged the plaintiff; appropriate that the defendant bears the risk that his negligence will cause more harm than foreseeable

  - *[Desirable kind of strict liability]{.underline}*: Individuals vary enormously in the degree to which they are weak or strong, so defendant who can foresee the risk must know that there is a distribution of severity

    - This promotes optimal deterrence

- Exceptions

  - Whole classes of cases where you don't "take your plaintiff as you find him"

    - Comparative/contributory negligence

    - Obligation to mitigate loss

  - Obligation to mitigate makes sense in that plaintiff in a better position to perform the mitigation

    - Also, plaintiff responsible for the damage

- **In cases where the policies underlying the thin-skull rule are not well-served, tort law seems to find ways to not apply it**

### Unforeseeable type of harm

- Middle ground between "unforeseeable plaintiff," where basically no liability imposed, and "unforeseeable extent," where apply the "thin-skull rule," almost strict liability

- Example: I put a box of explosives on the shelf, negligently placed so easy to knock over. The explosives fall on your foot; don't explode, but break toe. Am I liable?

  - It's an unforeseeable *[type]{.underline}*

  - \[Note that the Restatement (Third) gives an example of this with a shotgun and says clearly no, as long as nothing weird about the shotgun\]

- **Most American courts make the proximate cause determination on a case-by-case basis**

- Likely to take into account a variety of factors

  - Directness of the harm

  - Degree to which it more closely resembles an unforeseeable type than unforeseeable extent of the same type

  - Defendant's negligence caused other damage for which it is already being held liable

- Generally no rule can be confidently stated, except that many cases will go to a jury

### Unforeseeable manner of harm

- Plaintiff foreseeable, injury is foreseeable, type foreseeable, but the injury occurs in a bizarre way

- *Marshall v. Nugent*: defendant's driving forced a car in which the plaintiff was a passenger to run off the road. Plaintiff unharmed, but suffered an injury after he got out and was walking down the road by a third vehicle.

  - This did not preclude liability to the defendant

- **General rule: if the plaintiff, injury, and nature of it is foreseeable, fact that it occurs in a strange way doesn't bar recovery**

## **Remoteness, intervention, enablement**

- Most of the issues that are not directly and immediately resolved by the foreseeability and harm-within-the risk tests fall into one of three categories

  - Harm the plaintiff suffers is *[remote in time or space from the negligent conduct of the defendant]{.underline}*

  - Cases of intervention and enablement, in which one party negligently enables or increases the risk that another party will engage in tortious conduct

  - Cases involving the issue of what must be foreseeable

### Remoteness in Time, Space, and Directness

- "Directness" used to be a measure courts would look to: literally if the harm occurred days later, or halfway around the world or something

- Example: Boat is left unmoored to dock, bumps another boat that sails down the river and destroys a draw bridge two days later

- Remoteness and directness have faded though -- only a minority of courts use today

- **Instead, subsumed as considerations that are relevant under the foreseeability and harm within the risk tests**

  - The closer the defendant's negligence is in time and space to the harm suffered by the plaintiff, and the more direct the connection, the more foreseeable the harm was and the stronger the argument for the proposition that the risk of this very sort of occurrence is a harm within the risk that made the defendant negligent

- So to answer the above example, courts wouldn't ask whether the harm was "direct," but how foreseeable it was

  - Closeness in time and space draw bridge is to the boat, more foreseeable, but those are considerations that go into the foreseeability and harm within the risk tests

  - Aren't dispositive anymore

- Why not use remoteness in time and space

  - Cigarettes: totally foreseeable that they caused cancer, but takes 20 years

  - Fireworks on July 4th: I negligently pack them in New York as manufacturer, they injure people on July 4th in California. Remote in time and space, but foreseeable -- makes sense to hold me accountable

### Intervention and Enablement

- Sometimes subsequent acts by third parties or other forces are the immediate cause of the harm, but the original negligence of the defendant is also a cause in fact of the harm

- Is the first actor relieved of liability because of the acts of the second actor?

  - Used to be that only the "last actor" would be held liable, but that's not really the case anymore

- **Question is how responsible the first actor is for the harm caused by the intentional wrongdoing, negligence, or non-negligent conduct of the second actor**

  - Sometimes framed as whether the first actor owed any duty to the plaintiff

  - Sometimes this duty question also turns on the foreseeability of the plaintiff

- Duty is just duty in the conventional sense -- we've covered this separately. If there is no duty, case dismissed

- **But assuming there is a duty, the intervening act does not necessarily break the "chain" of causation if this intervention is foreseeable**

  - Example: I serve you alcohol at a party. You drive home and hit a pedestrian along the way

    - I'm a social host -- I owe no duty to the pedestrian, case closed

    - I'm a bartender -- I could owe a duty as a matter of public policy

- Sometimes resolved by **rules**

  - Bartender serving drinks, driver who hits plaintiff leading to injuries that lead to malpractice of physician, party who negligently loans a car

  - If no sufficiently foreseeable, will go to jury

- Sometimes second party's act is sufficiently tortious, even criminal, but **foreseeable** enough that chain isn't broken

- Sometimes the subsequent act of the second actor is not **[negligent]{.underline}**

  - Can lead to dismissal...(Leave keys in ignition, thief steals car, but isn't negligent in driving when he hits someone)

  - Unless very foreseeable to make the risk one of the things that makes it negligent (I hit you with my car negligently, you aggravate your injury months later due to subsequent, non-negligent medical)

- This is all doctrinally straightforward, albeit fact-specific

- **General point is that depending on rules, foreseeability, first actor can also be held liable for acts leading to a second actor injuring the plaintiff, regardless of whether or not the second actor is negligent**

  - Plaintiff can then hold two parties liable, not just one

- 

***[Benn v. Thomas]{.underline}*** (Iowa 1994)

- **Facts:** Decedent had a history of coronary disease and insulin-dependent diabetes; defendant rear-ended a car in which he was a passenger. Expert witness for plaintiff testified that this killed him, and estate requested that the jury be instructed based on the "eggshell plaintiff" theory. Jury must "take the plaintiff as he finds him"

  - Trial judge declined to do so, instructed the jury based on "substantial factor"

  - Jury subsequently found that negligence was not a proximate cause of decedent's death, awarded no damages for his death, although \$17K for injury

- **Issue:** Whether jury instructions were improper and should have been based on the "eggshell plaintiff" theory.

- **Holding:** Yes

- **Reasoning**

  - **A tortfeasor whose act, superimposed upon a prior latent condition, results in an injury may be liable in damages for the full disability. The injury, not the dormant condition, is the proximate cause of the plaintiff's harm**

  - Defendant argues that the instructions were improper because it concerns damages, not proximate cause

    - Court says that this is incorrect -- *[eggshell plaintiff concerns proximate cause as well as damages]{.underline}*

  - Jury could have found that the defendant was responsible for the plaintiff's death under the substantial factor theory, but court holds that the instructions failed to adequately convey the existing law that should be applied

  - Substantial medical testimony suggests that the stresses of the accident and subsequent treatment were responsible for his heart attack and death

    - "Intervening factor" + "unforeseeable extent of harm" components

  - To deprive the plaintiff estate of the requested instruction would fail to convey to the jury a central principle of tort liability

***[Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad Co.]{.underline}*** (NY COA 1928)

- **Facts**

  - Plaintiff standing at railroad station, waiting for train. A train comes in, two men attempt to board. Guards help them, but dislodge package, which falls onto the rails and explodes (filled with fireworks). The fireworks knock over scales, which fall onto the plaintiff, injuring her. She sues

- **Issue**

  - Whether LIRR is liable for the plaintiff's injuries.

- **Holding**

  - No.

- **Reasoning**

  - Conduct of the defendant's guard, if a wrong in relation to the holder of the package, was not a wrong in relation to the plaintiff, who was standing far away. Relative to her, not negligence at all

    - Nothing in the situation gave notice that the falling package indicated that it was dangerous

    - **"Negligence is not actionable unless it involves the invasion of a legally protected interest, ie the violation of a right"** (this is negligence the cause of action, not negligence the standard of care)

  - The wrong done here is to the man whose package was knocked out -- this (I guess, Cardozo isn't very clear) is foreseeable, but not the injury to the person far away

  - Risk imports relation: it is risk to another or to others within the range of apprehension

  - But there was nothing here to suggest to the most cautious mind that the parcel wrapped in newspaper would explode

    - If the guard had thrown it down knowingly and willingly, he would not have threatened the plaintiff's safety, so far as he could tell

  - Negligence is a term of relation -- not a tort unless it results in the commission of the wrong, and the wrong imports the violation of a right

    - Bodily security is protected not against all forms of interference, but only against some

    - If the harm wasn't willful, need to show that it would have been foreseeable to a reasonable person

  - Cardozo says, basically, that there was no tort

  - **UNFORESEEABLE PLAINTIFF**

- **Dissent (Andrews)**

  - Question of whether the passenger can recover depends on the theory of negligence

    - Relative concept: breach of duty owing to a particular person or persons

    - Or is the doer liable for all proximate consequences, even where they result in injury to someone who you might think would be outside the radius of danger

  - If adopt the second hypothesis, have to inquire as to the relation between the cause and effect

    - Ie, deal with proximate cause, not negligence

  - **Andrews says that asking about just duty here narrows it too much: where there is an unreasonable act and some right that may be affected there is negligence whether or not there is damage**

    - If someone is driving too quickly down Broadway, negligent whether or not hit someone

    - The act itself is wrongful: wrong not only to those who happen to be in the radius of danger but to everyone who might have been there

  - Negligence doesn't only apply to those who one might "reasonably expect to injure": if you harm someone a mile away, harm the same as to that done to the people on the scene

  - *Polemis*: dropping of a plank negligent because it might injure the workman or cargo or ship (think this is the one where the ship exploded because the plank started a fire in the gunpowder hold)

  - "Every one owes to the world at large the duty of refraining from those acts that may unreasonably threaten the safety of others"

  - Plainitff's claim is to the breach of duty to herself

  - Right to recover damages rests on additional considerations: 1) **plaintiff's rights must be injured**, 2) **injury must be caused by the negligence**

    - If a dam breaks and we put in negligent foundations but the dam breaks because of something else, not liable

    - But when injuries result from the negligent act liable for the consequences: it doesn't matter that they are unusual, unexpected, unforeseen, and unforeseeable

      - **But there is a limitation: the damages must be connected with the negligence such that the negligence can be said to be the [proximate cause]{.underline} of the damage**

  - Proximate cause never given a great definition

    - Can speak of a chain or net, but the analogy isn't very helpful

    - Each cause brings about future events -- each is proximate in a sense that it is essential

    - But this isn't what we're talking about

  - Andrews: when we talk about proximate cause, can't be talking about it in a logical sense (because of the butterfly effect, every cause is sort of 'necessary' in some way for the outcome -- the cause in fact), but from a public policy sense, a sense of justice

  - Proximate cause is a matter of expediency: there are no fixed rules, just simple matters which we may take into account

  - **Proximate cause must be something without which the event would not happen** (ok, this is cause in fact)

  - **Was there a natural, continuous sequence between cause and effect**

    - Was the one a substantial factor in producing the other (Huang doesn't like this)

    - Was there a direct connection between them, without too many intervening cause (we also don't like "direct effect" either)

    - Foreseeable? (Yes!)

    - Is the result too remote from the cause, and here consider remoteness in time and space? (We don't like this)

  - **Question is ultimately about fair judgment**

  - Andrews likes the "directness," the "substantial factor" the guard had in producing the explosion

    - No remoteness in time and space

    - Natural, continuous sequence

  - Under the circumstances cannot say that as a matter of law the plaintiff's injuries were not the proximate result of the negligence

**III. Judge, Jury, and the Underlying Purpose of Proximate Cause**

**A. Judge and jury**

- Many proximate cause cases deal with whether a defendant's negligence was **not a proximate cause of the plaintiff's harm as a matter of law**

  - Ie, the unforeseeable plaintiff and unforeseeable type = not liable **as a matter of law**, can't even go to the jury

- There are very few cases though in which a defendant **IS liable as a matter of law.** Most involve sending to a jury. A few exceptions

  - 1\) Eggshell plaintiff rule

  - 2\) I run a red light, crash into someone: 1) harm within the risk exactly matches up, and 2) per se negligent for violating the a statute

    - Guess the question would be whether negligent for running the light

- **Basic point: occasionally there are decisions holding as a [matter of law]{.underline} on no-proximate-cause or no-breach-of-duty grounds that the plaintiff may not go to trial (*Palsgraf*) or governed by a rule applied as a matter of law (*The Wagon Mound***)

  - But typically the complex proximate cause reasoning that we read in opinions is verbal overkill, just directed at explaining why the issue should go to a jury

**[More from Restatement (Third), about scope of liability:]{.underline}**

- e\. Rationale. Limiting liability to harm arising from the risks created by the tortious conduct has the virtue of relative simplicity. It also provides a more refined analytical standard than a foreseeability standard or an amorphous direct-consequences test. Furthermore, the standard adopted in this Section imposes limits on liability by reference to the reasons for holding an actor liable for tortious conduct in the first place. The risk standard appeals to intuitive notions of fairness and proportionality by limiting liability to harms that result from risks created by the actor\'s wrongful conduct, but for no others. It also provides sufficient flexibility to accommodate fairness concerns raised by the specific facts of a case.

  - **RS3 uses the "risk standard" for liability**

  - **More refined than foreseeability or "direct consequences"**

  - **Appeals to intuitive notions of fairness**

- Critiques of the over- and underbreadth of the risk standard as the limit on scope of liability have been voiced, as has the criticism that the risk standard is indeterminate for a significant class of cases. Nevertheless, the indeterminacy---which might also be characterized as flexibility---in the risk standard can be understood as a virtue that assists in ameliorating the over- and underbreadth criticism. The risk standard can be employed to do justice in a wide range of cases in which the particular facts require careful consideration and thereby resist any rule-like formulation. Yet it does so within an understandable and coherent framework that avoids standardless determinations. Finally, some of the inadequacies of the risk standard are addressed in other Sections and Comments in this Chapter, which identify specific areas in which courts have modified the standard contained in this Section. See Comment m and §§ 31- 33.

- Courts have increasingly moved toward adopting a foreseeability test for scope of liability in negligence cases. Currently, virtually all jurisdictions employ a foreseeability (or risk) standard for some range of scope-of-liability issues in negligence cases. When properly understood and framed, the foreseeability standard is congruent with the risk standard adopted by this Section for negligence cases. At least some courts have employed language that veers closer to the formulation of the risk standard provided in this Section than does a foreseeability test. See Reporters\' Note to Comment d. The risk standard nevertheless is preferable to a foreseeability standard for reasons explained in Comment j. The primary alternative rule to the risk standard for limiting a tortfeasor\'s liability is the direct-consequences test. That rule permits liability to be imposed even for harm that is beyond the scope of the risk in negligence actions, including harm that is unforeseeable. Thus, the direct-consequences test sometimes permits a wider scope of liability. But impose some limitation it must, and the term "direct consequences" provides an even vaguer and more amorphous limit on liability than the risk standard. And, when other than background forces intervene after an actor\'s tortious conduct, the direct-consequences test may produce a much narrower scope of liability than the risk standard, results that most courts reject. See § 34.

  - **Courts have moved towards a foreseeability test for some range of "scope of liability" issues in negligence cases**

  - **RS3 says that when properly understood, foreseeability standard is congruent with the risk standard**

  - **However, the risk standard is preferable (comment j)**

  - **Alternative is the direct-consequences test**

    - **But that permits liability to be imposed even for harm beyond the scope of the risk, and for things that are foreseeable**

    - **So the necessary decision is to limit it, but its limitations are vague and amorphous**

> f\. Relationship with duty limitations. This Chapter is about limits on the liability of an actor whose tortious conduct is a factual cause of harm. There are two primary legal doctrines for limiting liability: duty and scope of liability. Some courts use duty in situations in which other courts would use proximate cause. The classic case of Palsgrafn v. Long Island Railroad Co., revealed the potential for interchangeability between duty and scope of liability, although proximate cause was the term employed at the time. Judge Cardozo employed duty, while Judge Andrews employed proximate cause, to determine whether the defendant was liable for harm to a particular plaintiff. Palsgraf\'s legacy has been a tension in tort law about the proper balance between duty rules and proximate-cause limits to circumscribe appropriately the scope of liability.

- **Two primary legal doctrines for limiting liability**

  - **Duty**

  - **Scope of liability**

- **Cardozo employed duty**

- **Andrews applied scope of liability (although used proximate cause)**

<!-- -->

- One significant difference between these two doctrines is helpful in determining their appropriate spheres of application. Duty is a question of law for the court, see § 7, while scope of liability, although very much an evaluative matter, is treated as a question of fact for the factfinder. Hence, duty is a preferable means for addressing limits on liability when those limitations are clear, when they are based on relatively bright lines, when they are of general application, when they do not usually require resort to disputed facts in a case, when they implicate policy concerns that apply to a class of cases that may not be fully appreciated by a jury deciding a specific case, and when they are employed in cases in which early resolution of liability is particularly desirable. See § 7. Duty is usefully employed when a court seeks to make a telling pronouncement about when actors may or, on the other hand, may not be held liable. Thus, the liability of social hosts for providing alcohol to their guests is best treated as a duty issue, rather than as a matter of scope of liability. On the other hand, when the limits imposed require careful attention to the specific facts of a case, and difficult, often amorphous evaluative judgments for which modest differences in the factual circumstances may change the outcome, scope of liability is a more flexible and preferable device for placing limits on liability. Its use is also consistent with the role of the jury in tort cases.

  - **Duty is useful for bright line decisions about when actors may or may not be held liable**

  - **However, when fact-specific, use is limited, and scope of liability is more flexible and can be tailored to meet the specific facts of the case**

- Consistent with these observations, Chapter 3 of this Restatement recognizes a general duty of reasonable care to avoid causing physical harm and also recognizes that courts have carved out a small number of enclaves of no duty and more limited duties in actions based on negligence. See § 7(b), §§ 47- 48, and Chapter 9. Limitations of liability based on the specific facts of a case---for example, the relationship of the actor\'s tortious conduct to the victim\'s harm or the unusual, wanton, or extraordinary way in which the harm occurred---are matters courts denominate as proximate cause and are addressed as scope-of-liability limits in this Chapter.

  - **RS recognizes a general duty of reasonable care to avoid causing physical harm and also recognizes enclaves no-duty exceptions**

  - **[Limitations of liability based on specific facts of the case are matters courts denominate as proximate cause and are addressed as scope of liability limits]{.underline}**

- One more good reason for preferring scope of liability to duty to deal with the range of problems addressed in this Chapter stems from the fact that most often the scope-of- liability issue does not involve the problem posed in Palsgraf; that is, where the plaintiff was outside the scope of harm. Rather, most cases involve persons within the foreseeable scope of some harm, but who have suffered harm that arose from risks other than those that made the defendant\'s conduct tortious. Although pronouncements of no duty to unforeseeable plaintiffs have some appeal, there is awkwardness in stating that the actor had a duty not to cause a certain range of harm, but had no duty to avoid causing the type of harm that actually occurred. In short, an unforeseeable-plaintiff rule is not very helpful in addressing most scope-of-liability issues.

  - **Most often the scope of liability issue does not involve the problem posed in *Palsgraf*, where the plaintiff was outside the scope of harm**

  - **Awkwardness in stating that the actor had a duty not to cause a range of harm but no duty to avoid causing the type that actually occurred**

  - **The unforeseeable plaintiff rule is not very helpful in addressing most scope of liability issues**

- g\. Decoupling legal cause. The first and Second Restatements of Torts were influenced by causal thinking that has long been repudiated. This Restatement, by contrast, treats factual cause and scope of liability separately for several reasons. The most important is that decoupling the two concepts permits the court and factfinder to focus on the issue that is truly in dispute without having to invoke a doctrine that is not in dispute. Even when both issues are in dispute, clearly differentiating the predominantly historical question of factual cause from the evaluative question of scope of liability makes for a clearer, more focused analysis. Finally, separation enables courts to employ instructions that avoid causal language when explaining scope-of-liability limitations to the jury.

- Thus, common instructions on proximate cause that employ language requiring that the tortious conduct cause the harm in a "natural and continuous sequence," sometimes accompanied with the additional requirement that the causal sequence "be unbroken by any efficient intervening cause," do not reflect the risk standard adopted in this Section. Nor do these instructions reflect the limitations on scope of liability, provided in § 34, when there are intervening causes. Comment d contains an explanation of the scope of liability adopted in this Section, as well as language from which appropriate jury instructions might be crafted that reflect the risk standard.

  - **The "natural and continuous sequence" and "unbroken by any efficient intervening cause" phraseology does not reflect an applicable standard endorsed by the RS**

***[532 Madison Avenue Gourmet Foods, Inc. v. Finlandia Center, Inc.]{.underline}*** (COA NY 2001)

- **Facts**

  - December 1997, section of the south wall of 540 Madison Avenue, a 39 story office tower, partially collapsed and bricks, mortar and other material fell onto Madison Avenue at 55 street

  - New York City officials directed the closure of 15 heavily trafficked blocks as well as adjacent side streets between Fifth and Park Avenues

  - Closure lasted for two weeks, but some businesses remained closed for a longer period

  - Plaintiff operates a 24-hour delicatessen, closed for 5 weeks

    - Allege that shoppers and others unable to gain access

  - Defendants the building owner, ground lessee, and the managing agent

  - Trial court dismissed plaintiff's negligence claims on the grounds that could not establish a duty of care for purely economic loss, and the public nuisance on the ground that the injuries were the same kind as those suffered by everyone in the community

- **Issue**

  - 1\) Landholder's duty in negligence where plaintiff's sole injury is lost income

  - 2\) Viability of claims for public nuisance

- **Holding**

  - Reverse, find for plaintiff

- **Reasoning**

  - Plaintiffs contend that the defendants owe them a duty to keep their premises in reasonably safe conditions and that this duty extends to protection against economic loss even in the absence of personal injury or property damage

    - Common law of torts is about apportioning risks and allocating burden of loss

  - Foreseeability of harm does not define duty

    - Absent a duty running directly to the injured person, there can be no liability in damages, however careless the conduct

    - Restriction necessary to avoid exposing defendants to unlimited liability to an indeterminate class of persons conceivably injured by any negliegence in a defendant's act

  - Cases suggest that only persons with a contractual relationship had cause of action for economic harm -- "circumscribed the ambit of duty to avoid limitless exposure to the potential suits of every tenant in the skyscrapers embodying the urban skyline"

  - Landowner doesn't owe a duty to protect an entire urban neighborhood from purely economic losses

  - Policy line-drawing is to an extent arbitrary because it invariably cuts off liability to people who might foreseeably be plaintiffs

  - **An indeterminate group in the affected areas thus may have provable financial losses directly traceable to the collapses with no satisfactory way geographically to distinguish among them; limiting the scope of the defendant's duty to those who have, as a result, suffered personal injury or property damage affords a principled basis for reasonably apportioning liability**

# **STRICT LIABILITY**

- Abnormally dangerous activities and "vicarious" liability = strict liability

  - First is conceptually important but not frequently the subject of lawsuits

  - However, vicarious liability, which includes liability of employers for the negligence of their employees, is enormously important in practice -- it is the most frequently imposed form of strict liability

  - Both imposed without regard to the negligence of the defendant and therefore referred to as "strict" liability

- Important to recognize at the outset though that these liabilities are strict, but not absolute

  - Liability is imposed in the absence of negligence by the defendant only when a dangerous activity is "abnormally" so, or (with vicarious) only when one party is responsible for the actions of another

  - Key to understanding strict liability = identify the criteria that must be satisfied in order to render an actor strictly liable- ie, liable without regard to negligence

- **Another way of putting it: since strict liability is in effect activity-based, whereas negligence liability is act-based, the critical question is what characterizes the activities for which the negligence requirement is dropped**

**I. Theories of Strict Liability**

- No single statement of the theory underlying strict liability in tort

  - Number of judges and scholars have different theories, some descriptive, which explain the scope of the doctrine as it stands, while others are normative, which address what strict liability **should be**, not what it is right now

  - Many arguments for strict liability even accept the notion that some, or even most, accidental harm should be based on the theory of negligence; contend that in certain contexts, the negligence requirement does not or should not apply, and strict liability should be imposed

  - **The essence of a theory of strict liability is the identification of what advantages are or can be gained by imposing an additional increment of liability -- different theories emphasize different advantages**

**A. Reducing Information and Error Costs**

- Determining whether a party has been negligent is often a highly fact-intensive process

  - Adducing proof of negligence may therefore be economically costly, time-consuming, and sometimes close to impossible

  - Showing how carefully the defendant acted on a particular occasion may involve more cost and time than showing that the defendant was involved in a particular activity for which strict liability is imposed

    - For example: Expert testimony is more likely to be required or permitted to prove [negligence]{.underline} than to prove the defendant's involvement in an activity

    - Similarly, evidence of a compliance with or in violation of a customary practice is admissible because it is relevant to negligence, but is not relevant to strict liability action

  - Imposing strict liability makes all these issues irrelevant: no need to gather evidence necessary to determine at trial how the defendant acted, whether the defendant complied with a custom or violated a statute, or was negligent in some other way

    - NO need to occupy a trial with factual questions: they become shorter or may not even need to occur at all

  - **Reduces litigation costs therefore in classes of cases in which the cost of making the factual findings necessary to resolve issues that negligence makes relevant would otherwise be substantial**

- Because strict liability does not require proof of nelgignce, in general it is likely that there will be more claims when an activity is subject to strict liability than when an activity requires proof of negligence

  - Therefore, although any individual case has much lower administrative costs, in aggregate, the cost may be higher -- ie, courts will have **more** cases, although each case may take less time

- Net effect of the interaction between per case and total costs depends in part on the level of generality at which a strict liability rule is established

  - Per case cost of adjudication under a strict liability rule set at a "high level of generality" is very likely to be lower than the per case cost of adjudication udner a "lower level of generality"

    - Example: Whether an activity is "abnormally dangerous" can be determined in accordance with a per se rule that admits of few exceptions and is almost cost free to apply -- a rule such as "all use of explosives is abnormally dangerous and results in strict liability"

      - This is a rule set at a very high level of generality

    - However, if set strict liability at a lower level of generality, say by making strict liability contingent on the usefulness of the explosives to the community or how common they are, this context-dependent rule will result in case-by-case adjudication that is likely to be more expensive and complicated than litigation resulting a higher level of generality

      - So arguably, here you're just litigating whether strict liability applies at all, rather than litigating the negligence -- not really saving information and error costs at all

- Because negligence is potentially more fact-intensive, there is a greater risk of error in making the negligence determination than in determining whether the facts necessary to support strict lability have been proved

  - In strict liability, as we will see, there may be a need only to determine whether the defendant used explosives, or whether the bodies of water ate common in the area under which a reservoir burst

  - These factual determinations tend to be subject to less error; in contrast with negligence, depends on how carefully the defendant acted

  - Such questions are probably more prone to error in fact-finding

- **However, strict liability doesn't necessarily make adjudication more accurate if your goal is to impose liability only for negligence**

  - For example: say that in a class of cases involving an activity, A, juries impose liability 40% of the time, when in fact defendants are negligent 60% of the time -- so 20% under-imposition of liability

    - If we switched to a strict liability regime, defendants would have liability imposed 100% of the time -- but this regime is actually less accurate, if the goal is to only penalize negligent actors. Off by 40%

  - Alternative example: class of cases involving activity B, juries impose liability 10% of the time when defendants are in fact negligent 60% of the time

    - So by imposing strict liability, we reduce error from 50% to 40%.

  - Strict liability is more effectitive with the Class B rather than Class A cases; these are the class of cases in which evidence of negligence is either not available or very difficult to obtain -- perhaps because the kinds of accidents that characterize these cases tend to destroy the relevant evidence, **but in which defendants are in fact often negligent**

    - Court sometimes find the transportation of highly flammable material that is likely to destroy evidence of negligence when it explodes to fall into this category

## **Influencing the Activity Level and Research Decisions**

- One's initial inclination is to suppose that imposing strict liability will promote safety and therefore accident reduction beyond d what negligence liability alone can achieve

  - Ie, strict liability threatens potential injurers with liability for a greater range of activities and therefore ought to generate more deterrence

- However, as a general matter, this is unlikely to be true: assuming that negligence liability is accurately imposed (not always true), strict liability will not cause any activity to be conducted with greater safety. Potential rational negligent actors already weigh costs and benefits of conducting an activity in a more safe manner under a negligence regime

  - **What strict liability regime does is force consideration of reducing the type of activity altogether, or switching to a safer version of it: by charging for non-negligent accidents, force actors to internalize all the costs of the injuries they produce**

- As a consequence, strict liability may create greater research incentives because under strict liability there is more to be gained by avoiding liability

  - Tough to generalize about this, as it kinda depends on the activity -- some lend themselves to greater payoff than others

  - While it is generally true that imposing strict liability can create greater research incentives than negligence alone, it will not necessarily produce additional research in any given situation

- Reader might suppose that on this score strict liability is categorically preferable to negligence. However, this is problematic for two reasons

  - 1\) May be activities for which there are no readily available or discoverable substitutes

    - Imposing strict liability for injuries caused by these activities could result in more disadvantages than advantages

  - 2\) In a sense there is always strict liability and there are always activity-level effects

    - Underlying inquiry is not whether defendants should be strictly liable or only liable for negligence

    - **The question is rather who should bear strict liability: potential injurers or potential victims**

    - The question, then, is whether there should be injurer strict liability of injurer negligence liability plus victim liability

      - In some cases, depending on a host of factors, including the parties' knowledge of and control over alternatives, it may be better to have victim liability for non-negligently caused injuries

        - Frequently true when victims have more control over their safety by influencing **their** activity levels than defendants

    - Little or no need for strict liability on the part of etiher potential injurers or victims when the exercise of reasonable care, coupled with the defense of contributory or comparative negligence, is sufficient to limit the risk of most accidents

      - For example: virtually all automobile accidents are caused by negligence, so imposing liability based on it will create sufficient incentives for accident reduction

  - **\[3) I'd add 3 -- sometimes we don't want to reduce the activity because it is socially beneficial despite the injuries it's causing!\]**

## **Promoting Insurance or Broad Distribution of Losses**

- A third argument for strict liability rests on loss-distributional rather than cost-reduction or incentive creating considerations

  - We saw above that in a sense there is always either injurer strict liability or victim strict "liability" for the costs of non-negligently caused accidents

  - Strict liability might be imposed because a **particular category of injurers, rather than a particular category of victims, is in the best position to insure** or otherwise broadly distribute the costs of non-negligently caused accidents

- If a particular category of injurers is likely in general to be better insurers of these costs, than its superiority in this respect is an argument for imposing strict liability on them

  - For example, blasters may be better-suited to purchase liability insurance, or to raise the cost of their services, than potential blasting victims are to purchase additional health and disability insurance

- On the other hand, if particular categories of victims are likely to be superior insurers, than that is an argument against strict liability

  - Capacity to insure depends on the nature and probability of the risks posed by an activity

- In general, injurers are more likely than victims to be large institutions that can spread the cost of liability directly in their prices or services, or to purchase liability insurance whose cost is included in these services

  - In automobile liability, the one major area in which injurers are predominately ordinary individuals, access to liability insurance, with the broad loss distribution that such access entails, is virtually automatic

  - Even in the domain of loss distribution, however, injurers are not necessarily always superior to victims as loss bearers

  - For example, consider health care costs resulting for a tort: nearly 90% of the US population is insured by some form of public or private insurance (doesn't always cover every expense, but does provide substantial protection)

    - The cost of healthcare is the vast majority of the injury victim's losses is already spread in broad channels -- so the fight, in say, an auto accident, is whose insurance provider is going to pay for the injury

## **Satisfying Rights-Based Norms of Responsibility**

- The last group of arguments for strict liability is not instrumental, but rights-based

- Turns on existence of some norm of responsibility for the harm-causing conduct

- **1) Benefit theory**

  - **Those who benefit from engaging in an activity should bear the costs associated with that activity**

  - Extra costs that strict liability places on injurers burdens them less than what results when victims must bear the costs

  - This leads its proponents to support strict liability on the ground that the owners, employees, and customers of enterprises benefit from their activities and should pay for the injuries that enterprises cause

- **2) Reciprocity theory**

  - **Strict liability should be imposed when an activity poses risks for potential victims that the victims do not also pose for others**

  - When the defendant creates a disproportionate, excessive risk of harm relative to the victim's risk-creating activity, strict liability should be imposed

  - Thus, when two airplanes collide, they should be liable to each other only for negligence. But when an airplane causes injury to those on the ground, it should be strictly liable

- **3) Liability should be imposed when the injurer acts in a manner that causes the invasion of the liberty of others**

  - This is a causal theory, under which strict liability should be imposed, but only when an actor causes harm trough the use of force, by some form of compulsion, or by creating a dangerous condition

**II. Strict Liability**

**The Rise of Liability for Ultrahazardous Activities**

- Aside from some pre-existing rules governing liability for escaping animals, modern development of strict liability begins with *Rylands v. Fletcher* -- defendant in *Rylands* had a reservoir constructed at a point on his property that he did not know lay above, or at least was contiguous with, a former coal mine

  - Water in the reservoir escaped through the mine, flooding the plaintiff's property

  - Plaintiff could not show any negligence for which the defendant was responsible, although conceivable the contractors whom the defendant hired to construct the reservoir were negligent

  - Case went to trial and was appealed through several layers of appellate courts

  - Ultimately the House of Lords held that was strictly liable

- *Rylands* was decided against the backdrop late nineteenth century rule that there was liability only upon proof that the defendant was negligent. Consequently, the key question in the case is under what circumstances an exception can be made

  - Court purported to answer by holding that there would be strict liability for damage caused by what is called "non-natural use' of the defendant's land -- what exactly the court meant is not entirely clear

  - At the extreme, this might mean that the escape of anything brought onto the land that was not "naturally there" would result in liability

  - However, a more nuanced conception of it might be that any use of a particular piece of land had to be conducted on that site because of its essential character as "natural" (ie, minerals could only be removed at that site)

  - Some American courts thought that the *Rylands* exception was extreme and that it did swallow up the liability-only-for-negligence rule, and took the case as rejecting much of negligence law, rejecting *Rylands*

- But other courts adopted *Rylands* and in a few decades they predominated; over time, this created an intermediate view of the scope of strict liability

  - Courts here began to create a series of specific and at first limited exceptions to the general rule that there was no liability in the absence of negligence

  - In the beginning, this applied to the most dangerous and unusual activities, like the use of explosives, but exceptions expanded to include the operation of oil wells and storage of unusual quantities of water

  - Many American courts recognized the traditional strict liability of owners of domesticated livestock for damage to land on which animals intruded

  - **Note that the decision of whether to include an activity in a strict liability category came to be one for the [court, not the jury]{.underline}**

- **US courts called the doctrine under which strict liability was imposed, at first, "absolute nuisance," but this eventually switched to *[ultra hazardous activities]{.underline}*. Two factors determined:**

  - **1) Degree of danger posed (probably more important)**

    - The more dangerous an activity is, the more violent it is likely to be, and therefore the more likely it is to destroy evidence that would enable the plaintiff to prove that the defendant conducted the activity negligently

  - **2) How common activity was in the area**

    - The more uncommon an activity is in a particular area, the more likely it is that the activity level and research incentives created by the threat of strict liability will be most effective operating on potential injurers rather than on potential victims

  - These two factors mesh well with our discussion earlier of the theories of strict liability: remember that in important respects the choice is not between strict liability and no liability, but between nuisance liability and liability for victims for non-nuisance injuries

- Second point, regarding common-ness of the activity, true for several reasons

  - 1\) To the extent that an activity is uncommon, those who are its potential victims are less likely to be able to protect themselves from it

  - 2\) In addition, land uses tend to involve capital investments and therefore to be comparatively costly to alter

  - 3\) Potential victims of an uncommon land use tend to already be engaged in common uses when the injurer makes the decision whether the engage in an uncommon use

    - If you are already operating a coal mine, cannot pick up and go elsewhere

    - Therefore, the injurer is likely to be in a better position to establish optimal activity levels at the outset, when the cost of doing so is lowest, because this does not involve the sacrifice of already made investments

  - 4\) In contrast, if an activity is neither especially dangerous nor uncommon, potential injurers probably are not superior to potential victims in their ability to control the risk of injury through activity-level adjustments or research

    - In fact, sometimes the potential victims are also potential injurers because they too engage in the activity

    - SO these are unlikely to be considered ultrahazardous

- In short, strict liability for engaging in ultrahazardous activities is like common law zoning, designed to encourage similar land uses in a particular area and to impose the cost of engaging in a dangerous and uncommon use on the party who decides not to comply with the zoning implications of the liability rule

## **The Modern Conception: Strict Liability for "Abnormally Dangerous Activities"**

- New test for strict liability came about by the 1960s: more nuanced. Termed "**strict liability for abnormally dangerous activities**"

  - **1) Dangerousness**

    - 1\) Degree of risk

    - 2\) Probability of harm

    - 3\) Inability to eliminate the risk by the exercise of reasonable care

  - **2) Uncommon nature**

    - 1\) Extent to which the activity is uncommon

    - 2\) Inappropriateness to the area

  - **3) Extent to which the value of the activity is outweighed by its dangerousness**

- Modern test meshed with the theory of strict liability in roughly the same way as did the earlier test

  - Except that the last factor occasionally served to trump the others, saving negligence liability for the rare activity that warranted protection from the regime even though it was dangerous and unusual

- **New test reflected the tendency of the courts to engage in case-by-case analysis of strict liability claims and encouraged this practice**

  - [Advantage]{.underline} was that it had the capacity to draw fine distinctions between activities in light of the weight of the six factors that comprised the test

  - [Disadvantage]{.underline}: fine tuning the test through reference to a bunch of different factors pushes decisinomaking to a lower level of generality, and in doing so loses some of the benefits of ease of administrability, reduced costs of litigation

    - Ie, if can endlessly litigate whether something is classified as "strict liability," not really advantageous to a negligence regime

- However, third factor has become the least important

- *[Indiana Harbor Belt RR Co v. American Cyanamid Co.]{.underline}*: defendant manufacturer that had shipped 20,000 gallons of toxic and flammable chemical in a leased railroad tank car

  - Plaintiff company in the business of switching cars from one railroad line to another

  - Car leaked while in a railroad yard at which it was supposed to be switched

  - Consequence, plaintiff forced to undertake decontamination, other measures to prevent injury, including evacuating homes

  - **Held:** Court declined to impose strict liability, focusing on two considerations

    - 1\) Probability that the leak could have been prevented through exercise of reasonable care in the inspection and maintenance of the tank car

      - Court distinguished cases holding transporters og gasoline strictly liable for explosion, on the ground that explosions destroy evidence of negligence, while leaks don't

    - 2\) Impossibility of strict liability having an activity level effect in this kind of case

      - How to route rail-transported material away from the metropolitan areas that serve as railway hubs?

  <!-- -->

  - **Court's reasoning may be correct on the merits, but note that didn't ask whether the transportation of the material was abnormally dangerous -- this is pretty low level of generality**

    - Rather, questions considered were

      - 1\) Whether strict liability when particular means of escape of such material from the railroad tank car could ordinarily be prevented through reasonable care, and

      - 2\) Whether the adoption of particular alternative routes of railroad transportation would result from the imposition of strict liability

    - Fact-intensive questions, context dependent

    - Decision in *Indiana Harbor Belt* provides incomplete guidance at best as to the proper result when this next accident happens

- **Third Restatement makes a partial return to the First Restatement: two black-letter requirements**

  - 1\) Whether an activity poses a foreseeable and highly significant risk of harm

  - 2\) Whether the activity is a matter of common usage

  - **Comments:** Suggest that aside from whether the activity has value to the community (NO LONGER INCLUDED), same factors that were considered by the Second are still taken into account, because they influence whether the two requirements were met

## **Scope of Liability and Defenses**

- Rules governing the scope of strict liability and defenses to traditional strict liability confirm what this form of liability is all about: strict liability only for the kind of harm whose risk makes the activity abnormally dangerous -- for the risks that are characteristic of the activity

  - **This is a complicated way of saying that there is only strict liability if engaging in the relevant activity is not only the cause in fact, but also the proximate cause of the harm the plaintiff suffered**

  - This wouldn't be a big deal, except that *[the whole point of proximate cause is to ensure that a defendant is held liable only for those consequences of his acts which the law wishes to be actionable]{.underline}*.

  - So **strict liability is not absolute liability for engaging in an activity, but only for those consequences that the liability is designed to address**

  - Example: *Madsen v. East Jordan Irrigation*: Plaintiff's mother mink ate their young after being frightened by blasting

    - Defendant was not held to be strictly liable because the possibility that this would occur is not one of the secondary risks imposed for blasting

    - One way of understanding this is that the risk that the mother mink will eat the young is not foreseeable

    - But a second way to view the decision is to say that the purposes of strict liability are best served by holding the plaintiff strictly liable because the risk is more foreseeable to mink owners and much more controllable

    - Mink owners are better positioned to make activity-level and research calculations that strict liability imposes

- Strict liability had established early one that the defendant is not liable for harm in question if it results from acts of God, unforeseeable intervention of a third party, or from the plaintiff's knowing and unreasonable assumption of risk

  - Say, vandalism, floods, etc

  - In these situations, purpose behind strict liability -- creating incentives beyond those flowing from the harm itself- not easily served

  - Cause of the harm is not really foreseeable

  - Because the cost saving available to the defendant from adjusting its activity levels in anticipation of this is speculative, not much to be gained

**Duck Story on CNN:** Owner of a domestic animal is \"strictly liable\" for the harm caused by the animal as a result of its abnormally dangerous characteristics only if the person knows or has reason to know it is abnormally dangerous. Wild animals don't get same treatment, or the "one bite" rule -- assume dangerous

***[Doerr v. Goldsmith]{.underline}*** (NY 2013)

- **Facts:** Plaintiff riding bike in Central Park loop road, defendants playing with dog. Dog unrestrained, runs around or something and defendant can't avoid crashing into it after yelling at them to watch out

- **Issue:** Whether defendant has negligence claim against the animal's owner

- **Holding:** Court denies motion for summary judgment

- **Reasoning**

  - New York law until very recently would not allow claims for negligence against an animal's owner unless the plaintiff could demonstrate that the owner was aware of its "propensity for viciousness"

    - See: *Bard v. Jahnke*: Plaintiff doing carpentry work in a dairy barn injured when bull charged. Court holds no negligence; defendant permitted to let a breeding bull wander around freely and breed with cows that had not been impregnated via artificial insemination

    - See: *Petrone*: Rottweiler charges mail carrier, mail carrier injured while running away, court doesn't allow negligence claim

  - Because of this, court says impossible, basically, for people injured by animals to recover if they could not establish defendants'' knowledge of viciousness, even fi the injury not caused by "vicious" behavior

  - Recently, CoA revisited *Bard* and *Petrone* when it decided an appeal of case where car struck a cow that had wandered into the road. CoA reversed grant of summary judgment and said that an accident caused by animal's "threatening or aggressive behavior is distinct from on caused by the owner's negligence in permitting the animal from wandering off the property"

  - **Court denies summary judgment: this case is about actions of person that turned an animal into an instrumentality of harm**

    - Dog was in control of the defendants prior to accident; had Smith not called the dog and Goldsmith not let it go, plaintiff wouldn't have been injured

    - Defendants are like people throwing ball back and forth across a road, ignoring who may be hurt

***[Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad Co. v. American Cyanamid Co.]{.underline}*** (7th Cir. 1990) POSNER

- **Facts:** Cyanamid loaded 20,000 gallons of liquid \[dangerous chemical\] into a railroad tank car, sent it to railroad yard of Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad, the plaintiff

  - Car arrived, and employees at the yard noticed that fluid was coming from the bottom of the car, as the lid of the outlet was open

  - Local authorities evacuated homes, as chemical is flammable at 30 degrees, highly toxic, potentially carcinogenic

  - Plainitff was forced to take decontamination measures that cost it almost \$1 million, which it is trying to recover from American Cyanamid

- **Issue:** Whether the shipper of the hazardous chemicals by rail should be strictly liable.

- **Holding:**

- **Reasoning**

  - Issue of whether the rail company should be subject to strict liability, as would be recommended by RS2 of Torts is a question of law

  - Section 520 sets forth six factors to be considered in deciding whether an activity is abnormally dangerous and the actor is strictly liable

  - Court points to *[Guille]{.underline}*: Balloonist lands in vegetable garden in New York, crowd tramples the vegetables seeking to rescue him; owner of the garden seeks damages from the balloonist and wins. However, balloonist was not reckless. Posner says this is paradigmatic for strict liability:

    - **A) Risk of harm was great**

    - **B) Harm that would ensue if the risk materialized could be great**

    - **C) Accidents could not be prevented by exercise of due care, as ballooning technology insufficiently developed**

    - **D) Activity was not a matter of common usage, so no presumption that it was a highly valuable activity**

    - **E) The activity was inappropriate to the place in which it took (New York City) -- super crowded**

    - **F) Value to community of recreational activity not sufficiently great to offset the risks**

  - Posner contrasts automobiles, in which the activity is common place, the hazards are not perceived to be as great, and it is unlikely that there is technology available to minimize them, with explosives, in which the opposite is true

    - Former, imposition of a strict liability regime gives incentive to experiment with methods of preventing accidents that include changing, reducing, or relocating the activity itself, rather than trying to just trying to reduce negligent actions themselves

    - Latter, does not occur

  - Posner says that the district court's opinion suggested that potentially all 125 of the most dangerous chemicals shipped in highest volume could be implicated

    - One might want to distinguish between the shipper who places the goods on the dock and the shipper who participates actively in the transportation

  - Issue here could have been resolved with greater care, which suggests that a negligence regime could be sufficient to resolve the issue

  - Record suggests that if a tank car is properly maintained the danger of a spill of acrylonitrile is negligible

  - Railroad networks suggest that impossible to explore alternative routes through non-metropolitan areas

    - Carriers better-positioned to reroute than shippers -- ie, the defendant, who manufactured the stuff, is not well-suited to handle this

    - Also, if ship more indirectly, this increases the risk of the accident are reduced

  - Easy to see how the accident might have been prevented by greater care at reasonable cost, but not how it might have been done by alternative transportation

  - **Ultrahazardousness and abnormal dangerousness is, in the contemplation of the law, a property not of substances but of activities: the manufacturer of a dangerous product is not considered to be engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity merely because the product becomes dangerous when it is handled or used in some way after it leaves his premises**

- **Note 1: Acts vs. activities?**

  - Restatement frames as "activities" vs acts, as in negligence. Why? Does each activity - the manufacture, transport, and storage of dangerous chemicals -- have the same characteristics that are relevant for purposes of strict liability

- **Note 2: Activity-level justification for strict liability**

  - Posner's opinion focuses on how to assess the reasonableness of activity-level type decisions, like when, where and how much acrylonitrile to produce and ship be rail, rather than the question of whether it had maintained an operated the tank car correctly

  - The former can overwhelm judicial resources, and so courts frequently shy away from tackling the issue, which leaves manufacturers free to do act without the chck of tort liability

  - Strict liability can remedy the problem -- by making the actor strictly liable, give an incentive missing in a negligence regime to experiment with methods of preventing accidents that involve not greater exertions of care, assumed to be futile, but relocating, changing, or reducing the activity

- **Note 4: Comparing the Restatements**

  - Restatement 1

    - Ultrahazardous, not "abnormally dangerous," and frames liability as a rule instead of standard. Strict liability imposed when:

      - 1\) Activity necessarily involves a risk of serious harm to the person, land or chattels of others which cannot be eliminated by the exercise of utmost care

      - 2\) Not a matter of common usage

  - Restatement 3

    - Reverts to the first Restatement's two-element test, but it retains the abnormally dangerous language from the Second

    - Observes that two omitted factors in the Second Restatement, locational appropriateness and value to community, may have some bearing on the two requirements retained for strict liability

      - Location may affect the magnitude of the risk

      - Socially valuable activities may be in more common usage

## **Strict liability and contributory negligence**

- Contributory negligence is a defense to strict liability in some jurisdictions and not in others

- Availability of the defense also sometimes varies depending on the type of liability action at issue -- how should the adoption of comparative negligence affect strict liability actions if the statute itself does not address it?

  - The most straightforward approach is simply to apply comparative negligence wherever contributory negligence previously applied

- **But it could be argued that contributory negligence ought to continue to be a complete defense to a strict liability claim wherever it was a complete defense prior to the adoption of comparative negligence, because the plaintiff is clearly more negligent than the defendant, who is held liable without fault**

- **Fairly persuasive response to this is that when a defendant is held strictly liable it is not found to be free from negligence, but the issue is simply irrelevant**

  - It is possible that the defendant was negligent, and therefore possible to compare that negligence with the negligence of the plaintiff

- In some strict liability situations, however, contributory negligence is not a defense: Should comparative negligence be applied?

  - Depends on the reason it's not a defense

  - If the point was that the defendant in the kinds of cases that are subject to strict liability is the best bearer of the risk that the kinds of accidents in question will occur, then that does not change with the enactment of comparative negligence

  - But if contributory negligence was not a defense because it was viewed as excessively harsh, then a comparative negligence defense to strict liability might make sense

    - For example: in cases involving strict liability for abnormally dangerous activiites comparative negligence should not be a defense for this, but that in strict products liability actions comparative negligence should be a defense

- **Final problem: how comparative negligence can operate if the defendant was not in fact at fault but strictly liable**

  - What is the jury to compare with the plaintiff's negligence?

  - Compare with the way he should have behaved -- maybe if 2x as negligence as should have been, reduce award by half

  - But that's not really how it works

  - Supreme Court of California just said that "the jury should do what's equitable"

# **PROPERTY TORTS**

## **Intentional Trespass to Land**

- Common law: invasion of another person's land. Strict liability

  - Requires **intent**. Not to trespass, but just to be **on that piece of land** -- ie if you're carried onto it against your will, not trespass.

    - But if you mistakenly walk onto someone's land without his permission, that is trespass, regardless of whether or not you knew it was owned by someone else

  - Merrill: **Trespass test = 1) invasion, ie physical displacement of possession, and 2) D caused it** (strict liability)

  - **Nuisance test = 1) interference with use and enjoyment of land, 2) substantial harm, and 3) interference was "unreasonable"**

- ***[Martin v. Reynolds Metals Co.]{.underline}*** (Oregon 1959)

  - **Facts:** Plaintiff sues for trespass, claiming damage to the farmland from nearby aluminum reduction plant.

    - Livestock were being poisoned by the fluoride that became airborne from the plant and settled on the plaintiff's land

    - Defendant claims that this is nuisance, not trespass

      - Statute of limitations for **trespass** is 6 years but for nuisance, 2 years

      - Trespass is a strict liability tort, while nuisance requires 1) interference with use and enjoyment of land, 2) substantial harm, and 3) interference was "unreasonable"

  - **Issue:** Whether fluoride seeping into land = trespass or nuisance?

  - **Holding:** This is a trespass; contra traditional property law, should look to the character of the instrumentality which is used in making an intrusion upon another's land, focusing on the "energy or force" rather than size

    - Merrill would be mad -- this is endorsing the E=MC2 theory

  - **Reasoning**

    - Trespass can result from a bunch of small particles piling up on possessor's land

    - Liability under trespass has been recognized where there was harm produced by the "vibration of the soil" -- so while before people focused on "direct" invasion, can say now that in the atomic age, even atoms can be trespassory

    - If going to look to the instrumentality of the trespass, focus on the "energy or force" rather than size

      - This seems like a "harm" argument

    - Historically, trespass does not require damages -- arises from dispossession of the land

      - About vindicating the right or interest in the property

    - **Court says that possessor's interest in land as defined by the considerations above may be violated by a ray of light, an atomic particle, or by a particulate of fluoride**

      - Defendant's conduct in causing chemical substances to be deposited fulfill all requirement

    - Defendant says that injury was indirect and consequential and injury must be direct and intermediate to be trespass

      - **Court says that deposit of particles is direct; so is this intrusion**

    - Court says that it doesn't matter whether or not the plant operators could not do more to prevent the fluoride leakage; trespass is strict liability and there is no negligence requirement here

  - **Note 1: Culpability and intent**

    - Trespass doesn't require that the defendant knew; good faith is irrelevant

    - Strictness of liability limited to some extent by privileges like consent of the possessor or purpose for which entering the land

      - Scope is usually quite limited

**V. The Property Torts**

**A. The Nature of the Torts**

- Four torts concerned with intentional injury to property: trespass to land, trespass to personal property (chattels), conversion, and nuisance

  - **Trespass to land:** P must show 1) invasion and 2) D caused it (strict liability crime)

  - **Trespass to personal property/chattels:** No taking of personal property, but defendant interfered with it or injured. MUST BE HARM

  - **Conversion:** Action for *[loss]{.underline}* of personal property. Something is [taken]{.underline} from you

  - **Nuisance:** 1) interference with use and enjoyment of land, 2) substantial harm, and 3) interference was "unreasonable"

- Property rights aren't solely monetary issues -- also about personal rights ("right to exclude")

  - Interference with rights of possession and ownership is likely to engender anger, etc

  - So there's something more than simple economics of ownership going on -- if I take your cat, we all have a gut sense that I should have to pay for more than just a replacement

## **Necessity**

- In some sense, all defenses are based on necessity of some sort

- But it's a technical term too, reserved for **those cases in which the defendant has acted reasonably in damaging or destroying the plaintiff's property in order to avoid harm to himself or his property, but plaintiff didn't create the risk**

  - Self-defense, defense of others, or defense of property all about the **plaintiff** causing harm

<!-- -->

- Two types of necessity

  - **Public necessity:** There is a risk to property of sufficiently large number of people to make the risk public and it can be reduced or eliminated by damaging or destroying the property

    - *[Complete defense to liability]{.underline}*: defendant has right to make use without incurring liability

    - Plainitff does not have the right to prevent

  - **Private necessity:** Risk to one party only, and it can reduce or eliminate the risk by damaging or destroying the property

    - *[Qualified or conditional defense]{.underline}*: defendant is liable for the damage done to the property

- ***[Ploof]{.underline}* and *[Vincent]{.underline}***

  - ***[Ploof v. Putnam]{.underline}***: Plaintiffs sailing, sudden storm hits, and plaintiffs tie up on the dock. The defendant unties them and the ship is destroyed and plaintiffs are injured

    - Defendant argues that he was protecting his private property

    - Court says that the plaintiffs had **a privilege of necessity** that entitled them to use the dock, and the defendant had **no right to exclude** them from it

    - Untying the ship might have even been a trespass on the plaintiffs

    - Private necessity afforded the plaintiff a limited interest in the dock, which the defendant interfered with

    - Three ways to think about the necessity doctrine:

      - Conditions of necessity *[shift the right to exclude from the landowner to the person entering]{.underline}* under conditions of necessity

      - Landowner **still has the right to exclude**, but under conditions of necessity can **only vindicate that right by seeking payment** for any damage caused by the intruder

      - **Necessity defense negates any liability in tort for trespass**, and the **damages are a form of restitution for unjust enrichment** of the intruder

  - ***[Vincent v. Lake Erie Transportation Co.]{.underline}***: Defendant's ship had been unloading at the plaintiff's dock when a storm arose. By the time it was complete, would have been dangerous to leave. \$500 damage to the dock

    - Plaintiff sues for damages to the dock caused by the ship banging against it during the storm

    - Defendants argued that it would have been negligent to leave the dock, so they shouldn't be liable

    - **Court holds that defendants had a conditional privilege to use the dock -- and although they had done nothing wrong, liable for damages to the ship**

      - NOT finding of negligence -- says exercised good judgment

      - **Ordinary rules of human property rights were suspended by forces beyond human control**

      - But having preserved the ship at some expense to the dock, responsible to the owners to the extent of the injury inflicted

      - Compares to s tarving man

- **Why do we have a qualified defense for private necessity?**

  - Why not just have the dock owner bear the cost for damage

  - **Property rights explanation**

    - Between two innocent parties, the person whom nature put at risk should bear cost of saving himself or the property, rather than the owner of the property

    - CS explanation: ship owner took possession of the property and should be responsible for any liability incurred in the process, regardless of moral fault

  - **Deterrence/resource allocation -- how to rationalize *[Ploof]{.underline}* and *[Vincent]{.underline}***

    - Knowledge: who is better positioned to know the best way to prevent damage to the dock?

      - If it's the dock owner, gives incentive to make a studier dock

    - Perverse incentives: But if dock owner bears all liability, then the ship owner has no incentive to take precautions to avoid injury to the dock at all, even if the net liability is greater if he stays docked

      - If we assume that the ship owner, in a storm already has Private Necessity Right to choose to stay docked, then economically rational thing to do is to always dock

      - If dock owners always bear SL, incentive is to act like the owner in *[Ploof]{.underline}* and never let dock, because going to bear liability no matter what

      - **Cheapest cost avoider theory: Guido Calabresi -- want to impose liability on the person in the best position to compare the risk to the dock to the risk to the ship**

  - **Coase theorem**

    - How much does it really matter? Can always bargain up front -- in the absence of transaction costs, liability rules don't matter

    - However, reality is that not always going to have a contract in advance -- it's important to 1) set the parameters for what the bargain around, and 2) determine liability in cases where there is no contract

- **Why is there absolute privilege in cases of public necessity?**

  - 1\) In the vast majority of cases, the property would have been destroyed anyway

    - So plaintiff hasn't really lost anything

  - 2\) When the rule emerged, there would be no way to hold appropriate parties liable

    - Towns and municipalities did not exist as legal entities

    - Individuals who acted to destroy property shouldn't bear all liability

      - But is it any more fair to force the person whose property was destroyed to bear [strict]{.underline} liability?

## **Coase Theorem**

- "In a world with no transaction costs, the market will reach efficient outcomes regardless of how liability is assigned"

- Example: Reading Railroad has a line going past Farmer Bob's farm. Sparks sometimes fly off the tracks as it passes, starting small fires and damaging Farmer Bob's crops (say \$100). Assume there is a spark arrestor that costs \$50 that will solve this problem permanently. Bob sues for \$100 in damages.

  - **Bob wins, Reading Railroad owes \$100:** Reading Railroad owes \$100, but realizes that it can solve this problem in the future by buying a spark arrestor

  - **Reading Railroad wins, no liability:** Bob pays Reading Railroad \$50 (plus some nominal incentive amount) to install the spark arrestor on the train

  - **So regardless of the outcome of the suit, we get the efficient outcome. \[I guess I'd point out that initially, the entitlement matters a lot. Who pays whom to solve the problem, right?\]**

- That said, we live in a world of transaction costs.

  - Another way of looking at this is in a world with low transaction costs, frequently liability is irrelevant in the long-run -- people will contract around the issue

  - However, in a world of high transaction costs, allocating the entitlement does matter, and there are more and less efficient outcomes

  - **So Calabresi says that there are situations when Property Rules (injunctions) are better, when transaction costs are low and people are willing to bargain, and others where Liability Rules (court-imposed damages) are better, when people can't bargain**

    - Merrill: Prefers property rules in most if not all situations, says that ex ante benefits allow future bargaining, while liability confuses things

      - Liability seems to endorse "take and pay"

      - Even it situations where you might think bargaining impossible, like class action with pollution, gives *Boomer* example where if we just 1) imposed injunction, company would probably just buy the land, or 2) periodic damages, force them to fix the issue

      - "Permanent damages" seem really stupid

## **Private nuisance**

- Private nuisance is for conduct that is **an invasion of another's interest in the private use and enjoyment of land that is a) intentional and unreasonable, or b) unintentional and arising out of negligence or reckless conduct or abnormally dangerous conditions or activities** (strict liability, talked about this)

**Intentional invasion** satisfies "[unreasonableness]{.underline}" requirement if

- **a) gravity of harm** outweighs **the utility of the actors conduct,**

  - **R2T §826: Gravity of the harm factors**

    - Extent of the harm involved

    - Character of the harm

    - Social value that the law attaches to the type of use or enjoyment invaded

    - Suitability of the particular use or enjoyment invaded

    - The burden on the person harmed of avoiding it

  - **R2T §828: utility of the conduct**, consider

    - Social value that the law attaches to the primary purpose

    - Suitability of conduct to the character of the locality

    - Impracticality of preventing or avoiding the invasion

  - **R2T §829(a):** Gravity of harm outweighs whenever harm involved is both substantial and greater than the plaintiff should have to bear

- or b) **the harm caused by the conduct is serious** and the financial burden of compensating for this and similar harm to others would not make the continuation of the conduct infeasible

  - **R2T §826(b):** harm is serious and defendant could afford to compensate the plaintiff and others while continuing to do it

  - *[This is basically strict liability]{.underline}* -- it's reasonable, but you still need to pay

***[Boomer v. Atlantic]{.underline}*** (NY 1970)

- **Facts:** Cement plant being operated in NY area. Air pollution, dirt, smoke

- **Issue:** Plaintiffs seeking damages and injunctive relief

- **Holding:** Court grants injunction conditioned on payment of "permanent damages" to the plaintiffs, which will compensate them for their total loss to the property in the present *[and future]{.underline}*

  - Presumably the plant can then continue to pollute

- **Reasoning**

  - Court says that current NY law is that if find nuisance, must grant damages and an injunction

  - Court declines to grant injunction for a number of reasons

    - Cost-benefit analysis -- much higher cost if shut down plant than harm caused

    - Cement plant is important to economy

  - Two possibilities

    - Grant injunction, but postpone for period allowing cement company to develop some alternative remedy

    - Grant injunction conditioned on payment of permanent damages, compensating plaintiffs for present and future injuries

  - Chooses the latter option

    - Unlikely that tech will be developed in the near future

    - Permanent damages seem to do justice to the plaintiffs

    - Does not foreclose public health other agencies bringing suit

- **Dissent**

  - Says that air pollution is really bad!

  - Majority is basically licensing a continuing wrong

  - Overturning existing NY law doesn't seem like the right thing to do -- permanent damages is a new doctrine, basically making it up

  - Inverse condemnation, essentially -- court is allowing "take and pay"

### Nuisance (KA p. 50-59)

- Nuisance is a substantial and unreasonable interference with the right of an owner or occupier of land to the ***use and enjoyment of it***

- Distinct from trespass, which involves interference with the ***right of possession and occupancy***

  - Nuisances tend to be pollutants of some type

- More complicated than this, but a useful working definition is that a nuisance is an activity resulting from a particular kind of harm, and **it may be actionable not only on the basis of intent, but also on negligence or strict liability basis**

- Two kinds of nuisance: **public nuisance** and **private nuisance**

  - **Public nuisance:** Not a tort, but a species of low-level quasi-criminal offenses that affect the general public in common

    - Blocking access to a highway, for example

    - Usually brought by government, unless a private party suffers a special injury that gives it standing

  - **Private nuisance:** A nuisance that affects particular individuals or entities

**1. When is an activity a nuisance?**

- Definition of a nuisance as **[substantial and unreasonable]{.underline} interference with the use or enjoyment of land** reflects the reality that up to a certain point, land uses will always interfere with one another

  - So there's some level of "live and let live"

  - Must be substantial and unreasonable **in the particular context in which it occurs** (like smell of chemicals in a residential neighborhood different than in industrial area)

- Courts forced to "**balance the equities**" when making these determinations

  - See factors from textbook a page or two earlier

- **Coming to the nuisance** presents a particular problem

  - First impulse might be to say that it's your own fault for coming upon a pre-existing problem, but that presents a number of issues

  - 1\) Incentivizes racing behavior, which is undesirable because it doesn't put land to optimal use, just "any"

  - 2\) Shouldn't give existing owner right to forever restrict the use of the property -- does this mean that regardless of who purchases the property, always forbidden to do X in a practical sense?

  - 3\) Owners have some level of property right that should be protected regardless of timing of use of asset? Like this property right should be protected regardless of the "reasonableness" of the other person's actions, even if you assign some value to first-mover

**2. What remedies are available?**

- Unlike with most torts, **injunction** is available as a remedy in addition to **damages**

- Traditionally, courts will balance the equities both at the liability stage, in determining whether or not there is a nuisance at all, **and at the remedy stages, when determining if and how to impose an injunction**

  - In making remedial decisions courts take a variety of factors into perspective, including the value of the activity to the community, the respective level of faults,

  - *Boomer* good example of this

- **Calabresi -- four types of remedial alternatives**

**a. No nuisance: Defendant "enjoins" plaintiff**

- Practical significance of the defendant winning is that the defendant gets the entitlement to continue doing what he's doing; plaintiff can purchase from him

  - Usually even if the defendant wins, there's **something** that's being done that irritates the plaintiff, and that thing will keep going

- **Coase solution:** Defendant has a property right to this activity, can choose to do what he likes with it, including contract

**b. Nuisance: Plaintiff enjoins defendant**

- Traditional remedy is damages -- so in the loud music example, the plaintiff usually will just get paid

- However, also an injunction also a possibility, so here the plaintiff gets assigned this entitlement of "no music" and the *[defendant]{.underline}* can choose to purchase it

  - **Effectively, damages determined by the two parties out of court, rather than by a jury**

- KA notes that even should plaintiff win damages, it's up to the defendant to choose to enforce collection

  - We don't have debtor's prisons

- Also, sale of the injunction not necessarily so simple -- **Coase's** caveat that "there are no transaction costs" almost swallows up the theory entirely

  - 1\) Parties may be so hostile to one another that negotiations are impossible in a practical sense

  - 2\) In class actions, plaintiffs may number in the hundreds, so can't buy out everyone

- **In single plaintiff situations, law can afford to make a mistake because the parties can negotiate around an injunction. However, in cases with multiple plaintiffs, the "market" is probably unable to correct**

  - Would want a high degree of confidence in the rightness of the outcome

**c. Nuisance: Defendant compensates plaintiff**

- Court may decide that the plaintiff is right, but an injunction would lead to too great social and economic costs; award of future damages rather than an injunction better serves the parties collectively

- **Damages with no injunction, though, permit the defendant to choose whether or not to continue the activity**

  - Theoretically there can still be a bargain -- the plaintiffs can still purchase the right

  - But defendant has the leverage

**d. Plaintiff compensates the defendant**

- This is an odd solution -- *[Spur Industries v. Del Webb]{.underline}*; developer "came to nuisance," court assigned property right to the plaintiff but had to pay the damages associated with it, ie the relocation of the cattle lot

- **Effectively, plaintiff is given the right to purchase the property rights at a price set by the court**

**e. Synthesis**

- In each of the four possible nuisance categories, either the plaintiff or the defendant is found to have an entitlement to use the land in the manner contested, and the other party must tolerate that use

  - **Injunctions**: Finding that there is "no nuisance" gives an effective injunction in favor of the defendant, explicit license to perform an action; in contrast, if the plaintiff wins, can force the defendant to stop doing something

  - **Damages:** Award to the plaintiff allowing the defendant to continue actions at a cost set by the court; in the rare "defendant damages" situation, plaintiff has the right to end the defendant's action at a cost set by jury

- **When an entitlement is protected strongly, by injunction, the party holding it cannot be forced to sell. But when it is protected weakly, by damages, the jury is basically setting the price of sale**

  - Typically tort rights are protected weakly because conduct has already occurred

  - In nuisance, because the defendant's conduct is often continuing, the choice between strong and weak protection (property vs liability) must be made

# **REMEDIES**

## **Injunctions or damages?**

***[eBay v. Mercexchange]{.underline}*** (US 2006)

- **Facts:** eBay operates ecommerce site allowing sellers to list goods, either through auction or 'buy it now" feature. MercExchange holds a number of patents, including one that it claims eBay and half.com are violating

  - Parties failed to reach an agreement, and Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found for the plaintiff, grant motion for injunctive relief

  - "As a general rule, courts issue permanent injunctions against patent infringement absent exceptional circumstances"

- **Issue**: Whether MercExchange should be granted injunctive relief

- **Holding:**

- **Reasoning -- Justice Thomas**

  - According to well-established principles of equity, plaintiff seeking injunctive relief must satisfy four-factor test:

    - 1\) Plaintiff has suffered an irreparable injury

    - 2\) That remedies available at law, such as monetary damages, are inadequate to compensate for that injury

    - 3\) That, considering the balances of hardships, equity warranted

    - 4\) Public interest would not be disserved

  - Decision to grant equitable relief is an act of equitable discretion by the district court, reviewable on appeal for abuse of discretion

  - Principles apply with equal force to disputes arising under the Patent Act. "Major departure from the long tradition of equity practice should not be lightly implied"

    - Patent act says that **may** issue injunctions in accordance with the principles of equity

  - According to the Court of Appeals, statutory right to exclude (patents to be treated like personal property) alone justifies its general rule in favor of permanent injunctive relief

    - However, creation of a right is distinct from the provision of remedies for violations of that right

    - Injunctive relief not automatic

  - Approach should be consistent with treatment of injunctions under the Copyright Act

    - Provides that courts [may]{.underline} grant injunctive relief "on such terms as it may deem reasonable to prevent or restrain infringement of a copyright"

    - And Court has consistently rejected rule that injunction automatically follows

  - Both District Court and Court of Appeals failed to apply these traditional equitable principles appropriately

    - **District Court:** Applied the traditional four factor test, but adopted expansive principles, concluding that "plaintiff's willingness to license its patents" and "its lack of commercial activity in practicing the patents" would be sufficient to establish that the patent holder would not suffer irreparable harm

      - Basically, suggesting injunctive relief not available in a broad swath of cases

      - Court has also held that patent holder who has unreasonably declined to use the patent is allowed injunctive relief

    - **Court of Appeals**: Departed from the four factor test, articulated a "general rule" unique to patent disputes saying that permanent injunction should **always** be issued once infringement and validity have been established

  - Neither court approached this correctly, vacate judgment of Court of Appeals, say that district court may apply the framework properly

    - Take no position as to whether permanent injunctive relief should be granted

    - **Only hold that the decision whether to grant or deny injunctive relief rests within the equitable discretion of the district courts, and that such discretion must be exercised consistent with principles of equity, in patent disputes no less than in other cases**

  - **Concurrence -- Chief Justice Roberts, with Justice Scalia and Justice Ginsburg**

    - Agrees with the Court's holding that equitable principle should be applied and "a major departure from the long tradition of equity practice should not be lightly implied"

    - Historical practice does not [entitle]{.underline} a patent holder to a permanent injunction or justify a [general rule]{.underline}

      - While courts have granted permanent injunctions in majority of patent cases because it's difficult to protect a right to exclude through monetary remedies allowing an infringer to use an invention, doesn't **entitle** them to it

    - There is a difference between exercising equitable discretion pursuant to the established four-factor test and writing an entirely clean slate

      - Discretion is not whim -- limiting discretion according to legal standards helps promote the basic principles of justice

    - **When it comes to this area, discerning and applying those standards, in this area as others, "a page of history is worth a volume of logic"**

- **Concurrence -- Justice Kennedy, with Justice Stevens, Souter, and Breyer**

  - Says that majority correct to apply the test, The Chief Justice is correct to note that history may be instructive

  - However, to the extent that history shows this pattern, just illustrates the result of the four0factor test

  - Court should be concerned about patent trolls, licensing fees -- when the patented invention is a small component of the product, may use an injunction just to extort \$

  - Damages therefore may be better; injunctive relief may have problematic consequences

  - Equitable discretion is well-suited to allow courts to adapt to rapid change in technology -- should be recognized that district courts must determine whether the past practice fits

## **Compensatory damages (via KA)**

- When lawyers litigate tort cases, their concern is at least as much with the magnitude of the damages that may be awarded as with the imposition of liability itself. Damages achieve three functions

  - 1\) Achieving corrective justice or providing civil recourse by compensating the plaintiff for losses resulting from the defendant's tortious act

  - 2\) Promoting deterrence by threatening future potential defendants with liability

  - 3\) Recognizing the social and individual significance of the plaintiff's loss and confirming the weight of the defendant's responsibility for that loss

- Consequently, the law governing damages in tort cases is unavoidably linked with the purposes underlying the imposition of tort liability itself

- With that linkage in mind, this chapter examines the basic riles regarding compensatory damage awards

  - Collateral source rule -- affords the plaintiff the right to recover damages even for benefits that have been paid to the plaintiff from her own sources of insurance

  - Damages in cases involving "wrongful death"

  - Punitive damages

**1. Compensatory damages**

- The general rule is that the successful plaintiff is entitled to be made "whole" by recovering damages to compensate for the losses proximately caused by the defendant's tortious act or omission

- In a case involving injury to property, damages are measured by the loss in value of the property or the cost to repair (or replace) whichever is less

- In addition, the plaintiff may recover damages for consequential loss, such as diminished profits

- Successful plaintiff in a bodily injury case may recover for

  - 1\) the special or out of pocket losses proximately resulting from the defendant's tortious action

  - 2\) general damages for non-economic losses, often referred to as "pain and suffering"

- Out-of-pocket, or tangible monetary loss, in bodily injury cases, mostly health-care costs, lost earnings/lost earning capacity

- In contrast, pain and suffering damages for intangible losses may be awarded to compensate the plaintiff for physical and emotional suffering, disfigurement, loss of life, etc

- Plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence she has suffered or will suffer in the future

- Three significant features of this setup

  - 1\) principle of single recovery

  - 2\) absence of an independent cause of action for future loss

  - 3\) function of awards for pain and suffering

### The Principle of Single Recovery: Compensation for Both Past and Future Loss

- Perhaps the most salient feature of the law governing damages in tort cases: ordinary case the plaintiff gets only a single recovery, providing compensation not only for past but also future losses, if any

  - **Advantages**: Great advantage of the principle of single recovery is that the case does not go on forever.

    - For the legal system, the advantage of a single recovery is the avoidance of multiple judicial proceedings and their consequent administrative costs

    - Gets legal closure for both the plaintiff and the defendant

    - Plaintiff can move on with life, get damages in single award, and then no incentive to stay sick or injured

    - Defendant no longer has indefinite financial exposure

  - **Disadvantages:** Almost certainly less accuracy in estimating future damages than there would be if determinations made periodically as losses incurred

    - Plaintiff must be a good investor

  - **Discounting to present value:** Principle of single recovery forces jury to "discount to present value" awards made for future out of pocket losses by awarding less than the actual dollar amount

    - Illustrates time value of money

    - For some reason pain and suffering awards are not discounted (incur all at once?)

### Inchoate and Future Loss

- A corollary of the principle of single recovery is the rule that there is no independent cause of action for losses that have not yet occurred

- Once tangible physical loss has taken place, can recover for that, and all future losses

- But if no tangible loss, then no action even for "future losses already lost"

- Medical monitoring one exception: ie, if need to monitor health, can get compensation for that, but otherwise recovery is never permitted today for damages resulting from even a reasonable fear that one will suffer harm in future (ie, exposed to potential cancer)

  - Aside from medical monitoring costs, under the principle of a single recovery, liability for future loss must await the actual occurrence of present physical injury

### Pain and Suffering Awards

**1. The Functions of the Award**

- Awards for pain and suffering perform a number of functions

  - 1\) In the case of serious injury, few people would think that providing compensation for out of pocket loss alone could ever make the plaintiff "whole"

    - Money paid may not remove that loss, but it does acknowledge the wrong done to the plaintiff and the fact that the plaintiff has experienced intangible losses

    - Money some sort of compensation for that, representing a value

  - 2\) Although the plaintiff's pain and suffering cannot ever be fully compensated, the plaintiff may be able to use an award to provide activities or enjoyments that substitute for those lost as a result of the injury in question

    - If can't play soccer, might use money to watch soccer on tv

  - 3\) Regardless of whether money can properly compensate for it, there's no question that pain and suffering is worth deterring

    - Even if no benefit, makes sense to take money away from the party that injured the victim, impose a penalty

    - Deterrence = doesn't matter who gets it, even! (That's why government has fines)

    - In some contexts the deterrence argument doesn't hold up quite as well

      - For example, in medicine, the plaintiff is effectively paying for the potential liability through higher fees associated with the doctor's malpractice insurance

      - Maybe shouldn't give these awards out at all? Do most people want to buy insurance for pain and suffering?

        - Maybe it's rational though

      - As long as tort law is conceived of as more than an insurance system, the non-insurance arguments do hold up

  - 4\) Pain and suffering awards sort of factor in counsel's fees

    - Ie, juries understand how the lawyer gets paid (contingent fee basis) and factor that in

### Limitations on awards 

- Notwithstanding these justifications for awarding pain and suffering, note that doesn't necessarily follow that awards should be unlimited

- One major criticism -- awards too high and too variable. Results in over deterrence and reluctance to develop risky/innovative product lines at all

- In theory, most functions of pain and suffering awards can be served when we place limits on how much may be awarded for pain and suffering

  - Traditional approach to the problem of size and variability in award levels has been to permit courts to restrict through *remitter*

  - Under this practice, when a jury award is n excess of what a reasonable jury could award in light of all evidence, trial court gives plaintiff a choice between new trial and acceptance of reduction

  - *Additur* available when the award is too low

  - But these are ad hoc approaches that many courts are reluctant to apply except in the most egregious

- Ceilings on pain and suffering awards problematic too though -- maybe there are some edge cases where we WOULD want to go that high?

  - Disproportionately these are young, seriously injured victims

  - So ceilings hurt them, while imposing no limitations on the people whose claims are inflated but still below the ceiling

- Alternative would be to construct a "schedule" for pain and suffering damages

  - Ie, certain \$ amount for paralysis, another amount for loss of an arm, etc

  - Issue is that it could take awhile to establish, and that judiciary can't do it -- need legislature (like with sentencing guidelines)

**3. Pain and Suffering Property Damages?**

- Black-letter law that pain and suffering damages are not recoverable in cases involving property damage

- Despite the fact that emotionally attached, say, to a family heirloom, can't get \$ for it beyond the value of the property itself

- Some states allow limited claim for things like death of a pet

## **Valuing Life**

- What does it mean to place a value on life?

  - The EPA does not place a dollar value on individual lives. Rather, when conducting a benefit-cost analysis of new environmental policies, the Agency uses estimates of how much people are willing to pay for small reductions in their risks of dying from adverse health conditions that may be caused by environmental pollution.

  - In the scientific literature, these estimates of willingness to pay for small reductions in mortality risks are often referred to as the \"value of a statistical life." This is because these values are typically reported in units that match the aggregate dollar amount that a large group of people would be willing to pay for a reduction in their individual risks of dying in a year, such that we would expect one fewer death among the group during that year on average. This is best explained by way of an example. Suppose each person in a sample of 100,000 people were asked how much he or she would be willing to pay for a reduction in their individual risk of dying of 1 in 100,000, or 0.001%, over the next year. Since this reduction in risk would mean that we would expect one fewer death among the sample of 100,000 people over the next year on average, this is sometimes described as \"one statistical life saved." Now suppose that the average response to this hypothetical question was \$100. Then the total dollar amount that the group would be willing to pay to save one statistical life in a year would be \$100 per person × 100,000 people, or \$10 million. This is what is meant by the \"value of a statistical life." Importantly, this is not an estimate of how much money any single individual or group would be willing to pay to prevent the certain death of any particular person.

- What is the value of a "statistical life"?

  - EPA recommends that the central estimate of \$7.4 million (\$2006), updated to the year of the analysis, be used in all benefits analyses that seek to quantify mortality risk reduction benefits regardless of the age, income, or other population characteristics of the affected population until revised guidance becomes available (see \"What is the current process for updating the Agency\'s estimates?" below). This approach was vetted and endorsed by the Agency when the 2000 Guidelines for Preparing Economic Analyses were drafted. Although \$7.4 million (\$2006) remains EPA\'s default guidance for valuing mortality risk changes, the Agency has considered and presented others (see \"What Values Has EPA Used in the Past?\" below.)

**DIFFICULTIES WITH COMPENSATORY DAMAGES**

**I guess what confuses me about the below is that compensation for "pain and suffering" or w/e should be equal -- that's the intrinsic value we place on human life. But the part of the damages that's going to the [victims]{.underline} for [foregone earnings]{.underline} is inherently like...dependent on things such as life expectancy, prior work history, etc**

**[Disparities]{.underline}**

- Earnings

  - CSM article argues that should compensate people equally -- ignore income, number of children, etc. All life is equal

- Race and gender

  - Fair Calculations Act sponsored by Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand -- would ban use of race and sex when calculating damages awards

***[Seffert v. Los Angeles Transit Lines]{.underline}***

- **Facts:** Defendant appealing from judgment for plaintiff of \$188K entered at jury verdict -- says that prejudicial errors committed during trial and judgment is excessive

  - Court rejects defendant's contributory negligence opinion at the start of the opinion

  - Plaintiff was entering the defendant's bus when the doors closed suddenly, catching right hand and left foot -- she was thrown to the pavement

  - Extensive injuries such that plaintiff will be permanently crippled and in pain for the rest of her life; has had 9 surgeries, potentially more, and has difficulty working

- **Issue:** Excessive damages award?

- **Holding:** Considering the nature of the injury, cannot say that as a matter of law that it is so high that it shocks the conscience and gives rise to the presumption that it was the result of passion or prejudice (which is required for appellate court to overturn damages award)

- **Reasoning**

  - Substantial evidence to support the estimates of damages given by the plaintiff, which the jury appears to have relied on

  - Defendants primarily attacking the \$134K for nonpecuniary items of damage, including pain and suffering, past and future

    - However, presumption here is in favor of the trial court

  - **An appellate court can interfere on the ground that the judgment is excessive only on the ground that the verdict is so large that at first blush, it shocks the conscience**

    - Stated in *[Holmes v. Southern Cal. Edison Co]{.underline}*

  - There are no fixed or absolute standards by which an appellate court can measure in monetary terms the extent of the damages suffered by the plaintiff

    - Wide difference of opinion

  - Each case should be decided on its own facts and circumstances: the question that should be decided by the appellate courts is whether or not the verdict is so out of line with reason that it shocks the conscience and necessarily implies that the verdict must have been the result of passion or prejudice

## **Negligently Inflicted Emotional Distress: "Pure" Emotional Distress**

- Only limited duty to avoid inflicting emotional distress

- To understand what is and is not at stake, remember that there is a separate cause of action for *intentional* infliction of emotional distress, and the right to recover damages for emotional distress that results from negligently-caused physical injury is well-established

- Issue here is whether **there is a cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress that is not the result of negligently-caused physical injury (ie "pure" emotional distress)**

  - Two general categories of cases in which such liability might be imposed

    - 1\) an "**independent duty**," instances in which the failure to exercise reasonable care (whatever that might mean) simply causes emotional distress

    - 2\) **Derivative duty**: failure to exercise reasonable care to avoid causing physical injury does not result in physical injury to the plaintiff. But does result in emotional distress

**A. Independent Duty**

- Liability in negligence is only rarely imposed for independently causing another person emotional distress

  - Example: I negligently forgot that a close relative of yours died last week, but nonetheless present a gruesome hypo in torts

  - **Liability can only be imposed when there is some sort of freestanding duty to exercise reasonable care not to cause emotional distress, or some specific duty applicable to classrooms**

- **In general there is no independent duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid causing another person emotional distress**

  - Two rather circumscribed traditional exceptions are for emotional loss suffered when the defendant negligently mishandles a corpse and for emotional loss suffered when negligently sends a telegram saying someone's loved one passed away (erroneously)

- General no-duty rule, but why?

  - 1\) Articulated over a century ago that there was too great an opportunity for fraud in the typical case in which a plaintiff claimed that he or she was frightened or upset by the defendant

    - And "**floodgates of litigation**" would open if a cause of action for negligently caused pure emotional distress were recognized

  - 2\) Imposing liability for negligently inflicting emotional distress would require the development of standards of reasonable care that simply don't exist right now

  - 3\) This isn't what we want tort law to do: there is a limited amount of money that we are willing to devote to tortious conduct

    - NIED seems to imply that we are better devoting it to people who suffer physical injury than diluting with NIED fu

**COPYRIGHT ACT: 17 U.S. Code § 504 - Remedies for infringement: Damages and profits**

- (a)In General.---Except as otherwise provided by this title, an infringer of copyright is liable for either---the copyright owner's *[actual damages and any additional profits]{.underline}* of the infringer, as provided by subsection (b); or *[statutory damages]{.underline}*, as provided by subsection (c).

- (b)Actual Damages and Profits.---

  - The copyright owner is entitled to recover the actual damages suffered by him or her as a result of the infringement, and any profits of the infringer that are attributable to the infringement and are not taken into account in computing the actual damages. In establishing the infringer's profits, the copyright owner is required to present proof only of the infringer's gross revenue, and the infringer is required to prove his or her deductible expenses and the elements of profit attributable to factors other than the copyrighted work.

- \(c\) Statutory Damages.---

  - Except as provided by clause (2) of this subsection, the copyright owner may elect, at any time before final judgment is rendered, to recover, instead of actual damages and profits, an award of statutory damages for all infringements involved in the action, with respect to any one work, for which any one infringer is liable individually, or for which any two or more infringers are liable jointly and severally, in a sum of not less than \$750 or more than \$30,000 as the court considers just. For the purposes of this subsection, all the parts of a compilation or derivative work constitute one work.

  - In a case where the copyright owner sustains the burden of proving, and the court finds, that infringement was committed willfully, the court in its discretion may increase the award of statutory damages to a sum of not more than \$150,000. In a case where the infringer sustains the burden of proving, and the court finds, that such infringer was not aware and had no reason to believe that his or her acts constituted an infringement of copyright, the court in its discretion may reduce the award of statutory damages to a sum of not less than \$200. The court shall remit statutory damages in any case where an infringer believed and had reasonable grounds for believing that his or her use of the copyrighted work was a fair use under section 107, if the infringer was: (i) an employee or agent of a nonprofit educational institution, library, or archives acting within the scope of his or her employment who, or such institution, library, or archives itself, which infringed by reproducing the work in copies or phonorecords; or (ii) a public broadcasting entity which or a person who, as a regular part of the nonprofit activities of a public broadcasting entity (as defined in section 118(f)) infringed by performing a published nondramatic literary work or by reproducing a transmission program embodying a performance of such a work.

**SKADDEN: Speculative damages**

- Accordingly, every litigator should know the basic rules govern- ing speculative damages.

  - For plaintiffs, framing and establishing damages in a concrete and ascertainable fashion can help secure signicantly larger monetary awards.

  - For defendants, successfully challenging plaintiff's damages theory or calculation may mitigate or avoid altogether a damages award, even where the other elements of the cause of action have been satisfied. Counsel are well-advised to carefully plan at the outset of a litigation how they intend to prove or defend against a damages claim that might "push the envelope" under existing New York precedent.

- The recent opinion issued by the Appellate Division, Third Department, in Leto v. Amrex Chemical Co., 85 A.D.3d 1509 (3d Dept. 2011), is demonstrative.

  - the court agreed with defendant that plaintiffs failed to estab- lish the \$1,260,000 award for future lost earnings "with reasonable certainty." Id. at 1510. Rather, the record established that it was "reasonably certain" that plaintiff's earnings decreased by only \$34,582 per year as a result of the accident, which, when multiplied by a projected 21 remaining work years, yielded \$726,222 in damages for future lost earn- ings. Id. at 1511. Thus, absent a stipulation to this amount by plaintiff, the court held that it would order a new trial. Id.

- Finally, another recent tort case serves as an added reminder that even where there has been a nding of liability, impermissibly speculative dam- age claims are subject to attack. In Signature Health Center, LLC v. State, 28 Misc. 3d 543 (Ct. Cl. 2010), a Medicaid provider sued the state for ministerial neg- ligence to recover consequential damages resulting from the delay by the New York state Department of Health in posting the provider's revised Medicaid reimbursement rates, which served as the basis for a \$3 million retroactive reimbursement. Id. at 545-46.

  - According to claimant, the delay in receiving these funds caused substantial harm to the value of its business, including the loss of future business due to a lack of capital, poor credit and the inability to meet its financial obligations, interest expense and eventual bankruptcy. Id. at 546-47.

- As these recent New York decisions illustrate, proving damages is a critical battleground in tort and contract litigations.

  - All New York litigators should have a rm understanding from the very outset of a case regarding what types and the extent of damages that may be recoverable in a given dispute and how such damage claims will be pled and established or vulnerable to attack as impermissibly speculative or conjectural.

  - Expert testimony may be crucial in proving up or defending against such damage claims. Indeed, the nal result swings in the balance.

## **HUANG: THE EQUIPOISE EFFECT** (1596-1603)

- Would more polluters be deterred if they might be forced to dis- gorge their gains rather than pay damages based on harm? Would fewer promises be broken if contract breach might lead to disgorgement rather than expectation damages?

- It is "strong medicine" to be used "sparingly,"6 we were reminded last year when the Supreme Court sanctioned Nebraska for siphoning off river water belonging to Kansas.7 In academic parlance, we sometimes say that the threat to take away a wrongdoer's net gains goes beyond optimal deterrence to achieve complete deterrence,8 and courts seem to agree.

  - In contrast with "optimal deterrence," which is meant to permit acts whose bene- fits justify their social costs, "complete deterrence" is reserved for acts that should never occur.

- **Someone who expects to disgorge her net gain knows that her act will be neither gainful nor costly; it will be a wash.10 She will break even.** To fully persuade her not to act, then, other costs be- yond disgorgement itself must finish the job.11 Litigation costs or oppor- tunity costs might do it. But the remedy itself only places her on the fence---a precarious point of equipoise, from which she can tip either way.12

  - Our usual rhetoric hides this fact because the way we speak about disgorgement often conflates the remedy itself with the trappings of its usage, implicitly piling on extra nonremedial costs.13

- **Substituting disgorgement for any other remedy, part of the time, can emulate the incentive effect of using that other remedy all of the time.**

  - To see this more vividly, imagine meeting the founder of a tech start- up in the Bay Area.

  - Suppose that she expects to be held liable for patent infringement if she uses a certain technology without license.14 Also sup- pose that patent remedies are designed such that a prospective infringer might have to disgorge her net profits (thus breaking even), or alterna- tively, might have to pay compensation for harm to the patentee (thus keeping her profits while also paying for the patentee's loss).15

  - Some chance of breaking even, but otherwise enjoying a net gain, is still a net gain overall. Some chance of breaking even, but otherwise suffering a net loss, is still a net loss overall.

  - **Thus, the occasional possibility of having to disgorge profits instead of paying compensation should leave an actor's decision unchanged**

  - The possible substitution of dis- gorgement dilutes her incentives---but thanks to the equipoise effect, her incentives continue to point her toward the same decision.

- As we have just seen, the logic of the equipoise effect implies that **a court or a public enforcer may be able to substitute disgorgement some of the time, in place of harm-based damages, without altering the overall effect on behavior. To put it more generally, if the actor is uncertain about whether the remedy she must pay will be disgorgement or harm- based damages, then the resulting incentive effect emulates that which results from facing harm-based damages for sure.**

  - Internalizing harm is not the only aim, moreover, that can be emu- lated in this way. The underlying logic extends to other incentives that the law may seek to create by imposing remedies, including complete deterrence.21 Furthermore, such flexibility in switching between reme- dies may also ease the tradeoffs with nondeterrence concerns in a given case, such as distributional effects or certain notions of justice.22

## **HUANG: CONCURRENT DAMAGES**

- Imagine that a hacker is working for a university official secretly spying on faculty members---say, to find out who has been leaking in- formation to the press about internal disciplinary matters.2 The injuries to a given victim of the hacking might follow a classic learning curve: The first few intrusions into her e-mail account reveal a storehouse of personal secrets, but further break-ins yield less and less new infor- mation. ***One might say there is diminishing marginal harm.3***

  - **There is no such leveling off, however, in the compensation that would be awarded to that victim. The electronic privacy law that bars such hacking provides for statutory damages of a given amount per vi- olation,4 and each unauthorized intrusion is considered a separate violation**

- If these were criminal penalties, of course, the judge could readily neutralize such inaccuracy and arbitrariness by running the formal counts concurrently, grouped in sensible ways.6

  - **But in the civil context, damages always seem to run consecutively (one might say); there ap- pears to be no regular practice of collapsing nominal counts, even when doing so may be the most intuitive and direct means for reducing redun- dancy or for better matching damages to harm.7**

- **This Article explores the possibility of allowing courts to run civil damages awards concurrently.8** **In the hacker's case, for example, why not give the judge the option of running those redundant counts concur- rently by victim?**

  - Or in the original scenario, why not allow the use of concurrent damages to help fit the award to diminishing marginal harm?

  - The operation of such a device would already be familiar to generalist courts: As with concurrent criminal sentences, the judge would recog- nize every act of violation, but then have the option of grouping or col- lapsing those nominal counts, if need be, so that the real penalties do not stack up arbitrarily.9

- Whether required by statute10 or entrenched in judicial practice,11 the usual linear approach to assessing damages does make sense--- sometimes. In some cases, harm is linear. Besides, the approach is utter- ly intuitive: What could be more natural than counting up all the viola- tions, and then imposing a set penalty for each?

  - **Yet this familiar default also suffers often from a structural flaw: in- flexibility, both in how violations are counted and in how the awards per violation add up.** Courts have struggled against these dual rigidities, most famously in statutory damages contexts where linearity is com- pounded by high statutory ranges---leading to massive potential awards.13 Think of the court's exclamation above ("a billion dollars") about Copyright Act damages in a file-sharing case. Or consider the False Claims Act case in which the judge wrestled against a statutory command to impose a mandatory minimum penalty for each of the 9000-plus invoices from a contractor---amounting to over \$50 million in statutory damages---under a single tainted government contract worth only \$3 million.14

  - What if this con- tractor had happened to bill the government only twice a year? (Only four violations, then.) How about monthly? (Some twenty-four viola- tions.) In fact, the judge noted that he would have counted only one vio- lation---based on the single underlying contract---if the statute had al- lowed him to do so.18 One might as well insert a lottery into the damages award.

- **Judicial design for minimizing excessive damages is inadequate -- blunt instrument**

  - **Plus the idea itself -- an exception to the rule -- creates noise**

- 

**WIRED:** SUPREME COURT OKS \$222K VERDICT FOR SHARING 24 SONGS

- Copyright Act allows max \$150K -- owner may elect to receive \$750-\$30K for "substantially all infringements involved in the action" prior to judgment

- Woman says she won't pay \$222K -- will just declare bankruptcy

- Supreme Court declines to hear case

## **Punitive damages**

### Vicarious liability (KA 212-214)

- Principal example of vicarious liability -- liability for injury caused by the conduct of another party -- is the doctrine of "respondeat superior" or "let the superior answer"

  - Employer liable for crimes of the subordinate under some circumstances

- This is **distinct from liability for employer's [own]{.underline} torts**

  - For example -- I hire an employee to drive trucks for me who has history of drunk driving. He gets in an accident

    - I may be liable for negligence for hiring him...but this is not vicarious liability

    - Vicarious liability = liability for **the victim's injuries caused by the employee**

- Employers are vicariously liable, even absent their own negligence, for torts committed by their employees "within the scope of employment," **even absent negligence on the part of the employer**

  - Theory reflects certain of the theories behind strict liability

    - Employer in better position to make activity level and research decisions

    - Often difficult to prove that a particular employee was negligent because identifying the employee in question is not possible even when it is clear whose employee

      - May reduce information costs

  - Liability does not [substitute]{.underline} employer's liability, it's [additional]{.underline}

    - Employees are more likely to be judgment-proof than employers, insurance or loss distirbution clearly plays a role

- Two questions

  - 1\) Who is an employee?

    - Can be an "agent" but not an employee, ie independent contractors -- hired, but have minimal control over this person

    - Couple of reasons to include employees but not contractors

      - Defendant has minimal control over the contractor -- can't direct work to any great degree

      - Contractors work for many people

      - Contractor's employer just as likely to spread costs (ie, you contract with the electrician's firm)

  - 2\) When is a tort committed "within the scope of employment"?

    - Idea is that at some point employer's capacity to direct the behavior of the individual is limited

    - Example given: detour vs prolic

      - Employer is liable for acts committed on a mere "detour" in scope of work, but not for torts committed while employee off doing something completely different

      - Ie, if truck driver supposed to drive across town to deliver package, and he takes a shortcut, that's ok, but not if he drives off on vacation

    - *[Ira S. Bushey & Sons v. United States]{.underline}*: Drunken sailor returning from shore left open valve on drydock, causing ship to partially sink

      - No way to describe this as a "mere" detour, but drunken sailors are predictable, and subject to control by Navy, and the US government obviously has deepest possible pockets, so serves loss distribution well

  - **What counts as conduct "within the scope of employment" therefore would depend on how effectively imposing liability on the employer for injuries caused by that conduct will serve the purposes of strict liability**

***[Exxon v. Baker]{.underline}***

- **Facts:**

  - *Exxon Valdex* grounded on Bligh Reed off the Alaskan coast, fracturing hull and spilling millions of crude into Prince William Sound

  - Owner have settled state and federal claims for environmental damages (\>\$1 billion)

  - Action by respondent and others (includes Alaskan, fishermen, etc) brought for economic losses for individuals dependent on Prince William Sound for livelihood

- **Issue:** There are three questions of maritime law before Court:

  - Whether a shipowner may be liable for punitive damages without acquiescence in the actions causing harm

  - Whether punitive damages have been barred implicitly by federal statutory law making no provision for them, and

  - Whether the award of \$2.5 billion in this case is greater than maritime law should allow in the circumstances.

- **Holding**

  - We are equally divided on the owner's derivative liability, and hold that the

  - Federal statutory law does not bar a punitive award on top of damages for economic loss, but that the award here should be limited to an amount equal to com- pensatory damages.

- **Reasoning**

  - Hazelwood, the captain, drank \~16 oz of 80 proof vodka, enough that "a non-alcoholic would have passed out" before boarding ship

    - Had been in AA before

    - Exxon seemed to have known about his drinking issues, but did nothing to prevent

  - Captain inexplicably left the bridge and went down to his cabin, leaving third mate and helmsman to manage this required turn

    - Ship runs aground

    - After Hazelwood returned to bridge, reported grounding, tried to rock the Valdez off the reef; Coast Guard shows up and he has 0.061 BAC, which would mean BAC of 0.241 at time of spill, which would be three times the legal limit for driving

  - Exxon spends \$2.1 billion cleaning up, violations of Clean Water Act, Refuse Act, Migratory Bird Treaty Act, Ports and Waterways Safety Act, and Dangerous Cargo Act

    - Pleads guilty to CWA, Refuse Act, and Migratory Bird Act

    - Pays \$125 million in fines and restitution, \$900 million in restoring natural resources (US and Alaska civil action), and \$303 million in voluntary settlements with private parties

  - Remaining cases consolidated into this one against Exxon, Hazelwood, and others

    - On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the Phase I jury instruction on corporate liability for acts of managerial agents under Circuit precedent.

      - With respect to the size of the punitive damages award, however, the Circuit remanded twice for adjustments in light of this Court's due process cases before ultimately itself remitting the award to \$2.5 billion.

  - **We granted certiorari to consider whether maritime law**

    - **1) allows corporate liability for punitive damages on the basis of the acts of managerial agents**

    - **2) whether the Clean Water Act (, forecloses the award of punitive damages in maritime spill cases, and**

    - **3) whether the punitive damages awarded against Exxon in this case were exces- sive as a matter of maritime common law. We now vacate and remand.**

  - **1) Corporate liability for punitive damages on the basis of acts of managerial agents**

    - Exxon says that it was error to instruct the jury that a corporation "is responsible for the reckless acts of . . . employees . . . in a managerial capacity while acting in the scope of their employment."

      - Exxon takes this statement (referencing privateer case *The Amiable* Nancy) as a rule barring punitive liability against shipowners for actions by underlings not "directed," "countenanced," or "participated in" by the owners.

      - Exxon further claims that the Court confirmed this rule in Lake Shore, supra, a railway case in which the Court relied on The Amiable Nancy to announce, as a matter of pre-Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, general common law, **that "\[t\]hough \[a\] principal is liable to make compensation for \[intentional torts\] by his agent, he is not liable to be punished by exemplary damages for an intent in which he did not participate."**

      - Be- cause maritime law remains federal common law, and because the Court has never revisited the issue, Exxon argues that Lake Shore endures as sound evidence of maritime law.

        - And even if the rule of Amiable Nancy and Lake Shore does not control, Exxon urges the Court to fall back to a modern-day variant adopted in the context of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in Kolstad v. American Dental Assn **that employers are not subject to punitive damages for discriminatory conduct by their managerial employees** if they can show that they maintained and enforced good-faith antidiscrimination policies

    - Baker says follow the Restatement rule recognizing corporate liability in punitive damages for reckless acts of managerial employees, see 4 Restatement (Second) of Torts §909(c

      - Baker says that The Amiable Nancy offers nothing but dictum, because punitive damages were not at issue, and that Lake Shore merely rejected company liability for the acts of a railroad conductor, while saying nothing about liability for agents higher up the ladder, like ship captains

      - He also makes the broader points that the **opinion was criticized for failing to reflect the majority rule of its own time, not to mention its conflict with the respondeat superior rule in the overwhelming share of land-based jurisdictions today**

      - Baker argues that the **maritime rule should conform to modern land-based common law, where a majority of States allow punitive damages for the con- duct of any employee**, and most others follow the Restatement, imposing liability for managerial agents.

    - **The Court is equally divided on this question, and "\[i\]f the judges are divided, the reversal cannot be had, for no order can be made."** Durant v. Essex Co., 7 Wall. 107, 112 (1869). We therefore leave the Ninth Circuit's opinion undisturbed in this respect, though it should go without saying that the disposition here is not precedential on the derivative liability question.

      - 9th Circuit had held there was liability

  - \[Skip part III\]

  - Finally, Exxon raises an issue of first impression about punitive damages in maritime law, which falls within a federal court's jurisdiction to decide in the manner of a common law court, subject to the authority of Congress to legislate otherwise if it disagrees with the judicial result.

  - In addition to its resistance to derivative liability for punitive damages and its preemption claim already disposed of, **Exxon challenges the size of the remaining \$2.5 billion punitive damages award.** Other than its preemption argument, it does not offer a legal ground for concluding that maritime law should never award punitive damages, or that none should be awarded in this case, but it does **argue that this award exceeds the bounds justified by the punitive damages goal of deterring reckless (or worse) behavior and the consequently heightened threat of harm**. The claim goes to our understanding of the place of punishment in modern civil law and reasonable standards of process in administering punitive law, subjects that call for starting with a brief account of the history behind today's punitive damages.

    - The modern Anglo-American doctrine of punitive dam- ages dates back at least to 1763, when a pair of decisions by the Court of Common Pleas recognized the availability of damages "for more than the injury received."

      - Awarding damages beyond the compensatory was not, however, a wholly novel idea even then, legal codes from ancient times through the Middle Ages having called for multiple damages for certain especially harmful acts.

      - But punitive damages were a common law innovation untethered to strict numerical multipliers,

    - Early common law cases offered various rationales for punitive-damages awards, which were then generally dubbed "**exemplary**," implying that these **verdicts were justified as punishment for extraordinary wrongdoing**, as in Wilkes's case. Sometimes, though, the extraordinary element emphasized was the damages award itself, the punishment being "for example's sake,"

    - A third historical justification, which showed up in some of the early cases, has been noted by recent commentators, and that was the need "to **compensate for intangible injuries**, compensation which was not otherwise available under the narrow conception of compensatory damages prevalent at the time."

    - As the century progressed, and "the types of compensatory damages available to plaintiffs . . . broadened," the consequence was that **American courts tended to speak of punitive damages as separate and distinct from compensatory damages -- almost total eclipse of compensatory function**

    - Regardless of the alternative rationales over the years, the ***consensus today is that punitives are aimed not at compensation but principally at retribution and deterring harmful conduct***.9 This consensus informs the doctrine in most modern American jurisdictions, where juries are customarily instructed on twin goals of punitive awards.

  - The **prevailing rule in American courts also limits punitive damages to cases of what the Court in Day, supra, at 371, spoke of as "enormity," where a defendant's conduct is "outrageous," 4 Restatement §908(2), owing to "gross negligence," "willful, wanton, and reckless indifference for the rights of others,"** or behavior even more deplorable

    - Under the umbrellas of punishment and its aim of deterrence, degrees of relative blameworthiness are ap- parent. Reckless conduct is not intentional or malicious, nor is it necessarily callous toward the risk of harming others, as opposed to unheedful of it.

    - Action taken or omitted in order to augment profit represents an enhanced degree of punish- able culpability, as of course does willful or malicious action, taken with a purpose to injure.

    - Regardless of culpability, however, heavier punitive awards have been thought to be justifiable when wrongdoing is hard to detect, or when the value of injury and the corresponding compensatory award are small

      - And, with a broadly analogous object, some regulatory schemes provide by statute for multiple recovery in order to induce private litigation to supplement official enforcement that might fall short if unaided

  - State regulation of punitive damages varies.

    - A few States award them rarely, or not at all.

      - Nebraska bars punitive damages entirely, on state constitutional grounds.

      - Four others permit punitive damages only when authorized by statute: Louisiana, Massachusetts, and Washington as a matter of common law, and New Hampshire by statute codifying common law tradition.

      - Michigan courts recognize only exemplary dam- ages supportable as compensatory, rather than truly punitive

      - Connecti- cut courts have limited what they call punitive recovery to the "expenses of bringing the legal action, including attorney's fees, less taxable costs"

    - As for procedure, in most American jurisdictions the amount of the punitive award is generally determined by a jury in the first instance, and that "determination is then reviewed by trial and appellate courts to ensure that it is reasonable."

      - The States that rely on a multiplier have adopted a variety of ratios, ranging from 5:1 to 1:1.12

    - Despite these limitations, punitive damages overall are higher and more frequent in the United States than they are anywhere else

      - American punitive damages have been the target of audible criticism in recent decades, see, e.g., Note, Developments, The Paths of Civil Litigation, 113 Harv. L. Rev. 1783, 1784--1788 (2000) (surveying criticism), but the most recent studies tend to undercut much of it, see id., at 1787--1788. A survey of the literature reveals that discretion to award punitive damages has not mass-produced runaway awards, and although some studies show the dollar amounts of punitive-damages awards growing over time, even in real terms,13 by most accounts the median ratio of punitive to compensatory awards has remained

    - The real problem, it seems, is the stark unpredictability of punitive awards. Courts of law are concerned with fairness as consistency, and evidence that the median ratio of punitive to compensatory awards falls within a reasonable zone, or that punitive awards are infrequent, fails to tell us whether the spread between high and low individual awards is acceptable. The available data suggest it is not.

    - Starting with the premise of a punitive-damages regime, these ranges of variation might be acceptable or even desirable if they resulted from judges' and juries' refining their judgments to reach a generally accepted optimal level of penalty and deterrence in cases involving a wide range of circumstances, while producing fairly consistent results in cases with similar facts.

      - But anecdotal evidence suggests that nothing of that sort is going on. One of our own leading cases on punitive damages, with a \$4 million verdict by an Alabama jury, noted that a second Alabama case with strikingly similar facts produced "a comparable amount of compensatory damages" but "no punitive dam- ages at all." See Gore, 517 U. S., at 565, n. 8. As the Supreme Court of Alabama candidly explained, "the dis- parity between the two jury verdicts . . . \[w\]as a reflection of the inherent uncertainty of the trial process." BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 646 So. 2d 619, 626 (1994) (per curiam).

      - We are aware of no scholarly work pointing to consistency across punitive awards in cases involving similar claims and circumstances

    - **Today's enquiry differs from due process review because the case arises under federal maritime jurisdiction, and we are reviewing a jury award for conformity with maritime law, rather than the outer limit allowed by due process;** we are examining the verdict in the exercise of federal maritime common law authority, which precedes and should obviate any application of the constitutional standard.

      - Our review of punitive damages today, then, considers not their intersection with the Constitution, but the desirability of regulating them as a common law remedy for which responsibility lies with this Court as a source of judge-made law in the absence of statute.

      - Whatever may be the constitutional significance of the unpredictability of high punitive awards, this feature of happenstance is in tension with the function of the awards as punitive, just because of the implication of unfairness that an eccentrically high punitive verdict carries in a system whose commonly held notion of law rests on a sense of fairness in dealing with one another.

        - Thus, a penalty should be reasonably predictable in its severity, so that even Justice Holmes's "bad man" can look ahead with some ability to know what the stakes are in choosing one course of action or another.

        - And when the bad man's counterparts turn up from time to time, the penalty scheme they face ought to threaten them with a fair probability of suffering in like degree when they wreak like damage.

        - The common sense of justice would surely bar penalties that reasonable people would think excessive for the harm caused in the circumstances.

  - **With that aim ourselves, we have three basic approaches to consider, one verbal and two quantitative.**

    - 1\) State courts have settled on criteria for judicial review of punitive damages beyond traditional "shock the conscience" and "passion and prejudice"

      - These judicial review criteria are brought to bear after juries render verdicts under instructions offering, at best, guidance no more specific for reaching an appropriate penalty. In Maryland, for example, which allows punitive damages for intentional torts and conduct characterized by "actual malice,"

      - *These examples leave us skeptical that verbal formulations, superimposed on general jury instructions, are the best insurance against unpredictable outliers.*

      - Instructions can go just so far in promoting systemic consistency when awards are not tied to specifically proven items of damage (the cost of medical treatment, say), and although judges in the States that take this approach may well produce just results by dint of valiant effort, our experience with attempts to produce consistency in the analogous business of criminal sentencing leaves us doubtful that anything but a quantified approach will work.

    - It is instructive, then, that in the last quarter century federal sentencing rejected an "indeterminate" system, with relatively unguided discretion to sentence within a wide range, under which "similarly situated offenders were sentenced \[to\], and did actually serve, widely dispa- rate sentences."

      - Instead it became a system of detailed guidelines tied to exactly quantified sentencing results, under the authority of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984

      - This federal criminal law development, with its many state parallels, strongly suggests that as long "as there are no punitive- damages guidelines, corresponding to the federal and state sentencing guidelines, it is inevitable that the specific amount of punitive damages awarded whether by a judge or by a jury will be arbitrary

    - This is why our better judgment is that eliminating unpredictable outlying punitive awards by more rigorous standards than the constitutional limit will probably have to take the form adopted in those States that have looked to the criminal-law pattern of quantified limits

      - One option would be to follow the States that set a **hard dollar cap on punitive damages**, see supra, at 22, a course that arguably would come closest to the criminal law, rather like setting a maximum term of years

        - The trouble is, though, that there is no "standard" tort or contract injury, making it difficult to settle upon a particular dollar figure as appropriate across the board.

        - And of course a judicial selection of a dollar cap would carry a serious drawback; a legislature can pick a figure, index it for inflation, and revisit its provision whenever there seems to be a need for further tinkering, but a court cannot say when an issue will show up on the docket again.

      - **The more promising alternative is to leave the effects of inflation to the jury or judge who assesses the value of actual loss, by pegging punitive to compensatory damages using a ratio or maximum multiple**

        - And of course the potential relevance of the ratio between compensatory and punitive damages is indisputable, being a central feature in our due process analysis.

        - Still, some will murmur that this smacks too much of policy and too little of principle.

        - But the answer rests on the fact that we are acting here in the position of a common law court of last review, faced with a perceived defect in a common law remedy.

        - Traditionally, courts have accepted primary responsibility for reviewing punitive damages and thus for their evolution, and if, in the absence of legislation, judicially derived standards leave the door open to outlier punitive damages awards, it is hard to see how the judiciary can wash its hands of a problem it created, simply by calling quantified standards legislative.

      - Although the legal landscape is well populated with examples of ratios and multipliers expressing policies of retribution and deterrence, most of them suffer from features that stand in the way of borrowing them as paradigms of reasonable limitations suited for application

        - While a slim majority of the States with a ratio have adopted 3:1, others see fit to apply a lower one, and a few have gone higher.

        - Judgments may differ about the weight to be given to the slight majority of 3:1 States, but one feature of the 3:1 schemes dissuades us from selecting it here.

          - With a few statutory exceptions, generally for intentional infliction of physical injury or other harm, the States with 3:1 ratios apply them across the board (as do other States using different fixed multipliers).

          - That is, the upper limit is not directed to cases like this one, where the tortious action was worse than negligent but less than malicious, exposing the tortfeasor to certain regulatory sanctions and inevitable damage actions; the 3:1 ratio in these States also applies to awards in quite different cases involving some of the most egregious conduct, including malicious behavior and dangerous activity carried on for the purpose of increasing a tortfeasor's financial gain.

        - Here, case of reckless action, profitless to tortfeasors, resulting in substantial recovery for substantial injury

      - For somewhat different reasons, the pertinence of the 2:1 ratio adopted by treble-damages statutes (offering compensatory damages plus a bounty of double that amount) is open to question.

        - Federal treble-damages statutes govern areas far afield from maritime concerns (not to mention each other); the relevance of the governing rules in patent or trademark cases, say, is doubtful at best.

        - And in some instances, we know that the considerations that went into making a rule have no application here.

          - We know, for example, that Congress devised the treble damages remedy for private antitrust actions with an eye to supplementing official enforcement by inducing private litigation, which might otherwise have been too rare if nothing but compensatory damages were available at the end of the day.

        - To take another example, although 18 U. S. C. §3571(d) provides for a criminal penalty of up to twice a crime victim's loss, this penalty is an alternative to other specific fine amounts which courts may impose at their option, see §§3571(a)--(c), a fact that makes us wary of reading too much into Congress's choice of ratio in one provision. State environmental treble-damages schemes offer

        - All in all, the legislative signposts do not point the way clearly to 2:1 as a sound indication of a reasonable limit.

      - There is better evidence of an accepted limit of reason- able civil penalty, however, in several studies mentioned before, showing the median ratio of punitive to compensatory verdicts, reflecting what juries and judges have considered reasonable across many hundreds of punitive awards.

        - Cover cases of the most as well as least blameworthy conduct triggering punitive liability, from malice and avarice, down to recklessness, and even gross negligence in some jurisdictions. The data put the median ratio for the entire gamut of circumstances at less than 1:1, see supra, at 25--26, and n. 14, meaning that the compensatory award exceeds the punitive award in most cases.

        - On these assumptions, a median ratio of punitive to compensatory damages of about 0.65:126 probably marks the line near which cases like this one largely should be grouped.

      - **Accordingly, given the need to protect against the possibility (and the disruptive cost to the legal system) of awards that are unpredictable and unnecessary, either for deterrence or for measured retribution, we consider that a 1:1 ratio, which is above the median award, is a fair upper limit in such maritime cases.**

      - **The provision of the CWA respecting daily fines con- firms our judgment that anything greater would be excessive**

      - **sive here and in cases of this type.**

        - Congress set criminal penalties of up to \$25,000 per day for negligent violations of pollution restrictions, and up to \$50,000 per day for knowing ones.

        - Discretion to double the penalty for knowing action compares to discretion to double the civil liability on conduct going beyond negligence and meriting punitive treatment. And our explanation of the constitutional upper limit confirms that the 1:1 ratio is not too low.

        - In State Farm, we said that a single-digit maximum is appropriate in all but the most exceptional of cases, and "\[w\]hen compensatory damages are substantial, then a lesser ratio, perhaps only equal to compensatory damages, can reach the outermost limit of the due process guarantee."

        - Applying this standard to the present case, we take for granted the District Court's calculation of the total rele- vant compensatory damages at \$507.5 million. See In re Exxon Valdez, 236 F. Supp. 2d 1043, 1063 (D. Alaska 2002). A punitive-to-compensatory ratio of 1:1 thus yields maximum punitive damages in that amount.

### Constitutional limitations

**CRS Summaries**

- *BMW of North America v. Gore*, 517 U.S. 559 (1996)

  - The Court held that a punitive damages award [500]{.underline} times greater than the actual damages awarded violated due process.

  - The Court also established three guideposts by which to determine if a punitive damages award is "grossly excessive" and therefore violates due process:

    - **(1) "the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct,"**

    - **(2) a reasonable ratio of punitive to compensatory damages, and**

    - **(3) comparable civil and criminal sanctions, i.e. "the difference between this remedy and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases."**

  - The *BMW* Court held that the degree of [reprehensibility is the "most important indicum]{.underline} of the reasonableness of a punitive damages award." The Court also determined that a **"high degree of culpability"** was necessary for substantial punitive damages.

  - Additionally, the Court reiterated the plurality's statement in TXO that "the proper inquiry is 'whether there is a reasonable relationship between the punitive damages award and *[the harm likely to result]{.underline}* from the defendant's conduct as well as the harm that actually has occurred.'"

- *State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Campbell,* 538 U.S. 408 (2003).

  - The Court elucidated its punitive damages jurisprudence and overturned a 145-to-1 ratio of punitive to compensatory damages, holding that "**few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages will satisfy due process**"

***[Philip Morris v. Williams]{.underline}*** (2006)

- **Facts**

  - Jesse Williams was a longtime smoker of Marlboro cigarettes, manufactured by Philip Morris

  - Widow sues Philip Morris for negligence and deceit, alleging that Philip Morris knowingly and falsely led the decedent to believe that cigarettes were safe to smoke

  - Jury finds for the plaintiff, awarding \$821K (\$21K economic and \$800K noneconomic) in compensatory damages and \$79.5 million in punitive damages, a roughly 100-to-1 ratio

  - Trial judge says that this is "excessive," reduces to \$32 million. Both sides appeal, Oregon Supreme Court denies review, reaches SCOTUS, which remands in light of *State Farm*

  - Oregon Supreme Court finds for the plaintiff, defendant appeals, with two arguments

    - 1\) Trial Court's instructions to the jury were incorrect; should have instructed that **cannot award punitive damages for impact of alleged misconduct on other persons, who can bring their own lawsuits in which other juries can resolve claims**

    - 2\) Damages award is excessive; 100-to-1 violates *BMW* and *State Farm* -- latter said that single digit multipliers comport with Due Process and therefore this is "grossly excessive"

- **Issue**

  - Whether the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution permits a jury to base punitive damages awards in part upon its desire to *punish* the defendant for harming persons who are not before the court (victims whom the parties do not represent).

- **Holding**

  - No. Punitive damages awards intended to punish the defendant for harming outside parties amount to a "taking" of property from the defendant without Due Process, thus violating the Fifth Amendment

- **Reasoning**

  - While punitive damages may be imposed to further a State's legitimate interests in punishing unlawful conduct and deterring repetition, awards cannot be arbitrary

    - Punitive damages may deprive a defendant of "fair notice" of the severity of the penalty that a State may impose

    - May be "arbitrary punishments" that reflect not an application of law but a decisionmaker's caprice

    - Where awards are large, may impose on State's "policy choice" as to the condition under which or whether certain products can be sold upon neighboring states with different public policies

  - Court has found that the Constitution imposes certain limits, in respect both to procedure and amount, on punitive damages

  - **The Constitution's Due Process Clause forbids a state to use punitive damages to punish a defendant for injury that it inflicts upon nonparties or those whom they directly represent -- ie, strangers to the litigation**

    - 1\) The Due Process Clause prohibits a state from punishing an individual without providing that individual with an opportunity to present every available defense

      - **However, a party threatened with punishment for injuring a nonparty has no opportunity to defend against this charge**

    - 2\) To permit punishment for injuring a non-party would add a near standard-less dimension to the punitive damages equation -- trial will not answer questions like how many other victims there were, how seriously they were injured, etc

    - 3\) No authority supports the use of punitive damages awards for the purpose of punishing a defendant for harming others

      - Appropriate to consider **potential** harm caused, but [only to the plaintiff]{.underline}

  - It is acceptable for the plaintiff to show harm to other victims to prove reprehensibility -- this is ok

    - Evidence can help to show that the conduct also posed substatntial risk of harm to public

    - However, that doesn't mean the jury can consider it when imposing punitive damages, thus directly punishing them for it

  - Given risk of unfairness, it is conssitutionally important to provide assurance that jury will ask the right questions

  - And given risk of **arbitrariness**, concern for **adequate notice**, and **risk that, in practice, punitive damages can impose on states' competing policy interests**, it's important that states avoid procedure that unnecessarily deprives juries of proper legal guidance...

    - Therefore determine that **the Due Process Clause requires states to provide assurance that juries are not asking the wrong question -- ie, seeking not simply to determine reprehensibility, but to punish for harm caused strangers**

  - Respondent also argues that the Oregon Supreme Court did not authorize punitive damages awards based upon punishment for harm caused to nonparties

    - Not the case -- the opinion makes clear that the Oregon Supreme Court interpreted *State Farm* to mean

      - 1\) that the SCOTUS held only that jury could nto base award upon "dissimilar" acts of a defendant,

        - **True, saying so now**

      - 2\) that if jury cannot punish for the conduct, difficult to see why it may consider it at all, and

        - **Due Process Clause prohibits it. While can determine reprehensibility, above reasons indicate why bad to allow punishment for harm to non-parties**

      - 3\) it is unclear how a jury could "consider" harm to others yet withhold that consideration from the punishment calculus

        - **State courts can't authorize procedures that create unreasonable or unnecessary risk of this happening (seems like they thought Philip Morris' instructions were accurate)**

**Who gets punitive damages \$**

- NPR story says that the state of Oregon will get 60% of punitive damages for state fund to compensate crime victims

# **CLASS ACTIONS**

**Rule 23 -- Class Actions**

- **A. Prerequisites**. One or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of all members only if:

  - the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable;

  - there are questions of law or fact common to the class;

  - the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and

  - the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.

- **B. Types of Class Actions**. A class action may be maintained if Rule 23(a) is satisfied and if:

  - prosecuting separate actions by or against individual class members would create a risk of:

    - inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual class members that would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the party opposing the class; or

    - adjudications with respect to individual class members that, as a practical matter, would be dispositive of the interests of the other members not parties to the individual adjudications or would substantially impair or impede their ability to protect their interests;

  - the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole; or

  - the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy. The matters pertinent to these findings include:

    - the class members' interests in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions;

    - the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already begun by or against class members;

    - the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum; and

    - the likely difficulties in managing a class action.

***Wal-Mart v. Dukes***

- **Facts:** Named plaintiffs represents 1.5 million members of the certified class of Wal-Mart's current and former female employees, who allege discrimination on the basis of their sex by denying them equal pay or promotions in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964

  - Wal-Mart operates 3,400 stores, employs more than one million people, and pay/promotion decisions at Wal-Mart are generally committed to local manager's broad discretion, which is exercised in a "largely subjective manner"

  - Divided en banc Court of Appeals substantially affirmed the District Court's certification order, concluding that the respondent's evidence of commonality was sufficient to "raise the common question whether Wal-Mart's female employees nationwide were subjected to a single set of corporate policies that may have worked to unlawfully discriminate against them"

- **Issues:** Whether certification of the plaintiff class was consistent with FRCP 23(a) and (b)(2)

- **Holding:**

- **Reasoning**

  - Party seeking certification by FRCP 23 must first demonstrate that

    - 1\) Class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impractical

    - 2\) There are questions of law or fact common to the class

    - 3\) The claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class

    - 4\) The representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class

  - Second, must satisfy at least one of the three requirements in Rule 23(b). Respondents rely on

    - B2) ...the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole

  - Respondents rely on three forms of proof for evidence that there were questions of law or fact common to all

    - 1\) Statistical evidence about pay and promotion disparities between men and women

    - 2\) Anecdotal reports of discrimination

    - 3\) Testimony of a sociologist who conducted a "social framework analysis of Wal-Mart's culture"

  - Wal-Mart attempted but failed to strike much of this evidence, and also argued that the monetary claims for backpay could not be certified because that Rule refers only to injunctive and declaratory relief, and because backpay claims cannot be manageably tried as a class without depriving Wal-Mart of right to present certain statutory defenses

  - **Class action is an "exception" to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and on behalf of the individual named parties only**

    - Must possess the same interest and suffer the same injury - "numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequate representation"

  - Crux of the case is commonality -- rule requiring a plaintiff to show that there are questions of law or fact common to the class

    - This is easy to misinterpret, because any competently crafted class complaint literally raises "common questions"

      - For example -- do all of us work at Wal-Mart? Do our managers have discretion over pay?

    - **However, commonality requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that the class suffers the same [injury]{.underline}**

      - This does not mean that they have all suffered a violation of the same provision of the law -- Title VII can be violated in many ways

  - **Obviously, the claim by employees of the same company that they have suffered a Title VII injury, or even a disparate impact Title VII injury, gives no cause to believe that all their claims can productively be litigated at once**

    - Must depend on a [common contention]{.underline} -- for example, the assertion of discriminatory bias on the part of the same superior

    - The common contention must be of such a nature that it is capable of [classwide resolution]{.underline} -- ie, the determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of [each one of the claims in one stroke]{.underline}

  - Rule 23 does not set forth a pleading standard. A party seeking class certification must affirmatively demonstrate compliance with the Rule -- that is, he must be prepared to prove that there are [in fact]{.underline} sufficiently numerous parties

  - Frequently that analysis will entail overlap with the merits of the plaintiff's underlying claims. This cannot be helped

  - Nor is there anything unusual about the consequence. The necessity of touching aspects of the merits in order to resolve preliminary matters is a feature of litigation

  - In this case, the proof of commonality necessarily overlaps with the respondents' merits of contention that Wal-Mart engages in a "pattern or practice of discrimination"

    - Here the respondents wish to sue about literally millions of employment decisions at once. Without some glue holding the alleged reasons for all those decisions together, it will be impossible to say that examination of all the class members' claims for relief will produce a common answer

  - **\[ \]**

  - **We also conclude that respondents' claims for backpay were improperly certified under FRCP 23(b)(2). Monetary relief is not incidental to the injunctive or declaratory relief**

    - Rule 23(b)(2) allows class treatment when "the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole"

    - It does not authorize class certification when each individual class member would be entitled to a *different* injunction or declaratory judgment against the defendant, or when each member would receive an individualized award

    - Permitting the combination of individualized and classwide relief in a b2 class is inconsistent with the structure of the Rule

      - Classes certified under b1 and b2 share the most traditional jsutifications for clas treatment -- that individual adjudication would be impossible in a b1 class, or that relief must perforce the entire class at once

    - **B3 is more proper for individualized monetary claims -- it allows class certification in a wider set of circumstances but with greater procedural protections**

- **Justice Ginsburg, Concurring and dissenting in part (with Justices Kagan, Sotomayor, Breyer)**

  - The Court's emphasis on differences between class members mimics the Rule 23(b)(3) inquiry into whether common questions "predominate" over individual issues. And by asking whether the individual differences "impede" common adjudication, ante, at 10 (internal quotation marks omitted), the Court duplicates 23(b)(3)'s question whether "a class action is superior" to other modes of adjudication.

## **Rule 23 -- *[Park v. Shell Oil]{.underline}***

***[Parko v. Shell Oil]{.underline}*** (7th Cir. 2014)

- Numerosity requirement doesn't require that every single member of the putative class have sustained an injury to get class certification

- Processs would require 150 (in this case) trials to determine whether or not class could be certified -- asking to "put the cart before the horse"

  - **How many of the class members have a valid claim is the issue to be determined *after* the class is certified**

- However, predominance is a qualitiative, not a quantitative concept -- when determining whether an issue is common or "predominates" over the entire class, determine not by counting noses

  - Although can't simply "assert" that common issues predominate, court should receive evidence and resolve the dispute before deciding (?)

- **Predominance is not a pleading requirement -- need to demonstrate proof, not just intention**

  - Need to investigate the realism of the plaintiff's injury and damage model

**Rule 23 -- Class Actions**

- [(c) Certification Order; Notice to Class Members; Judgment; Issues Classes; Subclasses.]{.underline}

- 1\) Certification Order.

  - Time to Issue. At an early practicable time after a person sues or is sued as a class representative, the court must determine by order whether to certify the action as a class action.

  - Defining the Class; Appointing Class Counsel. An order that certifies a class action must define the class and the class claims, issues, or defenses, and must appoint class counsel under Rule 23(g).

  - Altering or Amending the Order. An order that grants or denies class certification may be altered or amended before final judgment.

- 2\) Notice.

  - For (b)(1) or (b)(2) Classes. For any class certified under Rule 23(b)(1) or (b)(2), the court may direct appropriate notice to the class.

  - For (b)(3) Classes. For any class certified under Rule 23(b)(3), the court must direct to class members the best notice that is practicable under the circumstances, including individual notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort. The notice must clearly and concisely state in plain, easily understood language:

    - the nature of the action;

    - the definition of the class certified;

    - the class claims, issues, or defenses;

    - that a class member may enter an appearance through an attorney if the member so desires;

    - that the court will exclude from the class any member who requests exclusion;

    - the time and manner for requesting exclusion; and

    - the binding effect of a class judgment on members under Rule 23(c)(3).

- 3\) Judgment. Whether or not favorable to the class, the judgment in a class action must:

  - for any class certified under Rule 23(b)(1) or (b)(2), include and describe those whom the court finds to be class members; and

  - for any class certified under Rule 23(b)(3), include and specify or describe those to whom the Rule 23(c)(2) notice was directed, who have not requested exclusion, and whom the court finds to be class members.

- **4) Particular Issues. When appropriate, an action may be brought or maintained as a class action with respect to particular issues.**

- **5) Subclasses. When appropriate, a class may be divided into subclasses that are each treated as a class under this rule.**

**Limited issue class actions**

- There is, however, a growing trend that impacts this delicate balance and is changing how many class actions are litigated, and the tactics and strategies employed by all parties. Plaintiffs, and some courts, have increasingly pointed to Rule 23(c)(4)1 to certify what are called "limited issue" classes. **Rule 23(c)(4) provides that, "when appropriate, an action may be brought or maintained as a class action with respect to particular issues."2 Limited issue certification under this Rule seeks to isolate an issue (or certain issues) for class treatment even if class members' claim for liability or recovery might ultimately be adjudicated individually.** The separation of individual issues not capable of class-wide resolution allows a class action to move forward even when it would not survive examination under the mandate of Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance test3 -- which requires common issues in the class action as a whole to predominate over issues that would require individualized adjudication.4

- While the potential for limited issue classes has been around for a while, it gained increased attention in light of the Supreme Court's decision in Wal-Mart v. Dukes, which brought teeth back to Rule 23(a)'s commonality requirement, many commentators viewed the case as a real threat to class certification.5 As the Court held, "\[w\]hat matters to class certification ... is not the raising of common 'questions' -- even in droves -- but, rather, the capacity of a classwide proceeding to generate common answers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation."6 Some commentators were concerned that the Dukes decision threatened the very viability of class actions.7

- These concerns may have been overstated, but it has caused some **commentators to advocate for limited issue class certification under Rule 23(c)(4) as a way to promote the continued viability of class actions. For example, Professor John C. Coffee has said, "the best hope for survival of the class action in money damages cases may lie in the expansion of issue class certification under Rule 23(c)(4)."8 Under Professor Coffee's view, partial certification is a process whereby "the defendant's liability could be established at the class trial."**9 Then, "individual issues, such as reliance, proximate causation, or damages could be established in separate proceedings."10 Other commentators stress that this approach goes too far, and is inconsistent with federal law.11

- Several courts have interpreted Rule 23(c)(4) to permit the bifurcation of class issues and certain issues that must be resolved on an individual basis in a Rule 23(b)(3) damages class. However, courts have disagreed on the proper scope and interpretation of the Rule.

- **Until recently, the Fifth Circuit in Castano v. American Tobacco rejected the use of Rule 23(c)(4) to overcome (b)(3)'s predominance requirement: "Severing the defendants' conduct from reliance under rule 23(c)(4) does not save the class action. A district court cannot manufacture predominance through the nimble use of subdivision (c)(4). The proper interpretation of the interaction between subdivisions (b)(3) and (c)(4) is that ... (c)(4) is a housekeeping rule that allows courts to sever the common issues for a class trial."**12 Notably, the Fifth Circuit's more recent decision in In re Deepwater Horizon, has been cited as a retreat from Castano and evidence of a more expansive approach, stating that Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance requirement can still be met if the proceedings are structured to establish "liability on a class-wide basis, with separate hearings to determine---if liability is established---the damages of individual class members."13 Of course, separating the damages inquiry alone for individualized treatment is distinct from having mini-trials on issues of, for example, reliance or causation.

- **Other circuits have been more supportive of limited issue class certification, although circuits have different approaches to determine when it is appropriate to certify a Rule 23(c)(4) class action that could not be certified under Rule 23(b)(3**). The Second Circuit held in In re Nassau County Strip Search Cases that "a court may employ subsection (c)(4) to certify a class as to liability regardless of whether the claim as a whole satisfies Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance requirement."14 The Second Circuit employed a material advancement standard, determining whether issue certification would "reduce the range of issues in dispute and promote judicial economy."15 The Third Circuit applies factors set forth in the American Legal Institute's Principles of the Law of Aggregate Litigation16 to determine whether certification of an issue class is proper. Courts are instructed to consider factors such as "the type of claim and issue in question; the overall complexity of the case; the efficiencies to be gained by granting partial certification; the substantive law underlying the claim,"17 and more. Finally, the Seventh Circuit held that if a proposed class action contains "genuinely common issues, issues identical across all the claimants ... the accuracy of the resolution of which is unlikely to be enhanced by repeated proceedings, then it makes good sense, especially when the class is large, to resolve those issues in one fell swoop while leaving the remaining, claimant-specific issues to individual follow-on proceedings."18

**Settlements**

**Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 23**

- **(e) Settlement, Voluntary Dismissal, or Compromise.** The claims, issues, or defenses of a certified class may be settled, voluntarily dismissed, or compromised [only with the court's approval]{.underline}. The following procedures apply to a proposed settlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise:

  - The court must direct notice in a reasonable manner to all class members who would be bound by the proposal.

  - If the proposal would bind class members, the court may approve it only after a hearing and on finding that it is fair, reasonable, and adequate.

  - The parties seeking approval must file a statement identifying any agreement made in connection with the proposal.

  - If the class action was previously certified under Rule 23(b)(3), the court may refuse to approve a settlement unless it affords a new opportunity to request exclusion to individual class members who had an earlier opportunity to request exclusion but did not do so.

  - Any class member may object to the proposal if it requires court approval under this subdivision (e); the objection may be withdrawn only with the court's approval.

**NFL**

- As part of the deal, the N.F.L. insisted that all retired players --- not just the 5,000 or so who sued the league --- be covered by the settlement as a way to fend off lawsuits in the future. But about 200 players, including Junior Seau, who committed suicide and was later found to have a degenerative brain disease, opted out of the settlement to preserve their right to continue fighting the league.

- Critics of the settlement said that even after the revisions, the number and variety of diseases covered by the deal were too small and that many players would receive only a small fraction of the multimillion-dollar payouts promised by the league after their age and years in the N.F.L. were considered. Critics also contended that the settlement needed to acknowledge more classes of plaintiffs, not only those with diagnosable diseases and those without them.

**VW**

- About 475,000 Volkswagen owners in the U.S. can choose between a **buyback or a free fix and compensation**, if a repair becomes available. VW will begin administering the settlement immediately, having already devoted several hundred employees to handling the process.

- \"The priority was to get the polluting cars off the road as soon as possible. The settlement does that,\" Breyer said in his ruling, adding that even \"under heightened scrutiny\" the deal is laudable.

- Buybacks range in value from \$12,475 to \$44,176, including restitution payments, and vary based on mileage. People who opt for a fix approved by the Environmental Protection Agency will receive payouts ranging from \$5,100 to \$9,852, depending on the book value of their car.

- Volkswagen will also pay \$2.7 billion for environmental mitigation and another \$2 billion for clean-emissions infrastructure.

- Deal backers include a class action group of consumers, the EPA, the California Air Resources Board and the Federal Trade Commission, which assailed VW over the company\'s \"false\" advertisements marketing its smog-spewing diesels as \"clean diesel.\"

- EPA and the California board took action after a study by the International Council on Clean Transportation and West Virginia University exposed differences in the emissions performance of the vehicles.

- Approval marks an \"important milestone in our journey to making things right in the United States, and we appreciate the efforts of all parties involved in this process,\" VW U.S. CEO Hinrich J. Woebcken said in a statement. \"Volkswagen is committed to ensuring that the program is now carried out as seamlessly as possible for our affected customers and has devoted significant resources and personnel to making their experience a positive one.\"

- **The company has also agreed to a \$1.2 billion settlement with dealers over the same matter.**

- **Meanwhile, VW is negotiating a separate settlement with more than 80,000 owners of 3-liter diesel vehicles fitted with similar software. Breyer will hold a hearing Nov. 3 to get updates on those talks.**

- More than 336,000 of the eligible VW 2-liter owners have already registered for the settlement, though they could back out if VW can\'t come up with a fix by Oct. 30, 2017. The company has yet to receive approval from the Environmental Protection Agency, and if it fails to do so, owners will have only the buyback route.

- VW plaintiffs attorney Elizabeth Cabraser told Judge Breyer last week that the deal \"set a land speed record --- probably an air speed record as well.\"

- Fewer than 1% of eligible VW owners opted out of the deal before September deadline. People who did not respond are automatically considered to have taken the offer.

- **Attorneys who negotiated the settlement will receive up to \$324 million in compensation, according to a court filing.**

- About two dozen VW owners objected to the deal during an Oct. 18 hearing. Most of the objections boiled down to complaints over the amount of the payout, while some critics also lambasted the automaker\'s \"clean diesel\" advertising and purposeful environmental pollution.

- But Breyer rejected all of those arguments in his ruling. The assertion that compensation should not be pegged to a vehicle\'s mileage ignores the fact that people \"who frequently drove their vehicles undeniably got more use out of them,\" he said.

- \"The number of objections is small, and their substance does not call into doubt the settlement's fairness,\" he ruled.

**Subway sandwiches, "Footlong"**

- Theodore Frank objected. A class member and profes- sional objector to hollow class-action settlements, see, e.g., In re Walgreen Co. Stockholder Litig., 832 F.3d 718 (7th Cir. 2016), Frank argued that the settlement enriched only the lawyers and provided no meaningful benefits to the class. The judge was not persuaded. He certified the proposed class and approved the settlement. Frank appealed.

- **We reverse. A class action that "seeks only worthless benefits for the class" and "yields \[only\] fees for class coun- sel" is "no better than a racket" and "should be dismissed out of hand." Id. at 724. That's an apt description of this case.**

## **Multi-district litigation**

**Who decides whether my case will be consolidated into an MDL?**

- The Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation. The MDL Panel is comprised of seven federal district court judges appointed by the chief justice. They decide whether to consolidate your case with other similar cases and, if so, to which court and judge to transfer the cases.

**What's the point of MDL?**

- Congress created the MDL Panel in 1968 to relieve federal court backlog. 28 U.S.C. 1407. The purpose was to streamline pretrial proceedings and avoid the duplication of discovery by joining similar cases into one action.

**Do I have any say in whether my case is moved into an MDL?**

- Yes, but you have to act quickly. You have 20 days to file a brief---limited to 20 pages---in response to a motion to transfer. The matter will then be set on the MDL hearing docket. If the MDL Panel has already established an MDL for a particular set of cases, your case can be transferred by means of a "tag-along" notice with no hearing, unless you object within 15 days.

**What factors does the MDL Panel consider?**

- The MDL Panel considers three factors: 1) whether there are one or more common questions of fact; 2) whether the transfer is for the convenience of all of the parties involved; and 3) whether the transfer will promote judicial efficiency, economy, and fairness.

**How does the MDL Panel decide where to transfer the cases?**

- While the MDL Panel has the authority to transfer the case to any district, it often selects a district with a currently pending case. The MDL Panel will usually select the most convenient forum for most of the parties and witnesses involved.

**What about all those pesky forum rules, like personal jurisdiction, venue, and forum-selection issues?**

- Normal considerations relating to choice of forum do not limit the MDL Panel in selecting the court to which to transfer the matters. As should be apparent, the MDL process can quickly and drastically change the posture of an existing case.

**Which circuit's law applies once my case gets transferred?**

- That's a hard one. The case law is not consistent on that point.

**Is there an upside to this for my client? Should I file an MDL motion?**

- Possibly. If your client is litigating essentially the same case in many different courts, an MDL can streamline discovery and ensure greater consistency in pretrial rulings. The transferee court may be more favorably disposed to your arguments than was the home district.

**Will my class action ever come home again?**

- The statute states that a transferred action "shall be remanded" at the end of pretrial proceedings to the district from which it came. **In practice, few cases are remanded for trial to the original forum.** The MDL Panel has some interesting statistics about the remand rate on its website.
