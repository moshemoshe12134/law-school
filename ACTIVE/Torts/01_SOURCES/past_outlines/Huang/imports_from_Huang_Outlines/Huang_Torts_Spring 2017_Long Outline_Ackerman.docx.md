# 1. Big Concepts 

## 1.1 Nature and Functions of Tort Law

1)  **Torts** -- concerns the rights of private parties to obtain monetary compensation from those who have caused with injury or damage. Kind of: "A civil wrong not arising out of a contract"

    a)  **Accident law:** "Standard of Care" whose breach results in liability

        i)  **Strict liability:** imposed without regard to the degree of care that the defendant exercised.

        ii) **Negligence liability:** imposed only upon proof of some kind of carelessness

    b)  **Intentional torts:** liability is not imposed for negligence, but only upon proof of the defendant's intention to invade the legally protected interest of another.

2)  Four elements of any cause of action:

    a)  Duty

    b)  Breach of Duty

    c)  Causation

    d)  Damages/Harm

3)  **Four features of tort law**:

    a)  **Jury trial** -- Right to trial by jury in almost all tort cases

    b)  **Liability insurance** -- Availability of insurance influences the decision whether to sue and whom to sue

        i)  The more tort liability expanded, the more liability insurance became available

        ii) Often tort law expanded because liability insurance was or could be expected to become available

    c)  **Contingent fee system**

        i)  A plaintiff's attorney receives a percentage of the plaintiff's recovery if the suit is successful, and charges nothing if the suit is unsuccessful.

        ii) Affects the selection of cases in which suit is brought.

    d)  **"American Rule" for costs**

        i)  Each party pays its own costs, including counsel fees, win or lose

        ii) Plaintiffs are less discouraged from bringing suit because they do not risk incurring sizeable personal cost if they lose their suits.

## 1.2 Aims of Tort Law

1)  **Corrective justice & Civil Recourse (Fairness):** Individual injurer directly compensates individual victim with injurer's own money.

    a)  **Corrective justice:** restoring the moral balance between wrong-doer and the victim (injustice corrected)

        i)  **Critique:** less applicable in modern times with faceless corporations and liability insurance

        ii) Various opinions on importance, largely because defendants are typically large corporations or individuals with insurance

            (1) Large corporations: shareholders, employees, or customers may bear cost of compensating victims

            (2) Liability insurance: injurer's paid premiums are what she pays in compensation to the victim.

    b)  **Civil recourse:** tort law is a way of providing victims with recourse for civil wrongs

        i)  Some argue that tort liability is better understood not as ensuring injustice is corrected, but as providing redress for civil wrongdoings.

        ii) Under this view, the imposition of liability is a complex social practice that recognizes the occurrence of a wrongfully caused injury and vindicates victims' need for recognition that they have been wronged.

    c)  Both corrective justice & civil recourse conceptions understand tort law as mainly concerned with the moral relationship with between the plaintiff and defendant (ex-post) rather than that of future actors (ex-ante).

    d)  **Compensation**: principal function sometimes considered promotion of compensation for sufferer

        i)  *Why not:* Desirability of providing compensation to a particular class of injury victims rarely explains the lines drawn to distinguish those who are and those who are not entitled to prevail in a tort claim.

        ii) *Instead:* Liability is not imposed in order to provide compensation to victims; rather, they are provided compensation to serve other goals of tort law, corrective justice and deterrence.

        iii) **Pros:** Makes people feel more secure that they will be compensated

        iv) **Cons:** We need injury to justify liability, so there needs to be more than just one goal of compensation

2)  **Instrumental, Ex-Ante Framework**

    a)  **Optimal deterrence:** deter *excessively* risky activity so that only those losses worth avoiding are avoided.

        i)  Deterring certain losses is not worth what it would take to deter them.

            (1) Virtually every activity poses some risk, and up to a point, tort law threatens liability for risky activity, but beyond that point it does not, and the law tolerates the losses that result.

            (2) Some losses are worth avoiding (those caused by negligence) and some (those caused without negligence) are not worth avoiding.

        ii) Nothing in the principle of optimal deterrence dictates what values should be taken into account in determining which losses are and which losses are not worth deterring.

        iii) **Pros:** Economic solution, just enough deterrence to prevent risks not worth taking, but not too much to require foregoing some of the benefit of that activity.

        iv) **Cons:** Only takes into consideration economic values and ignores human values; pain & suffering from accident shouldn't be reduced to economic value of what it takes to prevent it.

    b)  **Loss distribution:** Inclination to develop rules of law that permit imposition of tort liability on businesses and institutions that can distribute their liabilities through the purchase of insurance or by raising the price of their products or services.

        i)  **Pros:** Large people bearing small cost \> single person bearing all of it

        ii) **Cons:** (1) does not satisfy sense of moral blame; (2) tort law expensive mechanism for distributing losses

    c)  **Redress of social grievances**: view that right to sue in tort promotes redress of social grievances, particularly against large, impersonal institutions.

        i)  In this view, tort law is a populist mechanism that permits ordinary people to put authority on trial.

3)  **Competing Aims:**

    a)  Deterrence (defendant-based) v. Compensation (plaintiff-based)

    b)  Blame-worthiness (defendant-based) v. Fairness (plaintiff-based)

    c)  Risk-spreading (defendant-based) v. Social welfare (plaintiff-based)

4)  **Summary: A mixed system**

    a)  Tort law operates to serve a set of goals whose strength is likely to vary with the situation. In some cases, concern for corrective justice will dominate, but in others, deterrence or concern for loss distribution will be the key.

\*\*\*The justice of tort law is at its heart corrective, rather than punitive.

**[Extra Recovery?]{.underline}**

\*\*\*Tort law does not aim to deter all harmful or risky behavior. Rather, it accepts that some injury or risk is necessary in society. But to maintain this principle, the level of deterrence must be proportional to the risk created. Imposing the full recovery against each defendant, regardless of their particular degree of fault, would likely cause society to be overly cautious, and deter behaviors that are necessary to society.

\*\*\*Similarly, a disproportionate recovery scheme would provide adverse incentives to plaintiffs.

The windfall possible in such cases could potentially cause a floodgate of litigation for plaintiffs

who have potential claims against multiple defendants. Thus, such a policy would cause society

to not only be overly cautious, but also overly litigious.

## 1.3 Elements of a Tort: (1) Breach of Duty; (2) Causation; (3) Strict Liability; (4) Damages/Injury

1)  **Breach of Duty:** failure to comply with the applicable standard of care

    a)  **Negligence**: failure to take care that reasonable person would under the circumstances.

        i)  Standard: BPL

            (1) Always consider if there were alternatives available.

        ii) Method: Always start with identifying the negligent action (this becomes the "burden" in BPL)

        iii) Question: Objective v. Subjective

             (1) Physical disability? Children? Doing an adult activity? Expertise? Emergency doctrine?

        iv) Shortcuts:

            (1) Negligence per se (statutes) -- violation = liability, no safe harbor.

            (2) Customs -- not dispositive 🡪 consider setting industry standards

            (3) Medical standards (mandatory, and create safe harbor if met)

        v)  Defenses: Comparative negligence or Contributory negligence (MD)

            (1) Pure comparative (CA) v. modified comparative? (WI)

            (2) Assumption of risk?

    b)  **Affirmative Duties:** taking care during the rescue

        i)  Duty to warn: if you cause the harm, you should at least warn.

        ii) Failure to warn: adequate instructions or warnings.

            (1) Must instruct and warn about possible consequences; label clutter

        iii) Informed consent: medical standard

        iv) Special relationships: parents or psychiatrists (duty to warn)

2)  **Causation:**

    a)  Factual causation

        i)  "But For" causation

        ii) Multiple sufficient causes 🡪 non-tortious cause?

        iii) Multiple necessary causes

        iv) "Joint" tortfeasors (jointly -- all agree to do a tort -- conduct OR indivisible harm)

        v)  Proof problems

            (1) Preponderance of evidence standard

            (2) Alternative liability ([Summers v. Tice]{.underline}), shifts burden on defendant to prove themselves not liable

            (3) Market share liability

        vi) Harm: lost chance (harm is redefined as lost chance of survival rather than death) -- gets around "but for" causation, but scope is limited

        vii) Allocation of damages: (1) Joint and several; (2) Several

    b)  Legal causation / Proximate Cause

        i)  Scope of risk: harm within the risk

        ii) Pertinant considerations

            (1) Type of harm (usually breaks chain\....)

3)  **Strict Liability:**

4)  **Damages/Injury:**

5)  **Policy Considerations:**

## 1.4 Themes of Tort Law

### 1.4.i Who decides? (Court v. Legislature)

1)  Courts 🡪 Incremental change, creates change case-by-case

    a)  Judges - law

        i)  Experience?; Knowledge of rules 🡪 decide questions of law; Consistency; Individual biases

    b)  Jury - fact

        i)  Democratic, jury of peers; Expertise? Questionable\...; Good reflection of societal preferences/desires/expectations; Inconsistent / unpredictable?

2)  Legislatures 🡪 Not piecemeal, more comprehensive change & can overrule courts with statutes

    a)  Institutional competency?; Better information and more research?

    b)  Democratic decisions to create law. More trust and legitimacy?

3)  Possible methods:

    a)  Court leaves to legislature, follows case precedent, no new law

    b)  Court acts over legislature ([Li v. Yellow Taxi Cab]{.underline}) or interprets statute to give courts more leeway

    c)  Court can defer/not defer to legislature

    d)  Court can decide to extend/change/apply common law

#### [Hammontree v. Jenner]{.underline} (CA 1971): Seizure; Sudden illness inappropriate for strict liability

**Gist**: Jenner (D) has epileptic seizure and runs car into Hammontree's (P) shop. He had a long history of seizures, but his doctor approved his driver's license. Last seizure 1953, now 1967 though\... **Proc. Hist:** Judge issued jury instruction on *res ipsa*, and jury found for D. P appealed asking for an instruction on strict liability.

**Rule:** Sudden illness rendering a driver unconscious will not be grounds for an action in [negligence]{.underline} or [strict liability]{.underline}.

**Issue:** Is strict liability in tort a proper theory to apply to sudden illnesses that renders a driver unconscious? *No.*

**Court:** held that it was proper not to offer an instruction on absolute liability, and thus affirmed judgment for Jenner (D) because he had taken his seizure medications and behaved in a reasonable manner.

**Analysis:** If he had constructive or actual notice of onset of serious illness, negligence may be found.

**Notes:**

1)  Holmes

    a)  Critical of strict liability. Believes in requirement that the defendant should have made a choice or action.

    b)  "State interference is an evil, where it cannot be shown to be a good."

    c)  Believes in private insurance and only imposing liability due to a fault based on action/choice

2)  Posner

    a)  Looks for the most cost-justified levels of accidents and safety

    b)  Where the measures necessary to avert the accidents would have consumed excessive resources, there is no occasion to condemn the defendant for not having taken them.

3)  *Maloney v. Rath*

    a)  Court refused to hold defendant strictly liable for her non-negligent violation of the traffic law (brake failure due to her garage mechanic's negligence)

    b)  However, she was held criminally liable because statutorily it was her duty to maintain operable car

- Three types of arguments & when they are effective:

  - **Human** (may be more attractive to jury):

    - Who is more blameworthy? Who can pay? Bear the losses with the least trouble?

    - Shared blame or innocent victim?

  - **Policy** (good for judge & jury)?

    - What is easy, less costly to administer? What activities, precautions do we want to encourage, discourage?

  - **Legalistic** (attractive to judge)

    - Easy default rule? Follow precedent.

### 1.4.ii Rules v. Standards (see also below)

1)  How much tailoring do you do? And how do you tailor?

2)  Rules: constraining and rigid.

    a)  Once interrupted and the facts are found, application of rule to the facts decides the issue to which it is relevant (e.g. 5 year old children are not negligent).

3)  Standards: intermediate level of constraint

    a)  Guide decisions but provide range of choice or discretion

    b)  Learned Hand: Standards define a set of mandatory considerations.

4)  Example: Railroad crossings for drivers

    a)  Holmes: argues that drivers must stop and look (rule, get out of car)

    b)  Cardozo: argues for standard (drivers must be reasonable)

## 1.5 Economic Theories of Torts

### 1.5.i Calebresi Aims of Tort Law (Cheapest Cost Avoider)

1)  Goal of tort law is to find the [cheapest cost avoider]{.underline}, and to make that person pay the costs.

    a)  Aim is optimal deterrence 🡪 minimize cost to society

    b)  Injury cost (cost to victim) + precaution cost (cost of activity)

    c)  Try to internalize all of the externalities

2)  Who is the cheapest cost avoider

    a)  **Cheapest Cost Avoider #1: [Best knowledge \*]{.underline}**

        i)  Stick liability on person who (1) knows risks/harm (who will be hurt and to what extent); (2) knows precautions available; (3) knows the tort law (needs to know that they are liable)

        ii) Problems with CCA 1: Morality, blameworthiness, social norms, distribution, risk spreading are not considered by CCA (school shouldn't pay for factory's pollution, almost seems like you are sticking liability on the more responsible party) AND no stability because who gets stuck with liability depends completely on volatile factors like technology

    b)  **Cheapest Cost Avoider #2:** **[Best bargainer]{.underline}**

        i)  Best briber is one who faces lowest transaction costs, based on Coase Theorem

        ii) Factors: (1) who knows the risks; (2) who knows how to reduce the risks?; (3) who knows where they will be liable?

    c)  ["But for" causation]{.underline} sweeps all candidates in, [proximate cause]{.underline} is the tool to implement the idea of CCA\< assigns liability to the CCA

        i)  BP Case (no causation) -- we want causation in fact for optimal deterrence b/c causation makes sure that precaution taken would have made a difference, don't want ppl just spending precaution money that makes no difference in other ppl's harms (waste) 🡪 many tortfeasors have limited resources, so only spend \$ on things that make a difference to people

        ii) Proximate Cause/HWR -- we have tort law for certain types of harm, that is what we assign liability for, we can't prevent freak accidents, harm has to be foreseeable, people can't take precautions they don't know about

    d)  **Calabresi** [Compensation goals]{.underline} (backward looking -- ex-post)

        i)  Spreading of losses/costs via insurance and mutual insurance to promote societal distribution of losses

        ii) Wealth distribution -- deep pockets should pay:

            (1) Better able to bear the costs (form of thinking about insurance)

            (2) Diminishing marginal utility of money 🡪 better to tax rich

            (3) More \$ means more power to control things = more responsibility

        iii) We are still uncomfortable with a disconnect with the physical connection; **causation doesn't matter** when we are just concerned with distribution or deep pockets (same as taxes)

        iv) **Fairness/Deterrence:** Person should only pay if at fault. Need to deter people form dangerous conduct, rich people can't just pay.

    e)  **Calabresi** [Deterrence goals]{.underline} (forward looking -- ex-ante) (negligence is CCA, not bad fault creator)

        i)  Efficient deterrence: minimize the sum of injury costs and safety (precaution) costs as well

        ii) **Specific deterrence** (regulation): regulations to control behavior (bans)

            (1) We do not need to know the exact causation

            (2) Not as economically efficient compared to general because it does not account for different situations such as changing technology and circumstances

        iii) **General deterrence** (price/tax): increases the price of certain activities such as carbon tax

             (1) **Works through causation**: A link between behavior and the harm -- we can generate the proper price and tax to achieve the right amount of deterrence.

             (2) **Forseeability matters more for this** because we can measure the right price that leads to the proper amount of deterrence (and not lead to over-deterrence or under-deterrence)

                 (a) You need to foresee the amount of harm in order to impose a proper amount of price or taxation to deter that behavior in an efficient manner

                 (b) Internalize the costs

             (3) Price mechanism makes it more efficient to adopt cheapest choice

                 (a) People can adopt a more efficient (cheaper) choice when there's no regulation

        iv) Controls both [*care levels* and *activity levels*]{.underline} 🡪 if the harm costs \$100 and the business is \$90, then it will shut down. *Care level* affects both the harm causer and the potential victim; *activity level* only controls the harm causer's behavior

**[Aims of CCA:]{.underline}**

1.  Minimize sum of accident costs and precaution costs.

2.  Assign loss to those who can most cheaply manage the risk.

    a.  Those who have information best know the risk

    b.  CCA forces information sharing → incentivizes Trolley Co. to share dangers with pedestrians.

3.  What's missing?

    a.  For incentives to work, parties must know that tort law places liability on CCA.

    b.  Idea of blameworthiness/morality

    c.  Risk spreading (maybe Trolley Co., can absorb financial burden of precaution better)

    d.  Combinations of precautions

    e.  Punitive damages

### 1.5.ii Coase Theory -- Function of Law

1)  Coase Theory:

    a)  Definition: When there are no transaction costs, regardless of where liability is placed, the parties will bargain to get the cheapest, most optimal solution (school with giant fan and factory with scrubbers)

    b)  Questions the **purpose of law**? Do we need law at all if society will achieve most cost efficient result?

2)  Critiques and Limitations of Coase Theorem

    a)  Assumes that there are no transaction costs, which is unrealistic (and difficult with multiple parties)

        i)  Coase works when there is good bargaining ability:

            (1) Sophisticated parties who know how to negotiate

            (2) Parties have pre-existing relationships

            (3) Fewer parties

            (4) Harms are easily monetized

        ii) Role of Law: If transaction costs are too high, law is very important

    b)  Also have problem when there is **information asymmetry**

    c)  Ignores distributional consequences: fairness, fault, etc.

        i)  Coase works when bargaining power is equal: 2 big businesses

        ii) Role of law: where we stick liability, that party must bribe or pay, so law attempts to place liability on CCA (either party that knows more, or best briber), which creates an incentive for person stuck with liability to actually find the CCA.

![](media/image18.png){width="7.5in" height="2.661111111111111in"}

#### [Brown v. Kendall]{.underline} (MA 1851): Dog-fight, stick in eye; Apply ordinary care to both 'case' and 'trespass'

**Facts:** Kendall (D), while attempting to separate his dog from Brown's (P) dog when the two dogs were fighting, accidentally struck Brown (P) in the eye with a stick. P brought action of *trespass*.

**PH:** TC required extraordinary care from Kendall (D) to escape liability, and ordinary care on part of Brown (P)

**Court (Shaw):** changes standard of behavior to **ordinary care** for both case and trespass.

- Burden is on the plaintiff to prove lack of ordinary care.

**Dicta**: plaintiff must also take ordinary care, or no recovery. Only recovery if plaintiff took care AND defendant did not take care (*Contributory negligence*)

**Analysis:** established that some form of fault, negligent or intentional, must form the basis of liability.

**Note** (Gregory): had incentive to make risk-creating less hazardous to investors than it had been at common law for the purpose of the industrial revolution.

- *Contributory negligence*: behavior on part of injured plaintiff falling below standard of ordinary care that contributes to the defendant's negligence, resulting in the plaintiff's injury.

**KA Notes**: Creates separate actions based on plaintiff proving that there was either intent to injure or negligence, whether the action is brought in trespass or in case (so intent was in addition to direct-ness). Further, there is possibility for situations where standard should be extraordinary care.

#### 

#### [Adams v. Bullock]{.underline} (NY 1919): Trolley wires below bridge; RPS only need to protect against foreseeable accidents

**Facts:** Bullock (D) operated a trolley line, the wires for which ran under a bridge. Adams (P) received a shock while crossing the bridge when a wire he was carrying made contact with the trolley wires. **TC/COA**: in favor of P.

**Rule:** A party will not be deemed negligent if it has taken reasonable precautions to avoid predictable dangers.

**Issue:** Should a party be considered negligent if he has taken every possible measure to prevent accidents? *No*

**Court (Cardozo):** Only extraordinary situation would make wires dangerous. *Reversed*.

- \(1\) Reasonable care means you are responsible for protecting against **[foreseeable]{.underline}** accidents.

- \(2\) If there are **[reasonable precautions]{.underline}**, take them. But some precautions are too expensive and not worth taking. ("Untaken precautions")

**Notes**

1)  Grady

    a)  Plaintiff defines the analysis the court will use

    b)  What untaken precautions could have avoided the injury?

2)  *California Jury Instructions*: How is the concept of "ordinary caution" or "reasonable care" referred to in *Adams* and the notecases conveyed to the jury?

    a)  "Negligence is the doing of something which a reasonably prudent person would not do, or the failure to do something which a reasonably prudent person would do, under circumstances similar to those shown by the evidence\...It is the failure to use ordinary or reasonable care\..."

**Handout - Illinois Jury Instructions (§10.01)**

- Negligence defined as "failure to do something which a reasonably careful person would do, or the doing of something which a reasonably careful person would not, under circumstances similar to those shown by the evidence\..."

- Ordinary Care:

- *Adult* -- defined as "care a reasonably careful person would use under circumstances similar to those shown by the evidence."

- *Minor* -- defined as "Degree of care which a reasonably careful person/minor/child of the age, mental capacity and experience of the plaintiff/decedent/defendant would use under the circumstances similar to those shown by the evidence. The law does not say how such a person/minor/child would act under those circumstances\..." (Not used when minor is in activity that holds adult standard of care, like driving)

- Adult is more *objective*, whereas the minor is more of a *subjective* standard

- Duty to use ordinary care: "It was the duty of the defendant, before and at the time of the occurrence, to use ordinary care for the safety of the plaintiff and the plaintiff's property. That means it was the duty of the defendant to be free form negligence."

![](media/image22.png){width="7.527777777777778in" height="3.0722222222222224in"}

Must consider the circumstances of both the plaintiff and the defendant.

- The internal characteristics of the defendant may be relevant to the external circumstances of the plaintiff and vice versa.

- Who gets to decide? Judge or jury?

- If we want to admit sex as a factor in the reasonable person standard, we only need to persuade jury to fit gender into '**circumstances'** 🡪 question of facts

- If we want to include sex as a factor in the jury instruction, we need to convince judge to issue **special instruction** to include it in the standard. 🡪 Question of law.

#### [Daniels v. Clegg]{.underline} (MI 1873): Horse-crash; 'Reasonable Woman Standard' appropriate for contributory negligence

**Facts:** Woman (Clegg, 20 Y/O, P) drives a horse buggy down a hill. Male defendant (Daniels, D) did not turn out of her way but drove on normally. The girl could not turn to avoid crash and was injured.

- Jury instruction: consider **age of girl** and the fact that she was a **woman**.

**Issue:** Was she contributorily negligent?

**Court:** No contributory negligence because defendant should not have expected girl to be as capable of driving as a competent man in like circumstances.

- Ridiculous: "Incompetency must be taken into account; and no higher degree of diligence must be required of such persons than we have a right to respect\..."

Note: can flip argument -- 20-year-old female should not have been driving

#### [Little Rock v. Tankersley]{.underline} (AR 1890): Old lady exiting train; 'Reasonable Woman Standard'; she shouldn't have tried

**Facts:** An old lady was getting off a train, but it did not stop long enough for her to get off safely. While getting off, the train started with a jerk and threw her onto the platform, injuring her. TC for plaintiff (Tankersley)

**Issue:** Woman's contributory negligence. Was it reasonable to attempt to get off the train given the circumstances?

**Rule:** Circumstances should include **age, sex, and physical conditions**.

**Court:** It was not prudent for old lady to attempt getting off, even though a young man might do so. *Reversed*.

Note: can flip argument -- train was not designed safely for any individual wearing a dress and high heels

+===================================+========================================================+

**Notes following *Bethel***

1)  Gray

    a)  What ought to be done not necessarily what is ordinarily done, although these are often the same thing.

2)  Objective v. Subjective standard

    a)  Reasonable care inquiry raises two threshold questions:

        i)  First, whether the salient measuring-stick of due care is the conduct or the state of mind of the defendant.

        ii) Second, if defendant's conduct is the determining factor, then should it be measured against the defendant's own capacity or against an external standard?

            (1) Reasonable person test suggests external 'objective' norms rather than 'subjective' ability.

3)  Holmes - In favor of objective/external standard

    a)  Impossible to measure man's powers and limitations

    b)  In society, a certain average of conduct is necessary to the general welfare.

    c)  Limits to rule:

        i)  If someone has distinct and recognizable defect, he will not be liable (e.g. blind man not required to see)

        ii) Infants incapable of taking precautions.

        iii) Insanity more difficult than infancy (must be clear and manifest)

#### [Goss v. Allen]{.underline} (NJ 1975): Ski crash; Semi-objective standard for 17 Y/O

**Facts:** 17-year-old skier crashed into plaintiff at resort. Applied semi-objective reasonable care standard for a person of similar age and experience. **TC:** care of reasonably prudent person of same age. Plaintiff only appealed that jury verdict was against the burden of evidence. However, **Appellate Division held:** standard of care was of adult under similar circumstances because skiing was primarily an adult activity.

**NJ SC:** Reversed and held that semi-objective 17-year-old standard was right, because skiing is activity for people of all ages. TC judgment is reinstated.

#### [Vaughan v. Menlove]{.underline} (1837): Hay piled to fire hazard; mental capacity -- still follow objective standard

**Facts:** Defendant piled hay in manner that created a fire hazard, and plaintiff won case. Defendant's attorney sought new trial on ground that instead of standard of ordinary prudence, to the best of his judgment.

**Court** turned down this standard (difficult to measure/subjective as their explanation).

**Secondary point:** holds those responsible for care of sub-normal intelligent person accountable.

#### [Roberts v. Ramsbottom]{.underline} (1980): Stroke driver, physical disability; Still liable because not completely unconscious

**Facts:** 73-year-old driver suffered stroke before driving. His consciousness was impaired but had some awareness of surroundings and could make some deliberate movements to manipulate the car. He was never aware that he was unfit to drive (no moral blame).

**Court:** Still liable. Can only escape liability if completely unconscious. Measured to reasonable person standard for person of his age.

**Reasoning:** He should have recognized his inability to drive from previous misadventures on road that same day. Liable for not recognizing significance of prior mishaps.

#### [Bashi v. Wodarz]{.underline} (CA 1996): Temporary mental disability; held accountable for car crash despite being "Wigged out"

**Gist:** Court declines to extend standard for sudden and unanticipated physical illness to mental illness as well; **Facts:** Defendant rear-ended car, left scene without stopping, and shortly thereafter collided with plaintiffs. Plaintiff claimed she "wigged out" and had no recall of events leading to crash.

**Court:** refused to rule for defendant and establish similar rule for several reasons, including (a) difficulty of drawing a satisfactory line between disability and variations of temperament/intellect; (b) difficulty of identifying mental illness; (c) desirability of holding mental defectives accountable for damage they cause; and (d) fact that liability would prompt those who keep track of them to keep better track of them.

**Children cases:**

- [Mastland v. Evans Furniture, Inc.]{.underline} (IA 1993) -- child can only be found negligent if actions fell short of those of child of similar capacity

- [Dellwo v. Pearson]{.underline} (MN 1961) -- when children engage in adult activities, they are held to adult standard; here, child held to same standard of care while operating a boat, mostly for fairness reasons; unfair to public to hold child to a lower standard of care

**New York Times story about 4-Year-Old on a Bike**

She is held accountable for her activity\...

- Generally, children over the age of 4 can be sued, and those under are exempt; recall the case of the 4 year old running over the old lady on the Upper East Side; court ruled kid was old enough to understand not to hit old ladies with bikes

- Can they be 'negligent' at all?

- Can they be expected to exercise care?

## 2.7 Standards of Care (Ordinary, Extraordinary, Emergency)

**Main point:** Tailoring standard has many components (aims of tort law, external fact patterns)

Joint point of **standards** **and rules convergence** (from [Schauer]{.underline} article)\...and under the circumstances is flexible (as judge says in [Bethel]{.underline}) as overlying themes.

**Utmost Care**

#### [Andrews v. United Airlines]{.underline} (9c 1984): Falling luggage; 'Utmost Care' for common carrier; +safety feature q for jury

**Facts:** Andrews (P) was injured from a falling suitcase after opening an overhead bin on an airplane. United Airlines included a warning that items may have shifted during the flight. Andrews argued that it was foreseeable that luggage would fall. They did not include net like other airlines. **DC** dismissed in SJ

**Rule:** (1) If there is a possibility that common carrier did not take every reasonable safety precaution, then the case goes to jury. (2) They also have a higher standard of care than negligence -- utmost care -- because they carry people.

**Court:** Whether or not providing an extra safety feature on the plane to prevent the falling of luggage was a question for the jury.

**Judges decide standard of care; Juries decide whether standard was met.**

**Extraordinary Care**

#### [Wood v. Groh]{.underline} (KS 2000): Gun taken from cabinet by son of owner; needed 'extraordinary care' and didn't meet it

**Facts:** The defendant's son (15-years-old) accidentally shot the plaintiff with a gun that he had taken out of the locked case with a screwdriver and ammunition was kept in same cabinet.

**Appellate Court:** Defendant is liable because he had taken ordinary care, but he should have taken "the highest degree of care in safekeeping the handgun."

**Reasoning:** Gun is an object of *dangerous instrumentality*, so it requires more than reasonable care.

- Ordinary care is not enough to deter bad behavior; trail court found that dad had been reasonable. This sends a message to other gun owners to be extra careful. And the court did not want to incentivize gun ownership and cost of more precautions that are not prohibitive.

**Ordinary Care**

#### [Bethel v. NYC Transit]{.underline} (1998): Wheelchair seat collapses; changes standard (utmost care to RPS)

**Facts:** Wheelchair seat collapses in bus. Plaintiff sues transit authority for negligence in keeping chair in repair because they are held to standard of utmost extraordinary care as a 'common carrier.' Defendant asks for standard to change back to ordinary care

**Court:** Permits change from extraordinary care back to ordinary care for common carriers.

**Reasoning:** **No tailoring of standard is necessary -- ordinary care is flexible because of 'under the cirumstances'**

- Single ordinary care standard is flexible enough for juries to take into account the ultra hazardous nature of tortfeasor's activity.

- **Con**: Jury is variable. People might not think bus/common carrier should be expected to take more care. We would not have as high a level as safety as we previously did.

- Times have changed; other regulatory standards exist; we do not need torts to make buses safe.

- We want to incentivize bus companies to keep running -- they are a social good.

- On the other hand, less people may ride buses with lower care because they fear for their own safety.

**Kansas gun seller liability**

- Seller knew that man was unable to purchase and was just using his grandmother.

- Court held seller accountable -- have to use "highest standard of reasonable care" to keep weapons away from felons.

**Emergency Doctrine**

In the law, when in an emergency, not of your own making, you only need to show **honest exercise of judgment** (aka you tried your best in an emergency). Lesser standard of care.

- Jury should imagine what a reasonable person would do only with the given amount of time to prepare (we should not imagine what a reasonable person would do in similar circumstance had they foreseen the circumstance and had adequate preparation time).

Questions to consider:

- Why carve out emergency doctrine at all? Isn't an emergency part of the circumstances?

- What constitutes an emergency? There is little uniformity in the law.

- Who is incentivized by this lower standard of care? There is no reason for incentives because emergencies are by definition unpredictable.

<!-- -->

- **MI Sudden Emergency Doctrine --** "If a driver acts according to his or her best judgment, or who, because of lack of time in which to form a judgment omits to act in the most judicious manner is not chargeable with negligence if the emergency was not brought about by the party's own negligence."

- Sudden emergency must have been unusual or totally unexpected in order for a jury to receive the Sudden Emergency Instruction.

## 

- **Alaska** -- Tailoring is unnecessary because we use the term 'under the circumstances'

## 2.8 Rules v. Standards & Judge v. Jury

**[JUDGE & JURY]{.underline}**

**Juries:** Issues are submitted to the jury if a reasonable person [could]{.underline} disagree about the resolution of the case.

**Court:** Issues decided by court as a matter of law if reasonable person [could not]{.underline} disagree

- Duty and no-duty questions are usually handled by the court as *a matter of law*

- Pure questions of fact and mixed questions of fact and law (whether a party was negligent) are for jury

- E.g. care on airplane ([Andrews v. United Airlines]{.underline})

**Problem:** Can lead to inconstancies at trial based on jury ([Holmes]{.underline} hated this)

#### [Baltimore & Ohio RR v. Goodman]{.underline} (1927): Holmes-RULE; less deference to jury; contributory negligence; DV

**Facts:** Goodman (P) was killed. The truck he was driving was struck by the railroad's (D) train at a grade crossing. He slowed down while approaching and crossing and listened for the train, but his view was blocked and he could not stop once he saw the train.

**Railroad's defense**: Goodman was negligent as a matte of law; [contributory negligence]{.underline} meant not for jury.

**DC:** Denied railroad's motion for a directed verdict and submitted it to the jury, which found for Goodman.

**Court (Holmes):** Declares that there is a clear standard of conduct (leave car and look for train)

- "Nothing is suggested by the evidence to relieve Goodman of responsibility for his won death." (I.e. directed verdict should have been granted because plaintiff was also negligent as a matter of law)

**Reasoning**:

(1) Led to less suits during this time of diversity jurisdiction pre-[Erie]{.underline};

(2) Holmes hated the potential for inconsistent jury results for the same facts;

(3) \*Judges develop expertise from similar cases over time, and should be able to create and apply a standard, uniform, rule. Otherwise, juries oscillate and are unpredictable, where like cases are not decided similarly.

#### [Pokora v. Wabash Railway]{.underline} (1934): Cardozo-STANDARD; Changes from [Goodman]{.underline}; defer to jury; no DV

**Facts:** Man was injured when train struck his truck while crossing; this plaintiff had even less time and space to see.

**DC**: directed verdict for defendant on authority of [Goodman]{.underline} (contributory negligence)

**Court (Cardozo):** Here, the defendant may have not been contributorily negligent -- need to look at individual facts of the case. Overturns the 'rule' created in [Goodman]{.underline} that plaintiff must exit car.

- A jury should determine negligence under the circumstances.

**[Schlag, Rules and Standards]{.underline}**

1)  Holmes v. Cardozo

    a)  Holmes -- bright line rule

    b)  Cardozo -- standard

2)  Defining rules and standards

    a)  Trigger -- empirical or evaluative

    b)  Response -- determined or guided

        i)  Rule -- hard empirical trigger and a hard determinate response

        ii) Standard -- soft empirical trigger and a soft modulated response.

3)  Rules v. Standards dialectic

    a)  Deterrence -- deter selected activities or conduct (can argue either way)

        i)  Rules:

            (1) Pros: sharp line between forbidden and permissible, so people can adjust.

                (a) Sharp lines assure no desirable or permissible conduct will be chilled.

            (2) Cons: Permit and encourage activity up to boundary of permissible conduct.

                (a) Application fails to distinguish between flagrant and technical violations (*does it though?)*

                (b) Allow Holmes' 'bad man' to treat deterrent as fixed cost of doing business

        ii) Standards:

            (1) Pros: allow addressees to make individualized judgments about how offensive conduct was

                (a) Deterrence from engaging in borderline conduct and to substitute less offensive activity.

            (2) Con: Risk-averse people will be chilled from conduct that is desirable or permissible.

                (a) Risk-preferring people will be encouraged to try antisocial conduct

                (b) Boundary is not preset, so there may be erratic results.

    b)  Delegation -- agencies, administrators\...

        i)  Rules

            (1) Pros: give subordinate complete authority and responsibility for factually defined tasks.

                (a) Need for tests of authority are minimized, and time is saved.

                (b) Neat division of labor (fewer disputes/friction)

            (2) Cons: Allow avoidance of responsibility or exercise of authority contrary to objectives

                (a) May shirk responsibility and waste time?

        ii) Standards

            (1) Pros: specify degree of authority\...

    c)  Communication / formalities / notice\...

**[Schauer Article (I-III)]{.underline}**

1)  Rules, Standards, and Regulation -- the Conventional Wisdom

    a)  Conventional wisdom -- rule-markers can actually make the choice between rules and standards

2)  Challenging the conventional wisdom -- the convergence hypothesis

    a)  Convergence hypothesis - function of the adaptive behavior of those who are "given" rules or standards

        i)  When authorized to act in accordance with rules, rule-subjects tend to convert rules to standards by employing a battery of rule-avoiding devices softening the hard edges of the rules.

        ii) When authorized to act in accordance with standards, standard-subjects make their own rules (when given few) and apply them to their own allegedly discretionary behavior, limiting significantly the case-sensitive discretion that it was the intention of the rule-maker to grant.

        iii) Result of this phenomenon is "convergence"

    b)  The avoidance of rules

        i)  Rule examples - changing rule to standard

            (1) Find exception to the rule.

            (2) Implicit "reasonableness" qualification.

            (3) Override rule with considerations external to the rule.

            (4) Depart from specificity to rely on less specific purpose.

        ii) Standard examples -- changing standard to a rule

            (1) Create specific guidelines or 'rules of thumb'

            (2) Develop 'per se rules' to provide guidance and limit discretion

3)  Potential for convergence

![](media/image27.png){width="7.028472222222222in" height="1.7472222222222222in"}

**Pros of "Negligence Calculus"**

- Equality: everyone is treated equally

- Reasonably intuitive weighting: good for society and good proxy of reasonable person standard

**[Cons of "Negligence Calculus"]{.underline}**

1)  **Measurement / Info costs**

    a)  How do you measure P & L

2)  **Incommensurability**: cannot compare the variables.

    a)  We are asking defendant to make a difficult calculation. And how to measure variables of safety, convenience, and value of jobs? **Value of LIFE?**

3)  **Jury** does not need to use this formulation; they are not given in jury instructions

    a)  Must place dollar value on human safety -- juries hate doing this.

4)  Also:

    a)  Not useful for careless negligence: people don't consider costs of paying more attention

    b)  Doesn't take into account 'good faith' of defendant and whether action was a mistake

**Restatement Third:** A person acts negligently if the person does not exercise reasonable care under all the circumstances. Primary factors to consider in ascertaining whether the person's conduct lacks reasonable care are the foreseeable likelihood that the person's conduct will result in harm, the foreseeable severity of any harm that may ensue, and the burden of precautions to eliminate or reduce the risk of harm.

##### GM Malpractice Article:

1)  GM avoided analyzing the risks and benefits of faulty ignition switches so trial lawyers wouldn't get access

    a)  GM was hit 3 times with juries enraged by risk-benefit analyses weighing cost of safety improvements against value of lives lost.

    b)  This obviously caused problems when a lot more people got hurt\...

2)  Alternative option: use the "value of a statistical life" (VSL) benchmark-currently around \$9.1M

#### [US v. Carroll Towing]{.underline} (2C 1947): Unattended barge breaks; Hand: B\<P\*L: so there is negligence

**Longer facts**: deckhand on Carroll (D) messed up lines on Anna C, which rammed into another tanker, sank, and lost its cargo. Owners of Anna C (Connors) sue Carrol (D), while Carroll seeks to reduce damages because no one was aboard Anna C, and it could have prevented losing all the cargo. \[Gov also assuming Anna C for lost flower\]

**TC:** No contributory negligence for Connors (P). Viewed precedent essentially as rule.

**Rule:** There is a duty of care to protect others from harm when the burden of taking adequate precautions is less than the product of the probability of the resulting harm and the magnitude of the harm.

**Court (Hand):** Burden of preventing injury is lower than product of the probability of its occurring and the amount of harm it will cause, so there is a breach of the duty of care and liability for negligence.

- There was an **untaken precaution** that would have little burden to the company.

- Bargee was not there during working hours

- Rule would have been absence 🡪 negligence or no negligence

- This creates a simpler standard

**Notes:**

1)  Posner: it is an economic, not just a moral, theory.

2)  Posner & Hand decisions:

    a)  [McCarty v. Pheasant Run]{.underline} (7C 1987): Plaintiff guest was assaulted in her room at defendant's resort by intruder who entered through sliding door, which was not locked, but security chain had been fastened.

        i)  Judge Posner: If jury's judgment is rational and reasonable, there is no reason to have directed verdict.

            (1) There are alternative ways to do it that are less analytical, using intuition.

    b)  [Moisan v. Loftus]{.underline} (2C 1949): Car runs off road.

        i)  Judge Hand: care is the only ever susceptible to a quantitative measurement, and often that is not.

3)  **Restatement (Third) of Torts**

    a)  "Primary factors to consider in ascertaining whether the person's conduct lacks reasonable care are the **[foreseeable]{.underline}** likelihood that the person's conduct will result in harm, the **[foreseeable]{.underline}** severity of any harm that may ensue, and the burden of precautions to eliminate or reduce the risk of harm."

##### Gilles, [Article on Carroll Towing]{.underline}

**Gist:** Learned Hand's formula doesn't take into account all of the hidden information costs of getting the data

- Counter: the way to get around this is by making estimates and only focusing on optimal behavior.

1)  Problems of information and error costs

    a)  High information costs inflate administrative costs of negligence system -- lead to many errors

    b)  Courts use variety of techniques to reduce information costs -- look at untaken precautions and offer proof that safety benefits outweigh their costs using this formula

2)  Problem of Incommensurability

    a)  E.g. difficult to measure finger against blade guard

    b)  Posner's argument: solve problem by estimating what people would be willing to pay to avoid risks of personal injury. Injuries are simple to calculate, and probability is never estimated + varies with the injury.

[Eckert v. Long Island RR]{.underline} (1871): Rescuer who dies saving life justified because L so high (B\<P\*L)

**Facts:** Plaintiff's decedent had saved a small child from near-certain death by sweeping the child off the tracks of a negligently operated train. In the course of rescue, the rescuer was killed.

**TC:** rejected contention that there was "contributory negligence," by deferring to value of human life. That is, L was so high that it was justified.

### 2.10.i Statutes

![](media/image26.png){width="7.527777777777778in" height="2.4055555555555554in"}

#### 

**CPLR 4504(d)** 🡪 In any action for personal injuries against a person not authorized to practice medicine, the fact that such person practiced medicine without being so authorized shall be deemed prima facie evidence of negligence

#### 

#### [Martin v. Herzog]{.underline} (NY 1920): Per se statute; car lights were off, so there is contributory negligence

**Facts:** Mrs. Martin's (P) husband was killed when the buggy he was driving at night without lights, in violation of a statute requiring them, collided with the car Herzog (D) was driving somewhat over the center line.

**Rule:** Failure to perform a statutory duty constitutes negligence per se, which can be prima facie evidence of contributory negligence (which must be overcome by proof in the opposite direction).

**Court (Cardozo):** Plaintiff is *contributorily negligent* because they violated statute by not having their lights on, so they were negligent per se.

**Alternative: (minority rule?)** Could have remanded for jury question deciding whether the statutory violations contributed to the accident.

- Cardozo follows rule/statute/precondition and does not submit issues to the jury; bends statutes to fit the facts of the case.

- [Alternative Argument:]{.underline} Violation of a statute proves negligence because a reasonable person would not violate a statute; BUT because statutory violations require civil penalties, this form of argument would make the defendant susceptible to double damages

- [Compliance]{.underline}*:* Compliance with a statue does not vindicate the violator; statutes set a *minimum standard of care,* and court may find that reasonable care exists above this minimum standard (see **Edwards**, **Hubbard-Hall,** and **Alvarado** on pg. 85)

#### [Tedla v. Ellman]{.underline} (NY 1939): No contrib. negligence per se following statute (walking next to road) because less safe

**Facts:** Ellman (D), the driver of a car which injured Tedla (P), and killed Bachek, defended a suit against himself by asserting the fact that the victims were struck while walking on the right side of the roadway was a violation of a statute. (Plaintiff was struck from behind by traffic while walking with back to traffic, even though statute said you have to walk facing traffic)

**Plaintiff** **contended:** due to heavy traffic on opposite side, it would have been more dangerous and risky to walk facing traffic.

**Defendant argued:** they were contributorily negligent per se because of the statute violation

**Rule:** Where a statutory general rule of conduct fixes no definite standard of care, but merely codifies or supplements a common law rule, which has been subject to exceptions; or where the statute is intended to promote public convenience or safety, then in the absence of clear language to the contrary, it is not negligence as a matter of law for one to violate the statute, if by so doing he is likely to prevent---rather than cause---the accident which it is the purpose of the statute to avoid.

**Court:** No negligence per se because following statutes would have been more dangerous.

- "We cannot assume reasonably that the legislature intended that a statute enacted for the preservation of the life and limb of pedestrians must be observed when observance would subject them to more imminent danger"

##### [DiCaprio v. New York Central RR]{.underline} (NY 1921): Son not target of statute requiring fence to keep livestock off tracks

**Facts:** defendant violated a statute requiring fences be erected to keep livestock off tracks.

**TC:** No recovery when plaintiff's young son was killed after wandering onto the tracks, because protection against this risk was not the object of the statute.

**Who should determine breach of duty and make rules? Legislature or court?**

- Negligence per se (statutory negligence) is legislatures' deciding law and breach of duty.

+================================================================================================+=====================================================================================+

**Notes:**

1)  **Restatement of Torts § 15**

    a)  An actor's violation of a statute is excused and not negligent if: (a) childhood, physical disability, physical incapacitation; (b) actor exercises reasonable care in attempting to comply with statute; (c) neither knows nor should know of circumstances making statute applicable; (d) violation is due to confusing way in which requirements are presented to public; (e) compliance would involve greater risk than noncompliance.

2)  Statutory purpose: Courts long unwilling to use statutory violations in cases in which the harm that occurred was different from the harm that the legislature apparently was seeking to prevent.

    a)  [De Haen v. Rockwood Sprinkler Co]{.underline} (Cardozo 1932)---the statute wasn't to protect radiators from calling off ledges and killing people (not the thought or purpose of the legislature)

    b)  [Di Ponzio v. Riordan]{.underline} (NY 1997): the ordinance violation, which was in the city's fire prevention code, was irrelevant because its apparent purpose was to prevent fires and not to avoid injuries from moving vehicles.

        i)  Example given from restatement: giving gun to child, who then drops it on his friends foot, but no shot goes off\...not purpose of statute

    c)  [Brown v. Shyne]{.underline} (1926)---the jury shouldn't be told about the defendant's violation of the licensing statute

        i)  (No drivers license cases should not be decided strictly on this basis)

3)  Compliance with regulations

    a)  Could they have been negligent if they were complying with the statute in [Tedla]{.underline}?

        i)  Compliance is not necessarily enough (FDA example)

### 2.10.ii Custom

![](media/image29.png){width="6.510416666666667in" height="1.5361111111111112in"}

Benefits of current custom rule:

- Custom often **correlates** to what ought to be done

- If factor is compliant with custom, **cautions the jury** that finding actor negligent implies that the entire industry or grouping of peoples is also behaving unreasonably.

- If actor is non-compliant to a custom, **makes jury feel better** about finding them negligent.

- Coordinating function -- potential victims can take **self-protective care** based on custom

- Some departures of custom may be **equally safe or more safe** that custom dictates

- Promotes reliable and accurate decisions -- custom is an important way to **inform juries** on how reasonable actors should act, especially if jury is unfamiliar with the circumstances.

#### [T.J. Hooper]{.underline} (1932): Tugboat did not have radio receiver; Hand: custom not excuse when cheap and important

**Facts:** Tug towed three barges, but they sank in a storm. Tugboats did not have receiving sets to get weather reports; otherwise they could have avoided the storm. Not customary for industry to provide them.

- No statute; Custom to have radio (90% of boats have them), but NOT custom for company to provide radios 🡪 **No custom to have radios**, because liability of owner

**Court:** Tug owners are still negligent because compliance to custom is not reasonable care.

- Custom, in this case, is lagging behind ordinary care for safety.

- Courts must push safety customs for industry because industry has incentive to keep costs down and to choose not to implement more safety standards.

**Quote:** Customs "never may set its own tests, however persuasive be its usages. Courts must in the end say what is required" but in most cases whether a whole calling is negligent would be a jury question.

### 2.10.iii Medical Malpratice (Mandatory)

![](media/image28.png){width="7.527777777777778in" height="4.3284722222222225in"}

**[(Rejected) Strict Locality Rule:]{.underline}** Old requirement that expert witnesses, usually for plaintiff, had to come from the defendant\'s own community and have same/similar practice or qualifications.

- Standard after this period was "[Same or Similar locality"]{.underline} rule\...which was still too strict

- Needed because community medical standards varied widely.

- But "conspiracy of silence" professionals would not testify against each other

With the increased standardization of medicine, many courts have [**rejected strict locality rule**.]{.underline}

- National standards now govern and any expert familiar with standards can testify.

- Caused explosion of medical malpractice suits; some doctors only work as expert witnesses.

- In response, some courts only allow practicing doctors to testify, or require higher qualifications.

#### [Sheeley v. Memorial Hospital]{.underline} (RI 1998): Rejects locality rule for expert witness Ob/Gyn

**Facts:** Sheeley (P) alleged that Memorial Hospital (D) and the second-year family practice resident (D) who performed an episiotomy on her were negligent, but her expert witness was not allowed to testify.

**TC:** expert witness not in family practice (board-certified Ob/Gyn; D motion for directed verdict was granted.

**Rule:** A physician is under a duty to use the degree of caution and skill that is expected of a reasonably competent practitioner in the same class, acting in the same or similar circumstances.

**Court:** Rejects the locality rule.

- Doesn't matter if expert is more qualified than defendant physician or had not practiced in years.

- Issue is a medical procedure that had not changed in 30 years.

- Jury gets to decide what national standard is and which expert to believe now.

**Notes:**

##### [Gala v. Hamilton]{.underline} (PA 1998): Example of 'Secondary School of Thought' for medical practice

**Facts:** D used local anesthetic while working on plaintiff's neck tumor. P alleged that general anesthetic should have been used.

**Court:** Followed a standard that a consider number of medical experts use\....secondary school of thought.

1)  Conspiracy of silence problem for "Strict Locality Rule"

2)  One exception was for "common knowledge" (e.g. operated on wrong hand\...)

3)  Doctor confession stories: lied to protect colleague

## 2.11 Gross Negligence, Recklessness, Willful Misconduct

![](media/image60.png){width="7.527777777777778in" height="5.752777777777778in"}

# 

#### [BP Oil Spill Case]{.underline} (2014): Gross negligence: subjective or objective? Court: subjective but lose either way

**Facts:** BP Conducted a negative pressure test and declared it a success because no fluid was observed flowing from the kill line for thirty minutes, and there was no pressure on the kill line. However, 1400psi pressure remained on the drill pipe at the time ad the negative test should have been declared a failure because something had blocked the line. BP well Site Leader Done Vidrine told the Transocean drill crew to proceed with displacing the remaining mud in the riser above the BOP with seawater and later there was a blowout.

**Rule (Clean Water Act):** If gross negligence or willful negligence, 4X penalty, but not defined by statute.

**Holding:** "The Court finds and concludes that the discharge of oil was the result of BPXP's 'gross negligence' and 'willful misconduct' under the CWA" (114, P 478).

1)  **Arguments:**

    a)  **[US]{.underline}:** gross negligence is just like ordinary negligence, except it is worse ([definition 1]{.underline})

    b)  **[BP]{.underline}:** gross negligence is different, so you need to prove a "culpable mental state" (subjective element as an extra thing); ([definition 2]{.underline})

    c)  At issue, because they will pay \$1,100 per barrel for negligence, versus four times that amount for gross negligence.

2)  Court agrees with US, but says BP would lose under either definition.

    a)  BP knows it was dangerous activity, and area drilling was difficult and hellish

    b)  Guy in Houston told rig that something was wrong w/ pressure test.

    c)  Bladder effect excuse: (1) could go to mental state because it's a BS excuse (2) could be objective b/c no one would've misread test results due to this.

    d)  Untaken precautions/BPL analysis: Burden was so low for untaken precautions

    e)  Motivated by money!!

3)  Other arguments:

    a)  Rig's crew misinterpreted results of the negative pressure tests done the day of the explosion. Botched test led to the blast.

        i)  "Was a gross and extreme departure" from accepted standards in the oil industry

        ii) "Bladder effect" excuse: condition occurs when pressure on valves may produce false readings (BP & Transocean defense). Experts agree this is stupid excuse.

    b)  BP was over budget and behind schedule, prompting the company to cut corners in safety

    c)  BP sued contractors (e.g. Transocean employees -- disabled safety system, failed to maintain the installation properly, Halliburton -- provided shoddy cement materials)

## 2.12 Contributory & Comparative Negligence

**Idea:** Liability is apportioned pursuant to comparative fault, and is based on the number and the *quality* of faults by each party, and the role each fault had in causing the casualty.

![](media/image58.png){width="7.527777777777778in" height="2.3767169728783903in"}

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Pure Comparative**                                                                               | **Partial (Modified Comparative)**                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Pure comparative:** Percent of fault directly corresponds to amount the plaintiff is liable.     | **Modified comparative:** Percent at fault directly corresponds to amount the plaintiff is liable, BUT if the plaintiff is more than 50% at fault, then switches to contributory negligence so they are not liable for the defendant. |
|                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

##### [BP Oil Spill Case]{.underline} (2014): BP admits negligence for settlement; Barbier assigns blame (BP, Trnasocean, Haliburton)

**Gist:** BP already admitted negligence for settlement. Judge Barbier assigns blame among three parties: BP (67%); Transocean (30%), and Haliburton (3%).

**Court**: BP was grossly negligent (reckless), others were only negligent

**Reasoning:** BP was in charge of everything and were more responsible for creating the disaster, had more time to make the final decisions

- Transocean had less time and less information. They also did the right thing once the disaster began -- main failure was its inability to stop the BP caused disaster

**Halliburton\'s failures**: unstable foamed cement and failure in well-monitoring

- Cement conduct was egregious, but not a cause of the blowout, so not legal fault

- Failure in well monitoring was relatively small and shared by Transocean

**Numbers?** Just making up - 2/3 blame to BP, 1/3 for Transocean, and nominal for HB

- Example of how arbitrary this can seem, when numbers are so rough over a case with billions of \$\$ in it.

#### [Li v. Yellow Cab Co.]{.underline} (CA 1975): Switch to pure comparative negligence standard

**Facts:** Plaintiff was driving northbound and making a left when the defendant was driving southbound in an unsafe manner at 30mph on a yellow light. The jury determined that P was contributory negligent and barred recovery.

**Court:** Switches to 'pure' comparative negligence.

**Holding**: "Pure" form of comparative negligence should be applied in the case.

- "50%" rule shifts lottery aspect of the contributory negligence to a different ground (51 v. 49 -- windfall)

- Partial rule distorts principle it recognizes that people are responsible for their acts to the extent their faults contribute to an injurious result.

- Partial rule comes with administrative costs; leads to numerous appeals on the narrow but crucial question of whether the plaintiff's negligence was equal to the defendant's

**Notes:**

- It was harder to switch standard in CA, because Cal. Civ. Code §1714 codified common law when there was contributory negligence, but courts interpret code to defer to courts on determining common law. Purpose of code was clarity, not stopping evolution of law.

- Gives broad discretion to trial judges to apportion fault

- Does not decide how to deal with multiple parties, or if it conflicts with willful misconduct.

- WI has modified comparative, and it has created a lot of problems for the courts.

##### Comparative Negligence in NY -- Pure Comparative + Burden operators

- NY CPLR § 1411: damages recoverable when contributory negligence or assumption of risk is established

- Pure comparative sounding rule.

- NY CPLR § 1412: burden of pleading; burden of proof

- Culpable conduct should be claimed in diminution of damages, shall be an affirmative defense to be pleaded and proved by the party asserting the defense. ([Burden on defense]{.underline})

##### Maryland declines to do away with Contributory Negligence (along with AL, NC, VA, DC)

- Ways to work around it:

- Juries can declare plaintiff not negligent, then adjust damages to take into account their percentage fault

- Court can make exceptions to try and soften the contributory negligence effects

**KA Notes:**

1)  **Exceptions to contributory negligence:**

    a)  **The Safety Statute Exception** - When defendant's negligence consisted of breach of a statute designed specifically to protect a class of persons unable to protect themselves, the contributory negligence of a member of the protected class does not bar recovery. Trying to cure harshness of contributory negligence rule.

        (1) E.g. school bus driver fails to state measures required by statute, students not accountable for theirs

        <!-- -->

        i)  Logic behind rule not particularly compelling

    b)  **The Greater-Degree-of-Blame Exception** -- Not a defense to an intentional tort because defendant is much more blameworthy. Same for willful or wanton torts that are not intentional but defendant acted in a way that is blameworthy. But if the plaintiff was also willfully or wantonly negligent, this cancelled out the defendant's blameworthy behavior.

    c)  **Last clear chance**

        i)  If the negligence defendant had the last clear chance to avoid harming the plaintiff, then the plaintiff's contributory negligence was not a bar to recovery.

        ii) When the defendant had a chance that was both last and clear, it may be more blameworthy than ordinary negligence, even if plaintiff's negligence was present.

        iii) Clear chance is **open and obvious**. Last chance means at that point **plaintiff cannot remove himself** from harms way and defendant knows this OR has reason to know.

        iv) Isn't this just a comparison of fault, giving more weight to the defendant's fault if they had a last clear chance to avoid it? LCC will not survive into comparative neg. regime.

            (1) [Davies v. Mann]{.underline} (UK 1842): origin of last chance doctrine

                (a) Plaintiff was negligent in tying the forefeet of his donkey together so that it could not move, then left the scene. Defendant drove his wagon right over the donkey.

                (b) Last chance here can also be seen another version of greater-degree-of-blame exception.

    d)  **Jury Question/General Verdict Approach** -- Practice of submitting contributory negligence cases to the jury contributed to the demise of the regime. Jury applied "**under the table**" comparative negligence returning "quotient" verdicts in which they reduced plaintiff's recovery through a comparison of faults.

2)  **Comparative negligence:** All states except AL, MD, NC, VA, and DC have it in some form.

    i)  36 changed by statute, 10 by judicial decision

3)  Applications of Comparative negligence:

    a)  **Multiple Defendants** -- How to handle when plaintiff is more responsible than either defendant, but not both combined? Two ways of approaching logic:

        i)  Plaintiff should be entitled to recover something unless she is principally responsible for her own harm, so recovery should be permitted -- [favored]{.underline} by most courts

        ii) Defendant should not be held liable unless she is at least as responsible for the plaintiff's harm as the plaintiff, so NO recovery should be permitted

    b)  **Joint and Several Liability** -- under comparative negligence, what to do when there is joint liability\...pay just for your own share, or should you be jointly and severally liable for combined share of defendants in the case of insolvency?

        i)  Option 1: Hold defendants jointly and severally liable for the amount of the judgment (this has less appeal if defendants are just concurrent defendants, as opposed to joint tortfeasors)

        ii) Option 2: Hold each defendant liable for only his or her own proportional share of the reduced judgment. If one is not able to pay, the loss rests with the plaintiff.

        iii) Option 3: Plaintiff and solvent defendant are proportionally responsible for the insolvent defendant's share. (Negotiation between options 1 & 2).

4)  **Effect on Other Common Law Doctrines** -- Comparative negligence statutes and cases do not outline effect on other doctrines such as last clear chance, assumption of risk or greater-degree-of-blame exceptions to contributory negligence

    a)  **Last clear chance** -- most courts have ruled that this is no longer dispositive and these cases should follow the comparative negligence scheme. Jury can take the last clear chance into account when dividing negligence.

    b)  **Greater-degree-of-blame** -- largely unnecessary once jury is already dividing degree of negligence. But some courts have said that plaintiff's negligence is no defense to an intentional or similar tort but same-degree-of-blame can be a defense in these same torts.

    c)  **Assumption of risk** still completely bars recovery when plaintiff knowingly assumes the risk that defendant will injure. Usually this only works if plaintiff's assumption was unreasonable and therefore negligent, which the jury when dividing negligence can take into account.

5)  **Strict Liability** -- contributory negligence is only a defense against strict liability in some jurisdictions.

    a)  Easiest to apply comparative negligence whenever contributory negligence used to apply but some still bar recovery based on plaintiff negligence in strict liability cases.

    b)  Some say plaintiff's behavior is irrelevant

6)  **Setoffs** -- defendant counterclaims and both are given a judgment

    a)  Should the party owing more just pay the difference or should both parties be required to pay out the whole amount? Seems to be that when insurance is involved, both insurers must pay the entire amount to the opposing party.

#### [The Mock Case]{.underline} (NY 1928): Cardozo: water supply nonfeasance v. misfeasance; denied benefit, not wrong act

**Facts**: Defendant had a contract with the City to supply water for various purposes, including at fire hydrants; a fire burned down plaintiff's warehouse; plaintiff alleged that water company's failure to supply adequate water permitted the fire's spread

**Court (Cardozo):** Misfeasance v. Nonfeasance; Defendant's conduct amounted to a mere negligent omission, unaccompanied by malice or other aggravating elements; the failure to furnish a supply of water is at most a denial of a benefit, not a commission of a wrong.

- No duty / No liability. Distinguishes misfeasance and nonfeasance.

**Analysis, contrast:** If conduct has gone forward to such a stage that inaction would commonly result, positively or actively in working an injury, there is a duty to act

- E.g. surgeon who operated w/out pay is liable of negligence in omitting to sterilize his tools or car maker failed to inspect properly before selling cars

- Distinguish "launched the force of harm" v. "refused to become an instrument of good"

- In this case, water company denied a benefit, not a commission of a wrong

- \*\*In reality, should have recognized distinction between installing and maintaining system -- they were relied upon to provide water and maintain it\....

**Facts:** Utility was contracted to maintain city streetlights. Plaintiff was run down in area darkened due to utility's negligence in maintaining lights, because utility had a duty.

**Rule:** [undertaking doctrine]{.underline} imposes a duty on utility that contracted to maintain lights.

- **Undertaking doctrine: Previous action created a reliance (undertaking rescue)**

- [Moch]{.underline} also failed to recognize a distinction between installing a system and maintaining it.

#### [Culyer v. US]{.underline} (7c 2004): Need Tort Law remedy in statute; reporting baby-sitter abuse 

**Facts:** Naval hospital violated reporting statute by not reporting possible child abuse by Higgs, a babysitter, to Norman, who is treated. Higgs then causes death of Cuyler's child.

**Issue 1:** Is there negligence per se in violating reporting of statute? No

- Statute didn't provide for any tort remedies and no indication that legislative purpose was to expand tort liability

**Court:** Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act provides criminal sanctions for *willful violations*, but does not impose a tort liability for *negligent violations*.

**Posner:** There must be a cause of action under torts for statute violation to count as negligence. There is no tort of failure to warn AND there is no special relationship

- Statutes only define duties that already exist in the common law, they do not create duties

- So if there is no existing duty in the common law (no rescue), a statute that criminalizes inaction (reporting child abuse) does not then create a common law duty (must report child abuse to rescue future children from abuser), UNLESS it includes a tort law remedy

### 3.3.ii Duty to Warn: Special Relationships

Special relationships usually involves dependence by the plaintiff on the defendant, in which case the defendant has waived the right to mind their own business and has undertaken a duty to protect

#### [Tarasoff v. Regents of UC]{.underline} (CA 1976): Psychiatrist has duty to person threatened by patient

**Facts:** Psychiatrist had patient, Poddar, who told him that he wanted to kill Tarasoff. Doctor released patient because he appeared rational; Chief of Psychiatry did not order detainment and no one warned the deceased about the threat. Dr. Moore warned police and they detained the patient, but police then released him and Poddar went on to kill Tarasoff, about two months later.

**Court:** Therapist failed to warn potential victim 🡪 defendant therapists' special relationship to patient was extended to victim.

- Better to have over-warning than none; safety is more important than confidentiality

**Rule:** Once a therapist determines that a patient poses serious danger of violence to others, he bears a duty to exercise reasonable care to protect the foreseeable victim of that danger.

**Were police to blame?**

- Court dismissed claims against defendant police

- No special relationship between police and victim 🡪 but maybe police have special relationship with everyone, because their job is general public safety.

- Police released Poddar, so did they launch the instrument of harm?

**Cal. Civil Code 43.92 🡪** Therapists are immune from liability for failure to warn except when the patient has communicated to the psychotherapist as serious threat of physical violence against a [reasonably identifiable victim]{.underline} or victims; if there is a duty to warn, it shall be discharged by the psychotherapist making reasonable efforts to communicate the threat to the victim or victims or to a law enforcement agency

- Enacted after this case, clearly tightening the standard (makes it entirely subjective)

**Cal. Health & Safety Code 121015(c) 🡪** No physician has a duty to notify any person of the fact that a patient is reasonably believed to be infected by the probably causative agent of AIDS

#### [Hood v. Ryobi American Corp]{.underline}. (4c. 1999): Removes blade guard despite warning; label was sufficient

**Facts:** Hood (P) used a saw manufactured by the Ryobi (D). Despite warnings not to remove the blade guard, the plaintiff used the saw without this piece. Plaintiff cut off his thumb.

**Issues:** (1) inadequate warning of risks with guards not in place; (2) design of saw was defective. Court disagrees.

**Plaintiff argument:** Reasonable person expects a particular type of injury, cutting yourself on blade; they do not expect the blade to fly off the spindle.

- Notes that the burden would be low to add one more warning or replace repetitive warning

**Court (Wilkinson):** Maryland only requires that a warning be reasonable under the circumstances, and the Ryobi label was sufficient. A proliferation of label detail would threaten to undermine the warning altogether (Court effectively uses a B?P\*L test, finds label clutter may increase burden.

- Plaintiff's injuries were the result of altering the tool, and the manufacturer is not liable for intervening alternations of the product that was superseding cause of injury.

- Court weighs the cost of requiring more warning or more detailed warning.

- Cost is minimal -- price of printing fees for all products alone is large.

- Societal danger of label clutter could undermine effectiveness of warnings.

##### [Cotton v. Buckeye]{.underline} (DC 1988): Cost of adding warning is increased time/effort for user to grasp message

**Gist:** Primary cost of added warning is the increase in time and effort required for the user to grasp the message

- Inclusion of an extra term dilutes punch of every other item

**Facts:** Plaintiff hurt when propane tanks on job site exploded, and he argued that labels were inadequate.

## 4.1. Causation-in-Fact (But for)

![](media/image17.png){width="7.527777777777778in" height="5.054861111111111in"}

'But-for' cause is a **COUNTERFACTUAL** -- it requires imagination of what would have happened had defendant not been negligent

- Asks jury to make a decision about what would have happened

- Requires assumptions about the way the word typically works and would include jury biases about what is normal, including capacities of different groups of people (age, gender, etc.)

- Places a burden on the plaintiff to provide some concrete experiential basis for making a judgment on the way the world works in situations like their own, then court determines whether plaintiff has made out a prima facie case on the causation issue.

There is no rule about how much narrative detail a court will require before ruling the plaintiff's claims

If there are **[multiple necessary causes]{.underline}**, then both need to cause injury, so but-for works and is cause

If there are **[multiple sufficient causes]{.underline},** then the 'but for' test is under-inclusive, and does not work.

- E.g. 2 cars, car accident only avoided if BOTH cars have lights on 🡪 no 'but for'

- But for Car 1 lights off, car accident would still have occurred.

- But for Car 2 lights off, car accident would still have occurred.

## 

#### [Aegis Insurance v. 7 World Trade Center]{.underline} (2c 2013): construction of WTC not cause-in-fact of collapse

**Facts:** ConEd sues World Trade Center for destruction to its building, arguing that the World Trade Center fell because of negligent construction.

- There was a lot of fire/damage to building with limited water supply; firefighters decided not to risk more lives to fight fire and established a collapse zone and let it collapse---caused damage to Con Ed substation that was built under the WTC 7 building, and they sued WTC 7 for negligence.

**Holding:** Given the unprecedented nature and sheer magnitude of the events of 9/11, the alleged negligence on the part of the defendants was not the cause-in-fact of the collapse of the World Trade Center (unprecedented constellation of events, falling burning debris triggering multiple fires on multiple noncontiguous floors, mortally wounded firefighters).

**Counter:** Reasonable jury could conclude that firemen would not have abandoned building if it were properly constructed.

**Dissent:** Could have been preventable, even if event was not foreseeable.

##### [Cuyler]{.underline} reexamined (Tort was failure to report babysitter); counterfactual too speculative

- **But for** the hospital's failure to report the babysitter, the proper agency would have stopped babysitter from working, Cuylers from hiring her, and the baby would be alive

- **Difficult** to construct 'but-for' causation for nonfeasance

- This counterfactual is very speculative, so this is a good reason to not find liability

- These counterfactuals require another party's choice to be different 🡪 doctor would not implant the device, the agency would act properly, and the family wouldn't hire babysitter.

## 4.2. Multiple Sufficient Causes (MSC)

![](media/image14.png){width="7.527777777777778in" height="7.775in"}

**[Example: two fires converge to burn down a house]{.underline}**

**Case 1: Both fires are started by negligence**

- \'But-for\' test fails because the house would still have been destroyed, but courts have held that neither defendant can escape liability, both are held to have caused plaintiff\'s injury

- Two Simultaneous Causes: Both are Negligent

**Case 2: Only one of the fires is started negligently**

- \'But-for\' test fails: Should the one negligent party be held liable for the entire amount, even if damage would have occurred without their negligence?

- Imposing this liability is problematic because it will give such parties an incentive to take precautions against harms that will occasionally occur anyways because of a simultaneous non-negligent cause

- On the other hand, imposing it could still prevent negligent conduct.

- Many courts DO NOT hold the negligent defendant liable, but some courts DO.

- It is critical for courts that DO impose liability that they happen at exact same time.

**[Sequential Causes: Pre-emptive Causation]{.underline}**

One fire burns down the house, then another fire comes after. The first fire is '**pre-emptive'** cause.

- If the harms occur sequentially, then neither fire can be said to be a 'but-for' cause of the harm because the house would have still burned down.

- The first fire is not a 'but-for' cause, but caused the damage.

- **Defendant (of first fire) is liable if negligent**

- Second fire risked harm, but simply was not cause of harm.

- **Defendant (of second fire) NOT liable, even if negligent**

- This result is somewhat unfair because the later fire is just lucky and escapes liability even if he is blameworthy; but key because we only have liability for [ACTUAL HARM, not risk creation]{.underline}.

- Alternative? We could divide damages to get both fire starters, causation counterfactual could be that first fire is only responsible for the one second of house life, before 2^nd^ fire would have burnt down the house, not whole house.

\*Depends on the state for how to apportion percentages. Some states may just divide equally between all solvent defendants. Other states may divide based on the total number of defendants and then first defendant to get sued gets stuck with paying for insolvent defendants.

\*\*Generally, the plaintiff can sue just one defendant and then collect all 60% of damages (Damages minus plaintiff's percentage fault) from one defendant. Then the first defendant can collect from other defendants either divided equally OR based on comparative faults.

## 4.4. Question of Proof -- Indeterminate Cause

### 4.4.1 Alternative Liability

![](media/image12.png){width="7.527777777777778in" height="1.5180555555555555in"}

**Policy reasons:**

- Defendants are more likely to be able to figure out who did what. So impose liability and let them bring proof and sort damages out

- Plaintiff should not bear the cost of uncertainty 🡪 it is more fair and better for deterrence purposes to put costs on defendant

#### [Summers v. Trice]{.underline} (CA 1948): Two hunters shoot; man shot in eye; alternatively liable; burden shifts

**Facts:** Two hunters shoot towards the same quail; plaintiff gets shot in the eye, but they cannot figure out which hunter actually hit the plaintiff.

**Holding:** Under these circumstances, the **burden shifted** to each of the defendants to disprove that he had caused the harm; the defendants were not held to be each liable for the full amount of damages, but rather that the burden fell on them to prove that the other was at fault.

- Distinct from multiple sufficient causes because only ONE cause exists, but they cannot figure out which defendant.

- There is 50/50 chance that one defendant is guilty of injury, no preponderance.

- Not "joint" because 2 different shotguns, and they did not help each other with their shots

- Unfortunately, limited group is important, if there are more defendants, they are less likely to impose liability, even if plaintiff is even less likely to be able to prove anything.

**Hypo:** Same fact pattern as [Summers]{.underline}, but only one of the shooters was negligent, so the innocent Simonson could not be liable to the plaintiff even if his pellet had done the harm.

- [Garcia v. Joseph Vince]{.underline} (CA 1978): plaintiff fencer hurt by a defective saber. Plaintiff could not identify which of the two manufacturers was the source of the defective saber because it had been put back into a pile of sabers. His effort to invoke [Summers v. Tice]{.underline} was rejected, and the case was dismissed.

**Aims of tort law:** loss distribution

### 4.4.2 Market Share Liability

![](media/image30.png){width="7.527777777777778in" height="2.2381944444444444in"}

**Reasoning**:

- Once it is clear that defendant's product injured some plaintiffs, they shouldn't escape liability just because plaintiffs cannot show which defendants harmed which plaintiffs.

- Achieves optimal deterrence because defendant must pay for exact amount of harm caused based on market share.

**Problems/Limitation**

- Not often used because there are **few signature diseases**

- Limitations of market-share **information**🡪 hard to determine proper share at time of harm

- Same product by manufacturers may not be 100% **identical** or fungible

- **Over-imposition** of liability 🡪 some manufacturers are out of business, so others must overcompensate if using relative market share or there is under-compensation for plaintiff in imposing absolute market share.

- **[Relative-market share approach]{.underline}:** Defendants still around take share of market, overpaying

- **[Absolute-market share approach]{.underline}:** Defendants are only accountable for the share they really had

- Does not serve **corrective justice**.

##### BP case reexamined for Market Share Liability

**Apportionment:** BP-67%; Transocean-30%; Halliburton-3%.

- Causation-negligence must be "legal cause" of the damage, which is more than "but for"

- Apportioned by comparative fault.

- Transocean -- misinterpreted negative pressure test; failed to maintain the BOP;

- BP -- was ultimately responsible for misinterpretation, not just Transocean; to test kill line;

- Haliburton -- was responsible for cement and well monitoring, but was relatively small\...

- Even if they were recklessly negligent, because cement was small part of accident.

##### [Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories]{.underline} (CA 1980): Bad drug, many manufacturers; Solution: pay market share

**Facts:** Plaintiffs (women whose mothers had taken DES drug while pregnant and got a signature disease) sued DES drug manufacturers. However, no individual plaintiff could identify which manufacturer had made the DES that her mother had taken.

**Court:** Circumvented this by holding that the plaintiffs need not prove individual causation. Instead, each plaintiff recovered from each defendant a portion of her damages equal to the **defendant's share of the market** for DES.

- DES is chemically identical, so market share is an accurate surrogate for the amount of harm each defendant caused. Therefore, imposing liability in proportion to market share forces each defendant to pay compensation for amount of injury caused. Optimal deterrence is achieved.

##### [Hall v. Du Pont]{.underline} (EDNY 1972): Industry-wide liability for blasting-caps

**Gist:** 6 manufacturers of blasting caps sued by 13 children from separate incidents.

**Court**: if more likely than not that any child can prove that more likely than not a manufactures caused injury, burden shifted to defendant.

**Possible reasons:** (1) they made it intentionally difficult to know whose cap was whose; (2) the relatively small number of plaintiffs.

#### [Hymowitz v. Eli Lilly]{.underline} (NY 1989): Market share liability for DES during pregnancy

**Facts:** Plaintiffs allege that they were injured by the drug DES, which was ingested by their mothers during pregnancy; they seek relief against DES manufacturers.

**Statute of Limitations issue:** Resolved by statute that reignited 1 year SOL when latent effects are discovered.

**Court (Wachtler):** Limiting a defendant's liability to its market share will result, over the run of cases, in liability on the part of a defendant roughly equal to the injuries the defendant caused.

**Approach:** DES plaintiffs only are required to establish (all required):

(1) That the plaintiff's mother ingested DES during pregnancy

(2) That the plaintiff's injuries were caused by DES, AND

(3) The defendant or defendants produced and marketed DES for pregnancy purposes.

Subsequently, the burden of proof shifts to the defendants to exculpate themselves by establishing, **by a preponderance of evidence**, that the plaintiff's mother could not have ingested their particular pill (because the manufacturer did not market the pill for pregnancy purposes).

- Of those defendants who are unable to exculpate themselves from liability, their **respective share** of the plaintiff's damages would be measured by their **share of the national market** of DES produced and marketed for pregnancy purposes during the period in question. (Absolute-market share, and may lead to \<100%)

**Concurrence:** Want to do relative-market share, so it adds up to 100%, and want to exculpate defendants with unique pills that can prove they were not at fault.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Questions Necessary for implementing Market Share Liability**   **[Hymowitz]{.underline}**
  ----------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------
  Signature disease (DES only cause of disease)?                    Yes

  Identical product?                                                Yes

  Which market?                                                     National, using several liability.

  Can defendant exculpate himself?                                  No (except if manufacturer didn\'t market the pill for pregnancy)

  Missing Defendants?                                               Plaintiff bears the loss (absolute)

  Can plaintiff prove a specific defendant?                         Yes
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4.5. Loss of Chance

![](media/image31.png){width="7.527777777777778in" height="1.2763888888888888in"}

**[Example]{.underline}:** Patient diagnosed late and had only 25% survival rate, but had he been diagnosed correctly, he would have had a 39% survival rate 🡪 Physician is liable for the 14% reduction in the survival rate.

- Note, they are 100% responsible for a decrease in survival rate of 14%.

#### [Matsuyama v. Birnbaum]{.underline} (MA 2008): Doctor misdiagnosis step-cancer; court recognizes Lost Chance theory

**Facts:** Doctor diagnoses patient with stomach cancer late in the illness (misdiagnosed for 3 years). By the time the doctor makes the diagnosis, the prognosis has fallen by 37.5%. The plaintiff dies.

**Old Theory:** A plaintiff may recover damages only by showing that the defendant's negligence more likely than not caused the ultimate outcome, in this case the patient's death (i.e. if patient had a 51% chance of survival, and the negligent misdiagnosis caused that chance to drop to zero, the estate is awarded *full* wrongful death damages.

- Problems with old theory: lets doctor off no matter what if someone has \<50% chance of survival.

- Inconsistent with aims of tort law -- allocating costs and risks of human injuries; fails to deter; immunizes whole areas of medical practice from liability.

**New Theory/Court (Marshall):** Recognizes loss of chance as a theory of injury.

- In order to prove loss of chance, a plaintiff must prove by a **preponderance of the evidence** that the physician's negligence caused the plaintiff's likelihood of achieving a more favorable outcome to be diminished.

- Limited this to medical malpractice actions.

**Damages:**

- P&S in two parts: (1) delay in treatment caused P&S-pay in full; (2) P&S in death-pay share.

- Death under wrongful death statute/medical malpractice, then take share.

- Share: chance of survival immediately preceding malpractice -- chance of survival as a result of medical malpractice.

**Limiting principles:** Medical malpractice

**Can someone who survived sue?** No, (under-deterrent results---need to show harm)

**Can only sue for limited % change, not 100% windfall at 51%** (Concept: Harm within the risk)

# 5 Scope of Liability -- Proximate Cause 

![](media/image9.png){width="7.486111111111111in" height="1.1611111111111112in"}

## 5.1 Scope of Liability -- Modern View

![](media/image7.png){width="7.527777777777778in" height="7.971527777777778in"}

**"Harriet's case"** -- one girl (contributes 1%) among a 7 male car-tippers (each male contributes 33% force to tip car): any four of 8 of the car tippers required to tip car over. **Anyone necessary to a possible sufficient cause has created 'causation in fact'**, including Harriet. But R3T 36 & Proximate cause excludes Harriet.

#### [Berry v. Sugar Notch]{.underline} (PA 1899): Driver's negligent conduct not proximate cause of accident

**Facts**: Driver was operating vehicle at a higher rate of speed than was legal when a tree fell down on the car, injuring him

**Court**: The driver's conduct was not the proximate cause of the accident; the could not have and should not have foreseen this injury

- Example of but-for sweeping you in and proximate cause weeding you out.

- Harms not within the risk expected for driving too fast.

##### [Gorris v. Scott]{.underline} (UK 1874): Sheep not kept in pen (to prevent disease) is not 'harm-within-the-risk' for overboard

**Gist:** Sheep washed overboard because they were not kept in a pen on the ship.

**Statutory violation:** because require sheep to be kept in the pen, but the purpose of the statute is to protect sheep from a contagious disease, not from being washed overboard, so there is no 'Harm within the Risk'

[Example of Secondary Risk]{.underline}: Defendant violates statute, requiring railroads to fence their rights of way. A 2-year old child gets injured from wandering onto the tracks. Main purpose is injury to livestock. Nonetheless, courts hold a secondary purpose includes risk to people, jury can decide.

##### [Wagner v. International Roadway]{.underline} (NY 1921): Cardozo: "danger invites rescue" so liable; train door left open

**Facts:** Defendant was negligent in failing to close the door to one of its rail cars; plaintiff\'s cousin is thrown out of car. Plaintiff was injured while attempting to rescue cousin. Principle risk was falling out. Was it also the proximate cause of the plaintiff/rescuer's harm?

**Cardozo:** It should be proximate cause -- says "danger invites rescue."

- It is foreseeable that others will rescue someone whose safety is put at risk by the defendant's actions.

- So harm to the rescuer can be within the cluster of risk that made defendant's actions negligent.

- Jury must decide the proximate cause.

### 5.2.1 Unforeseeable Plaintiffs

**Can work as a defense -- MINORITY RULE (NY)**

#### [Palsgraf v. Long Island Railway]{.underline} (NY 1928): Fireworks not foreseeable consequence of negligent act

**Facts**: Palsgraf (P) was standing on a platform of LIRR (D). A train stopped and a man, carrying a package, jumped aboard but seemed unsteady as if about to fall; a guard reached forward to help him in while another guard pushed from behind---the package was dislodged; it contained fireworks that exploded, throwing down some scales on the platform that struck and injured the plaintiff.

**Court (Cardozo):** No liability. Negligence and duty are strictly correlative; the orbit of danger as disclosed to the eye of reasonable vigilance is the orbit of duty. Because plaintiff was not in the zone of danger, the guard did not have a duty to her.

- Reasonable person could not foresee plaintiff, so there was only a duty to the passenger and package.

- There is no duty of care to anyone outside 'zone of danger' and boundaries determined by foreseeability of negligence.

- NO negligence in the air. Plaintiff and defendant must be connected---negligence arises from relationship, not from an act of negligence.

- Believes that the proximate component will be addressed in the measure of liability damages.

**Dissent (Andrews):** When an act is negligent, the defendant should be liable for damage that results to the world. Only cut off proximate cause by jury determination based on time/space, stream, directness, intervening/ superseding, and common sense.

- There is a duty to the world, not just relational duties (proximate cause is a fact/jury question)

\*\*\*Andrew's holding, with Cardozo's reasoning has stuck (proximate cause limits liability, but foreseeability is part of proximate cause) -- **hightlighted**.

**Posner**, on Cardozo in [Palsgraf]{.underline}:

1)  Difference in facts:

    a)  Crowd may have knocked over penny scale and damages may have arisen from latent psychiatric problem.

2)  Cardozo did not think there was negligence in the first place.

3)  Duty of care in negligence is a duty of foresight -- failing to take precautions against unforeseeable hazards does not violate it. Law of causation, remote or proximate, is thus foreign to the case\...because there is no tort to be redressed and no occasion to consider the damage that could be recovered.

### 5.2.2 Unforeseeable Extent of Harm

![](media/image6.png){width="7.527777777777778in" height="0.6902777777777778in"}

Explanations:

1)  Rejection of the rule would create so many practical problems that the rule is a necessity.

2)  Rule imposes a desirable kind of strict liability.

Exceptions

1)  Plaintiff must mitigate the extent of the losses he suffers

2)  Contributory or Comparative Negligence

#### [Benn v. Thomas]{.underline} (IA 1994): Thin-skull rule applied for car crash victim's death (is for PC & Damages)

**Facts:** Benn (P) died 7 days after Thomas (D) rear-ended the van in which he was riding -- he had a history of coronary disease, and accident was final straw. Benn (P) alleged that the TC erred in denying a jury instruction on the eggshell plaintiff rule. (COA reversed and remanded)

**Rule:** A tortfeasors whose act, superimposed upon a prior latent conditions, results in an injury, may be liable in damages for the full disability.

- Importantly: the rule applies to both damages AND proximate cause

**Court (McGiverin):** Apply the "eggshell plaintiff rule" or "thin-skull rule" and the tortfeasors is responsible for full damages resulting from the negligent act.

### 5.2.3 Unforeseeable Type of Harm

![](media/image3.png){width="7.521527777777778in" height="0.8777777777777778in"}

[Palsgraff]{.underline}, Cardozo: "there is room for argument that a distinction is to be drawn according to the diversity of interests invaded by the act, as where conduct negligent in that it threatens an insignificant invasion of an interest in property results in an unforeseeable invasion of an interest of another, as e.g. one of bodily security."

##### [In re Polemis]{.underline} (UK 1921): Sailors-unforeseen explosion; type /extent of damage is irrelevant; is it direct?

**Facts:** Sailors drop a wooden board while transporting petrol from one hold to another, causing a massive explosion.

**TC:** Employees were negligent in causing plank to fall and caused explosion from a spark. Spark could not have been reasonably anticipated from falling plank, only some damage to ship would have been foreseeable.

**Issue:** Was DF's negligence a proximate cause of the unforeseeable harm?

**Court (Bankes):** The anticipations (re: **extent of damage** and **type of damage**) of the person whose negligent act has produced damage are irrelevant; the damages claimed are not too remote.

- Rejects distinction between unanticipated *extent of harm* and *type of harm*. Says anticipation is irrelevant.

- Injury was a '**[direct']{.underline}** consequence of negligence, so hold him liable.

**Opinion (Scrutton):** It is relevant to determine whether any reasonable person would foresee that the act would cause damage; if he would not, then the act is not negligent; **once the act is negligent, the fact that is exact operation was not foreseen is immaterial.**

##### [The Wagon Mound]{.underline} (NY 1928): Overruled [In re Polemis]{.underline}; Is damage kind that reasonable man should foresee

**Facts:** A ship chartered by defendants spilled oil into a bay; defendants made no effort to disperse the oil. Then, the oil ignited and a fire spread, causing extensive damage to the plaintiff's equipment/dock.

**Defendant:** Argues that type of harm matters; Foreseeability is key to determining whether there are different types of harm.

**Plaintiff** fails to argue that it was foreseeable that oil would ignite and burn the dock; (probably because plaintiff is worried about contributory negligence.)

**Court:** The essential factor in determining liability is whether the damage **is of a kind such that a reasonable man should have foreseen.** A man should not be held liable for damage **unpredictably** **caused** by a reasonable man because it was direct or natural.

- Limited by [Smith v. Leech Brain]{.underline} (UK 1982), which holds that the defendant must take his victim as he finds him.

**Rejects:** Direct test from [In re Polemis]{.underline}; says that direct test creates a never-ending problem of causation.

- But there is still liability to an unforeseen extent of harm. In this case, jury found fire was unforeseeable type of harm, because the defendant did not know fire was possible.

### 5.2.4 Unforeseeable Manner of Harm

![](media/image4.png){width="6.575694444444444in" height="0.31527777777777777in"}

##### [Marshall v. Nugent]{.underline} (1c 1955): Car off-road; P hurt warning oncoming traffic; Foreseeability of manner irrelevant 

**Facts:** Defendant\'s driving forced the car the plaintiff was riding in to run off the road. The plaintiff was unharmed when running off road, but suffered injury after he walked down the road and was struck by a third vehicle as he was attempting to warn oncoming traffic of the danger ahead.

**Court:** Despite unusual manner of injury, did not preclude liability on part of defendant.

**Reasoning:** As long as plaintiff was injured roughly the same time and in roughly same place as was foreseeable, through same general forces as were foreseeable, it is not necessary that precise manner in which injury took pace has to be foreseeable.

### 4A.2.5 Intervention and Enablement

Can argue that the box of fireworks was an intervening element, etc.

**NJ Instruction 6.14: Intervening/ Superseding Cause**

When an intervening cause comes between the plaintiff's harm and the defendant's negligence, the defendant is not a contributing factor and is not liable.

\*\*Intervening cause **destroys causal connection** between defendant's negligence and plaintiff's injury.

- However, defendant does not get relieved from liability IF intervention of acts of 3^rd^ persons reasonably foreseeable. (If intervening cause, in ordinary and natural course of things, could have been anticipated, then the defendant's negligence can be a proximate cause).

## 5.3 Other Limitations on Liability

### 5.3.1 Judge, Jury and Underlying Purpose

**[Duty 🡪 Q of law; Scope of liability 🡪 Q of fact.]{.underline}**

- In most cases, it is obvious that either there was or was not proximate cause and the judge decides.

- Judge determines whether the defendant's negligence was not a proximate cause of the plaintiff's harm, as a matter of law, and thus the question is whether the proximate cause issue can even go to the jury ([Paslgraf]{.underline} and [The Wagon Mound]{.underline}).

- In exceptional cases, the jury decides whether there is proximate cause if it is not obvious (reasonable people could disagree).

**Underlying purpose of proximate cause**

- Proximate cause is a liability limiting doctrine.

- Negligent defendants shouldn't have to bear liability for all people or for all harm caused; enough is enough.

**Restatement 3^rd^: Comments e,f,g:** Why have scope of harm?

- Relative simplicity, fairness and proportionality, sufficient flexibility for fairness concerns.

### 5.3.2 No Duty

![](media/image2.png){width="7.527777777777778in" height="1.7472222222222222in"}

#### [532 Madison Ave. v. Finlandia]{.underline} (NY 2001): Building collapses; No duty so no need to pay economic damages

**Facts:** A section of a building collapsed, forcing temporary closure of businesses nearby. (Reverses 2/3 TC's)

**Issue:** Landholder's duty in negligence when plaintiff's sole injury is lost income, and viability of claims for public nuisance.

**Rule:** Foreseeability of harm does not define a duty -- it must arise from a special relationship. No duty to general public to protect them from economic harm.

**Court:** limits the scope of defendant's duty to those who have, as a result of the events, suffered personal injury or property damages; plaintiffs cannot collect for purely economic damages.

- Private individual cannot recover economic loss from a public nuisance if loss is commonly suffered.

<!-- -->

- **Policy:** Cannot collect damages for "pure" economic losses.

- **Alternatives:** (1) Calculability/size of damages; (2) limit to police line/geographical boundary; (3) limit to foreseeable harm.

##### [BP Claims]{.underline} -- NYT article -- Should BP's money go where the oil didn't?

1)  Problem: people affected by BP oil spill but not physically or directly

    a)  Example: tourist industry in St. Pete shot even though it wasn't remotely close to oil

    b)  How far can it stretch? People touched? People who miss opportunities in the future because people enjoyed vacationing elsewhere.

2)  Florida option: **[proximity claims]{.underline}** -- arguments of indirect harm.

    a)  Unsure how far this can go...

3)  Reference to [Palsgraf]{.underline}: "outside the zone of foreseeable danger"

**[Oil Pollution Act]{.underline}:** Caps liability for private losses with an exception for "gross negligence," "willful misconduct," or violation of an applicable safety statute.

- Provides for "damages equal to the loss of profits or impairment of earning capacity due to injury, destruction or loss of real property, personal property, or natural resources."

#### [Re: BP Oil Spill, Pure Stigma Claims]{.underline} (EDLA 2010): Court grants a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss

**Gist:** Court grants defendant's motion to dismiss "Pure Stigma Claims," "BP Dealer Claims," and "Recreation Claims."

**Facts:** All plaintiffs allege damages, although no oil touched their property.

**Issue:** Does OPA provide for damages? Court: No.

**"Pure Stigma Claims"** means claims alleging a reduction in the value of real property caused by the oil spill or other contaminant even though (1) the property was not physically touched by the oil and (2) the property was not sold. (E.g. someone who shows the differences in appraisal value for their home).

- General rule: Pure Stigma Claims not viable under general maritime or state law.

**Defendants** allege *intentional tort claims*, but intentional torts require actor intend 'consequences of an act,' not simply 'the act itself.'

**Court:** Apply [Robins Dry Dock]{.underline} rule and none of the groups can recover.

### 5.3.3 Federal Preemption and other

![](media/image10.png){width="7.527777777777778in" height="0.5027777777777778in"}

**[How to Argue Medical Device Preemption]{.underline}**:

- Arguments for defense lawyers on when federal law preempts state law claims asserted against medical device manufacturers.

- Arises from Supremacy Clause in Constitution -- federal laws "shall be the supreme law of the land"

- **Two types of preemption**

- **Express preemption** -- Congress adopted a statute explicitly displacing state law

- **Implied preemption** -- federal law occupies an entire regulatory field, leaving no place for state law, or when state law would conflict with federal law, either because simultaneous compliance with federal and state law is impossible or because state law thwarts the federal statutory scheme.

**[Communications Decency Act, 47 U.S.C. § 230:]{.underline}**

Purpose -- to protect private blocking and screening of offensive material.

- Policy to remove disincentives for developing and using blocking and filtering technologies for parents to restrict children's access to inappropriate online material.

- And to ensure vigorous enforcement of Federal criminal laws to deter/punish trafficking in obscenity, stalking, and harassment by means of computer.

- Protection for "Good Samaritan" blocking and screening of offensive material

- Federal preclusion for certain claims...

- Obligations of interactive computer service -- providers shall notify customer that parental control protections are commercially available that may assist the consumer in limiting access to material for minors.

- Effects on other laws:

- State law -- anything conflicting with this, but obviously not to enforce the state laws that are consistent

**[Judges are no longer giving tech companies an automatic pass at civil liability]{.underline}**, Fortune:

- SF passed ordinance imposing fines on home rental companies listing without registering with the city.

- AirBnB sued, saying the measure ran afoul of § 230 of the US Communications Decency Act

- "By protecting website operators from liability for content posted by others, the 20-year-old statute helped pave the way for the explosion of social media platforms..."

- Law has clearly gone further than it was intended to go -- now shields media & e-commerce sites

- "SF is regulating commercial transactions, not speech"

**Main point:** This ordinance that preempted less causal claims that would have made it prohibitively difficult to build technology in this country

**[Tech companies 'profit from ISIS' allege families of Orland victims in federal lawsuit]{.underline}**, WaPo:

- Families suing Google, Twitter and Facebook, saying tech companies had role in shooter's radicalization

- "'Without...Twitter, Facebook and Google (YouTube), the explosive growth of ISIS over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible', the lawsuit reads"

- Defense: free speech, mere conduit for online speech, rather than a speaker; CDA of 1995 precludes it;

- New lawsuit strategy: tech companies create new content that does not enjoy the protections of §230 when they marry advertising with an ISIS supporter's online posts.

- "While they didn't create the ad, and they didn't create the posting, by putting those things together, they created specific unique content"

- Court likely to reject and not hold online platform liable for content they host. "Your telephone carrier is not liable if you use it to hire a contract killer"

#### [Rylands v. Fletcher]{.underline} (UK 1866): Mill owner held strictly liable for water damage from reservoir

**Facts:** Fletcher's (coal mines, P) property was flooded by water, which broke out of a reservoir constructed and maintained by the Ryland (D, cotton mill) on their land. Rylands was not negligent (contractors were).\
**Court:** Neighbor is strictly liable for any damage caused by his non-natural use of land ("takes the risk upon himself")

- Cannot impose negligence, but uses strict liability based on the principle of 'escape'

- Traditional rule: if you bring something and it escapes, you are liable for anything that occurs during escape (usually animals), but extends to water, filth, stenches, etc.

**Rationales:** (1) Rylands is cheapest cost avoider; (2) Rylands benefits from building reservoir, so he should pay; (3) Want to deter reservoir building altogether?

**[House of Lords]{.underline}** (1868): Add the [natural v. unnatural]{.underline} distinction

- People had no way to take care if plaintiff brings unnatural condition-bringer of unnatural condition is CCA

- If it was natural, then others could expect that danger and take precautions (PL would be CCA in that case)

#### [Doerr v. Goldsmith]{.underline} (NY 2013): No SL for dog because no viscous propensities

**Facts:** Plaintiff rides a bike and gets injured when defendants let their dog run across the road to the other defendant; plaintiff could not have avoided dog and collided with it.

**Court:** There exists no evidence that the defendant had knowledge that her dog had a propensity to interfere with traffic, and her motion for summary judgment was properly dismissed.

- If owner knew or should have known about animals viscous propensities 🡪 strict liability

- For domestic animals that owner does not know or have reason to know to be abnormally dangerous 🡪 negligence (owners must take reasonable steps to prevent domestic animal from causing \[foreseeable?\] injuries.

**Rule:** NY common law does not allow negligence liability for injures caused by animals. Only imposes SL on cases where injury results from a **vicious animal** and owner is aware of vicious-character of animal.

- If animals escaped there could also be strict liability.

- Plaintiff wants to sue for negligence, court allows this by saying that in this case, the fact that it was an animal was irrelevant, and the animal's behavior did NOT cause the accident. Instead it was the owner's negligence for 'throwing animal' across the road. Likens it to throwing a football across a yard.

#### [Indiana Harbor Belt RR v. American Cyanamid]{.underline} (7c 1990): Negligence with greater care is adequate; no SL

**Facts:** Plaintiff operates a railroad that transports a toxic chemical manufactured by the defendants; plaintiff sues for damages arising out of a chemical leak (train company had to pay clean up costs of \$1M).

- Should leak of dangerous chemicals be under negligence or strict liability? Apply R2T factor test: (1) Negligence is enough to prevent accidental spill; (2) No substitute route to transport dangerous chemicals -- cost too much to re-route; (3) Danger is not from substance, but from mishandling of chemicals; (4) Residents fault for being closet to rail yard, shouldn't live in dangerous area

- State court applies Restatement, so Posner applies it here

**Court (Posner):** Negligence regime (greater care) is adequate to remedy and deter the accidental spillage of chemicals from railroad cars.

**Rule:** Manufacturer of a product is not considered to be engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity merely because the product becomes dangerous when it is handled or used in some way after it leaves his premises.

[Guille v. Swan]{.underline}

**Facts:** hot-air balloon landed w/out intent in garden in NYC. Crowd trampled vegetables in garden during rescue. Gardener sued balloonist for damage and won on SL.

- No negligence because they can't pinpoint landing at time. But shouldn't be ballooning.

![](media/image49.png){width="7.527777777777778in" height="0.5027777777777778in"}**Counter:** alternative routes exist (flying), residents don't have choice (poor), spills are inherent danger of transporting dangerous chemicals, use alternative chemicals

##### Richard Posner, [Economic Analysis of Law]{.underline}

1)  Strict Liability has the same effects on safety as negligence liability, provided that there is a defense of contributory negligence (usually is but under different name)

    a)  It changes level of activity but not nature of activity.

    b)  Courts are rarely inclined to determine the optimal level of activity.

2)  Changes in activity level by victims are also a method of accident avoidance -- but not considered under SL

3)  Differences between SL & Negligence

    a)  It is important to distinguish care and activity

    b)  Cost of administration -- simpler under SL

    c)  Strict liability operates to insure its victims of unavoidable accidents.

4)  When to use SL: Last resort when you cannot alter reasonable care and inappropriate car.

## \*Point: pot of money and you are really just determining the distribution and incentives

## 6.2 Strict Liability v. Negligence

**Benefits of Strict Liability v. Negligence:**

1)  **Reduces information costs** (costly to determine proof of negligence)

    a)  Destructdable evidence 🡪 Points toward SL here

2)  **Reduces error cost** (less fact-intensive than negligence); **more predictable**

3)  **Influences activity levels** **and research decisions**; incentivizes parties to consider alternative methods for conducting their activities.

4)  **Distributes loss** to the part in the best position to insure the costs of non-negligently caused accidents.

5)  Rights-based theories:

    a)  "**Benefit**" 🡪 Those who benefit from engaging from an activity should rightly bear the costs associated with that activity

    b)  "**Reciprocity**" 🡪 Strict liability should be imposed when an activity poses risks for potential victims that the victims do not also pose for others.

**Comparison:**

If you can take (more) care to eliminate the risk you are in the world of negligence.

If you cannot eliminate the risk with care, then you are in the world of strict liability.

**If SL works so well, why do we need negligence? Is SL better for finding the cheapest cost avoider?**

1.  Plaintiff's role? SL creates free harbor for victims so they don't need to take care

2.  Fairness 🡪 better to leave accident on victim, unless actor is blameworthy?

3.  Tradition 🡪 negligence is default, why change?

4.  Ignores notions of "blame" 🡪 punishing those that were not even negligent; Just shifting incentives in a 0-sum game.

5.  Reduces information costs, but brings more complaints and causes of action

6.  Tort law is more expensive than insurance (Posner)

## 6.3 Policy Arguments on Strict Liability

Current Regime (3^rd^ Restatement); Consider: (1) Risk of serious harm; and (2) Whether the activity is a matter of common usage; Further considerations: (1) locational appropriateness; (2) value to community

#### [Martin v. Reynolds Metals]{.underline} (OR 1959): Yes trespass; Aluminum chemicals poison farmland livestock

**Facts***:* Plaintiffs sue for trespass, claiming damage to their farmland from the operation of defendant's nearby aluminum reduction plant, which made his farmland unusable for raising livestock (they were poisoned).

- Damages awarded (71,500+20,000); however, only permissible if trespass (SOL), rather than nuisance.

**Nuisance**: actionable invasion of a possessor's interest in the use/employment of his land.

**Trespass**: actionable invasion of a possessor's interest in the exclusive possession of land.

**Holding***:* Defendant's conduct in causing chemical substances to be deposited upon the plaintiffs' land fulfilled all of the requirements under the law of trespass; deposit of particulates upon plaintiff's land was a direct intrusion under the definition of trespass

- Defines trespass: intrusion that invades possessor's interest in exclusive possession, regardless of whether the intrusion is visible or not.

- Important factor is the **feeling** the possessor has with respect to the land---sense of ownership should not be violated (so actual damage is not necessary).

- Fault relevant for punitive damages (although not in this case)

- My point: I think it ignores one other problem -- when you don't know in advance or have unpredictable damage cost -- then it again may be important to place that on more blameworthy person...

**Hypo:** Factory pollutes, causing \$100 damage to school net door. Factory can install \$50 scrubber to prevent pollution. Outcomes under different liability regimes:

+-------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------+
| Liability on Factory    | Factory pays school \$40 to install fan to prevent \$100 in damages.  | -\$40                   |
+=========================+=======================================================================+=========================+

\*Note: If school doesn't know fan exists, but factory does, liability should be placed on factory b/c they can most cheaply avoid the costs (-\$40 instead of no liability, which would be -\$50 on school for factory scrubber).

\*\**When there is **information asymmetry**, liability does matter*.\*\*

### 7.1.2 Defenses to Trespass -- Necessity (Public-complete; Private-compensate damage)

![](media/image44.png){width="7.527777777777778in" height="2.4256944444444444in"}

**Property Right explanations:**

- Between 2 innocent parties, the person whom nature put at risk should bear the cost of saving himself or property, rather than the owner of property that does the saving;

- Property 'ownership' includes the right not to have the safety of our property consciously and deliberately risked by other persons 🡪 Our sense of ownership is strong.

**Deterrence/Resource Allocation Explanation:**

- Threatening trespasser w/ liability gives them incentive to compare the cost of liability with the cost of alternatives that avoid liability (e.g. no liability, then just use the property)

- COASE THEOREM: usually defendant will make the right choice and will not risk danger; necessity gives defendant the right to make the choice to rescue himself, but charge him for doing so. This also assures that plaintiff will be compensated, so will actively not exclude defendant.

- If parties know most cost-efficient approach, then they will contract around the law.

- Public necessity? Plaintiff's property would have been destroyed anyways in the public emergency and historically couldn't hold towns and other public parties laible.

**[Reasonable v. Unreasonable]{.underline}**

- Looks like STRICT LIABILITY for the TRESPASSER, but NEGLIGENCE REGIME for the owner.

- Private necessity ONLY applies if the threatened harm to ship is greater than the harm to the dock. If harm is not greater, you are just a trespasser; no private necessity.

- This matters because if you are just trespassing, the owner can exclude you.

\*Even in cases of private necessity, the invader always has to pay for resulting damage.

\*\*Owner is only liable if invader's trespass was reasonable.

#### [Ploof v. Putnam]{.underline} (VT 1908): privilege born out of necessity in storm; dock cuts boat and is liable (unreasonable)

**Facts**: Plaintiff moored his ship at a dock on defendant's private island to avoid hazards of a storm; defendant's servant cut loose the ship, which was battered by the storm; ship was destroyed and plaintiff was injured

**Holding**: Court recognized a **privilege, born of necessity**, to use defendant's property---there was **no right to exclude** them from the dock.

- Untying ship can even be trespass on ship -- court awarded damages to plaintiff.

- Private necessity afforded plaintiff limited property interest in dock, which the defendant interfered with, so the defendant is liable for the harm that ensued from untying.

#### [Vincent v. Lake Erie Transportation]{.underline} (MN 1910): Boat damages dock-owner liable; Coase explanation

**Facts**: Defendant moored to plaintiff's dock; while the unloading of the boat was taking place a storm developed during which no captain would have been justified in attempting to navigate his vessel; defendant kept lines tied to dock; during the storm, the boat was lifted and thrown against the dock, resulting in damage of \$500

**Holding**: Though defendant is not liable for trespass, he is still liable for damages, especially because he made direct and deliberate efforts to keep the ship tied to the dock.

- **Defendant's privilege was conditional only**

- **Fair:** because it saved their boat

- **Encourages:** Conditional privileges means the dock owner is **less likely to exclude** from property.

**Dissent:** (1) Argues that the damage to the dock was the result of an inevitable accident. There is no fault on the shipmaster, so cost of damage should lie where it falls; (2) assumed the risk by being a dock owner.

- They were in contract, and ship owner used reasonable care, so the damages should fall where they lie.

- Could have had cables (or tires, etc.) to protect from damage (CCA?)

**Coase Theorem**: Because the parties are already contracting with one another, they could have bargained for emergency preemptively arties could have

**[Katrina rescuer is sued by boat owner]{.underline}**

- Man (Morice) saved more than 200 lives by commandeering a boat during flood, following Hurricane Katrina

- Public necessity?

- Boat owner (Lyons) sued -- but later dropped it because of media attention

- Said he didn't seek monetary damages, but wanted to hold people responsible for their actions.

## 7.2 Conversion

![](media/image45.png){width="7.527777777777778in" height="3.338888888888889in"}

#### [Kremen v. Cohen]{.underline} (9c 2003): Conversion for domain name, per CA law; no merger or tangibility requirement

**Facts:** Kremen registered sex.com with Network Solutions; Cohen is con-man who used fraud to get domain name registered to him; Cohen made lots of money using the domain name; Kremen originally won suit against Cohen, but could not collect against him; Kremen is now suing Network Solutions for Tort of Conversion.

**DC:** rejected tort of conversion on SJ because they followed Restatement and said domain name is not tangible, real property, so there is no conversion. Were reluctant to impose conversion because of SL

**Court (Kozinski):** CA rejects Restatement's *merger requirement*, and instead all property rights (including intangibles) may be subject to conversion tort, which is based on strict liability.

- Not allowing liability means Network Solutions is safe from liability, even if they are negligent.

- [Payne]{.underline}: CA court held conversion of shares in a corporation (not share certificates) because tort law recognizes conversion of every species of personal property.

- [A & M Records]{.underline}: copies of music can be converted. Does not depend on whether IP rights were merged in a document and IP property right is not merged into the record, or any other physical media of music.

**Fairness**: Nothing unfair about holding company responsible for giving away someone else\'s property even if they were not at fault. Network Solutions should be liable and forced to try to recoup its losses by chasing down Cohen.

**Deterrent** **Effect**: Worried that SL would stifle registration system and increase fees. BUT more regulations are good; even if more expensive, we should increase safety.

**Role of Courts**: Leave to legislature? Courts shouldn't allow any regulation while waiting for legislature to act. Court can apply common law until legislature tells courts otherwise.

## 7.3 Trespass to Chattel

![](media/image42.png){width="7.527777777777778in" height="2.8006944444444444in"}

##### [Intel v. Hamdi]{.underline} (CA 2003): sending emails does not constitute trespass to chattels

**Facts**: Hamdi, a former Intel employee, sent six mass e-mails to employee addresses on Intel\'s electronic mail system criticizing Intel's employment practices; Intel sues for trespass to chattels.

**Holding**: The mere sending of electronic communications that are asserted to have caused injury only because of their contents does **not** constitute an actionable trespass to a computer system through which the messages are transmitted; the decisions finding electronic contact to be a trespass to computer systems have generally involved some actual or threatened interference with the computers\' functioning.

## 7.4 Nuisance

![](media/image43.png){width="7.527777777777778in" height="5.655555555555556in"}

**[Coming-to-the-nuisance problem]{.underline}:** What if the plaintiff erects a home near a factory? Does the fact that the plaintiff should have known about the emissions before moving insulate factory?

- No, creates undesirable development race. Should not award the first active user of land.

- Re-scope: maybe first use of land is using the land as 'woods' and not developing it.

- At some point, nuisance creator must yield to neighbors, regardless of first user. Perhaps a whole suburb surrounds the factory. The factory owner is not really acting unreasonably, but he is making greater interference than the suburb should have to tolerate under the circumstances.

#### [Boomer v. Atlantic]{.underline} (NY 1970): cement factory; liability rule-P wins (permanent damages); Box 3

**Facts**: Defendant operates a large cement plant near Albany; neighboring owners allege injury to their property from dirt, smoke and vibration emanating from the plant. **Lower courts:** Deny injunction.

**Default NY law:** if there is nuisance, court imposes both damages and injunction.

- **Alternatives**: (1) Court grants injunction but postpones its effect to a specified future date to give opportunity for technical advances to permit defendant to eliminate the nuisance; (2) Grant permanent damages to plaintiffs

**Court:** Declines injunction (changes NY law) because: (*actually grants injunction until permanent damages paid*)

1)  Cost-benefit analysis -- cost of injunction is much higher than harm caused

2)  Cement plant is important to economy of area

3)  Saving nuisance law! Must pay for future damages resulting from nuisance.

- Court does not enjoin because cement plant is important to economy of area AND also the cost of discontinuing the nuisance was grossly disproportionate to the amount of harm the nuisance was causing.

**Dissent**: thinks that Cement Company should not be able to pollute indefinitely upon paying permanent damages. Court is essentially licensing the pollution. Burden should be on DF to find a way to fix air pollution problem.

##### [Spur v. Del Webb]{.underline} (AZ 1972): cattle feedlot; no liability-D wins (permanent damages); Box 4

**Facts**: Plaintiff expanded its residential subdivision toward defendant's cattle feedlot until the flies and odors drifting onto the development made sale of more units impossible

**Court:** P may enforce property right (injunction), but must pay D for cost of moving feed lot.

- Justification: P could have foreseen this nuisance and taken advantage of cheaper land values of rural areas to build, so should pay for those forced to leave.

- Holding is limited to where the developer foreseeably came to land and made it necessary to grant an injunction against a lawful business, and that business has no adequate relief.

**[What if the Court incorrectly sets the damages?]{.underline}**

**Awards too high damages?** 🡪 Defendant will still pay the damages as long as the damage amount is less than the loss that arises from discontinuing the activity; otherwise it functions like an injunction (parties can still bargain)

**Awards too low damage?** 🡪 e.g. true damage to plaintiff = \$100; cost of stopping the conduct = \$50; damage award = \$40 🡪 defendant will continue the activity because the damage award does not cover the stop of discontinuation; the plaintiff, however, can bargain and pay the extra \$10 to prevent the damage; functions like no liability, but parties can still bargain & work it out.

**Court sets injunction wrong? 🡪** Parties can still figure it out, but since P & D can demand a lot of money, may lead to strategic holdouts, **extortion**, etc.

- Even if court doesn't make a mistake, it doesn't foreclose bargaining for a more efficient outcome (Coase), assuming limitations of Coase theorem do not apply.

#### [eBay v. MercExchange]{.underline} (2006): Apply injunctions in patent suits case-by-case; inappropriate here

**Facts:** Patent infringement on the \"Buy It Now\" patent held by ME, infringed by Ebay. Ebay tried to license patent from ME but could not reach an agreement. In patent suit, jury found patent was valid, that petitioners had infringed the patent, and damages were appropriate, but ME wanted an injunction as well. **TC:** no injunction because ME doesn't practice. **CC:** granted injunction. **SC**: infringed patents shouldn't automatically get injunction.

**Court (Thomas):** 4-factor test is tradition and should not depart from it.

- **DC error**: not automatic due to P's lack of commercial activity. **Circuit** **error**: didn't apply 4-factor test.

- Patents are personal property, and do have right to exclude, but right to exclude is not the same as a right to an injunction. The decision whether to grant injunctions in patent suits should be decided **case-by-case**.

**Concurrence (Roberts, 3):** Courts generally granted injunctions for most patent infringement cases b/c usually patent property right implicates first 2 factors of test 🡪 doesn't favor idea of courts setting a price for patent w/ damages b/c unfair to inventor in garage that only makes money by selling inventions 🡪 drags inventor into courts to battle for price of patent when market should set the price

- BUT patent owner is not entitled to permanent injunction to justify a general rule.

**Concurrence (Kennedy, 4): Concerned about patent trolls** - an injunction can be employed as a bargaining tool to charge exorbitant fees to companies that seek to buy licenses to practice the patent.

- Also considering the burgeoning number of patents over business methods and their consequences, the potential **vagueness** and **suspect validity** of some patents may affect 4-factor calculus. 🡪 Concerned about modern tech and how times are changing.

**Notes:**

- **Pro-damages 🡪** thick market, so easy to determine price.

- **Pro-injunction 🡪**eBay disregarded the opinion to license the technology; injunction would encourage bargaining between parties.

**[US v. Western Radio]{.underline}** (OR 2013, packet 3, pg. 60) 🡪 Monetary damages are inadequate to compensate continuing trespass because plaintiff cannot recover damages for harm that has not yet occurred (*but*, Court's rejection of a categorical rule here IS a categorical rule)

## 8.3 Legal Remedies

### 8.3.1 Compensatory Damages

![](media/image38.png){width="7.527777777777778in" height="8.968055555555555in"}

**Beware of : [CERTAINTY]{.underline} in the damages**

#### [The Equipoise Effect]{.underline}, Bert Huang

**Disgorgement:** allows person to break even.

**Substituting disgorgement for any other remedy**, part of the time, can emulate the incentive effect of using that other remedy all of the time. Therefore, in theory, courts can sometimes substitute disgorgement for compensatory or expectation damages without undoing the benefits of harm internalization. This can be especially useful when harm is hard to measure.

1)  Introduction

    a)  **Deterring polluters:** better to disgorge profits or pay damages based on harm?

    b)  **Typical view:** More disgorgement means more deterrence; many courts have found that to be a "strong medicine" that should be used "sparingly"; Viewed as OVER-Deterrence

    c)  **BUT:** if you know that you will disgorge, your act is not costly or gainful, it is just a wash. Therefore, it is not a complete deterrence.

2)  **Huang: Substituting disgorgement for any other remedy, part of the time, can emulate the incentive effect of using that other remedy all of the time.**

    a)  Example: patent infringer disgorges net profits (breaking even) or pays compensation for harm to patentee (thus keeping profits while also paying for patentee's loss). Anticipating uncertain mix of potential remedies, start-up founder should be expected to make the *same* decision as if she faced only the harm-based damages with certainty. If her net gains \> compensation, then she will infringe and with some probability disgorge. Likewise, if profits \< compensation, then it is not worthwhile for her to infringe.

        i)  **Logic**: some chance of breaking even, but otherwise enjoying a net gain, is still a net gain overall.

    b)  **My problem**: **I don\'t think the probability you won't receive that profit is a 0-sum game if you only can dedicate so much time to different activities with profit...If you use the technical profit terminology, it is nearly impossible to estimate...**

    c)  **Benefits:** provides flexibility in switching between remedies easing tradeoffs with non-deterrence concerns in a given case, such as distributional effects or certain notions of justice.

3)  **Conditions**

    a)  **Not required:** nothing requires harms and gains be similar in value; logic does not rely on the use of a liability test for predetermining which acts should be deterred.

    b)  **Particular application:** common problem for courts and regulators---harm based damages are often hard to measure (particularly compensatory damages, with resulting systematic underdeterrence). **Huang wants to substitute disgorgement when harm-based damages are biased or hard to assess**.

    c)  **Factors pushing actor from equipoise to complete deterrence:** litigation costs, reputation costs, opportunity costs.

        i)  **Complications with determining harm-based or gain-based award**.

4)  **Using equivalence**

    a)  **Limitations:** (1) actor's gains may be hard to measure; (2) substitution plainly sacrifices the aim of accurate compensation for those injured parties who do end up with a disgorgement award.

    b)  **Problems of measuring harm:** inchoate and future harms are particularly difficult; also-subjective or emotional harms; even economic harms, such as lost profits or market prices when no market exists...

        i)  **CL approach:** ranges from guesswork to no damages at all. If a court decides that the amount of damages cannot be shown with **"reasonable certainty"** then the award may end up being zero-even when the harms are very real.

### 

### 

### 8.3.2 Punitive Damages

**[Purpose]{.underline}:**

**Old reasons:** exemplary (set example); compensate for intangible damages (P&S weren't allowed yet)

1.  **Deterrence -- cost benefit analysis fails or we want to stop activity**

    1.  **"Absolute Deterrence" --** **gains-based (e.g. disgorgement)** eliminates the defendant's gains and profits; tries to **stop** the bad behavior

    2.  **"Optimal Deterrence" -- harms based -** based on harm to P, and usually employed when likelihood of getting caught is low, so charge wrong-doer for *every* plaintiff that is harmed, *or* for intangible harms: (1) incentivizes plaintiff to sue \[think small compensatory claims & private enforcement\] and (2) internalizes harm that is difficult to detect or that the defendant conceals. (Still can overdeter-death penalty for petty)

2.  **Punishment**

    1.  **Justice & retribution** for the defendant, plaintiff, and society

**[When]{.underline}?** Defendants conduct is outrageous: gross negligence, willful, wanton, reckless indifference to others, or other deplorable behavior. Profit is factor. More justified if being caught is unlikely or compensatory damages small.

**[Why constrain punitive damages]{.underline}?**

- **Burden: preponderance \< reasonable doubt:** damages begin to resemble criminal punishments (criminal trials have higher burden of proof; the same punishment shouldn't be imposed in civil trials with lower burden)

- **Encourages vindictive, revenge-seeking states of mind in society**

- **Uncertainty and "sheer unpredictability" of the damage awards** ([BMW]{.underline} gives anecdotal evidence of the range); arbitrary. Makes it harder to settle, because you don't know the amount of damages.

- **Bankruptcy:** some companies should exist even after wrong-doing.

- **Outrageous and unpredictable results** (unfair)-also makes it harder for D to know price of deterrence

- **DPC requires fair notice**

![](media/image35.png){width="7.527777777777778in" height="1.6756944444444444in"}

**[Vicarious Liability]{.underline}** (**respondeat superior**): Liability for injury caused by the conduct of another party (i.e. liability of an employer for torts committed by employees)

- Who is an employee? When is a tort committed within the scope of employment?

**[Repetitive Awards]{.underline}** ([Grace v. Waers]{.underline}): In a mass tort action, court refused to bar multiple awards of punitive damages; evidence of prior awards is permitted in the second step of bifurcation, which allows defendant to build a record for a due process argument based on the cumulative effect of prior awards

- Courts can award both compensatory and punitive damages repetitively.

- Too much: no deterrence after a while, what if company goes bankrupt (e.g death penalty for low-crime, who would stop there?)

- Too little: even all of CDs & PDs might not be enough to stop tortious action.

- Not enough P bringing case 🡪 not enough awarded for optimal deterrence.

**Offset punitive damages for future plaintiffs?** Requires a guessing game, you can try to estimate total amount of PD and divide it based on anticipated defendants, but what if estimate is wrong? And how do we decide upon a fixed punitive damage number, especially if not pegged to CD?

How do we make sense of words like "reprehensibility" or other confusing verbal formulations of PD's?

- Court's don't explain what they mean-no guidance. Completely open-ended. Just make best arguments based on past cases, policy rationales, etc.

- Very limited containing power -- you can argue whatever you want. You can use words to work around even suggested quantitative caps.

**How to use the limitations?**

Exxon 1:1 cap is ONLY binding on federal common law cases (particularly, maritime case)

- When **persuasive**? Other federal PD cases based on federal statutes or tort law

- Only **argumentatively useful**? Cases that are similar but not in the same jurisdiction.

**State court limitations** ONLY bind in the particular state

**Constitutional limits** of PD (BMW/SF/PM) 🡪 binding for EVERYONE because of Supremacy Clause

#### 

#### [Exxon v. Baker]{.underline} (2008): permits punitive damages; \$2.5B capped at 1:1; oil tanker spill case 

**Facts:** A drunk captain (relapsed alcoholic) set ship to auto-control during the most crucial maneuver of his trip, crashing an oil tanker that caused unprecedented damage; Jury: \$5B; COA remitted to \$2.5B

**Issue 1:** Does **maritime law permit punitive damages** in cases of **corporate derivative liability**? **Yes**

- Punitive damages are warranted by "*outrageous, grossly negligent, willful, wanton, reckless, reprehensible, heinous, callous, and profit-oriented*" conduct / "*extraordinary wrongdoing*" for the purposes of retribution and deterrence

**Issue 2:** Does the Clean Water Act **preempt** punitive damages? **No**

- A statute geared to protecting "water" was not intended to eliminate oil companies' common law duty to refrain from injuring the bodies and livelihoods of private individuals, and **Congress must be explicit in legislation to warrant preemption**.

**Issue 3:** Was the \$2.5B judgment **excessive** under maritime common law? **Yes**

- A ratio of no more than one-to-one between compensatory and punitive damages is generally appropriate in maritime cases (\$507 million in this case) 🡪 stark **unpredictability** (limited by the ratio) frustrates the goal of punitive damages to deter

- Some states use a 3:1 ratio in cases involving some of the **most egregious conduct**, including malicious behavior and dangerous activity carried on for the purpose of increasing a tortfeasor's financial gain

- Data put the **median ration** for the entire gamut of circumstances at 0.65:1; this Court considers a slightly higher ratio appropriate for maritime cases

- **Court rejects a "capped" alternative** 🡪 no standard tort or contract injury makes it difficult to determine a particular dollar cap; seems more intuitive to make the punishment proportional to the harm done

**Reading Notes:**

- **Rationales for punitive damages:** **[Early]{.underline}**: punishment for extraordinary wrongdoing; deterrence; example; intangible injuries (narrow compensatory options at time). **[Modern]{.underline}**: **retribution and deterring** harmful conduct; hard to detect (increasing chances of getting away with it); value of injury and corresponding compensatory are small (low incentives to sue);

- **State regulation of punitive damages**: **varies**-some award rarely or not at all (e.g. none in NE); only when authorized by statute (e.g. LA, MA, WA); MI-only supportable as compensatory not truly punitive; CN-limited to expenses of bringing legal action (attorneys fees, etc.). **Typically first by jury:** then reviewed to see if reasonable; some have statutory limits or maximum ratios

- **Outside US**: used LESS: UK-only available if oppressive, arbitrary or unconstitutional action by government servants, injuries designed by D to yield larger profit than likely cost of compensatory damages, and must be by statute; strict ratios. **Canada/Australia:** only for outrageous conduct, rarely issued. **None in Civil Law**-not only decline to recognize punitive damages but refuse to enforce them as against public policy.

- **Problem**: **Unpredictability**-unfair inconsistency? (FN17: decline to rely on Exxon research)

- **Constitutional limit**: Due Process-**no simple formula!** But here: further limit because maritime law.

- **How to eliminate unpredictability:** (1) verbal-doesn't work, very inconsistent; (2) look to States adopting criminal-law pattern of quantified limits---but nature of tort varies too much; (3) **look at ratio to compensatory**-peg punitive damages to a maximum multiple.

- **Picking ratio:**

- **What influences Court** in deciding how to constrain punitive damages?

- Federal & state statutes; criminal law; international law; actual awards and jury instructions in other cases

#### [State Farm v. Campbell]{.underline} (2003): \$145M award neither reasonable nor proportionate; DPC

**Facts:** Plaintiffs introduced evidence that State Farm's decision to take the case to trial was a result of a national scheme to meet corporate fiscal goals by capping payouts on claims company wide; state supreme court reinstated \$145 million punitive damages award

**Gore Guideposts:** (1) The degree of reprehensibility of the defendant's misconduct; (2) The disparity between the actual or potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award; and (3) The difference between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparative cases

- \(1\) Courts are instructed to determine the *reprehensibility* of a defendant by considering whether: the harm caused was physical as opposed to economic; the tortious conduct evinced an indifference to or a reckless disregard of the health and safety of others; the target of the conduct had financial vulnerability; the conduct involved repeated actions or was an isolated incident; and the harm the result of intentional malice, trickery, deceit, or mere accident.

- \(2\) Few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages, to a significant degree, will **satisfy due process**; ratios greater than those previously upheld may comport with due process where "a particularly egregious act has resulted in only a small amount of economic damages."

**Court:** The \$145 million award was neither reasonable nor proportionate to the wrong committed.

**[BMW]{.underline}:** 2 cases where dealer repainted and resold as new; inconsistent results posited problem.

#### [Phillip Morris v. Williams]{.underline} (2007): \$79.5M PD for cigarettes; DPC bars punitive award from harm to 3rd-party

**Facts:** Widow of Jesse Williams (died of smoking-related lung cancer) sued Phillip Morris, cigarette manufacturer for fraud based on ads and sponsored studies that made cigarettes seem less dangerous than they actually were. The court awarded Williams \$821,485 in CD & \$79.5M in PD. OR TC-lower to \$32M; App. Restored \$79.5M.

**No decision on ratio question.**

**Rule:** from [BMW]{.underline}: DPC requires PD to reflect (1) reprehensibility of D's conduct; (2) "reasonable relationship" to harm to victim; presence (or absence) of "sanctions" (e.g. criminal penalties). No binding limit, but 2-4 guided max.

**Court (Breyer): DPC of 14 limits PD for 3P's.** Likes standards/discretion, doesn't want to answer ratio question.

- **DPC** bars punitive damages for harm caused to individuals not involved in the litigation, but evidence of that harm can be used to determine reprehensibility; state courts cannot authorize procedures that create an unreasonable and unnecessary risk of any such confusion occurring

- **Considerations:** actual difference between reprehensibility and punishment; doesn't want double punishment; BUT optimal deterrence may require punishing more because otherwise, PM won't be properly deterred to stop tortious action, especially if making a lot of money.

**Dissent (Stevens):** Difference eluding. Worried about jury confusion. Should just allow jury to consider harm to non-parties. PD is sanction for public harm of D's conduct, so it should be allowed. Awarding CD to 3^rd^ parties is DP violation, but PD serves a different purpose. Courts should be reluctant to expand DPC.

**Dissent (Thomas):** Constitution does not constrain PD awards.

**Dissent (Ginsburg):** PD is to punish, not compensate, so OR is right. Phillip Morris only contested refusal to give jury instruction, which was a confusing instruction anyways. And court should narrowly tailor its holding to this jury instruction.

#### 

**[Pinto Case]{.underline}**

**Facts:** Pinto struck in rear by another car, results in gas tank rupture and fire. Driver killed and passenger burnt. Jury: CD is \$2.5 mill. and PD is \$125 mill. Trial court reduces to \$3.5 mill. Memo surfaces that Ford had compared cost of safer fuel system and decide not worth redesign; life valued at \$200,000; jury angry and give big PD.

- Ironically, the memo was not about design of Pinot and the \# use was from regulatory agency.

- Paradox of tort law 🡪 we like cost-benefit analysis, but public attitudes says this is reprehensible. Raises question of viability of risk-benefit standard.

## 8.4 Statutory Damages

**[Framing important]{.underline}: willing to accept is higher than willing to pay**

**[Statutory damages]{.underline}** are set by legislatures.

**[Why statutory damages?]{.underline}**

Criminal-like punishment; Fair notice & deterrence; Predictability; Incentive to sue; Hard to calculate actual damages

- *Examples*: Copyright, cyper-squatting, hacking, spam, littering, disclosure/fraud, employment

**[Constitutional limit]{.underline}:** whether the penalty prescribed is **so severe and oppressive as to be wholly disproportionate to the offense and obviously unreasonable.**

- Statutory damages are not to be confined or proportioned to the loss of the private party.

- The legislature may adjust damages for the **public wrong** rather than the **private injury**.

- Usually, statutory damages work linearly: statute gives a \$ range for each violation, and jury will total up the cost per violation.

**[Critique of Statutory damages]{.underline} (Linear v. Concurrent damages):**

- Awards are linear, why not use concurrent damages?

- **Concurrent damages** are awarded in criminal sentencing -- allows judges to use **discretion to collapse multiple, redundant counts** into one count.

- Counting linearly is usually **arbitrary**: it is like a lottery---can over or underdeter.

- E.g. email hacking over a week, depending on whether hacker logs out frequently or not; can range 1-100s

- Normal judicial remedies (DPC, excessive fine constraints, CL remitter) don\'t work well in context of statutory damages and are overly blunt.

- Fudging, where you artificially lower each count award when counting is high also creates inaccuracy because in the next similar case, the fictionally low price per violation may be seen as a benchmark and lead to under-deterrence for next violator.

- Flexibility is needed to allow **case-by-case tailoring** of the structure of how damages accumulate.

- **Danger of concurrent damages:** introduces **judicial freedom** (more risk of bias or variability in outcomes)

**[Copyright Infringement and Remedies]{.underline}:**

**Statutory damages option** (instead of actual damages and profits); strict limits on payout per infringement;

- Actual damages are difficult in patent suits.

**[Sony v. Tenenbaum]{.underline}** (CA 2013, packet 4, page 110):

- *Facts*: Defendant illegally downloaded and distributed copy-written music against the warnings of his parents and school

- *Issues*: (1) What is the correct standard for evaluating the constitutionality of an award of statutory damages under the Copyright Act? (2) Did an award of \$675k violate defendant's due process?

- *Holding*: (1) *Gore* cannot logically apply to an award statutory damages under the Copyright Act (under second prong, plaintiff need not prove actual damages and under third prong, court would have to compare award against itself); instead, under *Williams,* **to determine whether the penalty prescribed is so severe and oppressive as to be wholly disproportioned to the offense and obviously unreasonable,** Court must examine the **legislative purpose of the statutory damages and defendant's behavior**; (2) award was not unreasonable

\*\*\*There IS purely emotional harm when defendant mishandles the dead body of plaintiff's loved one or accidentally sends a telegram mis-announcing the death of a loved one

**Non-economic damages caps?** Allow for fair compensation while preventing excessive, emotionally driven jury awards; but would this constrain corporate accountability? (*Ford Pinto* suit -- permits preemptive cost-benefit analyses with human lives) -- prospect of unprecedented damages award reduces this incentive

+=======================================+===============================================+

**Why:** (1) awards can be too high (2) assessment of value of P&S is subjective and varies between juries (3) creates uncertainty for potential D's that could cause over-deterrence.

**Additur/Remittitur:** if too high or low, court orders new trial or specified amount for P&S

- Additur: jury award unduly low; Remittitur: jury award unduly high

**[Alternative]{.underline}: Ceiling/cap on P&S awards**: **unfair** to seriously injured victims, and less injured make no sacrifice

### 8.5.3 Speculative

**[Need to be "Reasonably certain"]{.underline}:** CL -- not reasonably certain 🡪 No damages

#### [Wal-Mart v. Dukes]{.underline} (2010): Scalia denies class action; need proof of general policy for 'commonality'

**Facts:** Class action suit, all female employees (1.5M former and current) sue Wal-Mart for Title VII discrimination based on disparate impact on a facially neutral policy of allowing managers broad discretion in pay and promotional decisions. Class seeks both **injunctive** and **declaratory** relief, as well as **back-pay damages**.

**Court (Scalia):** **Denies class action**; **General policy:** Plaintiffs need "significant proof" of general policy, so they did not qualify for 23(b)(2) class here.

- **Common answer (method of redress):** in order to prove that they had the **same injury**;

- **Alternatives:** Scalia points to other reasons that might account for the fewer promotions and lower pay

- **Look for:** **single actor, single policy, single device** (employment/promotion test)

**Back-pay:** court classifies as "damages," not injunctive

**Policy concern:** Courts are worried about how once class action is certified, company defendants almost ALWAYS settle 🡪 worried about extortion from plaintiffs

**Dissent (Ginsburg):** Disparate impact has always been sufficient for class action under Title VII 🡪 changing law

- Class about pattern and practice; point is not a single manager, but a policy affecting all class members

- Scalia is confused, he is doing predominance analysis in commonality

#### [Parko v. Shell]{.underline} (7c 2014): validate members after cert.; 'commonality' issue predominance needs evidence

**Facts:** A class of 150 property owners sued an oil refinery for injury from a benzene groundwater leak; property owners want to sue Shell Oil for lost property values; **DC:** approve cert; defendants appeal using 23(f)

**Court (Posner):** **(1) Numerosity:** determine which class members have valid claim *after* certification-150 ok here;

**(2) Commonality-collapse commonality and predominance together; Mere assertion that common issues predominate insufficient -- resolve before certification**

- When factual disputes bear on issues vital to certification (sources of contamination/whether it reached water supply), the court must receive evidence and resolve disputes before certification.

**[Met-Coil]{.underline} case:** TCE contaminated groundwater from a leak in a storage container.

- Posner says this satisfies common answer requirement: (1) TCE entered water supply from wells; (2) same and single source of TCE; (3) theory presented on how contaminated well-water depressed property values of all homes in the area.

### 9.1.2 Issue classes and subclasses

**[Reasons why damages and injuries don't need to be same to certify class (23(c)(4) & (5)):]{.underline}**

**Sub-classes:** break class actions into sub-classes later (different washing machine makes & geographies, etc.)

**Issue class:** certify issues that are common, take out non-common issues, then after common issues are decided, court can de-certify the class and let them settle the rest of the cases individually.

\*\*\*Use subclasses, issue classes, phases

##### [Butler v. Sears]{.underline} (7c 2013): Posner on washing machines; 'issue classes/subclasses'; no identical damages requirement

**Facts:** Class action complaining about defects in washing machine

**Court (Posner):** **issue class with phase:** there is no possibility that the damages could be attributed to acts of defendants that are not challenged on a class-wide basis

- **Commonality:** all members of the mold class attribute their damages to defective washing machines

- **No requirement that every member of the class have identical damages:**

- Damages of individual class member scan can be readily determined in individual hearings, in settlement negotiations, or by the creation of subclasses.

- If class certification as limited to identical damages, then defendants would escape liability for tortious harms of enormous aggregate magnitude but not so widely distributed as to be remediable in individual suits

\*\*\*MDL place more pressure on defendants to settle, and can thus be analyzed under the chart above.

**[Amchem]{.underline}:**

- A 23(e) hearing is necessary, but not sufficient; settlement must still meet all 23(a) and 23(b) criteria

  - "Specifications designed to protect absentees by blocking unwarranted or overbroad class definitions demand undiluted, even heightened attention in the settlement context."

  - Commonality & typicality requirements of 23(a) might be satisfied because all class members have a common interest in settlement

- A settlement for asbestos claims that included all future defendants did not meet the 23(a) adequacy requirement (interests of future defendants conflicted with those of present) and the 23(b) predominance requirement; *perhaps* sub-classes could have solved

**Why might parties want to certify and settle at the same time?**

- **Global peace:** settle and bar everyone else from suing in future.

- **Negotiate:** cheaper than litigating the whole case

- **Collusion:** lawyers may want to collude with bad settlement---defendant's layers may bribe them.

**[Due Process concerns]{.underline}:** because it can bind absent parties, it raises due process concerns.

In order to be bound by class action, absent party has to have common interest with class of previous case and has to be adequately represented ([Hansberry v. Lee]{.underline})

#### [In re Deepwater Horizon]{.underline} (2014): January class certification & March contract dispute

**Facts:** started as MDL, but BP made Settlement Agreement and Class Certification for all cases. **DC certified** the class and settlement, emphasizing the 'uncapped compensation' that would be available so benefits to one member of class would not reduce or interfere with benefit for another class member.

- **BP in rush to settle:** feared looking bad in criminal trial against USG, etc.

- **Settlement agreement:** No cap on fund; replaced the voluntary fund (GCCF) run by Feinberg (\$20B); formula does not require proof of causation (just economic evidence)---inevitable problem.

- **BP regrets this:** because there are claimants who didn't actually get injured now collecting compensation

**[January Class Certification Challenge (FRCP 23):]{.underline}**

**Gist:** BP does not object because they agreed to class certification, but it is challenged by 3^rd^ parties

- **[Commonality]{.underline}:** D says commonality requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that class members have suffered the same injury 🡪 preclude all plaintiffs that suffered an injury.

- Does not need to relate to damages component of claim; same injury can refer to the same conduct related to defendant's liability;

- **A single common question is sufficient**; long list of common questions; court does not need to determine whether class contains individuals who have not suffered injury, because that is part of merits

- **Adequacy:** BP argues that because class includes people not injured, the inclusion of non-injured members, makes injured members worse off because less \$ available, and hurts their bargaining power during negotiations.

- **DC:** named plaintiffs adequate with category of loss and adequate counsel.

- Uncapped compensation available under agreement ensuring adequate remedy

- **Subclass:** Cobb Objectors wanted this for states and members better off under GCCF claims process

- BUT: doesn't need to accommodate every possible weighted interest; claim under federal law, so no need for state-by-state; incorporated to agreement because sub-class based on geography, level of harm based on proximity to coast.

- **[Predominance]{.underline}:** wide disparity in damages doesn't preclude class certification with common issue

**[March Contract dispute---causation problem:]{.underline}**

**Issue:** settlement agreement didn't require an extrinsic causation analysis in paying damages. Is this ok if class certification did require causation?

**Contract has explicit language disclaiming need for proof of causation**

- Only required V or U profit curve, so after spill, business down then up (can be under *and* over-inclusive)

- However, the contract did make claimants **certify** that they were injured because of oil spill 🡪 gets around class certification problem because there is an **affidavit of causation, and subject to perjury and investigation**

**BP challenges:** "*BP, in essence is arguing that only if a claimant can prove its injuries are traceable to BP's conduct will Exhibit 4B's forswearing of the need for proof of traceability to BP's conduct apply*"

- Says there will be a chilling effect for future class actions and settlements

- Unfair to those actually injured if uninjured gets monies 🡪 hurts legitimacy

- BP just wants administrator to screen claims that are super obviously fraudulent

**Why is this settlement good?**

- Proof of causation may be expensive; this helps people who deserve it but are disadvantaged

- Screening takes too much time and money

- Administrator can make mistakes, better to have false positives

- Larger deterrent effect on oil companies to take more care
