# Attack Outline

Standard of Review

Burden of Proof

Procedural Posture

**For the exam:**

- Frame answer in terms of procedure

- Also be aware of what role you are in and what kind of document you are producing.

- Fondle the facts! Which facts are most important. Use facts to distinguish from cases.

- Issue, Standard, Application, Conclusion

- Emphasize the issues that are most pivotal.

- No testing on the states. Time management. Doctrine v. policy.

- Secondary readings -- not tested directly, but you can usefully draw on them.

- Takeaways and memorize table of contents

Standards are crystallized by rules and vise versa---think about "adult-like activity"

+=======================+============================+===============================================================+

- Rules---As a matter of law (directed verdict/SJ/motion to dismiss/JNOV---can argue it's really a standard but we know how it's going to play out)🡪Judge (jury still has a role because they still need to figure out the facts)

- Standards---As a matter of fact/application🡪Jury (fact finder---can be a judge too)

# Nature and Function of Tort Law

A tort is a legally cognizable wrong that is not part of another discrete field of law. There are **accidental** and **intentional** torts which each merits a different standard of care. To make out a tort, you must show **duty**, **breach of duty**, **causation** and **damages**.

- Four important features of tort law include:

  - Jury trials

  - Liability Insurance

  - Contingent Fee System

  - American Rule for Costs

## Hammontree v. Jenner

**Facts:** This is the case of epileptic seizure and subsequent crash into bicycle shop. Plaintiff's lawyers are asking for a change in law from negligence to strict liability. No negligence.

- Distinction between Strict Liability and Negligence

  - Case where it isn't clear that anyone did anything wrong or that there should be a clear-cut decision one way or the other 🡪 Shift from Strict Liability to Negligence

- Considerations: Backward-Looking vs. Forward-Looking

  - Someone has to pay bills 🡪 backward-looking

  - Forward-looking

    - How will people behave differently

    - Effect on litigation behavior

    - Business costs

    - [Strong]{.underline} message of responsibility

## Goals of Tort Law

- **Corrective justice** -- rights based understanding of the functions of tort law. Correction of the wrong to restore moral balance between parties. Focus is on what and why the defendant is obligated to pay the plaintiff.

- **Civil Recourse** -- recourse for civil wrongs, not necessarily corrective. Focus is on what the plaintiff is entitled to receive.

- **Optimal Deterrence** -- some losses are not worth avoiding (those not caused by negligence) and some are worth avoiding (those caused by negligence). Deter excessively risky behavior.

- **Loss Distribution** -- promoting the broad distribution of loss because having a large number of people bear a small loss is better than a single person bearing a large one.

- **Compensation** -- of those who have suffered injury. Since qualifications to recover are not the extent of suffering, this is more of a benefit than imposition of tort liability. Serves the other tort law goals.

- **Redress of social grievances** -- against impersonal institutions.

- **Mixed System** -- Perhaps it depends on the case and both rights-based and instrumental goals can be met.

# Procedure in Tort Suit; Where Tort Law Comes From

- Pleadings -- Complaint states a cause of action and an answer states affirmative defenses.

- Discovery

- Pre-Trial Motions -

  - **Motion to Dismiss** (before discovery) --D claims that even if all P's allegations are true, P does not have a legally cognizable claim.

  - **Motion for Summary Judgment** (after discovery) -- P or D asserts 1) no genuine issue of material fact, 2) motioning party is entitled to judgment based on those facts.

- Trial -- Jury decides issues of fact, judge decides issues of law (except bench trials)

  - **Jury** finds issues of pure fact and mixed questions of fact and law (applying law to facts already found). P bears the **burden of proof** which consists of a **production** (evidence) burden and a **persuasion** (preponderance, more probable than not) burden. If evidence is **equipoise**, burden has not been met.

  - **Judge** rules on admissibility of evidence (nothing irrelevant is admissible). Judges decide whether there is enough evidence to make out a jury question (whether reasonable people could disagree) or whether DV, JML or JNOV should be granted. Also rules on motion and jury instructions.

  - **General Verdicts** are most common and only find for one party and determine damages. **Special Verdicts** answer specific questions. We don't always use special verdicts because tort law is supposed to be less ridged. Juries can also **nullify** the law with their verdicts.

  - **Appeals** are based on trial judge legal error which can only be based on an evidentiary ruling, motion ruling, or jury instruction. Appellate courts can only make findings of law, cannot re-review the facts, and can affirm, reverse or reverse and remand.

# The Negligence Standard

Negligence is defined as the **failure to exercise reasonable** care to avoid injury or damage to another person or property. There is a general duty not to be negligent.

## History of Negligence

- **Trespass** (trespass by force of arms) v. **Case** (trespass by breaching boundary), direct harm (defendant usually liable) v. indirect or consequential harm (defendant only liable through negligence)

- Historically -- you had to choose the correct writ (trespass or case), not just have a cause of action. Writs represented selective justice/jurisdiction of the King. They were a combined substance and procedural tool.

- **Brown v. Kendall** (dogfight) --

  - **Background:** Plaintiff contended that his claim was brought in trespass, so there should be strict liability, i.e. defendant has to prove he exercised extraordinary care (was utterly without fault); Judge Shaw rejected this theory and said that neither trespass nor case would lie unless defendant had intended to injure plaintiff or had negligently injured him.

  - **Holding:** Plaintiff has the burden of proof. Standard to judge defendant is always ordinary or reasonable care. If he acted in reasonable care, he is not liable.

    - [Three moves]{.underline}

      - From extraordinary care to ordinary care (now called reasonable care) that varies with circumstances

      - Burden of proof goes from DF (look extraordinary care) to the PL (lack of ordinary care)

      - The PL needs ordinary care too (or else there is contributory negligence and no liability)

+-----------+------------------+---------------------------------------+
|           |                  | Plaintiff                             |
+-----------+------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
|           |                  | Ordinary Care     | No Ordinary Care  |
+-----------+------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
| Defendant | Ordinary Care    | No Liability to D | No Liability to D |
+-----------+------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
|           | No Ordinary Care | Liability to D    | No Liability to D |
+===========+==================+===================+===================+

- **Adams v. Bullock (Cardozo)**

  - **Facts:** The minor was burned when he swung a long wire over the edge of a bridge striking the wires of a trolley that ran below the bridge and above the train tracks. No one could reach the wires by bending over the bridge or the parapet.

  - **Holding:** The court concluded that only an extraordinary casualty could make the wires dangerous. The court reversed the judgment and held that the railroad did not have the power or duty to avert the possibility of the accident because there was no special danger at the bridge that warned the railroad of the necessity of special precaution, and the wires could not be insulated.

  - Two additional moves:

    - Foreseeable? (Reasonably?)

      - Only "reasonable care---saves costly (further care)

    - Untaken precautions?

      - What could have been done is really expensive

## The Reasonable Person Standard

- Question is not what average people do, but rather what they OUGHT to do.

- Is a mixed question of fact and law

- **Objective Standard** -- not subjective. That the defendant did his best or acted in good faith is not enough. Shortcomings not relevant. There is a difference between moral and legal fault.

  - Subjective standard too variable and hard to find

  - Subjective standard encourages fraud

  - Objective standard encourages D to exercise more care and treats everyone equally

  - Objective standard gives public assurance of predictable care level or liability (affects safety and activity levels)

  - Jurors need not engage in psychology or mind reading

- Arguments in Favor

  - Cost and ease of adjudication and feasibility of fact-finding

    - Clear jury instructions result from this

      - Simple: How would a reasonable person behave?

    - Fair, uniform results

  - Incentives and Deterrence

    - Principle: By setting a standard of care (what a reasonable person would/should do), you incentivize a certain degree of care and skill; also, if a future defendant/tortfeasor knows he/she cannot exercise that minimum threshold of care, he/she will limit his/her activity levels accordingly

  - Fairness

    - Treat everyone equally; everyone benefits

- **Bethel v. New York** (ordinary care)

  - (Re-instates) reasonable person standard for adjudicating public transport/negligence cases

    - One argument

  - Policy Question: How much tailoring of rules do we want? How much do we want to impose as universal?

- **Daniels v. Clegg** and **Little Rock v. Tankersly (**circumstances)

  - Daniels v. Clegg -- head-on carriage collision; woman driver

  - Little Rock v. Tankersly -- woman injured while jumping off of moving train

    - Point here is that you sometimes can sneak circumstances into the analysis

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Clegg                                                                                        Tankersly
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Takes age + sex into account in Plaintiff's favor (lowers expectations for the plaintiff?)   Takes age and sex into account against plaintiff (saying that the plaintiff is incompetent and should have known?)

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- **Wood v. Groh** (extradorinary care \> ordinary care when very dangerous)

  - Holding: parents owed the highest duty to protect the public from the misuse of the gun

- **Emergency doctrine** (honest exercise of judgment \> ordinary care in emergencies)

  - Levey v. DeNardo---emergency doctrine granted because confronted with a sudden and unforeseeable occurrence

  - Biorndal v. Weitman---emergency doctrine not granted because emergency considerations are always included in the reasonable care standard

### Exceptions to the Objective Standard

- **Children under 5 -- no negligence**

  - No negligence at all (saves costs on trials and deterrence won't work for kids)

- **Children between 5 and 17-- semi-objective standard**

  - Looking at them exercising the degree of care that would be reasonable in a child of similar age, judgment, mental capacity

    - Can also look at physical infirmity

    - For expert/superior mental capacity---some exercise qualities of a reasonable person but must also exercise the superior attributes that the person in question himself has

  - EXCEPT, when children engage in dangerous adult activities they are held to an adult standard of care

  - [Goss v. Allen (1976)]{.underline}**---**Goss (π) is an experienced skier who was serving as a first aid advisor at Mad River Glen ski resort in Vermont. Allen (∆) was a 17-year-old beginner who went down the lower slope and crashed into the π.

    - Holding---defendant's attempt to ski on the lower end of the beginners' slope is not a skiing activity that is hazardous to others which would put him in the adult standard of conduct

- **Infirm Adults -- semi-objective standard**

  - Typically [physical infirmities]{.underline} are taken into account in judging the reasonableness of behavior.

    - Considered to be visible, measureable and verifiable.

    - Jury can be permitted to take into account whether the infirmities should have led to different or additional precautions. Evidence of what people with similar infirmities do can be taken.

    - [Roberts v. Ramsbottom (1980)]{.underline}---if the driver having a stroke isn't conscious at all then he isn't liable but if there was still some consciousness he is liable

  - EXCEPT, [mental infirmities]{.underline} aren't taken into account

    - Aren't necessarily visible, measurable, and verifiable (but can be considered under the general emergency doctrine).

    - [Vaughan v. Menlove (1837)]{.underline}---rejection of a subjective or semi-objective standard for mental infirmities

  - Reasons behind this different: human (not fair), policy (incentives/deterrence), and legalistic (ease of proof)

### The Foreseeability Requirement

- Not negligent unless he knew or reasonably should have known that his actions posed a risk of harm. Even then, not negligence unless a reasonable person under the circumstance would have taken more precautions.

- Thus, person cannot be negligent for failing to take precautions against an unforeseeable risk of harm.

### The Negligence "Calculus"

- Learned Hand Formulation: BPL from US v. Carroll Towing Co. (and Section 3 of the Third Restatement of Torts)

  - The **probability** that the harm will happen (P)

  - **Gravity** of the resulting harm (L)

  - **Burden** of adequate precautions (B)

  - Is B greater or less than P times L?

  - It is unreasonable not to take the precautions if they cost less than probability and magnitude of harm. If costs of precautions are higher, it is reasonable to take the risk.

  - BPL not usually used in jury instruction but instead by the court when deciding between jury questions and directed verdict.

<!-- -->

- **US v. Carroll Towing** -- Facts---people on a tug trying to "drill out" another barge in the New York harbor didn't sufficiently secure Anna C and it later broke loose and rammed against a tanker where a propeller broke a hole. Anna C filled with water and later sank.

  - [Holding]{.underline}: "it was a fair requirement that the Conners Company should have a bargee aboard (unless he had some excuse for his absence), during the working hours of daylight. The court reversed and remanded for reconsideration of the allocation of damages."

  - BPL analysis (liability if B \< PL; no liability if B≥PL)---understood to be limited to foreseeable probability and severity

    - Burden: Hand makes being on the boat during daytime seem like a light burden

    - Probability: crowded (cuts both ways); weather; can be how much extra precaution you are avoiding

    - Loss/injury: crowded; cargo (troops in the war with huge stakes)

  - **Gilles reading---**doesn't take into account all of the hidden information costs of getting the data (counter is that the way to get around this is by making estimates and only focusing on optimal behavior)

  - **Bolton v.** **Stone (1951)**---only 6 balls had been driven over the field's fence in 28 years and no one was injured until the plaintiff was hurt

    - Take into account how remote AND how serious the consequences of injury

<!-- -->

- **Eckert v. Long Island RR** (baby on tracks) -- Held that the victim saving the baby didn't bar recover on the basis of contributory negligence. Court found that "the law has so high a regard for human life that it will not impute negligence on an effort to preserve it, unless made under such circumstance as to constitute rashness in the judgment of prudent persons." This is true of rescuing people, not property. **Danger invites rescue**. (Also fits into Act/Omission policy section)

- **Andrews v. United Airlines** -- Falling bags from overhead bins. P claims injury was foreseeable. Common carrier has a heightened duty because P has little control. United took precaution of warning but nothing else. United says further precaution is too costly. Trial court grants Sum. Jug. for D and 9^th^ Cir. remands saying this is appropriate jury question.

- **Which Arguments Don't Fit into B\<PxL?**

  - Future Harm

  - Foreseeability (beyond probability)

  - Custom

  - Morality

  - Quantification? -- Is that something we want?

- **Criticisms of the Calculus:**

  - Incommensurability (comparing apples to oranges; monetize)

    - Jury will hate you for being explicit

  - Sometimes, the cost of preventing an accident is not worth the added burden of prevention (CB, page 45)

  - Doesn't address momentary lapses that amount to negligence (carelessness)

  - Omits whether a party engaged in impartial deliberation about a possible course of action. Perhaps they just made the wrong decision about the calculus.

  - Crass towards real human suffering, boils down to equating suffering with money (awarding damages already does this)

  - Tries to create a uniform unit of comparison. Also, probabilities are often not available for these things.

  - Is it an economic or moral theory of negligence?

    - Posner says economic theory

    - Can also be seen as a moral theory which values self interest equally with the interests of others effected by behavior.

- In many cases the Plaintiff tries to prove the untaken precaution.

### Custom

- Test (Hand ways it's up to the court to determine if there was negligence)

  - If fail: evidence for plaintiff

  - If comply: evidence for the defendant

- Custom used to be a complete defense. Now, except for med. malpractice, custom is admissible but not determinative.

- What is a custom -- Does not need to be universal but must be sufficiently widespread.

- Establishment of a custom gives rise to jury instructions permitting consideration of the compliance or non-compliance. Even if practice is not a full custom, evidence of compliance/non-compliance with a practice in which some engage may also be admitted and considered by jury.

- **TJ Hooper** -- The defendant is an operator of tugboats towing barges that were lost during a storm. The negligence claims stem from the failure to supply the tugs with radios that would have warmed them of the upcoming storm.

  - [Holding]{.underline}: customs "never may set its own tests, however persuasive be its usages. Courts must in the end say what is required" but in most cases whether a whole calling is negligent would be a jury question

- Benefits of custom evidence:

  - Direct normative force -- custom may be probative of what constitutes reasonable care. Jury *permitted* to take reasonable care "ought" from customary "is."

  - Evidence of custom cautions the jury (they might find a whole industry negligent)

  - Evidence of compliance with custom is evidence of a lack of opportunity to learn of other precautions

  - Shows what level of self-protection plaintiff should have taken if they know the custom

  - It is rare for an entire industry to implement more care than is necessary. Therefore departure from custom is more probative than compliance, even though a whole industry can be negligent.

### Malpractice

- Test: the relevant standard is custom (standard of the profession)

  - Majority Rule: comply with customs then you are not liable but if you don't comply then it's malpractice

    - Demise of the locality rule---made it hard for plaintiffs to find an expert both competent and willing to testify

  - Schools of thought---where there are two schools of thought by a considerable number of medical experts the physician can choose which practice to use (Gala v. Hamilton)

- You are taking the issue away from the jury BUT you still need a lot of fact-finding

  - What we have are competing experts (judge/jury still needs to choose which standard when there are two schools of thought)

- Cases

  - Robbins v. Footer (DC Cir 1977)---it has tempered the impact of that rule by permitting the profession as a group to set its own legal standards of reasonable conduct

  - **Sheeley v. Memorial Hospital (RI Supreme Court 1998)**---Dr. Ryder a second year family practice resident performed an episiotomy where the plaintiff developed complications and sued the doctor and the hospital. The plaintiff tried to introduce the expert medical testimony of Dr. Leslie but the trial justice excluded the testimony under the similar locality rule

    - [Holding]{.underline}: Lower court decision overturned and the case is remanded for a new trial because "a physician is under a duty to use the degree of care and skill that is expected of a reasonably competent practitioner in the same class to which he or she belongs, acting in the same or similar circumstances" and the similar locality rule is not longer applicable (111)

      - Addressing two similar locality rule issues: conspiracy of silence and the lack of consideration

### Informed Consent

- Different than malpractice in that it is based on the physician's duty to disclose relent treatment related information and the failure to obtain the patient's informed consent to treatment

  - Physician needs to inform the patient of the risk so that the patient can decide whether to take risk of getting treatment, get alternative treatment, or not get treatment

- [Reasonable patient standard]{.mark}---disclose information that a reasonable patient in the patient's situation would want to know; if doc knows of unusual interests they are responsible for this; ordinary negligence test (not malpractice); puts the patient in control

- [Reasonable physician standard]{.mark}---actionable only as malpractice (failed to comply with standards of the profession); expert testimony is required to not only risks and benefits but also the applicable medical standard; puts the medical profession in control

### Violation of Statutes

- Test

  - If you fail: N per se UNLESS (1) excuse---such as safety?---OR not purpose

    - Legally cognizable excuses---necessity (Tedla), incapacity (children), and emergency (noncompliance is safer---Tedla)

    - Not purpose---plaintiff isn't in the class of people intended to be protected by the statutes that the defendant violated (DiCaprio)

  - If you comply: not necessarily ok---can still be negligence if complying with the statute

- **Martin v. Herzog** -- Contributory negligence: P didn't have headlight on as required by law. Cardozo says statute must be followed; this is contributory negligence per se and enters verdict for D. Did the statutory violations contribute to the accident? Jury question suggesting remand would have been more appropriate.

  - Cardozo: follows rule/statute/precondition and does not submit issues to jury; bends statutes to fit facts

- Negligence per se in the common law -- reasonable people do not violate statutes. But when a statute is codifying the common law, common law exceptions still apply (**Tedla v. Ellman**).

  - **Tedla v. Ellman** (CB, page 79)---necessity

    - "We cannot assume reasonably that the Legislature intended that a statute enacted for the preservation of the life and limb of pedestrians must be observed when observance would subject them to more imminent danger." (79)

    - Plaintiff was struck from behind by traffic while walking with back to traffic, even though statute said you had to walk facing traffic. Plaintiff contended that, due to heavy traffic on opposite side, it would have been more dangerous/risky to walk facing traffic.

- Defense of Limited Statutory Purpose

  - Permits the defendant to show that the plaintiff was not in the class of persons, or did not suffer the type of harm, intended to be protected by the statute that the defendant violated.

  - **DiCaprio v. NY Central RR** -- Fences to keep livestock off the railroad track. Kid was killed but no recovery because protection against this risk was not object of statute.

  - Defense rarely prevails as statutes usually do not have their purpose on their face. Room for courts to find a "secondary purpose"

  - Examples: Dram shop laws -- Some states will extend liability of servers of alcohol to third parties who were injured by drunk drivers. Key in Ignition -- if your car is stolen and then injures someone when you initially left your key in, you can be liable for statutory violation.

  - Two methods of determining liability:

    - Legislative history that mentions anything close to injury/protection suffered by plaintiff

    - If not, then did the statutory violation increase the risk to plaintiff?

  - Other cases on statutory purpose

    - De Haen v. Rockwood Sprinkler Co (Cardozo 1932)---the statute wasn't to protect radiators from calling off ledges and killing people (not the thought or purpose of the legislature)

    - Di Ponzio v. Riordan (NY 1997)---the violation of the ordinance, which was in the city's fire prevention code, was irrelevant because its apparent purpose was to prevent fires and not to avoid injuries from moving vehicles

    - Brown v. Shyne (1926)---the jury shouldn't be told about the defendant's violation of the licensing statute

### BP Case: Gross Negligence

- [Facts]{.underline}---BP conducted a negative pressure test and declared it a success because no fluid was observed flowing from the kill line for thirty minutes and there was no pressure on the kill line. However, 1,400 psi pressure remained on the drill pipe at the time and the negative test should have been declared a failure because something had blocked the line. BP Well Site Leader Done Vidrine told the Transocean drill crew to proceed with displacing the remaining mud in the riser above the BOP with seawater and later there was a blowout.

- [Holding]{.underline}---"the Court finds and concludes that the discharge of oil was the result of BPXP's "gross negligence" and "willful misconduct" under the CWA." (114)

- [Arguments]{.underline}

  - US---gross negligence is just like ordinary negligence except it's worse

  - BP---gross negligence is different so you need to prove a "culpable mental state" (subjective element as an extra thing)

  - At issue because they will pay \$1,100 per barrel for negligence versus four times that amount for gross negligence

  - Court agrees with the US but says BP would lose under either definition

### Warning Defects

- The theory underlying liability for failure to warn is that once you give an adequate warning, the purchaser rather than the product seller is the superior bearer of the risk of the injury (not strict liability)

- **Label clutter issue**---diminishing returned from providing additional information

- The plaintiff needs to prove causation

  - Heeding presumption---plaintiff would have heeded an adequate warning if it had been given

- **Patent danger rule**---there should be no design defect liability once an adequate warning has been given (overruled in many jurisdictions)

- **Hood v. Ryobi America Corp (4th Circuit 1999)**---a manufacturer doesn't have the duty to warn about all of the potential consequences associated with misusing a product but have a duty to provide a warning that is reasonable under the circumstances

  - Hood removed the bladeguard of the saw even seven warnings

  - Holding: the warning that the defendant provided was adequate as a matter of law

- **Cotton v. Buckeye Gas Products**---given short attention spans too many items on the warning end up crowding out and they get lost in the fine print

- **Stengel v. Modtrongic Inc (9th Circuit 2013)**---P suing under state tort law for injuries caused by a medical device manufactured by the D even there is a federal law

  - Issue: can a federal statute trump state tort law?

    - Express provision can say what's being preempted

    - Implied preemption---Congress have take all of the regulation for itself

  - Court rules here that it's parallel and if you add in damages it's fine (the behavior is what's important)

    - [Federal preemption]{.underline}

      - Express

      - Implied

        - Field---Congress has taken all of the regulation for itself

        - Conflict

## Negligence as a Matter of Law: Judges and Jury

- Juries -- Issues are submitted to jury if reasonable people [could]{.underline} disagree about the resolution of that issue.

- Court -- issues are decided by the court as a matter of law if reasonable people [could not]{.underline} disagree

  - Duty and no-duty questions are usually handled by the Court as a matter of law

  - Also pure questions of fact and mixed questions of fact and law (whether a party was negligent)

- Holmes -- **Baltimore and Ohio RR v. Goodman** (CB, p. 63) -- Truck crossing RR where the plaintiff was hit by train. SCOTUS overturned ruling for P (was negligent) saying that there was no evidence to relieve P of responsibility for his own death. Someone in this situation should stop and get out of his vehicle.

  - Rule: Get out of the car, look, then cross (stop and look rule via directed verdict)

  - Holmes worried that a general standard would lead to inconsistency in jury application (Note 2, p. 61)

  - Also wants to give people clear guidance to avoid having juries oscillating to and fro

- Cardozo -- **Pokora v. Wabash RR** -- SCOTUS overturned ruling for D (based on Goodman) in another railroad crossing accident, saying that each case depends on the facts. Goodman may have been negligent, but that doesn't mean everyone in the same situation is.

  - Reasonable caution standard: reasonable to expect you'd hear a train coming; lower standard of care

  - Tries pulling Holmes's rule back into general standard of conduct

  - Criticizes Holmes: judges don't know everything and can't make a rule, since situations vary too much (CB, p. 63)---the stop and look rule is very dangerous

- Holmes v. Cardozo (Goodman/Pokera): Holmes says common law draws on experience but that doesn't mean it should be unsettled. He thinks that for some subset of cases can't we create standards because they happen over and over. Cardozo says RR crossing accident has so many variables that you need a jury.

  - Who decides?

    - Rules: made by legislatures (statutes), agencies (regulations), and judges (precedent)

    - Standards: made by judges/juries based on a specific case

- Generally there has not been a tendency for rules of law to develop regarding what is and is not negligent behavior. This is usually a decision for the jury.

- Rules v. Standards

- **Andrews v. United Airlines** (whether the defendant had breached its duty to maintain safe overhead bins on its airplanes is held as a question for the jury)-- perhaps appropriate for a rule-based decision since this accident occurs in basically the same way over and over. But courts have allowed this type of development through procedural moves, like class action and collateral estoppel.

# Proof of Negligence

Plaintiff introduces evidence of Ds behavior and contents that they failed to take a precaution that would have been reasonable to take. Use of **direct evidence** (physical, demonstrative, eyewitness), **circumstantial** or **res ipsa** evidence.

## Burden of Proof

- Burdens in the Ordinary Case

  - Plaintiff in a torts suit bears the burden of proof on each element of the case, including the burden of production and the burden of persuasion.

  - Satisfying the burden of **production** is sometimes referred to as making out a **prima facie** case. This is an evidence burden where P can support an inference of breach of standard by the jury. (Negligence **per se** is the same as prima facie. Some courts say that per se means the case is closed while prima facie means defendant could still give some defense)

  - Satisfaction of burden of **production** is determined by the court in a ruling on legal sufficiency of the evidence on all elements. If reasonable people could disagree on all elements, then D directed verdict motion is denied. Jury then determines the "weight" of the evidence.

    - Inference of negligence must be permissible based on evidence.

  - Burden of **persuasion** -- met only if jury is persuaded by a preponderance of the evidence (more probably than not) that the D breached the applicable standard of care, injury resulted and D's breach caused the injury. If evidence shows that it is just as probable as not (in **equipoise**), then burden is not satisfied.

- Product of the probabilities problem -- 1) mathematically complex, 2) jury unanimity, 3) defendant incentives, 4) comparative persuasion.

- **Proving negligence** -- 1) what defendant did, 2) what they did or did not do constituted lack of reasonable care, 3) (optional but recommended) what would have constituted reasonable care?

- Circumstantial Evidence of Negligence --

  - Sometimes proof of the circumstances is sufficient to prove negligence, but sometimes it is not.

  - Some cases draw on court and jury's past experience. Some are sufficiently technical to need experts to create a common understanding of past experiences regarding the issues in the case.

## Res Ipsa Loquitur

- Circumstantial evidence that the defendant was negligent in some way, without supporting an inference of the particular way in which the defendant was negligent. Res Ipsa means that because Ds who do this are ordinarily negligent, there is sufficient circumstantial evidence to allow this to go to the jury. Generally shifts burden of proof to D.

- Event causing the Plaintiff's injury must be one that: (parts 2 and 3 are part of the traditional approach)

  - Ordinarily occurs because of negligence by someone in the defendant's position

  - Instrumentality causing injury must be in the exclusive control of the defendant

  - The injury must not be due to any voluntary action or contribution by the plaintiff

- **Modern view**: requiring that causes other than the defendant's negligence (the defendant's non-negligent conduct, the negligent conduct of someone else, and the non-negligent conduct of someone else or some thing) be sufficiently eliminated by evidence.

- Applications: when requirements are met, the effect is that the jury is permitted, though not required, to find that the defendant was negligent. Because of discovery rules, now, this is only useful if D lies in deposition but is willing to tell the truth at trial.

- **Byrne v. Boadle** -- Barrel of flour that fell from a warehouse. Mere fact that the accident occurred is evidence of negligence and satisfies P's burden of production. Court essentially shifts burden of proof to defendant since plaintiff has no access to proof and D has a duty to care for barrels. D provides no affirmative evidence against negligence so court upholds CofA finding for P.

- Smoking Out the Evidence from the Defendant: Essentially res ipsa shifts the burden of proof to the defendant to submit something to prove that they were not negligent.

- **The Ybarra Problem** -- Case of shoulder pain after surgery. Res Ipsa may still serve to smoke out evidence regarding multiple defendants. Res Ipsa caused burden of proof to shift to doctors and nurses who had unique ability to identify the negligence when patient, who was unconscious, cannot. "Hold that where a P receives unusual injuries while unconscious and in the course of medical treatment, all those Ds who had any control over the body or instrumentalities . . . may be properly be called upon to meet the inference of negligence by giving an explanation of their conduct." Finding of nonsuit reversed. *Only used in conspiracy of silence cases.*

# Cause-In-Fact

In the absence of tortious conduct, no injury. 1) what caused the harm, 2) who caused the harm, 3) whether negligence caused the harm, and 4) what part of the harm was caused by what or whom.

## Types of Causation

- **Causal link** -- what happens as a matter of probability for these cases? Perhaps other possible reason for event.

- **But for cause** (cause in fact) -- in this case, what exactly happened

- **Proximate cause** -- see below.

+----------------------------------+-------------------------+---------------+----------------------+
| **Types**                        | **Issues of proof**     | **Harm/\$**   | **Allocation of \$** |
+----------------------------------+-------------------------+---------------+----------------------+
| "But for" (necessary)            | - Preponderance         | - Lost chance | - Joint/several      |

| - Multiple necessary conditions  | - Alternative liability |               | - Several            |
|                                  |                         |               |                      |
| - Multiple sufficient conditions | - Market share          |               | - Market share       |
|                                  |                         |               |                      |
| - Joint (concert/individual)     |                         |               |                      |
+==================================+=========================+===============+======================+

## The "But For" Test 

- (**sine qua non**) -- but for the defendant's negligence (or breach of applicable standard of care) the plaintiff would have suffered injury or damage.

- Cause-in-fact also requires negligence (i.e. parents having a child, who commits a tort, are not liable even though that is a but-for cause).

  - Defendant is not liable unless negligence was also **proximate cause**.

- **[Test]{.underline}**: Causation question is **counter-factual** -- does not require a finding of what actually happened, but of what would have happened if the defendant had not been negligent. Jury must rely on experience and knowledge of the world to determine this.

  - Question of Proof: Can you preclude other possible causes?

- In cause in fact disputes court must decide whether an inference about what would have happened in this situation if the defendant had not been negligent is permissible, because of what ordinarily happens in situations like this when there is no negligence.

- **But for test** -- requires a finding that, more probable than not, the defendant's negligence was a prerequisite to what happened

  - **[Substantial factor test]{.underline}** -- alternative to the "but for" test that requires a finding that the defendant's negligence was influential in some way. (too vague except in cases of multiple causes).

- **Aegis Insurance v. 7 World Trade Center (2nd Circuit 2012)**

  - [Facts]{.underline}: NYCFD decided to establish a collapse zone around the 7WTC and walk away rather than fight the fire. The building collapsed and destroyed the electrical substation owned by ConEd directly underneath the building and the latter sued the defendants.

  - [Holding]{.underline}: Court goes through but for cause test to hold that the alleged negligence wasn't the cause in fact of the collapse of 7WTC because the confluence of events shows that the building would have collapsed regardless of any negligence from the defendants

- **[Informed consent]{.underline}**: plaintiff must show that the would have declined treatment if he had been given the required information (some courts require that he show that the treatment he would have a treatment causing less injury)

  - [Fully objective standard]{.underline}: no consideration of the plaintiff's idiosyncrasies and particular preferences

  - [Semi-objective standard]{.underline}: takes the plaintiff's testimony of his idiosyncrasies and preferences as one piece of evidence (but question is still what a reasonable person in the plaintiff's position would have done)

- **Cuyler v. US (last paragraph---causation part)**: Issue of "causation tend to be more difficult in a case of nonfeasance, which is what good Samaritan liability is, than in one of misfeasance"; need to prove that reporting to DCFS would have mattered

- **Stengel v. Medtronic (concurrence)**: claim is that Medtronic breached its duty of reasonable care under Arizona negligence law by failing to report adverse events to the FDA but the plaintiffs need to prove that if the defendant had properly reported the adverse events to the FDA under the federal law then the information would have reached the plaintiff's doctors in time to prevent his injuries

- [Expert Testimony:]{.underline}

  - **Daubert v. Merrell Dow** -- court specified the standards that the trial courts should employ to exercise their gatekeeping role in ruling on admissibility of scientific expert testimony (and later non-scientific experts). Directed trial courts to make a preliminary assessment of reliability and applicability of the testimony.

  - Trial court assesses reliability of expert while jury assesses persuasiveness.

## Multiple Causes, Indeterminate Causes, and Exceptions to the Conventional Test

### Theories Underlying the Causation Requirement

- If there is an injured plaintiff and negligent defendant, why do we need causation?

<!-- -->

- Justice between the Parties

  - If defendant did not cause the loss, then it seems obvious that there is no liability.

  - But if plaintiff has proved that defendant negligently risked harm to her, isn't that enough since defendant has wronged her?

  - Aren't defendants who do not hurt anyone just as blameworthy, but also lucky? Not practical to dispense with causation requirement.

  - **[Moral Luck]{.underline}**: A defendant who is negligent, but does not harm a plaintiff is not held liable for his negligence

- Causation and Deterrence

  - Instrumental view -- deter unreasonable behavior. Give an incentive to compare the amount of liability that they anticipate from taking a risk with the cost of reducing that risk by taking precautions.

  - Requiring causation communicates expectation in advance. Creating optimal deterrence.

### Injury Caused by Multiple Necessary Causes

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
                          **ON**                  **OFF**
  ----------------------- ----------------------- -----------------------
  **ON**                  X                       X

  **OFF**                 X                       Harm
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Lights🡪both cars are but for causes

- Only way to avoid the accident is to have the lights on

### Injury Caused by Multiple Sufficient Causes

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          **ON**                  **OFF**
  ----------------------- ----------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **ON**                  X                       H (but for causation)

  **OFF**                 H (but for causation)   H (multiple sufficient causes; tort 3rd restatement; plugging in there but for causation is underinclusive)
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Multiple necessary conditions---need negligence of both parties; Multiple sufficient conditions---either party's negligence is enough for the harm

- Practical Reasons for MSC:

  a.  Can't calculate risk for each party

  b.  If we punish every risk created, life would be dull.

- Definition of MSC: not acting in concert but they could individually be a sufficient cause for the accident

  a.  Example: 2 cars, no headlights, collision

- Not "but for" causation; non-tortious (could have used extreme care and just had bad luck)

- [Restatement 3d]{.underline}

  a.  §26 Factual Cause: must be a factual cause (harm wouldn't have occurred absent the conduct)

  b.  §27 MSC: If two acts occur that could have been the factual cause of the harm if occurred alone then each is a factual cause of the harm

  c.  Versus 2nd Restatement: substantial factor test when there are two forces where one is because of an actors N and the other isn't b/c of any N and each is sufficient for the harm

- MSC

  a.  Two Simultaneous Causes: **Both Negligent** -- two fires negligently started converge at the same time. Neither can avoid liability even though each fire individually is not the but-for cause. Each was a substantial factor. [Law threatens too much liability over too little.]{.underline}

  b.  Two Simultaneous Causes: **One Negligent, One Not** -- One fire is negligently caused. Negligent fire is cause of some damage, but damage would have happened anyway from non-negligent fire. [Many courts do not hold the N defendant liable in this situation but some do.]{.underline}

  c.  Sequential Causes: **Pre-emptive Causation** -- two fires arrive sequentially. First destroys the house and then second arrives (and would have destroyed house). [First fire was "pre-emptive" cause and party causing first fire is liable if fire negligently set. Second fire is not responsible even if set negligently.]{.underline}

### Joint and Several Liability

- When two or more defendants are liable to the plaintiff for the same harm

  - All joint tortfeasors have to have all made a necessary contribution to the harm

  - Harm wouldn't have happened but for combined negligence of tortfeasors

- Each is liable as if he were the sole wrongdoer, responsible for the entirety of the plaintiff's damages. P can recover from either, but cannot recover more than the total damages awarded.

- [Old way]{.underline} of allocating money---C is responsible for all of the damages but can collect from the other defendants (bears the risk if one of them is insolvent)

  - Common law allowed a windfall for the defendant who didn't pay but states have remedied that with statutes that create rights of contribution among jointly and severally liable tortfeasors, meaning one defendant can be reimbursed by the other if they pay more than their share of the award.

  - This rule places risk of defendant insolvency on other defendants instead of plaintiff.

- [Newer way]{.underline} of allocating money--- includes pure comparative negligence where A (plaintiff is assigned a number (his N) and the defendants are also in accordance to how much they contributed

  - Many states now assess contribution shares of co-defendants in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to each co-defendant (like comparative negligence).

- **Joint tortfeasors** -- joint enterprise and one is negligent

- **Independent tortfeasors** -- single, theoretically indivisible harm

- **Independent tortfeasors** -- single, theoretically divisible but practically indivisible harm. Evidence does not show how much harm was caused by whom, although it is obvious that they are not equal.

- **[Several liability (BP case)]{.underline}**---there is no contribution and the plaintiff has to sue each one (collect independently where the plaintiff bears the risk)

- **Hymowitz** (CB, page 372) -- can joint/several liability apply here?

### Indeterminate Causes

- Plaintiff clearly injured by tortious conduct but cannot determine which of several defendants was more probably than not the cause of injury.

- **Alternative Liability**: **Summers v. Tice (ISSUE OF PROOF) -** Two different hunters negligently shot in the direction of plaintiff. One shot created great injury. Each defendant was as probably as not the but-for cause.

  - Court held that under these circumstances, the burden of proof shifted to the defendants to prove if they did not cause the harm. "Alternative liability" imposing liability on negligent defendants, each of whom is equally likely to have harmed the plaintiff. Some kind of connection amongst the defendants seems necessary with alternative liability. Also, in this case, plaintiff did not argue joint liability because he was part of the same hunting trip (Contributory negligence)

  - Distinguish from MSC

    - Only 1 of the defendants did it and the other didn't (should be free of liability)

  - Holding both people liable though we know one is not, since we can't tell which one is not liable.

    - Reasoning:

      - Plaintiff can't prove which one and doesn't have the means or knowledge to do so; shifting the burden of proof to defendant

      - Don't want to exonerate both from liability just because one got lucky and didn't harm the plaintiff (they were both equally negligent, remember?)

  - Applying Alternative Liability to [Hymowitz v. Eli Lily & Co. (CB, p. 372)]{.underline}

    - DES manufacturers would be in no better position to know about causation; shifting burden to them wouldn't work to resolve the issue

    - Many companies were not around anymore so couldn't shift burden to them

    - A lot has to do with damages and compensation (Hymowitz dissent)

- **Loss of Chance to Survive (harm/\$)**

  - Already injured or ill plaintiff, whose chances of recovery or survival are reduced by the negligent actions of the defendant.

  - **Herskovits v. Group Health Cooperative** -- Doc failed to diagnose cancer until plaintiff's chance of survival was only 25%. Even without malpractice, chances would only have been 39%. Court held that there could be recovery, though not for all damage resulting from plaintiff's death. (This was a hypo in class)

    - Possible explanation -- defendant was held liable for the loss of the opportunity to survive. Defendant was the but-for cause of the loss or reduction in chances. Only for medical cases because of duty to prolong survival.

    - Concurrence---the defendant is 100% responsible for the 14% reduction

  - **Matsuyama v. Birnbaum** (890 N.E. 2d 819)---Matsuyama sought care for gastric pain since 1988 but the doctor didn't order any tests at first and after he finally did he didn't order further tests to see if the patient had gastric cancer until it was too late

    - Case based on loss of chance (redefine the injury)

    - Special jury had decided, at trial, that, at time of negligence, there were 37.5% chances of survival; so, they gave damages for 37.5% of \$875,000 plus \$160k to estate for pain and suffering

    - Court's decision

      - [Limits "lost chance" calculation to medical negligence cases]{.underline}

        - Health care provides can maximize chances of survival; deterrence when treating patients; availability of valid data

    - Issues---How/Why is this incomplete?

      - Missing the people that ultimately lives but were subject to the same exact harm (risk creation)---might be the next frontier

- **Market-Share Liability**

  - **Sindell v. Abbott Labs** (DES case) --Problem was that no individual plaintiff could identify which individual defendant caused the harm. Court circumvented the problem by holding that each plaintiff could recover from each defendant a portion of her damages equal to the defendant's share of the market for DES.

  - Theory behind Sindell -- It is clear that each defendant injured some plaintiffs, they should not escape liability because plaintiffs can't show which caused the injury.

  - Important -- DES made by all defendants was identical and harm could only be caused by DES. Therefore market share liability was an accurate surrogate

  - Issues

    - Very few signature diseases (only 1 cause); not always chemically identical; relevant market share data not always available; not always feasible to sue all of the defendants (see below for approaches)

  - **Relative-market share** -- take available defendants and make them 100% of the market. Imposes excessive liability but provides complete recovery for plaintiffs

  - **Absolute-market share** -- only hold defendant liable for the actual percentage of the market, giving plaintiff less than complete recovery.

  - **Hymowitz v. Eli Lily & Co.**---selling DEC for use by pregnant women to prevent miscarriages but the female children of the mothers began to develop vaginal cancer and other complications many years later.

# The Scope of Liability: Proximate Cause

**Proximate Cause** -- liability is not imposed unless negligence is both cause in fact and proximate cause of injury.

- Trying to exclude some people from being liable for torts from causation in fact

- Evolution

  - Really old: direct/natural connection (NJ jury instruction)

  - Traditional: foreseeability

  - Modern (3rd Restatement): harm within the risks (almost pure policy argumentation)

## The Basics

Most issues of proximate cause can be resolved using a foreseeability test or by the harm-within-the-risk test. (ALSO APPLIES TO STRICT LIABILITY)

- **Foreseeability (Forward looking)**

  - Causing harm that was a foreseeable result of acting as the defendant did

  - Two step analysis

    - Whether the defendant was negligent at all

    - Whether the harm to the particular plaintiff or class was a foreseeable result of the defendant's negligence

- **The Harm-Within-The-Risk-Test**

  - In some "freak" cases, people would agree that as a matter of law, defendant's negligence was not a proximate cause of plaintiff's injury because injury was not a harm-within-the-risk that made the defendant's act negligent.

  - [The question]{.underline}: Is the risk of the injury suffered one of the risks that makes the defendant negligent for blocking access to the fire hydrant?

    - If the negligent act did not foreseeably increase risk of harm. What happened was not foreseeable.

  - **Third Restatement §29 Limitations on Liability for Tortious Conduct**

    - "An actor's liability is limited to those harms that result from the risks that made the actor's conduct tortious"

    <!-- -->

    - Comment D: need to consider (a) the risks that made the actor's conduct tortious and (b) whether the harm for which recovery is sough was a result of any of those risks

  <!-- -->

  - **Third Restatement §36**

    - "When an actor's negligent conduct constitutes only a trivial contribution to a causal set that is a factual cause of harm under § 27, the harm is not within the scope of the actor's liability."

      - No liability if the act didn't increase the chance of it happening but if it increased the harm within the risk then there could be liability

  - **NY Jury Instructions 6.10**---"The basic question for you to resolve is whether *\[name of plaintiff or other party\]*'s injury/loss/harm is so connected with the negligent actions or inactions of *\[name of defendant or other party\]*"

  <!-- -->

  - **Berry v. Borough of Sugar Notch** -- Berry (plaintiff and motorman) was driving his car at a rate of over 8 miles an hour in violation of the speed limit ordinance. A large chestnut tree fell on top of the car during a violent windstorm injuring him and he sued for damages.

    - No proximate cause because it was simply coincidence that the trolley was where it was when the tree fell, even though the trolley wouldn't have been at that precise point had it not been speeding.

  - **Gorris v. Scott** -- Sheep washed overboard because of failure to follow statutory requirement to have pens. But that regulation was to reduce risk of disease, so no proximate cause.

    - Scope of liability for negligence did not extend to these harms.

  - Trickier cases where harm was foreseeable but was not the principle risk (secondary risk):

    - **Wagner v. International RR** (Cardozo)-- Negligent in failing to close a train door, causing cousin to be thrown out. Plaintiff went to his rescue and was also injured. Principle risk of negligence was cousin falling out, but plaintiff's injury was also foreseeable. How much scope should you give the jury? Cardozo "**danger invites rescue**" so defendant's negligence makes plaintiff's injury foreseeable.

## Advanced Issues 

### Remoteness in Time or Space, and Directness

- Was the harm too remote in time and space? Or in directness?

- **Directness test** -- (backward looking) did the negligence cause harm to the plaintiff directly? In order to satisfy this test, usually it must also be close in time and space.

- Courts sometimes talk about a chain of causation, or a sequence of events set off by defendant's negligence.

- Usually, these tests have been integrated into the foreseeability test. They are not determinative, but are considerations.

### Intervention and Enablement

- Subsequent acts of third parties or other forces are the immediate cause of harm, but the original negligence is also a cause in fact of that harm.

- Is the first actor relieved of liability because of the subsequent acts of the second actor?

- Early courts followed **last-wrongdoer rule**.

- Sometimes this issue hinges on whether there was a duty between first actor and plaintiff. (bartender and person injured by drunk driver)

- Typically cases in which first actor enabled but did not cause harm through the second actor. Liability turns on the foreseeability of the subsequent wrongdoing or harm.

- **Intervening cause** -- when foreseeability of injury is one of the risks that is taken into account in deciding whether defendant's actions were negligent.

  - [NJ Jury Instructions 6.14]{.underline}: the act of an independent agency that destroys the causal connection and must be the immediate and sole cause of the accident/incident/event or injury/loss/harm.

- **Superseding cause** -- risk of injury is so unforeseeable that it is not a factor to be taken into account at all in deciding whether defendant's actions were negligent.

  - [NJ Jury Instructions 6.14]{.underline}: intervening cause must be one that so completely supersedes the operation of the defendant's negligence that you find that the intervening event caused harm without harm without the defendant contributing to it in any material way

- Sometimes subsequent intentional or criminal conduct breaks the chain between first actor and plaintiff. (Exception: leaving keys in car, car stolen, plaintiff injured by negligent thief)

- Even non-negligent actions by third parties may not break the chain. But also, in the car thief example, if the thief was using reasonable care when driving and still injured the plaintiff, there might not be enough connection with the first part.

- **Unforeseeable Plaintiffs** - **Palsgraf v. LIR** (Cardozo)-- RR employee helping passenger on moving train, knocks package on track, package has fireworks and explodes, causing Mrs. Palsgraf's injury.

  - [Issue]{.underline}: Was injury to Mrs. P, down the track foreseeable when helping a passenger onto the train, even if done so negligently?

  - [Holding]{.underline}: The case could not go to jury as a matter of law because, although RR had duty of reasonable care towards Mrs. P, RR didn't breach that duty because harm to her was not a foreseeable risk of defendant's conduct.

    - **Cardozo** -- the guard doesn't have a duty to the plaintiff (only to the person being pushed) because unforeseeable plaintiff is outside the zone of danger (duty and is a court of law question)

    - **Andrews Dissent** -- There is a duty to the world, not just relational duties (proximate cause and is a fact/jury question)

      - Natural and continuous sequence

      - Not too many intervening causes

      - Is negligence likely to create that effect

      - Foreseeable post negligence

      - Not too remote time and place

    - Who won?

      - Proximate cause was established (Andrews) but what defines the orbit of danger is foreseeability like what we have now with foreseeable increase in risk (Cardozo)

- Restatement, Section 29

  - Definition of Negligence here as applied to Palsgraf

  - What makes risks tortious?

    - When a risk taken makes an act tortious (Negligent), then it counts.

      - E.g. give a gun to a child and she hurts herself by dropping it on her toe vs. give a gun to a child and she hurts herself or others by shooting it

      - Risk of giving gun = shooting it, not dropping it.

  - Restatement ties proximate cause to negligence

    - Where does foreseeability fit in?

    - 2-step test:

      - What is the Negligent risk "zone"?

      - Was what actually happened within foreseeable (negligent) risk?

- \*BP Oil Spill Story\*

- **Unforeseeable Extent of Harm** --

<!-- -->

- **Thin-skull rule** -- virtually universal -- foreseeable plaintiffs who suffer an unforeseeable extent of harm. No defense that plaintiff had an unforeseeable weakness that made extent of harm so great. "**Take the victim as you find them**."

- Thin skull rule avoids litigation complications of proving normal injury level and imposes a desirable level of strict liability for level of harm caused by negligence as defendants can foresee thin-skulled plaintiffs.

- Exceptions to thin-skull rule are in cases where it makes more sense for plaintiff to bear the risk of injury (plaintiff's negligence or plaintiff who does not mitigate damages)

<!-- -->

- **Unforeseeable Type of Harm**

  - Uncertain outcomes in these cases. (explosives fall on foot but do not explode example).

  - **In re Polemis** -- Plank fell into the ship hold, caused a spark, which lit the petrol, and started a fire. Negligence caused plank to fall but fire could not reasonably been foreseen as a result of this negligence, although some damage was foreseen. Court held that defendant's negligence was proximate cause of harm since it was a direct consequence of the negligence.

  - **Wagon Mound** (overrules Polemis) -- Oil spill in harbor, causes fire two days later which damages plaintiff's dock and second plaintiff's ships on the dock. It was foreseeable that the oil would cause damage but not fire. 1^st^ plaintiff didn't argue that fire was foreseeable presumably because that would imply it was also foreseeable to plaintiff (contributory negligence wasn't in the common law yet). 2^nd^ plaintiff did argue it and won, probably because they were not on the scene.

    - [Rule]{.underline}: Unforeseeable type of harm, even if caused directly by defendant's negligence is not proximate cause, while unforeseeable extent of harm is.

- **Unforeseeable Manner of Harm**

  - Foreseeable plaintiff and injury, but injury occurs in a bizarre manner.

  - **Marshall v. Nugent** -- Plaintiff run off the road by defendant. Then goes to warn oncoming cars and gets hit. This did not preclude liability for the first actor, defendant. The fact that the foreseeable harm occurred in an unforeseeable manner is still proximate cause. Mcgruder says this is a case for the jury. Facts plus foreseeability matter a lot. Unforeseeable type of harm or unforeseeable details of the manner of harm?

## Judge, Jury, and the Underlying Purpose of Proximate Cause

- Judge and Jury

  - **Proximate cause as a matter of law** -- most cases this is obvious either there was or was not proximate cause and the judge decides.

  - Exceptional cases from this section show that the jury decides whether there is proximate cause if it is not obvious (reasonable people could disagree).

<!-- -->

- The Underlying Purpose of Proximate Cause

  - Proximate cause is a liability limiting doctrine.

  - Negligent defendants should not always bear liability to all the people or for all the harm they have caused. Enough is enough.

- [Restatement Third: comments e, f, g]{.underline}

  - Why have a scope of harm

    - Relative simplicity

    - Fairness and proportionality

    - Sufficient flexibility for fairness concerns

## Proximate Cause, or Scope of Liability -- Application/Cheapest Cost Avoider

- Davis v. US (1st Circuit 2012)\--Davis and Hussey were murdered by Flemmi Bulger who were FBI informants who were involved in various serious crimes. The plaintiff argues that the FBI caused the women's deaths through their flagrant negligence in utilizing Flemmi and Bulger as informants and not controlling them.

  - Court finds that the government knew the risk of letting murders stay out of jail and are thus liable

  - It is foreseeable that they might kill anyone who threatened or seriously inconvenienced them because these are killers at large

- **Calabresi's "Concerning Cause and the Law of Torts**

  - Gives content to the harm within the risk test by appealing to the market deterrence aim in tort law

+=======================================+=================================================================+===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================+

- **Causation is key!**

<!-- -->

- Defendant must prove that plaintiff's conduct was negligent or consisted of assumption of risk, that such conduct was a cause in fact of the plaintiff's injury, and that such conduct was a proximate cause of this injury.

- Both parties must prove what amounts to a full tort against each other but defendant has to prove that plaintiff breached a **duty to himself or herself.**

- **Contributory negligence** -- failure of the plaintiff to exercise reasonable care to protect himself or his property from the risk of harm or loss.

- Law and economics is not as concerned about contributory negligence as the moral approach because we already have an incentive to preserve ourselves, do not need a legal incentive.

- Aggregate social welfare -- person in best position to implement due care/precaution should do so. Sometimes that is the P not the D.

- Until about 1970 in the US, contributory negligence was a complete bar to recovery, regardless of the level of negligence.

- Contributory negligence is not fair nor does it create good incentives.

- **The Safety Statute Exception** - When defendant's negligence consisted of breach of a statute designed specifically to protect a class of persons unable to protect themselves, the contributory negligence of a member of the protected class does not bar recovery. Trying to cure harshness of contributory negligence rule.

- **The Greater-Degree-of-Blame Exception** -- Not a defense to an intentional tort because defendant is much more blameworthy. Same for willful or wanton torts that are not intentional but defendant acted in a way that is blameworthy. But if the plaintiff was also willfully or wantonly negligent, this cancelled out the defendant's blameworthy behavior.

- **Last Clear Chance**

  - If the negligence defendant had the last clear chance to avoid harming the plaintiff, then the plaintiff's contributory negligence was not a bar to recovery.

  - When the defendant had a chance that was both last and clear, it may be more blameworthy than ordinary negligence, even if plaintiff's negligence was present.

  - Clear chance is **open and obvious**. Last chance means at that point **plaintiff cannot remove himself** from harms way and defendant knows this OR has reason to know.

  - Isn't this just a comparison of fault, giving more weight to the defendant's fault if they had a last clear chance to avoid it? LCC will not survive into comparative neg. regime.

- Jury Question/General Verdict Approach -- Practice of submitting contributory negligence cases to the jury contributed to the demise of the regime. Jury applied "under the table" comparative negligence returning "quotient" verdicts in which they reduced plaintiff's recovery through a comparison of faults.

## Comparative Negligence

- All states except AL, MD, NC, VA and DC have some form of comparative negligence.

<!-- -->

- The Basics -- **Comparative negligence does not bar recovery**. Recovery is reduced in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to plaintiff.

  - **Pure v. Modified Comparative Negligence**

    - **Pure** form -- Plaintiff's negligence is never a complete bar from recovery. Comparative negligence applies even if the Plaintiff is more negligent than the defendant because the amount recovered is in proportion to the plaintiff's fault (most common)

    - **Modified** -- the plaintiff recovers until he or she is determined to be at least 50% at fault (not as common)

  - The Basis for Comparison - Negligence not causation is what is measured. Someone can be minimally negligent but cause a lot of harm. The difficult decision regarding comparison is a job for the jury; there is not much law to guide it

  - Assessment -- Hard to tell different incentives that comparative v. contributory negligence regimes create. Comparative creates a greater sense of justice.

<!-- -->

- Applications

  - **Multiple Defendants** -- How to handle when plaintiff is more responsible than either defendant, but not both combined? Seems to sway towards no recovery in a modified comparative system because plaintiff is the actor with the most responsibility.

  - **Joint and Several Liability** -- if two defendants are responsible for different amounts of negligence, can one be responsible for both parts in the case of insolvency?

    - Hold defendants jointly and severally liable for the amount of the judgment (this has less appeal if defendants are just concurrent defendants, as opposed to joint tortfeasors)

    - Hold each defendant liable for only his or her own proportional share of the reduced judgment. If one is not able to pay, the loss rests with the plaintiff.

    - Plaintiff and solvent defendant are proportionally responsible for the insolvent defendant's share.

    - If plaintiff is even minutely contributorily negligent, then plaintiff gets nothing. If plaintive is comparatively negligent, only gets portion that was not caused by plaintiff.

  - **Effect on Other Common Law Doctrines** -- Comparative negligence statutes and cases do not outline effect on other doctrines such as last clear chance, assumption of risk or greater-degree-of-blame exceptions to contributory negligence

    - Last clear chance -- most courts have ruled that this is no longer dispositive and these cases should follow the comparative negligence scheme. Jury can take the last clear chance into account when dividing negligence.

    - Greater-degree-of-blame -- largely unnecessary once jury is already dividing degree of negligence. But some courts have said that plaintiff's negligence is no defense to an intentional or similar tort but same-degree-of-blame can be a defense in these same torts.

    - Assumption of risk still completely bars recovery when plaintiff knowingly assumes the risk that defendant will injure. Usually this only works if plaintiff's assumption was unreasonable and therefore negligent, which the jury when dividing negligence can take into account.

  - **Strict Liability** -- contributory negligence is only a defense against strict liability in some jurisdictions. Easiest to apply comparative negligence whenever contributory negligence used to apply but some still bar recovery based on plaintiff negligence in strict liability cases. Some say plaintiff's behavior is irrelevant

  - **Setoffs** -- If defendant counterclaims and both are given a judgment, so the party owing more just pay the difference or should both parties be required to pay out the whole amount? Seems to be that when insurance is involved, both insurers must pay the entire amount to the opposing party.

<!-- -->

- **Li v. Yellow Cab Co. of CA** -- P was driving northbound and making a left when the D was driving southbound in an unsafe manner at 30 miles per hour on a yellow light. The jury determined that P as contributory negligent and barred recovery.

<!-- -->

- [Holding]{.underline}: contributory negligence should be scrapped in favor of comparative negligence which assesses liability in direct proportion to fault (pure comparative negligence)

  - Comparative negligence is preferable to all-or-nothing because of logic, experience and justice

  - This doesn't violate the statute which codifies all-or-nothing

  - Practical difficulties should not dissuade the court

  - Reality is that juries already do this

  - Also -- flavor of superceding cause in "Last Clear Chance" exception to contributory N

<!-- -->

- Comparative Negligence via Statute -- many state legislatures dictate what type of comparative negligence (pure or modified) to use in court.

## Assumption of Risk 

- **Express Assumption of Risk** -- Individual contractually agrees in advance to waive his or her right to bring a tort action against a potential injurer. These agreements are often valid when entered knowingly, voluntarily, and with appreciation of significance. Type of service and bargaining power are also important.

- **No Duty of Care Breached by Defendant** -- **Primary assumption of risk** -- The injury was not caused by a breach of duty by defendant because plaintiff assumed the risk of such an injury by participating, generally knowing this type of injury was possible. Example of being hit with a ball in a baseball stadium.

- **A Subset of Contributory Negligence** -- **Secondary assumption of risk** -- This is a subset of comparative negligence and therefore does not bar recovery

  - Failure to recognize or appreciate a risk that a reasonable person would have (not assumption of risk since they didn't know, this is contributory negligence)

  - Conscious taking of an unreasonable risk (assumption of risk since they knowingly took the risk)

<!-- -->

- **Conscious, Reasonable Risk-Taking** -- Eckert (rescue baby on tracks) -- Sometimes even a reasonable assumption of risk can be a defense against plaintiff's recovery if that assumption **implies a waiver**.

- Historically this doctrine just barred employees from recovering (Lamson). This is now irrelevant because workers compensation laws, which mostly reject assumption of risk because it is not a free choice when it is a job.

- **Murphy v. Steeplechase --** Flopper Case! Court found that P assumed the risk of participating in the theme park ride due to his information and the fact that his injury could have been foreseen by him. Court reversed finding for P and ordered a new trial.

  - Risk assumed was the fall, in general

    - Assumed they would fall

    - Also assumed risk of defendant being negligent

  - Defendants have burden of showing plaintiff's contributory negligence or assumption of risk

- Assumption of Risk

  - Express

    - Unconscionability

    - Adhesion

    - FSC

# Strict Liability and Nuisance 

Liability for abnormally dangerous activities, nuisance and vicarious liability, all can be imposed without regard for negligence. Key is to understand the criteria for which the negligence requirement is dropped. Also understand what motivates the courts (policy, fairness, etc.).

## Theories of Strict Liability

- **Reducing Information and Error Costs**

<!-- -->

- [Pros]{.underline}: can reduce litigation costs; per case cost of litigation is lower under a high level of generality; factual determinations are less subject to error

- [Cons]{.underline}: need to consider costs of litigation additional cases; per case cost of litigation is higher under a lower level of generality

<!-- -->

- **Influencing Activity Level and Research Decisions**

<!-- -->

- [Pros]{.underline}: gives more reason to consider alternative methods of conducting activities; may create additional research incentives; avoid having victims bearing the full cost of their non-negligently caused accidents

- [Cons]{.underline}: doesn't really result in more deterrence as a general matter (cheaper to continue to cause accidents at time than to avoid them); research only gives potential accident reduction; there may be activities where there aren't available substitutes

<!-- -->

- **Promoting Insurance or Broad Distribution of Losses**

<!-- -->

- [Pros]{.underline}: injurers might be in the best position to insure or broadly distribute the costs of non-negligently caused accidents

- [Cons]{.underline}: victims might sometimes be superiors insurers of the costs

<!-- -->

- **Satisfying Rights-Based Norms of Responsibility**

<!-- -->

- [Benefit theory]{.underline}: those who benefit should bear the costs

- [Reciprocity theory]{.underline}: if you create an excessive risk relative to the victim then strict liability should be imposed

- [Libertarian]{.underline}: strict liability when you cause an invasion of privacy of others

<!-- -->

- **Modern Conceptions**

  - [2nd Restatement]{.underline} (abnormally dangerous)

    - Dangerousness (degree of risk; probability of harm; inability to eliminate the risk by the exercise of reasonable care)

    - Commonness (extent to which the activity is uncommon and its inappropriateness)

    - Extent to which the value of the activity to the community is outweighed by its dangerousness

  - [3rd Restatement]{.underline} (same factors are still taken into account except the community one)

    - Whether the activity is foreseeable

    - Highly significant risk of harm

    - Whether the activity is a matter of common usage

- NOTE---only liable for activities that are cause in fact and proximate cause (even for strict liability)

## 

## Traditional Strict Liability (Rylands through 1960s)

- The rise of liability for **Ultra-hazardous Activities**

<!-- -->

- **Rylands v Fletcher** -- Defendant's reservoir leaked onto Plaintiff's land. Defendant not negligent but presumably his contractors were. Case appeals through several layers of courts and ultimately found strict liability against the Defendant. Court found this was **non-natural use of land** (negligence standard for natural use of land). Could have been decided in negligence - D is vicariously liable for the independent contractors. Vicarious liability is a form of strict liability anyway, except only for negligence of employees, not all actions. Strict liability that sounds in negligence.

  - Re-emergence of Strict Liability, separated from old system of trespass; working against backdrop of Negligence

  - **Trial Court** -- liable because water came onto P's land

  - **Appeals Court** -- liable for anything that could escape onto P's land

    - What is emphasized?

      - No negligence on Ryland's part -- blame-free plaintiff

      - Expressly mentions list of thigns that are dangerous and could cause "mischief" (list on page 509, CB)

> These things = operating at own peril = Liability

- Things that can "escape" and cause "mischief"

  - Talking about beasts -- tame v. vicious distinction

<!-- -->

- (Foreseeability) Expectations

<!-- -->

- **Supreme Court** -- liable for artificial/non-natural use

  - Natural/Non-Natural distinction

    - Some idea of action/creation that leads to non-natural use

    - "Pushing boundaries of safety" = non-natural

<!-- -->

- [Animals]{.underline}

  - Vicious/wild/dangerous propensity + known = SL (old)

  - Not vicious/domestic = N\-\-\-\--foreseeable?

  - Escape/trespass + natural mischief (\-\-\--known) = SL (old)

- **Doerr v. Goldsmith (NY Appellate Division 2013)---**Goldsmith was holding his dog and Smith was calling for the dog. The dog was crossing the street, the plaintiff screamed and was unable to avoid colliding into the dog. Plaintiff doesn't claim that the dog's actions were the result of any vicious propensity that the defendants were aware of.

  - Court ends up analogizing this to a football and saying that it's like that to get to negligence---if looking at the dog like throwing a football then look at the owner's actions and it looks more like negligence

- **Court: Horse owners need to protect public from injury**: a horse bites a kid at a petting farm and the fight is over the idea of natural behavior (Do horses just do this? Very important for the idea of SL)

  - Deciding not to categorize the horse for SL and says it's a case by case scenario but the court also says that it's their natural inclination to bite (splitting the difference to stay in N while tipping the scale to say that it's foreseeable and it will be hard to argue against N)

## The Modern Approach and its Purposes

- The Modern Conception: Strict Liability for "**Abnormally Dangerous**" Activities (1960s through present)

<!-- -->

- **Factors assessing strict liability** (dangerousness and commonness -- From Restatement 2d and 3d):

<!-- -->

- Dangerousness

  - Degree of risk

  - Probability of harm

  - Inability to eliminate the risk by the exercise of reasonable care (most influential)

- Commonness

  - Extent to which the activity is uncommon (most influential)

  - Its inappropriateness to the area; AND

  - Extent to which the value of the activity to the community is outweighed by its dangerousness (least influential)

<!-- -->

- New test reflects courts tendency to engage in case-by-case analysis

- Lose a level of generality but allowed courts to weigh different factors.

  - **Posner: Economic Analysis of Law**

    - If B is small than PL then strictly liable defendant will take precautions to avoid the accident; if it's larger than the same defendant will not take the precautions (automatically take into account possible changes in activity level)

    - SL when

      - Social cost for activity change is too much

      - Little experience within coping with danger

      - Simpler cases with fewer issues and easier to settle

      - Insure victims of unavoidable accidents

      - Injurer was in a better position than the victim to prevent the collision

    - Con is that it can increased the number of damages

  - **Indiana Harbor v. American Cyanamid Co.** (CB, p. 521)-- Shipping of toxic/flammable chemicals via leased RR. Car leaked while switching cars. Plaintiff had to do the clean up. Court declined to impose strict liability for fairly specific reasons, because:

    - Probability that the leak could have been prevented through reasonable care (leaks do not obscure evidence)

    - Impossibility of strict liability having an activity-level effect

    - Posner wants us to think about care and negligence

    - Why not use Strict Liability?

      - Strict Liability would affect activity levels in this case and 52 other chemicals 🡪 don't want to discourage future shipping by imposing Strict Liability when Negligence is sufficient (p. 525)

      - Restatement Section 519(c) = organizing, central factor for determining Strict Liability

        - If unable to eliminate risk through due care, Strict Liability applies. If so, Negligence applies.

      <!-- -->

      - Posner's Policy arguments against Strict Liability

        - Lots of things went wrong but could all be tied to lack of due care, which is Negligence

        - Negligence is a better answer because if courts get analysis wrong, fewer cases are affected; under SL, whole industry bears costs/burdens of effects

        - Functionalist analysis

        - Sometimes, there are mutually created risks too

          - Example: House on O'Hare Airport runway (526)

          - Under SL, one side pays all costs and other side goes scot-free; this reduces incentives to exercise care for future plaintiffs since all costs are shifted to defendants

    - **Guille v. Swan**---taking off of a hot air balloon in NYC and landing in a garden causing damage invokes SL because the value of the activity is low and it's totally inappropriate for the area

      - Escape/transfer example---SL when cow escapes and eats grass because they are known to eat grass

<!-- -->

- Scope of Liability and Defenses

<!-- -->

- There is liability only for the kind of harm whose risk makes the activity abnormally dangerous (characteristic risks)

- Relevant activity must be the cause in fact and the proximate cause of the harm. Therefore, strict liability is not absolute.

- Defendant is usually not strictly liable if harm results from an act of God, unforeseeable intervention of third party or plaintiff's knowing and unreasonable assumption of risk.

<!-- -->

- Justifications for Strict Liability:

<!-- -->

- Epstein, Calabresi. Posner pushes back. Assuming a partial regime where only some activities merit strict liability, why is Rylands an appropriate place to start?

- Reciprocity of risk.

- Posner: Best situation for strict liability is when you are trying to achieve activity level effects. If you can manage risk by taking better care, then negligence can handle by incentivizing reasonable care. Some activities that even when greatest care is taken, there is still risk.

- Abraham: Thinks activity level effects are a good reason to have strict liability.

- We think about strict liability on the category level, not on a case-by-case level. But how specific are these categories? Driving or driving with known medical conditions?

- Why does uncommonness matter? Does it limit the floodgates?

- SL cases can be adjudicated more efficiently but may have floodgates if all you have to do is show causation and damages.

- Is SL about duty? Higher level of care if activities put others at risk/others are vulnerable? Then duty goes beyond a negligence standard?

  - Strict Liability v. Negligence

    - How does SL affect care levels?

      - SL is about activity levels; N is about care levels

      - However, SL also affects care levels; SL might be better where care could eliminate risk

      - Courts determine the threshold of care in Negligence cases; individuals determine care levels in SL cases

      - Negligence can affect activity levels too; cost of taking care can affect activity levels

  - What do regimes of liability for Defendant mean for Plaintiffs?

    - Policy Question: Should D's have defenses of contrib. N and comp. N available to them for SL? (i.e. SL+Contrib. N and SL+Comp. N)

+=========================================+================================================================================================================================+

- Activity/Care Levels

  - Strict Liability says "pay your own way" so it forces people to decide their activity AND care levels. Courts don't have to set the levels.

- Think Like Posner: Cheapest Cost Avoider (CCA)

  - If you're looking for CCA, and you know Strict Liability will take care of this, why even look at negligence?

    - Institutional Competence

      - Sometimes, courts are better at setting care levels

      - If courts make errors, negligence is a better form

        - Setting care levels wrong = not a big deal

    - If Strict Liability, one side goes scot-free and has no incentive to regulate their behavior/"levels"

    - Functionality of Negligence Standard

      - If you know the law sets a particular care level for folks to follow, you know how much care to take yourself.

      - Coordinating function

      - If you know there's a particular standard, you'll adjust accordingly.

    - Aim of Tort Law -- Loss distribution

      - If SL, can't spread losses the way you might want to

      - When no liability, everyone else like you bears the risk 🡪 all potential plaintiffs

    - Aim of Tort Law -- Fairness

      - Fairness is subjective and hard to define

      - Principles

        - Societal interest 🡪 blame/fault

          - Those who are blameworthy should be punished

        - With SL, it seems that one side bears the loss.

        - Without SL, plaintiff seems to bear more of the loss.

- Holmes' Argument: If government gets involved, it should be for good reason. Else, people should be left to their own devices.

- **Palsgraf v. LIRR (w/facts changed a bit) Hypothetical**

  - Hypothetical: What if the man who was carrying the explosives was caught and was actually employed by a company to transport the explosives? What if the company was said by Palsgraf? Should SL apply?

  - Restatement: If you can apply care levels, use Negligence.

  - How we define the activity = important

  - Applying Restatement (2d) factors to activity (defined as transporting explosives)

    - Commonality of usage? - Yes.

    - Inappropriateness of activity to place? -- Is there another way to transport?

    - High Risk? --Yes.

    - Likelihood of great harm? -- Yes

    - Inability to eliminate risk by due care? -- No, maybe could exercise more care; don't get on train!

## 

## Vicarious Liability

- Liability for injury caused by the conduct of another party -- is the doctrine known as **respondeat superior**. Employer is liable under some circumstances for the torts committed by an employee.

- Employers have their own liability for negligence of their own acts. This is for when the employer is technically not negligent.

- Negligence of their employees must be "**within the scope of employment**."

- Employer is in a better position to pay and to make decisions regarding safety. Also it will sometimes be difficult to prove a singular employee responsible.

- Employee continues to be liable for his or her own negligence, this just adds the employer as an additional defendant.

- **Qualifications** of vicarious liability:

  - Who is the employee? There is a bright-line distinction between employees and independent contractors with regard to respondeat superior.

  - Tort at issue must be committed within the **scope of employment**. Distinction between a **detour** (which is within the scope) and a **frolic** (outside the scope). Not always possible to draw a bright line between detours and frolics.

# Trespass (The Property Torts)

## Basic Factors/"Moving Parts" of Trespass

+------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| - Entry/invasion---thing/tangible        | - Things, chemicals (E=mc2), rays of light, vibrations, sounds, feelings!        |
|                                          |                                                                                  |
| - Intention (of entry/invasion) to act   | - Intention (of thing) and fault (irrelevant) remain but there is some softening |
|                                          |                                                                                  |
| - Fault---irrelevant (think of it as SL) | - N---need to show harm in these cases but feelings count                        |
|                                          |                                                                                  |

+==========================================+==================================================================================+

## Nature of Property Torts

- Three type of property torts---trespass to land; trespass to personal property; conversion (unauthorized transfer of the plaintiff's personal property to 3rd party's possession)

- **Trespass** to land or personal property -- Breach the boundary of or touches the plaintiff's real or personal property, or otherwise physically interferes with the plaintiff's right of possession, which includes the right to exclude others from occupying or using that property. No intent to trespass necessary.

  - [Elements]{.underline} of trespass: intent to be present for interfere with possession of plaintiff's property; actionable without proof of actual damage

  - [Martin v. Reynolds Metals Co (Or 1959)]{.underline}---Martins sue for damages to their land caused by invisible fluoride compounds that settled on the land from a nearby aluminum reduction plant run by the defendant.

    - Trespass is defined as an intrusion which invaded the possessor's protected interest in exclusive possession whether that intrusion is by visible or invisible pieces of matter or energy

    - Hypo: factory can get a scrub for \$50 and the harm to the school is \$100 then the bribe will be anything under \$100 for the school and over \$50 for the factory; if the scrub is \$150 then SL because they would just pay \$100 because liability is cheaper (maximizes efficiency and is a way of saying the law doesn't matter)

- **Conversion** -- unauthorized transfer of the plaintiff's personal property to a third party's possession. Often more is at stake than money. Pets are property.

## Defenses, Especially the Privilege of Necessity

- Other privileges can be defenses to property invasion such as necessity, defense of property, recapture of chattels or land, action in pursuit of legal process.

- **Necessity** means defendant acted reasonably in harming property in order to avoid harm to himself or his property (risk of harm cannot be created by the plaintiff).

  - **Public necessity** -- risk to property of a sufficiently large number of people to make that risk public and it can be reduced or eliminated by damaging or destroying the property of the plaintiff. Absolute defense against liability.

  - **Private necessity** -- risk to one party/property only which can be reduced or eliminated by damaging plaintiff's property. This is qualified or conditional privilege defense and therefore compensation for damage is required.

    - Privilege to do harm to another's property to prevent harm to yourself or your property, which is of greater value (p. 957, CB)

    - Not just about weighing risk; has huge element of necessity

    - If you have time and know in advance that you need to use a person's private property, contract for it. Strike a bargain.

- **Ploof and Vincent**: The Basics --

  - [Ploof]{.underline} -- Plaintiff had privilege of necessity to tie up at defendant's dock during a sudden storm. Privilege means this was not a trespass so defendant did not have the right to untie the boat. Defendant was liable for damages.

  - [Vincent]{.underline} -- Ship docked during storm causes damage to the dock. Even though it might have been negligent for defendant to leave the dock, they were still liable for damages because they had a conditional privilege. No wrongdoing, but saving the ship at the expense of the dock required compensation. There was an opportunity to contract. Dissent -- was the act of placing the cables what shifted liability?

- Asymmetry between owner and trespasser when doing the reasonable thing.

- You have to pay under usage both under "privilege" [and]{.underline} under "trespass"

  - Pay your own way 🡪 forces you to weigh gains vs. harms you have to pay for

<!-- -->

- The Property Rights Explained -- Sometimes liability for damage caused when necessity exists stems from foreseeability of the harm (Vincent).

  - Conditional privilege---property rights are suspended and the defendant is privileged to use the plaintiff's property but has to pay for the damage that results

  - The appropriate tort liability rule determines the scope of the dock owner's property rights

- **The Deterrence/Resource Allocation Explanation**

  - Who Should be Liable? Whomever was in the best place to avoid damage/assess damage? Party with the most relevant knowledge and capacity should be liable

  - When it Matters Who is Liable: **The Coase Theorem**

    - Critique 1---assumes zero transaction costs (bargaining)

    - Limitation 1---CHEAPEST COST AVOIDER 2: best briber (bargain) with sophisticated parties to get the bargain going (it matters in the real world where you put liability because transaction costs); pre-existing relationships; fewer parties; neighbors

    - Critique 2---ignores the distribution of consequences

    - Limitation 2---between corps; just use the law to decide distribution; equals

## Unintended Intrusions

Under this theory, you can be liable for trespass for damages incurred when you are on another's property. Damages have to be proven (Harm). There is recognition that one can be being negligent (or another tort) and be liable under trespass for damages too.

## Martin v. Reynolds Metals Co.

- Under this jurisdiction, energy is a good argument

  - Could have drawn connections to old-fashioned trespass cases (flying boiler) too though.

- Case suggests that energy could count -- rays of light, etc.- for trespass

- This case was litigated as a trespass case since the statute of limitations on nuisance claims had expired.

- When we think of trespass as old-fashioned and rule like, it does soften up when it overlaps with other torts.

- **Tools for Arguing Against Trespass**

  - Landowner's feelings -- violation of person's boundaries; hard to prove this

    - Think about landowner's interest in keeping property private (p. 678, CB)

    - May lead to violence if trespass occurs

  - Directness of Intrusion

    - No way to avoid it

- How would you characterize Martin on line of traditional trespass and modern trespass?

  - Characterization of particles as an intrusion = modern, new age trespass

  - Softened up edges of old-fashioned trespass law

    - Particles = intrusion

    - Exclusive possession

      - Protecting dignitary interest and Feeling of exclusive possession, not just the fact of it

      - If you\'re sending something over and if people feel like that\'s interfering with exclusive possession, trespass.

      - Need to show some harm to get trespass

    - If you don\'t show harm in trespass, you just get nominal damages.

# Intentional Torts: Conversion

1.  Ownership/right to possession

2.  Wrongful disposition/dominion

    a.  Give it away, destroy it/alter it, selling it to someone

        i.  Depriving the owner of ownership

3.  Damages

- Difference between personal property torts and land/real property

  - Need to define the "thing"/ownership

    - Need to show injury

- **Kremen v. Cohen (9th Circuit 2003)**---Kremen obtained "sex.com" from defendant NSI (they were the .com registrar at the time). Cohen sent a forged letter to NSI saying that Kremen was dismissed and that the company didn't want sex.com anymore and he then turned sex.com into a lucrative business.

  - Theory: liability for conservsion because NSI gave away what Kremen owns and Cohen is judgment proof

  - **Holding:** California doesn't follow the Second Restatement's strict merger requirement and the leading Cali Supreme Court cases rejects the tangibility requirement altogether.

  - Restatement says that if you merge an intangible right into a document then you have a conversion possibility

    - Someone has to get stuck with SL and it's better to impose it on the defendant? Or can argue that NSI didn't do anything wrong.

- **Moore v. Regents (Cali Supreme Court 1990)---**Moore was treated for hairy-cell leukemia but doctors had him keep coming and established a "cell line" from the matter taken from his body and the hospital patented it. Moore brought suit alleging conversion of his bodily fluids.

  - Court rejects the conversion argument because it's a SL tort where anyone down the chain is liable (will be bad for research) and it's the legislature's job to change something like this; end up saying that it's a malpractice case

    - Instead, the court would have changed the law from SL to N (make it based on knowledge); gone with informed consent liability; use proximate cause to cut the chain

<!-- -->

- *One party assumes possession over another's party without consent or lawful justification*

- *That party becomes effectively the owner of the property by doing something only the owner can do*

  - *Stealing car and selling it = conversion*

  - *Stealing car, denting it, returning it = trespass of chattels*

## Moore v. Regents of California

- *Patient at UCLA 🡪 hairy-cell leukemia*

  - *Spleen removed; cells were unique and valuable for research*

  - *Cells were used to develop pharma products; highly profitable*

  - *Used his cells for research continuously over 7 years without permission*

- *Case framed under conversion -- "HIS genetic material"*

- *Defendant's Case -- The research made it into something, so the benefits were derived from that work, not the cells*

- *Intent = important*

- *Issues with applying conversion law to this case*

  - *Moore abandoned the organ*

    - *But: he didn't express intent to abandon or any desire to keep it*

  - *Expanded impact of applying conversion to this case 🡪 How does this affect the activities here?*

    - *Policy Arguments*

      - *Consequences for research and scientists*

      - *Legislative interest*

- *Think about Boomer in this context too*

  - *Environmental arguments 🡪 Extend/Apply?*

## Kremen v. Cohen

- *Sex.com case*

  - *Conversion without document*

- *What kind of moves does the Kremen court case make re: conversion?*

  - *Chooses a squarely "apply" angle*

  - *Cites other CA cases where conversion without document is involved and Restatement is ignored*

  - *No idea that domain registration was put into a document*

    - *CA has already rejected the Restatement*

    - *CA courts, although dealing with rights merged into documents, doesn't put too much weight into documentation. So, the intangible right (domain name) can count without being documented.*

  - *Case tries to suggest domain name is property and links it to how CA courts have decided on documentation.*

# Intentional Torts: Trespass to Chattels

- Think of trespass to chattels and conversion as on a spectrum

  - Trespass to chattels (need to show some adverse effects)

    - Less interference

    - Damages are given

  - Conversion (forced sale)

    - A lot of interference (total deprivation)

    - Money given is the full value and damages

- **Intel Corp. v. Hamidi (Cali Supreme court 2003)**---Defendant is a former employee of Intel who gets all of the emails from a current employee on a floppy disk (there is not indication of an actual trespass). He then sends between 48,000 and 210,000 emails beating up on management.

  - **Holding:** Would be acting rashly to adopt a rule treating computer servers as real property for purposes of trespass law. There isn't physical harm to the servers and this is the purpose of the email system (to send emails).

    - Counterargument is that trespass is vibrations coming in and feelings attached to ones mailbox in cyberspace (Martin)

## Intel v. Hamidi

- *Trespass to chattels alleged because using a computer is not amounting to taking ownership of it or using it only as an owner could*

- *Theory based on: Distraction to Employees/Loss of Employee Time due to content of emails*

  - ***Burden of Proof:** have to show damage/harm for trespass of chattels; Intel does not show this*

  - *Court sees this as an extension of the law*

  - *Court does not extend trespass to chattels rule for this case 🡪 Other areas of tort law are able to deal with this issue*

- *Theory based on: Trespass to land because Hamidi used Intel servers for his emails*

# Nuisance

- [Second Restatement Section 822 (intent isn't necessary)]{.underline}---ALL OF THIS ON PAGES 681-682

  - Intentional and unreasonable OR

  - Unintentional and arising out of negligent or reckless conduct or abnormally dangerous conditions or activities

- [Section 825 (intentional nuisances)]{.underline}

  - Applies to situations where there is knowledge that the conduct is invading or is substantially certain to invade another's interest in the use and enjoyment of land

- [Section 826]{.underline}

  - Unreasonableness means: (a) gravity of the harm outweighs the utility or (b) harm is serious and the financial burden would not make the continuation of the conduct not feasible

- [Section 827]{.underline}: Gravity of harm---factors involved (extent; character; social value; suitability of the particular use/enjoyment; burden on person harmed of avoiding the harm)

- [Section 828]{.underline}: Utility of the conduct---factors involved (social value; suitability; impracticability of preventing or avoiding the invasion)

- [Section 829A]{.underline}: the gravity of an invasion outweighs its utility whenever the harm caused is both substantial and greater than the plaintiff should be required to bear without compensation (squishy)

## Private Nuisance

![](media/image3.png){width="7.084904855643044in" height="3.584905949256343in"}

- Intentional Nuisance requires unreasonable interference

  - When looking at unreasonable interference, courts look at the gravity of harm vs. the utility of the conduct

    - There could be substantial harm that outweighs the utility of the conduct and plaintiff shouldn't have to bear it

  - Courts also look at the seriousness/substantiality of the unreasonable interference

    - Is it possible for the defendant to keep paying for the conduct's harm without discontinuing the conduct?

      - Sometimes that's what happens.

- What do we mean by intent?

  - If you know your conduct will create a nuisance, that's sufficient for intent.

- Restatement 829(a), p. 683 of CB -- defines when gravity outweighs utility

  - Presuming the nuisance is unreasonable, what if the utility outweighs the gravity?

    - ***Boomer v. Atlantic Cement Co.***

- **Class breakdown**

  - Trespass (to land)---invading boundaries

    - Intentional (SL?)

      - Need to show injury? NO

    - Unintentional

      - Need to show injury? YES

  - Private nuisance (invading use and enjoyment)

    - Intentional (N?)

      - Need to show injury? YES

    - Unintentional (N)

      - Need to show injury? YES

## 

## Boomer v. Atlantic Cement Co.

- **Facts:** Plaintiff is alleging that the defendant cement plant has pollution produced as a byproduct of its operation and it's a nuisance damaging the property.

- **Holding:** Grant an injunction that will be vacated upon payment by the defendant of such amounts of permanent damage to the respective plaintiffs as shall for this purpose be determined by the court (going against traditional NY rule of granting a permanent injunction for nuisance because court is worried about losing jobs and investment).

- Would Boomer have fit under unreasonable interference under the gravity v. utility analysis?

  - No. The utility outweighed gravity of harm.

  - Need something else for Boomer to qualify it as unreasonable.

    - Second component of Restatement Section 826

      - Logic of Boomer = defendant keeps paying without stopping conduct

- **Spur case:** the plaintiff came to the nuisance and the court chooses to require that the plaintiff pay permanent damages to the defendant to shut down and move away

+===========================================+==========================================+==================================================+

- Questions

  - Who gets to decide if the activity continues?

  - Who decides the "price" (of the bribe)?

## 

## 

## Remedies 

- Injunctions

  - Lots of nuisances are ongoing, so you want to stop the activity or provide for future claims/ongoing claims

- Boomer Remedies

  - Injunction = old remedy (serious business -- difficult to get)

    - If damage was substantial and continuing, then there was an injunction

- What if the court gets it wrong? Who is pricing right to fix it?

  - Factory gets benefit of \$50 and the true cost for school is \$100 but the court assigned \$120---the school still pays \$50 (the same) for the question of whether pollution continues

    - If the harm is around \$40 that's where the court getting it wrong matters but they can keep bribing (need good bargaining)

    - Concern: worried about certain mistakes if bribing doesn't work

      - Bargaining (power---which party)

      - Distribution effects

## Injunctions

### Ebay v. MercExchange

- **Facts:** Ebay set up a merchanising exchange and MercExchange had a similar idea and they aren't happy about that (Buy Now feature too). MercExchange has some of the patents (the US Circuit Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is the special court that takes these patent cases---mini SCOTUS for these cases).

- **Holding:** The Court of Appeals judgment is vacated because neither court below correctly applied the traditional 4 factor framework that governs the award of injunctive relief.

  - Seen as creating major change in how courts are thinking of when/how to give an injunction

  - Law/Equity divide: jury does law decisions; gives damages; judge does more equity functions

+=====================================================================+===========================================+==============================+

- **4-Prong Test for Equitable Analysis - Plaintiff must demonstrate:**

  - Irreparable injury

  - Inadequate remedy at law (\$)

    - Are the first two the same? Requirement of proof of past irreparable injury to justify injunction to prohibit future infringing behavior

  - Balance of hardships between PL/DF

  - Public interest

    - Think about everyone

  - [Concerns]{.underline}

    - Can argue that it fails 1 and 2 because there is a thick market and the court can assess damages

    - Can say these are different companies (this is eBay after all)

    - For an injunction---that there is a market shows that this is a viable business; bargaining failed and are not confident that the parties will reach an agreement

  - [Lines of argumentation for injunctions]{.underline}

    - Bargaining isn't going to work because there was bargaining and we know that it failed

    - How can you use an argument for an injunction by pointing to the bargaining?

      - Injunctions can force bargaining (ex post)

      - You just better make a deal (ex ante)

      - Can't let people steal stuff and enter the market

      - Giving damages is just a forced sale (can devalue the patent for the holder and the licensee)

  - If the court knows that bargaining will lead to the most efficient outcome then the court can focus entirely on the other aims of tort law (like fairness or hardship)

- **Western Radio (9th Circuit 2013)**---The Court granted summary judgment for the plaintiff US and held that the defendant is liable for intentional trespass and breach of contract. Forest Service (US) asked the Court to cancel Western Radio's lease and to order Western Radio to remove its trespassing structure, a radio communication tower that Western Radio constructed between 2010 and 2012.

  - **Holding**: Permanent injunction granted

    - Irreparable injury---right of ownership shouldn't be lightly divested, encumbered, or impaired

    - No adequate remedy at law---cannot receive money damages for future damages

    - Balance of hardships---no legitimate interest in the location of its structure, located entirely on someone else's land

    - Public interest---wouldn't be disserviced; if anything it favors Forest Service's ability to manage public lands effectively

  - [How can we change this decision?]{.underline}

    - You can have damages for future harms that have already happened or started!

    - Court isn't sensitive to the facts

    - Court is saying that if you have a property violation then there is an injunction but this isn't a general/categorical rule

## Compensatory Damages

### 

**KA Comensatory Damages**

- There functions in awarding damages---corrective justice/civil recourse; promoting deterrence; recognizing social/individual significance of PF's loss and DF's responsibility

- Preponderance of evidence standard and isn't subject to federal income tax

- Property damages---measured by the loss in the value of property or the cost to report (whichever is less) and consequential loss

- Bodily injury damages---special (out of pocket losses proximately resulting from the defendant's tort; general damages for non-economic losses (pain and suffering)

- [Single repovery principle]{.underline}: provide compensation not only for past but also for future losses if any

  - Pros: case doesn't go on forever; legal incentive for the plaintiff to stay sick disappears; defendants financial exposure ends; less administrative cost from multiple judicial proceedings

  - Cons: less accuracy in estimating future damages; plaintiff must be a good investor to have the award in the future

  - Discounting awards to the present value---jury discounts present value awards made for future losses by awarding less than the projected dollar amount of these losses; reduced to an amount if invested will equal amount of future loss (present value tables)

- [Pain and suffering awards]{.underline}: promotes optimal deterrence by forcing potential DF to take into account the cost of pain and suffering that their activities may cause and provides a sum of money for contingent attorney fees

  - Limitations: can be too high; can be subjective jury to jury; uncertainty results in overdeterrence

  - Responses: remittitur (PF can accept a reduction or seek a new trial if too high); additur (same thing but for low damages); ceilings; schedule of awards

  - Note: not allowed for property damages cases (black letter law but possible that this might change)

- **Class notes**

  - Pecuniary (economic)---medical; lost earnings

    - *Pure economic loss at the edge*

  - Non-pecuniary (not economic)---pain and suffering

    - *Pure emotional harm at the edge*

**Judicial review of remedies**

- Damages

  - Shocks the conscience (high bar to reach---see Seffert)

  - Reasonable certainty (e360)

- Injunctions

  - EBay (4 factors)

  - Tailored to the harm/liability (e360)

### Seffert []{.mark}v. Los Angeles Transit Lines, p. 711-18 of CB

- **Facts:** Plaintiff is getting onto bus and door closes on her leg; bus drags her and causes serious and permanent harm, all described in graphic detail in opinion. Huge pain and suffering damages in comparison to damages for economic loss.

- Types of Compensatory Damages

  - Economic Loss

    - Medical bills - \$

    - Loss of earnings/lost income - \$

  - Pecuniary Loss

    - Pain and suffering - \$?

- **Holding:** considering the nature of the injury, the great pain and suffering past and future and the other items of damage, we cannot say as a matter of law that it shocks the conscience and gives rise to the presumption that it was the result of passion or prejudice on the part of the jurors

### E360 Insight v. The Spamhus Project (7th Circuit 2007)

- **Facts:** Spamhaus is a non-profit company that is an internet watchdog group that identifies and blocks internet spam. Has a Register of Known Spam Operations (ROKSO) where it puts internet user after they have been thrown off of at least 3 internet service providers (ISPs) and for violating terms of use of ISP. E360 argues that they were listed on ROKSO even though they had never been excluded by an ISP. Spamhaus withdrew its answer an appearance and a default judgment was entered. 360 was awarded \$11 million in damages and an permanent injunction without a meeting and based on Mr. Linhardt's affidavit

- **Damages holding:** court says that evidence is too thin so the \$11 million reward is remanded to the district court to find more facts (but some data in the form of the affidavit and the other party didn't put in anything)

- **Injunction holding:** the injunction is vacated because what is true of the past isn't necessarily true of the future (e360 can become a spammer) and criteria of spamming changes (now to violate US law)

**No "duty" and limits on emotional and economic losses**

- **Strauss v. Belle Realty Co. (NY Court of Appeals 1985)**---Strauss is a ConEd costumer through his building account and is inured on the darkened and defective basement stairs of the apartment building. He sued ConEd for failing to perform it's duty of providing electricity. Appellate Division held that ConEd didn't owe him at duty since he is a noncustomer.

  - **Holding:** The Appellate Division's dismissal is affirmed because the orbit of duty limits liability to manageable levels, even where this may exclude parties who would have been able to recover under traditional tort principles

    - Arbitrary line drawn where liability is limted to just the customers (pointing to Moch)

  - Remember: SOL is a jury question and duty is for the judge

- **532 Madison Avenue Gourmet Foods (NY Court of Appeals)---**Three separate appeals from the collapse of two separate buildings where they are alleging a public nuisance for economic harm suffered.

  - **Holding:** a private individual may not recover damages for economic loss suffered from a public nuisance if the loss is commonly suffered by members of the community (needs to be a special injury).

  - Note 7---there is no net social loss so limit liability

## Punitive Damages

**Purposes of Punitive Damages**

- [Deter]{.underline}

  - Absolute (complete) deterrence

    - Has nothing to do with harms

    - Take away DF's gains/profits

  - Optimal deterrence (internalize externalities)

    - Incentives to sue

    - Hard to detect (combine undetected ones/concealment)

    - PL's harm = missing PL's harm

  - Backward looking---deterring this PF's harm and deterring other PF's/society's harm

- [Punish]{.underline}

  - DF, PL, society

  - Backward-looking

  - Punishing DF's badness

    - With regard to this PF

    - With regard to other PFs/society

+========================================+============================================================================+=============================================================================================+============================================+============================+

- State Farm and Phillip Morris are ruled under the US Constitution so it's constraining PD for everyone

- Phillip Morris---other civil penalties it's SL (intent doesn't matter)

- Verbal---will deter; shocks the conscience; reasonable; don't bankrupt DF; proportional

### Exxon v. Baker

- **Facts:** Exxon Valdez tanker has accident. Captain had been an alcoholic and went to do "paperwork" during a dangerous maneuver instead of keeping an eye on operations. Ship hit iceberg, giant oil spill. Billions of dollars of damages (Oil Spill: 1989, Decision: 2008)

- **Issues:** Shipowner'w "derivative liability"? Preemption by the CWA? Is \$2.5 billion in punitive damages too big under maritime law (federal common law)?

- What influences Supreme Court in deciding how to constrain punitive damages?

  - Federal statutes

  - State statutes

  - Criminal law

  - International history

  - Actual awards given in other cases

  - Jury instructions from prior cases

- **Holding:** Judgment vacated and remanded to the Court of Appeals because a punitive compensatory ratio of 1:1 yields the maximum punitive damages in the amount (relevant compensatory damages were \$507.5 million.

  - Other options for punitive damages would have been: determination by the jury for court review to see if it's reasonable, statutory limits with monetary caps, maximum ratio, combination of the two, a multiplied.

  - SCOTUS looks to: England; SCOTUS; states' jury instructions (common law); Hammarabi; Federal statutes; scholarship; state statutes; Europe/Canada; actual judgments

**Pinto case**---In 1972 a Ford Pinto was struck in the rear by another car resulting in the gas tank rupturing and a horrific fire. The driver of the pinto was killed and a teenage passenger was badly burned. The jury award the passenger \$2.5 million in compensatory damages and \$125 million in punitive damages that the trial court reduced to \$3.5 million (affirmed by the Cali appellate court).

- Juries don't like the value of human life to be reduced to numbers BUT juries are in the business of monetizing harms, injuries, etc (PARADOX---think BPL)

### State Farm v. Campbell, p. 760 of CB

- **Facts:** Plaintiff (Campbell) was struck as he was passing six vans traveling ahead of him in a two-lane highway by a driver (Ospital) who then swerved to avoid a collision but instead hit the car driven by Slusher. State Farm decided to contest liability and didn't want to settle and then refused to cover excess liability of \$135,849 that the jury found. Campbells agreed to be represented by Slusher's and Ospital's lawyers and to pay 90% of any verdict reviewed to Slusher and Ospital's estate. Jury awarded \$2.6 million in CD and \$145 million in punitive damages, which the trial court reduced to \$1 million and \$25 million and the Utah Supreme Court then reinstated the \$145 million PD award.

- **Test:** Judicial Review of damages set by jury, using BMW v. Gore Guideposts

  - Reprehensibility of defendant's misconduct

  - Disparity between the actual/potential harm suffered by the PF and the PD award

  - Difference between the PD awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases

- **Holding:** Reversed and remanded because PD award exceeds a single-digit ration between PD and CD; if it does it usually is "grossly excessive" and violates the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment

### Philip Morris

- **Facts:** Williams died of lung cancer after having spent most of his life smoking 3 packs of Marlboro cigarettes per day. His widow sued saying that the maker, Phillip Morris, engaged in deliberate, widespread campaign of misinformation on the dangers of smoking. Jury awarded \$821,485.50 in CD and \$79.5 million in PD. Trial judge reduced PD to \$32 million and later the Oregon Court of Appeals reaffirmed the award to \$79.5 million.

  - Kept going back and forth between the SCOTUS and the Oregon courts

- **Issues:** (1) harm to non parties (court rules on this and doesn't answer the next question---need to start from scratch so won't address the second question); (2) 100x too much

- **Holding:** Due Process Clause forbids a State to use PD award to punish a DF for injury that it inflicts on nonparties because:

  - DF cannot defend itself against them

  - But take them into account to decide how reprehensible for it

- **Issues at the frontier**

  - Class actions

    - No: all the people are in there so compensation is enough

    - Yes: can still have missing PL (past and future) and some people can bring their suits

  - Repeated PD: because amounts are large (due to missing PFs) the people will sue and that makes no sense

    - WR Grace & Co. v. Waters (Fla 1994)---court refused to bar multiple multiple awards of PD because the holding wouldn't be binding on other courts and they are concerned with Floridians not being in equal footing

### Why constraint? Why not?

- Punitive damages are criminal-like?

  - Civil is preponderance versus beyond a reasonable doubt in criminal cases

- Uncertainty ("sheer unpredictability")

  - The specific case is BMW (we have two cases that are identical where one case punitive damages got limited and in a similar case got nothing)

- Arbitrary

- Grossly excessive/unfair (Due Process---no state can deprive life, liberty, property without due process of the law)

  - Fair notice (but in real life this is a fiction)---idea is that when some law is arbitrarily applied it might violate this

### 2 views on PD

- Case by case and smaller rewards---focus on chunks of conduct splitting PFs

- All at once and large rewards---focus on one conduct (one big award in the first case and some states say first come first for PD)

### Vicarious liability

- Respondeat superior---liability for employers for the acts of employees in the scope of their employment

  - Reduces information and error costs (activity level and research decisions effect accident levels; difficult to prove for a particular employee)

  - Insurance or loss-distribution function

  - More likely to have a deep pocket

- [Requirement]{.underline}: within the scope of employment

  - Liable for "mere" detour but not for "frolic" of his own by the employee

## Statutory Damages

Background (federal/states/municipal)

- Reasons

  - Crim-ish (punishing); fair notice/deterrence; predictability; hard to calculate actual damages (classic rationale); encourage litigation (want a floor); vindicate plaintiff's rights; expedite lawsuits (don't need the same level of proof as actual damages)

- Problems

  - Broad ranges while lacking meaningful standards; willfulness is ambiguous

  - Aggregation of claims

  - Aggregation of parties

- Judicial responses

  - SCOTUS departing form the Williams reasoning and criticized punitive damage awards that were divorced from actual damages

  - Courts are split on whether the Gore guideposts can be applied to statutory damages

- Examples

  - Copyright; cybersquatting; SCA (hacking into emails); spam; disclosure/fraud; employer/employee relationship

- **Sony v. Tenenbaum (Mass 2012)**---defendant willfully infringed on the copyrights of thirty music recordings by using peer to peer file sharing software to illegally download and distribute such works. Willful infringement is between \$750 and \$150,000. Sony went after everyone and the award was only 15% of the max.

  - [Issue]{.underline}: common law remittur or due process?

  - [Statutory Damages Analysis]{.underline}

    - **Williams** (con law analysis/due process): damages are upheld under this decision (now there is a circuit split and a lot of courts go here

      - Constitutional as long as it cannot be said to be so severe and oppressive as to be wholly disproportionate to the offense to be obviously unreasonable AND must be assessed with due regard for the interests of the public, numerous opportunities for committing the offense, and the need for securing uniform adherence to the law

  - [Punitive Damages Analysis]{.underline} (rejected here)

    - BMW v. Gore (reprehensible---is only 15% of the actual award; ratio/relation---there is not ratio and don't know what the actual harm is; compare with civil statutes and fines)

      - Counterarguments---helps with predictability; raw numbers aren't good for consistency; can have other measures of harm; can look at other stuff (criminal penalties)

# Mass Torts/Class Actions

- **FRCP 23(a): Must Meet (this is about aggregation and representation)**

  - (A1)---numerosity

  - (A2)---commonality

  - (A3)---typicality

  - (A4)---adequacy

- **FRCP 23(b): Type/Choose Among**

  - (B1A)---inconsistency

  - (B1B)---limited fund

  - (B2)---injunctive class

    - Note on the above: these three are mandatory classes

  - (B3)---"damages"

    - Predominancy---question needs to be a fundamental issue

      - Aligns with commonality requirement

    - Superiority---generic reasons for class actions (extra requirements)

      - Note that members can opt-out of B3 and you need notice

- [Background questions]{.underline}

  - What needs to be common/predominate?

    - Single course of injury/liability

    - Relevant to liability

    - (Not damages for Posner)

  - What if some class members were not injured much/at all?

    - Posner: don't worry at certification

- [Why Class Actions?]{.underline}

  - Plaintiffs

    - \$ in controversy too small individually

    - Pool resources (legal, discovery, common witnesses, etc.)---less costs for courts

    - Shows a pattern of harm

    - Avoid duplication, save \$\$

    - Get more \$; push settlement (leverage)

    - Get more press attention

    - Consistent results

  - Defendants

    - Be done with it in one go

    - "Global peace"

    - Don't have to litigate again since future plaintiffs are precluded

  - Rest of society

    - Administration/coordination

    - Avoid clogging courts

    - Substitute for Punitive Damages which are passed onto consumers

    - Distributional limit benefits; no "windfalls"

- [Limited Fund Class Actions]{.underline} -- think about companies that will go bankrupt if all members of class don't sue together; don't want funds to dry up

  - Mandatory; only works if people cannot opt out

- [Settlement Class Actions]{.underline}

  - You settle before you file so the whole package goes to the court/judge for approval at once

    - You go through certification and settlement approval at the same time (FRCP Rule 23e)

- **Wal-Mart v. Dukes (SCOTUS 2011)**---1.5 million women across the nation hired by Wal-Mart, and who work at different levels, are suing under different sets of claims: not all promoted, fired, not hired. They allege that the company engaged in a "corporate culture" of discrimination against female employees in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Plaintiffs are seeking an injunction along with declaratory relief as well as back pay.

  - [Rules]{.underline}: cannot seek injunctive relief while still wanting money damages just to avoid hurdles that need to be cleared for money damages under B3; discrimination lawsuits can be brought as class actions only when there is overwhelming evidence of an affirmative national discriminatory national policy

  - [Look for]{.underline}:

    - Single actor

    - Policy (Wal-Mart involved an unpolicy where there wasn't a central one)

    - Test

- **Comcast**---SCOTUS didn't say that you need a common answer for damages

  - The damages that are not ok are those that have nothing to do with the common injury

  - Didn't get to the question if damages need to be the same for everyone (still can be different)

<!-- -->

- **Henry v. Dow (Michigan Circuit Court 2011)**---Facts---The Henrys (plaintiffs) seek to represent a putative class in an action against Dow (defendant) alleging that Dow negligently released dioxin, as synthetic chemical that is potentially hazardous to human health, from its plan in Midland into the Tittabawassee River flood plain. The court granted the class certification and is now reconsidering in light of the Wal-Mart decision

  - [Holding]{.underline}---Based on the SCOTUS decision in Wal-Mart, this Court determines that plaintiff has failed to provide this Court with sufficient information to establish that the commonality prerequisite to class certification is satisfied in this case

    - This is a nuisance case and there are many different ways to interfere with the use and enjoyment of land (highly individualized factual inquires---not capable of a classwide resolution)

<!-- -->

- **Parko v. Shell Oil Co (7th Circuit 2014)---**The plaintiffs claim that the refinery has leaked benzene and other contaminants into the groundwater under the class members' homes The suit, a diversity suit, charges nuisance and related torts in violation of Illinois common law and seeks by way of remedy damages measured primarily by the effect of the groundwater contamination on the value of the class members' properties.

  - [Holding]{.underline}: Predominance not satisfied because each could have experienced different levels of contamination from different polluters, damages are sizable enough for individual suits, not sure if it reached the water supply, etc

  - **Met-coil**---certification allowed because (check the chart below)

<!-- -->

- **Butler v. Sears (7th Circuit 2013)---**Breach of warranty laws of 6 states and is two class actions in reality based on a defect that causes mold and another of a defect that stops the machine from working.

  - [Holding]{.underline}: There is a single, central, common issue of liability: whether the Sears washing machine was defective (two separate defects are alleged but remember that this class action is really two class actions)

+===============================================+==================================+===================================================+

## Settlement Classes

- **FRCP 23(e) Judge Approval**

  - Notice

  - Fairness hearing

  - Side deals

  - Extra-opt out

  - Objectors

- The goal is to settle rather than litigate---you need the complaint, an offer, and an acceptance

  - No need for adversarial devices and need to sign of the 23(e) approval

- **Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windor---**the settlement is denied because:

  - Adequacy (agreement isn't good for future plaintiffs)

  - Predominance (different comp. in different ways)

  - **Rule:** must still meet the 23(a) and 23(b) requirement AND THEN must also meet the 23(e) requirements

- **New Concerns?**

  - Non-adversarial; bargaining power; inaccurate; collusion (between plaintiff's and defendant's attorneys)

## Multi-District Litigation (MDL)---Alternative to Class Action

- Substitute for mass tort class actions

- Draws a bunch of cases together from anywhere and consolidates across districts

  - All pre-trial

- Bellwether trials = representative couple of trials

- Designed for discovery for mass torts

  - Get them together and do discovery all at once, rather than separately

  - Saves costs and gives a clear idea of how each individual case would turn out if tried separately

  - Plaintiffs have the opportunity to opt out of the decision if they don't agree with the decision and want to try it out on their own.

- 2 things happening

  - Bellwether trials

  - Settlements while consolidated in the transferee court (quick, easier)

- What devices are useful for deciding cases under MDL/litigating them?

  - Opt-out opt-in

  - Not binding

  - Bellwethers

  - Settlement threshold (e.g. 85% sign up for it to go through)

- Differences with class action

  - Not binding; doesn't have Rule 23 requirements; real cases and everyone come in with their own attorney

- 1 big drawback from the PF's perspective is that you need to have filed the case (need ot sue individually)

- Role of judge---equitable power to make sure that these cases are fair (not much authority here)

- **Vioxx**

  - Merck lost 11 of 16 bellwethers/state court cases. So Merck issued a substantial settlement (check)---the used this information for creating a formula to set up compensation

  - Also, Merck had set aside \$700 million for fighting the 28,000 cases, so settling early on meant they could put that money toward the settlement and issue a handsome settlement early on.

- **BP Class Action Settlement (In Re: Deepwater Horizon)**

  - A whole bunch of claims end up in EDLA with Judge Barbier because it's a MDL

  - Barbier picks the PF steering committee out of the huge mass of lawyers to represent everyone (less worried about having a missed class of PFs)

  - Didn't settle as a MDL because BP wanted to have peace via having everyone bound by the settlement

  - The objectors are appealing because they aren't happy with the terms of the certification

    - Legal response to causation argument: everything on the form is what BP agreed to and it's signed under the penalty of perjury (evidence)

    - Efficiency response: proving causation is really hard and BP agreed to not proving causation

  - What does the settlement do?

    - No cap (pay whatever the PFs deserve)

    - Converted from GCCF

    - No evidence of causation needed

  - [Holding]{.underline}: District Courts order is affirmed.

# Policy Issues

At various points in the course, we discussed different policy considerations that come into play when courts decide how to rule. Various judges and scholars, including Calabresi and Posner, have made elaborate arguments about the policies and incentives that come out of various types of decisions. Some of these arguments are outlined here. Full list of these types of arguments: Rules v. Standards, (Conflicting) Aims of Tort Law, Who Decides?, Moral Luck, No Duty, Sovereign Immunity, Coase Theorem, Extend/Apply Doctrines of Law, and Act vs. Omission

## Rules v. Standards

+------------------+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------+
|                  | Rules                               | Standards                     |
+------------------+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| Pros             | Administration Easy\                | Discretion to consider facts\ |
|                  | Clear\                              | Flexible/resilient            |
|                  | Consistent                          |                               |
+------------------+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| Cons             | Arbitrary\                          | Discretion to consider facts  |
|                  | Ignores Facts                       |                               |
|                  |                                     | - Not always objectively fair |
|                  | "Gaming" the system is easier to do |                               |
|                  |                                     | - Costly/lack competency      |
|                  |                                     |                               |
|                  |                                     | - Less uniformity             |
+==================+=====================================+===============================+

- How to make a standard rule-like = "specifying the content" beforehand (list out what it would apply to)

- Rules specify things in advance; Standards deal with issues after the fact

## No Duty

- Policy-Based: Strauss v. Belle Realty Co. (1985) -- CB, p. 168-173

  - Strauss sued landlord and ConEdison when he was injured on the stairs in a common area of his apartment building during a power outage.

  - The Court compared ConEdison to a public service

    - Natural monopoly because no way to find another company to provide same utilities without significant costs and a time lag

    - ConEd = essentially a public actor

      - Have to be careful about tort liability with public actors

      - Don't want ConEd to have to cut power or to go under in order to cover liability costs

  - **Perverse Incentives** from giving ConEd immunity

    - Policy question: How do we relieve a company, the government or an officer of liability without creating perverse incentives?

    - If ConEd is given immunity, and only held liable for blackout damages to customers in the place for which they are paying light bills, ConEd will have a perverse incentive to contract only with the city or the apartment building owner to prevent owing liability.

  - Summary: Strauss

    - Limiting principle: privity of contract

    - Reasoning: appeal to public services/public policy

    - Worry: ConEd will have "crushing burden" (would we care so much if it was a private corporation?)

    - Bright-Line Rule

- No Duty: Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of California (CB, p. 151)

  - When the patient makes a threat, there is a duty to protect the patient and those specific third parties he threatens. Highly contested rule but this duty is supposed to be carefully and narrowly circumscribed. 2 sets of relationships. Why is there a relationship/duty between doctor and Tarasoff? Medicine prescription (increases harm, misfeasance) v. mental health (doesn't increase likelihood of harm, non-feasance). Ds could be liable and P can amend complaint.

  - When is there no duty?

    - Doctor-Patient confidentiality and Ethics

    - No affirmative duty under special relationships

    - When predictions could be bad -- false alarms, stigma, false negatives

  - Duty to warn?

    - Note 5, CA Civil Code Reaction to Tarasoff

    - Must warn "foreseeable victim of danger" (p. 153)

    - Must warn "reasonably identifiable victim" (p. 154)

  - Drawing a "Duty Line" (p. 151, last paragraph) -- Tarasoff Test (balancing)

    - Foreseeability

    - "certainty"

    - Connection

    - Moral blame

    - Prevention

    - Burden to defendant

    - Community

    - Insurance?

## Sovereign Immunity

- Federal Torts Claims Act (FTCA)

  - The way the US government waived sovereign immunity, opening itself up to liability with some limitations:

    - No jury

    - No punitive damages

    - Suits brought under state law

    - Primarily talking about Negligence

    - Principle exception = discretionary exemption

  - Discretionary Exemption 🡪 2-step test (from *Cope v. Scott*, p. 251 of CB)

    - Specific directive? (specified)

    - "policy judgment" -- "fraught" with public policy considerations?

    - Specific Language - "In the first step, we determine whether it is appropriate to analyze the action under the first or the second clause of the exception. In other words, we ask whether any \"federal statute, regulation, or policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an employee to follow.\".... If a specific directive exists, then the employee had no \"choice.\" The only issue is whether the employee followed the directive, and is thus exempt under the first clause, or whether the employee did not follow the directive, thus opening the government to suit....This brings us to the second step of the test, where the \"basic inquiry\" is whether the challenged discretionary acts of a government employee \"are of the nature and quality that Congress intended to shield from tort liability.\".... Decisions that require choice are exempt from suit under the FTCA only if they are \"susceptible to policy judgment\" and involve an exercise of \"political, social, \[or\] economic judgment.\" ... Only discretionary actions of greater significance\--those grounded in \"social, economic, or political goals\"\--fall within the protection of the statute."

- Sovereign Immunity: ***Cope v. Scott***

  - FTCA case

  - Rock Creek parkway accident

  - Plaintiff made allegations that road was not properly maintained

  - 2 issues with road safety/maintenance:

    - Road Signs

      - Not specified directive 🡪 don't have to do it; there also were "some" signs

      - Public Policy: not a big deal; aesthetic concerns; engineering concerns

    - Road Maintenance

      - Manuals prescribing safety conditions = not enough

      - Public policy: too big a project to fix the roads all at once; there were something like 60 road concerns to fix and this stretch was low on the list of priorities; not #1 priority

  - Policy concerns underlying judgment:

    - Don't want to second-guess policy-makers

    - Courts reluctant to deal with issues of limited resources and how they're allocated. (Judges, not "experts")

    - Don't want to undermine "democracy" (i.e. judgment of publically elected officials)

- Sovereign Immunity: ***Riss v. City of New York***

  - A rejected suitor terrorized appellant by threatening to have appellant killed or maimed if she did not date him. In fear for her life, appellant went to respondent city\'s police for protection, which was refused. After appellant became engaged to another man, the rejected suitor hired someone to throw lye in appellant\'s face. Consequently, appellant was blind in one eye, lost a portion of her vision in the other eye, and her face was permanently scarred. Appellant sued respondent for its failure to protect her from harm. The lower court dismissed appellant\'s complaint. The appellate division affirmed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that there was no warrant in judicial tradition or in the proper allocation of the powers of government for the courts, in absence of legislation, to carve out an area of tort liability for respondent\'s failure to provide police protection to appellant or other members of the public.

  - Court here concerned about second-guessing the police

  - "police" vs. other public services (hospital, transport, roads)

    - No duty to provide protection no matter what because protection provided is limited by resources of community; Also, only legislature can decide police isn't immune.

      - Legislation already there but police not included

      - E.g. Good Samaritan Statute, Crime Victim's compensation, etc.

## Coase Theorem

Calabresi talks about the Coase Theorem in great depth within the context of discussing two aims of tort law -- Compensation and Deterrence. Abraham covers this [on p.]{.mark}

- Compensation and Deterrence

+----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Compensation**                 | **Deterrence**                                                                                        |
+----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| - Loss-spreading                 | - "specific" (regulatory?)                                                                            |
+----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| - Wealth (re)distribution        | - "general" (price/tax)                                                                               |
|                                  |                                                                                                       |
|                                  | - Paying more for your bad behavior/habits so as to deter you (smoking taxes; higher insurance rates) |
+==================================+=======================================================================================================+

- General Deterrence Exercise (Coase Theorem)

  - Factory directly affecting school through its pollution

    - Harm = \$100, Factory making \$90

    - Shifting harm to the factory would lead to -\$10 net profits for continuing harmful activity, so factory will find a way to reduce or stop the harm.

  - Factors impacting deterrence: 1) Care levels; 2) Activity Levels

  - Advantages of price mechanism instead of mandates?

    - Even if harm/cost is less to affected party, we still may want to impact the factory.

    - You allow people to make their own choice, without forcing it.

  - No matter where you put the liability (on factory, school, product purchaser, etc.), you get the same outcome -- greater safety or protection from harm

  - Problems?

    - Motivations of people = variant

    - Transaction costs? (search, information, etc.)

  - Requirements of Coase Theorem

    - No transaction costs

    - Not about distribution of costs

    - CCA = cheapest cost avoider = "Best Briber"

## Act v. Omission

- **Eckert v. LIRR**

  - Baby on tracks scenario\
    Court found that "the law has so high a regard for human life that it will not impute negligence on an effort to preserve it, unless made under such circumstance as to constitute rashness in the judgment of prudent persons." This is true of rescuing people, not property. **Danger invites rescue**.

- Act = "can" be liable

- Omission = Not liable

- Continuous act = fold omission into an act to prove liability

  - **Moch** (p. 175, Cardozo opinion)

    - Moch Co. v. Rensselaer Water - hard to not find liability if it's based on foreseeability. Why no duty? McPherson -- privity is not essential in tort.

    - Contract part -- what can we see about the intentions regarding allocation of risk?

    - Tort part -- becoming an instrument of harm v. failing to be a remedy for harm.

    - "undertaking" = earlier act created reliance

- Act/Omission: 3 Moves (Things you can do to prove liability -- prove it was an act)

  - "actively" omit -- proving defendant made an active omission

    - Test for situations where omission can be described as an act

    - "but-for" causation

  - Earlier act created risk

    - "negligence"

  - Earlier act created reliance

    - Discouraged aid/self-help (example of starting to save baby but stopping at last moment)

    - "undertaking"

    - Maybe works if you think of it in terms of "but for" causation

- **Harper v. Herman**

  - The guest was injured when he dove off the owner\'s boat into shallow water. The guest filed a personal injury action against the owner, claiming that the owner negligently failed to warn him about the shallow water. The court held that an affirmative duty to act arose only when a special relationship existed between the parties. The court determined that no special relationship existed between the owner and the guest, so the owner had no duty to warn the guest about the shallow water. The court ruled that the owner\'s actual knowledge of the dangerous condition, in the absence of a duty to provide protection, was insufficient to establish liability in negligence. The court held that the guest had no reasonable expectation to look to the owner for protection, and the owner had no duty to warn the guest that the water was shallow.

# Damages

## Functions of Damages

- Achieving **corrective justice** or providing **civil recourse** by compensation for losses resulting from tortious act

- Promoting **deterrence** by threatening liability for costs of tortious acts

- Recognizing the social and individual signification of less

## Compensatory Damages

- general rule is that successful plaintiff is **entitled to be made "whole"** by recovering damages to compensate for losses proximately resulting from tortious act or omission.

- For property this is loss in value or cost to repair. Consequential losses such as diminished profits can be reimbursed too.

- Bodily injury case:

  - The "**special**" or out-of-pocket losses proximately resulting from tortious act, including lost earnings

  - "**General**" damages for non-economic losses, often referred to as "pain and suffering" but also includes all other intangible losses (disfigurement, loss of enjoyment)

<!-- -->

- **Proof of damages**: Plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she has suffered or will in the future suffer, the losses for which she claims damage.

- Principle of a **Single Recovery**: Compensation for Both Past and Future Loss

  - Advantages - Case does not go on forever. There is beneficial closure on both sides and for the legal system. Plaintiff has incentive to get better, defendant can plan past this financial requirement and court can butt out, saving litigation costs.

  - Disadvantages -- less accuracy in estimating future damages. Periodic awards will be more accurate. Plaintiff must be a good investor to cover future damages (which are discounted per the assumption that the award will grow over time).

  - **Discounting Awards to Present Value** -- Single recovery requires jury to discount award to present value because of time value of money. Requires two steps, 1) estimate plaintiff's total future loss, perhaps by year, and 2) since juries are meant not to overcompensate, amount of future loss must then be discounted to the present value (reduced to a sum which, if invested, will equal the total amount of future loss at the time it occurs.)

  - Must determine what discount rate to use, inflation v. pure rate of interest.

  - Implications:

    - Courts that do not have uniform rules regarding discounting practices usually means that parties will invest in expert testimony regarding the correct rate of discount which can seem to be a waste with inconsistent results.

    - Plaintiff must be at least an average investor to make this work.

<!-- -->

- **Inchoate and Future Loss**

  - There is no independent cause of action for losses that have not yet occurred. Tangible loss must take place first and then compensation for all future loss that will more probably than not occur is available.

  - Fact that plaintiff will more probably than not suffer some loss in the future is not enough, usually. Occasional award of medical monitoring when defendant has exposed plaintiff to risk of suffering future injury like cancer.

<!-- -->

- **Pain and Suffering Awards**

  - The Function of the Award

    - When there is serious injury, compensation for purely out of pocket expenses do not seem to make the plaintiff whole again. Pain and suffering acknowledges the wrong done and the fact that there are intangible losses. Perhaps creates some consolation.

    - Pain and suffering can provide enjoyments that substitute for those lost as a result of the injury.

    - Pain and suffering is a consequence that the law aims to deter optimally. But for this, it doesn't matter if defendant pays to plaintiff or some other entity.

    - Practical reason -- attorney's fees. Might make more sense to treat attorney's fees as a separate item.

  - Limitations on Awards

    - Unpredictable and inconsistent pain and suffering damages create over deterrence.

    - Most functions of pain and suffering awards can be served even with the implementation of limits.

    - **Remittitur** -- permitting the court to reduce or limit jury awards. When award is too high, court gives plaintiff choice of reduced award or new trial. (ad hoc -- court will only apply in extreme circumstances)

    - **Additur** -- when award is too low, opposite offer is given to the defendant to increase award or have a new trial. (ad hoc -- court will only apply in extreme circumstances)

    - About half the states have put a ceiling on pain and suffering, usually around \$250,000. Some ceilings are universal while others only apply to certain types of cases. This is unfair to young and seriously injured persons who would get more in pain and suffering while those who would have gotten less are not affected.

    - Solution to above problem might be a schedule of awards to exact a toll on all awards, instead of just those that are limited by the ceiling. This is much more fair but also less workable.

<!-- -->

- Pain and Suffering for Property Damage?

  - Pain and suffering damages are not recoverable in cases involving property damage.

  - Abraham thinks this black letter rule might start to give way over time.

  - Some states have passed legislation allowing up to \$5000 in specific cases such as pet deaths.

## Collateral Sources and Benefits

whether payment of insurance is taken into account when awarding damages can make a large difference. Evidence of collateral payments/benefits are not admissible in plaintiff's tort action against defendant. This means plaintiff can prove losses and recover for them even if they have already been covered.

- The "**Rewarding Prudence**" Argument for the Rule

  - Plaintiff who has invested in insurance should not be penalized for his prudence.

  - Mitigation through insurance is not penalization; it is compensatory which means double recovery is a windfall for the plaintiff. But, if taken into account then the defendant gets a windfall.

  - But this creates deterrence for defendants. And incentives to get insurance.

- The "**Preventing Double Recovery**" Argument against the Rule

  - Recover once from insurer and once from defendant. This violates the principle underlying damages.

  - Collateral source rule resolves tension in favor of optimal deterrence even if that means overcompensation in some instances.

  - Also, contingent fee system reduces the value of award actually received by plaintiff.

- The **Subrogation Solution**

  - Usually, plaintiff pays insurance company back for amount of the benefits paid by company. Under this system both purposes of the law are achieved.

  - Subrogation occurs under terms of insurance contract, except for life insurance. Subrogation gives insurer right to step into the plaintiff's shoes to the extent of the payment made by the insurer to plaintiff.

  - Any extra award would go to plaintiff.

  - Insurers right to subrogation usually transferred into a right to recovery since a suit is already in process. Indemnification.

  - While this rule negates many of the cons of collateral sources, often in practice it does not actually happen due to the time lapse between when insurance is usually paid to plaintiff and when awards are paid years later.

  - Also frequent use of settlements for less than the whole amount of damages creates problems with reimbursing insurance companies. Some states have created rules regarding how to do this.

  - There is also a problem with future medical expenses that insurance presumably covers even though plaintiff has been award future expenses damages.

  - Some states have begun to partially or completely eliminate collateral sources rules. Some direct a reduction in award; others make evidence of collateral payments admissible. Problems arise with discounting awards for future collateral payments.

## Punitive Damages

- In exceptional cases there is the possibility of punishment damages.

- Known as punitive or exemplary damages.

- Threat of these damages has more impact than the small percentage of cases in which they are actually awarded.

- Usually behavior that is more blameworthy than gross negligence is necessary for punitive damages. Some states limit punitive damages.

- SCOTUS factors regarding constitutionality of punitive damages:

  - Degree of reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct (judgment call)

  - Disparity or proportion between the harm or potential harm resulting from defendant's conduct and the amount of compensatory damages awarded (**State Farm v. Campbell** -- few awards in which there was more than a single-digit ratio would satisfy due process, i.e. if more than 9 times more than compensatory damages, punitive damages are unconstitutional)

  - Difference between this remedy and the civil or criminal penalties authorized to punish defendants in comparable cases (judgment call)

# Affirmative and Limited Duties

A duty is a question of law for the courts (not the jury to decide---the jury decides whether there has been a breach of duty when a duty exists. Usually a question-begging concept that gets you nowhere if you want to analyze it. In ordinary negligence cases there is a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid injuring the plaintiff. But the question of duty can come up in cases where there is an affirmative duty or a limited duty.

## Affirmative v. Limited duties

- **Affirmative** -- defendant's conduct does not negligently create a risk of physical harm to the plaintiff but the plaintiff is independently at risk and the defendant might, through the exercise of reasonable care, eliminate or reduce the risk of harm. Does the defendant have an affirmative duty to do so? (nonfeasance).

- **Limited** -- defendant's conduct foreseeably creates an unreasonable risk of harming the plaintiff. (misfeasance). Premises liability, pure emotional and pure economic harm.

- List of factors courts will use when finding duty:

  - Foreseeability of harm

  - Closeness of the connection between defendant's conduct and the harm suffered by plaintiff

  - Moral blame attached to the defendant's conduct

  - Extent of the burden on the defendant and the consequences for the community if a duty is imposed

  - Policy of preventing future harm

  - The availability and prevalence of insurance that is or would be available if a duty is imposed

## Special Relationships

- When there is a special relationship, there is an exception to the general rule that there is no affirmative duty to rescue or protect plaintiff from harm.

  - **Tarasoff v. Regents of U of C.** (mental health professionals)---when the patient makes a threat, there is a duty to protect the patient and those specific third parties he threatens.

    - Highly contested rule but this duty is supposed to be carefully and narrowly circumscribed. 2 sets of relationships.

    - Clinician is responsible for the patient's actions (foreseeable victim)---it still is reasonable care (doesn't say you are required to let the victim know)

    - Potential issues---costly; crying wolf problem; clinician might stop taking patients and patient might stop going; duty creating principle for special relationships

  - **Moch v. Rensselaer Water Co (NY 1928)**---distinction between misfeasance and nonfeasance where the duty arises when one is positively or actively working an injury

    - The defendant water works had a contract with the city to supply water and a building caught fire and the flames spread to the plaintiff's warehouse, which destroyed it---don't want to expand duty

    - Act---misfeasance; working an injury; force/instrument of harm; hand set to a task

    - Omission---nonfeasance; withholding of a benefit; refusal become an instrument of good

  - **Cuyler v. US (7th Circuit 2004)**\--Hospital fails to report suspected child abuse by a babysitter, which the hospital is required to do by the law. The babysitter goes on to kill another child, who's family sues the hospital

    - There is not common law tort claim here and the judiciary has no authority to created a good Samaritan liability law in IL; nothing in the ANCRA statute meant to scope tort liability to bystanders

    - Four factors for tort statutes

      - P member of class whose benefit is aimed

      - Consistent with purpose

      - Act designed to protect the P's injury

      - Necessary to provide adequate remedy of statute

# Torts and Their Elements

- **Negligence:**

  - Duty

  - Breach of Duty

  - Cause In Fact

  - Proximate Cause

  - Damages

- **Strict Liability:**

  - Absolute duty to make safe

  - Actual and proximate cause

  - Damages

- **Trespass:**

  - Entry

  - \$ damages 🡪 What's the remedy?

  - Harm? (not necessarily linked to damages; can get nominal damages without harm)

  - Care/Fault? (Doesn't matter)

  - Intent? (Have to intend entry, not nec. intend to trespass; very low threshold of proof)

- **Nuisance:**

  - Using and enjoying property; not necessarily about [entry]{.underline}

  - What about [harm]{.underline}?

    - Has to be shown (invasion of use and enjoyment; have to prove that it's intuitive)

  - Intent?

    - Not necessary (see Section 822, Restatement)

      - Intentional and unreasonable; or

      - Unintentional and arising out of negligent or reckless conduct or abnormally dangerous conditions or activities

- **Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress:**

  - "Pure" emotional loss: not the result of a negligently caused physical injury

    - [Independent duty]{.underline} -- failure to exercise reasonable care causes another person emotional distress

      - Not common, but there are two exceptions:

        - 1\. When a D negligently mishandles the corpse of a loved one

        - 2\. When a D negligently sends a telegram to the P that incorrectly announces the death of a loved one (extended to include a Dr. misinforming the P that he has an STD)

    - [Derivative duty]{.underline} -- failure to exercise reasonable care to avoid causing physical injury does not result in physical injury to the P, but does result in emotional distress, either because the person whose physical safety was risked by the D suffers emotional distress or some third party suffers such distress

      - E.g. A car negligently hits a baby, but does not cause injury to the mother. The mother suffers emotional distress as a result

    - Exceptions to no duty:

      - Impact Rule -- Recovery permitted only if D's conduct resulted in some sort of physical symptom on the P's body (e.g. P vomited); replaced by ZDR

      - Zone of Danger Rule -- Even if no physical harm, if P w/in the "zone" where physical injury could have occurred, and feared for his/her own safety, then P can recover

      - *Dillon* Rule -- Proximity, visibility, and relationship (the greater these things, the more foreseeable the possibility of emotional harm)

- **Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress:**

  - Defendant acted intentionally or recklessly; and

  - Defendant's conduct was extreme and outrageous; and

  - Defendant's act is the cause of the distress; and

  - Plaintiff suffers severe emotional distress as a result of defendant's conduct
