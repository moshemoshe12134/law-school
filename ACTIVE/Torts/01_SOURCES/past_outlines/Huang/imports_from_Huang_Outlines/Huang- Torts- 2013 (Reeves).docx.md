# INTENTIONAL TORTS

## BATTERY

**3 Elements of Battery**:

1.  Physical Contact

- Usually direct (punch) or by an object (gun)

- The force need not literally be set in motion by the defendant, as long as the contact results from the defendant's intention

  - Garratt v. Daily -- defendant pulled a chair out from under the plaintiff

2.  Harmful or Offensive Content

    - Protects not only physical security, but also personal autonomy and dignity

    - What is offensive is likely to be context dependent (i.e. *Vosburg* -- classroom versus playground)

3.  Intent

    - Must intend the contact, but need not intend to harm

    - The defendant must either desire to bring about such contact or act with substantial certainty that the contact will result from his actions

    - Usually very fact specific, so would go to the jury

    - **Doctrine of transferred intent** -- the defendant must intend a harmful or offensive contact with another person, but the person who actually suffers the contact need not be the person whom the defendant intended to harm or offend. (if defendant disposes of hazardous waste into the water supply, no need to prove who the defendant intended to be harmed)

    - If either intent for harmful contact or intent for offensive contact exists, no need to determine which of a harmful or an offensive contact happened. Why?

      i.  Underlying wrong is the intention to invade another person's bodily integrity

      ii. Each form of contact is sufficiently likely to result no matter which of the intents the defendant had

      iii. All intentionally harmful contact is also offensive e

      iv. Sometimes difficult for the plaintiff to prove which specific form of contact the defendant intended, even though they can prove one or the other

*Vosburg v. Putney* -- (boy kicks other boy in classroom) So long as the action is unlawful (really means inappropriate here, not exactly unlawful) or would constitute negligence, and the person intended to act, even if he or she didn't intend to harm, that person is liable for battery.

## ASSAULT

**Assault** -- a defendant, intending either to cause a battery or to threaten one, puts the plaintiff in fear of an imminent harmful or offensive contact.

- Imminent

  - Immediate (in terms of time)

    - Going to go home and get a rifle to kill you is not immediate

  - Close (in terms of space)

    - Threat made over the telephone is not close

  - Actual (rather than potential)

    - "If I were violent, ..." is not actual

- If the defendant knows the plaintiff is extra-sensitive, acts that fall short of imminent may then permit recovery

- Fear is not required; only anticipation of contact is required as anticipation substantially disturbs one's mental peace

## FALSE IMPRISONMENT

**False imprisonment** --

1.  Total confinement

    a.  Taking the long way around is not sufficient

    b.  Detaining someone in a retail store by threat of force is sufficient

2.  Plaintiff must have conscious awareness of confinement

3.  Restraint on the plaintiff's freedom must be intentional

4.  Threat of force or physical force

## INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS

1.  Extremely outrageous conduct by the defendant -- going beyond the reasonable bounds of decency

    a.  Malicious practical jokes (false story that plaintiff's husband was seriously injured)

2.  Severity of distress

    a.  Has extended to harassment by debt collectors and child sexual abuse by clergy

    b.  Has not extended to spousal abuse and workplace sexual harassment

3.  A few courts have relaxed the requirement that the plaintiff be present when the infliction occurs

    a.  Permitting parents of children who were sexually abused to recover

    b.  USSC limited it, based on First Amendment right to freedom of expression, on scope in suits by public officials and figures

## DEFENSES TO THE INTENTIONAL TORTS

1.  Consent

    a.  Intentional touching which the plaintiff consents to is not a wrong

    b.  Defense does not apply when the scope of the consent is exceeded

    c.  Cannot escape liability merely by honestly believing there is consent but must have "reasonably relied" on a manifestation of consent by the plaintiff

        i.  Traditional approach- question of fact that will ultimately depend on prevailing cultural norms and evidence regarding past behavior between both parties

        ii. Other approach -- unless there has been an express, affirmative consent by the plaintiff, the defendant cannot rely

2.  Self-defense and defense of others

    a.  Privilege of causing what would otherwise be tortious harm in order to prevent himself or others from suffering such harm

    b.  MUST reasonably believe that the use of physical force is necessary to prevent or repel an impending attack or imprisonment

        i.  Reasonable belief is highly situation-sensitive

    c.  If scope of privilege is exceeded, defendant is liable for injury caused

        i.  If threat of death or serious bodily harm, defendant privileged to defend himself or another with an equivalent amount of force

        ii. If the threat is of lesser harm, then lesser force must be used in defense or the privilege is lost

    d.  Analyze physical action vs. escape

        i.  If there is a means of escape or retreat, then use of force in defense is not privileged, except in one's home

        ii. Determine whether it would have been reasonable to have chosen escape or retreat rather than defense

    e.  Subjectively vs. objectively honest mistake

        i.  Subjectively honest but unreasonable defense is no defense but an objectively reasonable and honest mistake is a defense

# PROPERTY TORTS

## THREE INTENTIONAL INJURY TO PROPERTY TORTS

The essence of all three of these torts is interference with the plaintiff's right to possess and control his or her property.

1.  Trespass to Land

2.  Trespass to Personal Property (Chattels)

3.  Conversion

    a.  Defendant typically has undertaken the unauthorized transfer of the plaintiff's personal property to a third party's possession

## 2 FORMS OF TRESPASS

1.  Defendant breaches the boundary of or touches the plaintiff's property

2.  Defendant physically interferes with the plaintiff's right of possession

    a.  Includes the right to exclude others from occupying or using that property

- Defendant need not have intended to trespass but only to have intended to be present on or interfere with the possession of property that turns out to be owned by the plaintiff

  - i.e. I didn't mean to trespass on your land, but I did intend to be on that land

- Trespass is actionable without proof of actual damage

## DEFENSES

1.  **Public necessity** -- when there is a risk to the property of a sufficiently large number of people, the defendant has the right to make use of plaintiff's property without incurring any liability (complete defense to liability)

2.  **Private necessity** -- when there is a risk to one party or his property only, the defendant can use plaintiff's property, but is liable for damage done to plaintiff's property

3.  **Defense of property**

4.  **Recapture of chattels** -- recapture of personal property

5.  **Recapture of land**

6.  **Action in pursuance of legal process**

## MARTIN V. REYNOLDS METALS pp. 676

(The emissions for D's nearby aluminum plant damaged ∏'s farm land, such that it couldn't be used to raise livestock; the cattle were poisoned from eating the deposits that settled on ∏'s land.) Causing chemical substances to be deposited upon someone else's land can fulfill all of the requirements under the law of trespass.

Explanations of the *Martin* case:

1.  **Property Rights explanation** -- What one owns or possesses shouldn't be interfered with, and that it is entitled to protection through law.

2.  **Deterrence/Resource Allocation explanation** -- Who was in better situation to prevent damage?

3.  One whom nature put at risk should bear the cost of saving himself or his property, rather than the one who does the saving -- Problem -- just a way to break the moral tie

4.  **Coase Theorem** -- with absence of transaction costs, rule of liability does not matter b/c the parties will bargain to an efficient outcome; when transaction costs are prohibitive, how liability is imposed makes a big difference

## 

## VINCENT V. LAKE ERIE

(defendant remained tied to plaintiff's dock during storm to prevent damage to boat, caused damage to dock) One is liable for damage caused to the other person's property when one intentionally uses the other person's property to minimize damage to one's own property.

Explanations of the Vincent case:

5.  **Property Rights explanation** -- dockowner had right to his property -- problem -- neither party was negligent

6.  **Deterrence/Resource Allocation explanation** -- Who was in better situation to prevent damage?

7.  One whom nature put at risk should bear the cost of saving himself or his property, rather than the one who does the saving -- Problem -- just a way to break the moral tie

8.  **Coase Theorem** -- with absence of transaction costs, rule of liability does not matter b/c the parties will bargain to an efficient outcome; when transaction costs are prohibitive, how liability is imposed makes a big difference

## VINCENT V. LAKE ERIE

(defendant remained tied to plaintiff's dock during storm to prevent damage to boat, caused damage to dock) One is liable for damage caused to the other person's property when one intentionally uses the other person's property to minimize damage to one's own property.

Explanations of the Vincent case:

9.  **Property Rights explanation** -- dockowner had right to his property -- problem -- neither party was negligent

10. **Deterrence/Resource Allocation explanation** -- Who was in better situation to prevent damage?

11. One whom nature put at risk should bear the cost of saving himself or his property, rather than the one who does the saving -- Problem -- just a way to break the moral tie

12. **Coase Theorem** -- with absence of transaction costs, rule of liability does not matter b/c the parties will bargain to an efficient outcome; when transaction costs are prohibitive, how liability is imposed makes a big difference

## VINCENT V. LAKE ERIE

(defendant remained tied to plaintiff's dock during storm to prevent damage to boat, caused damage to dock) One is liable for damage caused to the other person's property when one intentionally uses the other person's property to minimize damage to one's own property.

Explanations of the Vincent case:

13. **Property Rights explanation** -- dockowner had right to his property -- problem -- neither party was negligent

14. **Deterrence/Resource Allocation explanation** -- Who was in better situation to prevent damage?

15. One whom nature put at risk should bear the cost of saving himself or his property, rather than the one who does the saving -- Problem -- just a way to break the moral tie

16. **Coase Theorem** -- with absence of transaction costs, rule of liability does not matter b/c the parties will bargain to an efficient outcome; when transaction costs are prohibitive, how liability is imposed makes a big difference

# THE NEGLIGENCE STANDARD

*Scott v. Shepherd* -- (lighted squib thrown in marketplace) demonstrates problems with distinction between trespass and case

*Brown v. Kendall* -- (hitting fighting dogs with stick, accidentally hit plaintiff) If an act is unintentional, and done while doing a lawful act, the defendant is not liable unless it was done in the want of exercise of due care even in trespass. The burden is on the plaintiff to establish that due care was not exercised. -- establishes negligence standard

## REASONABLE PERSON STANDARD - OBJECTIVE STANDARD

*Vaughan v. Menlove* -- (negligently placed haystack near cottage, caught on fire) The standard for negligence should be ordinary prudence.

*Osborne v. Montgomery* -- The defendant is not liable for negligence even if his acts cause injury when the reasonable person standard indicates that an ordinarily prudent person would have done the same thing.

**Reasons for the Objective Standard:**

1.  A subjective standard would be infinitely variable, very difficult to apply

2.  A subjective standard would encourage fraud and deception

3.  The objective standard has greater potential for encouraging the defendant to exercise all the care and skill she can

4.  An objective standard gives the public assurance of predictability

5.  The objective standard asks the factfinders to judge the defendant based on their own knowledge and experience in the world

**Counterarguments:**

1.  Juries do look into the subjective state of defendants in battery cases, assault, etc.

2.  The incentive to exercise all the care that one can (objective standard) must be communicated to the below-average individuals, whom it would affect most

3.  The effect of the objective standard on predictability is debatable, given the variety of individuals included in the jury pool

4.  While the objective standard does not make jurors engage in psychology, they often must construct a rule to govern a particularly complex or technical situation, which is often at least as challenging as deciding whether the defendant did his or her personal best

## CHILDREN 

- **Children below the age of 5** cannot be negligent at all because they cannot be expected to exercise care

- **Above the age of 5**, the reasonableness of the child's behavior is measured against the capacities of similar children in that age group, though children of **unusual intelligence or experience** might be expected to exercise more care

- When children engage in **adult activities**, they are held to an adult standard of care

  - Potential victims of children who drive, fly, or operate boats have no way of anticipating that the person who controls the vehicle is a child

  - Because of the rise of auto and homeowner's liability insurance, children are more likely to be insured under their parent's plan

*Roberts v. Ring* -- (older man driving hit boy running between cars) When deciding whether a child was contributorily negligent, the age of the child should be taken into consideration, and he should not be held to the same standard as an adult. The standard is the degree of care commonly exercised by an ordinary child of his age. When deciding whether a defendant is guilty of negligence, age and physical infirmities should be taken into account, but the ordinary standard applies. Negligence is based on whether an ordinarily prudent person would have acted the same way if he or she had the same infirmities. In the case at hand, the standard is such that the defendant is guilty for not refraining from operating a car on a crowded street where care was required to avoid injuring other travelers.

*Daniels v. Evans* -- (19 year old boy killed riding a motorcycle) A child engaging in adult activities, such as driving a car, should be held to the standard of care of a reasonable adult, not that of a reasonable child his or her age, even though when engaging in normal activities of a person that age, the child is held to a less stringent standard, the standard of care of a reasonable child his or her age.

## INFIRM ADULTS

- Generally **physical infirmities** are taken into account in judging the reasonableness of behavior but **mental infirmities** are not

  - Physical infirmities are visible, measurable, and verifiable; mental generally are not as clear

  - Over time, our social attitudes toward physical and mental infirmities have evolved in favor of greater involvement of those people in everyday activities; this may be reflected in jury decisions

*Breunig v. American Family Insurance Co.* -- (defendant got into car accident during a delusion) When a defendant has forewarning that he or she has a mental disability, he or she is held to the standard of ordinary care of a reasonable individual expected of a mentally healthy individual. However, when there is no forewarning, a defendant should be held to the same standard as one who experiences a sudden, unforeseeable physical infirmity. In this case, it was appropriate for the jury to decide that her mental aberrations were foreseeable.

*Fletcher v. City of Aberdeen* -- (blind man fell into ditch because of lack of barriers) The standard of care required for one who has a physical disability is the care that a reasonable person under the same or similar disability would exercise under the circumstances. The other party is obliged to afford that the degree of protection that would bring to notice of a person with the disability the danger to be encountered.

*Robinson v. Pioche, Bayerque & Co.* -- (Plaintiff, while intoxicated, fell into an uncovered hole) If the defendants are at fault for gross negligence, the fact that the plaintiff was intoxicated does not mean that the defendants cannot be liable for their negligence.

*Denver & Rio Grande R.R. v. Peterson*-- Whether a defendant is wealthy or poor is not a factor that should be taken into account when measuring liability

## FORESEEABILITY REQUIREMENT

- Defendant is not negligent unless he **knew or reasonably should have known** that his actions posed a risk of harm

- Not negligent unless a reasonable person under the circumstances would have taken precautions that the defendant did not take in order to avoid that risk

- Today, few risks are so unforeseeable as to warrant granting a directed verdict to the defendant on that ground alone, thought foreseeability is still very relevant

*Blyth v. Birmingham Water Works* -- Because of extremely cold weather, pipes froze and busted) The defendant was not negligent to not prepare for weather that was considered unforeseeable, since negligence is the omission to do something that a reasonable person would do in the circumstances.

## THE NEGLIGENCE "CALCULUS" -- BPL CALCULATION

*United States v. Carroll Towing Co.* -- When assessing whether negligence occurred, one should apply a formula, namely, whether P (the probability of harm occurring) x L (the severity of the loss) is greater than B (the burden, cost, of preventing the harm). If PL is greater than B, the individual is liable for negligence. Thus, the barge company was negligent, because even though P and L are not so large, B is very small, as the bargee did not even have an excuse for not being present during daylight, work hours.

*Eckert v. Long Island R.R.* -- The law has a high regard for human life that it will not attribute negligence to one who tries to preserve it unless the circumstances constitute rashness in the judgment of reasonable people.

*Cooley v. Public Service Co.* -- When a defendant performs an act that serves a caution to prevent a more severe harm and that action increases risk of a lesser harm occurring which does occur, and no such device exists that would prevent the lesser harm from occurring without increasing the probability that the more severe harm will occur, the defendant is not liable for negligence.

*Lyons v. Midnight Sun Transportation Services, Inc.* -- Since the jury said decided that the defendant's conduct was not the legal cause of the plaintiff's injury, the use of the sudden emergency instruction count was harmless. However, court disapproves of the emergency instruction's further use, since it adds nothing to established law concerning due care, which states that a person is expected to act reasonably under the circumstances.

*Andrews v. United Airlines* -- A common carrier is held to a higher standard than due care. An airline may not have satisfied its higher standard of care by not having netting, retrofitting luggage racks, or prohibiting passengers from storing heavier things overhead, even though the probability of an accident occurring from luggage falling is very low.

- Plaintiffs are under no obligation to prove the particular safety measure that a defendant should have employed. The plaintiff need only prove that the defendant did not behave with reasonable care. However, in many cases, plaintiffs do attempt to prove that there was a particular precaution that the defendant should have taken

**3 Objections to the Economic Theory of Negligence and Responses:**

1.  It is not clear that economic efficiency (maximizing profits) is a goal to be preferred over others -- nearly everyone would agree that negligence law shouldn't encourage people to waste money on safety precautions (additionally, the calculus can be used with defining another commodity as what should be maximized -- i.e. social welfare)

2.  It seems wrong to put a dollar value on human safety and decide how much is worth paying to avoid injury -- we do that anyway it tort law when a jury determines how much to award an injured plaintiff

3.  The notion that factors that would figure in the negligence calculus can be reduced to a single currency of exchange and balanced against each other seems unrealistic -- Learned Hand recognized this, and envisioned judges using loose efforts at quantification, and stated that this ordinarily can do no more than center attention on the factors that might be determinative in a given case

## CUSTOM AS A STANDARD FOR NEGLIGENCE

- **Custom** can be used as both a sword (by plaintiffs) and a shield (by defendants)

- Evidence of compliance is relevant and admissible but **it is not dispositive**

- A practice need not be universal to constitute custom, but it must be more than just one of a number of different practices; must be something done by most of those whose behavior is relevant to the issue

- If it is custom, party is entitled to an instruction permitting the jury to consider whether there was compliance with the custom

*Titus v. Bradford, B. & K. R. Co*. -- Due care does not require more than conformity to industry custom

*Mayhew v. Sullivan Mining Co*. -- (Ladder hole in platform in mineshaft, no warning to plaintiff) Custom has no place in determining negligence, even if everyone within an industry employs a certain practice, that practice could be found negligent by a jury

*The T.J. Hooper, Court of Appeals* -- The tugs are liable for unseaworthiness, as they were not carrying radios. Customary practice, though it often coincides with what is considered ordinary prudence, does not dictate what is ordinarily prudent. Even though it is not customary for owners of tugs to provide tugs with radios, the reasonable person standard dictates that tugs should carry them, and if they do not, they should be considered unseaworthy.

**Rationales for Custom Rule**

1.  Custom may have direct normative force -- it may help explain what constitutes reasonable care

2.  Cautions the jury that if it finds that an actor was negligent despite compliance with custom, it is finding at an entire industry is behaving unreasonably

3.  Evidence of compliance is some evidence of the lack of an opportunity to learn of other precautions that might have been taken; departure demonstrates a party's opportunity to learn of a feasible precaution that might have been taken

4.  Custom services a coordinating function -- potential victims can make judgments about the level of necessary care they should take

5.  Departure from custom is more probative than evidence of compliance

6.  Legal system has an interest in promoting reliable and accurate decisions about whether conduct is or is not negligent; trial w/o evidence about how others behave in a similar situation would be without relevant information

## CUSTOM IN MEDICAL MALPRACTICE CASES

- For professionals, the **majority rule** is that compliance with custom insulates the defendant from liability and failure to comply with professional custom is malpractice

- A **minority** of jurisdictions follow a general reasonableness standard, which makes evidence of compliance admissible but not dispositive

- Relevant custom = standards of the medical profession

- **"respectable minority rule"** -- non-compliance with a standard rejected by much of the profession is not malpractice, as long as the defendant complied with a school of thought or practice followed by a respectable minority of practitioners

  - Many, although not all jurisdictions, allow that adhering to a respectable minority rule is sufficient to be insulated from liability

*Lama v. Borras* -- A defendant is liable for malpractice when the patient shows that the defendant failed to abide by the norms of medical care applicable to the situation and the failure to do so is probable cause of the injury suffered by the patient.

*Helling v. Carey* -- A defendant (doctor) can be held liable for malpractice for not performing a test that is not the community standard to do, when the need to do that is "so imperative".

*Brune v. Bellinkoff* -- (custom of dosage of anesthesia in local area differed from the custom in other areas) Court held that it was not proper to judge a doctor's conduct solely in relation to other doctors in his locality due to the advancements in communication and transportation; should be judged by the degree of care exercised by the average practitioner without regard to his locality

**Why a Different Standard is used for Professionals:**

1.  The issues are more complex, and juries are likely to be unfamiliar with them. They cannot decide based on their own world experiences

2.  The standard for malpractice does not operate so differently from the regular standard. Expert testimony does not usually point to a precise standard. Rather, experts for each side tend to testify about what they would have done in defendant's place, and what they believe good medical practice required.

**Strict locality rule** -- only a physician competent to testify as to the medical standard prevailing in the defendant's own community could testify (many courts ruled that the physician needed to be from that community)

- This rule is relaxed today, which can partially explain the rise in malpractice litigation

## THE DUTY TO DISCLOSE AND INFORMED CONSENT

- Distinct cause of action based on the physician's duty to disclose relevant treatment-related information and the failure to obtain the patient's informed consent to treatment

- Although the patient consented to treatment, consent was not sufficient informed because the standard for informed consent was not satisfied

**Two different standards** for determining whether the requirements of the doctrine of informed consent have been satisfied:

- **Reasonable-patient standard** -- requires the physician to disclose information about the risks and benefits of treatment that a reasonable patient in what the physician knows to be the patient's situation would wish to know (*Canterbury* standard)

  - Once physician knows of a patient's unusual interests or concerns, then disclosure necessary to satisfy those interests or concerns is required

  - No need for expert testimony

- **Reasonable-physician standard** -- the physician must comply with the standards of the profession regarding disclosure of information to patients in the plaintiff's position, failing to do so is actionable only as malpractice

  - Expert testimony required to establish medical standard

**Causation in informed consent cases** -- must show that she would have declined the treatment that caused the injury if she would have been given the requisite information about the risks posed by the treatment. Some courts also require the plaintiff to show that the treatment she would have selected (including no treatment) would have caused less injury.

- **fully-objective standard** -- the test is what an objectively reasonable person without the plaintiff's idiosyncrasies and particular preferences would have done if she had been appropriately informed

- **semi-objective test** -- the test is whether a reasonable person in the plaintiffs' position, taking into account her idiosyncrasies and preferences (just one factor), would have declined treatment if she had been appropriately informed

  - useful if the plaintiff can identify a previously documented idiosyncrasy or value that would have caused her to act differently w/ information

- *Canterbury v. Spence* -- On the question of informing patient of risks, the correct standard is to ask what the right of the patient is to exercise control over his/her own body. The physician must release information about risks that a reasonable patient in the patient's situations would want to know

## MEDICAL MALPRACTICE REFORM

- Rising cost of malpractice insurance and concerns about threat of liability had led states to enact statutory reforms of medical malpractice law which include:

  - Limit res ipsa loquitur

  - Place monetary ceilings on pain and suffering

  - Reform collateral source rule

  - Require pre-trial screening panels that make non-binding decisions, specify % of a recovery that attorneys may charge, and restrict the application of joint-and-several liability

- Reforms have a modest or no effect on the cost of insurance or on the amounts awarded in malpractice cases

## VIOLATION OF STATUTES

- **Standard approach** -- unexcused violation of a statute designed to promote safety is negligence per se

  - Common-law creation; proper to understand the rule to be based on the notion that the reasonable person does not violate statutes

- **Minority approach** -- violation is not negligence per se but evidence of the violation is admissible and relevant

- **All states** -- evidence of compliance with a statute is admissible, though the evidence is not given much weight as statutes prescribe minimum standards

- In some jurisdictions, the rule also applies to the violation of administrative regulations and municipal ordinances, though often such violations are only considered evidence of negligence

*Osborne v. McMasters* -- (Mislabeled poison) Violation of a statute that results in injury constitutes conclusive evidence of negligence. The statute makes an act negligent, it establishes a fixed standard by which the fact of negligence may be determined.

*Martin v. Herzog* -- Not being in compliance with a statute is negligence in and of itself.

*Brown v. Shyne* -- For a statute to be considered evidence of negligence, violation of the statute must constitute causation of the harm. Since in this case not having a license did not serve as evidence that he did not possess skills, not having a license did not constitute causation of the harm.

*Gorris v. Scott* -- (statute required putting animals in pens during shipping to prevent disease; defendant failed to do so and the sheep were lose overboard during the trip) Court held that one is not liable for a violation of a statute if the damage alleged is distinct from the purpose of the statute.

*Uhr v. East Greenbush Cent. Sch. Dist.* -- (statute mandated scoliosis testing in school, was omitted when plaintiff was in eighth grade, by the time she was in ninth grade, condition had progressed, needed surgery) A statutory command does not necessarily carry with it a right of private enforcement by means of tort litigation. Three conditions need to be fulfilled for a private right of action to be fairly implied from a statute:

1.  Whether the plaintiff is one of the class for whole particular benefit the statute was enacted,

2.  Whether recognition of a private right of action would promote the legislative purpose, and

3.  Whether creation of such a right would be consistent with the legislative scheme

## LEGALLY COGNIZABLE REASONS FOR VIOLATING A STATUTE

1.  Necessity

2.  Incapacity -- i.e. children, person doesn't have reasonable opportunity to know of circumstances that make a statute applicable, reasonable efforts at compliance are sufficient

3.  Emergency -- non-compliance is safer

4.  Limited Statutory Purpose -- plaintiff was not in the class of persons or did not suffer the type of harm intended to be protected by the statute that the defendant violated

    a.  Purpose is a matter of judgment and judicial construction

    b.  Unless there's almost no way the plaintiff was intended to be a beneficiary of the statute's protection, courts are likely to find a "secondary" purpose that was to protect people like the plaintiff

    c.  Predicting how courts will rule on scope-of-statutory-purpose

        i.  See whether there is legislative history or a preamble to statute in question, indicating its purpose or purposes (absence is not determinative)

        ii. If the violation does not at all increase the risk of harm to plaintiff, then courts are unlikely to hold that plaintiff is a beneficiary

            1.  The greater the increase of risk is to plaintiff resulting from violation, the greater probability court will find the plaintiff to be a beneficiary of the statute

*Tedla v. Ellman* -- (in violation of a statute, plaintiff walked on side of road with her back to the traffic instead of on other side, facing traffic, was hit) When non-compliance seems safer than compliance, violation of a statute is not negligent

*Ross v. Hartman* -- (defendant left car unlocked in a a public alley with keys in ignition, intending for the car to be taken into overnight garage but not telling anyone in garage, thief stole car and negligently hit plaintiff) In cases involving breach of statutory duty, the general principles of proximate cause allow a defendant to defeat recovery in some instances when the wrong of a third person "severs" causal connection between the defendant's negligence and the plaintiff's duty. However, in this case, the thief did not take the case outside the statutory prohibition, as it was intended not just to prevent car theft but to promote the safety of the public in the streets.

## NEGLIGENCE AS A MATTER OF LAW: ROLES OF JUDGE AND JURY

- Courts' inclination has been to leave juries with even greater discretion and to grant fewer directed verdicts

- The tendency has been to reject Holmes' recommendation that there should be a greater use of directed verdicts and rules -- there are more standards which provide greater flexibility

  - Courts have concluded that reasonable people could consider factual variations to be sufficiently important to permit juries to decide them differently

  - Both politically less dangerous and less elitist for judges to leave close decisions about norms of behavior to juries

*Baltimore and Ohio R.R. v. Goodman* -- A verdict should be directed and the question of contributory negligence should not be turned over to the jury when the plaintiff clearly did not meet the standard of care -- stop, get out, and look before entering a train crossing.

*Pokora v. Wabash Ry.* -- The Baltimore and Ohio R.R. standard doesn't apply here, since getting out of the truck would not have helped the plaintiff and may have harmed him. The standard should be limited, since whether it is applicable varies with the specific facts of the situation.

## RES IPSA LOQUITUR

Res ipsa loquitur -- "the thing speaks for itself"

- The **traditional approach** requires all of the following 3 conditions

- The **modern approach** only requires (1) -- evidence must support an inference that the cause of the plaintiff's harm was the defendant's negligence rather than all other possible causes (defendant's non-negligent conduct, negligent or non-negligent conduct of someone else, etc.)

  (1) Ordinarily occurs because of negligence by someone in the defendant's position

  (2) Instrumentality causing the injury must be within the exclusive control of the defendant

  (3) The injury must not be due to any voluntary action or contribution by the plaintiff

- When the requirements are met, in most jurisdictions, that means:

  - The **jury is permitted**, though not required, to find that the defendant was negligent

  - At the least, the **plaintiff survives** the defendant's motion for a directed verdict after the plaintiff's case is presented

  - Usually means that the **case will go to the jury**, though a directed verdict for the defendant can be issued if the defendant presents a definitive, undisputed defense that he is not negligent

  - Jury is **given instructions** without naming res ipsa but including the applicable requirements for that jurisdiction ((1) or all 3)

*Byrne v. Boadle* -- The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applies, since it was the duty of the defendant to exercise control over the barrels, the accident could not have happened without negligence, and the plaintiff could not have been contributorily negligent. The burden of proof shifts to the defendant.

*Newing v. Cheatham* -- (plaintiff's decedent was killed when a plane owned and piloted by plaintiff's decedent crashed; defendant had been drinking beer for about an hour on the morning of the crash, smell of alcohol was found on the defendant's breath, none on plaintiff, all the weather conditions were optimal, and plane's clock indicated that the crash took place at a time when it could be reasonably expected for the plane's fuel supply to be exhausted) Since defendant had exclusive control over the plane (owned the plane, only pilot on the plane) and plaintiff was in a rear seat at the time of the crash, Court directed a verdict for the plaintiff under res ipsa loquitur; Epstein reconciles it by saying there is a greater opportunity for compliance error on plane crashes (as opposed to boat sinking) and so res ipsa should apply after looking at all the facts.

*Colmenares Vivas v. Sun Alliance Insurance Co.* -- (handrail of escalator in airport stopped moving, but the steps continued the ascent, causing injury to plaintiff) Three requirements must be met for the jury to infer that the defendant was negligent even though there is no direct evidence of negligence on their part (see above).

- res ipsa loquitur only applies when there is **no evidence about the particular kind of negligence** that led to the injury (Abraham), not every acceptable use of circumstantial evidence in tort falls under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur

- Need for res ipsa loquitur is more questionable with the advent of **modern discovery**; used to be that res ipsa would compel a defendant to bring forth evidence he would have otherwise not revealed

- In situations of **shared control** and especially in **medical situations** where the plaintiff was injured while unconscious, courts have been willing to apply res ipsa to multiple defendants

- Nowadays, for res ipsa loquitur to actually be able to **smoke out evidence**, two factors must exist in situations like *Ybarra*:

1.  One or more of the defendants must have knowledge about the cause of the plaintiff's injury that would be useful as evidence

2.  Any defendant who does have evidence must be willing to lie under oath in a deposition but willing to tell the truth under oath at trial

*Ybarra v. Spangard* -- When necessarily one of many defendants was negligent, but one can't specify which of the defendants was at fault and under which instrumentality the injury occurred, the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applies. This causes the defendants to bring forth evidence. ("smoking out" evidence from the defendant)

# CAUSE-IN-FACT

## BUT-FOR/SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR TEST

Four Elements

1\. What caused the harm?

2\. Who caused the harm/

3\. Whether negligence caused the harm?

4\. What part of the harm was caused by what or whom?

Cause-in-fact is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition of liability.

["But For" Test]{.underline}

But for the defendant's negligence, would the plaintiff have suffered injury or damage?

IF NO -\> cause-in-fact is proven

IF YES -\> ordinarily the test is not satisfied and the defendant is not liable

\*no requirement that the plaintiff's action has to be the sole "but for" cause\*

[ALTERNATIVE: Substantial Factor Test]{.underline}

Some courts occasionally ask whether the defendant's negligence was a "substantial factor" in bringing about the plaintiff's injury or damage.

\*Used by Courts when two defendants act negligently and either's act would suffice to cause the plaintiff's injury\*

\*Anderson v. Minneapolis (two fires merge into one and burn plaintiff's property)\*

\*ABRAHAM CALLS IT "MISLEADING & UNHELPFUL...REJECTED BY MOST COURTS"\*\*

*New York Central R.R. v. Grimstad* (p. 451) -- A defendant is only liable if he caused the accident, meaning, **had he taken the precaution** required by the standard of care, it would have been **more likely than not that the accident would not have happened**.

*Reynolds v. Texas & Pacific Ry.* -- (plaintiff fell down unlighted steps at night after being told by the train to hurry and exit the train because it was running late) Court rejected the defendant's argument that the plaintiff would have fell during the day so there was no causation, holding that "where the negligence of the defendant greatly multiples the chances of accident to the plaintiff and is of a character naturally leading to its occurrence, the possibility that it may have happened without the negligence is not sufficient to break the chain of cause and effect between negligence and the injury" and that the court should not "indulge in fanciful suppositions" but rather just consider the "natural and ordinary course of events"

*Haft v. Lone Palm Motel* (p. 454) -- statutory duty to have either a lifeguard or a sign announcing that there isn't a lifeguard on duty. Defendant did not have a sign, a family drowned in the pool. Question of how should measure "but for" causation -- had a lifeguard (wouldn't have drowned) or had a sign (would have drowned). Court rued that **cannot limit liability to that resulting from the lesser failure**, failing to erect the sign. When addressing the **burden of proof on causation**, the judge held that the burden is on the **defendant**, since the defendant's lack of lifeguard deprived the plaintiff of a means of definitively establishing the facts leading to the drownings.

*Zuchowicz v. United States* (p. 455) -- In order to be the cause-in-fact of an injury, it must be that the **negligence of the defendant**, not merely the act, **was a "but for" cause**. In this case, it had to be that overdose, not merely the regular prescription of Danocrine, caused the fatal lung condition.

## EXPERT TESTIMONY

*Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals-* the court held that judges need to exercise their gatekeeping role in ruling on the admissibility of scientific expert testimony. he **courts** must make a **preliminary assessment of the reliability** and **applicability** as testimony as a condition of its admissibility, taking into account general acceptance of the theory underlying the testimony and whether the theory has been tested, reviewed, and published. The **jury** has the responsibility to rule on the **persuasiveness** of the testimony.

- not easy to pinpoint the distinction between assessment of reliability and assessment of the persuasiveness

*General Electric Co. v. Joiner* (p. 462) -- (concerned admissibility of evidence from experts testifying on whether PCB exposure can cause cancer) **Abuse of discretion** is the **appropriate standard** that an appellate court should apply in **reviewing a trial court's** decision to admit or exclude evidence under *Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals*.

## 

## MULTIPLE SUFFICIENT CAUSES

*Kingston v. Chicago & N.W. Ry.* (p. 477) -- (One fire negligently set, other unknown cause, together destroy house) When there are two "but for" causes, and each on its own would have caused the full damage, and one is from an unknown source and the other is from negligence, the perpetrator of the negligence is liable for the damages.

- **2 simultaneous sufficient causes, both negligent** -- both liable for the full harm

- **2 simultaneous sufficient causes, one negligent, one not** -- some hold the negligent cause liable (i.e. *Kinsgston*), many don't

- **Sequential causes** -- only the one that actually did the damage is generally held liable

[Two examples showing the limitation of sequential causes:]{.underline}

(1) A is on the way to the airport to catch a plane, B negligently crashes into him and breaks A's leg and makes A miss his flight, plane crashes and killing everyone on board; A CAN RECOVER

(2) A has terminal cancer; B negligently breaks A's leg; A's recovery will take into account the fact that A only has a few months to live

## JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY

**Joint and several liability** -- when two or more defendants are liable to the plaintiff for the same harm, each is liable to the plaintiff as if he were the sole wrongdoer, responsible for the entirety of the plaintiff's damages

**Right of contribution** -- a right be reimbursed by another defendant for a share of the amount paid to the plaintiff (traditionally on a straight fractional basis, i.e. two tortfeasors, each pays half, but now usually in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to each co-defendant)

**Why isn't each defendant just liable to the plaintiff for its share of the harm?**

Puts the risk of insolvency on defendants rather than plaintiff (with comparative negligence, done slightly differently, discussed in comparative negligence section)

**CURRENTLY**: Many states now assess contribution shares of co-defendants in propoertion to the amount of negligence attributable to each co-defendant rather than on a straight fractional basis.

- Some impose such liability only on a defendant whose negligence consists of more than 50 percent of the negligence attributable to all the defendants.

**When is joint and several liability imposed?**

1.  Joint tortfeasors -- engaged in a joint enterprise

2.  Independent tortfeasors for a single, theoretically indivisible harm

3.  Independent tortfeasors for a single, theoretically divisible but practically indivisible harm

## INDETERMINATE CAUSES

(1) [Alternative Liability]{.underline}

*Summers v. Tice* (p. 485) -- (One of two hunters negligently shot plaintiff) When one of two defendants negligently injured plaintiff, but it is unclear which of the two actually was the cause, the burden shifts to each of the defendants to disprove that the had caused the harm.

- with indeterminate cause, usually liability only imposed with 2 alternatives (likely because the probability of each individual defendant being the cause drops with the addition of more alternatives)

(2) [Industry-Wide Liability]{.underline}

*Hall v. E.I.* -- if a child could establish that it was more likely than not that any one of the six defendants manufactured the particular cap that caused that child's injury, then the burden shifted to each defendant to prove that a cap it manufactured di not cause the injury

Theory based on (A) the defendants acted consciously in parallel to produce caps in a fashion that made their manufacturer difficult to identify after they exploded and (B) the comparatively small number of defendants.

(3) [Loss of a Chance to Survive]{.underline}

THERE IS LIABILITY FOR LOSS OF A CHANCE **ONLY IN MEDICAL CASES**

*Herskovits v. Group Health Cooperative* (p. 470) -- (defendant failed to diagnose cancer, reduced risk of survival from 39% to 25%) -- There can be recovery when reduction reduces the risk of survival even if without the negligence the chance of survival would have been less than 50%. Concurring opinion suggested that the plaintiff should recover the percentage of damages that is the percent reduction in survival (i.e. %14 in this case, since 39% - 25% = 14%)

- another method of calculating damages -- fraction of total risk of dying for which defendant is liable (i.e. In *Herskovits*, defendant increased the risk of dying from 61 to 75 percent. Therefore, he is liable for 14/75, or 19% - this squares with the fact that defendant's behavior was likely to injure 19% of individuals whose harm his actions risk)

**Why is liability imposed in malpractice cases for lost chances?**

Health care providers undertake to maximize a patient's chance of survival, and not doing so is a failure to fulfill their duty

(4) [Market Share Liability]{.underline}

Some of the courts have applied market-share liability but many have rejected it outright.

[Requirements]{.underline}

(1) Needs to be a signature disease, a disease that has only one cause (thus asbestos, lead-based paint, and other drugs have been excluded)

(2) Harm caused by each product needs to be very similar -- recovery was not allowed for lead pigment because each company's distinct chemical formulations did not cause harm in proportionality to their market shares

(3) Market-share data needs to be available -- determination needs to be made about national, state, and local markets

(4) Determination needs to be made about feasibility of bringing all the companies in a single suit and in the absence of 100% of the market being represented, how to apportion the damages -- spread total liability over represented parties (hurts defendants) or only charge the represented parties their proportional market liability (hurts plaintiff)

*Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories* (p. 493) (Also *Hymowitz v. Eli Lilly & Co.*)-- (plaintiffs were women whose mothers had taken DES while pregnant, defendants were manufacturers of DES, could not identify which manufacturer made the drug that each plaintiff took) defendants should not escape liability merely because the plaintiffs could not show which defendant injured which plaintiff. Since the DES made by the different defendants was virtually identical, market share liability (each defendant pays in proportion to its market share) could be imposed.

*Skipworth v. Lead Industries Association* (p. 488) -- (plaintiff alleged that lead paint in her home lead to lead poisoning, but plaintiff could not identify the manufacturer of the lead pigment ingested) The court refused to apply market-share liability to manufacturers of lead pigment because different pigments had different chemical formulations (market share does not correspond to likelihood that caused harm) and because the relevant time period is far more extensive than the relevant time period in a DES case (over the 100-year period, several of the pigment manufacturers entered and left the lead paint market, etc.).

(5) Toxic Harms and Statistical Proof of Causation

Relevant when (A) identified defendant has caused injury & (B) it is not possible to prove which individuals the defendant has injured

- Example: exposure to substance made by a single manufacturer causes some, but not all of a particular type of cancer (60% for example)

- For some courts, this would be enough

- For most courts, this evidence might be admissible but would be insufficient, by itself, to prove causation because no plaintiff is able to prove anything about causation in their specific situation, only about plaintiffs in general

Controversial Example: exposure to substance causes 30% of all the cancers of a particular type

- Under normal causation, manufacturer knows in advance that it will NEVER be liable for any of the harm that its product causes

- Proposed Alternative: charge the defendant with liability proportional to every plaintiff's damages (liable for 30% of the damages)

- Approach has NOT been adopted

  - Few cases in which there is reliable quantitiatve data to support taking such an approach; unles there are a sufficient number of such cases, making a radical change seems unwarranted

  - Since it is not possible to identify cases in which defendant is systematically undeterred because of its advance knowledge, the logic of this is difficult to contain -- why not use it to remedy over-deterrence (51%) as well as under-deterrence

  - Requires radical shift in the way causation is determined and damages are calculated

*Bower v. Westinghouse Electric Co.*---To sustain a medical monitoring claim under West Virginia law, P must prove: (1) he has, relative to the general population, been significantly exposed; (2) to a proven hazardous substance; (3) through the tortuous conduct of D; (4) as a proximate result of the exposure; (5) the increased risk of disease makes it reasonably necessary for P to undergo periodic diagnostic medical examinations different from what would be prescribed in the absence of the exposure; and (6) monitoring procedures exist that make the early detection of a disease possible.

# PROXIMATE CAUSE

## BASIC TESTS

Foreseeability Test

- proximate cause if causing that harm was a foreseeable result of acting as the defendant did

- applies to the second phase of the negligence test

  - whether the harm to the particular plaintiff or class of those in his position was a foreseeable result of the defendant's negligence

Harm-Within-The-Risk Test

- Is the risk of the injury the plaintiff suffered one of the risks that makes the defendant negligent for blocking access to the fire hydrant?

  - For example, not foreseeable in the sense that it is not one of the same set of risks we would want the defendant to take into account in deciding whether to park by the hydrant, because parking by the hydrant did not increase the risk that the plaintiff would be harmed in that manner

- Secondary risk: Although the risk that materialized in harm was not the principal risk that made the defendant's action negligent, was that risk sufficiently significant to be a factor in the negligence determination?

## REMOTENESS IN TIME OR SPACE, AND DIRECTNESS

The closer the defendant's negligence is in time and space to the harm suffered by the plaintiff and the more direct that connection, the more foreseeable the harm was to the defendant and the stronger the arguments for the proposition that the risk of this very sort of occurrence is a harm within the risk that made the defendant negligent.

- question for most courts is how foreseeable a result of the defendant's negligence a jury could find the harm to the plaintiff could have been

- closeness in time and space to the defendant's negligence and how directly harm occurred would be relevant considerations, but not determinative

## INTERVENTION AND ENABLEMENT

Relevant when subsequent acts of independent third-parties or forces are the immediate cause of harm but the original negligence of the defendant is also a cause in fact of that harm. Question is whether the "first actor" is or is not relieved of liability because of the subsequent acts of the "second actor" or because of the operation of a subsequent force.

Intervening cause -- when the act does not break the chain of causation leading from the defendant's act to the plaintiff's injury because intervention is foreseeable

- driver whose negligence injures the plaintiff is a proximate cause of injuries caused by malpractice of physician who treats the plaintiff

- a party who negligently loans a car to ta drive who is known to be reckless is a proximate cause of injuries suffered by the driver's victim

When the degree of foreseeability of the risk of injury to one in the plaintiff's position is debatable, then the question of proximate cause is not the subject of a rule and will go to the jury.

Superseding cause -- When the risk of injury to the plaintiff is so unforeseeable that it is not a factor to be taken into account in deciding whether the defendant's actions were negligent, the subsequent act of a third-party or operation of a new force is described as a "superseding" cause and as a matter of law, the negligence of the defendant is not a proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury

- subsequent act of negligence supersedes the defendant's act because it breaks the chain of causation

Subsequent intentional misconduct breaks the chain of causation leading from the first actor because that misconduct was intentional rather than merely negligent.

- however, there are cases in which the first actor is negligent precisely because his action risks intentional or negligent misconduct by a second party

  - service station that leaves keys in the ignition of a car it is servicing because of the risk of intentional wrongdoing (theft) by a second party

    - here, the chain of causation is not broken

In cases where the subsequent act of a second actor is not negligent

- thief who stole a car with the keys left in the ignition but then drives carefully when he collides with the plaintiff

  - not a sufficient increase of risk because absent theft, there would have only been one less car on the road at that moment

  - unless there is information about thieves driving less carefully after stealing cars than the general population

- if A injures B and B's injuries are non-negligently exacerbated by medical care

  - A is still responsible because the non-negligent medical care is sufficiently foreseeable

    - Such aggravation is common

## WHAT MUST BE FORESEEABLE?

1.  **Unforeseen plaintiffs** -- generally not liable (*Palsgraf* rule)

2.  **Unforeseeable extent of harm** -- thin skull rule, take plaintiff as find him, defendant held liable

    a.  Unforeseeability is irrelevant

    b.  EXCEPTION: defendant does not take a negligent plaintiff as he finds him

        i.  Plaintiff is either barred from recovering at all by contributory negligence or award is reduced through comparative negligence

    c.  EXCEPTION: Even non-negligent plaintiff is obliged to take reasonable steps after injury to mitigate the extent of the losses he suffers

        i.  So some weakness is taken into account in deciding whether and for how much defendant is liable to plaintiff

3.  **Unforeseeable type of harm** -- i.e. *In re Polemis*, *Wagon Mound* -- no general rule, many cases allowed to go to the jury on this question

    a.  Most courts make the proximate cause determination on a case-by-case basis

        i.  Take into account various factors

            1.  Directness of harm

            2.  Degree to which it more closely resembles an unforeseeable type of harm than an unforeseeable extent of the same type of harm that was foreseeable

            3.  Whether the defendant's negligence caused other damage for which it is already being held liable and therefore not being totally exonerated from liability

    b.  Many cases will be permitted to go to the jury

4.  **Unforeseeable manner of harm** -- i.e. *Marshall v. Nugent* -- general rule is that unless in retrospect the manner in which a foreseeable plaintiff suffered a foreseeable type of harm appears to be extraordinary, the fact that the harm occurred in an unforeseeable manner does not bar recovery

*Ryan v. New York Central R.R.* (p. 497) -- A defendant is only liable for proximate results of his own acts, but not for remote damages. When a fire negligently set by a defendant spreads from house to house, the defendant is not liable for the destruction of the other houses, because that damage is remote. (Court mainly gives practical reasons)

*Berry v. Sugar Notch Borough* (p. 502) -- (defendant was speeding, tree fell on the railroad car) A person is only held negligent when the negligent act causes the damage that made the act constitute negligent in the first place. It must cause damage that the plaintiff should have foreseen. It cannot be based on mere chance, unrelated to the negligence, that the act caused the damage.

*Hines v. Garrett* (p. 504) -- (conductor negligently carried plaintiff past her stop, forcing her to walk through bad neighborhood, was raped twice) Intervention by a third party does not make an original negligent act not the proximate cause of injury if the negligence consisted of exposing the plaintiff to the intervening party. Additionally, the court discusses that the carrier had reason to anticipate the danger of assault (Perhaps carriers are held to a higher standard of care)

*Pittsburgh Reduction Co. v. Horton* (p. 505) -- (defendant manufacturer discarded dynamite cap near a public school, a child picked it up, brought it home, subsequently traded it to another child, who was injured by it) When a third party who has the obligation to prevent the harm is given the opportunity to do so but fails (in this case, the parents of the child), the causal connection between the original actor and the plaintiff is broken

*Brower v. New York Central & H.R.R.* (p. 507) -- (Defendant's train negligently collided with plaintiff's wagon, the goods of the wagon were scattered, thieves then came along and stole the goods, and the two guards on the train did nothing to stop this) The act of a third person intervening and contributing a condition necessary so that the negligence of the defendant should lead to injury does not excuse the defendant if such an act was foreseeable. (Robbery was clearly foreseeable, since the train had guards onboard)

*Wagner v. International Ry.* (p. 512) -- danger invites rescue, if a defendant is liable for causing a danger, the defendant is also liable for damages to the rescuer, so long as the rescuer acted reasonably -- volition doesn't break continuity

*In re Polemis & Furness, Withy & Co.* (p. 515) -- (due to workers' negligence, plank fell into the hold of a ship where petrol was stowed and caused an explosion) Once it has been determined conclusively that there was negligence, the defendant is liable for its consequences, whether or not he could have foreseen them.

*Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R.* (p. 519) -- Negligence is relational, rather than "in the air". Can only be liable to a plaintiff if the defendant did not meet its duty of care to the plaintiff. If there isn't negligence to the plaintiff, don't need to decide on the question of proximate cause.

*Marshall v. Nugent* (p. 532) -- (defendant drove his truck negligently, and it forced plaintiff's car off the road. Defendant tried to help plaintiff and suggested plaintiff go around the corner to warn oncoming cars of the blockage. Another car came, and in an effort to avoid collision, hit plaintiff) It does not need to be shown that the defendant's culpable act was the next or immediate cause of the plaintiff's injury in order for it to be the proximate cause. Since in the present case the situation had not yet been stabilized and returned to normal, the lower court committed no error in leaving the issue to the jury.

*Overseas Tankship (U.K.) Ltd. v. Morts Dock & Engineering Co., Ltd (Wagon Mound 1)* (p. 536) -- (Defendants carelessly let oil drip from their ship. It was foreseeable that the oil might damage the dock a little, but it wasn't foreseeable that it was flammable and would cause the wharf to fully burn.) A defendant is only responsible for the probable consequences of his act (overruling *In re Polemis*)

*Petition of Kinsman Transit Co.* (p. 543) -- (bad weather caused a negligently tied ship to be released, it knocked another ship loose, both went downstream and crashed into a drawbridge, the crew tending the drawbridge weren't alert and didn't raise the bridge, and flooding ensued) Extent of harm not foreseen and type of harm not foreseen are not excuses for not holding defendants liable

*Virden v. Betts and Beer Construction Company* (p. 545) -- (Defendants negligently installed an angle iron in the ceiling and plaintiff was asked to repair it, while doing so he fell from the top of a ladder) The injury to the plaintiff must be said to fall naturally within the scope of the probable risk created by the defendant's negligence.

*Herbert v. Enos* (p. 547) -- (plaintiff received a severe electric shock while watering de*f*endant's flowers. Defendant faultily repaired a toilet, which flooded, reacted with the home's electrical system, and created an electrical current) Defendant is only responsible for injuries that are a reasonably foreseeable consequence of negligence on the defendant's part.

- Abraham proposes that proximate cause has little to do with causation, and really should be renamed as "scope of liability"

# DEFENSES BASED ON PLAINTIFF'S CONDUCT

## CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE

Contributory negligence -- the failure of the plaintiff to exercise reasonable care to protect himself or his property from the risk of harm or loss

- the defendant must prove:

  - the plaintiff breached a duty to exercise reasonable care to protect himself from harm

  - this breach was both a cause in fact and proximate cause of his suffering harm

- proving contributory negligence is a complete bar to recovery for the plaintiff

**[Safety statute exception]{.underline}** -- when a defendant's negligence consisted of the breach of a statute designed specifically to protect a class of persons unable to protect themselves against the defendant's negligence, the contributory negligence of a member of the protected class is not a bar to recovery

- many courts held (and still hold) of this exception

- Example: driver of school bus negligently fails to take measures required by statute when students exit the bus, a student's contributory negligence is not a defense in an action for injuries resulting from the driver's negligence

  - Safety measures mandated specifically because of the risk that the students will not exercise reasonable care to protect themselves

**[Greater-degree-of-blame exception]{.underline}** -- Contributory negligence did not bar recovery when the defendant's conduct was more blameworthy than negligence (i.e. gross negligence, willful misconduct).

- However, if plaintiff's conduct was equally blameworthy, it did apply

*Butterfield v. Forrester* (p. 328) -- (Defendant obstructed highway, plaintiff rode horse too fast) If a plaintiff does not exercise reasonable care, and with the exercise of reasonable care the accident would not have happened, the plaintiff is barred from recovery due to contributory negligence.

*Beems v. Chicago, Rock Island, & Peoria R.R.* (p. 329) -- (decedent killed while attempting to uncouple cars, signaled to other employee to slow down, assumed he would listen to signal but didn't) plaintiff is not contributorily negligent if signaled but other employees didn't heed signal

*Gyerman v. United States Lines Co.* (p. 333) -- (plaintiff noticed that stacks of fishmeal weren't packed safely, didn't complain to own supervisor) The defendant bears the burden of proof with respect to contributory negligence (bore burden of showing that telling supervisor would have helped, etc.).

*Mahoney v. Beatman* -- (plaintiff was driving a Rolls-Royce when the defendant negligently crossed into the plaintiff's lane going the opposite direction, hit the plaintiff, and the plaintiff's driver lost control over the car and sustained additional damage when it hit a tree and stone wall) Trial court said that there was contributory negligence on the additional damage because of the speed of the Rolls Royce; the appeals court overturned and gave the plaintiff full judgment for the additional damages, ruling that the defendant's negligence was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's entire damage

*LeRoy Fibre Co. v. Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry.* (p. 342) -- (plaintiff had piles of flax on property near railroad, sparks shot out of negligently handled train, destroyed the flax) A plaintiff cannot be contributorily negligent in the way he uses his own property (Holmes partial dissent -- Case should be remanded to the jury to determine whether had the train not been managed negligently, the flax still would have caught on fire. Liability depends on whether it was the negligence of the train that caused it.)

*Derheim v. N. Fiorito Co.* (p. 345) -- (plaintiff wasn't wearing a seatbelt) When there is no statutory duty to wear a seatbelt, not wearing a seatbelt does not constitute contributory negligence in automobile accidents. The seatbelt issue is distinguished from the usual contributory negligence model in that the failure to buckle up occurs before the defendant's negligence as opposed to contributing to the occurrence of the accident. The belt only contributes to and is causally related to the injury, not the occurrence of the accident in the first place. Policy considerations as well lead the court to conclude that not wearing a seatbelt does not constitute contributory negligence: medical evidence would need to be invoked, prolonging already dragged out automobile accident cases, and questions would abound concerning failure to use other safety features (properly) with which the car is equipped.

*Spier v. Barker* - NY Court of Appeals allowed the \"seat belt defense\" in determining the extent of plaintiff's injuries, placing the burden of proof on defendant to show that plaintiff\'s failure to use a seatbelt was a cause of increased injury. The court used Prosser\'s doctrine of avoidable consequences, precluding recovery of any damages that could have been avoided by reasonable conduct on the part of the plaintiff. The "seat belt defense" could only be used to determine the plaintiff's damages, but not in resolving the issue of liability

## LAST CLEAR CHANCE RULE

If the negligent defendant had the last clear chance to avoid harming the plaintiff, then the plaintiff's contributory negligence was not a bar to recovery.

- clear chance is both open and obvious

- recovery has been permitted when there was not clear chance but it was the last chance

  - plaintiff only needs to prove that the defendant "had reason" to appreciate the danger

- doctrine has also been applied when the defendant's chance was clear but not last

  - occurred when plaintiff could have extricated himself from his position of danger up until the moment of injury through the exercise of reasonable care but failed to do so

  - idea was that if the plaintiff is in a position of obvious peril and the defendant knows this but negligently still injures him, he does so intentionally or recklessly

\*HAS FADED AWAY WITH THE ADVENT OF COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE\*

*Fuller v. Illinois Central R.R.* (p. 350) -- (Plaintiff crossed train tracks negligently, the train engineer did not stop the train when decedent should have come into plain view) Even if the plaintiff is contributory negligent, if the defendant had the last clear chance of preventing the injury and failed to do so, the plaintiff is not barred by contributory negligence from recovering.

*Kumkumian v. City of New York* (p. 354) -- Plaintiff was unconscious lying on the subway tracks, when the train hit the plaintiff the first time, its stopping system went into effect, but the operators merely thought the train was malfunctioning and tried to move again. This happened again. On the third time, the operators checked and saw the corpse of decedent. Left it to the jury as to whether the motorman and conductor were negligent in disregarding the emergency equipment two times

- Perhaps courts felt that there is something more blameworthy about having the last clear chance and still acting negligently

- Courts often applied the last clear shot doctrine when the defendant had the last chance but it wasn't clear, or they had a clear chance but it wasn't last

## IMPUTED CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE

*Millis v. Armstrong* (p. 355) -- (plaintiff is riding a bus, that bus gets into an accident with another bus, both drivers were negligent) The contributory negligence of those in charge of operating the carrier upon which the plaintiff was situated during the accident is not imputed to the plaintiff.

## COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE

All but 4 states (AL, MD, NC, VA (& DC)) have replaced the contributory negligence defense with a comparative negligence regime

Plaintiff's recovery is reduced "in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to him"

**Pure comparative negligence** -- plaintiff's negligence is never a complete bar of recovery

- 13 states have adopted this approach

**Modified comparative negligence** -- if the plaintiff is found more negligent than the defendant (and in some versions, equally as negligent), plaintiff's negligence is a complete bar

- Most (33) states have adopted modified comparative negligence

**comparing negligence, not causation**

- in comparing negligence, there is an automatic comparison of an aspect of causation because the foreseeable probability of causing harm is a component of what it means to be negligent

- jury's decision therefore should take into account the probability that the conduct will cause harm even though the amount of causal contribution is not relevant

**[Applications:]{.underline}**

1.  **Multiple Defendants** -- if the plaintiff is more liable than any other defendant, but not more than 50% liable, under modified comparative negligence, most courts found that she can still recover

    a.  Theory is that the plaintiff should be able to recover something unless she is principally responsible for her own harm \<- most courts accept this

    b.  Alternative minority view -- defendant should not be held liable unless she is at least as responsible for the plaintiff's harm as the plaintiff

2.  **Joint and Several Liability** -- 3 approaches:

    a.  Hold the defendants jointly and severally liable for the judgment (the amount of their negligence put together, amount of negligence after plaintiff's share had been subtracted)

        i.  Makes sense when the defendants are joint tortfeasors or acted in concert but not when they are merely concurrent actors

    b.  Each defendant only liable for its share

        i.  Assumes plaintiff is an injurer of the plaintiff and thus no party should be liable for more than its share

    c.  Each party, including the plaintiff, is an injurer, and therefore, the solvent defendants and the plaintiff bear the risk of another defendant's insolvency, in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to them (i.e. plaintiff is 40% negligent, solvent defendant is 35%, insolvent is 25%, total of solvent people's negligence is 75%, so solvent defendant would be liable to plaintiff for 35/75ths of the insolvent's share, in addition to its own share)

3.  **Effect on Other Common Law Doctrines** -- most courts have held that last clear chance, greater-degree-of-blame, and assumption of risk no longer apply, and are assimilated into comparative negligence scheme

    a.  Some courts have interpreted the comparative negligence statutes to only apply to negligence actions and thus have no effect on the greater-degree-of-blame exception

        i.  Plaintiff's negligence is no defense at all to an intentional or similar tort but that neither does comparative negligence abolish the same-degree-of-blame defenses to such torts

4.  **Strict Liability**

    a.  Straightforward approach is to apply comparative negligence wherever contributory negligence previously applied; issue is that strict liability does not factor in the defendant's negligence and thus introducing the plaintiff's negligence would require an analysis of the defendant's negligence as well

        i.  If contributory negligence did not apply because actors were held strictly liable because they were the best bearer of the risk, then comparative negligence should not apply

        ii. If contributory negligence did not apply because it was viewed as excessively harsh, then comparative negligence should apply

    b.  What about if the defendant was not in fact in fault but is held strictly liable nonetheless?

        i.  Abraham: Plaintiff's negligence should be compared with the way he should have behaved -- if 50% less safe, then reduce damages by that much

        ii. Courts have been incoherent on this issue

            1.  Court held in Daly v. General Motors Corp. that the jury was asked to engage in an equitable apportionment of liability.

            2.  Regardless of whether it is coherent to employ comparative negligence in strict liability cases, it will be done because it is fair to do so.

5.  **Setoffs** -- when both parties have insurance, both insurance companies pay out the amount that party owes the other

    a.  not that the smaller award is subtracted from the bigger, and just difference is paid by the party who received the smaller award to the one who received the bigger

        i.  in non-insurance claim cases, the above is exactly what should be done

*Li v. Yellow Cab Co. of California* (p. 384) -- (plaintiff crossed three lanes of oncoming traffic, defendant travelled at an excessive speed and ran a yellow light) Court adopted the pure form of comparative negligence. Additionally, court stated that last clear shot doctrine and assumption of risk no longer should apply, as they should be assimilated into a comparative negligence regime.

*Bradley v. Appalachian Power Co.* -- WV Sup. Ct. adopted comparative negligence by judicial action but chose to go with modified comparative negligence, not pure comparative negligence as in *Li*

## ASSUMPTION OF RISK

**4 Types of Assumption of Risk (p. 161, A):**

1.  Express assumption of risk (i.e. *Dalury*, waiver)

    a.  Individual contractually agrees in advance to waive his right to bring a tort action against a potential injurer

        i.  Valid when entered into knowingly, voluntarily, and with appreciation of their significance

        ii. Importance of the service or commodity being sold and bargaining power of the parties is also relevant

    b.  Residential leases, landlord's liability, health club membership, and ski resort contracts are usually upheld -- health care providers' disclaimers for malpractice are virtually always invalid

2.  No duty of care breached by defendant, sometimes refereed to as "primary" assumption of the risk (i.e. attending a ballgame)

    a.  Except in connection with activities that involve strict liability for the injuries they cause, a victim always and necessarily assumes the risk that he will be non-negligently injured

    b.  No liability if the defendant did not breach a duty of care to the plaintiff

3.  A subset of contributory negligence -- conscious taking of an unreasonable risk

4.  Conscious, reasonable risk-taking -- usually not a defense (i.e. *Eckert -- decedent killed while rescuing a child from being struck by a train*), but in some cases it is (i.e. fireman's rule, barring firefighters from recovering for injuries they suffer in fighting negligently set fires)

*Lamson v. American Axe & Tool Co.* (p. 360) -- (At plaintiff's workplace, a hatchet fell, injuring him. He had previously complained about their racks, and said he can either use the racks or leave) When the plaintiff appreciates the danger an activity poses and understands what is likely to happen yet still engages in the activity, he assumes the risk and the defendant is not liable for harm resulting from the risk actually materializing.

*Murphy v. Steeplechase Amusement Co.* (p. 365) -- (Flopper ride) When a plaintiff knows the risk that a certain activity holds and engages in it anyway, and is injured in the expected way, the plaintiff assumed the risk and the defendant is not liable.

*Meistrich v. Casino Arena Attractions, Inc. --* (plaintiff was ice skating in defendant's arena, which was too hard and slippery for ordinary skaters, plaintiff knew this but continued skating and was injured) Court held that this should be reasoned under the secondary assumption of risk; if a reasonable person would have undertaken the same risks as the plaintiff, then there is no contributory negligence

*Marshall v. Ranne* -- (defendant's vicious boar bit the plaintiff after the plaintiff had in the past complained about its condition to the defendant and passed up opportunities to shoot it) Jury denied plaintiff's recovery because he was contributorily negligent in not shooting the boar and because he voluntarily assumed the risk of harm; Texas Sup. Ct. reversed, holding that contributory negligence was not a defense in a case of strict liability; as for voluntary assumption of risk, it said that defendant was stuck between a rock and a hard place (always staying at home vs. risk being attacked by the boar) and so he could not be held liable for making a choice between two evils

*Krauth v. Geller* -- laid out public policy arguments for alleging assumption of risk for firemen; no duty owed to fireman to exercise care in not having a fire because their job is to deal with that very hazard; firemen receive appropriate compensation in pay and worker's compensation for those inherent risks (this firefighter's rule has been eroded by statute -- NY law holds that a defendant who fails to make proper building inspections is liable in damages for harms directly or indirectly caused by a fire on the premises -- Court allowed a case to go to the jury when the fireman suffered burns when his oxygen tank went empty because building did not maintain the fire control system (Guiffrida v. Citibank))

*Dalury v. S-K-I Ltd.* (p. 374) -- (A ski resort made plaintiff sign a waiver releasing them from liability) A waiver to release from liability does not release the defendant from liability for negligence if it exhibits some or all of the following characteristics:

1.  it concerns a business suitable for public regulation

2.  The party is engaged in performing a service of great importance to the public

3.  The party holds itself out as willing to perform this service for any member of the public who seeks it, or at least for any member coming within certain established standards

4.  As a result of the nature of the service, the party invoking exculpation has a decisive advantage in terms of bargaining strength against an member of the public who seeks it services

5.  The waiver is within a standardized adhesion contract (can't pay more to not have the waiver)

6.  The person or property of the purchaser is placed under the control of the seller, subject to the risk of carelessness by the seller

A ski resort exhibits a sufficient number of the characteristics that their waiver doesn't release them from liability for negligence

# STRICT LIABILITY

## ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR

(1) Reducing information, administration, and error costs

    a.  Less evidence is needed to

(2) Influencing activity level and research decisions

    a.  Strict liability gives parties more reason to consider alternative methods of conducting their activities or reduce their activity level in the strict liability action

    b.  Additional research incentives because more to be gained by avoiding liability

(3) Promoting insurance or broad distribution of losses

    a.  Particular class of insurers is in the best position to insure or otherwise broadly distribute the costs of non0negligently caused accidents

    b.  Big institutions who are more likely to injure can distribute their losses by increasing prices or reducing services or purchase liability insurance whose cost is included in these prices or services

        i.  Can look at health care insurance in a different way -- victim should be more responsible because health coverage covered by his plan

(4) Satisfying rights-based norms of responsibilities

    a.  Owners, employees, and customers of enterprises benefit from their activities and should pay, at least indirectly, for the injuries that enterprises cause

    b.  "reciprocity theory" -- strict liability should be imposed when an activity poses risks for potential victims that the victims do not also pose for others

        i.  disproportionate, excessive risk of harm

    c.  liability should be imposed when an injurer acts in a manner that causes the invasion of the liberty of others

## ANIMALS

*Gehrts v. Batteen* (p. 645) -- With respect to animal injuries, the owner is only held to the strict liability standard if the animal is not a domesticated one or if the animal had on a previous occasion demonstrated dangerous propensities. If the animal doesn't meet either of those two conditions, the owner is held to the normal standard of care for negligence.

## DANGEROUS ACTIVITIES

[Ultrahazardous Activities -- OLD TEST]{.underline}

The more dangerous and less common the activity, the more likely it is to qualify as ultrahazardous.

(1) Degree of danger posed

    1.  The more dangerous the activity, the more violent it is likely to be and therefore the more likely it is to destroy evidence that would enable the plaintiff to prove that the defendant conducted the activity negligently

(2) How common the activity is in the area

    1.  The more uncommon an activity is, the more likely that the activity-level and research incentives created by the trhreat of strict liability will be most effective in operating on potential injurers rather than potential victims

    2.  Potential victims are unlikely to know much about an uncommon activity and therefor unlikely to be in a position to protect themselves against the risk the activity poses

[Abnormally Dangerous Activities -- CURRENT TEST]{.underline}

In determining whether an activity is abnormally dangerous, the following factors are to be considered:

a)  Existence of a high degree of risk of harm to the person, land or chattels of others

b)  Likelihood that the harm that results from it will be great

c)  Inability to eliminate the risk by the exercise of reasonable care

d)  Extent to which the activity is not a matter of common usage

e)  Inappropriateness of the activity to the place where it is carried on

f)  Extent to which its value to the community is outweighed by its dangerous attributes

Of the factors, (c) and (d) are the most significant while (f) has been basically eliminated by the Restatement and deemed irrelevant in many courts.

[Abnormally Dangerous Activities -- THIRD RESTATEMENT TEST]{.underline}

a)  An actor who caries on an abnormally dangerous activity is subject to strict liability for physical harm resulting from the activity

b)  An activity is abnormally dangerous if:

    1)  The activity creates a foreseeable and highly significant risk of physical harm even when reasonable care is exercised by all actors, and;

    2)  The activity is not one of common usage.

*Rylands v. Fletcher* (p. 127-135) -- (defendant had a reservoir, unbeknownst to him, although known to contractors, there were mines under it, water ran into plaintiff's property) Strict liability applies the "non-natural use" of the defendant's land causes damage

*Brown v. Collins*. (D's horses had non-negligently escaped and injured P's land). Court rejects Rylands. Uses example of courts not holding people liable when fire spreads from their property and damages property of another. Only liable when damage is caused by D's negligence.

*Powell v. Fall*---(Spark from train set fire to hay on P's property. Train was not speeding/not negligent). Strict liability imposed for "dangerous activity."

*Spano v. Perini Corp* (p. 656) -- (defendant set off sticks of dynamite non-negligently, wrecked plaintiff's garage) Since blasting involves a substantial risk of harm no matter the degree of care exercised, a blaster is held to the strict liability standard.

*Indiana Harbor Belt R.R. v. American Cyanamid Co.* (p. 667) -- (defendant shipped railroad car filled with toxic chemical, on plaintiff's railroad workers noticed it was leaking, had to decontaminate area) When an accident is due to a lack of care and could have been prevented through the taking of reasonable care, such an accident is adequately deterred by the negligence standard and strict liability need not apply.

*Siegler v. Kuhlman* (p. 672) -- (gasoline transported on highways) Court defended using strict liability because the action posed extreme dangers and the likelihood that an accident would destroy cogent evidence from which negligence could be proved was high.

## DEFENSES

Strict liability only for the kind of harm whose risk makes the activity abnormally dangerous -- risks that are "characteristic" of the activity

- only strict liability if engaging in activity is a cause in fact AND a proximate cause of the harm the plaintiff suffered

- in some activities, plaintiffs are in a better position than defendants to make the activity-level and research calculations that strict liability induces

Defendant is not strictly if the harm in question results from:

(A) an Act of God

(B) unforeseeable intervention of a third party

(C) from the plaintiff's knowing and unreasonable assumption of the risk of harm

## NUISANCE

A nuisance is a substantial and unreasonable interference with the right of an owner or occupier of land to the use and enjoyment of the land.

- nuisance is distinct from trespass, which involves interference with the right of possession and occupancy of land

Standard of care

- defendant must be aware of the effect that its activities have on the plaintiff and then continue to conduct the activities

- nuisance is an activity resulting a particular kind of harm and that this interference may be actionable not only on the basis of intent, but also on a negligence or strict liability basis if the other preconditions to liability (fault or abnormal danger) are met

Public nuisance -- not a tort, but a species of low-level quasi-criminal offense that affects the general public in common

Private nuisance -- a tort, nuisance that affects particular individuals or entities

[When is an activity a nuisance?]{.underline}

Courts balance the equities when determining nuisance

- Substantial interference and unreasonable interference depends on factors like:

  - Nature of the neighborhood

  - Area in which the plaintiff and defendant occupy or use their properties

"Coming to the nuisance problem" --plaintiff erects a home where a factory has been and then alleges that the factory's emissions constitute a nuisance

- does not matter that the factory was there first

- factor owner is not necessarily behaving unreasonably but his interference with the plaintiffs' use is nonetheless unreasonable in the sense of being a greater interference than they should have to tolerate under the circumstances

[Remedial Alternatives]{.underline}

Court balances the equities not only at the liability stage but also at the remedial stage

- Considers various factors including:

  - Parties' respective faults

  - Hardship to the parties in respect of the continuance of the nuisance

  - The value of the activity that constitutes the nuisance to the surrounding community

Two Options

(1) Defendant may be ordered to pay the plaintiff damages for all past and future losses but may be permitted to continue the activity that constitutes the nuisance

(2) Defendant may be ordered to pay the plaintiff damages for all past losses and be enjoined from continuing the nuisance thereafter

Four Remedial Alternatives

(1) No Nuisance: Defendant Enjoins Plaintiff

    a.  Plaintiff is unsuccessful in his nuisance suit

        i.  Defnedant's activity thus limits the scope of the plaintiff's use and enjoyment of his land

    b.  Plaintiff can attempt to buy the right to interfere with enjoyment from the defendant

(2) Nuisance: Plaintiff Enjoins Defendant

    a.  Prevents the defendant from continuing the nuisance and the plaintiff is awarded damages for past losses

    b.  Plaintiff can sell this property right to the defendant

    c.  Courts need to be careful in multiple-plaintiff situations as the law cannot afford to make a mistake because the market in nuisance rights is unlikely to correct that mistake through a sale of rights because of the number of defendants and the "holdout" problem

(3) Nuisance: Defendant Compensates Plaintiff

    a.  Court determined that the social and economic costs of discontinuing the nuisance are greater than the cost that will result from permitting it to continue

    b.  The defendant is given the power here to decide whether to continue the nuisance or not pay compensation to the plaintiff

(4) Nuisance: Plaintiff Compensates Defendant

    a.  When the correct solution of the conflict is uncertain

    b.  Court concludes that the plaintiffs should be entitled to cause discontinuance of the nuisance only if doing so is worth it to them

        i.  Permit the plaintiff to compensate the defendant for the cost of discontinuing the nuisance

    c.  Example

        i.  Because developer had come to the nuisance, it should bear the cost of relocating the defendant's business

## VICARIOUS LIABILITY

**Vicarious liability** -- an employer is held liable for the torts committed by an employee within the scope of employment under the doctrine of *respondeat superior*

- Generally held liable for torts committed on a mere detour by the employee, but for those committed when the employee is on a frolic of his own

- May be liable for his own right for negligence in hiring or supervising the employee

  - Example: knows employee is a drunk driver but still hires him to drive his truck

- Employee is still liable for his action; employer is just added as an additional defendant

Who is an employee?

- Think about where strict liability will have the desired effects

- Electrician hired to do work in an apartment contracts with you but is not your employee, he's an independent contractor

  - You do not and could not control the manner in which he works to any great degree

- Employer usually is in a position to spread the cost of liability

When is a tort committed within the scope of employment?

- at some point the employer's capacity to control the conduct of employees and consequently the strength of the argument for imposing strict liability diminish

- "detour" vs. "frolic"

  - employer is liable for torts committed on a mere detour but not on frolics

  - Example: if you hire a truck driver to deliver a package and he drives a thousand miles west, not liable for accidents on that frolic

  - If he drives three blocks out of his way to visit his girlfriend, however, it is just a detour

- Hard cases arise when the employee is clearly on a frolic but the employer is in a good position to influence the conduct in question (See Bushey)

*Ira Bushey & Sons, Inc. v. United States* (p. 429) -- (drunken seaman left the valve on the drydock open when returning to shore, causing damage to the ship) Since drunken sailors are highly foreseeable, the court held that the tort was committed within the scope of employment

*Petrovich v. Share Health Plan of Illinois, Inc.* -- (plaintiff alleged that her HMO (Share) was liable for negligent medical care as it provided her with a handbook to choose a physician that referred to her physician as "your Share physician" repeatedly) An HMO can be vicariously liable for the negligence of its independent contractor physicians via apparent authority or implied authority. No vicarious liability exists for the actions of independent contractors, but doctrine of respondeat superior may be imposed for actions of independent contractors when an agency relationship is established under either the doctrine of apparent authority or implied authority

# PRODUCTS LIABILITY

*MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.* (p. 731) -- (plaintiff driving when wooden wheel cracked) When a manufacturer sells an object that would be foreseeably dangerous to a remote purchaser if constructed improperly, and the remote purchaser is harmed by object due to a manufacturing defect, the manufacturer is liable (even without privity of contract).

*Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc.* (p. 747) -- (While plaintiff used a power tool manufactured by defendant that was given to him by his wife, a piece of wood flew out, seriously injuring him) The tort side of product liability also gravitated toward strict liability, liability is not assumed by agreement (express or implied warranty), to establish liability, it is sufficient to prove that the plaintiff was injured while using the product in the way it was intended to be used, and as a result of a design or manufacturing defect that made the product unsafe for its intended use of which the plaintiff was not aware.

##  MANUFACTURING DEFECTS

**Manufacturing defect** -- a product does not conform to the manufacturer's own design

- A product with a manufacturing defect is different from others coming off the assembly line

- No need to show negligence, just need to show that the product departed from its intended design and that the departure caused the plaintiff's injury

**RTT defining manufacturing defect:**

A product contains a manufacturing defect when the product departs from its intended design even though all possible care was exercised in the preparation and marketing of the product

**Reasons for strict liability for manufacturing defects:**

1.  May produce more accurate results than negligence, since many manufacturing defects probably are the result of some hard-to-point negligence

2.  The manufacturer is in the superior position to conduct research and discover cost-effective methods of reducing the risk of harm resulting from manufacturing defects

3.  The manufacturer is generally in a better position to spread the cost of the defects that it is not cost-effective to eliminate

*Escola v. Coca Cola Bottling Co. of Fresno* (p. 739) -- (bottle exploded in waitress's hand) Concurring opinion -- a manufacturer should incur an absolute liability when an article that he placed o the market, knowing that it is to be used without inspection, proves to have a defect that causes injury to people. The manufacturers liability should be defined in terms of the safety of the product in normal and proper use, and should not extend to injuries that cannot be traced to the product as it reached the market

*Speller v. Sears, Roebuck, and Co.* (p. 773) -- (fire, both sides introduced evidence, more circumstantial evidence that defect in fridge caused fire) Even in an area where the governing principle is strict liability, the plaintiff still has the burden of proving causation. Although the plaintiff can rely on circumstantial evidence, it must be very powerful.

## DESIGN DEFECTS

**Design defects** -- a defect that occurs in an entire product line

- Unlike with manufacturing defects, there is no readily available standard against which to measure whether there was a defect in design

**RTT defining design defect:**

A product is defective in design when the foreseeable risks of harm posed by the product could have been reduced or avoided by the adoption of a reasonable alternative design by the seller or other distributor, or a predecessor in the commercial chain of distribution, and the omission of the alternative design renders the product not reasonably sale

- only discusses risk-utility, and makes alternative design necessary

**2 standards used for determining whether a design is defective:**

1.  **Risk-benefit/risk utility test** -- asks whether the risks posed by the design outweigh its benefits

    - This is the test that is more generally used

    - It is really a negligence test

    - In most courts foreseeability is required, but even without the requirement, very few risks of products are unforeseeable at the time of manufacture

2.  **Consumer expectation test** -- a design is defective if it is not as safe as reasonable consumers expect it to be

    - Problem with this test is that the consumer expectations test is not empirical (that would be impractical), and therefore, just seems to collapse into a less rigorous risk-utility test performed by the jurors

    - Courts apply it to simple product designs about which consumers could reasonably have expectations of safety

**Problems with the risk utility test:**

1.  In cases involving technical design choices for complex products, the test asks jurors to engage in a task for which they do not have the relevant expertise (and unlike in malpractice cases, there is no "respectable minority" rule to guide the task)

2.  Most products are the combination of many design choices regarding safety, cost, attractiveness, and functionality. Only one feature of the design is usually the cause of injury, generally, and therefore the risk-utility test is only applied to that feature. However, the real question ought to be how safely the product must be designed as a whole (especially since a range of safety is acceptable in most markets, and often price correlates with safety)

**Many courts, as well as RTT, require that a plaintiff prove not only that the risks of a particular design outweigh the benefits, but also that there was a reasonable alternative design that would have reduced the risks**

- Problems with this:

1.  Juries are not very well-suited to make the determination whether the alternative design is reasonable and feasible

2.  If there is no alternative design, a finding of liability is in effect a finding that the product should not have been sold at all

*Campo v. Scofield* (p. 777) -- Not liable for design defects when the machine functions properly for the purpose for which it was intended. The "open and obvious" defense applies.

*Micallef v. Mielhe Co.* (p. 787) -- (plaintiff tried to remove a foreign object from a high-speed printing press without shutting down the press) A machine could have a design defect even when the dangerous condition was open and obvious

- The "open and obvious" defense has been overruled in many jurisdictions (p. 211, A)

*Volkswagen of America, Inc. v. Young* (p. 779) -- (Plaintiff driving Beetle when it was hit by another car, caused the two front seats to become detached, causing a second collision) Foreseeability of risk generates duty. Collisions of cars are extremely foreseeable. Since collisions are a reasonably foreseeable use of a car, defectively designing the seats so that they would come apart during a collision constitutes negligence.

*Barker v. Lull Engineering Co.* (p. 788) --

1.  To constitute a design defect, must meet one of two requirements:

    a.  if the product failed to perform as safely as an ordinary consumer would expect when used in an intended or reasonably foreseeable manner

> *or*

b.  if the benefits of the challenged design do not outweigh the risk of danger inherent in such a design.

<!-- -->

2.  Once the plaintiff makes a prima facie showing that the injury was proximately cause by the product's design, the burden should appropriately shift to the defendant to prove that the product is not defective

*Linegar v. Armour of America* (p. 798) -- (defendant was shot wearing a bullet-proof vest that left space under the arms, which was where the bullet hit) When a safety device acts exactly as it should have acted, but does not protect from a specific type of injury due to inherent limitations (trade-off between range of movement and coverage), the maker of the device is not negligent for a design defect. Personal safety devices require personal choices.

*O'Brien v. Muskin Corp.* (p. 800) -- (plaintiff hurt while diving into an above-ground pool lined with vinyl, which is very slippery, all above ground pools are lined with that) It is not necessary for plaintiff to prove the existence of alternative, safer designs in a risk-utility test

- *Muskin* was altered by state statute -- cannot prove design defect without showing a practical and technically feasible alternative design

- RTT adopts approach that must show alternative design

*Potter v. Pneumatic Tool Co.* (p. 801) -- (plaintiff claimed using pneumatic hand tools manufactured by defendant caused permanent vascular and neurological impairments) Court rejected RTT approach, stated that may, but need not, prove an alternative design to prevail. (Court's test required interplay between consumer expectation and risk-utility)

*Haliday v. Sturn, Ruger & Co.* (p. 803) -- (boy shot himself with his father's handgun) In the jurisdiction in which this case was decided, the rule was that the test to be applied to gun injuries was the consumer expectation test and not a risk-utility test, unless the gun malfunctions. However, other jurisdictions urge a risk-utility test regardless of whether the gun malfunctioned (meaning, if there was a way to make the gun safer that was didn't detract from its utility or increase its cost prohibitively, the maker could be liable for design defect).

## DUTY TO WARN

Warning law occupies the area in which it is both feasible and normatively desirable to transfer risk-utility information to the purchaser and thereby to put the purchaser in a position to decide for himself whether the risks posed by a product design are worth its utility.

- the product seller is relieved of liability for harm caused

- the purchaser becomes the bearer of the risk of injury

**Adequacy of warning**

- what is required is an adequate warning or instruction, typically of foreseeable risks

- not truly "strict liability" because adequacy determinations inevitably take into account the feasibility and cost of providing a warning, as well as the kind of information that purchasers want and need

- PROBLEM: diminishing returns from providing additional information

  - "label clutter"

- JURY PROBLEM

  - Hard for the jury to internalize the label clutter issue; they may just conclude that the risk not disclosed to the plaintiff is the one additional risk about which there should have been a warning (or differently phrased)

- CAUSATION PROBLEM

  - Plaintiff needs to prove that they would have not used the product or used it in a different way if an adequate warning had to be given

    - Difficult to prove

  - Some courts have created a presumption that the plaintiff would have heeded an adequate warning if it had been given

**Warning/design defect connection** -- risks posed by some products outweigh their benefits when there is no warning or instructions, but are outweighed by their benefits when the product carries an adequate warning or instruction

- What about products that have no reasonable alternative yet whose risks might still outweigh benefits with adequate warning?

  - Split in jurisdictions, some courts have found that a product can be too dangerous to be on the market at all, while others have not

**RTT defining inadequate instructions or warning:**

A product is defective because of inadequate instructions or warnings when the foreseeable risks of harm posed by the product could have been reduced or avoided by the provision of reasonable instructions or warnings by the seller or other distributor, or a predecessor in the commercial chain of distribution, and the omission of the instructions or warnings renders the product not reasonably safe

**Duty to warn cannot totally displace mandatory products liability:**

1.  It is impossible to transmit to purchasers complete information about product risk and benefits

2.  There are some product designs that remain defective even after the consumer has been fully warned about them

- The duty to warn often comes into play with products that involve an "unavoidable risk" -- i.e. medications with certain unavoidable potential side effects, etc.

*MacDonald v. Ortho Pharmaeutical Corp.* (p. 807) -- (birth control pill listed "blood clot in the brain" as a potential side effect, but didn't use the word "stroke", plaintiff suffered a stroke from use of pill) The general rule is that manufacturers of medication do not owe a direct duty to the consumer to warn of dangers, they only owe the duty to warn to physicians or a responsible intermediary, who have a duty to warn the patient. However, oral contraceptives bear peculiar characteristics which warrant the imposition of a duty on the manufacturer to directly warn users:

1.  Patients are more actively involved in choosing to use the pill, since they are healthy and not taking it to cure an illness

2.  The pill is prescribed only after a single examination and is renewed on annual checkups, without opportunity for the patient to discuss concerns and questions with the physician in between.

3.  The pill is subject to federal regulation which requires that these drugs be furnished with written information telling of benefits and risks

*Perez v. Wyeth Laboratories*---Court imposed direct duty to warn on Wyeth b/c of its "massive advertising campaign" for birth control drug which was directed at women rather than at their doctors.

*McKee v. American Home Products Corp.*---Court refused to subject a pharmacist to the duties to warn normally imposed on prescribing physicians.

*Vassallo v. Baxter Healthcare Corp*. (p. 817) -- (plaintiff sued for lack of warnings given with silicone breast implants) Court rejects their current products liability law that makes a manufacturer liable regardless of whether the manufacturer knew of the risk at the time of manufacture. Adopts a "state of the art" standard -- a defendant will not be held liable for failure to warn about risks that were not reasonably foreseeable at the time of sale or could not have been discovered by way of reasonable testing prior to marketing the product. The manufacturer will be held to the standard of knowledge of an expert in the appropriate field.

*Hood v. Ryobi American Corp.* (p. 824) -- (saw contained many explicit warnings not to remove blade guards from the saw, plaintiff removed them, believing that the guards were intended solely to prevent contact with the saw, and was injured when the blade flew off the saw) To be considered adequate, a warning does not necessarily need to explain the consequences of improper use. A warning need only be one that is reasonable under the circumstances. Explaining all possible consequences can sometimes lead to label clutter.

*Liriano v. Hobart Corp.*---(P's hand was caught in commercial meat grinding machine from which his employer had removed the safety guard Unlike in *Hood*, no warning stating that it was dangerous to remove the guard). Duty to warn cause of action could survive even in cases where a product modification blocked liability under a design defect theory. Calabresi held that "jury could reasonably find that there exist people who are employed as meat grinders who do not know that it is feasible to reduce the risk with safety guards, that such guards are made available with grinders, and that grinders should be used only with the guards." (P was 17, recently migrated, and only worked there a week).

## PRODUCT LIABILITY DEFENSES

- Contributory or comparative negligence

- Assumption of risk (in comparative negligence states, it is not a complete defense but rather subsumed within comparative negligence)

- Product Misuse -- like using a rake to boost yourself up to a greater height

  - EXCEPTION: "foreseeable misuse" -- manufacturer remains liable

    - Example: kitchen knife as a screwdriver and the knife splinters

  - Exception can be countered by plaintiff's assumption of risk

    - Plaintiff knowingly and negligently takes the risk entailed by a foreseeable misuse and thus the manufacturer is not liable

  - Comes down to the question of who is the best bearer of the risk of injury

    - Liability for foreseeable misuses is best shouldered by the manufacturer or seller

    - Liability for unforeseeable misuses and for knowing and negligently encountered foreseeable misuses is best shouldered by the plaintiff

*Daly v. General Motors Corp.* (p. 832) --(In a car accident products liability case concerning a defective door lock, the decedent was not wearing a seatbelt) There is comparative negligence in products liability.

## STATUTORY PREEMPTION

When federal and state laws conflict, federal law "preempts" state law due to the Supremacy Clause of the USC.

- Question is whether through preemption the federal law creates a ceiling on the degree of safety that the state products liability law can require

- In absence of preemption, the federal law creates a floor or minimum standard

Preemption can either be express or implied

- depends on the interpretation of the particular federal statute or regulation whose meaning is at issue

- when implied, result depends on whether permitting state claims would be consistent with the purpose of the applicable federal statutory or regulatory regime

- whether a state law is preempted is thus a question of federal statutory or regulatory interpretation

  - how much national uniformity in product liability standards there should be

*Geier v. American Honda Motor Co.* (p. 843) -- (federal statute required auto manufacturers to equip some but not all of their vehicles with passive restraints, plaintiff injured in car accident, car didn't have air bags) The doctrine of implied preemption applies in three circumstances:

1.  When the state law is inconsistent with the federal statue

2.  When the federal statute is sufficiently comprehensive to occupy the field

3.  When the enforcement of the state law frustrates the federal scheme

*Wyeth v. Levine* -- (in response to an improper labeling claim, Wyeth claimed that VT law was preempted because it was in conflict with FDA order regarding drug labeling) Court held that FDA labeling requirements did not preempt a state failure-to-warn claim, rejected the manufacturer's arguments that it could not have modified its warning once the warning had been approved by the FDA and that a state law duty to provide a stronger warning would interfere with the purposes of the federal regulation -- held that the federal regulation could be though of as a floor and the state regulation could raise that floor

## LACK OF EXTENSION OF STRICT LIABILITY TO OTHER AREAS

*Hammontree v. Jenner* (p. 163) -- (defendant had seizure while driving, crashed into defendant's store) There is no strict liability in automobile accidents. If the driver who caused injury was not negligent, there is no recovery from the driver.

# DAMAGES

Awarding damages in tort cases performs at least three functions

(1) achieving corrective justice or providing civil recourse by compensating the plaintiff for losses resulting form the defendant's tortious act

(2) promoting deterrence by threatening defendants with liability for the costs resulting from the tortious acts

(3) recognizing the social and individual significant of the plaintiff's loss and confirming the weight of the defendant's responsibility for that loss

**Compensatory damages** -- damages to compensate for the losses proximately resulting from defendant's tortious act or omission

- successful plaintiff is entitled to be made "whole"

**Punitive damages** -- damages designed to punish the defendant, only awarded in exceptional cases

The Supreme Court has used three factors to evaluate the constitutionality of a punitive damages award:

1.  The degree of reprehensibility of defendant's act

2.  The disparity or proportion between the harm or potential harm resulting from the defendant's act and the amount of damages awarded -- cannot be more than nine times greater than compensatory damages

3.  The difference between this remedy and the civil or criminal penalties authorized to punish defendants in comparable factors

## PROPERTY CASES

**In property cases, the plaintiff can recover:**

1.  Losses proximately resulting from the defendant's action (loss in value of property or cost to repair, whichever is less

2.  Consequential losses (i.e. diminished profits)

- Currently, pain and suffering are not recoverable in property damage cases

## PERSONAL INJURY CASES

**In a personal injury case, the plaintiff can recover:**

1.  **"Special losses"** -- losses proximately resulting from the defendant's tortious action

2.  **"General losses"** -- damages for pain and suffering

**Four Functions of Pain and Suffering Awards:**

1.  It further acknowledges the wrong done to the plaintiff and that the plaintiff suffered intangible losses even if it does not correspond to actual pain because cannot put a price on that

2.  The plaintiff may be able to use the award to provide activities or enjoyments that substitute for those lost as a result of injury

3.  Achieving optimal deterrence

4.  Gives plaintiff money to pay contingency fees while remaining fully compensated

- Some courts have imposed ceilings on awards for pain and suffering -- sometimes, this compromises fairness for workability

*McDougald v. Garber* (p. 855) -- (plaintiff suffered severe brain damage and was left in a permanent comatose condition due to defendants' malpractice) (1) Some degree of cognitive awareness is a prerequisite to recovery for loss of enjoyment of life (2) A jury should not be instructed to consider and award damages for loss of enjoyment of life separately from damages for pain and suffering

**Single recovery** -- plaintiff only gets a single recovery, providing compensation for both past and future losses

- Because of this, awards for future losses are discounted to present value to avoid overcompensation. However, unless a jurisdiction has adopted uniform rules regarding the appropriate discount rate to be employed, all cases involve expert testimony about future inflation and the appropriate discount rate

**Advantage of single recovery** -- case does not go on forever, both plaintiff and defendant derive benefits from closure

**Disadvantages of single recovery:**

1.  Less accuracy

2.  Plaintiff must be a good investor

- There is no independent cause of action for losses that have not yet occurred

  - Small exception -- occasional award of costs of medical monitoring when a defendant has tortuously exposed the plaintiff to the risk of suffering future injury such as cancer.

**Collateral source rule** -- evidence of payments made or to be made to plaintiffs by collateral sources such as insurance is not admissible

- **prudence issue** -- in favor of the rule, should not be punished for acting prudently

- **double recovery issue** -- opposed to the rule, permits recovery twice

  - practically, double recovery is not as big an issue because of **subrogation**

- some courts have gotten rid of the collateral source rule

## DAMAGES IN WRONGFUL DEATH AND SURVIVAL ACTIONS

**Wrongful death action** -- new cause of action on the part of those who survive the decedent:

- **Beneficiaries** -- heirs at law

- **Measure of Damages** -- losses beneficiary suffered as a result of decedent's death (both economic and emotional loss)

- **Defenses** -- all defenses that defendant would have had against the decedent, and all those that he could have against the beneficiary can be invoked

Survival action -- preserves the deceased's cause of action

# AFFIRMATIVE AND LIMITED DUTIES

Duty -- the obligation to take some action or to refrain from taking some action

- question of law; it is for the court to decide, not the jury

List of factors that the courts take into account whose weight may vary enormously in a particular context:

(1) foreseeability of harm

(2) closeness of the connection between the defendant's conduct and the harm suffered by the plaintiff

(3) the moral blame attached to the defendant's conduct

(4) the extent of the burden on the defendant and the consequences for the community if a duty is imposed

(5) the policy of preventing future harm

(6) the availability and prevalence of insurance that is or would be available if a duty is imposed

## DUTY TO RESCUE

- Generally, there is **no affirmative duty to rescue**

  - Nonfeasance is not punished (unlike misfeasance)

**EXCEPTIONS**

- There is a duty to rescue when the **defendant negligently placed the plaintiff** in the position of danger

- Additionally, if there is a "**special relationship**" between the plaintiff and defendant, the defendant has a duty to rescue

  - i.e. common carriers, innkeepers, parents/custodians/babysitters

    - depends on whether the relationship involves:

      - dependence by the plaintiff on the defendant

      - defendant has waived its right to mind its own business and undertaken a duty to protect the plaintiff from harm

  - However, a mere relationship is not necessarily a "special" one (i.e. an owner of a recreational boat does not have a duty to rescue an acquaintance he brings on board)

- Even in the absence of a special relationship, courts have **sometimes** imposed liability on one who **non-negligently created the danger** (i.e. *Montgomery*)

- ***Tarasoff** v. Regents of University of California* (p. 634) -- (Man told therapist he planned to kill plaintiff, therapist notified police, neither police nor therapist told Tarasoff or her parents) When defendant specialist has a special relationship with either the wrongdoer or the plaintiff, and the defendant determines, or reasonably should have determined, that the wrongdoer poses a very major risk to the plaintiff, defendant has a duty to warn the plaintiff. Once a therapist does determine, or under the applicable professional standards reasonably should have determined, that a patient poses a serious danger of violence to others, he bears a duty to exercise reasonable care to protect the foreseeable victim of that danger.

  - Rule is **limited**

  - Applied only when a **patient** has expressed an **intention to injure a third party**

    - Applied in cases with a **specifically identified person** whose **safety is at risk**

*Buch v. Amory Manufacturing Co.* (p. 565) -- (boy trespassed in mill, machines posed danger to him, defendant didn't tell him to leave) There is no general affirmative duty to rescue. One does not have a duty to make a trespasser leave even if one knows that the trespasser is unknowingly in danger.

*Hurley v. Eddingfield* (p. 568) -- (Doctor refused to come without excuse, patient died) A license to practice medicine does not entail that the doctor must practice on any terms other than those he may choose to accept.

*Montgomery v. National Convoy & Trucking Co.* (p. 579) -- (defendant's truck stalled between two icy hills, didn't put up warning before first hill, plaintiff crashed) When the defendant creates the danger, even if she didn't do so through tortious activity, she has an affirmative duty to try to minimize the danger posed to others.

## ENABLING TORTS

Held liable in negligence for **harm foreseeably suffered** by tenants, students, or customers because of the **misconduct of third parties**

- landlord, universities, shopping centers, and other such proprietors of property

Special factors are usually present when the courts hold that the **property owner** has a **duty to the victim of a third party** who commits a tort on the premises

(1) **Pre-existing relationship** of some sort between the plaintiff and the defendant proprietor

(2) Circumstances that put the defendant proprietor **on notice of the risk of harm** to the plaintiff from third parties

    a.  Assaults in the hallways in the past, broken locks

(3) Defendants are **strategically placed to take precautions** reducing the risk that third parties will injure victims in the plaintiff's position

    a.  Precautions involve better locks , providing emergency telephones, using better lighting

(4) Primary wrongdoer is likely to be **judgment proof** or have limited assets whereas the enabling defendant is likely to have a **deep pocket** or be covered by a substantial amount of **liability insurance**

These factors are **not always determinative**

- **Firearm manufacturers** have no duty to shooting victims even when it is foreseeable that their sales will be distributed to illegal buyers

  - Hamilton v. Beretta

    - See below for five-factor test

- **Social host** has no duty to the victim of a guest's subsequent negligent driving even if he **served alcohol to a drunk guest** and knew he would drive after

- **Electric utility** has no duty to the tenant of an apartment building when the tenant is injured in the dark because of the allegedly negligent failure of the utility to provide the building electricity

*Hamilton v. Beretta*---On appeal court finds no duty. (Negligent marketing as potential new tort---Hamilton won in district court). Fair amount of foreseeability, but that's not enough. Indetermininate defendants/proximate cause issues (would need to be market share liability like DES cases).

- **Five factor test**: reasonable expectations of parties and society generally, the proliferation of claims, the likelihood of unlimited or insurer-like liability, disproportionate risk and reparation allocation, and public policies affecting the expansion or limitation of new channels of liability

*Kline v. 1500 Massachusetts Avenue Apartment Corp.* (p. 624) -- (Plaintiff robbed and raped in hall of building, had been a significant decrease in security in building since signed lease and a few months before incident another female tenant had been attacked in same hallway) When the ability of one of the parties to provide for his own protection has been limited in some way by his submission to the control of the other, a duty is imposed upon the one possessing control to take reasonable precautions to protect the other one from assault by third parties which, at least, could reasonably have been anticipated.

## DUTIES OF OWNERS AND OCCUPIERS

**Three categories of people who enter other people's premises:**

1.  **Invitee** -- occupier has duty of taking reasonable care that the premises are safe

    a.  Business purposes, for the benefit of the owners

2.  **Licensee** -- occupier only has duty to disclose concealed dangers about which occupier knows but does not need to eliminate those conditions

    a.  Most states, social guests are licensees

3.  **Trespasser** -- comes at own risk, occupier only liable when the injury is due to a willful act, an act done with the deliberate intention of doing harm to trespassers, or an act done with reckless disregard

    a.  In many states, discovered trespassers are owed reasonable care

    b.  Children who may trespass because of an attractive nuisance are owed reasonable care (especially when danger can be eliminated at a low cost)

*Robert Addie & Sons (Collieries), Ltd. v. Dumbreck* (p. 584) -- (defendants put up some warnings for children to stay out of the field with haulage system but knew their warnings were often ignored, little boy was killed) Because there were warnings and adults were warned to keep children out, the child in this case fell into the category of trespasser, and therefore, the occupier did not even have the duty to protect him from concealed danger.

*Rowland v. Christian* (p. 593) -- (Plaintiff was injured by the broken faucet in defendant's house) Categories do not determine standard of care owed. Standard of care and liability should depend on the foreseeability of harm, the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury, the closeness of the connection between the defendant's conduct and the injury suffered, the moral blame attached to the defendant's conduct, the policy of preventing future harm, the extent of the burden imposed upon the defendant and consequences to the community of imposing the duty, availability, cost, and prevalence of insurance for the risk involved.

**4 different approaches that states have adopted:**

1.  Retained traditional tripartite division -- most common approach

2.  *Rowland v. Christian* approach

3.  View categories as evidentiary but not dispositive

4.  Only distinguish between trespassers and non-trespassers

5.  RTT -- flagrant trespassers (burglars) are owed a limited duty but non-flagrant trespassers (tries to find bathroom in construction zone) are given reasonable care

## ATTRACTIVE NUISANCE

Allows infant trespassers to recover when lured onto defendant's premises by some tempting condition created and maintained by the defendant

- Examples: railway turntables, explosives, electrical conduits, smoldering fires, and rickety structures

Exposure limited, as the case law tends to exclude "rivers, creeks, ponds, wagons, axes, plows, woodpiles, haystacks." Franich v. Great Northern Ry.

Sioux County & Pacific R.R. v. Stout -- (six year old child's foot was caught while playing on friends on a turntable) Supreme Court allowed the plaintiff to recover, holding that defendant omitted care and attention to prevent occurrence of accidents that ordinary men would foresee like this one.

**Second Restatement Test** -- stricter standard than Stout (3^rd^ restatement changed it to flagrant trespassers vs. non-flagrant (children included) trespassers)

- A possessor of land is subject to liability for physical harm to children trespassing thereon caused by an artificial condition upon the land if:

  - the place where the condition exists is one upon which the possessor knows or has reason to know that children are likely to trespass, and

  - the condition is one of which the possessor knows or has reason to know and which he realizes or should realize will involve an unreasonable risk of death or serious bodily harm to such children, and

  - the children because of their youth do not discover the condition or realize the risk involved in intermeddling with it or in coming within the area made dangerous by it, and

  - the utility to the possessor of maintaining the condition and the burden of eliminating the danger are slight as compared with the risk to children involved, and

  - the possessor fails to exercise reasonable care to eliminate the danger or otherwise to protect the children

## NEGLIGENT EMOTIONAL DISTRESS: PURE EMOTIONAL LOSS

- In general, there is no cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress unrelated to physical injury or threat of physical injury, although there are two traditional exceptions and several modern extensions

  - Defendant negligently mishandles the corpse of a loved one

  - Defendant negligently sends a telegram to the plaintiff that incorrectly announces the death of a loved one (doesn't really apply since there are no more telegrams)

  - Defendant negligently conveys important information

    - Physician who misinforms the plaintiff

    - Spouse of the plaintiff, that he has a STD

  - Where defendant is in a position of power or authority over the plaintiff such a duty also exists

    - Hospital with custody of a newborn infant that allows it to be kidnapped

**Zone of Impact rule** -- permitted recovery only if the defendant's conduct resulted in some physical impact on the plaintiff's body

- also sometimes required that the emotional distress manifest itself in physical symptoms

**Zone of Danger rule** -- less stringent than Zone of Impact rule, allowed recovery if the plaintiff was in the "zone" in which physical injury was threatened and feared for her own safety

- Like with Zone of Impact, some courts required that the emotional distress manifest itself in physical symptoms

- Was relaxed in a number of courts to allow recovery when the emotional loss resulted party from fear that another person in the zone (such as one's child) would be physically injured

**Dillon rule** -- Plaintiff need not have been in the zone of danger and therefore need not have feared for her own safety in order to recover for her loss; need only to take into account three factors:

1.  whether the plaintiff was located near the scene of the accident as contrasted with one who was a distance from it

2.  Whether the shock resulted from a direct emotional impact upon plaintiff from the sensory and contemporaneous observance of the accident, as contrasted with learning of the accident from others after its occurrence

3.  Whether plaintiff and the victim were closely related, as contrasted with an absence of any relationship or the presence of only a distant relationship

- The greater these three factors, the greater the foreseeability of emotional harm to the plaintiff and the stronger the argument was for recovery of emotional loss

**Fear of future injury** -- defendant has negligently exposed the plaintiff to the risk of suffering future injury (such as cancer)

- some courts permit the plaintiff (under limited circumstances) to recover damages resulting from fearing future injury

  - there is usually actual impact (like asbestos fibres or contaminated drinking water)

  - in others, no actual impact but exposure to x-rays or other energy

  - defendant would be liable for the actual injury that the plaintiff fears will occur in the future, when and if it occurs

- many courts do not permit recovery for fear of future injury, even if it is inconsistent with allowing people to recover for pure emotional harm

  - in pure emotional harm, it is fear of an injury that did not happen; here, it is fear of an injury that may happen

*Mitchell v. Rochester Railway* (p. 549) -- (Defendant's horses came very close to plaintiff, causing her to become unconscious, to have a miscarriage, and suffer consequent illness) A plaintiff cannot recover for injuries occasioned by fright, since there is no immediate injury. Thus, a plaintiff cannot recover for physical consequences resulting from fright.

*Dillon v. Legg* (p. 553) -- (defendant driver killed child, mother and sister sued for emotional and physical suffering) The court rejects zone of danger as test for finding liable for emotional distress and states that foreseeability is the primary element in determining whether the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty. The courts will take into account factors mentioned earlier.

*Thing v. La Chusa* (p. 558) -- (mother did not witness accident that injured her child) -- rejected Dillon's assertion that foreseeability is the touchstone of duty, opted for bright-line rue of requiring that witness accident to recover

**[PURE ECONOMIC LOSS]{.underline}**

 

Physical injury to the person or property of one party also results in purely economic harm to another party

-       latter party's losses are not parasitic on any bodily injury or property damage that he suffered

 

**Economic loss rule **(traditional answer) -- deny such recovery outright

- there has been only very modest evolution away from the bright-line rule denying recovery

  - natural resource damage for which no party seems to have a cause of action

    - liability for economic loss is a kind of substitute for a cause of action for physical damage to natural resources

    - What influenced the court is probably (A) no proper plaintiff and (B) defendant was a sufficiently large enterprise

    - recovery permitted by commercial fishermen but denied to seafood sellers

  - in other cases, the defendant's negligence is determined by reference to the reasonableness of the defendant's also having risked some other kind of harm (usually physical harm) either to the plaintiff or the third party

    - specific parties threatened in this case

[Why such limited recovery?]{.underline}

(1) Amount of liability that could result could be enormous and its scope would be very difficult to predict -\> insurance impossible to get

(2) Defendant is already probably threatened with substantial liability for bodily injury or property damage

(3) Third-party economic losses are distributed among large numbers of people

(4) Economic losses resulting from an act of negligence could spread far and wide; something that affects me could affect someone who relies on me and someone who relies on them -- where do you cut it off?

## GRATUITOUS UNDERTAKINGS

*Coggs v. Bernard* (p. 606) -- When a person undertakes to carry goods, and through his negligence the goods get damaged, he is liable for negligence

*Erie Railroad Co. v. Stewart* (p. 609) -- (Railroad established practice of having guards at station but then stopped, plaintiff, not seeing guard, though it was safe to cross) Once a practice is established, owes a duty of care to passengers if it stops the practice if the passenger relied on the practice. Concurring Opinion -- Whether the plaintiff knew or not of the practice of the defendant concerning customs should not factor into calculation of whether defendant had duty to the plaintiff.

*Marsalis v. LaSalle* (p. 612) -- (After defendant's cat scratched plaintiff, plaintiff asked defendant to confine cat for a certain period of time to make sure it didn't have rabies, defendant was negligent and cat escaped, plaintiff had to undergo rabies treatment, subsequently found out didn't have rabies) One who voluntarily undertakes to care for, or to afford relief or assistance to, an ill, injured, or helpless person is under a legal obligation to use reasonable care and prudence in doing so.

*Moch Co. v. Rensselaer Water Co.* (p. 615) -- (Water company contracted with city to supply water for public areas, building caught fire, spread to plaintiff's warehouse, defendant was notified of the fire but did not supply adequate water to prevent destruction of warehouse even though contract provided for adequate supply).

1.  Not maintainable as breach of contract, since the plaintiff is a third part, and one must show that a benefit to a third party is not merely incident and secondary in order for the third party to have a right of action. The field of obligation would extend beyond reasonable limits if less were demanded as a condition for liability.

2.  Not maintainable as a common-law tort, since Cardozo seems to distinguish between misfeasance and nonfeasance. He states that the question is whether the wrongdoer had advanced to such a point as to have launched a force or instrument of harm, or has stopped where inaction is at most a refusal to become an instrument for good. If the zone of duty were to be extended, everyone making a promise having the quality of a contract would have a duty apart from the contract to an indefinite number of beneficiaries when performance has begun.

3.  Not maintainable as breach of statute, since the statutes don't require the enlargement of the zone of liability. The breach of duty can only be to the one to whom serviced is denied.
