Pros/Cons

**Rules**

- Pros:

<!-- -->

- Clear

- Same for everyone (could also be a con)

- easy to administer

<!-- -->

- Cons:

<!-- -->

- Less information

<!-- -->

- Who decides?

  - Judge

<!-- -->

- ***Goodman*** (1927) \[Holmes\]

**Standards**

- Pros:

<!-- -->

- More information

- Flexible/can meet more situations; adaptable

- Responsive to (developing) values

<!-- -->

- Cons:

<!-- -->

- Room for discretion and bias

- Room for mistakes/results may vary

<!-- -->

- Who decides

  - Jury / Factfinder

  <!-- -->

  - **Pokora** (1934) \[Cardozo\]

<!-- -->

- When do you switch regimes?

- How much tailoring do you do? (How do you tailor?)

**[Who decides?]{.mark}**

- Judges v. juries

- Courts v. legislatures

- Q: Institutional competencies, trust, information?

**[Aims of tort law]{.mark}**

- Deterrence v. compensation

- Fairness v. blameworthiness

- Risk-spreading and social welfare

- Remember for policy questions, especially

**[Moral Luck]{.mark}**

**Two Simultaneous Causes: One Negligent, One Not**

- Most courts do not hold either party negligent under MSC

- N party gets off due to "moral luck"; rationale is that the harm would have happened anyway because of non-negligent party

**[Statutes]{.mark}**

- Common Law uses statutes to determine breach

- Common law uses statutes to determine duty

- CL uses statute to determine damages

- Statutes incorporate CL (BP, FTCA)

- Federal statutes can preempt state CL

**[Big theories of tort law]{.mark}**

**Cheapest Cost Avoider**

**Coase Theorem** (remember transaction costs)

[**BIG QUESTIONS**:]{.mark}

- Is this the right outcome?

- If you don't think this is the right outcome, how do you use the law to change it?

**[2. DUTY]{.mark}**

**[Reasonable care under the circumstances]{.mark}**

You always have this whenever you take any action

- For this reason, duty is usually not an issue (in Breach cases)

- **Duty is a question of law**

**[Reasonable care when you initiate [no]{.underline} action]{.mark}**

**[Affirmative duty]{.mark}**,

- **[[Cuyler]{.underline}]{.mark}** (7^th^ Cir. 2004)

  - Statute did not impose a duty

- **Act or omission**? **[[Moch]{.underline}]{.mark}**

<!-- -->

- **Act=duty**

  - **Misfeasance**

  - Affirmative actions

  - Hand set to task

- **Omissions=No Duty**

  - **Nonfeasance**

  - Withholding a benefit

  - Hand not applied

<!-- -->

- Nonfeasance🡪misfeasance

  - 1\. Rhetorical: "actively omitted"

  - 2\. Earlier act created the risk

  - 3\. Earlier act created reliance (under-taking a rescue)

<!-- -->

- **Rescue**

<!-- -->

- In the absence of special circumstances or special relationship, one has no affirmative duty to rescue another person from a position of danger

- **Exceptions:**

<!-- -->

- **N place person in danger**

  - **Undertake a rescue**

**[Duty to warn]{.mark}**

**[Products liability]{.mark}**

[[Hood v. Ryobi ;]{.underline}]{.mark} Blade flew off saw

- **Label clutter**

- **Inherently dangerous products:** consumer assumes the risk

**[Informed consent]{.mark},**

- Physician to inform the patient of the risks of a particular medical treatment so that the patient may decide whether to take the risks or not

- **Reasonable-Patient Standard**

- **Reasonable-Physician Standard**

**[Special relationships]{.mark}**,

- **Common carriers and innkeepers** have such a relationship to their customers

- Parents and custodians such as child-care professionals (and probably babysitters)

**[[Tarasoff]{.underline}]{.mark}**

- Court found psychiatrist had a duty to warn police about his patient's threat to the third party

**[Statute can create a tort duty]{.mark}** **(federal preemption),**

- [[Stengel v. Medtronic]{.underline}]{.mark}

**[Strict Liability]{.mark},**

- **Animals**

  - [[Doerr]{.underline}]{.mark} case

  - [Horse]{.underline} cases

  - Vicious + owner knows it is vicious=S.L

- **Land use**

  - [[Rylands v. Fletcher]{.underline}]{.mark}

- **Abnormally dangerous activity**, **p. 52 RN**

  - Keeping a tiger in your backyard=SL

- **Restatement 3^rd^**:

<!-- -->

- \(1\) Foreseeable and highly significant risk even when reasonable care is exercised, **and**

- \(2\) Not of common usage

<!-- -->

- **List of factors from** **Restatement 2^nd,\ ^**

  - 1\. Risk

  - 2\. Harm

  - 3\. Cannot be avoided by due care

  - 4\. Common

  - 5\. Inappropriate activity

  - 6\. Value to community

<!-- -->

- Posner thinks that factor 3 is most critical🡪

- If harm could be avoided by due care then N works and there is no reason to apply SL

  - **[[American Cyanamid]{.underline}]{.mark}**

<!-- -->

- **Don\'t need to show [[breach]{.underline}]{.mark}**

- **[[Proximate cause]{.underline}]{.mark}** and SL

<!-- -->

- Is this risk the reason we made it SL in the first place

  - Yes=PC

  - NO=NO PC

**[Policy: Negligence v. SL]{.mark}**

- Levels of care vs. levels of activity

**[3. BREACH]{.mark}**

**[Negligence]{.mark}**: failure to take care that a reasonable person would under the circumstances (always have this duty)

**[Method:]{.mark}**

- Always start with identifying the negligent action

- Each action gets its own analysis (breach and causation)

**[Standard: B\>P\*L]{.mark},**

- **Burden:** costs to ∆

- **Probability** of accident

<!-- -->

- Must be the foreseeable probability not the *real* probability (to whom?)

- Total probability or only the increased probability

<!-- -->

- **Loss**

<!-- -->

- For who?

<!-- -->

- Must be *foreseeable* loss

<!-- -->

- **Competing Aims**

<!-- -->

- **Deterrence:** predictable

- **Morals: "**Golden" Rule

- **Risk Spreading**

<!-- -->

- **Shortcomings**

<!-- -->

- Measurement / information costs can be high

<!-- -->

- Commensurability (\$): placing \$ value on life; pain and suffering

**[The Reasonable Person]{.mark},**

- **Objective:** "What the reasonable person would have done under the circumstances?

<!-- -->

- A standard to test/compare ∆ against

- What we think the ∆ ***should*** have done

<!-- -->

- **Subjective:** Where do circumstances end and ∆'s personal characteristics begin?

<!-- -->

- ***[Cleggs]{.mark}:*** 20-year woman a circumstance or personal characteristic?

- ***[Tankersley]{.mark}:*** Woman in female attire a circumstance or characteristic?

  - **Takeaways:**

  - 1\. You can use proxies for sex to make same arguments

  - 2\. : π's circumstances / characteristics are objective to ∆;

<!-- -->

- Ex. in ***Cleggs*** we can take into account π's age/gender when considering whether he was contributory negligent.

**[The Reasonable Who?]{.mark},**

**Age**

- **Adult---Minor** Bright line

<!-- -->

- \>18: *ordinary care standard*

- \<18: *semi-objective standard* considers age, mental capacity, experience

  - "adult" activities will move minor up to adult standard; ex. driving; varies w/J)

<!-- -->

- **Children** 4/5/6/7 (depending on J)=

<!-- -->

- No liability; bright line

**Mental/Physical Infirmities**

- **Mental**---ordinary "reasonable person" standard applies

- **Physical**---semi-objective standard

**"Superior" attributes**

- ∆ must exercise such "superior" attributes as the "actor himself has" (higher standard than reasonable person); asymmetry

**Utmost Care or Ordinary Care**

- *Groh* (Kan. 2000): Guns are held under utmost care.

**Emergency**

- Ordinary Care Standard

- Jury could take emergency circumstances into account, but that the standard should remain "reasonable" under the circumstances.

**[External Standards]{.mark} (Matter of Law)**

[[**Statutes**:]{.underline}]{.mark} \[Per se N\],

- **If I fail to meet=N per se**

  - **[[Martin v. Herzog:]{.underline}]{.mark}** Buggy was contributory N for violating statute requiring lights at night

<!-- -->

- **Unless:** (1) excuse: **safer not to follow**; **or**

<!-- -->

- **[[Tedla v. Ellman]{.mark}:]{.underline}** Walking on the wrong side of the road was safer; not per se N

<!-- -->

- **(2) Not the purpose of statute**

  - **[[Gorris v. Scott]{.underline}:]{.mark}** Sheep fell overboard

<!-- -->

- **If I comply with**=Do not necessarily escape liability;

  - Statute is minimum standard

**[[Customs]{.mark},]{.underline}**

- **If I fail to meet**=Evidence (relevant) for π

- **If I comply**=Evidence for ∆

  - **[[TJ Hooper]{.underline}]{.mark}**: Tug boat radio use

  - To show whether standard is custom: Expert witnesses from industry

[**[Malpractice]{.underline}**,]{.mark}

- **If I Fail to meet**=N per se

- **If I comply**=Not N; not liable

<!-- -->

- **National** Medical Standards determine N,

<!-- -->

- **[Sheeley:]{.mark}** Abandoned Similar Locality Rule

- Unless🡪

<!-- -->

- **Common knowledge**

  - Medical malpractice that is so blatant as to not need expert testimony to establish medical standard; ex. Operated on the wrong leg.

- **Two schools of thought**

  - "Reputable minority": if doctor followed the standard of this view she is not be liable

**[Gross Negligence]{.mark},**

Subjective intent?

- [Government]{.underline}: **Objective standard**: "gross N is an extreme departure from the care required under the circumstances or a failure to exercise even slight care."

- [BP]{.underline}: **Objective *and* subjective standard** that requires an objectively "extreme departure from the ordinary standard of care" *and* a subjectively "culpable mental state." (intent)

<!-- -->

- BP Case chooses Government's def.; easier to find gross N without having to find **intent**

**[Contributory/Comparative negligence]{.mark}** (of π),

- **Contributory:** all or nothing

- "**Pure" comparative**: recovery damages pro rata

<!-- -->

- **"Hybrid" comparative**: if P\>50% negligent, no recovery

- **[[Li v. Yellow Cab]{.underline}]{.mark} (**Cal. 1975)

**[4. CAUSATION]{.mark}**

**[1. Factual Causation (CIF)]{.mark},**

**Need to find 1. CIF and 2. Proximate Cause**

**[But for Causation]{.mark}**

- Driving without your lights on at night and crash into house; **but for** your not having your lights off you would not have caused harm.

- **But-for cause** can be over-inclusive and under-inclusive🡪MSC, MNC

**[Multiple Sufficient Causes]{.mark}**

- Would not be But-for because injury would still happen

- One fire alone would have been sufficient to burn down house. The but-for test does not work because you cannot say that but-for one of the tortfeasor's fire, the house would not have burned down (since it would have burned down anyway)

**[Multiple Necessary Causes]{.mark}**

- Multiple people had to come together to cause tort

- One fire alone would not have been sufficient to cause the harm, and both fires were necessary. Neither are but-for causes (since but-for the fire there still needed to be another fire to bring down the house.)

**["Joint" Tortfeasors]{.mark}**

- Jointly agreeing to do this together;

- **Joint conduct tort** or

- **Indivisible harm**

<!-- -->

- A negligently starts one fire; B negligently starts a separate fire; both converge and burn house; each one alone would have burned down the house; cannot figure which fire caused what amount of harm

**[Sequential Causes: Pre-emptive Causation]{.mark}**

- Neither party is a but-for cause, but the first to do the harm was the actual physical cause of the harm---first party's harm was **"Preemptive Cause"**

<!-- -->

- First party is liable if negligent, and second party is not responsible even if negligent

**[Proof problems]{.mark}**

- 1\. Preponderance of the evidence standard?

- **[Alternative Liability]{.mark}**: two people and you do not know who did it; but know one of them did

<!-- -->

- **[[Summers v. Tice]{.underline}]{.mark}**; burden shifts on the ∆ to show who did not do it,

<!-- -->

- **[Market Share Liability]{.mark},**

<!-- -->

- [[**Sindell** v. Abbott Laboratories]{.underline}]{.mark}

<!-- -->

- **"Signature disease":** no other known cause possible

- ∆ companies are liable to π for % of their **national market share** at the time the pills were marketed/sold

- **Companies can exculpate** themselves only with evidence that it did not market for pregnant women

- π bears risk that there were other companies in the market at the time that no longer exist

<!-- -->

- **Rationale**: we know all the companies are responsible for *some* harm *somewhere*;

**[Harm: lost chance]{.mark},**

- Cancer patient who cant show but-for causation; harm is defined as lost chance of survival than death; physician is liable for N misdiagnosis, treatment, etc.

- **[[Matsuyama]{.underline}]{.mark}**

<!-- -->

- Facts: (Due to Birnbaum's negligence, Matsuyama's cancer was not discovered when he still would have had a chance for survival).

<!-- -->

- **Loss of chance** doctrine has so far been largely limited to medical malpractice cases (though Huang says you can imagine a lot of other possibilities).

<!-- -->

- **Risk creation:** the point is not that you would have survived but-for negligent act, the point is that you lost some chance at it

**[Allocation of Damages,]{.mark}**

- **Joint and Several**

<!-- -->

- ∆'s are responsible for the portion of harm they caused only; π can still sue one ∆ for the entire 100%; this ∆ can recover from his co-defendants but only for the % for which they are responsible. ∆ bears risk that another ∆ is judgment proof.

<!-- -->

- **Several:**

<!-- -->

- ∆ is only liable for his own % of harm; π must sue each one individually and separately to recover total amount; **π bears the risk that a ∆ is judgment proof**

**[2. Proximate Cause]{.mark}**

- **["Scope of the risk"]{.mark}**

<!-- -->

- Harm within the risk (why is this action tortious? If harm that occurred is within set of bad results than it is within the scope of risk)

<!-- -->

- Ex. Bartender serves too many drinks to a patron who then crashes

<!-- -->

- **Bartender N a Proximate Cause:** If patron crashes by skidding on the road-this is foreseeable result from the risk of bartender giving him too many drinks

- **Bartender N act NOT a proximate cause:** If patron is driving and has a tree fall on him\-\--this is not foreseeable risk

**[Pertinent Considerations]{.mark}**

**[Foreseeable:]{.mark},**

**1. Type of Harm**:

- Usually breaks the chain of causation; **∆ wins; not liable**

<!-- -->

- **[[Wagon Mound]{.underline}]{.mark}**

- **[Ex.]{.underline} Restatement §29**: man negligently hands girl a shotgun and it falls on her foot causing her injury---this is an unforeseeable type of harm; man is not liable

**2. Manner of Harm**:

- Usually does not break the chain of causation; **π wins, ∆ liable**

<!-- -->

- Same type of harm but manner is different:

- Ex. Car accident making someone get out of car and get hit: **[[Marshall v. Nugent]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**3. Unforeseeable π**

- Usually does break chain; **∆ wins; not liable**

<!-- -->

- **[[Palsgraf]{.underline}]{.mark}** (N.Y. 1928): Cardozo held that the ∆ RR had not breached its duty to P, because harm to her was not a foreseeable risk of what D had done. Thus, the RR was not negligent *[in relation]{.underline}* to her.

**4. Extent Harm**

- Does not break chain of causation usually; **∆ liable**

<!-- -->

- **"Thin skull" rule**; "take your victim how you find him

**[Intervening Cause]{.mark}** (Maybe),

- Bartender N'ingly over-serves patron so his friend drives him home, but his friend is a terrible driver and gets into car accident

<!-- -->

- Friend is intervening cause if: **Destroys the causal connection** between ∆'s negligence and the injury. It must be the **immediate and sole cause** of the injury. It must so **completely supersede** the operation of ∆'s (bartender's) N that it caused the injury without ∆'s negligence contributing to it in any material way.

- **If it was N for ∆** (bartender) **not to foresee** the N of the intervening cause (friend driver), ∆ bartender is liable---causal link is not broken

**[Takeaways:]{.mark}**

- Make relevant arguments; they are not set in stone

- Weird facts---Proximate cause?

**[5. Property Torts]{.mark}**

**Intentional Trespass,**

- **Intent**

<!-- -->

- Just means **physical intent**; does not matter if you were mistaken and "intended" to enter your own land.

<!-- -->

- **Entry on another person's land**

- **No need to show harm**

<!-- -->

- **Unintentional trespass:** unintended intrusions resulting from reckless or N conduct or from abnormally dangerous activities will be subject to liability **only if the intrusion causes actual harm**

<!-- -->

- [[Martin v. Reynolds Metals]{.underline}]{.mark} (OR 1959): modern trespass, p. 53 RN

**[Necessity exception]{.mark},**

- **Public Necessity:** arises when there is a **risk to the property of a sufficiently large number of people** and that risk can be reduced or eliminated by damaging or destroying the property of the plaintiff

- **[Private Necessity]{.mark}** arises when there is a **risk to one party or his property only and** this party can reduce or eliminate that risk by damaging or destroying someone else's property;

<!-- -->

- [[**Ploof** v. Putnam**,**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Vt. 1908)**,** pp. 957-958 **Facts:** π were sailing when a sudden storm forced them to tie up at the ∆s dock. ∆ untied the ship causing the boat and its contents to be destroyed, and injuring the π. ∆ liable to π claiming private necessity

<!-- -->

- It is a **conditional privilege** because it is only qualified and the ∆ is liable to the π for the damage done to π's property.

<!-- -->

- [[**Vincent** v. Lake Erie]{.underline}]{.mark}, (Minn. 1910), pp. 958-960 **Facts:** Storm arose; it would have been too dangerous for ∆ to leave the dock during the storm so ∆ kept his ship moored to the dock; as the mooring lines parted or chafed the ∆ replaced them to keep his ship to dock; π sued for the damage that resulted; ∆ claiming private necessity liable

**[Nuisance]{.mark},**

- Unreasonable and substantial interference with a person's **use and enjoyment of their real property**

- **Need to show injury/harm** for Intentional N and unintentional N

**Restatement §822:** can be liable for conduct that is a legal invasion of another's interest in the private use and enjoyment of land **if the invasion is either:**

- **(a) Intentional [and]{.underline} unreasonable** or (b): Unintentional and arising out of N or reckless conduct or abnormally dangerous conditions or activities

[**§826:** **Intentional nuisance**]{.mark} [satisfies the **"unreasonableness"**]{.mark} requirement **if**:

- **(a)** The **gravity of the harm** \> **utility of the actor's conduct**

- **or**

- **§829A** = whenever the harm caused is both substantial and greater than the π "should be required to bear without compensation" = gravity\>utility; equity trump card

**826(b) [[Bloomer]{.mark}]{.underline} exception**---harm is serious and financial burden court imposes would not force ∆ to stop---just make the ∆ pay for it

**General Tips**

1\. Quality of writing matters---do not just spill out everything

Easier to read---the better

Clear/organized

2\. Know your professor

know what kinds of exams they give/see what they value

know what they emphasize in class

3\. Know how professor thinks

get inside their head

Huang argues both sides

**Rules of thumb**

1\. Read the instructions over and over again

2\. Save time for the later questions---read both first

3\. Not about the answer/about the arguments-looking for sophistication

4\. Every sentence should be using some fact
