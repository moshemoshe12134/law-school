**Torts Outline- Huang**

**Fall 2015**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Big Concepts**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**[(Competing) Aims of Tort Law]{.underline}**

**1. Corrective Justice (Social- Backward/P-D)**

\- Restore moral balance

\- Justifies imposition of liability even when unintentional harm

\- As the connection between the injurer and victim becomes less direct, corrective justice seems less relevant. If insurance pays injured or if the loss is born by shareholders, employees, customers (corporation is the injurer) more removed. Question of importance in these settings.

\- Say compensation meets this

**2. Deterrence (Economic-Forward)- Optimal or Complete**

\- The court never decides the right amount or type of deterrence

\- Helps prevent future tortious actions by threatening potential wrongdoers with liability if they cause actionable harm.

\- Not all risky activity is worth deterring or we'd have to take endless precautions

\-*Optimal* deterrence (right amount)- deter *excessively* risky activity so that only losses worth avoiding are avoided; risk other hams because the precaution costs are not worth the possible harm (losses not worth avoiding)

\- Internalizing your harms against other people; you break, you pay.

> \- Example: Deciding not to speed on the highway on a regular stroll on a Sunday v. deciding to speed when your friend is bleeding out going to hospital (Laws probably promote optimal deterrence here)
>
> \- Based on harm to plaintiff

\- CONS- It doesn't dictate what values should be taken into account in determining which losses are worth/aren't worth deterring (may ignore important human values); monetization of personal injury (pain and suffering).

\- Counterargument: should take economic risk to some point when considering social risks.

\- *Complete/Absolute* deterrence (stop altogether):

\- We take away all of your gains, so you don't take a shortcut- Based on gains to defendant

\- Nothing here makes reference to harm, it's defendant-focused damages

**3. Fairness/Blameworthiness (Between the parties)**

**-** Think of this as between the parties; PL's role and D's role

\- Or just among society (what's fair to society as a whole?)

\- Someone shouldn't be held liable if they have no blame in it happening (sequential fires)

**4. Loss distribution (Economic/Social)**

\- Promoting the group distribution of losses (when D can transfer it on- customers, insurer, etc.)

\- Over time- all other things being equal, having a large number of people bear a small loss is better than having a single person bear a larger loss. For example, businesses can raise prices, purchase insurance.

\- But it often isn't imposed on these parties.

**5. Cheapest Cost Avoider (Economic)**

\- Assigns losses: the person with the best/cheapest technology should be held liable, so that they have the incentives to use the technology, if it's worthwhile or not use the incentives if it's not worthwhile (optimal deterrence).

\- Yes, but only under certain conditions.

\- BUT what do we assume that they know? (Ways to support, if they do:)

> \- That they know the technology
>
> \- That they know who will be harmed and what they'll be harmed for.
>
> \- That they know the law

\- Example: the ship-owner knows (Abraham)

\- Ways to challenge:

\- Fairness (between the parties)- party punished for being the most prepared.

> \- May also not meet corrective justice- party punished (for no precaution) may be party harmed
>
> \- You can have issues of technology changing/circumstances- this is completely contingent upon the facts.
>
> \- It may be cheapest for this person to bear, but it doesn't take into account that their implementation of the cheapest technology may be a bigger burden on them.
>
> \- Use proximate cause (foreseeability) to challenge the cheapest cost avoider: if they couldn't have foreseen that particular plaintiff or particular type of injury, they wouldn't know what precautions they may take, so it's not promoting optimal deterrence.

**6. Civil Recourse (Social)(P-D focus)**

\- Vindicates victim's need for recognition that they've been wronged, in a matter proportional to the seriousness of the wrong and seriousness of injury.

**7. Redress of Social Grievances (Abraham thinks this is strongest when it's supported by other aim)**

\- Right to sue promotes the redress of social grievances, especially against large, impersonal institutions. It's a populist mechanism that allows ordinary people to put authority on trial.

**\*\*More than one of these may play at a time\*\***

[Big Themes]{.underline}

**Coase Theorem**

\- Transaction costs

**Rules v. Standards**

**Rules**

\- Pros: Clear; uniform (could also be a con); easy to apply; cheaper to apply; people know how to behave (sometimes we just need a rule- 18yo in *Goss*)

-Cons: rigid, doesn't take into account unique circumstances; gaming (skirting the line); absurd results (5 year old sued for tricycle accident)

\- "As a matter of law"

\- Normally goes to the judge, he decides this

> \- Decision of the rule may sometimes go to the jury if the factual prerequisites aren't there.

***Baltimore & Ohio RR v. Goodman* (1927)- Holmes sets bright-line rule**

**-** Negligence as a matter of law by the plaintiff. Holmes lays down rule- a man has to get out of automobile and look. If a judge has seen 1000 of these cases, then he should lay down the rule.

**-** Judge as an expert because he's acquired a "fund of experience" on the matter. If you don't decide the jury will give out different verdicts, unfair.

**Standards-**

\- Pros: More information taken into account; flexible/adaptable; responsive to developing values -- Less constraint

\- Cons: Room for discretion and bias; room for mistakes;

\- Who decides/applies it? Jury/Factfinder

\- Jury deciding gives legitimacy.

\- "As a matter of fact/application" (mixed)

> \- Normally goes to the fact-finder (may usually be jury, but may also be judge if it's a summary judgment or bench trial).

\- Decide what the language means under the circumstances.

\- ***Pokora v. Wabash Railway* (1934)- Cardozo says that it would be dangerous to have rule**

**-** After setting out all of the hypotheticals where it wouldn't be helpful to get out and check, he states that circumstances are important. Need for caution in framing standards of behavior that amount to rules of law, leave it to jury.

\- Mixed Examples: a minor under the age of 18 is held to the same **age** (rule-like), **experience** (standard-like), **maturity** (standard-like) as a **reasonable child of the same age** (standard-like); children engaged in an adult activity (standard)

\- When arguing for one or the other:

\- What are the relative strengths or weaknesses of using one regime or the other?

\- Which regime do you want?/ How much tailoring do you want/need in a situation (favors rule)?

**Who decides?**

Judge or Jury?

\- Issues are usually submitted to the jury if the "reasonable person could disagree" about the resolution of the issue.

\- Whether a particular issue poses a jury question is made through rulings on motions for a directed verdict or through a jury instruction.

- Directed verdict: a jury should not and will not rule for the defendant because it would be unreasonable.

- For Jury instructions: consider that the jury can get confused/ technicalities are hard.

Courts or legislatures?

\- When arguing ask: who has the most information to make this call? Who can we trust to make the call? Is there institutional competency to make this call?

\-

**It takes 2 to Tort**

\- PL's Role & DF's role

\- Damages

**Statutes/CL in Torts**

\- Can CL borrow from statute? Yes- age of majority (to draw line), negligence per se

\- Can statutes borrow from CL? Yes- Clean Water Act (use "recklessness, willful misconduct" assumes we'll know)

\- Can statutes create tort liability? Yes- *Cuyler* (Illinois)- looking to see if statute assigned it, FTCA

\- Can a federal statute eliminate state tort liability? Yes.

***-*** Statutes can preempt tort liability

**Third Restatement**

\- BPL= Framed as ~F~L^H^ ~F~S^H^B- Take precaution if PL\>B

\- When arguing foreseeability or not foreseeability- foreseeability that the *risk would be materialized into harm*

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Nature and Function of Tort Law**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

\- Torts: mostly state CL created- a legally cognizable wrong not part of another field of law

\- *Accident law*- SL or N, usually for physical injury---bodily or property

\- Strict liability- no regard to degree of care D exercised

> \- Negligence liability- upon proof of some kind of D carelessness (failure to exercise reasonable care)

\- *Intentional torts*- Liability is not imposed for N, but only upon proof of the D's intention to invade the legally protected interest of another.

Accidental and Intentional torts- have different standards of care.

\- Tort law features in US:

1\) Trial by jury: Play to emotions or sympathy; but 90% of cases settle.

2\) Liability insurance: Influences decision of whether to sue and whom to sue.

3\) Contingent Fee system

4\) American Rule for costs- Each party pays own costs

\- 4 elements of any cause of action in tort:

1\) **Duty** (Legal duty to comply with a particular standard of care)

2\) **Breach of duty** (Failure to comply with the applicable standard of care)

3\) **Causation**

4\) **Damages**

\- Physical harm, particularly bodily integrity, is prioritized.

***Hammontree v. Jenner* (1971)- Argue for SL over N**

**- Facts**

- Defendant had epileptic seizure & crashed his car through the wall of the shop where Hammontree was working. Plaintiff sued defendant for personal injuries and property damage. P's attorney wanted change in law from N to SL. Couldn't really prove Hammontree had done anything wrong (Medical history, DMV cleared.)

**- Rule-** There was no absolute liability for Jenner in crashing.

**-** Argue for the judge to apply the standard that's convenient to you (N/SL).

- Basic question of tort law: who should pay?

  - Plaintiff: incentives to pay attention to landlord, bear the risk for putting it so close to road.

  - Defendant: shouldn't drive

- Law is moving slowly towards strict liability, but this court isn't willing to take it here

- Different types of argument: Human arguments Didn't do anything wrong!/should know and bear the risk!/ Policy arguments: need to give incentives to be careful, get insurance; Legalistic arguments:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Negligence: The Standard of Care**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**[Negligence Building Blocks]{.underline}**

- Negligence: **failure to exercise reasonable care** to avoid injury or damage to another person (**breach of a duty** that causes harm); General duty not to be negligent.

- **Building blocks of negligence** (Historical progression; See *Brown* and *Adams*):

  - [(1)Standard of care]{.underline}: ordinary care (from extraordinary care)

  - [(2)Burden of proof]{.underline}: on Plaintiff to show lack of ordinary care (D had to show extraordinary care) ("subsidy" to D)

  - [(3)Contributory negligence]{.underline}: the only way you get recovery (under contributory negligence) is if the P is taking ordinary care, and the D isn't ("subsidy" to D)

  - [(4)Foreseeability]{.underline}: Accident has to be foreseen

  - [(5)Untaken precautions]{.underline}: "facility of protection" or lack thereof, costs

***Brown v. Kendall* (1850)- From "extraordinary care" to "ordinary care", burden shifts to P, PL -- due care**

**- Facts:** P and D both owned dogs, are fighting. D is beating dogs to separate them. P advances towards dogs. D is retreating backwards, hits the P w/ stick.

**- Rule:** No action unless the D had intended or was N in injuring P

- Bar of care, overall falls lower. (EC-\>OC)

- Burden is on plaintiff to prove breach of care.

- PL has to take due care too

- From \"subsidy\" to plaintiffs to \"subsidy\" to defendants by requiring negligence and later providing contributory negligence

***Adams v. Bullock* (1919)- Adding foreseeability & untaken precautions to negligence blocks**

**- Facts-** D runs a trolley line and uses an overhead wire system crossing bridge. P was crossing the bridge swinging a wire, the wire came into contact, P was shocked and burned.

**- Rule-** Adds two building blocks

- Foreseeability: Absent prophecy, there's no way this accident could have been foreseen.

- Untaken precautions: consider facility of protection- we can't expect these industries to protect against every single risk. Sometimes may impose a duty, but not here.

**- Policy-** Cardozo is protecting industry; Defendant can now prove that they've given enough

\- Does kind of a BPL analysis.

> **[Standard of Care: Objective Reasonable Person Standard]{.underline}**

\- What an average person *ought* to do

\- Depends on the circumstances/ facts- a \"mixed question of fact & law\" -- jury decides

> \- Jury\'s judgment relies on familiarity with the subject and, thus, how the person should have behaved.

**-** The reasonable person isn't perfect, to the extent that the shortcomings embody community beliefs

**- Objective standard**: "under the circumstances" doesn't include the person's incapacities, did his best or acting in good faith are not admissible; perfect compliance ~~("I only sped 1 time!"~~)

\- Subjective standard is too would encourage fraud;

\- Subjective standard is too difficult for jury to get into someone else's head

\- Objective standard- treats people equally

\- Objective standard- people to try their best, or to limit their involvement in an activity

> \- Objective standard- more fair by not asking people to stigmatize selves
>
> \- Objective standard- people know to rely on certain care levels (safety for everyone)

\- Other **Pros**:

\- cost and ease of adjudication/ feasibility of fact-finding

\- clear jury instructions (how would a reasonable person behave)?

\- fair, uniform results

\- incentivizes a certain degree of care skill among everyone

**- *AofTL*:** ***Fairness***

**[Cases]{.underline}**

***Daniels v. Clegg* (1873)- Jury instructions help (lower standard for women)**

**- Facts-** Daughter of P was driving a horse and buggy when she collided with Daniels (D).

**- Rule-** No one would expect the same knowledge, skill, dexterity, judgment from a woman as from an ordinary man in these circumstances.- P didn't know better

***Little Rock Railway Company v. Tankersley* (1890)- Jury instructions hurt (elderly lady should avoid)**

**- Facts-** Elderly lady, when the train arrived at her station tried to get on train. It stopped, but not long enough to enable her to get on safely. While she was getting on, injured.

**- Rule-** \"A young active man might prudently alight when an attempt would be reckless in an old or lame man.\" -- P should have known better

**- Policy/Application:** If you're in a jurisdiction where they don't allow you to take into consideration sex, age, etc., make it a part of the circumstances instead of personal

- Ex: "A reasonable person wearing a skirt wouldn't have tried to alight."

- In *Tankersley and Clegg,* her sex could also hurt/help defendant because they should have considered her visible qualities when acting. (She was a circumstance so he should have known better *or* her presence made it a more dangerous situation for him)

- Ways to bring sex into account: arguing the facts in front of jury or showing evidence about the circumstances.

**[Exceptions to the Objective Standard]{.underline}**

**Children \<5:**

- Children below the age of 5 cannot be negligent at all

- Parents are generally not liable for the torts of their children, can be held liable for negligent supervision, especially the younger the child is.

**Children, 5-17:**

\- Semi-objective standard: exercise the degree of care reasonable in a child of similar age,

> intelligence, and experience.
>
> \- Rationale: Limit to the degree of care that can be expected of children; people that interact with children can take care
>
> \- Exception: kids in adult activity

- No way to protect against this, can't see it's a child piloting a plane.

- No social benefit from immunizing children in adult activities

- May be covered by parent's liability insurance for activities (driving)

**Infirm:**

- Physical: yes- visible, measurable, verifiable

- Mental: no- not verifiable, may have periods of lucidity that let you take care of when you won't be lucid

- Jury can be permitted to take into account whether infirmities should have led to different or additional precautions. Evidence of what similar infirmities do.

+================================================+==========================================+

\*\*Just because it doesn't fall into the "special characteristics" category, doesn't mean it helps/doesn't help. Depends on the lawyering\*\*

**General types of arguments to argue things in and out of categories above:**

- Moral/ethical

  - Fairness

  - Consistency

- Society/policy

  - Equality of treatment

  - Equality of outcomes

  - Incentives (for party that knows)

- Legalistic

  - Juries can/cannot decide well

  - Verifiability

**[Cases]{.underline}**

***Vaughan v. Menlove* (1837)- Mental abilities not taken into account**

**- Facts:** The defendant landowner piled hay in a way that created a fire hazard to neighbors; wanted jury instruction because of his inferior mental ability.

\- **Rule:** No instruction on inferior abilities, will leave a line so vague that variations could be infinite.

***Roberts v. Ramsbottom* (1980) Physical disability (because it's mixed w/ mental/infirm?)**

**- Facts:** Defendant suffers strokes before going out on a drive. Consciousness impaired but could drive. No moral blame but, if he retained some control even if imperfect he is still liable. The only way to be completely exculpated is total unconsciousness.

***Goss v. Allen* (1976)- Unsuccessfully argues skiing is "adult"; *Rules v. Standards*- 17 v. 18 yo**

**- Facts-** Plaintiff was an experienced skier. Defendant, 17 years old, was a beginner skier who ran into plaintiff.

**- Rule-** Skiing is not an activity that should be held to an adult standard of care. (People of all ages use it, this is not like driving a car or motor boat, doesn't require a license.)

**-** The Appellate Court couldn\'t see why you would hold an 18 year old to a standard of care and not a 17 year old to the same standard, but this will always be arbitrary, so it's not unreasonable to draw the line at the age of legal maturity (18 in NJ). ***Statutes***

**[Tailoring Standard of Care to the Circumstances]{.underline}**

\- Flags for the jury in jury instructions

\- Tailor standard of care by: level of danger, what we want to incentivize, technological advancements

\- See *Bethel*, used to have highest degree of care as a *common carrier*, this was the NY law for 100 years before it was changed in 1998.

\- See *Groh*, highest standard of care for gun owners and *dangerous instrumentalities*

\- See *Levey*, emergencies- honest exercise of judgment when given a short time to react in an unforeseeable circumstance.

\- How jury instructions help tailor:

*-* "Under the circumstances" still encompasses emergencies, other situations.

> \- Still want an instruction: Acts as an exception to the negligence standard. It highlights situation for the ***Jury*** and entail that special consideration should be given.
>
> \- Consider making it a question of law for appeal:

- If fact- you can't bring in new evidence, it's on paper. Only trial judge gets to see witnesses, etc. Appeals are deferential on facts.

- Appeals reverse on questions of law. (Jury instruction should've been given!)

> \- Consider that you have to argue to the ***Judge*** to get this

**[Cases]{.underline}**

***Bethel v. NYC Transit Authority* (1998)- Lowered standard of care for common carriers**

**- Facts-** Plaintiff was hurt when the wheelchair accessible seat collapsed under him. There had been some repairs. He says that if it had been inspected the defects causing the seat to collapse would have been revealed.

**- Rule-** Court they should just have ordinary care, no longer "utmost care."

- "Under the circumstances" already applies the circumstances of a common carrier.

**- Policy-**

- Public transport is something we want to incentivize

- Things are contestable no matter when (especially if technology has evolved).

- Ask for different instructions to get your way, judge may grant it.

***Wood v. Groh* (2000)- Highest standard of care for dangerous instrumentality**

**- Facts-** P was accidentally shot with defendant's gun fired by his 15 yr. old. Original judgment for D- Judge had given an ordinary negligence charge. Second court reverses.

**- Rule-** A gun is a "dangerous instrumentality." The fact that gun wasn\'t loaded is insignificant because they kept the ammunition in the same cabinet. And the fact that the father locked it, kept key, and told son he couldn\'t take it is similarly insignificant because the son only needed a screwdriver to obtain the ammunition.

**- Policy**-

- We don't necessarily want to incentivize gun use, so higher standard of care.

- Think about "dangerous instrumentalities," in this case- some care isn't enough.

***Levey v. DeNardo* (1999)- Honest exercise of judgment \> ordinary care in emergencies.**

**- Facts-** Judge refused to give emergency doctrine charge after D rear-ended P who had to stop suddenly when car came across her path. Lower court was wrong not to instruct on the emergency doctrine. Next court finds for the D- emergency doctrine granted because confronted with a sudden and unforeseeable occurrence.

**-** **Application:** Even if they're not willing to say jury instruction, you should argue that the emergency should be in the jury instructions in "under the circumstances."

**[Negligence Calculus: Learned Hand's Formula For Negligence]{.underline}**

**[(& Foreseeability)]{.underline}**

\- One clarification of the reasonable person standard, may help guide judge/jury's thinking

**Third Restatement Form**:

> \- A person acts negligently if they do not exercise reasonable care under all of the circumstances.
>
> \- Primary factors to be considered whether the person's conduct lacks reasonable care are: - [foreseeable likelihood]{.underline} that the person's conduct [will result in harm]{.underline},
>
> \- [foreseeable severity of any harm]{.underline} that may ensue,
>
> \- burden of [precautions]{.underline} to eliminate or reduce the risk of harm.

- Affords a way of thinking about the circumstances under which a reasonable person would risk harm or would instead take steps to reduce the risk.

\- May be:

\- Used *Sua ponte* by judge,

\- Used if appeal is couched in cost-benefit terms,\*\*^most\ done^

\- Ignored of and adopt traditional reasonable person standard,\*\*^most\ done^

\- Rejected as a matter of law.\*\*^least\ done^

\- Today, jury instructions don't really include formula.

**In Ideal Form:**

- **PL\>B:**

  - P: (foreseeable) probability of harm (if precaution is not taken); +

  - L: (foreseeable) magnitude of harm (due to accident); compared against

  - B: Burden (cost of untaken precautions)

    - Value of interest that must be forgone or sacrificed to reduce the risk.

  - Don't spend on precaution if B\> PL. Do spend if PL\>B

\- **Not a bright-line rule**- trying to put structure to mushy standards and see how circumstances may fit in, applying a ***Standard***.

\- Approximate, or intuit factors rather than measure.

\- Note that **foreseeability** is included in the PL in BPL- would the risk *materialize into harm*?

- A D is not negligent unless he knew or reasonably should have known the harm could occur.

- Few risks are so unforeseeable that it would let the D completely escape liability.

- How likely or unlikely it is that a particular risk *would materialize into harm* is very relevant.

\- **Pros:**

> \- Social well-being: People can take cost-justified risks are allowed without fear of liability; they're deterred from taking ones that aren't. ***Optimal D?***
>
> \- Recognizes that there are worthwhile, but also wasteful precautions. (can't guard against everything)

\- You consider your costs and benefits equally to others'.

\- We monetize things all the time (insurance) why not our behavior?

**- Cons:**

\- People don't usually think like this. ***Does it meet deterrence**?*

\- What about fairness, helping harmed person? ***Fairness/Corrective Justice***

- Accordingly, juries may ignore/abhor this analysis. (Think of *Pinto* case)

> \- Legal costs: Operation of the entire torts system isn't taken into account (judge, jurors, lawyers, witnesses)- may exceed the incentive and fairness benefits it creates.
>
> \- "Information costs": the cost of parties and the court to get information reliable about BPL in any given case.

\- Commensurability: lack of a common metric when you apply formula.

- price of a sawed off finger v. the price of a blade guard?

- If it's difficult to obtain, application will be wrong

> \- No thought to custom

\- Formula could be helpful in making rough and ready decisions where you don't need exact information- you know enough to know that the PL was small, or trivial. It may be clear that it exceeds the burden and precaution should have been taken.

**[Cases]{.underline}**

***US v. Carroll Towing* (1947)- Learned Hand's BPL**

**- Facts:** US hired PA Railroad to delivery flour on trans-Atlantic ship. In super busy piers, Carroll bargees didn't sufficiently secure Anna C, it hits a tanker on Pier 51, gets hole. The Anna C\'s bargee failed to alert that the Anna C was leaking (other tug's pumps could have rescued) Anna C dumped her cargo and capsized. On appeal, they're not sure about negligence of the bargee in not being there. Blaming the bargee to get Caroll Towwing exculpated.

**- Rule:** Bargee should have been aboard (so there was contributory negligence).

Employs PBL. (*Burden*: untaken precaution- not being on a boat in the middle of the day; *probability*- crowded/but also weather- cuts both ways; *Loss*- crowded; cargo & war going on). Decides not to set a rule about bargee being on boat.

***Eckert v. Long Island* RR- Human life may really tip the scale one way**

\- The victim saving the baby didn't bar recovery on the basis for contributory negligence.

\- P (risk of death to the rescuer, possible) x L (death or serious injury) \< accident avoidance costs/interest sacrificed (Child hit by the train) + "danger invites rescue" made the burden to be forgone too high. (Formula used weirdly here)

**[McCarty v. Pheasant Run]{.underline}, 7^th^ Circuit 1987, pp. 46-47**

-       Plaintiff guest was assaulted in her room at defendant's resort by an intruder who entered by a sliding glass door

-       Door opened onto a walkway -- had not been locked, but the security chain had been fastened

-       Plaintiff put forth the following untaken precautions: defendant should have made sure door was locked before renting the room; should have warned her to keep the door locked; should have equipped the door with a better lock; should have had more security guards on duty; should have made the walkway inaccessible to rooms (or some combo)

-       Posner affirms jury verdict for defendant -- Hand formula isn't for a jury; jury is just to make a rough judgment of reasonableness ("intuiting rather than measuring the factors in the Hand Formula") -- so long as it's reasonable, has to stand

***Bolton v. Stone*- Foreseeability**

**-** Just taking into account PL (that's foreseeability)

**[Negligence *Per Se*]{.underline}**

\- A violation of a statute designed to promote safety is negligence per se

> \- CL creation based on notion that a reasonable person doesn\'t violate statutes.
>
> \- Compliance with a statute doesn't prove you're free from liability (may be lowest bar, may have been adopted long ago, may only show you weren't GN)

\-**Defenses:**

\- Legally cognizable excuses to violating the statute

> \- Necessity, incapacity, emergency
>
> \- Children, reasonable effort, non-compliance is safer

\- Defense of limited statutory purpose

- Plaintiff wasn\'t in the class of persons, or did not suffer the type of harm intended to be protected by the statute that the defendant violated.

**- Pros:**

- Legislature represents society's expectations

- Legislature has better information to make a call (disputable)

- Statutory law is more accessible than judge-made law

**- Cons:**

- Legislature doesn't think about all circumstances.

- Exceptions when it's safer to violate.

- Legislatures are affected by special interests.

- Over-warning: Already impose criminal penalties under the statute, also impose tort penalties? (Think of *Cuyler*)

\- **Ways to argue:**

**- *Courts or Legislatures?***

> \- Legislature has the most processes to investigate what would be the best rule **but** Holmes was saying he'd seen many jury outcomes and was crystalizing that.

\- Juries deal with people being hurt, society's expectations are better met by juries.

\- Limited Statutory Purpose: Law has to be relevant (See *Gorris*)

> \- But consider that laws don't often have their purpose written in (room to find "secondary purpose," see below)

\- What if the statute's purpose is irrelevant to negligence?

> \- Argue that the core risk in the statute can be stretched to the actual accident (legislature meant to cover this type of risk/accident) (*See Rockwood Splinter*)
>
> \- May also use to extend liability to a party not ordinarily covered. (*See* Dram Shop Laws)

\- Statute crystalized common law duty, should have its exceptions (*Tedla)*

**[Cases]{.underline}**

***Martin v. Herzog* (1920)- Violating statute is N per se/ jury can't do away with it.**

**- Facts-** P and husband driving in buggy. Struck by D's automobile coming in the opposite direction, husband killed. P claims D broke Highway Law- did not keep to the right of the center of the highway. P was negligent for traveling without lights.

**- Rule-** Cardozo overturns lower court's jury instructions- says that violating a statute is negligence. A statute gives you a duty, you can't have jury do away with it.

***Tedla v. Ellman* (1939)- Violating statute is safer**

**- Facts-** P, junk collectors walking down highway, no sidewalks, couldn\'t use grass center. 1933 statute provides for how pedestrians should walk on a roadway. Sunday night, heavy traffic back into NYC and very few cars going east. Walking east on edge of east lane when they were hit by defendant\'s car.

**- Rule-** If the statute was made to crystalize common law principles, then when it is applied shouldn't be construed to wipe out the limitations and exceptions, which judicial decisions have attached to the common law duty. Not held contributory negligent.

***Gorris* (Sheep Case)- Law must be relevant to what happened; Limited Statutory Purpose**

\- You can only claim negligence when the law is relevant to what happened. Law here wasn't to keep sheep from falling overboard, but to keep them from getting sick.

***Dram Shop Laws-* Secondary purpose was to prevent injury**

Some states will extend liability to servers of alcohol to third parties who were injured by drunk drivers.

***Dehaen v. Rockwood Sprinkler*- Law is within the zone of apprehension (extend core risk)**

\- The corporation was liable under the statute, even though the chief object of the statute was to protect workmen from falling into a shaft. The risk (radiator falling) was within the zone of apprehension because the barrier was meant to be a general warning for falling things (men or radiators).

**Diponzio v. Riordan**

> **[External Standards: Custom]{.underline}**

- Non-compliance with custom may be used to show negligence and evidence of compliance may be used defensively, admissible but not dispositive.

- Two competing rules: custom is conclusive on the issue of negligence; custom is irrelevant

- Departure from custom is more probative than compliance, because industry won't be taking more care than necessary, so why couldn't you comply? (BPL- clearly it's affordable or worth avoiding possible disaster).

- Sufficiently widespread (doesn't need to be universal.)

\- **Pros:**

\- Takes juries from what reasonable care "ought" to be to what it "is"

\- May caution the jury (they may find a whole industry negligent.)

\- **Cons:**

\- Not being a custom doesn't necessarily mean it's not needed.

**[Cases]{.underline}**

***The TJ Hooper* (1931)- Custom may win over regulatory compliance; Uses BPL to show why it should become custom**

**- Facts-** Two coal barges were lost in the storm. The barge owners and the owners of the coal sued the tug boats including T.J. Hooper. P claims that tug operators had negligently failed to equip the tugs with reliable radios that would have allowed the tugs to receive storm warnings. Other tugs got warnings and put safely into water. Lower court broadens statute' core risk to apply to tugs (only had applied to steamers). L. Hand goes to custom to say tugs were unseaworthy without radios.

**- Rule-** Courts must in the end say what is required:

\- There are precautions so imperative that even their universal disregard will not excuse their omission.

\- Reasonable prudence is often common prudence, but not always. (When court has reason to say what is required)

\- Uses BPL analysis to show it should be custom- having a radio is negligible cost.

**- Policy-** Court establishing custom because industry has reason to lag back.

\- Regulatory compliance was not a way to get out of court-established custom here.

> **[Malpractice]{.underline}**

\- Malpractice- values that amount to doing the right thing in medical practice

\- Compliance with custom insulates the D from liability and failure to comply with professional custom is malpractice.

> \- Why ***Rule***? Jury is substantially less familiar with medical matters than events in ordinary negligence cases.

\- **Pros:**

\- Set standards for actual care & licensing boards- not only cost-cutting

**- Cons:**

> \- There are other fields with complex issues involving non-professional liability (extension argument?)

\- Insulates doctors? (Then why have insurance premiums gone up?)

\- Demise of the locality rule:

- Strict locality-expert witnesses had to be physicians actually practicing in locality

- Encouraged conspiracy of silence and lack of consideration.

- Not necessary with standardization/nationalization of medical practice.

- Only a fraction of people who are injured sue and get recovery, some of those do not appear to actually have been victims of malpractice- so it's not great at compensating deserving claimants. ***Corrective Justice***

**[Case]{.underline}**

***Sheeley v. Memorial Hospital* (1998)- Repudiation of locality rule over national standard**

**- Facts:** Dr. Ryder performed an episiotomy, plaintiff developed complications at the site of surgery. Ryder was a second year family practice resident. Tried to bring OB/GYN that was certified by national standards, expert. D tried to block him from testifying.

**- Rule**: OBGYN may testify, if he's overqualified, national standard complying, that should be enough.

\- **Policy**: Can be seen as the demise of a custom in a way

**[Gross Negligence]{.underline}**

- When you use even way less care than ordinary care, especially bad negligence.

- Components considered in BP: Recklessness, gross negligence, willful misconduct

***United States v. BP-* When the statue doesn't define CL term**

**- Facts**/**Elements:**

\- BP conducted negative pressure test and declared it a success because no fluid was observed flowing from the kill line for 30 minutes and there was no pressure on the kill line for 30 minutes. However, high pressure remained and test should have been declared failure and re-conducted. BP Well Site leader told Transocean to proceed with mud displacement (ordinary course) and later blowout.

\-**Rule:** The discharge of oil was result of gross negligence and willful misconduct.

\- The Clean Water Act doesn't define gross negligence, recklessness, or willful misconduct

\- BP: Gross negligence must include "culpable mental state" and degree of recklessness. Judge Barbier: NO

\- US: Gross negligence is an *extreme departure* from the care required under the circumstances or a failure to exercise even slight care. (ordinary negligence but worse) YES.

\- At issue: pay \$1,100 per barrel for ordinary negligence v. 4x that for gross negligence

\- **Policy/Ways to argue:**

\- Does BPL analysis with heightened definition, even with recklessness and intent and still finds for BP, so he doesn't get overturned.

- Negative pressure test- easy to read and re-do

- Communicating with Houston team.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Duty: Affirmative Duties**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**[In General]{.underline}**

- Breach of **a duty** that causes harm

- Duty: obligation to take/refrain from taking some action. Without a duty there is no liability.

- Duty- "Question of law": Court decides (in this sense, duty comes before breach) ***Who decides? Judge/jury?***

> \- Breach of Duty- "Question of law/fact"? Jury ***Who decides? Judge/jury?***

*-* \*\*DON'T BE MISLED\*\* Reasonable/ordinary care applies whenever you take action.

- **Asking whether the D had a duty to the P and whether that duty was breached** is another way of asking **whether the D was negligent, and whether that negligence was a proximate cause of the P's harm**.

- In those cases, analyzing the problem in terms of duty could lead to the **mistaken conclusion**, that even after the negligence and proximate cause questions have been answered, there is still no liability unless the D owed the plaintiff a duty independent of the obligation to exercise reasonable care not to risk foreseeable physical injury to the P.

- In ordinary cases, this is a mistaken conclusion, because the D's negligence is precisely the breach of duty that is alleged.

<!-- -->

- Strict liability: duty isn't to stay away from abnormally activities; the "duty" is simply to compensate those injured by the activity- pay your own way if you choose to engage.

**How to attack AFFIRMATIVE DUTIES (TO RESCUE, TO WARN, TO INFORM):**

> **\*\*You want to argue in or out of a special relationship/ you want to argue for the reasonable patient or reasonable physician standard/ you want to argue that the CL should create a duty to these people (use the 6 factors when doing this); you want to argue in and out of the label- feasibility, cost, information wanted/needed (label clutter), threshold issue: common sense/ v. label warning needed!" or Alternative design existed/didn't exist!\*\***

 

**[Affirmative Duty: In General]{.underline}**

- In general, there are no affirmative duties (Defendant is not liable for nonfeasance).

- These are situations in which the D doesn\'t negligently create a risk of physical harm. P is independently at risk of suffering physical harm and the D might, through exercise of reasonable care, eliminate or reduce the risk.

- Exceptions to this duty may involve:

  - Emergency

  - Special relationships (psychiatrist, dependency)

- Factors weighed in determining a duty (NOT a fixed test!):

> 1\. *Foreseeability* of harm,
>
> 2\. Closeness of the *connection between the D\'s conduct* and the harm suffered by P.
>
> 3\. *Moral blame* attached to the D\'s conduct
>
> 4\. *Extent of the burden* on the D and the consequences for the community
>
> 5\. Policy of *preventing future harm*
>
> 6\. Availability and prevalence of *insurance* that would be available if a duty imposed.

\- Where no duty lies originally, can statutes create tort liability? Yes.

**[Affirmative Duty: Rescue]{.underline}**

\- Generally, there is no affirmative duty to rescue another person from a position of danger (See *Moch*)

\- Why? Common law cares about individual liberties

- Permitting liability for the failure to rescue would create a slippery slope, problems determining how liability goes if there's more than one rescuer.

\- Exceptions:

- Undertaking a rescue: Liable for conducting the rescue itself negligently (Reliance)

- If you negligently create the risk: this would be a misfeasance rather than a nonfeasance

- If you non-negligently create the risk (duty to warn/rescue *sometimes*):

  - Especially when risk is *characteristic of the activity*:

  - D's truck stalls on top of a hill, P crashes into him, D may be liable for warning to approach drivers of danger on top of hill

  - Difficult to distinguish these cases from the ones where there is no duty to rescue.

  - Once D does activity that substantially raises risk to others, even if D non-negligent, D no longer minding his own business.

\- No affirmative duty to warn or rescue 3^rd^ Parties either (*See Cuyler*)

**[Cases]{.underline}:**

***Moch Co. v. Rensselaer Water Co*. (NY Ct. of App.- Cardozo)(1928)- Misfeasance/nonfeasance**

**- Facts:** D water co. had contract with city to supply water including for service at fire hydrants. A building caught fire and spread to P\'s warehouse. P alleged that the Co.\'s failure to supply water permitted the spread of the fire. Here it was nonfeasance, not misfeasance.

\- **Rule:** If conduct has gone forward to such a stage that inaction would commonly result not negatively merely in withholding a benefit, but **positively or actively in working an injury**, there exists a relation out of which arises a duty to go forward.

\- The question is whether the wrongdoer has advanced to such a point as to have **launched a force or instrument of harm** or has stopped where inaction is at most a **refusal to become an instrument for good**.

+=============================+=========================================+

***Cuyler v. United States* (2004) (U.S. Ct. of App. Third Circuit-Posner)- No duty to rescue 3^rd^ persons / No statutory creation of duty**

**- Facts:** Babysitter abused Normans' son. Hospital doesn't report the incident to child services. Statute provides that people having reasonable cause to believe a child known to them in professional capacity may be abused shall report. Babysitter kills the Cuylers' child.

**- Rule:** If CL doesn't create tort duty (& it doesn't no good Samaritan law for 3^rd^ parties), statute must create a duty.

> \- Flowerpot analogy: A is not liable if he doesn't warn B that a flowerpot is about to hit him, even if legislature has announced that due required a rescue attempt because he has no duty to *B* to exercise due care; he may be held liable if he threw the flowerpot on B and the legislature announced due care requires avoiding tossing heavy objects out of windows onto other people's heads, because he has a duty here.

**- Outcome:** CL doesn't provide duty to rescue, and the statute doesn't provide for tort damages, so the courts weren't trying to extend liability for failure to warn the Cuylers

\- Tied to causation- no way to say things would have been different if duty had been there!

***Tarasoff v. Regents of Unversity of California* (1976)(Supr. Ct. of CA)*-* Creating a CL duty to 3^rd^ parties**

- **Facts:** Dr. Moore, a psychologist, treated Poddar. Poddar confided his intention to kill Tarasoff. Police briefly detained him but he was later released. No one warned Tatiana or plaintiffs of peril.

- **Rule:** Psychiatrist- duty to warn person endangered by their patients after the person has communicated intent to harm a third person.

  - Controversy because of patient confidentiality agreement and legally created duty to third party, especially when there\'s no relationship with the 3rd party.

  - Rule is only applied when patient has expressed intention to injure a specifically identified the person. (Defined in later CA cases)

  - Court weighs the 6 factors in determining affirmative duty. (supra)

- **Ways to argue:** Several positions that could have been argued- police & community (including Tarasoff) have special relationship; Psychiatrist & Poddar have special relationship; *AofTL- **Deterrence*** is the aim, may not serve it because psychiatrists may keep quiet, won't want to write notes done.

**[Affirmative Duty: Special Relationships]{.underline}**

\- By entering a special relationship, often involves dependence, the defendant has waived right to mind their own business

- Common carriers, inn-keepers, parents, doctors (see *informed consent*)

**[Duty to Warn: Medical/ Informed Consent (Affirmative Duty: Special Relationships)]{.underline}**

\- Rationale: Dependency factor between doctors & patients; Patients tend to make informed, not independent decisions

\- Physician may be held liable when a patient consents to treatment, but was not sufficiently informed because of the physician's failure to provide the patient with requisite information (benefits & risks).

\- Even if treatment done the right way, P may prevail if they wouldn't have consented had they been informed.

\- 2 standards for determining whether informed consent has been met:

\- **Reasonable patient standard** (**Patient-expectations controlled**)

> \- Doctors must disclose risk and benefits that they think a patient would want to know.
>
> \- Doesn't have to guess idiosyncratic ideas, unless patient discloses (ear model scenario)
>
> \- Evidence of medical disclosure standards are relevant but not dispositive
>
> \- Expert testimony may say what the risks/benefits are, jury makes the call on what patient wanted to hear
>
> \- Failure to obtain informed consent is negligence, not malpractice
>
> \- **Reasonable physician standard** (**Physician-practice controlled**)
>
> \- Plaintiff must show that the physician didn't comply with professional standards
>
> \- Requires expert testimony to show the risks and benefits, as well as the applicable disclosure standard
>
> \- Failure to obtain informed consent is malpractice

\- Physicians tend to disclose what they think patients want to know, so there usually isn\'t a big difference between the two standards.

**[Duty to Warn: Products Liability]{.underline}**

- **Warning Defects**

- Duty to warn if there is an unavoidable risk (distinguished from design defect)

- It is feasible and desirable to transfer risk information to purchaser in a position to decide for himself whether the risks posed by a product design are worth its utility.

- Two areas of controversy:

  - **Adequacy of warning**

    - NOT SL (Balance (1) feasibility, (2)cost, and (3)information that purchasers want/need- "label clutter" problem)

    - Threshold issue: When is it time to warn and when is it common sense?

    - Heeding presumption often used: P would/wouldn't have used product in the way she did had warning been given; creating insurance for those who would have used anyway, allowing those who wouldn't have the chance to recover

    - ***Juries & Judges***- to lesser extent in directed verdict- make determination about adequacy of warning

  - **Warning-design defect connection**

    - If reasonable alternative design exists, warning doesn\'t insulate defendant from liability

    - No design alternative available

      - May or may not be liable

  - "Patent danger" rule once prevailed- an adequate warning was always sufficient since this rule provided that the design defects were obvious, then manufacturer couldn\'t be held liable

    - Overruled in many jurisdictions

    - Rejection of consumer sovereignty- juries hold warning isn't enough, product so dangerous it can't be out in market

- **Affirmative Defenses**:

  - Contributory/comparative negligence

  - Assumption of risk (included in comparative negligence in some jurisdictions)

  - Product misuse- But manufacturer remains liable for the misuse if it\'s foreseeable, or it can be trumped by plaintiff\'s assumption of risk and the manufacturer is not liable

**[Cases]{.underline}**

***Hood v. Ryobi American* (1999)(US Court of Appeals 4^th^ Circuit)- Label clutter**

**- Facts:** Labels warn not to remove saw\'s blade guards. P removes the blade guards, blade flies off saw, causing injuries. Thought that the blade guard warnings were to prevent clothing or fingers from getting caught in saw blade, not because it would fly off! Most people left blade guards on.

**- Rule:** Re-defines the burden from low printing costs (for informing of all actual risks) to high label clutter costs (consumers won't pay attention anymore); Additional warnings should not be placed when there is no net benefit.

**[Federal Preemption]{.underline}**

\- Argue that a (federal) statute can eliminate (state) tort liability:

> **- Express**: When Congress *explicitly states* in the federal statute that there's a preemption clause eliminating state tort liability (like the MDA)
>
> \- *Parallel*: may be in addition but technically it's the same thing; both state and federal statute eliminate tort law liability (way to save your state law claim)(See *Lohr & Stengel*)

**- Implied:**

> \- *Field*: Congress means for federal statute to *govern the entire relevant field* and state tort liability to be eliminated
>
> \- *Conflict*: State law requirement *conflicts with the federal statute*, by presenting a more stringent requirement than federal statute, so it's preempted. (*See Riegel*)

\- Questions about preemption

> \- Can CL borrow from a statute? Yes.
>
> \- Can statutes borrow from CL? Yes.
>
> \- Can statutes create tort liability? Yes.

**[Cases:]{.underline}**

***Stengel v. Medtronic* (US Ct. of App. 9^th^ Ct.)(2013)- Federal Preemption Express & Parallel**

- **Rule:**

- A state law claim is not preempted when a state-law duty parallels a federal law duty

- Damages was not an addition, or more stringent requirement

- **Facts:** Medical device manufactured by Medtronic rendered Stengel permanently paraplegic. Required to report any information that suggests that the device could contribute to death, malfunction. He had it installed in 2000. In 2005, ascending paralysis. Medtronic had become aware of risks, failed to inform FDA, even though MDA required Medtronic to do so. MDA has an explicit preemption clause that states can't enact any additional requirement, which relates to the effectiveness or safety.

- 3 Cases Menitoned:

> *- Lohr*: Failure to warn (same as Stengel); Nothing prevents the court form providing traditional tort remedies for violations of common law duties when the duties parallel requirements (Parallel)
>
> *- Buckman:* Fraud on the FDA; Suing because the company fooled the FDA into approving a product, P brought fraud-on-agency claim, but not every violation of the FDCA will support a state-law claim- the FDA already deals with people lying to the FDA .
>
> *- Riegel*: If state law presents a more stringent safety requirement, preempted claim

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Causation in Fact**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Breach of a duty that **causes** harm

- Cause in fact requires that- as a factual matter- the defendant's act contributed to producing the plaintiff's injury (combine with proximate cause for the two requirements of causation in torts)

- This section considers: types/ questions of proof/ what harm/ allocation of \$ (not every section will apply to every case)

**[But For Causation]{.underline}**

**But for causation**- traditional basis for analyzing cause- in-fact

- Defendant is a cause of the event if the event would not have occurred **but for** that conduct

  - Take away the defendant's act, the plaintiff wouldn't have suffered injury

  - Converse: Defendant's conduct is not a cause of the event if the event would have **occurred without it**.

  - If **but for cause is satisfied**, causation in fact is satisfied.

> \- **Pros:**
>
> ***Corrective Justice* (Justice between parties)**

- Compensating the people who were actually harmed (and have more immediate need for money than those who just risked harm) by those who actually committed harm.

- Treating someone who just "risked" harm and one who actually caused it wouldn't be fair

***Deterrence***

- People can anticipate that if a risk they are threatening materializes in harm, they will incur liability equal to the average amount of damages that a potential victim will suffer.

- Communicates expectation in advance (Rather than unpredictability if there wasn't)

- If it didn't exist: if the jury didn't take into account if I caused the injury, I wouldn't be incentivized to do a cost-benefit analysis of whether I should engage in the activity, either way I could be held liable- If the precaution didn't make a difference- it would be wasteful. (Same thing if we don't have proximate cause- anyone could be liable so my precautions aren't worth it.)

<!-- -->

- **Cons**:

- **Asking the jury to engage in counterfactual:**

  - Look at *what did happen* and ask what *would have* *happened* if the D had not been negligent

    - Counterargument: Although this is inherently speculative, the parties may be able to present evidence about whether the negligent person's actions did make a difference or not. (i.e. expert witness testimony)

  - Related to informed consent and duty to report (good Samaritan laws)

    - Difficult to know that, even with the right information or reporting, the harm would be prevented. Chains of reporting make it difficult

  - But for- is a proxy test to determine causation- doesn't convey the concept well in some situations (multiple events causing harm.)

- **Moral Luck**: A D who is negligent but doesn't harm a P is not held liable for his N.

- **The Problem of Multiple "But For" Causes**

  - Gets complicated when more than 1 event happens and each was a necessary antecedent to the harm.

  - Being *a* but for cause is enough for liability, don't have to be the *sole* but for cause.

  - This applies to acts that take place simultaneously and acts that take place at different times.

**[Cases:]{.underline} But For Causation**

***Aegis Insurance v. 7 WTC-* Difficulty of proving "but for" cause when there's multiple causes/ big external causes**

- **Facts-** WTC7 was damaged by debris from the collapsing fires, looked like corner I-beam was missing, several floors exposed. Collapse of WTC destroyed the water main, no water to use to fight fires in the building. Fire department decides not to risk more lives, sets up collapse perimeter. 7WTC collapsed, destroying the electrical substation owned by Con Ed. Con Ed sues, but for the bad design of 7WTC, the station wouldn't have been crushed.

- **Rule-** Given the surrounding circumstances (9/11), it can't be said that the building design made any difference in the harm suffered by Con Ed (was the "but for" cause)- you didn't need the collapse, something else could have happened.

- Building design may have been a sufficient cause, but won't pursue that here. (Maybe FDNY wouldn't have abandoned building if it had looked better)

***Medtronic-* Counterfactuals are hard**

**-Facts**- Now that the Stengels are trying to predicate their claim on Medtronics reporting duty to the FDA: if Medtronic had properly reported the adverse events to the FDA as required under the federal law, that the information would have reached Mr. Stengel's doctors in time to prevent his injuries.

\- **Rule/Policy-** Counterfactuals/predictive analysis jury is being asked to engage in- ***Who decides?Judge/Jury***

***Cuyler*- Counterfactuals are hard**

**- Facts-** Essentially the Cuylers are arguing that, had the hospital reported Norman, there would have been response in a way that she wouldn't have been allowed to continue babysitting. This is completely unsure.

**- Rule/Policy-** Courts have been reluctant to create these good Samaritan laws because of issues with but for causation. It's hard when you have a chain of reporting. That's why we may not have duty of warning.

**[Multiple Necessary Causes]{.underline}**

- Closely related to but for causes

- Two fires- sprinkler, since there are 2 fires they overwhelm the sprinkler and it doesn't work so they're multiple necessary causes

- Two cars driving out without lights on, since both had lights off and if either would have had lights on, accident wouldn't have occurred, each one independently is a necessary cause.

- **Policy:** Related to "moral luck," if you want to argue against a MNC- you're not being negligent enough to start damage on your own and you can't consider someone else's negligence when you make your own calculus(?).

**[Multiple Causes, Inadvertent Causes, & Exceptions to the "But For" Cause]{.underline}**

**[(Situations where "but for" test yields unsatisfactory results)]{.underline}**

**[Multiple Sufficient Causes]{.underline}**

- Over-determined causation: the forces converge on P and either one alone would have been enough to cause all of the P's harm.

- Sometimes only one D is negligent, sometimes both are negligent.

- **Restatement Third §26:**

- Tortious conduct must be a factual cause of harm for liability to be imposed. Conduct is a factual cause of harm when the harm would not have occurred absent the conduct. Tortious conduct may also be a factual cause of harm under §27.

- **Restatement Third § 27:** Any sufficient cause is a factual cause; if multiple acts exist, each of which alone would have been a factual cause of the physical harm at the same time, *each act is regarded as a factual cause of the harm*.

- What if cause is trivial? Leaves assessment to "scope of liability/proximate cause" not to actual causation. Under this part of the restatement, Harriet would still liable (but not after **§** 29)

**Pros**:

- ***Corrective justice*** (rather than leaving plaintiff to bear costs),

- ***Deterrence*** (eliminating the luck) at the risk of over assigning liability

- Avoids absurd results (neither fire would be liable under but for)

**Cons:**

- Over-liability

  - ***Pure risk creation*:**

- Example: **Two simultaneous causes- both negligent** (Both are liable)

  - Both of the fires fail the but-for test because the other fire would have destroyed the house.

  - It would be ridiculous/unfair for the plaintiff not to recover because the fire isn't a but for cause

  - The law chooses to threaten too much liability rather than too little.

- Example: **Two simultaneous cause- one negligent, one not:** (Can go either way)

  - But for test fails again

  - ***Fariness* question** if the negligent party should be held liable, since the other non-negligent fire would have destroyed it.

  - **Policy:** Some courts impose liability on the N party, some don't.

> If you impose liability, it will give a party the incentive to take precautions against harms that will occasionally occur anyway.

- Example: **Sequential causes** (Only first is liable)

  - "Pre-emptive" cause- one fire arrives before the other on the house. It causes the actual physical harm, but neither is a "but for" cause of the harm.

  - "Moral luck"- only the first fire is held liable, even if 2^nd^ was also guilty

  - **Policy:** ***Blameworthiness**-* D shouldn't be held liable if there's nothing left to harm?

  - **Arguing out of having to pay:** Distinction between risk having materialized (car crash breaks my leg and I have terminal cancer- only pay for 8 months of leg time) and not materializing yet in the moment when the accident happens (car crash breaks my leg and I miss flight that crashes- you pay for my leg lifetime) Argument that you should only pay for 1 second of house time if it was going to get burned down anyway.

**"[Joint]{.underline}"**

- Two defendants liable to the P for the same harm.

- It's impossible to determine whose negligence caused what part of the injury. Theoretically indivisible harm and practical indivisible harm- the P is driving and hit by 2 cars, it would be difficult to figure out who caused what harm

- Acting in concert (joint enterprise)

**[Questions of Proof]{.underline}**

**[(Useful in policy question if you're trying to figure out how to hold parties liable)]{.underline}**

- A P has been injured but cannot prove which of several possible Ds was more probably than not the actual cause of his or her injury, (*See Summers*)

- Or a D has injured some but not all P, and they cannot prove which of them the D injured. (See *DES* cases)

**[Preponderance]{.underline}**

- Usually the P has to persuade the jury that her version of the facts is "more likely than not" what occurred; related to *but for* causation.

- Problem w/ preponderance anytime that it's not "more likely than not" that this caused the injury. Will have to employ a different tactic.

> \- If you have 2 people and you can't prove that one of them more likely than not caused it (See *Summers*- each is 50% likely)
>
> \- Lost chance doesn't seem like there's preponderance (see *Matsuyama*), but if you rescope the injury- not to death but to the probability of this happening?

**[Alternative Liability- Burden of Proof shifting]{.underline}**

- Imposing liability on negligent Ds, each of who is equally likely to have harmed the plaintiff.

*-* **Pros:**

- ***Deterrence/Fairness:*** Don't want to exonerate the defendants, even though both were negligent and the injury resulted from the negligence of only one of them.

- Doesn't allow gun makers, for example, to get away by making their products non-descript.

\- **Cons:**

- If someone was not negligent, you shouldn't be held liable because there's a chance the act was non-tortious.

- Undermines ***Corrective Justice-*** The person that harmed isn't the person paying.

***-* [Case]{.underline}: *Summers v. Tice* (Burden Shifted to Ds- show they didn't commit harm)**

- Both fired a gun and one or the other injured P.

  - Burden shifted to Ds to show who didn't commit the harm, if both cannot make the showing, both will be held liable for plaintiff's loss.

  - D's actions were the same, chances were equal that either caused the harm, no logical way to decide who caused it.

  - Note that burden isn't shifted just because there are several actors, it's also when identical that plaintiff will basically not be able to tell it apart

  - Courts comfort level will be higher in cases involving two defendants

    - Only want to apply when the defendant is so nearly "more probably than not" the cause of the harm

<!-- -->

- Applied people with some connection acting in the same arena.

- Distinguish from MSC- Only 1 of the Ds did what the other didn't (should be free of liability). In MSC, several of the Ds acted.

- Doesn't take into account comparative negligence.

  - Want to apply this, and not jt./several because then their comparative negligence may be taken into account ("were you at the wrong place?")

- The more than 2 people, there's less of a chance that each did it so the court is uncomfortable imposing liability (33%, 33%, 33% if there's 3 actors).

**[Market Share Liability- A D has injured a P, but not sure which Ps]{.underline}**

- Many courts reject market-share liability outright

  - Only about 1/3 have applied it to DES cases, a few courts have applied it to lead pigment and other products

**- Factors:**

**(1) Identical product**

**(2)Signature disease**

**(3) Market?**

- Absolute market share: everyone is liable for their actual market share, P gets incomplete recovery.

- Relative market share: hold defendants liable for what their market share would be among the existing companies

> **(4) D can exculpate** if the product wasn't manufactured for the use; wasn't in the market. (consistent w/ tort law aims)
>
> **(5) P can prove specific defendant caused its harm**

**- Pros:**

- ***Deterrence/Fairness**-* Don't want to exonerate Ds when they're N just because we can't tell who was the culprit.

- ***Social Recourse***

- ***Pure Risk Creation:*** They're not being held liable for actual harms, they're being held liable for the risk they put out into the argument.

**- Cons:**

- Over or under imposition in most cases because of...

- How do you decide the market? State, nation, local?

- May not recover fully (absolute market); Ds will have to pay extra (relative market)

- Doesn't work if there are other causes or products aren't identical.

- D can only be exculpated if they didn't market it for the purpose it was used.

- P can prove they took a specific drug, and they can go sue the company itself.

- **Policy:** Good for deterrence, bad for corrective justice- you don't get to correct the harm between the parties that harmed each other.

**[Case:]{.underline} *Hymowitz v. Eli Lilly* (DES)**

**- Facts:** Mothers begin developing cancer and complications years later.

Questions/Answers about Market Share Liability from *Hymowitz*

- Signature Disease? Yes

- Identical products? Yes

- Which market? National (Data is better; drug may have been taken in another state; regional may mean no recovery for P; fairness across states if everyone uses national market.)

- Plaintiff can prove a specific defendant's liability & sue for all injuries? Yes (?)

- Defendant can exculpate self here? No (Dissent says this would be consistent w/ causation in tort law)

**-** Why couldn't we apply alternative liability here?

- DES manufacturers would be in no better position to know about causation; shifting burden to them wouldn't work to resolve the issue.

- Many companies weren't around anymore so shouldn't shift burden to them.

**[Pure Risk Creation]{.underline}**

- Tort law doesn't want to assign liability just for risk creation.

- 

**[Lost Chance]{.underline}**

**Lost Chance**-

- Already ill injured or ill plaintiff, whose chances of recovery or survival are reduced by the negligent actions of the defendant

<!-- -->

- *Lost chance* doesn't necessarily mean *death* (*Matsuyama*)

- [A theory of injury, not causation]{.underline}. (Cancer didn't recur at all, but the D still suffered an injury)

  - The lost chance is the injury!

  - Is actually calculable in the moment, not predictive in the future. (Can be closely related to disease's progression)

  - Re-scoping the injury just from death to the decrease in chances of survival, recurrence in cancer, etc. (although sometimes is only recoverable under death; wouldn't have recovered if no negligence and death!)

  - Re-scoping to avoid clash w/ but for causation (Because we can't say that but for the malpractice, the person would have lived or wouldn't have gotten sick again!)

- [Preponderance]{.underline}: there is still the requirement that the doctor's negligence be more than 50% probable of causing the lost chance.

  - If we didn't rescope injury, a patient wouldn't be able to recover unless they came with more than an even chance of recovery (bad for ***Deterrence***).

- It's in conformance with comparative negligence- the doctor is responsible for the % of lost chance that he is responsible for, while the victim is responsible for "their part" (the naturally occurring part.)

- In some cases, lost chance is only recoverable when it does lead to death (see *Mastuyama*)

  - (Drop from 39🡪 25% chance of survival; decedent dies)

    - Solved by proportional approach: 15%\--\> 15% of wrongful death paid.

<!-- -->

- Consider: the risks may last a lifetime (once it's lowered, more susceptible), this accounts for it; the risks may cause emotional (and additional physical trauma). Not in every situation; importance of bodily integrity in torts.

  - Different from a pedestrian's risk of being hit by a car doesn't last forever.

- **Cons**

- Don't usually do this predictive analysis because it's difficult to figure out how the chances were decreased.

  - Evidence is better in medical field rather than the medical practice/ life priority- we don't hold 911 operators liable.

- Only fully deters if those who survive sue too, otherwise defendant's aren't being punished for their harmful contact to those people.

- **Fronteir** **Lost Chance & Risk Creation:** LOST CHANCE DOESN'T ACCOUNT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T SUE. Is there a way for us to take into account this pure risk created? Punitive damages?

  - 100 people, \$10 million per person.

  - Their chances w/negligence are 10%; their chances without negligence are 40%- that's a 30% difference.

  - Out of every 100 people, 10 will survive, 90 will die. Only those 90 sue.

  - 90 x 30%= \$270 payout; payout should have been 300\$

**Cases-**

***Matsuyama v.* Birnbaum- Redefine the injury**

- **Facts:** Dr. Birnbaum was primary care physician of Matsuyama. M had risk of gastric cancer and doctor didn\'t test for it. Went for initial pains in 1998, didn\'t get right test until 1999. Died of cancer. Expert witness testified in trial that Dr. B breached the expected standard of care.

- **Rule/Policy:** Physician was liable. Limit "lost chance" to medical negligence cases. Health care providers can maximize survival chances; deterrence

**[Allocation of Money: Joint and Several Liability]{.underline}**

- When two or more defendants are liable to the P for the same harm

  - All joint tortfeasors have to have made all necessary contribution to the harm.

  - Harm wouldn't have happened but for the combined negligence of tortfeasors.

- Each D is liable as if he were the sole wrongdoer, but responsible for the entirety of the P's damages. P can recover from either, but cannot recover more than the total damages awarded.

- Allocated by statutes

- *Traditional ways*:

  - **Olde Jt./Several system**- You sued any of the tort feasors and they paid 100%, they could collect from other defendants.

  - **Jt./Several w/ contribution**- Presumes that the P gets 100% compensated and the Ds figure it out between each other.

    - Basically- one D responsible for all damages- but can collect from others

    - D had risk of Defendant insolvency

    - CL was allowing windfall to the defendant who didn't pay but states have remedied that with statutes that create rights of contribution among jointly and severally liable tortfeasors- they can be reimbursed.

- *Modern ways*:

  - **Jt/Sv. + Pure Comp N**: P pays for his N; and defendants too according to contribution. **(More P friendly)**

    - Many states now assess contribution of shares of co-defendants in proportion to amount of negligence attributable to each co-defendant (like comparative negligence)

    - If one person is insolvent, the other Ds are liable for judgment. (burden on Ds)

  - **Several**: Each person is liable for their own share, not each others. **(More D friendly)**

    - If one person is insolvent, P doesn't recover (burden on P).

    - **BP** -- collect independently and P bears the risk.

- 3 situations in which this is mainly imposed: (Don't focus on this as much, this is more about paying than the causation itself)

  - Joint tortfeasors: joint enterprise and one is negligent.

  - "Joint" -- theoretically or practically indivisible harm (we don't know how much harm was caused by whom)

  - Traditional: foreseeability

  - Modern: (3^rd^ restatement): Harm w/in the foreseeable risk.

> **\*\* Draw on categories from the past to inform the modern standard\*\***
>
> **\*\*The Davis case is a good example of how the 1^st^ Circuit is taking the language from all off the categories- foreseeable harm, type, harm within the risk\*\***

- **Foreseeability (Traditional)**:

<!-- -->

- The harm was a foreseeable result of the defendant's actions.

- Two-step analysis:

  - Was the defendant negligent?

  - Was the harm a foreseeable result of the D's negligence?

- Type/ Plaintiff could be used to escape liability; Extent/manner couldn't.

<!-- -->

- **Harm-Within- the- Risk Standard (Modern):**

- Is the risk of the injury suffered one of the risks that make the defendant's conduct negligent? If the negligent act did not foreseeably increase the risk of harm, it was not foreseeable.

- **Restatement Third §29** **(Limitations on Liability for Tortious Conduct):**

  - "An actor's liability is limited to those harms that result from the risks that made the actor's conduct tortious."

    - Where the risks what made the defendant's conduct negligent in the first place?

  - **Comment D:**

    - Determine the risk by whether there was a foreseeable probability of harm?

    - Done to avoid being responsible for ALL consequences ***Fairness***

    - Court must consider all of the ranges of harm risked that the *jury* could find. ***Who Decides? Judge or Jury***

  - **Comment E, F, G:**

    - Why have scope of liability?

    - Relative simplicity; fairness and proportionality; sufficient flexibility for fairness

- **Restatement Third §36 (Harriet's Problem):**

  - "When an actor's negligent conduct constitutes only a trivial contribution to a causal set that is a factual cause of harm under §27, the harm is not within the risk of the scope of the actor's liability."

  - Look at people in groups. If Harriet is a trivial contributor, then she's not liable.

    - Harriet is a MSC if there's 7 actors all pushing at 33% and she contributes 1%

    - Harriet is a MNC if there's 3 actors pushing at 33% and she contributes 1%

- **New Jersey Jury Instructions 6.10 (So Connected)**

- **"**The basic question for you to resolve is whether \[*name of plaintiff*\]'s injury/ loss/harm is so connected with the negligent actions or actions of \[name of defendant\]

  - Proximate cause has traditional system inklings (connection.)

  - Jury can't understand technical instructions? ***Judge or Jury***

**- New Jersey Jury Instructions 6.14 (Intervening/Superceding Cause)-**

- An intervening cause is the act of an independent agency that destroys the causal connection between the defendant's \[or other party's\] negligence and the accident/incident/event or injury/loss/harm.

- To be an intervening cause the independent act must be the immediate and sole cause of the accident/incident/event or injury/loss/harm. The intervening cause must be one that *so completely supersedes the operation of* \[defendant\]'s negligence that you find that the intervening event caused the accident/incident/event or injury/loss/harm, without \[name of defendant or other party\]'s negligence contributing to it in any material way. In that case liability will not be established because \[name of defendant or other party\]'s negligence is not a proximate cause of the accident/incident/event or injury/loss/harm.

- However, \[name of defendant or other party\] would not be relieved from liability for his/her/its negligence by the intervention of acts of third persons, if those acts were reasonably foreseeable...Where the intervention of third parties is reasonably foreseeable, then there still may be a causal connection between the defendant's \[or other party's\] negligence and the accident/incident/event or injury/loss/harm

**[Cases]{.underline}**

***Berry v. Sugar Notch* (1899)(Supreme Court of PA)- Unforeseeable, Not a proximate cause**

**- Facts**: Plaintiff was driving car during windstorm. Speed limit by ordinance is 8 m/hr. Driving over speed limit when tree fell down and caused his injury. Trial Court found for P, D appeals

**- Rule**: Speed of the car did not affect plaintiff's right to recover because no foresight could have predicted this, even though the trolley wouldn't have been at that precise point had it not been speeding.

**[Traditional Foreseeability Approach]{.underline}**

- 4 different types of un-foreseeability (not self-defining and not always used by courts) Used to figure out what counts as harm within the risk and what doesn't

  - Unforeseeable plaintiff: *Palsgraf*

  - Unforeseeable extent of harm: Thin-skull rule (foreseeable P), promotes optimal deterrence, everyone has a weakness; information costs of figuring out everyone's normal level. Exception may be where it makes more sense for P to be the cheapest cost avoider

  - Unforeseeable type of harm (to a foreseeable P): *Polemis, Wagon Mound*; done case-by-case

  - Unforeseeable manner of harm: injury is foreseeable but it occurs in a bizarre manner- geographic and temporal situation matters (superseding and intervening causes)

> **Blurry Dimensions of Foreseeability**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Unforeseeable...**   **Does it matter?**
  ---------------------- ------------------------------------------------
  Type                   Y (?)- can cut both ways; can argue either way

  Plaintiff              Y

  Extent                 N

  Manner                 N
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**[Cases]{.underline}**

***In re Polemis* (1921) (English Court of Appeal)- Unforeseeable type of injury doesn't matter- still liable**

- **Facts:** Stevedores were moving benzene (flammable). Negligently caused one of the boards to fall into the hold, erupted into flames. Stevedore liable.

- **Rule:** Although the type of damage (fire) wasn't foreseeable, the defendant was liable because his conduct was a "direct cause" of the P's injury.

- **Policy:** "Direct cause" language may still be used; but language may suggest cutting-off where subsequent conduct intervenes.

***The Wagon Mound* (1961) (Australia)- Unforeseeable type of injury does matter -- not liable**

- **Facts:** Wagon Mound discharged oil into bay. First injury: concentrated near plaintiff\'s wharf. Plaintiff inspected, resumed welding and burning taking precautions. Second injury: Oil didn\'t move after 2 days, ignited, spread. Wagon Mound not liable.

- **Rule:** It was foreseeable that the oil would cause other damage to the dock but not a fire.

***Palsgraf v. Long Island RR* (1928) (NY Ct. of Appl.; Cardozo)- Zone of Proximity/Proximate Cause**

**- Facts:** Man trying to catch the train, jumps aboard, railroad employee grabbing him and the other is pushing him. Package falls, fireworks explode, stampede, scales hit Mrs. P.

**- Rule:** The case couldn't go to the jury as a matter of law because, although RR had duty of reasonable care towards Mrs. P, RR didn't breach that duty because the harm to her was not a foreseeable risk of the D's conduct. (Cardozo has approached liability through *no breach of duty*(N) )

\- **Cardozo:** The guard doesn't have a duty to the P (only to the person being pushed) because unforeseeable P is outside of the zone of danger.

\- There must be a relational connection between DF and PL**.** (You've breached your duty to a person if you've created a foreseeable risk to them; time and proximity make a zone of danger within which the person is foreseeable plaintiff.)

**- Dissent (Andrews):** There is a duty to the world, not just relational duties (proximate cause is a fact/jury question)

> \- Consider: (1) natural and continuous sequence, (2) not too many intervening causes; (3) is N likely to create that effect; (4) foreseeable post-N effect (5) not too remote in time and place.

\*\* **Proximate cause was established (Andrews) but what defines the orbit of danger is foreseeability like what we have now with foreseeable increase in risk (Cardozo).\*\***

***Smith v. Leech Brain (1962)*- Arguing out of type of harm into extent of harm**

**- Facts:** Worker burned on the lip by piece of molten metal because the defendant was negligent in not providing adequate shielding. Wound never healed, developed into a cancer. Worker had been predisposed to cancer by work in the gas industry.

***-* Rule:** Take the victim as you find them. You could have foreseen they would be burned.

**[Cheapest Cost Avoider]{.underline}**

Cheapest Cost Avoider Version 1 (Calabresi):

- Aims: Optimal (General/Market) Deterrence -- to minimize (injury costs + precaution costs)

  - Minimize costs (sum of loss= injury losses - precaution costs; BPL)

  - Minimize externalities (Costs to 3^rd^ persons)

- Assign losses (who should bear cost)

  - Cheapest cost avoider should bear cost, hold liable if doesn't

- Assign to whom

  - Knows the risk or harms

  - Knows the precautions possible

  - Knows the tort law

  - Will be making a choice (you need *but-for* causation for N)

- What's Missing?

  - Morality/justice/distribution (think of the school children as not necessarily always the best) ***Justice/Morality***

  - Fact-specific- circumstances that one person or the other may change from day to day

**[Case that incorporates it all:]{.underline}**

***Davis v. United States* (2012) (US Ct. of Appl., 1^st^ Ct.) Type of harm**

**- Facts:** Bulger and Flemmi kill both women, were designated as top informants. Murder several people, and FBI knows about it. FBI helps them avoid prosecution. P argues that the FBI caused the women's deaths in utilizing the two men and not controlling them.

**- Rule:**  **-** The FBI is liable for the women's deaths.

\- The lower court's finding that the FBI negligence was a but for cause (more likely than not) of the deaths of the women is not clear error. And government says, even if a but for cause- they couldn't have foreseen the women plaintiffs.

\- BUT they could have foreseen that dangerous men would harm someone (it is irrelevant they didn't know the specific harm, they knew the *general kind of harm.*)

\- "The threat to others was in broad terms foreseeable; and the FBI agent's actions were not merely negligent but reckless in the extreme."

(see type, foreseeability, flavors of harm within the foreseeable risk.)

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Strict Liability**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Liability imposed in the **absence of negligence** by the defendant when an activity is abnormally dangerous, nuisance.

**[Good candidates for SL (Summary):]{.underline}**

- **Destructive:** Activities that destroy evidence. (*See Information Costs/Activity Levels*)

- **High danger w/ little social worth:** Posner: Keeping a tiger is stupid so we don't want to incentivize by having ordinary care defense to be available. (*See Activity Levels*)

- **New Activities** (*See Influencing Research Decisions*)

- **Only beneficiary**: (*See rights based: libertarian, reciprocity*)

- **Activity level**: Posner: tendency to apply to new activities until we find out more info. (*See Activity* levels)

- **People that can manage costs** (because of insurance or because CCA)**:** Activities where the person engaging in the activity is in the best position to insure or distribute costs of non-negligently caused accidents. (*Promoting insurance*?)

**[Theories of Strict Liability]{.underline}**

**- Reducing Information and Error Costs:**

- Pros: Figuring out N is a highly fact-intensive process, involves cost and time; SL can reduce litigation costs per case. Trials may be shorter or may not need to occur in SL; rate of error is lower because no factual determination needs to be made(?)

  - Cons: Need to consider costs of litigation of additional cases as a whole

**- Influencing Activity and Research Decisions:**

- Pros: Gives more reason to consider alternative methods of conducting activities; gives research incentives to find cost-effective methods to reduce activities- so may be good for new activities.

- Cons: what if there are no alternatives? Only slight potential accident reduction; Doesn't really result in more deterrence within the activity (cheaper to continue to cause accidents than to avoid them- I'll be liable anyway!)

  - 

\- **Promoting Insurance or Broad Distribution of Losses:**

- Pros: Injurers may be in the best position to insure or broadly distribute the costs of non-negligently caused accidents.

- Cons: victims might sometimes end up being the people who shoulder the cost. (think of a community, prices go up)

\-**Rights-Based Theories:**

- [Benefit theory]{.underline}: Those who benefit should bear the cost

- [Reciprocity theory]{.underline}: if you create an excessive risk relative to the victim

- [Libertarian]{.underline}: when you cause an invasion of privacy to others.

\- **Posner's take:**

\- Thinks SL is best for activity levels. If you can manage risk by taking better care, then negligence can handle by incentivizing reasonable care.

- Rationale in *Indiana*: court error, industry burdens, who's the true CCA?

\- **Modern Conceptions:**

- [Restatment 2^nd^]{.underline}: "abnormally dangerous activities"

  - *Dangerousness* factors:

    - [(1) High degree of risk of some harm;]{.mark}

    - [(2) Probability that the harm that results will be great]{.mark}

    - [(3) Inability to eliminate the risk by the exercise of reasonable care;]{.mark}

  - *Commonness* factors:

    - [(4) Extent to which the activity is not a matter of common usage;]{.mark}

    - [(5) \[Inappropriateness of the activity to the place where it is carried on\] \*\*^kind\ of\ the\ same\ thing\ as\ (4)^]{.mark}

  - [(6) Extent to which its value to the community is outweighed by its dangerous attributes\*\*]{.mark}

- [[Restatement 3^rd^]{.underline}:]{.mark}

  - Whether the activity was foreseeable

  - Dangerousness

  - Commonness- *Extent to which the activity is not a matter of common usage*.

  - [Gets rid of the last 2 factors- bring them up when they weigh: ("traditionally this was considered...")]{.mark}

**Negligence or SL?**

- SL is **activity-based**, N is **act-based**

  - Argue SL if possible if you're P (& it fits these categories), you want to argue N (and took due care) if you're D.

  <!-- -->

  - For ***Blameworthiness***: N is the main thing in torts. You didn't take reasonable care and you harmed someone.

  - For ***Fairness***: N may be better. If people do their best, they should get a free pass sometimes.

  - For ***CCA***: SL is only a gain if the cost of insuring people through tort system by making people pay their way is less than the cost of a potential victim buying insurance in the market. - Posner

  - For ***Deterrence***:

    - Free Pass of N: If you cause 100 accidents non-negligently, not liable. Doesn't promote optimal deterrence.

    - SL: imposes liability even when it's cheaper to take care than to risk the harm, so people won't invest in avoiding accidents- they'll be liable anyway.

      - But Posner says people will do BPL analysis and still take care.

  - AND there's always an SL component:

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Rule for DF**     **Effect on PL**
  ------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------
  No L                Like SL

  SL                  Like no L

  N                   Like SL, unless D is N (or like no L, unless DF is not N)

  N + Contrib. N      Like SL, unless P isn't N and DF is N

  Pure Comp.          Like SL- pure comp N (minus Df's share of N)

  N + Pure Comp. N    Like SL, unless D is N -- Pure comp. N

  SL+ Cont. N         Like N+ contrib. N (unless PL is N and D is not)

  SL + Cont. N        Like N (unless P is N)

  SL + Comp. N        Like pure comp. N (for PL)
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> **[Traditional Strict Liability]{.underline}**

\- SL for injuries caused by \"ultra-hazardous" activities

\- After *Rylands,* American courts rejected SL outright because they thought it did away with N- then began to bring in SL as exceptions of general N rule.

[Non-natural land use]{.underline}

***Rylands v. Fletcher*** **(1866 & 1868)(UK)**- **Traditional SL- made exception to negligence-only regime**

\- **Facts:** P was damaged by his property being flooded when D\'s reservoir broke out. D had created a reservoir, defect in soil. Engineers and contractors had no idea of the defects. People employed by them became aware of shafts filled up with soil that communicated with old workings. Re-emergence of SL, separated from old system of trespass; working against backdrop of negligence.

\- **Rule:** "anything that escapes" + "non-natural" land use.

Appeals court: SL for damage caused by \"anything that escapes"

\- No N on Ryland's part---blame free plaintiff

> \- Mentions list of things that can "escape" and cause "mischief;" like beasts- tame v. vicious distinction.

Supreme Court: SL for "artificial"/"non-natural" use- "pushing boundaries of safety."

\- **Policy:** *Rylands* is the cheapest cost-avoider. (Calebresi v. 1)

Reciprocity theory- D getting improvement, then D pays.

[Animals]{.underline}

- Vicious/wild/dangerous propensity + foreseeable and known- SL

- Escape/trespass- SL

- Owner's actions- N (?)

***Doerr v. Goldsmith* (2013)- Owner's actions, not dog's actions caused harm so N, not SL, not going to change the rule for animals.**

- **Facts-** Plaintiff was riding his bicycle around Central Park. Goldsmith was holding onto dog in a manner that was hugging, Smith was bending down and clapping hands. Dog was in the middle of the road, collided with it and flew off. Doesn\'t claim that dog\'s actions were vicious.

- Court analogizes this to a football, looks more like N

- **Rule-** An accident involving an animal can never have claim for N, only recover in SL on a showing that the owner knew of vicious propensities.

- This case is about actions of a person that turned animal into an instrumentality of harm, it was the D's actions, not the dog's behavior that most proximately caused the accident.

 

***Horse cases***

\- A horse bits a kid at a farm. Is this natural behavior? (Very important for idea of SL)

\- Deciding not to categorize horses for SL, it's a case-by-case scenario, but the court says that it's their natural inclination to bite (splitting the difference to stay in N while tipping the scale to say it's foreseeable and it's going to be hard to argue against N.)

**[Modern Approach]{.underline}**

-Strict Liability for "Abnormally Dangerous" Activities

\- Factors to assess SL (From 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ Restatement- Dangerous & Commonness)

- Dangerousness: (High degree of risk, probability of harm, inability to eliminate risk by exercise of reasonable care\*\*)

- Commonness: (Extent to which activity is uncommon\*\*, inappropriateness to area)

- AND value of activity to community outweighed by dangerousness\*^least\ important^

  - Shows tendency for case-by-case analysis. (less generality, but more flexibility)

***Indiana Harbor Belt RR v. American Cyanamid* (1990) (Posner) No SL- when N is enough and prohibitive to industry**

\- **Facts:** American Cyanamid loaded 20k gallons of the chemical liquid into a railroad tank that it had leased. Employees of the switching line noticed fluid gushing out of car. It was feared that all 20 gallons had leaked, and the liquid is flammable. Evacuation, clean up ordered by Department of Environmental Protection so there\'s no soil or water contamination- cost almost a million dollars to the railroad line.

\- **Rule-** Reversed decision to hold manufacturers strictly liable.

- Probability that the leak couldn't have been prevented through reasonable care

  - Flammable, but not corrosive to weaken tank car

  - Caused by carelessness, not by the inherent properties of acrylonitrile

  - Don't use SL when N is enough!

- SL isn't going to manage activity levels cost-effectively

  - American Cyanamid is not the CCA- they don't know the route, anything about railroads;

  - If courts get it wrong- the whole industry will have to pay (many other chemicals)

  - Prohibitive to have to go around the major hubs.

- Roots of SL restatements are in 19th century ballooning cases **(*Guille v. Swan)***

  - Man landed in vegetable garden and people tried to help him off balloon, garden owner sued. Invokes SL because the value of activity is low and it's totally inappropriate to the area.

**[Defenses to SL]{.underline}**

- HWFR: There is only liability for the kind of harm whose risk makes the activity abnormally dangerous.

- Has to be a cause in fact and a proximate cause of the harm (not absolute).

- D is usually not strictly liable if harm results form act of God, unforeseeable intervention of 3^rd^ party or P's knowing and unreasonable assumption.

- Go back to CONS on top- policy reasons against it.

- Think of Posner's interpretation

  - CCA

  - Errors

  - Burdens many people when N is more flexible (industry)

- Think about the floodgates of only having to prove causation and damages

- One side gets off scot- free and has no incentive to regulate their behavior.

  **Intentional Torts: Trespass to Land/Personal Property, Conversion**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**-** Three types of property torts---trespass to land; trespass to personal property; conversion (unauthorized transfer of the plaintiff's personal property to 3^rd^ party's possession.)

**[Trespass]{.underline}**

**- Trespass:** D breaches/ touches the boundary of P\'s real or personal property, or otherwise physically interferes with the P\'s right of possession, which includes the right to exclude others from occupying or using the property. Trespass protects interest in exclusive possession of land or thing.

\- No intent to trespass necessary, only to be present in the place/act -- **Trespass is a SL tort- don't need fault; you don't negligence type analysis BPL that you do in nuisance.**

\- Actionable without proof of actual harm/damage

**Evolution of Trespass?**

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Elements of trespass**   **Classic hard edges**                                               **Modern approach**
  -------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------
  Entry?                     Persons, things (Tangible)                                           Energy (intangible) + persons, things (tangible)

  Intent?                    To act/be there (not that you knew it was someone else's property)   (?)- *Reynolds* muddies this up

  Fault? (same as N)         Not needed                                                           

  Harm?                      Not needed                                                           Not needed (but feelings count)
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\*\*Trespass has a strict liability component (don't need to show harm), while using N you'd have to show harm\*\*

**[Cases]{.underline}**

***Martin v. Reynolds* (1959)- Trespass**

**- Facts-** Martin sues for damages to land caused by invisible fluoride compounds that settled on the land from a nearby aluminum reduction plant run by defendant. (Livestock was poisoned)

**- Rule-**

- Entry: Particles and similar (intangible) substances count under the law of trespass (energy rather than size)

- Harm: Irrespective of harm, if feelings of ownership or possession are hurt, you're liable (change from old regime where you needed to have trespass).

- Intent: It's unclear here if the factory meant to do this but "what comes up must come down.")

\- **Policy:** Muddies up the area between trespass and nuisance. This could have been either.

> **[Personal Property: Conversion & Trespass to Chattels]{.underline}**

\- Personal property torts: 1) Show injury 2) Define the thing

**[Conversion-Trespass to Chattels Spectrum (Personal Property)]{.underline}**

> **Less interference \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--\\?\\\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--More interference**

**(Trespass to chattels) (Conversion)**

> 🡨 No interference, No nominal \$

**-Trespass to Chattels:** need to show some adverse effects (less than conversion)

**-** Less interference

\- Damages are given

\- **Conversion** (forced sale)

\- A lot of interference (total deprivation

\- Money given is the full value and damages.

\- **Conversion**: Unauthorized transfer of the P\'s personal property to a 3^rd^ party possession.

- **Rule**: For conversion you must show: *(See Kremen*)

  - 1\) Ownership or right to possession of property,

  - 2\) Wrongful disposition of property right

    - Permanently or indefinitely

    - Deprives plaintiff

    - Inconsistent with plaintiffs ownership, and

  - 3\) Damages

<!-- -->

- **For intangible property: Restatement**:

  - Needs to be merged into a document that represents the thing (i.e. stock certificate)

  - Counterargument: Courts (9^th^ circuit) don't need to strictly follow restatement (stocks, CDs and phonographs- no identity in the tangible thing) Just need to show its property.

***Kremen v. Cohen (*2003)(US 9^th^ Circt.)-Conversion**

- **Facts:** Kremen registers the domain name sex.com from the company Network Solutions. He registers the site to the name of his business Online Classifieds. Cohen sends Network Solutions a letter stating that OC doesn\'t have Kremen isn't employee anymore, they\'re relinquishing it back to NS. Without, checking they transfer it to Cohen. Cohen turns it into profitable enterprise. Suing Network Solutions for conversion because you can't get any money from Cohen who's fled.

- **Rule**: NS is liable to Cohen.

- It meets the -- ownership or right to possession, wrongful disposition (permanently deprives the P, inconsistent with the P's ownership) and damages

- But is there even a tangible property right? Restatement says about intangible conversion- it needs to be merged into a document that represents the thing (i.e. stock certificate)

  - But 9^th^ circuit doesn't strictly follow restatement (stocks, CDs and phonographs- no identity in the tangible thing)

  - Just need to show its property. Says it's not a new tort duty- way it's been done forever.

**- Policy/Application**- Floodgates of ownership are opened if it can be any intangible benefit. Think of ways to cut off: public recognition of property:

***Intel v. Hamidi* (2003) (CA Supr. Ct.)- No injury, not a trespass to chattels**

- **Facts:** Hamidi was an Intel engineer, fired. He anonymously obtained a list of Intel\'s email addresses and sent 6 mass emails to these addresses reaching as many as 35,000 people at one time criticizing Intel. It informed recipients they could remove themselves from the mailing list. Intel made various efforts to block the messages. Messages prompted discussions between managers.

- **Rule:**

- It would be acting rashly to adopt a rule treating computer servers as real property for purposes of trespass law.

- Personal property torts differ from real property (land) torts: 1) Show injury 2) define the thing & there is no injury here.

- **Policy/Ways to Argue:**

- Could argue that this is a new situation, more like land where you don't have to show injury physically.

- Or argue that this is a trespass- cyberspace. (clear, hard-lined rule, intent wouldn't matter, wouldn't need to show harm). Huang believes this case could have been decided either way.

**[Nuisance]{.underline}**

\- Like negligence because you're weighing the utility of conduct.

\- On-going tort; protects interest in enjoyment and use of land.

<!-- -->

- [Section 829A (Look at equities]{.underline}): the gravity of an invasion outweighs its utility whenever the harm caused is both substantial and greater than the plaintiff should be required to bear without compensation (squishy)

  - Translation: If its substantial and more than the Plaintiff should have to bear, then you employ a balance of the equities, you look at what's fair instead of looking at BPL, they should probably be compensated even if it's of utility.

**[Private Nuisance]{.underline}**

- Public nuisance is not a tort- it's a low-level quasi criminal offense that affects the public

- Private nuisance is a tort- affects a particular entity or individual

- Intentional? Apply Unreasonableness analysis: (Gravity of harm v. Utility of Conduct)

  - Considerations in determining nuisance:

    - Coming to the nuisance -- but court may yield once neighborhood has formed. Balance of equities, it's a

  - Remedies- critical because substantial difference usually between harm and cost to D to stop activity.

    - No nuisance; P enjoins D (traditional remedy- injunction and damages); D compensates P (discontinuing it is greater than the cost from permitting it to continue); P compensates D (P pays only if it's worth to get rid of it)

    - Injunctions are strong entitlements (party entitled cannot be forced to sell it; holder decides price.), damages are weak entitlements (another party can force to sell, jury sets price)

***Boomer v. Atlantic Cement Co.* (1970)- Private nuisance: P wins- D pays servitude on land**

**- Facts**- Defendant operates large cement plant. P brings action for injunction and damages because of injury to property from dirt, smoke, and vibration emanating from plant. Factory cost 45 million dollars, causing 150 K in harm.

**- Rule-** Court grants injunction that will be vacated upon payment by the D of such amounts of permanent damage to the respective plaintiffs as shall for this purpose be determined by the court.

\- Court goes against traditional NY law to grant permanent injunction for nuisance because of costs of losing jobs, shutting down and comparison with the harm.

\- Damages for total economic losses ("servitude on the land")

**- Policy**: D has the upper hand to negotiate.

\- Gravity v. utility analysis: here the utility outweighed the harm.

***Spur v. Del Webb-* Coming to the nuisance; D wins- P pays costs of moving**

**- Facts-** Defendant has a pre-existing cattle feedlot operation and plaintiff developers made residential units---smell and flies made it impossible to sell.

**- Rule**- Court says the plaintiff to relocate or and pay for an injunction if he wants him to stop. (Limited holding to developers coming to agricultural areas)

**[Defenses (Private/Public Necessity)]{.underline}**

- Private or public necessity- the D acted reasonably in damaging or destroying P's property to avoid harm to his or her own property

- **Public necessity**: risk to property of large number of people to make the risk public; Absolute defense; tear down the house before it burns down the entire town.

- **Private necessity**: There is a risk to one party only, conditional privilege.

  - Conditional privilege: when property rights are suspended and the D is privileged to use the P's property, The D is obligated to pay for any damage that results.

    - Why? The person didn't choose to damage, only risk damaging, and they are innocent too. Breaks the moral tie.

    - If you can, contract ahead of time!

**[Cases]{.underline}**

***Ploof v. Putnam*- Private Necessity (D is liable to P)**

- **Facts-** P moore sloop at dock on a private island during storm, D\'s servant cut loose the sloop, sloop and contents were destroyed

- **Rule-** When there's private necessity, you're not trespassing. Award to plaintiff recognizes necessity privilege, D is liable for damages.

- Conflicts with *Vincent*.

***Vincent v. Lake Erie* (1910)- Private Necessity; Conflicts with *Ploof*- No N, moral tie-breaker**

- **Facts**- Defendant was discharging cargo moored to plaintiff\'s dock. Storm came with much violence, the lines were kept fast and the boat was thrown against the dock causing damage. Dockowner suing boat owner for damages.

- **Rule**- No negligence anywhere, so we're just picking who to stick the costs with.

- Moral tie-breaker (property rights explanation): whoever breaks it, pays for it.

> **[Rationale for Cost Distribution]{.underline}**

- **Property Rights Explanation**:

  - Sometimes liability for damages caused when necessity stems from the **foreseeability** of harm.

  - Conditional privilege- property rights are suspended and the D is privileged to use the P's property but has to pay for the damage that results.

  - **The appropriate tort liability rule determines the scope** of the dock owner's property rights.

- **Deterrence/Resource Allocation Explanation**:

  - A party with liability threatened has an **incentive to compare the cost of liability** with the cost of alternatives that may avoid liability.

  - **Cons:** Do we make this cost benefit analysis in our head?

- **Coase Theorem** (Law doesn't matter- people will bargain to get the most efficient alternative) -- **contracting around the law- just put it on someone!!**

  - **Scenario:** Factory sending toxic fumes to school. If we hold the factory liable, factory still pays the school for \$40 fan if it's the cheapest way to avoid. No liability to the factory, the school can get \$40 fan or pay the factory \$51 (\$50 scrubber plus \$1 incentive) to avoid cost.

  - **Bargaining in advance** about what will happen may will help solve problem

  - If we want people to engage in these **cost benefit analysis, why is there an absolute privilege in cases of public necessity**?

    - Many times it was going to be destroyed anyway, there would have been no feasible way to hold the appropriate parties (in the past) liable- too many individuals and towns weren\'t incorporated into suable entities

> **Pros**:

- The parties can identify the most cost-effective approach and can inexpensively set aside the otherwise-applicable tort liability rule, then the cost of the courts adopting the wrong rule is simply the cost of setting the rule aside in advance by contract

> **Cons:**

- Problem if there are no pre-existing relationship between parties

- Assumes **low/ zero transaction costs**,

- **Also bargaining is hard** (people may not know each other, school doesn't have time).

<!-- -->

- What about additional parties besides the 2? (They may not know about bargaining, may have a cheaper, more effective solution)

<!-- -->

- Cheapest Cost Avoider v. 2: The best briber- maybe there's one party that can best bribe people, knows the precautions.

- Can this person who will facilitate discussion be the court?

> \- **Fairness**: Distributional consequences are ignored!

- School paying for fan to avoid harm it doesn't cause? Unfair.

- BUT- society is one thing represented by factory & school. We care about reducing total cost to society

- ALSO- There may be contexts where we don't care about fairness: both big businesses causing harm to others, not as concerned with justice here.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Plaintiff's Role: Contributory & Comparative Negligence**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**\*\*See these as Affirmative Defenses**

**[Contributory Negligence]{.underline}**

- A common law standard

- If plaintiff contributes even 1%, the D not liable

- Argue for adoption, phasing out of it: May be established by CL (like in Maryland), and turned into comparative negligence through statute or by a CL decision. (See CA in *Li v. Yellow Cab)***Who *decides? Courts/Legislature?***

**Plaintiff took due care**

**Yes No**

  --------------------
  No          No
  ----------- --------
  DF Liable   No\*\*

  --------------------

**Defendant took due care Yes**

> **No**

\*\*Where it bites, D didn't take due care, but neither did P, so D isn't liable.

**[Cases]{.underline}**:

***Coleman v. Soccer Association of Columbia-* Court doesn't change Cont. N to Comp. N in CL**

**- Facts:** Soccer coach contributed to injuries while jumping to grab top goal bar.

**- Rule:** Contributory negligence remains in place. 10 legislative attempts to turn system to comparative negligence, Court says it would go against jurisprudence tradition to overturn this. Dissent says that it is the Court\'s responsibility. ***Who decides? Court/Legislature?***

**- Policy**: Arguments for or against the legislature to change it: Legislature tried and failed to change it 10 times, we must defer OR legislature is stupid so we need the courts to implement this measure.

\- If there's Cont. N: D should conduct careful discovery and engage in early motion practice, P should be very aware of this defense and look out for any exceptions.

***Li v. Yellow Cab* (1975)(CA)- Court does change Cont. N to Comp. N**

**- Facts:** Two roads meet on top of a hill. Li reaches the intersection and stops and begins a left turn. The D, Phillips, passed through the intersection and collided with Li. He was traveling at 30 miles per hour (unsafe speed) and ran a yellow light. Li made a turn when a vehicle was so close that it was an immediate hazard. CA has a Cont. N statute

**- Rule:** Should the statutory contributory negligence be invulnerable? No.

\- The legislature was *announcing common law principles* through the statute.

\- Recommend "pure" apportionment statute, only the first step- will have to adopt this decision. ***Who decides? Court/Legislature?***

**- Policy:**

\- Contributory negligence criticism:

\- Inequitable (fails to distribute responsibility), extent of fault should govern liability;

\- Practical: Doesn't work as it\'s meant to (juries allow recovery in cases of contributory negligence, compromise in jury room allows for some diminution of damages because of plaintiff\'s fault- this detracts from people\'s confidence in the justice system) 25 states have abrogated the \"all or nothing rule\" and have put in place apportionment statutes.

**[Comparative Negligence]{.underline}**

- **Pure Comparative Negligence**: Deduct the percentage that the P is responsible for

  - New York statute: Amount of damages diminished *in the proportion in which the culpable conduct attributable to the claimant bears to the culpable conduct*, which caused the damages. Culpable conduct in diminution of damages is an affirmative defense, shall be pleaded and proved by party asserting the defense.

- **Modified** **Comparative Negligence**: \"Up to the point\" where plaintiff\'s negligence is equal or greater than the defendant\'s (50%). After 50% the P gets nothing.

  - **Pros**:

  - Could be easier to apply- more than half at fault, you get nothing;

  - If it was more than half your fault you shouldn't be a plaintiff (encourages right people to be suing);

  - Limits the damages and soften the blow if you're moving between contributory and comparative regimes.

  - **Cons** (*from Li v. Yellow Cab*):

  - Not fair (What about those 49-51% cases v. those 50-50% cases. One is allowed to recover and the other isn\'t?!)

  - 50-50 rule doesn\'t honor the principle espoused by the apportionment system.

***\*\**Causation is still a part of this- you can argue out of causation to say your share shouldn't be in there\*\***(See *BP)*

***US v. BP --* Ways to allocate blame, must have causal connection or won\'t have much blame**

**- Facts**- BP has had a hand in everything (in charge, have ultimate test interpretation, have more room to deliberate). Transocean had crew that ran and interpreted tests. Halliburton did shoddy cement job- but causal connection with injury isn't there- didn't cause the blowout.

**- Rule-** BP pays 67%, Transocean pays 30%, Halliburton pays 3%.

**- Policy/Application-** Think of other ways to divide Comp. N have been divided up. By number of parties (what was done here, then moved blame around within), by number of things each did wrong, by what would help deterrence the most (BP should have gotten more?). This stuff is made up.

\- These are multiple necessary causes

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Remedies**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**[Types of Remedies]{.underline}**

**Remedies at law (jury):**

- Compensatory damages,

- Punitive damages,

- Nominal damages

**Remedies in equity (judge):**

- Injunctions (permanent);

- Preliminary injunctions/TROs

**Other:**

- Statutory damages, civil penalties, fees, apologies (civil rights, international violations), settlements

**[Aims of Remedies]{.underline}**

- ***Corrective Justice*** or providing civil recourse for compensating P injured.

- Promoting deterrence (***Optimal/Absolute Deterrence*)**

- Recognizing social and individual significance of the P\'s loss (***Civil Recourse)***; and

- Confirming the weight of the D\'s responsibility for that loss (***Social Grievance***)

- Law of negligence tends to afford more protection from physical injury and property loss than emotional/pure economic loss.

  - Physical health is more important to the pursuit of everything else. Imposing liability for property damage tends to protect from physical damage as well since they\'re so interrelated.

> **[Compensatory Damages]{.underline}**

- **Compensatory Damages:** P is entitled to be made whole, compensate for losses and consequential loss may be accounted too

<!-- -->

- **Pecuniary**: Out of pocket or tangible monetary losses, typically consist mainly of healthcare expenses, include lost earning and lost earning capacity, property damage.

<!-- -->

- **Non-pecuniary damages**: For non-economic losses, **\"pain and suffering\"** and include intangible losses like emotional suffering, loss of life\'s enjoyment and substitute them possibly

  - ***Optimal deterrence*** to encourage potential Ds to consider these harms and not just pecuniary (accounting for full level of harm).

  - Help pay for attorney's fees if there's contingency-fee

  - Not traditionally recoverable in property! (Pets starting to change that)

<!-- -->

- **Single Recovery Principle**

  - **Pros**: Case doesn\'t go forever: P can move on, D can plan for future, doesn't have to fear more liability

  - **Cons**: Less accuracy in estimating future damages than if evaluated periodically, discount made in present value, may or may not use inflation rates (will vary by jury); P must be good investor for \$ to last.

    - Note- you can't get damages for losses that haven't occurred yet- another potential downside.

- **Limitations on Awards:**

  - **Remittitur**- when a jury award is excessive, P can choose new trial or accept lower award

  - **Additur**- when an award is unduly low

  - **Dollar cap** in some states (harshest on young people who have long life ahead of them, need most care; no sacrifice for those that don't need the entire amount permitted under cap)

  - **Schedule?**(payment according to injury- death, paralysis, etc.) but this would be burdensome.

- Courts often reluctant to apply this.

- **Jury instructions for Compensatory Damages for PROPERTY LOSS (CT)**

  - If property has been totally lost: Fair market value at the time of conversion with simple interest at a rate of 10% per year from conversion to verdict.

  - If property has been returned: recover the reduction in the fair market value of property caused by conversion.

> **\*\*RECOVERY will vary depending on whether it was returned or totally lost.\*\***

**- "Pure" economic loss & "pure" emotional loss:**

- Not covered!

- Need a physical injury for you to be covered.

- Emotional loss- you'd need to create a standard where a reasonable person would have to foresee your feelings being hurt;

  - BUT proof is difficult, fraud; have limited resources so you want to incentivize those that need it most.

**[Cases-]{.underline}**

***532 Madison Ave. v. Finlandia* (2001)- No "duty" for pure economic loss**

- **Facts:** Wall collapses and falls onto Madison Av and 55th street. Closure of blocks that lasts 2 weeks. Businesses suing for economic loss only, no property or personal injury.

- **Rule:** The construction site had no duty to the businesses for pure economic loss. Cutting off liability like past cases have been- concern that liability would extend to the whole block.

- **Policy:** Judicial concern with crushing liability.

***Strauss v. Belle Realty* (1985)(NY)-**

- **Facts:** Strauss' building gets electricity from ConEd. He's injured on the darkened stairs of the apartment building. Sues ConEd. Appellate Division held that ConEd didn't owe him a duty since he is a non-customer.

- **Rule**- Orbit of duty limits liability to manageable levels, even though traditionally would've been able to get recovery. Arbitrary line drawn to where the liability is limited to just the customers (similar to *Moch*). No privity.

- **Application**: Duty is a question for the judge.

***Dunlop v. Beck**-* Defendant's duty to them was because of direct physical injury

**[Injunctions]{.underline}**

**[Cases]{.underline}**

***eBay v. MercExchange* (2006)(SCOTUS)- Four Part Test for injunctions & market concerns**

\- **Facts:** Ebay and subsidiary company *Half.com* operate website with \"buy it now\" function. MercExchange holds patents, for that mechanism. Tried to negotiate but it broke down and brought suit.

**-** District court denied permanent injunction relief, only awarded damages for infringement.

\- Court of Appeals reversed saying only in exceptional positions should there not be permanent injunction granted.

**- Rule:** The Court of Appeals judgment is vacated because neither court correctly applied [4-factor framework]{.underline} to determine whether injunction is proper:

- **1. Irreparable harm**

- **2. Inadequate remedy of law**

  - 1 & 2 are kind of the same? Requirement of proof of past irreparable injury to justify injunction to prohibit future infringing behavior.

- **3. Balance of hardships between P/D**

- **4. Public interest** \*\*

  - 3 & 4- think about everyone else.

- [Market concerns]{.underline} with license access: ("A right does not equal a remedy.")

  - If MercExchange is willing to license, and don't practice themselves, it's all about \$\$ so give them \$\$.

  - If you're not using product, damages may not be proper.

**- Policy/Application**: Seen as a major change of when courts are thinking/how to give injunction.

**\*\*** Apply the test (boiled down to 2 questions) and then look at the judges' concerns: Does the market work well? Work poorly? Times are a-changing.\*\*

**[Lines of Argumentation for Injunctions (can cut both ways)]{.underline}**

- What if you're self-made and it's too expensive to produce?

- Is the court really the right person to determine the price?

- Are we letting people steal stuff and enter the market?

- Will damages lead to abuse?

- Are damages a forced sale here?

  - May devalue the patent for the holder and the licensee

- Will injunction lead to bargaining?

  - Parties will feel pressure to make a deal; risk litigation & adverse results

**[Punitive Damages]{.underline}**

**[Purposes/Rationale of PD]{.underline}**

**Purposes -- Punish or Deter:**

- Deter (Forward-looking):

  - **Complete/Absolute deterrence**

    - You want to stop it all together- stop people from doing cynical cost benefit analysis *a la Pinto*).

    - Based on gains to the defendant- take away their profits.

    - Has nothing to do with harm.

  - **Optimal Deterrence**

    - Based on harms to the plaintiff

    - Incentives to sue (companies know people will hold them accountable; compensatory may not capture)

    - Hard to detect: Reason for having a multiplier- People who don't get caught often (10% of the times) know they will have to pay 10x getting caught once.

    - It may pack on consideration for economic & emotional damages (which we don't regularly award)

- Punish (Backward looking):

  - Punishes DF's badness with regard to this PF (reprehensibility)

  - With regard to other PFs, society PFs (reprehensibility only)

**[Why Constrain Punitive Damages]{.underline}**

- Fairness (seems unfair, outrageous \$)

- Bankruptcy

- Consistency and predictability

- Hard to settle (people won't have incentive to settle if PD is unlimited; company may feel pressured if it's unlimited)

- Undermines court legitimacy

- Constitutional (due process) violations

**\*\*If I'm a state I don't care about federal common law; I do care about BMW/SF/Philip Morris- constitutional principles/due process.\*\***

**\*\*& CONSIDER HOW THIS COMPARES WITH STATUTORY DAMAGES- USED IN *TENEBAUM*\*\***

**[How to argue the chart:]{.underline}**

- **Where would Exxon be useful** **if it's not maritime?**

  - If you have a federal law punitive damages case (even if not Maritime);

  - Persuasive in a case where you need to cut off liability;

  - In a case where you have similar environmental events.

- **Where is BMW/State Farm/ PM useful?**

  - Any court basically.

  - PM: needs to make sure jury instructions aren't getting stuff confused (maybe inevitable as Stevens believes)

- **Consider: do we need a multiplier** if people don't show up for trial? May not need to limit.

- **Consider: Verbal schemes** in jury instructions and for courts have **limited containing power**.

  - In the Con Law PD Cases (BMW/SF/PM) they **had to put the cap** because of it's excessiveness

- **Do this:** Do your best arguing the word "reprehensible" your way

**[What influences SCOTUS in deciding how to constrain PD? (from *Exxon*)]{.underline}**

\- Federal/State statutes/criminal law

\- International history

\- Actual awards given in other cases

\- Jury instructions given in prior cases

**[Scenarios for "Reprehensibility"]{.underline}**

- Direct mail campaign-

  - P1 sues- Can argue that the punitive damages for the reprehensibility and the punitives go to the P only. (But what about P2 argues the same?);

  - D argue against this- it's an individual case targeted at 1 person- All that Mr. Williams is owed is the one piece of mail (it's easily divisible, he wasn't affected by any other flyers, if others want to complain-bring own claim)

- Advertising campaign:

  - Harder for the defendants to separate and say that they saw "one ad on the subway." It's harder for Phillips Morris to say- they're punishing for the harm done to others because it's more general campaign so it's easier to argue a general reprehensibility.

  - Defendant can still try to break this up- Reprehensibility for his proportion.

  - One more device you could do is doing a punitive damages class, like Exxon did- hard to do- but that would have one suit for PD.

**[Cases:]{.underline}**

***Exxon v. Baker* (2008)- Punitive damages in federal common law/ Ratio**

**- Facts:** Exxon Valdez spilled millions of gallons of crude oil into Prince William Sound. Hazelwood, the captain had a drinking problem, drank and left bridge. Ran aground. Exxon response was slow, no plan in place. People hurt economically by it.

**-** Exxon settled with fed government, but decided it wouldn't settle on punitive damages. Businesses, Alaskans, fishermen, landowners all pulled in together for punitive damages claim in a class action. (Exxon loves this instead of 32 thousand unpredictable punitive damages trials).

\- Initial \$5 Billion dollar sentence gets sent back twice by the 9^th^ circuit as unconstitutional. Cut it in half.

\- SCOTUS has 3 questions; Main one: Is an award of 2.5 billion dollars too big for maritime law?

- **Rule:** Look at BMW and State Farm

  - Looks at verbal instructions (NO!): draws comparisons to criminal sentencing- all over the place.

  - Looks at hard cap (NO!): doesn't account for inflation, when will you review the cap in maritime federal law, harms can vary and be very different.

- **Settles on ratio**: 1:1 ratio- gets this from real world awards.

- **Policy/Application**: Is a ratio a cap of a different type? Should we have the same ratio for all types of injuries or shouldn't multipliers vary?

- Dissent suggests that this is something that should have been left to legislature.

> ***Philip Morris v. Williams* (2007)- Actual process of arriving at damages (3^rd^ parties for reprehensibility; don't punish)**

**- Facts:** Compensatory damages of 821K and about 80 m in punitive damages for N and deceit. SCOTUS sends it back; "look at state farm- one digit ratio;" and SC of OR says the one digit ratio is wiggle-able, leave the 80 m.

\- Non- party harm: Argument over instructions: PM- in punitive award consideration for William's case: *you may consider the extent of harm suffered by others*... but *you are not to punish the D for impact of its alleged misconduct on other persons* who can bring their own lawsuits.

\- PM also objected to the roughly 100-1 ratio of the punitive damages - pointed to single digit multipliers from other cases.

**- Rule:** The award constitutes a taking. This is a standards opinion (Breyer).

\- Only consider non-party harm for reprehensibility.

- **Due process clause** forbids a state to use punitive damages to punish a defendant for the injury it inflicts upon non-parties or those whom they directly represent.

- Jury may consider the conduct to third parties for reprehensibility, but may not use it to inflict punishment for harm caused to 3^rd^ parties.

\- Question of 100:1 multiplier goes unsolved

\- **Policy:** Stevens dissent- "Nuance evades me"- Don't know why we wouldn't consider harm done to others in figuring out the reprehensibility of conduct. You can pay part of it to the state or all of it. Worried about jury interpretation.

\- Philip Morris always gives you two arguments: punishing for reprehensibility of whole act; and the defendant argues that you are punishing for other plaintiffs.

**[Repetitive punitive damages]{.underline}**

- If each plaintiff gets compensatory damages, and then punitive damages on top, what happens if there's 100 plaintiffs?

  - Avoid it through class actions.

- **Problems**:

  - Too much will shut down a defendant,

  - How will the courts know in advance how many plaintiffs will sue so they can adjust damages

  - BUT Too little won't deter behavior, and adding up the compensatory may not be enough

- Courts haven't barred it- when do you know when another PL will come along to claim.

- **Process to determine Repeat Punitive Damages (***See Grace*)

  - 1\) Are punitive damages appropriate? Liability, amount of compensatory damages, liability for punitive damages

  - 2\) If jury determines that punitive damages are appropriate:

    - Permit evidence on the amount of such damages, including prior awards

    - Look at record of due process based on cumulative effect of prior awards

    - Repeated awards are not unconstitutional but they may be relevant in assessing constitutional attacks.

**[Case:]{.underline}**

***WR Grace v. Waters-* Repetitive punitive damages are OK**

**- Facts:** Asbestos case, court refused to bar multiple awards of punitive damages.

**- Rule:** Repeated awards are not unconstitutional but they may be relevant in assessing constitutional attacks

\- Process:

\- 1) Look at: Liability, amount of compensatory damages, and liability for punitive damages

\- 2) If jury determines that punitive damages are appropriate, permit evidence on the amount of such damages, including prior awards.

\- Record of due process based on cumulative effect of prior awards

**- Policy:** Don't want to bar repetitive damages if other states are doing it.

**[Statutory Damages]{.underline}**

- **Range:** Presents a range (minimum to maximum)

- **Harm:** Is not necessarily pegged to the harm.

  - In copyright- difficult to prove harm so not needed.

- **Notice**: Don't need to worry because it's already in the statute.

- ***Williams*** **(Sets up consideration of reasonableness- due process**)

  - Railroads had penalties of 50 to 300 dollars plus costs per offence.

  - When passengers were charged 66 cents more than law allowed, passengers obtained a judgment of 75 dollars plus fees- award within statutory range.

  - Said damages against railroad ***didn\'t violate the due process***- only where the penalty prescribed is ***so severe*** and ***oppressive*** as to be ***wholly disproportioned*** to the offense and ***unreasonable***.

  - Also said that ***damages don't need to be tied to injury only*** (think of violation of public law)

- Set of factors to consider in **statutory award constitutionality** (*See Sony*)

  - \(1\) Nature of infringement

  - \(2\) D's purpose and intent\*\*^this\ looks\ like\ punitive\ damages^

  - \(3\) D's profit if any or expense saved\*\*^this\ looks\ like\ punitive\ damages.^

  - \(4\) Revenue lost by P

  - \(5\) Duration of infringement

  - \(6\) Continuation of infringement

  - \*\*Note that it seems punishment isn't taken into account\*\*

**[Cases]{.underline}**

***Sony v. Tenenbaum* -- Statutory damages were constitutional**

**- Facts/Posture:**

**-** Several years, Tenenbaum downloaded and distributed copyrighted music without authorization. Sony Records sued Tenebaum under the Copyright Act for statutory damages and injunctive relief. Tenenbaum lied about his activities during discovery. Sony only sued for 30 songs. Tenebaum wants the *BMW/SF* standard.

\- Trial Court: Jury awarded Sony 22.5K for each song - 675K (15% of the max). Trial court used SF ratio BMW limits to knock it down. He shared 30 songs at \$15 -- that's not the right ratio according to State Farm and BMW.

\- First time 1^st^ Circuit: NO, we're not talking about punitive damages. We're talking about statutory damages. So they send it back, it's a new judge, and the judge decides it's the same statutory damages- the award is fine. The problem wasn't with the jury instructions, it was with the knocking down.

\- Second time 1^st^ Circuit:

Why not **BMW/SF standard**?

\- 1. BMW presented those guideposts for notice -- not present in a SD case because the statute is the notice

\- 2. BMW tells us to look at relation of award and harm -- that makes no sense here because a plaintiff seeking statutory damages doesn't have to prove harm. Statutory damages aren't there for corrective justice, they're there for the public wrong.

\- 3. BMW tells us to compare the award to a comparable civil penalty -- here that would mean comparing the award to itself, which makes no sense.

So what did they jury

\- The trial court allowed the **jury instructions**: Compares non-exhaustive factors to consider in issuing award constitutionality (nature of infringement, defendant's purpose and intent, D's profit and expense saved, revenue lost by P, duration of infringement, continuation of infringement) in determining what to give within the statute.

\- Then the judge used the *Williams* standards for **due process (constraint)**: "wholly disproportionate" and " obviously unreasonable"- not unreasonable at all, this is the person they feared.

- *Williams*- 75 dollars plus fees for violating statute, railroad. Was within due process.

- Constitutionality of award -- Within the statute and consider the factors

  - 15% of the maximum award for willful violations and less than the maximum is within due process.

  - Williams allows a much broader range- there is no requirement for harms, the whole reason is to not have to do that; the whole point is to deter public harm.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Mass Torts (Class Actions)**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

\- **Rationale for Class Actions**:

Plaintiffs:

- Individual amount \$\$ is too small (Gives lawyers incentive to sue)

- Pool resources (legal, discovery, common witnesses)

- Shows a pattern of harm

- Avoids duplication, saves \$\$

- Get more \$, push settlement (leverage)

- Gets more press attention

- Consistent results

Defendants:

- "Global peace," Has preclusive effect on others.

- Done with it in one go

Society:

\- Administration/coordination

\- Avoid clogging courts

\- Distributional limits benefits- no windfalls

**- FRCP**

**- FRCP 23 [(a) must meet]{.mark}** [all of the following requirements:]{.mark}

- (a)1- class "**numerosity**" -- so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.

- **[(a)2- ["commonality"- questions of law or fact common to the class.\*\*^Scalia\ ^]{.mark}]{.underline}**

- [(a)3- "**typicality**"- typical of claims/defenses of the class. \*\*]{.mark}

- [(a)4- "**adequacy**"- parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\*\* ^analyzed\ as\ one\ usually^]{.mark}

[**- FRCP 23(b)** **choose among**- class action may be maintained if prosecuting separate actions would create risk of...]{.mark}

- [(b)(1)(A)- **inconsistency** -- incompatible results among members of class]{.mark}

- [(b)(1)(B)- **limited fund**- adjudications with respect to individual class members would impede the abilities of members not party to adjudicate.]{.mark}

- (b)(2)- **injunctive class**- final injunctive relief is appropriate to whole class; or

- b(3)- **("damages" class)** **predominance & superiority**- common questions of law or fact to all class members predominate over questions to individual members. And class action is superior to other methods to adjudicate. The matters pertinent to these findings include:

  - A\) class members interest in individual control

  - B\) litigation already begun by some class members?

  - C\) desirability/undesirability of concentrating litigation in one forum

  - D\) difficulties in managing a class action

<!-- -->

- (b)(1) & (b)(2) classes are mandatory

- Special protections that apply to a (b)(3) class-

  - Opt-out

  - Extra criteria (?)

  - Notice

> \*\*These are protections going both ways- predominance and superiority for defendants not to be super liable for tons of damages; opt-out, etc. for people that may want to sue.\*\*

**- FRCP 23 (c)(4) & (c)(5)**

- **(c)(4)- particular issues**- an action may be brought or maintained with respect to particular issues (certify on the issues that *are* the same)

- **(c)(5)- subclasses**- a class may be divided into subclasses that are each treated as a class under this rule.

<!-- -->

- **What needs to be common to predominate? (Scalia)**

  - **23(a)(2):** **"commonality"**: Same injury & common answers (to the question), class-wide resolution, "glue"

    - Bringing a b(3) flavor to threshold question.

    - Prevents injunctive b(2) and (b)(1) limited fund and inconsistency class actions from being brought.

- **What needs to be common to predominate? (Posner)**

  - **Posner: 23(a)(2)- Single source of injury** (one act by D) is enough for common claims, not damages (don't worry at certification if some people weren't injured)

    - Use (use c(4) & c(5) for that) for damages(*See Parko*)

  - Don't worry about people who aren't injured now, do that later.

- **MDL Panels**

  - Pre-trial use

  - Allows court to pull all cases together with common fact questions for the purposes of fact finding and then separates them again once that phase is over.

  - Gives an idea of how each individual case would turn out if tried separately.

  - Not a representative action, other people are still allowed to file.

  - Everyone comes in with own attorney for this part- 1 big drawback- you need to have filed a case.

- **Judicial review of class action settlements (unlike normal settlements)**

  - Judge rejected 325 million dollar settlement for Silicone Valley

  - Granted workers less than others had received from companies who settled claims in the last case.

  - Usually judges grant settlements in class actions, even when there are objectors

  - Overly paternalistic approach considering the P's counsel could lose and win nothing? Good protection form attorney collusion- have incentive to settle?

**[Cases]{.underline}**

***Wal-Mart v. Dukes* (2011) (SCOTUS) (Scalia**)- 23(b)(3) class & new definition for commonality

**- Facts:** Wal-Mart leaves pay and promotion decisions to local manager\'s broad discretion. Three people representing 1.5 million people -- Dukes: concedes she violated company policy and was demoted because of it but she says male employees weren\'t treated that way; Kwapnoski- male manager yelled at her and other female employees; Arana- was brushed off several times about management training. They bring a (b)(2) class seeking injunction & back pay.

**- Rule**- Class was improperly certified as (b)(2) class. Scalia doesn't want them seeking a damages class- he throws the book at them by saying it's commonality.

- **FRCP 23(b)(3)-** After ruling out all 23(b) options, (b)(3) is where damages can be gotten. Money damages are appropriate here and this option has special protections.

- **BUT FRCP 23(a)(2)- commonality,** no one was unclear about this before, but Scalia defines in path-breaking definition:

  - "same injury"\*\*

  - class-wide resolution\*\*

  - "common answers"\*\*

  - "glue"

  - dissimilarities

- Example: one test for promotion, done by one supervisor, for everyone

- Ginsburg dissent: Agrees it shouldn't be a b(2) class. Scalia is straight up changing the law (we've done these cases before!); dissimilarities that tear the class apart is a question for 23(b)(3) not for (a)(2)

- **Policy/Application**: Justification? Efficiency (not a class action if everyone brings a suit and getting different remedies); prevent de-legitimizing class actions; prevent abuse (so. Co. doesn't feel like they have to settle, even if not liable).

- BUT It's precluding b1 (inconsistency/limited fund) & b2 (injunctive) class actions by putting this at the 23(a) part.

- How are lower courts going to get around this?

\- After Wal- Mart it seems like you need to be a (b)(3) class to seek damages.

***Parko v. Shell* (2014)(Posner- 7^th^ Circuit)- Single source of injury/ don't worry about members not injured now**

**- Facts:** Property owners brought suit against Shell Oil Company, owned oil refinery. Also brought suit against ConocoPhillips, who own it now. Say refinery has leaked contaminants into groundwater under people\'s homes- nuisance and related torts. Seeking damages measured by lowered property values. Comes to Posner on a 23(f) interlocutory appeal after certification but before trial. Shell saying that it doesn't meet numerosity if you remove the people who haven't been affected.

**- Rule:**

- **What needs to be common to predominate?**

  - Single source of injury/liability (single act of defendant)- might be considered at (a)(2).

  - You don't have to have same damages- that's more of a b(3) flavor he's worried about here -- use 23(c)(4) & (c)(5)

- **What happens if some class members aren't injured?**

  - Don't worry about it now, later- certification isn't the moment, use (c)(4) &(c)(5)

- **Applied here: multiple sources of pollution (not common);**

  - Not even sure if there's an injury- they don't use the groundwater.

- **Different from *MetCoil***

  - One polluter, single source

  - Did enter water supply

***Moldy Washing Machine Cases-* Sears- (Posner)- use 23(c)(4) & 23(c)(5) for different issues**

- 6^th^ and 7^th^ Circuits certify consumers DESPITE- different machine models and people that haven't been injured

- Posner: Break up into smaller classes (subclasses of plaintiffs)- 23(c)(5)

  - Also, just certify people on the issues that are the same- 23(c)(4)- different issues with washing machine?

- **Policy/Application:** How could we have used these two parts of the rule in Wal-Mart?

  - By Subclasses: former/current employees; Subclass: promotion, test, interviewing;

  - By issue: supervisory discretion practice; subclass: by region

***In Re Deepwater Horizon (BP Settlements)--* (Jan & March 2014) (5^th^ Circuit)**

- **Facts:** As soon as disaster happens, BP sets up GCCF (good PR and oil statute requires it). Fineberg manages it. Claims are all put together in an MDL panel.

- Settlement terms: 1) no proof of causation, 2) formerly GCCF (settlement replaces fund) 3) uncapped -- agreed before the government trial hits.

  - BP realizes this is a bad deal because of the V analysis.

- Objectors bring challenges on commonality 23(a)(2); not damages 23(b)(3); 23(a)(4)- adequacy

- **Rule:**

- Commonality (a)(2) challenge: there's a single act of DF and a bunch of common issues. Single act is also predominant.

- Adequacy(a)(4) challenge: the fund is uncapped & their interests are represented in settlement.

- Predominance (b)(3) -- on common questions of law/fact challenge: BP liability is common and predominant; don't worry about damages because we're gonna break it up later, like MDL.

- Uninjured parties: people are signing a form- they're testifying that their losses are due to the spill.

- **Policy/Application**: Over-inclusiveness is also a deterrent? Don't want to require so much proof of causation that it slows people down, people who need this may have limited understanding- so it's in the interests of corrective justice.

**Options we've seen for recovery:**

- 9/11 fund: publically funded, bars litigation

- Punitive damages

- Fund created out of punitive damages

- BP1- GCCF

- BP2- Settlement
