[]{#_Toc311118620 .anchor}Elements of a Tort

1.  **BREACH OF DUTY** (failure to comply with the applicable standard of care)

    a.  Negligence: failure to take care that a reasonable person would under the circumstances.

        i.  Standard: BPL

            1.  Always consider if there were other alternatives available to tortfeasor.

        ii. Method: Always start with identifying the negligent action (this becomes you "burden" in BPL)

        iii. Question: Objective v. Subjective

             1.  Physical disability?

             2.  Children? Doing an adult activity?

             3.  Expertise?

             4.  Emergency Doctrine?

        iv. Question: Take more care or deter activity altogether?

        v.  Shortcuts:

            1.  Negligence per se (statutes) -- violation = liability, no safe harbor

            2.  Customs -- not dispositive 🡪 consider setting industry standards

            3.  Medical standards (mandatory, and create safe harbor if you meet)

        vi. Defense: Comparative Negligence or Contributory Negligence (Maryland)

            1.  Pure comparative (California) v. Modified comparative? (Wisconsin)

            2.  Assumption of Risk?

    b.  Affirmative Duties

        i.  Taking care during rescue

        ii. Duty to warn 🡪 if you cause the harm, you should at least warn

        iii. Failure to warn 🡪 adequate instructions or warnings

             1.  Must instruct and warn about possible consequences

             2.  Label clutter

        iv. Informed consent 🡪 medical standard

        v.  Special relationships 🡪 parents, or psychiatrists (duty to warn)

2.  **CAUSATION**

    a.  Factual Causation

        i.  But for causation

        ii. Multiple sufficient causes 🡪 non-tortious cause?

        iii. Multiple necessary causes

        iv. "Joint" tortfeasors (jointly -- all agree to do a tort -- conduct OR indivisible harm)

        v.  Proof problems

            1.  Preponderance of the evidence standard

            2.  Alternative liability (*Summers v. Tice*)

                a.  Shifts burden on the DF to prove themselves out of liability

            3.  Market share liability

        vi. Harm: lost chance (harm is redefined as lost chance of survival rather than death) -- gets around "but for" caustion, but scope is limited.

        vii. Allocation of damages

             1.  Joint and several

             2.  Several

    b.  Legal Causation/Proximate Cause

        i.  Scope of the risk: harm within the risk

        ii. Pertinent Considerations

            1.  Type of Harm (usually breaks chain of causation)

            2.  Manner of Harm (usually does not break chain of causation)

            3.  Unforeseeable PL (Yes, see *[Plasgraf]{.underline}*)

            4.  Extent of Harm (No)

            5.  Intervening Cause (Maybe) -- see how big the cause is

                a.  E.g. you cause accident, then person goes to hospital where doctor operates and injury gets worse -- is the doc crazy or just plain old negligent?

        iii. Takeaways:

             1.  Make relevant arguments; these concepts are not set in stone.

             2.  Weird facts 🡺 Discuss proximate cause

3.  **STRICT LIABILITY** (abnormally dangerous, animals, trespass, conversion or nuisance**)**

    a.  Abnormally dangerous activity:

        i.  Foreseeability

        ii. Highly significant risk

        iii. Common usage to the area

    b.  Vicious animal 🡪 strict liability, non-vicious animal 🡪 no negligence?

    c.  Trespass to Land

        i.  Entry? Anything, includes intangibles (bacteria?).

        ii. Harm? Not necessary, presumption of invasion of feelings of ownership, but if no injury then just nominal damages

        iii. Intent 🡪 intended to enter land or be there (no intent 🡪 negligence)

        iv. Necessity exceptions 🡪 reasonableness test

    d.  Nuisance

        i.  Unreasonable and substantial interference with a person's use and enjoyment of their real property

        ii. Gravity of harm outweighs utility of conduct?

        iii. Coming to the nuisance?

        iv. Continued nuisance? Injunction v. damages?

    e.  Conversion (like trespass, but with personal property)

        i.  Ownership of Real Property (*Kremen* says all property meets test)

            1.  Interest capable of precise definition

            2.  Capable of exclusive possession or control

            3.  Putative owner must have legitimate claim to exclusivity

        ii. Wrongful deprivation

        iii. Damages 🡪 requires injury

    f.  Trespass to chattels (interference w/ possession of personal property)

        i.  Impaired use of chattel v. conversion:

            1.  Duration of interference

            2.  Type of possession

            3.  Profit/benefit to defendant

        ii. Damage/injury required to the chattel? Re-scope the 'personal property.'

4.  **DAMAGES/INJURY**

    a.  Legal remedies

        i.  Compensatory damages 🡪 includes pain and suffering for physical injury

        ii. Punitive damages (still ongoing)

        iii. Nominal damages

    b.  Equitable remedies

        i.  Permanent injunctions

        ii. TROs/preliminary injunctions

    c.  Statutory remedies

        i.  Full defenses to injury

            1.  "pure" economic harm

            2.  "pure" emotional harm

    d.  Class Actions -- FRCP Rule 23

        i.  Commonality and predominance for damages class?

        ii. Sub-classes and issue classes?

    e.  Multi-District Litigation

    f.  **Can we bargain or settle?**

5.  **POLICY CONSIDERATIONS**

    a.  Who decides?

        i.  Courts 🡪 judge v. jury

        ii. Legislatures 🡪 institutional competence

    b.  Rules v. Standards?

    c.  Moral Luck?

    d.  Aims of Tort Law

        i.  Social Welfare 🡪 safety for society, activity is necessary

        ii. Corrective Justice 🡪 restore moral balance

        iii. Civil Recourse 🡪 provide victims w/ recourse for wrongs and recognition Optimal Deterrence 🡪 achieves balance btwn activity and harm

        iv. Absolute Deterrence 🡪 stopping activity

        v.  Loss Distribution 🡪 spread the risk, who has insurance, who can distribute costs

        vi. Compensation 🡪 return the victim to their original state

    e.  Economic Theories

        i.  Cheapest Cost Avoider 1 (best knowledge)

        ii. Cheapest Cost Avoider 2 (best bargainer)

        iii. Coase Theory 🡪 Purpose of law? Contracting around the law?

[]{#_Toc311118621 .anchor}Themes of Tort Law

1.  **WHO DECIDES?** (who is your audience & making the decision)

    a.  Courts 🡪 Incremental Change, creates change case-by-case

        i.  Judges

            1.  Experience?

            2.  Knowledge of Rules 🡪 Decide Questions of Law

            3.  Consistency

            4.  Individual Biases

        ii. Jury

            1.  Democratic, jury of peers

            2.  Expertise? Questionable...

            3.  Good reflection of societal preferences/desires/expectations

            4.  Inconsistent/unpredictable?

            5.  Decides questions of Fact

    b.  Legislatures 🡪 Not piecemeal, more comprehensive change + can overrule courts w/ statutes

        i.  Institutional competency?

        ii. Better information and more research?

        iii. Democratic decisions to create law. More trust and legitimacy?

    c.  Possible Methods

        i.  Court leaves to legislature, follows case precedent, no new law

        ii. Court acts over legislature (Li v. Yellow Taxi Cab) or interprets statute to give courts more leeway

        iii. Court can defer/not defer to legislature

        iv. Court can decide to extend/change/apply common law

*[Hammontree v. Jenner (CA 1971)]{.underline}* -- Jenner has epileptic seizure and runs car into Hammontree's shop, had long history of seizures, but Dr. approved his driver's license.

- Three types of arguments & when they are effective:

  - **Human** (may be more attractive to jury):

    - Who is more blameworthy?

    - Who can pay? Bear the losses with the least trouble?

    - Shared blame or innocent victim?

  - **Policy** (good for judge & jury)?

    - What is easy, less costly to administer?

    - What activities, precautions do we want to encourage, discourage?

  - **Legalistic** (attractive to judge)

    - Easy default rule?

    - Follow precedent.

- Battle is fought in **jury instructions** -- here PL's lawyer is pushing for a change in law regarding standard of care from negligence to SL (this needs to be reflected in jury instructions).

2.  **RULES V. STANDARDS**

    a.  How much tailoring do you do? (How do you tailor?)

    b.  **Definitions**

        i.  **Rules** - are the most constraining and rigid. Once a rule has been interpreted and the facts have been found, then the application of the rule to the facts decides the issue to which it is relevant. (Five year children are not negligent)

        ii. **Standards** - provide an intermediate level of constraint. Standards guide decisions but provide a greater range of choice or discretion; standards define a set of mandatory considerations (Learned Hand)

        iii. Example: **railroad** **crossings** for drivers:

             1.  Holmes argues that drivers must stop and look (rule, get out of car).

             2.  Cardozo argues for a standard (drivers must be reasonable)

    c.  **Pros and Cons**

[]{#_Toc311118622 .anchor}Aims of Tort Law

1.  **Social Welfare** -- Tort law recognizes that sometimes society needs activities that have some risk of causing harm. We don't want to impose liability for things that cannot be foreseen or when precaution costs would be too high to stop the activity altogether.

2.  **Moral Luck**

3.  **Corrective Justice & Civil Recourse (Fairness):** Popular moral blame

    a.  Corrective Justice: restoring the **moral balance** between wrong-doer and victim

        i.  Good for individuals against intentional wrong-doer

    b.  Civil Recourse: Tort law is a way of providing victims with **recourse** for civil wrongs.

        i.  Vindicates victims' need for recognition they have been wronged

    c.  **Critique**: Less applicable in modern day where DF is often a faceless corporation or individuals covered by liability insurance.

<!-- -->

1.  **Optimal Deterrence:**

    a.  Deter excessively risky activity so that only those losses worth avoiding are avoided. Liability is based on HARM caused (compensatory damages)

    b.  Sometimes used for Punitive Damages when wrong is not caught frequently, or for intangible harms

    c.  **Pros**: Produces the most economic solution -- just enough deterrence to prevent risks not worth taking, but not too much to require foregoing some of the benefit of that activity.

    d.  **Cons**: Only takes into consideration economic values and ignores other important human values; pain & suffering from accident shouldn't be reduced to economic value of what it takes to prevent it.

    e.  Complete OR Absolute Deterrence 🡪 Based on the gains to defendant. Take away ALL profits of bad activity 🡪 shut down the activity altogether, make it so there is NO gain from activity, so no incentive to do the activity 🡪 a lot of juries think this way (juries often seem to want to take away profits) 🡪 Completely independent from harm. 🡪 maybe this makes sense for punitive damages b/c usually it is DF focused idea, not PL focused

2.  **Absolute** **Deterrence (Mostly used for Punitive Damages)**

    a.  Based on the gains to defendant. Take away ALL profits of bad activity 🡪 no gain from activity, so no incentives to engage in the activity.

    b.  Some activities are so bad we should shut it down.

    c.  A lot of juries think this way for punishment when negligence is egregious.

3.  **Loss Distribution (Spreading Risk):**

    a.  Promotes the broad distribution of losses due to accident/injury. Who should bear costs? Who is best person to spread the cost through society?

    b.  **Pros**: Among all other things equal, having a large number of people bear a small loss is better than having single person bear all of it.

    c.  **Cons**: (1) Does not satisfy sense of moral blame (2) Tort law system is an expensive mechanism for distributing losses (insurance, social security are cheaper ways).

4.  **Compensation**:

    a.  Promote compensation to those who have suffered injury. Return PL to original state.

    b.  **Pros**: Makes people feel more secure that they will be compensated**.**

    c.  **Cons**: We need more than injury to justify liability, so there needs to be more than just the goal of compensation.

**CALEBRESI AIMS OF TORT LAW (Cheapest Cost Avoider)**

1.  Goal of tort law is to find the **[cheapest cost avoider]{.underline}**, make him pay the costs.

    i.  Aim is optimal deterrence 🡪 minimize COST TO SOCIETY

    ii. [Injury cost]{.underline} (cost to victim) + [precaution cost]{.underline} (cost of activity)

    <!-- -->

    a.  Try to internalize ALL the externalities

2.  Who is Cheapest Cost Avoider?

    a.  **CCA v. 1** -- Stick liability on the person who has the best knowledge of:

        i.  Knows the risks/harm (who will be hurt, what extent)

        ii. Knows precautions possible

        iii. Knows the tort law 🡪 needs to know if they would be liable

    b.  Problems of CCA v. 1: Morality, blameworthiness, social norms, distribution, risk spreading are not considered by CCA (school shouldn't pay for factory's pollution, almost seems like you are sticking liability on the more responsible party) AND no stability b/c who gets stuck w/ liability depends completely on volatile factors like technology

    c.  **CCA v. 2** -- Who is the cheapest transactor? "Best briber"?

        i.  Best briber is one who faces the lowest transaction costs, based on Coase Theorem. Factors:

            1.  Who knows the risks?

            2.  Who knows how to reduce the risks?

            3.  Who knows whether they will be liable?

3.  ["But for" causation]{.underline} sweeps all candidates in, [proximate cause]{.underline} is the tool to implement the idea of CCA, assigns liability to the CCA

    a.  BP Case (no causation) -- we want causation in fact for optimal deterrence b/c causation makes sure that precaution taken would have made a difference, don't want ppl just spending precaution money that makes no difference in other ppl's harms (waste) 🡪 many tortfeasors have limited resources, so only spend \$ on things that make a difference to people

    b.  Proximate Cause/HWR -- we have tort law for certain types of harm, that is what we assign liability for, we can't prevent freak accidents, harm has to be foreseeable, people can't take precautions they don't know about

4.  **Calebresi** *[Compensation Goals]{.underline}* (backward looking -- ex post)

    a.  Spreading of losses and costs via insurance and mutual insurance to promote societal distribution of losses

    b.  Wealth distribution -- deep pockets should pay:

        i.  Better able to bear the costs (form of thinking about insurance)

        ii. Diminishing marginal utility of money 🡪 better to tax rich

        iii. More \$ means more power to control things = more responsibility

    c.  We are still uncomfortable with a disconnect with the physical connection; **causation doesn't matter** when we are just concerned with distribution or deep pockets (same as taxes)

    d.  **Fairness/Deterrence:** Person should only pay if at fault. Need to deter people form dangerous conduct, rich ppl can't just pay.

5.  **Calebresi** *[Deterrence Goals]{.underline}* (forward looking -- ex ante) (negligence is the person that is CCA, not the bad, fault creator)

    a.  Efficient deterrence: minimize the sum of injury costs and safety (precaution) costs as well

    b.  **Specific deterrence** (regulation): regulations to control behavior (bans)

        i.  We do not need to know the exact causation

        ii. Not as economically efficient compared to general because it does not account for different situations such as changing technology and circumstances

    c.  **General deterrence** (price/tax): increases the price of certain activities such as carbon tax

        i.  **Works through causation**: A link between behavior and the harm -- we can generate the proper price and tax to achieve the right amount of deterrence.

        ii. **Forseeability matters more for this** because we can measure the right price that leads to the proper amount of deterrence (and not lead to over-deterrence or under-deterrence)

            1.  You need to foresee the amount of harm in order to impose a proper amount of price or taxation to deter that behavior in an efficient manner

            2.  Internalize the costs

        iii. Price mechanism makes it more efficient to adopt cheapest choice

             1.  People can adopt a more efficient (cheaper) choice when there's no regulation

    d.  Controls both [*care levels* and *activity levels*]{.underline} 🡪 if the harm costs \$100 and the business is \$90, then it will shut down. *Care level* affects both the harm causer and the potential victim; *activity level* only controls the harm causer's behavior

**\**

**COASE THEORY -- FUNCTION OF LAW**

3.  [*Coase Theorem*:]{.underline} when there is no transactions costs, regardless of where liability is placed, the parties will bargain to get the cheapest, most optimal solution (school w/ giant fan and factory w/ scrubbers)

    a.  Questions the **purpose of the law?** Do we need law at all if society will achieve most cost efficient result?

4.  [Critiques and Limitations of Coase Theorem]{.underline}

    a.  Assumes there is no transaction costs 🡪 unrealistic and sometimes bargaining is impossible (e.g. too many parties, unknown parties)

        i.  Coase works when there is good bargaining ability:

            1.  Sophisticated parties who know how to negotiate

            2.  Parties have pre-existing relationship

            3.  Fewer parties

            4.  Harms are easily monetized

        ii. Role of Law: if TC costs are high, law is important.

    b.  Ignores distributional consequences: fairness, fault, etc.

        i.  Coase works when bargaining power is equal:

            1.  2 big businesses

        ii. Role of Law: Where we stick liability, that party must bribe or pay, so law attempts to place liability on CCA (either party that knows more, or best briber) 🡪 creates incentive for person stuck with liability to actually find the CCA.

[Brown v. Kendall]{.underline} (MA, 1851) Defendant dog owner tries to separate dogs with a stick. Unintentionally hits plaintiff in the eye. Case brought an action of **trespass**, trial court required extraordinary care from defendant to escape liability.

- Judge Shaw changes standard of behavior to **ordinary care for both case and trespass**.

- Burden is on plaintiff to prove lack of ordinary care.

- **Dicta:** Plaintiff must also take ordinary care, or no recovery. Only recovery if plaintiff took care AND defendant did not take care. **Contributory negligence.**

[Gross v. Allen]{.underline} (NJ, 1975) 17-year-old skier crashed into plaintiff at resort. Applied semi-objective reasonable care standard for a person of similar age and experience.

- Appeals Court held that standard of care was of adult under similar circumstances b/c skiing was primarily an adult activity.

- NJ Court reversed and held that semi-objective 17-year-old standard was right.

 

[Vaughan v. Menlove]{.underline} (1837) Defendant landowner piled hay improperly, created a fire hazard to neighbors, resulting in fire.

- Defendant's attorney argued for reasonable care standard based on poor mental faculty. Client had a mental limitation, should not be held to standard of normal intelligence.

- Courts rejected the argument b/c it would make the reasonable person standard too vague.

> [ ]{.underline}

[Roberts v. Ramsbottom]{.underline} 73-year-old driver suffered stroke before driving. His consciousness was impaired but had some awareness of surroundings and could make some deliberate movements to manipulate the car. He was never aware that he was unfit to drive (no moral blame).

- Still liable. Can only escape liability if completely unconscious. Measured to reasonable person standard for person of his age.

- He should have recognized his inability to drive from previous misadventure son road that same day. Liable for not recognizing significance of prior mishaps.

| Some factors to be considered in "circumstances" in reasonable person standard.                                                                                                 |

| - Factors we cannot take into account are sex and mental disability.                                                                                                            |
|                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| - But you can use a **proxy** for these, like physical character, clothing, height, etc.                                                                                        |

| Must consider the circumstances of both the plaintiff and the defendant.                                                                                                        |

| - The internal characteristics of the defendant may be relevant to the external circumstances of the plaintiff and vice versa.                                                  |

| - Remember that characteristics can be used to cut both ways.                                                                                                                   |

|   - An inability to drive might lower the reasonable standard, or it might require you not to drive at all to be reasonable.                                                    |
|                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| - Who gets to decide? Judge or jury?                                                                                                                                            |
|                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|   - If we want to admit sex as a factor in the reasonable person standard, we only need to persuade jury to fit gender into '**circumstances'** 🡪 question of facts             |
|                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|   - If we want to include sex as a factor in the jury instruction, we need to convince judge to issue **special instruction** to include it in the standard. 🡪 question of law. |
+=================================================================================================================================================================================+

[Daniels v. Clegg]{.underline} (Girl drives a buggy down a hill, defendant man did not turn out of her way but drove on normally. Girl could not turn to avoid crash and was injured.)

- Examined girl's contributory negligence.

- Jury instruction was to consider **age of girl** and the fact that she was a **woman**.

- No contributory negligence because defendant should not have expected girl to be as capable of driving as a competent man in like circumstances.

[Railway Company v. Tankersley]{.underline} (1890) (an old lady was getting off a train, but it did not stop long enough for her to get off safely, while getting off, the train started with a jerk and threw her onto the platform, hurting her)

- Examined old lady's contributory negligence.

- Was it reasonable to attempt to get off the train given the circumstances?

- Circumstances should include **age, sex, and physical conditions**.

- It was not prudent for old lady to attempt getting off, when a young man might do so.

VI. []{#_Toc311118631 .anchor}Standards of Care

**Ordinary Care**

[Bethel v. NYC Transit]{.underline} (1998) (Wheelchair seat collapses in bus. PL sues transit authority for negligence in keeping chair in repair because they are held to standard of utmost, extraordinary care as a 'common carrier.' DF asks for standard to change back to ordinary care.)

Court allowed the change from extraordinary care to ordinary care for common carriers.

- Single ordinary care standard is flexible enough for juries to take into account the ultrahazardous nature of tortfeasor's activity.

  - Con: Jury is variable. People might not think bus/common carrier should be expected to take more care. We would not have as high level of safety as before.

- Times have changed, other regulatory standards, we don't need torts to make buses safe.

- We want to incentivize bus companies to keep running, social good. But maybe less people will ride buses with lower care b/c they fear for their own safety.

**Extraordinary Care**

[Wood v. Groh:]{.underline} (plaintiff shot accidentally by defendant\'s son with a gun that he had taken out of the locked case with a screwdriver and ammunition was kept in same cabinet.)

- The appeals court found defendant liable because he had taken ordinary care, but that there should be \"the highest degree of care in safekeeping the handgun.\"

- Gun is on object of **dangerous instrumentality,** requires more than reasonable care.

- Ordinary care is not enough to deter the bad behavior; trial court found that dad was reasonable. And sends a message to other gun owners to be extra careful. And don't want to incentivize gun ownership and cost of more precautions is not prohibitive.

- Con: Shouldn't move standard to extraordinary care because gun owners shouldn't be liable for non-predictive circumstances, making them pay more is unfair and imposes too high a cost for safety.

**Emergency Doctrine**

In the law, when in an emergency, not of your own making, you only need to show **honest exercise of judgment** (aka you tried your best in an emergency). Lesser standard of care.

- Jury should imagine what a reasonable person would do only with the given amount of time to prepare (we should not imagine what a reasonable person would do in similar circumstance had they foreseen the circumstance and had adequate preparation time).

Questions to consider:

- Why carve out emergency doctrine at all? Isn't an emergency part of the circumstances?

- What constitutes an emergency? There is little uniformity in the law.

- Who is incentivized by this lower standard of care? There is no reason for incentives because emergencies are by definition unpredictable.

Baltimore and O.R. Co. v. Goodman (1927) (Man in car got run over by a train. He slowed down while approaching crossing and listened for train, but view was blocked and could not stop once he saw the train and was killed.)

- Holmes -- declares that there is a clear standard of conduct 🡪 you need to get out of car and look for train.

- This question of negligence does not need to go to jury, not getting out of train is always negligent 🡪 trying to create a **Rule.**

- Argues that judges develop expertise from similar cases over and over should be able to create and apply a standard rule that is uniform. Otherwise, juries oscillate and are unpredictable, where like cases are no decided similarly.

Pokora v. Wabash R. Co. (1934) (Man was injured when train struck his truck while crossing. The district court directed a verdict for railroad b/c of petitioner's contributory negligence.)

- Cardozo -- overturns the 'rule' created in *Goodman* that plaintiff must have gotten out of car to look for train -- in this case, the truck would already be in the 'zone of danger' to be able to see the train, so getting out to look for train would be more dangerous, than not.

- Negligence under the circumstances should be determined by jury

[United States v. Carroll Towing]{.underline} (1947) (Barge, Anna C, is filled with cargo of flour to be shipped to WWII effort and moored to end of crowded pier. Tug needed to pull out another barge, and during this process, the tier of barges broke from the pier and was carried away. The barge with cargo hit a tanker, which broke a hole in the barge, which caused it to sink. The barge employee was strangely absent from barge, if he had been there, he might have saved it)

- Judge (factfinder in admiralty case) finds bargee of Anna C was absent. But in trail court, finds the Anna C company was not contributory negligent.

- At appeal, finds that there was an **untaken precaution** (so very little burden to company) -- bargee was not there during work hours with no excuse.

- So using BPL 🡪 there was minimal cost/burden on company w/ high probability (bargee on boat would have significantly reduced probability of accident) and magnitude of harm.

- There is no **rule** created that says absences = negligence, but in this case balance the costs and benefits of employee presence, shows there is very little cost to the precaution.

**Statutes**

Defense of limited statutory purpose (statute is irrelevant)

- Plaintiff was not **class of persons** or did **not suffer type of harm** intended to be protected by statute Defense rarely prevails in practice b/c purpose is not usually clear

- But plaintiff could not by **any stretch of the imagination** have been an intended beneficiary of the statute\'s protection, for this defense to work.

- Courts are likely to read statute's protection broadly to include **indirect injuries**

  - Ex. Statute prohibits sale of alcohol to drunks. Shop violated statute, drunk person is served and gets involved in a car accident, third party is injured. Shop is liable.

[Di Caprio v. New York Central Railway]{.underline} Defendant violated statute requiring fences be erected to keep livestock off tracks, no liability when plaintiff\'s young son is killed going onto tracks

[Brown v. Shyne (1926)]{.underline} chiropractor hurt a plaintiff by doing a treatment only licensed physicians can perform. Court holds standard of a physician in determining negligence, BUT did not instruct jury to find liability based on defendant\'s violation of **licensing statute**

- 1971, CPLR Statute 4504(d) declared that for injuries from a person not authorized to practice medicine, they would be negligent per se

[Martin v. Herzog]{.underline} (1920) (DF in car drives on wrong side of road and hits plaintiff in buggy.)

- Plaintiff is contributory negligent because they violated statute by not having their lights on, so they were negligent per se.

[Tedla v. Ellman]{.underline} (1939) (PLs struck by car when walking on highway, on side of the road with less traffic, but that side was in violation of state law because normally can see cars coming)

- DFs argued they were contributory negligent per se because of violation of statute.

- No negligence per se because following statute would have been more dangerous.

**Who should determine breach of duty and make rules? Legislature or courts?**

Negligence per se (statutory negligence) is legislatures deciding law and breach of duty.

**Custom**

Custom is not dispositive in proving negligence or proving reasonable care, it is **only persuasive**.

- In order for a practice to be custom, it does not have to be universal, but most people.

- Consider WHY a custom exists. Is it to save money? Or is it to improve safety?

The current rule of custom is a strong rejection of 2 other possible interpretations:

- Safe-harbor Rule: compliance w/ custom = no liability

- Irrelevance Rule: compliance w/ custom is not relevant and should not be admissible

Benefits of Current Custom Rule

- Custom often **correlates** to what ought to be done

- If actor is complaint w/ custom, **cautions the jury** that finding the actor negligent implies that the entire industry or grouping of peoples is also behaving unreasonably.

- If actor is non-compliant to custom, **makes jury** **feel better** about finding them negligent

- Coordinating function -- potential victims can take **self-protective care** based on custom

- Some departures of custom may be **equally safe or more safe** than custom dictates

- Promotes reliable and accurate decisions - custom is an important way to **inform juries** on how reasonable actors should act, especially if jury is unfamiliar w/ circumstances

[T.J. Hooper]{.underline} (1932) (Tug towed 3 barges but they sank in a storm. Tugboats did not have receiving sets to get weather reports, otherwise could have avoided storm. Not customary for industry to provide them.)

- No statute. Custom to have radio (90% of boats have them), but NOT custom for company to provide radios. 🡪 **No custom to have radios**, because liability of owner.

- Tug owners are still negligent because compliance to custom is not reasonable care.

- Custom, in this case, is lagging behind ordinary care for safety.

- Courts must push safety customs for industry because industry has incentive to keep costs down and to choose not to implement more safety standards.

**Medical Malpractice**

Compliance w/ medical custom provides **safe-harbor** for defendant from liability.

Failure to comply w/ professional custom is malpractice (negligence per se).

- **Alternative schools of thought**: No negligence per se if practice complies w/ a school of thought or practice followed by a respectable minority of practitioners.

- Special standard is based on **necessity** -- juries can't be expected to be knowledgeable enough to make medical or other profession judgments.

- If anything, this special standard should stretch to cover all non-professional, but highly technical/complex problems, but this has not happened yet.

Strict Locality Rule: Old requirement that expert witnesses, usually for plaintiff, had to come from the defendant\'s own community and have same/similar practice or qualifications.

- Needed because community medical standards varied widely.

- But \"conspiracy of silence\" - professionals would not testify against each other

With the increased standardization of medicine, many courts have **rejected strict locality rule**.

- National standards now govern and any expert familiar with standards can testify.

- Caused explosion of medical malpractice suits, some doctors only work as expert witnesses.

- In response, some courts only allow practicing doctors to testify, or require higher qualifications.

[Sheeley v. Memorial Hospital]{.underline} (1998) (Patient filed suit for medical malpractice during child birth. Lower court excluded expert testimony because witness was over-qualified and had not practiced medicine in a while.)

- Rejects strict locality rule -- doesn't matter if expert is more qualified than defendant physician or had not practiced in recent years.

- Issue is a medical procedure that had not changed in 30 years.

- Jury gets to decide what is national standard and which expert to believe now.

>  

**Policy Considerations**

Weighing between contradictory statute and custom --which is more relevant to injury?

- Example: TJ Hooper, there is statute that says no radio b/c electrical danger, but custom is to have radio to prevent sinking. Ship sinks. Might still be liable b/c custom is more relevant to nature of injury.

Custom v. Malpractice

- Expertise: medicine is confusing, but could be broken down and explained.

- Custom could be very confusing and technical too.

- Something special about the professional fields that require privilege?

Why aren't statues safe harbors?

- Maybe statute should provide safe harbor, if statute is replacing common law. Could provides protection against tort law so actor can do something? (federal pre-emption)

- Statute can protect, so companies can do cost-benefit analysis that juries normally hate.

- Torts needed to provide justice, compensation, deterrence, statutes might not serve aims.

[BP Oil Spill Case]{.underline} (On April 20, 2010, Deepwater Horizon, an offshore oilrig operated by BP in the Gulf of Mexico exploded. Blast killed 11 crewmembers and caused the LARGEST offshore oil spill in American history.)

- Clean Water Act -- if GN or WN, 4x the penalty. But not defined by statute.

<!-- -->

- Rig's crew misinterpreted results of the negative pressure tests done the day of the explosion. Botched test led to the blast.

  - "Was a gross and extreme departure" from accepted standards in the oil industry

  - "Bladder effect" excuse: condition occurs when pressure on valves may produce false readings (BP & Transocean defense). Experts agree this is stupid excuse.

- BP was over budget and behind schedule, prompting the company to cut corners in safety

- BP sued contractors (e.g. Transocean employees -- disabled safety system, failed to maintain the installation properly, Halliburton -- provided shoddy cement materials)

**Legal Issues**

- Judge Barbier: Agrees with U.S. (GN is an objective standard).

- But BP was also reckless and still guilty of Gross Negligence AND Willful Misconduct because the facts imply culpable mental state:

  - BP knows it was dangerous activity, and area drilling was difficult and hellish

  - Guy in Houston told rig that something was wrong w/ pressure test.

  - Bladder effect excuse: (1) could go to mental state because it's a BS excuse (2) could be objective b/c no one would've misread test results due to this.

  - Untaken precautions/BPL analysis: Burden was so low for untaken precautions

  - Motivated by money!!

| - Ways to work around it: juries could declare plaintiff not negligent, and then adjust damages to take into account their percent of fault.                                                                                   |

[BP Oil Spill Case]{.underline} (BP already admitted negligence for settlement. Barbier portions the blame among three parties: BP (67%), Transocean (30%), and Haliburton (3%))

- BP was grossly negligence (reckless), others were only negligent

- BP was in charge of everything and were more responsible for creating the disaster, had more time to make the final decisions

- Transocean had less time and less information. They also did the right thing once the disaster began -- main failure was its inability to stop the BP caused disaster

- Halliburton\'s failures: unstable foamed cement and failure in well-monitoring

  - Cement conduct was egregious, but not a cause of the blowout, so not legal fault

  - Failure in well monitoring was relatively small and shared by Transocean

<!-- -->

- Numbers? Just making up - 2/3 blame to BP, 1/3 for Transocean, and nominal for HB

[Li v. Yellow Cab Co.]{.underline} (1975)(PL gets hit by DF's car, but contributed so barred from recovery)

- Court switches to 'pure' comparative negligence.

- Harder to switch standard because Cal. Civ. Code § 1714 codified common law when there was contributory negligence, but court interprets code to defer to courts on determining common law. Purpose of code was clarity, not stopping evolution of law.

- Gives broad discretion to trial judges to apportion fault.

- Does not decide how to deal with multiple parties, or if it conflicts w/ willful misconduct

- Wisconsin has modified comparative, and it has created lots of problems for courts

I.  []{#_Toc311118638 .anchor}Non-Negligent Risk Creation

[Montgomery v. National Convoy and Trucking]{.underline} (DF's truck stalled on icy highway w/ no negligence, BUT a hill prevented PL from seeing stalled truck until too late and collided with truck.)

- Defendant was held liable for injury from plaintiff\'s failure to warn approaching drivers

- Courts are willing to impose duty to rescue when they find a principled basis to do so

XII. []{#_Toc311118639 .anchor}Act v. Omission

[The Moch Case]{.underline} (Water company is sued for the burning of a warehouse because they failed to not have enough water to supply fire hydrants that they were contracted w/ city to provide)

- Cardozo says no duty/no liability. Distinguishes between misfeasance and nonfeasance.

- If conduct has gone forward to such a stage that inaction would commonly result, positively or actively in working an injury, there is a duty to act

  - E.g. surgeon who operated w/out pay is liable of negligence in omitting to sterilize his tools or car maker failed to inspect properly before selling cars

- Distinguish is "launched the force of harm" v. "refused to become an instrument of good"

- In this case, water company denied a benefit, not a commission of a wrong

[Clay Electric Co-Op v. Johnson]{.underline} (Utility was contracted to maintain city street lights, plaintiff was run down in area darkened due to utility\'s negligence in maintaining lights, utility had duty)

- Moch does not control because it was decided before the \"undertaking\" doctrine was established

  - **Undertaking Doctrine** -- previous action created reliance (undertaking rescue)

- And Moch failed to recognize distinction between installing system and maintaining it

XIII. []{#_Toc311118640 .anchor}Failure to Warn

[Cuyler v. United States of America]{.underline} (2004) (Naval hospital violated reporting statute by not reporting possible child abuse by Higgs, a babysitter, to Norman, who is treated. Higgs then causes death of Cuyler's child.)

- Negligence per se in violating reporting of statute? No. Statute did not provide for any tort remedies and no indication that legis purpose was to expand tort liability

- Posner: There must be a cause of action under torts for statute violation to count as negligence. There is no tort of failure to warn AND there is no special relationship.

- Statutes only define duties that already exist in the common law, they do not create duties.

  - So if there is no existing duty in the common law (no rescue), a statute that criminalizes inaction (reporting child abuse) does not then create a common law duty (must report child abuse to rescue future children from abuser), UNLESS it includes tort remedy.

XIV. []{#_Toc311118641 .anchor}Special Relationships

[Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of California]{.underline} (1976) (Psychiatrist had patient, Poddar, who told him that they wanted to kill Tarasoff. Dr. Moore warned police and they detained the patient, but police then released him and Poddar went on to kill Tarasoff, about 2 months after appt.)

- Court decided that therapist had failed to warn potential victim 🡪 Defendant therapists\' special relationship to patient was extended to victim.

- Better to have over warning, than none & safety is more important that confidentiality

- Duty is based on if a 'reasonable doctor' would know their patient was dangerous.

- Court dismissed claims against defendant police.

Is police to blame?

- No special relationship btwn police and victim 🡪 but maybe police have special relationship w/ everyone, general public safety is their job?

- Police released Poddar, so launched instrument of harm?

Problems with this Decision?

- Deters future patients that are dangerous from getting help 🡪 more danger to society

- Hard to predict -- false positives, creating unnecessary fear?

- Patients will be committed too easily

- Incentive for doctor not to keep any records of patient session

- Cry wolf? People won't heed warnings

- Administrative cost -- how can you find possible victims?

Cal Civil Code, section 43.92 was enacted later to make therapists immune from liability for failure to warn except when the patient has communicated a serious threat against a reasonably identifiable victim -- Reasonable effort to warn law enforcement and potential victims is enough.

[Hood v. Ryobi]{.underline} (1999) (PL uses a saw that comes with detachable blade guards. Lots of warnings on blade to not use the saw w/out guards. But PL removed guards and then cut off his thumb.)

- **PL argument**: reasonable person expects are particular type of injury, cutting yourself on blade, don't expect the blade to fly off the spindle.

  - Burden would be low to add one more warning or replace repetitive warning

- Court holds no need to contain a specific description of what harms could occur if product is miscued and that warnings of serious injury were sufficient.

- Product was not defective even if the blade came off the spindle.

- PL injuries were result of alteration of the tool, manufacturer is not liable for intervening alternations of the product that was superseding cause of injury.

- Court weights cost of requiring more warning or more detailed warning

  - Cost is not minimal -- price of printing fees for all products alone is large

  - Societal danger of label clutter could undermine effectiveness of warnings

[Stengel v. Metronic (2013)]{.underline} (Stengel used a drug pump to deliver drugs to spinal cord, but defect led to paralysis. PL sued in AZ state, alleging failure to warn of risks. Alleged that Medtronic was aware of defect after approval and should have reported to FDA immediately.)

- **Federal Law (MDA):** for Class III equipment, must inform FDA of risks and there is express pre-emption clause: "No state...may establish or continue in effect with respect to a device intended for human use any requirement -- which is [different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable under this chapter to the device]{.underline}"

<!-- -->

- **AZ tort law**: impose continuing duty to warn of danger which a manufacturer knew were inherent in product's use 🡪 So in light of statute, Metronic should have warned FDA of dangers in using device

- AZ law is parallel, not difference or addition; contemplated warning 3^rd^ party like FDA

- **Counter**: Additional damages that result from the state tort claim constitutes "in addition to" what the federal statute requires?

- **Counter-counter**: Additional damages are okay b/c state law is requires the same action.

- **Counter-counter-counter**: Congress intended to not punish more than federal statute? Maybe conflict by bankrupting company, meaning it eventually can't adhere to MDA?

[Pre-emption in Exxon for Punitive Damages]{.underline} (Are PDs pre-empted by the CWA?)

- Court says no b/c then compensatory damages would be pre-empted too.

- If Congress intended for preemption, then CD & PD would be pre-empted, but Congress must be clear/express about its intent to do so (e.g. have a pre-emption clause)

- Considerations:

  - Is regulatory penalty with punitive damages too much? Over-deterrence?

  - Or does regulatory penalty and PD different functions? Are both independently needed?

| **Causation** is needed because tort law is not interested in negligence that does not result in harm.                                                                                                                                                                             |

[Aegis Insurance v. 7 World Trade Center]{.underline} (2013) (WTC 7 was hit by burning debris from the collapse of the WTC during Sept. 11 attacks. There was a lot of fire and damage to the building w/ limited water supply, firefighters decided not to risk more lives to fight fire and established a collapse zone and let it collapse. Collapse caused damage to Con Ed substation that was built under the WTC 7 building. Con Ed sued WTC 7 for negligence.)

- Judge decides to use "but for" causation cuz proximate cause is confusing

- Alleged Negligence: 7WTC construction/design was bad, otherwise would not collapse

  - Negligence is based on building standards, but also need to show causation

- **But for** the building being improperly constructed, would the substation be damaged?

- If there are several possible causes of injury, for one of more of which defendant is not responsible, plaintiff cannot recover w/out proving injury was sustained wholly or in part by cause for which the defendant was responsible

- There are many causes of the 7WTC collapse, the crash of airplanes, the debris cascade, the multiple, noncontiguous floor fires, the severed water main, the high death toll of firefighters, this confluence events demonstrate that **7WTC would have collapsed regardless of any negligence** in design and construction of 7WTC

- **Counter**: Reasonable jury could conclude that firemen would not have abandoned building if properly constructed

[Stengel v. Medtronic]{.underline} (Tort was failure of Medtronic to report to FDA.)

- **But for** the failure to warn FDA, the Doctor would have been aware of the product defect and Stengel would not have used the implant and get paralyzed.

- Harder causation problem 🡪 the more narrow negligence argument required to get passed pre-emption creates are more difficult causation argument

[Cuyler]{.underline} **(**Tort was failure to report babysitter)

- **But for** the hospitals failure to report the babysitter, the propery agency would have stopped babysitter from working, Cuyler's not hired her, and baby would be alive.

- **Difficult** to construct 'but-for' causation for nonfeasance

- This counterfactual is very speculative, so this is a good reason not to find liability

- These counterfactuals require anther party's choice to be difference 🡪 doctor would not implant the device, the agency would act properly, the family wouldn't hire babysitter

[Informed Consent]{.underline} -- must prove that patient would not have undergone treatment w/ the correct information 🡪 requires evaluation of the plaintiff, not just the defendant.

- Proof must exist to indicate patient would not have used treatment if they knew the risk

- Hard b/c most people take advice of doctor even after disclosure of info

- Patient PL's conclusory testimony they would not have taken treatment is not adequate

- 2 Scenarios:

  - 2 plausible course of treatment, doctor recommends one, but other is reasonable

  - Patient is idiosyncratic that doctor's sense of what risks are worth it are different

- 2 standards to govern causation:

  - **Fully-objective** -- what objective reasonable person would have done if informed, no evidence brought, jury doesn\'t have to evaluate testimony, just what they think

  - **Semi-objective** -- whether RP in PL's position would have declined treatment, patient is permitted to testify/bring evidence about relevant preferences

| When there are 2 possible defendants, courts might impose **alternative** **liability**, or imposing liability on both negligent defendants, each of whom is equally likely to have harmed the plaintiff                |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| - Willingness of courts to impose liability in situations where defendant is nearly \'more probably than not\' the cause of harm (50% is almost probable), whereas if there were 3 defendants, probability drops to 33% |

- Distinct from MSC b/c only ONE cause exists, just can't figure out which defendant.

- There is 50/50 chance that one defendant is guilty of injury, no preponderance

- Not "joint" b/c 2 different shot guns, they didn't help each other w/ their shots

- Unfortunately, limited group is important, if there are more defendants, less likely to impose liability, even if plaintiff is even less likely to be able to prove anything

\*Depends on the state on how to apportion percentages. Some states may just divide equally between all solvent defendants. Other states may divide based on total number of defendants and then first DF to get sued gets stuck with paying for insolvent defendant.

\*\*Generally, plaintiff can sue just one defendant and collect all 60% of damages (Damages minus plaintiff's percent fault) from the one defendant. Then first defendant can collect from other defendants either divided equally OR based on comparative faults.

[Sindell v. Abbott Labortories]{.underline} (plaintiffs (women whose mothers had taken DES drug while pregnant and got a signature disease) sued DES drug manufacturers. But no individual plaintiff could identify which manufacturer had made the DES that her mother had taken.)

- Court circumvented this by holding that the plaintiffs need not prove individual causation. Instead, each plaintiff recovered from each defendant a portion of her damages equal to the **defendant\'s share of the market** for the DES.

- DES is chemically identical, so market share is accurate surrogate for the amount of harm each defendant caused. So imposing liability in proportion to market share forces each defendant to pay compensation for amount of injury caused. Optimal deterrence is achieved.

[Hymowitz v. Eli Lily & Co.]{.underline} (1989) (PL sued makers of DES)

- **Proof:** Market share could reflect how much drugs you put out and how probably one is for causing the disease.

- Requirements for Market Share

  - Identical product

  - Signature disease

- Which market? 🡪 court uses national market, narrower markets would be good, but national data is better and could bar recovery for PLs

- What if a particular PL can prove a specific DF's liability? 🡪 court allows PL to use normal product liability to sue them

  - BUT DF's can't be freed from liability based on particular injury caused to particular PL 🡪 market share is about how much RISK DF put out into market relative to other DFs

  - Contradictory b/c DF can't defend based on particular proof that their pill was distinguishable from other pills

- Possible defense: manufacturer did not target pregnant women

[Matsuyama v. Birnbaum (2008)]{.underline} (Doctor negligently misdiagnosed decedent's condition over period of 3 years. Decreased patients chance of survival from cancer.)

- SCOTUS said loss of chance is okay to impose liability on.

- Medical science has developed credible methods to quantify the damage of malpractice had on prospects for survival

- There is strong public policy to favor compensating victims of medical malpractice.

- Important also to deter deviations from appropriate standards of care.

- Limited holding to medical malpractice.

[Berry v. Borough of Sugar Notch]{.underline} (trolley was speeding, gets hit by a tree.)

- No liability b/c a harm within the risk of speeding is not getting hit by a falling tree.

[Gorris v. Scott]{.underline} **(**Sheep washed overboard b/c not kept in a pen on the ship.)

- Statutory violation b/c require sheep be kept in the pen, but purpose of statute is to protect sheep from contagious disease, not being washed overboard. So no HwR.

[Example of Secondary Risk]{.underline}: Defendant violates statute, requiring railroads to fence their rights of way. A 2-year old child gets injured from wandering onto the tracks. Main purpose is injury to livestock. Nonetheless, courts hold a secondary purpose includes risk to people, jury can decide.

[Wagner v. International Railway Co]{.underline}*.* (defendant was negligent in failing to close the door to one of its rail cars, plaintiff\'s cousin is thrown out of car. Plaintiff was injured while attempting to rescue cousin. Principle risk was falling out. Also proximate cause to plaintiff/rescuer's harm?

- Cardozo said it could be proximate cause. Says, \"Danger invites rescue.\"

- It is foreseeable that others will rescue someone whose safety the DF's actions put at risk.

- So harm to the rescuer can be within the cluster of risks that make DF's actions negligent.

- Jury must decide proximate cause.

[Marshall v. Nugent]{.underline} (defendant\'s driving forced car w/ plaintiff to run off the road. Plaintiff was unharmed when run off road, but suffered injury after he walked down the road and was struck by 3rd vehicle as he was attempting to warn oncoming traffic of the danger ahead.)

- Despite unusual manner of injury, did not preclude liability on part of defendant.

- As long as plaintiff was injured roughly the same time and in roughly same place as was foreseeable, through same general forces as were foreseeable, it is not necessary that precise manner in which injury took pace has to be foreseeable.

[Smith v. Leech Brain and Co.]{.underline} (1962) (DF's negligence in providing inadequate shielding caused a worker to burn his lip by a piece of molten metal. The burn was treated but developed into cancer that killed plaintiff later. Worker was pre-disposed to cancer by 10 years of work in gas)

- DF must take his victim as he finds him. Not different **type** of harm 🡪 burn v. cancer.

- The injury was the same (burn) but **extent** of harm was cancer. So DF is liable.

[Palsgraf v. Long Island Railway]{.underline} (Railroad employees help passenger onto train, dislodged package of fireworks passenger was carrying. Package falls to tracks and explodes, causes penny scale to tip over and injure Mrs. Palsgraf)

- **Cardozo**: No liability, should not go to jury. No N unless there is duty owed to PL.

- Reasonable person could not foresee plaintiff, duty only to passenger and package.

- There is no duty of care to anyone outside of zone of danger and boundaries determined by foreseeability of negligence.

- NO negligence in the air. PL and DF must be connected, negligence arises from relationship, not from act of negligence.

- **Andrews** (dissent): when act is negligent, then DF should be liable for damage that results to world. Only cut off proximate cause by jury determination based on time/space, stream, directness, intervening/superseding, and common sense.

[Davis v. US (1st Circuit 2012)]{.underline} (Plaintiffs are suing for death of 2 women caused by 2 members (Flemmi and Bulger) of a Boston gang. Suing FBI for protecting gang members due to their status as informants, even after the FBI was aware of their violent history & dangerousness)

- **But-for**: Had FBI not tipped Flemmi off so he could flee charged for bombing, he would be in jail and not have murdered women.

  - Proof: Flemmi's co-defendant was jailed for bombing, so would have been jailed. And many instances in which he would have been jailed w/out FBI tip-off

- **Proximate Cause**: FBI could foresee that men were violent and just b/c women were not mob targets is not enough to make unforeseeable. The women had relationship w/ men.

  - **Counter**: convicted murders, but only before killed biz associates, so unforeseeable plaintiffs! And intervening cause was sour personal relationship.

- Also FBI was **reckless** 🡪 court allows jury to use recklessness to help determine if FBI's conduct bears sufficient causal relationship to the murders. Given FBI was reckless, even though victim was unspecified, the FBI made outcome eminently predictable

**Policy for/against proximate cause**

- Pros: Normatively don't want negligent persons to have to pay for distant harms, Deterrence is not served b/c unforeseen harms can't be deterred, impossible to administer a system where any cause is allowed to become a source of liability (we need to break the chain at some point)

- Cons: Important aim of tort law is compensation (negligent + injury should lead to compensation), moral luck -- there is no difference between tortfeasors who do same thing but only one results in harm. Is it just the same as negligence?

**Cheapest Cost Avoider (v.1)**

- But-for: We want to make sure precautions would make a difference in avoiding the injury 🡪 if precaution doesn\'t actually prevent injury, no need to incentivize it

- Proximate Cause (HwR): party that foresees harms should be liable, but even if not foreseeable, there are some cases where liability will incentivize better future choices. And extent of harm is irrelevant to CCA calculation, so makes sense it doesn't matter.

[In re Polemis (1921)]{.underline} (Plank fell into hold of ship where petrol was stored, caused an explosion)

- Trial court finds: Employees were negligent in causing plank to fall and caused explosion from a spark. Spark could not have been reasonable anticipated from falling plank, only same damage to ship would have been foreseeable.

- Was DF's negligence a proximate cause of the unforeseeable harm?

- Court rejected distinction btwn unanticipated extent of harm and unanticipated type of harm. Says anticipation is irrelevant.

- Holds that injury was a 'direct' consequence of negligence, so liable.

|   - Second, whether the harm to the *particular* plaintiff or class was a foreseeable result of the defendant\'s negligence - under rubric of proximate cause. (Actual injury materialized and that specific harm was foreseeable in the course of the defendant\'s risk taking) |

[The Wagon Mound]{.underline} (overruled *Polemis*) (Defendant negligently flushed oil from ship while in harbor. Oil eventually caught fire and destroyed plaintiff\'s dock. It was foreseeable that the oil would foul the dock, but not foreseeable that oil would ignite and burn the dock)

- DF argues that type of harm matters. Different types means different harms 🡪 Foreseeability is key to determine if there are different types of harm.

- DF not liable for fire damage to dock cuz not foreseeable, can be liable for oil gunking up the slipways. It doesn't make sense to make DF liable for all the big unforeseeable damage just b/c caused some minor damage. Instead treat as 2 separate injuries.

- Rejects direct test. Says direct test creates a never-ending problem of causation.

- But there is still liability to an unforeseen extent of harm. In this case, jury found fire was unforeseeable type of harm. DF did not know fire was possible.

[Rylands v. Fletcher]{.underline} (Exchequer Chamber 1866) (Fletcher has coal mines. Rylands builds cotton mill and digs a reservoir. The digging ends up flooding through coal mine shafts and ruins neighbors. No negligence on part of Rylands, contractors are negligent, but irrelevant.)

- Can't impose negligence, but uses strict liability based on the principle of 'escape.'

- Traditional rule is if you bring something, if it escapes, you are liable for everything that occurs during escape (usually animals), but extends to water, filth, stenches, etc.

- Possible rationales?

  - Rylands is cheapest cost avoider

  - Ryalnds gets benefits from building reservoir, so should pay

  - Want to deter reservoir building altogether?

[Rylands v. Fletcher]{.underline} (House of Lords 1868)

- Add the natural v. unnatural distinction for strict liability

- People had no way to take care if plaintiff brings an unnatural condition 🡪 bringer of unnatural condition is the cheapest cost avoider

- If it was natural, than others could expect that danger and take precautions (PL would be CCA in that case)

[Doerr v. Goldsmith (2013)]{.underline} (PL rides a bike and gets injured when DF's let their dog run across the road to the other DF, PL could not avoid dog and collided with it)

- NY common law does not allow negligence liability for injures caused by animals. Only imposes SL on cases where injury results from a **vicious animal** and owner is aware of vicious-character of animal.

- If animals escaped there could also be strict liability.

- PL wants to sue for negligence, court allows this by saying that in this case, the fact that it was an animal was irrelevant, the animal's behavior did NOT cause the accident. Instead it was the owner's negligence for 'throwing animal' across the road.

[Indiana Harbor Belt RR Co. v. American Cyanamid (1990)]{.underline} (train is carrying dangerous chemicals, it leaks in metropolitan area, train company has to pay costs for clean up (\$1 mill), train co. is suing manufacturer that hired it to transport chemicals to recover clean up costs)

- [Guille v. Swan]{.underline} (hot-air balloon landed w/out intent in garden in NYC. Crowd trampled vegetables in garden during rescue. Gardener sued balloonist for damage and won on SL)

  - No negligence b/c can't pinpoint landing at time. But shouldn't be ballooning.

  - **Factors**: likelihood and magnitude of harm was great, could not be prevented from reasonable care, uncommon activity, not valuable activity, and inappropriate location.

<!-- -->

- Should leak of dangerous chemicals be under negligence or strict liability?

- Apply R2T factor test:

  - Negligence is enough to prevent accidental spill

  - No substitute route to transport dangerous chemicals -- cost too much to re-route

  - Danger is not from substance, but from mishandling of chemicals

  - Residents fault for being closet to rail yard, shouldn't live in dangerous area

- **Counter:** alternative routes exist (flying), residents don't have choice (poor), spills are inherent danger of transporting dangerous chemicals, use alternative chemicals

II. []{#_Toc311118658 .anchor}Strict Liability v. Negligence

If you can take (more) care to eliminate the risk you are in the world of negligence.

If you cannot eliminate the risk with care, then you are in the world of strict liability.

- **Strict liability can modulate both care and activity levels**

  - SL can obviously modulate activity level

    - Might be too expensive to continue activity

  - But can also modulate care level

    - If it is worthwhile activity, an actor would choose to be more careful to avoid total harm that would cost them each time harm occurred.

    - Actors *internalization the risks* under SL to change care or activity levels.

- **Negligence can modulate care and activity levels too (but less effective)**

  - If reasonable person standard of care is high, then PL may lower activity level

  - Court can technically declare an entire activity negligent, but this is rare

  - Negligence might also prevent deterrence b/c if you take enough care, you have a safe harbor from liability and so no incentive to regulate activity levels regardless of number of injuries or dangerousness of activities

  - Negligence also places costs on victims (SL for plaintiffs)

- **Strict Liability places decisions of activity and care on individual (better at CCA)**

- **Negligence 🡪 court/jury determines if care level is sufficient (court decides CCA)**

  - Courts rely on customary evidence for N analysis, but custom may be wrong

**If SL works so well, why do we need N? Is SL better for finding the cheapest cost avoider?**

1.  Plaintiff's role? SL creates free harbor for victims so they don't need to take care

2.  Fairness 🡪 better to leave accident on victim, unless actor is blameworthy?

3.  Tradition 🡪 negligence is default, why change?

| **Unintentional Trespass:** If DF lacks any reasonable awareness that the interference is happening (so no intention to even enter the land) then **the negligence standard applies instead of trespass (which is kind of like SL)** e.g. if the ship ends up at someone's dock without even meaning to be there. |

[Martin v. Reynolds (1959)]{.underline} (PL sued for **trespass** (not nuisance b/c of statute of limitations) b/c DF's aluminum reduction plant was sending fluoride compounds made his farm land unusable for raising livestock b/c they were getting poisoned and the land was deteriorating as a result.)

- Liability of trespass has been upheld in cases where vibration of soil caused harm, so does not require visibility to constitute an intrusion. So court will allow energy or force.

- Defines trespass as intrusion that invades possessor's interest in exclusive possession whether intrusion is visible or not.

- Historically, trespass was strict in order to maintain public peace, so if act is likely to result in conflict, courts should call it trespass.

- Important factor is the **feeling** the possessor has w/ respect to land 🡪 sense of ownership should not be violated. So actual damage isn't needed still.

- Doesn't matter if DF's conduct was careless, wanton, or free from fault.

- Fault could be relevant in determining punitive damages. (no PD in this case)

[Ploof v. Putnam]{.underline} (1908) (plaintiffs sailed in lake and sudden storm forced them to tie up in defendant\'s dock. Defendant untied ship from his dock and the ship was lost and the plaintiff\'s were injured.)

- DF argued he was protecting private property.

- Court held that plaintiffs had **privilege of necessity** that entitled them to use dock, so there was no trespass and the defendant had **no right to exclude** them from dock.

- Untying the ship can even be trespass on ship. So court awarded damages to PL.

- Private necessity afforded plaintiff limited property interest in the dock, which the defendant interfered with, so defendant is liable for harm ensued from untying.

[Vincent v. Lake Erie Transportation]{.underline} (1910) (defendant\'s ship was unloading at plaintiff\'s dock when storm arose so had to stay docked. Plaintiff sued for damage that resulted from ship hitting the dock as it was tied up.)

- Defendant said it would be negligent to untie ship, so not liable for damage to dock.

- But court held that **defendant\'s privilege was conditional only** and though they had done no wrong, it had saved ship at expense of dock, so are liable for the damages.

- Because ship would w/out dock have been lost, they only were saved from using dock and preserved their property at dock's expense, so only **fair** that ship owner is responsible for damage.

- Conditional privilege means the dock owner is **less likely to exclude** from property.

- **Dissent: (1)** Argues that the damage to the dock was the result of an inevitable accident. There is no fault on the shipmaster, so cost of damage should like where it falls. **(2)** Assumed the risk by being a dock owner.

**[Reasonable Versus Unreasonable]{.underline}:**

- Looks like **SL for the trespasser**, but **negligence regime** for owner.

- Private necessity ONLY applies if the threatened harm to ship is greater than the harm to the dock. If harm is not greater, you are just a trespasser, no private necessity.

  - This matters b/c if you are just trespassing, the owner can exclude you.

[Kremen v. Cohen]{.underline} (2003) (Kremen had sex.com w/ Network Solutions; Cohen is con-man who used fraud to get domain name registered to him; Cohen made lots of money using the domain name; Kremen originally won suit against Cohen, but could not collect against him; Kremen is now suing Network Solutions for Tort of Conversion)

- District Court rejected tort of conversion on summary judgment because they followed the Restatement and said domain name is **not tangible, real property** so no conversion.

- Court holds that CA does not follow Restatement and instead all property rights (including intangibles) may be subject to conversion tort, which is based on strict

  - [Payne]{.underline} case held conversion of shares in a corporation (not share certificates) b/c tort law recognizes conversion of every species of personal property.

  - [A and M Records]{.underline} Case holds that copies of music can be converted. Does not depend on whether IP rights were merged in a document and IP property right is not merged into the record, or any other physical media of music.

- District Court rejected b/c were reluctant to impose conversion because of SL.

- Not allowing liability means Network Solutions is safe from liability even if negligent.

- **Fairness**: Nothing unfair about holding company responsible for giving away someone else\'s property even if it were not at fault. Network Solutions should be liable and force it to try to recoup its losses by chasing down Cohen.

- **Deterrent** **Effect**: Worried that SL would stifle registration system and increase fees. BUT more regulations is good, even if more expensive we should increase safety.

- **Role of Courts**: Leave to legislature? Courts shouldn't allow no regulation while waiting for legis to act. Court can apply common law until legislature tells courts otherwise.

[Intel v. Hamidi]{.underline} (2003) (Hamidi created a site to complain about Intel and emailed employees of Intel to inform them of problems of working at Intel.)

- No real proof of any injury from the emails 🡪 no damage to computers or servers, no slow down

- Says that chattel is ONLY the physical objects, computer and servers 🡪 so there must be proof of damage to these physical objects

- Disruption based on message content of the workforce and loss of time is not enough.

  - Workers were distracted from work not b/c of frequency/quantity of messages, but because of contents of message.

- Court refuses to find the message of communication to damage the device the message is on. The damage from distraction of reading an unsolicited message is not w/in scope of injury against which trespass-to-chattel tort protects.

- **Dissent:** injury is undesired use of object, chattel didn't have to be harmed itself, just the use of chattel was undesirable, so Hamidi interfered with proper use of Intel's machines

- **Possible future:** should we make the Internet more like "land"? So then this case could work as a trespass to land where dignitary interest is then violated by emails.

- **Internet is 'cyberspace'** and we can exclude people from areas on internet.

- PL Should have tried to re-scope chattel to include work environment or employee's time

The factory owner is not really acting unreasonably, but he is making greater interference than suburb should have to tolerate under the circumstances.                                              |

|                                                                                                                                                             |
| BUT in nuisance, usually the nuisance is continuing during the suit.                                                                                        |

|                                                                                                                                                             |
| - Or defendant may be ordered to pay plaintiff **damages** for all past losses and be **enjoined** from continuing nuisance thereafter (injunction to stop) |

[Boomer v. Atlantic]{.underline} (1970)(DF operates cement plant. Neighboring land owners allege injury to property from dirt, smoke, and vibration. PLs seek both damages and injunctive relief)

- Default NY law: if there is nuisance, court imposes both damages and injunction.

- Court declines injunction (changes NY law) because

  - Cost-benefit analysis -- cost of injunction is much higher than harm caused

  - Cement plant is important to economy of area

  - Saving nuisance law! Must pay for future damages resulting from nuisance.

- Court does not enjoin because cement plant is important to economy of area AND also the cost of discontinuing the nuisance was grossly disproportionate to the amount of harm the nuisance was causing.

- **Dissent**: thinks that cement company should not be able to pollute indefinitely upon paying permanent damages. Court is essentially licensing the pollution. Burden should be on DF to find a way to fix air pollution problem.

**Mistakes & Institutional Competence**

- If court gets **damages too high (liability rules)**, then it functions as an injunction.

  - Parties can still bargain.

- If court gets **damages too low (liability rules)**, then it functions like no liability, but parties can still bargain & work it out

  - Here, if bargaining won't work (conditions are bad for bargaining), court should be extra concerned about getting damages right.

- If court gets **injunction wrong,** parties can still bargain it out, but since PL & DF can demand a lot of money, may lead to strategic holdouts, **extortion**, etc.

- Even if court makes a mistake, doesn't foreclose bargaining for more efficient outcome (Coase), assuming limitations of Coase theorem

[Spurs v. Del Webb:]{.underline} PL is property developer, found to have come to the nuisance b/c he moves to place where there is a feed-lot & sues for nuisance due to flies and odor. Court rules that PL may enforce his property right (get injunction), but must pay DF for the cost of moving the feed lot.

- Justification: PL could have foreseen this nuisance & took advantage of cheaper land values of rural area to build, so should pay for those forced to leave.

- Holding is limited to where the developer foreseeably came to land and made it necessary to grant an injunction against a lawful business, and that business has no adequate relief.

[Ebay v. MercExchange]{.underline} (SCOTUS 2006) (Patent infringement on the \"Buy It Now\" patent held by MercExchange, infringed by Ebay. Ebay tried to license patent from MercExchange but could not reach an agreement. In patent suit, jury found patent was valid, that petitioners had infringed the patent, and damages were appropriate, but MercExchange wanted injunction too.)

- Court says patents that are infringed should not automatically get permanent injunction.

- Traditional 4-factor test should be applied.

**Majority**

- 4-factor test is tradition and should not depart from it.

- Patents are personal property, and do have right to exclude, but right to exclude is not same as a right to an injunction

- Should be decided **case-by-case** if courts should grant injunction in patent suits

**Roberts Concurring**

- Courts generally granted injunctive for most patent infringement cases b/c usually patent property right implicates first 2 factors of test 🡪 doesn't favor idea of courts setting a price for patent w/ damages b/c unfair to inventor in garage that only makes money by selling inventions 🡪 drags inventor into courts to battle for price of patent when market should set the price

- But patent owner is not entitled to permanent injunction or justify a general rule.

**Kennedy Concurring**

- Concerned about patent trolls - an injunction can be employed as a bargaining tool to charge exorbitant fees to companies that seek to buy licenses to practice the patent.

- Also considering the burgeoning number of patents over business methods and their consequences, the potential **vagueness** and **suspect validity** of some patents may affect 4-factor calculus. 🡪 concerned about modern tech and how times are changing

| - **Regarding deterrence in contract settings** (e.g. medical malpractice or products liability): If people aren't willing to pay higher fee as insurance for P&S, then P&S damages shouldn't be awarded.

[532 Madision Ave. v. Finlandia]{.underline} (businesses sued for street closures that resulted from DF's construction project disasters, there was no actual property or personal damage)

- PL: argue DFs owe duty to keep premises safe and extends to economic losses

- Foreseeability of harm does not define duty 🡪 there must be injury, otherwise no limit

- [Strauss v. Belle Realty]{.underline} (PL injured in fall on darkened staircase during citywide blackout)

  - Injures were foreseeable, but no contractual relationship btwn PL and utility for lighting in building's common areas.

  - Policy: restricted liability to damages to direct customers of utility to avoid crushing exposure to suits from millions of consumers

- Recognizes the policy driven line of avoiding too much liability is arbitrary and does cut off liability to foreseeable PLs, but says foreseeability is NOT limiting enough.

- Better to stick to traditional tort law and only allow recovery based on actual damage.

- **Possible other ways to limit:**

  - Geographic lines (police cordon)

  - NJ law 🡪 forseeability

  - Big/small loss amount of economic losses

  - Contract?

\*How do we make sense of words like 'reprehensibility' or other confusing verbal formulations of punitive damages?

- Courts don't explain what they mean, no guidance. Completely open-ended. Just make best arguments based on past cases, policy rationales, etc.

- Very limited containing power -- you can argue whatever you want. You can use the words to work around even suggested quantitative caps.

**How to use the limitations?**

Exxon 1:1 cap is ONLY binding on federal common law case, particularly maritime cases

- When might it be persuasive?

  - Other federal punitive damages cases based on federal statutes or tort law.

- Only argumentatively useful?

  - Cases that are similar, but not in same jurisdiction.

State court limitations ONLY bind in the particular state.

Constitutional Limits of PD (BMW/SF/PM) 🡪 binding for EVERYONE b/c supremacy.

[Exxon Shipping v. Grant Baker]{.underline} (2008) (Supertanker recklessly grounded on reef in Alaska and spilled lots of oil. Case consolidates all classes of plaintiffs for one big PD decision.)

- Compensatory damages were about \$500 million, Alaska District Court set PD at \$5 billion. Court of Appeals remanded twice saying PD was too high, eventually it cut damages to \$2.5 billion.

- Generally there is DP limitation to control PD 🡪 single-digit ratio is best and when CD is large, better to have smaller ratio.

- Key goal is to set federal common law (maritime) penalties to be reasonably predictable in severity and increase consistency.

- Rejects verbal approach and hard dollar cap.

- Yay ratio approach! More predictable b/c pegged to CD.

- State usually us 3:1 ratio, but better to use actual media ratio which is actually 0.65:1.

- So hold that 1:1 is a fair upper limit.

[Pinto Case]{.underline} (Pinto struck in rear by another car, results in gas tank rupture and fire. Driver killed and passenger burnt. Jury: CD is \$2.5 mill. and PD is \$125 mill. Trial court reduces to \$3.5 mill.)

- Memo surfaces that Ford had compared cost of safer fuel system and decide not worth redesign 🡪 life was valued at \$200,000 🡪 made jury very angry and give big PD

- Ironically, the memo was not about design of Pinot and the \# use was from regulatory agency.

- Paradox of tort law 🡪 we like cost-benefit analysis, but public attitudes says this is reprehensible. Raises question of viability of risk-benefit standard.

[Philip Morris v. Williams (2007)]{.underline} (PM is sued for death of heavy cigarette smoker, PM makes Marlboro. Jury found death was caused by smoking and Williams smoked b/c PM falsely led him to believe that smoking was safe. Jury found PM engaged in deceit, awarded CD of \$821,000 and PD of \$80 million. Trial judge reduced PD to \$32 million, but Court of Appeals restored to larger amount)

- Questions: Should PD include non-party harm? And is 100:1 ratio too high?

- **No Decision on ratio question**: we do not know what kinds of extraordinary cases could justify departure from the single-digit ratio set by *State Farm*.

- **Breyer**: standards guy, he likes discretion, doesn\'t want to answer ration question.

- DP clause does not allow punishing of non-party victims

  - can't punish w/out giving DF opportunity to present every available defense

  - AND non-party question is too speculative, how many victims? How serious injured? What circumstances? Increases arbitrariness.

- You can consider non-party harms to determine the '**reprehensibility'** of the act

  - Must use non-party harms to explain how bad the harm was, need to punish them.

  - If there is a discrete harm (direct-letter campaign), you can divide up the badness of the harm for each piece of mail. This is the harm, and that is what PD is for.

  - If there is a generalized ad-campaign 🡪 harder for DF to divide the 'badness,' PL has easier job to prove badness of the one act.

- Upon request, court must protect against risk that harm to others will affect PD decision, not just reprehensibility calculation. 🡪 jury instruction that PM wants should be granted.

- **Considerations:** what is the actual difference btwn reprehensibility and punishing?

  - Don't want double punishment.

  - But optimal deterrence may require that we need to punish more because otherwise, PM won't be properly deterred to stop tortious action, esp. if making lots of monies 🡪 maybe difference should be based on how likely other party victims will come to collect?

- **Stevens Dissent:** This difference eludes me. Worried about jury confusion. Should just allow jury to consider harm to non-parties.

  - PD is sanction for public harm of DF's conduct, so it should be allowed.

  - Awarding CD to 3^rd^ parties is DP violation, but PD serves different purpose.

  - Courts should be reluctant to expand substantive due process.

- **Thomas Dissent:** Constitution does not constraint PD awards

- **Ginsberg Dissent**: PD is to punish, not compensate, Oregon is right. PM only contested refusal to give jury instruction, which was a confusing instruction anyways. And court should narrowly tailor its holding to this jury instruction.

**[Repetitive Awards]{.underline}** -- Courts can award both compensatory and punitive damages repetitively

- Too much: no deterrence after a while, what if company goes bankrupt.

- Too little: even total of all CDs + PDs might not be enough to stop tortious action.

- And sometimes too little if only fraction of victims actually bring the case.

- Offset punitive damages for future plaintiffs?

  - Requires a guessing game, you can try to estimate total amount of PD and divide it based on anticipated defendants, but what if estimate is wrong? And how do we decide upon a fixed punitive damage number, especially if not pegged to CD

[W.R. Grace v. Waters]{.underline} (mass tort involving asbestos products, court refused to bar multiple awards of punitive damages)

- Generally courts have declined to bar multiple punitive damages.

- They say that it is unfair to plaintiffs to bar latter ones from recovering punitive damages.

- It might be somewhat unfair to make defendants pay multiple punitive damage awards, but no good system is in place.

- Multiple damages on same conduct is not per se unconstitutional, but might be challenged if the total sum becomes too high or defendant cannot pay the damages.

- One suggestion is to advise jury of previous punitive damage awards so that they award smaller punitive damages.

- Might hurt DF because it tells jury that the DF was guilty in previous trials.

- Solution is bifurcated proceeding where first step is one liability, second step is amount of compensatory damages, and last step is liability for punitive damages.

  - This would allow defendant to build a record for due process argument based on cumulative effect of prior awards

[Sony v. Tenenbaum (1st Cir, 2013)]{.underline} (DF downloaded and distributed copyrighted music w/out authorization. He knew it was illegal. Sony pursued claims under the Copyright Act for 30 works. The Act provides for damages between \$750 to \$150,000 for each willful violation. Jury awarded \$22,500 for each infringement (15% of statutory max) for a total of \$675,000.)

- [*Williams* Case]{.underline} (Arkansas statute says RR must pay \$50-300, for each offense of charging passengers fares that exceed legal limits. RR collected fare that was 66 cents more from 2 passengers. Each passenger was awarded \$75.)

  - RR challenged award as excessive under DP.

  - Court rejected the argument, holding that a statutory damage violated DP only where penalty prescribed is **so severe and oppressive as to be wholly disproportionate to the offense and obviously unreasonable.**

- Statutory damages in this case provide both reparation for injury but also **discourages wrongful conduct 🡪** DF's activities were exactly what Congress was trying to deter.

- So award of \$22,500/song, only 15% of max is w/in due process.

- But statutory damages are not to be confined or proportioned to loss/damage of the private party. **The legislature may adjust its amount to the public wrong rather than the private injury.**

[Wal-Mart v. Dukes (SCOTUS 2010)]{.underline} (Class action suit, of all women employees (former and current) of Wal-mart stores, against Wal-Mart for Title VII discrimination based on disparate impact on a facially neutral policy of allowing managers broad discretion in pay and promotion decisions. The class sought both injunctive and declaratory relief, as well as back-pay damages.)

- Question of interest: what is needed to certify a FRCP 23b(2) damages class?

- Instead Scalia decides to reject the class action based on **Rule 23(a), commonality**.

- Redefines commonality from common question to **common** **answer 🡪** class members must have suffered the **same injury**, not just suffered a violation of the same law

- Claims all depend on a common contention that can be resolved in a **single stroke,** dissimilarities btwn class members can prevent a common answer

- There must be **some glue** that holds class together

- Mere pleading is no longer enough, requires actual proof 🡪 may lead to overlap in proof on merits of the case, but this is ok

- Possible examples that meet common answer test:

  - One common test w/ disparate impact

  - One manger acts discriminatorily

  - Single store? Geographic?

- **Policy Concern:** Courts are worried about how once class action is certified, company defendants almost ALWAYS settle 🡪 worried about extortion from PLs

- **Ginsberg Dissent:** Disparate impact has always been enough for a class action under Title VII 🡪 law is being changed.

  - Case is about pattern and practice, the point is no a single manager, but a policy that effects all class members

  - Scalia is confused, he is doing predominance analysis in commonality

[Parko v. Shell Oil (2014)]{.underline} (Oil refinery next to village leaks benezene into groundwater. Property owners want class to sue Shell Oil for lost property values. DF's appeal class certification.)

- Numerosity 🡪 it does not matter if there are uninjured parties in the class, courts can kick out uninjured party members later

- Commonality 🡪 Collapses commonality and predominance together.

  - Predominance is qualitative, must look at case as a whole.

  - Question: are injuries common enough to make class action efficient and more superior than individual suits?

  - Mere assertion that common issues predominate are not enough 🡪 must have proof, court must receive evidence

- DF's arguments for why common issues do not predominate:

  - 90 years of contamination w/ multiple sources/polluters

  - No evidence that class members were actually injured 🡪 did not reach water supply, so no theory connecting groundwater contamination to lost property values

  - Relevance of common question? No one drank the contaminated water...

  - Alt causes: housing bubble, financial crisis

- [Met-Coil]{.underline} Case (TCE contaminated groundwater from a leak in a storage container)

  - Posner says this satisfies common answer requirement:

    - TCE entered water supply from wells

    - Same and single source of TCE

    - Theory presented on how contaminated well-water depressed property values of all homes in area

[Butler v. Sears]{.underline} (Selling washing machines that get moldy and smell bad, certified class action for all owners of washing machines by the company)

- Tried to certify class of buyers of washing machines of different models and most members of class were actually no injured

- Posner says different injuries and types of machines don't matter 🡪 still can certify class b/c we can use sub-classes and issue classes

[In re Deepwater Horizon (2014)]{.underline} (Started as MDL, but BP agreed to a Settlement Agreement and Class certification of all the cases. The district court certified the class and the settlement, emphasizing the \'uncapped compensation\' that would be available so that benefits to one member of the class will not reduce or interfere w/ benefit for another class member.)

- BP was in a hurry to settle b/c feared looking bad in the criminal trial against USG, worried that they would get more fault allocated to them, so wanted to settle before criminal trial made them look more guilty.

- Settlement agreement:

  - No cap on fund 🡪 money will never run out

  - Replaced the voluntary fund (GCCF) run by Feinberg (\$20 billion)

  - Formula does not require proof of causation

- BP regrets this settlement now esp. b/c there are claimants who didn't actually get injured that are now collecting compensation

**January Class Certification Challenge (FRCP 23):**

BP does not bring objection b/c they agreed to class certification, but class is challenged by 3^rd^ party objectors

- Rule 23(a)(2) **Commonality** -- DF says commonality requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that class members have suffered the same injury 🡪 preclude all plaintiffs that suffered no injury

  - one contention that is central to the validity of each class member\'s claims - does not need to relate to damages component of the claim

  - the same injury can refer to the same conduct related to defendant\'s liability

  - A single common question will do. Long list of common questions.

  - And court does not need to determine whether class contains individuals who have not suffered an injury, because that would be a part of the merits.

- Rule 23(a)(4) - Adequacy - BP argues that because class includes people not injured, the inclusion of non-injured members, makes injured members worse off b/c less monies. And hurt their bargaining power during negotiations.

  - District court held named plaintiffs were adequate b/c included members asserting each category of loss and had adequate counsel.

  - Uncapped compensation available under agreement ensured that benefit to one member would not affect benefit obtained by another member of the class.

- Cobb Objectors argued for **subclass** for states and for members better off under GCCF claims process.

  - Does not need to accommodate every possible weighted interest.

  - Because claim arises under federal law, no need for different class by state.

  - And it is incorporated in agreement because there is already sub-class based on geography and level of harm based on proximity to coast.

  - And no evidence of cause of claimants disadvantage under new settlement agreement.

- Rule 23(b)(3) -- **predomination -** Wide disparity in amount of damages does not preclude class certification when every issue is a common issue

  - Especially okay b/c court divides issues so that they resolve issues common to class and reserve damages for individual determination.

 

**March Contract Dispute: (**The settlement agreement did not require an extrinsic causation analysis in paying damages. Is this okay if class certification did require causation?)

- Contract has explicit language disclaiming the need for proof of causation.

- Only required V or U curve in profits, so after spill, biz dropped, then recovered

  - Can be both under and over-inclusive

- However, the contract did make claimants **certify** that they were injured because of oil spill 🡪 gets around class certification problem b/c there is an affidavit of causation

- BP challenges:

  - Says there will be a chilling effect for future class actions and settlements

  - Unfair to those actually injured if uninjured gets monies 🡪 hurts legitimacy

  - BP just wants administrator to screen claims that are super obviously fraudulent

- Why is this settlement good?

  - Better for people who can't afford to bring proof of causation

  - Point is to help people who deserve money but are disadvantaged

  - Screening might take more time and hurt people who actually do need monies

  - Administrator can make mistakes, better to have false positives

  - More deterrent effect on oil companies to take more care
