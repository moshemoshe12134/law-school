GENERAL THEMES + CONSIDERATIONS OF TORTS

ELEMENTS OF A TORT

I.  **Duty**

II. **Breach of duty**

III. **Causation**

     a.  **"but for" cause, AND**

     b.  **proximate cause**

IV. **Damages**

THEMES OF TORT LAW

**Types of arguments**

I.  Human -- who is more blameworthy? Who can pay? Shared blame or innocent victim? Consistency? Fairness?

II. Policy -- easy/less costly to administer? What activities do we want to encourage? Incentives for the party most equipped to deal with the risks?

III. Legalistic -- is there an easy default rule or precedent? Who is deciding? Are juries in a place to decide well?

**Who is making the decision?** -- judge vs. jury

- courts v. legislature

- ask: are there institutional competencies/information?

AIMS OF TORT LAW

I.  **Deterrence vs. compensation**

II. **Fairness vs. blameworthiness**

III. **Risk spreading vs. social welfare**

CONFLICTING AIMS OF TORT LAW

I.  **Corrective justice and civil redress**

    - tort law to restore moral balance between wrong-doer and victim

    - way of providing victims with recourse for civil wrongs

    - PROS: justifies sense of moral blame; works well for individuals; vindicates victim; disincentives wrong doer

    - CONS: less applicable when DF is faceless corporation; liability insurance covers individuals

II. **Optimal deterrence**

    - Deter excessively risky activity so losses are worth it (BPL)

    - PROS: most economic solution, doesn't require foregoing activity benefits

    - CONS: ignores human values like pain & suffering and reduces to economic value

III. **Loss distribution**

     - Promotes the broad distribution of losses due to accident/injury

     - PROS: Among all other things equal, having large number of people bear small loss is better than having single person bear all of it

     - CONS: Does not satisfy sense of moral blame; tort law system is an expensive mechanism for distributing losses (insurance, social security are cheaper)

IV. **Compensation**

    - Promote compensation to those who have suffered injury

    - PROS: Makes people feel more secure that they will be compensated for the harm they suffered

    - CONS: We need more than injury to justify liability, so there needs to be more than just the goal of compensation

CHEAPEST COST AVOIDER -- Calabresi's aim for tort law

Assigns liability to the party that best knows the risks/harms, the precautions possible, and the law

- Aims: optimal deterrence, minimize costs

  - Compensation goals: promote societal distribution of losses

    - Fairness/deterrence issue: can't just get richest person to pay if the person at fault gets off free; need to deter the person doing the dangerous activity

  - Deterrence goals: minimize precaution costs

    - Regulation (specific deterrence) -- no need for causation; or general deterrence (e.g. tax) -- works through causation

      - Controls care and activity levels

- Policy concerns: is the cheapest cost avoider always fair?

- CONS:

  - What if there is incomplete knowledge or a 3^rd^ party has the best knowledge?

  - No consideration of morality or blameworthiness; trading minimal costs with other aims of tort law

  - Deep costs/most able to bear cost has no relation with causation

  - Can be inconsistent as technology/circumstances change (CCA doesn't care who was liable before; will shift liability as long as technology shifts)

*Hammontree v. Jenner* (CA 1971*)* -- Jenner has epileptic seizure and runs car into Hammontree's shop; had long history of seizures but doctor approved his driver's license.

+--------+----------------------------+----------------------------------------+

NEGLIGENCE

Negligence is failure to exercise the care that would have been exercised by the reasonably prudent person under the circumstances 🡪 breached the duty of due care

- Consider: what are the exceptions to the reasonable person standard?

- Note that unintentional act can be tortious if negligent

**"Ordinary care..."**

*Brown v. Kendall* (MA 1850)

- [Facts]{.underline}: Dog fight--- in attempting to break up the fight with a stick, the DF accidentally struck the PL in the eye. Claim of trespass (direct harm)

- [Principles]{.underline}:

  - Judgment standard is "did DF take ordinary care in the circumstances?"

  - PL has burden of proving intent or negligence

  - Recognition that PL contributed to accident in some way -- "takes 2 to tort"

  - Judge Shaw -- changes standard to ordinary care, with burden on PL to prove lack of ordinary care

*Adams v. Bullock* (NY 1919)

- [Facts]{.underline}: Boy swings huge wire around which catches onto the wiring of trolley and electrocutes him; sues trolley company for negligence in preventing accident

- [Holding]{.underline}: not negligent

  - Trolley company was operating lawfully; PL did not show evidence of failure to take reasonable care; unreasonable to ask the company to prevent unreasonable accidents (expensive, impractical)

- Policy consideration: would deter industrial growth; not worth preventing

**"...in the circumstances"**

*Daniels v. Clegg*

- [Facts]{.underline}: daughter driving buggy; Daniels on wrong side of the road hits her, daughter's dad sues & Daniels claims negligence

- [Holding]{.underline}: not negligent -- given instructions to compare Clegg to "woman of her age"

*Railway Co. v. Tankersley*

- [Facts]{.underline}: woman injured trying to get on train in skirt

- [Holding]{.underline}: negligent -- should not have tried to get on knowing it was dangerous for her condition

\*compare *Daniels* and *Tankersley*; personal circumstances of each PL are used differently by the court. The 'ordinary reasonable person' can still be very broad

**When to into account special characteristics**

- **physical infirmity**: usually considered part of the "circumstances"; so would be taken into account if reasonable person would take it into account; subjective because physical disabilities are easier to see/prove than mental; can raise standard of care for disabled DFs

- **mental infirmity**: no (objective standard)

- **expertise/superiority**: yes; help---e.g. novice could not have made the turn but he was better and still could not avoid, so circumstances; hurt -- expert had information to know better

- **kids**: semi-objective; expected to exercise care for a reasonable child of similar age/experience, unless engaged in "adult activity" (depends on state---cf. *Goss v. Allen*, where skiing was not adult activity because it's recreational, but driving is since it requires a license)

- **emergencies**: part of the 'circumstances' (cf. *Levey*; "honest exercise of judgment")

- **sex**: no; ordinary reasonable standard

Taking characteristics into account can help lower the standard by lowering expectations; this cuts both ways, and can also be used to heighten standard

- if not a category that allows special consideration, consider the circumstances/use a proxy (e.g. height, physical composition vs. sex, mental ability)

- In judging contributory negligence, DF's internal circumstances become part of PL's external circumstances (cf. *Clegg*)

**Res ipsa loquitor** -- when circumstantial evidence shows DF was negligent without needing proof of exactly how (e.g. car hitting sidewalk). Requirements:

1.  event causing injury must be one that ordinarily occurs because of DF negligence

2.  causes other than negligence are sufficiently eliminated

3.  (instrumentality in DF's control & no voluntary action/contribution by PL)

- forces DF to defend rather than motion for directed verdict/piggyback off PL's failure for direct evidence

*Bethel v. NYC Transit Authority* (1998 Ct. App. NY) (49)

- [Facts]{.underline}: Wheelchair seat on bus collapses

- [Holding]{.underline}:

- [Principle]{.underline}: ends common carrier's duty for extraordinary care

*Wood v. Groh*

- [Facts]{.underline}: 15yo takes father's disassembled gun, kills someone

- [Principle]{.underline}: highest care

*Levey v. DeNordo* (50)

- **Emergency doctrine** -- asks for "honest exercise of judgment"

*Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co. v. Goodman* (1927 S. Ct.)

- [Facts]{.underline}: guy driving across railway; house blocks sight so listens for train; gets hit

- [Holding]{.underline}: Judge Holmes -- holds that you always have to get out and look (rule); therefore PL failed to take reasonable care

  - Bright-line rule; Holmes grants directed verdict

  - **Judge vs. jury decision** of what constitutes ordinary care---does the judge know better?

*Pokora v. Wabash Railway Co.* (1934 S. Ct.)

- [Facts]{.underline}: car driving across railway; another train blocking view

- [Holding]{.underline}: Judge Cardozo -- Holmes' rule can be just as dangerous

  - does not overturn *Goodman*

BPL TEST -- Learned Hand's Economic Theory of Tort Law

*United States v. Carroll Towing Co.* (1947)

- [Facts]{.underline}: negligently secured barge breaks off and hits tanker; barge sinks with cargo

- [Holding]{.underline}: (Judge Hand) negligent for not having bargee on board during workday (low burden of increased precaution); reversed and remanded for damage allocation.

- [Principle]{.underline}: responsibility is a function of BPL:

  1)  **P: Probability the harm occurs**

  2)  **L: Amount of injury in case of harm**

  3)  **B: Burden of taking more precaution**

<!-- -->

- If B \> PL, society is better off lettering the accident happen

- Unclear whose harms count---DF/world/proximate cause & foreseeable harms?

Aims of tort law: deterrence/incentives, fairness in terms of foreseeability, distribute losses

Foreseeability vs. probability -- tort law can only make people liable for foreseeable things, but foreseeability needs to be cut off somewhere (e.g. loss of flour can't be attributed to possibly losing the war)

- Exam: note the scope of a BPL argument---everything can be construed as very big or very small; where do you cut it off Is it a planning tool or just an articulated judicial justification?

**Criticisms & counterarguments of BPL**

- Difficult to measure P and L; there are costs to calculating costs

  - Relative measure, only need for comparison to B

- Fairness vs. economic theory

  - Makes you weigh other peoples' benefits equally

- Comparability/commensurability -- e.g. losing a leg; requires DF to value cost of actions

  - Things must be valued anyways, no reason not to do it here

- Juries may ignore BPL

**Restatement 3^rd^ on Hand Formula**

- **Negligence Defined**: A **person acts negligently** if the person does not exercise **reasonable care under all the circumstances**. Primary factors to consider in ascertaining whether the person's conduct lacks reasonable care are the **foreseeable likelihood that the person's conduct will result in harm**, the **foreseeable severity of any harm that may ensue**, and the **burden of precautions to eliminate or reduce the risk of harm.**

- Correctly articulates the difference between probability and foreseeability (BPL is about foreseeable probability, not actual)

MEDICAL MALPRACTICE

Majority rule: compliance with custom = no liability at all; failure to comply = malpractice (some states recognize custom of a 'respectable minority')

- Pros: juries don\'t do well with complicated medical info, so easy guideline

- Cons: takes the question

*Sheeley v. Memorial Hospital* (RI S.C.1998)

- [Principles]{.underline}: DF petititoned for **strict locality rule** (expert witness must be in the same practice area and locality as DF doctor)

- [Holding]{.underline}: strict locality rule readapted to be "same or similar"; more general standard

ROLE OF PLAINTIFF -- CONTRIBUTORY AND COMPARATIVE NEGLIENCE

STATUTORY NEGLIGENCE (NEGLIGENCE PER SE)

Pros

- Legislature represents society's expectations

- Legislature has better info about what goes on

Cons

- Legislature unable to think about specific circumstances

- Can be cases in which following statutes would be more dangerous

*Martin v. Herzog* (Ct. App. NY 1920)

- [Facts]{.underline}: PL driving, hit by DF, claims negligence against DF for using wrong side of road; DF claims contributory negligence PL for not using lights (as a matter of law; rule-like)

- [Holding]{.underline}: for DF -- omission of lights is negligent

  - Denied DF's request for jury instruction that PL violated statute; can take into account but not conclusive

  - Cardozo disagrees with disregard of statute instruction

*Tedla v. Ellaman* (Ct. App. NY 1939)

- [Facts]{.underline}: 2 pedestrians walking on the same side of traffic instead of against because were carrying things and were hit by car; DF claims contributory negligence

- [Holding]{.underline}: for PL; distinguishes from *Martin v. Herzog*

  - Negligence is failure to exercise care required by law; without a defined standard, PLs were right to use judgment to preserve life

**statutory purpose**: courts unwilling to enforce statute if the harm was different than what the statute was meant to protect

- e.g. sheep fall overboard because they weren't in pens; can't use Contagious Diseases Act against the lack of pens because statute wasn't meant for sheep falling overboard

- *De Haan v. Rockwood Sprinkler Co.*: radiator fell down shaft but rule was meant to keep people from falling in

- **TEST: look to legislative history/preamble; and consider whether violation does or doesn't increase risk of harm to the PL**

+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------+-----------------+

**custom**: can serve as guide for proper standard, but doesn't displace reasonable person standard

1)  Pros: court may not know what is reasonable in a technical field

2)  Cons: custom can change slowly relative to technology

*TJ Hooper*

- [Facts]{.underline}: barges; failed to have reliable radios on tugboat; statute for radios only applied to steamers

  - Trial court says negligence because radios were nearly universal custom for tugs

- [Holding]{.underline}: Appeals court says not custom

**CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE**

If PL was negligent, no recovery

**COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE**

Pure comparative negligence: recovery is inversely proportional to PL's contribution to negligence

Modified comparative negligence: proportional recovery unless PL's negligence exceeds 50% (then nothing)

- How do you determine percentage of fault?

- Jury interpreting close calls in favour of plaintiff?

- What about multiple parties (1/3 negligence?)

**\**

**STRICT LIABILITY**

Liability without finding fault (does not need to prove negligence or intent) -- usually for inherently dangerous activities (like explosives)

- Aiming to deter activity, not just taking precautions

- Judge chooses whether to apply strict liability or negligence standard

- The courts/juries decide negligence standard behaviour, but individuals decide their own activity levels under strict liability

- Strict liability doesn't judge blameworthiness -- maybe not fair to make someone pay unless they did something wrong

- **Often applied when DF is the cheapest cost avoider**

- Pros:

  - Reduce costs where cost of fact finding is high (e.g. destroyed evidence)

  - Less error than negligence evaluation because that requires more fact assessment

  - Incentivizes research into cost-effective safety measures

  - Internalizes externalities and regulates dangerous activity

  - Large institutions are better able to absorb cost of non-negligent accident

- Cons:

  - More claims when B \> PL

  - Consequences of mistake are worse; person would be sanctioned for efficient conduct

  - Could be cheaper to pay damages than change activity levels

  - Some activities have no alternative, or current activity level is already desirable

  - Tort law is more expensive than insurance market

*Rylands v. Fletcher* (Exchequer Chamber 1866, House of Lords 1868)

- [Facts]{.underline}: PL's property damaged by flooding from DF's reservoir

  - What duty does DF have? Absolute or reasonable care?

- [Holding]{.underline}: strict liability for escaping things for unnatural use unless it was the PL's fault

  - if natural/common, PL is in better position to protect self

*Indiana Harbour Belt Railroad Co. v. American Cyanamid Co.*

- [Facts]{.underline}: DF contracts rail car to ship chemical to NJ; switches through PL's rail line; chemicals leak

- [Holding]{.underline}: no strict liability

  - Strict liability would apply for explosions because evidence would be destroyed -- here it's just a leak

  - No alternative method to transport -- strict liability can't help regulate activity levels

  - Could avert risk by increased precautions/not being negligent -- no need for strict liability?

**Restatement 1^st^** "ultra-hazardous" instead of abnormally dangerous -- high risk of harm that cannot be eliminated with due care and not in common usage

**Restatement 2^nd^** factors to consider to decide whether something should use strict liability

- High risk

- High harm

- Can't avoid using due care

- Uncommon use

- Use not appropriate to place

- Value to society of activity

**Restatement 3^rd^** two requirements to be *abnormally dangerous*

- Action creates foreseeable and highly significant risk of harm despite the exercise of reasonable care

- Activity isn't common usage

\*do not forget all elements of tort are needed: duty, causation, damages; and role of PL/contributory/comparative negligence still apply

*Guille v. Swan*

- [Facts]{.underline}: hot air balloon lands in NYC; spectators trample vegetable garden

- [Holding]{.underline}: balloonist liable

*Doerr v. Goldsmith* (2013)

A.  [Facts]{.underline}: DFs calling dog across roadway; PL hits dog; claims negligence

- Previous courts only held strict liability for showing viciousness of animals

<!-- -->

- [Holding]{.underline}: dog was instrument of DF's negligence

B.  Strict liability for animals:

    - If vicious -- strict liability

    - If escape -- strict liability (cf. *Rylands*)

**Comparing effects of DF negligence theories on the PL**

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          [Rule for DF]{.underline}                                  [Rule for PL]{.underline}
  ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 No liability                                          Like strict liability

               Strict liability                                          Like no liability

                  Negligence                                  Strict liability unless DF is negligent

     Negligence + contributory negligence     Like strict liability unless DF is negligence *and* PL is not negligent

   Negligence + pure comparative negligence             Like strict liability minus comparative negligence
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**SL v. N: Institutional Competence and Aims of Tort Law**

Individual Decisions and Role of Courts:

- SL 🡪 Liable for harm for certain types of activities despite level of care. Activity level itself is the liability, even though care level can still be affected. Individual figures out activity level & care level. Pay your way.

- N 🡪 Court/jury determines whether the care level is sufficient (court determines CCA; labeling DF as neg = CCA), but also affects activity level (individual determines). Pay your way unless you took the appropriate care.

- Institutional competence question: Do actors make better determinations about who the CCA is or does jury/court? [Institutional argument for SL:]{.underline}

  - Individuals are better at determining CCA.

  - Courts rely on [customary evidence]{.underline} for negligence analysis, but custom may be off-based bc the industry is behind times or may be colluding.

If SL works so well, why do we need N? [Is SL better for finding the cheapest cost avoider]{.underline}?

- If N is good enough for controlling activity and care levels, we shouldn't go to SL bc other aims of tort law (fairness & blameworthiness) push for N. N is default and should resort to SL only if N doesn't suffice. (Posner)

**\**

**DUTY**

To consider: did you create the risk? Are you increasing the relative risk? (more duty the more responsible you are for the risk); in general, there is no affirmative duty to rescue others from 3^rd^ party harms unrelated to the DF (nonfeasance)

*Moch Case* (NY 1928)

1)  [Facts]{.underline}: PLs warehouse caught fire, suing waterworks DF for failing to provide adequate water as per contract

2)  [Holding]{.underline}: no tort action available to users of city water supply

**Medical rescue**: if you start rescue, you have duty to rescue non-negligently (would deter other people from attempting rescue) (even if no one is there)

**Special relationship**: (e.g. parents) -- where you have an affirmative duty to step in

**Informed consent**: patient can sue if doctor was not negligent but physical harm occurred such that PL would not have consented to the procedure if he had been adequately informed

- **reasonable patient standard**: requires doctor to disclose what a reasonable person in the patient's situation would want to know (takes into account idiosyncrasies)

- **reasonable physician/standard practice**: treats informed consent like malpractice; PL must prove doctor failed to comply with standards of the position

*Cuyler v. United States* (2004)

- [Facts]{.underline}: abusive babysitter, another family sues hospital for not reporting abuse

- [Principle]{.underline}: no duty; no special relationship

  - Few jurisdictions have affirmative duties

  - Right to mind your own business

*Tarasoff v. Regents of University of California* (CA S.Ct. 1976) (151)

- [Facts]{.underline}: PL sued psychologist treating killer for not warning victim---death proximately resulted from failure to warn

- [Holding]{.underline}: court doesn't actually go through balancing test, but says special relationship to killer creates duty

- [Principles]{.underline}:

  - Expansion of special relationship to psychologist-patient

  - Balancing test

    - Foreseeability of harm

    - Certainty of injury

    - Causal link

    - Moral blame

    - Policy of prevention

    - Burden to DF

    - Consequences to community for risk

    - Possibility of insurance

*Hood v. Ryobi America Corp* (4^th^ Cir. Ct. App. 1999)

- Guy took off saw guards despite warnings, gets injured

- Ct. holds for DF---no need to specify all possibilities; danger of too many warnings

**FEDERAL PRE-EMPTION**

**Express**: if state law is parallel to fed law, pre-empted only if different from or in addition to

**Implied**: can be "field" (takes over entire area of regulation) or "conflict" (federal wins in case they contradict)

*Stengel v. Medtronic* (D.Ct. AZ 2012)

- Facts: MDA has express pre-emption clause so states cannot have laws different or above federal statute requirement

- [Holding]{.underline}: Ct. holds that state law duty to report to FDA is parallel to MDA---not pre-empted

*Exxon* & punitive damages

- Are punitive damages pre-empted by the CWA? -- court says no, because would also preclude compensatory damages

- Congress must have clear intent for field pre-emption

- Is tort law/punitive damages parallel to or on top of regulatory penalties?

**VICARIOUS LIABILITY**

**Respondeat superior**: employer is liable for certain torts committed by employees; SL tort because employer does not need to be negligent (just employee while in scope of employment); since employer is in better position to make decisions on activity level and etc.; saves info cost because no need to prove negligent employer

- Who is an employee?

  - Seeks to distinguish between situations in which strict liability will have a desirable effect and when it will not

  - Does not include independent contractors (e.g. homeowner hires an electrician)

- When is a tort committed within the scope of employment?

  - Limits the effects of strict liability on employers

  - Employers do not have infinite capacity to control the conduct of their employees

  - Distinguishes between a \"detour\" and a \"frolic\" -- NOT a bright-line rule

  - Employer liable for tortious acts committed on a \"mere\" detour but not on a frolic

- Respondeat superior re: Exxon -- court was split 4:4 on vicarious liability for company

  - BP may or may not be liable for actions of employees (although politically too risky to litigate)

**CAUSATION**

Causation can help promote optimal deterrence

- e.g. BP had no causation requirement; PROS: more deterrence for very reprehensible acts; but CONS: deterring useful activities for society, and over deterrence doesn't help anything

- you want to deter the actual risk you're trying to prevent, not freak accidents (cf. child dropping guns)

- harm has to be foreseeable for the deterrence to work---people aren't deterred from taking risks they don't know are risks

**CAUSE-IN-FACT**

**Types of cause-in-fact:**

I.  But for

II. Multiple necessary causes (MNC)

III. Multiple sufficient causes (MSC)

IV. Joint

**Questions of proof**

I.  Preponderance

II. 'Alternative liability'

III. Market share

**Allocation of money**

I.  Joint & several liability

II. Market share

**"But for"** **test**: if but for the DF's negligence, PL would not have suffered the harm, then DF's action was a cause-in-fact

Cause-in-fact and **informed consent**: PL must show "but for" DF's lack of disclosure, PL would not have suffered harm

- Fully objective standard: objective reasonable person without idiosyncrasies

- Semi objective standard: PL allowed to testify and preferences are factored in

*Aegis Insurance v. Two World Trade Center*

- [Facts]{.underline}: Con Ed sues TWTC for negligent construction after building collapses in 9/11

- [Holding]{.underline}: not a cause-in-fact; events were too big to expect TWTC to foresee and protect against

  - With everything going on, difficult to say that but for the negligent design the incident would/would not have happened

*Summers v. Tice* (S.Ct. CA 1948) (367)

- [Facts]{.underline}: two hunters both negligently shot towards PL; only one caused damage

- [Holding]{.underline}: both DFs are liable--- move burden on DF to prove they didn't do it (knowledge lies with DF)

- [Policy]{.underline}: burden of proof on party with more information; PL gets recovery (fairness)

**MULTIPLE CAUSES**

**MULTIPLE SUFFICIENT CAUSES (MSC):** any one act is enough for the injury 🡪 all DFs may be held 100% liable (division depends on regime---see joint/several liability); cannot recover more than 100%

**Restatement 3^rd^ on "but for" test for MSC**

- **§ 26 (Factual Cause):**

  - **Tortious conduct** must be a factual cause of harm for liability to be imposed. Conduct is a factual cause of harm when the harm would not have occurred absent the conduct. Tortious conduct may also be a factual cause of harm under § 27

- **§ 27 (Multiple Sufficient Causes):**

  - If multiple acts occur, each of which under R3T 26 alone would have been a factual cause of the physical harm at the same time in the absence of the other act(s), each act is regarded as a **factual cause of the harm**

- If one sufficient cause is non tortious:

  - *assigns cause-in-fact, then leaves to the law of damages to sort out who really ends up paying*

  - **§ 27 comment (d): one cause tortious, the other innocent**. [This Section applies in a case of MSC, regardless of whether the competing cause involves tortious conduct or consists only of innocent conduct]{.underline}. Conduct is a factual cause of harm regardless of any other cause with which it concurs to produce overdetermined harm. Question of damages is different matter

**MULTIPLE NECESSARY CAUSES (MNC)**: all acts are necessary for the injury 🡪 DF liability is assigned by proportion of cause; is a cause in fact under common law and Restatement 3^rd^ § 26

**MSC vs MNC**

- PL would want to argue for MNC (that one cause was not sufficient; e.g. one fire would not overwhelm sprinklers); therefore both DFs are liable

- DF would want to argue for MSC, then claim his action was the non-tortious one

**LOST CHANCE**

*Matsuyama v. Birnbaum* (355)

- [Facts]{.underline}: DF failed to diagnose cancer; medial malpractice claim for death

- [Holding]{.underline}: defined injury as lost chance

- **Lost chance damage calculation**:

1)  Full amount of damages allowed for injury

2)  Patients chance of survival before malpractice

3)  Chance of survival because of malpractice

4)  ( (2) -- (3) )x 4

Concerns/at the frontier:

1)  should limit to medical context only -- more statistical evidence and requires doctor (cheapest cost avoider) to bear consequences of negligence

    - what if DF destroyed lottery tickets/stock certificates? -- courts are currently using pain and suffering/emotional damages, but would lost chance be effective?

- **Survival**: should lost chance apply to people who didn't die?

  a.  If people were exposed to risk that deprived them of a 30% chance of survival (from 40% to 10%), should DF pay for (1) 30% of the value of lives of those who died or (2) 30% of value of lives of all exposed to the risk?

      - \(2\) would provide full deterrence & gets rid of issue of moral luck, risk creation is just as morally reprehensible regardless of result

      - \(1\) would result in optimal deterrence (because (2) would be too much deterrence, might affect activity level of socially beneficial conduct -- surgeons)).

**MARKET SHARE LIABILITY**

Questions (consider: when to use market share vs. joint & several liability)

1)  Signature disease?

2)  Identical product?

3)  Which market? (e.g. national data available -- helps accuracy/fairness/recovery)

4)  Can PL prove specific DF's liability? (if yes, traditional tort law can apply)

5)  Can DF exculpate?

*Hymowitz v. Eli Lily & Co.* (372)

- [Facts]{.underline}: DES case; PLs claim injury in utero; products chemically identical from multiple manufacturers

  - Uses *Summers v. Tice*: alternative liability doctrine; both hunters are held liable and burden is on defendants to exempt themselves

- [Holding]{.underline}: market share theory

  - Several only; should not be inflated to cover absent manufacturers

  - Burden of proof is on DF to leave group

- Cannot determine cause-in-fact (traditionally necessary)

- Signature disease -- we know one of the manufacturers was liable

**At the frontier**

1)  What if 10\~20% of the population had a DNA predisposition to disease (non-tortious MSC)? Then there would be no signature disease.

    - A solution: Cut out these people and then you will have a signature disease for the remaining people, so market-share liability can be applied.

2)  Currently, **government takes money based on market share & distributes it to the victims as an alternative to tort law.**

    - **Pros**: Efficient way to have the same deterrence effect -- they lose the same amount of money

    - **Cons**: Doesn't do sense of justice between wrong-doer & victim bc the process is so indirect

**\**

**SCOPE OF LIABILITY / PROXIMATE CAUSE**

**PROXIMATE CAUSE**

Even after it is determined that DF is under a duty to exercise reasonable care, and even after PL has proved the other elements of his case, liability isn't imposed unless DF's action also were the "proximate cause" (legal cause) of PL's injury. (Note: very mushy concept---concepts blend together and it's a fact-specific inquiry)

*Berry v. Borough of Sugar North*

I.  PL speeding in car; hit by falling tree 🡪 speeding was not a proximate cause because it was pure chance

**Traditional Tests**

- **Foreseeability:** DF's negligence is proximate cause of PL's harm if causing that harm was a foreseeable result of DF's conduct.

- **Indirect vs. Direct cause:** Is there an intervening/superseding cause?

**Unforeseeability** (note: these are blurry categories!)

Traditional case law distinguishes:

- Unforeseeable plaintiffs (e.g. *Palsgraf*) -- yes; bars recovery

- Unforeseeable extent of harm ('thin-skull' plaintiffs) -- no; does not bar recovery, you take your victim as they come

- Unforeseeable type of harm (usually considered case-by-case) -- yes, bars recovery (as per *Wagon Mound*, overruling *Polemis*)

- Unforeseeable manner of harm -- no; does not bar recovery

**Modern "scope of liability"** -- courts are somewhere in between unforeseeability and the HWR test 🡪 argue whichever to help your case; e.g. how you could win under both tests

**Harm within the (foreseeable increase in) risk test**: DF's negligence is not a proximate cause if the harm or risk of harm is not the same risk that made DF negligent (a further limitation on scope of liability)

- Was the DF negligent under the negligence standard?

- Was harm to the PL a foreseeable result?

- **Restatement 3^rd^ § 29**: liability is limited to harms resulting from the risk that made the conduct tortious

- **§ 36**: If negligent conduct is **only a trivial contribution** to the cause of harm, it is not within the scope of liability (e.g. Harriet example--- § 36 is designed to exclude Harriet)

- e.g. kid dropping gun is foreseeable but not the harm within the risk 🡪 no liability

*Polemis* (UK 1921)

- [Facts]{.underline}: Accident of negligently falling plank sparks and sets off explosion of ship

- [Holding]{.underline}: yes liability -- negligent tortfeasor will be held liable for unforeseeable damages/type of harm

*Wagon Mound* (UK 1961)

- [Facts]{.underline}: ship leaking oil into harbour; oil catches fire and dock burns down

- [Holding]{.underline}: no liability for unforeseeable consequences -- based on reasonable foreseeability

*Palsgraf v. LIRR* (Ct. App. NY 1928)

- [Facts]{.underline}: woman hit by scale after train conductor pushes man holding fireworks onto train

- [Holding]{.underline}: no liability

  - (Cardozo): Palsgraf is outside the "orbit of danger" / reasonably perceived risk; negligent act wasn't connected to Palsgraf -- nature of negligence should be relational between PL & DF (no 'liability in the air'); liability limit is at duty

  - (Andrews, dissent): negligent action creates responsibility for the harm created by it, even outside reasonably foreseeable danger zone; use intuitive cutoff of space and time (note: this is now the rule)

*Davis v. United States* (2012)

- [Facts]{.underline}: FBI protects gang members, who kill PL's family member; circuit ct. affirms cause-in-fact and says government is liable

- [Holding]{.underline}: foreseeable that the men would murder someone; no need to prove exactly these victims

- [Principles]{.underline}: could argue 'but for' causation; but we don't know counterfactual; FBI increased a foreseeable risk

**Calabresi's Cheapest Cost Avoider + Causation**

- Cause-in-fact: need for causation because there is no deterrence unless you stick the proper defendant with the cost

- Proximate cause: the party with info knows the risks/harms and knows the possible precautions, so cost should go to them

**Policy for/against proximate cause**

- **Pros:** Normatively don't want negligent persons to have to pay for distant harms, Deterrence is not served bc unforeseen harms can't be deterred, impossible to administer a system where any cause is allowed to become a source of liability (we need to break the chain at some point)

- **Cons:** Important aim of tort law is compensation (negligent + injury should lead to compensation), moral luck -- there is no difference between tortfeasors who do same thing but only one results in harm.

**INTENTIONAL TORTS**

Trespass vs. nuisance: exclusive possession vs. use & enjoyment of land

Ask: who gets to decide whether the activity continues? Who gets to decide the price of the activity?

**TRESPASS**

Protecting interests in exclusive possession & right to exclude

1)  History of strict liability

2)  2^nd^ Restatement: unintended intrusions only create liability if actual harm occurs

*Martin v. Reynolds Metal Co.*

- [Facts]{.underline}: PL claiming DF's aluminum plant polluted farm and killed animals

  - DF argues no liability if particles too small

- [Holding]{.underline}: Invisible particles count (change from past regime) -- about direct intrusion rather than size

**Unintentional trespass**: if DF lacks reasonable awareness (no intention to enter land, let alone trespass) 🡪 apply **negligence** standard (there **must be harm** to be liable)

**DEFENSES TO TRESPASS**

**Necessity exception**: use reasonableness standard

- **Private necessity**: privilege to use/destroy another's property to preserve person/property of greater value

  - **Conditional defense**: user must pay back damages regardless of reasonableness

  - *Ploof v. Putnam*: PL uses DF's dock in storm; DF cuts PL away & PL sues for injury

    - Ct. holds for PL with privilege of necessity

  - *Vincent v*. *Lake Erie Transportation Co.* (958): Storm keeps DF's ship at PL's dock, causing damage

    - Ct. holds for DF---dock was common use and extent of storm was unanticipated

    - DF required to pay PL for cost of damage

- **Public necessity**: when interference with PL's property is reasonable because of significant risk to large group of people (e.g. 1 house destroyed to stop fire)

  - **Absolute defense**: PL cannot recover for any damages---too hard to assign responsibility from the general pulic

Note: invader must always pay for trespassing (strict liability); owner gets off free if erring on the right side of BPL (negligence) 🡪 preference in tort law for property right, unlike normal tort standard of negligence

**CONVERSION** (note: strict liability applies)

Requirements

I.  Ownership

    a.  Requirements to determine property right:

        i.  Interest capable of precise definition

        ii. Capable of exclusive possession

        iii. Putative owner has established claim to exclusivity

II. Wrongful disposition

III. Damages

*Kremen v. Cohen*

1)  [Facts]{.underline}: sex.com case

    a.  D. Ct. said no recovery because there was no "merging" of intangible right into a document (according to the Restatement)

2)  [Holding]{.underline}: PL had intangible property right that was eligible to count as conversion

    a.  Rejection of need to have intangible property "merged"

**TRESPASS TO CHATTELS**

*Intel v. Hamdi*

- [Facts]{.underline}: Intel sues for trespass to chattels for Hamdi sending emails to current employees

- [Holding]{.underline}: No injunction/recovery because no harm was done -- **chattel must be physical**

  - No interference = no damages, not even nominal

  - Personal property vs real property (land):

    - Need to show injury

    - Need to define the "thing"

Policy: if there is no effect on ownership from other people using it, should it be regulated at all?

A.  Too much regulation -- causing decrease in communication/good behaviour?

B.  If modern trespass requires "hurt feelings" at least, fear of unnecessary regulation less founded

C.  Legislation can step in also (see spam laws)

**COASE THEOREM**

If parties can bargain, then law isn't needed; "contracting around the law"

- Cheapest way to avoid the most harm

- cf. class action settlement class -- parties have already bargained

- Liability should go to party with the most info/best equipped to get optimal bargaining; courts are bad at determining the prices for things

- Role of law: more important when bargaining is less likely; law must determine distribution (should aim for CCA---either party with most information or best bargainer/briber)

Pros

- Good for pre-existing relationships, few parties, easily monetized harm/costs, sophisticated parties that know how to negotiate

- Good for neighbours/parties that have an interest in a sustainable relationship

Cons

- Requires/assumes low/no transaction costs (not always the case); some situations have no time for bargaining

- Fairness + distributional consequences \-- moral blame and compensation

**NUISANCE**

Protecting usage and enjoyment of property

**Private nuisance** occurs if the invasion is

- Intentional and unreasonable, OR

  - Unreasonable if (harm \> utility of conduct) or harm is serious & financial burden makes conduct unfeasible (682)

- Unintentional and arising out of negligence/reckless conduct/abnormally dangerous activities

*Boomer v. Atlantic Cement Co.* (Ct. App. NY 1970)

3)  [Facts]{.underline}: PL claims injury from DF's cement plant; NY rule says activity should be stopped even if there are disparate economic consequences

4)  [Holding]{.underline}: injunction unless DF pays permanent damage

    a.  total damage is small compared to value of DF's plant---wants to avoid closing plant

5)  Policy: do permanent damages encourage licensing a continuing wrong? (disincentivizing better technology for decreasing pollution?

*Spurr v. Webb* (695)

- [Facts]{.underline}: DF had cattle feed lot; PL residential development that complained of flies and odor

- [Holding]{.underline}: PL has to pay DF to move -- **"coming to the nuisance"**

+-----------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Choosing which box:

- **Cheapest cost avoider considerations**

  - Good bargaining possibility -- favours property rules (box 1/2) because parties can reach better solution from bargaining

  - Unlikely bargaining -- favour liability rules (box 3/4)

  - Bargaining not always possible

- Liability rules may be ineffective if damages don't exist/can't be measured

- Administrative cost---requiring system to measure damages

- Is it always good to let PLs set price to bargain around box 2 injunctions? Economic holdups/hard bargains?

**REMEDIES FOR NUISANCE**

Types of Remedies:

- **Injunctions (Property Rule)** -- D must stop its activities and the nuisance.

- **Damages (Liability Rule)** -- D pays P for all past and future losses but could be permitted to continue the activity

- **Damage + Injunction** -- D may have to pay the plaintiff for damages for all past losses and also be enjoined from continuing the nuisance thereafter

Courts balance the equities at the liability stage to determine whether DF has engaged in nuisance. But also at the remedial stage in determining appropriate remedies:

- Whether to enjoin (plus past harm perhaps) the DF, OR

- Permit the activity and hold DF liable for damages for past and future harm

**Factors for deciding nuisance remedies**

- Parties' respective faults

- Hardship to the parties in respect to continuance or discontinuance of the nuisance

- Value of the activity that constitutes the nuisance to the surrounding community

  - Usually in tort law, injury has already happened & ceased, so remedy of liabilities is appropriate, but for nuisance, the injury is often continuing so injunction is also available

**REMEDIES**

**Types of remedies**

I.  **Damages** (law)

    a.  **Compensatory**

        i.  Loss to property, diminished profits, "out of pocket" losses

        ii. "general" damages for **pain and suffering** -- must prove by preponderance of evidence that there is suffering; not available for property damage

        iii. Policy: also allows PL extra money that aren't going to attorney's fees; uncertainty for DF

        iv. Courts can lower/raise award (remittitur etc.); some states have absolute limits

        v.  **Pure emotional loss** (no negligence-related physical injyr) -- limited;

    b.  **Punitive**

    c.  Nominal

II. **Injunction** (equity)

    a.  Preliminary & permanent

    b.  4-factor test for injunction:

        - Irreparable harm

        - Remedies at law (damages) are inadequate

        - Balance interests of PL and DF

        - Public interest

**Purpose of remedies**

1)  **Compensation**: achieving justice or providing civil recourse by compensating the PL for losses resulting from DF's tortious act

2)  **Deterrence**: promoting deterrence via threatening DFs with liability with the costs resulting from their tortious acts

3)  **Redistribution & Accountability**: recognizing the social and individual significance of PL's loss and confirming the weight of DF's responsibility for that loss, redistributing money to balance out the scales

4)  PLs receive **single recovery**: compensation for both past and future harm

    a.  Pros: case doesn't go on forever; no incentive to stay suffering for more recovery; DFs end liability and avoids multiple judicial proceedings

    b.  Cons: hard to estimate future costs; PL must save that money for long term; future value is discounted in award; no recovery for likely future harm except medical monitoring

*Ebay v. Mercexchange LLC (INJUNCTION)*

I.  [Facts]{.underline}: PL requested injunction for infringement on business method/patent

    a.  D.Ct. denies injunction, allows damages because Mercexchange is willing to license and isn't a competing website so no need to stop the activity

    b.  Patent infringement usually warrants injunction

II. [Holding]{.underline}: 4-factor test is not a bright line rule

    a.  Justices disagree on whether injunctions should always be used

    b.  Policy: forced licensing (DFs who infringe and just pay the damages) -- could be unfair for non-practising patents or people who don't have resources to bring it to market

        i.  Injunction allows people to bargain it out themselves

III. **Four factor test for permanent injunction**

<!-- -->

1)  Irreparable harm

2)  Remedies at law (damages) are inadequate

3)  Balance interests of PL and DF

4)  Public interest

*532 Madison Ave Gourmet Foods v. Finlandia Center (ECONOMIC LOSS)*

- [Facts]{.underline}: construction causes wall to fall, blocks off road and shops; PL sues for lost income because his deli is closed; trial court says no duty of care for only economic loss with no injury

  - *Goldberg Weprin & Ustin v. Tishman* -- also lost income after construction accident

  - *Strauss v*. *Belle Realty Co.* -- PL slips in dark stairwell in outage; ct. holds no duty for power company because no contractual relationship (draws line at direct relationship)

- [Holding]{.underline}: "special injury" for general inconvenience

*Dunlop Tire v. FMC Corp / Beck v. FMC Corp (ECONOMIC LOSS)*

- [Facts]{.underline}: FMC explodes, debris hits Dunlop building and knocks out power; PLs sue for lost wages & lost profits

- [Holding]{.underline}: Dunlop gets damages but not Beck (lost wages) -- pure economic loss

  - **If economic loss is attached to property damage, could recover**

**PURE ECONOMIC LOSS**

Harms not directly damage to property or personal injury -- common law says no recovery for pure economic or emotional loss (because liability is limited by no duty)

- PROS:

  - Prevents high opportunity for fraud; floodgates of litigation

  - Remedying things beyond actual harm is beyond what we want to put tort law energy into

  - Cuts off liability for the DF at a certain manageable point; DF doesn't face ridiculous damages

  - Deterrence still exists for injuries

  - Third party economic losses are widely distributed/spread out enough

- CONS:

  - Means tort law doesn't take into account third parties

  - cf. construction cases; harms like lost income cannot get recovery

  - deterrence is undervalued

**Possible limiting factors for economic loss**

Courts have been arbitrarily drawing lines here and there based on public policy

- existence of contract

- type of tort (negligence, gross negligence, recklessness)

- limited damages amount (e.g. limited fund class action)

- type of harm 🡪 proximate cause question

- tenants of a building (*Strauss v. Belle*)

- size of economic loss

- geographic lines (e.g. police line, street lines -- cf. *532 Madison*)

- foreseeability

**PURE EMOTIONAL LOSS**

Generally no claim/liability/damages for emotional distress, with a few specific exceptions:

- negligently mishandling of corpse of loved one

- negligently misinformation of death of loved one

- negligently conveying important information (e.g. physician misinforming PL or spouse informing PL of STD)

- where DF is in position of power/authority over PL to have a duty (e.g. hospital allowing baby to be kidnapped)

**PUNITIVE DAMAGES**

Should punitive damages be based on harm? Why/how/who's harm?

Aims: deter and punish

- **optimal deterrence**: to deter from doing things badly (based on harms to PL)---basically allows harms to occur because the costs of precaution are too high

  - can fail if not all PLs sue (e.g. only 10% of DFs get caught; or intangible harms that aren't captured by compensatory damages

- **absolute deterrence**: stop activity completely (based on gains to DF)---basically want to take away all pros of activity to DF so you stop doing it

Consider: what kind of deterrence do you want -- and how does the punitive damages relate?

*State Farm v. Campbell* (2003)

- [Facts]{.underline}: State Farm convincing accident-causer to refuse settlements to save money

  - Jury awarded huge punitive damages because nation-wide profiting was bad for all insurance holders

- [Holding]{.underline}: Single-digit multiplier constitutionally appropriate

*Phillip Morris v. Williams* (2007)

- [Facts]{.underline}: false advertising for health risks of cigarettes; court denies DF's request for jury instruction saying no punitive damages for non-PLs; jury grants \~100x punitive damages

- [Holding]{.underline}: absent plaintiffs cannot be taken into direct account for punitive damages, but can be taken account in determining reprehensibility of action

  - Policy

    - taking into account absent PLs could allow double recovery if they sue later

    - punitive damages mostly went to OR state -- irrelevant for DF, but less money for PLs who already have to pay lawyers

*Exxon v. Baker* (2008)

- [Facts]{.underline}: Exxon spill; case against the alcoholic captain left deck during turn and caused oil spill; PLs include fisherman, native Alaskan who didn't settle

  - Mandatory punitive class

  - Main question: is \$2.5M in punitive damages too big under maritime law?

- [Holding]{.underline}: 1:1 ratio for compensatory : punitive damages for maritime law; could be larger for recklessness

*Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co (Pinto Case)*

- [Facts]{.underline}: Pinto hit by another car, explodes; jury awards \$2.5M compensatory & \$125M punitive; court reduces it to \$3.5M

- Policy issue: are trade-off design decisions encouraged by risk-benefit standard?

*WR Grace & Co. v. Waters*

- [Facts]{.underline}: asbestos mass tort action; court refused to bar multiple awards of punitive damages

- [Holding]{.underline}: bifurcated proceedings -- part 1 for evidence/liability/compensatory damages; part 2 for punitive damages, accounting for prior awards

**Limiting factors for punitive damages**

- Hard caps (in state/federal statutes)

  - Pros: easier administration

  - Cons: cannot adjust for variance in actual damage (can be good for DF) -- legislatures can adjust for inflation whenever etc. but judges are bound by precedents

- Ratio/multipliers

  - *State Farm*: single digit multipliers for due process

  - *Exxon*: 1:1 for federal maritime cases (fed common law)

  - *BMW*: three factors to evaluate

  - cf. criminal law---judges get tables

  - Pros: easier application with some adjustability

  - Cons: under-punishment/under-deterrence (can be good for DF); state courts have never set a hard number so maybe too much taking legislature's job

- Verbal/Jury instructions (exists in MD)

  - *Exxon* -- mushy, but courts use them anyways all the time

  - *Phillips Morris* -- requested jury instructions say no non-PL harm in PD

**Constitutional Limits on Punitive Damages**

- *BMW v. Gore*: 3 guideposts

1)  Reprehensibility of DF's conduct -- e.g. pure economic harm vs. health and safety; cf. Phillip Morris

2)  Disparity between compensatory and punitive awards -- State Farm: single digit ratios are better for due process

3)  Similarity to other civil and criminal penalties

    a.  Using legislature as a guideline: legislation is made ex ante (takes court-made PD into account)---function is different

- *State Farm*: single digit ratio

- *Exxon*: 1:1 ratio for federal maritime cases

- *Philip Morris*: cannot directly use harm to missing plaintiffs---reprehensibility calculus only

*BMW v. Gore* -- selling painted-over car as brand new; PL sued for fraud; one jury gave \$4, and another gave \$0 (inconsistency of punitive damages)

**Why constrain punitive damages?**

I.  Fairness/outrageous amounts

II. Bankrupting DFs

III. Consistency/predictability -- unfair to DFs who don't know cost of actions

IV. Harder to settle cases because unpredictable damages

V.  Legitimacy of court (?)

**Policy considerations for punitive damages**

- Deterrence -- makes behaviour costly for DFs/forces changes

- Corrective justice -- corrects for victims who don't come forward

- Legitimacy and consistency -- PD can be unpredictable and due process is questionable; however, unpredictability also helps deterrence/avoids cost of business calculation

- Role of court -- accounting for non-parties, setting multipliers, etc.; what should be within courts' role?

- Efficiency -- don't want to overpunish/overdeter DF

- Fairness -- due process concerns, overcompensation to PL, overpunish in compensatory because juries account for it subconsciously; funding for state = incentive for more PD

- Pinto paradox -- DFs calculate value of life vs cost of increased precautions; fact-finders are biased against valuing life economically

- **Repeating punitive damages**

  - Overlapping punishment to DF

  - Incentive for other PLs to sue

    - Some states only allow large PD recovery for first PL -- encourages other PLs to come forward in exchange for certainty of compensatory damages, but they don't need PD incentive anymore

    - Over-deterrence is unproductive and unfair to DF

    - However, unfair that other PLs don't get the large award (favours PL with resources to sue first)

  - Depends on whether DF hurt someone personally or exposed society to poor behaviour

- Class action -- could be used instead of repeated punishment; establishes reprehensibility in one shot and has one payment split between PLs

  - Should punitive damages be allowed in class actions?

    - Yes: there are other PLs outside of class that were affected but aren't suing

    - No: PLs are all represented so compensatory is enough deterrence

  - Exxon -- got a mandatory PD class action (solution?)

**STATUTORY DAMAGES**

Damages whose amount/range is set by law, usually without regard to actual suffered harm

- For PL: simplifies proof, awards damages without requiring evidence of actual harm

- For DF: multiplier of liability, especially when claims/parties are aggregated; can be unpredictable because of wide statutory ranges

Policy

A.  Statutes are for crime-like activities, feel like punishment (although not official); however, DFs don't get criminal-like protections

B.  Give fair notice to DFs; predictable deterrence

C.  Makes litigation more attractive when damages are hard to calculate

D.  Is there Congressional intent for the wide ranges? Tailor-able to activity or any numbers for any act?

*Sony v. Tenebaum* (2013)

1)  [Facts]{.underline}: DF downloaded and distributed songs; court awards statutory damages from Copyright Act (big range); jury is insistent on large award still within range

2)  [Holding]{.underline}: award doesn't "shock the conscience"; affirm damages

    a.  Court says *BMW* factors don't make sense in statutory context/don't apply here (ratio N/A because statutory damages should make it easier for PL on evidence; can't compare with similar cases by comparing statute to itself) (should it? Maybe it can)

    b.  Court goes with *Williams* test which says that statutory damages follows due process as long as not severe and oppressive to be obviously unreasonable (highly deferential)

**MASS TORTS & CLASS ACTIONS**

Advantages of class actions

- **PL**: small claims can be aggregated, pool (legal) resources, improve leverage for settlement, establish pattern

- **DF**: world peace, preclusion effects, save resources

- **Societal**: judicial efficiency, consistent results, substitute for PD, distributive benefits

**Rule 23(a):** 4 conditions that must be met for all class actions (in order to satisfy DP)

4)  **Numerosity**: joinder of members impractical

5)  **Commonality**: "questions of law or fact common to the class"

6)  **Typicality**: claims/defenses of representative are typical to the class

7)  **Adequacy**: representatives will fairly and adequately represent interests of members

**Rule 23(b)**: types of class actions -- pick 1

- **(a) Inconsistency**

**(b) "limited fund"** (e.g. if one PL would soak up available funds)

- **injunctive class**

- **predominance & superiority** (damages class) -- common question has to predominate and class action method has to be superior to alternative

special protections:

opt-out (chance to bring your own case)

mandatory notice (to people who may be part of the class)

*Walmart Stores v. Dukes*

- [Facts]{.underline}: Title VII action for discrimination against women across different individual stores; tries to certify 23(b)(2) "commonality" and 23(b)(2) injunctive class

- Scalia (majority) -- common question not good enough; there must be "same injury' & "common answer," from resolution of lawsuit; not just pleading standard

- Ginsburg (dissent) -- that makes 23(a)(2) into 23(b)(3)'s "predominance" requirement, which shouldn't need to apply to (b)(1)/(2) classes

- [Holding]{.underline}: class did not meet 23(a)(2) (common question of law or fact)

  - Claim for back pay improperly certified because monetary claims can't be certified under 23(b)(2); must be single remedy for each class member

*Parko v. Shell* (2014)

- [Facts]{.underline}: property owners vs. Shell & current owner ConocoPhillips, operating oil refinery near a village; claiming benzene leaks into groundwater; claiming lost property value

  - DFs argue some class members weren't injured so fail numerosity

- [Holding]{.underline}: too much work to prove injury before certifying; predominance requirement is quality \> quantity; not just pleading evidence

  - However, PLs fail predominance evidence because no evidence water was drunk etc.; damages could be done individually

  - Comparing *Metcoil* case: had same source of pollution in one storage container and there was proof it entered water supply; therefore meets predominance and commonality

- Principle: courts are making it harder to bring class actions

Rule 23(c)(4): "issue class" -- certifying only the issues that are the same; can de-class after determining common issue and decide others separately

Rule 23(c)(5): can divide class into subclasses

Rule 23(e): Settlement class -- certifying and settlement at the same time

- "contracting around the law"

- Pros: saves time and cost of litigations.

- Cons:

  - Absent PLs interest are less visible/represented (settlement binds them too)

  - Mismatched bargaining power may lead to unfair settlements

  - May reflect inaccurate facts if there was no adversarial process

  - Collusion between PL and DF attorneys to make money

- is it helping the people class actions were meant to help?

- Court needs to approve terms of the settlement; need to give notice out; hearing and fair & reasonable determination

- Note you still need to satisfy 23(a) and (b)

*BP*

- [Timeline]{.underline}:

  - After spill, BP establishes GCCF Fund (\$20B compensation fund)

    - Kenneth Feinberg gives out \~\$6B

  - MDL is consolidated in New Orleans under Judge Barbier

  - Class settlement is proposed

    - Replaces GCCF Fund; uses formula proposed and accepted for class settlement and starts distributing money (with no cap); no need to prove direct causation between spill and injury (only U/V shape)

- BP later opposes its own agreement (probably because no cap and no judgement of causation) -- challenges on 23(a)(2) commonality, 23(a)(4) adequacy, and 23(b)(3) predominance

  - Also challenges causation requirement -- illegitimate claims cheapens process; chilling effects on future class actions

- [Holdings]{.underline}:

  - Court holds that (a)(2) single act of DF counts, so the oil spill satisfies it; that the issue is common and predominant (b)(3) and non-injured members are not an issue for (a)(4)

  - Different/no damages between class members is not an obstacle to certify a class under a common issue

  - Claimants are testifying by signing the form that they were injured by spill; good enough under penalty of perjury

- [Policy]{.underline}:

  - Why might we want a no-cap no causation plan? 🡪 people who are in worst position to claim can also be those hurt the most; PLs get remedies faster

  - BP plan vs. punitive damages vs. original compensation fund? What about a fund created by punitive damages?

**Multi-district litigation** (MDL)

*temporary* transfer of single actions pending in different districts which involve one or more common questions of law or fact to a single district for consolidated trial under single judge.

- Differs from class actions: (1) No absent class members (unless one of the consolidated action is a class action), (2) Does not bind, and (3) Cannot opt-out

  - Does not provide a remedy

- When MDL becomes untenable/inefficient, sample PLs are selected for trial that represent range of harms

  - Most parties settle after consolidation ends; if no settlement, not precluded from litigation

- Pros: facilitates settlement; efficiency

- Cons: can't do the whole thing in an MDL; no global peace like class actions

- *BP* went from MDL to class action

**Gulf Coast Claims Facility (GCCF) & 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund (VCF) -- Pros & Cons**

- Questions to ask: *how they are created, who creates them and how are they managed?*

- **9/11 VCF**: Congress set it up as part of package through legislation (contracting out of tort law because it restricts litigation, but legislature *adds legitimacy*)

  - Allows PLs to recover for mass tort with no culpable DF

  - No cap on funds

  - Provides mechanism to appeal individual claims, due process values

  - Easier to administer: centralized admission, but difficult to decide who could receive damages on behalf of decedents

  - How much of tort principles do we want to use?

    - Pain and suffering: Did not resort to tort law & provided equal amount to everyone

    - Lost future earnings calculation -- used tort principles.

    - Think BP's no causation -- there they waived tort principles.

- **GCCF**: BP set it up themselves & appointed Feinburg (same person as 9/11), but failed due to legitimacy issues -- he was paid by BP.
