# I. Negligence

[Negligence]{.underline}

Failure to exercise reasonable care. Elements:

- Duty: People usually have a duty to exercise reasonable care. Proximate cause and economic and emotional harms bring in whether there was a duty

- Breach of duty: Π may try to prove an untaken precaution

- Causation: Cause-in-fact. Proximate cause

- Injury

[Care/activity levels]{.underline}: The court regulates care and activity levels by assigning liability for some conduct.

Backward-looking: Who should pay? What is fair? What precautions should have been taken?

Forward-looking: Who and how should we incentivize/deter?

[Cases]{.underline}

- *Hammontree v. Jenner*: No fault by Π or ∆. Π wants to extend strict liability to car drivers. Court thinks it would be too difficult to assign liability to car drivers and that the legislature can make a comprehensive plan. Perhaps the burden to Jenner of not driving ever is too high.

### Coase theorem

Most narrow application: Property cases such as nuisance of a factory polluting around the school. The concern is putting in the scrubber. Maybe there's an even cheaper precaution such as a fan. If the factory bears liability, the factory will pay the school to implement the precaution. If the school bears liability, the school will put in the fan.

When will it be useful?: No transaction costs. Don't care who pays. Know who the CCP is.

What is the role of the law/liability?: Find best bargainer and put liability on him. Take into account who should pay based on fairness. Deal with diffuse victims and difficulty bargaining.

How could it be useful more broadly?

Why is the Coase theorem important to people?

## 1. Standard of care: defining liability

### A. Fault

In the nineteenth century courts moved away from trespass/case distinctions (SL/N) toward a negligence-focused regime, in which ∆ has to be at fault to be liable. Potentially a reflection of individualism and industrialization. Potentially a subsidy for infant industry, along with contributory negligence as a complete bar to recovery.

[Cases]{.underline}

- *Brown v. Kendall*: Establishes fault principle. Π has burden of proof to show that ∆ failed to take ordinary care. Π may have helped cause his own injury by getting too close to the dogfight. ∆ was not at fault because he took ordinary care in breaking up the fight.

### B. Standard

Juries decide what reasonable care ought to be. Problematic because juries are not experts in many fields, and because there may not be a general, uniform norm for a given activity.

There are multiple ways to consider unreasonable conduct, including carelessness, foolishness, and selfishness. Applying a perfect compliance requirement, that the ∆ must comply with the standard all the time, helps avoid subjective inquiries into ∆'s character and past behavior.

### BPL 

Test to determine reasonable care. Foreseeability by objective, reasonable person seems to overlay the formula, which asks people to consider externalities and weigh costs objectively, almost altruistically. Companies probably do this when considering whether to incur liability or take particular precautions.

- Burden of adequate precautions

- Marginal probability of harm based on (non)existence of precaution

- Size of loss / gravity of resultant harm

Considerations:

- No distinction between costs to actor and costs to injured party. More concerned with minimizing waste of resources and deterrence than with compensation

- Not all things can be measured. Lack of statistics. Hard to determine costs of precautions

- Not all things should be measured? Juries may find valuation of life heinous

- Not all things can be compared. "Incommensurables"

- Doesn't address carelessness, only considered decisions

- Doesn't award good-faith efforts and incorrect conclusions

[Cases]{.underline}

- *Adams v. Bullock*: "Reasonable care." Freak accident; nothing similar had happened before. ∆ doesn't have duty to incur unreasonable cost of prevention.

- *U.S. v. Carroll Towing*: Court uses BPL formula. Can frame precaution in a certain way to sound reasonable, e.g., dependent on weather, during normal working hours.

### C. Reasonable Person

This is an objective standard that doesn't consider ∆'s good-faith efforts but rather what a reasonably prudent person should do to prevent foreseeable risk of harm. The objective standard essentially says fault is irrelevant.

Children: Children under 4 cannot be liable because they are unable to be properly incentivized/deterred; cannot satisfy debts; and other people should recognize children's lower care levels. Children over 4 have a semi-objective standard based on children of similar age, intelligence, and capability. But children engaging in dangerous adult activities are held to an adult objective standard because other people cannot know that children are participating in the activity; many children are now insured under their parents for adult activities; and there is no reason to incentivize children engaging in adult activities.

Infirm: Usually just a carve-out for the physically infirm because mental infirmities are more difficult to prove and not visible to other people who might be able to heighten their care. Jury is instructed to use a semi-objective standard based on the infirm person's limitations and whether he should have taken additional or different precautions.

[Objective standard and the aims of tort law]{.underline}

- Efficiency: Uses jury's knowledge and experience rather than ∆'s capabilities, so makes factfinding more feasible; aids cost and ease of adjudicating; and discourages fraud and deception. But sometimes must inquire into ∆'s state of mind.

- Incentives/Deterrence: People are incentivized to take utmost care to comply with the objective standard rather than hope for a lower subjective standard in court (increase care level). People who cannot comply with the standard are deterred from engaging in the activity (decrease activity level). But people must be aware of the standard and that they fall below in order to be properly incentivized/deterred.

- Fairness/Compensation: Treats everyone the same. People who cannot comply impose a risk on others and will be liable for resultant injuries. But it's unclear whether treating differently-situated people the same is fair.

[Subjective versus objective]{.underline}

Although we use an objective person standard, courts can frame details to change the circumstances surrounding the objective reasonable person rather than attributing details to the person.

[Cases]{.underline}

- *Daniels v. Clegg*: Court thinks age and sex should be considered. Because Π was a woman, ∆ should have taken extra care.

- *Little Rock & Ft. S. Ry. Co. v. Tankersly*: Court thinks woman should have taken more care because of her restrictive dress in alighting from the train.

### D. Judges and Juries: When to decide? Who decides?

In a case, questions on which "reasonable people could disagree" are submitted to the jury. Questions on which "reasonable people could not disagree" are answered by the judge as a matter of law.

The legal system decides before with rules (statutes, judicial precedent, agency regulation). This may mean that legal/administrative bodies abstracted from reality make decisions about reasonable/negligent behavior without knowledge, experience, or richness of real-world facts. The legislature, judges, and federal officials decide.

The legal system decides after with standards. Standards are applied to the real world. The judge or the jury may decide. The jury may not consider BPL calculus or even find it heinous.

### Rules versus standards

Modern trend toward standards, making rules more standard-like.

Rules:

- Clarity to actors

- Predictable outcomes; increased settlements; administrative efficiency

- Consistent rulings

- Decreased dangers inherent in discretion, e.g., prejudice

- Inadvertent versus deliberate negligence not considered

- Arbitrariness

- No consideration of facts

- Potential to game the system to comply with rules

Standards:

- Consideration of nuanced fact situations

- Just outcomes

- Flexibility over time

- No political danger or elitism because judges aren't ruling; greater perceived legitimacy

- Administrative inefficiency, high use of judicial resources

- Juries lack expertise

- Inconsistent rulings

[Cases]{.underline}

- *Baltimore & Ohio RR v. Goodman*: Court makes the rule that drivers crossing a railroad should get out of their cars and look to see if a train is coming. This rule will promote consistency and take the issue away from oscillating juries.

- *Pokora v. Wabash Railway*: Court moves away from *Goodman* rule because drivers don't normally get out of their cars and look, and it may actually be more dangerous. Judges aren't necessarily equipped to understand other people's everyday lives.

### E. Custom

Industries can make standards of care through custom. Industries know best, but they may be too self-interested when setting their own standard. Compliance is not usually dispositive.

### F. Negligence Per Se

A person may be liable by violating a statute intended to protect against the harm that occurred. But in some cases compliance may not be the best way to protect against the harm. A finding of negligence per se is a matter of law by the judge and the jury has no say. Some states do not have a negligence per se rule but allow the violation as evidence.

A defense to negligence per se may be that the injured party suffered harm that was outside the scope of risk that the statute aimed to protect against.

[Cases]{.underline}

- *Martin v. Herzog*: Legislature enacted statute to use headlights and laid down standard of care. Π is negligent by violating the statute.

- *Tedla*: If statute's purpose is to prevent harm, Π met purpose by noncompliance. Statute merely codified common law.

## 2. Causation: determining liability

1.  Cause in fact

    a.  but-for: proved by preponderance of evidence; MNC; alternative

    b.  sometimes proved through stats, elimination of other potential causes, statute

    c.  but-for fails, but still call cause-in-fact: MSC; market-share; industry

2.  Proximate cause

    a.  foreseeability

    b.  harm within risk

### A. Cause-in-fact: prerequisite for liability

Cause-in-fact asks the counterfactual. It requires a jury to consider what usually happens in situations like the one at hand.

### "But for" test

Finding "but for" cause is a cause-in-fact. There are many but-for causes; not all are negligent; if it is negligent, ∆ is eligible for liability.

"But for" counterfactual fails in some cases:

- So many possible causes of a disease that it is impossible to prove what the cause was.

- No established link between a specific cause and a specific result/injury.

- Multiple sufficient causes.

Sometimes jury can find causation based on evidence of negligence alone, if negligent conduct usually substantially increases probability of causing the type of harm that occurred to Π.

[Cases]{.underline}

- *Stubbs v. City of Rochester*: There are many possible causes of typhoid, some not even known yet. Fails "but for" counterfactual because it's impossible to rule out all other possible causes, but Π can show preponderance of evidence that ∆ was likely the cause. Types of evidence: exposure, changes over time, statistics (should have context i.e. baseline rates of typhoid).

- *Zuchowicz v. United States*: ∆ negligently instructed Π to overdose. The higher the dosage usually the greater the chance of negative effects. Overdose is the "but for" cause. No direct evidence of actual drug's dosage resulting in greater likelihood of negative effects. Experts ruled out other potential causes, which may have been important factor. Very little data about the causes of the very rare disease. Shifts burden of proof to ∆ by giving the issue to the jury; ∆ has more information and Π has none. Types of evidence: differential etiology, experts, exposure, no stats because the disease is very rare.

[Causation and the aims of tort law]{.underline}

∆'s negligence risks harm to people; ∆ is no less negligent just because conduct doesn't result in injury. Could hold ∆ liable for risks rather than injuries.

- Justice: ∆ is blameworthy because of conduct, not because of results. But maybe more blameworthy when harm occurs. Maybe harm is moral prerequisite to liability.

- Compensation: ∆ would compensate for risk rather than injury. Πs uninjured don't need money immediately but injured Πs do. Πs won't save money until they're injured.

- Administrative ease: Everyone at risk could sue. Degree of risk to each Π would be at issue. Many difficult lawsuits.

- Deterrence: Usually need causation to threaten liability to force ∆ to weigh anticipated liability with cost of precautions. Could possibly impose liability of average damages rather than those actually caused, which wouldn't require causation.[\]{.underline}

### B. Multiple Defendants: expanding liability

**Multiple sufficient causes**: when "but for" fails

Although "but-for" test fails, courts consider multiple sufficient causes to satisfy cause in fact.

Simultaneous negligent causes: Law chooses to over-impose liability by holding all negligent, sufficient causes liable.

Simultaneous causes with negligent and non-negligent actors: If negligent ∆ is held liable, ∆ has incentive to take precaution against harm that will sometimes occur because of simultaneous non-negligent cause; negligent cause must be simultaneous or earlier than non-negligent cause. If no liability, Π has less basis for objecting to no recovery.

Sequential negligent causes: First cause that does actual damage is liable; second is not. Moral luck fell in second cause's favor.

**Multiple necessary causes**: "but for" works

Even an actor 1% liable is a cause. Typically joint tortfeasors.

**Alternative liability**: proof question, cost-shifting

Usually involves "close connection" among ∆s. Usually for two ∆s because each is almost more probably than not the cause.

- *Summers v. Tice*: Two ∆s hunting together shot at Π, only one hit Π. Equally likely to have caused harm. Burden shifts to each ∆ to prove the he was not the cause on the basis that ∆s should have more information than Π.

### Industry-wide liability

Multiple manufacturers with identical products. Small number of manufactures. May incentivize manufacturers to work together to prevent injury or make products identifiable.

*Hall*: Burden shifts to ∆s to prove they didn't cause each harm.

**Market-share liability**: question of proof (don't need to prove individual causation); j+s payment scheme

Usually absolute market share, in which ∆ is responsible for actual market share percentage of damages. There is also relative market share, in which ∆ is responsible for proportion of damages based on proportion of market share. Courts consider the following factors:

- Signature diseases with only one cause

- Identical products

  - Unless it's not possible, e.g., blood transfusions

- Data on market share (which market?)

- Implicit permission or consent by Congress to bring suit

- **Public policy, usually with statutory overlay?**

- **No nontortious causes?**

[Policy: absolute market-share]{.underline}

- Deterrence: ∆ gets full internalization of harm and no more.

- Compensation: Π is undercompensated.

[Policy: relative market-share]{.underline}

- Deterrence: ∆ faces over-imposition of liability.

- Compensation: Π is fully compensated.

- **Administrability: potential multiplicity of suits**

[Cases]{.underline}:

- *Hymowitz v. Eli Lilly Co.*: Court rejects alternative liability because ∆s can't have better knowledge than Πs, given the long period before harm is known, chemically identical drugs, loss of manufacturers in market over time. Dissent thinks alternative liability still works and ∆s should exculpate by preponderance of evidence.

[The issue of statistical evidence]{.underline}

[Policy: proportional liability / probabilistic payout schemes]{.underline}

- Dispenses with individual causation---justice?

- Compensation: some Πs are undercompensated, some overcompensated.

- Deterrence: ∆ internalizes full amount of harm.

- Administrability: don't need evidence, expert witnesses, or full-blown trial

- Fairness: Does away with arbitrary difference between 49% and 51% chance of causation in preponderance of evidence scheme.

**Lost chance doctrine**: when "but-for" fails

Π has less than 50% chance of survival before ∆'s negligence. ∆ is liable for the amount of chance that ∆'s negligence reduced. The harm is the lost chance rather than death. Only medical malpractice cases.

- Healthcare professionals undertake duty to maximize health of patients.

- Reliable data on rates of survival.

[Policy: lost chance]{.underline}

- Shaping: healthcare professionals will take care with patients who will probably die.

- Deterrence: People who lose chance but survive may not sue, so ∆ may not internalize full harm.

*Matsuyama v. Birmbaum*:

**Joint and several liability**: damages apportionment, Π-focused

∆s are liable for full amount of damages; can result in overdeterrence. Π gets 100% no matter what. In play when some ∆s are insolvent or impossible to collect from. Paying ∆ can seek contribution from other ∆s. ∆s bear risk of insolvency. Some states now only impose joint and several on a ∆ whose negligence is 50+% of total ∆s' negligence.

- Joint tortfeasors: business partnership, one partner is negligent

- Independent tortfeasors cause indivisible harm: each is but-for negligent cause but impossible to divide proportion of harm

- Independent tortfeasors cause practically indivisible harm: each is but-for negligent cause for some amount of harm, but ∆s can't prove the amount

Applies to alternative, MSC, MNC? Joint and several versus several (Π doesn't get all damages). Apportioning based on fault percentage could happen with either.

[Several]{.underline}: Π may not get 100%; ∆ is properly deterred. Matters when a ∆ is insolvent. Can only be applies if you can apportion fault. [\]{.underline}

### C. Proximate cause: limiting liability

Courts use proximate cause or "scope of liability" as a standard to cut off liability after cause-in-fact is proved. Traditionally courts considered the foreseeability of the victim, type of harm, manner of harm, and extent of harm. Modern courts usually limit scope of liability for unforeseeable plaintiffs and types of harm, but not extent or manner.

- Foreseeability: was the harm a foreseeable result of ∆'s conduct? This is an imposition of expectations based on the reasonable person. The risk of harm is the principal basis for concluding that conduct is negligent.

  - Enabling/intervening cause: Negligence of first actor puts Π in position to be injured by a second actor. Courts may say this is foreseeable and find both actors negligent so Π can recover from at least one of them.

  - Superseding cause: New unforeseeable force breaks chain of causation and previous actors are not liable.

- Harm within the risk: is the risk of the harm that Π suffered one of the risks that makes ∆'s conduct negligent? Unforeseeable in the sense that it is not a risk that ∆ should consider in cost-benefit analysis. Sometimes ∆ is liable even if Π's harm is not a principal risk but is a secondary or relevant risk.

- Directness: Did ∆'s negligence cause Π's harm directly (close in time and space)? Mostly subsumed by foreseeability/harm within risk.

**Eggshell plaintiff rule**: This rule states that ∆ must take Π as he finds him with regard to the extent of harm. It optimally deters ∆ to force ∆ to consider that there is a range of infirmity. Doesn't apply when it makes more sense for Π to bear the costs of extent---contributory negligence, failure to mitigate.

[Cases]{.underline}

- *Palsgraf:* Majority characterizes as no duty to Π because she was unforeseeable, outside the "zone of danger." Does not reach the causation question. Dissent says ∆ has a duty to the public/world, and the issue is proximate cause, which is a jury question.

  - Reserved issue: "Imminently dangerous" objects may impose a higher duty, in which case the mechanism may not matter.

- *Wagon Mound:* Manner and mechanism of harm don't matter as long as some harm is foreseeable.

- *Polemis:* On *Wagon Mound* theory, as long as negligent loading can foreseeably cause harm to the boat, there should be liability, and even though the type of harm is not foreseeable, ∆ is liable for direct consequences of actions.

**\**

## 3. Defenses: limiting liability

∆ can raise affirmative defenses when Π brings a negligence claim. ∆ can try to prove that Π was negligent, and that conduct was cause in fact and proximate cause of Π's injury. ∆ can also try to prove that Π assumed the risk of harm, and that assumption was cause in fact and proximate cause of Π's injury.

### A. Contributory negligence

["Clean hands"]{.underline}: Π needs "clean hands"; if even 1% negligent, complete bar to recovery.

**Superseding cause**: Related to the concept of superseding cause\--Π is the superseding cause and so recovery for ∆'s conduct is barred.

**Avoidable consequences / mitigation**: This consideration reduced Π's damages. Is it different?

[Policy]{.underline}:

- Deterrence: Not fully justified by deterrence because ∆ is not sufficiently deterred from negligence, but Π is deterred, unclear what net outcome is.

- Administrability/institutional competence: Jury doesn't need to try to calculate negligence percentages. Discourages litigation.

- Compensation/fairness: Π may still deserve some compensation.

[Exceptions]{.underline}: Exceptions developed to soften hard edges:

- If ∆ violates safety statute, Π's contributory negligence is not complete bar to recovery

- Intentional torts and greater degree of blame, recklessness

- Last clear chance doctrine

- Helpless Πs: children, the infirm

- Juries used under-the-table comparative negligence

### B. Comparative negligence

Π's recovery is reduced in proportion to amount of Π's negligence.

[Pure]{.underline}: Π is never completely barred from recovery.

[Modified]{.underline}: Π who is as negligent or more negligent than ∆ is completely barred.

[Last clear chance, assumption of risk]{.underline}: Usually these doctrines have been subsumed since their purpose was to soften contributory negligence.

[Policy]{.underline}:

- Administrability/institutional competence: Difficult at times for jury to compare different types of negligent conduct and to keep distinct negligence and causation. Difficult to apportion fault if there are absent ∆s.

- Fairness: Every actor pays according to negligence. Π and ∆ are treated the same in pure scheme, and Π may bear as much risk for insolvent ∆ as other ∆s.

- Deterrence: Optimal deterrence in pure form. In modified form, unclear.

[Cases]{.underline}

- *Li v. Yellow Cab Co.*: Court decides to move to comparative negligence because juries already use it and it is more fair to Πs. Although contributory negligence was codified by state legislature, court changes because it was a common law doctrine originally.

  - Reserves issue of recklessness.

### C. Assumption of Risk

[Express]{.underline}: exculpatory clauses. Π waives right to compensation for any injury.

[Primary implied]{.underline}: There is an inherent risk. ∆ exercises reasonable care so is not negligent. Considerations:

- openness of the risk

- voluntariness of people's participation in the activity

- reasonableness of the risks posed by the activity in light of its benefits

- how much people in Π's position know

- how much self-protective care is possible

[Secondary implied]{.underline}: Π consciously takes negligent, unreasonable risk. A defense based on Π's conduct. This looks like contributory negligence.

[Reasonable risk-taking]{.underline}: Π's assumption of risk may be reasonable and thus not negligent, so there is no defense. But in some cases Π is held to have waived claim of action impliedly, e.g., firemen, injured Π going to hospital with drunk driver, which looks like strict liability for Π.

[Cases]{.underline}

- *Murphy v. Steeplehouse Amusement Co.*: Π assumed the risk of a fall, and this is the harm that occurred.

## 4. Duty: limiting liability

[Misfeasance]{.underline}: People usually have a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid causing harm to others. They are liable for misfeasance, i.e., negligent risk creation.

Sometimes the duty to exercise reasonable care entails to a duty to rescue/warn:

- If ∆ has negligently placed Π in a dangerous position, may have duty to warn or rescue

- If ∆ has undertaken to rescue Π, must do so with care

- If ∆ non-negligently creates danger characteristic of activity, may have duty to warn or rescue Π

[Policy: duty to rescue as part of reasonable care]{.underline}

- Initial misfeasance may create duty to correct the negligence when possible. Incentives.

- If ∆ undertakes rescue, ∆ deters others from attempting rescue. Incentives/deterrence.

- Non-negligence may mean that ∆ is not morally blameworthy, but if the danger is characteristic of the activity (e.g., car breaking down on the road), courts may find a principled reason to impose a duty to rescue or warn. This looks a little bit like strict liability.

### A. Affirmative Duty

[Nonfeasance]{.underline}: There is no general duty to rescue, or liability for nonfeasance, i.e., failure to act. No BPL cost-benefit analysis is required. But the distinction between acts and omissions can be blurred:

- "Actively" omit: fail to warn, deny help, avoid precaution

- Earlier act creates risk (negligence)

- Earlier act creates reliance (undertaking)

[Policy: no affirmative duty to rescue]{.underline}

- Individual liberty.

- Difficult to determine who would be liable if multiple people could have rescued but didn't.

- Deterrence: People won't rescue so that they avoid liability. But society only wants competent people to rescue.

[Special relationships]{.underline}: An affirmative duty to rescue arises with special relationships: common carriers, innkeepers, custodians traditionally. The ∆ has waived his right to mind his own business and must protect Π from dangers that ∆ didn't create, because Π relies on ∆. Courts are cautious in applying an affirmative duty. Famously, psychiatrists may owe a duty to potential victims of their patients. C.A. uses the somewhat tentative "reasonably identifiable victim" standard.

[Policy: duty arising from special relationships]{.underline}

- Shaping: Public relies on professionals to protect and serve the public. But predictions are unreliable and the practical benefit of warnings is uncertain.

- Rights: Professional and statutory standards of ethics and confidentiality aren't protected. People shouldn't have affirmative duties to warn.

[Property]{.underline}: There are some cases in which a proprietor or property owner may be liable for torts committed on the property. Courts consider the following:

- Pre-existing relationship of some sort between Π and ∆ proprietor, through contract or invitation, express or implied

- ∆ proprietor is on notice of the risk of harm to Π from past similar circumstances or torts

- ∆ strategically placed to take precautions

- primary wrongdoer is judgment-proof or has limited assets; ∆ is insured or has deep pockets

- Breach: sufficiently probable risk, sufficiently great potential harm, sufficiently small cost of reducing risk

[Cases]{.underline}

- *Tarasoff v. Regents of University of California*: Psychiatrist has special relationship with his patient, and therefore owes a duty to third parties who are "foreseeable victims" of the patient.

- *Harper v. Herman*: Court frames ∆'s "act" as omission of warning, which seems like nonfeasance for which ∆ would not be liable based on no affirmative duty to warn. Court finds that Π had no right to depend or rely on ∆ and should have investigated himself.

### B. No Duty

[Policy: no duty for public services]{.underline}

- Shaping: If public services face crushing liability, the public will go without essential services.

- Incentives: Companies are incentivized to contract with cities rather than people to avoid liability, and to join with other businesses to become too big to fail.

- Deterrence: Companies may not be deterred from negligent conduct if they have no liability. Having a bright-line rule of privity enables companies to anticipate how much liability they will have. But it's unclear how many suits would have been brought without privity.

[Cases]{.underline}

- *Strauss v. Belle Realty Co.*: Court refuses to impose liability on Con Ed because the liability might be crushing to an electricity provider, draws the line at privity.

- *The Moch case*:

### C. Special Contexts: Government liability

[Sovereign immunity]{.underline}: The government traditionally had sovereign immunity from suit.

[Discretionary functions]{.underline}: Federal act (FTCA) waives sovereign immunity in limited cases. Π may sue under state law with some exceptions: no jury, no punitive damages, no suits for discretionary functions. Discretionary functions are defined by two-step test:

1.  Is there a specific rule? If so, has the rule been followed?

    a.  Manuals are not specific rules. *Cope*.

2.  Is the discretionary act susceptible to, grounded in, and "fraught with" political, social, or economic policy judgments?

[Direct vs. indirect public services]{.underline}: N.Y. waives sovereign immunity for services that the public uses directly (e.g., hospitals) but not for services that generally protect the public (e.g., police).

[Policy: sovereign immunity]{.underline}

- Institutional competence: Courts don't have the knowledge and expertise to make judgment calls on policy and limited government resources. But courts do implicitly make judgment calls by determining whether something is negligent---reasonable or unreasonable.

- Shaping (rights): Government is elected, promotes interests of the public, shouldn't be second-guessed.

- Shaping: Potentially crushing financial burden of liability shouldn't be imposed on public actors.

[Cases]{.underline}

- *Riss v. City of New York*: Π sues police for not responding to her concerns. Court doesn't want to speak to limited resource allocation of the government.

  - Reserved issue: What if Riss had a protective order? Would this be a special relationship? Could she reasonably rely?

- *Cope v. Scott*: Court finds that road maintenance requires the balance of many issues, but putting up more road signs does not because there were many road signs already, so the park service does not have to balance aesthetics and commuter route concerns. Demonstrates court's sensitivity to specific facts of a case through use of "fraught with" standard.

### D. Emotional Harm

"Pure" emotional harm is not accompanied by physical injury. It may result from ∆'s negligent behavior directly or derivatively.

[Independent duty]{.underline}: There is no general independent duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid emotional harm.

[Policy: no recovery for emotional harm]{.underline}

- Likelihood of fraud and inability to assess damages

- Floodgates of litigation will open

- Beyond the desirable scope of tort law; save money for physical harm

- Administrability: there are no standards of reasonable care to avoid emotional harm yet; would have to develop these by juries over time

[Derivative duty]{.underline}: Π didn't suffer the harm that was risked by ∆'s negligence but suffered emotional distress or a third party suffers emotional distress from another's physical injury.

1.  Does ∆ owe a duty not to risk physical harm to Π?

2.  If yes, can ∆ be liable for resultant emotional harm to Π or third party?

    a.  [Impact rule]{.underline}: if ∆'s conduct caused some physical impact to Π, Π has cause of action for emotional harm. Some courts required physical symptoms of emotional harm. All-or-nothing.

        i.  Mere exposure without disease is not enough. *Metro-North*.

    b.  [Zone of danger rule]{.underline}: Softens impact rule, allows for near-misses. If Π was in the zone of danger of physical harm and feared for safety, even if not physically impacted, Π has cause of action. Some courts required physical symptoms. Some courts allow fear of another's safety.

    c.  [*Dillon* rule]{.underline}: Π need not have been in the zone of danger nor feared for own safety. Courts consider proximity, visibility, and relationship.

    d.  [Fear of future injury]{.underline}: Some courts allow Π to recover for fear of future injury. Impact rule sometimes at play. Many courts don't allow because it is speculative, invites fraud, and typically involves mass exposure so coffers should be reserved for physical harm.

        i.  May need over 50% chance of future disease to recover. *Potter*.

[Policy: recovery in limited circumstances]{.underline}

- Administrability: fewer cases can be brought with limitations, no floodgates

- Impact and zone of danger rules require that Π be in harm's way, so fraud is less likely

- Compensation for injured Π

- Deters ∆'s conduct that risks physical harm but does not result in physical harm

[Cases]{.underline}

- *Falzone v. Busch*: Π was almost struck by car, and her emotional response manifested in physical symptoms.

- *Metro North v. Buckley*: Π fears contracting cancer due to asbestos exposure. Court says Π fails zone of danger test because there was no danger of physical harm, and fails impact test because exposure does not count as physical impact.

- *Ayers*: Court allows recovery for Π who fears contracting cancer due to asbestos exposure, and Π already has asbestosis. Exposure is high enough to cause a disease, so may satisfy impact, and prove no fraud.

- *Potter*: Court says Π needs over a 50% chance of developing a disease to recover for emotional harm.

### E. Economic Harm

"Pure" economic harm is not accompanied by personal injury or property damage to Π.

[Independent duty]{.underline}: There is no independent duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid economic losses. Π suffers economic losses as a result of ∆'s negligent conduct and personal injury or property damage to a third party.

[Policy: no recovery for economic harm]{.underline}

- Amount of potential liability could be enormous

- Amount of potential liability is hard to predict, and so hard to insure against, and so ∆ may be deterred from engaging in valuable activities

- ∆ would still be liable for and deterred by physical harms

- Loss is usually already widely distributed, so argument to distribute loss by holding ∆ liable is weak

- Π can usually insure against economic harm (business-interruption insurance)

- Where to draw line between Πs who can recover for economic harm and Πs who can't?

[Derivative duty]{.underline}: Some courts permit recovery through derivative duty not to cause physical harm.

[Cases]{.underline}

- *532 Madison Ave v. Finlandia*: Urban disasters have more unmanageably large orbit of duty, so the line should be drawn at physical damage.

- *People Express*: Π could recover because there was a greater degree of foreseeable economic loss, and therefore there should be a correspondingly greater degree of liability.

- *Dunlop Tire*: Π could recover because there was a more direct impact

- *Koch*

- *BP Oil Spill*

# II. Strict Liability

[Judgment call]{.underline}: The judge can decide that ∆ is liable without regard to ∆'s negligence and thus forgo negligence analysis. But the Π must still show cause-in-fact and proximate cause, and Π's claim may still be subject to the same defenses that ∆ may raise in negligence cases.

[Traditional]{.underline}: Doctrine developed as an exception to liability only for negligence. Traditionally looked for "ultrahazardous" activities, based on degree of danger and uncommon usage. Simpler, higher level of generality / more rule-like.

[Modern]{.underline}: Modern courts speak of "abnormally dangerous" activities. Degree of danger and common usage are still considered, along with the concept of value to the community. More nuanced, lower level of generality / more standard-like.

- High risk of harm

- Probability of great harm

- Inability to eliminate risk through exercise of reasonable care (immune to utmost care)\*

- Uncommonness of activity\*

- Inappropriateness of activity in the area

- Extent to which danger of the activity outweighs its social value

[Cases]{.underline}

- *Rylands v. Fletcher*: Court considers the precedents of beasts and stenches escaping and creating mischief to add water. Distinguishes between "natural" and "non-natural" use of land, because ∆ brought water onto the land to create a man-made reservoir.

  - Reserved issue: If Π engages in an inherently dangerous activity such as driving, must show ∆ was negligent to recover.

- *Turner v. Big Lake Oil*: Court says bringing water onto land is a necessary and natural use because of the very dry environment; the water is a social good. ∆ is not strictly liable.

- *Cities Service Co. v. State*: In a complex and overcrowded society, strict liability incentivizes taking care with regard to harming neighbors.

- *State Dept*. *of Environmental Protection*: Danger of mercury.

- *American Cyanamid*: Court looks to care level first and decides that ∆ was negligent, so no need to employ strict liability. Court considers that ∆ would not have been able to avoid danger even with reasonable care.

### Negligence versus Strict Liability

[Care/activity levels]{.underline}: The actor makes his own choice regarding care and activity levels to reduce exposure to liability.

[Policy: why use strict liability]{.underline}

- *Administrability*: Judicial efficiency, less expert testimony, fewer issues at trial, may not even need trial, so lower per-case costs. But more cases may be brought, so potentially higher total costs. Depends in part on rule or standard, e.g., all use of explosives or dependent on context.

- *Error reduction*: More factual determination for negligence, so subject to more error. But depends on the percentage of error typical for a certain type of cases; strict liability is more likely to reduce error in cases in which negligence is difficult to prove, e.g., when explosions destroy evidence.

- *Optimal activity levels*: Strict liability does not affect care level because the imposition of liability above negligence is for accidents for which the precaution is more expensive than the liability. Strict liability affects activity levels because the more activity in which ∆ engages, the more accidents are likely to occur. So ∆ is incentivized to find cheapest method of conducting activity, considering how accident-prone the method is. But sometimes victims are more able to avoid accidents through their own activity levels, so negligence regime plus strict liability for victims properly affects activity levels.

- If negligence and victims adjusting activity levels do not prevent most accidents; if many accidents are not caused by negligence

- *Loss distribution*: Potential injurer may be better able to spread losses and buy insurance. But sometimes victim may have more knowledge or have systems in place to have insurance.

- *Rights*: Injurer should be strictly liable for injuries associated with benefits injurer receives as a result of the activity. Injurer should be strictly liable when injurer's risk creation is greater than victim's. Injurer should be liable for infringing on victims' liberty.

[∆ Π]{.underline}

no liability SL

SL no liability

N SL unless ∆ is N (SL + ∆'s contrib N)

N+contrib N SL unless ∆ is N and Π is not at all N

N+comp N SL unless ∆ is N, then comp N (Π bears nontortious)

SL+contrib N N

SL+comp N (∆ bears nontortious) comp N

Strict liability: does the activity reach the level of a social problem (rather than just a legal problem)? Auto accidents, dangerous industrial workplaces. Consider:

- Are both parties ordinary individuals? Is one a company?

- Could both parties be injured?

- Is the uninjured party necessarily an injurer?

[Pure no-fault systems]{.underline}:

- Loss of deterrence to ∆\--maybe ∆ is already deterred sufficiently by concern for own safety?

- Does negligence mostly result from momentary lapses?---maybe it's unjust to impose liability for momentary lapses

- Insurance\--Π and ∆ pay into the same insurance and premiums are probably pretty even

- Administrative cost savings---more money for Πs and ∆s, less for attorneys and insurers

# III. Conversion, Trespass, Nuisance

## A. Trespass

[Moving parts]{.underline}: The rule-like hard edges of trespass can be softened or stretched in common law.

- Entry: usually by things, but could include particles, vibrations, energy

- Damages: interference with Π's right of possession and occupancy, right to exclude others from use; usually intangible emotional damage

- Intent: intent to enter or use property

- Harm?: not needed unless there are other torts laid on top of trespass claim, in which negligence analysis is used

- Fault/care?: usually strict liability so this is irrelevant, unless entry is reckless

- Owner's options

[Strict liability]{.underline}: Trespass is usually a strict liability tort, as property law seems to favor cost-shifting to ∆.

[Remedy]{.underline}: If no harm is done to property, Π can receive nominal damages. Damages or injunction.

[Necessity]{.underline}: Necessity confers a privilege and a temporary reassignment of property. Public necessity involves ∆ using or damaging Π's property to defend a large group's properties or interests. This is an absolute necessity and is a complete bar to liability. Private necessity involves ∆ using or damaging Π's property to defend ∆'s own---temporary reassignment of property. This is qualified necessity and ∆ is liable to Π for damage. Timeframe matters---if there is time before the danger, Π and ∆ can contract rather than rely on law to make the deal and set the price.

[Payment scheme outcome]{.underline}: ∆ must weigh costs (harm to property vs. avoided danger). Π must weigh costs to self and benefits to ∆ and do what a court would consider "reasonable."

[Policy: liability with conditional necessity]{.underline}

- Fairness: if ∆ and Π are both innocent, party who is in danger should bear the cost of saving himself or property, not savior

- Shaping (rights): align liability with people's expectations and confidence in property rights, which feel very natural.

- Shaping: ∆ will be incentivized to compare the risk of harm to property with the risk of the danger ∆ is avoiding. Property owner will let ∆ use and potentially damage property, and let court deal with it rather than resort to self-help.

- But incentives: if property owner knows better how to protect against non-negligent harm, and ∆ is still liable for that harm, property owner has no incentive to take precautions. Liability should lie with the cheapest cost avoider---the party with the most relevant knowledge and capacity to act on it.

[Cases]{.underline}

- *Martin v. Reynolds Metals Co.*: Energy itself can count as entry.

- *Ploof*: ∆ had necessity to tie up his boat during a storm. The benefit to ∆ was greater than the harm to Π.

- *Vincent*: ∆ tied up boat during storm and boat damaged dock. Court held ∆ liable for damage. Although ∆ did nothing wrong, ∆'s act posed sufficiently high risk of damage to dock and ∆ may have known of high risk of harm to dock.

## B. Private Nuisance

[Dominant test]{.underline}: Nuisance is defined by whether Π should have to bear the interference with use and enjoyment without compensation. Doesn't have to take into account overall social utility of activity.

[Moving parts]{.underline}:

- Harm to Π's use and enjoyment of land

  - Substantial (more than minor)

  - Unreasonable (greater than Π should have to bear without compensation)

- Intent: knowledge of interference with use and enjoyment

[RST]{.underline}: If the nuisance is unintentional, court does negligence analysis. If the nuisance is intentional, consider the reasonableness of the interference and the gravity of harm vs. utility of conduct.

[RST § 526]{.underline}: Interference is unreasonable if harm is substantial and greater than what Π should have to bear without compensation.

[RST § 529A]{.underline}: Gravity \> utility, or harm caused by conduct is serious and the financial cost of compensation doesn't disincentivize the harm, then ∆ pays ongoing damages to Π to continue the nuisance.

[Remedies]{.underline}: Because nuisance can be an ongoing tort, remedies include damages for past and future harms while nuisance continues; and damages for past harms with injunction to stop nuisance. Courts consider:

- Parties' faults, if any---should Π have to bear for some reason; is ∆ contributing social value?

- Hardship to parties if nuisance continues or discontinues

- Value of activity constituting nuisance to the community

Four possible outcomes if Π brings nuisance claim:

- No nuisance. ∆ enjoins Π. ∆ sets price. Π can decide to accept lower use and enjoyment or pay to stop nuisance.

- Nuisance. Π pays ∆. Court sets price of the nuisance, says nuisance should stop only if Π's benefit is greater than ∆'s loss. Π can decide to accept lower use and enjoyment or pay to stop nuisance.

- Nuisance. Π enjoins ∆. Π sets price. Π can decide whether to sell right so ∆ can continue nuisance.

  - ∆ probably can't bargain if there are multiple Πs, so it is important that court decide correctly. In single-Π case, if ∆'s interest is much greater than Π's, parties will correct court's error in terms of maximizing utility.

- Nuisance. ∆ pays Π ongoing damages. Court sets price. ∆ can decide whether to stop nuisance or pay damages for future harms.

[Policy: remedies for nuisance]{.underline}

- ∆ is incentivized to find cheaper ways to operate.

- Π is compensated.

- Maximize social utility.

[Cases]{.underline}

- *Boomer v. Atlantic Cement Co.*: Court thinks cement factory's conduct is reasonable and a valuable service, but court may be driven by desire to compensate Π. Court awards ongoing damages, so ∆ can buy out Π and continue polluting or stop polluting. Dissent thinks environmental cost is greater than social value.

## C. Conversion & Trespass to Chattels

### Conversion

[Moving parts]{.underline}:

- Intent: willful interference

- Denial of someone's ownership rights---new owner, complete destruction

[Cases]{.underline}

- *Moore v. Regents of University of California*: Π had spleen removed and biologists used spleen cells to create profitable pharmaceutical. Π argued that his genetic material was his property from which he had the right to profit. Court says Π abandoned the cells so lost his property right.

- *Kremen*: Π sues for conversion of a domain name. Court says it is just applying the current case law.

### Trespass to chattels

[Moving parts]{.underline}:

- Intent: willful interference

- Temporary reassignment of property, minor damage (trespass to chattels)

[Remedy]{.underline}: Damage amount for harm done.

[Cases]{.underline}

- *Intel*: Question of whether lost employee time due to distracting email content is trespass to chattels (a willful interference with Internet servers (property?) that causes harm (lost employee time?)). Court is reluctant to extend the law, supposed slippery slope to annoying phone calls and pop-up ads. If Π had analogized to trespass to land, wouldn't have to prove harm.

# IV. Damages

[Policy]{.underline}: Can we serve multiple aims of tort law at once with damages?

[Constraint]{.underline}: Damages are constrained through different decision-makers: 1. Jury, 2. Trial judge (in federal court, trial judge may only remit, not add), 3. Appellate judges.

## A. Compensatory Damages

Compensatory damages seek to make Π whole, put in the position before injury, construct the counterfactual. Pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages may be compensated. Both may he hard to calculate.

[Cases]{.underline}

- *Seffert*: Π has medical expenses and pain and suffering, which are hard to quantify. Majority awards very high pain and suffering damages. Dissent thinks there should be proportionality with pecuniary damages for consistency, legitimacy, and feasibility.

## B. Injunctions

Courts use a four-factor test, the elements of which must all be met to grant an injunction:

- Irreparable harm

- Remedies at law (damages) are inadequate

- Balance of hardships between plaintiff and defendant warrants equitable remedy

- Public interest would not be disserved by permanent injunction

This test is controversial. Criticism includes the redundancy of two factors; conceptual straitjacket of a definitive test; failure to take into account other equitable defenses (unclean hands, laches, estoppel); presumptions are useful and will change if they are not useful.

[Policy]{.underline}

If the court doesn't grant injunction, Π will usually receive damages. When should equitable relief kick in? \[In nuisance cases, sometimes injunction is just used to enable Π set price at which it will tolerate the harm.\]

[Cases]{.underline}

- *eBay v. Mercexchange*: District court used categorical presumption to deny injunction because Merc didn't market its patented product. Circuit used presumption to award injunction because it is the general remedy for patent infringement. SCOTUS calls for four-factor test. Concurrence 1 says injunction is sensible relief for patent infringement. Concurrence 2 says court should consider new business practices (e.g., patenting products for licensing fees rather than for own use) and what bargaining situation is best.

- *TVA v*. *Long*: Court emphasizes government's proprietary interest when going through each factor. It's unclear that the test does much work.

## C. Punitive Damages

Jury calculates punitive damages. Courts have established three factors in considering whether punitive damages violate due process:

- Reprehensibility of ∆'s conduct

  - May be in part determined through ∆'s harms to non-Πs

- Proportion to compensatory damages

  - Over single-digit multiplier is unlikely to accord with due process.

- Relationship to criminal court damages for similar harms

[Policy: punitive damages]{.underline}

- Punishment: for egregious, outrageous behavior to Π. And people in Π's position?

  - Possible in reckless trespass, or in extreme negligence.

  - May compensate for harms that law doesn't recognize, e.g., pure emotional, pain and suffering, harms difficult to prove.

  - Unclear whether it makes sense to tie punishment to compensation through single-digit multiplier. And may under-deter if Π is not caught every time.

- Deterrence: properly deter ∆ from causing harm to Π. And Π's position?

  - Probability that injured parties will sue every time

  - Egregiousness of conduct---is it as important to try to deter negligence?

  - Consistency: ∆ must know how much liability to expect in advance; legitimacy; due process concerns

  - Single-digit multiplier may under-deter if ∆ is not caught every time.

- Compensation: lucky Π may get punitive damages for more than own harm, unless punitive damages are paid to the state. Injured parties who don't sue are not compensated unless through punitive damages class action.

[Problem of repeated punitive damages]{.underline}

Overdeterrence if jury awards punitive damages for non-Πs' harms. Core badness and individual badnesses need deterrence. Some states take into account previous punitive damages. Using single-digit punitive damages for each Π. Putting Πs together---would this increase or compress total punitive damages?

[Cases]{.underline}

- *Exxon*: ∆ negligently dumped 11 million gallons of oil. Punitive damages class sued and jury awarded \$5 billion. Court considers jury instructions (too arbitrary, meaningless), statutory caps (too arbitrary, not tied to anything), and decides to use a multiplier.

- *Pinto*: Ford conducted BPL analysis and determined that precaution was more expensive than liability; therefore ∆ took reasonable care. Jury awarded punitive damages because it found this practice reprehensible. Paradox of negligence.

- *State Farm*: Court favors single-digit multiplier.

- *Philip*-*Morris*: Court favors adjusting the jury instruction on harms to non-Πs to say that juries may consider for purposes of determining degree of reprehensibility overall, but not for purposes of calculating damages. Unclear what the difference is.

## D. Alternatives

### Class actions

[Policy: class actions]{.underline}

- Πs can bring "negative value" cases---proper deterrence; supplemental regulation of laws by citizens; justice

- Πs put pressure on ∆ to settle---judicial economy

- Preclusion effects---consistency, judicial economy, no duplication of litigation, courts are freed for other cases

- Ultimately difficult to use class actions with mass torts.

[Settlement classes]{.underline}

Packages are presented to the court to certify the class and approve the settlement at once. This creates a concern because there is no adversarial process, and the judge may not robustly investigate whether the class meets the Rule 23 standards.

[Damages]{.underline}

Settlers define which aspects of liability will receive damages: economic, emotional, based on different jurisdictions' laws.

[Problem with compensatory damages]{.underline}: Individual issues of causation and exposure mean compensatory damages are too variant, too difficult to calculate for each member. Potential solution: calculate total compensatory damages and put in a big fund, then dole out in individual hearings/administrative proceedings. \[This looks like workers compensation schemes or insurance.\]

[Problem with punitive damages]{.underline}: If main aim is to punish and deter ∆ rather than compensate Π properly, it may not matter what the individual damages are. But in order to properly deter ∆, should know how much harm ∆ caused to each Π.

[Cases]{.underline}

- *Amchem*: Court must do full class action analysis even for settlement classes.

- *Simon II*: Court tries to certify a 23b1 class (limited fund) by saying that the statutory cap / single-digit multiplier cap functions as a limited fund, a maximum amount that ∆ can pay. For punitive damages only, so an advisory jury would calculate total aggregate compensatory damages, not individual damages, and assign punitive damages that way. Limited fund idea is rejected.

### MDL

Similar cases go into transferee court from wherever. Pretrial/discovery proceedings are conducted there. Bellwether trials occur first. Then the other cases theoretically go back for trial, or are settled in transferee court. MDL is getting edged into litigation for all cases, looking more like a class action, through the bellwethers and resulting settlements. MDL as originally just consolidated discovery and individual trials.

Proper ways to ensure fairness? Opt-out. Non-binding bellwethers.

[Cases]{.underline}:

- *[Vioxx]{.underline}*: ∆ won most cases but ∆ settled all cases after for a significant sum. Perhaps ∆'s litigation costs were very high; parallel suits in which ∆ lost several so a good guide for similar cases gthat go through MDL but not for non-MLD parallel cases that are not sufficiently similar.

- *[Propulsid]{.underline}*: ∆ won all bellwethers and settled for a low amount.

What are other differences between MDL and class action?

### Compensation funds

[9/11 fund]{.underline}: Congress set up. Circumvented tort law by displacing airline liability and ignoring terrorist ∆s who would be unable to pay out. Congress affords legitimacy. Easier to administer than mass tort class action or MDL. Quick remedy for Πs. But Πs do not recover for emotional harm; do not receive declaratory relief. Issue of paying out beneficiaries of decedents.

[Gulf fund]{.underline}: BP set up. Anchored damages at a random figure, and based it on the future drilling profits. NO confusion about participation.

[MDL]{.underline}: Judge approves the anchored amount, affords legitimacy. Amount is open-ended based an on estimate of the amount of harm done. Court allowed BP to contract around tort law and not prove causation, avoid litigation.

**\**

**WHO SHOULD DECIDE?**

-most critical aspect of court as opposed to legislature making law is the incrementalism, addressing things as they come up. Legislature has more institutional competence, can take comprehensive as opposed to piecemeal steps to change. and the legislature can always pass new statutes if it disagrees with the court

-Hammontree: court wants to leave it to legislature

-Li: court acts over legislature

-Riss: court declines to act in deference to legislature

-Cope: legislature makes bright-line rule, on/off switch, that court turns into sliding scale

-Kremen, Intel, Moore: framing the court's role as extending or applying common law

-Moore: issue of first impression. Extend conversion doctrine originally intended for horses to cells. And the medical innovation based on DNA is also novel for conversion. Dissent says the court is supposed to deal with new laws like this. But court answers the easier question of whether to extend than how to apply. Extending allows more discussion of policy. Implicates question of the role of courts.

-mass torts and legislation: Congress enacted for 9/11. BP did independently for oil spill. Asbestos used class actions because the legislature just falls apart before enacting legislation sometimes. For DES Congress only extended statute of limitations to enable more lawsuits.

-rules take decisions away from the jury. Standards allow jury's discretion. Getting out of the car and looking versus the real-world usage.

**WHO SHOULD PAY?**

*[Lawson]{.underline}* (note 6) line drawing vs. *Tarasoff* balancing: foreseeability of harm to Π, certainty that Π suffered harm, close causation between ∆ conduct and Π injury, moral blame, policy of prevention, burden of duty, insurability. compare with the line drawing in emotional/economic harms. "impact rule", "zone of danger" rule (impact or near-miss)

-imagine new jurisdiction. should it expand impact rule? consider the CA balancing test factors. argue for expansion or against it

[Goals of tort law]{.underline}

-Calabresi has a "fit and justify" analysis. he focuses on "cheapest cost avoider" and the issue of the coase theorem

-compensation goal: redistribute incidence of loss, spread through social insurance (risk spreading/sharing); wealth redistribution according to deep pockets, which juries like, justified through ability to bear burdens, reflects power to enact change in society, perhaps political. backward-looking/ex-post. if this were the only goal, a causal link between act and harm would not be needed, we could just have social insurance/taxation.

-deterrence goal: minimize costs of injuries and precautions without concept of fault. make people behave in a way that saves these costs. BPL. collective/specific: regulate through prohibition and penalty; no causation, no price, no link to harm that may have occurred; but maybe risk creation (lost chance, future harm) links to causation more. market/general: sets tax / increases price for risky behavior; works through causation, if you cause harm you have to pay

-what is the law's role in choosing who takes the precaution? should liability really be placed on the cheapest cost avoider?

-Calabresi thinks precautions and calculations require foreseeability. Π can't take adequate precautions to guard against extent of harm so it doesn't matter if Π can foresee it

[Coase theorem]{.underline}

-if there is no liability, people buy precautions or bribe their implementation. if there is liability, the company can pay for the public's precautions. regardless of where liability is placed, the market finds the cheapest cost avoider to pay for the precaution. the law has no function

-requirements for this to work: no transaction costs for information exchange, if parties are easily identifiable and costs are known; no care for distribution costs, indifferent to who bears costs of precaution, compensation not satisfied; cheapest cost avoider is best briber/dealmaker, the one with lowest transaction costs

-function of law might deal with distribution and finding best briber

What if you punished people for risk creation and did away with moral luck? Related to proportional liability?

-tort system is bad for low-cost injuries.

Tradeoffs

Paradoxes

- Short run versus long run

- Intent versus effects

- Regulation issues and noncompliance

- Defining categories

Similar schemes already in place

- Workers compensation allows for strict liability without fault, and the only defense is Π's wanton disregard for safety or intentional self-infliction

Alternatives to tort liability

- Workers compensation: *administrative hearings* can be used with strict liability because there is no finding of fault. Then *injuries are categorized* and awards are based on what types of injuries were suffered. This *promotes* *foreseeability of extent of liability* for ∆, and awards are more limited than the pain and suffering awards that are very unpredictable in tort actions.

- Ways to make more people recover, subject ∆ to liability from more Πs, but cap amounts?

  - Problem: not full compensation

- Mandatory victim insurance

  - Problem: noncompliance, limited recovery

Strict liability: does the activity reach the level of a social problem (rather than just a legal problem)? Auto accidents, dangerous industrial workplaces. Consider:

- Are both parties ordinary individuals? Is one a company?

- Could both parties be injured in an accident?

- Is the uninjured party necessarily an injurer? (e.g., drivers)

Negligence assigns costs based on fault. If there is no negligence, the cost lies where it falls (on the victim). Strict liability assigns costs based on a determination of the type of activity, likelihood and degree of harm, etc. In negligence, it appears that the system is mostly concerned with fault. In strict liability, the problem is cast more as assigning fault for the mere activity, without a categorical determination of wrongful conduct. In essence, it discusses fault without wrongdoing. Liability without wrongdoing, simply because of the type of activity. SL also enables the liable actor to determine ahead of time who would be the cheapest cost avoider and bribe the CCA to take the precaution.

Negligence has advantages: errors are less severe because at least ∆ is at fault, not just paying. It also entertains innovation, new industries that may have some inherent risk of harm. Educational/coordinating function to the public---if you know the standard of care required of ∆ beforehand, you know how to affect your own care or activity level. This is useful when you are able to affect the risk of harm through your own care or activity level, and when you can know the standard of care. So in a way both Π and ∆ can take proper care to best reduce risk of harm.

Comparative negligence means Π's care is not pegged to ∆'s care---each pays for his own fault.

What happens in pure no-fault systems?

- Loss of deterrence to ∆\--but maybe ∆ is already deterred sufficiently by concern for own safety?

- Does negligence mostly result from momentary lapses?---maybe it's unjust to impose liability for momentary lapses

- Insurance\--Π and ∆ pay into the same insurance and premiums are probably fairly equal

- Administrative cost savings---more money for Πs and ∆s, less for attorneys and insurers

Nontortious actors/causes:

- In a pure comparative negligence scheme, Π bears the cost of nontortious actors/causes.

- In a strict liability scheme, ∆ bears the cost of nontortious causes.
