Professor Huang Tort Outline

Test Advice: Make argument, use facts, argu both sides like in class. after u argue both sides if u have judgement on 1 side u can say so. set priorities hone in on the problem. word limit- x use creac or irac, just analysis and conclusion. all analysis and conclusion. don't feel like attention. every sentence use facts o argument.

Introduction to Tort Law:

When we read: context, circumstance, what don't we know, whose speaking (sincere?), whose the audience? Bring yourself to it. Why do we care?

Themes:

- Corrective Justice and Civil Recourse: Ex post framework

  - Corrective Justice- fixing the wrong to restore moral balance. Focus on the defendant's obligation to pay

    - Critique: immeasurable, and less applicable in our times when we have faceless corporations and liability insurance

  - Civil Recourse- focus on what π is entitled to receive. providing victims for a recourse for civil wrongs. Recognition of the wrong, not even aspiring to be fully compensatory or fully correcting a wrong.

- Ex ante Framework

  - Optimal deterrence- prevent future tortious actions that *are excessively risky*

    - *Pro:* Economic solution- just enough deterrence to prevent risks not worth taking

    - *cons:* only takes economic values into account- what about human values- P &S

  - Loss distribution- inclination to develop rules of law that permit imposition of tort liability on business and institutions that can distribute their liabilities through the purchase of insurance or raising the cost of their products.

    - Con- does not satisfy moral blame, tort law is expensive mechanism for distributing losses

- Redress of social grievances (reason to sue even when other goals of tort law won't be satisfied)

  - Pros: Opportunity to put authority on trial

- Compensation- victims are provided compensation to serve the other goals of tort law, not its own law Holmes "loss from accident must lie where it falls"

  - Pros: sense of security

- Competing aims of tort law:

  - Deterrence (Defendant based) v compensation (plaintiff based)

  - Blame-worthiness (Defendant based) v fairness (plaintiff based)

  - Risk spreading (Defendant based) v social welfare (plaintiff based)

- Mixed system

- Recovery: only try to deter extremely risky behavior. don't want over deterrence, or for π to be overly litigious

E*lements of Tort Law: (1) breach of duty (2) causation (3) strict liability (4) damages/injury*

# **Negligence-** theory of breach of some duty; failure to exercise reasonable care under the circumstance. (more protective over persons and property)

**1.3 Elements of a Tort: (1) Breach of Duty; (2) Causation; (3) Strict Liability; (4) Damages/Injury**

1)  **Breach of Duty:** failure to comply with the applicable standard of care

    a)  **Negligence**: failure to take care that reasonable person would under the circumstances.

        i)  Standard: BPL

            (1) Always consider if there were alternatives available.

        ii) Method: Always start with identifying the negligent action (this becomes the "burden" in BPL)

        iii) Question: Objective v. Subjective

             (1) Physical disability? Children? Doing an adult activity? Expertise? Emergency doctrine?

        iv) Shortcuts:

            (1) Negligence per se (statutes) -- violation = liability, no safe harbor.

            (2) Customs -- not dispositive 🡪 consider setting industry standards

            (3) Medical standards (mandatory, and create safe harbor if met)

        v)  Defenses: Comparative negligence or Contributory negligence (MD)

            (1) Pure comparative (CA) v. modified comparative? (WI)

            (2) Assumption of risk?

    b)  **Affirmative Duties:** taking care during the rescue

        i)  Duty to warn: if you cause the harm, you should at least warn.

        ii) Failure to warn: adequate instructions or warnings.

            (1) Must instruct and warn about possible consequences; label clutter

        iii) Informed consent: medical standard

        iv) Special relationships: parents or psychiatrists (duty to warn)

2)  **Causation:**

    a)  Factual causation

        i)  "But For" causation

        ii) Multiple sufficient causes 🡪 non-tortious cause?

        iii) Multiple necessary causes

        iv) "Joint" tortfeasors (jointly -- all agree to do a tort -- conduct OR indivisible harm)

        v)  Proof problems

            (1) Preponderance of evidence standard

            (2) Alternative liability ([Summers v. Tice]{.underline}), shifts burden on defendant to prove themselves not liable

            (3) Market share liability

        vi) Harm: lost chance (harm is redefined as lost chance of survival rather than death) -- gets around "but for" causation, but scope is limited

        vii) Allocation of damages: (1) Joint and several; (2) Several

    b)  Legal causation / Proximate Cause

        i)  Scope of risk: harm within the risk

        ii) Pertinant considerations

            (1) Type of harm (usually breaks chain\....)

3)  **Strict Liability:**

4)  **Damages/Injury:**

5)  **Policy Considerations:**

Hammontree v Jenner (CA 1971) Jenner has seizure and drives into bike shop and harms Mrs. H.

Rule: sudden illness rendering a driver unconscious will not be grounds for an action in negligence.

We read this precisely bec. its an ordinary case (the law doesn't change)

Who should pay?

Brown v Kendall new negligence regime. dog fight case. New version of tort law (Mass S.C.)

Imp: shift of burden on π to prove defendant hasn't shown ordinary care. And Ordinary care instead of extra care

Rule: trespass or case will lie unless def. intended to injure or negligence, and always held to ordinary standard.\
Analysis: need some form of fault

**Negligence** is breach of this duty; the failure to exercise the care that would have been exercised by the reasonably prudent person *under the circumstances.*

Jury determines negligence

Two categories of negligence:

> 1- Three different ways to be negligent: (1) Carelessness; (2) Foolishness; (3) Selfishness
>
> 2- Conduct failing to comply with standard (driving above speed limit\...)

**Reasonably Prudent Person (RPS)** is an aspirational standard

Imagines the ordinary reasonable person we expect to have in our community; does not actually have to reflect the 'average' person.

Assumes perfect compliance, reasonable person is reasonably careful all the time.

## Standard of Care: The Reasonable Person Standard: Objective standard:

We have duty to exercise reasonable care not to risk foreseeable injury to plaintiff

Adams v Bullock **trolley,** Cordozo π swinging wire from bridge, electrocuted. overturning TC/jury opinion

Defenses- u can't foresee *this* so would have to protect the whole line.

Corodozo making the flip side of the argument- insulate?? \$\$\$, there was nothing better he could have done. (untaken precautions) Was nothing he could have done better

Rule: not negligent if he takes reasonable precautions. This wasn't foreseeable.

Holding: no liability to train company

Reasoning: the accident was not fairly within the area of ordinary. **the untaken precautions were not reasonable**

Braun:

Man charged for leaving naked wires for lots of years even though originally vacant

They should have taken into account the gradual changes in locality,

Question is whether the determinacy in the exercise of reasonable care should have thought that people man come into contact with this.

**Negligence Principle:**

**Objective standard**, stricter than heaven which takes into account idiosyncrasies. We don't take limitations or incapacitation into account

Holmes: unless distinct defect bind, doesn't matter intention

**Cons: s/t no pre-existing sufficiently concrete and uniform norms. Ex: highway accidents need to think of traffic, weather at the time.**

Also, technical cases, jury need to be educated beforehand to learn the objective standard.

Pros: ease of adjudication, feasibly of F,F- its too hard to determine whether she really did to the best of her abilities,

> Better deterrence, less excuses- if someone is incapable of complying with the level he should desist,

\+ fair

Cons: maybe less fair

## Circumstances & Reasonable Woman Standard Taking circumstance into account- but harm or help 

**Reasonable Standard:** Not what average does, but what average ought to do.

Daniels v Clegg**:** Reasonable Woman Standard**\
Facts:** girl coming down hill w/ horse and buggy. Daniels (male defendant) did not turn out of her way. And they crash and she's injured and sues.

Jury instructions: consider age of girl, and that she was a woman

Ordinary person: in a rush

Issue: was she contributory negligent?

Holding: no contributory negligence bec defendant should not have expected girl to be competent like man in the circumstances. we cant require a higher degree of diligence then she can do.. (lol)\
Note: can flip argument- and say that she shouldn't have been driving

Little Rock v Tankersley (old lady exiting train w/o enough time, and gets injured) TC ruled for T (OL)

Issue: woman's contributory negligence?

Rule: Jury instructions should include reasonable under the circumstance, i.e. age, sex, and physical condition

Holding: she was contributorily negligent- not prudent in her circumstance to attempt to get off the train. *\*
Note can flip argument- train was not designed adequately for any individual wearing a dress and high heels

Comparing the 2 cases talking about factoring sex into reasonable person standard, use clothing instead of sex to avoid discrimination

- **Objective standard:** Generally the **reasonable person standard** is an **[external, objective]{.underline}** standard and is not based on the defendant's unique capacity of care.

- **Subjective standard:** would be if jury were asked if the **individual defendant** exercised reasonable care under their particular set of circumstances. Would create a different rule for every person.

  **Pro's of Objective standard**

- Cost and ease of adjudication -- no mind reading, easy fact finding

- Subjective standard encourages fraud and deception 🡪 incentive to understate strengths

- Encourages more care and caution -- might push defendants that are incapable of complying with objective standard to reduce activity levels.

- Fairness: treats everyone equally.

**Con's of Objective Standard:**

- Not impossible to inquire into 'state of mind' - Juries determine intent in criminal cases

- Only increases safety if the objective standard is understood by the 'below-average individual' 🡪 this is unlikely because they are below-average...

- Not fair, treating people equally in this case might remove people from activity that is needed or desirable. Society might prefer allowing some people to be able to engage in some activities, despite increased risk (disabled people should be able to drive)

**[Physical Disability]{.underline}: Ordinary care for a person with the same disability.**

If a person has a distinct physical defect that is recognizable to everyone around, others can take reasonable precautions based on his/her defect.

- Physical disability is visible, measurable, and verifiable.

- Jury may consider whether physical limitation should induce the person to take extra precautions or not engage in activity at all. (E.g. blind person shouldn't drive\...)

**[Mental disability:]{.underline} No special standard**

- Can't know if mental infirmity is constant or if the person was lucid when causing injury.

- Incentives to guardians to control mentally ill charge.

- They are often invisible and hard to measure.

**[Children]{.underline}**: **Ordinary care for a child of the same age, intelligence, and experience.**

- **Below 5: no negligence**

- **5-18: Semi-Objective Standard**

- Adults around a child are expected to take self-protective care around children.

- **Dangerous adult activity:** employ ordinary, adult standard

- Don't want kids doing adult activities, people won't expect kids to be doing adult activity, no social value, and could be necessarily dangerous.

- *Adams v. Bullock*: No contributory negligence because jury instructed that the "degree of care required by the child is the same\...as boys of that age, intelligence, and judgment would exercise"

- *IL*: No negligence for children under 7; dangerous activities = operating a vehicle, mini-bike, motorcycle, powerboat, airplane, or the like; not dangerous = driving a farm vehicle or riding a bicycle.

- *NY*: No negligence for children under the age of four

**[Superior Attributes]{.underline}/[Expertise]{.underline}: Ordinary care for a person with the same level of expertise.**

- Other people rely on person's expertise and act accordingly.

- They are more qualified to act at higher standard -- they know better.

- Could disincentivize people from gaining expertise or punishes people for having expertise.

- **Restatement, Section 289(b):** Defendant, in addition to exercising the attention, perception of the circumstances, memory, knowledge of other pertinent matters, intelligence and judgment as would a reasonable person, must also exercise ***such superior attributes*** as the actor himself has

**Emergency Doctrine 🡪** A person confronting an emergency not of his or her own making is required to exhibit only an honest exercise of judgment ("reasonable care under the circumstances," *Levey v. DeNardo*, pg. 59)

Some Categories where Tort law does Tailor the negligence standard:

- Children- semi objective standard, expected to exercise degree of care that would be reasonable of a child of sim. Age, intelligence and experience

Gross v Allen\
Holding: overturned appellate decision that he should be tried as an adult, skiing is recreational, **and especially he was on the bottom of the slope**. applied semi objective reasonable care standard

  --------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Generic RPS                             Tailored RPS

  Greater than 18                         Between 4 and 18

  Less mental ability (Vaughan case 58)   Superior ability/expertise: makes sense for incentive ( to be careful) and fair ( "she's capable to have done it this way..."

  Mental infirmity                        Physical infirmity- deterrence
  --------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Difference between physical and mental infirmity:

4 year old bike case NYT Times Case

- Holding: 4 year old can be tried, no bright line rule over 4. (rule is until 4)

Exception "but for adult activity" mainly adults.

Dellwo ***"**[adult activity case"]{.mark}* 12 year old on motor boat held to adult standard

Reasoning- no one can tell it's a child beforehand

- Infirm adults:

  - physical- u take into account, can harm or hurt, people can see it and can plan accordingly (Warning) ex- jaywalking may say u should have taken more caution because of the disability.

  - Mental- *don't* take into account. Reasons- don't see it, hard to measure, can still be careful, want to keep the incentive to be careful

    - Ex: landowner w/ hay case. Lawyer tried to plead "mental weakness dif standard" judge refused bec would be too various

Robert v Ramsbottom: had stroke and then drove w/ impaired conscious.

- Holding: remained liable for not realizing the sig. of his prior mishaps and not stopping to drive.

- If we were the defense we would argue that it was physical infirmity

- If prosecution- it was mental, impaired ability to think

  - Look for soft words and standards to make the arguments- he likes creativity!

<!-- -->

- Gender Differences:

Pros: avoid inequitable results, for children- maybe a proxy for maturity bec more observable.

Cons: may marginalize

- **Superior attribute: ex semi truck driver, is held to standard of reasonable for another experiences semi-truck driver**

Ordinary under the circumstance: children, expertise/ability, infirmity: physical or mental

It's all about the jury instructions.

###  

Bethel v NYC transit authority (switch to ordinary standard)

Holding: overturns the duty of common carriers of having to exercise *utmost* care back to *reasonable* standard.

Background: Common carriers (railroads) had higher duty of care bec was so dangerous, 1) but not anymore. 2) *Also reasonable person standard is already under the circumstance so takes that in.*

Reasoning: want to promote the social good of railroads, incentivize them to keep running. But may also scare passengers from riding

**NPR Gun Case**:

Facts: strawbuyer for her grandson who murders his child.

Holding: highest standard of reasonable care in gun industry

**Idea: maybe it is the same thing to say held to highest standard to saying reasonable under the circumstance. But may still send a message out consider it as a normative message to the community Kansas gun seller liability**

Seller knew that man was unable to purchase and was just using his grandmother.

Court held seller accountable -- have to use "highest standard of reasonable care" to keep weapons away from felons.

Emergencies: Should we lower the standard and hold to a dif standard than reasonable.

Pros: lower standard- bec jury might error if told ordinary- they may not know what's ordinary under the circumstance. Institutional competence- jury may do it wrong, or right. Also, maybe tort law is premised on foreseeability which isn't possible in emergency. **Maybe jury does respond differently to dif words (** back to aforementioned argument if there's even a difference once we have under the circumstance)

**Emergency Doctrine**

In the law, when in an emergency, not of your own making, you only need to show **honest exercise of judgment** (aka you tried your best in an emergency). Lesser standard of care.

- Jury should imagine what a reasonable person would do only with the given amount of time to prepare (we should not imagine what a reasonable person would do in similar circumstance had they foreseen the circumstance and had adequate preparation time).

Questions to consider:

- Why carve out emergency doctrine at all? Isn't an emergency part of the circumstances?

- What constitutes an emergency? There is little uniformity in the law.

- Who is incentivized by this lower standard of care? There is no reason for incentives because emergencies are by definition unpredictable.

**MI Sudden Emergency Doctrine --** "If a driver acts according to his or her best judgment, or who, because of lack of time in which to form a judgment omits to act in the most judicious manner is not chargeable with negligence if the emergency was not brought about by the party's own negligence."

> Sudden emergency must have been unusual or totally unexpected in order for a jury to receive the Sudden Emergency Instruction.

**Alaska** -- Tailoring is unnecessary because we use the term 'under the circumstances'

Modern approach: ordinary occurrence bec of s1's negligence, not within exclusive control of defendant and not due to any contribution by plaintiff.

Baltimore and Ohio RR co. v Goodman Holmes **RULE**

Facts: π hit by train he slowed down but his view was blocked.

Issue: we're deciding π negligence, bec if is, then defendant is off the hook

Holding: Court takes away decision from jury, and holds Goodman negligent- he should've taken more precaution when he knew he couldn't see. holds there was clear standard of conduct

Changes standard to rule. Gives strict instruction to jury- "if he didn't look he's negligent"

Jury: decides negligence, they have intuitive understanding of how the world usually works. Skid mark on 25mph street= circumstantial evidence, but sometimes u need expert witness.

Reasoning: Holmes decides this way because 1) is thinking about what's good for the law, and doesn't want this to keep getting decided differently by dif. Juries

*Res Ipsa Loquitor:* ex- if someone hits s1 on sidewalk know there was negligence but not how, bec someone who collides like that does so bec of negligence- then we send to jury.

**Pokora v Wabash railway Co.** (Cordozo) (Differentiated from Goodman) **STANDARD**

Holding: erroneously applied Goodman, shows the risk in framing standard as rules. Goodman (previous π) should have looked but here was different facts so should go to Jury to decide

Distinguishes from Goodman, calls most of it Dicta. Institutional competency. Circumstances matter, therefore need standard, otherwise ppl could get killed.

S/t standard to judge- when it's so clear (JML, DV, SJ), no reasonable jury can go the other way.

Rule "if he didn't look he's negligent" then goes to jury to look at the facts and decide whether he did.

Holmes on Jury in Negligence case

sometimes judge should decide bec has more experience in this area, judge can pick up on patterns, and instead of letting decisions oscillate should decide.

sometimes jury has more daily experience and they should determine.

### 

### **Negligence Formula: Judge Learned Hand**

has to be foreseeable,

**P: probability .** How much of a differ the precaution would make

**L:** magnitude of loss gravity of resulting loss/injury loss ben saved, for every good...

Ex: in this case 30% chance of harm w/o bargee, 10% w/ bargee. So P is 20%

Compared to **B-burden of adequate precaution**

If B is less than PL, than u should have taken it.

Critiques:

- Info costs/measurements

- Sometimes weirdly precise- we're asking jury to step inside the actors mind and calculate if its perceptible, imagine this is going on...

- Non commensurability- subjective

- Jururs- we're not asked to do a formula- evaluating if its reasonable in the actor's mind, the theory usually goes to the judges

U.S. v Carrol Towing

Holding: in this circumstance: company should have Bargee aboard during working hours.\
Reasoning: duty to protect others from harm when the burden of taking adequate precaution is less than the product of the probability of the resulting harm and the magnitude of the harm

We're assessing whether Bargee is liable bec then others less liable. Comparative negligence

### Statutes

**[Negligence "per se"]{.underline}** = Negligence as a matter of law, whereby statutes create civil liability for their violation

**[Excuse defenses:]{.underline}** Necessity ([Tedla]{.underline}?); Incapacity (e.g. children); Emergency ([Tedla]{.underline}, e.g. if non-compliance safer)

[**Defense of limited statutory purpose** (statute is irrelevant)]{.underline}:

- Plaintiff was not **class of persons** or did **not suffer type of harm** intended to be protected by statute.

- This defense rarely prevails in practice because purpose if not usually clear.

- For this defense to work, the plaintiff could not by **any stretch of the imagination** have been an intended beneficiary of the statute's protection. (Exception case: [DiCaprio v. NY Central RR]{.underline})

- Modern courts likely to hold that at least a "secondary purpose" of statute was to protect individuals in the plaintiff's position:

- \(1\) If there is a legislative history or preamble referencing all of those in the plaintiff's situation, then courts are likely to find the plaintiff to be an intended beneficiary

- \(2\) If violation of the statute does not increase the risk of harm to those in the plaintiff's situation, the courts are unlikely to hold the plaintiff to be an intended beneficiary

  **[Courts read statute's protection broadly to include indirect injuries]{.underline}**

- Courts are likely to read statute's protection broadly to include **indirect injuries**

- E.g. Statute prohibits sale of alcohol to drunks; a shop violates the statute, and a drunk person is served and gets into a car accident, injuring a third-party; the shop is liable.

Statutory negligence- (N.P.S.)

Martin,

excuses (Tedla, Restatement)

Purpose (sheep case)

Custom

TJ Hooper

Medical malpractise

Who decides?

Judge/jury

Legis/court

Instit competence

R v Ss

Reasonable who?

Objective/subjective

**Martiv V Herzog** (no light on buggy)

Holding: Negligence from statute

Pros: *Institutional Competency* - they know better, u need lights in certain situations

Coordination- when u have statute- other people know

RPS- its unreasonable not to follow the law, especially safety law

U can argue- RP could not know this law, or Emergency

If s1 argues its hard to come up with rule- u can say well we have one already

Cons: legislature doesn't do case by case analysis, doesn't anticipate emergency.

Confusing- rule w/ exceptions = standard?

**Tedla V Ellman (**Safety exception to statutory negligence)

Facts: were going the opposite way from what statute said, but was safer.

Holding: Not negligent,

Reasoning: safer for her to walk on opposite side, would have been counterproductive to follow rule\
**Rule:** Where a statutory general rule of conduct fixes no definite standard of care, but merely codifies or supplements a common law rule, which has been subject to exceptions; or where the statute is intended to promote public convenience or safety, then in the absence of clear language to the contrary, it is not negligence as a matter of law for one to violate the statute, if by so doing he is likely to prevent---rather than cause---the accident which it is the purpose of the statute to avoid.

**Garris v Scott** (exception based on statutory purpose)ƒ

Statute- to avoid disease separate sheep, sheep fell over board

Holding: not liable bec safety wasn't the purpose of the statute

Can argue- that it was secondary purpose, or that legislature didn't make another rule regarding this purpose bec it already had this. So doesn't matter what I was originally intended for.

**Who should determine breach of duty and make rules? Legislature or court?**

- Negligence per se (statutory negligence) is legislatures' deciding law and breach of duty.

#### Custom

TJ Hooper Case:\
Facts: Defendant= operator of tugboats towing barges that are lost during storm. Negligence claim from failing to supply the tugs with radios that would have warned them of upcoming storms.\
Holding: Custom is not dispositive, but in most cases whether a whole industry would be negligent is a jury question.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    Statute                Custom            Malpractice
  ----------------- ---------------------- ----------------- -----------------
  If Fail           N... (Unless)          Evidence          Neg

  If Comply         Not Nec ok. Evidence   Evidence          Not Neg
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Ex: Statute "need to have working radio"

Have Radio: Means nothing to be same as statute

No Radio: Negligent per se

No Radio- but bec. Of electricity: [Statute, but bring in custom as evidence]{.mark} (not sure wat I wrote here)

If u meet Custom+ Statute= you have convincing case but not per see

- If statute conflicts with custom

  - If its safer to disregard statute- do that (the exception)

  - You can bring custom as evidence that e/b doing it bec. its safer

#### Malpractice:

- is determinative for negligence

  - **Reasons:**

    - **would be too hard for jury to know what's normal for Dr. (use in issue spotter in extrapolating to other professions)**

    - we don't want jury in charge here- so making custom (malprac for doc) determinative

- But maybe doesn't make a difference bec difficult issues can't be resolved w/ simple black letter law, some courts interpret medical experts as being in conflict w/ prevailing medical standard and will still go to jury.

Demise of Locality Rule

Reasonable physician standard is malpractise, but reasonable patient is just negligence stnadsr.

Sheeley v Memorial Hospital

Facts: Sheeley -- mom, sues for complications due to an epistomy from Dr. Ryder

Holding: Yes, Dr leslie (experienced doc) can be an expert witness and tell us the standard of which to hold Dr. Ryder, locality rule no longer applicable

Reasoning: Overturns same or similar communities test in favor of a national standard and hold that a dr. is under a duty to use the degree of care and skill that is expected of a reasonably competent practitioner in the same class to which he or she belongs in the same or similar circumstances

Defense argues that Dr Leslie is overqualified and we shouldn't hold Dr. Ryder to that standard

Theory behind this- Holmes wants everyone to be average or higher, raise the national standard.

but locality rule- is so that Doctors aren't discouraged from working in low income communities. we don't want them scared that they're going to be tried by standard of fancy pants doctors.

in this case**- the jury still makes the decision- so even under strong doctrine of malpractice- we see its more standard like**

BP Oil Well Spill Disaster on the Deepwater Horizon

Facts: Blowout preventer failed, drilling mud blew out onto the rig (forced up by oil and water) they tried to seal, but it didn't and flammable oil and gas rose. BP conducted a negative pressure test and declared it a success because no fluid was observed flowing from the kill line for thirty minutes and there was no pressure on the kill line. However, 1,400 psi pressure remained on the drill pipe at the time and the negative test should have been declared a failure because something had blocked the line. BP Well Site Leader Done Vidrine told the Transocean drill crew to proceed with displacing the remaining mud in the riser above the BOP with seawater and later there was a blowout.

Holding: gross negligence and willful misconduct ( liability quadruples) (they already admitted to neg.

Potential players: Haliburton- cement co. Transocean, BP

BP was aware for years of Haliburton bad work- didn't conduct tests in timely manner

NPR Podcast: 1) Haliburton- provides the cement to secure the wells. 2) Transocean- provides and staffs rigs, drilled the well; ( 3) Cameron and M-1 manufactured the Horizon's blowout preventer- judge dismissed him)

Mistakes: 1) Halliburton: They took negative pressure test to prevent gas from leaking. Rig operators didn't like the reading so did second test, and did another test w/ dif. equipment and then just used the reassuring numbers, w/o notifying anyone of the inconsistency. 2) Halliburton knew cement slurry wasn't stable but did little to warn BP.

Solutions: companies should form Safety Commission

Frontline: BP being sued for willful misconduct and gross negligence

Willfull misconduct includes reckless conduct

Gross negligence ?= recklessness

Defenses based on Plaintiff's Conduct (that plaintiff is responsible for his own hurt):

Contributory negligence- complete bar to recovery. Transitioned to Comparable negligence.

Affirmative duty to rescue

**The Moch Case**

Facts Moch π building caught fire sues Rensselaer Water Co. for failure to supply the waters in the fire hydrants.

Holding**: dismissed, was just denial of a benefit not a wrong. difference between misfeasance and nonfeaseance**

Reasoning: differentiates from surgeon who is liable even when he operates w/o pay, and engineer who forgets to shut off steam, or automobile maker

**Differentiation between refusal for being an instrument of good and to be at the point where its like being an instrument of harm.**

- CL borrow from statute

- Statute borrow from CL- Clean water act is a statute, and looked for meaning of willful misconduct in common law.

- Can statutes create torts? Yes, Sometimes.

  - HOW? would have to express the affirmative duty- right in private cause of action- write this will create a tort. u

### Sources of Affirmative Duty:

#### Special Relationships: Special Relationships: 

#### Schools

An exception to gen rule of no affirmative duty to rescue or protect is when they're in special relationship.

Examples: common carriers, innkeepers, parents of their care, child care professionals. Ur entering a relationship and waiving ur right of minding your own business.

Extends to mental health professionals who have duty to warn someone endangered by their patient. When patients has expressed intention to injure 3^rd^ party.

Cuyler v United States

Facts: Cuyler sues the United States (under federal torts claims act) for medical personnel failure to report possible abuse of first (Norman) Child, which they were required to do by law.

Issue: Does violation of a statute make him liable for tort?

Holding: No liability. the statutory definition of act doesn't come in here unless there was already a duty of care owed to the plaintiff by the defendant.\
Options around this: write in statute\
As laywer: u want to show that "but for this malpractise" he would have made a different decision

Munn Connecticut School Case

Issue: Is there affirmative duty to warn about insect born disease on trip? Basically, does this fall into special relationship exception?

Holding: Yes, Schools have special relationship. General duty of school (as having displaced parents for the time, custodians)

Public

**Move: Make it narrow.**

Affirmitive Duty: if A) created risk in 1^st^ place B) Undertook Rescue C) Special Relationship D) Good Samaritan Laws E) Vermont F) Exceptions

Basically, first we have to establish duty, then we use BPL- they're throwing in something about breach- really about what they should have done for duty- what the warning should have been.

**[Public Policy Argument: to det. potential liability for school. Great Discussion to USE. BPI Kidnve way]{.smallcaps}**

1)  Normal expectation of participants of school sponsored trip abroad- is that the organizer of the trip would take reasonable measure to warn the participants and their parents about serious insect bearing diseases

2)  public policy of encouraging participation in this activity- we don't think this would have a chilling effect, actually salutary effect- by promoting safety , eliminating unnecessary risks- will likely encourage enthusiasm for travel.

3)  increase litigation: even if not justified school may become afraid, and stop trips. No just bec. we recognize a duty here- doesn't make it an open and shut case- even if there's a duty still need to prove foreseeable and theat the school didn't take adequate measures. and comparative negligence still applies. also, here the school already has a general duty to take reasonable measures ot ensure safety of its minors and we're just etending it to this one specific aspect so not opening it up too much

4)  decisions of other jurisdictions (old, draw wisdom of other courts)

> Tarasoff v. Regents of Univ. of Calif., pp. 150-155\
> Issue: Duty to warn 3^rd^ party?\
> Holding: Dr. had duty to warn 3^rd^ party that his client was planning on killing him\
> reasoning: Dr. has relationship with patient that gives him duty to warn 3^rd^ party Court does a cost benefit analysis and here thinking about public interest and mandates warning client we don't have the unpredictability problem bec dr. did predict it.\
> Notes: Judge decides Duty, because if x duty then x liability.

- **Policy argument:**

  - **1) Slippery Slope- friends liable to friends who tell them things**

  - **2) confidentiality**

  - **3) deters treatment**

  - **4) false positive- if not clear- then police may harass**

- Aftermath: CA Statute is very specific about the duty, and how to discharge it- tell P/O and Victim

- Exam- apply law to facts, and Policy argument why law should be this way

[Adequacy of Warning:  Products Liability]{.underline}

Warning Defects, pp. 230-234 KA

- Transfers the risk to purchaser to decide for himself whether the risks are worth the utility

- Caveats

  - Impossible ideal

  - And some product designs remain defective even after the consumer has been fully warned about them

- 3^rd^ restatement and case law refers to "unavoidable risk" and wont impose liability for the injuries that result after an adequate warning of the risk of these injuries is given

- 2 areas of controversy:

  - 1\) adequacy of warning- ( in this way its not strict liability -- bec we assess whether it was adequate)

    - 2 problems:

      - 1\) label clutter: the more warning we put on lables, the less likely the user will digest the information. Jury decies

      - 2\) plaintiff must prove causation. There is a "heeding presumption" that says that we assume that had the plaintiff indeed received the warning he would not have taken the drug like he did. KA skeptical that this is fair, most ppl would probably still take if its prescribed and also madnadte dby school

  - 2\) the warning/design defect continuum

    - intersection between design defect and warnings law. Tension between consumer soveigny and the protective goals of tort law. And tension between trust and distrust of consumer, of market for safety, of design defect liability, and the law governing liability for injuries caused by obviously dangerous prodcuts will be unsettled.

      - most states have overturned patent danger rule= which held that maufacturers could not be held liable when defects in a products design were obvious.

        - Obrien v Muskin Corp- court held that was for the jury to decide if above ground swimming pool ws defectively designed- regardless that rsik was obvious.

          - Seems unfair if we cant balme GM for making cars without rear seat airbags ( its consumer choice)

- Defenses to products liability actions:

  - Unique one is Products Misuse:

    - Exception for foreseeable misuse- manufacturer remains liable

    - If not foreseeable then plaintiff best to bear risk of injury

    - Reasoning maybe who se best to bear the risk of injury

- Disclaimers, bystanders, and consumer sovreignity

  - Potential regime where it turns to contract law- where ur contracting the liability into the price, but what about bystanders. So therefore that didn't occur

- Federal Premption (premept= displace)

  - If conflict, federal preempts to create a ceiling on the degree of safety that state products liability law can require. Federal preemption gives manufactueres a safe harbor tha can be occupied by compliance w/ the federal standard.

  - Think about value of nationally uniform standard, federal power, and state products laibily law may affect decisions about implied promotion,

Common Knowledge and the Duty to Warn (Brown, Maneely, Emery), pp. 608-609

- Common knowledge: Don't always need warning

  - Ex brown Forman corp v Brune, the court held that no notice was required on a bottle of tequila to warn against the dangers of drinking a large quantity in a short period of time. It was obvious and warning would not have helped

  - No duty to warn about dangers of driving unrestrained in cargo bed of pickup truck...

Hood v. Ryobi America, pp. 609-612

Issue: whether the manufacturer's warning adequately conveyed the requisite information, or is it a breach of adequate warning?\
Holding: yes, adequate warned to not use the saw without the safety blades.\
Plaintiff argues that the warning wasn't adequate enough because it doesn't specify that if he removed the blade guards would permit the spinning blade to detach from the saw.\
Reasoning: the cost of extra specific warning is high (because the more u warn the less communicative the warning is) and therefore the benefit doesn't outweigh it. For breach---we're considering untaken precautions. Judge uses BPL, and says that B is so expensive, adding the warning is \$ in that it dilutes everything else. but OTH maybe cheap to only add one line, but would that be enough? (how to argue B both ways) -\
**Good Case to learn how to apply facts to breach**\
How to determine adequacy? who you're warning, what he'd expect, how its going to be perceived, and need the info to be able to make his decision\
Other side: making cost benefit analysis. so needs to know the cost, and this was an usual cost, B is small\
Policy argument: we want to discourage π from messing with tools- so leave the blame with him

Warning must be "reasonable under the circumstances"\
Notes 1 (adequacy) and 3 (Cotton, over warning), pp. 612-614 \
there **is a high information cost of over warning.** Ppl have small attention spans, and the cost is the extra time that people will need to read it which will dilute the whole message, and ppl may less read it now.

[Adequacy of Warning: Informed Consent in Medicine]{.underline}

The Duty to Disclose and Informed Consent (read through section 1), pp. 93-96 KA

- If not enough negligent or malpractice

- Disclosure and informed consent stnadards

  - Reasonable patient standard

    - Medical standards reg information disclosure may be relevant but not dispositive

    - Patient in complete control

  - Reasonable phsican standard- failure is actionable as malpractice- must prove that def phyciian failed to comply w/ standards of the profession regardin disclose of info to patinest in the plantiifss position

    - Medical profession in control

- Objective standard:Causation in informed consent cases need a but for- but could be self serving testimonhy so courts have established objective standard

  - What would objectively reasonable person w.o plaintiffs idiosyncracies done if she ahd been appropriately informed

  - This can encourage the dissemination of info to the great mass of ordinary patients.

- Semi objective standard: whether a reasonable peroin in the plaintiffs position would have declined treatment if the requisite information on risks and benefits had been disclosed

  - Idiosyncrasies relevant but her testimony is one in a larger puzzle.

  - What she says she would have done must be corroborated by past acts

  - This doctrine can protect interest of people who are not average

Reasonable Patient v Reasonable Physician Standard\
Reasonable Patient: think about who's being warned. then jury decides- good stand in for reasonable patient- would understand doctor should have done.: greater variance, more tailored, x like expert witness- dcs argue\
Reasonable Physician (D): Industry knows- maybe best judge. One size fits all.

Matsuyama v Birnbaum\
Facts: Dr. didn't order reasonable tests to R/O gastric cancer\
issue\
Holding: Can get reparations for **loss of chance of survival. "But for his negligence= he would have had increased chance of survival"\**
Reasoning: that is the injury.\
Backtrack from the all or nothing rule which doesn't deter enough and isn't fair (49%). Also, no lower of proof- still have threshold of preponderance of evidence of injury. Just the injury is the loss of chance.\
Limited to medical malpractice- where we have the statistical data of chance probability and the relationship of dr. to patient.\
Issue: what about the ppl. who ultimately live but were subject to the same exact harm., but tort law really works when injury actualy kicks in. might be reason for punitive damages.\
Ex. value of losing a lottery ticket...

# Causation:try to show π would have done differently had he had warning...

Test for causation is trying to show that π would ve done something different. its about predicting **counterfactual**- not judging behavior

Cuyler opinion\
what would the counterfactual have been- had they notified authorities? whats if it would have taken time for the investigation that even if they would have reported him he wouldn't have been arrested so could still have harmed ur child.

things to prove: they hired her afterwards, p/o would have arrested him, or argue that just the action being commenced would have provided warning, (3^rd^ party behavior productions)

Tarasoff

what if he had warned... would it have made a difference?\
ur argument would be to think about untaken precautions and to argue that it would have made a difference

### 

### Warnings:

have to prove that π would have heeded the warning

### Multiple Necessary Causes:

π would try to prove that the counter factual would be amazing

### Multiple sufficient causes- both liable 2 subsequent fires 2 mins apart. hold 1^st^ completely liable. 

Exception: pg 374- boy who falls of cliff hits EC wire, and then hits ground and dies, only charged for 2 mins.

@ same time, both liable.

Summers v. Tice, and Note 3 (Garcia), pp. 371-374

Facts: 2 hunters shot plaintiff, not sure which\
Holding: burden of proof shifted to defendant- each had to disprove that he caused the harm\
Classic case of alternative liability- each was equally likely to have harmed the plaintiff\
Precedent: Oliver v Miles\
Reasoning:1) Both negligent toward plaintiff- since they brought about this situation so its on each to absolve themselves. 2) Info Asymetry- fair, bec defendant wont give over the evidence- "Conspiracy of silence"\
Also, we're not saying he's liable- just saying the burden is on both of them to prove their innocence\
BUT: this feels more unfair then MSC bec here we know 1 didn't do it. But OTOH 50/50 is pretty close\
Issue: so then, do we extend to 5 ppl- when its only 20% chance\
Courts: reluctant to extend it with more than 3 ppl\
Hypo's: whats if 1 is negligent and 1 isnt.\
\
Old: Divided equally between all parties\
New: now divide by poproption to fault (depending on state legislature\
\
BP CASE\
BP pays most, NEg for longer, Haliburton's cement was negligent, but wasn't factually cause of the blow out, x cause in fact. BP created risk. the others just didn't reduced

Who was causal vs who deviated more from the standard. maybe sliding scale?\
1^st^ Q? was he short of reasonable care? 2^nd^ Q? did it matter?

Hymowitz v Eli Lily and CO.\
Holding: Market share liability\
Reasoning: only for sig disease, with identical products. targets national market. Def can't exculpate ( judge doesn't want to give moral luck- their actions harmed someone- so x wanna let s1 off just bec s1s mom remembered blue pill... that doesn't have anything to do w/ share of blameworthiness.\
Should we extend to non signature diseases?\
Yes- maybe loss of chance doctrine, increased in chance\
No- windfall to those who got it naturally

###  Proximate Cause/ SOL ex- ur speeding and branch hits you? liable- no, bec een though cause, aim of tort law is deterring risky behavior- and this doesn't. bec maybe he should have sped even more? Rule: **we don't hold them liable- unless we would hold it liable in the first place .** and when ur thinking about speeding -- ur not thinking about a branch hitting the car. ex- giving a kid a shot gun and then it falls on the floor and breaks his toe= not proximate cause **Harm within foreseeable risk- to P in BPL, lost chance** **Lawyer argument:** try to prove that it was one of the reasons that we had tort law, and we don't hand kids unwieldy things cause they might drop it. depends on what ur defining as negligence in the first place. Ex Richard the Hunter: Restatement § 29. the risk that makes Richard negligent for giving a child a gun is bec she might shoot someone not that she would drop it and hurt herself. so not factual cause. 

Extremely Fact intensive

NJ Law: Illustrations 7 & 8\
7, Arthur, store owner, doesn't light his parking lot. Sandy, trips, . if the FF determines that arthur's failure to light the parking lot was negligent and a factual cause of Sandy's harm then its within the scope of liability bec the risk of someone falling due to darkenss is among the risks that makes Arthur negligent for failing to light the lot in the first place\
8: same as 7, but the harm comes from a criminal who trips Sandy. Basically, Fact Finder has to assess whether this was a foreseeable risk that made Arthur's failure to provide lighting negligent bec it occurred in a gated community without any previous criminal history.\
**We can argue that he should be held liable- that he should've reasonably foreseen an increase in criminality- and that why it was made a tort.**\
use facts- we made it a gated community- that had lots of criminals, works with aims of tort law- to give incentive to think about all risks.\
\
Traditional Theory:which most courts still use: .. Does unforeseeability matter?

- unknown π? Y

- extent? N ( egg shell thin skull ( opp to contracts) its def's problem

- type? Y

- manner? N

Benn\
S1 harms him, and then injured, heart attack 6 days later he dies. How much can he sue for?\
Holding:def has to pay for everything including heart attack\
reasoning: extent doesn't have to be foreseeable. so doesn't matter that he was more susceptible to heart attack.\
ways to argue- if ur defendant's lawyer- would argue that tis actually a dif type of harm, not extent. bring in practical expert. heart is different than chest injury. dif type of harm so since wasn't foreseeable not liable.\
if your π lawyer- argue that its same type, but dif extent- and therefore doesn't matter it wasn't foreseeable. would use expert, claim that the trauma to the chest led to the heart attack and counts as same tpe of harm.\
Reasons why this is dif than contracts?\
- practicability reasons- judge doesn't have time to prove recrods that ur egg shelly ( but argu that this then puts so much pressure on directness is it type or extent?\
- deterrence- makes him likely to be more careful\
- fair 4 defendant to bear risk- he did wrong, others innocent\
Argu against: poor moral luck!- he would've gotten less if someone else

[Apportionment]{.underline}

Joint and Several Liability, pp. 137-139 KA

- When 2 or more defendants are liable for same harm, law treats them under doctrine of "joint an several liability" -- basically means entire liability- each liable as if he was sole wrongdoer. Responsible for the entire of the plaintiff's damages.

- 3 types :

  - Joint Totfeasors- when engaging in joint enterprise and one is negligent both jointly and severally liable for harm that results

  - Independent tortfeasors- single theoretically indivisible harm.

    - Ex cars crash into each other and one hits passer by.

  - Independent tortfeasors- single theoretically divisible but practically indivisible harm.

    - Ex subsequent accidents where techinlaly there is a difference but don't actually have evidence .

- Liability is apportioned among defendents. Contribution-

Basis for Comparison, Assessment, Multiple Defendants, pp. 182-186 KA

- Comparison:

  - Its comparative negligence, not comparative causation. ( but note that foreseeability probability of causing harm is a component of what it means to be negligent). Would be too hard to measure cause. We discussing cause in fact in the entirety of π harm

  - But also comparative negligence has its cons

    - How to compare? Even when same kinds of negligence? Or different

    - In ex of cars crashing going 60 mph and 90 mph, may not be simple 2x, bec synergy

  - Different when we we discussing when defendant is only cause in fact for a part of π's pain

- Assessment:

  - Deterrence Comparative c contributory negligence. One deters π more, one deters defendant more

  - Mainly fairness argument

- Application:

  - Multiple defendants ex: π 40 % neg, def a 35%, def b, 25%

    - Most states: π can recover for anything she's not principally responsible for. Yes

    - some sates: defendant should not be held liable unless she is at least as responsible as π. No

  - joint and several liability in comparative negligence cases

    - ex: π 40 % neg, def a 35%, def b, 25% Should each be responsible for their own, or be jointly and severally liable for 60 percent?

    - 3 approaches:

      - 1\) hold them jointly and severally liable for the amount of judgement ( here 60%) . but if concurrent doesn't seem fair (like π should b held as resonpibsile for one then the other defendant

      - n2) each liable for its own proportional share. If defendant insolvent, plaintiff bears

      - 3\) KA best approach. If one defendant is insolvent, then the amount left is paid by the plaintiff and other defenent in proportion to the risk they caused.

Review:  BP opinion, paragraphs 540-560 (ask yourself, "does Judge Barbier seem to be apportioning based on the parties' comparative degrees of negligence, or of causal contribution, or of some mix of the two?")

Seems to be more cause based than negligence. Lke holding bp resonspible for the other actors bec they were the end say demonstrates more causality than negligence. But hten neg when coparing bp vs transocean. Discusses how bp had more time to fix it so more negligent

55\. A related point is that BP's failures up to and including the negative pressure test created the catastrophic situation. Transocean's failures, by contrast, largely concern its inability (due in part to further failures by BP) to stop the catastrophe BP set in motion.

558 Nevertheless, because the Court ultimately finds that the unstable foamed cemen**t was not a cause of** the blowout, no legal fault is allocated to Halliburton for these failures.

560\. The Court concludes that Halliburton's conduct was negligent and that Halliburton's share of liability is considerably less than both Transocean and BP.

Almost as if to say negligent but not causing so not comparitve in this case...

Seems to be c=more cause

 

[Market Share Liability]{.underline}

Market Share Liability, pp. 143-146 KA

- Sindell v Abot Laboratories: Daughters sue for moms taking DES caused injury to fetus..., court allowed even though couldn't identify the specific manufacturer each's mom took.

  - Once clear that defedent's injured some of the π's def. shouldn't escape liability just bec π can't show which defenent injured which π.

  - Holding: placed liability based on market share

- But

  - Only works for signature disease. Which is unlikely. Lots of times other thigns could cause it. here we had 100 percent caused 100 percent

  - The same toxic substances are not nec chemically identical

    - Skipworth v lead industries -- dif paint pigments had dif chemical formulas and no liability bec dif manufactueres did not nec cause harm in porprotion ot hteir markey share.

  - Markey share data availaibilty

  - Also feasibility of suing all defendents- so then not fair for 80% to have to take responsibility for 100%: called relative market share. So instead can use absolute markey share- only liably for their actual market share

[Proximate Cause, a.k.a. Scope of Liability --- The Basics]{.underline}

 

Introduction and Basics, pp. 149-154 KA in Abraham

- More closely related to breach and negligence than to cause in fact

- Foreseeabilty test: to determine proximate cause we see if causing that harm was a foreseeable result of acting as the defendant did.

  - It's whether the harm to the particular π was a foreseeable result of the defendants negligence

- We clarify the foreseeability test with the Harm-within- the-risk-test: is the risk of the injury the plaintiff suffered one of the risks that makes the defendant negligent for blocking access to the fire hydrant.

  - Ex of man who skids out of control and hits car illegly parked at hydrant.

    - No. not more risk. He could have hit that car parked not at a pump.

  - *This is not the risk the def has to take into account when deciding to park at a hydrant*

- Statute Confusing because there is multiple factors to take into account when someones doing something wrong.

- In Wagner v international Railway Co. determined that the harm caused to π in trying to rescue the friend who fell out of the car due to def's negligence in leaving car door open was in proximate cause. "**danger invites rescue"**

- S/t even without these tests there's liability

 

Berry v. Sugar Notch, on CourseWorks

- Facts: π speeding his train, and tree falls on him. He sues for recovery.

[Foreseeability vs. Harm Within the Risk]{.underline}

 

What Must Be Foreseeable, pp. 159-170 in Abraham

4 types of unforeseeability:

1.  Unforeseeable π

    a.  Palsgraf v Long Island: case about railroad employee helping passenger onto train who drops his package w/ fireworks inside.

        i.  Issue: could case even go to Jury

        ii. Holding: Cordozo no, bec nothing to do w/ proximate cause- he said more about duty which is matter of law. So no jury.

        iii. But maye Cardozo is saying that there is duty to Ms. Paslgraf but that they didn't breach the duty bec her harm was not foreseeable

        iv. Dissent: Andrews: wasnted to take factors of proximate cause into account. Claimed that foreseeability was more malleable than C believed.

        v.  2 issues here: 1) whether the issue was breach of duty or proximate cause, and whether he issue should go to the jury

    b.  Reasons to hold def liable in this case: railroad in better position to build into its decisions the risk of being liable for π it can't foresee.

        i.  Slippery slope though.

    c.  Reasons against: it wont incentivize more care bec they don't know how their conduct will risk harm to unforeseeable π and are not at fault for fialing to consider the risk their conduct poses to unforeseeable plaintiffs.

2.  Unforeseeable extent of harm

    a.  Doesn't matter, unforeseeablitily to egg shell victim is still included. "take ur victim as u find him"

    b.  Why treated differently?

        i.  Would be to hard to make plaintiffs prove that his injury was "normal"

        ii. Justice Argument: As between the 2 more fair to let def bear the risk that his neg. caused more harm than foreseeable rathe than the innocent π.

        iii. May promote optimal deterrence: it was calculable somewhat satistically there was a small chance something would hapene foreseeable plaitnifs with unforeseeable vulnerability are already in sight. And statically every person is a spectrum.

        iv. But still a π may ve contributorily negligent or fail to mitigate his damages afer injury

3.  Unforeseeable types of harm

    a.  Used directness test. But ahs faded. Overruled in the wagon mound

        a.  Held not liabe

        b.  Reasoning: no point in ho lding a def laible for anything unforeseeable.

        c.  Subsequent: courts read it that unforeseabel type of harm no go but unforeseeable etent like egg shell plaintiff still go.

    b.  Today its really case by case bassis

        i.  Fa**ctors to think about is:**

            1.  **Directness of harm, degree to whiti it more closely resembles an unforeeable type of hrma than an extent of the same harm that was forseeable**

4.  Unforeseeable manner of harm

    a.  Can still recover. Unless its so extraordinary.

1 matters a lot. 2 and 4 not so much, and 3 depends

sometimes 3 and 4 are mixed up, and sometimes 2 and 3 are mixed up

 

Benn v. Thomas, pp. 395-398                                              

 

Remoteness, Intervention and Enablement, pp. 154-159 KA 

Directness, remoteness considered but not dispositve. More likemeans it was more foreseabl. E

Intervention think factors like moral blame, how foreseeable to the def injury to parites in the plaitnif position is.

Yes can hold first actor to be a prox cause for enabling second actor to harm. But what about if first actor 's nelgigen placed palintifi in positon ot be ninured by second dactor?

[Proximate Cause or "Duty"? --- Palsgraf]{.underline}

 

Palsgraf v. LIRR, pp. 421-430

**Π has to show a wrong to herself, not a wrong to someone. Driving recklessly is negligent to all because its within the range of apprehension.**

 "the risk reasonly to be perceid tdefines the dyty to be obeyed. Andr rsik improts relation.

Negligence imports violation of right- the right to be protected againt inerferene w/ bodily security. But its not porteted against all fronts

Holdig: No liablity, bec no wrong.

. H

Dissent: Andrews: negligence wehether damages does or doesn't result

Ex. Children can revocer for negligent killing fo father. Even though no duty... Cites Polemis case as precedent. He thinks Coordozo wrong, the line to arbitrary. Who cares that the negligent person though the scope of his harm was limited.

He suggests we take into account factor of what the prudent would foresee as the line, instead of what the defendant had reason to believe

How to kick people out of liability?

1)  **Proximate cause/Scope of liability (most courts)more about breach than causation**

2)  saying there's no duty- cordozo- palsgraf. trying ot capture common sense.

Traditional: foreseeability, π, extent, type, manner

Modern: HWR, Restatement 3^rd^. HNFIR. "it doesn't fall into what we call A tort in the first place.

Ex- grocery store that doest have light on in parking lot. and theif attacks..

if u cut off called "superseding" ex- the thief is own agent and is superseding.

if u keep called "intervening" ex- say the whole point of keeping lite is so someone doesn't get beaten up in the dark, then your liable and its called intervening.

PSALGRAF:

facts: suing for negligence./ the jostle caused the explosion. it was but for causation.

Dissent: Andrews realist- its line drawing. we have to cut it somewhere. Fact intensive, lots of factors, direct? foreseeable? paragraph 2 on page 425. He's serving the problems. is it neg about what u did? or your relationship.\
COrdozo- majority. **relational Concept** set up facts so the connection between pack and lady is so far. Neg is in relation to a particular person. Yes, he was negligent, but x mean they were negligent ot her. we don't have realtion to her. not enough to just do something negligent.

Think: moral luck about 2 person speeding but only one hits person:

driving fast, and person drives off bec of of it and gets into freak accident

Andrews- Probs yes, anything that is the cause of your negligence, your potentially on the hook for. "\
Cordozo- no duty with that person, no relationship

Andrews perspective. 2 step approach: 1) Negligent? 2) then can cut off by proximate cause which includes common sense.

Cardozo Perspective: 1 Step. U never had duty in 1^st^ place. takes foreseabiltiy a **part of breach of duty analysis**. (which is built in) so x nee d lab cutting tool bec automatically in negligence is foreseeability. Duty- maybe emphasizing he wants jduges to decide this.

Breach of duty- judge decides. proximate cause- jury decides. (judge is cleaner?.)

2 philosphies- about how to work with these concepts. but where were we today.

traditional- maybe foreseeable π, kick out unforeseeable π, but Andres is basic description what traditioanla analysis is. common sense of jury- realist view. practical politics. expediency.

Modern Restatement- (not all courts on board) ahrm within foreseeable risk increase- we cut off liability when its not within what would make it torture. like andres approach in the second step in which u cut off liability when assessing scope of liability sol.\
Seems to be the ost like Cordozo- defining negligence in ist place. maybe reastement getting ride of proximate clause- abandoning Andrew's second step and leaving it to definition of negligence Seems like Cordozo wins in modern Restatement

Today- all jumbled mess, all going out of CS to kick people out of liability.

#### "No Duty" Ways of Cutting off Liability 

 

[532 Madison Ave](https://maps.google.com/?q=532+Madison+Ave&entry=gmail&source=g). v. Finlandia, pp. 319-324

Facts: Building collapses- public nuisance. cordon off a big part of it for 42 weeks. Owners of surrounding businesses sue bec lose of business due to cordoning off.\
**Holding: limited liability to economic loss that comes with physical harm. no duty for purely economic loss.**\
Reasoning: Cites FMC case. FMC has explosion that does physical damage to Dunlop and calso causes some harm to Chevy thru power loss ut no physical harm. they both sue for loss of profit. But only Dunlop was allowed to gain, because he suffered physical damage and then door was open and then he was also able to gain from financial damage. but Chevy got nothing. Court does same thing here. this seems arbitrary. seems interesting line drawing. why couldn't court just limit it to how long they were roped off for...\
Also cites Milken case- have to have contractual relationship for cause of action- otherwise nothing. Here court used contract as line drawing mechanism. ( we use also foreseeability)

What else can we use to draw lines? How much ur revenue dropped (implementable, not too much proof required), type of business ( ex if its Christmas time and its seasonal store), their own ability to distribute the loss, couldv'e limited it to the 2 wks that there was actual courting it off, or u can say "everyone whose within the cordoning off- during the cordoning off can get \$,

Strict Liability.

KA 197-212

2 types of strict liability- imposed without regard to the negligence of the defendent 1) abnormally dangerous activites 2) vicarious liability

Why strict liability? What can be gained by imposing an additional increment of liability?

1)  Reducing information cost and error. Costly to determine negligence (negligence is more fact intensive) And less likely error bec for negligence have to prove more nuanced things

    a.  Bear in mind- that we not have increased litigation bec its easier. So factor those costs

    b.  Specturm. The more general the role the cheaper the standard

2)  Influencing activity level and research decisions

    a.  Will it impose additional safety? Unlikely to be true if negligence lability is imposed correctly.

    b.  Also people act in their self interest- so they will still do the at if avoidance costs are cheaper than accident costs- so it is cheaper to continue causeing these accidentse and just paying

    c.  **But incentive for additional research. Because under strict liability there is more to be gained by avoiding liability**

    d.  We can look at this as strict liability or when no then strict liability to victim

3)  Promoting insurance of Braod Distribution of Losses

    a.  We impose strict liablity when a particular catergory of injureres is likely in general to be better insurers of theses costs

    b.  Factors are knowledge of the nature and probabilty of the risks posed by the activity.

    c.  In general injureres are more likely than victims to be large instuttions that can spread the cost of liability directly in the cost of their prices or services

    d.  BuT- injureres are not nec superior than victims to distribute loss

        i.  i.e. most victims have insurance

4)  Satisfying rights based norms of responsibility

    a.  Benefit theory Injureres benefit from the activites so should pay

    b.  Reciprocity theory- when an activity poses risks for potential victims that the victims do not also pose for others

    c.  Libertarian- liability should be imposed when an injurer acts in a manner that causes the invasion of the liberty of others.

Specific Doctrins of Traditional strict liability

A.  The rise of liablity fo rultrahazardous activites

    a.  Court decided categories not jury.

    b.  Licestock,

    c.  Factors: degree of danger, and how common it was in the aresa.

    d.  Reason- more dangerous-likely more violent, and more likely loss of evidence. Also since its uncommon the incentive of added reaserch will likely operate on potential injureres

        i.  If uncomomon potetnail victims wont know enough to take precutions

B.  The modern conception- strict liabliy or abnormally dangerous activies

    a.  Dangerness Degree of risk , probability of harm, and inability to eliminate the risk by the exercise of reasonable care

    b.  Commonness- exten to which the acivit is uncommon and its inappropriateness to the area

    c.  Exten to which the value of the activity to the community outweighed its dangerousness

    d.  -\_ more complicated.

Indiana Harbor Belt RR CO v American Cynamid Co.

Holding: No strict liability for 2 reasons. 1) leaks don't destroy evidence of negligence 2) impossibility of SL having an activity level effect in this case

Precedent paradigmatic case Guile v Swan balloonist is sued for landing on vegetable land, where ltos of ppl rescued him and trampled owner's vegtables.

Holding: libale, even though not negligent, was impossible for balloonist to make a pinpoint landing

Discusses the 6 factors, and explains.\
s/t when an accident can't be prevented we impose strict liability to incentivize him to experiment and search for ways to reduce the activity giving rise to the accident

The material is dangerous but to impose strict liability on the shipper so sweeping.

This accident was caused by lack of care- which can be deffered in a negligence regime

C.  scope of liability and defenses

Coparitive negligence as a defense to strict liability. Depends on your reason for comparative negligence?

2.22.2018

Intentional torts- trespass

Martin v Reynolds metals co

Holding: It is Trespass.

Rule for trespass is that don't need actual damage so long as it affects interest.

Consequential damages are direct enough for trespass.

Trespass is SL in the sense that def's motivation is irrelevant

Property Torts

Trespass: actionable w/o proof of actual damage.\
conversion- unauthorized transfer of personal property to 3^rd^ parties possession.

Property is more than \$\<

Defenses:

Necessity- harm not created by π

Public necessity no liablity for damage

Private necessity- liability for damage

Self defense- harm by π

Private Necessity Ploof v Putnam

There is a privilege of necessity- to use another's property

∆ untied s1 else's boat on his own dock

Holding: damages to π bec defendant cut loose the sloop which resulted in battering π's boat

Vincent v Lake Erie Transportaiton Co.

Issue: is necessity an incomplete privilege meaning that one only has right to s/1 else's property on condition that he pays consequential damage

Facts: Steamship, Reynolds, was docked on π's dock when storm hit, and the boat kept hitting the dock causing 500\$ of damage

Holding: Still have to pay damages.

Reasoning: starving man may steal bread, but when he can has to pay back. Bec the injury was one where the ∆ prudently and advisedly availed itself of the π property. It was their direct efforts that put her in position to damage the π's dock.

There would be no liability- if it was unavoidable accident, or act of g-d

KA: Thoughts: moral responsibility?

Here dif than bread bec its not about paying rent but damage. law doesn't look at Distinction between intending harm and risking harm Def in Vincent didn't choose to damage the dock, but risked damaging it

Interesting bec. we're usually only held liable for damage that acuta. Ex driving to work always low risk tires gonna blow. Maybe dif was extent of risk. lly occurs through negligence

Potential solution: one whom nature put at risk should bear the cost of saving himself. But maybe they both ade choices that put them at risk. Dock owner had chose to have dock where ships tie up.

Interesting discussion that the scope of the dockowners property rights does not determine liability rule, rather the appropriate tort liablity rule determines the scope for the dockowners property rights.

Vincent encourages- dockowner to permit the shipowenr to staty tied up a nd not behave like ploof dockowner. , and ship owner has incentive to compare the risk of staying moored to leaving

Note 13: Calebresie and melamed:

Property Rule: person who wants the entitlement must purchase it as price determined by holder

Entitlement to non polluter- Injunctions for nuisance, and then polluter had to purchase from u

Entitlement to polluter- i.e. no lability for pollution damage

Liability rule- - when can purchase at objectively determined price (like damages by court)

entitlement to non polluter (π) Ex Boomer- ∆ polluter can continue to pollute as long as damages are paid to satisfy the entitlement

Entitlement to polluter (∆) protected by a liability rule. Ex Spur industries which owned cattle. Bec of coming to the nuisance= π had to indemnify spur for the cost of moving.

Nuisance, as a substantial and unreasonable interference w/ the use or enjoyment of land. Live and let live. Judgement call. Court balnaces the equities

1)  pay and enjoin

2)  pay and let continue

    a.  boomer- bec cost of discontinuing was grossly dispropritionate to the amount of harm. Equity balancing

<!-- -->

1)  no nuisance- def enjoins plaintiff. As in enjoined from enjoying peacefully

    a.  Court denies remedy

2)  Nuisance: plaintiff enjoins defendant

    a.  Traditional. . but π can still sell the right to defendant (holdout). Or could be ignored.

3)  Nuisance- def compensates plaintiff

    a.  Damages not injunction

4)  Nuisance- plaintiff compensates defendant.

    a.  Π should be entitled to stop the nuisance only if tis worth it to them- so therefore has to coempensate the def.

        i.  Ex spur

Damages

3 funcitoins

1)  achieving corrective justice or providing cili recouse by compesting th e plaintiff for losses resulting form the defendant's tortious act

2)  promoting deterreng by threating potential futre defendets with liabity fo rhte costs fomr the acts

3)  recognizing the social and individual signicane of the π's loss and confiming the weight of the defenent's responsibility of it

[STRICT laiblity v negligence for self driing cars]{.mark}

[Because a negligence standard might make it too expensive for crash victims to obtain justice and a strict liability standard might discourage companies from putting HAVs on the road, some people are contemplating other, less traditional methods for handling HAV tort liability. "Perhaps the creation of a no-fault system would be best, funded by buyers of autonomous vehicles or by a percentage of state motor vehicle fees," Rafferty says.]{.mark}

[A similar no-fault system was created to protect another socially beneficial product. "Vaccines made people safer, but there was great liability when something went wrong, so we had to change the liability regime," Marchant says.]{.mark}

[In 1986, Congress required vaccine-makers---in exchange for legal protections---to contribute to a no-fault compensation fund. Sufferers go before special vaccine courts that can't award punitive dam-ages, only compensation. "They may need to set up something like that for driverless cars," Marchant says.]{.mark}

[By earnings: Sept 11 article. The fund is going to pay people based on income potential. But how do we know that the janitor wouldn't have gone to law school, and how can we measure worth of life. Also gives money for having children, but maybe her parents were dependent on her. Proposal- to pay everyone evenly]{.mark}

[By race and gender- bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced fair calculations act (Bill) to stop the rampant use of racial and gender income averages in determining these damages- which lead to minorities and women receiving much less compensation.]{.mark}

[Facts: Seffert sued LA transit line for closing the door on her, dragging her, and then throwing her to the pavement. ∆ appealing the excessiveness of damages]{.mark}

[Holding: not excessive,]{.mark}

[Reasoning: that is for the jury to decide as it's a fact question. An appeals court would only overrule if it was thought to be a result of passion or prejudice from the jurors.]{.mark}

[Pure Emotional Loss]{.mark}

[Only limited duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid causing emotional distress.]{.mark}

[2 categories liability may be imposed 1) independent duty 2) derivative duty- failure to exercise reasonable causer to avoid causing physical injury does not result in physical injury the π but does cause emotional distress]{.mark}

[Reasons why not: 1) floodgate of litigation 2) it would require the development of standards of reasonable care that do not yet exist 3) we are better off devoting the finite sum of money of compensation to those that suffered physical injury]{.mark}

[Equipose Effect By Huang]{.mark}

[Disgorgement- repayment of ill-gotten gains that is imposed on wrongdoers by the courts.]{.mark}

- [Disgorgement doesn't force the liable actor to take a loss, it allows him to break even. Puts him in a state of equipoise\
  theory- substituting disgorgement for any other remedy, part of the time, can emulate the incentive effect of using that remedy all the time.]{.mark}

- [This is helpful especially when harms can be hard to measure.]{.mark}

[Concurrent Damages by Huang]{.mark}

[There is diminishing marginal harm- bec further break in yield less new information, but the compensation doesn't get leveled off]{.mark}

[Article explores the possibility of allowing courts to run civil damages awards concurrently- which is giving the judge the option of grouping or collapsing nominal awards]{.mark}

[The linear approach- counts up all violations and hten imposes a set penalty for each. Makes sense when harm is linear. Its inflexible. Can over deter as well as under deter. Also can result in arbitray outcomes for victims seeking compensation- ex contractor case- whats if he billed 2x a year, 10x's a year... 100x's a year. But really based on one single underlying contract.]{.mark}

Class Actions

Walmart v Dukes

Facts: Walmart gives supervisors large discretion in personnel decisions, uncontrolled by formal standards

Rule 23(a) (2) 4 requirements:

1)  Numerosity 2) commonality 3) typicality 4) adequate representation

Issue: does this satisfy rule 23 in commonality "questions of law and fact common the class"

That means that the π has to demonstrate that the class members "*have suffered the same injury"*- the important part is more if the classwide suit can **generate common *answers* to drive the resolution of the litigation.** Its not enough for multiple ppl to be alleging a Title 7 injury-need a common contention *capable of classwide resolution*. More than pleading standard- must affirmatively demonstrate compliance w rule. Analysis it first

Doesn't think that the case will provide a common answer the crucial question- of why was I disfavored

Holding: + claim for backpay improperly certified

Rule 23(b)(2) allows class treatment when "the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole."

Monetary relief may not be certified under 23(b) (2) at least not here where the monetary relief is not incidental to the injunctive or declaratory relief

KEY : For 23 b 2 only apply when that injunctive or declaratory judgement would provide relief to each member fo the class. It doesn't authorize class certification when each indicidual class member would be entitled to a different injunction or declaratory judement against the defendant. Also, doesn't authorize when each class member would be entitled to an individualized award of monetary damages.

Holding: these individualized monetary claims belong in rule 23(b) **(3)-** allows for class certification more broadly but w/ more procedural protections- like predominance, superiority, mandatory notice, and right to opt out. Rule 23 b **3 prereq** "the q of law or fact common to class members *predominate*

For class 23 b **2** don't need to give notice and opt out rihts- bec it is thought that notice has no purpose when the class is mandatory- and doesn't violate due process. But in context of money damages it would be a violation of due process

Dissent: Ginsburg: can study under dispate impact approach. Thinks there is key dispute common to the class -- whether Wal-marts discretioanyr pay and promoting policies are discriminatory. Doesn't like the majority's dissimilarities approach- where they focus on what distinguishes individual class members instad of whats common to them. Instad they should focus on the general policy of wamart to give discretion that is causing gender inequality delegated discretion is a practice actionable under title 7 when it produces discriminatory outcomes

Class Actions- applin Rule 23

Parko v Shell

Facts: class of property owners in Roxana, Illinois against shell oil company who operated an oil refinery adjacent ot htier village, and against Conoco phillips-. Bec of leaked benzene and other contimantinat into the groundwater under the members' homes

Holding: certification as class action reversed

How to determine predominance?

Qualitative concept- tests whether propsed classes are sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation. Its more than a pleading standard- court must receive evidence

Compare to *mejdrech v metcoil systems corp.­* court approed class action. It involved class of homeowners who were compaling about contamination of groundwarer caused by TCE- leaked by a nearby storage container. The questions whether met-coil leaked TCE in violation of law and whether the TCE reached the soil and groundwater beneath the homes of the class members are common to the class.

But here- there is more than one source of pollution, here π x present any theory of a connection between the leks property values or between specific ∆ and the leaks and property values to justify class action- of all those whose property sits on top the ground water

The court does not require the district judge to determine whether each member of the class has sustained injury- would be like requrieign a precase before every case

Class Actions- the lower courts responses

Defense side view ere is,

however, a growing trend that impacts this delicate balance and is changing how many class actions are litigated, and the tactics and strategies employed by all parties. Plaintiffs, and some courts, have increasingly pointed to Rule 23(c)(4)^1^ to certify what are called "limited issue" classes.  Rule 23(c)(4) provides that, "when appropriate, an action may be brought or maintained as a class action with respect to particular issues."^2^  Limited issue certification under this Rule seeks to isolate an issue (or certain issues) for class treatment even if class members' claim for liability or recovery might ultimately be adjudicated individually.  The separation of individual issues not capable of class-wide resolution allows a class action to move forward even when it would not survive examination under the mandate of Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance test^3^ -- which requires common issues in the class action as a whole to predominate over issues that would require individualized adjudication.^4^

Consumer Class Defense Counsel:

- Challenging limited issue class actions

- "blackmail settlements" even defendants w/ meritorious claims feel compelled to settle bec are afraid of the enormous threat of liability of a class action
