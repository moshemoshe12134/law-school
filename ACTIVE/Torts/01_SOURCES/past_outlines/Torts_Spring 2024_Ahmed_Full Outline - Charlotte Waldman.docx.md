# Introduction: What is Tort Law? 

## Introduction 

[Common law of civil wrongs not arising from contract -- *law of accidents*]{.underline}

- Contracts = legally enforceable agreements

  - Torts is about who pays when shit hits the fan

  - The duties we owe each other as people

  - Allocation of risk in a community (*But who is the community? Which risks matter? Why do we have these duties --fundamental respect, efficient ways to organize social welfare, etc.?)*

- Torts is [private law]{.underline}

  - Private law governs relations between private individuals (contracts/property/torts); public law governs individuals and the state (Constitutional law, election law, etc.)

- [Civil wrongs]{.underline}

  - Different levels of procedural protections -- criminal proceedings are much more highly protected (going to prison vs. paying monetary damages)

  - Wrongfulness -- someone is to blame, and they should pay for it

    1.  Latin root of "tort": To bend, to twist (as in "torture")

- [Tort law is based on the common law]{.underline}

  - The common law = judge-made law (like Property -- driven by cases, rooted in precedents)

  - Restatements: Not law, but should be treated as canonical definitions (effectively function as law)

- [Tort law speaks in general principles, rather than specific rules]{.underline}

  - Standards govern: "The reasonable person"

  - There is no national system of tort law -- it is only jurisdiction by jurisdiction

  - Many goals that may be in tension with each other

    1.  *DETERRING ACCIDENTS -- we want people to behave responsibly (wet floor signs, etc.)*

    2.  *CONSTRUCTING AND EXPRESSING COMMUNITY NORMS -- the duties that we think we owe to each other (aka the "duty of reasonable care") is an expression of communal norms*

    3.  *CORRECTING INJUSTICE -- tort law is corrective justice for someone who had a wrong done and needs to be made whole (criminal law is retributive justice; tax law is distributive justice)*

    4.  *ALLOCATION OF SOCIETAL RESOURCES*

- DUTY/BREACH/CAUSATION/DAMAGES

  - Intentional Torts: Focus is on breach

- Tort law: How to allocate responsibility and risk

# Liability for Intentionally Inflicted Harms 

- When should a defendant be liable for harm? Three scenarios.

  - *1. **INTENTIONAL TORTS:***

    1.  *INSTANCES WHEN THE DEFENDANT ACTED INTENTIONALLY (& THAT INTENTION IS THE BASIS FOR LIABILITY)*

  - *2. **NEGLIGENCE:***

    1.  *INSTANCES WHEN THE DEFENDANT ACTED CARELESSLY (& THAT IS THE BASIS FOR LIABILITY)*

  - *3. **STRICT LIABILITY:***

    1.  *INSTANCES WHEN THE DEFENDANT IS DOING AN INTRINSICALLY HAZARDOUS ACTIVITY (& THAT IS THE BASIS FOR LIABILITY)*

- What types of plaintiff's interests should the law protect?

  - Harms to physical and emotional well-being: Dignity, enjoyment of property, freedom of movement, etc. 🡪 Fraught normative spheres

  - Whether the plaintiff's conduct should lessen or limit the defendant's liability (Contributory negligence; assumption of risk)

## Intentional Torts 

### Harmful Battery (§13)

#### Vosburg v. Putney (Wis. 1891)

+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Topic**        | **INTENT FOR BATTERY:** What is the distinction between the intent to act (which causes harm), and the intent *to cause harm?*                                                                                           |
+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Case**         | ***VOSBURG V. PUTNEY** --* 50 N.W. 403 (Wis. 1891)                                                                                                                                                                       |
+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Facts**        | - D Putney (11) kicked P Vosburg (14) below the knee while sitting in class                                                                                                                                              |
|                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|                  | - Touch was slight, but after a short delay, it seemed to cause violent pain. Kick resulted in vomiting and destruction of bone, and Plaintiff will never be able to use limb again.                                     |
|                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|                  | - Plaintiff had previously injured leg (although it had nearly healed), and in general seems to have been uniquely fragile.                                                                                              |
+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Holding**      | - **Intent to harm is not necessary for a battery.**                                                                                                                                                                     |
|                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|                  | - Intent for battery: **Intent to do something unlawful is unlawful intent**                                                                                                                                             |
|                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|                  |   - If the kicking was an unlawful act, then the intention was also unlawful                                                                                                                                             |
|                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|                  |     - On a playground, there is an "implied license"                                                                                                                                                                     |
|                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|                  |     - In the classroom, the teacher had already "called to order" -- created different norms **🡪** the kick was violation of the norms                                                                                   |
|                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|                  | - Damages: liable for all injuries resulting from wrongful act, regardless of foreseeability or proportionality                                                                                                          |
+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Reasoning**    | - Kicking someone during class ≠ school decorum → unlawful                                                                                                                                                               |

|                  | - Intending to do something unlawful makes the intention necessarily unlawful                                                                                                                                            |

|                  | - Unlawful intent + contact + harm = battery → liable for *all* damages                                                                                                                                                  |
+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **DAMAGES RULE** | **Eggshell Skull Rule:** A defendant takes a plaintiff as they find them. The tortfeaser is liable for [all]{.underline} injuries resulting directly from wrongful act, regardless of foreseeability or proportionality. |
|                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|                  | - (E.g., if a defendant intentionally smacks the plaintiff's hand, and then plaintiff turns out to be a world-class violin player, the defendant is still liable for all the damages.)                                   |

***FISHER V. CARROUSEL MOTOR HOTEL, INC.** -- 424 S.W.2d. 627 (Tex.**1967)***

| **Facts**     | - Fisher, a NASA mathematician, was invited to attend a work function at the Carrousel Motor Hotel. Luncheon part of the event was held in the hotel's restaurant, the Brass Ring Club. As Fisher was about to be served at the lunch buffet, the manager of the club, Flynn, approached Fisher, snatched the plate from his hand, and shouted that he could not be served because he was an African American. |

#### Assault

##### De S. & Wife v. W. De S. Assizes -- 

> *1348 or 1349 (English case)*

+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Facts**     | - I. de S. and Wife owned a tavern. W. de S. went to the tavern to buy wine, but it was closed. He then struck the tavern door with a hatchet.                                             |
|               |                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|               | - Wife stuck her head out the window and told W. de S. to stop. W. de S. saw Wife, and then struck the hatchet again, but did not touch Wife. I. de S. and Wife sued W. de S. for assault. |
+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Holding**   | - A threatening act, even when no physical contact is made, causes enough harm to be considered a trespass on a person                                                                     |
+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Reasoning** | - It's clear what W. de S. was trying to do when he waved his hatchet around                                                                                                               |

|               | - Even though no harm actually occurred, causing someone to apprehend for their life is sufficient to be a trespass on a purpose                                                           |

##### Speicher v. Ratjora 

*766 N.W.2d 649 (Iowa App. 2009)*

+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Facts**     | - D = Rajtora; P = Speicher, the mother of his 8-year-old                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

|               | - daughter. D dropped daughter off with P (didn't see him then).                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

|               | - P called D to tell him not to allow the daughter to take the phone to church or school. In response, D allegedly said "Shut the f\* \* \* up. Don't worry about it and shut the f\* \* \* up before I come over there and beat both your asses" from his friend's house 1-2 miles away. |
|               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|               | - P filed suit, not seeking monetary compensation for an injury, but rather a protective order (must establish assault to get protective order in Iowa). DC found assault + issued the protective order, D appealed.                                                                      |
+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Holding**   | - Assault requires "fear of immediate physical contact" coupled with the "apparent ability to execute" the assault.                                                                                                                                                                       |
+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Reasoning** | - Assault not established because he didn't have the apparent ability to execute the assault -- he was a few miles away                                                                                                                                                                   |
+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Notes**     | Standard for imminence is pretty high here, makes it hard to constitute assault                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Wal Mart Stores***                                | No false imprisonment where Wal-Mart imprisoned its undocumented immigrant janitors by locking them into its stores during the janitors' shifts. The tort of false imprisonment requires that a person be constrained by force or threat of force. Threats may take the form of conduct or words. The harm feared must be of actual force, not just emotional, such as humiliation or loss of a job.  |

***GTE SOUTHWEST v. BRUCE** -- 998 S.W.2d 605 (Tex. 1999)*

- Not enough that defendant acted with intent that was tortious, criminal, or intended to inflict emotional distress, or even conduct with malice*→ needs to be so outrageous in character, so extreme, to go beyond all possible bounds of decency to be regarded as so atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community*

- If the person doing the conduct is aware of a person being peculiarly susceptible to emotional distress by reason of some physical or mental condition or peculiarity. Conduct may become outrageous when an actor proceeds in face of such knowledge, where it would not be if he did not know *→ Conduct can be outrageous* in virtue *of P's sensitivities + D's knowledge of them*

***Note:*** IIED threshold is hard to satisfy, and demonstrating emotional distress suffered is hard (some people respond to trauma by being high functioning, especially after sexual assault)

#### Trespass to Chattel

→ NOTE KEY DIFFERENCE WITH TRESPASS TO REAL LAND: HARM REQUIREMENT

- If accidentally using someone else's stuff didn't require damage, it would be a shit show.

[RST on Chattel]{.underline}

- "intentionally dispossessing another of the chattel or using or intermeddling with a chattel in the possession of another

  - Intentional interference with *physical property* (as opposed to real property or land)

  - Unlike trespass to land, requires there to be a chattel-related harm

    - Do not need to intend the damages, but **they do need to exist** (not just violation on the will like trespass to land)

## Affirmative Defenses to Intentional Torts ("Even if I did it, I still shouldn't be held liable") 

1.  Think about the tort

2.  THEN raise the defense

The gun was literally a secret trap gun (no warning of security system in place) and it was pointed down, at leg-level. Plaintiff broke in and was shot in the leg. **Court holds D liable in consequential AND punitive damages.** |

| **[Facts:]{.underline}** D separates fighting dogs with a stick. Goes behind shoulder with stick and accidentally hits P in the eye, who sues for assault and battery.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | **Facts:** D constructed a reservoir on land he used to help power his mill, not knowing he was above old coal mines, though he had found old mine shafts filled up. When the area was filled with water, it burst into the shafts and P\'s mine was flooded -- since D was not negligent, P sued for trespass.     |

Another member of this 3-judge panel made it clear that he did *not* think that the findings were clearly erroneous. An appeals court has much more discretion on findings of LAW. But Judge Hand was convinced that the Bargee was negligent. How to get around this precedent?       |

It should induce rational decision-makers to take into account the costs their behavior poses to others and to take all precautions that are socially worthwhile in the sense that their social benefits exceed their social costs.                                                                                           |

| X is a passenger in my car and I am driving. Y is a pedestrian entering the crosswalk. X can tell that I don't know that Y is crossing the road. With a mere word, passenger X could direct my attention to Y and keep me from hitting him. X does not, and Y is injured when he jumps away from my vehicle. **Could Y sustain a negligence claim against passenger X?**    | - NO. No special relationship, so X is not subject to liability even though X knew of the danger to Y and knew that I was not paying attention. |

To hold a manufacturer liable for a risk that was not foreseeable when the product was marketed might foster increased manufacturer investment in safety. But such investment by definition would be a matter of guesswork. |

|              1.  E.g., tube of mascara that being of a manufacturing defect has an applicator that is too sharp. If the purchaser uses it as a weapon and stabs someone, should the person who has been stabbed be able to sue the manufacturer? No, defect in the production of the mascara leads to a mismatch in type of harm. Would expect cuts on eye by person trying to use it as mascara; would not expect stabbing. |
