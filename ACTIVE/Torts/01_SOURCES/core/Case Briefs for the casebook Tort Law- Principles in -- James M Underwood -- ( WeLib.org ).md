PREFACE

Allow me to briefly summarize some features of this third edition that
I believe make it unique:

long  as  I  practiced

What’s  in  a  name?  The  title  “Torts:  Principles  in  Practices”
captures  my  belief  that  the  supposed  divide  between  legal
theory and legal practice is a false dichotomy. I have now taught
for  nearly  as
law.  One  cannot  truly
understand how to apply the law solely based upon memorizing
numerous  black-letter  legal  rules.  Circumstances  are  too  varied
and  rules  of  law  too  ambiguous  and  conflicting  to  permit  such
ease  of  application.  It  is  deep  understanding  and  appreciation
for the principles that permits a practitioner to represent clients
in  tort  cases  effectively.  This  book  approaches  the  subject  of
Torts with a view toward capturing the spirit of the law of Torts
at  the  dual  levels  of  both  its  lofty  principles  and  its  actual
implementation  on  the  ground.  To  stay  consistent  with  this
theme,  the  book
labeled  either
“Principles”  or  “In  Practice”  to  supplement  the  material  in  the
cases. The trend at many law schools is to increasingly focus on
preparing students for practice. This book is designed to assist
in those efforts.
Vibrant mix of cases. I love many of the old classic cases and a
student of Tort law would be considered illiterate without some
familiarity  with  these  cases.  This  book  retains  many  of  the  old
standards.  The  book  also  adds  many  modern  cases
in
contemporary  factual  circumstances  so  that  students  can
appreciate how nimbly the law can be applied to new situations.
For  example,  I  have  included  a  recent  case  arising  out  of  the

is  ﬁlled  with  textboxes

they

represent

2016  presidential  election  where  a  court  analyzes  whether  a
Trump  supporter  committed  a  battery  against  a  critic  by
intentionally  inducing  a  seizure  via  a  flashing  light  in  a  Twitter
message.  Another  example  involves  a  2021  ruling  on  the  issue
of whether Amazon was a product “seller” potentially liable for a
personal  injury  caused  by  a  consumer’s  use  of  a  product  they
acquired  through  Amazon.  I  have  also  bid  farewell  to  a  few
cases  that  I  always  dreaded  covering,  which  were  not  valuable
enough to justify their continued inclusion or were not the best
case  to  illustrate  a  particular  proposition.  For  example,  the  ﬁrst
two  editions  included  a  case  discussing  (but  not  applying)  the
Learned  Hand  formula  to  determine  negligence.  I  substituted  a
much  better  case  that  actually  uses  the  formula  in  an  explicit
manner  to  determine  why  a  defendant  was  negligent.  Where
possible,  this  book  tries  to  include  both  the  old  and  the  new
the  best  examples  of  particular
where
propositions or legal analysis.
Helpful textual guidance. The law of Torts is sufﬁciently robust
and challenging so that artiﬁcial barriers to its understanding are
not  necessary.  This  book  introduces  every  major  section  and
subsection  with  text  designed  to  provide  context  and  to  alert
students to themes that will be important in the cases they are
about to read. The concise, restrained notes following the cases
elaborate  on  these  themes  and  observations.  Further,  most
major  sections  include  a  recapitulation  titled  “Upon  Further
Review.”
Useful  notes  and  problems.  I  have  included  short  hypothetical
problems  after  almost  each  subsection  in  the  book.  These
problems  can  be  utilized  in  class  for  group  discussion  and
debate or in the private study by individual students. A pet peeve
of  mine  regarding  some  casebooks  is  when  a  short  case  is
followed  by  ten  pages  of  notes  where  the  author  tries  to  look
under every rock in the legal ﬁeld. I understand a ﬁrst-year Torts

class  will  only  be  the  beginning  of  a  lifetime  of  study  for  many
students. This edition continues the use of self-restraint to avoid
cluttering  the  notes  and  problems.  I  have  deleted  some
problems  I  believed  were  unclear  or  unhelpful  and  added  some
that  I  believe  will  be  useful  sources  of  discussion  in  the
classroom.
Charts,  diagrams,  pictures,  checklists,  etc.  This  book  tries
wherever  possible  to  include  textboxes  with  summaries,  visual
depictions,  charts,  and  checklists  for  students  to  focus  their
attention  on  core  points.  Textboxes  with  useful  or  provocative
quotations germane to the material are also included to capture
the imagination of students and, at times, to offer a glimpse into
the  academic  debates  often  accompanying  various  issues.
Pictures  are  included  to  help  students  remember  that  these
cases  involved  actual  events  that  transformed  the  lives  of  real
people.
Pattern jury instructions. As another method of illustrating and
restating core legal concepts, where possible the book includes
form jury instructions from various jurisdictions, introduced with
the heading “Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury.” In terms of the
jury
real-world  application  of  most  Tort  concepts,
instructions  embody  the  law  as  it  is  used  in  the  courtrooms
across the United States.
Practice essay questions. Included at the end of many chapters
in  the  book  are  longer-form  practice  essay  questions  entitled
“Pulling  It  All  Together.”  These  are  typically  made  up  of  two  to
four paragraphs of hypothetical facts with a prompt question at
the end and an indication of how long a student might want to
spend  in  attempting  to  write  an  answer  to  the  question.
Students are constantly seeking such hypothetical questions for
their use in exam preparation. Teachers can use these essays in
class  as  a  summary  of  material  or  students  on  their  own  can
utilize them.

the

Coverage.  My  goal  was  to  avoid  a  1,500-page  twenty-pound
book  that  tried  to  include  every  conceivable  Tort  issue.  But  I
wanted the book to be useful for just about any ﬁrst-year Torts
class. It begins with coverage of the classic intentional torts and
defenses  to  them.  The  book  then  spends  several  chapters
exploring negligence (including causation). The book also covers
general defenses (e.g., comparative fault, immunities, statutes of
limitation),  damages,  and  apportionment.  These  subjects  alone
may be all that many Torts classes will have time to cover. But
for  the  professor  who  has  additional  time,  I  have  also  included
chapters  on  strict  liability,  products  liability,  defamation,  and
business  torts.  The  exclusion  of  any  mention  of  business  torts
has always struck me as a serious deﬁciency that results in the

injury.  While  entire  law  school  electives  are  devoted  to  inquiry
into  some  of  these  later  chapters  of  this  book,  many  Torts
professors  enjoy  introducing  these  areas  of  the  law  in  the  ﬁrst-

flexible  enough  to  be  used  in  many  different  ways.  Despite
adding a handful of new cases, this third edition actually comes

doctrine of Necessity) has made this possible.

edition  that  my  students  love — an  explicit  checklist  of  learning

need to understand in each chapter.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

I had no idea when I ﬁrst agreed with Aspen to write the ﬁrst edition
of this book how much I was biting off. That project took two years to
complete — much of it written in a hospital at my ailing son’s bedside.
The last eight years has been swift and I am now given the chance to
offer thanks for those who have helped me bring forth a third edition.
First,  I  am  indebted  to  Aspen,  both  for  having  the  faith  in  me  to
approach  me  about  the  initial  project  and  in  giving  me  a  chance  to
produce a third edition so that I can continue to ﬁx the errors I have
found from the last edition. I also want to thank the editors who have
shown  meticulous  attention  to  detail.  Aspen  has,
from  my
perspective, the best editors in the business.

I am also thankful to teach at Baylor Law School which strives to
produce the next generation of professionals dedicated to impacting
others’  lives.  Dean  Toben  continues  to  keep  our  ship  steered  in  the
right direction and supports scholarly efforts like this. I have also had
the  chance  to  teach  alongside  both  Prof.  Jill  Lens  and  Prof.  Luke
Meier.  Our  lively  debates  about  tort  law  have  helped  to  inform  my
views in ways that impact these materials.

Bear with me momentarily, as I acknowledge some of the people
closest  to  me.  I  am  always,  ﬁrst  and  foremost,  grateful  to  my  wife
Carol who continues to show me grace and patience on a daily basis.
As  I  reflect  upon  some  of  the  most  important  things  I  have  learned
from her, the greatest lesson is in how to live a courageous life in the
face of the worst challenges. Against all odds, she has displayed truly
undaunted courage as we have leaned into the storms of life together.
For that I will forever be grateful to her and in awe of her.

My  son  Travis  and  daughter-in-law  Lindsey  were  the  ﬁrst  of  my
family  to  be  exposed  to  these  materials  as  my  students.  They  are
now  young,  successful  practicing  lawyers  in  Tyler,  Texas.  They  are
also  the  parents  of  my  ﬁrst  granddaughter  (Lucy)  and  soon  to  be
second.  I’d  like  to  claim  partial  credit  for  the  great  futures  they  hold
before  them.  In  reality,  they  have  had  far  more  impact  upon  me  and
my  teaching.  Travis  recently  decided  to  abandon  Big  Law  in  Dallas
and moved his practice to Tyler to work at a small ﬁrm where he gets
the chance to vindicate the rights of individuals. My son Tyler was a
budding  theoretical  mathematician
in  graduate  school  at  the
University of California Santa Barbara until he read one chapter of the
prior  edition  of  this  book — he’s  now  a  graduate  with  honors  from
Harvard  Law  School  and  practicing  tax  law  at  the  largest  ﬁrm  in
Texas. My youngest son Tanner (now 23) was, of course, on my mind
nearly  every  minute  as  I  worked  on  the  ﬁrst  edition  of  this  book.  He
had  just  suffered  a  severe  traumatic  brain  injury  when  he  was  the
victim of a tort on an interstate highway in Waco. As he lay in a coma,
I  began  sculpting  this  book  by  his  bedside.  You  might  surmise  that
the subject of Torts was on my mind a lot in those days. Miraculously,
he  awoke,  and  has  since  graduated  from  high  school  with  stellar
grades. He is still doing therapy most days of the week. Slowly (nearly
10 years later) he is regaining functions (e.g., walking) that most of us
take for granted. While he is still going to therapy most days, he has
recently accepted his ﬁrst job working at a new coffee shop that loves
to  employ  people  facing  personal  challenges.  Tanner  somehow
consistently  focuses  upon  life’s  blessings  and  displays  a  joy  that
most  of  us  can  only  envy.  As  I  frequently  remind  myself,  if  he  does
not complain, who am I to ever do so?

Years  ago,  I  wrote  here  that  we  “live  in  the  moment  with  hope
fueled by our faith and gratitude for our blessings.” I cannot add to or
improve upon that sentiment — it might make a good epitaph on my
tombstone someday. I pray daily that these words are not just sweet
sentiments  but  reality.  Some  days  are  easier  than  others.  Always

striving to look ahead rather than behind, I am already contemplating
a  fourth  edition  to  this  casebook  years  from  now  and  all  the  new
blessings I will be able to report here.

Special  thanks  also  go  to  my  current  research  assistant,  Hope

Burkhalter, for her work in helping me to spot my own errors.

Tort:

The word is derived from the
Latin “tortus” which meant
twisted or crooked. In the

Non-lawyers  typically  respond
with  amusement  when  hearing
of  a  law  school  course  titled
“Torts.”  A  frequent  refrain
is
either  “what  is  that?”  or  “isn’t
that  something  you  get  at  a
bakery?” No, the subject you will
be  studying  has  nothing  to  do
with food. A tort is a civil cause
of  action  that  seeks  to  right  a
wrong,  historically  for  a  claim
recognized  under  the  common
law,  for  something  other  than

a
contractual  promise.  That  is,  at

head  with  a  tree  branch.  A
stalker repeatedly makes phone
calls  to  a  young  lady  at  her
home  late  at  night  threatening
to break into the house to cause
her  bodily  harm.  Vandals  throw
paint  against  someone’s  new
automobile  ruining  its  exterior
ﬁnish. A homeowner fails to secure a gate and inadvertently permits a
child  from  next  door  to  wander  into  their  yard  and  drown  in  their
swimming  pool.  A  security  guard  detains  a  shopper  at  a  department
store  just  because  the  customer  is  wearing  gang  attire.  A  husband
witnesses the violent death of his wife as she crosses a street and is hit
by a careless and drunk driver who has careened out of control on the
city street. A mental patient conﬁdes to his psychiatrist that he is going
to  kill  his  girlfriend  and  the  doctor  fails  to  warn  her  and  her  death
results. A jilted lover falsely tells others that his former girlfriend had a
venereal  disease.  Or  perhaps  a  lawyer  entrusted  with  a  new  client’s
potential  lawsuit  fails  to  ﬁle  it  on  time.  Under  the  right  circumstances,
any of these true-to-life instances can qualify as a legitimate tort cause
of  action.  These  scenarios  involve  the  potential  violation  of  another
citizen’s  civil  right  to  be  protected  from  certain  types  of  harm  under
circumstances where the victim’s rights are not deﬁned pursuant to any
contract  with  the  defendant-tortfeasor.  A  tort  may  have  occurred.  A
major part of your current undertaking is to acquire the knowledge and
skill to look at a set of facts, and to reach an informed opinion on the
question of whether a tort claim exists.

II  GOALS AND CRITICISMS

From  the  above  examples,  the  victims’  lives  might  have  been  forever
changed by these incidents. Tort law cannot undo all of these wrongs,
but it can attempt to provide some civil redress, typically in the form of
damages. While it is true that in exceptional circumstances the law will
permit an extraordinary equitable remedy — such as for injunction — to
prevent the commission of a threatened tort, most tort claims involve a
request for monetary relief by the plaintiff. The subject of torts speaks
in dollars and cents.

As you work through these materials, you should consider for each
tort  theory  or  doctrine  the  principle  behind  the  rule  of  law.  One
fascinating aspect of legal study is the realization that the rules are not
arbitrary.  You  may  not  agree  with  a  particular  doctrine — and  often
courts  among  different  states  will  disagree  about  particular  tort
doctrines — but you can be certain that every tort doctrine had a reason
for  its  adoption  initially.  As  times  and  circumstances  change,  and  as
values  evolve  in  our  society,  there  are  frequent  occasions  when  a  tort
doctrine needs to be revisited. You will see numerous examples in the
cases  of  courts  revisiting  old  tort  doctrines  to  decide  if  they  should
continue  to  be  recognized,  abandoned,  or  modiﬁed  in  some  fashion.
These determinations are driven by perceptions of the principles.

Likely you have heard in recent public forums debate on whether our
tort system is broken and in need of serious reform. During the last few
decades  there  have  been  tremendous  efforts  undertaken  to  modify
common  law  tort  doctrines  either  through  the  courts  themselves  or,
more signiﬁcantly, through legislative action. You will encounter various
manifestations  of  judicial  and  legislative  tort  reform  as  you  work
through  various  portions  of  this  book.  When  we  get  to  Chapter  8  on
Damages, we will encounter the tort reform movement directly. You are
free  to  make  your  own  assessment  on  the  legitimacy  of  a  torts  crisis,
but these materials will ask that you consider all of the evidence before

reaching  a  conclusion.  As  a  new  lawyer  (or  law  student)  you  will  be
asked your opinion by many laypersons about these matters. Further, if
you practice tort law, you will encounter appeals to judges based upon
notions  that  our  system  is  broken  and  in  need  of  repair.  Being
thoughtful  in  your  approach  to  such  matters  will  serve  you  well.  One
useful exercise for you will be to keep this issue — how well our current
system is working — in the back of your mind as you read the hundreds
of  cases  in  this  book.  As  you  read  each  case,  ask  yourself,  “Does  it
appear  the  current  doctrines  and  procedural  rules  are  already  in  place
to avoid outrageous results?”

A. What Are the Purposes Behind Tort Law?

From  a  macro  perspective,  it  is  worth  considering  at  the  inception  of
our  study  the  broad  objectives  that  tort  law  seeks  to  vindicate.  These
objectives can be isolated and identiﬁed in many instances as we study
the  various  tort  causes  of  action.  You  may  ask  yourself,  “what
difference does it make?” There are multiple layers of response to that
question.  First,  understanding  the  purposes  behind  tort  law  and  its
many  doctrines  and  rules  makes  the  study  fascinating.  Second,
knowing  the  purposes  behind  the  rules  that  you  will  discover  in  this
book will increase the depth of your knowledge regarding those rules. A
parrot might be trained to repeat certain tort phrases, but this does not
make  the  bird  into  a  lawyer.  Being  a  good  lawyer  (or  law  student)  is
much  more  than  memorizing  a  list  of  rules  or  laws.  The  rules
themselves are very basic in terms of your education of tort law. Being
able  to  articulate  not  only  how  a  rule  of  law  applies,  but  also  when  it
applies, why it applies, and perhaps when it needs to be changed is the
stuff of a torts master. Third, if you understand the rationale behind tort
doctrines  it  will  help  you  to  articulate  answers  to  questions  that  have
not yet been addressed by courts. As you will see, the common law of
torts evolves with every case decided because the unique facts of each
case  become  a  part  of  the  law.  Because  factual  circumstances

underlying  a  tort  claim  are  always  potentially  unique,  judges  and
lawyers constantly have to determine if certain tort doctrines still apply
as the facts are modiﬁed from one case to the next.

You  might  divide  the  world  of  tort  scholars  into  two  camps —
roughly, those who believe the primary purpose of tort law is to regulate
conduct by deterring (through the punishment of awards of damages)
certain  antisocial  behavior,  and  those  interested  in  “corrective  justice”
between the particular litigants. When a judge requires a tortfeasor who
has  beaten  the  plaintiff  with  a  stick  to  pay  for  the  harm  caused,  the
thought is that this tortfeasor (and others who are aware of our system
of civil justice) will think twice before whacking another with a stick. In
addition,  when  the  judge  awards  damages  in  favor  of  the  victim  and
against  the  tortfeasor,  the  judge  is  implementing  justice  by  providing
compensation  in  favor  of  a  worthy  victim.  Some  torts  scholars  argue
that these purposes stand in conflict with one another. They assert that
if  you  push  deterrence  as  the  principal  goal,  then  you  will  be  more
demanding  of  proof  of  fault  by  the  defendant  before  you  enter
judgment.  On  the  other  hand,  they  assert  that  if  compensation  is  the
chief goal then a system that rewards plaintiffs without too many legal
hurdles  is  superior.  The  truth  is  that  these  rather  large  and  general
goals are not in conflict but work together:

Identifying the goals of tort law seemed to be a relatively easy task.
Reduced to its essentials and stripping away all that is unnecessary,
the consequence of a successful tort lawsuit is to invoke the power
of the state (in the form of a judgment) to compel one person (the
defendant)  to  compensate  another  (the  plaintiff)  for  injuries  for
which the defendant may be judged “responsible” in some way. As a
result  of  this  invocation  of  sovereign  power,  the  injured  person  is
(and  all  who  might  ﬁnd
compensated,  and  the  tortfeasor
themselves  in  a  situation  similar  to  that  of  the  tortfeasor  in  the
future)  is  deterred  from  engaging  in  whatever  conduct  caused  the
injury. The twin pillars of tort law — compensation and deterrence —
were  born  of  the  legal  realist  movement  and  the  simple  act  of

describing  the  most  obvious  consequences  of  a  successful  tort
lawsuit.

J. Clark Kelso, Sixty Years of Torts: Lessons for the Future, 29 Torts &
Ins. L.J. 1 (1993).

“To me, a lawyer is basically the
person that knows the rules of
the country. We’re all throwing
the dice, playing the game,
moving our pieces around the
board, but if there is a problem,
the lawyer is the only person who
has read the inside of the top of
the box.”

Beyond  these  rather  noble
goals of regulating conduct and
seeking justice, there is another
important  goal  of  tort  law —
resolving  civil  disputes
in  a
peaceable  manner.  The  truth  is
that  when  one  person
is
perceived  to  misbehave  and
cause  harm  to  another,  it  is
important
the  parties
believe  there  is  a  civil  justice
system prepared to resolve their
dispute  in  what  is  perceived  to
fair  and  non-arbitrary
be  a
manner. It is possible to simply have a referee flip a coin to resolve such
disputes, but the parties would quickly realize there was no point taking
their  dispute  to  the  local  government  to  do  this.  Short  of  a  civil  and
peaceable system to resolve these disputes, the fear is that the parties
would  simply  engage  in  violent  acts  to  get  even  or  extract  some
payment  for  the  initial  injury.  At  this  very  basic  level,  the  civil  justice
system  is  designed  to  avoid  gunﬁghts  in  the  town  square.  If  it  can
regulate conduct and thereby reduce injuries or at least provide justice
after an injury has occurred, that’s icing on the cake.

B. Has Tort Law Gotten Out of Control?

There  is  a  good  chance  that  you  had  already  heard  the  word  “torts”
before  starting  law  school  because  “tort  reform”  has  pervaded  the

public forum in terms of political debate for several decades. You may
have  even  formed  an  opinion  about  whether  tort  lawsuits  are  “out  of
control”  and  the  “system  broken.”  Such  is  the  common  assertion  of
many  partisan  candidates  for  elected  ofﬁce  today.  Patience  should  be
urged before forming a closed mind on this controversial issue. At the
end of your study of torts you will be in a much better position to opine
on that topic. Nevertheless, it is worth at least introducing the topic of
tort  reform  at  the  outset  because  it  is  the  elephant  in  the  room.  It  is
something that you should keep in the back of your mind as you begin
your  study  of  tort  law.  And  the  media’s  coverage  of  tort  reform  is  not
always conducted at a sophisticated, academic level. Because there is
a good chance you have already, therefore, become familiar with some
of the arguments in favor of tort reform, you should at least be aware of
some  serious  counter-arguments.  The  following  excerpt  is  a  good
example of such scholarship.

RULE 11 AND TORT REFORM: MYTH, REALITY, AND
LEGISLATION
18 Geo. J. Legal Ethics 809 (2005)*

Amending  modern  civil  procedure  is  a  process  of  balance  and
deliberation. When any claim can be made in a federal courtroom, the
system  may  seem  overwhelmed  by  “frivolous”  lawsuits.  When  heavy
restrictions  act  as  a  deterrent,  even  legitimate  claims  might  not  have
access to the system. The evolution of Rule 11 [a Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure  that  sanctions  groundless  lawsuits]  illustrates  the  need  to
consider both the abuse and the access ends of the equation and the
dangers  of  mistaking  harsher  sanctions  for  genuine  improvement.
Good litigation reform requires poised formulation and attention to real
historical  trends.  Moreover,  good
litigation  reform  requires  good
lawyers — attorneys who act, not only within the proscribed bounds of

ethical codes, but to help shape those standards and conventions in a
safe and responsible manner.

But American culture is saturated with the stereotyping of lawyers,
and  lawmakers  have  a  tendency  to  cry  wolf  at  a  litigation  crisis  to
garner  easy  praise  and  campaign  support.  Historical  fact  and  current
data demonstrate the folly in this approach.

Tort  reform  rhetoric  feeds  into  lawyer  stereotypes  and  is  itself
stereotypical.  Worse  than  the  relative  predictability  of  the  tort  reform
narrative, the single-minded obsession with an American litigation crisis
blinds lawmakers to real problems and effective solutions. All empirical
evidence  suggests  that  lawsuits  are  declining,  that  jury  awards  are
shrinking,  and  that  the  costs  of  litigation  to  the  overall  American
economy  are  slight  if  at  all  signiﬁcant.  House  Resolution  4571
[proposed  as  an  aid  to  strengthen  Rule  11’s  application]  stems  from,
and  lends  authority  to,  a  cultural  bias  and  a  mythological  emergency,
but it does not reflect reality or offer a desired outcome.

A. The Myth

The  American  public  does  not  like  lawyers.  Maybe  it  never  has.  The
cultural  roots  of  modern  anti-lawyer  sentiment  run  deep.  In  1770,  the
citizens  of  Grafton,  New  Hampshire,  dispatched  the  following  census
report to George III:

Your Royal Majesty, Grafton County . . . contains 6,489 souls, most of whom are
engaged in agriculture, but included in that number are 69 wheelwrights, 8 doctors,
29 blacksmiths, 87 preachers, 20 slaves and 90 students at the new college. There
is not one lawyer, for which fact we take no personal credit, but thank an Almighty
and Merciful God.

About three-quarters of surveyed individuals believe that the United
States has too many lawyers and over half believe that lawyers ﬁle too
many  lawsuits.  It  is  true  that  the  number  of  attorneys  in  America  has
nearly  tripled  over  the  last  three  decades,  a  statistic  approaching
900,000  practicing  lawyers.  But  complaints  about  the  number  of

lawyers,  metaphors  used  to  describe  the  profession,  and  even  lawyer
jokes have been part of American social values for centuries.

[The  tort  reformers  behind  the  proposed  amendment  to  Rule  11]
certainly tapped into the anti-lawyer tradition. In explaining the need for
direct amendment of Rule 11, the tort reformers couch their argument
in personal, anecdotal appeals to the American public. Doctors cannot
help  but  be  enraged  at  the  story  of  the  C.E.O.  of  San  Antonio’s
Methodist  Children’s  Hospital,  who  “was  sued  after  he  stepped  into  a
patient’s  hospital  room  and  asked  how  he  was  doing.”  Parents  and
community  volunteers  must  be  appalled  by  the  tale  of  a  New  Jersey
little league coach who “had to settle the case for $25,000” when angry
parents sued over their son’s black eye. Americans should be dismayed
— even  if  somewhat  amused — by  the  narrative  of  the  Pennsylvania
man  who  “sued  the  Frito  Lay  Company,  claiming  that  Doritos  chips
were
in  his  throat.”  Such
storytelling  is  captivating,  entertaining,  and  resonates  with  the  anti-
lawyer undercurrents of American culture.

inherently  dangerous  after  one  stuck

As  engaging  as  the  frivolous  lawsuit  narratives  can  be,  they  also
follow a predictable pattern and tend to be somewhat misleading. The
premise  and  conclusion  of  every  storyline  is  that  the  onslaught  of
“frivolous lawsuits” threatens to destroy the American way of life. Very
little hard data is ever presented to substantiate the claim; the basis for
this  rather  frightening  statement  is  almost  entirely  anecdotal.  The
public  has  almost  always  heard  these  stories,  or  stories  like  them,
before. Of course, they are increasingly recognizable because cases like
the  ones  described  by  the  tort  reformers  receive  disproportionate
media  attention.  In  the  modern  media  culture,  the  line  between  news
and  entertainment  is  not  often  clear;  serious  coverage  of  the  court
system struggles to be heard over the din of talk radio, cable punditry,
stump speeches, and election coverage. The stories that do surface are
“anecdotal  glimpses  of  atypical  cases.”  Cognitive  biases  only  reinforce
public  misperception  of  the  overall  system — because  vivid  incidents
are  easier  to  recall,  people  tend  to  overestimate  how  frequently  the

most  outrageous  stories  occur.  And  not  even  these  cases  are  the
straightforward abuses of the system they may seem.

Many  Americans  are  familiar  with  the  multi-million  dollar  punitive
damages  award  against  McDonald’s  for  serving  coffee  at  scalding
temperatures. Less are familiar with the facts of the case. The plaintiff,
a  seventy-nine-year-old  woman,  received  acutely  painful  third  degree
burns  from  coffee  heated  to  over  180  degrees.  She  only  brought  suit
when  McDonald’s  refused  to  reimburse  her  medical  expenses;  at  trial,
the jury learned of at least 700 other McDonald’s burn victims who had
been  summarily  dismissed  by  McDonald’s  safety  experts.  The  $2.3
million jury verdict was later reduced to $640,000, but the original sum
represented exactly two days of coffee sales revenues for McDonald’s
nationwide. Reasonable people can disagree as to whether this lawsuit
was  vindictive  or  vindication,  but  “what  qualiﬁes  as  a  frivolous  claim
depends  on  the  eye  of  the  beholder.”  Given  all  the  facts,  the  line
between frivolous lawsuit and defensible argument is harder to draw.

Lawmakers  must  know  that  the  deﬁnition  of  “frivolous”  is  not
straightforward  when  it  comes  to  litigation — but  they  hammer  home
the perpetual crisis of legal hypochondria anyway. By characterizing the
problem  as  too  many  lawyers,  the  tort  reformers  miss  a  more
important  question — not  whether  or  not  there  are  too  many  lawyers,
but whether or not the legal profession is serving the American public
as  it  should.  By  obscuring  the  facts  with  extravagant,  yet  predictable,
storytelling, they miss an even larger problem — not why the American
people  are  terriﬁed  of  tort  litigation,  but  why  large  numbers  of
Americans  lack  the  information  and  resources  to  assert  legitimate
claims.  Why  do  they  do  it?  Says  one  brieﬁng  book  for  House
Republicans:  “attacking  trial  lawyers  is  admittedly  a  cheap  applause
line, but it works. It’s almost impossible to go too far when it comes to
demonizing lawyers.” The tort reformers might be moved by collecting
campaign  contributions  from  corporate  America  or  by  garnering
popular support by tapping into a stereotypical position, but they do not
appear to be motivated by reality.

B. The Reality

By all available data, the litigation crisis depicted by the authors of H.R.
4571  simply  does  not  exist.  In  fact,  the  Justice  Department  Bureau  of
Justice  Statistics  tracked  more  than  a  decade  of  litigation  in  the
seventy-ﬁve  largest  counties  in  the  United  States  and  found  the  exact
opposite trends. From 1992 to 2001, the overall number of civil lawsuits
ﬁled in America dropped by 47%. The number of tort suits fell by 31.8%
and  the  number  of  medical  malpractice  claims — an  area  of  litigation
often  cited  by  tort  reformers  and  insurance  companies  for  increasing
abuse — declined by 14.2%.

jury  award

As the amount of litigation on the docket has declined, so have the
jury  awards  so  often  decried  as  outrageous  and  skyrocketing  by  the
in  2001  was  $37,000,
tort  reformers.  The  median
representing a 43.1% decrease over the previous decade. Limiting that
analysis to only tort cases, the median jury award stood at $28,000, a
56.3% drop since 1992. Moreover, juries rarely award punitive damages
at  all — less  than  3%  of  all  plaintiff  winners  in  tort  trials  were  awarded
punitive damages; the median award was $38,000. If litigation rates are
decreasing  nationwide  and  jury  awards  are  more  conservative  than
they have been in twenty years, it is difﬁcult to see where the litigation
crisis  exists.  Not  even  the  baseline  mythology  of  a  naturally  litigious
American culture is really accurate. Comparatively, the United States is
far from the most litigious country in the world.

When  the  data  contradicts  their

immediate  claims,  the  tort
reformers often turn to an alternative economic argument — because of
frivolous  lawsuits,  whatever  their  number  may  be,  “small  businesses
and  workers  suffer.”  Consider  one  anecdote  presented  to  the  House
Judiciary Committee in support of H.R. 4571:

This  year,  the  nation’s  oldest  ladder  manufacturer,  family-owned  John  S.  Tilley
Ladders  Co.  of  Watervilet,  New  York,  near  Albany,  ﬁled  for  bankruptcy  protection
and sold off most of its assets due to litigation costs. Founded in 1855, the Tilley
ﬁrm  could  not  handle  the  cost  of  liability  insurance,  which  had  risen  from  6%  of
sales a decade ago to 29%, even though the company never lost an actual court

judgment.  “We  could  see  the  handwriting  on  the  wall  and  just  want  to  end  this
whole thing,” said Robert Howland, a descendant of company founder John Tilley.

Neither  “sales”  nor  the  reasons  behind  the  proportional  rise  in
insurance  costs  have  been  explained,  but  the  statistics  quoted  in  the
story are probably technically correct.

The  economic  argument  takes  the  same  narrative  form  as  the
excessive litigation claim — a personal anecdote about respected, small
town  folks  whose  hard  work  has  been  swept  away  by  lawyers  and
lawsuits.  But  these  concerns  about  the  overall  cost  of  litigation  to  the
American economy are based on storytelling and dubious statistics, not
hard  data.  One  Brookings  Institute  expert  estimates  that  tort  liability
could  comprise  at  most  2%  of  the  total  costs  of  United  States  goods
and services. At that rate, he estimates that it is “highly doubtful” legal
expenditures could signiﬁcantly affect the competitiveness of American
products.  Other  experts  place  the  total  estimated  business  liability  for
all legal claims at about twenty-ﬁve cents for every one hundred dollars
in  revenue.  The  legal  deﬁnition  of  “small  business”  may  shift,  and
individual  stories  might  invoke  sympathy,  but  there  appears  to  be  no
apparent economic facet to the litigation crisis either.

The reality is that the United States does not face a litigation crisis.
Even  if  insurance  premiums  are  excessively  high,  America’s  litigation
rates  are  neither  excessive  nor  increasing.  The  most  signiﬁcant
problems with the system involve, not too many cases or unreasonably
high jury awards, but too little access to justice and unreasonably few
legal  services  available  to  the  general  public.  The  “Frivolous  Lawsuit
Reduction  Act”  might  dovetail  nicely  with  a  cultural  bias  or  score  well
with  a  given  political  base,  but  it  does  not  address  any  actual
immediate emergency.

III  CASE PROCEDURE AND DEFINITIONS

Cases tend to follow a certain pathway as they wind their way through
our civil judicial system. You will be reading tort cases that are written
at  different  points  in  time.  Some  opinions  are  rulings  upon  motions
attacking the plaintiff’s initial pleading because the defendant contends
that  no  legitimate  claim  is  possible  under  existing  law.  Other  court
opinions are written after some period of discovery has transpired and
immediately  before  trial.  These  are  in  response  to  motions  that  argue
that  the  evidence  is  so  one-sided  that  no  trial  is  necessary.  Appellate
courts  write  other  opinions  in  this  book,  after  a  trial  court’s  entry  of
judgment.  These  procedural  nuances  are  often
in
understanding a court’s opinion. You will be learning more about these
procedures  in  your  civil  procedure  class.  An  initial  overview  here,
however, will be helpful to you in deciphering the torts cases we will be
encountering in a few pages.

important

A. Pleadings and Attacks on Pleadings

A  tort  victim  who  ﬁles  a  suit  is  called  the  “plaintiff.”  The  alleged
tortfeasor  is  the  “defendant.”  The  plaintiff  initiates  a  civil  tort  case  by
ﬁling  a  so-called  short  and  plain  statement  of  the  claim.  This  is
essentially  a  formal  pleading  that  identiﬁes  the  parties,  states  the
court’s power or “jurisdiction” over the type of claims ﬁled and over the
parties,  and  then  articulates  the  factual  and  legal  basis  for  the  claims
asserted.  In  short,  the  complaint  tells  the  legal  story  of  what  the
defendant  did  that  was  wrong  and  how  this  hurt  the  plaintiff.  The

complaint  ends  with  a  “prayer”  for  relief  that  identiﬁes  the  legal
remedies  (e.g.,  the  damages)  plaintiff  seeks  against  the  defendant  at
the conclusion of the case. The defendant is permitted to ﬁle an initial
attack  on  the  adequacy  of  this  pleading,  denominated  a  “motion  to
dismiss.”  Typically,  in  ruling  upon  these  foundational  attacks  on  the
lawsuit,  the  court  is  supposed  to  assume  that  every  fact  plaintiff  has
alleged  is  true.  The  focus  of  the  motion  is  not  arguing  the  facts  but
arguing  whether  the  law  might  possibly  recognize  a  valid  claim
assuming  the  facts  are  as  alleged.  In  run-of-the-mill  cases  where  the
law  is  quite  settled,  the  defendant  may  not  bother  to  ﬁle  a  motion  to
dismiss. But when the complaint asserts a tort cause of action whose
existence  or  contour  is  uncertain,  a  motion  to  dismiss  gives  the  court
an early opportunity to examine the case and make an early legal ruling
on a potentially dispositive matter. Some of the cases contained in this
book  are  appeals  from  trial  court  dismissals  of  cases  at  this  early
stage.

“It won’t do to have truth and
justice on his side, he must have
law and lawyers.”

Charles Dickens

B. Formal Discovery

If  the  trial  court  recognizes  a
legitimate  claim  has  been
stated  by
the  plaintiff  and
permits  the  plaintiff’s  claim  to
proceed,  a  period  of  often  time-
consuming
expensive
and
pretrial  practice  occurs  called
formal  discovery.  Modern  rules
of  civil  procedure  permit  great
latitude  to  both  parties  to  a

requests  for
information  and
documents  to  which  the  other
party  is  obligated  to  respond

Informally,  discovery  of
facts  also  facilitates  settlement
by permitting the parties to gain a clearer view of how the case might
appear  at  a  trial.  Such  perspective  often  clariﬁes  the  merits  of  each
side’s positions.

C. Motions for Summary Judgment

Often the last formal barrier to getting its jury trial that a plaintiff faces
is a defendant’s motion for summary judgment arguing that no trial is
needed because plaintiff lacks sufﬁcient evidentiary support for its tort
cause  of  action.  (Less  frequently,  a  plaintiff  can  ﬁle  a  motion  for
summary judgment arguing that its claims are undisputed and that it is
entitled to judgment without need for trial, in whole or part.) The parties
will argue about the application of the law to the facts in a motion for
summary  judgment.  In  essence,  the  trial  court  is  asking  itself  when
ruling on such a motion, whether there is any need to convene a jury of
citizens  to  rule  upon  disputed  questions  of  fact.  If  not,  summary
judgment  might  well  be  granted  and  ﬁnal  judgment  entered  in  an
expedited  fashion.  Many  of  the  cases  in  this  book  are  appellate

opinions  reviewing  the  propriety  of  trial  courts’  granting  of  summary
judgment motions.

D. Trial

At  trial,  the  plaintiff  has  the  opportunity  to  present  evidence  to
demonstrate  the  merit  of  the  particular  tort  cause(s)  of  action  being
pursued. This proof will come both from the witness stand in the form
of  live  testimony  from  witnesses  under  oath,  and  from  other  tangible
forms  of  evidence  such  as  photographs,  documents,  videotapes,  or
other  objects  (e.g.,  an  allegedly  defective  tire)  relevant  to  the  matter.
The  defendant  has  a  chance  to  cross-examine  each  of  the  plaintiff’s
witnesses. After the plaintiff rests, the defendant is given an additional
opportunity to challenge the sufﬁciency of the plaintiff’s evidence in the
form  of  a  motion  for  directed  (or  instructed)  verdict.  This  is  an  odd
name for a motion. Its roots lie in an ancient practice: After granting a
motion,  the  judge  would  direct  the  jury  to  enter  a  particular  ﬁnding.
Nowadays,  courts  granting  the  motion  do  not  direct  the  jury  to  do
anything  other  than  to  go  home  because  their  service  is  no  longer
necessary.  Theoretically,  the  same  basis  for  a  directed  verdict  motion
should  have  been  available  prior  to  trial  in  the  form  of  a  motion  for
summary judgment. A defendant whose motion for summary judgment
was denied is often undeterred in arguing the same points later during
the  trial  in  the  directed  verdict  motion.  If  this  motion  is  denied,  the
defendant  has  the  same  opportunity  as  the  plaintiff  to  call  witnesses
and  introduce  exhibits  that  support  the  defendant’s  position.  At  the
conclusion of all of the evidence being submitted, the lawyers present
closing arguments to the jury and the court instructs the jury on the law
they are to apply in reaching its verdict. Trials are the pinnacle of both
exhilaration  and  stress  for  both  the  litigants  and  their  lawyers.  Other
cases in this book are appellate opinions concerning alleged errors that
occurred  at  trial,  such  as  ruling  on  evidentiary  matters;  the  validity  of

the trial court’s instructions on the law to the jury; and the sufﬁciency of
the evidence to support the jury’s verdict.

E. Entry of Judgment

If the jury cannot reach a verdict (in federal court a unanimous verdict
is required) the trial judge declares a “mistrial” and resets the case for a
new  trial  in  the  future.  If  the  jury  does  render  a  verdict,  the  court  will
entertain  motions  by  the  prevailing  party  to  enter
in
conformity  with  that  verdict,  and  motions  by  the  losing  party  to
disregard the verdict as against the great weight of the evidence. Once
the trial court enters a ﬁnal judgment, it loses jurisdiction over the case
and the case becomes an appellate matter.

judgment

F. Appeal

Appeals  are  subject  to  their  own  unique  procedures  and  rules,  and
many  lawyers  specialize  in  handling  appeals.  Litigants  are  typically
entitled  to  one  appeal  as  of  right  from  a  ﬁnal  judgment  to  an
intermediate  court  of  appeals.  Beyond  that,  review
is  typically
discretionary at the highest court — usually, but not always, referred to
as a “supreme court.”

The losing party ﬁling the appeal is referred to as the “appellant” and
the  prevailing  party  at  the  trial  court  level  is  called  the  “appellee.”  The
appellant is given a certain number of days after the ﬁnal judgment to
ﬁle  an  appellate  brief  with  the  appeals  court  pointing  out  reversible
errors made by the trial judge in either granting or denying a motion, or
in failing to enter judgment in conformity with the verdict, or in failing to
disregard  the  verdict.  Further,  trials  are  ﬁlled  with  many  evidentiary
objections, which can be the subject of a possible appeal. Appeals can
take months to years to resolve.

IV  CASE BRIEFING

Your  professor  may  expect  you  to  prepare  and  bring  to  class  a  “case
brief”  for  each  of  the  cases  you  are  assigned  to  read  from  these
materials.  Whether  formally  assigned  this  task  or  not,  it  is  a  wise
practice,  particularly  for  a  beginning  law  student.  A  case  brief  is  a
summary  or  synopsis  of  the  important  aspects  of  a  case  and  should
reflect your thoughtful reflections on the court’s analysis.

A. Reasons for Briefing a Case

There are two reasons you should brief your cases even if not required
by  your  professor.  First,  case  brieﬁng  will  help  you  to  understand  the
case  better  by  focusing  your  attention  upon  important  aspects  of  the
court’s  written  opinion.  Second,  the  case  brief  will  be  a  useful  tool
during  class  as  well  as  later  during  the  term,  when  you  are  preparing
your course “outline.”

Even beyond law school, good lawyers brief cases they read as they
practice  law.  Their  case  brief  may  not  be  as  formal  as  what  you  will
likely prepare as a law student, but the lawyer’s notes on the cases she
reads in the ﬁrm library will generally contain similar categories to your
case briefs, and help to focus the lawyer’s attention on key components
of the case. Doing so helps the lawyer utilize the case either in a written
brief  or  in  preparing  for  oral  arguments  at  a  motion  hearing  or  on
appeal.

B. Preparation of a Case Brief

The  most  important  aspect  of  brieﬁng  a  case  is  reading  the  case
carefully and repeatedly. Particularly for the new law student, it is likely
impossible  to  write  a  good  case  brief  as  you  are  reading  through  the

case  the  very  ﬁrst  time.  If  you  attempt  to  do  so  you  will  include
unnecessary  information.  This  is  because  information  in  the  opinion
that might appear to be highly important at ﬁrst may turn out to have
no bearing on the court’s analysis or holding. The best tip is to simply
read  the  case  through  the  first  time  without  attempting  to  write  the
brief, and perhaps without even marking the case or taking any notes.
This  ﬁrst  read  should  be  to  give  you  general  familiarity  with  the  case
and  the  court’s  ultimate  outcome.  Once  you  have  completed  this  ﬁrst
careful read of the case, you are ready to re-read the case and to draft
your case brief.

Case briefs generally have the following sections: Facts, Procedural
History,  Issue,  Rule,  Analysis,  and  Holding.  Variations  and  additional
categories  are  added  by  some  but  are  not  always  necessary.  Let’s
explore each briefly.

1. Facts

The  goal  in  this  section  of  the  brief  is  to  recite  the  most  critically
important  factual  details  providing  the  backdrop  for  the  court’s  legal
discussion. The goal is not to sharpen your typing skills by simply being
a scrivener and re-writing all the facts that are already contained in the
opinion. After all, you already have the case on the printed page with all
the facts to begin with. Including all the facts in your case brief would
serve no purpose.

Which facts to include depends upon the issues and analysis in the
court’s opinion. Some basic information is almost always helpful, such
as the identity of the key parties, the nature of the case, and the basic
story behind the issues. Whether the events took place on a Tuesday or
Wednesday  might  be  irrelevant.  The  dates  of  the  events  may  or  may
not be important. The color of the car might be irrelevant while the color
of  a  trafﬁc  light  might  be  essential  to  recall,  at  least  in  a  trafﬁc
intersection tort case.

2. Procedural History

It  is  useful  to  note  the  procedural  posture  of  the  case  when  the  trial
court ruled upon the issue that is the subject of the appellate opinion.
Was it a preliminary motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim? Did
the case come up for appeal following a summary judgment order? Did
the  trial  court  grant  a  judgment  notwithstanding  the  jury’s  verdict?  Is
the  appeal  just  an  attack  upon  the  sufﬁciency  of  the  evidence
underlying  a  ﬁnal  judgment  following  the  jury  trial?  This  should  be
succinctly stated in your case brief.

3. Issue

There  is  a  reason  the  case  was  appealed.  There  is  also  a  reason  the
author of your casebook included the case in the book. And there is a
reason  your  professor  assigned  the  case  to  read  and  cover  in  class.
Identifying the primary legal issues in the opinion should help to reveal
these reasons. Sometimes the court in its opinion will simply say, “The
issue for resolution in this case is . . . .” In these cases, identifying and
articulating  the  legal  issue  should  be  quite  easy.  But  even  if  the  court
has  not  given  you  this  cheat  for  your  case  brief  writing,  your  careful
reading  of  the  case  and  understanding  of  the  court’s  analysis  should
enable you to identify the question, or questions, the court is trying to
resolve  on  appeal.  It  might  be  a  purely  legal  question,  such  as  “what
level of intent is necessary in the State of Indiana to give rise to a cause
of  action  for  battery?”  Other  times  it  might  involve  the  application  of
facts to the law, such as “did the defendant have a reasonable basis for
his belief that force was necessary to defend himself from the threats
of the plaintiff?”

4. Rule

Legal analysis necessarily involves applying legal principles or rules to
the facts of the case. These rules of law may or may not be disputed in
a  particular  case.  In  order  to  permit  the  analysis  to  proceed,  the  court
must  articulate  the  applicable  legal  rule  that  will  guide  the  court’s
decision. What rule of law does the court invoke as the foundation for
declaring the litigation winner and loser? In the context of a tort claim,
often  the  legal  rule  involves  some  statement  of  the  elements  of  the
particular tort cause of action involved. For example, in the context of a
tort  claim  for  battery,  a  legal  rule  might  be  that  one  is  not  liable  for
battery  unless  she  intends  to  cause  a  harmful  contact  to  the  plaintiff.
Once the court has identiﬁed, clariﬁed, or found the applicable legal rule
it can then continue its analysis by applying the circumstances (i.e., the
facts)  of  the  case  to  that  rule.  Your  brief  should  reference  the  guiding
legal principle or rule used by the court.

5. Analysis

The analysis is arguably the most important aspect of the brief. It really
answers  the  implicit  question,  “why  did  the  court  reach  its  holding  in
this case?” All law professors will spend considerable time during class
addressing  the  court’s  analysis  in  a  case,  trying  to  understand  the
rationale  for  the  court’s  opinion  and  for  any  rule  of  law  or  doctrine
adopted or applied by the court. This is the most interesting aspect of
case brieﬁng and will provide the most help to you in understanding any
given area of the law. The analysis will be critical to the course outline
you prepare on a later date. Focusing upon the courts’ analyses in the
cases as you read through this book will also prepare you for your ﬁnal
exam,  because  a  traditional  torts  essay  exam  demands  that  you  be
able  to  analyze  in  hypothetical  factual  contexts  how  a  court  would
reach  particular  conclusions.  You  will  do  this  by  demonstrating
familiarity with the rules of law and dexterity at using the facts to reach
particular  reasoned  conclusions.  Thus,  at  the  intersection  of  the  rules
and the facts you ﬁnd legal analysis.

6. Holding

The  holding  should  provide  the  answer  to  the  issue  you  articulated
earlier  in  your  case  brief.  It  can  often  be  stated  as  a  “yes”  or  “no”  with
explanation.  There  can  be  two  aspects  to  correctly  stating  the  case
holding.  First,  who  prevails  on  the  appeal  on  the  primary  issues?
Second,  what  rule  of  law  is  the  court  choosing  to  provide  the
foundation  for  declaring  the  winner  and  loser  of  the  appeal?  For
example, your statement of the holding to the issue from the preceding
paragraph  about  the  self-defense  case  might  be:  “Yes,  the  court  ruled
that  the  defendant  did  have  a  reasonable  belief  that  his  force  was
necessary,  because  the  court  held  that
information  that  was
unavailable  to  the  defendant  at  the  time  he  acted  cannot  be  used  to
undermine his assertion of self-defense.”

How  long  your  case  brief  needs  to  be  depends  upon  the  case.  In
general, your case brief should be substantially shorter than the court’s
opinion  you  are  studying.  Almost  always  it  should  comfortably  ﬁt  on
one typed page. But remember, the length of the effective case brief is
not proportional to its quality. A good case brief should be as short as
possible while communicating the basic information outlined above.

Upon Further Review

Despite its ancient roots, tort law continues to evolve as times and
circumstances change. These changes can take many forms, from
newly  created  causes  of  action,  to  discarded  theories  of  liability
and constantly tweaked doctrines and claims. These changes tend
to occur at the intersection where relatively constant tort principles
meet changed values, experiences, and even technology. This book
will present both the principles underlying tort doctrines as well as
demonstrate  how  these  doctrines  impact  litigants  seeking  justice
in the courtroom — the modern practice of tort law. Key concepts
like  the  desire  to  compensate  worthy  victims,  to  punish

wrongdoers, and to deter future harm can be seen throughout the
many  tort  concepts  you  will  study  in  this  book.  Look  for  these
themes  particularly  when  courts  face  difﬁcult  choices  between
competing doctrines.

While  understanding  core  concepts  and  their  application
should  strike  you  as  worthy  goals,  your  primary  concern  as  you
embark  on  this  journey  may  be  more  practical.  How  do  I  read
these  cases?  How  do  I  prepare  my  case  briefs?  How  do  I  avoid
getting  embarrassed  on  the  ﬁrst  day  of  class  when  I  hear  my
professor call my name? Although the above materials attempt to
help  answer  some  of  these  questions  with  detailed  information,
the  best  advice  is  simply  to  pour  yourself  into  the  academic
inquiry. Try to absorb the law at both the macro and micro levels
— be  able  to  restate  the  elements  of  each  tort  cause  of  action
quickly  but,  even  more  importantly,  be  prepared  to  explain  the
thought behind each of these elements. This will all take practice.
Be patient with yourself and pay close attention to your professor.
She  has  spent  considerable  time  absorbing  the  material.  Most
importantly,  enjoy  the  learning  process.  Law  school  should  be  a
fascinating entry to your new, chosen profession.

I  OVERVIEW

Many  torts  classes  begin  with  a  study  of  a  category  of  tort  claims
entitled “intentional torts.” And this book will do likewise. This chapter
will  explore  many  of  the  classic  intentional  tort  claims.  These
stalwarts of tort law include battery, assault, false imprisonment, and
trespass.  Another  important,  though  relatively  new,  tort  cause  of
action  will  also  be  covered  in  this  chapter — intentional  infliction  of
emotional distress.

II  BATTERY

A. Introduction

Battery  is  a  classic  intentional  tort.  You  have  probably  heard  the
phrase “assault and battery.” Assault is technically a different, though
related, tort from battery. You will need to learn how they are related
but  separate.  Battery  is  designed  to  protect  our  bodily  integrity;  that
is,  our  right  to  be  free  from  certain  unwanted  physical  contacts.  We
are daily faced with physical contacts from others, most of which are
desired, unnoticed, or harmless. But certain other contacts might be
physically  harmful  to  us  or  unpleasant  and  disagreeable.  The  tort  of
battery  recognizes  that  we  are  entitled  to  some  level  of  autonomy
over  our  own  bodies.  It  provides  redress  where  that  autonomy  is
violated  in  certain  ways.  Pay  close  attention  to  the  elements  of  this
cause  of  action  as  you  read  the  next  set  of  cases.  Also  remember
that  the  same  notion  of  autonomy  that  gives  rise  to  a  tort  claim  for
battery  when  we  are  subjected  to  unwanted  contacts,  also
necessarily  gives  rise  to  the  consent  defense  where  we  have
permitted  contacts  to  occur,  even  where  they  later  turn  out  to  be
harmful. The separate defense of consent is covered along with other
defenses to intentional torts in the next chapter.

B. Intent

The  elements  of  a  civil  cause  of  action  are  those  things  that  the
plaintiff bears the burden of proving that are considered essential to
the claim. If any element is lacking, the plaintiff’s cause of action fails.
You  might  consider  the  elements  of  a  tort  claim  to  be  analogous  to
the necessary ingredients in a recipe. Leaving out one key ingredient

means that you have not succeeded in preparing your dish. For each
tort cause of action, you should look within the case opinions you are
reading  for  some  indication  of  the  elements  or  key  ingredients.  In
most  of  the  cases  the  parties  are  disputing  whether  the  factual
record supports the existence of a particular element.

As  already  mentioned,  every

intentional  tort  claim  requires
something speciﬁc to be intended. How courts interpret and apply the
word “intent” in the context of intentional torts is not entirely intuitive
for  law  students.  Battery  is  an  intentional  tort  and  our  ﬁrst  case  will
begin  to  delineate  what  is  meant  in  tort  law  by  the  word  intent.  One
meaning — a  desire  to  bring  about  a  certain  result — is  the  deﬁnition
of  intent  you  have  used  in  your  pre-law  school  life.  There  is  an
additional deﬁnition that might surprise you. The Garratt case below
discusses these two traditional meanings of the word “intent.” These
dual  meanings  apply  with  equal  force  to  any  intentional  tort  claim.
involve  something
Thus,  while  different
different being intended, once you grasp the concept of intent you will
be equipped to analyze any intentional tort. With respect to the claim
for battery, begin to focus upon what exactly must be intended. This
will  be  a  subject  revisited  within  this  section,  as  the  ﬁnal  case  on
battery — White v. Muniz — will come back and provide an important
ﬁnal clariﬁcation.

intentional  tort  claims

GARRATT v. DAILEY
270 P.2d 1091 (Wash. 1955)

    , J.

The liability of an infant for an alleged battery is presented to this
court for the ﬁrst time. Brian Dailey (age ﬁve years, nine months) was
visiting with Naomi Garratt, an adult and a sister of the plaintiff, Ruth
Garratt,  likewise  an  adult,  in  the  backyard  of  the  plaintiff’s  home,  on
July  16,  1951.  It  is  plaintiff’s  contention  that  she  came  out  into  the

backyard to talk with Naomi and that, as she started to sit down in a
wood  and  canvas  lawn  chair,  Brian  deliberately  pulled  it  out  from
under her. The only one of the three persons present so testifying was
Naomi Garratt. (Ruth Garratt, the plaintiff, did not testify as to how or
why  she  fell.)  The  trial  court,  unwilling  to  accept  this  testimony,
adopted  instead  Brian  Dailey’s  version  of  what  happened,  and  made
the following ﬁndings:

III.  .  .  .  that  while  Naomi  Garratt  and  Brian  Dailey  were  in  the  back  yard  the
plaintiff,  Ruth  Garratt,  came  out  of  her  house  into  the  back  yard.  Some  time
subsequent  thereto  defendant,  Brian  Dailey,  picked  up  a  lightly  built  wood  and
canvas  lawn  chair  which  was  then  and  there  located  in  the  back  yard  of  the
above  described  premises,  moved  it  sideways  a  few  feet  and  seated  himself
therein, at which time he discovered the plaintiff, Ruth Garratt, about to sit down
at the place where the lawn chair had formerly been, at which time he hurriedly
got up from the chair and attempted to move it toward Ruth Garratt to aid her in
sitting  down  in  the  chair;  that  due  to  the  defendant’s  small  size  and  lack  of
dexterity  he  was  unable  to  get  the  lawn  chair  under  the  plaintiff  in  time  to
prevent  her  from  falling  to  the  ground.  That  plaintiff  fell  to  the  ground  and
sustained  a  fracture  of  her  hip,  and  other  injuries  and  damages  as  hereinafter
set forth.

IV.  That  the  preponderance  of  the  evidence  in  this  case  establishes  that
when the defendant, Brian Dailey, moved the chair in question he did not have
any wilful or unlawful purpose in doing so; that he did not have any intent to
injure the plaintiff, or any intent to bring about any unauthorized or offensive
contact  with  her  person  or  any  objects  appurtenant  thereto;  that  the
circumstances which immediately preceded the fall of the plaintiff established
that  the  defendant,  Brian  Dailey,  did  not  have  purpose,  intent  or  design  to
perform  a  prank  or  to  effect  an  assault  and  battery  upon  the  person  of  the
plaintiff. (Italics ours, for a purpose hereinafter indicated.)

It  is  conceded  that  Ruth  Garratt’s  fall  resulted  in  a  fractured  hip
and  other  painful  and  serious  injuries.  To  obviate  the  necessity  of  a
retrial  in  the  event  this  court  determines  that  she  was  entitled  to  a
judgment against Brian Dailey, the amount of her damage was found
to  be  eleven  thousand  dollars.  Plaintiff  appeals  from  a  judgment

dismissing  the  action  and  asks  for  the  entry  of  a  judgment  in  that
amount or a new trial.

The authorities generally, but with certain notable exceptions (See
Bohlen, “Liability in Tort of Infants and Insane Persons,” 23 Mich. L.
Rev. 9), state that, when a minor has committed a tort with force, he
is liable to be proceeded against as any other person would be. Paul
v. Hummel  (1868),  43  Mo.  119,  97  Am.  Dec.  381;  Huchting  v.  Engel
(1863), 17 Wis. 237, 84 Am. Dec. 741; Briese v. Mæchtle (1911), 146
Wis. 89, 130 N. W. 893; 1 Cooley on Torts (4th ed.) 194, §66; Prosser
on  Torts  1085,  §108;  2  Kent’s  Commentaries  241;  27  Am.  Jur.  812,
Infants, §90.

In  our  analysis  of  the  applicable  law,  we  start  with  the  basic
premise  that  Brian,  whether  ﬁve  or  ﬁfty-ﬁve,  must  have  committed
some wrongful act before he could be liable for appellant’s injuries.

It  is  urged  that  Brian’s  action  in  moving  the  chair  constituted  a
battery. A deﬁnition (not all-inclusive but sufﬁcient for our purpose) of
a battery is the intentional infliction of a harmful bodily contact upon
another.  The  rule  that  determines  liability  for  battery  is  given  in  1
Restatement, Torts, 29, §13, as:

An act which, directly or indirectly, is the legal cause of a harmful contact

with another’s person makes the actor liable to the other, if

(a)  the  act  is  done  with  the  intention  of  bringing  about  a  harmful  or

offensive contact to the other, and

(b) the contact is not consented to by the other [or the other’s consent

thereto is procured by fraud or duress], and

(c) the contact is not otherwise privileged.

We  have  in  this  case  no  question  of  consent  or  privilege.  We
therefore  proceed  to  an  immediate  consideration  of  intent  and  its
place  in  the  law  of  battery.  In  the  comment  on  clause  (a),  the
Restatement says:

Character  of  actor’s  intention.  In  order  that  an  act  may  be  done  with  the
intention of bringing about a harmful or offensive to a particular person the act

must be done for the purpose of causing the contact or apprehension or with
knowledge  on  the  part  of  the  actor  that  such  contact  or  apprehension  is
substantially certain to be produced.

We have here the conceded volitional act of Brian, i.e., the moving
of a chair. Had the plaintiff proved to the satisfaction of the trial court
that Brian moved the chair while she was in the act of sitting down,
Brian’s  action  would  patently  have  been  for  the  purpose  or  with  the
intent  of  causing  the  plaintiff’s  bodily  contact  with  the  ground,  and
she  would  be  entitled  to  a  judgment  against  him  for  the  resulting
damages.  Vosburg  v.  Putney  (1891),  80  Wis.  523,  50  N.  W.  403;
Briese v. Mæchtle, supra.

The plaintiff based her case on that theory, and the trial court held
that she failed in her proof and accepted Brian’s version of the facts
rather than that given by the eyewitness who testiﬁed for the plaintiff.
After the trial court determined that the plaintiff had not established
her  theory  of  a  battery  (i.e.,  that  Brian  had  pulled  the  chair  out  from
under  the  plaintiff  while  she  was  in  the  act  of  sitting  down),  it  then
became concerned with whether a battery was established under the
facts as it found them to be.

In  this  connection,  we  quote  another  portion  of  the  comment  on
the  “Character  of  actor’s  intention,”  relating  to  clause  (a)  of  the  rule
from the Restatement heretofore set forth:

It is not enough that the act itself is intentionally done and this, even though the
actor  realizes  or  should  realize  that  it  contains  a  very  grave  risk  of  bringing
about the contact. Such realization may make the actor’s conduct negligent or
even reckless but unless he realizes that to a substantial certainty, the contact
will  result,  the  actor  has  not  that  intention  which  is  necessary  to  make  him
liable under the rule stated in this Section.

A  battery  would  be  established  if,  in  addition  to  plaintiff’s  fall,  it
was  proved  that,  when  Brian  moved  the  chair,  he  knew  with
substantial  certainty  that  the  plaintiff  would  attempt  to  sit  down
where  the  chair  had  been.  If  Brian  had  any  of  the  intents  which  the

trial  court  found,  in  the  italicized  portions  of  the  ﬁndings  of  fact
quoted above, that he did not have, he would of course have had the
knowledge to which we have referred. The mere absence of any intent
to injure the plaintiff or to play a prank on her or to embarrass her, or
to commit an assault and battery on her would not absolve him from
liability if in fact he had such knowledge. Mercer v. Corbin (1889), 117
Ind.  450,  20  N.E.  132,  3  L.  R.A.  221.  Without  such  knowledge,  there
would be nothing wrongful about Brian’s act in moving the chair, and,
there being no wrongful act, there would be no liability.

While a ﬁnding that Brian had no such knowledge can be inferred
from the ﬁndings made, we believe that before the plaintiff’s action in
such  a  case  should  be  dismissed  there  should  be  no  question  but
that  the  trial  court  had  passed  upon  that  issue;  hence,  the  case
should  be  remanded  for  clariﬁcation  of  the  ﬁndings  to  speciﬁcally
cover  the  question  of  Brian’s  knowledge,  because  intent  could  be
inferred therefrom. If the court ﬁnds that he had such knowledge, the
necessary intent will be established and the plaintiff will be entitled to
recover, even though there was no purpose to injure or embarrass the
plaintiff.  Vosburg  v.  Putney,  supra.  If  Brian  did  not  have  such
knowledge, there was no wrongful act by him, and the basic premise
of liability on the theory of a battery was not established.

In Practice

children can be liable for torts
that they commit. More often
than not, however, a child does
not possess his own funds to
pay a tort judgment. A

had been, and to change the judgment if the ﬁndings warrant it.

Remanded for clariﬁcation.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Intent.   The  court’s  opinion  enumerates  the  elements  of  a
common law civil tort claim for battery. Which of these elements was
in dispute? The court describes two meanings to the word “intent” as
used  in  tort  law.  What  are  those  two  meanings?  Why  did  the  court
remand  the  case  to  the  trial  court?  If  you  were  the  attorney  for  the
plaintiff cross-examining Brian Garratt, what additional lines of inquiry
might you pursue to prove he had the requisite intent?

2.  Restatements.   The  court  found  certain  passages  from  the
Restatement of Torts persuasive in explaining the law of battery. The
Restatement of Torts is not a statute that is controlling on the courts.

It is written by scholars to try to explain common law principles as an
aid  to  courts  and  the  legal  profession.  Courts  are  free  to  accept  its
contents  or  reject  it,  and  there  are  many  examples  of  each  such
treatment.  The  Restatement  of  Torts  (Second)  has  been  highly
persuasive. A third version has appeared in print but has not yet been
as widely accepted by courts.

3. Problems.  In which of the following circumstances do you think
the  evidence  demonstrates  the  necessary  intent  to  be  liable  for
battery?

A. Tommy was a high school student who loved to play in the snow
but was not very athletic. One day as he was having a snowball
ﬁght  with  some  friends  by  the  side  of  a  highway,  he  noticed  a
car  coming  toward  him  with  the  driver’s  window  down.  On  an
impulsive  whim  he  decided  to  throw  a  snowball  at  the  driver,
assuming there was no way he could hit an open window on a
car driving so fast. To his surprise and horror, his snowball flew
through  the  car’s  open  window,  hit  the  driver  in  the  face  and
caused the car to crash into a tree.

B.  A  drunk  driver  was  speeding  through  a  school  zone  distracted
as  she  attempted  to  ﬁnd  better  tunes  on  the  radio,  when  she
struck a young child attempting to cross the street.

C. A pedestrian was walking on an elevated bridge that went over a
busy
interstate  highway  during  rush  hour  trafﬁc.  As  the
pedestrian  ﬁnished  drinking  his  bottled  beverage,  he
nonchalantly  tossed  it  over  the  bridge  railing.  It  fell  and  hit  a
motorist in a convertible, causing an irreparable eye injury.

WATERS v. BLACKSHEAR
591 N.E.2d 184 (Mass. 1992)

       , J.

On  June  6,  1987,  the  minor  defendant  placed  a  ﬁrecracker  in  the
left sneaker of the unsuspecting minor plaintiff Maurice Waters and lit
the  ﬁrecracker.  Maurice,  who  was  then  seven  years  old,  sustained
burn injuries. The defendant, also a minor, was somewhat older than
Maurice  [the  court  inferred  he  was  one  or  two  years  older].  The
defendant had been lighting ﬁrecrackers for about ten minutes before
the  incident,  not  holding  them  but  tossing  them  on  the  ground  and
watching them ignite, jump, and spin.

Maurice and his mother now seek recovery in this action solely on
the  theory  that  the  minor  defendant  was  negligent.  The  judge
instructed  the  jury,  in  terms  that  are  not  challenged  on  appeal,  that
the  plaintiffs  could  recover  only  if  the  defendant’s  act  was  not
intentional  or  purposeful  and  was  negligent.  The  jury  found  for  the
plaintiffs, and judgment was entered accordingly. The trial judge then
allowed  the  defendant’s  motion  for  judgment  notwithstanding  the
verdict  on  the  ground  that  the  evidence  showed  intentional  and  not
negligent  conduct.  We  allowed  the  plaintiffs’  application  for  direct
appellate review and now afﬁrm the judgment for the defendant.

We  start  with  the  established  principle  that  intentional  conduct
cannot  be  negligent  conduct  and  that  negligent  conduct  cannot  be
intentional conduct. Sabatinelli v. Butler, 363 Mass. 565, 567 (1973).
The only evidence of any conduct of the defendant on which liability
could be based, on any theory, is that the defendant intentionally put
a ﬁrecracker in one of Maurice’s sneakers and lit the ﬁrecracker.

difference between being
tripped over and being kicked.”

The intentional placing of the ﬁrecracker in Maurice’s sneaker and
the  intentional  lighting  of  the  ﬁrecracker  brought  about  a  harmful
contact  that  the  defendant  intended.  The  defendant  may  not  have
intended to cause the injuries that Maurice sustained. The defendant
may not have understood the seriousness of his conduct and all the
harm  that  might  result  from  it.  These  facts  are  not  signiﬁcant,
however, in determining whether the defendant committed a battery.
See  Horton  v.  Reaves,  186  Colo.  149,  155  (1974)  (“the  extent  of  the
resulting  harm  need  not  be  intended,  nor  even  foreseen”).  The  only
permissible  conclusion  on  the  uncontroverted  facts  is  that  the
defendant intended an unpermitted contact.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Legal Theory.  The plaintiff gets to choose which legal theory, or
theories, to pursue for her claim. That theory may or may not prevail.
In  this  case,  the  plaintiff  chose  to  pursue  a  theory  of  an  accidental
tort,  a  negligence  claim.  The  court  inferred  elsewhere  in  the  opinion
that  this  was  due  to  the  fact  that  the  defendant  had  an  insurance
policy that provided for coverage for accidents but not for intentional
torts. Plaintiff’s strategy was based upon the pragmatic consideration
that the defendant might not have sufﬁcient assets to recover against
other  than  a  potentially  applicable  insurance  policy.  The  court
rejected  the  attempt  to  apply  the  theory  of  negligence  because  the
court found that the defendant had, as a matter of law, committed an
intentional tort instead.

2. Liability for Unintended Results.  The court held that defendant
might  not  have  appreciated  or  intended  the  actual  full  results  of  his
conduct — the severity of the burns. Nevertheless, the court held that
his conduct would still constitute a battery. How does the court ﬁnd
that  he  had  the  requisite  intent  to  be  liable  on  an  intentional  tort
theory  even  though  the  actual  result  obtained  was  possibly
accidental?

3. Problem.  What would be the result in Waters if the ﬁrecracker
was  a  dud  and  failed  to  explode?  Obviously  this  would  reduce  the
damages  obtainable,  but  would  there  still  have  been  a  battery?
Consider the types of contacts that give rise to battery liability in light
of the cases below.

C. Offensive, Indirect, and Intangible Contacts

The  prior  cases  involve  claims  of  wrongful  conduct  that  resulted  in
harmful  contacts.  Courts  have  long  held,  however,  that  a  battery
would  be  recognized  where  the  resulting  contact  involved  offensive
contacts  as  well.  Even  if  the  actor  intends  an  offensive  contact  but
physical  harm  results,  liability  will  attach.  There  are  some  instances
where a contact might be characterized as either harmful or offensive
and  the  plaintiff’s  counsel  might  have  strategic  reasons  to
characterize  it  as  one  or  the  other.  Finally,  case  law  has  also
developed  around
involved  was
somewhat  intangible  or  indirect,  yet  still  harmful  or  offensive.
Consider the nature of each of the types of contacts in the following
three cases and whether it makes sense to hold the defendant liable
for battery in each instance.

FISHER v. CARROUSEL MOTOR HOTEL, INC.
424 S.W.2d 627 (Tex. 1967)

         , J.

This is a suit for actual and exemplary damages growing out of an
alleged . . . battery. The plaintiff Fisher was a mathematician with the
Data  Processing  Division  of  the  Manned  Spacecraft  Center,  an
agency  of  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Agency,  commonly
called NASA, near Houston. The defendants were the Carrousel Motor

Hotel, Inc., located in Houston, the Brass Ring Club, which is located
in  the  Carrousel,  and  Robert  W.  Flynn,  who  as  an  employee  of  the
Carrousel was the manager of the Brass Ring Club. Flynn died before
the  trial,  and  the  suit  proceeded  as  to  the  Carrousel  and  the  Brass
Ring. Trial was to a jury which found for the plaintiff Fisher. The trial
court  rendered  judgment  for  the  defendants  notwithstanding  the
verdict. The Court of Civil Appeals afﬁrmed. The question before this
Court [is] whether there was evidence that an actionable battery was
committed.

The  plaintiff  Fisher  had  been  invited  by  Ampex  Corporation  and
Defense  Electronics  to  a  one  day’s  meeting  regarding  telemetry
equipment  at  the  Carrousel.  The  invitation  included  a  luncheon.  The
guests  were  asked  to  reply  by  telephone  whether  they  could  attend
the luncheon, and Fisher called in his acceptance. After the morning
session,  the  group  of  25  or  30  guests  adjourned  to  the  Brass  Ring
Club for lunch. The luncheon was buffet style, and Fisher stood in line
with  others  and  just  ahead  of  a  graduate  student  of  Rice  University
who  testiﬁed  at  the  trial.  As  Fisher  was  about  to  be  served,  he  was
approached by Flynn, who snatched the plate from Fisher’s hand and
shouted  that  he,  a  Negro,  could  not  be  served  in  the  club.  Fisher
testiﬁed that he was not actually touched, and did not testify that he
suffered fear or apprehension of physical injury; but he did testify that
he  was  highly  embarrassed  and  hurt  by  Flynn’s  conduct  in  the
presence of his associates.

The  jury  found  that  Flynn  “forcibly  dispossessed  plaintiff  of  his
dinner plate” and “shouted in a loud and offensive manner” that Fisher
could  not  be  served  there,  thus  subjecting  Fisher  to  humiliation  and
indignity.  It  was  stipulated  that  Flynn  was  an  employee  of  the
Carrousel Hotel and, as such, managed the Brass Ring Club. The jury
also  found  that  Flynn  acted  maliciously  and  awarded  Fisher  $400
actual damages for his humiliation and indignity and $500 exemplary
damages for Flynn’s malicious conduct.

The  Court  of  Civil  Appeals  held  that  there  was  no  [battery]
because  there  was  no  physical  contact.  However,  it  has  long  been
settled . . . that actual physical contact is not necessary to constitute
a battery, so long as there is contact with clothing or an object closely
identiﬁed  with  the  body.  1  Harper  &  James,  The  Law  of  Torts  216
(1956);  Restatement  of  Torts  2d,  §§18  and  19.  In  Prosser,  Law  of
Torts 32 (3d Ed. 1964), it is said:

The  interest  in  freedom  from  intentional  and  unpermitted  contacts  with  the
plaintiff’s person is protected by an action for the tort commonly called battery.
The protection extends to any part of the body, or to anything which is attached
to it and practically identiﬁed with it. Thus contact with the plaintiff’s clothing, or
with a cane, a paper, or any other object held in his hand will be sufﬁcient. . . .
The  plaintiff’s  interest  in  the  integrity  of  his  person  includes  all  those  things
which are in contact or connected with it.

Under the facts of this case, we have no difﬁculty in holding that
the  intentional  grabbing  of  plaintiff’s  plate  constituted  a  battery.  The
intentional  snatching  of  an  object  from  one’s  hand  is  as  clearly  an
offensive  invasion  of  his  person  as  would  be  an  actual  contact  with
the body. “To constitute an assault and battery, it is not necessary to
touch the plaintiff’s body or even his clothing; knocking or snatching
anything  from  plaintiff’s  hand  or  touching  anything  connected  with
his person, when done in an offensive manner, is sufﬁcient.” Morgan
v. Loyacomo, 1 So. 2d 510 (Miss. 1941).

Such  holding  is  not  unique  to  the  jurisprudence  of  this  State.  In
S.H. Kress & Co. v. Brashier,  50  S.W.2d  922  (Tex.  Civ.  App.  1932,  no
writ),  the  defendant  was  held  to  have  committed  “an  assault  and
trespass  upon  the  person”  by  snatching  a  book  from  the  plaintiff’s
hand.  The  jury  ﬁndings  in  that  case  were  that  the  defendant
“dispossessed  plaintiff  of  the  book”  and  caused  her  to  suffer
“humiliation and indignity.”

The rationale for holding an offensive contact with such an object
to  be  a  battery  is  explained  in  1  Restatement  of  Torts  2d  §18
(Comment p. 31) as follows:

Since  the  essence  of  the  plaintiff’s  grievance  consists  in  the  offense  to  the
dignity involved in the unpermitted and intentional invasion of the inviolability of
his  person  and  not  in  any  physical  harm  done  to  his  body,  it  is  not  necessary
that  the  plaintiff’s  actual  body  be  disturbed.  Unpermitted  and  intentional
contacts  with  anything  so  connected  with  the  body  as  to  be  customarily
regarded  as  part  of  the  other’s  person  and  therefore  as  partaking  of  its
inviolability  is  actionable  as  an  offensive  contact  with  his  person.  There  are
some things such as clothing or a cane or, indeed, anything directly grasped by
the hand which are so intimately connected with one’s body as to be universally
regarded as part of the person.

We  hold,  therefore,  that  the  forceful  dispossession  of  plaintiff
Fisher’s  plate  in  an  offensive  manner  was  sufﬁcient  to  constitute  a
battery, and the trial court erred in granting judgment notwithstanding
the verdict on the issue of actual damages.

Damages  for  mental  suffering  are  recoverable  without  the
necessity for showing actual physical injury in a case of willful battery
because  the  basis  of  that  action  is  the  unpermitted  and  intentional
invasion of the plaintiff’s person and not the actual harm done to the
plaintiff’s body. Restatement of Torts 2d §18. Personal indignity is the
essence  of  an  action  for  battery;  and  consequently  the  defendant  is
liable  not  only  for  contacts  which  do  actual  physical  harm,  but  also
for those which are offensive and insulting. Prosser, supra; Wilson v.
Orr,  97  So.  133  (Ala.  1923).  We  hold,  therefore,  that  plaintiff  was
entitled  to  actual  damages  for  mental  suffering  due  to  the  willful
battery, even in the absence of any physical injury.

The judgments of the courts below are reversed, and judgment is
here rendered for the plaintiff for $900 with interest from the date of
the trial court’s judgment, and for costs of this suit.

RICHARDSON v. HENNLY
434 S.E.2d 772 (Ga. 1993)

     , J.

[Plaintiff Bonnie Richardson ﬁled suit against her former employer
and a co-worker alleging battery. The co-worker, J.R. Hennly, Jr., was
successful  in  obtaining  a  summary  judgment  in  the  trial  court.
Plaintiff appeals from that order.]

The  record  reveals  that  Richardson  had  been  working  as  a
receptionist  at  First  Federal  for  a  number  of  years  when  Hennly,  an
administrative  ofﬁcer,  began  working  at  her  branch.  Richardson’s
work station was in the lobby of First Federal, and Hennly worked in
an  ofﬁce  approximately  30  feet  from  her  desk.  Hennly  had  been  a
pipe smoker for a number of years, and continued to smoke his pipe
at  work.  Richardson  immediately  began  to  have  difﬁculty  with
Hennly’s pipe smoke, to which she apparently had an allergic reaction
that  caused  nausea,  stomach  pain,  loss  of  appetite,  loss  of  weight,
headaches,  and  anxiety.  She  discussed  this  problem  with  her
superiors,  and  several  air  cleaners  were  purchased,  which  were
placed in the interior of Hennly’s ofﬁce and adjacent to his door. For a
time Hennly switched to cigarettes, which did not bother Richardson
as much, but he resumed smoking his pipe, stating that he wished to
avoid  becoming  addicted  to  cigarettes.  Richardson  was  twice
hospitalized  because  of  her  adverse  reactions.  Shortly  after
Richardson  returned  to  work  from  her  second  hospitalization  her
employment was terminated, primarily for excessive absenteeism.

In  opposition  to  the  motion  for  summary  judgment  Richardson
presented  medical  evidence  attributing  her  adverse  reactions  to  the
pipe smoke. This evidence was not rebutted. It is uncontroverted that
Hennly  was  aware  of  Richardson’s  adverse  reactions  to  his  pipe
smoke  and  that  she  was  twice  hospitalized.  The  evidence  is  in
conflict  regarding  whether  Hennly  ever  smoked  anywhere  at  work
other  than  in  his  ofﬁce;  whether  he  intentionally  smoked  around
Richardson to annoy her; and whether he made teasing or offensive
remarks regarding his smoking.

Hennly moved for summary judgment as to Richardson’s claim of
battery  on  the  ground  that  pipe  smoke  is  an  immaterial  substance

incapable  of  battering  another.  Richardson  maintains  the  trial  court
erred by granting partial summary judgment to Hennly on this claim.

Our courts have recognized an interest in the inviolability of one’s
person  and,  along  with  most  other  jurisdictions  have  followed  the
common  law  rule  that  any  unlawful  touching  is  actionable  as  a
battery. Haile v. Pittman, 389 S.E.2d 564 (Ga. 1989). Such a cause of
action will lie even in the absence of direct physical contact between
the  actor  and  the  injured  party:  “‘The  unlawful  touching  need  not  be
direct, but may be indirect, as by the precipitation upon the body of a
person  of  any  material  substance.’”  Hendricks  v.  Southern  Bell  Tel.
&c. Co., 387 S.E.2d 593 (Ga. 1989).

We  note  that  Richardson  has  not  alleged  that  any  or  all  smoke
with  which  she  came  into  contact  would  constitute  battery.  Instead,
she has alleged that Hennly, knowing it would cause her to suffer an
injurious  reaction,  intentionally  and  deliberately  directed  his  pipe
smoke at her in order to injure her or with conscious disregard of the
knowledge that it would do so. We decline to hold that this allegation
must fail as a matter of law. We are not prepared to accept Hennly’s
argument  that  pipe  smoke  is  a  substance  so  immaterial  that  it  is
incapable of being used to batter indirectly. Pipe smoke is visible; it is
detectable  through  the  senses  and  may  be  ingested  or  inhaled.  It  is
capable  of  “touching”  or  making  contact  with  one’s  person  in  a
number  of  ways.  Since  no  other  element  of  the  tort  has  been
conclusively negated, Hennly has not shown as a matter of law that
he  is  entitled  to  judgment.  Moreover,  a  jury  question  remains
regarding  whether  Hennly  actually  directed  his  pipe  smoke  at
Richardson.  We  conclude  .  .  .  the  trial  court  erred  in  granting
summary judgment in favor of Hennly on the battery claim.

EICHENWALD v. RIVELLO
318 F. Supp.3d 766 (D. Md. 2018)

      , J.

Plaintiff  Kurt  Eichenwald  brought  this  action  against  Defendant
John  Rivello  on  April  24,  2017.  Defendant  is  facing  criminal  charges
related to the same incident underlying this civil case. [Defendant has
responded to portions of Plaintiff’s complaint by moving to dismiss.]
Defendant’s  characterization  of  Texas  law  regarding  civil  battery  is
incorrect.

Plaintiff  is  a  journalist  and  author  currently  living  in  Texas.
Plaintiff’s  work  is  well  known.  He  writes  for  Newsweek  and  Vanity
Fair.  He  worked  for  years  at  the  New  York  Times,  has  authored  four
books, and has won several awards including the George Polk Award
(twice).  He  is  an  active  Twitter  user,  having  posted  over  50,000
tweets.

Plaintiff  also  has  epilepsy.  He  was  diagnosed  at  age  18,  and
“suffered  from  frequent  seizures  as  a  young  adult.”  Medication  has
helped reduce the number of seizures, but he continues to experience
them. Plaintiff has been public about his condition in the past and in
2016  wrote  an  article,  published  in  Newsweek,  titled  “Sean  Hannity:
Apologize to Those with Epilepsy, or Burn in Hell.”

During  the  2016  election,  Plaintiff  was  often  critical  of  then-
candidate Donald J. Trump, and expressed those views in his writing
and on his Twitter account. Plaintiff “received numerous threats and
messages  over  the  Internet”  as  a  result  of  his  public  criticism,  and
wrote about the online abuse for Newsweek in October 2016. In that
article,  Plaintiff  wrote  about  one  instance  of  online  harassment  in
particular.  Plaintiff  “received  a  tweet  from  someone  with  the  twitter
handle  ‘Mike’s  Deplorable  AF.’”  In  that  tweet  “Mike  made  mention  of
[Plaintiff’s] seizures and included a small video. The video was some
sort of strobe light, with flashing circles and images . . . flying toward
the  screen.”  The  video  was  “epileptogenic,”  meaning  it  “triggers
seizures.”  Plaintiff  did  not  suffer  a  seizure  upon  opening  this  video,
however, because he quickly dropped the device.

tweet

Two months later, on December 15, 2016, a Twitter user with the
handle  @jew_goldstein,  replied  to  one  of  Plaintiff’s  tweets.  When
Plaintiff “clicked on the notiﬁcation button on twitter,” the replies to his
tweet “immediately loaded,” including the reply from @jew_goldstein.

Interchange Format (“GIF”) that contained “an animated strobe image

POSTS.”  Upon  seeing  the  rapidly  flashing  GIF,  “Plaintiff  suffered  a

included

(and

For  reasons  that  will  become  clear,  it  is  necessary  to  briefly
discuss  the  physical  reactions  that  led  to  Plaintiff’s  seizure.  Light
comes in rays, or waves, comprised in part by photons. These waves
sometimes  reflect  off  objects  and  “strike  a  person’s  cornea,”  which
“focuses  the  light  wave.”  The  eye  focuses  the  wave  onto  its  retina,
which  through  a  process  of  “visual  phototransduction,”  converts  the
light wave into electrical impulses. That is, photons hit the retina and
are converted into electrical signals. These electrical signals are then
transmitted  by  the  optic  nerve  to  the  visual  cortex.  Such  electrical
signals  from  strobing
in  certain
individuals with epilepsy.” So, Defendant intentionally caused photons
to hit Plaintiff’s retina, causing Plaintiff to suffer a seizure.

images  “can  trigger  seizures

Plaintiff’s wife witnessed the seizure and, after caring for Plaintiff,
called the police. According to information obtained as a result of the
criminal investigation, Defendant, who lives in Maryland, operated the
@jew_goldstein account. Defendant discussed with others his intent
to  harm  Plaintiff  by  causing  a  seizure.  Defendant  was  arrested  on
March 17, 2017, and three days later a grand jury indicted him for the
offense of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

Plaintiff  continued  to  suffer  as  a  result  of  the  December  15
seizure.  He  experienced  another  seizure  in  his  sleep,  and  he  had  to
take  increased  medication,  which  left  him  sedated  and  disabled
during  the  holidays.  He  “required  assistance  from  his  family  to

perform routine tasks,” and was “embarrassed, humiliated, and deeply
upset,” as a result of this incident.

With  the  criminal  case  against  Defendant  still  pending,  Plaintiff
ﬁled a civil case against Defendant in this Court [including a claim for
battery. Defendant ﬁled a motion to dismiss the battery claim] and the
Court will turn now to its disposition.

The  Court  has  jurisdiction  over  this  matter  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.
in
§1332,  because  the  parties  are  diverse  and  the  amount
controversy  is  over  $75,000.  In  diversity  actions,  a  district  court
applies  the  substantive  law  and  choice  of  law  rules  of  the  state  in
which  the  court  sits.  The  Court  will  therefore  apply  Maryland  choice
of  law  rules.  “The  rule  of  lex  loci  delicti  is  well  established  in
Maryland,”  and  under  that  rule,  the  substantive  tort  law  of  the  state
where  the  wrong  occurs  governs.  Plaintiff  has  alleged  that  he  was
harmed  in  Texas,  and  therefore  the  Court  will  apply  the  substantive
tort law of Texas in analyzing Plaintiff’s claims.

Defendant  has  moved  to  dismiss  [the  battery  claim  contending,
among other things that] Plaintiff’s claim of battery fails because he
has not alleged any physical contact. “[A] battery is redress for actual
harmful,  or  offensive,  touchings.”  [U]nder  Texas  law  a  plaintiff  can
assert a cause of action for common law battery, i.e. for intentionally
caus[ing]  bodily
[But]  Defendant  argues  that  Plaintiff’s
allegations  do  not  amount  to  a  civil  battery  under  Texas  law.  The
Court disagrees.

injury.

It is alleged that Defendant purposely acted to violate the dignity
and health of the Plaintiff and did in fact so harm him. The novelty of
the  mechanism  by  which  the  harm  was  achieved  does  not  make
those  actions  any  less  a  tort.  [I]n  Texas,  a  battery  is  the  intentional
causing  of  a  bodily  injury,  or  intentionally  causing  physical  contact
with  another  when  the  person  knows  that  the  other  will  regard  the
contact  as  offensive  or  provocative.  A  battery  undoubtedly  requires
some physical contact. In a battery case, if the defendant establishes

the  lack  of  physical  contact,  then  he  successfully  eliminates  an
essential  element  of  the  cause  of  action.  It  is  similarly  well-
established  that  the  physical  contact  need  not  be  with  the  physical
body  of  the  plaintiff,  see,  e.g.,  Fisher  v.  Carrousel  Motor  Hotel,  Inc.,
424 S.W.2d 627, 629 (Tex. 1967) (grabbing a person’s plate in buffet
line constituted a battery); and it need not be direct physical contact,
see  Hutchison  v.  Brookshire  Bros.,  Ltd.,  284  F.  Supp.  2d  459,  475
(E.D. Tex. 2003) (“For Defendant to cause Plaintiff to be touched does
not require that Defendant himself actually touch Plaintiff.”); Prosser §
9 n.16 (citing examples such as “operating car so as to throw plaintiff
from running board”). So, in order for a battery to occur, there must be
some  physical  contact  between  something  and  the  plaintiff  or
something attached to the plaintiff.

If a person intentionally causes another to come into contact with
a  harmful  physical  element,  that  is  a  battery  under  Texas  law.  In
Hutchison,  for  example,  the  plaintiff  alleged  that  a  store  owner  had
asked a police ofﬁcer to force the plaintiff to siphon gasoline from the
plaintiff’s  car  (plaintiff  had  accidentally  over-pumped).  The  Court
found  that  because  a  reasonable  jury  could  conclude  that  the  store
owner  knew  the  ofﬁcer  would  force  plaintiff  to  siphon  the  gas,  the
plaintiff’s  battery  claim  survived  summary  judgment.  In  Villegas-
Hernandez, the Fifth Circuit stated that the injury caused in a battery
“could  result  from  any  number  of  acts  [such  as]  making  available  to
the victim a poisoned drink while reassuring him the drink is safe, or
telling  the  victim  he  can  safely  back  his  car  out  while  knowing  an
approaching car . . . will hit the victim.” 468 F.3d at 879.

Here,  Plaintiff  generally  alleges  that  Defendant

intentionally
caused Plaintiff to come into contact with a harmful physical element
(i.e.,  the  strobe  GIF),  and  that  is  a  battery  under  Texas  law.  It  is
alleged  that  Defendant  knew  that  Plaintiff  would  see  the  GIF,  knew
that its physical properties would cause him a seizure, and knew that
a  seizure  would  be  physically  harmful,  or  at  least  offensive  or
provocative.  Not  only  did  Defendant  know  these  things,  Plaintiff

intended  the  exact  harmful  result  that

Defendant’s  concern  focuses  on  the  medium  of  the  contact,
asserting that “there is no allegation in the Complaint of any physical
contact  between  Plaintiff  and  Defendant.”  But  there  is.  Plaintiff  has
alleged  that  light  waves  emitted  from  the  GIF  touched  Plaintiff’s
retina, generated an electric signal, and caused a seizure. Taking, as
including  his
the  Court  must,  Plaintiff’s  allegations  as  true,
characterization  of  the  science  and  Plaintiff’s  physical  condition,
there  was  physical  contact.  Such  contact  can  often  be  of  an
amorphous nature; it is not always accomplished by means of a solid,
graspable object. For example, courts around the country have found
that second-hand smoke (i.e., causing a person to come into contact
with  harmful  smoke)  can  constitute  a  battery.  In  Leichtman  v.  WLW
Jacor Communications, Inc., 634 N.E.2d 697 (Ohio Ct. App. 1994), the
court  stated  that  “tobacco  smoke,  as  particulate  matter,  has  the
physical  properties  capable  of  making  contact.”  Even  less  tangible
than  smoke  is  sound.  Yet,  a  court  in  Georgia  found  a  battery  where
the tortfeasor made a loud noise over the phone in order to harm the
victim. See Hendricks v. S. Bell. Tel. & Tel. Co., 387 S.E.2d 593, 594-
95  (Ga.  App.  1989).  This  Court  has  stated  in  a  prior  case,  applying
Maryland  law,  that  “it  is  not  unreasonable  to  infer  that  causing  an
electrical shock to someone may be regarded as a battery whether or
not  [the  tortfeasor]  ever  laid  a  hand  on  [the  victim].”  Carter  v.
Maryland, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 171226, (D. Md. 2012).

Defendant  here  allegedly  chose  to  use  the  electronic  capabilities
of a computer as a weapon — as a means of causing physical harm.
Defendant’s  tweet,  activating  certain  harmful  capabilities  of  the
transmitting  computer,  converted  the  computer  into  a  weapon  to
inflict  physical  injury.  The  computer  and  the  tweet  were  no  longer
merely  a  mode  of  communication.  Something  more,  and  separate,
from  mere  communication  occurred  .  .  .  an  offensive  touching.  The
physical  element  that  Defendant  caused  to  come  into  contact  with

Plaintiff was something entirely outside either party’s mind. It was not
words or pictures that would require conscious interpretation (i.e.  an
internal process) to cause an impact. The strobe GIF was a physical
tool,  one  that  would  have  the  same  impact  on  any  person  with
Plaintiff’s  condition.  It  would  not  have  mattered  if  the  GIF  had
displayed hateful words, words of kindness, certain colors or pictures,
or  only  abstractions.  What  mattered  was  the  physical  nature  of  the
light  emitted  from  the  GIF.  The  light,  and  not  the  emotional  or
intellectual impact of any accompanying message, caused a seizure,
and it would not have caused a seizure if viewed by a person without
epilepsy,  regardless  of  whether  they  interpreted  the  tweet  as  mean-
spirited, frightening, or friendly.

To  be  sure,  Plaintiff  has  not  presented  the  Court  with  a  case  in
which  a  court  found  a  battery  under  the  circumstances  presented
here. And the Court has found none. But the Court also has not found
any  case  establishing  that  the  use  of  a  laser-beam,  or  a  sonic
weapon,  constitutes  a  battery.  Yet  if  a  person  used  a  laser  to
intentionally  blind  another,  or  a  sonic  weapon  to  intentionally  cause
permanent hearing loss, the Court is conﬁdent that a court would ﬁnd
a battery, even though the contact at issue was “only” a beam of light
or a sound wave. That no case exists where a plaintiff was harmed by
an epileptogenic GIF in a tweet is neither troubling nor surprising. The
broad sweep of tort precedents provides ﬁrm ground on which to ﬁnd
that this unique fact pattern, if proven, qualiﬁes as “battery.”

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Harmful  vs.  Offensive  Contacts  Deﬁned.   The  cases  in  the
preceding  section  involved  harmful  or  offensive  contacts.  Harmful
contacts are deﬁned by the Restatement as “any physical impairment
of  the  condition  of  another’s  body,  or  physical  pain  or  illness.”
Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts  §16.  This  is  a  fairly  easy  test  for

evaluating  whether  the  resulting  contact  qualiﬁes  for  a  battery.
Except  in  cases  where  the  only  claimed  harm  is  the  plaintiff’s
experience  of  pain,  most  harmful  contacts  are  conﬁrmed  through
objective  evidence  of  the  harm — the  bruised  knee,  the  cut  on  the
arm,  the  black  eye,  the  missing  limb,  the  burnt  skin,  or  the  gunshot
wound. The test for an offensive contact is easily stated but tends to
cause  a  bit  more  controversy  in  terms  of  its  application.  The  test  is
considered  to  be  objective  rather  than  subjective,  because  it  is
generally  insufﬁcient  if  the  only  person  to  consider  the  contact
offensive  is  the  plaintiff.  The  Restatement  indicates  a  contact  is
offensive  only  if  it  “offends  a  reasonable  sense  of  dignity.”  The
comments add that:

In  order  that  a  contact  be  offensive  to  a  reasonable  sense  of
personal  dignity,  it  must  be  one  which  would  offend  the  ordinary
person  and  as  such  one  not  unduly  sensitive  as  to  his  personal
dignity.  It  must,  therefore,  be  a  contact  which  is  unwarranted  by
the  social  usages  prevalent  at  the  time  and  place  at  which  it  is
inflicted.

Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts  §19,  cmt.  a  (1965).  Under  these
standards,  would  the  contact  involved  in  the  preceding  cases  meet
the  test  for  a  harmful  or  offensive  contact,  or  both?  As  the  courts
have held, a battery can also be established by proof that the contact
was offensive rather than harmful. Further, the Fisher court held that
a battery was possible even with no actual physical contact with the
plaintiff so long as contact occurred with an object closely associated
and connected with the plaintiff. Can you imagine any contacts that
might constitute both harmful and offensive contacts?

2.  Indirect  and  Intangible  Contacts.   Deciding  that  smoke  has
physical properties and is capable of touching someone, the court in
in
Hennley  permitted  a  potential  recovery.  Similarly,  the  court
Eichenwald  recognized  a  battery  claim  from  a  light  wave  in  a  GIF

transmitted  over  Twitter.  Is  there  any  risk  of  recognizing  such
intangible  contacts  as  sufﬁcient  to  impose  battery  liability?  What
about  breathing  on  another  person?  While  imposing  liability  for
blowing smoke may seem a fair result in one case, do you recognize
how expanding the tort in this manner creates uncertainty in terms of
intangible  contacts?  Is  this
the  potential  application  to  other
uncertainty  and  lack  of  predictability  an  acceptable  price  to  pay  for
reaching what seems to be a fair result in one case?

3. Problems.  Would the following contacts give rise to a claim for
battery, assuming the other elements were satisﬁed? Might there be
circumstances that might change your opinion?

A. Being spit upon.

D. Scope of Liability for Battery

We  have  already  seen  in  the  Waters  v.  Blackshear  case  that  courts
will hold intentional tortfeasors liable even where the harm is greater
in  degree  from  that  which  was  originally  intended.  A  slightly  more
difﬁcult question is whether liability for a battery will result when the
nature  of  the  contact  intended  is  qualitatively  different  from  that
which actually occurs as a consequence of the defendant’s action. In
such an instance, does it even make sense to consider application of
an  intentional  tort  theory  rather  than  an  accidental  tort  such  as
negligence? The following case tackles this problem.

NELSON v. CARROLL
735 A.2d 1096 (Md. Ct. App. 1999)

        , J.

This case requires that we determine the extent to which a claim
of accident may provide a defense to a civil action for battery arising
out  of  a  gunshot  wound.  Charles  A.  Nelson,  the  plaintiff  in  this
case  .  .  .  asserts  that  the  trial  court  should  have  held  Albert
Carroll . . . liable for the tort of battery as a matter of law, sending to
the jury only the issue of damages. We agree with Nelson that a claim
of  “accident”  provides  no  defense  to  a  battery  claim  where  the
evidence  is  undisputed  that  Nelson  was  shot  by  Carroll  as  Carroll
threatened and struck him on the side of his head with the handgun.

[The court summarized the facts as follows:]
Carroll shot Nelson in the stomach in the course of an altercation
over a debt owed to Carroll by Nelson. The shooting occurred on the
evening of July 25, 1992, in a private nightclub in Baltimore City that
Nelson  was  patronizing.  Carroll,  who  was  described  as  being  a  ‘little
tipsy,’  entered  the  club  and  demanded  repayment  by  Nelson  of  the
$3,800  balance  of  an  $8,000  loan  that  Carroll  had  made  to  Nelson.
Nelson immediately offered to make a payment on account but that
was  unsatisfactory  to  Carroll.  At  some  point  Carroll  produced  a
handgun from his jacket.

Carroll  did  not  testify.  There  were  only  two  witnesses  who
described how the shooting came about, Nelson and Prestley Dukes
(Dukes), a witness called by Carroll. Dukes testiﬁed that when Nelson
did  not  give  Carroll  his  money  Carroll  hit  Nelson  on  the  side  of  the
head  with  the  handgun  and  that,  when  Nelson  did  not  ‘respond,’
Carroll ‘went to hit him again, and when [Carroll] drawed back, the gun
went  off.’  Nelson,  in  substance,  testiﬁed  that  he  tendered  $2,300  to
Carroll, that Carroll pulled out his pistol and said that he wanted all of
his money, and that the next thing that Nelson knew, he heard a shot
and saw that he was bleeding.”

Carroll never testiﬁed. Because Prestley Dukes’ testimony was the
only  evidence  supporting  Carroll’s  argument  that  his  shooting  of

Nelson was an accident, we quote the relevant parts:

[Carroll’s  attorney]:   Tell  me  what  happened  [when  Carroll  entered

the nightclub]?

[Dukes]:  Well, when [Carroll] came in, he walked up and told [Nelson],
asked him to give him his money. He didn’t give it to him, so he hit
him.

* * *

[Carroll’s  attorney]:   Okay.  Now,  did  [Carroll]  have  the  gun  out  when

he came into the club?

[Dukes]:  Yes.
[Carroll’s attorney]:  Okay. And you say he hit him on the side of the

head?
[Dukes]:  Yeah.
[Carroll’s attorney]:  All right, and said, give me my money?
[Dukes]:  Yeah.
[Carroll’s attorney]:  All right. And what happened then?
[Dukes]:  Well. He didn’t respond to that.

* * *

[Carroll’s attorney]:  Okay. [Nelson] didn’t respond to it at all?
[Dukes]:  No. He said, ‘didn’t you hear[] me; give me my money.’
[Carroll’s attorney]:  Okay.
[Dukes]:   And  went  to  hit  him  again,  and  when  he  drawed  back,  the

gun went off.”

On cross-examination, Dukes further testiﬁed:

[Nelson’s  attorney]:   How  much  had  Mr.  Carroll  had  to  drink  that

evening?

[Dukes]:  He had a little.

[Nelson’s attorney]:  He was drunk at that time, wasn’t he?
[Dukes]:  He was a little tipsy.
[Nelson’s attorney]:  And he was angry, too, wasn’t he?
[Dukes]:  I imagine he was. He hit him aside the head with that gun.
[Nelson’s  attorney]:   All  right.  He  was  angry  from  the  time  he  saw

him, wasn’t he? Is that correct?

[Dukes]:  Yes.

Nelson  testiﬁed  to  undergoing  extensive  medical  treatment
resulting  from  his  gunshot  wound.  Immediately  after  being  shot,
Nelson lost consciousness as a result of blood loss and did not fully
regain consciousness for three or four months, until November 1992.
He continued to spend months in various hospitals and rehabilitation
facilities,  undergoing  multiple  operations.  He  testiﬁed  to  the  nearly
complete loss of his eyesight.

Nelson’s sole contention before this Court is that he was entitled
to  a  motion  for  judgment  on  the  issue  of  liability  for  battery.  He
contends  that  the  evidence  that  Carroll  committed  a  battery  is
uncontested.  Speciﬁcally,  Nelson  asserts  that  Carroll’s  primary
defense on the issue of liability — that the discharge of the handgun
was accidental — is unavailable under the circumstances of this case.
Preliminarily, it should be emphasized that the only defense raised
by Carroll as to liability was that the actual shooting of the handgun
was  accidental.  No  evidence  was  produced  to  contest  the  other
evidence  relating  to  the  course  of  events  leading  to  the  shooting.
Carroll  does  not  dispute  the  testimony  that  he  was  at  the  nightclub
the  night  Nelson  was  shot,  that  he  openly  carried  the  handgun  and
confronted Nelson about a debt owed him, and that, out of anger, he
struck Nelson with the handgun on the side of Nelson’s head at least
once.  Nor  did  Carroll  present  any  evidence  that  would  conflict  with
the  testimony  that  Carroll  was  responsible  for  ﬁring  the  shot  that
struck  Nelson.  The  only  point  made  in  Carroll’s  defense  (and  which
apparently  the  jury  believed)  was  that  the  actual  gunshot  occurred

accidentally.  Carroll’s  counsel  speciﬁcally  conceded  in  his  closing
argument  that  Carroll  “shouldn’t  have  gone  in  there  with  a  gun.  He
was wrong. But what he intended to do was to scare him.”

Since the only disputed fact relates to whether Carroll shot Nelson
accidentally as he was striking him, we need only address the narrow
question of whether, under the facts of this case, the defense that the
shot  was  ﬁred  accidentally  is  capable  of  exonerating  Carroll  of
liability.

Desire (or motive) to bring
about a result, or

Knowledge to a substantial
certainty that his actions
would bring about such a
result.

Principles
In torts, the word “intent” means
that the actor in question had
either the subjective

A  battery  occurs  when  one
intends  a  harmful  or  offensive
contact  with  another  without
that  person’s  consent.  See
Restatement (Second) of Torts
§13  &  cmt.  d  (1965).  “The  act
in  question  must  be  some
positive  or  afﬁrmative  action
on  the  part  of  the  defendant.”
Saba v. Darling, 575 A.2d 1240,
1242  (Md.  1990).  See  also
Prosser  &  Keeton,  The  Law  of
Torts  §9,  at  39  (5th  ed.  1984).
A battery may occur through a
defendant’s  direct  or  indirect  contact  with  the  plaintiff.  In  this  case,
Carroll  unquestionably  committed  a  battery  when  he  struck  Nelson
on  the  side  of  his  head  with  his  handgun.  Likewise,  an  indirect
contact, such as occurs when a bullet strikes a victim, may constitute
a  battery.  “It  is  enough  that  the  defendant  sets  a  force  in  motion
which ultimately produces the result. . . .” Prosser & Keeton, The Law
of Torts §9, at 40 (5th ed. 1984). Thus, if we assume the element of
intent  was  present,  Carroll  also  committed  a  battery  when  he
discharged his handgun, striking Nelson with a bullet.

Nelson’s action in the instant case focuses on the indirect contact
of  the  bullet  and  not  the  battery  that  occurred  when  Carroll  struck

him  on  the  head.  It  is  the  bullet  that  allegedly  caused  the  harm  for
which Nelson seeks damages. As the analysis that follows suggests,
however,  the  circumstances  surrounding  the  gunshot  are  relevant  in
determining whether a battery occurred.

Carroll’s  defense  that  he  accidentally  discharged  the  handgun
requires us to examine the “intent” requirement for the tort of battery.
It  is  universally  understood  that  some  form  of  intent  is  required  for
battery.  See  Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts  §13  (1965)  (“An  actor  is
subject  to  liability  to  another  for  battery  if  .  .  .  he  acts  intending  to
cause a harmful or offensive contact. . . .” (Emphasis added)); Prosser
& Keeton, The Law of Torts §9, at 39 (5th ed. 1984) (Battery requires
“an act intended to cause the plaintiff . . . to suffer such a contact. . . .”
(Emphasis added)); Harper, James & Gray, The Law of Torts §3.3, at
3:9  (3d  ed.  1996)  (“To  constitute  a  battery,  the  actor  must  have
intended  to  bring  about  a  harmful  or  offensive  contact  or  to  put  the
other  party  in  apprehension  thereof.”  (Emphasis  added)  (footnote
omitted)).  It  is  also  clear,  however,  that  the  intent  required  is  not  a
speciﬁc intent to cause the type of harm that occurred:

The defendant’s liability for the resulting harm extends, as in most other cases
of  intentional  torts,  to  consequences  which  the  defendant  did  not  intend,  and
could not reasonably have foreseen, upon the obvious basis that it is better for
unexpected  losses  to  fall  upon  the  intentional  wrongdoer  than  upon  the
innocent victim.

Prosser & Keeton, The Law of Torts §9, at 40 (5th ed. 1984).

On the other hand, a purely accidental touching, or one caused by
mere inadvertence, is not enough to establish the intent requirement
for  battery.  See, e.g.,  Steinman  v.  Laundry  Co.,  71  A.  517,  518  (Md.
1908)  (ﬁnding  a  lack  of  intent  for  battery  where  “there  [was]  no
pretense here that this contact of his knee with hers was wilful, angry
or insolent, and the only inference from her testimony is that it was
purely  accidental,  as  in  the  case  of  one  stumbling,  and,  in  his  fall
coming in contact with the person of another.” (Emphasis added).

The  intent  element  of  battery  requires  not  a  speciﬁc  desire  to
bring  about  a  certain  result,  but  rather  a  general  intent  to  unlawfully
invade  another’s  physical  well  being  through  a  harmful  or  offensive
contact or an apprehension of such a contact.

Thus,  innocent  conduct  that  accidentally  or  inadvertently  results
in  a  harmful  or  offensive  contact  with  another  will  not  give  rise  to
liability, but one will be liable for such contact if it comes about as a
result  of  the  actor’s  volitional  conduct  where  there  is  an  intent  to
invade the other person’s legally protected interests.

The  only  reasonable  inference  that  can  be  drawn  from  the
circumstances of this shooting, which in essence are uncontested, is
that Carroll’s actions evidenced an intent to commit a battery. Carroll
presented  no  evidence  disputing  the  fact  that  he  carried  a  loaded
handgun  and  that  he  struck  Nelson  on  the  head  with  the  gun.  The
merely speculative evidence upon which Carroll claims the shot was
an accident was Dukes’ testimony that when Carroll “went to hit him
again  .  .  .  the  gun  went  off.”  In  contrast,  the  evidence  is  undisputed
that  Carroll  possessed  a  handgun  which  he  openly  carried  into  the
nightclub,  that  Carroll  struck  Nelson  with  the  handgun,  and  that  the
handgun discharged simultaneously as Carroll went to strike Nelson
again.  Indeed,  taking  every  possible  inference  in  favor  of  Carroll,  the
gunshot  occurred  as  he  attempted  to  strike  Nelson  with  the  gun.
Under  such  circumstances,  no  reasonable  inference  can  be  drawn
that Carroll lacked the required intent to commit the battery.

The  law  imposes  upon  Carroll  the  responsibility  for  losses
associated  with  his  wrongful  actions.  It  is  of  no  import  that  he  may
not  have  intended  to  actually  shoot  Nelson  since  the  uncontested
facts  demonstrate  that  he  did  intend  to  invade  Nelson’s  legally
protected  interests  in  not  being  physically  harmed  or  assaulted.  He
violated  those  interests  by  committing  an  assault  and  battery  when
he  threatened  Nelson  with  the  handgun  and  struck  Nelson  on  the
head. Even assuming as we must that Carroll did not intend to inflict
the  particular  damages  arising  from  the  gunshot  wound,  it  is  more

appropriate that those losses fall to Carroll as the wrongdoer than to
Nelson as the innocent victim. Therefore, the motion for judgment as
to liability should have been granted, with the only question remaining
for  the  jury  being  the  damages  resulting  from  the  discharge  of  the
gun.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Intentional  Torts  and  Accidents.   The  court  believed  the
evidence  was  undisputed  that  the  defendant  intended  to  cause  a
harmful  contact  even  though  the  favorable  evidence  also  showed
that the defendant did not intend to shoot the plaintiff. How can these
observations be reconciled?

2. Liability for Unforeseen Results.  To a certain extent the holding
in  this  case  is  consistent  with  the  holding  in  the  Blackshear  case
involving  the  ﬁrecracker.  If  you  represented  the  plaintiff  in  this  case,
how  would  you  use  the  holding  from  Blackshear  to  argue  for  full
liability  here?  If  you  represented  the  defendant  in  the  Nelson  case,
how  would  you  try  to  distinguish  the  Blackshear  holding  from  this
one? Lawyers make a living making such arguments, and recognizing
when a new case presents an extension of prior law is a valuable skill
to possess.

3. Proximate Cause Not Applicable.  One of the traditional tests for
proximate cause is a test of foreseeability — that one is only liable for
harm that was reasonably foreseeable at the time of the defendant’s
misconduct. Chapter 5 will discuss this, and other, tests for proximate
or “legal” causation in detail. The defendant in Nelson  was,  in  effect,
arguing  for  application  of  these  proximate  cause  principles  to  the
battery claim. However, proximate cause is historically not applied to
intentional torts, at least not in the same manner as it is with claims
for  negligence.  The  court  appropriately  rejected  this  argument.  The
important  concept  is  to  remember  when  tort  doctrines  apply,  and

when  they  do  not  apply.  We  will  explore  proximate  cause  in  some
detail in the chapter on negligence. The Third Restatement reafﬁrms
liable  for  even
this  principle  of  holding
unanticipated  harms  caused  by  their  misconduct,  stating  that  “An
actor  who  intentionally  .  .  .  causes  harm  is  subject  to  liability  for  a
broader range of harms than the harms for which that actor would be
liable if only acting negligently.” Restatement (Third) of Torts §33(b).
Illustration 2 to §33(b) provides an example of such broad liability:

intentional  tortfeasors

Mike,  who  suffered  from  manic  depression,  was  injured  while
walking  through  a  high-school  parking  lot  by  a  bomb  that
exploded.  The  homemade  bomb  was  placed  there  by  Dick  and
Anna with the intent that it explode and harm those in the vicinity.
A year after he was injured by the bomb, Mike committed suicide.
Damages  for  Mike’s  death  may  be  found  by  the  factﬁnder  to  be
within  the  scope  of  Dick’s  and  Anna’s  liability  for  their  intentional
conduct.  However,  before  Dick  and  Anna  may  be  found  liable  for
Mike’s  death,  the  factﬁnder  must  determine  that  the  injury  from
the bomb was a factual cause of Mike’s suicide.

Restatement (Third) of Torts, §33, Ill. 2 (2011). Notwithstanding these
express rejections of such proximate cause limitations on liability for
intentional  torts,  one  can  ﬁnd  some  authorities  that  suggest  that  in
some  instances,  a  consequence  of  willful  misconduct  might  be  too
far removed to create liability for the intentional tortfeasor. See,  e.g.,
Thompson  v.  Hodges,  237  S.W.2d  757,  759  (Tex.  Civ.  App. — San
law  will  presume  that  a  person  willfully
Antonio,  1951)  (“The
assaulting  another  intends  the  direct  and  immediate  consequences
of  his  acts.”);  C.J.S.,  Damages  §25b  (“In  the  case  of  willful  torts  the
wrongdoer is responsible for the direct and immediate consequences
regardless of whether they might have been contemplated, foreseen,
or expected.”).

4. Problems.  Should the actors below be liable under a theory of

battery for the harms they caused?

A.  Alfonso,  a  renowned  chef,  bangs  some  pans  together  while
cooking in his commercial kitchen, spilling boiling hot water onto
another chef standing beside him.

B.  Meg,  while  driving  under  the  influence  of  alcohol  one  evening,
swerves  too  sharply  around  a  corner  and  loses  control  of  her
car,  causing  it  to  crash  into  a  small  child  running  a  lemonade
stand by the sidewalk.

C.  Richard  is  upset  with  his  brother-in-law,  and  in  the  heat  of  an
argument,  slaps  him  across  the  face.  The  brother-in-law  is  so
upset by this that he immediately suffers a fatal heart attack.

E. The Single vs. Dual Intent Debate

As stated multiple times in the cases above, battery requires intent by
the  defendant  to  cause  a  harmful  or  offensive  contact.  But  is  it
sufﬁcient  if  the  defendant  intended  to  cause  a  non-harmful  contact
that  turns  out  to  be  harmful?  There  is  a  whole  category  of  cases
involving benign hugs or other contacts where the defendant intends
something like a harmless pat on the back of the plaintiff. But so long
as the pat on the back is not consented to by the plaintiff, should the
defendant be liable for any unforeseen ill effects of the touching? The
following  case  highlights  and  discusses  what  is  referred  to  as  the
debate between single intent and dual intent battery.

WHITE v. MUNIZ
999 P.2d 814 (Colo. 2000)

       , J.

Petitioner, Barbara White, as personal representative of the estate
of  Helen  Everly  [who  died  after  the  events  in  this  case],  appeals  the
decision of the court of appeals . . . which determined that a mentally
incapacitated adult should be held liable for her intentional tort even if
she  was  unable  to  appreciate  the  wrongfulness  of  her  actions.  We
disagree  with  the  court  of  appeals.  Rather,  we  conclude  that  under
the  facts  present  in  this  case,  in  order  to  recover  on  a  theory  of
intentional tort, the plaintiff, Sherry Lynn Muniz, was required to prove
that Everly intended to commit an act and that Everly intended the act
to result in a harmful or offensive contact.

In October of 1993, Barbara White placed her eighty-three-year-old
grandmother,  Helen  Everly,  in  an  assisted  living  facility,  the  Beatrice
Hover  Personal  Care  Center.  Within  a  few  days  of  admission,  Everly
started  exhibiting  erratic  behavior.  She  became  agitated  easily,  and
occasionally acted aggressively toward others.

On  November  21,  1993,  the  caregiver  in  charge  of  Everly’s  wing
asked  [plaintiff]  Sherry  Lynn  Muniz,  a  shift  supervisor  at  Hover,  to
change  Everly’s  adult  diaper.  The  caregiver  informed  Muniz  that
Everly was not cooperating in that effort. This did not surprise Muniz
because  she  knew  that  Everly  sometimes  acted  obstinately.  Indeed,
initially  Everly  refused  to  allow  Muniz  to  change  her  diaper,  but
eventually  Muniz  thought  that  Everly  relented.  However,  as  Muniz
reached  toward  the  diaper,  Everly  struck  Muniz  on  the  jaw  and
ordered her out of the room.

The  next  day,  Dr.  Haven  Howell,  M.D.  examined  Everly  at
Longmont  United  Hospital.  Dr.  Howell  deduced  that  “she  [had]  a
progressive  dementia  with  characteristic  gradual  loss  of  function,
loss  of  higher  cortical  function  including  immediate  and  short  term
memory, impulse control and judgement.” She diagnosed Everly with
“primary  degenerative  dementia  of  the  Alzheimer  type,  senile  onset,
with depression.”

In November of 1994, Muniz ﬁled suit alleging . . . battery against
Everly, and negligence against Barbara and Timothy White. [The trial
court  dismissed  the  negligence  claims  before  trial.]  The  case
proceeded to a jury trial on March 17, 1997. While arguing outside the
presence  of  the  jury  for  speciﬁc  jury  instructions,  the  parties  took
differing positions on the mental state required to commit the alleged
intentional torts. Muniz requested the following instruction: “A person
who has been found incompetent may intend to do an act even if he
or  she  lacked  control  of  reason  and  acted  unreasonably.”  White
tendered a different instruction:

A  person  intends  to  make  a  contact  with  another  person  if  he  or  she  does  an
act for the purpose of bringing about such a contact, whether or not he or she
also intends that the contact be harmful or offensive. The intent must include
some  awareness  of  the  natural  consequences  of  intentional  acts,  and  the
person  must  appreciate  the  consequences  of  intentional  acts,  and  the  person
must appreciate the offensiveness or wrongfulness of her acts.

The  trial  court  settled  on  a  slightly  modiﬁed  version  of  White’s
instruction.
It read:

A person intends to make a contact with another person if she does an act for
the purpose of bringing about such a contact, whether or not she also intends
that the contact be harmful or offensive.

The fact that a person may suffer from Dementia, Alzheimer type, does not
prevent  a  ﬁnding  that  she  acted  intentionally.  You  may  ﬁnd  that  she  acted
intentionally  if  she  intended  to  do  what  she  did,  even  though  her  reasons  and
motives  were  entirely  irrational.  However,  she  must  have  appreciated  the
offensiveness of [the contact].

(Emphasis added.) In selecting the instruction on intent, the trial court
determined  that  Everly’s  condition  rendered  her  mental  state
comparable to that of a child.

The

court  of  appeals
reversed the decision of the trial court and remanded the case for a
new trial. The court of appeals reasoned that most states continue to
hold  mentally  deﬁcient  plaintiffs  liable  for  their  intentional  acts
regardless  of  their  ability  to  understand  the  offensiveness  of  their
actions.  The  court  of  appeals  reasoned  that  insanity  may  not  be
asserted as a defense to an intentional tort, and thus, concluded that
the  trial  court  erred  in  “instructing  the  jury  that  Everly  must  have
appreciated the offensiveness of her conduct.” Id. at 26.

The  question  we  here  address  is  whether  an  intentional  tort
requires some proof that the tortfeasor not only intended to contact
another  person,  but  also  intended  that  the  contact  be  harmful  or
offensive to the other person.

Historically,  the  intentional  tort  of  battery  required  a  subjective
desire  on  the  part  of  the  tortfeasor  to  inflict  a  harmful  or  offensive
it  was  not  enough  that  a  person
contact  on  another.  Thus,
intentionally  contacted  another  resulting  in  a  harmful  or  offensive
contact. Instead, the actor had to understand that his contact would
be  harmful  or  offensive.  See  Keeton,  supra,  §8;  Dobbs,  supra,  §29.
The  actor  need  not  have  intended,  however,  the  harm  that  actually

resulted from his action. Thus, if a slight punch to the victim resulted
in  traumatic  injuries,  the  actor  would  be  liable  for  all  the  damages
resulting from the battery even if he only intended to knock the wind
out of the victim.

Juries  may  ﬁnd  it  difﬁcult  to  determine  the  mental  state  of  an
actor,  but  they  may  rely  on  circumstantial  evidence  in  reaching  their
conclusion.  No  person  can  pinpoint  the  thoughts  in  the  mind  of
another,  but  a  jury  can  examine  the  facts  to  conclude  what  another
must  have  been  thinking.  For  example,  a  person  of  reasonable
intelligence knows with substantial certainty that a stone thrown into
a  crowd  will  strike  someone  and  result  in  an  offensive  or  harmful
contact  to  that  person.  Hence,  if  an  actor  of  average  intelligence
performs such an act, the jury can determine that the actor had the
requisite intent to cause a harmful or offensive contact, even though
the actor denies having such thoughts.

More  recently,  some  courts  around  the  nation  have  abandoned
this  dual  intent  requirement  in  an  intentional  tort  setting,  that  being
an  intent  to  contact  and  an  intent  that  the  contact  be  harmful  or
offensive, and have required only that the tortfeasor intend a contact
with  another  that  results  in  a  harmful  or  offensive  touching.  See
Brzoska  v.  Olson,  668  A.2d  1355,  1360  (Del.  1995)  (stating  that
battery  is  an  intentional,  unpermitted  contact  on  another  which  is
harmful or offensive; and that the intent necessary for battery is the
intent  to  contact  the  person);  White  v.  University  of  Idaho,  797  P.2d
108, 111 (Idaho 1990) (determining that battery requires an intent to
cause  an  unpermitted  contact,  not  an  intent  to  make  a  harmful  or
offensive  contact).  Under  this  view,  a  victim  need  only  prove  that  a
voluntary  movement  by  the  tortfeasor  resulted  in  a  contact  which  a
reasonable person would ﬁnd offensive [and] to which the victim did
not  consent.  See University of  Idaho,  797  P.2d  at  111.  These  courts
would  ﬁnd  intent  in  contact  to  the  back  of  a  friend  that  results  in  a
severe,  unexpected  injury  even  though  the  actor  did  not  intend  the
contact to be harmful or offensive. The actor thus could be held liable

for  battery  because  a  reasonable  person  would  ﬁnd  an  injury
offensive or harmful, irrespective of the intent of the actor to harm or
offend.

these

intertwined

Courts  occasionally  have

two  distinct
understandings of the requisite intent. See Brzoska, 668 A.2d at 1360
(approving  the  Restatement  view  of  the  intent  element  of  a  battery,
but  summarizing  the  rule  as  “the  intentional,  unpermitted  contact
upon the person of another which is harmful or offensive”) (emphasis
added).  In  most  instances  when  the  defendant  is  a  mentally  alert
adult,  this  commingling  of  deﬁnitions  prejudices  neither  the  plaintiff
nor  the  defendant.  However,  when  evaluating  the  culpability  of
particular  classes  of  defendants,  such  as  the  very  young  and  the
mentally  disabled,  the  intent  required  by  a  jurisdiction  becomes
critical.

In Practice
Sometimes where an intentional
theory is unavailing, a plaintiff
might be able to craft a
negligence cause of action —
alleging that the defendant
acted carelessly in causing the
plaintiff’s harm. The Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure
expressly permit pleading
multiple claims as well as
pleading claims in the
alternative.

In  Horton  v.  Reaves,  526
(Colo.  1974),  we
P.2d  304
examined  the  jury  instructions
used  to  determine  if  a  four-
year-old  boy  and  a  three-year-
old  boy  intentionally  battered
an infant when they dropped a
baby  who

injuries  as  a  result.  We  held
that  although  a  child  need  not
intend  the  resulting  harm,  the
child must understand that the
contact  may  be  harmful
in
order  to  be  held  liable.  Our
conclusion comported with the
Restatement’s  deﬁnition  of
intent;  it  did  not  state  a  new
special  rule  for  children,  but
applied the general rule to the context of an intentional tort of battery

Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(d)(3).

suffered

committed by a child. Because a child made the contact, the jury had
to  examine  the  objective  evidence  to  determine  if  the  child  actors
intended their actions to be offensive or harmful. This result complied
with both the Colorado jury instruction at the time, and the deﬁnition
of battery in the Restatement.

In  this  case,  we  have  the  opportunity  to  examine  intent  in  the
context  of  an  injury  inflicted  by  a  mentally  deﬁcient,  Alzheimer’s
patient.  White  seeks  an  extension  of  Horton  to  the  mentally  ill,  and
Muniz  argues  that  a  mere  voluntary  movement  by  Everly  can
constitute  the  requisite  intent.  We  ﬁnd  that  the  law  of  Colorado
requires  the  jury  to  conclude  that  the  defendant  both  intended  the
contact and intended it to be harmful or offensive.

Because  Colorado  law  requires  a  dual  intent,  we  apply  here  the
Restatement’s  deﬁnition  of  the  term.  As  a  result,  we  reject  the
arguments  of  Muniz  and  ﬁnd  that  the  trial  court  delivered  an
adequate instruction to the jury.

Operating in accordance with this instruction, the jury had to ﬁnd
that  Everly  appreciated  the  offensiveness  of  her  conduct  in  order  to
be  liable  for  the  intentional  tort  of  battery.  It  necessarily  had  to
consider  her  mental  capabilities  in  making  such  a  ﬁnding,  including
her  age,  inﬁrmity,  education,  skill,  or  any  other  characteristic  as  to
which  the  jury  had  evidence.  We  presume  that  the  jury  “looked  into
the  mind  of  Everly,”  and  reasoned  that  Everly  did  not  possess  the
necessary intent to commit an assault or a battery. See Hall v. Walter,
969  P.2d  224,  238  (Colo.  1998)  (stating  that  the  court  presumes  the
jury followed instructions in reaching its verdict).

A jury can, of course, ﬁnd a mentally deﬁcient person liable for an
intentional tort, but in order to do so, the jury must ﬁnd that the actor
intended  offensive  or  harmful  consequences.  As  a  result,  insanity  is
not  a  defense  to  an  intentional  tort  according  to  the  ordinary  use  of
that term, but is a characteristic, like infancy, that may make it more
difﬁcult  to  prove  the  intent  element  of  battery.  Our  decision  today

does  not  create  a  special  rule  for  the  elderly,  but  applies  Colorado’s
intent requirement in the context of a woman suffering the effects of
Alzheimer’s.

Contrary  to  Muniz’s  arguments,  policy  reasons  do  not  compel  a
different  result.  Injured  parties  consistently  have  argued  that  even  if
the  tortfeasor  intended  no  harm  or  offense,  “where  one  of  two
innocent  persons  must  suffer  a  loss,  it  should  be  borne  by  the  one
who occasioned it.” Keeton, supra, §135. Our decision may appear to
erode  that  principle.  Yet,  our  decision  does  not  bar  future  injured
persons  from  seeking  compensation.  Victims  may  still  bring
intentional  tort  actions  against  mentally  disabled  adults,  but  to
prevail,  they  must  prove  all  the  elements  of  the  alleged  tort.
Furthermore,  because  the  mentally  disabled  are  held  to  the
reasonable  person  standard  in  negligence  actions,  victims  may  ﬁnd
relief more easily under a negligence cause of action. See Johnson v.
Lambotte, 363 P.2d 165, 166 (1961).

With regard to the intent element of the intentional torts of assault
and  battery,  we  hold  that  regardless  of  the  characteristics  of  the
alleged  tortfeasor,  a  plaintiff  must  prove  that  the  actor  desired  to
cause  offensive  or  harmful  consequences  by  his  act.  The  plaintiff
need  not  prove,  however,  that  the  actor  intended  the  harm  that
actually  results.  Accordingly,  we  reverse  the  decision  of  the  court  of
appeals  and  remand  the  case  to  that  court  for  reinstatement  of  the
jury  verdict  in  favor  of  White  and  consideration  of  any  remaining
issues.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. The Implications for the Debate.  The court in White states that
“in most instances when the defendant is a mentally alert adult,” the
choice between single and dual intent “prejudices neither the plaintiff
nor the defendant.” Is this statement more likely to be accurate when

one  is  analyzing  a  claim  involving  a  harmful  contact  or  an  offensive
contact?

2. Friendly  Unsolicited  Hug  Cases.   If  a  piano  professor  walks  up
behind a student of his playing a piano at a social event and begins to
tap  on  her  shoulders,  as  if  to  demonstrate  the  proper  technique  to
use  in  playing  the  instrument,  and  inadvertently  hurts  the  student’s
back, will the professor be liable for battery? See White v. University of
Idaho, 768 P.2d 827 (Idaho Ct. App. 1989), aff’d, 797 P.2d 108 (Idaho
1990). This case is analogous to the so-called friendly unsolicited hug
cases, where one intends a benign, though unconsented, contact with
another  and  causes  harm.  Do  policy  reasons  support  applying  an
intentional tort theory to such cases or would it make more sense to
apply negligence law instead?

3. Irrational  Intent.   Another  aspect  of  the  trial  court’s  instruction
that was not challenged in White was the explanation that one could
intend a result even if her motives were irrational. This is consistent
with  case  law  holding  insane  people  liable  for  battery  where  they
clearly intended to cause a harmful contact based upon the delusion
that  the  victim  was  someone  else.  Polmatier  v.  Russ,  537  A.2d  468
(Conn.  1988)  (holding  defendant  liable  for  battery  where  he  shot  his
father-in-law  multiple  times  based  upon  the  delusion  that  the  victim
was a “spy for the red Chinese” sent to assassinate the defendant).

4.  Problem:  Interpreting  a  Jury  Charge.   Consider  whether  the
following pattern of jury instruction seems to be describing a dual or
single intent standard for battery liability: “A person commits a battery
if  he  intentionally  causes  bodily  injury  to  another.”  It’s  not  always
entirely clear, but the above charge infers that what must be intended
is  not  just  contact  but  bodily  injury — dual  intent.  If  a  charge  leaves
the  issue  open  it  invites  counsel  for  the  parties  to  argue  the  case
according  to  their  own  interpretation.  Part  of  the  job  of  judges  in
approving  and  submitting  the  charge  to  the  jury  is  to  avoid  such
debates  from  playing  out  during  closing  arguments  by  drafting
instructions that clarify what the jury must ﬁnd to impose liability.

5. Criminal  Law  vs.  Civil  Law  Regarding  Insanity.   The  law  is  fairly
settled that in a civil tort suit, the defendant’s status as insane is not a
per  se  defense  to  a  tort  claim.  So  long  as  the  defendant’s  mental
status makes it possible for the elements of the cause of action to be
satisﬁed, the defendant can remain fully liable for damages in tort. In
criminal law, the opposite is often the case with legal insanity being a
defense to many crimes.

Upon Further Review

Battery is designed to protect one’s bodily integrity. Speciﬁcally, it
provides redress for intentional invasions of one’s bodily integrity
that take the form of harmful or offensive contacts. Whether the
contact  is  harmful  or  offensive  is  judged  according  to  objective
standards.  Instances  of  harmful  contact  are  usually  obvious —
cuts, bruises, broken bones, painful touching, or worse. Offensive
contact requires not only that the plaintiff consider the touching
distasteful,  but  also  that  a  reasonable  person  under  the
circumstances would similarly ﬁnd the contact distasteful. Every
state requires that the defendant at least intended to bring about
the  physical  contact.  Accidental  bumping,  no  matter  how
disastrous  the  consequences,  is  not  a  battery.  Some  states
require  also  that  the  defendant  must  have  intended  for  the
contact to be harmful or appreciate that it would be considered
offensive — the  dual  intent  jurisdictions.  But  no  jurisdiction
requires that the defendant must have intended (or foreseen) all
of  the  resulting  harm  that  actually  occurs.  So  long  as  the
defendant  intended  any  harm  she  is  liable  for  all  the  harm  that
results.

III  ASSAULT

A. Introduction

The  torts  of  assault  and  battery  go  together  like  peas  and  carrots,
being related but not identical. An assault can occur without a battery
and vice versa. But often a tortfeasor’s conduct will be actionable as
both  an  assault  and  a  battery.  Unlike  the  interest  in  bodily  integrity
that  is  protected  by  a  battery  cause  of  action,  the  tort  of  assault  is
designed  to  protect  the  plaintiff’s  mind — speciﬁcally  to  provide
redress  for  the  defendant  having  created  in  the  mind  of  the  plaintiff
an  apprehension  of  an  impending  battery.  Whether  or  not  a  battery
occurs  is  of  no  consequence.  If  the  apprehension  occurs  the
defendant may be liable for assault in addition or in lieu of a battery
cause of action.

B. The Elements

1. Intent

CULLISON v. MEDLEY
570 N.E.2d 27 (Ind. 1991)

        , J.

[Plaintiff] Dan R. Cullison petitions this Court to . . . reverse the trial
court’s  entry  of  summary  judgment  against  him  and  in  favor  of  the
[defendants]  (collectively  “the  Medleys”).  The  Court  of  Appeals
afﬁrmed  the  entry  of  summary  judgment.  For  the  reasons  set  forth

below, we . . . reverse the entry of summary judgment and remand to
the trial court.

According to Cullison’s deposition testimony, on February 2, 1986,
he encountered Sandy, the 16-year-old daughter of Ernest, in a Linton,
Indiana,  grocery  store  parking  lot.  They  exchanged  pleasantries  and
Cullison invited her to have a Coke with him and to come to his home
to talk further. A few hours later, someone knocked on the door of his
mobile  home.  Cullison  got  out  of  bed  and  answered  the  door.  He
testiﬁed that he saw a person standing in the darkness who said that
she  wanted  to  talk  to  him.  Cullison  answered  that  he  would  have  to
get  dressed  because  he  had  been  in  bed.  Cullison  went  back  to  his
bedroom,  dressed,  and  returned  to  the  darkened  living  room  of  his
trailer.  When  he  entered  the  living  room  and  turned  the  lights  on,  he
was confronted by Sandy Medley, as well as by father Ernest, brother
Ron, mother Doris, and brother-in-law Terry Simmons. Ernest was on
crutches due to knee surgery and had a revolver in a holster strapped
to  his  thigh.  Cullison  testiﬁed  that  Sandy  called  him  a  “pervert”  and
told  him  he  was  “sick,”  mother  Doris  berated  him  while  keeping  her
hand in her pocket, convincing Cullison that she also was carrying a
pistol. Ron and Terry said nothing to Cullison, but their presence in his
trailer  home  further  intimidated  him.  Primarily,  however,  Cullison’s
attention  was  riveted  to  the  gun  carried  by  Ernest.  Cullison  testiﬁed
that,  while  Ernest  never  withdrew  the  gun  from  his  holster,  he
“grabbed for the gun a few times and shook the gun” at plaintiff while
threatening  to  “jump  astraddle”  of  Cullison  if  he  did  not  leave  Sandy
alone. Cullison testiﬁed that Ernest “kept grabbing at it with his hand,
like he was going to take it out,” and “took it to mean he was going to
shoot  me”  when  Ernest  threatened  to  “jump  astraddle”  of  Cullison.
Although no one actually touched Cullison, his testimony was that he
feared  he  was  about  to  be  shot  throughout  the  episode  because
Ernest kept moving his hand toward the gun as if to draw the revolver
from the holster while threatening Cullison to leave Sandy alone.

As  the  Medleys  were  leaving,  Cullison  suffered  chest  pains  and
feared that he was having a heart attack. Approximately two months
later,  Cullison  testiﬁed  that  Ernest  glared  at  him  in  a  menacing
manner while again armed with a handgun at a restaurant in Linton.
On  one  of  these  occasions,  Ernest  stood  next  to  the  booth  where
Cullison  was  seated  while  wearing  a  pistol  and  a  holster
approximately one foot from Cullison’s face. Shortly after the incident
at his home, Cullison learned that Ernest had previously shot a man.
This added greatly to his fear and apprehension of Ernest on the later
occasions when Ernest glared at him and stood next to the booth at
which he was seated while armed with a handgun in a holster.

Cullison  testiﬁed  that  as  a  result  of  the  incident,  he  sought
psychological  counseling  and  therapy  and  continued  to  see  a
therapist  for  approximately  18  months.  Additionally,  Cullison  sought
psychiatric  help  and
received  prescription  medication  which
prevented  him  from  operating  power  tools  or  driving  an  automobile,
thus injuring Cullison in his sole proprietorship construction business.
Additionally,  Cullison  testiﬁed  that  he  suffered  from  nervousness,
depression,  sleeplessness,  inability  to  concentrate  and  impotency
following his run-in with the Medleys.

In  count  two  of  his  complaint,  Cullison  alleged  an  assault.  The
Court of Appeals decided that, because Ernest never removed his gun
from  the  holster,  his  threat  that  he  was  going  to  “jump  astraddle”  of
Cullison constituted conditional language which did not express any
present  intent  to  harm  Cullison  and,  therefore,  was  not  an  assault.
Further,  the  Court  of  Appeals  decided  that  even  if  it  were  to  ﬁnd  an
assault,  summary  judgment  was  still  appropriate  because  Cullison
alleged  only  emotional  distress  and  made  no  showing  that  the
Medleys’ actions were malicious, callous, or willful or that the alleged
injuries he suffered were a foreseeable result of the Medleys’ conduct.
We disagree.

It is axiomatic that assault, unlike battery, is effectuated when one
acts  intending  to  cause  a  harmful  or  offensive  contact  with  the

person  of  the  other  or  an  imminent  apprehension  of  such  contact.
Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts  §21  (1965).  It  is  the  right  to  be  free
from  the  apprehension  of  a  battery  which  is  protected  by  the  tort
action which we call an assault. As this Court held approximately 90
years  ago  in  Kline  v.  Kline,  64  N.E.  9  (Ind.  1901),  an  assault
constitutes “a touching of the mind, if not of the body.” Because it is a
touching of the mind, as opposed to the body, the damages which are
recoverable  for  an  assault  are  damages  for  mental  trauma  and
distress. “Any act of such a nature as to excite an apprehension of a
battery  may  constitute  an  assault.  It  is  an  assault  to  shake  a  ﬁst
under another’s nose, to aim or strike at him with a weapon, or to hold
it  in  a  threatening  position,  to  rise  or  advance  to  strike  another,  to
surround  him  with  a  display  of  force.  .  .  .”  W.  Prosser  &  J.  Keaton,
Prosser  and  Keaton  on  Torts  §10  (5th  ed.  1984).  Additionally,  the
apprehension  must  be  one  which  would  normally  be  aroused  in  the
mind of a reasonable person. Id. Finally, the tort is complete with the
invasion of the plaintiff’s mental peace.

The  facts  alleged  and  testiﬁed  to  by  Cullison  could,  if  believed,
entitle him to recover for an assault against the Medleys. A jury could
reasonably conclude that the Medleys intended to frighten Cullison by
surrounding  him  in  his  trailer  and  threatening  him  with  bodily  harm
while one of them was armed with a revolver, even if that revolver was
not  removed  from  the  its  holster.  Cullison  testiﬁed  that  Ernest  kept
grabbing  at  the  pistol  as  if  he  were  going  to  take  it  out,  and  that
Cullison  thought  Ernest  was  going  to  shoot  him.  It  is  for  the  jury  to
determine  whether  Cullison’s  apprehension  of  being  shot  or
otherwise  injured  was  one  which  would  normally  be  aroused  in  the
mind  of  a  reasonable  person.  It  was  error  for  the  trial  court  to  enter
summary judgment on the count two allegation of assault.

For  all  of  the  reasons  stated  above,  we  hereby  .  .  .  reverse  the
entry  of  summary  judgment  .  .  .  and  remand  this  cause  to  the  trial
court.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Elements.  Assault requires the defendant’s voluntary action, an
intent  to  cause  the  victim  to  suffer  apprehension  of  an  imminent
harmful  or  offensive  contact,  and  the  victim  must  experience  the
reasonable  and  imminent  apprehension  of  such  a  contact.  As  some
courts  have  stated  it  less  formally,  an  assault  occurs  when  the
defendant  intends  to  cause  the  plaintiff  to  believe  he  is  about  to  be
battered.

2. Interest Protected.  The interest protected by an assault claim is
the  victim’s  peace  of  mind.  The  tort  provides  a  remedy  for  the
intentional  invasion  of  the  victim’s  mind,  which  occurs  when  the
defendant  intentionally  causes  apprehension  of  an  invasion  of  the
plaintiff’s  bodily  integrity.  It  is  the  touching  of  the  mind,  rather  than
the body, that distinguishes this tort from the related tort of battery.
Given  this  interest,  why  was  the  intermediate  court  of  appeals’
reservation regarding the primary harm of the plaintiff misplaced? In
terms of a recovery of actual damages, courts recognize the right of
the assault victim to recover for the emotional harms caused by the
assault,  as  well  as  any  physical  consequences  of  that  emotional
disturbance. For example, a plaintiff assaulted by a defendant might
incur psychiatric expenses, expenses for purchasing pharmaceutical
products  to  contend  with  the  emotional  harm,  and  other  medical
expenses incurred due to physical ailments brought on by the fright.

3. Conditional Language.  The court of appeals had ruled that the
mere verbal threat to “jump astraddle” the plaintiff “if he did not leave
Sandy alone” could not constitute an assault. There are many assault
cases where courts have stated as black letter law that “words alone
cannot constitute an assault.” This is misleading because if there are
sufﬁcient  surrounding  circumstances,  the  defendant’s  utterance  of
certain words might actually meet the elements of assault. Suppose
the  defendant  is  holding  a  gun  toward  the  plaintiff  and  then  says
“prepare  to  die!”  Do  you  see  how  invoking  the  mantra  “words  alone

cannot  constitute  an  assault”  would  not  satisfactorily  lead  to  a
defense  for  the  defendant  in  that  scenario?  Words  are  always
accompanied by some circumstances. The real test is whether, given
the totality of the circumstances, including any words spoken by the
defendant,  the  elements  of  the  tort  might  be  satisﬁed.  The  answer
necessarily  varies  by  the  circumstances.  Why  did  the  Indiana
Supreme  Court  ﬁnd  that  the  defendants’  conduct,  including  the
conditional threat, might satisfy the elements of the common law tort
of assault? Was it a mere “future threat”?

4. Problem.   Despising  the  plaintiff,  and  wanting  to  frighten  him,
the  defendant  stands  behind  the  plaintiff  and  ﬁres  a  weapon  at  his
head but misses. The plaintiff is deaf and does not ﬁnd out about the
incident  until  another  observer  informs  him  of  it.  Upon  confronting
the defendant about the prior incident, the defendant states her plan
to shoot the plaintiff the next time she sees him alone. Has an assault
occurred?

An  assault  is  an  attempt  or  offer  to  touch  or  strike

the person of another with unlawful force or violence.

Delaware Pattern Civil Jury Instructions

13.1 Assault

If  you  ﬁnd  that  [defendant]  intentionally,  and  without
[plaintiff’s]  consent,  caused  [plaintiff]  to  be  in  fear  of  an
immediate harmful or offensive contact, then [defendant]
is  liable  for  assault.  It  is  not  necessary  for  any  actual
contact to have been made between the parties.

2. Reasonable Apprehension

it

For  most  courts,
is  not  enough  that  the  plaintiff  actually
experiences  apprehension  of  a  battery.  They  also  require  that  the
plaintiff’s  apprehension  be  reasonable — that  a  reasonable  person
under  their  circumstances  would  likewise  have  experienced  such
apprehension.  Thus,  both  a  subjective  (the  plaintiff’s  actual  state  of
mind)  and  an  objective  (the  hypothetical  reasonable  person’s
supposed state of mind) apprehension must be found before liability
for  an  assault  will  attach.  As  you  read  the  following  spooky  case,
consider why courts would impose this additional qualiﬁcation.

BOUTON v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.
491 So. 2d 56 (La. Ct. App. 1986)

        , J.

This suit arose from the unfortunate events of Halloween night in
1981. Jeffrey Scott Trammel, aged 15, Robert Martin Landry, Jr., aged
13,  and  Daniel  Breaux,  aged  13,  went  trick-or-treating  that  evening.
About 6:30 p.m., Trammel and Breaux rang Robert Bouton’s (plaintiff)
front  door  bell  while  Landry  waited  at  the  sidewalk.  Plaintiff  opened
the door and saw Breaux standing before him. Breaux was dressed in
military  fatigues  and  was  holding  a  plastic  model  submachine  gun.
Plaintiff shut the door immediately and locked it, then armed himself
with  a  .357  magnum  pistol.  He  returned  to  the  door,  opened  it,  and
saw  a  flash  of  light,  caused,  he  alleges,  by  Trammel’s  triggering  a
photographic  flash.  Plaintiff’s  pistol  then  discharged,  the  bullet
striking and killing Breaux.

Plaintiff  brought  this  suit  against  Allstate  Insurance  Company
(Allstate),  insurer  of  Landry  and  Breaux,  and  Independent  Fire
Insurance  Company  (Independent),  insurer  of  Trammel.  He  alleged
that  the  three  boys’  actions  were  tortious  and  caused  him  to  be
indicted  and  tried  for  second-degree  murder,
incur  substantial
attorney  fees,  lose  his  job,  and  suffer  unfavorable  publicity.  [Plaintiff
was  ultimately  acquitted
in  the  criminal  case.  After  ﬁling  his
complaint in this civil case, defendants moved for summary judgment
arguing  that  Plaintiff  had  no  cause  of  action  for  assault.  The  trial
court  granted  their  motion.]  From  that  action  plaintiff  brings  this
appeal.

In Practice
In the context of any tort claim,
whenever you see the word
“reasonable” used, it alludes to
an objective determination
based upon the factﬁnder’s
speculation about how a
hypothetical, reasonable person
would react to something. This
reasonable person is discussed
at length in Chapter 4 under the
topic of Negligence. Even
though the reasonable person is
primarily a creation of
negligence law, it is borrowed in
multiple places even for
intentional torts.

defendants  which  would  have

in  reasonable
apprehension  of  receiving  a
battery.  See  Castiglione  v.
Galpin,  325  So.  2d  725  (La.
App.  4th  Cir.  1976);  F.  Stone,
Tort  Doctrine,  §§159  and  160
in  12  Louisiana  Civil  Law
Treatise  206-207  (1977).  We
ﬁnd  that  the  pleadings  and
evidence  fail  to  establish  any
right  to  relief  because,  under
the  facts  as  set  out  by  the
plaintiff, he could not have had
a reasonable apprehension of an impending battery or physical harm.

Although it is possible for one who opens his door to trick-or-treaters
on  Halloween  to  become  so  frightened  that  he  believes  a  battery  is
imminent, under the circumstances here, such an apprehension is not
reasonable. Any reasonable person expects to see an endless array of
ghouls, beasts, and characters on this evening, especially when he is,
as was plaintiff, passing out candy at his doorstep.

Plaintiff contends that “the sole determining issue in this case” is
whether  we  judge  the  boys’  actions  from  their  point  of  view  or  from
his. We do neither. Instead, “we place the average reasonable [man] in
the  very  situation  which  confronted  the  plaintiff  and  ask  of  him
oracularly”  if  an  apprehension  of  a  battery  could  be  reasonably
expected to follow from such a situation. Stone, at 209, §165. We do
not  believe  that  a  reasonable  person  acting  reasonably  would  have
been  apprehensive  of  a  battery  when  confronted  with  this  situation
on Halloween. Therefore, we hold that plaintiff was not the victim of
an assault.

[The  court  ruled  that  it  need  not  address  the  issue  of  the  boys’
intent because the element of reasonable apprehension was lacking.]
For  the  foregoing  reasons,  the  judgment  of  the  trial  court  is

afﬁrmed at plaintiff’s cost.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Reasonable Apprehension.  This element of the assault cause of
action  actually  contains  two  components — the  actual  (subjective)
apprehension  of  the  impending  battery  by  the  victim,  and  the
conclusion  that  this  apprehension  was  reasonable  (objective) — that
an ordinary person would have likewise experienced such a reaction.
Which  of  the  two  was  lacking  according  to  the  court  in  the  Bouton
case?

2. Fear vs. Apprehension.  While many judicial opinions loosely use
the  words  “fear”  and  “apprehension”  as  synonyms,  technically  an

assault only requires the latter and not the former. This might seem
to  be  mere  semantics,  but  it  is  conceivable  for  an  assault  victim  to
have  some  apprehension,  or  appreciation  of  an  impending  battery,
without  actually  being  frightened  by  it.  Perhaps  the  victim  does  not
believe the battery will inflict signiﬁcant harm. Or perhaps the victim
feels conﬁdent in their ability to defend themselves. Perhaps they are
like  Jack  Bauer  from  the  television  show  “24”  and  possess  great
courage and are afraid of no amount of physical pain. Nevertheless,
Professor  Prosser’s  view  has  been  that  an  assault  might  still  occur
without  fear:  “Apprehension  is  not  the  same  thing  as  fear,  and  the
plaintiff  is  not  deprived  of  his  action  merely  because  he  is  too
courageous  to  be  frightened  or  intimidated.”  Prosser,  The  Law  of
Torts  §10  (5th  ed.  1984).  By  the  same  token,  an  assault  victim  who
admits  to  having  no  fear  of  the  impending  battery  will  not  likely  be
awarded signiﬁcant actual damages. While they may possess a claim
based upon a technical violation of their rights and have a legal injury,
their  lack  of  actual  harm  will  impact  the  amount  of  the  award  the
defendant  will  have  to  pay.  Indeed,  their  claim  might  be  for  nominal
damages only — a token amount that signiﬁes a wrongful violation of
the plaintiff’s right.

3.  Problems.   Consider  whether  the  following  situations  would

likely involve an assault:

A. Two high school students are attending the prom together. It is
their ﬁrst date. During one slow dance, the girl leans forward to
kiss the boy unasked. He is repulsed and runs away.

B. Lucia is hiking in Rocky Mountain National Park when she sees
a  burly,  bearded  man  named  Jacques  standing  across  a  valley
on the summit of the mountain she is hiking. He is yelling insults
to “get off my mountain” and throwing rocks in her direction. The
rocks  fall  harmlessly  short  by  approximately  one  quarter  of  a
mile.  Lucia  decides  to  abandon  her  hike  rather  than  get  any
closer to the wild man.

3. Imminent Apprehension

The ﬁnal qualiﬁcation with respect to the elements of assault is that
the  apprehension  must  have  been  of  an  imminent  battery.  Courts
universally  dismiss  assault  claims  based  upon  threats  of  a  future
battery.  But  just  how  imminent  must  the  threatened  battery  be  in
order  to  qualify?  The  following  case  shows  how  strictly  courts
construe  this  ﬁnal  requirement.  Consider  the  possible  reasons  for
such a strict application of this element.

BROWER v. ACKERLY
943 P.2d 1141 (Wash. Ct. App. 1997)

      , J.

Jordan  Brower,  who  alleges  that  Christopher  and  Theodore
Ackerley  made  anonymous  threatening  telephone  calls  to  him,
appeals  from  a  summary  judgment  dismissal  of  his  claims  against
them. Because the threatened harm was insufﬁciently imminent to be
actionable  as  civil  assault,  we  hold  the  assault  claim  was
appropriately dismissed.

The  plaintiff,  Jordan  Brower,  is  a  Seattle  resident  active  in  civic
affairs.  Christopher  and  Theodore  Ackerley,  in  their  early  twenties  at
the time of the alleged telephone calls, are two sons of the founder of
Ackerley  Communications,  Inc.,  a  company  engaged  in  various
activities  in  Seattle  including  billboard  advertising.  Brower  perceived
billboard  advertising  as  a  visual  blight.  Based  on  his  own
investigation,  he  concluded  that  Ackerley  Communications  had
erected numerous billboards without obtaining permits from the City
of  Seattle;  had  not  given  the  City  an  accurate  accounting  of  its
billboards; and was maintaining a number of billboards that were not
on the tax rolls. In January, 1991, Brower presented his ﬁndings to the
City.  When  the  City  did  not  respond,  Brower  ﬁled  suit  in  October  of

1991  against  the  City  and  Ackerley  Communications  seeking
enforcement of the City’s billboard regulations.

Within  two  days  an  anonymous  male  caller  began  what  Brower
describes  as  “a  campaign  of  harassing  telephone  calls”  to  Brower’s
home that continued over a period of 20 months. The ﬁrst time, the
caller shouted at Brower in an aggressive, meanspirited voice to “get
a  life”  and  other  words  to  that  effect.  Brower  received  at  least  one
more harassing telephone call by January of 1992.

When  the  City  agreed  to  pursue  Brower’s  complaints  about  the
billboard violations, Brower dropped his suit. In April of 1992, the City
that  Ackerley
made  a  public  announcement
Communications  had  erected  dozens  of  illegal  billboards.  Within  a
day  of  that  announcement,  Brower  received  an  angry  telephone  call
from a caller he identiﬁed as the same caller as the ﬁrst call. In a loud,
menacing  voice,  the  caller  told  Brower  that  he  should  ﬁnd  a  better
way  to  spend  his  time.  Two  days  later  there  was  another  call  telling
Brower to “give it up.”

the  effect

to

In July of 1992, shortly after the City Council passed a moratorium
on billboard activity, Brower received another angry anonymous call.
The male voice swore at him and said, “You think you’re pretty smart,
don’t you?” Brower says he seriously wondered whether he was in any
danger  of  physical  harm  from  the  caller.  Over  the  following  months
Brower  continued  to  receive  calls  from  an  unidentiﬁed  male  who  he
says “belittled me, told me what a rotten person I was, and who used
offensive profanity.”

On  July  19,  1993,  the  City  Council  passed  a  new  billboard
ordinance.  At  about  6:30  that  evening  an  angry-voiced  man
telephoned  Brower  and  said  “dick”  in  a  loud  voice  and  hung  up.  At
about 7:30 p.m. the same caller called and said, “I’m going to ﬁnd out
where  you  live  and  I’m  going  to  kick  your  ass.”  At  9:43  p.m.  Brower
received  another  call  from  a  voice  disguised  to  sound,  in  Brower’s
words,  “eerie  and  sinister.”  The  caller  said  “Ooooo,  Jordan,  oooo,

you’re  ﬁnished;  cut  you  in  your  sleep,  you  sack  of  shit.”  Brower
recorded the last two calls on his telephone answering machine.

Brower made a complaint to the police, reporting that he was very
frightened  by  these  calls.  Because  Brower  had  activated  a  call
trapping feature of his telephone service after the third telephone call,
the  police  were  able  to  learn  that  the  call  had  originated  in  the
residence  of  Christopher  Ackerley.  When  contacted  by  the  police,
Christopher  Ackerley  denied  making  the  calls.  He  said  Brower’s
telephone  number  was  in  his  apartment,  and  that  his  brother  Ted
Ackerley  had  been  in  the  apartment  at  the  time  and  perhaps  had
made the calls.

The  City  ﬁled  no  criminal  charges  based  on  the  police  report.
Brower then brought this civil suit against Christopher and Theodore
Ackerley  seeking  compensation  for  the  emotional  distress  he
suffered as the result of the telephone calls. According to Brower, he
interpreted  the  calls  of  July  19  as  a  death  threat,  and  felt  “hunted
down.” He experienced feelings of panic, terror, and insecurity as well
as a rising pulse, light-headedness, sweaty palms, sleeplessness, and
an inability to concentrate that lasted for some time afterward: “Every
day I come home, I worry that someone has burned our house down,
or if my wife is late from work, whether she has been harmed.”

The elements of civil assault have not been frequently addressed
in Washington cases. The gist of the cause of action is “the victim’s
the
apprehension  of
perpetrator’s action or threat.” In the 1910 case of Howell v. Winters,
the Supreme Court relied on a deﬁnition provided in Cooley, Torts (3d
ed.):

imminent  physical  violence  caused  by

An  assault  is  an  attempt,  with  unlawful  force,  to  inflict  bodily  injuries  upon
another,  accompanied  with  the  apparent  present  ability  to  give  effect  to  the
attempt if not prevented. Such would be the raising of the hand in anger, with an
apparent  purpose  to  strike,  and  sufﬁciently  near  to  enable  the  purpose  to  be
carried into effect; the pointing of a loaded pistol at one who is in its range; the
pointing of a pistol not loaded at one who is not aware of that fact and making

an  apparent  attempt  to  shoot;  shaking  a  whip  or  the  ﬁst  in  a  man’s  face  in
anger; riding or running after him in threatening and hostile manner with a club
or other weapon; and the like. The right that is invaded here indicates the nature
of the wrong. Every person has a right to complete and perfect immunity from
hostile  assaults  that  threaten  danger  to  his  person;  “A  right  to  live  in  society
without being put in fear of personal harm.”

According to §31 of the Restatement, words alone are not enough
to make an actor liable for assault “unless together with other acts or
circumstances  they  put  the  other  in  reasonable  apprehension  of  an
imminent harmful or offensive contact with his person.”

Principles
Courts frequently say that
“words alone cannot constitute
an assault,” but then indicate
that words, coupled with the
right circumstances, might fulﬁll
the elements of this claim. Of
course, words are never uttered
in a vacuum but in a particular
set of circumstances.
Interestingly, there are quite a
few instances in tort law where
the spoken word can become
actionable as a tort cause of
action. Beyond assault, where
spoken threats might be
actionable, words harming
another’s reputation might be
considered defamation; false
promises or representations
might constitute fraud;

comment  is  to  similar  effect:
“The  apprehension  created
must be one of imminent contact, as distinguished from any contact
in  the  future.”  [Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts  §29,  cmt.  b.]  The
Restatement  gives  the  following  illustration:  “A  threatens  to  shoot  B
and leaves the room with the express purpose of getting his revolver.
A is not liable to B.” [Restatement (Second) of Torts §29, cmt. c, illus.
4.]

The telephone calls received by Brower on July 19 contained two
explicit threats: “I’m going to ﬁnd out where you live and I’m going to
kick  your  ass,”  and  later,  “you’re  ﬁnished;  cut  you  in  your  sleep.”  The
words  threatened  action  in  the  near  future,  but  not  the  imminent
future.  The  immediacy  of  the  threats  was  not  greater  than  in  the
Restatement’s  illustration  where  A  must  leave  the  room  to  get  his
revolver.  Because  the  threats,  however  frightening,  were  not
accompanied  by  circumstances  indicating  that  the  caller  was  in  a
position to reach Brower and inflict physical violence “almost at once,”
we afﬁrm the dismissal of the assault claim.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Imminent Battery.  The court in Brower uses an illustration from
the Restatement to ﬁnd that the apprehension of the plaintiff was not
of an imminent harmful contact, but one too remote to be actionable

as assault. This case demonstrates that even a reasonable threat of a
possible  future  battery  will  not  be  actionable  as  assault.  Why  would
courts insist upon an imminent threat in order to provide a remedy?
Aren’t there some threats of such harm in the future that would cause
an ordinary person to suffer great emotional distress?

2.  Intentional  Infliction  of  Emotional  Distress.   A  tort  we  will  be
covering  later  in  this  chapter — intentional  infliction  of  emotional
distress — was also alleged by the plaintiff in this case. In a separate
portion of the opinion, the court held that the plaintiff might be able to
recover under that theory.

3. Highly Sensitive Plaintiff.   Perhaps  the  plaintiffs  in  Bouton  and
Brower  were  unusually  prone  to  being  easily  frightened.  If  so,  under
black  letter  law  they  would  fail  the  test  for  having  a  “reasonable”
apprehension  of  an  imminent  battery  and  be  denied  recovery.  But
what  if  a  defendant  acted  on  purpose  to  cause  such  fright,  with  full
knowledge  of  the  plaintiff’s  unusual  skittishness  and  with  the  desire
to  take  advantage  of  the  plaintiff’s  unusual  sensitivity?  Is  it  fair  to
deny recovery in such circumstances? If, for example, an associate of
the eccentric Howard Hughes made an idle comment about planning
to kiss him on the cheek to instill fear and cause Howard Hughes to
give  him  a  job  promotion,  should  it  be  a  defense  that  a  reasonable
person  would  have  perceived  no  real  threat  and  suffered  no
apprehension?  While  there  are  no  reported  cases  involving  such
scenarios, some commentators believe that when the actor engages
in conduct with full knowledge of the unusual sensitivity of the victim
and  for  the  purpose  of  instilling  an  apprehension  of  an  imminent
battery, liability for assault should be permitted as an exception to the
normal  rule  requiring  the  apprehension  to  be  reasonable.  See
Restatement of Torts (Second) §27, cmt. a (1965).

3. Problems.  In which of the following scenarios can the plaintiff

prove a reasonable apprehension of an imminent battery?

A. Within a post ofﬁce, one employee sitting at his desk looks up to
see another enraged co-employee running toward him shouting,
“I can’t stand seeing you look at me anymore.”

B. A teenager ﬁnds a post on his Facebook page one evening from
a  jealous  schoolmate  saying,  “you  will  not  awake  in  the
morning.”

C.  An  angry  father  threatens  a  boy  dropping  off  his  date  on  her
front  porch  by  saying,  “If  I  ever  see  you  on  this  property  again
you’re going to get a whooping.”

D.  As  a  senior  citizen  walks  down  a  dark  alley,  a  shadowy  ﬁgure
with  a  sinister  smile  steps  in  front  of  the  senior  citizen,
brandishing a wooden stick.

C. Transfer of Intent

We  have  already  seen  how  the  intent  generally  associated  with  the
torts  of  battery  and  assault  are  somewhat  different — the  former
involving  an  intention  to  make  harmful  contact,  and  the  latter
involving  the  intention  to  cause  the  imminent  apprehension  of  such
contact. What happens if one intends a harmful contact and misses,
but the other still experiences a reasonable apprehension of the near
miss? Or what if the contact occurs but the victim, seeing the contact
about  to  occur,  experiences  this  apprehension?  What  about  the
person who merely intends to scare someone with such contact but
accidentally  hits  the  victim?  Finally,  what  liability  attaches  if  the
defendant  intends  to  hit  Joe,  but  misses  and  hits  Jane  standing
nearby  instead?  The  following  case  helps  to  answer  each  of  these
hypothetical situations by discussing and applying the tort doctrine of
transferred intent.

HALL v. McBRYDE

919 P.2d 910 (Colo. Ct. App. 1996)

    , J.

Plaintiff,  Eric  Hall,  appeals  from  a  judgment  entered  in  favor  of

defendant, Marcus McBryde (Marcus), on a claim of battery . . . .

On  January  14,  1993,  Marcus  was  at  his  parents’  home  with
another  youth  after  school.  Although,  at  that  time,  Marcus  was,
in  a  different
pursuant  to  his  parents’  wishes,  actually
neighborhood with a relative and attending a different high school in
the  hope  of  avoiding  gang-related  problems,  he  had  sought  and
received  permission  from  his  father  to  come  to  the  McBryde  house
that  day  to  retrieve  some  clothing.  Prior  to  that  date,  Marcus  had
discovered  a  loaded  gun  hidden  under  the  mattress  of  his  parents’
bed. James McBryde had purchased the gun sometime earlier.

living

Soon  after  midday,  Marcus  noticed  some  other  youths  in  a  car
approaching  the  McBryde  house,  and  he  retrieved  the  gun  from  its
hiding  place.  After  one  of  the  other  youths  began  shooting  towards
the  McBryde  house,  Marcus  ﬁred  four  shots  toward  the  car
containing the other youths.

During  the  exchange  of  gunﬁre  one  bullet  struck  plaintiff,  who
lived next to the McBryde residence, causing an injury to his abdomen
that required extensive medical treatment. Although plaintiff testiﬁed
that it was Marcus who shot him, the trial court made no ﬁnding as to
whether plaintiff was struck by a bullet ﬁred by Marcus.

[P]laintiff contends that the trial court erred in entering judgment

for Marcus on the claim of battery. We agree.

An  actor  is  subject  to  liability  to  another  for  battery  if  he  or  she
acts  intending  to  cause  a  harmful  or  offensive  contact  with  the
person of the other or a third person, or an imminent apprehension of
such a contact, and a harmful or offensive contact with the person of
the other directly or indirectly results. Restatement (Second) of Torts
§§13, 18 (1965); W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, D. Owen, Prosser &

Keeton  on  the  Law  of  Torts  §9  (5th  ed.  1985);  See  Whitley  v.
Andersen, 551 P.2d 1083 (Colo. App. 1976), aff’d, 570 P.2d 525 (Colo.
1977).

Here,  the  trial  court  found
that  there  was  no  evidence

indicating
intended  to  shoot  at  plaintiff.
upon
Furthermore,
statements  by  Marcus  that  he
was not purposely trying to hit
the  other  youths  but,  instead,
was  shooting  at  their  car,  the
trial  court  also  determined  that  plaintiff  had  failed  to  prove  Marcus
intended to make contact with any person other than plaintiff. Based
upon  this  second  ﬁnding  .  .  .  the  trial  court  concluded  that  the
doctrine  of  transferred  intent  could  not  apply  to  create  liability  for
battery upon plaintiff. We conclude that, in reaching its determination
that  no  battery  occurred,  the  trial  court  did  not  properly  analyze  the
intent required for battery or the transferability of such intent.

As set forth above, the intent element for battery is satisﬁed if the
actor either intends to cause a harmful or offensive contact or if the
actor  intends  to  cause  an  imminent  apprehension  of  such  contact.
Moreover,  with  respect  to  the  level  of  intent  necessary  for  a  battery
and the transferability of such intent, Restatement (Second) of Torts
§16 (1965) provides as follows:

(1) If an act is done with the intention of inflicting upon another an offensive but
not a harmful bodily contact, or of putting another in apprehension of either a
harmful or offensive bodily contact, and such act causes a bodily contact to the
other, the actor is liable to the other for a battery although the act was not done
with the intention of bringing about the resulting bodily harm.

(2)  If  an  act  is  done  with  the  intention  of  affecting  a  third  person  in  the
manner  stated  in  Subsection  (1),  but  causes  a  harmful  bodily  contact  to
another,  the  actor  is  liable  to  such  other  as  fully  as  though  he  intended  so  to

affect  him.  See  also  Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts  §20  (1965);  Alteiri  v.
Colasso,  362  A.2d  798  (Conn.  1975)  (when  one  intends  an  assault,  then,  if
bodily injury results to someone other than the person whom the actor intended
to put in apprehension of harm, it is a battery actionable by the injured person).

Here,  the  trial  court  considered  only  whether  Marcus  intended  to
inflict  a  contact  upon  the  other  youths.  It  did  not  consider  whether
Marcus intended to put the other youths in apprehension of a harmful
or offensive bodily contact.

However,  we  conclude,  as  a  matter  of  law,  that  by  aiming  and
ﬁring  a  loaded  weapon  at  the  automobile  for  the  stated  purpose  of
protecting  his  house,  Marcus  did  intend  to  put  the  youths  who
occupied the vehicle in apprehension of a harmful or offensive bodily
contact.  Hence,  pursuant  to  the  rule  set  forth  in  Restatement
(Second)  of  Torts  §16(2)  (1965),  Marcus’  intent  to  place  other
persons  in  apprehension  of  a  harmful  or  offensive  contact  was
sufﬁcient to satisfy the intent requirement for battery against plaintiff.
Accordingly,  we  conclude  that  the  cause  must  be  remanded  for
additional  ﬁndings  as  to  whether  the  bullet  that  struck  plaintiff  was
ﬁred  by  Marcus.  If  the  trial  court  ﬁnds  that  the  bullet  was  ﬁred  by
Marcus, it shall ﬁnd in favor of plaintiff on the battery claim and enter
judgment for damages as proven by plaintiff on that claim.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Transfer  Between  Torts  and  Persons.   The  transfer  of  intent
doctrine  helps  to  solve  two  different  potential  problems  a  victim
might  have,  both  illustrated  by  the  Hall  case.  One  problem  was  that
the defendant did not intend to shoot anyone, yet was being sued for
battery.  The  other  problem  was  that  the  defendant’s  conduct  (i.e.,
trying  to  frighten  those  in  the  car)  was  directed  toward  someone
other than the plaintiff.

2. Transfer  of  Intent  Between  Victims.   Courts  generally  will  apply
the  transfer  of  intent  doctrine  to  permit  the  unintended  victim  to
recover,  so  long  as  the  defendant  has  the  intent  to  commit  the  tort
against another. You have seen several cases already where the court
mentioned  the  policy  of  permitting  the  innocent  victim  to  recover
against  someone  who  had  the  requisite  bad  intent.  This  policy  is
embodied in the transfer of intent doctrine as well.

3. Transfer of Intent Between Torts.  Certainly courts will permit the
intent  to  commit  an  assault  to  transfer  to  a  battery  cause  of  action,
and  vice  versa.  This  makes  sense  because  assault  and  battery  are
such  related  causes  of  action.  Although  there  is  some  historic
precedent  for  permitting  this  doctrine  to  apply  among  other
intentional  torts,  modern  application  of  this  doctrine  between  torts
other than assault and battery is very rare.

4. Self-defense.  If the original intent was not wrongful there is no
wrongful  bad  intent  to  transfer  to  another  tort  cause  of  action.  The
facts  in  Hall  indicate  a  possible  argument  by  the  defendant  of  self-
defense or defense of property. If such a defense were found valid on
these  facts,  the  plaintiff  would  be  unable  to  recover  against  the
defendant because the original action would have been justiﬁed. The
defendant  in  Hall  did  not  apparently  raise  any  such  defense.  These
defenses, among others, are covered in the next chapter.

Upon Further Review

The tort of assault protects one’s particular state of mind — the
right  to  be  free  from  the  imminent  apprehension  of  being
battered.  This  claim  is  often  coupled  with  a  battery  cause  of
action  when  the  apprehension  is  followed  by  the  harmful  or
offensive  contact.  Because  victims  are  often  aware  of  the
impending  battery,  assault  claims  are  frequently  coupled  with
battery  claims;  this  coupling  occurs  so  frequently  that  courts
and lawyers commonly use the phrase “assault and battery.” But
remember that one claim might exist without the other. If you are
on the receiving end of a harmful contact but did not know it was
about to happen, you have a battery without an assault. And any
time  there  is  an  attempted,  but  unsuccessful  battery,  there  still
might be an assault if the intended victim was aware of the near
miss.  The  close  relationship  between  these  two  particular  torts
is at the heart of the doctrine of transfer of intent.

IV  FALSE IMPRISONMENT

A. Introduction

The  tort  of  false  imprisonment  is  designed  to  protect  and  address
intrusions  on  the  victim’s  autonomy — speciﬁcally,  threats  to  the
victim’s  freedom  to  physically  move  from  place  to  place.  This  tort
claim  has  been  recognized  for  a  long  time.  We  all  face  certain
limitations  on  our  movement.  Twelve-year-olds  cannot  drive  the
family  car,  and  must  be  physically  present  at  school  in  their  seat  at
8:00 a.m. on Monday mornings. A mid-level manager has to arrive for
work  in  a  timely  manner  and  stay  at  his  desk  except  for  lunch  and
bathroom breaks. You must generally stop at a red light and cannot
proceed  through  the  intersection,  until  granted  permission  by  the
green light. These intrusions are not the subject of this tort cause of
action. As you read the following cases, try to distill the key elements
of  a  false  imprisonment  claim  that  help  to  differentiate  between
inconveniences  that  our  society  tolerates,  and  misconduct  that  so
threatens one’s liberty interest as to give rise to a common law cause
of action for false imprisonment.

B. The Elements

As  you  read  the  Kern  case  below,  ask  yourself  what  are  the  key
ingredients in a claim for false imprisonment. Much of the dispute on
appeal  in  Kern  relates  to  a  dispute  as  to  what  the  tort  involves.
Speciﬁcally,  the  defendant  sheriff  asserts  that  his  good  faith
precludes a ﬁnding of a false imprisonment. Plaintiff argues that the
sheriff’s  good  or  bad  faith  is  not  material  to  the  claim.  Defendant
contends  that  because  he  did  not  intend  to  commit  any  wrongful

conduct,  he  cannot  be  liable  for  an  intentional  tort.  Pay  close
attention to what must be intended for the tort of false imprisonment.

1. Intent to Detain

WILLIAM WHIRL v. C.V. (BUSTER) KERN
407 F.2d 781 (5th Cir. 1968)

        , J.

We  review  here,  in  an  action  for  false  imprisonment  under  Texas
law  the  custodial  derelictions  of  a  Texas  sheriff.  The  sheriff  is
accused  of  wrongfully  overextending  to  an  inmate  of  his  jail  the
hospitality of his hostelry and the pleasure of his cuisine. The jury in
the court below found for the sheriff. We reverse.

The evidence in this case is largely undisputed. On September 9,
1962, the appellant, William Whirl, was arrested on suspicion of felony
theft by the City of Houston police and placed in the Houston city jail.
Two days later Whirl was transferred to the Harris County jail where
he was booked, identiﬁed, and deprived, of the use of his artiﬁcial leg.
On  September  20,  1962,  an  examining  trial  was  held  and  Whirl  was
bound  over  to  the  Harris  County  Grand  Jury.  Some  weeks  later  the
Grand  Jury  returned  two  indictments  against  him,  one  for  burglary
and one for theft.

Harris County Sheriff C.V.
“Buster” Kern, who served in
ofﬁce from 1949-1972, oversaw
several large county jails.

On  November  4,  1962,  on
the  motion  of
the  Harris
County  District  Attorney,  the
indictments  pending  against
Whirl  were  dismissed  by  a
[criminal  court]
judge.  The
District  Attorney  had  sought
and  obtained  dismissal  of  the

that the evidence against Whirl
was  “insufﬁcient  to  obtain  and

and  a  list  of  dismissals  was

months  after  all  charges  against  him  were  dismissed,  and  was  not
restored to his freedom until July 25, 1963.

of

The breakdown in communication which led to Whirl’s prolonged
detention is not easy to trace. Documents are constantly transmitted
among  the  courts,  the  District  Clerk’s  ofﬁce,  the  District  Attorney’s
ofﬁce,  and  the  Sheriff’s  ofﬁce,  and  recollection  as  to  what  happened
in  any  particular  instance  is  necessarily  vague.  Nevertheless,  it  is
in  Whirl’s  case  occurred
clear  that  the  communication  failure
primarily between the District Clerk’s ofﬁce and the Sheriff’s ofﬁce.

Ordinarily,  when  charges  are  dismissed  by  a  nolle  prosequi,  a
member  of  the  District  Clerk’s  staff  prepares  a  dismissal  slip  and
forwards  it  to  the  Warrant  Division  of  the  Sheriff’s  ofﬁce.  Since  the
two  ofﬁces  are  in  the  same  building  along  with  the  jail,  such
communications are routinely made several times a day.

“Nolle prosequi” is a Latin
phrase used to describe a
formal entry upon the record by

is  also
customary  for  deputies  in  the
Sheriff’s ofﬁce to make trips to
the  District  Clerk’s  ofﬁce  in  order  to  check  the  dismissal  book
themselves.

It

On  the  occasion  following  termination  of  charges  against  Whirl,
dismissals  had  been  rather  numerous.  As  a  result  the  Clerk’s  ofﬁce
prepared  a  list  of  cases  which  had  been  dismissed  instead  of  the
usual  individual  dismissal  slip  for  each  prisoner.  This  procedure,
though rare, had been used before on similar occasions. Whirl’s name
was  unquestionably  included  on  that  list,  and  the  list  was  duly
received by the Sheriff’s ofﬁce. Whirl’s name was also entered in the
dismissal book.

For some reason never adequately explained, the list of dismissals
was  not  processed,  and  Whirl’s  freedom  was  lost  in  a  shuffle  of
papers.  Being  too  poor  to  raise  bail,  he  was  forced  to  remain  in  the
courthouse  lockup.  Months  later  when  attempts  to  set  his  case  for
trial prompted the District Attorney to check his ﬁle, it was discovered
that  all  charges  against  him  had  been  dismissed.  Following  his
release, Whirl ﬁled this suit.

Whirl  brought  his  action  against  C.V.  (Buster)  Kern,  the  Sheriff  of
Harris  County,  Texas.  Trial  was  to  a  jury.  At  the  close  of  all  the
evidence, plaintiff moved for a directed verdict, and when his motion
was  denied,  the  case  was  submitted  to  the
jury  on  special
interrogatories  as  to  negligence,  contributory  negligence,  proximate
cause,  and  damages.  The  jury  found  that  Kern  was  not  negligent  in
detaining  Whirl
in  custody.  It  also  found  that  Whirl  was  not
contributorily negligent in failing to seek his own release, and that he
had  suffered  no  damages  as  a  result  of  his  imprisonment.  On  this
appeal, Whirl contends that the district court erred in not granting his

motion for a directed verdict and in denying his motion for a new trial
as to damages. Appellant argues that all the elements of his cause of
action  under  the  Texas  law  of  false  imprisonment  were  established
as a matter of law by the undisputed evidence, and that no fact issue
apart from damages remained for the jury. He further argues that the
jury’s  ﬁnding  of  no  damages  was  contrary  to  the  weight  of  the
evidence  and  that  the  district  court  erred  in  instructing  the  jury  to
disregard  the  removal  of  appellant’s  artiﬁcial  leg  in  assessing  the
extent of his injury.

Appellee, Kern, responds to these allegations of error by defending
each act of the district court [by contending] that his incarceration of
Whirl was entirely free of improper motive or unlawful intent.

We turn to appellant’s contention that he was entitled as a matter
of  law  to  a  directed  verdict  on  the  question  of  liability.  Appellant’s
argument  in  brief  is  that  the  common  law  of  false  imprisonment
[does  not]  require  that  a  jailer  have  actual  knowledge  that  his
prisoner’s  incarceration  is  contrary  to  law.  Whirl  contends  that
negligence  is  not  an  element  of  false  imprisonment  and  that  the
“good faith” of a jailer is neither a defense to nor a justiﬁcation for an
unlawful restraint.

While  the  issue  of  Sheriff  Kern’s  “good  faith”  in  conﬁning  Whirl  in
prison was never in so many words presented to the jury, we do not
involve ourselves in the semantics of whether or not a ﬁnding of non-
negligence is tantamount to a ﬁnding of good faith. As we read [prior
case  law]  neither  good  faith  nor  non-negligence  can  exculpate  Kern
from liability.

[Cases relied upon by Sheriff Kern] were on their facts, false arrest
cases and not false imprisonment cases. While it is certainly true that
false
false  arrest  cases  are  often  denominated  actions
imprisonment,  false  imprisonment  deriving  from  an  arrest  and  false
imprisonment  where  no  arrest  has  occurred  are  in  substance  quite
different. Admittedly, a person who is falsely arrested is at the same

for

time  falsely  imprisoned,  yet  “it  is  not  necessary,  to  commit  false
imprisonment, either to intend to make an arrest or actually to make
an  arrest.”  32  Am.  Jur.  2d,  False  Imprisonment,  §2  (1968).  “False
arrest  is  merely  one  means  of  committing  a  false  imprisonment.”
Harrer v. Montgomery Ward & Co., 1950, 221 P.2d 428, 433.

In ascertaining whether the Supreme Court intended the defense
of  “good  faith”  to  apply  to  false  imprisonment  as  well  as  to  false
arrest, we must not allow a superﬁcial similarity between essentially
different causes of action to dictate the purpose which the good faith
defense is meant to serve. There can be no quarrel with the fact that
“good  faith”  in  the  circumstances  of  an  arrest  is  a  necessary  and
historically  validated  defense.  As  said  by  the  Supreme  Court,  “A
policeman’s  lot  is  not  so  unhappy  that  he  must  choose  between
being charged with dereliction of duty if he does not arrest when he
has  probable  cause,  and  being  mulcted  in  damages  if  he  does.”  386
U.S. at 555.

The reasons for this broad protection are clear. An arrest is often a
stressful and unstable situation calling for discretion, speed, and on-
the-spot  evaluation.  As  a  result,  constabulary  latitudinarianism  is
important,  and  peace  ofﬁcers  are  and  must  be  endowed  with
privileges  not  accorded  to  ordinary  citizens.  In  the  words  of  the
editors of the Restatement of Torts, Second:

The  additional  privilege  is  given  because  the  peace  ofﬁcer  has  a  duty  to  the
public  to  prevent  crime  and  arrest  criminals;  the  performance  of  these  duties
would  be  seriously  impaired  unless  peace  ofﬁcers  were  given  considerable

§121, Comment (b) and (c) at 206.

Appellees  urge  that  the  above  rule  is  their  shield  and  protection.
However,  the  breadth  of  a  peace  ofﬁcer’s  privilege  in  an  arrest
situation is not necessarily the test of the breadth of a jailer’s privilege
in the context of a false imprisonment. There is no privilege in a jailer

to  keep  a  prisoner  in  jail  beyond  the  period  of  his  lawful  sentence.
While  a  jailer  cannot  be  held  liable  for  errors  in  a  warrant  of
commitment fair and valid on its face, it is also the law that where a
prisoner  is  held  in  jail  without  a  court  order  or  written  mittimus,  the
jailer is liable for false imprisonment. The fact that the jailer is without
personal  knowledge  that  the  prisoner  is  held  unlawfully  does  not
constitute a defense to an action for false imprisonment. In fact, “An
illegal  imprisonment  must  be  treated  as  a  wrong  from  its  very
inception,  and  it  matters  not  on  what  date  knowledge  of  such
illegality is acquired.” Emanuele v. State, 1964, 250 N.Y.S.2d 361, 366.

of justiﬁable reliance upon a warrant of commitment valid on its face.

by  a  grand  jury  still  leaves  questions  for  judicial  determination.
Proceedings against Whirl were terminated by the actions of a court
of competent jurisdiction. While not easily characterized, the case at
bar  seems  to  us  closest  to  the  situation  where  the  jailer  keeps  a

the

We  do  not  ﬁnd  any  cases  nor  are  we  referred  to  any  by  counsel
which provide that “good faith” is a defense to an imprisonment that
is not only without valid process, but contrary to it. Nor do we believe
as a matter of federal policy that such a defense should be available
to a jailer in circumstances like those before us. The responsibility for
a  failure  of  communication  between  the  courts  and  the  jailhouse
cannot  justiﬁably  be  placed  on  the  head  of  a  man  immured  in  a
lockup  when  the  action  of  the  court  has  become  a  matter  of  public
record. Ignorance and alibis by a jailer should not vitiate the rights of
a man entitled to his freedom. A jailer, unlike a policeman, acts at his
leisure. He is not subject to the stresses and split-second decisions of
an arresting ofﬁcer, and his acts in discharging a prisoner are purely

ministerial. Moreover, unlike his prisoner, the jailer has the means, the
freedom, and the duty to make necessary inquiries. While not a surety
for  the  legal  correctness  of  a  prisoner’s  commitment,  he  is  most
certainly  under  an  obligation,  often  statutory,  to  carry  out  the
functions  of  his  ofﬁce.  Those  functions  include  not  only  the  duty  to
protect a prisoner, but also the duty to effect his timely release.

The central issue in this case is one of privilege, not of intent; one
of  law,  not  of  fact.  The  tort  of  false  imprisonment  is  an  intentional
tort. Restatement of Torts, Second, §44. It is committed when a man
intentionally  deprives  another  of  his  liberty  without  the  other’s
consent and without adequate legal justiﬁcation. Failure to know of a
court proceeding terminating all charges against one held in custody
is  not,  as  a  matter  of  law,  adequate  legal  justiﬁcation  for  an
unauthorized  restraint.  Were  the  law  otherwise,  Whirl’s  nine  months
could  easily  be  nine  years,  and  those  nine  years,  ninety-nine  years,
and still as a matter of law no redress would follow. The law does not
hold the value of a man’s freedom in such low regard.

The sheriff, of course, must have some protection too. His duty to
his prisoner is not breached until the expiration of a reasonable time
for the proper ascertainment of the authority upon which his prisoner
is  detained.  We  are  not  to  be  interpreted  as  holding  that  a  sheriff
commits  an  instant  tort  at  the  moment  when  his  prisoner  should
have been released. However, in the present case what is or is not a
reasonable  time  is  not  at  issue.  It  may  safely  be  said  that  Kern’s
ignorance  for  nine
long  months  after  the  termination  of  all
proceedings  against  Whirl  was,  as  a  matter  of  law,  ignorance  for  an
unreasonable time.

The  Texas  law  of  false  imprisonment  zealously  safeguards  the
rights  of  citizens  to  be  free  of  unlawful  arrest  and  unlawful  prison
detention. Persons found guilty of false imprisonment are subject to
both criminal and civil penalties.

Good  faith  may  clear  the  conscience,  but  it  does  not  redeem  or
purge  the  act.  [T]he  duty  to  release  is  absolute  if  no  such  authority
exists,  and  such  duty  cannot  be  conditioned  on  notice,  solicitation,
ignorance  or  blindness.  Ignorance  of  the  law  is  traditionally  no
excuse,  even  when  a  man’s  own  liberty  is  at  stake.  Should  it  be  a
defense for ofﬁcers of the law whose sworn duty it is to protect the
liberty  of  others?  Are  a  sheriff’s  statutory  obligations  to  be  effective
in  willful  disobedience  of  his  ofﬁcial
only  when  he  acts
responsibilities?

The  evidence  is  undisputed  that  Kern  could  have  known  of  the
dismissal  of  charges  against  Whirl  had  he  only  made  inquiry.  But
inquiry  he  did  not  make,  and  as  a  consequence  Whirl,  quasi-literate
and  one-legged,  languished  in  jail  for  nine  months  after  he  was
entitled to be free of his fetters. Unfortunately, non-malicious restraint
is no sweeter than restraint evilly motivated, and we cannot sanction
chains without legal justiﬁcation even if they be forged by the hand of
an  angel.  Neither  the  sheriff’s  tears  of  regret  nor  explanations  keyed
the  lock  to  unmanacle  Whirl.  Though  we  apply  all  the  benign
adjectives  in  our  lexicon  to  Kern’s  watchmanship — these  do  not
make Whirl a November to July free man.

As  we  understand  the  Texas  law  of  false  imprisonment,  read  in
conjunction  with  the  statutory  duties  of  the  sheriff  as  keeper  of  the
county jail, non-negligence is no modiﬁer of liability. Sheriff Kern had
an unyielding duty to know his prisoner’s sentence time, and this duty
was not discharged.

Viewed  on  one  level,  the  facts  of  this  case  involve  nothing  more
grandiloquent  than  paper  pushing  between  ofﬁcers  in  the  Harris
County  Courthouse.  Yet  we  must  never  forget  that  we  are  dealing
with a man’s liberty, and a game of who has the paper and who saw
the paper is not constitutionally playable. This must be borne in mind
in  the  assessment  of  damages.  Traditionally  the  fact  of  an  illegal
restraint  creates  the  right  to  recover  at  least  nominal  damages.
Perhaps in some circumstances that is all a man’s freedom is worth,

but though the price tag be a bargain, freedom is never valueless. A
jury ﬁnding that a man’s freedom is worthless is clearly erroneous. It
is an impossible judgment to render against a sentient person, be he
one legged, unschooled, friendless or without earning capacity.

There is the promise outstanding that the courts will redress the
false imprisonment of any man, “no matter how poor or obscure, and
no  matter  what  may  be  his  station  in  life.”  McBeath v. Campbell,  12
S.W.2d at 122. Let that promise be fulﬁlled.

Texas Pattern Jury Charge 6.1: False Imprisonment

Did Don David falsely imprison Paul Payne?

“Falsely  imprison”  means  to  willfully  detain  another
person  without  legal  justiﬁcation,  against  his  consent,
whether such detention be effected by violence, by threat,
or by any other means that restrains a person from moving
from one place to another.

Texas Pattern Jury Charge 6.2: Unlawful Detention by Threat

“Detention by threat, violence, or other means” requires

ordinary person just fear of injury to his person, reputation
or property.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Roles  of  Judges  and  Juries.   Most  tort  cases  that  survive  the
pretrial  motion  process  are  submitted  to  juries  for  ﬁnal  resolution.

Juries are considered the “judges of the facts,” which means that they
are to determine the true facts that gave rise to a claim. In fact, their
job is somewhat broader than this sounds. In reality, they are charged
with applying the law to the evidence to determine if a cause of action
should prevail or not. So long as the trial judge believes that a rational
jury  might  ﬁnd  for  either  party,  there  exists  what  is  called  in  Civil
Procedure a “genuine issue of material fact.” This is why parties have
trials — to  determine  what  really  happened.  Where  the  important
facts  are  undisputed,  the  judge  can  declare  the  litigation  winner  by
applying  the  law  to  those  facts.  In  submitting  a  case  to  a  jury,  the
judge  will  often  rely  upon  pattern  jury  instructions  that  attempt  to
summarize  the  law  to  the  jury.  In  the  Kern  case,  above,  the  court
decided that the elements of the tort claim of false imprisonment did
not  require  any  attention  from  the  jury  because  the  important  facts
were  not  disputed.  At  the  end  of  the  opinion,  the  court  reverses  the
judgment that had been rendered for the defendant and remands the
case solely for a new trial on the issue of damages.

2. Criminal vs. Civil Law.  One potential area of confusion from this
case is the interplay between criminal law and procedure, and our civil
tort system. How does the status of the criminal charges impact the
accrual of a civil cause of action in this case for false imprisonment?
Further,  how  might  the  same  conduct  give  rise  to  both  a  criminal
prosecution and a civil cause of action? What would be the purpose
of  permitting  both  criminal  and  civil  cases  to  proceed  against  the
same person?

5.  Accidents  as

Intentional  Torts.

It  may  be  difﬁcult  to
comprehend how someone like the plaintiff could simply fall between
the  cracks  for  nine  months.  Of  course,  the  Harris  County  Sheriff’s
Ofﬁce is a very large operation. It is the third largest sheriff’s ofﬁce in
the United States, behind Los Angeles and Cook County (Illinois), and
currently  employs  over  3,500  staff  overseeing  11,000  prisoners  at
any one time. This might help to explain the accidental over-detention
of the plaintiff. Since all indications are that the defendant in this case
was  not  trying  to  do  any  wrong,  why  was  an  intentional  tort  theory
applicable?  For  any  particular  intentional  tort  claim,  you  must  be
precise  in  your  understanding  as  to  what  exactly  must  be  intended.
For  the  intentional  tort  of  false  imprisonment,  courts  agree  that  all
that must be intended is the detention. There is no requirement that

the  detention  occur  maliciously  or  with  some  evil  intent.  The
Restatement (Second) of Torts §8(A) deﬁnes the intent, or degree of
willfulness,  needed  in  an  intentional  tort  claim  as  follows:  “Intent  [is
when]  the  actor  desires  to  cause  consequences  of  his  act,
or  .  .  .  believes  that  the  consequences  are  substantially  certain  to
result  from  it.”  Why  are  the  facts  undisputed  with  regard  to  the
defendant’s intent to detain the plaintiff in Whirl?

6.  Damages.   The  subject  of  awarding  damages,  whether
compensatory,  nominal,  or  punitive,  is  covered  in  Chapter  8  of  this
book.  Many  damage  principles  apply  across  the  lines  of  various  tort
causes  of  action.  But  sometimes  there  are  particular  damage  rules
that uniquely apply to a particular cause of action. In another portion
of  the  Kern  opinion,  the  court  indicated  that  the  different  type  of
damages  that  might  be  recoverable  for  false  imprisonment  could
include pain and suffering, emotional distress, and lost earnings while
incarcerated.  In  addition,  the  court  mentions  the  availability  of
nominal damages — damages in “name only” that are a token award
in the absence of actual harm to at least provide some philosophical
vindication  of  the  plaintiff’s  rights.  These  damage  concepts  are
covered in substantial detail later in Chapter 8 of this book.

7. Problem.  Before you begin thinking that the facts in Kern are so
bizarre  that  the  case  has  little  real-world  application,  consider  the
facts  from  the  more  recent  incident  at  the  McLennan  County  jail  in
Waco,  Texas  in  2012.  At  the  end  of  the  newspaper  story  set  forth
below, the lawyer for the wrongly incarcerated gentlemen indicates he
for  false
will  consider  exploring  a  possible  civil  tort  claim
imprisonment. If you were the lawyer, after reading the Kern decision,
what would your advice be?

WACO MAN WRONGLY JAILED FOR 83 DAYS MAY
SUE COUNTY

By Tommy Witherspoon

A  Waco  man  is  deciding  if  he  will  sue  the  county  because  he
was wrongfully detained for 83 days after the district attorney’s
ofﬁce  declined  his  case  for  prosecution  but  failed  to  notify  the
McLennan County Jail.

Damion  Wayne  Evans,  33,  stayed  in  the  county  jail  with  no
other  charges  pending  against  him  for  almost  three  months
after the district attorney’s ofﬁce declined to prosecute him on a
tampering with physical evidence charge.

District Attorney Abel Reyna said Evans’ improperly extended
incarceration  was  the  fault  of  his  ofﬁce.  His  staff  did  not  fax  a
case disposition report to the sheriff’s ofﬁce so it would know to
release Evans.

“I will accept responsibility for the error in my ofﬁce, and my
apologies  go  to  Mr.  Evans,”  Reyna  said.  “Though  it  doesn’t
change  what  happened  to  him,  the  only  thing  I  can  do  is  work
hard to make sure it doesn’t happen again.”

The  decision  to  refuse  the  case  was  made  Oct.  25,  two
weeks  after  Evans’  arrest.  Once  that  decision  was  made,  the
disposition  report  should  have  been  sent  to  the  jail  and  Evans
should have been released, Reyna said.

But  the  error  was  not  discovered  until  Jan.  17,  after  Evans’
attorney, David Bass, ﬁled a motion asking Judge Ralph Strother
to set a bail Evans could afford because he had been in jail more
than 90 days and had not been indicted.
“The  normal  thing  that  happens

is  they  send  over  a
disposition report to the jail that the case was not accepted on
this particular date, and if there are no other holds on him, they
turn him loose,” Bass said.

“That  is  what  is  supposed  to  happen  in  a  perfect  world,  but
that  is  not  what  happened  in  Mr.  Evans’  world.  He  spent

Halloween,  Thanksgiving,  Christmas  and  New  Year’s  locked  up
when he shouldn’t have been,” Bass said.

He  said  he  referred  Evans  to  Waco  attorney  James  Rainey

for possible civil legal action.

“I  am  going  to  investigate  the  matter  to  determine  what
happened, why it happened and ﬁgure out what recourse, if any,
Mr.  Evans  has  for  his  civil  rights  violations  and  his  false
imprisonment,” Rainey said Tuesday.

2. Detention

In  Kern,  the  fact  that  the  defendant  had  “detained”  the  plaintiff  was
pretty  obvious — if  actual  imprisonment  will  not  sufﬁce  for  false
imprisonment, then nothing would. In the following case, the plaintiff
argues that he was detained when defendant made it difﬁcult for him
to  be  transported  in  the  time  and  manner  he  desired.  Consider  the
implications if the court were to rule in favor of the plaintiff.

SMITH v. COMAIR, INC.
134 F.3d 254 (4th Cir. 1998)

         , C.J.

James  Smith  sued  Comair,  Inc.  and  Delta  Airlines,  Inc.  for  false
imprisonment. The district court granted summary judgment in favor
of  Comair  on  the  grounds  that  Smith’s  claim  must  be  dismissed  for
failure  to  state  a  claim.  Smith  appeals.  We  agree  that  Smith’s  tort
claim  should  be  dismissed.  Accordingly,  we  afﬁrm  the  judgment  of
the district court.

Because the instant case comes to us at the summary judgment
stage, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to Smith, the

layover

nonmoving party. On the morning of October 5, 1995, Smith boarded
a 6:40 a.m. Comair flight in Roanoke, Virginia to travel to Minneapolis,
in  the  Cincinnati  airport.  Comair
Minnesota,  with  a
representatives did not ask Smith for proof of identiﬁcation when he
boarded  the  flight  in  Roanoke.  In  Cincinnati,  Smith  met  some
business  associates  and  together  they  attempted  to  board  the  9:00
a.m.  connecting  flight  to  Minneapolis.  When  Smith  began  to  board,
however,  the  Comair  representative  asked  him  “to  step  aside.”  After
complying  with  this  request  and  watching  the  rest  of  the  flight’s
passengers board, Smith asked why he was not permitted to board. A
Comair  representative  told  Smith  that  a  supervisor  would  be  called.
The  supervisor,  Mr.  Price,  arrived  approximately  thirty  minutes  after
the  Minneapolis  flight’s  departure.  According  to  Smith,  Price  would
not  explain  why  Smith  could  not  fly  out  of  the  Cincinnati  airport.
Meanwhile, Smith also noticed for the ﬁrst time two security guards
standing  approximately  ﬁfty  and  seventy  feet  away  observing  him.
Smith testiﬁed that these ofﬁcers watched him throughout the rest of
his stay in the Cincinnati airport.

Three  hours

later,  Price  ﬁnally  told  Smith  he  was  denied
permission to board the Minneapolis flight because he did not match
the physical description contained in his Delta frequent-flyer account.
Smith,  however,  called  his  company’s  travel  agent  and  learned  that
Delta did not maintain a record of physical descriptions in connection
with  frequent-flyer  accounts.  Smith,  therefore,  located  Price  and
confronted  him  with  this  information.  Price  continued  to  insist  that
the  dissimilar  physical  description  was  the  reason  Smith  was  not
permitted to board.

At  approximately  1:00  or  2:00  p.m.,  Price  returned  to  Smith  and
told him the real reason he was refused permission to board was that
the  Roanoke  Comair  representatives  had  failed  to  ask  for  photo
identiﬁcation,  as  shown  by  the  absence  of  pink  highlighting  on  his
boarding  pass.  At  some  point,  Price  explained  that  the  Federal
Aviation Administration (“FAA”) required photo identiﬁcation pursuant

to  security  regulations.  Smith  replied  that  he  could  not  produce  his
driver’s license because he had left it in the glove compartment of his
car, which was parked at the Roanoke airport. Price then asked Smith
instead  for  his  birth  certiﬁcate  and  social  security  card,  neither  of
which  Smith  had  at  the  time.  Smith  offered  to  have  his  physical
description  faxed  by  the  Virginia  Department  of  Motor  Vehicles
(“DMV”)  or  to  pay  Comair’s  expenses  if  they  would  enter  his  car,
retrieve  his  driver’s  license,  and  fly  it  to  Cincinnati  on  the  next
available  flight.  Price  refused  both  options,  as  DMV  could  not  fax  a
photo and entering Smith’s car might expose Comair to liability.

In Practice
You will encounter many
instances in this book where
courts from different states will
follow different rules of law.
Lawyers are strategic about the
position they take on choice of
law issues — which state’s law
should be applied to their case.
Sometimes these
considerations lead lawyers to
ﬁle a case in one state rather
than another, in cases where
multiple venues might be
appropriate.

Finally, sometime after 3:00
p.m.,  Price  gave  Smith  a  ticket
told  him
to  Roanoke  and
Comair would return him there.
While  waiting  to  board  the
flight,  Smith  spoke  to  Price
again  and  stated  that  he  was
so  angry  he  “would
like  to
punch  [Price]  in  the  mouth.”  In
response,  Price  motioned  for
the  two  security  guards  Smith
previously  had  observed,  one
of  whom  was  a  Cincinnati
police  ofﬁcer.  When  the  two
approached  and
restrained
Smith,  Price  asked  them  to
remove  Smith
the
terminal. After Smith explained
his  situation  to  the  guard  and
police ofﬁcer, the ofﬁcer intervened on Smith’s behalf and convinced
Price  to  permit  Smith  to  fly  to  Roanoke.  Smith  then  returned  to
Roanoke.

from

Smith  ﬁled  [this  case  in  Virginia  state  court  alleging  false
imprisonment].  After  the  case  was  removed  to  the  United  States
District  Court  for  the  Western  District  of  Virginia,  the  district  court
granted summary judgment in favor of Comair. The court found that
Smith’s  tort  causes  of  action  failed  to  state  a  claim.  Smith  now
appeals.

[W]e  agree  with  the  district  court  that  he  failed  to  state  a  claim.
Because Virginia follows a lex loci delicti standard, and the incidents
underlying Smith’s claims occurred in the Cincinnati airport located in
northern Kentucky, his tort claims are governed by Kentucky law.

Smith argues he was falsely imprisoned primarily because Comair
flew  him  to  the  Cincinnati  airport  and  stranded  him  there.  These
allegations,  however,  fail  to  state  a  claim  for  this  tort.  Kentucky
deﬁnes false imprisonment as “‘any exercise of force, by which in fact
the  other  person  is  deprived  of  his  liberty  and  compelled  to  remain
where he does not wish to remain or to go where he does not wish to
go.’” Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Mitchell, 877 S.W.2d 616, 617 (Ky. App.
1994). Smith’s evidence simply does not show that he was compelled
either to remain or to go anywhere he did not wish. He conceded that
no Comair representative told him that he must remain in any speciﬁc
part  of  the  airport  or  that  he  was  not  free  to  leave  the  airport.  Price
told Smith only that Comair would not permit him to board the flight
out  of  Cincinnati.  Smith  was  therefore  free  at  all  times  to  leave  the
airport or leave Cincinnati altogether by any means he could arrange
other  than  a  Comair  flight.  False  imprisonment  results  only  if  “the
restraint be a total one, rather than a mere obstruction of the right to
go  where  the  plaintiff  pleases.”  W.  Page  Keeton  et  al.,  Prosser  and
Keeton  on  the  Law  of  Torts  §11,  at  47  (5th  ed.  1984).  Smith  also
briefly asserts that restraint by the security ofﬁcers constituted false
imprisonment. However, even he admits that the ofﬁcers grabbed his
arms  only  momentarily  and  nonforcefully,  and  then  immediately
interceded on his behalf by convincing Price to permit Smith to board

a  flight  back  to  Roanoke.  Smith’s  evidence  thus  fails  to  support  a
claim for false imprisonment.

For  the  foregoing  reasons,  we  afﬁrm  the  judgment  of  the  district

court.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Choice  of  Law.   Observe  that  a  federal  court  judge  sitting  in
Virginia  wrote  this  opinion  but  applied  Kentucky  law  to  decide  the
case. In Civil Procedure, you will learn that federal courts are required
to  apply  state  law  to  claims  that  originate  under  state  rather  than
federal law. That explains the vertical dichotomy between the federal
court  choosing  to  apply  state  law.  There  is  also  a  horizontal
dichotomy as the Virginia court chooses to apply the law of a sister
state.  States  employ  recognized  “conflicts  of  law”  principles  to  help
make  a  reasonable  determination  of  which  state’s  law  ought  to  be
applied to a multistate dispute. The lex loci delicti standard (roughly,
the law of the place of the wrong) is commonly used in a tort suit and
explains why Kentucky law applied here (since the Cincinnati airport
is actually across the Ohio River in Kentucky).

2.  Detention.   Is  it  fair  to  say  that  the  defendant  in  this  case
inhibited  the  plaintiff’s  freedom  of  movement?  Courts  historically
demand  physical  conﬁnement  to  a  bounded  area  in  order  to  ﬁnd  a
detention.  If  the  principle  underlying  recognition  of  the  tort  of  false
imprisonment  is  to  promote  individual  autonomy,  why  restrict  the
tort’s  application  to  more  egregious  forms  of  limitation?  Courts
consider  even  highly  coercive  yet  not  immediate  threats  as  similarly
insufﬁcient  to  constitute  a  detention.  See e.g.,  Snyder  v.  Evangelical
Orthodox  Church,  216  Cal.  App.  3d  297  (1989)  (bishop  not  falsely
imprisoned  when  church  members  demanded  he  meditate
in
isolation for seven days under threat of exposing his adulterous acts,
since he was subject to no physical restraint).

3. Consciousness of Detention.  One minor issue that has received
some focus from courts is whether the victim of false imprisonment
must  be  aware  of  their  conﬁnement  during  the  applicable  time  in
order to have a valid claim. For example, some claims involve young
children  or  others  who  are  incompetent  and  are  not  aware  they  are
being  wrongly  held.  Many  courts  are  willing  to  recognize  a  claim
under  these  circumstances  so  long  as  the  victim  has  some  actual
harm arising out of their detention.

4. Problems.   Consider  whether  the  element  of  detention  needed
for  a  false  imprisonment  claim  is  satisﬁed  in  each  of  the  following
scenarios:

A.  A  teenager  is  about  to  leave  his  home,  when  he  sees  a  bully
from his school standing at the end of his driveway holding a big
stick  in  his  hand  and  staring  at  him  in  a  menacing  manner.
Frightened,  the  boy  stays  inside  of  his  home  for  several  hours
until the other ﬁnally leaves.

B.  At  a  college  party,  to  ensure  that  she  is  not  left  without  a  ride
home,  Sarah  takes  the  keys  from  her  friend  Rosita’s  purse  and
refuses to give them back until Sarah is ready to return home.

C. Shopkeeper’s Privilege

In all likelihood, there are probably more modern false imprisonment
cases  that  arise  in  the  context  of  shoppers  detained  for  suspected
shoplifting  than  any  other  scenario.  While  the  common  law  places
great value on individual liberty, it also recognizes the importance of
property  rights  and  the  need  to  permit  people  to  engage  in  certain
reasonable  behavior  to  protect  their  property  interests.  Balancing
these  sometimes-competing  concerns,  tort
law  has  created  a
shopkeeper’s privilege, which creates a legal justiﬁcation for retailers
to  detain  a  shopper  under  certain  circumstances  and  in  a  certain
manner. In the following case, a Wal-Mart security guard has stopped

one suspected shoplifter on her way out of the store and required her
to  remain.  As  you  read  this  opinion,  look  for  the  prerequisites  for
application  of  this  privilege  and  for  the  limitations  on  its  use  by  the
retailer. Also, compare this privilege with that of the jailer discussed in
Whirl. Why are they so fundamentally different?

WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. RESENDEZ
962 S.W.2d 539 (Tex. 1998)

          .

This case involves the proper scope of authority of law in a false
imprisonment  case.  The  court  of  appeals  afﬁrmed  the  trial  court’s
judgment against Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (“Wal-Mart”) on a jury ﬁnding
of  false  imprisonment.  We  hold  that,  on  the  facts  in  this  case,  Wal-
Mart established as a matter of law that it detained Lucia Resendez
for a reasonable period of time, in a reasonable manner, and upon a
reasonable belief that she had stolen store merchandise. Accordingly,
we  reverse  the  court  of  appeals’  judgment  and  render  judgment  for
Wal-Mart.

On January 20, 1986, Resendez went shopping at Wal-Mart during
her lunch break. While browsing through the store, she began to eat
from  a  bag  of  peanuts  marked  with  a  Wal-Mart  price  sticker.  Raul
Salinas,  a  security  guard  for  Wal-Mart,  followed  Resendez  and
observed  her  place  the  empty  bag  under  a  rose  bush.  He  then
watched  her  purchase  some  items  and  leave  the  store.  After
determining that Resendez had not paid for a bag of peanuts, Salinas
followed her into the parking lot. He accused her of taking the bag of
peanuts  without  paying  and  asked  her  to  accompany  him  back  into
the  store.  Resendez  objected  that  she  bought  the  peanuts  the  day
before  at  another  Wal-Mart  store  and  could  provide  the  receipt  to
prove  it.  She  then  accompanied  Salinas  to  the  back  of  the  store.
Within  about  ten  to  ﬁfteen  minutes  a  police  ofﬁcer  arrived  and

arrested  Resendez.  Resendez  posted  bail  and  was  released  about
one hour later.

of

There  was  no  evidence  to  support  the  contention  that  the
detention  occurred  for  an  unreasonable  period  of  time.  Without
deciding the outer parameters of a permissible period of time under

section 124.001, the ten- to ﬁfteen-minute detention in this case was
not  unreasonable  as  a  matter  of  law.  See  Dominguez  v.  Globe
Discount  City,  Inc.,  470  S.W.2d  919,  920  (Tex.  Civ.  App. — El  Paso
1971, no writ) (ﬁnding a ﬁve- to six-minute detention reasonable even
where the plaintiff was ultimately released by the security guard who
detained her); Meadows v. F.W. Woolworth Co., 254 F. Supp. 907, 909
(N.D.  Fla.  1966)  (ﬁnding  a  ten-minute  detention  reasonable  under  a
similar statute). Also, no evidence exists that the detention occurred
in  an  unreasonable  manner.  The  only  question  is  whether  it  was
reasonable  for  Salinas  to  believe  that  Resendez  had  stolen  the
peanuts. It was.

Based upon the undisputed facts — Resendez looked for peanuts
immediately  upon  entering  the  Wal-Mart  store,  she  was  later  seen
eating  from  a  bag  of  peanuts  marked  with  a  Wal-Mart  price  sticker,
and  she  did  not  pay  for  the  peanuts  on  leaving  the  store — probable
cause existed to believe that the peanuts were stolen property. In fact,
in  response  to  the  question  on  Resendez’s  malicious  prosecution
claim,  the  jury  found  that  Salinas  had  probable  cause  to  commence
criminal  proceedings  against  Resendez.  If  Salinas  had  probable
cause to initiate criminal proceedings, his belief that Resendez stole
the peanuts was necessarily reasonable. See Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.
Odem,  929  S.W.2d  513,  520  (Tex.  App. — San  Antonio  996,  writ
denied) (ﬁnding that reasonable belief for an investigative detention is
something less than that required to establish probable cause). As a
matter of law, the undisputed facts of this case establish that Salinas
had  the  authority  of  law  to  detain  Resendez  and  therefore  she  was
not falsely imprisoned.

The  court  of  appeals’  discussion  of  the  proper  scope  of  the
authority  of  law  to  detain  fails  to  recognize  the  full  extent  of  the
privilege granted to persons who suspect shoplifting. First, the court
of  appeals  reasoned  that  the  jury  implicitly  found  that  Wal-Mart
exceeded  the  scope  of  its  privilege  to  detain  Resendez.  To  support
this theory, the court of appeals cited one of its own opinions for the

principle that compliance with a store’s internal policies is informative
in the jury’s determination of whether there was a detention without
authority  of  law.  We  disagree  that  the  internal  policies  of  a  private
business  deﬁne  the  permissible  scope  of  a  detention  authorized
under the law.

Second,  the  court  of  appeals  erred  in  its  interpretation  of  the
shopkeeper’s privilege. The privilege does not require the detainer to
conﬁrm  or  refute  the  detainee’s  claims,  nor  does  it  prevent  the
detainer from holding the suspected shoplifter for a reasonable time
in order to deliver her to the police. See  Tex.  Civ.  Prac.  &  Rem.  Code
Ann. §124.001; see also Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. §18.16 (granting
to any person the privilege to seize and detain a person suspected of
theft and deliver them to a peace ofﬁcer).

Therefore, the court grants Wal-Mart’s application for writ of error
and,  without  hearing  oral  argument,  reverses  the  court  of  appeals’
judgment and renders judgment for Wal-Mart.

Texas Pattern Jury Charge 6.3: Instruction on Defense of
Privilege to Investigate Theft

When a person reasonably believes that another has stolen
or  is  attempting  to  steal  property,  that  person  has  legal
justiﬁcation to detain the other in a reasonable manner and for
a reasonable time to investigate ownership of the property.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Privileges.  In most cases involving the detention of a customer
by a security guard, the basic elements of a willful detention without

consent  are  undisputed.  In  such  instances,  whether  the  plaintiff  or
defendant will prevail will turn on the primary issue of whether there
was  legal  justiﬁcation  for  the  detention.  Such  afﬁrmative  defenses
typically  switch  the  burden  of  proof  from  the  plaintiff  to  the
defendant. How does the privilege asserted in this case compare with
the privilege in Whirl (at the time of the initial incarceration)?

2. Good Faith.  What does the phrase “reasonable belief” mean as
a basis for the shopkeeper’s privilege? Did the Sheriff’s good faith act
as  a  shield  or  defense  in  the  prior  case?  What’s  the  difference
between these two cases?

3. Reasonableness.  The shopkeeper’s privilege is dependent upon
three  different  things  being  found  reasonable  by  the  trier  of  fact.
Reasonableness is the essential test for a negligence cause of action.
In  the  prior  case  involving  the  prisoner,  was  negligence  of  the
defendant  considered  relevant  to  the  claim?  Why  is  negligence,  or
reasonableness,  relevant  when  a  false  imprisonment  claim  is  being
defended with the shopkeeper’s privilege?

4. Evidence.  What facts supported the court’s conclusion that the
defendant  in  Wal-Mart  had  a  reasonable  belief  that  the  plaintiff  was
stealing peanuts?
5. Problems.
A.  Ordinary  Citizens.   Despite  the  phrase  “shopkeeper’s  privilege,”
does either the Pattern Jury Charge set forth above or the Texas
statute referred to at the end of the opinion limit the privilege to
shopkeepers?  What  if  you  were  shopping  at  a  Wal-Mart  and
to  steal  some
witnessed  another  customer  attempting
merchandise  and  walk  out  the  door?  What  rights,  if  any,  would
you  have  to  detain  that  other  customer?  How  should  the
privilege apply here, if at all?

B.  Reasonable  Manner.   The  shopkeeper’s  privilege  is  limited  to
instances  where  the  method  of  detention  used  is  considered
reasonable.  What  would  you  say  about  a  security  guard  who

broke a suspect’s leg while tackling the suspect as the suspect
tried to run out of the store with a stereo? See Watkins v. Sears
Roebuck & Co., 735 N.Y.S.2d 75 (App. Div. 2001).

6. Citizen’s Arrest.  Many states, either as a matter of common law
or  by  statutory  modiﬁcation  to  the  common  law,  recognize  a
justiﬁcation or privilege for ordinary citizens to detain those who have,
in  the  presence  of  the  citizen,  committed  either  a  felony  criminal
offense  or  a  misdemeanor  involving  a  “breach  of  the  peace”  (e.g.,
ﬁghting or even driving while intoxicated).

Upon Further Review

Though classiﬁed as an intentional tort, the only thing that must
be intended by the defendant in a false imprisonment case is the
detention  of  the  plaintiff.  And  detention  does  not  require  prison
bars — simply  using  force  or  threats  to  keep  someone  from
being able to move from place to place as they wish sufﬁces. On
the other hand, merely inconveniencing someone’s movement is
not sufﬁcient to count as detention. Beyond these two issues of
intent and actual detention, many false imprisonment cases turn
on  whether  or  not  the  defendant  has  pled  and  proven  either
consent  or  a  legal  justiﬁcation.  Be  aware  that  justiﬁcations  are
not  all  the  same.  Note  that  the  ofﬁcer’s  good  faith  was
insufﬁcient to create a privilege in Whirl, whereas with respect to
the  shopkeeper’s  privilege,  a  good  faith  belief  by  the  defendant

that the plaintiff has attempted to steal property is imperative for
the application of the justiﬁcation defense.

THOMAS v. HARRAH’S VICKSBURG CORP.
734 So. 2d 312 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999)

     , J.

Appellants, C.N. Thomas and Surplus City, U.S.A. sought damages
for  common  law  trespass  against  appellees,  Harrah’s  Vicksburg
Corporation and W.G. Yates and Sons Construction Co.

This  litigation  stems  from  the  development  of  Harrah’s  gambling
facility  in  Vicksburg,  Mississippi,  beginning  over  ﬁve  years  ago  and
acts of trespass admittedly committed by Harrah’s and Yates for an
approximate six-month period beginning in July 1993 and continuing
through  December  1993.  The  property  in  question  is  a  vacant
lot . . . wholly owned by Thomas [and leased to Surplus]. Thomas and
Surplus  repeatedly  asked  Harrah’s  and  Yates  to  refrain  from
trespassing  on  the  Thomas/Surplus  property;  however,  these
requests were ignored by Harrah’s and Yates. After realizing that his
attempts  to  protect  his  property  from  trespass  clearly  were  futile,
Thomas instituted this litigation.

Thomas and Surplus contend that the intent of the common law
trespasser  is  irrelevant.  They  cite  Kelley  v.  Sportsmen’s  Speedway,
80 So. 2d 785, 791 (1955) as support for their contention. Kelley was
a  premises  liability  case  and  deﬁned  “trespasser”  as  “a  person  who
enters  the  premises  of  another  without  license,  invitation,  or  other
right,  and  intrudes  for  some  deﬁnite  purpose  of  his  own,  or  at  his
convenience,  or  merely  as  an  idler  with  no  apparent  purpose,  other
than,  perhaps,  to  satisfy  his  curiosity.”  Harrah’s  and  Yates  present
Berry  v.  Player,  542  So.  2d  895  (Miss.  1989)  in  support  of  their
position  that  negligence  is  the  proper  standard  to  apply.  Berry  dealt
with  a  jury  instruction  under  Miss.  Code  Ann.  §95-5-3  concerning
recoverable damages for cutting timber from private property. In that
case  the  Mississippi  Supreme  Court  found  a  negligence  instruction
proper.

We think it instructive to briefly look at the historical basis for the
trespass  to  land  action.  Professors  Prosser  and  Keeton  note  that
“historically, the requirements for trespass to land under the common
law action of trespass were an invasion (a) which interfered with the
right of exclusive possession of the land, and (b) which was the direct

result  of  some  act  committed  by  the  defendant.”  W.  Page  Keeton  et
al., Prosser and Keeton on Torts, §13 at 67 (5th ed. 1984). Further, the
tort  of  trespass  to  land  can  be  committed  by  other  than  simply
entering  on  the  land;  trespass  occurs  by  placing  objects  on  the
property,  by  causing  a  third  party  to  go  onto  the  property,  or  by
remaining on property after the expiration of a right of entry. Keeton
§13 at 72-73.

With  regard  to  the  requisite  intent  for  trespass  to  land,  the
Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts  §163  comment  (b)  addresses  this
issue:

b. Intention. If the actor intends to be upon the particular piece of land, it is not
necessary  that  he  intend  to  invade  the  other’s  interest  in  the  exclusive
possession of his land. The intention which is required to make the actor liable
under the rule stated in this Section is an intention to enter upon the particular
piece  of  land  in  question,  irrespective  of  whether  the  actor  knows  or  should
know that he is not entitled to enter. It is, therefore, immaterial whether or not
he honestly and reasonably believes that the land is his own, or that he has the
consent of the possessor or of a third person having power to give consent on
his behalf, or that he has a mistaken belief that he has some other privilege to
enter. (Emphasis added.)

“The great end for which men
entered into society was to
secure their property. That right
is preserved sacred and
incommunicable in all instances
where it has not been taken
away or abridged by some
public law for the good of the
whole.”

Lord Camden (1765)

Thus,  as  Professors  Prosser
and  Keeton  point  out,
“the
intent  required  as  a  basis  for
is
liability  as  a
simply  an  intent  to  be  at  the
place  on  the  land  where  the
trespass occurred.” Keeton §13
at 73.

Two key witnesses, Charles Wells, Harrah’s construction manager
for  this  project,  and  Jim  Smith,  the  construction  superintendent  for
Yates, admitted that there were trespasses that occurred on Thomas’
property. First, Wells testiﬁed that he worked on the project from July
1993  until  July  1994,  and  that  he  understood  that  there  was  a
continuing  dispute  with  Thomas  over  the  property  lines.  Further,
Wells admitted that he, as well as Yates, were involved in the decision
to  move  the  north  wall  because  it  encroached  on  Thomas’  property.
The plans for the facility, according to Wells, called for the building to
extend  “right  up  to  the  property  line.  .  .  .”  Questioning  by  appellants’
counsel also established that the trespass was inevitable:

By  Mr.  Lotterhos  [counsel  for  appellants]:   Now,  as  a  practical
matter, if you were going to construct that [building] absolutely on
the  property  line,  it  would  have  been  necessary  to  get  on  the
adjacent property to work on the exterior. Isn’t that true?

By Mr. Wells:  On that ten-foot face, yes, sir.
By Mr. Lotterhos:  Alright and that happened, didn’t it?
By Mr. Wells:  Yes, sir.

for

Wells  later  testiﬁed  that  Harrah’s  Vice-President  of  Design  and
Construction, Pat Monson, approved of moving the encroaching wall.
Second, Jim Smith, the construction superintendent for Yates on
Harrah’s  Vicksburg  project,  testiﬁed  for  the  appellees.  On  direct
examination, Smith took great pains to detail how careful Yates was
in  constructing  special  scaffolding  to  avoid  trespassing  on  the
Thomas/Surplus  property  and  emphasized  the  fact  that  he  had
personally  ﬁred
trespassing.
three  employees  of  Yates
Additionally,  Smith,  in  a  strained  and  futile  effort,  attempted  to
disassociate  Yates  from  the  various  subcontractors  employed  by
Yates, while admitting that Yates had control over the subcontractors.
Yet, on cross-examination, Smith admitted that scaffolding erected by
Yates in conjunction with the construction of the facility was indeed
on  the  Thomas/Surplus  property  and  that  they  received  permission
from  Thomas  to  enter  the  property  for  the  specific  purpose  of
removing the scaffolding to halt the trespass. Further, Smith admitted
to repeated airspace violations on the Thomas/Surplus property with
the  boom  swinging  over  the  property.  As  did  Wells,  Smith  also
admitted  that  the  trespass  on  the  Thomas/Surplus  property  was
unavoidable after the construction reached a certain point and when
the wall was ultimately moved:

By  Mr.  Lotterhos:   And  you  were  aware  that  .  .  .  it  was  to  be — a
portion of that north wall was to be right on the Thomas property
line, isn’t that true?
By Mr. Smith:  Yes, sir.
By Mr. Lotterhos:  Now, you have been involved in construction a lot

of years, haven’t you?

By Mr. Smith:  Yes, sir.

* * *

By Mr. Lotterhos:  . . . based on your experience, when you build right
upon the line or wall, it is necessary to get on the outside of the
wall to work on it, isn’t that true?

By Mr. Smith:  Yes, sir, it is.

* * *

By Mr. Lotterhos:  In order to break out that wall, you had to get on

Mr. Thomas’ property, didn’t you?

By Mr. Smith:  Yes, sir, we did.

This  uncontroverted  testimony  established  that  there  were

trespasses on the Thomas/Surplus property.

In  this  case,  the  testimony  of  Charles  Wells  and  Jim  Smith
established  that  the  construction  of  the  Harrah’s  facility  was  on  a
fast-tract,  and  it  was  known  that  the  north  wall  of  the  shoreside
facility would be very close to the Thomas/Surplus property line and
that trespass was unavoidable in the construction process. Appellees
go  to  great  lengths  to  describe  the  precautions  made  by  the
construction  personnel  to  avoid  the  trespasses.  But  this  is  quite
simply  irrelevant.  A  picture,  or  in  this  case,  pictures,  are  worth
thousands  of  words.  It  was  obvious  that  deliveries  were  made,
building  supplies  were  stacked,  and  scaffolding  was  erected  for
construction purposes on the Thomas/Surplus property. As indicated
by  the  photographs  and  the  testimony  of  Wells,  the  trespass  on  the
Thomas/Surplus  property  was
inevitable.  Undoubtedly,  trespass
occurred  at  the  hands  of  Harrah’s  and  Yates  during  the  course  of
completing this project. While some of the photographs were unable
to  be  directly  tied  to  the  appellees,  a  quantum  more  proved  that  the
trespasses complained of occurred on the subject property for which
Harrah’s  was  responsible.  Appellees’  arguments  to  the  contrary  are
spurious and not well taken.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Intent.   The  court  describes  the  varying  arguments  of  the
plaintiffs  and  defendants  in  Thomas,  with  the  plaintiff  essentially
arguing that no intention need be established in a trespass case and
the  defendant  arguing  that  a  negligence  standard  must  apply — that
the defendant must have failed to exercise reasonable care in coming
onto the owner’s land in order to be liable. Where does the court come
down as between these two extreme arguments?

2.  Good  Faith  Not  a  Defense.   Courts  and  the  Restatement  have
clearly  stated  that  so  long  as  the  minimal  intent  necessary  for
trespass exists, the good faith motivations or beliefs of the defendant
are  not  a  defense.  The  Restatement  offers  an  extreme,  though  well
accepted, example:

If the actor is and intends to be upon the particular piece of land in
question, it is immaterial that he honestly and reasonably believes
that  he  has  the  consent  of  the  lawful  possessor  to  enter,  or
indeed,  that  he  himself  is  the  possessor.  Unless  the  actor’s
mistake  was  induced  by  the  conduct  of  the  possessor,  it  is
immaterial  that  the  mistake
is  one  such  as  a  reasonable
man . . . would have made. One who enters any piece of land takes
the risk. . . . So, too, the actor cannot escape liability by showing
that  his  mistaken  belief  in  the  validity  of  his  title  is  due  to  the
advice  of  the  most  eminent  of  counsel.  Indeed,  even  though  a
statute expressly confers title upon him, he takes the risk that the
statute may thereafter be declared unconstitutional.

Restatement (Second) of Torts §163, cmt. b (1965).

3.  Acts  Constituting  Trespass.   The  Thomas  court  alludes  to
various  types  of  contact  with  another’s  land  that  can  constitute  a
trespass,  and  concludes  that  the  defendants’  actions  constituted

trespass  against  the  plaintiffs.  In  what  speciﬁc  ways  did  the
defendants commit a trespass?

4. Liability for Damages.  One may maintain an action for nominal
damages  for  trespass  or,  where  actual  harm  is  demonstrated,  for
compensatory damages. In Thomas the court rejected any award of
damages  for  Thomas,  however,  because  it  had  leased  the  land  in
question to Surplus and was not in possession of the land. So long as
no  permanent  harm  had  occurred  to  the  land  (beyond  the  terms  of
the  lease),  Thomas  as  the  owner/lessor  could  not  recover.  However,
its  lessee,  who  was  in  possession,  could  maintain  an  action  for  its
actual damages.

5. Problems.  Which of the following actors are trespassers?
A. One who decides to do his neighbor (who is away on vacation) a

favor by mowing his neighbor’s yard?

B.  A  child  who  sees  a  basketball  goal  on  another’s  driveway  and
decides to enter the property to shoot hoops for a few minutes
while waiting for a school bus?

C. A drunk driver who hits a patch of ice and slides onto another’s

front yard?

D.  A  blind  man  who  walks  across  another’s  property  line  without

realizing that he has done so?

E. One who changes the natural drainage on their property in order
to  cause  standing  water  to  flow  into  their  neighbor’s  yard
instead?

6. Airspace Trespass.  A landowner has generally been understood
to own the airspace of her own land up to the sky (as well as below
the  ground).  Since  the
flight,  this
understanding has been altered to permit aircraft to fly over property
without becoming liable to all whose property is below. With regard to
intangible airspace violations, such as causing smoke or pollutants to
enter over another’s property, courts have come up with varying tests
for  determining  liability.  A  common  approach  involves  creating

invention  of  modern  air

trespass liability only when actual harm is caused to the landowner’s
property. See, e.g., Public Service Co. of Colorado v. Van Wyk, 27 P.3d
377  (Colo.  2001)  (defendant  not  subject  to  trespass  liability  for
causing  radiation  and  electromagnetic  ﬁelds  to  cross  plaintiff’s
property without evidence of actual harm).

“LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY . . .”

Idaho Civil Jury Instruction 3.19.1 — Trespasser, Definition

A  trespasser  is  a  person  who  goes  or  remains  upon  the
premises  of  another  without  permission,  invitation  or  lawful
authority. Permission or invitation may be express or implied.

2. Scope of Liability

BAKER v. SHYMKIV
451 N.E.2d 811 (Ohio 1983)

The parties, on appeal, agreed to the following statement of facts:
1.  On  March  22,  1978,  at  8:00  p.m.  [Mr.  Baker]  and  his  wife  were

returning home and turned into the driveway leading to their home.

2. They observed a car was parked in the driveway blocking their
access, and they observed Mr. and Mrs. Shymkiv throwing tools and
other equipment in the trunk of their car, close the trunk lid and jump
into their car.

3.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Baker  got  out  of  their  car  and  observed  a  trench
with  dimensions  of  approximately  1  foot  in  width  and  1  1/2  feet  in
depth  and  more  than  10  feet  in  length  had  been  dug  across  their
driveway  and  that  a  drain  tile  had  been  placed  in  the  trench  so  that

water from the Shymkiv property could drain through the trench and
onto the property of an adjoining landowner.

4.  Mr.  Baker  was  angry  and  visibly  upset  over  the  actions  of  the

Shymkivs and approached the Shymkiv automobile.

5. Mr. Shymkiv got out of the car and an argument concerning the
trench  followed.  Mary  Baker  interceded  and  pushed  herself  between
Homer Baker and John Shymkiv and told her husband to calm down.
6. Mary Baker indicated that she had never seen her husband so

upset or angry in all the years they had been married.
7. Mrs. Baker then left the scene to call the police.
8.  When  Mrs.  Baker  returned  approximately  3  minutes  later  she
found  her  husband  laying  face-down  in  the  mud  puddle  while  the
Shymkivs were driving away.

9.  Emergency  squad  arrived  approximately  10-15  minutes  later,
worked on Homer Baker and transported him to Grant Hospital where
he was pronounced dead at 9:20 p.m.

10.  Mary  Baker  has  described  her  husband  as  a  very  easygoing

person, very friendly, and not easily prone to argue or get upset.

11. Mary Baker has indicated that Homer Baker took great pride in

the maintenance and upkeep of the driveway, home and yard.

In  the  court  of  common  pleas,  Mrs.  Baker  ﬁled  several  claims
against the Shymkivs: (1) as administratrix, for the wrongful death of
Mr.  Baker,  and  for  her  own  pecuniary  loss;  and  (2)  for  trespass
seeking  both  compensatory  and  punitive  damages.  At  trial,  two
medical experts testiﬁed. One concluded that the events of March 22,
1978, could have caused Mr. Baker’s death. The other determined that
there was no evidence upon which one could reach that conclusion.

The trial court instructed the jury, in part:

Now,  the  test  then  [of  proximate  cause]  is  whether  in  the  light  of  all  the
circumstances a reasonably prudent person would have anticipated that injury
was  likely  to  result  to  someone  from  the  preponderance  of  the  evidence  or
performance of the evidence or act. In other words, before liability attaches to

the  defendants  in  this  case,  the  damages  claimed  by  Mrs.  Baker  must  have
been  foreseen  or  reasonably  anticipated  by  the  wrongdoer  as  likely  to  follow
the  trespass  and  the  digging  of  the  trench  or  the  digging  of  the  hole  or
whatever. (Emphasis added.)

The  jury  found  against  the  Shymkivs  on  the  trespass  claim,  but
assessed  [only]  $300  in  compensatory  damages  and  $1,100  in
punitive  damages  against  Mr.  Shymkiv  only.  [The  court  of  appeals
reversed  the  jury’s  award,  ruling  that  the  trial  court’s  instruction  that
only foreseeable damages could be awarded was erroneous and may
have resulted in the jury’s award being too low.]

      , J.

This  case  presents  one  issue:  whether  the  trial  court  erred  by
instructing  the  jury  that  only  foreseeable  damages  could  result  in
liability. Appellants, the Shymkivs, contend that the trial court properly
charged the jury on foreseeability. We disagree.

Intentional  trespassers  are  within  that  class  of  less-favored
wrongdoers.  For  example,  under  the  Restatement  of  Torts  2d,
intentional  conduct  is  an  element  of  trespass:  “One  is  subject  to
liability  to  another  for  trespass,  irrespective  of  whether  he  thereby
causes  harm  to  any  legally  protected  interest  of  the  other,  if  he
intentionally  enters  land  in  the  possession  of  the  other  or  causes  a
thing  or  a  third  person  to  do  so.”  (Emphasis  added.)  Restatement  of
Torts 2d §158. The Restatement also articulates the scope of liability
for  a  trespass  in  Section  162,  which  states:  “A  trespass  on  land
subjects the trespasser to liability for physical harm to the possessor
of the land at the time of the trespass, or to the land or to his things,
or to members of his household or to their things, caused by any act
done,  activity  carried  on,  or  condition  created  by  the  trespasser,
irrespective of whether his conduct is such as would subject him to
liability were he not a trespasser.” Id., at pages 291-292. Comment f to
Section  162  of  the  Restatement  explains  the  intended  effect  of  that
provision:

f.  Peculiar  position  of  trespasser.  This  Section  states  the  peculiar  liability  to
which a trespasser is subject for bodily harm caused to the possessor of land
or  the  members  of  his  family  by  the  conduct  of  a  trespasser  while  upon  the
land, irrespective of whether his conduct if it occurred elsewhere would subject
him  to  liability  to  them.  Thus,  one  who  trespasses  upon  the  land  of  another
incurs the risk of becoming liable for any bodily harm which is cause [sic] to the
possessor  of  the  land  or  to  members  of  his  household  by  any  conduct  of  the
trespasser  during  the  continuance  of  his  trespass,  no  matter  how  otherwise
innocent such conduct may be.

Id., at page 293.

Accordingly,  we  hold  that  damages  caused  by  an  intentional

trespasser need not be foreseeable to be compensable.
We afﬁrm the judgment of the court of appeals.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Foreseeability  as  Damage  Limitation.   As  mentioned  previously,
foreseeability  is  a  traditional  limitation  on  recovery  in  a  claim  for
negligence. We will discuss this test for proximate cause in Chapter 5.
Courts historically reject any such requirement for proximate cause in
an  intentional  tort  cause  of  action,  such  as  in  the  Baker  case.  As
Justice Marshall once opined:

Although  many  legal  battles  have  been  fought  over  the  extent  of
tort liability for remote consequences of negligent conduct, it has
always  been  assumed  that  the  victim  of  an  intentional  tort  can
recover from the tortfeasor if he proves that the tortious conduct
was a cause-in-fact of his injuries. An inquiry into proximate cause
has  traditionally  been  deemed  unnecessary  in  suits  against
intentional tortfeasors.

Associated Gen. Contractors v. California State Council of Carpenters,
459  U.S.  519,  547-548  (1983)(dissenting).  So  long  as  the  harm

caused  is  considered  compensable  for  the  particular  intentional  tort
and  actual  causation  is  established,  the  scope  of  liability  typically  is
not  limited  by  notions  of  foreseeability.  We  saw  this  same  principle
applied in the Nelson v. Carroll case involving the battery by the debt
collector. However, as the Restatement provision quoted by the court
indicates, traditionally the law of trespass has limited liability to those
damages caused “during the continuance” of the trespass.

2. Problems.
A. Would it make a difference if Mr. Baker had died of a heart attack
the  next  morning  upon  discovering  that  his  neighbors  had
trespassed  upon  his  land  the  night  before?  Think  about  what
constitutes a trespass and the Restatement’s reference to being
liable  for  all  damages  caused  “during  the  continuance”  of  a
trespass.

B.  If  a  neighbor  trespasses  on  another’s  property,  causing  no
actual harm at the time, but the owner sees the trespass occur
while  watching  surveillance  videotape  later  and  suffers  a  heart
attack, will trespass support recovery for the owner’s death?
C. While a landowner is in the hospital having his hernia repaired, a
kindly  next-door  neighbor  comes  upon  his  property  to  surprise
him by mowing the lawn. The next morning when the landowner
returns home he is incensed to discover what his neighbor has
done.  That  afternoon  the  two  have  a  confrontation — each
standing upon their own property — which involves much yelling
and  waving  of  arms.  The  landowner  falls  dead  from  a  heart
attack in the heat of the debate.

C. Personal Property

In  addition  to  recognizing  trespass  for  encroaching  upon  another’s
land,  the  common  law  has  long  recognized  the  related  cause  of
action for intentional touching of another’s personal property without

permission — trespass  to  chattels.  As  the  Koepnick  case  discusses
below,  a  trespass  to  chattels  can  take  the  form  of  either  a
dispossession  or  an  intermeddling.  Either  variety  can  permit  the
recovery of compensatory damages when the trespass causes actual
demonstrable  harm  to  either  the  personal  property  or  to  the  owner.
As  you  read  the  following  opinion,  therefore,  try  to  discern  when  the
distinction  between  the  two  varieties  of  trespass  to  chattel  claims
makes  a  difference.  Following  that,  we  will  next  encounter  a  related
cause  of  action  to  trespass  to  chattels — a  claim  for  conversion.  In
the Pearson v. Dodd case we will see the court outline the parameters
of this related cause of action involving a greater imposition on one’s
property interests.

1. Trespass to Chattels

KOEPNICK v. SEARS ROEBUCK & CO.
762 P.2d 609 (Ct. App. Az. 1988)

Koepnick  was  stopped  in  the  Fiesta  Mall  parking  lot  by  Sears
security  guards  Lessard  and  Pollack  on  December  6,  1982,  at
approximately 6:15 p.m. Lessard and Pollack suspected Koepnick of
shoplifting a wrench and therefore detained him for approximately 15
minutes  until  the  Mesa  police  arrived.  Upon  arrival  of  the  police,
Koepnick  and  a  police  ofﬁcer  became  involved  in  an  altercation  in
which Koepnick was injured. The police ofﬁcer handcuffed Koepnick,
placed  a  call  for  a  backup,  and  began  investigating  the  shoplifting
allegations.  Upon  investigation  it  was  discovered  that  Koepnick  had
receipts  for  the  wrench  and  for  all  the  Sears  merchandise  he  had
been  carrying.  Additionally,  the  store  clerk  who  sold  the  wrench  to
Koepnick was located. He veriﬁed the sale and informed Lessard that
he had put the wrench in a small bag, stapled it shut, and then placed

that bag into a large bag containing Koepnick’s other purchases. The
small bag was not among the items in Koepnick’s possession in the
security room. To determine whether a second wrench was involved,
the  police  and  Lessard  searched  Koepnick’s  truck  which  was  in  the
mall parking lot. No stolen items were found. Having completed their
investigation,  the  police  cited  Koepnick  for  disorderly  conduct  and
released him. The entire detention lasted approximately 45 minutes.

Koepnick sued Sears for false [imprisonment], assault, trespass to
chattel, invasion of privacy and malicious prosecution. The trial court
directed  a  verdict  in  favor  of  Sears  on  all  charges  except  false
[imprisonment] and trespass to chattel. After a trial on these claims, a
jury  awarded  Koepnick  $25,000  compensatory  damages  and
$500,000  punitive  damages  for  false  [imprisonment],  and  $100
compensatory damages and $25,000 punitive damages for trespass
to chattel.

[The  trial  court  granted  a  new  trial  on  the  false  imprisonment
claim  because  of  the  facts  indicating  Sears’  privilege  to  detain  the
plaintiff  under  the  shopkeeper’s  privilege.  The  court  of  appeals
afﬁrmed  the  grant  of  a  new  trial  on  that  claim.  The  trial  court  also
granted  a  judgment  notwithstanding  the  verdict  to  Sears  on  the
trespass to chattels claim.]

Arizona  courts  follow  the  Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts  absent
authority  to  the  contrary.  The  Restatement  provides  that  the  tort  of
intentionally

chattel in the possession of another. Restatement (Second) of Torts
§217 (1965).

to  a  chattel  may  be  committed  by

The  Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts  §221

(1965)  deﬁnes

dispossession as follows:

A  dispossession  may  be  committed  by  intentionally  taking  a  chattel  from  the
possession  of  another  without  the  other’s  consent  or  .  .  .  barring  the
possessor’s access to a chattel . . . .

Comment  b  to  §221  provides  that  dispossession  may  occur  when
someone intentionally assumes physical control over the chattel and
deals  with  the  chattel  in  a  way  which  will  be  destructive  of  the
possessory interest of the other person. Comment b further provides
that  “on  the  other  hand,  an  intermeddling  with  the  chattel  is  not  a
dispossession  unless  the  actor  intends  to  exercise  a  dominion  and
control  over  it  inconsistent  with  a  possession  in  any  other  person
other than himself.”

The Restatement (Second) of Torts §218 (1965) provides:

One who commits a trespass to a chattel is subject to liability

to the possessor of the chattel if, but only if,

(a) he dispossesses the other of the chattel, or
(b)  the  chattel  is  impaired  as  to  its  condition,  quality,  or

value, or

(c) the possessor is deprived of the use of the chattel for a

substantial time, or

(d)  bodily  harm  is  caused  to  the  possessor,  or  harm  is
caused to some person or thing in which the possessor has a
legally protected interest.

Koepnick  argued  at  trial  that  Lessard’s  participation  in  searching
his  truck  constituted  an  actionable  trespass  to  the  truck.  He  was
awarded  $100  damages  by  the  jury  which  he  characterizes  as
damages  for  a  dispossession  pursuant  to  subsection  (a)  or
deprivation of use pursuant to subsection (c) of §218.

The  Restatement  recognizes  that  an  award  of  nominal  damages
may  be  made,  even  in  the  absence  of  proof  of  actual  damages,  if  a
trespass to chattel involves a dispossession. See §218, comment d.
However,  both  parties  have  agreed  that  the  $100  compensatory
award is not nominal.

Sears’  actions  with  respect  to  the  trespass  consisted  of  Steve
Lessard  accompanying  a  Mesa  police  ofﬁcer  out  to  the  parking  lot
and  looking  in  the  truck.  There  is  no  evidence  in  the  record  of  an

intent on the part of Sears’ employee to claim a possessory interest in
the truck contrary to Koepnick’s interest. No lien or ownership interest
claim of any kind was made. Further, there is no evidence that Sears
intentionally denied Koepnick access to his truck.

Koepnick  was  in  the  City  of  Mesa’s  custody  at  the  time  of  the
search  and  Sears  had  no  control  over  how  the  police  department
conducted its investigation or the disposition of Koepnick during that
investigation. There is no evidence that Sears’ employees objected to
any request by Koepnick to accompany them down to the vehicle.

Comment  e  to  the  Restatement  §218  discusses  the  requirement
of proof of actual damage for an actionable trespass to chattel claim.

The  interest  of  a  possessor  of  chattel  in  its  inviolability,  unlike  the  similar
interest  of  a  possessor  of  land,  is  not  given  legal  protection  by  an  action  for
nominal damages for harmless intermeddlings with the chattel. In order that an
actor  who  interferes  with  another’s  chattel  may  be  liable,  his  conduct  must
affect some other and more important interest of the possessor. Therefore, one
who intentionally intermeddles with another’s chattel is subject to liability only if
his  intermeddling  is  harmful  to  the  possessor’s  materially  valuable  interest  in
the  physical  condition,  quality,  or  value  of  the  chattel,  or  if  the  possessor  is
deprived of the use of the chattel for a substantial time, or some other legally
protected interest of the possessor is affected as stated in Clause (c). Sufﬁcient
legal protection of the possessor’s interest in the mere inviolability of his chattel
is  afforded  by  his  privilege  to  use  reasonable  force  to  protect  his  possession
against even harmless interference.

The  search  in  question  took  approximately  two  minutes.  Neither
the truck nor its contents were damaged in any manner by the police
or  Sears’  employee.  As  a  matter  of  law,  Sears’  action  did  not
constitute an actionable trespass under §218(c).

In arguing that Sears should not have been given a [judgment] in
its  favor  on  the  trespass  to  chattel  claim,  Koepnick  asserts  that  the
search  of  his  truck  caused  him  to  remain  in  custody  longer  than  he
would  otherwise  have  been  detained.  While  this  may  be  true,  there
was no evidence showing any connection between $100 and the few

minutes  that  Koepnick  was  detained  as  a  result  of  waiting  for  that
search to be completed — apparently 15 minutes. For a deprivation of
use  caused  by  a  trespass  to  chattel  to  be  actionable,  the  time  must
be  so  substantial  that  it  is  possible  to  estimate  the  loss  that  is
caused. The record in the present case lacks any evidence to permit a
jury  to  estimate  any  loss  caused  to  Koepnick.  It  is  well  settled  that
conjecture and speculation cannot provide the basis for an award of
damages.  The  evidence  must  make  an  approximately  accurate
estimate possible.

Even if a [judgment] on the claim of trespass could be afﬁrmed on
the  basis  that  a  dispossession  occurred,  the  award  .  .  .  would
necessarily be limited to nominal damages. As discussed above, both
parties  agree  that  the  $100  award  was  not  nominal.  Furthermore,
punitive  damages  were  erroneously  awarded  because  punitive
damages cannot be awarded absent evidence of actual damages.

We  conclude  that  there  was  no  dispossession  of  the  vehicle  as
contemplated  under  §218  of  the  Restatement  nor  was  Koepnick
deprived of its use for a substantial period of time. Any increase in the
length  of  detention  caused  by  the  search  is  not  the  kind  of  interest
protected by the tort of trespass to chattel. Accordingly, we afﬁrm the
trial court’s [judgment] in favor of Sears on this issue.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Determining  Intermeddling  vs.  Dispossession.   The  court  in
Sears  describes  two  branches,  or  types,  of  trespass  to  chattels
claims:  an  intermeddling  and  a  dispossession.  Referencing  a  test
involving  whether  the  defendant  intends  an  act  of  interference  with
the  chattel  in  a  way  that  is  inconsistent  with  the  plaintiff’s  true
ownership,  the  court  concludes  that  the  defendant’s  conduct
amounted to an intermeddling. What facts support that? What might

defendant  have  done  differently  with  plaintiff’s  truck  to  change  the
court’s conclusion?

3. Problems.  Billy and Sara are ﬁrst-year law students. Sara owns
a  Chevrolet  Camaro.  In  each  of  the  following  circumstances,  does
Sara  have  a  valid  claim  for  trespass  to  chattels?  How  would  you
characterize  the  type  of  trespass  claim — an  intermeddling  or  a
dispossession? Will that distinction matter?

A. After class one afternoon, Billy is talking with some other 1L law
students  in  the  parking  lot  when  he  rests  by  leaning  against
Sara’s Camaro.

B.  During  a  break  in  his  ﬁrst-year  classes,  Billy  decides  he  should
polish  his  golf  game  in  anticipation  of  being  a  rich  lawyer.  He
begins hitting golf balls in a grassy ﬁeld adjacent to the parking
lot. He carelessly hits an errant shot that breaks the windshield
of Sara’s Camaro.

C.  Billy  gets  sick  to  his  stomach  after  being  called  upon  to  recite
the  facts  of  Pennoyer  v.  Neff  in  Civil  Procedure  class  and
decides he needs to go home early. Because his car was in the
shop  undergoing  repairs,  he  ﬁnds  Sara’s  Camaro  unlocked  and
hot  wires  it  and  drives  it  home.  After  resting  for  two  hours,  he
returns  it  to  the  parking  lot  unscathed.  Sara  was  in  class  the
entire time but learns of the incident from another law student.
D. Billy is crazy with rage and jealousy after Sara demonstrates her
superior knowledge of Property law in class one day, correcting
a mistake Billy made in front of the entire class. Vowing revenge,
Billy  sneaks  into  the  parking  lot  a  few  days  later  and  cuts  the
hydraulic  brake  lines  on  Sara’s  Camaro.  When  she  attempts  to

drive it home later that day, the brakes fail and she loses control
over  the  car,  ending  up  in  a  river  suffering  severe  injuries  and
with her Camaro destroyed.

E.  Billy  is  struggling  ﬁnancially  given  the  high  tuition  of  his  law
school. He has no transportation and decides to steal Sara’s car.
Sara  searches  for  her  car  to  no  avail  and  ﬁnally  purchases  a
BMW  to  replace  her  Camaro.  A  month  later  when  Billy  gets  a
student  loan  check  he  decides  to  purchase  another  older
vehicle,  and  he  secretly  returns  Sara’s  Camaro  to  the  school
parking  lot.  Sara  ﬁnds  the  car  and  surveillance  videotape
permits her to identify Billy as the culprit.

2. Conversion

PEARSON v. DODD
410 F.2d 701 (D.C. Cir. 1969)

      , J.

This  case  arises  out  of  the  exposure  of  the  alleged  misdeeds  of
Senator  Thomas  Dodd  of  Connecticut  by  newspaper  columnists
Drew  Pearson  and  Jack  Anderson.  The  District  Court  has  granted
partial summary judgment to [plaintiff] Senator Dodd, ﬁnding liability
on a theory of conversion. We reverse its grant of summary judgment
for  conversion.  The  undisputed  facts  in  the  case  were  stated  by  the
District Court as follows:

In Practice

trespass to chattels and
conversion is the unpermitted

personal property. Whether the
lawyer bringing a claim for such
misconduct labels it as trespass
or conversion may only affect
the typical measure of
damages. In some cases, where
the plainﬁff is seeking repair
damages or where the court
could not utilize a market value
theory of damages, the
distinction between the two
claims is not particularly
important.

not subject to suit for invasion of privacy.

gave

Although  plaintiff’s  complaint  charges  that  defendants  aided  and
abetted  in  the  removal  of  the  documents,  the  undisputed  facts,
narrowed  by  the  District  Judge  with  the  concurrence  of  counsel,
established  only  that  appellants  received  copies  of  the  documents
knowing that they had been removed without authorization.

The  District  Court  ruled  that  defendants’  receipt  and  subsequent
use  of  photocopies  of  documents  which  they  knew  had  been
removed  from  plaintiff’s  ﬁles  without  authorization  established  their
liability  for  conversion.  [For  different  reasons,  we]  conclude  that
defendants are not guilty of conversion on the facts shown.

Dean Prosser has remarked that “conversion is the forgotten tort.”
That  it  is  not  entirely  forgotten  is  attested  by  the  case  before  us.
History  has  largely  deﬁned  its  contours,  contours  which  we  should
now  follow  except  where  they  derive  from  clearly  obsolete  practices

or  abandoned  theories.  Conversion  is  the  substantive  tort  theory
which underlay the ancient common law form of action for trover. A
plaintiff in trover alleged that he had lost a chattel which he rightfully
possessed,  and  that  the  defendant  had  found  it  and  converted  it  to
his own use. With time, the allegations of losing and ﬁnding became
leaving  the  question  of  whether  the  defendant  had
ﬁctional,
“converted” the property the only operative one.

The  most  distinctive  feature  of  conversion  is  its  measure  of
damages,  which  is  the  value  of  the  goods  converted.  The  theory  is
that the converting defendant has in some way treated the goods as
if they were his own, so that the plaintiff can properly ask the court to
decree a forced sale of the property from the rightful possessor to the
converter. Because of this stringent measure of damages, it has long
been  recognized  that  not  every  wrongful  interference  with  the
personal  property  of  another  is  a  conversion.  Where  the  [act  of
interference]  falls  short  of  the  complete  or  very  substantial
deprivation of possessory rights in the property, the tort committed is
not conversion, but the lesser wrong of trespass to chattels.

The  Second  Restatement  of  Torts  [§222A1]  has  marked  the

distinction by deﬁning conversion as:

An intentional exercise of dominion or control over a chattel which so seriously
interferes  with  the  right  of  another  to  control  it  that  the  actor  may  justly  be
required to pay the other the full value of the chattel.

Less  serious  interferences  fall  under  the  Restatement’s  deﬁnition  of
trespass.  The  difference  is  more  than  a  semantic  one.  The  measure
of  damages  in  trespass  is  not  the  whole  value  of  the  property
interfered with, but rather the actual diminution in its value caused by
the  interference.  More  important  for  this  case,  a  judgment  for
conversion  can  be  obtained  with  only  nominal  damages,  whereas
liability  for  trespass  to  chattels  exists
[in  cases  of  a  mere
intermeddling]  only  on  a  showing  of  actual  damage  to  the  property
interfered  with.  Here  the  District  Court  granted  partial  summary

judgment on the issue of liability alone, while conceding that possibly
no  more  than  nominal  damages  might  be  awarded  on  subsequent
trial.

It  is  clear  that  on  the  agreed  facts  defendants  committed  no
conversion  of  the  physical  documents  taken  from  plaintiff’s  ﬁles.
Those documents were removed from the ﬁles at night, photocopied,
and  returned  to  the  ﬁles  undamaged  before  ofﬁce  operations
resumed in the morning. Insofar as the documents’ value to plaintiff
resided  in  their  usefulness  as  records  of  the  business  of  his  ofﬁce,
plaintiff was clearly not substantially deprived of his use of them.

This  of  course  is  not  an  end  of  the  matter.  It  has  long  been
recognized that documents often have value above and beyond that
springing  from  their  physical  possession.  They  may  embody
information  or  ideas  whose  economic  value  depends  in  part  or  in
whole upon being kept secret. The question then arises whether the
information taken by means of copying plaintiff’s ofﬁce ﬁles is of the
type which the law of conversion protects. The general rule has been
that  ideas  or  information  are  not  subject  to  legal  protection,  but  the
law  has  developed  exceptions  to  this  rule.  Where  information  is
gathered and arranged at some cost and sold as a commodity on the
ideas  are

formulated with labor and inventive genius, as in the case of literary
works  [copyright]  or  scientiﬁc  researches  [trade  secrets],  they  are
protected.  Where  they  constitute  instruments  of  fair  and  effective
commercial  competition,  those  who  develop  them  may  gather  their
fruits under the protection of the law.

it

The  question  here  is  not  whether  plaintiff  had  a  right  to  keep  his
ﬁles from prying eyes, but whether the information taken from those
ﬁles falls under the protection of the law of property, enforceable by a
suit for conversion. In our view, it does not. The information included
the contents of letters to plaintiff from supplicants, and ofﬁce records
of other kinds, the nature of which is not fully revealed by the record.
Insofar  as  we  can  tell,  none  of  it  amounts  to  literary  property,  to

scientiﬁc  invention,  or  to  secret  plans  formulated  by  plaintiff  for  the
conduct  of  commerce.  Nor  does  it  appear  to  be  information  held  in
any  way  for  sale  by  plaintiff,  analogous  to  the  fresh  news  copy
produced by a wire service.

Plaintiff complains, not of the misappropriation of property bought
or created by him, but of the exposure of information either injurious
to his reputation or revelatory of matters which he believes he has a
right to keep to himself. Injuries of this type are redressed at law by
suit  for  libel  and  invasion  of  privacy  respectively,  where  defendants’
liability  for  those  torts  can  be  established  under  the  limitations
created  by  common  law  and  by  the  Constitution.  [Plaintiff  did  not
allege  any  libel  and  his  possible  claim  for  invasion  of  privacy  is  not
before this Court on appeal at this time.]

Because no conversion of the physical contents of appellee’s ﬁles
took place, and because the information copied from the documents
in those ﬁles has not been shown to be property subject to protection
by  suit  for  conversion,  the  District  Court’s  ruling  that  appellants  are
[liable for] conversion must be reversed.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Conversion vs. Trespass to Chattels.  As the court above briefly
discusses,  the  related  tort  claims  for  trespass  to  chattels  and
conversion involve different degrees of interference with the property
rights of the owner. Typically trespass to chattels results in liability for
harm  to  the  property,  for  harm  associated  with  the  plaintiff  being
deprived  of  the  property’s  use  for  a  signiﬁcant  period  of  time,  or  for
physical  injury  to  the  owner  if  the  trespass  causes  such  injury.
Conversion typically results in either a total loss of the property to the
owner
(through  destruction  or  being  without  possession
permanently)  or  sometimes  through  the  defendant’s  retaining  the
property for so long that a “forced sale” seems proper. For example, in

Problem E immediately before Dodd, Sara would have little interest in
taking  her  car  back  from  Billy  as  she  had  already  replaced  it  with
another car. In such situations (or where the defendant has destroyed
the  property),  the  appropriate  measure  of  damages  would  be
requiring  the  defendant  to  pay  the  full  fair  market  value  of  the
converted property as of the date of the conversion. On the facts of
Dodd, why did the court rule that no conversion had even occurred?
Would  a  claim  for  trespass  to  chattels  have  fared  any  better?
Consider how the plaintiff was allegedly injured. Are those injuries the
type  contemplated  by  either  tort  claim?  In  another  portion  of  the
court’s opinion, it also questioned whether the plaintiff was even the
owner  of  the  documents,  as  he  was  a  public  servant  and  the
documents  were  associated  with  his  performance  of  his  public
duties.

2. The  Rest  of  the  Story.   After  the  defendants’  publication  of  the
unsavory information contained in the documents borrowed from the
plaintiff’s  ofﬁce,  Senator  Dodd  was  investigated  by  a  bi-partisan
Senate  ethics  committee,  ultimately  resulting  in  a  rare  vote  to
censure  him.  Afterwards,  he  ran  for  re-election  as  an  independent
(having been rejected by his own party) but lost the election. The next
year he died of a heart attack, with some suggesting his ill health had
resulted from the scandal, precipitated by the unauthorized taking of
his ofﬁce documents. Perhaps his family should have ﬁled a wrongful
death case based upon the trespass to chattels?

3. Defendants’  Role.   You  may  be  wondering  why  the  defendants
were even the named tortfeasors since the recited facts indicate that
others  had  actually  taken  the  documents  from  the  plaintiff’s  ofﬁce
and  merely  given  copies  of  them  to  the  defendant  reporters.  There
are two possible rationales. First, the Restatement (Second) of Torts
§229 suggests that “One who receives possession of a chattel from
another with the intent to acquire for himself a proprietary interest in
the chattel which the other has not the power to transfer is subject to
liability  for  conversion  to  [the  actual  owner].”  Second,  as  will  be

discussed  in  Chapter  9  Apportionment,  there  is  a  doctrine  called
Concert of Action that permits a joint liability by those who conspire
to  commit  a  tort.  Because  it  appears  defendants  were  aware  of  the
wrongful taking of the property,  they  could  have  possibly  been  liable
under either theory — assuming a conversion had taken place.

Upon Further Review

Whether  analyzing  a  trespass  to  real  estate  or  trespass  to
chattels  claim,  the  key  is  the  intentional  contact  made  by  the
defendant  with  another’s  property  without
the  owner’s
permission. The permission in either instance may be express or
implied from the circumstances. But even the defendant’s good
faith  belief  that  he  had  permission  (or  consent)  for  the  contact
with the property is not a defense, unless the owner has acted in
a  way  that  would  provide  a  reasonable  manifestation  of  such
consent.  Reflecting  the  judgment  that  real  estate  is  of  greater
import than personal property, while courts will also entertain a
claim  for  at  least  nominal  damages  in  a  trespass  to  land  case,
courts  will  only  permit  a  claim  for  nominal  damages  in  a
trespass  to  chattels  if  it  characterizes  the  trespass  as  a
dispossession  rather  than  a  mere  harmless  intermeddling.  But
regardless  of  label,  where  actual  harm  to  the  property  is
demonstrated, recovery for the intentional unpermitted touching
is available.

VI  INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL

DISTRESS

Of all of the intentional torts covered in this chapter, the newcomer to
the  tort  block  is  the  claim  for  intentional  infliction  of  emotional
distress.  This  is  oftentimes  referred  to  as  the  tort  of  “Outrage”
because  one  of  its  chief  elements — outrageous  conduct  by  the
defendant — is  often  the  primary  focus  of  a  court’s  analysis  of  this
claim. Sometimes a defendant’s conduct is extreme and causes real
harm,  but  other  existing  theories  of  recovery  might  be  unavailing  or
provide  a  less  than  satisfactory  response.  In  such  situations,  smart
lawyers are able to draw upon existing legal principles to help courts
craft a new cause of action. This cause of action is designed primarily
to  protect  one’s  right  to  be  free  from  severe  emotional  distress
caused by particularly reprehensible conduct. It is quite expansive in
that  it  can  be  applied  to  a  myriad  of  different  fact  patterns.  This
flexibility is both a beneﬁt and a potential curse — courts are loath to
make it too easy for people to sue for hurt feelings, or else everyone
could  be  considered  a  tortfeasor.  Notice  how  the  elements  of  this
claim  are  designed  to  set  relatively  high  hurdles  for  a  claimant  to
clear in order to have a valid claim under this cause of action.

A. Outrageous Conduct Intending Emotional

Distress

ZALNIS v. THOROUGHBRED DATSUN CAR CO.
645 P.2d 292 (Colo. Ct. App. 1982)

     , J.

Plaintiff, Christiane Zalnis, appeals the partial summary judgment
dismissing  her  outrageous  conduct  claim  against  defendants.  We
reverse.

The following facts appear from viewing the record in a light most
favorable  to  the  plaintiff.  In  January  1978,  Zalnis  contracted  with
defendant  Thoroughbred  Datsun  for  the  purchase  of  a  1978  Datsun
automobile. She took possession of the car on that day, and paid the
balance of the purchase price two days later. Zalnis dealt directly with
Linnie  Cade,  a  salesperson  employed  by  Thoroughbred  Datsun.
Defendant Trosper, President of Thoroughbred Datsun, approved the
transaction  based  on  representations  by  Cade  which  were  later
determined  to  be  based  upon  erroneous  calculations.  When  Trosper
discovered several days later that Cade had sold the car at a loss of
approximately  $1,000,  he  instructed  Cade  and  the  sales  manager  to
make  good  the  loss  by  either  demanding  more  money  from  Zalnis,
retrieving the car, or repaying the difference out of Cade’s salary.

Cade  refused  to  follow  any  of  Trosper’s  alternative  instructions,
but  another  sales  employee,  defendant  Anthony,  telephoned  Zalnis
and told her to return her car to the dealership because it was being
recalled. When Zalnis arrived at Thoroughbred Datsun, she refused to
give  up  possession  of  her  car  without  a  work  order  explaining  the
need for the recall. Nevertheless, her car was taken from her. During
the  next  few  hours,  Zalnis  alleges  that  Anthony  called  her  a  “French
whore,”  followed  her  throughout  the  showroom,  told  her  they  were
keeping  her  automobile,  yelled,  screamed,  used  abusive  language,
grabbed  her  by  the  arm  in  a  threatening  manner,  and  continually
threatened  and  intimidated  her  when  she  attempted  to  secure  the
return of her automobile by telling her to “shut up.”

During  this  period,  Zalnis  telephoned  her  attorney,  who  then
telephoned  Trosper  and  eventually  obtained  the  return  of  her  car.
During  their  conversation,  Trosper  told  the  attorney  that  Zalnis  had
“been  sleeping  with  that  nigger  salesman  and  that’s  the  only  reason
she got the deal she got.” Trosper had known Zalnis for many years,

and had told Cade and the sales manager that she was crazy and she
had watched her husband kill himself.

Thoroughbred  Datsun  and  Trosper  moved  for  partial  summary
judgment  on  the  outrageous  conduct  claim
[also  known  as
“intentional  infliction  of  emotional  distress”].  The  trial  court  granted
the  motion,  determining  that,  although  the  conduct  was  “almost
shocking  to  the  conscience  and  person  of  anyone  observing  that
behavior,”  it  did  not  amount  to  outrageous  conduct  under  Colorado
precedent.

In Rugg. v. McCarty, 476 P.2d 753 (Colo. 1970), the Supreme Court
recognized the tort of outrageous conduct and adopted the deﬁnition
set  forth  in  the  Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts  §46:  “One  who  by
extreme  and  outrageous  conduct  intentionally  or  recklessly  causes
severe  emotional  distress  to  another  is  subject  to  liability  for  such
emotional distress, and if bodily harm to the other results from it, for
is
such  bodily  harm.”  Although  the  question  whether  conduct
sufﬁciently  outrageous  is  ordinarily  a  question  for  the  jury,  the  court
must  determine  in  the  ﬁrst  instance  whether  reasonable  persons
could differ on the outrageousness issue.

The  defendants  argue  that  their  actions  here  were  no  more  than
“mere insults, indignities, threats, annoyances, petty oppressions, and
other  trivialities.”  Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts  §46,  Comment  d.
However,  the  defendants  did  not  merely  threaten  and  insult  Zalnis;
they  took  away  her  car  and  repeatedly  harassed  her.  Conduct,
otherwise  permissible,  may  become  extreme  and  outrageous  if  it  is
an abuse by the actor of a position in which he has actual or apparent
authority  over  the  other,  or  the  power  to  affect  the  other’s  interests.
Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts  §46,  Comment  e;  See,  e.g.,  Rugg  v.
McCarty, supra.

The  conduct  here  is  not  a  mere  insistence  on  rights  in  a
(Second)of  Torts  §46,
permissible  manner.  See  Restatement
Comment g.  Rather,  the  defendants’  recall  of  the  car  was  to  avoid  a

bad bargain, and accordingly, the conduct was not privileged. Meiter,
supra; see Enright v. Groves, 560 P.2d 851 (Colo. 1977).

Defendants  assert  that  their  actions  must  be  judged  by  the
impact  they  would  have  on  an  ordinary  person  with  ordinary
sensibilities.  We  disagree.  The  outrageous  character  of  the  conduct
may  arise  from  the  actor’s  knowledge  that  the  other  is  peculiarly
susceptible  to  emotional  distress  by  reason  of  some  physical  or
mental  condition  or  peculiarity.  Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts  §46,
Comment f. In Enright, supra, outrageous conduct was found where a
police  ofﬁcer  effecting  an  illegal  arrest  grabbed  and  twisted  the
plaintiff’s arm even after she told him her arm was easily dislocated.
In  the  instant  case,  plaintiff  was  peculiarly  susceptible  to  emotional
distress  because  she  had  witnessed  her  husband’s  suicide,  and
Trosper  and  Anthony  knew  about  her  susceptibility.  Here,  as  in
Enright, the defendants’ knowledge exacerbated the conduct.

Here,  Zalnis  has  sufﬁciently  alleged  that  Trosper  and  Anthony
acted with the intent to bully her into giving up her car. In view of their
knowledge  of  her  emotional  susceptibility,  they  could  be  considered
to  have  acted  intentionally  or  recklessly  in  causing  her  severe
emotional distress.

The  defendants  argue  that  we  should  observe  a  distinction
between  a  single  outrageous  occurrence  and  an  outrageous  course
of  conduct.  While  it  is  true  that  “the  courts  are  more  likely  to  ﬁnd
outrageous  conduct  in  a  series  of  incidents  or  a  ‘course  of  conduct’
than  in  a  single  incident,”  it  is  the  totality  of  conduct  that  must  be
evaluated  to  determine  whether  outrageous  conduct  has  occurred.
Our  evaluation  of  the  totality  of  the  conduct  leads  to  the  conclusion
that  reasonable  persons  could  differ  on  the  question  whether  there
judgment  was
was  outrageous  conduct,  and  thus,  summary
improper.

The  judgment  is  reversed  and  the  cause  is  remanded  for  further

proceedings.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Intentional  or  Reckless  Standard.   The  Zalnis  case  involves
conduct alleged to have been intentional in causing severe emotional
distress.  In  fact,  as  the  court  reads  the  allegations  in  that  case,  the
defendants’  plan  was  to  cause  so  much  stress  to  plaintiff  that  she
would  yield  to  their  unreasonable  and  non-privileged  demands  to
undo  the  transaction.  The  court  mentions  in  its  statement  of  the
elements  that,  notwithstanding  the  name  of  the  cause  of  action,
reckless  infliction  of  emotional  distress  will  also  sufﬁce.  Among
intentional  torts,  this  is  the  only  one  that  recognizes  a  claim  based
merely on recklessness. Recklessness involves acting in the face of a
known likelihood of a certain result happening. This is a lesser form of
scienter  than  intention  which,  as  we  saw  at  the  beginning  of  this
chapter,  requires  either  a  desire  or  knowledge  to  a  substantial
certainty of a certain result happening. Recklessness will be analyzed
more  directly  near  the  end  of  Chapter  4  when  we  contrast  it  with
ordinary negligence.

2.  Other  Causes  of  Action.   Sometimes  the  facts  in  a  case  for
intentional infliction of emotional distress might permit the plaintiff to
plead  another  tort  cause  of  action.  Considering  some  of  the
intentional tort claims already covered in this book, can you spot any
such  possible  claims  the  plaintiff  might  have  attempted  in  Zalnis?
Rule  18  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  permits  a  plaintiff
pleading one claim against an opposing party to plead as many other
claims as the plaintiff might have at the same time.

3. Elements.  What are the elements of this cause of action? How
is  the  name  “intentional  infliction  of  emotional  distress”  a  bit  of  a
misnomer? What must be intended by the defendant to be potentially
liable under this cause of action?

4.  Objective  Test  for  Outrageous  Conduct.   The  Restatement
(Second)  of  Torts  §46,  cmt.  d  (1965)  describes  the  commonly
accepted test of what is “outrageous” as follows:

Generally, the case is one in which the recitation of the facts to an
average member of the community would arouse his resentment
against the actor, and lead him to exclaim, “Outrageous!”

What  would  be  considered  outrageous  obviously  can  change  under
the circumstances of each case and from one community, and time,
to  another.  What  is  it  about  the  defendant’s  misconduct  in  the
foregoing  case  that  led  the  court  to  the  conclusion  that  it  might  be
considered outrageous?

5.  Problems.   Might  the  victims  of  the  following  conduct  have  a

viable claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress?

A.  Teenage  mega-star  Justine  Bleeper  cannot  do  any  normal
activities  without  being  followed  by  paparazzi,  insistent  on
taking  unflattering  photographs  of  her  and  selling  them  for
proﬁt.  She  has  begun  to  break  down,  sobbing  tears  of  anguish
every  time  she  fails  in  an  attempt  to  go  shopping  and  ends  up
being photographed against her will. Now she is afraid to leave
her home.

B.  Boo  is  a  reclusive  sort  of  man  who  lives  with  his  father  on  a
relatively quiet street in a small southern town. Local kids refuse
to  grant  him  any  peace  as  they  insist  upon  repeatedly  ringing
the  doorbell  and  running  away  from  the  home.  It’s  driving  Boo
mad.

C. Paula is a “gunner” in her ﬁrst-year law school class, choosing to
sit in the front row, diligently brieﬁng every case, and raising her
hand  constantly  to  answer  questions  and  pose  her  own
hypothetical  questions.  Behind  her  back,  her  fellow  students
make  fun  of  her,  calling  her  names,  giggling  whenever  she
attempts to participate in class, and mocking her in the hallways
in  between  class  sessions.  She  cannot  handle  the  intimidation,
drops  out  of  law  school,  and  now  wants  to  recover  from  her
classmates her lost future earnings as a lawyer.

STRAUSS v. CILEK
418 N.W.2d 378 (Iowa 1987)

       , J.

The  sole  issue  in  this  interlocutory  appeal  is  whether  the  trial
court erred in denying defendant’s motion for summary judgment on
plaintiff’s  claim  of  intentional  infliction  of  emotional  distress  arising
from  defendant’s  romantic  and  sexual  relationship  with  plaintiff’s
wife.

Defendant’s affair with plaintiff’s wife lasted one year. Plaintiff did
not learn about the affair until after it was over. Plaintiff and his wife
were in the process of obtaining a divorce at the time plaintiff initiated
the  present  action  for  actual  and  punitive  damages.  The  issue
whether  plaintiff  in  this  case  can  maintain  a  claim  for  intentional
infliction  of  emotional  distress  that  arises  out  of  a  failed  marital
relationship  may  be  appropriately  resolved  upon  presentation  of
evidence  through  summary  judgment.  Van  Meter  v.  Van  Meter,  328
N.W.2d 497, 498 (Iowa 1983).

Summary judgment is appropriate if the moving party shows that
there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving
party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Iowa R. Civ. P. 237(c).
The  resisting  party  must  set  forth  speciﬁc  facts  showing  there  is  a
genuine issue for trial. Iowa R. Civ. P. 237(e). Our task on appeal is to
determine  only  whether  a  genuine  issue  of  material  fact  exists  and
whether the law was correctly applied. Adam v. Mt. Pleasant Bank &
Trust Co., 355 N.W.2d 868, 872 (Iowa 1984).

The  elements  of  the  tort  of  intentional  infliction  of  emotional

distress are as follows:

(1) Outrageous conduct by the defendant;
(2) The defendant’s intention of causing, or reckless disregard

of the probability of causing emotional distress;

(3)  The  plaintiff’s  suffering  severe  or  extreme  emotional

distress; and

(4)  Actual  causation  of  the  emotional  distress  by  the

defendant’s outrageous conduct.

Amsden v. Grinnell Mut. Reinsurance Co., 203 N.W.2d 252, 255 (Iowa
1972).

In  overruling  defendant’s  motion  for  summary  judgment,  the  trial
court  declined  to  rule  as  a  matter  of  law  that  defendant’s  actions
were not outrageous. We ﬁnd the evidence in the summary judgment
record  insufﬁcient  to  demonstrate  a  genuine  issue  of  fact  on  the
outrageous conduct element.

It  is  for  the  court  to  determine  in  the  ﬁrst  instance  whether  the
relevant  conduct  may  reasonably  be  regarded  as  outrageous.
Roalson  v.  Chaney,  334  N.W.2d  754,  756  (Iowa  1983).  To  be
outrageous  the  conduct  must  be  so  extreme  in  degree  as  to  go
beyond  all  possible  bounds  of  decency  to  be  regarded  as  atrocious
and  utterly  intolerable  in  a  civilized  community.  Vinson  v.  Lin-Mar
Community School Dist., 360 N.W.2d 108, 118 (Iowa 1984) (citations
omitted).

In Roalson v. Chaney, 334 N.W.2d at 755, Chaney asked Roalson’s
wife to marry him while she and Roalson were still married. The Iowa
Supreme  Court  held  no  trier  of  fact  could  reasonably  ﬁnd  Chaney’s
conduct  outrageous.  Id.  at  757.  More  recently,  in  Kunau  v.  Pillers,
Pillers &  Pillers,  404  N.W.2d  573,  576  (Iowa  App.  1987),  we  held  the
facts  of  a  case  in  which  Kunau’s  wife  had  a  lengthy  sexual  and
romantic  affair  with  her  dentist  could  not  support  a  conclusion  the
dentist’s conduct was outrageous.

Plaintiff  claims  defendant’s  conduct  in  the  present  case  is
outrageous  because  plaintiff  and  defendant  had  known  each  other
since  elementary  school  and  were  good  friends.  We  do  not  say  that
sexual  relations  between  a  plaintiff’s  friend  and  spouse  would  never
give rise to a ﬁnding of outrageous conduct. We ﬁnd the facts in this

case,  however,  do  not  support  a  conclusion  defendant’s  conduct  is
outrageous.

Defendant  and  plaintiff’s  wife  kept  their  relationship  secret  until
after  it  was  over.  Personal  letters  written  by  defendant  to  plaintiff’s
wife  reveal  defendant’s  genuine  intention  to  leave  his  wife  and
children  and  to  create  a  permanent  relationship  with  plaintiff’s  wife.
Plaintiff  did  not  discover  these  letters  discussing  defendant’s  plans
for the future until after he knew the affair had occurred. The record
also  reveals  plaintiff’s  wife  was  unhappy  in  her  marriage.  She  had
previously engaged in an extramarital affair that lasted for ﬁve years
with another of plaintiff’s good friends.

We  do  not  condone  promiscuous  sexual  conduct.  See
Fundermann  v.  Mickelson,  304  N.W.2d  790,  794  (Iowa  1981).
However,  we  do  not  ﬁnd  defendant’s  conduct  in  participating  in  a
sexual  relationship  with  a  married  woman,  his  friend’s  wife,  who
willingly continued the affair over an extended period, is atrocious and
utterly  intolerable  conduct  so  extreme  in  degree  as  to  go  beyond  all
possible bounds of decency. Vinson, 360 N.W.2d at 118. The parties
are  residents  of  Iowa  City,  a  community  of  50,000  and  the  home  of
the  University  of  Iowa.  A  recitation  of  the  facts  of  this  case  to  an
average  member  of  the  community  would  not  lead  him  to  exclaim,
“Outrageous!”

The trial court erred in overruling defendant’s motion for summary
judgment.  We  reverse  and  remand  the  case  for  entry  of  an  order
granting defendant’s motion for summary judgment.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Determination  of  Outrageousness.   In  order  to  recover  on  a
challenged claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, one of
the  biggest  hurdles  a  plaintiff  must  overcome  is  demonstrating  that
the  challenged  conduct  meets  the  Restatement  deﬁnition  for

“outrageous”  conduct.  There  are  a  lot  of  different  people  in  the
audience  a  plaintiff  must  convince.  First,  the  plaintiff  must  get  the
trial judge to accept the possibility that the alleged conduct might be
considered  outrageous — otherwise  defendant’s  motion  to  dismiss
will be granted. At trial the plaintiff must continue to convince the trial
judge  of  the  viability  of  the  claim,  or  else  face  a  motion  for  directed
verdict. Even after doing so, the plaintiff will then have to convince a
jury  (in  federal  court  by  a  unanimous  verdict)  that  the  conduct  is
outrageous.  Even  if  the  plaintiff  has  succeeded  with  each  of  these
audiences, the plaintiff may have to convince a three-judge panel on
an appellate court that the conduct might be considered outrageous.
2.  Other  Previously  Recognized  Claims.   Earlier  in  the  twentieth
century,  courts  in  most  states  used  to  recognize  so-called  “heart
balm”  torts  related  to  various  acts  of  home-wrecking.  For  example,
many  states  recognized  a  claim  for  “alienation  of  affection”  or
“criminal  conversation”  when  someone  seduced  another’s  spouse
into  having  an  affair.  For  various  reasons,  most  states  have  decided
to get out of the business of regulating the morality of such conduct
and have abandoned these causes of action. Does this explain, in any
way, the reluctance by the Strauss court to even submit the issue of
outrageousness to the jury?

3. Intent.   Recall  that  this  tort  claim  can  be  committed  by  either
one  intending  to  cause  the  plaintiff’s  severe  emotional  distress  or
through acts that recklessly cause such distress. Given our coverage
of  the  deﬁnitions  for  intentional  misconduct,  do  the  facts  in  Strauss
seem to be more a case of intentionally causing emotional distress or
recklessly causing it?

B. Severe Emotional Distress

The ﬁnal signiﬁcant obstacle that every plaintiff faces when trying to
recover for the tort of outrage is to prove that the plaintiff’s emotional

distress is severe.  What  standard  courts  use  to  measure  the  degree
of emotional distress required to prove this element, and the type of
proof  demanded,  are  two  principal  subjects  of  the  Miller  and  the
Clinton  cases.  You  should  focus  both  on  the  deﬁnition  of  severe
emotional distress, as well as upon the types of evidence available to
a plaintiff to meet this standard.

MILLER v. WILLBANKS, M.D.
8 S.W.3d 607 (Tenn. 1999)

      , J.

injury

We  granted  this  appeal  to  decide  whether  the  Court  of  Appeals
erred  in  holding  that  expert  medical  or  scientiﬁc  proof  of  a  serious
mental
is  required  to  support  the  plaintiffs’  claims  for
intentional infliction of emotional distress. The trial court granted the
defendants’  motion  for  summary  judgment  because  the  plaintiffs
failed  to  have  available  expert  proof  to  corroborate  their  claims  of
having  sustained  serious  mental  injuries.  The  Court  of  Appeals
afﬁrmed the trial court’s dismissal of the case.
[The  Millers  sued  Dr.  Willbanks  for

infliction  of
emotional distress. Shortly after Elizabeth Ann Miller gave birth to her
daughter,  defendant  suspected  Miller  of  being  a  drug  abuser.  The
baby  had  symptoms  of  Drug  Withdrawal  Syndrome.  The  defendant
spread his suspicions among hospital staff and even Miller’s parents
before  confronting  her.  She  agreed  to  a  drug  test,  which  came  back
negative.  Undaunted,  defendant  continued  with  his  accusations  and
reported  Miller  to  the  local  health  department,  which  visited  Miller’s
home for inspection and examination of Miller over her objections.]

intentional

The  Millers  sued  Dr.  Willbanks  [and  others]  for  the  tort  of
intentional  infliction  of  emotional  distress.  The  defendants  then
moved  for  dismissal  or  summary  judgment,  which  the  trial  court
granted due to the plaintiffs’ lack of expert evidence to support their

claims  of  serious  mental  injury.  The  Court  of  Appeals  afﬁrmed  the
decision of the trial court.

We  granted  the  plaintiffs’  appeal  to  decide  whether  the  Court  of
Appeals  erred  in  holding  that  expert  medical  or  scientiﬁc  proof  of  a
serious mental injury was required to support the plaintiffs’ claim for
the intentional infliction of emotional distress.

[The  court  summarized  the  history  in  Tennessee  of  courts’  initial
reluctance  to  recognize  claims  where  the  primary  injury  was  mental
distress.  Courts  began  permitting  such  claims  by  stretching  certain
tort doctrines. Eventually the Tennessee Supreme Court adopted the
tort  of  intentional  infliction  of  emotional  distress  based  upon  the
exacting requirements of the Restatement for proving such a claim.]

In the brief history of the tort of intentional infliction of emotional
distress,  this  Court  has  not  examined  whether  expert  testimony  is
required  to  establish  the  existence  of  a  serious  mental  injury.  Other
courts,  however,  that  have  examined  this  issue  have  come  to
markedly different conclusions.

A  minority  of  jurisdictions  requires  expert  medical  or  scientiﬁc
proof  of  serious  mental  injury  to  maintain  a  claim  for  intentional
infliction  of  emotional  distress.  See,  e.g.,  Kazatsky  v.  King  David
Mem’l Park, Inc., 515 Pa. 183, 527 A.2d 988 (Pa. 1987). These courts
reason  that  expert  proof  is  necessary  to  prevent  the  tort  from  being
reduced to a single element of outrageousness, so by requiring expert
proof, the elements of outrageous conduct and serious mental injury
remain  distinct.  See  Kazatsky,  527  A.2d  at  995.  Moreover,  courts
expressing the minority view contend that because expert proof can
be  easily  obtained,  it  must  be  used  to  prove  serious  mental  injury.
These courts assert that due to the wide availability of expert proof,
plaintiffs will encounter “little difﬁculty in procuring reliable testimony
as to the nature and extent of their injuries.” Id.

A majority of courts that have examined this issue, however, have
concluded  that  expert  proof  is  generally  not  necessary  to  establish

the existence of a serious mental injury. The flagrant and outrageous
nature  of  the  defendant’s  conduct,  according  to  these  courts,  adds
weight  to  a  plaintiff’s  claim  and  affords  more  assurance  that  the
claim is serious. Moreover, expert testimony is not essential because
other reliable forms of evidence, including physical manifestations of
distress and subjective testimony, are available. Courts following the
majority approach also contend that expert testimony is normally not
necessary because a jury is generally capable of determining whether
a  claimant  has  sustained  a  serious  mental  injury  as  a  proximate
result  of  the  intentional  conduct  of  another  person.  See  McKnight,
358  S.E.2d  at  109.  Additionally,  courts  expressing  the  majority  view
reason  that  the  very  nature  of  the  tort  of  intentional  infliction  of
emotional distress “makes it impossible to quantify damages mainly
on expert medical evidence.” Chandler, 741 P.2d at 867.

intentional

interpretation  of

We  conclude  that  the  majority  approach  is  consistent  with  our
law  of
precedents  and  the  underlying  policies  governing  the
intentional  infliction  of  emotional  distress.  As  previously  discussed,
the  Court  in  Medlin  examined  and  rejected  arguments  traditionally
used  to  justify  limiting  actions  for  mental  distress.  Additionally,
through  our
infliction  of  emotional
distress,  this  Court  has  also  rejected  a  second  argument — the
requirement  of  an  accompanying  physical  injury.  See  Medlin,  398
S.W.2d  at  273-74.  The  policy  underlying  development  of  the  tort  is
that  legitimate  claims  for  emotional  distress  should  be  actionable
and  should  be  judged  on  their  merits.  With  our  decision  today,  we
reject  a  third  argument — the  requirement  of  expert  testimony.  In  so
doing, we ensure that a plaintiff with a legitimate claim for intentional
infliction  of  emotional  distress  will  have  an  opportunity  to  seek
redress for that claim, unburdened by the historical limits imposed by
law.

We  recognize  that  legitimate  concerns  of  fraudulent  and  trivial
claims  are  implicated  when  a  plaintiff  brings  an  action  for  a  purely
mental injury. Thus, safeguards are needed to ensure the reliability of

claims  for  intentional  and  negligent  infliction  of  emotional  distress.
These  safeguards,  however,  differ  based  on  the  kind  of  conduct,
rather than the kind of injury, for which a plaintiff seeks a remedy.

With  regard  to  intentional  infliction  of  emotional  distress,  the
added  measure  of  reliability,  i.e.,  the  insurance  against  frivolous
claims,  is  found  in  the  plaintiff’s  burden  to  prove  that  the  offending
conduct  was  outrageous.  This  is  an  exacting  standard  requiring  the
plaintiff  to  show  that  the  defendant’s  conduct  is  “so  outrageous  in
character,  and  so  extreme  in  degree,  as  to  go  beyond  all  possible
bounds  of  decency  and  to  be  regarded  as  atrocious,  and  utterly
intolerable  in  a  civilized  community.”  Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts
§46  cmt.  d  (1965).  Such  conduct  is  “important  evidence  that  the
distress  has  existed,”  id.  §45  cmt.  j,  and  from  such  conduct,  more
reliable  indicia  of  a  severe  mental  injury  may  arise.  The  outrageous
nature  of  the  conduct,  therefore,  vitiates  the  need  for  expert
testimony  in  a  claim  for  intentional  infliction  of  emotional  distress.
The  risk  of  frivolous  litigation,  then,  is  alleviated  in  claims  for
intentional  infliction  of  emotional  distress  by  the  requirement  that  a
plaintiff prove that the offending conduct was so outrageous that it is
not tolerated by a civilized society.

Although we adopt the majority approach and hold that plaintiffs
normally will not be required to support their claims of serious mental
injury  by  expert  proof  in  order  to  recover  damages  in  a  suit  based
upon  the  intentional  infliction  of  emotional  distress,  we  certainly  do
not  discredit  the  use  of  expert  testimony  at  trial.  We  are  fully  aware
that  there  will  be  many  cases  in  which  a  judge  or  jury  may  not
appreciate  the  full  extent  and  disabling  effects  of  a  plaintiff’s
emotional injury without expert evidence.

Our  decision  today  merely  recognizes  that  in  most  cases  other
forms  of  proof  may  also  be  used  to  establish  a  claim  for  intentional
infliction  of  emotional  distress.  Such  proof  may  include  a  claimant’s
own testimony, See Peery, 897 P.2d at 1191, as well as the testimony
of other lay witnesses acquainted with the claimant, see Uebelacker,

549  N.E.2d  at  1220.  Physical  manifestations  of  emotional  distress
may also serve as proof of serious mental injury. Moreover, evidence
insomnia,  and
that  a  plaintiff  has  suffered  from  nightmares,
depression or has sought psychiatric treatment may support a claim
of a serious mental injury. See Medlin, 398 S.W.2d at 272; Johnson v.
Woman’s  Hosp.,  527  S.W.2d  133,  140  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  1975).  The
intensity  and  duration  of  the  mental  distress  are  also  factors  that
may be considered in determining the severity of the injury.

Such  proof,  however,  is  no  guarantee  that  a  plaintiff  will  prevail.
The weight, faith, and credibility afforded to any witness’s testimony
lies in the ﬁrst instance with the trier of fact who is free to conclude
that  the  subjective  testimony  of  a  plaintiff  or  other  lay  witnesses  is
not  sufﬁcient  to  prove  a  serious  mental  injury.  Thus,  although  not
legally required, “expert testimony may be the most effective method
of  demonstrating  the  existence  of  severe  emotional  distress.”
Richardson, 705 P.2d at 457 n.6.

In  summary,  we  hold  that  expert  medical  or  scientiﬁc  proof  of  a
serious mental injury is generally not required to maintain a claim for
intentional infliction of emotional distress. Accordingly, we reverse the
judgments of the trial court and the Court of Appeals and remand to
the trial court for further proceedings.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Restatement  Test  for  Severe  Emotional  Distress.   In  trying  to
differentiate  severe  emotional  distress  from  ordinary  emotional
distress,  courts  frequently  cite  to  the  following  explanation  from  the
Restatement:

Emotional distress passed under various names, such as mental
suffering, mental anguish, mental or nervous shock, or the like. It
includes  all  highly  unpleasant  mental  reactions,  such  as  fright,
horror,  grief,  shame,  humiliation,  embarrassment,  anger,  chagrin,

disappointment,  worry,  and  nausea.  It  is  only  where  it  is  extreme
that  the  liability  arises.  Complete  emotional  tranquility  is  seldom
attainable  in  this  world,  and  some  degree  of  transient  and  trivial
emotional  distress  is  a  part  of  the  price  of  living  among  people.
The  law  intervenes  only  where  the  distress  inflicted  is  so  severe
that  no  reasonable  man  could  be  expected  to  endure  it.  The
intensity and duration of the distress are factors to be considered
in determining its severity.

Restatement (Second) of Torts §46, cmt. j (1965) (emphasis added).

2.  Reluctance  to  Water  Down  the  Severity  Element.   The  Miller
court  mentions  that  the  minority  of  courts  that  demand  expert
witness  proof  of  severe  emotional  distress  do  so  out  of  a  concern
that  otherwise  this  ﬁnal  hurdle  will  become  practically  meaningless.
In  other  words,  that  proof  of  this  tort  will  be  reduced  essentially  to
showing  that  the  defendant’s  conduct  was  outrageous.  The  Miller
court  ﬁnds  this  unpersuasive.  Nevertheless  it  too  resorts  to  reliance
upon  the  element  of  outrageousness  to  help  support  its  decision  to
refrain  from  requiring  expert  testimony.  After  this  decision,  in  the
majority  of  states,  how  difﬁcult  will  it  be  for  plaintiffs  to  survive
they  have  proof  of  sufﬁciently  outrageous
dismissal  when
misconduct?

JONES v. CLINTON
990 F. Supp. 657 (W.D. Ark. 1998)

      , J.

The  plaintiff  in  this  lawsuit,  Paula  Corbin  Jones,  seeks  civil
damages  from  William  Jefferson  Clinton,  President  of  the  United
States  .  .  .  for  alleged  actions  beginning  with  an  incident  in  a  hotel
suite  in  Little  Rock,  Arkansas.  [The  U.S.  Supreme  Court  had  already
decided  in  this  case  that  the  president  had  no  immunity  from  suit

despite  his  ofﬁce.  Thereafter  the  federal  district  court  dismissed
plaintiff’s claims for defamation and due process violations for failure
to  state  a  claim.  The  current  motion  is  by  the  president  seeking
summary  judgment  of,  among  other  things,  plaintiff’s  claim  for
intentional infliction of emotional distress.]

This  lawsuit  is  based  on  an  incident  that  is  said  to  have  taken
place on the afternoon of May 8, 1991, in a suite at the Excelsior Hotel
in Little Rock, Arkansas. President Clinton was Governor of the State
of Arkansas at the time, and plaintiff was a State employee with the
Arkansas Industrial Development Commission (“AIDC”), having begun
her State employment on March 11, 1991. Ferguson was an Arkansas
State  Police  ofﬁcer  assigned  to  the  Governor’s  security  detail.
[Plaintiff  alleged  that  a  member  of  Clinton’s  security  detail  relayed  a
message to her that Clinton wanted to meet her at his suite and gave
her his room number. She went to the room thinking that meeting the
Governor of Arkansas might be a good career move and an honor.]

Plaintiff  states  that  upon  arriving  at  the  suite  and  announcing
herself,  the  Governor  shook  her  hand,  invited  her  in,  and  closed  the
door. She states that a few minutes of small talk ensued. . . . Plaintiff
states  that  the  Governor  then  “unexpectedly  reached  over  to  [her],
took  her  hand,  and  pulled  her  toward  him,  so  that  their  bodies  were
close to each other.” She states she removed her hand from his and
retreated  several  feet,  but  that  the  Governor  approached  her  again
and, while saying, “I love the way your hair flows down your back” and
“I love your curves,” put his hand on her leg, started sliding it toward
her pelvic area, and bent down to attempt to kiss her on the neck, all
without  her  consent.  Plaintiff  states  that  she  exclaimed,  “What  are
you doing?” told the Governor that she was “not that kind of girl,” and
“escaped” from the Governor’s reach “by walking away from him.” She
states she was extremely upset and confused and, not knowing what
to do, attempted to distract the Governor by chatting about his wife.
Plaintiff states that she sat down at the end of the sofa nearest the
door, but that the Governor approached the sofa where she had taken

a  seat  and,  as  he  sat  down,  “lowered  his  trousers  and  underwear,
exposed  his  penis  (which  was  erect)  and  told  [her]  to  ‘kiss  it.’”  She
states that she was “horriﬁed” by this and that she “jumped up from
the  couch”  and  told  the  Governor  that  she  had  to  go,  saying
something  to  the  effect  that  she  had  to  get  back  to  the  registration
desk. Plaintiff states that the Governor, “while fondling his penis,” said,
“Well, I don’t want to make you do anything you don’t want to do,” and
then  pulled  up  his  pants  and  said,  “If  you  get  in  trouble  for  leaving
work, have Dave [a member of his detail] call me immediately and I’ll
take care of it.” She states that as she left the room (the door of which
was  not  locked),  the  Governor  “detained”  her  momentarily,  “looked
sternly”  at  her,  and  said,  “You  are  smart.  Let’s  keep  this  between
ourselves.”

Plaintiff  states  that  the  Governor’s  advances  to  her  were
unwelcome,  that  she  never  said  or  did  anything  to  suggest  to  the
Governor  that  she  was  willing  to  have  sex  with  him,  and  that  during
the  time  they  were  together  in  the  hotel  suite,  she  resisted  his
advances  although  she  was  “stunned  by  them  and  intimidated  by
who  he  was.”  She  states  that  from  that  point  on,  she  was  “very
fearful”  that  her  refusal  to  submit  to  the  Governor’s  advances  could
damage her career and even jeopardize her employment.

Plaintiff  voluntarily  terminated  her  employment  with  AIDC  on
February  20,  1993,  in  order  to  move  to  California  with  her  husband,
who  had  been  transferred.  .  .  .  Thereafter,  on  May  6,  1994,  plaintiff
ﬁled this lawsuit.

The  President  moves  for  summary  judgment  on  the  [plaintiff’s
IIED claim on the] following grounds: . . . plaintiff’s claim of intentional
infliction  of  emotional  distress  or  outrage  fails  because  (a)  by
plaintiff’s  own  testimony,  the  conduct  at  issue  does  not  constitute
intentional infliction of emotional distress or outrage under Arkansas
law, and (b) plaintiff did not as a result of the alleged conduct suffer
emotional distress so severe that no reasonable person could endure
it.

Arkansas recognizes a claim of intentional infliction of emotional
distress  based  on  sexual  harassment.  To  establish  a  claim  of
intentional infliction of emotional distress, a plaintiff must prove that:
(1)  the  defendant  intended  to  inflict  emotional  distress  or  knew  or
should have known that emotional distress was the likely result of his
conduct;  (2)  the  conduct  was  extreme  and  outrageous  and  utterly
intolerable in a civilized community; (3) the defendant’s conduct was
the  cause  of  the  plaintiff’s  distress;  and  (4)  the  plaintiff’s  emotional
distress was so severe in nature that no reasonable person could be
expected to endure it.

The  President  argues  that  the  alleged  conduct  of  which  plaintiff
complains was brief and isolated; did not result in any physical harm
or objective symptoms of the requisite severe distress; did not result
in distress so severe that no reasonable person could be expected to
endure  it;  and  he  had  no  knowledge  of  any  special  condition  of
plaintiff that would render her particularly susceptible to distress. He
argues  that  plaintiff  has  failed  to  identify  the  kind  of  clear  cut  proof
that  Arkansas  courts  require  for  a  claim  of  outrage  and  that  he  is
therefore entitled to summary judgment. The Court agrees.

One  is  subject  to  liability  for  the  tort  of  outrage  or  intentional
infliction of emotional distress if he or she wilfully or wantonly causes
severe  emotional  distress  to  another  by  extreme  and  outrageous
conduct.  In  M.B.M.  Co.  v.  Counce,  596  S.W.2d  681,  687  (Ark.  1980),
the Arkansas Supreme Court stated that “by extreme and outrageous
conduct, we mean conduct that is so outrageous in character, and so
extreme  in  degree,  as  to  go  beyond  all  possible  bounds  of  decency,
and  to  be  regarded  as  atrocious,  and  utterly  intolerable  in  civilized
society.” Whether conduct is “extreme and outrageous” is determined
by looking at [the conduct at issue; the period of time over which the
conduct took place; the relation between plaintiff and defendant; and
defendant’s  knowledge  that  plaintiff  is  particularly  susceptible  to
emotional distress by reason of some physical or mental peculiarity].
The tort is clearly not intended to provide legal redress for every slight

insult or indignity that one must endure. The Arkansas courts take a
strict  approach  and  give  a  narrow  view  to  claims  of  outrage  and
merely describing conduct as outrageous does not make it so.

includes  offensive

Plaintiff  seems  to  base  her  claim  of  outrage  on  her  erroneous
belief  that  the  allegations  she  has  presented  are  sufﬁcient  to
constitute  criminal  sexual  assault.  She  states  that  “Mr.  Clinton’s
outrageous  conduct
language,  an  offensive
proposition,  offensive  touching  (constituting  sexual  assault  under
both  federal  and  state  deﬁnitions),  and  actual  exposure  of  intimate
private body part,” and that “there are few more outrageous acts than
a  criminal  sexual  assault  followed  by  unwanted  exposure,  coupled
with  a  demand  for  oral  sex  by  the  most  powerful  man  in  the  state
against a very young, low-level employee.”

While  the  Court  will  certainly  agree  that  plaintiff’s  allegations
describe offensive conduct, the Court, as previously noted, has found
that  the  Governor’s  alleged  conduct  does  not  constitute  sexual
assault.  Rather,  the  conduct  as  alleged  by  plaintiff  describes  a  mere
sexual  proposition  or  encounter,  albeit  an  odious  one,  that  was
relatively  brief  in  duration,  did  not  involve  any  coercion  or  threats  of
reprisal, and was abandoned as soon as plaintiff made clear that the
advance  was  not  welcome.  The  Court  is  not  aware  of  any  authority
holding  that  such  a  sexual  encounter  or  proposition  of  the  type
alleged in this case, without more, gives rise to a claim of outrage.

Moreover, notwithstanding the offensive nature of the Governor’s
alleged conduct, plaintiff admits that she never missed a day of work
following the alleged incident, she continued to work at AIDC another
nineteen months (leaving only because of her husband’s job transfer),
she continued to go on a daily basis to the Governor’s Ofﬁce to deliver
items  and  never  asked  to  be  relieved  of  that  duty,  she  never  ﬁled  a
formal complaint or told her supervisors of the incident while at AIDC,
she never consulted a psychiatrist, psychologist, or incurred medical
bills as a result of the alleged incident, and she acknowledges that her
two  subsequent  contacts  with  the  Governor  involved  comments

made  “in  a  light  vein”  and  nonsexual  contact  that  was  done  in  a
“friendly  fashion.”  Further,  despite  earlier  claiming  that  she  suffered
marital discord and humiliation, plaintiff stated in her deposition that
she  was  not  claiming  damages  to  her  marriage  as  a  result  of  the
Governor’s  alleged  conduct.  .  .  .  Plaintiff’s  actions  and  statements  in
this  case  do  not  portray  someone  who  experienced  emotional
distress  so  severe  in  nature  that  no  reasonable  person  could  be
expected to endure it.

In  sum,  plaintiff’s  allegations  fall  far  short  of  the  rigorous
standards for establishing a claim of outrage under Arkansas law and
the  Court  therefore  grants  the  President’s  motion  for  summary
judgment on this claim.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Outrage  in  the  Context  of  Sexual  Harassment.   Courts  are
reluctant in many instances to recognize the application of the tort of
intentional  infliction  of  emotional  distress  when  they  believe  that
other  causes  of  action  have  already  been  fashioned  with  special
requirements.  To  recognize  this  new  tort  when  other  claims  are
unavailing might undermine the law in those other areas. The court in
Clinton  already  determined  that  the  plaintiff  did  not  have  a  good
cause  of  action  for  employment  discrimination.  How  might  this
impact  the  court’s  view  of  the  plaintiff’s  ability  to  state  a  claim  for
intentional infliction of emotional distress?

2. The  Rest  of  the  Story.   While  the  above  case  was  still  pending,
plaintiff’s  counsel  took  President  Clinton’s  deposition  and  inquired
about  other  alleged  sexual  affairs  involving  other  women.  He  was
asked,  famously,  whether  he  “ever  had  sexual  relations  with  Monica
Lewinsky . . . ?” President Clinton denied any such activities. When a
witness named Linda Tripp provided tangible evidence (in the form of
a  stained  blue  dress)  of  such  a  possible  relationship,  charges  of

perjury  were  drawn  up  and  this  led  to  the  House  of  Representatives
voting  to  impeach  the  President.  The  Republican-controlled  Senate
was never able to garner the required two-thirds votes to convict, with
only  45  senators  voting  guilty  on  the  charges.  Despite  the  dismissal
of  the  above  case  on  summary  judgment,  President  Clinton  later
agreed  to  a  monetary  payment  to  the  plaintiff  in  exchange  for  her
agreement  to  drop  her  possible  appeal  of  this  summary  judgment
order.  If  nothing  else,  the  Clinton  case  demonstrates  that  even
scandalous  activity  may  not  clear  the  high  hurdles  courts  have
established  for  maintaining  a  claim  for  intentional  infliction  of
emotional distress.

3. Problems.  Would the following plaintiffs appear to show severe

emotional distress in response to outrageous conduct?

A.  Plaintiff  screamed,  yelled  at  the  defendant,  and  went  home

fuming for most of the rest of the evening.

B.  Plaintiff’s  blood  pressure  became  elevated,  requiring  chronic

medication to keep it under control.

C.  Plaintiff  fell  to  the  ground  with  despair,  required  months  of

counseling, and still battles with insomnia.

3.30F New Jersey Model Civil Jury Charges

INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS

The  plaintiff  is  (also)  bringing  an  action  based  on
intentional infliction of emotional distress allegedly caused
by  the  defendant.  To  recover,  plaintiff  must  establish  the
following elements:

First,  the  plaintiff  must  prove  that  the  defendant  acted
intentionally or recklessly. For an intentional act to result in
liability,  the  defendant  must  intend  both  to  do  the  act  and

to produce emotional distress. For a reckless act to result
in liability, a defendant must act in deliberate disregard of a
high  degree  of  probability  that  emotional  distress  will
follow.

Second, the defendant’s conduct must be extreme and
in
outrageous.  The  conduct  must  be  so  outrageous
character  and  so  extreme  in  degree  as  to  go  beyond  all
possible  bounds  of  decency  and  to  be  regarded  as
atrocious  and  utterly  intolerable  in  a  civilized  community.
The  liability  clearly  does  not  extend  to  mere  insults,
indignities, threats, annoyances, petty oppressions or other
trivialities.

Third,  the  defendant’s  actions  must  have  been  the

cause of plaintiff’s emotional distress.

Fourth, the emotional distress suffered by plaintiff must
be so severe that no reasonable person could be expected
to  endure  such  distress.  Defendant’s  conduct  must  be
sufﬁciently  severe  to  cause  genuine  and  substantial
emotional distress or mental harm to the average person.
This average person must be one similarly situated to the
plaintiff. The plaintiff cannot recover for his/her emotional
distress  if  that  emotional  distress  would  not  have  been
experienced by an average person.

C. Constitutional Protection of Outrageous Speech

Where  a  claim  for  intentional  infliction  of  emotional  distress  relies
primarily  upon  a  form  of  speech  to  demonstrate  the  requisite
outrageous conduct, there arises the potential that a court’s entry of
a judgment for damages against the defendant could be viewed as an
unconstitutional restriction on free speech. In Chapter 12 we will see

courts having signiﬁcant concerns with the application of the law of
defamation  to  the  First  Amendment’s  protection  of  freedom  of
speech.  The  United  States  Supreme  Court  has  been  sensitive  to
balancing  a  state’s  legitimate  interest  in  providing  remedies  for
victims  of  torts,  while  not  permitting  such  civil  actions  to  unduly
infringe a citizen’s right to express even “outrageous” views. Consider
how the Supreme Court in the recent Snyder case has attempted to
strike this balance in the context of a claim for intentional infliction of
emotional distress against a church engaging in what many consider
to be highly offensive speech-based conduct.

SNYDER v. PHELPS
562 U.S. 443 (2011)

A  jury  held  members  of  the  Westboro  Baptist  Church  liable  for
millions  of  dollars  in  damages  for  picketing  near  a  soldier’s  funeral
service.  The  picket  signs  reflected  the  church’s  view  that  the  United
States is overly tolerant of sin and that God kills American soldiers as
punishment. The question presented is whether the First Amendment
shields the church members from tort liability for their speech in this
case.

in  America’s  military.  The

Fred  Phelps  founded  the  Westboro  Baptist  Church  in  Topeka,
Kansas,  in  1955.  The  church’s  congregation  believes  that  God  hates
and  punishes  the  United  States  for  its  tolerance  of  homosexuality,
frequently
particularly
communicates its views by picketing, often at military funerals. In the
more  than  20  years  that  the  members  of  Westboro  Baptist  have
publicized  their  message,  they  have  picketed  nearly  600  funerals.
Marine Lance Corporal Matthew Snyder was killed in Iraq in the line of
duty.  Lance  Corporal  Snyder’s  father  selected  the  Catholic  church  in
the Snyders’ hometown of Westminster, Maryland, as the site for his

church

son’s  funeral.  Local  newspapers  provided  notice  of  the  time  and
location of the service.

Phelps became aware of Matthew Snyder’s funeral and decided to
travel to Maryland with six other Westboro Baptist parishioners (two
of his daughters and four of his grandchildren) to picket. On the day
of  the  memorial  service,  the  Westboro  congregation  members
picketed on public land adjacent to public streets near the Maryland
State  House,  the  United  States  Naval  Academy,  and  Matthew
Snyder’s  funeral.  The  Westboro  picketers  carried  signs  that  were
largely the same at all three locations. They stated, for instance: “God
Hates the USA/Thank God for 9/11,” “America is Doomed,” “Don’t Pray
for  the  USA,”  “Thank  God  for  IEDs,”  “Thank  God  for  Dead  Soldiers,”
“Pope in Hell,” “Priests Rape Boys,” “God Hates Fags,” “You’re Going to
Hell,” and “God Hates You.”

The church had notiﬁed the authorities in advance of its intent to
picket  at  the  time  of  the  funeral,  and  the  picketers  complied  with

police instructions in staging their demonstration. The picketing took
place  within  a  10-by-25-foot  plot  of  public  land  adjacent  to  a  public
street, behind a temporary fence. That plot was approximately 1,000
feet  from  the  church  where  the  funeral  was  held.  Several  buildings
separated  the  picket  site  from  the  church.  The  Westboro  picketers
displayed  their  signs  for  about  30  minutes  before  the  funeral  began
and  sang  hymns  and  recited  Bible  verses.  None  of  the  picketers
entered church property or went to the cemetery. They did not yell or
use  profanity,  and  there  was  no  violence  associated  with  the
picketing.

The funeral procession passed within 200 to 300 feet of the picket
site. Although Snyder testiﬁed that he could see the tops of the picket
signs as he drove to the funeral, he did not see what was written on
the  signs  until  later  that  night,  while  watching  a  news  broadcast
covering the event.

Snyder  ﬁled  suit  against  Phelps,  Phelps’s  daughters,  and  the
Westboro Baptist Church (collectively Westboro or the church) in the
United  States  District  Court  for  the  District  of  Maryland  under  that
court’s diversity jurisdiction. Snyder alleged . . . intentional infliction of
emotional  distress.  Westboro  moved
judgment
contending,  in  part,  that  the  church’s  speech  was  insulated  from
liability by the First Amendment.

for  summary

To  succeed  on  a  claim  for  intentional  infliction  of  emotional
distress in Maryland, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant
intentionally  or  recklessly  engaged
in  extreme  and  outrageous
conduct that caused the plaintiff to suffer severe emotional distress.
See Harris v. Jones, 380 A.2d 611, 614 (Md. 1977). The Free Speech
Clause  of
the  First  Amendment — “Congress  shall  make  no
law . . . abridging the freedom of speech” — can serve as a defense in
state  tort  suits,  including  suits  for  intentional  infliction  of  emotional
distress. See, e.g., Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, 485 U.S. 46, 50-
51 (1988).

Whether  the  First  Amendment  prohibits  holding  Westboro  liable
for its speech in this case turns largely on whether that speech is of
public or private concern, as determined by all the circumstances of
the case. “[S]peech on ‘matters of public concern’ . . . is ‘at the heart of
the  First  Amendment’s  protection.’”  Dun  &  Bradstreet,  Inc.  v.
Greenmoss  Builders,  Inc.,  472  U.S.  749,  758-759  (1985)  (opinion  of
Powell,  J.).  The  First  Amendment  reflects  “a  profound  national
commitment  to  the  principle  that  debate  on  public  issues  should  be
uninhibited,  robust,  and  wide-open.”  New York Times  Co. v. Sullivan,
376 U.S. 254, 270 (1964). That is because “speech concerning public
affairs  is  more  than  self-expression;  it  is  the  essence  of  self-
government.”  Garrison  v.  Louisiana,  379  U.S.  64,  74-75  (1964).
Accordingly,  “speech  on  public  issues  occupies  the  highest  rung  of
the  hierarchy  of  First  Amendment  values,  and  is  entitled  to  special
protection.” Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138 (1983). “[N]ot all speech is
of  equal  First  Amendment  importance,”  however,  and  where  matters
of  purely  private  signiﬁcance  are  at
issue,  First  Amendment
protections are often less rigorous. Hustler, supra, at 56.

We  noted  a  short  time  ago,  in  considering  whether  public
employee  speech  addressed  a  matter  of  public  concern,  that  “the
boundaries of the public concern test are not well deﬁned.” San Diego
v.  Roe,  543  U.S.  77,  83  (2004)  (per  curiam).  Although  that  remains
true  today,  we  have  articulated  some  guiding  principles,  principles
that  accord  broad  protection  to  speech  to  ensure  that  courts
themselves do not become inadvertent censors.

Speech deals with matters of public concern when it can “be fairly
considered  as  relating  to  any  matter  of  political,  social,  or  other
concern  to  the  community,”  Connick, supra,  at  146,  or  when  it  “is  a
subject  of  legitimate  news  interest;  that  is,  a  subject  of  general
interest and of value and concern to the public,” San Diego, supra, at
83-84.  The  arguably  “inappropriate  or  controversial  character  of  a
statement is irrelevant to the question whether it deals with a matter
of public concern.” Rankin v. McPherson, 483 U.S. 378, 387 (1987).

Our  opinion

“Congress shall make no
law . . . abridging the freedom of
speech.”

in  Dun  &
Bradstreet,  on  the  other  hand,
provides an example of speech
of only private concern. In that
case  we  held,  as  a  general
matter,  that  information  about
a  particular  individual’s  credit
“concerns  no  public
report
issue.” 472 U.S., at 762. The content of the report, we explained, “was
speech solely in the individual interest of the speaker and its speciﬁc
business  audience.”  Ibid.  That  was  conﬁrmed  by  the  fact  that  the
particular  report  was  sent  to  only  ﬁve  subscribers  to  the  reporting
service, who were bound not to disseminate it further. Ibid.

First Amendment

Deciding  whether  speech  is  of  public  or  private  concern  requires
us  to  examine  the  “content,  form,  and  context”  of  that  speech,  “as
revealed by the whole record.” Dun & Bradstreet, supra, at 761. As in
other  First  Amendment  cases,  the  court  is  obligated  “to  ‘make  an
independent  examination  of  the  whole  record’  in  order  to  make  sure
that  ‘the  judgment  does  not  constitute  a  forbidden  intrusion  on  the
ﬁeld  of  free  expression.’”  Bose  Corp.  v.  Consumers  Union  of  United
States, Inc., 466 U.S. 485, 499.

The  “content”  of  Westboro’s  signs  plainly  relates  to  broad  issues
of  interest  to  society  at  large,  rather  than  matters  of  “purely  private
concern.”  Dun  &  Bradstreet,  supra,  at  759,  105  S.Ct.  2939.  The
placards  read  “God  Hates  the  USA/Thank  God  for  9/11,”  “America  is
Doomed,” “Don’t Pray for the USA,” “Thank God for IEDs,” “Fag Troops,”
“Semper Fi Fags,” “God Hates Fags,” “Maryland Taliban,” “Fags Doom
Nations,”  “Not  Blessed  Just  Cursed,”  “Thank  God  for  Dead  Soldiers,”
“Pope  in  Hell,”  “Priests  Rape  Boys,”  “You’re  Going  to  Hell,”  and  “God
Hates You.” While these messages may fall short of reﬁned social or
political  commentary,  the  issues  they  highlight — the  political  and
moral  conduct  of  the  United  States  and  its  citizens,  the  fate  of  our
Nation,  homosexuality  in  the  military,  and  scandals  involving  the

Catholic  clergy — are  matters  of  public  import.  The  signs  certainly
convey  Westboro’s  position  on  those  issues,  in  a  manner  designed,
unlike  the  private  speech  in  Dun  &  Bradstreet,  to  reach  as  broad  a
public audience as possible. And even if a few of the signs — such as
“You’re  Going  to  Hell”  and  “God  Hates  You” — were  viewed  as
containing  messages  related  to  Matthew  Snyder  or  the  Snyders
speciﬁcally, that would not change the fact that the overall thrust and
dominant  theme  of  Westboro’s  demonstration  spoke  to  broader
public issues.

Apart from the content of Westboro’s signs, Snyder contends that
the “context” of the speech — its connection with his son’s funeral —
makes the speech a matter of private rather than public concern. The
fact  that  Westboro  spoke  in  connection  with  a  funeral,  however,
cannot  by
itself  transform  the  nature  of  Westboro’s  speech.
Westboro’s  signs,  displayed  on  public  land  next  to  a  public  street,
reflect  the  fact  that  the  church  ﬁnds  much  to  condemn  in  modern
society. Its speech is “fairly characterized as constituting speech on a
matter  of  public  concern,” Connick,  461  U.S.,  at  146,  and  the  funeral
setting does not alter that conclusion.

Westboro  believes  that  America

is  morally  flawed;  many
Americans  might  feel  the  same  about  Westboro.  Westboro’s  funeral
picketing  is  certainly  hurtful  and  its  contribution  to  public  discourse
may be negligible. But Westboro addressed matters of public import
on  public  property,  in  a  peaceful  manner,  in  full  compliance  with  the
guidance  of  local  ofﬁcials.  The  speech  was  indeed  planned  to
coincide with Matthew Snyder’s funeral, but did not itself disrupt that
funeral,  and  Westboro’s  choice  to  conduct  its  picketing  at  that  time
and place did not alter the nature of its speech.

Speech  is  powerful.  It  can  stir  people  to  action,  move  them  to
tears of both joy and sorrow, and — as it did here — inflict great pain.
On the facts before us, we cannot react to that pain by punishing the
speaker. As a Nation we have chosen a different course — to protect
even  hurtful  speech  on  public  issues  to  ensure  that  we  do  not  stifle

public debate. That choice requires that we shield Westboro from tort
liability for its picketing in this case.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. First  Amendment  Defense  to  Tort  Claims.   In  Snyder,  the  court
law  tort  claim  that  relied  upon  the
indicated  that  any  state
ideas  might  be  subject  to  a  First
defendant’s  expression  of
Amendment  defense,  at  least  where  the  defendant  was  engaged  in
“public  speech.”  We  will  encounter  signiﬁcant  First  Amendment
defenses in Chapter 12 when we cover the law of defamation, which
has  been  changed  signiﬁcantly  by  substantial  First  Amendment
jurisprudence.

2.  Public  vs.  Private  Speech.   Utilizing  the  Supreme  Court’s  test
from Snyder for distinguishing public and private speech, what facts
were helpful to the defendants in establishing their First Amendment
defense?  What  facts,  if  changed,  might  result  in  the  opposite
conclusion — that the speech was private and unprotected?

3.  Westboro  Finds  Opposition  Online.   “Hacktivist”  organizations
targeted the Westboro Baptist Church in December 2012 after church
members  threatened  to  picket  the  funerals  of  Newtown  shooting
victims.  These  hacktivist  groups  brought  down  the  WBC  website  in
conjuction with “#OpWestBor,” took over Fred Phelps’ Twitter account,
and used it to distribute a petition to name the WBC as a hate group.
Free speech can work both directions.

Upon Further Review

Other  intentional  tort  claims  we  have  studied  are  designed  to
protect people’s mental and emotional states. The tort of assault
is complete, so the courts say, upon the “touching of the mind.”

The  tort  of  false  imprisonment  fundamentally  is  designed  to
protect our sense of personal freedom to move. Signiﬁcant harm
may occur without any physical injury with such a claim. Even a
battery  cause  of  action  will  often  provide  for  recovery  of
emotional  distress  or  pain  and  suffering  damages.  But
intentional  infliction  of  emotional  distress  is  a  unique  tort
because  its  primary  focus  is  upon  emotional  and  mental
tranquility upset by a potentially inﬁnite variety of different types
of outrageous conduct. In this sense it is the broadest applicable
claim designed primarily to protect our mental peace. Though it
is  so  broad  and  flexible,  rigorous  prerequisites  have  been
established  before  it  will  arise:  (1)  mere  carelessness  will  not
sufﬁce, as the defendant must either intend or be reckless about
causing emotional distress; (2) perhaps the highest hurdle is the
requirement  that  the  defendant’s  conduct  in  bringing  about  the
distress  be  labeled  “outrageous”  or  “utterly  intolerable  in  a
civilized  society”;  and  (3)  the  requirement  that  the  plaintiff’s
emotional  distress  be  “severe”;  that  is,  qualitatively  greater  than
anyone  should  have  to  endure,  and  long-lasting  rather  than
fleeting.

Pulling It All Together

Sara  and  Dennis  are  fellow  ﬁrst-year  law  students  and  bitter
academic  rivals.  Each  one  believes  that  they  are  the  smarter,

more  promising  lawyer  than  the  other.  One  day  in  class  while
Sara is on her feet being questioned by the professor about the
Palsgraf case, Dennis starts blurting out the correct answers to
the professor’s questions when Sara hesitates — Sara is horribly
embarrassed by this conduct, feeling humiliated by what Dennis
has  done  in  front  of  her  fellow  students.  (As  it  turns  out,  she
cried the entire way home.) As she leaves the room, she puts her
hand on Dennis’ shoulder and says “you’ll wish you never did this
to me!”

That night, Dennis thinks about Sara’s statement and decides
that  he  should  do  something  else  to  interrupt  Sara’s  obsessive
outlining of Torts. He plans to park near her house in the middle
of  the  night  and  start  honking  his  horn  to  wake  her  up,  hoping
she will be too tired the next day to do any outlining. Shortly after
midnight, Dennis pulls up in his car and parks in the driveway of
a  house  owned  by  Carlos,  who  lives  directly  across  the  street
from  Sara  (Dennis  thought  he  was  in  Sara’s  driveway,  but  was
confused  about  Sara’s  address).  After  about  30  seconds  of
Dennis  honking  his  horn,  Carlos  becomes  outraged  at  the
incessant honking, and, to make Dennis stop and leave, ﬁres his
shotgun toward Dennis, who is seated inside his car. Some shots
from the gun impact the car, but miss Dennis. Other shots from
the  shotgun  go  past  the  car,  across  the  street,  and  into  Sara’s
living room window and her bedroom window. One of the shots
demolished  her  new  high  deﬁnition  television.  Another  shot  hit
Sara  in  her  leg  causing  signiﬁcant  medical  injuries.  She  tries  to
get up out of bed but is unable to do so because of her injuries.
She  is  forced  to  remain  in  bed  until  the  next  day  when  her
housekeeper arrives inside her home and discovers Sara lying in
bed  hurt.  Dennis  subsequently  scores  the  highest  grade  on  the
Torts exam.

that, in essence, acknowledges
that  the  plaintiff’s  interest  in
each  of  these  intentional  torts
involves the autonomy to make
certain  decisions  regarding  his

After  all,  how  can  you  characterize  the

of  autonomy  over  one’s  own  body,  peace  of  mind,  and  property
sometimes  permits  that  person  to  engage  in  defensive  conduct
directed  at  the  plaintiff  in  order  to  protect  his  own  interests,  or  even

defenses of self-defense, defense of others, and defense of property.

interests  of  others

Because  these  defenses  are  generally  considered  to  be  in  the
nature of affirmative defenses, the burden in these areas is upon the
defendant  to  plead  and  prove  such  defenses  by  a  preponderance  of
the  evidence.  This  is  a  departure  from  the  elements  of  a  cause  of
action, which the plaintiff must plead and prove.

II  CONSENT

One  of  the  fundamental  questions  when  a  defendant  has  raised  the
defense  of  consent  is  how  to  determine  when  consent  has  been
given.  What  form  must  it  take  and  how  do  courts  determine  its
validity? Further, must the plaintiff actually consent to the infliction of
the  harm  suffered  or  is  something  less  than  that  sufﬁcient?  The
McQuiggan case illustrates some of the fundamentals regarding the
defense of consent.

A. Standard and Effect

McQUIGGAN v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA
536 A.2d 137 (Md. Ct. App. 1988)

       , J.

The  main  question  presented  in  this  case  is  whether  a  twelve-
year-old  boy  should  be  barred  from  recovery  for  an  eye  injury  he
sustained  when  he  voluntarily  participated  in  a  paper  clip  shooting
“game.”

Nicholas  Alexander  McQuiggan,  by  and  through  his  guardian,
Jerome  Keith  Bradford,  brought  an  action  in  tort  against  the  Boy
Scouts  of  America  (BSA),  Billy  Hamm  and  Kevin  McDonnell,  fellow
Boy  Scouts.  Nicholas  alleged  that  [BSA  was  liable  for  the  negligent
supervision by its scoutmasters and that] the minor defendants, Billy
and Kevin, are liable for assault and battery.

The  trial  was  held  in  the  Circuit  Court  for  Montgomery  County
where,  at  the  conclusion  of  Nicholas’s  case,  the  court  granted  a
motion for judgment in favor of all the defendants. Aggrieved by the
trial court’s action, Nicholas has appealed to this Court.

The  events  giving  rise  to  this  litigation  date  from  April  8,  1981,
when  sometime  between  7:10  and  7:15  p.m.  Nicholas  was  dropped
off  by  his  mother  at  the  Epworth  Methodist  Church  in  Montgomery
County  to  attend  a  Boy  Scout  meeting.  The  meeting  was  scheduled
to start at 7:30 p.m. When Nicholas arrived, he noticed several of the
other  scouts  engaged  in  a  game  in  which  they  shot  paper  clips  at
each  other  from  rubber  bands  they  held  in  their  hands.  The  paper
clips were pulled apart on one end and squeezed closed on the other.
At trial, Nicholas demonstrated how the clip was shot by placing the
closed end of the clip in a rubber band stretched between two upright
ﬁngers  in  the  form  of  a  “v”  and  pulling  back  on  the  open  end  of  the
paper clip and releasing it. Nicholas testiﬁed that when he arrived at
the  church,  two  Assistant  Scoutmasters,  William  H.  Hamm  Sr.  and
Keith  D.  Rush,  were  present  in  the  meeting  room.  Another  Assistant
Scoutmaster, Edmund Copeland, arrived after Nicholas but before the
meeting actually started.

Upon  arriving  at  the  meeting  room,  Nicholas  sat  at  a  table  and
began to read his Boy Scout Handbook. Between four and eight other
scouts had been playing the paper clip shooting game and running in
and  out  of  the  hallway  leading  to  the  meeting  room  for  about  ten
minutes before Nicholas decided to join them. Prior to his joining the
game,  no  one  had  shot  paper  clips  at  him.  When  one  of  the  boys
asked  Nicholas  to  join  in  the  game,  he  did  so  freely,  feeling  no
pressure to participate. Nicholas further related that he knew that the
object of the game was to shoot paper clips; he knew that paper clips
would be shot at him; he knew that there was a chance he would be
hit with a paper clip.

When  he  decided  to  join  in  the  game,  Nicholas  looked  through
some  material  on  a  shelf,  and  he  located  an  elastic  hair  band  with
which  he  intended  “to  chase”  the  other  boys.  Nicholas  and  an
unidentiﬁed  Boy  Scout  then  chased  Billy  Hamm  Jr.  and  Kevin
McDonnell  up  the  hallway.  Nicholas  said  he  had  no  paper  clips,  but
the boy with him was shooting them. Nicholas admitted at trial that

his actions were such as to lead Kevin or Billy to believe that he had a
paper  clip  in  his  possession.  Nicholas  further  narrated  that  he  was
actively “participating” in the game.

After  Nicholas  had  chased  Billy  and  Kevin  down  the  hallway  for
about ten feet, the two boys turned around and chased Nicholas back
down  the  hall.  Nicholas  said  that  he  dropped  the  hair  band  and
entered the meeting room. He then stopped running, “split apart” from
the  unidentiﬁed  boy,  and  started  to  walk  toward  a  table.  He  told  the
court  that  at  that  point  he  “stopped  playing,”  but  he  did  not
communicate  that  fact  in  any  way  to  the  other  boys.  Approximately
ﬁve  seconds  later  and  ﬁve  feet  into  the  meeting  room,  Nicholas  felt
something  in  his  right  eye.  When  he  brushed  the  eye,  a  paper  clip
dropped to the floor. According to Nicholas, his entire involvement in
the game consumed approximately thirty seconds.

The trial judge [held] that Nicholas could not prevail on his assault
and battery counts because by his actions “not only in participating in
the  game  but  pursuing  .  .  .  Billy  Hamm  [and  Kevin  McDonnell]  down
the hallway . . . as a matter of law he consented to the infliction of the
injury upon him.” We agree.

A  battery  consists  of  the  unpermitted  application  of  trauma  by
one person upon the body of another person. The gist of the action is
the  absence  of  consent  to  the  contact  on  plaintiff’s  part.  When  a
plaintiff  “manifests  a  willingness  that  the  defendant  engage  in
conduct and the defendant acts in response to such a manifestation,
his  consent  negatives  the  wrongful  element  of  the  defendant’s  act,
and prevents the existence of a tort.” Prosser, § 18.

The  circumstances  leading  to  Nicholas’s  injury  do  not  constitute

an assault and battery. As stated in Prosser:

One  who  enters  into  a  sport,  game  or  contest  may  be  taken  to  consent  to
physical contacts consistent with the understood rules of the game. It is only
when notice is given that all such conduct will no longer be tolerated that the
defendant is no longer free to assume consent. (Emphasis supplied.)

Id.  Nicholas’  willful  joining  in  the  game,  without  any  notice  of  his
withdrawal from participation, bars recovery from either Billy or Kevin.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Afﬁrmative Defenses and Elements.  You may recall that courts
often  state  that  a  battery  involves  the  defendant  engaging  in
intentional,  unpermitted  harmful  or  offensive  contacts.  Such  a
statement suggests that the plaintiff must prove the lack of consent
as part of the elements of the cause of action. In reality, most courts
indicate  that  consent — or  permission  for  the  contact — is  an
afﬁrmative defense. Afﬁrmative defenses must be pled and proved by
the defendant, or else they are waived under the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure. This means that rather than require the plaintiff to prove a
negative,
to  prove  by  a
preponderance  of  the  evidence  that  plaintiff  consented  to  the
contact.

the  defendant  has

the  obligation

2.  Express  and  Implied  Consent.   While  certain  instances  may
involve  express  consent  (“of  course  you  may  kiss  me”)  more  often
consent  is  implied  by  the  plaintiff’s  conduct  amid  the  parties’
circumstances.  When  the  McQuiggan  court  references  the  fact  that
individuals may “manifest a willingness that the defendant engage in
conduct,”  this  refers  to  both  express  and  implicit  manifestations.
Which  type  of  consent  did  the  plaintiff  in  McQuiggan  manifest  and
how?  In  cases  of  doubt,  courts  typically  look  to  see  if  the  plaintiff’s
words or conduct led the defendant to have a “reasonable belief” that
permission was given to engage in the conduct or make the contact.
Because  a  plaintiff  can  both  give  and  withdraw  consent  the  same
way,  the  same  test — “reasonable  belief” — is  the  standard  for  both
giving  and  withdrawing  consent.  Prof.  Prosser  has  offered  the
following observations concerning implied consent:

In  a  crowded  world,  a  certain  amount  of  personal  contact  is
inevitable  and  must  be  accepted.  Absent  expression  to  the
contrary, consent is assumed to all those ordinary contacts which
are  customary  and  reasonably  necessary  to  the  common
intercourse  of  life,  such  as  a  tap  on  the  shoulder  to  attract
attention, a friendly grasp of the arm, or a casual jostling to make
a passage.

Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts, §8. The Restatement (Third)
of  Torts  outlines  these  concepts  of  express  and  implied  consent  as
follows:

(1) Consent is willingness in fact for conduct to occur. It may
inaction  and  need  not  be

be  manifested  by  action  or
communicated to the actor.

(2) If words or conduct are reasonably understood by another
to be intended as consent, they constitute apparent consent and
are as effective as consent in fact.

Restatement (Third) of Torts §892 (2011).

3. Consent to Contact Rather Than Injury.  The court in McQuiggan
found only that the plaintiff had consented to participate in the game,
and that the commonly understood rules of the game involved being
hit with a paper clip. Because the contact that the defendants caused
involved  exactly  this  type  of  contact,  the  defense  of  consent
prevailed.  But  note  that  the  court  did  not  ﬁnd  that  the  plaintiff
consented  to  the  particular  devastating  eye  injury.  The  fact  that  the
consent to contact results in a certain injury, even one not foreseen,
does not invalidate the consent otherwise properly given. Rather than
his eye being hurt by a flying paper clip, what if one of the other boys
had grabbed a chair and hit the plaintiff over the head with it? Unless
the boys’ game of paper clip frenzy typically involved such escalation,
there would clearly be no consent in this scenario.

4.  Causation.   Another  potential  stumbling  block  faced  by  the
plaintiff  in McQuiggan,  beyond  the  defense  of  consent,  was  proving
which of the two other boys playing the game actually shot him in the
eye. He sued both because apparently it was unclear which boy shot
the paper clip. He was only hit with one clip, which could have come
from  only  one  of  the  two  other  boys.  In  Chapter  5  we  will  look  into
various tort doctrines designed to come to the aid of a plaintiff unable
to  prove  causation  in  just  such  an  instance.  We  will  explore  the
doctrine,  in  particular,  of  alternative  liability  when  we  confront  a
hunter shot in the eye while on a hunting trip with two friends.

5.  Application  to  Other  Intentional  Torts.   While  many  cases
involving consent arise in the context of battery claims, courts apply
the defense to any intentional tort. One might be taken to consent, for
example, to being assaulted by purchasing admission to a Halloween
ghost  house.  An  invitation  to  a  colleague  at  work  to  come  over  for
dinner  obviously  provides  consent  for  the  colleague  to  enter  upon
your land at the appointed time and date.

6. Consent vs. Assumption of the Risk.  In Chapter 7 we will delve
into  the  doctrine  of  express  assumption  of  the  risk — where  one  by
contract  expressly  releases  (in  advance)  a  negligence  claim  against
another and instead assumes the risk of incurring such injuries. This
seems  closely  connected  to  consent  but  consent  is  limited  to
intentional  torts  and  most  courts  likewise  limit  express  assumption
of the risk to accidental torts.

7. Problems.  Is there consent in the following instances?
A.  Two  boys  agree  to  meet  at  a  swing  near  their  homes  at  an
appointed  hour  to  engage  in  a  ﬁstﬁght.  One  boy  is  punched  in
the  eye  near  the  end  of  the  ﬁght  and  sustained  a  serious  eye
injury.

B. A man stands in the path of another and says, “I’m not moving.
If you want to proceed further, you’ll have to try to push me out

of the way.” The other immediately shoves the man to the side,
causing the man to fall down and fracture his hip.

C. A boy and a girl are dancing when the boy asks for permission to
kiss the girl. She closes her eyes and smiles and he kisses her.
D. A grandmother living in a rough neighborhood decides she is not
going  to  be  deterred  by  the  gang  violence  and  walks  on  the
sidewalk  toward  the  grocery  store,  right  through  the  middle  of
the assembled thugs. One of them trips her, causing her to fall
and break her wrist.

E.  A  woman  is  driving  down  a  rural  farm-to-market  road  on  her
tractor  and  wants  to  take  a  shortcut  to  a  portion  of  her  own
property  by  cutting  through  a  corner  of  a  neighbor’s  vacant
property.  She  calls  the  neighbor  on  her  cell  phone  as  she  is
approaching the neighbor’s property. In response to her inquiry,
the  neighbor  is  silent  but  makes  a  sweeping  gesture  with  his
arm, appearing to acquiesce to her request. In fact, he does not
want the woman to do so, but she proceeds anyway.

F.  Jethro  asks  a  neighbor,  Jed,  who  owns  a  “cement  pond,”  for
permission for any of the neighbors to use Jed’s pool during the
upcoming  Fourth  of  July  holiday.  Jed  readily  agrees.  On  the
Fourth  of  July,  without  knowledge  of  Jed’s  consent  to  Jethro,
another neighbor, named Elly May, sees the swimming activities,
comes over, and plunges into the pool as well.

B. Limitations on Consent

1. Exceeding the Scope

KOFFMAN v. GARNETT
574 S.E.2d 258 (Va. 2003)

    , J.

In  this  case  we  consider  whether  the  trial  court  properly

dismissed the plaintiffs’ [claims for] assault and battery.

In  the  fall  of  2000,  Andrew  W.  Koffman,  a  13-year-old  middle
school  student  at  a  public  school  in  Botetourt  County,  began
participating on the school’s football team. It was Andy’s ﬁrst season
playing  organized  football,  and  he  was  positioned  as  a  third-string
defensive  player.  James  Garnett  was  employed  by  the  Botetourt
County School Board as an assistant coach for the football team and
was  responsible  for  the  supervision,  training,  and  instruction  of  the
team’s defensive players.

The team lost its ﬁrst game of the season. Garnett was upset by
the defensive players’ inadequate tackling in that game and became
further  displeased  by  what  he  perceived  as  inadequate  tackling
during the ﬁrst practice following the loss.

Garnett  ordered  Andy  to  hold  a  football  and  “stand  upright  and
motionless”  so  that  Garnett  could  explain  the  proper  tackling
technique  to  the  defensive  players.  Then  Garnett,  without  further
warning, thrust his arms around Andy’s body, lifted him “off his feet by
two  feet  or  more,”  and  “slammed”  him  to  the  ground.  Andy  weighed
144  pounds,  while  Garnett  weighed  approximately  260  pounds.  The
force of the tackle broke the humerus bone in Andy’s left arm. During
prior practices, no coach had used physical force to instruct players
on rules or techniques of playing football.

In [their pleading the Koffmans] alleged that Andy was injured as a
result of Garnett’s intentional acts of assault and battery. Garnett ﬁled
a demur, asserting that the [pleading] did not allege sufﬁcient facts to
support  a  lack  of  consent  to  the  tackling  demonstration  and,
therefore,  did  not  plead  causes  of  action  for  assault  or  battery.  The
trial  court  dismissed  the  action,  ﬁnding  that  the  facts  alleged  were
insufﬁcient  to  state  [claims  for]  assault  or  battery  because  the
instruction  and  playing  of  football  are  “inherently  dangerous  and

always  potentially  violent.”  In  this  appeal,  the  Koffmans  assert  that
they  pled  sufﬁcient  facts  to  sustain  their  claims  of  assault  and
battery.

The trial court held that the [plaintiffs’ complaint] was insufﬁcient
as  a  matter  of  law  to  establish  causes  of  action  for  the  torts  of
assault  and  battery.  We  begin  by  identifying  the  elements  of  these
two independent torts. The tort of assault consists of an act intended
to  cause  apprehension  of  [a  harmful  or  offensive]  contact,  and  that
creates in that other person’s mind a reasonable apprehension of an
imminent battery. The tort of battery is an unwanted touching which
is  neither  consented  to,  excused,  nor  justiﬁed.  Although  these  two
torts “go together like ham and eggs,” the difference between them is
“that between physical contact and the mere apprehension of it. One
may exist without the other.” Prosser and Keeton on Torts §10 at 46.

The Koffmans’ [pleading] does not include an allegation that Andy
had  any  apprehension  of  an  immediate  battery.  This  allegation
cannot  be  supplied  by  inference  because  any  inference  of  Andy’s
apprehension  is  discredited  by  the  afﬁrmative  allegations  that  Andy
had  no  warning  of  an  imminent  forceful  tackle  by  Garnett.  The
Koffmans argue that a reasonable inference of apprehension can be
found  “in  the  very  short  period  of  time  that  it  took  the  coach  to  lift
Andy into the air and throw him violently to the ground.” At this point,
however,  the  battery  alleged  by  the  Koffmans  was  in  progress.
Accordingly, we ﬁnd that the pleadings were insufﬁcient as a matter
of law to establish a cause of action for civil assault.

The  [Koffmans’  pleading]  is  sufﬁcient,  however,  to  establish  a
cause of action for the tort of battery. The Koffmans pled that Andy
consented  to  physical  contact  with  players  “of
like  age  and
experience”  and  that  neither  Andy  nor  his  parents  expected  or
consented  to  his  “participation  in  aggressive  contact  tackling  by  the
adult coaches.” Further, the Koffmans pled that, in the past, coaches
had  not  tackled  players  as  a  method  of  instruction.  Garnett  asserts

that, by consenting to play football, Andy consented to be tackled, by
either other football players or by the coaches.

Whether  Andy  consented  to  be  tackled  by  Garnett  in  the  manner
alleged  was  a  matter  of  fact.  Based  on  the  [Koffmans’  allegations],
reasonable  persons  could  disagree  on  whether  Andy  gave  such
consent.  Thus,  we  ﬁnd  that  the  trial  court  erred  in  holding  that  the
Koffmans’ [pleading] was insufﬁcient as a matter of law to establish a
claim for battery.

DISSENT

Justice       , concurring in part and dissenting in part.

I [disagree] with the majority opinion [on] the issue of consent as it
pertains to the intentional tort of battery. The thrust of the plaintiffs’
allegations  is  that  they  did  not  consent  to  “Andy’s  participation  in
aggressive  contact  tackling  by  the  adult  coaches”  but  that  they
consented  only  to  Andy’s  engaging  “in  a  contact  sport  with  other
children of like age and experience.”

It  is  notable,  in  my  opinion,  that  the  plaintiffs  admitted  in  their
pleading that Andy’s coach was “responsible . . . for the supervision,
training  and  instruction  of  the  defensive  players.”  It  cannot  be
disputed that one responsibility of a football coach is to minimize the
possibility  that  players  will  sustain  “something  more  than  slight
injury”  while  playing  the  sport.  A  football  coach  cannot  be  expected
“to extract from the game the body clashes that cause bruises, jolts
and hard falls.” Instead, a coach should ensure that players are able to
“withstand  the  shocks,  blows  and  other  rough  treatment  with  which
they would meet in actual play” by making certain that players are in
“sound  physical  condition,”  are  issued  proper  protective  equipment,
and are “taught and shown how to handle [themselves] while in play.”
The  instruction  on  how  to  handle  themselves  during  a  game  should
include  demonstrations  of  proper  tackling  techniques.  By  voluntarily
participating in football, Andy and his parents necessarily consented

to  instruction  by  the  coach  on  such  techniques.  The  alleged  battery
occurred during that instruction.

Additionally,  the  plaintiffs  did  not  allege  that  the  tackle  itself
violated any rule or usage of the sport of football. Nor did they plead
that Andy could not have been tackled by a larger, physically stronger,
and  more  experienced  player  either  during  a  game  or  practice.
Tackling and instruction on proper tackling techniques are aspects of
the  sport  of  football  to  which  a  player  consents  when  making  a
decision to participate in the sport.

In  sum,  I  conclude  that  the  plaintiffs  did  not  sufﬁciently  plead  a
claim for battery. We must remember that acts that might give rise to
a battery on a city street will not do so in the context of the sport of
football.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Rules  of  the  Game.   The  dissenting  judge  had  a  difference  of
opinion  from  the  majority  as  to  whether  the  coach’s  conduct  was  a
part  of  the  understood  activity  in  which  the  plaintiff  had  agreed  to
participate. The dissent argues that, because the plaintiff could have
been  hurt  by  a  large  player  by  being  tackled  either  in  practice  or  a
game,  his  consent  was  broad  enough  to  cover  the  coach’s  conduct.
Do  you  see  the  difference,  though,  between  consenting  to  other
teenage  players  hitting  you,  and  consenting  to  a  large  adult  coach
tackling you? A number of courts have distinguished between normal,
though harmful, contacts that occur in certain sports and intentional
efforts to harm a competitor in a way that violates a rule designed to
protect  player  safety.  See  e.g.,  Overall  v.  Kadella,  361  N.W.2d  352
(Mich. App. Ct. 1984)(discussing results of various claims for battery
made  by  sports  competitors,  afﬁrming  judgment  for  plaintiff  for
battery  after  being  hit  by  a  competitor  after  the  conclusion  of  a
hockey game).

2. Problems.   Do  you  believe  that  consent  destroys  the  following

battery claims?

A. After the Koffman case, the same coach from Virginia continues
tackling  players  on  his  team  in  order  to  demonstrate  proper
tackling techniques. One of these student athletes gets hurt. Is
this  student  in  any  worse  position  than  the  plaintiff  in Koffman
to sue for battery?

B. A defensive lineman in a football game commits a late hit on a
quarterback  and  dislocates  the  quarterback’s  collarbone.  He
draws a 15-yard penalty for the late hit.

C.  Another  defensive  lineman,  after  the  whistle  blows  the  play
dead, intentionally stomps on the face of the downed offensive
player, breaking his nose.

2. Fraud

HOGAN v. TAVZEL

660 So. 2d 350 (Fl. Dist. Ct. App. 1995)

     , W., J.

Hogan  appeals  from  a  Final  Judgment  which  dismissed  her
second  amended  complaint  with  prejudice.  She  sued  her  former
husband, Tavzel, for negligence, battery, fraudulent concealment, and
the  intentional  infliction  of  emotional  distress.  The  substance  of  her
complaint  was  that  in  1989-90,  through  consensual  sex,  Tavzel
infected her with genital warts (condylomhea acuminata) at a time he
knew  of  his  disease,  but  she  did  not,  and  she  was  not  warned.  The
trial court held . . . that there is no tort of battery for consensual sex
which  results  in  the  transmission  of  a  sexually  transmitted  disease.
We reverse.

Hogan and Tavzel were married for ﬁfteen years but encountered
marital problems which caused them to separate. During a period of
attempted reconciliation between October of 1989 and January 1990,
Tavzel  infected  Hogan  with  genital  warts.  He  knew  of  his  condition
but failed to warn Hogan or take any precaution against infecting her.
The parties were divorced on May 8, 1990. Hogan brought this suit in
1993.  The  trial  court  .  .  .  dismissed  the  battery  count  because  he
found that consensual sexual intercourse fails as a matter of law to
establish the element of unconsented to touching which is required to
sustain the tort of battery. The trial judge noted that Florida law has
not,  as  yet,  recognized  a  cause  of  action  for  battery  due  to  the
transmission of a sexually communicable disease. With regard to this
issue, we agree this is a case of ﬁrst impression in this state.

We . . . turn our attention to dismissal of the battery count. Since
this is a case of ﬁrst impression in Florida, it is appropriate to look to
other  jurisdictions  for  guidance.  A  case  similar  to  the  one  presented
here  is  Kathleen  K.  v.  Robert  B.,  150  Cal.  App.  3d  992  (Cal.  2d  Dist.
1984).  There,  a  cause  of  action  in  battery  was  approved  when  one
partner  contracted  genital  herpes  from  the  other  partner.  The  facts

indicated that the infecting partner had represented he was free from
any  sexually  infectious  disease,  and  the  infected  partner  would  not
have engaged in sexual relations if she had been aware of the risk of
infection.  The  court  held  that  one  party’s  consent  to  sexual
intercourse is vitiated by the partner’s fraudulent concealment of the
risk  of  infection  with  venereal  disease  (whether  or  not  the  partners
are  married  to  each  other).  This  is  not  a  new  theory.  See,  De  Vall  v.
Strunk,  96  S.W.2d  245  (Tx.  App.  1936);  Crowell  v.  Crowell,  105  S.E.
206 (1920).

The Kathleen K. court recognized that:

[a] certain amount of trust and conﬁdence exists in any intimate relationship, at
least to the extent that one sexual partner represents to the other that he or she
is free from venereal or other dangerous contagious disease.

Kathleen K. at 150 Cal. App. 3d 996.

The Restatement of Torts Second (1977) also takes the view that
consent  to  sexual  intercourse  is  not  the  equivalent  of  consent  to  be
infected with a venereal disease. Speciﬁcally, it provides the following
example:

A  consents  to  sexual  intercourse  with  B,  who  knows  that  A  is  ignorant  of  the
fact that B has a venereal disease. B is subject to liability to A for battery.

Illus. 5 §892B. Other authorities also conclude that a cause of action
in  battery  will  lie,  and  consent  will  be  ineffective,  if  the  consenting
person  was  mistaken  about  the  nature  and  quality  of  the  invasion
intended. See, Prosser and Keeton, n. 105, §18 at 119-20.

We  see  no  reason,  should  the  facts  support  it,  that  a  tortfeasor
could  not  be  held  liable  for  battery  for  infecting  another  with  a
sexually  transmissible  disease  in  Florida.  In  so  holding,  we  align
ourselves  with  the  well  established,  majority  view  which  permits
lawsuits  for  sexually  transmitted  diseases.  Hogan’s  consent,  if
without  the  knowledge  that  Tavzel  was  infected  with  a  sexually

transmitted disease, was the equivalent of no consent, and would not
be a defense to the battery charge if successfully proven.

McPHERSON v. McPHERSON
712 A.2d 1043 (Me. 1988)

    , J.

Nancy  McPherson  appeals  from  the  judgment  of  the  Superior
Court denying her [cause of action for] battery [arising] from her claim
that  her  husband,  Steven  McPherson,  infected  her  with  a  sexually
transmitted disease he acquired through an extramarital affair.

Nancy  ﬁled  a  complaint  against  Steven,  after  their  divorce,
claiming that he had infected her with a sexually transmitted disease,
Human  Papilloma  Virus  (HPV).  Nancy  alleged  that  Steven  acquired
HPV  through  a  clandestine  extramarital  affair  with  Jane  Doe.  The
complaint further alleges that Steven transmitted the disease to her,
prior to their divorce, through sexual intercourse.

Following a jury-waived trial, the court made the following factual
ﬁndings:  that  Nancy  “has  been  and  may  still  be  infected  with  HPV”;
that it is more likely than not that she was infected with HPV through
sexual  contact  with  another  individual;  that  Steven  was  the  only
sexual  partner  that  Nancy  has  ever  had;  and  that  it  was  more  likely
than not that Steven infected Nancy with HPV. The court also noted
that,  even  though  Steven  did  not  then  exhibit  evidence  of  the  HPV
infection, “this is in no way proof that he is not now in a latent stage
nor does it demonstrate or have any probative value as to whether or
not  he  was  a  carrier”  at  the  time  he  allegedly  infected  Nancy.  The
court  found  further  that  Steven  had  a  sexual  relationship  with  Doe,
that  he  had  sexual  intercourse  with  Nancy  after  having  intercourse
with Doe, that he did not disclose his sexual relationship with Doe to
Nancy,  and  that  he  took  no  steps  to  protect  Nancy  from  possible
infection with a sexually transmitted disease. Finally, the court found

that Steven “did not know or have reason to know” that he might have
HPV  at  the  time  he  infected  Nancy  because  he  had  no  physical
symptoms  of  HPV  infection,  he  had  no  knowledge  of  any  other
partner having symptoms of HPV, and he had no medical diagnosis of
any kind of a sexually transmitted disease.

Nancy  .  .  .  challenges  the  court’s  judgment  with  regard  to  the
assault  and  battery  claim.  The  court  found  that  no  assault  and
battery occurred because the sexual intercourse between Steven and
Nancy  was  consensual.  She  argues  that  her  consent  to  have  sexual
intercourse  with  Steven  was  vitiated  by  the  fact  that  he  failed  to
inform her of his extramarital affair.

“One  who  effectively  consents  to  conduct  of  another  intended  to
invade his interests cannot recover in an action of tort for the conduct
or for harm resulting from it.” Restatment (Second) of Torts §892A(1)
(1977). Consent may be vitiated, however by misrepresentation:

If the person consenting to the conduct of another is induced to consent by a
substantial mistake concerning the nature of the invasion of his interests or the
extent of the harm to be expected from it and the mistake is known to the other
or  is  induced  by  the  other’s  misrepresentation,  the  consent  is  not  effective  for
the unexpected invasion or harm.

Id.  §892B(2).  By  way  of  illustration,  the  Restatement  provides:  “A
consents to sexual intercourse with B, who knows that A is ignorant
of the fact that B has a venereal disease. B is subject to liability to A
for battery.” Id. §892B(2) cmt. e, illus. 5.

Nancy argues only that Steven misled her concerning his ﬁdelity.
Given  the  court’s  ﬁnding  that  Steven  neither  knew  nor  should  have
known  of  his  infection  with  HPV,  however,  Nancy  cannot  argue  that
Steven  misled  her  “concerning  the  nature  of  the  invasion  of  [her]
interest  or  the  extent  of  the  harm  to  be  expected”  therefrom.  If  the
defendant,  ignorant  of  the  fact  that  he  was  infected  with  a  sexually
transmitted  disease,  has  sexual  intercourse  with  the  plaintiff,  “the
defendant  will  not  be  liable,  because  the  plaintiff  consented  to  the

kind  of  touch  intended  by  the  defendant,  and  both  were  ignorant  of
the  harmful  nature  of  the  invasion.”  Prosser  &  Keeton,  The  Law  of
Torts §18 at 119 (5th Ed. 1984); see Hogan v. Tavzel, 660 So. 2d 350
(Fla.  Dist.  Ct.  App.  1995).  Thus,  Steven  may  not  be  held  liable  for
assault and battery.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Fraud.  The Hogan court held that the defendant’s fraud tainted
the  consent,  rendering  it  inoperable.  Fraud  plays  a  major  role  in  tort
litigation.  In  both  Hogan  and  McPherson,  plaintiffs  invoked  fraud  to
attempt  to  render  the  afﬁrmative  defense  of  consent  void.  Later,  in
Chapter 7, we will explore some general defenses available in any tort
case.  Speciﬁcally,  in  the  context  of  exploring  the  defense  of  the
statute of limitations (i.e., the untimely ﬁling of a lawsuit) we will see
that the related doctrine of fraudulent concealment  similarly  renders
inoperable that defense. Further, fraud can be used as its own stand-
alone  cause  of  action  when  someone  is  induced  to  enter  into  a
business  transaction  through  the  defendant’s  misrepresentation  of
some  fact.  This  cause  of  action  is  covered  in  Chapter  13  Business
Torts. Beyond torts, fraud is relevant in many areas of the law. It plays
a  major  role  in  the  ﬁeld  of  contracts  as  a  defense  to  contract
enforcement,  and  in  bankruptcy  law  it  can  be  invoked  to  avoid
protection of a debtor who defrauded a creditor.

2.  Problems.   Based  upon  the  courts’  opinions  in  Hogan  and
McPherson,  would  the  plaintiff’s  consent  in  the  following  scenarios
be  vitiated  by  the  defendant’s  fraudulent  misconduct?  Can  you
articulate  a  clear  rule  that  differentiates  in  these  scenarios  when
consent is invalid?

A. John and Susan are unmarried. John knows he has an STD but
fails  to  inform  Susan  of  this  fact.  After  they  have  sex,  Susan
discovers she has been infected.

B. John and Susan are married but John is secretly having an affair
with another woman. Susan does not know about this affair and
she and John continue to have sex. Susan eventually discovers
the inﬁdelity and is upset.

C. John and Susan are unmarried. After the prom, John tells Susan
that he loves her and then they have sex. John never calls again
and Susan is upset. During discovery in the lawsuit, Susan ﬁnds
an entry in John’s diary where he admits he never loved Susan.
3. Seduction.  At common law, many states recognized a cause of
action  brought  by  the  father  of  a  young,  previously  virtuous  woman
who  had  been  induced  to  have  sexual  relations  with  the  defendant
based upon a false promise of marriage. In effect, the law treated the
woman  as  tainted  property  and  provided  for  recovery  to  aid  in
providing  ﬁnancial  support  on  the  theory  that  she  was  no  longer
suitable  as  a  wife  for  another.  There  are  many  conceptual  problems
with this, in addition to the offensive presumptions underlying such a
tort, and all courts have abandoned this cause of action.

III  DEFENSE OF SELF, OTHERS, AND PROPERTY

The  common  thread  holding  together  the  tapestry  of  the  various
intentional torts is the principle of individual autonomy and freedom.
We get to decide, generally, who touches our bodies, our castle, and
our  toys.  When  tortfeasors  threaten  those  rights,  the  law  certainly
affords  a  court-driven  remedy  in  terms  of  recognizing  causes  of
action that provide monetary recovery to alleviate the violation. But in
an  effort  to  promote  more  efﬁcient  responses,  ameliorate  the
consequences of the violation of our rights, and reflect the reality of
our human nature, tort law also recognizes certain self-service rights.
That  is,  the  law  permits  us  to  take  action  that  would  otherwise  be
tortious  in  order  to  defend  our  legitimate  interests  in  autonomy  and
freedom. When another’s misconduct constitutes a legitimate threat
of  harm  to  our  bodies  (or  our  stuff),  the  law  permits  us  to  cause
harmful contacts to the source of our threat; that is, the law permits
us to engage in acts of self-defense. Similarly, the law permits us to
defend  others  who  are  threatened.  Of  course,  not  every  perceived
threat  validates  causing  harm  to  others.  And  not  every  legitimate
threat  permits  unlimited  response.  We  will  begin  with  perhaps  the
most instinctive reaction to a threat to our own physical well-being —
the urge to lash out at others to protect ourselves.

A. Self-Defense

SLAYTON v. McDONALD
690 So. 2d 915 (La. Ct. App. 1997)

        , J.

The  plaintiff,  Slayton,  appeals  a  trial  court  judgment  rendered  in
favor  of  the  defendant,  McDonald,  rejecting  plaintiff’s  claim  for
personal  injuries  sustained  as  the  result  of  a  shooting  incident.  For
the reasons assigned below, we afﬁrm the trial court’s judgment.

On  the  afternoon  of  May  20,  1994,  fourteen-year-old  Daniel
McDonald and fourteen-year-old James Slayton had a disagreement
while  riding  the  school  bus  to  their  neighboring  Dubach  homes.
Slayton  was  the  larger  of  the  two  boys  and  was  attending  high
school.  McDonald  was  attending
junior  high  school.  The
disagreement  began  when  Slayton  threw  a  piece  of  paper  at
McDonald. After McDonald threw the paper back at Slayton, Slayton
threatened to come to McDonald’s house. McDonald told Slayton not
to  come  to  his  house.  When  asked  about  Slayton’s  reputation  as  a
ﬁghter, McDonald testiﬁed he had heard that Slayton had won ﬁghts
against people larger than himself, and that Slayton could “take care
of himself pretty good.”

Later  that  afternoon,  after  McDonald  arrived  at  home,  he  went
outside  his  house  and  saw  Slayton  walking  up  the  long  driveway
toward  him.  Slayton  testiﬁed  that  he  went  to  McDonald’s  house
because he wanted to talk to McDonald about “kicking and punching
on  little  kids  and  about  messing  with  me  and  stuff.”  There  were  no
adults  present  at  McDonald’s  home  when  Slayton  arrived  at  the
residence. McDonald yelled at Slayton to go home. However, Slayton
kept walking up McDonald’s driveway. Slayton testiﬁed that he did not
hear  McDonald’s  warning.  After  shouting  the  warning  to  Slayton,
McDonald  went  into  his  house,  got  his  twelve-gauge  shotgun,  came
back outside and loaded the gun with #7 1/2 shot shells. McDonald
testiﬁed that Slayton saw him load the gun; Slayton said that he did
not. Again, McDonald asked Slayton to leave and Slayton refused.

McDonald then retreated into his home and called 911 to request
help.  McDonald  testiﬁed  that  he  closed  the  front  door  of  his  house
after  retreating  inside.  Slayton  testiﬁed  that  the  door  was  open.

However, it is undisputed that the front door of the McDonald home
did not have a lock and anyone could open it from the outside.

As  McDonald  spoke  to  the  911  operator,  Slayton  came  inside
McDonald’s  house.  The  transcript  of  the  911  conversation  reveals
that  McDonald  told  Slayton  to  leave  several  times,  to  no  avail.
McDonald  can  be  heard  to  say:  “I  think  he’s  like  sixteen.  He’s  a  lot
bigger  than  me  and  he’s  in  my  house”;  “Don’t  take  another  step
towards me”; and, “If he keeps coming toward me I’m going to shoot
him.”

McDonald  testiﬁed  that  Slayton  pointed  at  his  own  leg,  dared
McDonald to shoot, and said that McDonald “didn’t have the guts” to
shoot.  McDonald  also  stated  that  Slayton  told  him  he  was  going  to
teach  him  a  lesson  and  “kick  my  [McDonald’s]  ass.”  Slayton  testiﬁed
that after McDonald threatened to shoot him, he told McDonald that if
McDonald shot him, he would get up and beat McDonald.

When  asked  if  he  was  afraid  when  Slayton  came  into  his  house,
McDonald testiﬁed that Slayton frightened him because “he [Slayton]
had  a  crazy  look  in  his  eye.  I  didn’t  know  what  he  was  going  to  do
after  he  didn’t  stop  for  the  gun,  I  thought  he  must  have  been  crazy.”
McDonald  also  told  the  911  operator  that  “he’s  kinda  crazy,  I  think.”
McDonald testiﬁed that Slayton “asked me if I could get him before he
got to me and got the gun ﬁrst. I was afraid that if he came past the
gun that he was crazy enough to kill me.”

At  some  point  during  the  encounter,  Slayton’s  younger  sister,
Amanda,  arrived  at  the  McDonald  home  and  asked  Slayton  to  leave
because  McDonald  was  armed.  According  to  McDonald,  Slayton
refused to leave by saying “he’s too scared to shoot me. He’s about to
cry.”  The  911  operator  told  McDonald  several  times  not  to  shoot
Slayton; McDonald said “I ain’t gonna shoot him but in the leg. But I
have to defend myself.” Slayton testiﬁed that McDonald never pointed
the shotgun at his head or chest.

What  happened  next  was  a  matter  of  some  dispute.  On  the  911
transcript,  McDonald  tells  Slayton  that  “I  might  just  count  to  three.”
Slayton testiﬁed that he was kneeling down because he was “resting
waiting  for  the  cops  to  get  there  so  I  could  tell  my  story.”  However,
Amanda  Slayton  and  McDonald  testiﬁed  that  Slayton  was  standing.
Both Amanda and James Slayton testiﬁed that Slayton did not make
a  move  toward  McDonald,  and  Slayton  testiﬁed  that  at  all  times
during  the  incident,  he  was  never  more  than  two  feet  inside  the
McDonald  home.  However,  McDonald  testiﬁed  that  Slayton  then
began to count and to move “eight feet at least” into the home. On the
tape of the 911 conversation, most of what Slayton says is inaudible,
but, at the point where McDonald states that he might count to three,
Slayton  can  be  heard  to  count  “one — two — three.”  McDonald  then
shot  Slayton  once  in  the  left  knee.  Slayton’s  grandmother  arrived
shortly  thereafter,  pulled  Slayton  out  of  the  McDonald  home  and
waited for the paramedics and law enforcement authorities to arrive.

McDonald testiﬁed that from his experience, a load of #71/2 shot
did  not  do  a  great  deal  of  damage  to  animals  at  ordinary  hunting
distance,  but  he  had  never  ﬁred  his  shotgun  at  anything  so  close
before.  On  the  911  tape,  McDonald  can  be  heard  saying,  “I  ain’t  got
but squirrel shot in here.” Nevertheless, according to one of Slayton’s
doctors,  Dr.  Richard  I.  Ballard,  the  shot  charge  caused  Slayton  a
“devastating”  and  “severe”
injury  that  will  require  knee  fusion
rendering  his  knee  permanently  stiff  and  the  injured  leg  at  least  an
inch shorter than the other leg. Slayton and his parents testiﬁed that
the  injury  had  caused  Slayton  tremendous  pain  and  had  drastically
reduced  or  eliminated  his  ability  to  engage  in  activities  he  used  to
enjoy.

The  trial  court  rejected  [plaintiff’s  claim  ﬁnding  that]  Slayton,  “a
much  larger  opponent  who  had  a  reputation  for  ﬁghting,”  was  the
aggressor  in  the  encounter  and  that  McDonald  acted  reasonably
under  the  circumstances  in  protecting  himself  using  only  that  force

necessary to prevent a forcible offense against his person. From this
adverse judgment, plaintiff appeals.

The  plaintiff  contends  the  trial  court  erred  in  ﬁnding  that  the
defendant’s  son  acted
the  circumstances
reasonably  under
surrounding  this  incident,  and  thus,  was  justiﬁed  in  shooting  the
plaintiff’s son in the leg. We do not ﬁnd that the trial court erred.

[Tort  doctrines  preclude]  tort  recovery  where  the  plaintiff  acts  in
such  a  way  to  provoke  a  reasonable  person  to  use  physical  force  in
fear  or  anticipation  of  further  injury  at  the  hand  of  the  aggressor
plaintiff,  unless  the  person  retaliating  has  used  excessive  force  to
repel the aggression.

Generally, one is not justiﬁed in using a dangerous weapon in self-
defense if the attacking party is not armed but only commits battery
with  his  ﬁsts  or  in  some  manner  not  inherently  dangerous  to  life.
However,  resort  to  dangerous  weapons  to  repel  an  attack  may  be
justiﬁable  in  certain  cases  when  the  fear  of  danger  of  the  person
attacked  is  genuine  and  founded  on  facts  likely  to  produce  similar
emotions in reasonable men. Under this rule, it is only necessary that
the actor have grounds which would lead a reasonable man to believe
that  the  employment  of  a  dangerous  weapon  is  necessary,  and  that
he  actually  so  believes.  All  facts  and  circumstances  must  be  taken
into  account  to  determine  the  reasonableness  of  the  actor’s  belief,
but  detached  reflections  or  a  pause  for  consideration  cannot  be
demanded  under  circumstances  which  by  their  nature  require  split
second  decisions.  Various  factors  relied  upon  by  the  courts  to
determine  the  reasonableness  of  the  actions  of  the  party  being
attacked  are  the  character  and  reputation  of  the  attacker,  the
belligerence  of  the  attacker,  a  large  difference  in  size  and  strength
between  the  parties,  an  overt  act  by  the  attacker,  threats  of  serious
bodily harm, and the impossibility of a peaceful retreat.

In  the  instant  case,  McDonald  testiﬁed  that  he  believed  that
Slayton  had  beaten  up  people  larger  than  himself,  and,  in  essence,

was capable of giving McDonald a beating as well; Slayton admitted
that he had been in two ﬁghts while attending junior high school but
gave  no  details  of  those  altercations.  Moreover,  Slayton  exhibited
marked  belligerence  by  refusing  to  leave  McDonald’s  home  despite
repeated  demands  by  McDonald  while  the
latter  was  on  the
telephone  with  law  enforcement  authorities  and  was  armed  with  a
loaded  twelve-gauge  shotgun.  This  combination  of  reputation  and
belligerence evidence provides support for the trial court’s conclusion
that  “the  presence  of  the  shotgun  and  defendant’s  threats  were
insufﬁcient  to  thwart  plaintiff’s  advances.”  It  is  undisputed  that
Slayton  was  considerably  physically  larger  than  McDonald,  and  the
trial  court  accepted  McDonald’s  testimony  that  Slayton  had
threatened to harm him. Indeed, Slayton himself admitted that he told
McDonald  that  if  McDonald  shot  him,  he  was  going  to  get  up  and
beat McDonald.

The  trial  court’s  ﬁnding  that  McDonald  shot  Slayton  “to  stop  the
plaintiff’s advance” is a decision based upon the court’s judgment of
the credibility of the witnesses. Although both Slayton and his sister
contradicted  McDonald’s  testimony  that  Slayton  was  advancing
when  he  was  shot,  Slayton’s  testimony  that  he  was  kneeling  down
when he was shot is contradicted by that of his sister and McDonald.
Additionally,  Slayton’s  testimony  that  he  never  came  more  than  two
feet into the house is contradicted by A.S. McDonald’s testimony that
he found blood about ten feet inside his home. Finally, the 911 tape,
on which Slayton’s voice became clearly audible only seconds before
McDonald shot him, is further support for the conclusion that Slayton
was  advancing  upon  McDonald  when  shot.  From  its  reasons  for
judgment,
is  apparent  that  the  trial  court  chose  to  credit
McDonald’s  version  of  events  over  Slayton’s  version.  Because  the
record supports this decision, it will not be disturbed on appeal.

it

Finally,  it  is  evident  that  McDonald  was  simply  unable  to  retreat
from  the  encounter.  While  retreat  is  not  a  condition  precedent  for  a
ﬁnding  of  self-defense  using  justiﬁable  force,  in  our  opinion,  the

retreat  of  a  lawful  occupant  of  a  home  into  a  position  in  his  home
from which he cannot escape an attacker except by the use of force
is  strong  evidence  that  the  occupant’s  use  of  force  to  prevent  the
attack  is  proper.  Although  a  shotgun  may  be  a  deadly  weapon,
McDonald  used  the  gun  in  a  way  that  he  calculated  would  stop  the
attack  without  fatally  injuring  Slayton.  Further,  as  recited  above,
McDonald testiﬁed that he was “afraid that if he [Slayton] came past
the  gun  that  he  was  crazy  enough  to  kill  me.”  Under  these
circumstances,  where  McDonald  was  on  the  telephone  with  law
enforcement  authorities  and  had  repeatedly  demanded  that  Slayton
leave, and Slayton continued to advance and threaten McDonald, we
cannot disagree with the trial court’s conclusion that McDonald used
reasonable force to repel Slayton’s attack.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Application of Self-Defense Privilege.  In the foregoing case, the
defendant invokes the afﬁrmative defense of self-defense to defeat a
battery  claim  by  the  plaintiff.  Self-defense  has  many  potential
applications  as  one  can  use  self-defense  (when  a  reasonable  belief
exists that it is necessary) as a defense to other intentional torts as
well,  such  as  assault,  trespass,  or  false  imprisonment,  when  the
defendant is threatened with various types of tortious misconduct by
the plaintiff.

is  unarmed.
unjustiﬁed
Circumstances would often yield this result but there is no per se rule
to this effect. Rather, the principle is that deadly force is permissible
when  a  defendant  has  a  reasonable  belief  that  such  force  is
necessary  to  prevent  serious  bodily  injury  to  himself  threatened  by
the plaintiff. What circumstances convinced the court in Slayton that
the use of a shotgun was appropriate against an unarmed teenager?

How  important  to  the  court’s  conclusion  was  the  fact  that  the
defendant  only  shot  at  the  plaintiff’s  leg  rather  than  attempting  to
shoot to kill?

3. Duty to Retreat.  In Slayton, the court notes that “retreat is not a
condition precedent for a ﬁnding of self-defense” but rather one factor
to  consider  in  determining  if  the  defendant’s  reaction  to  the  threat
was  justiﬁed.  Courts  have  not  been  consistent  in  their  view  of
whether one must ﬁrst attempt to retreat from a threat before using
deadly  force.  The  Second  Restatement  offered  the  following
compromise position:

[T]he  interest  of  society  in  the  life  and  efﬁciency  of  its  members
and  in  the  prevention  of  the  serious  breaches  of  the  peace
involved  in  bloody  affrays  requires  one  attacked  with  a  deadly
weapon,  except  within  his  own  dwelling  place,  to  retreat  before
using  force  intended  or  likely  to  inflict  death  or  serious  bodily
harm upon his assailant, unless he reasonably believes that there
is  any  chance  that  retreat  cannot  be  safely  made.  But  even  the
slightest doubt, if reasonable, is enough to justify his standing his
ground, and in determining whether his doubt is reasonable every
allowance  must  be  made  for  the  predicament  in  which  his
assailant has placed him.

Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts  §65,  cmt.  g  (1965).  Some  states,  by
statutory  enactment,  have  modiﬁed  some  of  these  common  law
principles  concerning  self-defense.  For  example,  Florida  famously
adopted  in  2005  a  so-called  “Stand-Your-Ground”  law  that  provides
that:

A  person  who  is  not  engaged  in  an  unlawful  activity  and  who  is
attacked  in  any  place  where  he  or  she  has  a  right  to  be  has  no
duty  to  retreat  and  has  the  right  to  stand  his  or  her  ground  and
meet  force  with  force,  including  deadly  force  if  he  or  she

reasonably  believes  it  is  necessary  to  do  so  to  prevent  death  or
great bodily harm to himself . . .

This  statute  became  the  center  of  the  media’s  coverage  of  the
Travyon  Martin  case.  Many  states  also  have  statutes  adopting  a
“Castle Doctrine” that declares that retreat is not needed if the person
is  attacked  in  their  home.  Our  focus  is  upon  the  basics  of  the
common law of this defense.

to  him/her

to  be  necessary  under  all

Fundamentally,  no  person  has  a  lawful  right  to  lay  hostile
and  menacing  hands  on  another.  However,  the  law  does  not
require  anyone  to  submit  meekly  to  the  unlawful  infliction  of
violence  upon  him/her.  He/She  may  resist  the  use  or
threatened use of force upon him/her. He/She may meet force
with force, but he/she may use only such force as reasonably
appears
the
circumstances for the purpose of self-protection. Accordingly,
if  you  ﬁnd  that  the  defendant  in  this  case  has  succeeded  in
proving that he/she was under attack by the plaintiff, and that
the  injury  sustained  by  the  plaintiff  was  inflicted  by  the
defendant’s  having  used  only  such  force  as,  under  all  the
circumstances,  was  necessary  or  reasonably  appeared  to
have  been  necessary  for  his/her  own  protection,  then  the
defense of self-defense has been proven, and you must ﬁnd in
favor  of  the  defendant  and  against  the  plaintiff.  Should  you
ﬁnd,  however,  that  the  defendant  was  not  under  attack,  or,  if
he/she  was  under  attack,  that  he/she  used  more  force  than
reasonably  appeared  necessary  to  defend  himself/herself,  or

that  he/she  continued  the  use  of  force  after  the  apparent
necessity  for  self-defense  had  ceased,  then  the  defense  of
self-defense has not been proven.

B. Defense of Others

The  law  generally  does  not  require  us  to  come  to  the  aid  of  others
who are imperiled. But if an actor does choose to intervene on behalf
of another facing danger at the hands of the plaintiff, may the actor
be justiﬁed in causing harm to the plaintiff to protect the interests of
the other? If so, what standard should apply to determine when such
a  privilege  exists  and  the  extent  of  the  privilege?  Young  v.  Warren
discusses and applies the privilege of defense of others.

YOUNG v. WARREN
383 S.E.2d 381 (N.C. App. 1989)

      , J.

In  this  civil  action  the  plaintiff  appeals  from  a  ﬁnal  judgment
entered  by  the  trial  court,  pursuant  to  a  jury  verdict,  denying  any
recovery on a wrongful death action.

The evidence introduced at trial showed that defendant shot and
killed  Lewis  Reid  Young  (“Young”)  on  12  May  1986.  The  death
occurred as a result of a 20-gauge shotgun blast ﬁred at close range
into  the  deceased’s  back.  On  14  October  1986,  the  defendant  pled
guilty to involuntary manslaughter.

Prior to the shooting, in the early morning hours of 12 May 1986,
Young,  who  had  been  dating  defendant’s  daughter  for  several
months, went to the home of defendant’s daughter who lived with her
two children within sight of the defendant’s residence. Upon arriving

at  the  defendant’s  daughter’s  home,  Young  threw  a  large  piece  of
wood through the glass in the front door. He then entered the home
by reaching through the broken window and unlocking the door. Once
inside  the  house  Young  argued  with  the  defendant’s  daughter  and
“jerked”  her  arm.  At  that  point,  the  defendant  arrived  with  his  loaded
shotgun, having been awakened by a telephone call from a neighbor,
his  ex-wife,  who  had  told  him  “something  bad  is  going  on”  at  his
daughter’s  house.  When  the  defendant  arrived  at  his  daughter’s
house, he heard screaming and saw Young standing inside the door.
The defendant then testiﬁed:

A.  I told him like, ‘Come on out. This doesn’t make any sense,’ and he
kind  of  came  forward,  you  know,  kind  of  had  his  hands  up  like
that.  (Indicating)  I  backed  away  from  the  door  and  I  told  him  to
get on out. ‘This can be taken care of tomorrow,’ or something to
that effect.

Q.  You told him to get the hell out, didn’t you?
A.  Well, okay; something like that.
Q.  Okay. And then what happened?
A.   Then  he  walked  out  the  door  and  I  just  backed  up  like  he  came
out the door and he walked over about six feet. There is a cement
porch  there,  and  he  stepped  right  there,  and  I  was  behind  him
anywhere  from  a  foot  to  eighteen  inches,  maybe  even  two  foot,
and he stopped. And in my opinion, he started to turn around. . . .

Q.  What did he do?
A.   He  stopped  and  started  to  lower  his  hands  and  started  to  turn

around.

Q.  What did you do?
A.  I prodded him with the gun and told him to get on out, and that’s

when it went off.

The  trial  judge  submitted  [a  question  to  the  jury,  to  which  the

plaintiff objected]:

Did the defendant, William S. Warren, act in the lawful defense of his daughter,
Autumn Stanley, and her children, his grandchildren?
Answer: Yes.

The  determinative  issue  is  whether  the  trial  court  erred  in

submitting the defense of family issue to the jury.

We  ﬁrst  determine  whether  a  defendant  in  a  civil  action  may
assert defense of family to justify assault on a third party. While self-
defense and defense of family are seen more often in the context of
criminal  law,  these  defenses  are  nonetheless  appropriate  in  civil
actions.  See  Harris  v.  Hodges,  291  S.E.2d  346  (1982);  S.  Spieser,  C.
Krause & A. Gans, The American Law of Torts Sec. 5:8 at 802 (1983)
(self-defense  and  defense  of  others  recognized  in  both  criminal  and
civil law); 22A Am. Jur. 2d Death Sec. 163 at 237 (1988) (the “defense
of self-defense is available in a wrongful death action”).

If  the  defenses  apply,  the  defendant’s  conduct  is  considered
“privileged” and the defendant is not subject to tort liability for actions
taken within the privilege. The defenses, as they result in avoidance of
liability, are considered afﬁrmative defenses and must be afﬁrmatively
pled. The burden of proof is on the defendant to prove the defenses
by a preponderance of the evidence.

An  assault  on  a  third  party  in  defense  of  a  family  member  is
privileged  only  if  the  “defendant  had  a  well-grounded  belief  that  an
assault  was  about  to  be  committed  by  another  on  the  family
member.”  State  v.  Hall,  366  S.E.2d  527,  529  (1988).  However,  in  no
event  may  defendant’s  action  be  in  excess  of  the  privilege  of  self-
defense granted by law to the family member. The privilege protects
the defendant from liability only to the extent that the defendant did
not  use  more  force  than  was  necessary  or  reasonable.  Prosser  &
Keeton, The Law of Torts Sec. 20 at 130 (5th ed. 1984); Hall, 89 N.C.
App. 366 S.E.2d at 528. Finally, the necessity for the defense must “be
immediate, and attacks made in the past, or threats for the future, will
not justify” the privilege. Prosser & Keeton, The Law of Torts at 130.

[T]he  record  contains  no  evidence  that  the  defendant  reasonably
believed his daughter was, at the time of the shooting of the plaintiff,
in  peril  of  death  or  serious  bodily  harm.  At  that  time,  the  plaintiff
stood outside the house with his back to the defendant. Defendant’s
daughter and children were inside the house, removed from any likely
harm from plaintiff. Accordingly, assuming arguendo the “defense of
family” had been adequately pled or tried by consent, the evidence in
this trial did not support the submission of the issue to the jury, and
the plaintiff is entitled to a new trial.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Reasonable Belief.  The ultimate standard for defense of others
is the same standard we have already seen in self-defense — the “well
grounded”  or  reasonable belief  of  the  actor  dictates  the  contours  of
the privilege. There are two parts to this privilege: (1) the defendant’s
actual  subjective  state  of  mind  must  be  that  the  force  used  is
necessary to protect the life or well-being of others from the plaintiff;
and (2) the objective reasonableness of the defendant’s belief based
upon  all  of  the  circumstances  and  information  available  to  the
defendant. In this regard, in another portion of the Young opinion the
court  addressed  the  trial  court’s  admission  of  certain  volatile
evidence:

Plaintiff ﬁrst contends the trial court erred in denying his in limine
motion seeking to prevent the admission of testimony concerning
Young’s  possession  of  a  ﬁrearm  and  his  blood/alcohol  level.  We
agree. An autopsy report indicated Young’s blood/ alcohol level at
the time of his death was .23 and that a detective removed a .22
caliber  pistol  from  plaintiff’s  pocket  after  his  death.  However,  no
testimony exists on record that the defendant knew Young had a
handgun in his possession or that he was aware that Young had
consumed  any  alcohol.  Accordingly,  we  determine  this  evidence

was  not  relevant  .  .  .  and  the  motion  in limine  should  have  been
allowed.

Can you understand why this evidence was irrelevant?

2. Triggering  of  the  Privilege.   In  Young,  the  court  holds  that  the
evidence fails to establish any evidentiary basis for invocation of the
defense of others privilege on the part of the father and that the jury
should  not  have  even  had  the  issue  submitted  to  them  for  their
determination.  When  you  read  the  testimony  of  the  defendant,  is  it
clear  that  he  intended  to  ﬁre  his  gun  or  just  to  nudge  the  decedent
with  it?  What  could  possibly  justify  holding  the  defendant  liable  for
the  battery  if  the  evidence  suggests  ﬁring  the  weapon  was  not
intentional?

3. Defense of Family or Others.  The court refers to the privilege to
protect  a  family  member  from  a  perceived  threat.  Originally  this
privilege  was  so  limited.  However,  because  it  makes  no  sense  to
provide  a  qualiﬁed  legal  privilege  solely  for  the  protection  of  family
members, courts have enlarged the defense of family into a defense
of others privilege. Now all courts recognize that any person may use
force  (or  the  threat  of  imminent  harm)  to  deter  or  protect  any  third
party whom the person reasonably believes to endangered.

4.  Erroneous  but  Reasonable  Belief.   In  the  opinion  of  the  court
above, it states in dicta that “in no event may defendant’s action be in
excess  of  the  privilege  of  self-defense  granted  by  law  to  the  family
member.”  Some  courts  have  agreed  with  this  proposition  and  held
that  even  if  the  defendant  invoking  the  privilege  had  a  reasonable
belief  that  force  was  needed  to  protect  the  third  party,  that  the
privilege fails if the third party could not have used self-defense. For
example,  the  defendant  might  come  upon  the  plaintiff  and  the  third
party appearing to be in a ﬁght when, in fact, they are merely playing a
game.  Most  courts,  however,  do  not  agree  with  this  limitation  and
only require that the party invoking the privilege have acted with the
requisite reasonable belief.

5. Judging the Reasonableness of the Force.  When the defendant
has a reasonable belief that either they or another faces an imminent
attack, they are permitted to use a reasonably proportional degree of
force  in  response.  The  amount  of  force  they  are  permitted  to  use  is
judged not by the results of their conduct, but by the intended force. If
a defendant intends only to push the plaintiff aside but causes great
harm,  the  action  might  be  justiﬁed  based  upon  the  slight  contact
intended. In Young,  did  the  court  invalidate  the  privilege  based  upon
the fact that the defendant ended up using deadly force? Or was the
defendant’s  legal  problem  that  he  was  entitled  to  use  no  force
whatsoever  under  the  circumstances?  Note  that  the  defendant
testiﬁed  that  he  intended  to  “prod”  the  decedent  and  that  the  gun
“went  off.”  What  facts  in  Young  were  most  essential  to  the  court’s
conclusion that the defendant’s conduct was unjustiﬁed?

C. Defense of Property

WOODARD v. TURNIPSEED
784 So. 2d 239 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000)

      , J.

Kenwyon  Woodard,  a  minor,  by  his  father  and  next  friend,  ﬁled  a
complaint  against  John  Turnipseed  in  the  Choctaw  County  Circuit
Court seeking personal injury damages. The complaint arises from an
assault  and  battery  committed  with  a  broom  against  him  by
Turnipseed,  a  large  dairy  farmer  who,  along  with  his  two  sons  and
brother,  owned  seventeen  hundred  acres  of  dairy  land.  [Turnipseed
was 57 years old and weighed 145 pounds. He had a very large dairy
operation, milking 450 cows daily. Kenwyon was 17 years old, 4'9" tall
and weighed 95 pounds.]

[The trial court denied Kenwyon’s motion for a directed verdict on
liability and submitted the case to the jury.] The jury returned a verdict
for Turnipseed. We ﬁnd merit in Kenwyon’s argument that his motion
for  a  directed  verdict  as  to  liability  should  have  been  granted.
Accordingly,  we  reverse  and  render  as  to  liability  but  remand  for  a
new trial on damages only.

On  September  7,  1996,  Kenwyon  was  employed  as  a  minimum
wage  milker  with  Turnipseed  Dairy  Farms  of  Ackerman,  Mississippi.
He  had  been  working  for  Turnipseed  Dairy  Farms  approximately  six
months  during  his  latest  employment  but  had  worked  for  the  dairy
once  before.  His  ﬁrst  employment  with  the  dairy  ended  when  he,
according to Turnipseed, was ﬁred by Turnipseed for not cleaning the
cows  prior  to  attaching  the  milker.  On  September  7,  he  was  ﬁred
again  for  the  same  reason.  According  to  Kenwyon,  he  did  not  know
why he was ﬁred the ﬁrst time.

On  September  7,  according  to  Turnipseed,  Kenwyon,  along  with
two  other  boys,  were  preparing  cows  to  be  milked.  One  boy  was
driving the cows into the stalls, another was dipping the cows’ udders
in  disinfectant,  and  Kenwyon  was  using  paper  towels  to  clean  the
udders.  Turnipseed  observed  that  Kenwyon  had  passed  over  three
ﬁlthy cows. Upon making this observation, Turnipseed told Kenwyon,
“you are ﬁred, and go punch out.”

Turnipseed  claims  that  when  he  ﬁred  Kenwyon  the  ﬁrst  time
Kenwyon  had  threatened  to  get  him.  Speciﬁcally,  Kenwyon  had  said
at that time, “I will get you for this.” Remembering the previous threat,
Turnipseed “thought this boy may vandalize my time clock.” Because
of  this,  Turnipseed  decided  to  escort  Kenwyon  to  the  time  clock.
According  to  Turnipseed,  Kenwyon  started  with  a  verbal  assault  as
they walked out of the barn. Turnipseed heard the same threat he had
heard  upon  the  ﬁrst  ﬁring  of  Kenwyon.  In  any  event,  Turnipseed
escorted  Kenwyon  to  the  time  clock,  and  Kenwyon  changed  clothes
and telephoned his father to get a ride home.

Turnipseed gave this account of the physical assault:

And now listen to this. Shirley is my foreman. I told her Shirley, I don’t care if the
cows go dry, don’t allow this boy back on the farm. I passed him off to her and
went back to the barn and milked. . . . Ten minutes later I step out of the barn
and there is Kenwyon. I said Kenwyon, didn’t I tell you not to come back on my
farm. Which  wasn’t  quite  the  truth  because  I  didn’t  address  him.  I  addressed
her in his presence.

Kenwyon  didn’t  say  anything.  I  said  Kenwyon  I  am  telling  you  to  get  off  of
my property. Kenwyon said I am not going anywhere. I stood there a minute. I
looked down. There was a broom leaning against the barn. I picked the broom
up. I said Kenwyon, you see this broom. I am telling you to get off my property.
Kenwyon didn’t respond in any way. I walked the eight steps to Kenwyon, and I
hit  him  three  times  with  the  broom.  The  last  lick  I  hit  him,  the  broom  handle
cracked. Didn’t break. Cracked. Kenwyon decided he wanted to leave my farm,
and he did.

As  a  result  of  the  attack,  Kenwyon  suffered  a  hematoma  of  the
right flank, a contusion of the left forearm and some contusion to the
kidney.  Michelle  Parsons,  a  family  nurse  practitioner,  testiﬁed  that
Kenwyon  was  kept  in  the  hospital  for  observations  for  eight  hours
because  blood  was  detected  in  his  urine.  Parsons  testiﬁed  that  the
blood in the urine was consistent with the bruised kidney suffered by
Kenwyon in the attack.

Turnipseed contends that he attacked Kenwyon in defense of self
and  property.  Turnipseed  argues  that  because  Kenwyon  had
threatened  to  get  him  on  a  previous  occasion  as  well  as  on  the
occasion giving rise to this appeal, he reasonably feared for his safety
and  the  safety  of  his  property.  He  contends  that  this  is  particularly
true  in  light  of  the  fact  that  he  told  Kenwyon  to  leave,  but  Kenwyon
refused to do so.

We ﬁrst recognize that if the facts showed that Turnipseed or his
property were imperiled by Kenwyon, he would have had a legitimate
right to defend himself and his property, but using only such force as
would  have  been  reasonably  necessary  to  accomplish  the  task.  Did
the facts show any such peril? The answer is an emphatic “no.”

We look to the evidence in the light most favorable to Turnipseed.
Turnipseed testiﬁed that, while he was escorting Kenwyon out of the
barn  to  the  time  clock,  Kenwyon  repeated  over  and  over  again  that
Kenwyon  was  going  to  get  Turnipseed.  Kenwyon  did  nothing  other
than make this threat. Turnipseed went back into the barn and began
to  assist  with  the  milking  operation.  Ten  minutes  later,  Turnipseed
sees  Kenwyon  sitting  on  a  car  parked  on  Turnipseed’s  property.
Kenwyon  has  nothing  in  his  hands  and  is  doing  nothing  other  than
sitting on the car. Turnipseed says to Kenwyon, “didn’t I tell you not to
come  back  on  my  farm,”  and  Kenwyon  did  not  say  anything.
Turnipseed  then  tells  Kenwyon  to  get  off  Turnipseed’s  property.
Kenwyon  says,  “I  am  not  going  anywhere.”  Turnipseed  picks  up  a
broom  and  again  tells  Kenwyon  to  get  off  Turnipseed’s  property.
Kenwyon  does  not  respond.  Turnipseed  then  walks  eight  steps  to
Kenwyon and hits him three times with the broom.

This  evidence  clearly  shows  that  neither  Turnipseed  nor  his
milking  operation  was  in  any  danger  of  being  attacked  by  Kenwyon,
the ninety-ﬁve pound minor. Turnipseed knew that Kenwyon had not
been  able  to  reach  anyone  to  get  a  ride  off  the  property  because
Turnipseed  was  there  when  the  unsuccessful  calls  were  made.
Further,  Turnipseed  knew  that  Kenwyon  did  not  possess  his  own
transportation and that Kenwyon’s father or mother transported him
to and from work at Turnipseed’s Dairy Farm.

When  Turnipseed  approached  Kenwyon  just  before  the  attack,
Kenwyon  was  not  near  any  of  the  milking  operations.  He  had  not
come  back  into  the  barn  or  given  any  indications  that  he  was
attempting  to  do  so.  It  had  been  at  least  ten  minutes  since  he  had
been escorted out of the barn. Surely, that was enough time for him
to return and launch any attack he wanted to make if indeed he had
planned to do so.
The  record

lived  from
Turnipseed’s  dairy  farm,  but  there  is  some  indication  that  it  was  at

home or his grandmother’s house, Kenwyon was left with the options
of walking the distance, however far, or waiting until his friend got off
work.  Under  these  circumstances,  it  was  not  unreasonable  for
Kenwyon to wait for a ride home. Granted, when he was accosted by
Turnipseed and told to leave, he should have left, but his failing to do
justify  the  brutal  attack  by  Turnipseed,  especially
so  did  not
considering  the  fact  that  Kenwyon  was  a  minor  with  no  available
means of leaving except on foot.

Moreover,  the  record  is  clear  that  Turnipseed  really  never  viewed
Kenwyon as a threat to either his person or his property. Consider this
testimony:

Q.  And when you struck him, did he get off your property?
A.   The  ﬁrst  two  times  he  stood  there  and  glared  at  me.  After  the

third blow he started off my property.
Q.  And he — did he run off the property?
A.  I just observed the ﬁrst few steps. I was satisﬁed that he was no

longer an immediate threat, and I went back to work.

Surely,  if  Turnipseed  had  been  concerned  that  Kenwyon  had
intentions  of  attacking  him  or  sabotaging  his  milking  operations,  he
would have observed Kenwyon for more than “the ﬁrst few steps,” and
he certainly would not have gone immediately back to work. He would
have stayed around to see just what Kenwyon was going to do.

The  evidence  leads  us  to  the  inevitable  conclusion  that  the  trial
court  erred  in  not  granting  Kenwyon’s  motion  for  a  directed  verdict.
Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Turnipseed, as we
are required to do and have done in the preceding discussion, we are
convinced  that  reasonable  and  fairminded  persons  could  not  have
concluded  that  Turnipseed,  a  ﬁfty-seven-year-old  mature  man
weighing  one  hundred  forty-ﬁve  pounds,  believed  himself  or  his
property  in  danger  of  attack  from  4'9",  ninety-ﬁve  pound  Kenwyon.

Accordingly,  we  reverse  and  render  on  the  question  of  Turnipseed’s
liability but remand the case for a new trial on damages only.

KATKO v. BRINEY
183 N.W.2d 657 (Iowa 1971)

     , J.

The  primary  issue  presented  here  is  whether  an  owner  may
protect  personal  property  in  an  unoccupied  boarded-up  farm  house
against trespassers and thieves by a spring gun capable of inflicting
death or serious injury.

We are not here concerned with a man’s right to protect his home
and members of his family. Defendants’ home was several miles from
the scene of the incident to which we refer.

Plaintiff’s  action  is  for  damages  resulting  from  serious  injury
caused by a shot from a 20-gauge spring shotgun set by defendants
in  a  bedroom  of  an  old  farm  house  which  had  been  uninhabited  for
several  years.  Plaintiff  and  his  companion,  Marvin  McDonough,  had
broken and entered the house to ﬁnd and steal old bottles and dated
fruit jars which they considered antiques.

At  defendants’  request  plaintiff’s  action  was  tried  to  a  jury
consisting of residents of the community where defendants’ property
was  located.  The  jury  returned  a  verdict  for  plaintiff  and  against
defendants for $20,000 actual and $10,000 punitive damages.

After  careful  consideration  of  defendants’  motions  for  judgment
notwithstanding  the  verdict  and  for  new  trial,  the  experienced  and
capable  trial  judge  overruled  them  and  entered  judgment  on  the
verdict. Thus, we have this appeal by defendants.

Most  of  the  facts  are  not  disputed.  In  1957  defendant  Bertha  L.
Briney  inherited  her  parents’  farm  land  in  Mahaska  and  Monroe
Counties.  Included  was  an  80-acre  tract  in  southwest  Mahaska

County  where  her  grandparents  and  parents  had  lived.  No  one
occupied  the  house  thereafter.  Her  husband,  Edward,  attempted  to
land.  He  kept  no  farm  machinery  thereon.  The
care  for  the
outbuildings became dilapidated.

For about 10 years, from 1957 to 1967, there occurred a series of
trespassing  and  housebreaking  events  with  loss  of  some  household
items,  the  breaking  of  windows  and  “messing  up  of  the  property  in
general.” The latest occurred June 8, 1967, prior to the event on July
16, 1967 herein involved.

Defendants through the years boarded up the windows and doors
in  an  attempt  to  stop  the  intrusions.  They  had  posted  “no  trespass”
signs  on  the  land  several  years  before  1967.  On  June  11,  1967
defendants  set  “a  shotgun  trap”  in  the  north  bedroom.  It  was  rigged
with wire from the doorknob to the gun’s trigger so it would ﬁre when
the door was opened. He admitted he did so “because I was mad and
tired of being tormented” but “he did not intend to injure anyone.” He
gave no explanation of why he used a loaded shell and set it to hit a
person already in the house. No warning of its presence was posted.

Plaintiff lived . . . seven miles from the old house. He had observed
it  for  several  years  while  hunting  in  the  area  and  considered  it  as
being abandoned. Plaintiff and McDonough had been to the premises
and found several old bottles and fruit jars which they took and added

to their collection of antiques. On [the date of the incident] they made
a  second  trip  to  the  Briney  property.  They  entered  the  old  house  by
removing  a  board  from  a  porch  window  which  was  without  glass.
While McDonough was looking around the kitchen area plaintiff went
to  another  part  of  the  house.  As  he  started  to  open  the  north
bedroom door the shotgun went off striking him in the right leg above
the ankle bone. Much of his leg, including part of the tibia, was blown
away.

Plaintiff  testiﬁed  he  knew  he  had  no  right  to  break  and  enter  the
house with intent to steal bottles and fruit jars therefrom. He further
testiﬁed he had entered a plea of guilty to larceny in the nighttime of
property of less than $20 value from a private building.

The  main  thrust  of  defendants’  defense  in  the  trial  court  and  on
this appeal is that “the law permits use of a spring gun in a dwelling
or  warehouse  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  the  unlawful  entry  of  a
burglar or thief.” They repeated this contention in their exceptions to
the trial court’s instructions . . . .

[The trial court instructed the jury as follows:]

You are hereby instructed that one may use reasonable force in the protection
of  his  property,  but  such  right  is  subject  to  the  qualiﬁcation  that  one  may  not
use  such  means  of  force  as  will  take  human  life  or  inflict  great  bodily  injury.
Such is the rule even though the injured party is a trespasser and is in violation
of the law himself. [and]

An  owner  of  premises  is  prohibited  from  willfully  or  intentionally  injuring  a
trespasser by means of force that either takes life or inflicts great bodily injury;
and therefore, a person owning a premise is prohibited from setting out “spring
guns” and like dangerous devices which will likely take life or inflict great bodily
injury, for the purpose of harming trespassers. The fact that the trespasser may
be acting in violation of the law does not change the rule. The only time when
such  conduct  of  setting  a  “spring  gun”  or  a  like  dangerous  device  is  justiﬁed
would be when the trespasser was endangering human life by his act.

The  overwhelming  weight  of  authority,  both  textbook  and  case
law, supports the trial court’s statement of the applicable principles of

law.

Prosser on Torts, Third Edition, pages 116-118, states:

[T]he law has always placed a higher value upon human safety than upon mere
rights  in  property,  it  is  the  accepted  rule  that  there  is  no  privilege  to  use  any
force  calculated  to  cause  death  or  serious  bodily  injury  to  repel  the  threat  to
land or chattels, unless there is also such a threat to the defendant’s personal
safety  as  to  justify  self-defense  .  .  .  spring  guns  and  other  man-killing  devices
are  not  justiﬁable  against  a  mere  trespasser,  or  even  a  petty  thief.  They  are
privileged  only  against  those  upon  whom  the  landowner,  if  he  were  present  in
person would be free to inflict injury of the same kind.

The legal principles stated by the trial court in [these] instructions
are  well  established  and  supported  by  the  authorities  cited  and
quoted  supra.  There  is  no  merit  in  defendants’  objections  and
exceptions thereto. Defendants’ various motions based on the same
reasons stated in exceptions to instructions were properly overruled.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Proportional Defense.  Both of the foregoing cases acknowledge
property  owners’  right  to  defend  themselves  and  their  property.  For
either, the privilege is triggered by “reasonable belief” that the plaintiff
imperils  the  interest  in  question.  A  reasonable  amount  of  force
necessary to protect the interest is qualiﬁed, but in no event can force
designed  to  cause  death  or  serious  bodily  injury  be  used  to  justify
protection  of  mere  property  rights.  Cases  refer  to  moderate  force
being permitted to protect property but not deadly force. Given that in
both  cases  there  is  evidence  of  wrongdoing  by  the  plaintiffs,  why
were defendants’ uses of force not privileged in either?

2.  The  Rest  of  the  Story.   The  Katko  case  became  an  instant
classic  of  torts  students  since  it  ﬁrst  appeared  in  Prosser’s  torts
casebook  in  1976;  students  debate  whether  the  plaintiff  or  the
defendants  were  justiﬁed  in  each  seeking  their  own  form  of  justice.

Some ﬁnd the result perverse, with the property owners having to pay
both  compensatory  and  punitive  damages  to  a  thief.  Indeed,  during
oral  arguments  before  the  Iowa  Supreme  Court  counsel  for  the
appellants,  the  Brineys,  consistently  referred  to  Mr.  Katko  as  the
“plaintiff-thief.”  Plaintiff’s  counsel  felt  that  the  law  was  clearly  on  his
side,  however,  and  so  he  did  not  even  demand  a  jury  (it  was
defendants  who  did  so).  The  all-female  jury  apparently  connected
with the plaintiff, who readily admitted his own wrongdoing, made no
attempt  to  justify  his  attempted  thievery,  and  was  reportedly  a
likeable, pleasant fellow with a strong religious background. Perhaps
the  jury  also  did  not  like  the  antics  of  defense  counsel,  who,  to
demonstrate  the  point  that  nobody  likes  their  possessions  to  be
taken from them, reached into the jury box during closing arguments
to snatch a juror’s purse. After the rather sizable verdict was upheld
by the Iowa Supreme Court, the Brineys were forced to sell  some  of
their  farmland  in  order  to  pay  the  judgment.  Afterward  Mrs.  Briney
sued  Katko  for  the  underlying  trespass  (one  wonders  why  this  was
not a compulsory counterclaim in the ﬁrst suit and waived) and was
awarded $150 in actual and $1,000 in punitive damages. Apparently
there  was  wrongdoing  on  both  sides  of  this  dispute,  though,
consistent  with  the  proportionality  principle,  the  respective  juries
viewed  the  property  owners’  sins  as  far  worse.  Counsel  for  Katko,
Garold Heslinga, thought to himself upon ﬁrst meeting his new client,
“Damn  this  will  be  fun.”  See  interview  of  Katko’s  trial  counsel  at

Relationship

to
Shopkeeper’s  Privilege.   Recall
from the last chapter under the
topic  of  “False  Imprisonment”
that the law permits persons to
detain  suspected  shoplifters
when  their  suspicions  are  based  upon  a  “reasonable  belief.”  We
discovered  that  this  privilege  was  limited,  and  that  the  detention
would  be  protected  only  so  long  as  it  involved  “reasonable  means”
and  for  a  “reasonable  time.”  There  is  a  nice  symmetry  between  the
shopkeeper’s  privilege  and  the  common  law’s  recognition  of  a
privilege to use a reasonably limited amount of force to protect one’s
property.

criminal activity in the neighborhood. His store has been robbed after
closing  at  night  multiple  times.  To  deter  this  from  continuing,  he
purchases  a  vicious  watchdog  and  sets  it  loose  in  the  store  every
night  at  closing.  He  has  posted  a  sign  on  the  front  door  warning,
“Caution: The Premises Are Protected by a Deadly Dog. Enter at Your
Own  Risk!”  A  few  months  later  a  burglar  enters  the  store  through  a

window and is mauled to death by the guard dog. Is the store owner
at risk of being liable for the wrongful death of the burglar?

Pulling It All Together

Lucinda is a high school honors student riding her bicycle home
from school one day after her chess club meeting. She hears the
sound of a young male voice screaming from inside of a home in
her  neighborhood.  She  rides  upon  the  front  yard  of  the  home,
sneaks up to the living room window, and peers inside. She sees
a man swinging a sword at a young boy approximately ten years
in  age.  He  is  screaming  “no,  don’t  kill  me!”  Lucinda  remembers
hearing  recent  reports  of  a  serial  murderer  in  the  small  town
breaking into homes and killing the homeowners. Fearing for the
life  of  the  boy  and  wanting  to  abduct  the  possible  serial  killer,
Lucinda  quickly  goes  into  the  garage  of  the  same  home  and
retrieves a golf club from a bag in the corner. She then proceeds
to  enter  the  home  through  an  open  kitchen  door  in  the  back,
sneaks  through  the  home  toward  the  living  room,  and  whacks
the sword-wielding man over the head with great force. The boy
sees this and begins screaming at her, “you’ve killed my Daddy.”
The man was only holding a toy sword, as was the boy, and they
were playing a game. Fortunately, Lucinda did not actually kill the
man but did cause him to have a concussion. Lucinda ran out of
the  house  and  encountered  another  teenager  beginning  to  pick
up  her  bicycle.  Fearing  that  he  was  trying  to  steal  her  bike,  she

ran up to him, pushed him onto the ground, and sped off on her
bike  as  quickly  as  possible.  He  suffered  minor  cuts  and
scratches  but  was  humiliated.  Analyze  all  the  possible  claims

I  INTRODUCTION

The tort of negligence is undoubtedly the most important, and most
pervasive,  tort  cause  of  action  today.  Unlike  most  other  tort  claims
that tend to be self-limiting to certain particular circumstances (e.g.,
battery  claims  generally  involve  someone  getting  hit  by  another  on
purpose), the tort of negligence has great flexibility — it can be, and is,
applied  to  an  inﬁnite  variety  of  differing  factual  circumstances.
Examples  of  negligence  claims  include  the  motor  vehicle  accident
when  a  car  runs  a  red  light;  the  skier  who  hits  an  object  left  on  the
slope;  the  house  that  burns  after  the  furnace  is  poorly  repaired;  the
interaction;  the
doctor  who  forgets  about  a  disastrous  drug
radiologist who misses the tumor; and the hunter who fails to notice
another hunter in the woods. These examples barely begin to scratch
the surface of an area of the law whose potential application is only
limited by one’s imagination.

II  THE DUTY OF REASONABLE CARE

Fundamental  to  negligence  analysis  is  understanding  and  applying
the  duty  of  reasonable  care.  This  model  for  ﬁnding  fault  in  an
accidental tort case is so ingrained in common law tort jurisprudence
that it is often assumed that no other alternatives were ever possible.
The  following  classic  English  case  presented  the  court  with  the
opportunity to choose different standards for application in a case of
alleged  negligence.  As  you  read  it,  consider  the  arguments  of  the
defendant as to why his proposed standard should be utilized instead
of the one chosen by the trial court. Would there be anything wrong
with picking the defendant’s model?

A. The Objective Standard

VAUGHAN v. MENLOVE
132 Eng. Rep. 490 (C.P. 1837)

[Plaintiff  sued  the  defendant  for  negligently  burning  down  two
cottages  on  the  plaintiff’s  land.  Defendant  was  an  adjacent  property
owner  who  built  a  rick  of  hay — a  haystack — on  his  own  property
close  to  the  property  line.  Spontaneous  combustion  from  the
fermenting hay caused the hayrick to catch on ﬁre and spread across
the property line to the plaintiff’s cottages. Plaintiff alleged in his suit
that the defendant had been negligent in the manner in which he built
the hayrick, and that this permitted the hayrick to catch on ﬁre. There
was  also  some  evidence  at  trial  that  plaintiff  had  been  warned  in
advance  to  remove  the  hayrick  and  he  responded  by  saying  that  he
would “chance it.”

At  trial,  the  jury  was  instructed  by  the  court  that  the  defendant
owed  a  duty  to  act  as  a  prudent  man  would  have  acted  under  the
circumstances.  The  jury  found  in  the  plaintiff’s  favor,  but  the
defendant obtained a new trial order from the trial court arguing that
the  court  had  used  the  wrong  standard.  The  defendant  had  urged
that  the  jury  was  instead  to  have  been  instructed  to  consider  the
defendant’s  possible  negligence  judged  not  by  the  standard  of
ordinary  prudence,  but  with  reference  to  whether  the  defendant  had
acted  bona  ﬁde  to  the  best  of  his  judgment.  If  he  had,  he  was  not
responsible  for  the  plaintiff’s  damages  just  because  he  did  not
possess  the  “highest  order  of  intelligence.”  Upon  review  of  the  trial
court’s  order  granting  the  new  trial  request,  the  Court  of  Common
Pleas stated as follows:]

It is contended that the question ought to have been whether the
defendant  had  acted  honestly  and  bona  ﬁde  to  the  best  of  his  own
judgment. That, however, would leave so vague a line as to afford no
rule at all, the degree of judgment belonging to each individual being
inﬁnitely various; and though it has been urged that the care which a
prudent man would take is not an intelligible proposition as a rule of
law, yet such has always been the rule adopted in cases of bailment.
The care taken by a prudent man has always been the rule laid down;
and  as  to  the  supposed  difﬁculty  of  applying  it,  a  jury  has  always
been  able  to  say,  whether,  taking  that  rule  as  their  guide,  there  has
been negligence on the occasion in question.

Instead, therefore, of saying that the liability for negligence should
be co-extensive with the judgment of each individual, which would be
as  variable  as  the  length  of  the  foot  of  each  individual,  we  ought
rather  to  adhere  to  the  rule  which  requires  in  all  cases  a  regard  to
caution such as a man of ordinary prudence would observe. That was
in  substance  the  criterion  presented  to  the  jury  in  this  case,  and
therefore the present rule must be discharged.

[The  court  went  on  to  rule  that  the  ﬁnding  of  negligence  was
supported  by  the  evidence  because  it  was  “well  known  that  hay  will

ferment and take ﬁre if it be not carefully stacked.”]

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Standards of Care.  The trial court initially instructed the jury on
one  standard  for  analysis  in  negligence,  but  was  persuaded  by  the
defendant  that  it  should  have  applied  a  different  standard.  What  are
the differences between these two standards?

2.  Why  Does  It  Matter?   Think  of  the  implications  for  these  two
differing  standards.  Which  of  the  two  is  more  objective?  In  a  case
where the bona ﬁde standard would be applied, what kind of evidence
would  become  the  focal  point  for  determining  liability?  In  a  case
where  the  standard  originally  used  by  the  trial  court  applied,  how
would  the  focus  be  different?  What  do  these  differences  suggest
about which standard is more appropriate?

3.  Restatement’s  Modern  Formulation.   We  will  spend  more  time
exploring the “reasonable person,” but the following explanation from
the Restatement (Second) of Torts is instructive for now. It provides
as follows:

Sometimes  this  person  is  called  a  reasonable  man  of  ordinary
prudence,  or  an  ordinarily  prudent  man,  or  a  man  of  average
prudence, or a man of reasonable sense exercising ordinary care.
It is evident that all such phrases are intended to mean very much
the  same  thing.  The  actor  is  required  to  do  what  this  ideal
individual would do in his place. The reasonable man is a ﬁctitious
person,  who  is  never  negligent,  and  whose  conduct  is  always  up
to  standard.  He  is  not  to  be  identiﬁed  with  the  members  of  the
jury, individually or collectively. It is therefore error to instruct the
jury that the conduct of a reasonable man is to be determined by
what they would themselves have done.

Restatement  (Second)  of  Tort  §283  cmt.  c.  (1965).  Does  this
description  sound  more  like  the  standard  adopted  by  the  appellate
court in Vaughan, or that advocated by the defendant? Note that the
reasonable  person  is  a  hypothetical  creature  who  is  always  prudent
and never negligent. Does such a person exist, in fact? If not, is it fair
to impose this standard to determine fault?

B. Actual and Constructive Knowledge; Hindsight

PARROT v. WELLS, FARGO & CO.
82 U.S. 524 (1873)

Parrot  brought  an  action  in  the  court  below  against  certain
defendants who composed the well-known ﬁrm of Wells, Fargo & Co.,
express  carriers,  to  recover  damages  for  injuries  to  certain  large
buildings owned by him in the city of San Francisco, caused in April,
1866,  by  the  explosion  of  nitroglycerine  whilst  in  charge  of  the  said
defendants.

[Defendant  agreed  to  ship  a  329-pound  crate  for  an  individual
from New York City to San Francisco for a fee, in the ordinary course
of  defendant’s  business.  Upon  arrival  in  San  Francisco,  as  the  crate
was being moved to the wharf defendant discovered that it appeared
to  be  leaking  some  fluid.  The  fluid  had  the  appearance  of  sweet  oil.
An  adjacent  box  had  stains  on  its  outside  and  defendant  believed  it
too  was  leaking  its  contents  due  to  the  damage.  Defendant’s
standard  business  practice  was  to  take  any  damaged  crates  into  a
nearby building for inspection of the contents. Both the crate and the
box were, therefore, taken inside for this purpose. Defendants’ agents,
in the presence of other persons, took a mallet and chisel to the crate
and began to open it. In the process of doing so, the contents of the
crate  exploded  killing  all  present,  and  causing  signiﬁcant  damage  to

that building as well as other nearby buildings occupied by defendant.
It  was  later  determined  that  the  crate  contained  nitroglycerine.  The
other box contained silverware. In 1866 the properties and dangers of
nitroglycerine  were  not  well  known  or  understood.  Although  the
substance was discovered 20 years earlier, few experiments had been
conducted  with  it  and  those  were  conﬁned  to  certain  laboratories.
Merely  eight  days  before  the  accident  involved  in  this  case,  another
steamer  traveling  from  Hamburg  exploded  while  carrying  the  same
substance,  though  news  of  this  had  not  yet  reached  San  Francisco.
These  two  accidents  attracted  the  attention  of  scientists  to  the
subject  and  led  to  more  careful  investigation  and  experiments
regarding  the  substance  and  to  greater  industrial  uses  for  it.  On
plaintiff’s claim for negligence, the trial court held that defendant had
no tort liability for the accident and plaintiff sought review.]

Mr.  Justice       :  It  appears  from  the  record  that  the  court  ﬁnds,
that neither the defendants, nor any of their employees . . . who had
anything  to  do  with  the  case  of  nitroglycerine,  knew  the  contents  of
the case, or had any means of such knowledge, or had any reason to
suspect its dangerous character, and that they did not know anything
about  nitroglycerine,  or  that  it  was  dangerous.  And  it  also  appears
that the court ﬁnds, that there was no negligence on the part of the
defendants  in  receiving  the  case,  or  in  their  failure  to  ascertain  the
dangerous character of the contents; and in view of the condition of
their knowledge, of the want of means of knowledge, and the absence
of any reasonable ground of suspicion, that there was no negligence
in the handling of the case at the time of the explosion.

The question presented to us is, whether upon this state of facts
the  plaintiff  is  entitled  to  recover  for  the  injuries  caused  by  the
explosion  to  his  buildings,  outside  of  that  portion  occupied  by  the
defendants under their lease.

To  fasten  a  further  liability  on  the  defendants,  and  hold  them  for
injuries  to  that  portion  of  the  buildings  not  covered  by  their  lease,  it

was contended in the court below, and it is urged here, that, as matter
of  law,  they  were  chargeable  with  notice  of  the  character  and
properties of the merchandise in their possession, and of the proper
mode of handling and dealing with it, and were consequently guilty of
negligence in receiving, introducing, and handling the box containing
the nitroglycerine.

If express carriers are thus chargeable with notice of the contents
of  packages  carried  by  them,  they  must  have  the  right  to  refuse  to
receive  packages  offered  for  carriage  without  knowledge  of  their
contents.  It  would,  in  that  case,  be  unreasonable  to  require  them  to
accept, as conclusive in every instance, the information given by the
owner. They must be at liberty, whenever in doubt, to require, for their
satisfaction,  an  inspection  even  of  the  contents  as  a  condition  of
carrying  the  packages.  This  doctrine  would  be  attended  in  practice
with  great  inconvenience,  and  would  seldom  lead  to  any  good.
Fortunately,  the  law  is  not  so  unreasonable.  It  does  not  exact  any
such  knowledge  on  the  part  of  the  carrier,  nor  permit  him,  in  cases
free  from  suspicion,  to  require  information  as  to  the  contents  of  the
packages offered as a condition of carrying them.

[Cases cited from other courts] recognize the right of the carrier to
refuse  to  receive  packages  offered  without  being  made  acquainted
with their contents, when there is good ground for believing that they
contain  anything  of  a  dangerous  character.  It  is  only  when  such
ground  exists,  arising  from  the  appearance  of  the  package  or  other
circumstances  tending  to  excite  his  suspicions,  that  the  carrier  is
authorized, in the absence of any special legislation on the subject, to
require  a  knowledge  of  the  contents  of  the  packages  offered  as  a
condition of receiving them for carriage.

to  him

It  not,  then,  being  his  duty  to  know  the  contents  of  any  package
offered
there  are  no  attendant
circumstances  awakening  his  suspicions  as  to  their  character,  there
can  be  no  presumption  of  law  that  he  had  such  knowledge  in  any
particular case of that kind, and he cannot accordingly be charged as

for  carriage,  when

matter of law with notice of the properties and character of packages
thus received. The ﬁrst proposition of the plaintiff, therefore, falls, and
the second, which depends upon the ﬁrst, goes with it.

The  defendants,  being  innocently  ignorant  of  the  contents  of  the
case, received in the regular course of their business, were not guilty
of  negligence  in  introducing  it  into  their  place  of  business  and
handling it in the same manner as other packages of similar outward
appearance  were  usually  handled.  “Negligence”  has  been  deﬁned  to
be “the omission to do something which a reasonable man, guided by
those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human
affairs, would do, or doing something which a prudent and reasonable
man would not do.” It must be determined in all cases by reference to
the  situation  and  knowledge  of  the  parties  and  all  the  attendant
circumstances.  What  would  be  extreme  care  under  one  condition  of
knowledge,  and  one  state  of  circumstances,  would  be  gross
negligence  with  different  knowledge  and  in  changed  circumstances.
The  law  is  reasonable  in  its  judgments  in  this  respect.  It  does  not
charge  culpable  negligence  upon  any  one  who  takes  the  usual
precautions  against  accident,  which  careful  and  prudent  men  are
accustomed to take under similar circumstances.

[T]he gist of the action is the negligence of the defendants: unless
that be established, they are not liable. The mere fact that injury has
been caused is not sufﬁcient to hold them. No one is responsible for
injuries  resulting  from  unavoidable  accident,  whilst  engaged  in  a
lawful  business.  A  party  charging  negligence  as  a  ground  of  action
must prove it. He must show that the defendant, by his act or by his
omission,  has  violated  some  duty  incumbent  upon  him,  which  has
caused the injury complained of.

Here  no  such  proof  was  made,  and  the  case  stands  as  one  of
unavoidable accident, for the consequences of which the defendants
are not responsible. The consequences of all such accidents must be
borne by the sufferer as his misfortune.

This  principle  is  recognized  and  afﬁrmed  in  a  great  variety  of
cases — in  cases  where  ﬁre  originating  in  one  man’s  building  has
extended  to  and  destroyed  the  property  of  others;  in  cases  where
injuries have been caused by ﬁre ignited by sparks from steamboats
or  locomotives,  or  caused  by  horses  running  away,  or  by  blasting
rocks,  and  in  numerous  other  cases  which  will  readily  occur  to
everyone. The rule deducible from them is, that the measure of care
against accident, which one must take to avoid responsibility, is that
which  a  person  of  ordinary  prudence  and  caution  would  use  if  his
own interests were to be affected, and the whole risk were his own.

[As  Mr.  Justice  Nelson  has  declared  previously]  “[n]o  case  or
principle can be found, or, if found, can be maintained, subjecting an
individual to liability for an act done without fault on his part;” and in
this conclusion we all agree.
Judgment afﬁrmed.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Reasonable Person’s Knowledge.  Is it fair to say, from the above
opinion, that a reasonable person (a) knows all risks of harm from the
conduct  in  question,  (b)  knows  only  those  risks  that  the  defendant
was  actually  aware  of,  (c)  knows  only  those  risks  that  a  reasonable
person would have known, regardless of the actual knowledge of the
defendant,  or  (d)  some  combination  of  the  foregoing?  Notice  in  the
opinion  above  that  the  court  referred  to  Wells  Fargo  as  “innocently
ignorant”  of  the  risk  that  gave  rise  to  the  explosion.  Does  this
ignorance  refer  to  the  time  immediately  before  the  explosion  or
afterward?  Negligence  analysis  is  premised  upon  a  consideration  of
the  actor’s  actual  knowledge  prior  to  the  accident  as  well  as  the
constructive knowledge that a reasonable person would have had in
the  same  circumstances.  Hindsight  is  not  permitted  to  be  a  part  of

the  negligence  analysis.  If  judged  with  hindsight,  do  you  see  why
virtually every alleged negligent defendant would be liable?

2.  Catalyst  for  Change.   The  events  that  gave  rise  to  the  above
case  were  well  known.  This  incident,  and  another  one  happening  at
about the same time, led to signiﬁcant general knowledge throughout
the world regarding the dangerous propensities of nitroglycerine and
led to widespread changes regarding its safe use, transportation, and
storage. The reasonable person, as this case illustrates, does not run
ahead of society but keeps pace with such awareness and changes.

3. Problems.  Would Wells Fargo have been more likely to be found
negligent  with  the  following  modiﬁcations  to  the  facts  in  the
foregoing case?

A.  The  shipper  of  the  nitroglycerine  advised  Wells  Fargo  when  it
delivered  the  crate  that  the  contents  were  dangerous  and
needed extra care.

B.  Immediately  next  to  the  warehouse  where  Wells  Fargo  opened
the crate stood an elementary school ﬁlled with young children.
C.  The  Wells  Fargo  employee  who  opened  the  crate  had  special
expertise with chemicals and thought to herself, just before she
applied  the  mallet  and  chisel  to  the  crate,  “Hmm,  this  smells  a
lot like nitroglycerine!”

III  THE REASONABLE PERSON UNDER THE

CIRCUMSTANCES

The standard of the reasonable person under the circumstances has
proven  to  be  a  very  flexible  standard,  useful  in  many  different
contexts  for  determining  whether  an  actor  in  question  (typically  the
defendant, but sometimes a plaintiff too) is at fault for an accidental
injury. But how does this reasonable person act under different sorts
of  recurring  circumstances?  Is  reasonable  care  the  same  under
emergencies  as  in  other  instances?  When  an  activity  involves  a
greater degree of inherent danger, does the reasonable person act the
same? And what about actors that have different types of character
traits?  Does  the  reasonable  person  have  ordinary  knowledge,
intelligence,  and  experience  even  if  the  defendant  does  not?  Is  the
reasonable person sometimes blind, disabled, or mentally inﬁrm if the
actor  we  are  judging  has  such  a  condition?  The  following  cases
answer  these  questions.  Consider  as  you  read  these  cases  to  what
extent the answers to these questions are intellectually cohesive and
consistent.

A. Extraordinary Knowledge and Skill

Given  the  holding  in  Vaughan,  now  accepted  without  question  by
courts  everywhere,  that  an  actor’s  below-average  intelligence,  skills,
and experience will not excuse behavior, you might guess that for the
sake of consistency an actor’s above-average intelligence, skills, and
experience would also be disregarded. In fact, courts hold otherwise,
for the reasons explained in the following case.

CERVELLI v. GRAVES

661 P.2d 1032 (Wyo. 1983)

     , J.

This  case  arose  when  Larry  B.  Cervelli  [plaintiff]  ﬁled  a  personal
injury suit for injuries he sustained when a pickup truck driven by him
collided with a cement truck owned by DeBernardi Brothers, Inc. [and
driven  by  its  employee,  Kenneth  H.  Graves,  both  defendants].  After
trial, a jury found no negligence on the part of [defendants]. [Plaintiff]
argues the jury was incorrectly instructed and, as a result, found as it
did thereby prejudicing him. He raises the following issues on appeal:
Did  the  court  err  in  instructing  the  jury  that  it  was  not  to  consider  a
person’s skills in determining whether that person is negligent?

We will reverse and remand.
Around  7:30  a.m.,  February  22,  1980,  a  collision  occurred
approximately  nine  miles  west  of  Rock  Springs,  Wyoming  in  the
westbound lane of Interstate Highway 80 involving a pickup driven by
[plaintiff] and [defendant’s] cement truck. At the time of the accident,
the  road  was  icy  and  very  slick;  witnesses  described  it  as  covered
with  “black  ice.”  Just  prior  to  the  accident  [plaintiff]  had  difﬁculty
controlling his vehicle and began to “ﬁshtail” on the ice. He eventually
lost control of his vehicle and started to slide. Graves, who had been
approaching  appellant  from  behind  at  a  speed  of  35-40  m.p.h.,
attempted  to  pass  appellant’s  swerving  vehicle  ﬁrst  on  the  left  side,
then the right. He too, thereafter, lost control of his cement truck and
the  two  vehicles  collided.  It  was  from  that  accident  that  [plaintiff]
brought  suit  to  recover  damages  for  the  numerous  injuries  he
suffered.

By his own admission, Graves at the time of the accident was an
experienced,  professional  truck  driver  with  over  ten  years  of  truck
driving  experience.  He  possessed  a  class  “A”  driver’s  license  which
entitled him to drive most types of vehicles including heavy trucks. He
had attended the Wyoming Highway Patrol’s defensive driver course

and had kept up-to-date with various driving safety literature. He was
the senior driver employed by DeBernardi Brothers, Inc.

The  suit  was  tried  to  a  jury  on  the  issues  of  [defendant’s]
negligence as well as the degree, if any, of [plaintiff’s] own negligence.
After a four-day trial, the jury was instructed and received the case for
their  consideration.  They  found  no  negligence  on  the  part  of
[defendants]. Judgment was entered on the jury verdict and [plaintiff]
moved for a new trial claiming the jury was improperly instructed. The
district court took no action on the motion; it was deemed denied in
sixty days. This appeal followed.

[Plaintiff]  calls  our  attention  to  and  alleges  as  error  [that]  the

district court . . . instructed the jury that:

Negligence  is  the  lack  of  ordinary  care.  It  is  the  failure  of  a  person  to  do
something  a  reasonable,  careful  person  would  do,  or  the  act  of  a  person  in
doing  something  a  reasonable,  careful  person  would  not  do,  under
circumstances  the  same  or  similar  to  those  shown  by  the  evidence.  The  law
does  not  say  how  a  reasonable,  careful  person  would  act  under  those
circumstances, as that is for the Jury to decide.

A reasonable, careful person, whose conduct is set up as a standard, is not
the extraordinarily cautious person, nor the exceptionally skillful one, but rather
a person of reasonable and ordinary prudence.

In  chambers,

[plaintiff’s]  counsel  made  timely  and  speciﬁc
objections  to  [these]  instructions.  .  .  .  [Plaintiff’s]  counsel  .  .  .  argued
the jury is at least allowed to take cognizance of any knowledge and
skill  he  possesses;  therefore,  the  instruction’s  second  paragraph
should be deleted.
We agree.
That  language  is  an  apparent  attempt  to  enlarge  upon  the
reasonable  man  standard.  In  that  attempt  to  explain  the  reasonable
man concept, however, the instruction goes too far. It contradicts the
correct  statement  of  the  law  contained  in  the  ﬁrst  paragraph  of  the
instruction. Simply put, the ﬁrst paragraph of the instruction correctly
states  that  negligence  is  the  failure  to  exercise  ordinary  care  where

ordinary  care  is  that  degree  of  care  which  a  reasonable  person  is
expected  to  exercise  under  the  same  or  similar  circumstances.  The
trial  court’s  instruction  ﬁrst  allows  the  jury  to  consider  the  parties’
acts as compared to how the reasonable person would act in similar
circumstances  and  then  limits  the  circumstances  the  jury  can
consider  by  taking  out  of  their  purview  the  circumstances  of
exceptional  skill  or  knowledge  which  are  a  part  of  the  totality  of
circumstances.

At a minimum, as Justice Holmes once said, the reasonable man
is  required  to  know  what  every  person  in  the  community  knows.
Holmes,  Common  Law  p.  57  (1881).  In  a  similar  vein,  Professor
Prosser  notes  there  is,  at  least,  a  minimum  standard  of  knowledge
attributable  to  the  reasonable  man  based  upon  what  is  common  to
the  community.  Prosser,  supra  at  pp.  159-160.  Prosser  went  on  to
say, however, that although the reasonable man standard provides a
minimum  standard  below  which  an  individual’s  conduct  will  not  be
permitted to fall, the existence of knowledge, skill, or even intelligence
superior  to  that  of  an  ordinary  man  will  demand  conduct  consistent
therewith.  Along  that  same  line,  Restatement,  Torts  2d  §289  (1965)
provides:

The actor is required to recognize that his conduct involves a
risk of causing an invasion of another’s interest if a reasonable
man would do so while exercising

(a)  such  attention,  perception  of  the  circumstances,
memory,  knowledge  of  other  pertinent  matters,  intelligence,
and judgment as a reasonable man would have; and

(b)  such  superior  attention,  perception,  memory,
knowledge,  intelligence,  and  judgment  as  the  actor  himself
has.

Section  289  comment  m  expands  further  on  the  effect  of  superior
qualities of an individual when it states:

m.  Superior  qualities  of  actor.  The  standard  of  the  reasonable  man  requires
only a minimum of attention, perception, memory, knowledge, intelligence, and
judgment in order to recognize the existence of the risk. If the actor has in fact
more  than  the  minimum  of  these  qualities,  he  is  required  to  exercise  the
superior qualities that he has in a manner reasonable under the circumstances.
The  standard  becomes,  in  other  words,  that  of  a  reasonable  man  with  such
superior attributes.

The  instruction  given  by  the  trial  court  could  easily  have  been
construed  by  the  jury  to  preclude  their  consideration  of  exceptional
skill or knowledge on the part of either party which the evidence may
have  shown.  In  determining  negligence  the  jury  must  be  allowed  to
consider  all  of  the  circumstances  surrounding  an  occurrence,
including  the  characteristics  of  the  actors  in  reaching  their  decision.
Where,  as  here,  there  was  evidence  from  which  the  jury  could  have
concluded  appellee  Graves  was  more  skillful  than  others  as  a  result
of his experience as a driver, they should be allowed to consider that
as  one  of  the  circumstances  in  reaching  their  decision.  The  second
paragraph  of  [the  challenged  instruction],  as  [plaintiff]  points  out,
could  easily  have  misled  the  jury  into  disregarding  what  they  may
have  found  from  the  evidence  regarding  [defendant’s]  skill  and  as
language  of  the
such  prejudiced  appellant.  The  objectionable
instruction  is  surplus  language  which,  rather  than  clarifying  the
ﬁctional concept of the reasonable person, actually unduly limited it.
Therefore, because [this] instruction was both an incorrect statement
of  the  law  and  more  importantly  very  probably  misleading,  we  hold
that  the  trial  court  committed  reversible  error  in  using  it  to  instruct
the jury.

B. Physical Disability

Are  the  physical  attributes  of  the  actor  in  question  one  of  the
circumstances  considered  in  analyzing  “reasonable  care  under  the
circumstances”? We have just explored differing rules regarding how
below-  versus  above-average
is  considered.  One
potential argument against considering the actor’s physical attributes
(or  disability)  is  that  this  trends  toward  a  variable  standard  of  care
dependent  upon  the  actor  in  question.  The  more  such  idiosyncratic
variables  factor  into  the  analysis,  the  greater  the  shift  is  toward  a
subjective  standard.  On  the  other  hand,  is  it  reasonable  to  assume

intelligence

that  a  blind  person  will  act  the  same  as  someone  without  a  vision
disability?

POYNER v. LOFTUS
694 A.2d 69 (D.C. Ct. App. 1997)

       , J.

This action for personal injuries was brought by William J. Poyner,
who  is  legally  blind,  after  he  fell  from  an  elevated  walkway.  The  trial
in  favor  of  the  defendants,
judge  granted  summary
concluding  that  Mr.  Poyner  was  contributorily  negligent  as  a  matter
of law. On appeal, Mr. Poyner contends that, in light of his handicap, a
genuine  issue  of  material  fact  existed  as  to  whether  he  exercised
reasonable  care,  and  that  the  entry  of  summary  judgment  was
therefore erroneous. We afﬁrm.

judgment

The essential evidentiary facts are undisputed. Mr. Poyner suffers
from glaucoma and retrobulbar neuritis. He testiﬁed that he is able to
see  approximately  six  to  eight  feet  in  front  of  him.  Notwithstanding
his handicap, Mr. Poyner does not use a cane or a seeing eye dog in
pursuing his daily activities.

On August 24, 1993, Mr. Poyner was proceeding from his home to
Parklane Cleaners, a dry cleaning establishment located on the west
side  of  the  4300  block  of  Connecticut  Avenue,  N.W.  in  Washington,
D.C.  The  entrance  to  Parklane  Cleaners  is  adjacent  to  an  inclined
platform  which  is  located  approximately  four  feet  above  street  level.
Mr.  Poyner  testiﬁed  that  he  had  walked  by  the  area  on  three  or  four
previous occasions, and that he was aware of the general layout. He
stated  that  there  were  bushes  along  the  edge  of  the  platform,  and
that these bushes provided a natural barrier which would prevent him
from falling if he attempted to walk too far. On the day of the accident,
however,  and  unbeknownst  to  Mr.  Poyner,  one  of  the  bushes  was

missing,  and  there  was  thus  nothing  to  restrain  him  from  falling  off
the platform.

Mr.  Poyner  testiﬁed  that  as  he  was  walking  along  the  elevated
area,  he  heard  someone  call  “Billy!”  from  Connecticut  Avenue.  He
turned  his  head  to  the  right,  but  continued  to  walk  forward  to  the
location  at  the  end  of  the  platform  where  he  thought  that  a  bush
would be. There was no bush, however, and Mr. Poyner fell, suffering
personal injuries.

Mr. Poyner brought suit against several defendants, including the
owners  of  the  building,  the  property  manager  in  charge  of  its
maintenance,  and  the  proprietor  of  Parklane  Cleaners.  After  the
parties had conducted discovery, the defendants moved for summary
inter  alia,  that  Mr.  Poyner  had  been
judgment,  contending,
contributorily negligent as a matter of law. The trial judge granted the
motion, and she stated her reasons, in pertinent part, as follows:

Here we have a plaintiff who is partially visually impaired, legally blind, who can
see  some  in  front  of  him  and  gets  about  without  the  assistance  of  any
mechanical or other disability aids.

He was aware, as he was approaching this area to enter the cleaners, that
he  was  on  an  elevated  surface.  He  was  not  paying  full  attention,  having  been
distracted  by  a  call  from  someone  out  in  the  street.  And  according  to  the
plaintiff’s  own  testimony  at  his  deposition,  [he]  continued  to  proceed  forward
and went over the edge into the lower — falling from the part where the bushes
were, into the lower stairwell, and sustained injuries.

Mr.  Poyner’s  actions,  in  the  court’s  judgment,  clearly  violate  an  objective
reasonableness  standard.  .  .  .  No  reasonable  jurors  could  conclude  that  the
plaintiff  was  not  negligent  when  he  continued  to  walk  on  an  elevated  surface
with  limited  vision  while  his  head  was  turned  away  from  the  direction  of  his
travel in an area in which he was not very familiar.

Ordinarily,  questions  of  negligence  and  contributory  negligence
must be decided by the trier of fact. A party asserting the defense of
contributory  negligence  is  required  to  establish,  by  a  preponderance
of  the  evidence,  that  the  plaintiff  failed  to  exercise  reasonable  care.
“Only  in  the  exceptional  case  is  evidence  so  clear  and  unambiguous

that  contributory  negligence  should  be  found  as  a  matter  of  law.”
Tilghman  v.  Johnson,  513  A.2d  1350,  1351  (D.C.  1986)  (citations
omitted).

The trial judge concluded that this was one of those rare cases in
which contributory negligence — a defense with respect to which the
defendants  had  the  burden  of  proof — had  been  established  as  a
matter  of  law.  We  agree.  Indeed,  we  are  satisﬁed,  as  was  the  trial
judge,  that  Mr.  Poyner’s  own  testimony  established  that  he  did  not
exercise  reasonable  care  and  that  his  own  contributory  negligence
proximately caused the accident.

It  is  undisputed  that,  at  the  time  of  the  accident,  a  shrub  at  the
end  of  the  elevated  platform  was  missing.  A  photograph  which  is  a
part  of  the  record  demonstrates  that  this  was  readily  apparent,  at
least to any sighted person who chose to look. “[A] person must see
what is reasonably there to be seen.” Jackson v. Schenick,  174  A.2d
353,  355  (D.C.  1961)  (citation  omitted).  In  this  case,  Mr.  Poyner
acknowledged  that  his  attention  was  distracted  when  someone
called  his  name,  and  that  he  turned  his  head  to  the  right,  but
continued  to  walk  forward.  At  the  critical  moment,  according  to  his
own testimony, Mr. Poyner, who could see six to eight feet in front of
him and was aware of his handicap, did not look where he was going.
Mr.  Poyner  argues,  however,  that  he  is  not  a  sighted  person,  and
that “it is reasonable for a legally blind person  .  .  .  as  a  response  to
his  name  being  called,  [to]  turn  towards  the  direction  of  his  caller,
reach  for  the  handle  and  continue  his  step  towards  the  door.”
(Emphasis  added.)  He  claims  that  those  actions  “do  not  constitute
contributory  negligence.”  He  contends,  in  other  words,  that  on
account  of  his  visual  impairment,  his  conduct  should  be  tested
against a different standard of care.

The  parties  have  cited  no  authority  on  this  issue,  and  we  have
found  no  applicable  case  law  in  the  District  of  Columbia.  The
precedents in other jurisdictions, however, support afﬁrmance of the

trial  court’s  order.  “It  seems  to  be  the  general  rule  that  a  blind  or
otherwise  handicapped  person,  in  using  the  public  ways,  must
exercise for his own safety due care, or care commensurate with the
known  or  reasonably  foreseeable  dangers.  Due  care  is  such  care  as
an ordinarily prudent person with the same disability would exercise
under  the  same  or  similar  circumstances.”  Cook  v.  City  of  Winston-
Salem,  85  S.E.2d  696,  700-01  (N.C.  1955)  (citing,  inter  alia,  Keith  v.
Worcester & Blackstone Valley St. Ry. Co., 82 N.E. 680 (Mass. 1907)).
As the court explained in Keith, however,

[I]t  is  also  correct  to  say  that  in  the  exercise  of  common  prudence  one  of
defective  eyesight  must  usually  as  a  matter  of  general  knowledge  take  more
care and employ keener watchfulness in walking upon the streets and avoiding
obstructions  than  the  same  person  with  good  eyesight,  in  order  to  reach  the
standard established by the law for all persons alike, whether they be weak or
strong, sound or deﬁcient.

82 N.E. at 681.

In Smith v. Sneller, 26 A.2d 452 (Pa. 1942), the Supreme Court of
Pennsylvania considered a situation similar to the one before us, and
its  disposition  is  instructive.  Sneller,  a  plumbing  contractor,  had
removed  a  portion  of  the  sidewalk  and  had  dug  a  trench  in  order  to
make  a  sewer  connection.  On  the  north  side  of  the  trench,  Sneller
constructed  a  barricade.  On  the  south  side,  however,  Sneller  simply
left  a  pile  of  earth  two  feet  high.  The  plaintiff,  Smith,  was  walking
north along the sidewalk towards the trench. As a result of defective
eyesight,  he  failed  to  see  the  pile  of  earth.  Mr.  Smith  fell  into  the
trench, and sustained personal injuries. A jury returned a verdict in his
favor.

The  intermediate  appellate  court  expressed  sympathy  for  Mr.
Smith “in his effort to make a living in spite of his physical handicap,”
but  nevertheless  felt  constrained  to  reverse  the  decision  and  enter
judgment n.o.v. in Sneller’s favor. Smith appealed to the Pennsylvania
Supreme Court, which afﬁrmed the judgment. Noting that Mr. Smith’s

vision was so defective that he could not see a dangerous condition
immediately  in  front  of  him,  and  that  the  accident  could  have  been
the  common  well-known
“one  of
avoided
compensatory  devices  for  the  blind,  such  as  a  cane,  a  ‘seeing  eye’
dog, or a companion,” the court concluded:

if  he  had  used

Plaintiff’s  conduct  was  not  equal  to  the  degree  of  care  required  of  him.  The
Superior  Court  very  properly  said:  “A  blind  man  may  not  rely  wholly  upon  his
other senses to warn him of danger but must use the devices usually employed,
to  compensate  for  his  blindness.  Only  by  so  doing  can  he  go  about  with
comparative  safety  to  himself.”  We  are  in  accord  with  that  learned  court,  that
plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law, and we must,
therefore, afﬁrm the judgment.

26 A.2d at 454.

The reasoning of the court in Smith applies equally to the present
case. Here, as in Smith, the plaintiff was walking alone, and he did not
use  a  guide  dog  or  a  cane.  As  a  result,  he  fell  from  the  walkway.
Indeed, the evidence of contributory negligence is stronger here than
in Smith, for Mr. Poyner, who could see six to eight feet in front of him,
acknowledged  that,  at  the  moment  that  he  fell,  he  was  not  looking
where he was going.

In Coker v. McDonald’s Corp., 537 A.2d 549 (Del. Super. 1987), the
legally  blind  plaintiff  was  walking  to  the  entrance  of  a  McDonald’s
restaurant  from  the  parking  lot.  Unlike  the  plaintiffs  in  Smith  and  in
the present case, however, she was carrying a cane in her right hand,
and she was holding on to a companion with her left hand. Ms. Coker
lost her balance while attempting to navigate around an obstruction,
and  she  sustained
injuries.  The  defendant  claimed  that  the
obstruction  was  “open  and  obvious,”  and  that  the  plaintiff  was
contributorily negligent as a matter of law. The court disagreed:

A  blind  person  is  not  bound  to  discover  everything  which  a  person  of  normal
vision would. He is bound to use due care under the circumstances. Due care
for  a  blind  person  includes  a  reasonable  effort  to  compensate  for  his

unfortunate  affliction  by  use  of  artiﬁcial  aids  for  discovery  of  obstacles  in  his
path. When an effort in this direction is made, it will ordinarily be a jury question
whether or not such effort was a reasonable one.

Id.  at  550-51  (emphasis  in  original)  (citations  and  internal  quotation
marks omitted). Characterizing the issue presented as being whether
Ms.  Coker  acted  reasonably  under  the  circumstances,  the  court
concluded that “where the blind plaintiff is not using any aid, . . . as in
Smith v. Sneller, supra, a court could rule as a matter of law that the
plaintiff  was  contributorily  negligent.”  Id.  at  551.  Because  Ms.  Coker
was using two different aids, however — the cane and the companion
— the  question  of  contributory  negligence  was  for  the  jury,  and  the
defendant was not entitled to summary judgment. Id.

We agree with the analysis of the courts both in Smith v. Sneller
and  in  Coker.  Like  the  plaintiff  in  Smith,  but  unlike  the  plaintiff  in
Coker, Mr. Poyner was alone, and he used neither a cane nor a seeing
eye  dog.  He  also  looked  away  at  the  critical  moment.  Under  these
circumstances,  he  was  contributorily  negligent  as  a  matter  of  law,
and summary judgment was properly granted.

C. Mental Disability

Just as one’s immutable physical disabilities must, in all fairness, be
considered  as  a  “circumstance”  in  analyzing  our  expectations  for
reasonable  care,  one  would  expect  that  mental  disabilities  of  the
actor would likewise be factored into the analysis. Yet as we will see
below, courts have long held that mental impairment is not an excuse
for  conduct
that  would  otherwise  be  considered  careless.
Interestingly,  the  original  philosophical  impetus  for  the  rule — that
those with mental impairment should be institutionalized — has fallen
into  disfavor.  Yet  the  rule  remains  the  same.  Consider  whether  the
modern  justiﬁcation  for  this  old  rule  is  sufﬁciently  compelling.
Notwithstanding  its  acceptance  of  this  rule  of  law,  the  court  below

nevertheless  ﬁnds  in  favor  of  the  defendant  for  reasons  more
fundamental  than  our  deﬁnition  of  reasonable  care — it  ultimately
concludes that the actor owed no duty of care whatsoever.

CREASY v. RUSK
730 N.E.2d 659 (Ind. 2000)

        , J.

Carol  Creasy,  a  certiﬁed  nursing  assistant,  sued  Lloyd  Rusk,  an
Alzheimer’s patient, for injuries she suffered when he kicked her while
she  was  trying  to  put  him  to  bed.  We  hold  that  adults  with  mental
disabilities  have  the  same  general  duty  of  care  toward  others  as
those  without.  But  we  conclude  that  the  relationship  between  the
parties and public policy considerations here are such that Rusk had
no such duty to Creasy.

BACKGROUND

In  July,  1992,  Lloyd  Rusk’s  wife  admitted  Rusk  to  the  Brethren
Healthcare  Center  (“BHC”)  because  he  suffered  from  memory  loss
and  confusion  and  Rusk’s  wife  was  unable  to  care  for  him.  Rusk’s
primary diagnosis was Alzheimer’s disease. Over the course of three
years  at  BHC,  Rusk  experienced  periods  of  anxiousness,  confusion,
depression,  disorientation,  and  agitation.  Rusk  often  resisted  when
staff members attempted to remove him from prohibited areas of the
facility.  On  several  occasions,  Rusk  was  belligerent  with  both  staff
and other residents. In particular, Rusk was often combative, agitated,
and aggressive and would hit staff members when they tried to care
for him.

BHC  had  employed  Creasy  as  a  certiﬁed  nursing  assistant  for
nearly  20  months  when  the  incident  at  issue  occurred.  Creasy’s
responsibilities  included  caring  for  Rusk  and  other  patients  with

Alzheimer’s  disease.  Residents  with  Alzheimer’s  had  bruised  Creasy
during  the  course  of  her  work  for  BHC,  and  Creasy  knew  that  Rusk
had Alzheimer’s disease.

On May 16, 1995, Creasy and another certiﬁed nursing assistant,
Linda  Davis,  were  working  through  their  routine  of  putting  Rusk  and
other  residents  to  bed.  Creasy  knew  that  Rusk  had  been  “very
agitated and combative that evening.” By Creasy’s account:

[Davis] was helping me put Mr. Rusk to bed. She was holding his wrists to keep
him from hitting us and I was trying to get his legs to put him to bed. He was
hitting and kicking wildly. During this time, he kicked me several times in my left
knee  and  hip  area.  My  lower  back  popped  and  I  yelled  out  with  pain  from  my
lower back and left knee.

Creasy ﬁled a civil negligence suit against Rusk, seeking monetary
damages  for  the  injuries  she  suffered  as  a  result  of  Rusk’s  conduct.
Rusk  moved  for  summary  judgment  and  the  trial  court  granted  his
motion.  Creasy  appealed.  The  Court  of  Appeals  reversed,  holding
“that a person’s mental capacity, whether that person is a child or an
adult,  must  be  factored  [into]  the  determination  of  whether  a  legal
duty exists,” and that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to the
level of Rusk’s mental capacity.

This case requires us to decide two distinct questions of Indiana

common law:

(1)  Whether  the  general  duty  of  care  imposed  upon  adults  with
mental  disabilities  is  the  same  as  that  for  adults  without  mental
disabilities?

(2)  Whether  the  circumstances  of  Rusk’s  case  are  such  that  the
general duty of care imposed upon adults with mental disabilities
should be imposed upon him?

In  many,  if  not  most,  jurisdictions,  the  general  duty  of  care
imposed  on  adults  with  mental  disabilities  is  the  same  as  that  for
adults without mental disabilities. See Restatement (Second) of Torts

§283B  (1965).  Adults  with  mental  disabilities  are  held  to  the  same
standard  of  care  as  that  of  a  reasonable  person  under  the  same
circumstances  without  regard  to  the  alleged  tortfeasor’s  capacity  to
control or understand the consequences of his or her actions.

Judge Kirsch, writing for the Court of Appeals in this case, found
that  Indiana  law  does  not  follow  the  Restatement  rule.  The  Court  of
Appeals held “that a person’s mental capacity, whether that person is
a  child  or  an  adult,  must  be  factored  [into]  the  determination  of
whether a legal duty exists.” Creasy v. Rusk, 696 N.E.2d 442, 446 (Ind.
Ct. App. 1998). We believe that the Court of Appeals accurately stated
Indiana law but that the law is in need of revision.

[T]he generally accepted rule in jurisdictions other than Indiana is
that  mental  disability  does  not  excuse  a  person  from  liability  for
“conduct  which  does  not  conform  to  the  standard  of  a  reasonable
man  under  like  circumstances.”  Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts
§283B;  accord  Restatement  (Third)  of  Torts  §9(c)  (Discussion  Draft
Apr.  5,  1999)  (“Unless  the  actor  is  a  child,  the  actor’s  mental  or
emotional disability is not considered in determining whether conduct
is  negligent.”).  People  with  mental  disabilities  are  commonly  held
liable  for  their  intentional  and  negligent  torts.  No  allowance  is  made
for  lack  of  intelligence,  ignorance,  excitability,  or  proneness  to
accident.

The public policy reasons most often cited for holding individuals
with mental disabilities to a standard of reasonable care in negligence
claims include the following.

(1)  Allocates  losses  between  two  innocent  parties  to  the  one  who

caused or occasioned the loss.

(2) Provides incentive to those responsible for people with disabilities
and interested in their estates to prevent harm and “restrain” those
who are potentially dangerous.

(3)  Removes  inducements  for  alleged  tortfeasors  to  fake  a  mental
disability in order to escape liability. The Restatement mentions the

ease  with  which  mental  disability  can  be  feigned  as  one  possible
basis for this policy concern.

(4)  Avoids  administrative  problems  involved  in  courts  and  juries
attempting  to  identify  and  assess  the  signiﬁcance  of  an  actor’s
disability.

(5) Forces persons with disabilities to pay for the damage they do if
they  [are  to  live  in  the  world.].  The  Restatement  adds  that  it  is
better that the assets, if any, of the one with the mental deﬁciency
be  used  “to  compensate  innocent  victims  than  that  [the  assets]
remain in their hands.”

To  assist  in  deciding  whether  Indiana  should  adopt  the  generally
accepted  rule,  we  turn  to  an  examination  of  contemporary  public
policy in Indiana as embodied in enactments of our state legislature.

Since  the  1970’s,  Indiana  law  has  strongly  reflected  policies  to
deinstitutionalize people with disabilities and integrate them into the
least  restrictive  environment.  National  policy  changes  have  led  the
way  for  some  of  Indiana’s  enactments  in  that  several  federal  acts
either guarantee the civil rights of people with disabilities or condition
state  aid  upon  state  compliance  with  desegregation  and
integrationist practices.

These  legislative  developments  reflect  policies  consistent  with
those  supporting  the  Restatement  rule  generally  accepted  outside
in  that  they  reflect  a  determination  that  people  with
Indiana
disabilities  should  be  treated  in  the  same  way  as  non-disabled
persons.

We pause for a moment to consider in greater detail . . . that the
Restatement  rule  may  very  well  have  been  grounded  in  a  policy
determination  that  persons  with  mental  disabilities  should  be
institutionalized or otherwise conﬁned rather than “live in the world.” It
is  clear  from  our  recitation  of  state  and  federal  legislative  and
regulatory  developments  that  contemporary  public  policy  has
“strong
rejected

institutionalization  and  conﬁnement

for  a

professional consensus in favor of . . . community treatment . . . and
integration into the least restrictive . . . environment.” We observe that
it is a matter of some irony that public policies favoring the opposite
ends — institutionalization  and  conﬁnement  on  the  one  hand  and
community  treatment  and
least  restrictive
integration
environment  on  the  other — should  nevertheless  yield  the  same
common  law  rule:  that  the  general  duty  of  care  imposed  on  adults
with mental disabilities is the same as that for adults without mental
disabilities.

into  the

In  balancing  the  considerations  presented

in  the  foregoing
analysis,  we  reject  the  Court  of  Appeals’  approach  and  adopt  the
Restatement  rule.  We  hold  that  a  person  with  mental  disabilities  is
generally  held  to  the  same  standard  of  care  as  that  of  a  reasonable
person under the same circumstances without regard to the alleged
tortfeasor’s  capacity  to  control  or  understand  the  consequences  of
his or her actions.

We  turn  now  to  the  question  of  whether  the  circumstances  of
Rusk’s  case  are  such  that  the  general  duty  of  care  imposed  upon
adults  with  mental  disabilities  should  be  found  to  run  from  him  to
Creasy.

In  asking  this  question,  we  recognize  that  exceptions  to  the
general  rule  will  arise  where  the  factual  circumstances  negate  the
factors  supporting  imposition  of  a  duty  particularly  with  respect  to
relationship  and  public  policy
the  nature  of
considerations.

the  parties’

We ﬁnd that the relationship between Rusk and Creasy and public
policy concerns dictate that Rusk owed no duty of care to Creasy. See
Webb  v.  Jarvis,  575  N.E.2d  992,  995  (Ind.  1991)  (balancing  three
factors to determine whether an individual owes a duty to another: (1)
the relationship between the parties; (2) the reasonable foreseeability
of harm to the person injured; and (3) public policy concerns).

Unlike  the  typical  victim  supporting  the  Restatement  rationale,
Creasy was not a member of the public at large, unable to anticipate
or  safeguard  against  the  harm  she  encountered.  Creasy  knew  of
Rusk’s violent history. She could have changed her course of action or
requested additional assistance when she recognized Rusk’s state of
mind  on  the  evening  when  she  received  the  alleged  injury.  Rusk’s
inability  to  comprehend  the  circumstances  of  his  relationship  with
Creasy  and  others  was  the  very  reason  Creasy  was  employed  to
support  Rusk.  The  nursing  home  and  Creasy,  through  the  nursing
home,  were  “employed  to  encounter,  and  knowingly  did  encounter,
just the dangers which injured” Creasy. Anicet, 580 So. 2d at 276.

The  second  Restatement  policy  rationale  creates  an  inducement
for those responsible for a person with a mental disability to prevent
harm  to  others.  By  placing  Rusk  in  a  nursing  home,  we  presume
Rusk’s  wife  made  a  difﬁcult  decision  based  on  her  desire  to  prevent
Rusk from being violent and harming himself, herself, or others. Mrs.
Rusk entrusted her husband’s care, including prevention of the harm
he  might  bring  to  others,  to  the  nursing  home  staff  and  the  nursing
home.  And  as  a  business  enterprise,  the  nursing  home  received
compensation for its services.

With respect to the third policy rationale, “it is virtually impossible
to  imagine  circumstances  under  which  a  person  would  feign  the
symptoms  of  mental  disability  and  subject
to
commitment  to  an  institution  in  order  to  avoid  some  future  civil
liability.”  To  the  extent  that  such  circumstances  exist,  there  is  no
evidence  whatsoever  that  they  are  present  under  the  facts  in  this
case.

themselves

Finally,  there  are  no  administrative  difﬁculties  in  this  case  with
respect  to  determining  the  degree  and  existence  of  Rusk’s  mental
disability.  Under  the  relationship  analysis  set  forth  above  and  the
present policy analysis, it is unnecessary to determine the degree of
Rusk’s  mental  disability.  We  need  only  conclude  that  Rusk  had  a

mental  disability  which  served  as  the  reason  for  his  presence  in  the
nursing home and the foundation of his relationship with Creasy.

We  agree  with  Judge  Friedlander  .  .  .  that  there  was  no  material
question of fact as to the existence, let alone the advanced stage, of
Rusk’s  Alzheimer’s  disease  and  his  inability  to  appreciate  or  control
his violent behavior. Rusk was admitted to the nursing home because
he was confused and suffering from memory loss such that his wife
could  not  care  for  him.  By  May  1995,  when  Creasy  was  injured  by
Rusk, Rusk had been a resident of the nursing home for three years
and  his  condition  had  deteriorated.  He  regularly  displayed  behaviors
characteristic of a person with advanced Alzheimer’s disease such as
aggression, belligerence, and violence.

In addition to the public policy concerns behind the Restatement
rule, we ﬁnd that it would be contrary to public policy to hold Rusk to
a  duty  to  Creasy  when  it  would  place  “too  great  a  burden  on  him
because  his  disorientation  and  potential  for  violence  is  the  very
reason  he  was  institutionalized  and  needed  the  aid  of  employed
caretakers.”

Rusk  was  entitled  to  summary  judgment  because  public  policy
and  the  nature  of  the  relationship  between  Rusk,  Creasy,  and  the
nursing  home  preclude  holding  that  Rusk  owed  a  duty  of  care  to
Creasy under these factual circumstances.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Inferior  vs.  Superior  Knowledge  and  Skills.   In  Vaughan,  the
court  rejected  the  defendant  hayrick  builder’s  proposed  alternative
standard  that  would  have  evaluated  his  conduct  in  light  of  his,
apparently,  inferior  intelligence  or  skill.  The  court  rejected  this
because,  among  other  things,  it  would  adopt  a  standard  inﬁnitely
variable with each case. But isn’t this also the result of the decision by
courts,  such  as  in  Cervelli,  to  hold  gifted  and  talented  actors  to  a

higher  standard  of  care?  In  other  words,  if  the  reasonable  person
does  not  take  on  inferior  knowledge  and  skills,  why  does  the
reasonable  person  take  on  superior  knowledge  and  skills?  Consider
tort law’s purpose of deterring accidents. How might this purpose be
fulﬁlled  with  the  dichotomy  courts  have  adopted?  Is  it  helpful  to
consider  the  decision  by  courts  to  disallow  mental  impairment  as  a
defense to negligence as merely a logical extension of Vaughan?

2. Physical Disabilities vs. Mental Disabilities.  While it is often true
that  there  is  a  physical  explanation  for  or  cause  of  many  mental
disabilities,  the  mental  versus  physical  dichotomy  courts  recognize
focuses upon the manifestation of the disability itself in applying the
rules.  Thus,  while  a  traumatic  brain  injury  is  certainly  a  physical
problem,  the  actor’s  mental  disability  caused  by  the  physical
condition  will  be  considered  a  mental  disability  for  purposes  of
applying  negligence  rules.  Can  the  decisions  by  the  majority  of
courts, as demonstrated in Poyner and Creasy, to treat physical and
mental disabilities differently in negligence cases be reconciled? What
differences  exist  between  such  disabilities  that  would  justify  having
the  reasonable  person  take  on  the  physical  disabilities,  but  not  the
mental  ones?  With  consideration
the  Restatement’s  ﬁve
justiﬁcations  for  not  considering  mental  disability  (discussed  in
Creasy),  which  of  these  would  point  toward  a  different  rule  for
physical disabilities?

for

3. Mental  Impairment  as  a  Defense  for  Intentional  and  Accidental
Tort  Claims.   One  must  be  careful  about  the  context  where  we
encounter various doctrines and rules of law. In the unit on battery we
encountered  an  elderly  patient  at  a  nursing  home  with  mental
deﬁcits.  In  that  case,  the  court  was  asked  whether  the  law  of
Colorado required the plaintiff to prove merely that the defendant had
intended contact, or whether the defendant had also intended for the
contact to be harmful or offensive — the single vs. dual intent debate.
The  court  there  ruled  in  favor  of  the  dual  intent  requirement,  and
afﬁrmed  the  jury’s  fact  determination  that  the  particular  defendant

sued  did  not  appreciate  that  her  slapping  the  plaintiff  was  an
offensive contact. But the court also said there was no special rule for
the mentally inﬁrm — just that such persons were less likely to meet
the  dual  intent  requirement.  In  Creasy,  the  court  rules  ﬁrst  that  the
mentally  inﬁrm  will  have  the  same  standard  applied  to  them  in  a
negligence claim as a person of sound mind (i.e., that the reasonable
person  was  of  sound  mind).  But  then  the  court  negates  the  law’s
imposition  of  any  duty  of  care  under  the  facts  of  the  case.  In  what
ways,  therefore,
is  the  Creasy  decision  either  consistent  or
inconsistent with the prior battery case of White v. Muniz?

4. Problems.   How  does  tort  law  say  that  we  should  analyze  the

tort liability of the following persons?

A.  A  person  with  a  mental  impairment  ﬁnds  the  keys  to  an
automobile,  gets  in  it,  and  drives  down  the  road,  causing  an
accident when he swerves out of his lane.

B.  A  person  with  a  mental  impairment  is  a  patient  at  a  nursing
home. Sitting on the front porch of the facility in a rocking chair,
he decides to start randomly throwing rocks into the street. He
hits the mailman making a delivery to the mailbox of the facility
at the curb.

C.  A  blind  man  ﬁnds  the  keys  to  an  automobile,  gets  in  it,  and
drives  down  the  road,  causing  an  accident  when  he  fails  to
notice a red light and hits a pedestrian crossing the street.

D.  A  blind  man  is  walking  down  a  busy  sidewalk  when  he
accidentally bumps into a young mother pushing a stroller and
injures her infant.

E.  A  college  student  drinks  too  much  at  a  football  tailgate  event,
becomes  intoxicated,  and  loses  control  over  his  scooter  in  a
crowd  of  people.  See  e.g.,  Hamilton  v.  Kinsey,  337  So.2d  344
(Ala. 1976) (plaintiff, who was accused of unreasonable conduct
contributing  to  his  own  injuries  in  car  accident,  argued  that  his
intoxication was a defense to contributory negligence).

D. Children

It  is  sometimes  unclear  whether  courts’  recognition  of  certain  legal
doctrines set a path for society or merely follows the expectations of
society.  When  a  court  needs  to  determine  the  reasonableness  of  a
law  follows  the
child’s  conduct,  however,
expectations  of  the  citizenry.  Most  people  unschooled  in  the  law
would ﬁnd it monstrous to hold a child to the same expectations for
care as an adult. Tort law follows this school of thought by creating a
child standard of care for use in analyzing children’s conduct in many
scenarios. But this standard does not apply to any and all conduct by
children.

ROBINSON v. LINDSAY
598 P.2d 392 (Wash. 1979)

     , J.

An  action  seeking  damages  for  personal  injuries  was  brought  on
behalf of Kelly Robinson who lost full use of a thumb in a snowmobile
accident  when  she  was  11  years  of  age.  Billy  Anderson,  13  years  of
age  at  the  time  of  the  accident,  was  the  driver  of  the  snowmobile.
After a jury verdict in favor of Anderson, the trial court ordered a new
trial.

The  single  issue  on  appeal  is  whether  a  minor  operating  a
snowmobile is to be held to an adult standard of care. The trial court
failed to instruct the jury as to that standard and ordered a new trial
because it believed the jury should have been so instructed. We agree
and afﬁrm the order granting a new trial.

The trial court instructed the jury under WPI 10.05 that:

In considering the claimed negligence of a child, you are instructed that it is the
duty of a child to exercise the same care that a reasonably careful child of the

same  age,  intelligence,  maturity,  training  and  experience  would  exercise  under
the same or similar circumstances.

[Plaintiff]  properly  excepted  to
the  giving  of  this  instruction
and to the court’s failure to give
an adult standard of care.

“All men make mistakes, but
only wise men learn from their
mistakes.”

Winston Churchill

The  question  of  what
standard  of  care  should  apply
to  acts  of  children  has  a  long
background.
historical
Traditionally, a flexible standard of care has been used to determine if
children’s  actions  were  negligent.  Under  some  circumstances,
however,  courts  have  developed  a  rationale  for  applying  an  adult
standard.

In the courts’ search for a uniform standard of behavior to use in
determining  whether  or  not  a  person’s  conduct  has  fallen  below
minimal  acceptable  standards,  the  law  has  developed  a  ﬁctitious
person,  the  “reasonable  man  of  ordinary  prudence.”  That  term  was
ﬁrst used in Vaughan v. Menlove, 132 Eng. Rep. 490 (1837).

Exceptions  to  the  reasonable  person  standard  developed  when
the  individual  whose  conduct  was  alleged  to  have  been  negligent
suffered  from  some  physical
impairment,  such  as  blindness,
deafness, or lameness. Courts also found it necessary, as a practical
matter,  to  depart  considerably  from  the  objective  standard  when
dealing with children’s behavior. Children are traditionally encouraged
to  pursue  childhood  activities  without  the  same  burdens  and
responsibilities  with  which  adults  must  contend.  See  Bahr,  Tort  Law
and  the  Games  Kids  Play,  23  S.D.L.  Rev.  275  (1978).  As  a  result,
courts  evolved  a  special  standard  of  care  to  measure  a  child’s
negligence in a particular situation.

joined  “the  overwhelming  weight  of  authority”

distinguishing between the capacity of a child and that of an adult.

The current law in this state is fairly reflected in WPI 10.05, given
in this case. In the past we have always compared a child’s conduct
to  that  expected  of  a  reasonably  careful  child  of  the  same  age,
intelligence, maturity, training and experience. This case is the ﬁrst to
consider  the  question  of  a  child’s  liability  for  injuries  sustained  as  a
result of his or her operation of a motorized vehicle or participation in
an inherently dangerous activity.

Courts  in  other  jurisdictions  have  created  an  exception  to  the
special  child  standard  because  of  the  apparent  injustice  that  would
occur if a child who caused injury while engaged in certain dangerous
activities  were  permitted  to  defend  himself  by  saying  that  other
children similarly situated would not have exercised a degree of care
higher  than  his,  and  he  is,  therefore,  not  liable  for  his  tort.  Some
courts  have  couched  the  exception  in  terms  of  children  engaging  in
an activity which is normally one for adults only. See,  e.g., Dellwo v.
Pearson,  259  Minn.  452,  107  N.W.2d  859,  97  A.L.R.2d  866  (1961)
(operation of a motorboat). We believe a better rationale is that when
the  activity  a  child  engages  in  is  inherently  dangerous,  as  is  the
operation  of  powerful  mechanized  vehicles,  the  child  should  be  held
to an adult standard of care.

Such a rule protects the need of children to be children but at the
same  time  discourages  immature  individuals  from  engaging  in
inherently  dangerous  activities.  Children  will  still  be  free  to  enjoy
traditional childhood activities without being held to an adult standard
of  care.  Although  accidents  sometimes  occur  as  the  result  of  such
activities,  they  are  not  activities  generally  considered  capable  of
resulting  in  “grave  danger  to  others  and  to  the  minor  himself  if  the
care  used  in  the  course  of  the  activity  drops  below  that  care  which
the reasonable and prudent adult would use . . .” Daniels v. Evans, 107
N.H. 407, 408, 224 A.2d 63 (1966).

Other  courts  adopting  the  adult  standard  of  care  for  children
engaged in adult activities have emphasized the hazards to the public
if the rule is otherwise. We agree with the Minnesota Supreme Court’s
language in its decision in Dellwo v. Pearson, supra at 457-58:

Certainly  in  the  circumstances  of  modern  life,  where  vehicles  moved  by
powerful  motors  are  readily  available  and  frequently  operated  by  immature
individuals, we should be skeptical of a rule that would allow motor vehicles to
be  operated  to  the  hazard  of  the  public  with  less  than  the  normal  minimum
degree of care and competence.

Dellwo  applied  the  adult  standard  to  a  12-year-old  defendant
operating  a  motorboat.  Other  jurisdictions  have  applied  the  adult
standard  to  minors  engaged  in  analogous  activities.  Goodfellow  v.
Coggburn, 560 P.2d 873 (1977) (minor operating tractor); Williams v.
Esaw, 522 P.2d 950 (1974) (minor operating motorcycle); Perricone v.
DiBartolo, 302 N.E.2d 637 (1973) (minor operating gasoline-powered
minibike); Krahn v. LaMeres, 483 P.2d 522, 525-26 (Wyo. 1971) (minor
operating automobile). The holding of minors to an adult standard of
care  when  they  operate  motorized  vehicles  is  gaining  approval  from
an increasing number of courts and commentators.

The  operation  of  a  snowmobile  likewise  requires  adult  care  and
competence. Currently 2.2 million snowmobiles are in operation in the
United  States.  Studies  show  that  collisions  and  other  snowmobile
accidents  claim  hundreds  of  casualties  each  year  and  that  the
incidence  of  accidents  is  particularly  high  among  inexperienced
operators.

At the time of the accident, the 13-year-old petitioner had operated
snowmobiles  for  about  2  years.  When  the  injury  occurred,  petitioner
was  operating  a  30-horsepower  snowmobile  at  speeds  of  10  to  20
miles  per  hour.  The  record  indicates  that  the  machine  itself  was
capable  of  65  miles  per  hour.  Because  petitioner  was  operating  a
powerful motorized vehicle, he should be held to the standard of care
and conduct expected of an adult.

The order granting a new trial is afﬁrmed.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Adult vs. Child Standard of Care.  What is the difference between
the  adult  versus  child  standard  of  care  discussed  by  the  court  in
Robinson? If the child standard is typically applied to children in order
to  avoid  “monstrous”  results,  why  do  courts  revert  back  to  the  adult
standard  for  certain  dangerous  activities?  What  does  this  say  about
the law’s regard for the importance of allowing children to participate
in such conduct (by encouraging it)?

2. Objective  vs.  Subjective.   To  the  extent  that  the  child  standard
takes so many of the child-actor’s own traits into consideration, what
is left of the objective standard? Is the child standard a repudiation of
the Vaughan decision to employ an objective standard for negligence
analysis?  Are  we  simply  asking  if  the  child  acted  in  a  bona  ﬁde
manner? Even under the child standard of care, there is one attribute
that  is  held  inviolate — the  trait  of  reasonableness.  While  the  child
standard of care takes on many of the particular traits of the actor —
age,  intelligence,  and  experience — the  reasonably  prudent  child
the  circumstances.  The  age,
always
intelligence,  and  experience  may  impact  the  perceptions  of  danger
but, once perceived, the reasonably prudent child still makes prudent
decisions.

remains  careful  under

3.  Mentally  Impaired  Children.   Unlike  mentally  impaired  adults,
under the child standard of care, the mental impairment of a child is
factored  into  the  analysis  of  reasonable  care.  In  other  words,  the
reasonably  prudent  child  will  have  the  same  mental  acuity  as  the
actor in question.

4.  Maximum  and  Minimum  Ages  for  Child  Actors.   At  what  age
should  an  actor  no  longer  be  considered  a  “child”  and  eligible  for
application of the more lenient (and subjective) child standard of care

— 21, 18, 16? While courts are not uniform, many courts use the age
of 15 or 16 as deﬁning when an adult standard of care will be applied
to determine the issue of breach. On the other end of the spectrum,
courts  and  commentators  have  disagreed  over  whether  a  child  may
be  considered  too  young  to  be  considered  negligent  at  all  (even
applying the child standard of care). There have actually been courts
embracing one of three different views regarding the minimum age at
which  a  child  can  be  held  accountable  in  a  negligence  cause  of
action:

A.  Majority  view  (incorporated  into  the  Restatement  (Second)  of
Torts §283A) — that the jury should consider on a case-by-case
basis, utilizing the child standard of care, whether the child actor
was too young to have any appreciation for a risk of harm.

B.  “Illinois  Rule” — a  number  of  states  have  determined  that,  as  a
matter  of  law,  a  child  younger  than  the  age  of  seven  years  is
incapable of being negligent.

C.  Third  Restatement  Rule — Section  10(b)  of  the  Restatement
(Third) of Torts provides that: “A child less than ﬁve years of age
is  incapable  of  negligence”  (citing  the  lack  of  moral  blame  of
such  a  child  and  the  reality  that  holding  such  a  child  liable  for
negligence will in fact serve no deterrent function).

5.  Problems.   Which  standard  should  be  applied  to  children

involved in the following activities?

A.  Bowling — the  ball  comes  off  the  child’s  hands  injuring  a

bystander.

B.  One  child  handing  over  the  keys  to  mom’s  car  to  another
underage  driver — the  driver  carelessly  causes  an  accident.
Consider the negligence of the children separately.

C. Playing golf — the child hits an errant shot without yelling “fore”

and injures another golfer.

D.  Hunting — the  child  accidentally  shoots  another  hunter  in  the

woods.

“LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY . . .”

Idaho JI 2.02 Duty of Care — Minor Child

A  minor  child  has  a  duty  to  exercise  the  degree  of  care
which  would  reasonably  be  expected  of  an  ordinary  child  of
the  same  age,  maturity,  experience  and  knowledge  when
acting under similar circumstances.

E. Extraordinarily Dangerous Activities

We  have  already  witnessed  how  the  “reasonable  care  under  the
circumstances” standard is quite malleable, performing capably in the
requisite  analysis  of  many  different  scenarios.  But  maybe  some
circumstances  are  so  dangerous  that  the  reasonable  care  standard
itself  needs  adjustment.  Should  the  foreseeability  of  great  harm
demand  something  beyond  reasonable  care?  And  if  so,  how  would
this  be  articulated?  In  Stewart,  the  court  rejects  the  plaintiff’s
demands  for  an  altered  standard  under  the  circumstance  of  great
danger. The court believes that this is more than semantics. Do you
agree?

STEWART v. MOTTS
654 A.2d 535 (Pa. 1995)

         , J.

Appellant,  Jonathon  Stewart,  appeals  from  an  order  and
memorandum opinion of the Superior Court afﬁrming a judgment of
the Court of Common Pleas of Monroe County following a verdict in
favor of appellee, Martin Motts, in this action for personal injuries.

The  sole  issue  presented  before  us  is  whether  there  exists  a
higher  standard  of  “extraordinary  care”  for  the  use  of  dangerous
instrumentalities  over  and  above  the  standard  of  “reasonable  care”
such that the trial court erred for failing to give an instruction to the
jury  that  the  Appellee  should  have  used  a  “high  degree  of  care”  in
handling gasoline. Because we believe that there is but one standard
of care, the standard of “reasonable care,” we afﬁrm.

The  pertinent  facts  of  this  case  are  simple  and  were  ably  stated

by the trial court:

On  July  15,  1987,  Plaintiff,  Jonathon  Stewart,  stopped  at  Defendant,  Martin
Motts’ auto repair shop and offered assistance to the Defendant in repairing an
automobile  fuel  tank.  In  an  effort  to  start  and  move  the  car  with  the  gasoline
tank  unattached,  the  Plaintiff  suggested  and  then  proceeded  to  pour  gasoline
into  the  carburetor.  The  Defendant  was  to  turn  the  ignition  key  at  a  given
moment.  While  the  exact  sequence  of  events  was  contested,  the  tragic  result
was  that  the  car  backﬁred,  caused  an  explosion  and  resulted  in  Plaintiff
suffering severe burns to his upper body. On October 8, 1992, following a two-
day trial, a jury returned a verdict for the defendant thus denying the Plaintiff’s
claim for damages.

The  only  issue  raised  before  this  Court  is  the  refusal  of  the  trial
court  to  read  Stewart’s  requested  point  for  charge  No.  4.  This  point
for charge reads:

We  are  instructing  you  that  gasoline  due  to  its  inflammability  is  a  very
dangerous substance if not properly handled. . . . With an appreciation of such
danger, and under conditions where its existence reasonably should have been
known, there follows a high degree of care which circumscribes the conduct of
everyone  about  the  danger,  and  whether  the  parties  .  .  .  acted  as  reasonable
men under the circumstances is for you the jury to decide.

The  trial  court  denied  this  point  of  charge  ﬁnding  that  it  was
“cumulative  with  respect  to  the  standard  charge  given  by  the
Court. . . .” In this appeal, Stewart argues that the trial court erred in
failing to read point of charge No. 4 to the jury because Pennsylvania

law  applies  an  “extraordinary”  or  “heightened  duty  of  care”  to  those
employing a dangerous agency.

We begin our discussion by reafﬁrming the principle that there is
but one standard of care to be applied to negligence actions involving
dangerous instrumentalities in this Commonwealth. This standard of
care is “reasonable care” as well stated in the Restatement (Second)
of Torts:

The care required is always reasonable care. The standard never varies, but the
care  which  it  is  reasonable  to  require  of  the  actor  varies  with  the  danger
involved in his act and is proportionate to it. The greater the danger, the greater
the care which must be exercised. . . .

Restatement (Second) of Torts §298 comment b (1965).

Properly  read,  our  cases  involving  dangerous  agencies  reafﬁrm
these well accepted principles found in the Restatement. In Konchar
v. Cebular,  3  A.2d  913  (Pa.  1939),  .  .  .  the  plaintiff  drove  into  a  gas
station  and  ordered  a  gallon  of  gasoline.  The  defendant  began
pumping gas into the motorcycle, but when three-quarters of a gallon
was placed in the tank, the gasoline overflowed and ran into the hot
cylinders  of  the  engine.  The  plaintiff,  sitting  on  the  motorcycle,  was
burned  when  the  gasoline  exploded.  .  .  .  In  deciding  the  case,  this
Court  noted  that  gasoline  was  a  dangerous  substance  requiring  a
“high duty of care.” Konchar, 3 A.2d at 914. We afﬁrmed, holding that,
“it was for the jury to decide whether, under all of the circumstances,
[the  plaintiff]  had  acted  as  a  reasonably  prudent  man.”  Id.  Thus,  we
recognized that the question of the plaintiff’s contributory negligence
was to be determined using the reasonable care standard in light of
the particular circumstances of the case. One such circumstance, we
acknowledged,  was  that  gasoline,  a  dangerous  substance,  was
involved  requiring  that  the  reasonably  prudent  person  exercise  a
higher  degree  of  care  under  these  circumstances.  Taken  in  context,
our  statement  that  the  plaintiff  was  under  a  “high  duty  of  care”  did
nothing  more  than  reafﬁrm  the  general  principle  that  the  care

employed by a reasonable man must be proportionate to the danger
of the activity.

Admittedly, this notion of a heightened level of “extraordinary care”
for  the  handling  of  dangerous  agencies  has  crept
into  our
jurisprudence.  In  Kuhns  v.  Brugger,  135  A.2d  395  (Pa.  1957),  this
Court considered the proper standard of care for negligence involving
a  handgun.  The  defendant  in  this  case  was  a  grandfather  who  had
left  a  loaded  handgun  in  an  unlocked  dresser  drawer.  While  alone  in
the  house,  his  grandchild  found  the  gun  and  inadvertently  shot
another  child.  [W]e  found  that  the  possession  of  a  loaded  handgun
placed  upon  the  defendant  the  duty  of,  “exercising  not  simply
ordinary,  but  extraordinary  care  so  that  no  harm  might  be  visited
upon  others.”  This  language  in  Kuhns  on  its  face  unfortunately
suggests that this Commonwealth recognizes a separate standard of
care,  “extraordinary  care,”  for  dangerous  instrumentalities  above  and
beyond “ordinary care.” We reject this suggestion.

[T]he Kuhns Court did not create a standard of “extraordinary care”
for  all  dangerous  instrumentalities  as  advocated  by  the  appellant.
Instead, we believe that the Kuhns Court considered the danger of an
unattended  handgun  under  the  circumstances  of  this  case  and
fashioned a standard of care proportionate to that danger.

In summation, this Commonwealth recognizes only one standard
of care in negligence actions involving dangerous instrumentalities —
the  standard  of  reasonable  care  under  the  circumstances.  It  is  well
established  by  our  case  law  that  the  reasonable  man  must  exercise
care in proportion to the danger involved in his act. See MacDougall,
166 A. at 592 (“Vigilance must always be commensurate with danger.
A high degree of danger always calls for a high degree of care”).

With  these  principles  in  mind  we  must  next  examine  the  jury
instructions in this case. Reviewing the charge as a whole, we cannot
conclude that it was inadequate. The trial judge explained to the jury
that  negligence  is  “the  absence  of  ordinary  care  which  a  reasonably

prudent person would exercise in the circumstances here presented.”
The trial judge further explained:

It is for you to determine how a reasonably prudent person would act in those
circumstances.  Ordinary  care  is  the  care  a  reasonably  prudent  person  would
use  under  the  circumstances  presented  in  this  case.  It  is  the  duty  of  every
person to use ordinary care not only for his own safety and the protection of his
property,  but  also  to  avoid  serious  injury  to  others.  What  constitutes  ordinary
care  varies  according  to  the  particular  circumstances  and  conditions  existing
then and there. The amount of care required by law must be in keeping with the
degree of danger involved.

Id. at 158-59.

We  ﬁnd  that  this  charge,  when  read  as  a  whole,  adequately
instructed  the  jury.  The  charge  informed  the  jury  that  the  proper
standard  of  care  was  “reasonable”  or  “ordinary”  care  under  the
circumstances  in  accordance  with  the  law  of  this  Commonwealth.
The charge properly instructed the jury that the level of care required
changed  with  the  circumstances.  The  charge  also  informed  the  jury
that the level of care required increased proportionately with the level
of  danger  in  the  activity.  We  ﬁnd  nothing  in  this  charge  that  is
confusing,  misleading,  or  unclear.  From  these  instructions,  the  jury
had  the  tools  to  examine  the  circumstances  of  the  case  and
determine  that  the  defendant  was  required  to  exercise  a  “higher
degree of care” in using the dangerous agency of gasoline.

For  the  reasons  set  forth  above,  we  afﬁrm  the  order  of  the

Superior Court.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. One Standard of Care.  The court above summarizes its position
by  declaring  that
it  “recognizes  only  one  standard  of  care.”
Notwithstanding  this  position,  in  two  prior  cases  the  court  had
applied  a  standard  of  “extraordinary  care”  and  a  standard  of  “high

duty  of  care.”  Given  the  loose  use  of  such  language,  one  can
understand  the  frustration  of  the  plaintiff’s  counsel.  Nevertheless,
while  the  court  indicates  that  the  circumstance  of  extraordinary
danger does not necessitate a change in the standard, the court does
afﬁrm that the regular standard of care is flexible enough to demand
greater care in the face of such danger. How exactly does this work?
What instructions did the trial court give the jury to facilitate the jury’s
understanding of this proportionality principle?

2. Problems.   How  should  the  following  circumstances  impact  a
jury’s expectations for care, utilizing the flexible concept of a “duty of
reasonable  care  under  the  circumstances”?  Remember  that  the
inquiry must focus upon the nature of the foreseeable risk of harm at
the  time  of  the  actor’s  conduct,  and  is  not  to  be  viewed  with
hindsight.

A. A shipper of goods notices a liquid leaking from a crate. Without
realizing that the liquid is nitroglycerine, the shipper attempts to
open the crate and an explosion occurs hurting bystanders.

B. A clown is riding a motorcycle in a parade. The parade route is
flanked  by  large  crowds  of  spectators  clustered  close  to  the
street on both sides. The clown decides to show off by popping
wheelies, loses control, and runs over several spectators.

C. A motorist is driving to the top of the Continental Divide on Trail
Ridge Road in Colorado’s Rocky Mountain National Park. There
is no guardrail along the curves, and the exposure near some of
the  curves  is  several  thousand  feet.  The  motorist  decides  to
show  off  for  a  passenger  by  driving  as  close  to  the  edge  as
possible. A wheel catches the lip of the cliff and the driver loses
control, causing them to plummet to their deaths.

D.  A  motorist  is  traveling  on  a  state  highway  near  Lawton,
Oklahoma  (where  things  are  relatively  flat).  The  driver  is  bored
and  decides  to  see  how  close  he  can  come  to  the  edge  of  the
pavement. His tires veer off the edge of the highway and the car

spins out in the dirt, clipping the edge of a billboard and causing
some damage to it.

F. Sudden Emergency

Finally, given the reafﬁrmation that the reasonable care standard can
consider circumstances of grave danger without any adjustment, you
might  predict  that  this  stalwart  standard  would  need  no  elaboration
when applied to an emergency scenario. However, many courts have
traditionally felt it appropriate to enhance the normal reasonable care
jury instruction in cases where the actor faced a sudden emergency.
The  sudden  emergency
jury  the
circumstance in which an actor has decreased time for attention and
deliberation  when  facing  an  emergency  not  of  his  own  making.
Whether  this  truism  necessitates  additional  jury  instructions  is  a
matter hotly debated by courts today, with mixed results.

lane.  Seeing  Magnusson’s  car

In  November  1990,  Elmo  Knutson  was  driving  north  on  43rd
Avenue near Bell Road in Phoenix when Theresa Magnusson entered
43rd  Avenue  from  a  shopping  center  driveway  and  headed  south  in

accelerated  and  swerved  left,  avoiding  what  he  perceived  to  be  an
impending  head-on  collision.  In  doing  this,  he  crossed  the  double
yellow  line  into  oncoming  trafﬁc  and  collided  with  Bruce  Myhaver’s
pickup. Magnusson continued south not realizing she was involved. A
police  ofﬁcer  who  saw  the  accident  stopped  her  a  short  distance
away and asked her to return to the scene.

in  his

Myhaver  was  seriously  injured  as  a  result  of  the  collision  and
brought  a  damage  action  against  both  Knutson  and  Magnusson.
Magnusson  settled  and  was  named  as  a  non-party  at  fault,  and  the
Myhavers proceeded to trial against Knutson.

At trial, [the] judge instructed the jury as follows:

In  determining  whether  a  person  acted  with  reasonable  care  under  the
circumstances,  you  may  consider  whether  such  conduct  was  affected  by  an
emergency.

An  “emergency”  is  deﬁned  as  a  sudden  and  unexpected  encounter  with  a
danger which is either real or reasonably seems to be real. If a person, without
negligence  on  his  or  her  part,  encountered  such  an  emergency  and  acted
reasonably  to  avoid  harm  to  self  or  others,  you  may  ﬁnd  that  the  person  was
not  negligent.  This  is  so  even  though,  in  hindsight,  you  ﬁnd  that  under  normal
conditions some other or better course of conduct could and should have been
followed.

The  jury  found  Knutson  not  liable.  On  appeal,  the  Myhavers
argued  that  the  sudden  emergency  doctrine  [embodied  in  the  above
instruction]  should  be  abandoned.  Alternatively,  they  urged  that  the
trial  judge  erred  in  giving  the  instruction  under  the  facts  of  the  case
and that it constituted an impermissible comment on the evidence.

We  granted  review  to  consider  the  propriety  of  giving  the

instruction in this or any case.

[The]  sudden  emergency  instruction  tells  the  jury  that  in  the
absence  of  antecedent  negligence,  a  person  confronted  with  a
sudden emergency that deprives him of time to contemplate the best
reaction cannot be held to the same standard of care and accuracy of
choice  as  one  who  has  time  to  deliberate.  Criticism  of  this  doctrine
has  focused  on  its  ability  to  confuse  a  jury  as  to  whether  the
reasonable person standard of care or some lower standard, applies
in  an  emergency.  .  .  .  [A]  few  jurisdictions  have  abolished  sudden
emergency
in  automobile
accident cases, while others have discouraged their use, sometimes
placing speciﬁc restrictions on which cases are appropriate for their

instructions,  either  generally  or

just

use.  However,  several  jurisdictions  still  explicitly  retain  the  sudden
emergency  doctrine,  either  generally  or  with  the  qualiﬁcation  that
sudden emergency instructions are allowed but not required.

Commentators  on  Arizona’s  negligence  law  have  described  the

problem and the present state of our law as follows:

Conceptually, the emergency doctrine is not an independent rule. It is merely an
application of the general standard of reasonable care; the emergency is simply
one  of  the  circumstances  faced.  Arguably,  giving  a  separate  instruction  on
sudden emergency focuses the jury’s attention unduly on that aspect of a case.

Although criticizing the instruction and holding that it need not be
given,  other  states  leave  it  to  the  judge’s  discretion.  Massachusetts
has held that a judge may instruct the jury that emergency conditions
“are  a  factor  in  determining”  whether  a  party  acted  with  reasonable
care.  A  number  of  states  have  carefully  analyzed  the  issue  and
concluded that the instruction should not be routinely given in every
involve  an
claim  of  emergency.  By  deﬁnition,  most  accidents
emergency. These courts have concluded that the instruction should
be  discouraged  because  of  the  factors  already  mentioned,  though  it
may  be  given,  in  the  judge’s  discretion,  in  the  few  cases  presenting
true, unanticipated emergencies.

One  of  the  more  careful  analyses  of  the  subject  was  made  in
McKee  v.  Evans,  551  A.2d  260  (Pa.  Super.  1988).  The  Pennsylvania
court found that the instruction had been improperly given in favor of
a  driver  involved  in  a  ten-mile  pursuit.  The  court  concluded  that  the
instruction was not favored and should be given only in those cases
in  which  evidence  showed  that  (1)  the  party  seeking  the  instruction
had not been negligent prior to the emergency, (2) the emergency had
come  about  suddenly  and  without  warning,  and  (3)  reaction  to  the
emergency was spontaneous, without time for reflection. While these

factors  are  certainly  not  all  inclusive,  we  believe  they  help  describe
the situations to which the instruction should be conﬁned.

Having noted that the instruction is but a factor to be considered
in  determining  reasonable  care,  is  subsumed  within  the  general
concept of negligence, is a matter of argument rather than a principle
of law and can single out and unduly emphasize one factor and thus
mislead a jury, we join those courts that have discouraged use of the
instruction  and  urge  our  trial  judges  to  give  it  only  in  the  rare  case.
The  instruction  should  be  conﬁned  to  the  case  in  which  the
emergency  is  not  of  the  routine  sort  produced  by  the  impending
accident  but  arises  from  events  the  driver  could  not  be  expected  to
anticipate.

We do not, however, join those courts that absolutely forbid use of
the  instruction.  There  are  cases  in  which  the  instruction  may  be
useful  or  may  help  to  explain  the  need  to  consider  a  sudden
emergency  and  the  consequent  reflexive  actions  of  a  party  when
determining  reasonable  care.  We  believe,  however,  that  in  those  few
cases  in  which  the  instruction  is  given,  it  would  be  important  to
explain  that  the  existence  of  a  sudden  emergency  and  reaction  to  it
are only some of the factors to be considered in determining what is
reasonable  conduct  under  the  circumstances.  Even  though  a  judge
may exercise his discretion and give a sudden emergency instruction
in a particular case, it will rarely, if ever, be error to refuse to give it.

Applying these principles to the case at bench, we conclude that
the  trial  judge  did  not  abuse  his  discretion  in  giving  the  instruction.
This  is  a  case  in  which  there  was  no  evidence  of  antecedent
negligence  by  Knutson,  in  whose  favor  the  instruction  was  given.  In
light of the testimony of the various witnesses, there was no question
about  the  existence  of  an  emergency.  Knutson  was  faced  with  a
situation  not  ordinarily  to  be  anticipated  and  one  of  imminent  peril
when  Magnusson  pulled  out  of  the  shopping  center  and  suddenly
turned  toward  him  in  the  wrong  lane  of  trafﬁc.  Finally,  Knutson’s
reaction — swerving across the center line into the path of Myhaver’s

oncoming  vehicle — was  probably  both  reflexive  in  nature  and  the
type  of  conduct  that  absent  a  sudden  emergency  would  almost
automatically be found as negligence, if not negligence per se. Given
these  facts,  the  real  and  only  issue  was  whether  Knutson’s  conduct
was  reasonable  under  the  circumstances  of  the  emergency.  We
believe,  therefore,  the  trial  judge  had  discretion  to  instruct  on  the
sudden emergency as a factor in the determination of negligence.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Sudden Emergencies.  As the above case illustrates, the sudden
emergency  instruction  may  be  permitted,  but  is  not  viewed  as
indispensible. Other courts believe it should never be given because it
is simply unnecessary. At best then, the instruction might be viewed
as a luxury option for the actor whose conduct under an emergency
is  being  analyzed  under  the  traditional  reasonable  person  analysis.
The  good  advocate  should  be  armed  with  plenty  of  persuasive
arguments  for  a  ﬁnding  of  reasonableness,  depending  on  the  actual
circumstances. When the actor is facing a possible signiﬁcant injury
to  himself,  and  his  ability  to  perceive  the  potential  danger  of  his
conduct  is  lessened,  the  actor’s  conduct  is  then  an  understandable
attempt to save his own life. If another car is about to hit you head on,
you  may  not  have  the  luxury  of  time  to  look  around  you  to  plot  out
your best options. Rather, fueled by a legitimate desire to avoid your
own death, you reflexively swerve in one direction or another without
a chance to look where you are turning. Without the emergency, such
behavior  would  be  obviously  careless,  maybe  even  reckless.  But  the
sudden  emergency  circumstance,  which  is  already  permitted  to  be
considered  as  part  of  the  “under  the  circumstances”  description  of
reasonable care, changes our expectations for reasonableness.

2. Problem.  After pulling out of the shopping center and into the
wrong  lane,  Magnusson  suddenly  ﬁnds  herself  facing  trafﬁc  coming

directly  at  her.  Reflexively,  she  swerves  to  the  left  and  hits  a  child
selling  lemonade  at  a  sidewalk  stand.  In  the  negligence  suit  against
her,  she  seeks  to  invoke  the  sudden  emergency  instruction.  Should
she be entitled to it?

Upon Further Review

The foregoing materials portray a mixed bag in terms of how tort
law  treats  various  circumstances.  With  respect  to  the  mental
state of the actor, the reasonable person takes on the trait only
of  above-average  intelligence  and  experience  while  rejecting
consideration  of  mental  disability  or  below-average  mental
acuity.  Physical  disabilities  are  considered  on  the  other  hand.
Further,  while  the  same  standard  applies  equally  (permitting
consideration  of  both  grave  danger  and  a  sudden  emergency),
courts  will  only  consider  a  modiﬁed  instruction  with  respect  to
the latter. The standard seems to change most fundamentally in
the  case  of  children,  but  only  when  the  child  is  engaged  in  an
activity to which society deems it appropriate for such a child to
engage.  These  various  rules  seem  chaotic  at  ﬁrst  blush,  but
there  are  sound  rationales  behind  each  of  them.  Whether  the
lawyer  agrees  or  disagrees  with  such  distinctions,  competent

IV  PROVING BREACH OF DUTY

In a sense, by looking at case law discussing the meaning of the duty
of  reasonable  care,  we  have  already  seen  discussions  of  whether
particular  actors,  in  the  factual  contexts  of  those  cases,  had
breached  the  applicable  duty.  The  courts,  and  juries,  were  simply
applying  the  reasonable  person  standard  and  theorizing  how  the
hypothetical reasonable person would have acted. By then comparing
that theoretical conduct with the actual conduct of the defendant (or
plaintiff,  where  contributory  negligence  has  been  alleged),  the
factﬁnder  can  determine  if  the  actor  lived  up  to  that  reasonable
person  standard.  But  analysis  of  breach  can  be  more  sophisticated
than  what  we  have  seen  thus  far.  First,  we  will  consider  the  famous
Learned  Hand  Formula,  which  offers  a  mathematical  formula  for
analyzing  the  care  that  a  reasonable  person  would  undertake  to
prevent  an  accident.  Most  negligence  cases  are  analyzed,  either
explicitly  or  often  implicitly,  by  reference  to  this  formula’s  three-fold
factors. This formula allows for an express consideration of the most
important  factors  in  analyzing  reasonable  care,  so  that  the  process
becomes  somewhat  less  vaguely  intuitive.  But  there  are  other
potential tools, often considered short cuts, available for analyzing a
possible breach of the duty of reasonable care. We will consider the
impact  of  an  actor’s  violation  of  a  statutory  duty  as  evidence  of
breach of the duty of care. We will also see what role evidence of an
actor’s  compliance  with,  or  violation  of,  applicable  industry  customs
will  play  in  the  breach  determination.  Finally,  in  certain  instances
where we lack information about the defendant’s actual conduct, but
circumstances  strongly  suggest  a  negligent  act,  the  doctrine  of  res
ipsa  loquitur  will  be  available  to  assist  an  otherwise  out-of-luck
plaintiff.

A. The Learned Hand Formula

In 1946 in United States v. Carroll Towing Co., 159 F.2d 169, 173 (2d
Cir.  1947),  Judge  Learned  Hand  ﬁrst  employed  what  has  become
known as the Learned Hand formula — an economic or mathematical
illustrating  three  primary,  flexible  considerations  to  be
device
employed  in  analyzing  whether  the  reasonable  person  would  have
acted  differently  than  the  actor  accused  of  negligence.  The  case
concerned whether the defendant had employed sufﬁcient efforts to
prevent a ship from breaking from her moorings and causing damage
to others. He described the three variables’ application to that case in
this way:

(1) The probability that [the boat] will break away; (2) the gravity of
the  resulting  injury,  if  she  does;  and  (3)  the  burden  of  adequate
protections.  Possibly  it  serves  to  bring  this  notion  into  relief  to
state it in algebraic terms: if the probability be called P; the injury,
L; and the burden, B; liability depends upon whether B is less than
L multiplied by P; i.e., whether B<PL.

This  formula  has  become  so  ubiquitous  that

it’s  hard  to
contemplate  analysis  of  breach  of  the  duty  of  reasonable  care
without,  explicitly  or  implicitly,  a  consideration  of  these  variables.
Judge  Posner — another  standard-bearer  in  the  ﬁeld  of  law  and
economics — has  described  this  formula  as  “[t]he  analytically  (not
necessarily operationally) most precise” way to analyze breach of the
duty  of  reasonable  care.  According  to  Judge  Posner,  this  “formula
translates  into  economic  terms  the  conventional  legal  test  for
negligence.  Unreasonable  conduct  is  merely  the  failure  to  take
in  avoiding
precautions  that  would  generate  greater  beneﬁts
accidents  than  the  precautions  would  cost.”  McCarty  v.  Pheasant
Run, Inc., 826 F.2d 1554 (7th Cir. 1987).

The  following  case — also  written  by  Judge  Posner — involves  a
fairly modern application of this formula to a tragic case involving a
train inspector who loses limbs while on the job. Pay close attention
to  how  Judge  Posner  applies  the  Learned  Hand  formula  to  each  of
the  plaintiff’s  three  allegations  of  negligence  against  the  defendant
railroad.

DAVIS V. CONSOLIDATED RAIL CORP.
788 F.2d 1260 (7th Cir. 1986)

      , J.

This  is  a  personal  injury  suit  under  the  diversity  jurisdiction;  the
substantive  issues  are  governed  by  the  tort  law  of  Illinois.  The  suit
arises  from  an  accident  that  occurred  in  1983.  The  plaintiff,  Davis,
was 33 years old at the time, an experienced railroad worker who for
the past six years had been employed as an inspector of cars by the
Trailer  Train  Company,  a  lessor  of  piggyback  cars  to  railroads.  He
made  the  inspections  in  railroad  yards,  among  them  Conrail’s
marshaling yard in East St. Louis. On the day of the accident, Davis,
driving an unmarked van that was the same color as the Conrail vans
used  in  the  yard  but  that  lacked  the  identifying  “C”  painted  on  each
Conrail van, arrived at the yard and saw a train coming in from east to
west. He noticed that several of the cars in the train were Trailer Train
cars  that  he  was  required  to  inspect.  The  train  halted,  and  was
decoupled  near  the  front;  the  locomotive,  followed  by  several  cars,
pulled away to the west. The remainder of the train was stretched out
for three-quarters of a mile to the east; and because it lay on a curved
section  of  the  track,  its  rear  end  was  not  visible  from  the  point  of
decoupling. An employee of Conrail named Lundy saw Davis sitting in
his van, didn’t know who he was, thought it was queer he was there,
but did nothing.

Shortly  afterward  Davis  began  to  conduct  the  inspections.  This
required him to crawl underneath the cars to look for cracks. One of
the cars was the third from the end (that is, from the point where the
train had been decoupled). Unbeknownst to Davis, a locomotive had
just coupled with the other (eastern) end of the train. It had a crew of
four.  Two  were  in  the  cab  of  the  locomotive.  The  other  two,  one  of
whom  was  designated  as  the  rear  brakeman,  were  somewhere
alongside the train; the record does not show just where, but neither
was at the western end of the train, where Davis was. The crew was
ordered  to  move  the  train  several  car  lengths  to  the  east  because  it
was  blocking  a  switch.  The  crew  made  the  movement,  but  without
blowing the train’s horn or ringing its bell. The only warning Davis had
of  the  impending  movement  was  the  sudden  rush  of  air  as  the  air
brakes were activated. He tried to scramble to safety before the train
started up but his legs were caught beneath the wheels of the car as
he  crawled  out  from  under  it.  One  leg  was  severed  just  below  the
knee; most of the foot on the other leg was also sliced off. The train
had  not  been  “blue  flagged.”  It  is  law  (49  C.F.R.  §  218)  as  well  as
custom in the railroad industry that whenever work is being done on a
train a blue metal flag be placed at either end to warn employees not
to  move  the  train.  Though  well  aware  of  the  custom,  Davis  had
neither  blue  flagged  the  train  before  crawling  under  it  nor  asked  an
employee of Conrail to blue flag it.

Davis brought this suit against Conrail, charging negligence. A jury
found  for  Davis,  assessed  damages  at  $3  million,  but  found  that
Davis’s  own  negligence  had  been  one-third  responsible  for  the
accident,  and  therefore  awarded  damages  of  $2  million.  Conrail
argues  that  it  was  not  negligent  at  all  (which  if  correct  would  mean
that  Davis  was  entitled  to  zero  damages).  Neither  appellant
challenges the $3 million price tag that the jury put on Davis’s injury,
although  Davis  is  able  to  walk  with  the  aid  of  prosthetic  devices,  to
drive, to work, and in short to lead almost a normal life. Of course, the
loss  of  a  leg  is  a  terrible  disﬁgurement,  especially  for  a  young  man,

and  a  substantial  award  of  damages  would  therefore  be  entirely
justiﬁed  even  without  any  evidence  of  pain  (and  there  was  evidence
of severe though transitory pain) or reduced longevity.

On  the  question  of  Conrail’s  negligence,  Davis  presented  three
theories  to  the  jury.  The  ﬁrst  was  that  Conrail’s  employee  Lundy,
whose auto was equipped with a two-way radio, should have notiﬁed
the  crew  of  the  train  that  an  unknown  person  was  sitting  in  a  van
parked near the tracks. We consider this a rather absurd suggestion.
Lundy had no reason to think that the man in the van would climb out
and crawl under a railroad car. If he had called the crew and told them
there was a man in a van by the tracks, they undoubtedly would have
replied,  so  what?  Maybe,  since  the  van  resembled  the  vans  used  by
Conrail employees, it should have occurred to Lundy that the person
in  the  van  had  business  on  the  tracks.  But  it  is  a  big  jump  from
recognizing  that  possibility  to  thinking  that  the  man  was  in  danger
because  he  might  crawl  under  a  car  without  taking  the  usual
precautions.  And  any  Conrail  employee  would  know  better  than  to
crawl  under  a  car  on  a  live  track  (a  track  that  had  not  been  blue-
flagged).  In  sum,  the  probability  that  Davis  would  crawl  under  a  car
without  ﬁrst  asking  that  it  be  blue  flagged  was  too  low,  as  it
reasonably  appeared  to  Lundy,  to  obligate  Lundy  to  warn  Davis  or
alert the train’s crew.

to  encapsulate

In the famous negligence formula of Judge Learned Hand, which
the  more  conventional  verbal
is
recognized
formulations  of  the  negligence  standard,  a  defendant  is  negligent
only  if  B  <  PL,  meaning,  only  if  the  burden  [B]  of  precautions  is  less
than the magnitude of the loss [L] if an accident that the precautions
would  have  prevented  occurs  discounted
(multiplied)  by  the
probability  of  the  accident  [P].  See  United  States  v.  Carroll  Towing
Co.,  159  F.2d  169,  173  (2d  Cir.  1947).  If  P  is  very  low,  elaborate
precautions are unlikely to be required even if L is large, and here the
necessary precautions would have been elaborate.

to

Davis’s  third  theory  is  more  plausible.  He  argues  that  it  was
negligent for the crew to move the train without ﬁrst blowing its horn
(also referred to as the whistle) or ringing its bell. Since no member of
the crew was in a position where he could see the train’s western end,
which was now its rear end, a reasonable jury could ﬁnd that it was
imprudent to move the train without a signal in advance. Although the
crew had no reason to think that Davis was under a car, someone —
whether an employee of Conrail or some other business invitee to the
yard  (such  as  Davis) — might  have  been  standing  in  or  on  a  car  or
between  cars,  for  purposes  of  making  repairs  or  conducting  an

inspection;  and  any  such  person  could  be  severely,  even  fatally,
injured  if  the  train  pulled  away  without  any  warning  or  even  just
moved  a  few  feet.  Regarding  the  application  of  the  Hand  formula  to
such  a  theory  of  negligence,  not  only  was  B  vanishingly  small — for
what  would  it  cost  to  blow  the  train’s  horn? — but  P  was  signiﬁcant,
though  not  large,  once  all  the  possible  accidents  that  blowing  the
horn  would  have  averted  are  added  together.  For  in  determining  the
beneﬁts  of  a  precaution — and  PL,  the  expected  accident  costs  that
the  precaution  would  avert,  is  a  measure  of  the  beneﬁts  of  the
precaution — the  trier  of  fact  must  consider  not  only  the  expected
cost of this accident but also the expected cost of any other, similar
accidents  that  the  precaution  would  have  prevented.  Blowing  the
horn would have saved not only an inspector who had crawled under
the  car  (low  P),  but  also  an  inspector  leaning  on  a  car,  a  railroad
employee doing repairs on the top of a car, a brakeman straddling two
cars, and anyone else who might have business in or on (as well as
under) a car. The train was three-quarters of a mile long. It was not so
unlikely that somewhere in that stretch a person was in a position of
potential  peril  to  excuse  the  crew  from  taking  the  inexpensive
precaution  of  blowing  the  train’s  horn.  Or  so  at  least  the  jury  could
conclude without taking leave of its senses.

Against this conclusion Conrail and Trailer Train hurl a number of
arguments.  One  is  that  precautions  would  not  have  been  effective;
Davis  himself  testiﬁed  that  he  would  not  have  heard  the  train’s  bell.
But  we  do  not  consider  this  so  damaging  a  concession  as  the
defendants  do.  Davis  would  not  have  heard  the  bell,  no,  but  it  does
not  mean  that  he  would  not  have  heard  the  horn.  The  horn  is
deafening,  and  Conrail’s  assertion  (for  which  no  evidence  was
offered) that the horn would have been inaudible at three-quarters of
a mile is as implausible as it is unsubstantiated.

A better point is that there is so much trafﬁc in a marshaling yard
that  sounding  the  horn  every  time  a  train  is  moved  would  cause  a
cacophony that would deprive the horn of its efﬁcacy as a warning. If

horns were blowing all the time, Davis would not know, when the horn
sounded,  whether  it  was  the  horn  for  this  train  or  some  other  train.
Either  he  would  ignore  it  or  he  would  be  spending  all  his  time
scrambling  out  from  under  and  then  back  under  the  cars  he  was
inspecting. The problem with this argument is that Conrail put in no
evidence on how busy the marshaling yard was either at the time of
the accident or at any other time. We know it is a large (four square
miles)  and  busy  yard,  but  we  do  not  know  how  frequently  trains  are
actually  moved  in  a  large  and  busy  yard.  Every  15  minutes?  Every
hour? Conrail could easily have put in evidence on this point, but did
not. Moreover, Davis is not contending that due care requires that the
horn  be  blown  before  every  move.  Maybe  this  move  was  special,
because of the length of the train in combination with the curvature
of the track and the fact that all of the crew members were at or near
the  front  of  the  train.  Even  if  the  yard  is  very  busy,  if  the  horn  were
sounded  only  in  the  unusual  case  where  there  was  more  than
average  danger  from  a  sudden  movement  the  danger  of  cacophony
would be diminished.

The defendants’ strongest argument is that Conrail had no duty to
warn  persons  who  might  be  in  or  on  or  under  the  train — given  the
blue  flag  rule.  There  is  in  general  no  duty  to  anticipate  and  take
precautions  against  the  negligence  of  another  person.  Such  a
requirement would tend to induce potential injurers to take excessive
safety  precautions  relative  to  those  taken  by  potential  victims;  the
cost  of  safety  would  rise.  Thus,  “if  the  motorist  on  the  through
highway  had  to  travel  at  such  a  speed  that  he  could  stop  his  car  in
time  to  avoid  collisions  with  vehicles  which  ignore  stop  signs  on
intersecting  roads,  the  purpose  of  having  a  through  highway  in  the
ﬁrst  place  would  be  entirely  thwarted.”  Hession  v.  Liberty  Asphalt
Products, Inc.,  235  N.E.2d  17,  22  (1968).  The  defendants  argue  that
the  rule  regarding  blue  flagging  excuses  the  crew  from  any  duty  of
care  to  persons  who  might  be  injured  by  a  sudden  starting  of  the
train,  because  all  such  persons  can  protect  themselves  by  blue

flagging and are careless if they fail to do so. There is some evidence,
however,  that  the  rule  was  honored  in  the  breach.  Davis  inspected
cars at the yard three or four times a week, never posted or requested
the  posting  of  a  blue  flag,  and  was  seen  by  many  employees  of
Conrail without remonstrance from them.

Of  course,  there  was  much  evidence  that  Davis  was  negligent  in
failing to blue flag the train (or request that it be blue flagged) before
crawling under it. When he saw the western end of the train pull away
he assumed the train would stay put. Yet as an experienced railroad
worker  he  knew  perfectly  well  that  the  train  could  be  pulled  from
either end, and since he couldn’t see the other end from where he was
working, he was taking a grave risk that a locomotive would hook on
to  that  end  and  pull  the  train  east,  crushing  him  beneath  it.  He  may
well have been more negligent than the railroad. But we do not think
the jury was irrational to ﬁnd that the railroad was negligent as well.
[T]his was a matter for the jury to consider; a rational jury could have
concluded that the horn would have warned him.

Moreover, we were careful to qualify our statement of the rule that
a  potential  injurer  is  entitled  to  assume  that  potential  victims  will
exercise due care, by saying that this was true “in general.” A certain
amount of negligence is unavoidable, because the standard of care is
set  with  reference  to  the  average  person  and  some  people  have
below-average  ability  to  take  care  and  so  can’t  comply  with  the
standard,  and  because  in  any  event  efforts  at  being  careful  produce
only  a  probability,  not  a  certainty,  of  avoiding  careless  conduct
through  momentary  inattention.  Potential  injurers  may  therefore  be
required  to  take  some  care  for  the  protection  of  the  negligent,
especially  when  the  probability  of  negligence  is  high  or  the  costs  of
care  very  low.  You  cannot  close  your  eyes  while  driving  through  an
intersection,  merely  because  you  have  a  green  light.  If,  as  the  jury
could  have  found,  Conrail  could  have  avoided  this  accident  by  the
essentially costless step of blowing the train’s horn, it may have been

duty-bound to do so even if only a careless person would have been
endangered by a sudden movement of the train.

Although the evidence of the defendants’ negligence is thin . . . we

can ﬁnd no reversible error.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Learned Hand Formula.  The formula applied in the above case
by  Judge  Posner,  famous  himself  as  a  pioneer  in  the  scholarship
regarding  “law  and  economics,”  was  fashioned  originally  by  Judge
Learned  Hand,  a  famous  Second  Circuit  federal  appellate  judge.
Judge  Hand  was  once  nicknamed  the  “Tenth  man  on  the  Supreme
Court”  and  had  great  influence  in  the  development  of  the  common
law. What does the Learned Hand formula suggest about the concern
the reasonable person has for the welfare of others, that such person
would  be  willing  to  incur  a  cost  for  the  beneﬁt  of  others?  Does  this
reflect how our society actually functions or is it aspirational?

Judge B. Learned Hand

2. Analytically  but  Not  Operationally  Signiﬁcant.   Judge  Posner,  in
his  prior  opinion  in  McCarty  mentioned  earlier  acknowledged  some
practical limitations on the Learned Hand formula:

Ordinarily,  and  here,  the  parties  do  not  give  the
jury  the
information  required  to  quantify  the  variables  that  the  Hand
Formula picks out as relevant. That is why the formula has greater
analytic  than  operational  signiﬁcance.  Conceptual  as  well  as
practical difﬁculties in monetizing personal injuries may continue
to  frustrate  efforts  to  measure  expected  accident  costs  with  the
precision  that  is  possible,  in  principle  at  least,  in  measuring  the
other side of the equation — the cost or burden of precaution. For
many  years  to  come  juries  may  be  forced  to  make  rough
judgments of reasonableness, intuiting rather than measuring the
factors  in  the  Hand  Formula;  and  so  long  as  their  judgment  is
reasonable,  the  trial  judge  has  no  right  to  set  it  aside,  let  alone
substitute his own judgment.

Id.  Despite  some  operational  limitations,  in  what  ways  might  the
formula be useful analytically? First, when an appellate court (or trial
judge)  is  reviewing  a  jury’s  decision  on  the  issue  of  breach,  this
formula  permits  an  enlightened  review  of  the  evidence  to  see  if  the
decision appears to have a rational basis in the facts. Further, when a
trial  judge  is  listening  to  objections  as  to  the  relevancy  of  proposed
evidence offered at trial, this formula permits analysis as to whether
the evidence tends to make a material fact true or not. In other words,
as to the issue of breach of duty, any evidence offered must relate to
either the Burden, Probability of an accident, or the size of the Loss, in
order  to  be  admitted.  It  also  makes  sense  for  lawyers  to  at  least
allude to these factors in making closing arguments before a jury on
the issue of breach. On the other hand, the court does not instruct the
jury  on  this  algebraic  equation  and  the  verdict  form  is  not  a  math
quiz.

3.  Law  and  Economics.   While  the  Learned  Hand  formula  has
proven to have enduring value, and doubtlessly reﬁnes the analysis of
breach of duty in a negligence case, it nevertheless has to be “taken
with  a  grain  of  salt.”  This  is  true  primarily  because  a  mathematical
formula  cannot  capture  all  of  a  society’s  contemporary  values
effectively.  For  example,  under  the  Learned  Hand  formula,  which
circumstance  would  call  for  heightened  care?  Scenario  A,  where  a
homeless  man’s  life  might  be  put  in  jeopardy  by  the  defendant’s
conduct?  Or  Scenario  B,  where  a  wealthy  corporate  executive’s  life
would  be  placed  in  jeopardy?  A  purely  cold-blooded  mathematical
calculation  would  suggest  that  Scenario  B  requires  greater  care,  as
the injury to a high-income earner would yield greater damages than
the  injury  to  a  homeless  person.  A  lawyer  trying  to  advance  such  a
comparative  argument  to  a  jury  would  be  a  lawyer  with  an  unhappy
client. Despite such real-world limits, the ﬁeld of inquiry plowed by the
discipline of law and economics is rich. A good example of the debate
over the utility of law and economics can be found in Christine Jolls,
Cass  Sunstein  &  Richard  Thaler, A  Behavioral Approach to Law  and
Economics, 50 Stanford L. Rev. 1471 (1998).

“Economics is the painful
elaboration of the obvious.”

4.  Burden/Utility.   The  left
the  Learned  Hand
side  of
formula  asks,  with  respect  to
the  plaintiff’s  theory  of  how  a
reasonable  person  would  have
acted,  what  the  costs  of  this
alternative conduct would have
entailed.  The  other  side  of  the  same  coin  might  involve  placing  a
value to the defendant on the defendant’s actual chosen activity. The
Restatement  frames  this  other  perspective  in  terms  of  the  utility  of
the defendant’s conduct:

Anonymous

Where an act is one which a reasonable man would recognize as
involving  a  risk  of  harm  to  another,  the  risk  is  unreasonable  and

the act is negligent if the risk is of such magnitude as to outweigh
what  the  law  regards  as  the  utility  of  the  act  or  of  the  particular
manner in which it is done.

Restatement (Second) of Torts §291. (1965)

5.  Anticipating  Others’  Negligence.   The  court  in  the  foregoing
opinion  acknowledges  a  general  truth  that  one  should  not  have  to
anticipate  the  negligence  of  others  but  notes  that  there  are
exceptions to this. Later (in Chapter 8 Damages) we will encounter a
debate  about  whether  a  motorist/victim  should  have  to  wear  a  seat
belt, anticipating the possible negligence of other motorists causing a
collision.  In  that  section,  we  will  encounter  a  trend  by  courts  to
recognize a possible defense by tortfeasors on the highway when the
victim’s  injuries  were  worsened  by  their  decision  to  forgo  wearing  a
seatbelt.  Though  also  acknowledging  this  generalization  that  one
should  not  have  to  normally  anticipate  others’  negligence,  courts
there have begun to also recognize that motor vehicle accidents are
“omnipresent.”  Law  v.  Superior  Court,  755  P.2d  1135,  1141  (Ariz.
1988).

6.  Problem.   We  have  just  ﬁnished  looking  at  what  “reasonable
care is under the circumstances” in the context of such variables as
sudden  emergencies  and  highly  dangerous  activities.  Now  armed
with the Learned Hand formula, go back and practice articulating how
you might quantify the logic behind those two doctrines algebraically.

B. Negligence Per Se — Violation of Statutes

Sometimes  the  challenged  conduct  of  the  actor  in  question  may
appear  to  violate  a  statute,  government  regulation,  or  municipal
ordinance.  This  may  strike  the  claimant’s  counsel  as  a  wonderful
observation. But what role, if any, should this circumstance play in the
analysis  of  whether  the  defendant  breached  a  legal  duty  of  care?  Is

this  circumstance  even  relevant  to  determining  breach?  And,  if
relevant,  how  much  weight  should  be  attached  to  the  fact  that  the
challenged conduct was prohibited by an act of either the legislative
or  executive  branches  of  government?  Martin  v.  Herzog  is  a  classic
case involving an actor whose challenged conduct violated a statute.
The trial court was apparently confused as to the signiﬁcance of this
circumstance,  as  you  will  see  from  the  vague  jury  instructions,
thereby  requiring  Judge  Cardozo  to  clarify  and  apply  the  doctrine  of
Negligence Per Se. Pay special attention to the prerequisites for this
doctrine and its impact on the issue of demonstrating breach of duty.

1. Origins and Rationale

MARTIN v. HERZOG
126 N.E. 814 (N.Y. 1920)

       , J.

The  action  is  one  to  recover  damages  for  injuries  resulting  in

death.

Plaintiff  and  her  husband,  while  driving  toward  Tarrytown  in  a
buggy on the night of August 21, 1915, were struck by the defendant’s
automobile coming in the opposite direction. They were thrown to the
ground,  and  the  man  was  killed.  At  the  point  of  the  collision  the
highway  makes  a  curve.  The  car  was  rounding  the  curve  when
suddenly  it  came  upon  the  buggy,  emerging,  the  defendant  tells  us,
from  the  gloom.  Negligence  is  charged  against  the  defendant,  the
driver of the car, in that he did not keep to the right of the center of the
highway (Highway Law, sec. 286, subd. 3; sec. 332; Consol. Laws, ch.
25).  Negligence  is  charged  against  the  plaintiff’s  intestate,  the  driver
of  the  wagon,  in  that  he  was  traveling  without  lights  (Highway Law,
sec. 329a, as amended by L. 1915, ch. 367). There is no evidence that

the  defendant  was  moving  at  an  excessive  speed.  There  is  none  of
any  defect  in  the  equipment  of  his  car.  The  beam  of  light  from  his
lamps pointed to the right as the wheels of his car turned along the
curve  toward  the  left;  and  looking  in  the  direction  of  the  plaintiff’s
approach,  he  was  peering  into  the  shadow.  The  case  against  him
must stand, therefore, if at all, upon the divergence of his course from
the  center  of  the  highway.  The  jury  found  him  delinquent  and  his
victim blameless. The Appellate Division reversed, and ordered a new
trial.

We  agree  with  the  Appellate  Division  that  the  charge  to  the  jury
was  erroneous  and  misleading.  The  case  was  tried  on  the
assumption  that  the  hour  had  arrived  when  lights  were  due.  It  was
argued on the same assumption in this court. In such circumstances,
it  is  not  important  whether  the  hour  might  have  been  made  a
question  for  the  jury  (Todd  v.  Nelson,  109  N.Y.  316,  325).  A
controversy put out of the case by the parties is not to be put into it
by us. We say this by way of preface to our review of the contested
rulings.  In  the  body  of  the  charge  the  trial  judge  said  that  the  jury
could  consider  the  absence  of  light  “in  determining  whether  the
plaintiff’s  intestate  was  guilty  of  contributory  negligence  in  failing  to
have a light upon the buggy as provided by law. I do not mean to say
that the absence of light necessarily makes him negligent, but it is a
fact for your consideration.” The defendant requested a ruling that the
absence of a light on the plaintiff’s vehicle was “prima facie evidence
of  contributory  negligence.”  This  request  was  refused,  and  the  jury
were again instructed that they might consider the absence of lights
as  some  evidence  of  negligence,  but  that  it  was  not  conclusive
evidence. The plaintiff then requested a charge that “the fact that the
plaintiff’s  intestate  was  driving  without  a  light  is  not  negligence  in
itself,” and to this the court acceded. The defendant saved his rights
by appropriate exceptions.

We think the unexcused omission of the statutory signals is more
than some evidence of negligence. It is negligence in itself. Lights are

intended  for  the  guidance  and  protection  of  other  travelers  on  the
highway  (Highway  Law,  sec.  329a).  By  the  very  terms  of  the
hypothesis, to omit, willfully or heedlessly, the safeguards prescribed
by  law  for  the  beneﬁt  of  another  that  he  may  be  preserved  in  life  or
limb, is to fall short of the standard of diligence to which those who
live in organized society are under a duty to conform. That, we think,
is now the established rule in this state. Whether the omission of an
absolute  duty,  not  willfully  or  heedlessly,  but  through  unavoidable
accident,  is  also  to  be  characterized  as  negligence,  is  a  question  of
nomenclature into which we need not enter, for it does not touch the
case  before  us.  There  may  be  times,  when  if  jural  niceties  are  to  be
preserved,  the  two  wrongs,  negligence  and  breach  of  statutory  duty,
must  be  kept  distinct  in  speech  and  thought.  In  the  conditions  here
present they come together and coalesce. A rule less rigid has been
applied  where  the  one  who  complains  of  the  omission  is  not  a
member of the class for whose protection the safeguard is designed.
Courts  have  been  reluctant  to  hold  that  the  police  regulations  of
boards  and  councils  and  other  subordinate  ofﬁcials  create  rights  of
action  beyond  the  speciﬁc  penalties  imposed.  This  has  led  them  to
say that the violation of a statute is negligence, and the violation of a
like ordinance is only evidence of negligence. An ordinance, however,
like  a  statute,  is  a  law  within  its  sphere  of  operation,  and  so  the
distinction  has  not  escaped  criticism.  Whether  it  has  become  too
deeply  rooted  to  be  abandoned,  even  if  it  be  thought  illogical,  is  a
question  not  now  before  us.  What  concerns  us  at  this  time  is  that
even in the ordinance cases, the omission of a safeguard prescribed
by statute is put upon a different plane, and is held not merely some
evidence  of  negligence,  but  negligence  in  itself.  In  the  case  at  hand,
we  have  an  instance  of  the  admitted  violation  of  a  statute  intended
for the protection of travelers on the highway, of whom the defendant
at the time was one. Yet the jurors were instructed in effect that they
were at liberty in their discretion to treat the omission of lights either
as innocent or as culpable. They were allowed to “consider the default

as  lightly  or  gravely”  as  they  would  (Thomas,  J.,  in  the  court  below).
They might as well have been told that they could use a like discretion
in  holding  a  master  at  fault  for  the  omission  of  a  safety  appliance
prescribed  by  positive  law  for  the  protection  of  a  workman.  Jurors
have no dispensing power by which they may relax the duty that one
traveler on the highway owes under the statute to another. It is error
to tell them that they have. The omission of these lights was a wrong,
and being wholly unexcused was also a negligent wrong. No license
should  have  been  conceded  to  the  triers  of  the  facts  to  ﬁnd  it
anything else.

We  must  be  on  our  guard,  however,  against  confusing  the
question  of  negligence  with  that  of  the  causal  connection  between
the negligence and the injury. A defendant who travels without lights
is not to pay damages for his fault unless the absence of lights is the
cause  of  the  disaster.  A  plaintiff  who  travels  without  them  is  not  to
forfeit the right to damages unless the absence of lights is at least a
contributing cause of the disaster. To say that conduct is negligence
is  not  to  say  that  it  is  always  contributory  negligence.  “Proof  of
negligence in the air, so to speak, will not do” (Pollock Torts [10th ed.],
p. 472). We think, however, that evidence of a collision occurring more
than  an  hour  after  sundown  between  a  car  and  an  unseen  buggy,
proceeding  without
is  evidence  from  which  a  causal
connection  may  be  inferred  between  the  collision  and  the  lack  of
signals. If nothing else is shown to break the connection, we have a
case, prima facie sufﬁcient, of negligence contributing to the result.

lights,

We  are  persuaded  that  the  tendency  of  the  charge  and  of  all  the
rulings following it, was to minimize unduly, in the minds of the triers
of  the  facts,  the  gravity  of  the  decedent’s  fault.  Errors  may  not  be
ignored  as  unsubstantial  when  they  tend  to  such  an  outcome.  A
statute designed for the protection of human life is not to be brushed
aside  as  a  form  of  words,  its  commands  reduced  to  the  level  of
cautions, and the duty to obey attenuated into an option to conform.

The order of the Appellate Division should be afﬁrmed.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  The  Reasonable  Person  and  Statutory  Violations.   The  legal
effect  of  a  statutory  violation  in  a  negligence  case,  which  Judge
Cardozo  described  as  “negligence  in  itself,”  is  now  referred  to  by
courts by the name Negligence Per Se. It is so well established now
that  one  might  assume  it  was  natural  law.  But  why  should  the  fact
that the challenged conduct violated a statute necessarily lead to the
inevitable  conclusion  that  the  defendant  was  negligent?  What  does
this  say  about  the  attitude  of  the  reasonable  person  with  respect  to
compliance  with  mandatory  obligations  created  by  legislative  or
regulatory  enactment?  Also,  consider  whether  this  doctrine
is
necessitated  by  the  separation  of  powers  concept  forming  the
foundation for our American system of government. If the trial court’s
charge  to  the  jury  in  Martin  had  been  considered  appropriate,  what
would  the  judicial  branch  be  saying  about  its  power  to  disregard
decisions by the legislative branch?

2. Speciﬁcity.   In  Martin,  there  was  no  doubt  about  the  fact  that
the plaintiff had violated a statute requiring speciﬁc conduct — lights
on  buggies  being  driven  at  night.  Not  all  statutes  are  so  speciﬁc.
Sometimes  a  statute,  such  as  a  trafﬁc  code,  might  demand  that  a
driver “exercise care to yield the right of way to oncoming trafﬁc.” To
the  extent  that  a  statutory  obligation  merely  adopts  the  reasonable
person  standard,  it  adds  nothing  to  the  breach  analysis  and  the
doctrine of negligence per se is inapplicable.

3. Effect  of  Negligence  Per  Se.   Which  element  of  the  negligence
cause of action does negligence per se help to prove? Judge Cardozo
clariﬁed  that  the  “unexcused  violation”  of  the  statute  constituted
proof  of  negligence — breach  of  duty.  Yet  for  negligence  to  be
something other than “negligence in the air,” it must be proven to be a
legal  cause  of  the  harm  as  well.  Negligence  per  se  clariﬁes  the  duty
analysis by giving a very deﬁnite expectation for the conduct required,
and  the  statute’s  violation  then  establishes  the  breach  element.  But

negligence per se does not establish causation. This is why, near the
end of his opinion, Cardozo cautioned that the jury would still need to
determine  causation  upon  remand.  Legal  causation  is  taken  up  in
Chapter 5 of this book.

4.  Differing  Roles  of  Law  and  Fact.   Negligence  per  se  requires
proof  of  a  statutory  violation.  If  the  alleged  violation  is  disputed  the
jury  might  be  called  upon  to  resolve  that  factual  dispute  by
determining  whether  the  actor  did,  in  fact,  violate  the  statute.  Once
the  statutory  violation  is  proven,  however,  there  is  no  more  work  for
the  jury  to  perform  in  ﬁnding  that  a  breach  of  duty  has  occurred,
unless  the  defendant  claims  that  the  violation  was  excused.  Often
courts  will  instruct  the  jury  along  the  lines,  “if  you  ﬁnd  that
defendant’s conduct was a violation of [the Code], you are instructed
that  the  defendant  was  negligent  as  a  matter  of  law.”  The  jury  may
still have to resolve fact disputes concerning the other elements (i.e.,
causation  and  damages)  but  the  doctrine  of  negligence  per  se
focuses the jury’s attention, and traditionally does not permit the jury
to  disregard  the  legislature’s  decision  with  respect  to  what  the
legislature  deems  to  be  reasonable  care  under  the  circumstances
present in the statutory violation.

5.  Statutes,  Ordinances,  Regulations,  and  Codes.   Judge  Cardozo
indicated  that  there  had  been,  at  one  time,  doubts  about  whether  a
party’s  violation  of  a  municipal  ordinance  should  be  afforded  the
same effect as a statutory violation. Courts now routinely and equally
(though  not  universally)  apply  negligence  per  se  to  violations  of
statutes, ordinances, codes, and administrative regulations.

2. Type of Harm and Membership in Protected Class

In  Martin,  Judge  Cardozo  noted  that  the  statutory  requirement  for  a
light on a buggy at night was “intended for the protection of travelers
on  the  highway.  .  .  .”  Cardozo  recognized  that  if  the  purpose  of  the

statute was unrelated to the harm suffered by the plaintiff, there was
no  rational  reason  to  defer  to  the  legislature’s  decision  as  to  the
prescribed  course  of  conduct.  It  is  only  when  the  legislature  is
seeking to prevent the type of harm suffered in the tort case that we
can  trust  its  assessment  as  to  reasonable  care.  Consider  the
following  case,  where  the  admitted  violation  of  a  statute  was  found
not  to  trigger  negligence  per  se  because  the  harm  sought  to  be
prevented was unrelated to the harm at issue.

WAWANESA MUTUAL INS. v. MATLOCK
60 Cal. App. 4th 583 (1997)

     , J.

Timothy  Matlock,  age  seventeen,  bought  two  packs  of  cigarettes
from a gas station one day in April 1993. Tim gave one of the packs
to his friend, Eric Erdley, age ﬁfteen. Smoking as they walked, the two
trespassed onto a private storage facility in Huntington Beach, where
a couple of hundred telephone poles were stacked up high upon the
ground, held in place by two vertical poles sticking out of the ground.
The two had climbed on the logs many times before.

Timothy  and  Eric  were  joined  by  2  younger  boys,  about  10  or  11
years  old,  who  walked  with  them  on  the  logs.  Eric  was  smoking  a
cigarette  held  in  his  left  hand.  Timothy  began  to  tease  the  younger
boys, telling them the logs were going to fall. The boys started to run,
though perhaps more out of laughter than of fear. One of the younger
boys  ran  right  into  Eric’s  left  arm.  Eric  dropped  his  cigarette  down
between  the  logs,  where  it  landed  on  a  bed  of  sand.  For  about  20
seconds Eric tried to retrieve the cigarette, but he couldn’t reach it. He
stood  up  and  tried  to  extinguish  it  by  spitting  on  it,  and  again  was
unsuccessful.

Then Eric caught up with Timothy, who was about 10 feet ahead.
They  went  into  some  bunkers  about  50  feet  away;  when  they  came

out again after about 20 minutes, they saw flames at the base of the
logs. They were seen running from the location.

The  Woodman  Pole  Company  suffered  considerable  property
damage  because  of  the  ﬁre.  [Eric’s  insurance  company,  Wawanesa,
paid $100,000 to settle the tort claims on behalf of Eric. It then ﬁled
this  lawsuit  against  Timothy  seeking  partial  reimbursement,  or
contribution,  based  upon  Timothy’s  tortious  misconduct  being  an
additional cause of the ﬁre and the property damage. For purposes of
this lawsuit, Wawanesa is subrogated to the rights of Eric in seeking
contribution against a fellow tortfeasor.]

liable,

After a bench trial, the court [found in favor of Wawanesa holding
that  Timothy  was
in  part,  based  upon  the  doctrine  of
negligence  per  se].  The  judge  stated  that  the  statute  that  makes  it
unlawful to give cigarettes to minors, Penal Code section 308, had to
have been enacted in 1891 with “more than health concerns” in mind,
“since the health issues on tobacco are of considerably more recent
concern.”

Timothy and his father Paul now appeal, arguing that there is no
basis  on  which  to  hold  Timothy  liable  for  the  damage  caused  when
Eric dropped the cigarette.

We agree. There is no valid basis on which to hold Timothy liable.
Just because a statute has been violated does not mean that the
violator is necessarily liable for any damage that might be ultimately
traced  back  to  the  violation.  As  the  court  stated  in  Olsen  v.
McGillicuddy  (1971)  15  Cal.  App.  3d  897,  902-903  “The  doctrine  of
negligence  per  se  does  not  apply  even  though  a  statute  has  been
violated if the plaintiff was not in the class of persons designed to be
protected or the type of harm which occurred was not one which the
statute  was  designed  to  prevent.”  Mere  “but-for”  causation,  as  is
urged in Wawanesa’s brief, is simply not enough. The statute must be
designed to protect against the kind of harm which occurred.

The  statute  that  makes  it  illegal  to  furnish  tobacco  to  minors,
Penal Code section 308, has nothing to do with ﬁre suppression. As it
now  stands,  it  is  intended  to  prevent  early  addiction  to  tobacco.  It
may  be  true,  as  the  trial  court  opined,  that  when  the  ﬁrst  version  of
the  statute  was  enacted  in  1891  it  was  not  directed  primarily  at
protecting minors’ health.1 But it is most certainly a health statute as
it  exists  today.  As  our  Supreme  Court  recently  noted  in  Mangini  v.
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. (1994) 7 Cal. 4th 1057, 1060, section 308
“‘reflects  a  statutory  policy  of  protecting  minors  from  addiction  to
cigarettes.’” The connection of section 308 with health is emphasized
by  the  court’s  speciﬁcally  analogizing  section  308  to  former  Health
and Safety Code section 25967, which states that preventing children
from  “‘beginning  to  use  tobacco  products’”  “is”  “‘among  the  highest
priorities in disease  prevention  for  the  State  of  California.’”  (Mangini,
supra,  7  Cal.  4th  at  pp.  1061-1062,  italics  added  [quoting  from
appellate opinion quoting statute].)

Nothing  suggests  that  section  308  is  part  of  any  scheme  to
prevent ﬁres. Its placement in the general morals section of the Penal
Code belies such an intent.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Negligence  Per  Se  Elements.   To  apply  the  doctrine  of
negligence  per  se,  the  plaintiff  has  the  burden  of  proving  that  (1)
defendant  violated  a  statute  that  prohibited  certain  particular
conduct,  (2)  that  the  statute  was  intended  to  protect  against  the
harm for which recovery is sought, and (3) that the victim harmed by
the  violation  was  part  of  the  class  of  persons  for  whom  the  statute
was intended to provide protection. In Wawanesa, remembering that
the  basis  for  the  relief  sought  was  the  ﬁre  damage  incurred  by  the
Woodman  Pole  Company,  which  of  these  required  prerequisites  for
application of the doctrine were unsatisﬁed?

2.  Negligence  Per  Se  Is  Not  the  Exclusive  Way  to  Prove  Breach.
Most  claims  of  negligence  are  proven  by  persuading  the  jury  simply
that  the  reasonable  person  under  the  circumstances  would  have
acted  differently  and  that  this  would  have  prevented  the  harm — in
other  words,  by  resorting  to  the  Learned  Hand  methodology  of
analysis.  Even  if  negligence  per  se  is  unavailable,  lawyers  must
remember  that  proving  ordinary  negligence  through  the  Learned
Hand  formula  is  always  available.  In  fact,  in  Wawanesa,  the  plaintiff
also argued that the circumstances present, apart from the statutory
violation, also demonstrated a lack of due care by Timothy. In another
portion  of  the  opinion,  the  appellate  court  acknowledged  such  a
pathway  was  available  to  proving  breach.  Nevertheless,  it  held  that
legal  causation  (a  topic  we  take  up  in  the  next  chapter)  was  lacking
because the ﬁre was too unforeseeable a consequence of Timothy’s
lack of care:

In  the  present  case,  the  connection  between  Timothy’s  initial  act
of  giving  Eric  the  packet  of  cigarettes  and  the  later  ﬁre  is  simply
too attenuated to show the ﬁre was reasonably within the scope
of the risk created by the initial act.

“But-for” Timothy Matlock’s illegal act of procuring tobacco for
minor  Eric,  and  “but-for”  Timothy’s  participation  as  a  co-
conspirator  in  an  agreement  to  trespass  [and]  to  smoke  these
cigarettes with Eric on Woodman land, and “but-for” Timothy’s act
of causing the younger children to rush off of the wood pile, Eric
would  not  have  been  on  top  of  the  telephone  poles  smoking  a
cigarette at the time that he was bumped by the younger children
and dropped the lit cigarette which started the ﬁre.

The  sentence  contains  no  fewer  than  three  “but-for’s.”  In  the
chain, the cigarette is far less important than the jostling. Yet ﬁres
are  not  within  the  risks  one  foreseeably  incurs  by  teasing
youngsters,  even  youngsters  in  the  general  vicinity  of  someone
smoking a cigarette. 60 Cal. App. 4th at 588-89.

3. Other Tort Theories.  The plaintiff in Wawanesa also tried to hold
Timothy liable for the ﬁre caused by his trespass. The court rejected
this  ﬁnal  theory,  even  though  Timothy  clearly  was  a  trespasser,
because the court reasoned that it was not his trespass that actually
caused the ﬁre, but rather the trespass of Eric. After we cover actual
causation in Chapter 5, you might consider coming back to the facts
of  this  case  and  seeing  if  you  agree  with  the  court’s  conclusion.
Looking even further ahead to Chapter 9 (Apportionment), one might
also  accuse  Timothy  of  being  in  concert  of  action  with  Eric.  That
theory  would  consider  the  conduct  of  either  member  acting  in
concert to be the same as the conduct of the other member.

4.  Rationale  Behind  Prerequisites.   Even

though  Timothy
admittedly violated a statute, the court refused to use that as a basis
for  declaring  him  to  have  breached  his  duty  of  care.  Given  the
rationale  behind  the  doctrine  of  negligence  per  se,  why  is  it  that
courts are not comfortable utilizing the negligence per se “short cut”
to declare breach, when the purpose of the statute (or the victim) is
different than the harm suffered in the case? If you assume that the
legislature  was,  in  effect,  trying  to  do  its  own  math  (utilizing  the
Learned Hand factors) when it crafted the statute, do you understand
why, when the harm suffered is different than the harm the legislature
feared,  there  is  less  reason  to  defer  to  or  trust  the  legislature’s
conclusion on what is “reasonable care under the circumstances”?

5.  Caveat  Regarding  Licensing  Statutes.   A  subtle  but  important
limitation  upon  negligence  per  se’s  application  arises  when  the
defendant  has  engaged  in  a  certain  course  of  conduct  without  a
required license to do so. Driving a car without a license is a common
example.  Does  the  fact  that  the  defendant  has  driven  without  a
license  make  her  negligent  per  se,  even  if  the  manner  of  her  driving
was consistent with exercising reasonable care? Courts generally say
no, even though the purpose of the license may be to ensure that only
qualiﬁed,  trained  citizens  drive.  The  reason  has  more  to  do  with
causation — courts tend to ﬁnd that the violation of the statute is not

what  caused  the  accident.  The  accident  has  to  be  caused  by  the
method of the driving in order to establish a negligence-based liability.
involves  a  “chiropractor”  who  was  practicing
Another  example
without  a  license.  His  methods  allegedly  caused  paralysis  in  the
plaintiff and she sued for negligence. At trial plaintiff attempted to rely
upon  negligence  per  se.  The  appellate  court  rejected  negligence  per
se:

Proper formulation of general standards of preliminary education
and proper examination of the particular applicant should serve to
raise  the  standards  of  skill  and  care  generally  possessed  by
members  of  the  [chiropractic]  profession  in  this  State;  but  the
license  to  practice  medicine  confers  no  additional  skill  upon  the
practitioner; nor does it confer immunity from physical injury upon
a patient if the practitioner fails to exercise care. Here, injury may
have been caused by lack of skill or care; it would not have been
obviated  if  the  defendant  had  possessed  a  license  yet  failed  to
exercise the skill and care required of one practicing medicine.

Brown v. Shyne, 151 N.E. 197 (N.Y. 1926). Rather than attempting to
rely upon the violation of a licensing statute to prove breach through
negligence per se, a lawyer needs to ﬁnd the violation of a statute that
mandates (or proscribes) certain speciﬁc conduct that was the cause
of the plaintiff’s harm.

3. Excuse

In  Martin,  Judge  Cardozo  observed  that  the  case  involved  the
undisputed,  “unexcused”  violation  of  the  underlying  statute.  If  the
alleged tortfeasor’s conduct in violating the statute is “excused,” how
does  this  impact  the  application  of  the  negligence  per  se  doctrine?
And  what  exactly  constitutes  excuse?  Does  ignorance  of  the  law
count  as  an  excuse?  Surely  not,  for  all  of  us  have  heard  before

coming  to  law  school  the  maxim  that  “ignorance  of  the  law  is  no
excuse.”  The  following  case  helps  to  answer  these  questions  and
delineate when conduct forbidden by another branch of government
is  excused,  and  thus  the  doctrine  of  negligence  per  se  held
inapplicable.

SIKORA v. WENZEL
727 N.E.2d 1277 (Ohio 2000)

    , J.

[In September 1996, a deck attached to a condominium owned by
Tom Wenzel collapsed during a party held by one of Wenzel’s tenants.
Aaron Sikora, one of the guests at the party, was injured as a result of
the  collapse  and  brought  the  instant  negligence  action.  After  the
incident,  an  engineering  ﬁrm  hired  by  the  city  of  Fairborn  (the  “City”)
concluded
improper
construction and design in violation of the Ohio Basic Building Code
(the “OBBC”).

the  deck’s  collapse

resulted

from

that

A  decade  earlier,  before  the  deck  was  built,  Zink  Road  Manor
Investment  (“Zink”)  owned  and  was  developing  the  property  where
the  condominium  was  located  as  a  series  of  condominiums.  After
Zink submitted plans for the condominiums to the City, Zink decided
to modify the units to include decks. Documents containing the deck
design  were  given  to  the  City  for  review  at  a  meeting  between  the
construction company and the City. The City, however, rejected these
plans  because  they  violated  the  OBBC  and  contained  insufﬁcient
information.  Although  the  City  made  no  further  inspection  of  the
decks during construction nor received from Zink any modiﬁed plans
or other documents sufﬁcient for it to proceed with approval, the City
nevertheless issued Zink a Certiﬁcate of Occupancy.

After  the  City  issued  the  certiﬁcate,  Wenzel  purchased  the
property  at  issue  from  Zink.  It  is  undisputed  that  Wenzel  had  no

knowledge, either actual or constructive, as to any defect in the deck
that  was  attached  to  the  condominium.  The  parties  also  agree  that
Wenzel  was  in  no  way  involved  in  the  discussions  concerning  the
deck between the City, the general contractor, or the subcontractors,
and that he lacked any privity of contract with these entities.

Following the deck’s collapse, Sikora sued Wenzel, the contractor,
and  the  design  company,  alleging  that  each  was  negligent  and
therefore  jointly  and  severally  liable.  Sikora  based  his  claim  against
Wenzel in part upon a violation of R.C. 5321.04(A)(1), which requires
landlords  to  comply  with  all  applicable  provisions  of  the  OBBC.  The
trial court granted summary judgment in Wenzel’s favor on the basis
that he lacked notice of the defect in the deck.]

With this decision we conﬁrm that the doctrine of negligence per
se  countenances  lack  of  notice  of  a  defective  condition  as  a  legal
excuse. We reverse the appellate court’s determination that notice is
irrelevant and strict liability applies, and instead hold that a violation
of R.C. 5321.04(A)(1)  (failing  to  comply  with  the  Ohio  Basic  Building
Code)  constitutes  negligence  per  se,  but  that  such  liability  may  be
excused  by  a  landlord’s  lack  of  actual  or  constructive  notice  of  the
defective condition.

Negligence  per  se  and  strict

liability,  however,  are  not
synonymous.  Courts  view  the  evidentiary  value  of  the  violation  of
statutes  imposed  for  public  safety  in  three  ways:  as  creating  strict
liability,  as  giving  rise  to  negligence  per se,  or  as  simply  evidence  of
negligence. See, generally, Browder, The Taming of a Duty — The Tort
Liability  of  Landlords  (1982),  81  Mich.  L.  Rev.  99.  These  are  three
separate  principles  with  unique  effects  upon  a  plaintiff’s  burden  of
proof and to which the concept of notice may or may not be relevant.
Strict  liability  is  also  termed  “liability  without  fault.”  Black’s  Law
Dictionary  (7  Ed.1999)  926.  Thus,  where  a  statute  is  interpreted  as
imposing strict liability, the defendant will be deemed liable per se —
that  is,  no  defenses  or  excuses,  including  lack  of  notice,  are

applicable.  Areas  where  the  law  typically  imposes  strict  liability
include liability for injuries inflicted from a dangerous instrumentality,
liability  for  violations  of  certain  statutes,  and  liability  for  injuries
caused by a manufacturer, distributor, or vendor of certain products.
Id.

Courts generally agree that violation of a statute will not preclude
defenses and excuses — i.e., strict liability — unless the statute clearly
contemplates  such  a  result.  Notably,  most  courts  refuse  to  impose
strict
liability  for  defective
conditions,  recognizing  the  need  for  some  kind  of  notice  element
prior to the imposition of liability.

in  the  context  of

landlord

liability

More frequently, then, this sort of statutory violation either will be
considered  as  evidence  of  negligence  or  will  support  a  ﬁnding  of
negligence per se. As this court has consistently held, the distinction
between  the  two  depends  upon  the  degree  of  speciﬁcity  with  which
the particular duty is stated in the statute.

Where a statute contains a general, abstract description of a duty,
a  plaintiff  proving  that  a  defendant  violated  the  statute  must
nevertheless  prove  each  of  the  elements  of  negligence  in  order  to
prevail. Thus, proof will be necessary that the defendant failed to act
as  a  reasonably  prudent  person  under  like  circumstances,  to  which
the  defendant’s  lack  of  notice  of  a  defective  condition  may  be  a
relevant consideration.

But where a statute sets forth “a positive and deﬁnite standard of
care  .  .  .  whereby  a  jury  may  determine  whether  there  has  been  a
violation  thereof  by  ﬁnding  a  single  issue  of  fact,”  a  violation  of  that
statute constitutes negligence per se.  In  such  instances,  the  statute
“serves  as  a  legislative  declaration  of  the  standard  of  care  of  a
reasonably prudent person applicable in negligence actions.” Thus the
“reasonable  person  standard  is  supplanted  by  a  standard  of  care
established by the legislature.”

Furthermore,  negligence  per se  and  strict  liability  differ  in  that  a
negligence per se statutory violation may be “excused.” As set forth in
the  Restatement  of  Torts  2d,  supra,  at  37,  Section  288B(1):  “The
unexcused violation of a legislative enactment . . . which is adopted
by the court as deﬁning the standard of conduct of a reasonable man,
is negligence in itself.” (Emphasis added.) But “an excused violation of
a  legislative  enactment  .  .  .  is  not  negligence.”  Restatement  of  Torts
2d, supra, at 32, Section 288A(1).

Lack  of  notice  is  among  the  legal  excuses  recognized  by  other
jurisdictions  and  set  forth  in  the  Restatement  of  Torts  2d.  This
excuse  applies  where  “the  actor  neither  knows  nor  should  know  of
any  occasion  or  necessity  for  action
in  compliance  with  the
legislation  or  regulation.”  Restatement  of  Torts  2d,  supra,  at  35,
Section  288A(2)(b),  Comment  f.  See  also,  Gore  v.  People’s  Savings
Bank, supra (applying this excuse in the context of the violation of a
statutory obligation upon a landlord).

It follows, then, that a determination of liability and the relevance
of notice under a statute imposed for safety depends ﬁrst upon which
of  the  above  categories  the  statute  occupies.  Wenzel  urges  us  to
construe  the  violation  of  R.C. 5321.04(A)(1)  only  as  evidence  of  his
negligence and therefore to consider his lack of notice as crucial to a
determination  of  the  breach  of  his  duty  of  care.  Sikora,  in  contrast,
would  have  us  uphold  the  appellate  court’s  determination  that  strict
liability applies and that Wenzel’s lack of notice is irrelevant.

We  reject  Sikora’s  argument  that  the  statute  imposes  strict
liability. Considering the general reluctance among courts to impose
strict  liability  in  this  context,  the  wording  of  the  statute  fails  to
convince  us  that  the  General  Assembly  intended  to  create  strict
liability  upon  a  violation  of  this  statutory  requirement.  Absent
language  denoting  that  liability  exists  without  possibility  of  excuses,
we  are  unpersuaded  that  the  intent  behind  this  statute  was  to
eliminate excuses and impose strict liability.

Nor do we agree with Wenzel that the language of that statute is
so general or abstract as to constitute merely evidence of negligence.
Rather, we believe the statutory requirement is stated with sufﬁcient
speciﬁcity to impose negligence  per se.  It  is  “ﬁxed  and  absolute,  the
same  under  all  circumstances  and  is  imposed  upon”  all  landlords.
Ornella  v.  Robertson  (1968),  237  N.E.2d  140,  143.  Accordingly,  we
conclude  that  the  statute  requires
landlords  to  conform  to  a
particular  standard  of  care,  the  violation  of  which  constitutes
negligence per se.

Having  determined  that  the  statute’s  violation  constitutes
negligence  per se,  we  turn  now  to  the  question  of  whether  Wenzel’s
lack  of  notice  of  the  defect  in  the  deck  excuses  the  violation.  Both
parties agree that Wenzel neither knew nor had any way of knowing
of  the  defective  condition.  The  City  issued  the  necessary  approval
documents  despite  having  failed  to  reinspect  the  situation.  Because
Wenzel was not involved at that point, however, he had no reason to
question  the  validity  of  the  City’s  certiﬁcation.  Thus,  no  factual
circumstances existed that would have prompted or required Wenzel
to  investigate  the  process  that  occurred  between  the  City  and  the
developer  prior  to  his  involvement.  Given  that  Wenzel  neither  knew
nor should have known of the condition giving rise to the violation of
R.C.  5321.04(A)(1),  his  violation  is  excused  and  he  is  not  liable  to
Sikora for failing to comply with the OBBC.

For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the court of appeals is

reversed.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Strict Liability vs. Negligence Per Se.  The court in Sikora had to
decide  whether  the  building  code,  which  imposes  liability  on  a
landlord  for  code  violations,  imposes  strict  liability.  If  so,  it  is
essentially  a  statutory  cause  of  action  being  pursued  rather  than  a

common law tort claim. In that instance, the statutory claim involves
strict  liability — liability  without  regard  to  any  showing  of  traditional
levels  of  any  fault.  But  the  court  recognizes  that  strict  liability  is  not
presumed  from  statutes.  Because  the  building  code  in  question  did
not  clearly  articulate  a  desire  to  impose  strict  liability,  the  court
interpreted the statute as instead creating a speciﬁc duty to act in a
certain  manner.  The  court  found  the  defendant  in  violation  of  the
statute  but  recognized  that  negligence  per  se  countenances  a
defense of excuse by the defendant.

2.  Ignorance  of  Fact  vs.  Law.   The  defendant  in  Sikora  was
claiming  that  he  had  no  notice  of  any  defect  in  the  deck,  nor  did  he
have  any  reason  to  know  that  the  condition  of  the  deck  was  not  in
compliance  with  the  building  code.  The  defendant  was  not  claiming
ignorance  of  the  building  code,  but  ignorance  of  the  facts  that
revealed a violation of the building code. Plaintiff’s stipulation that the
defendant  neither  knew  nor  had  reason  to  know  of  the  defective
condition enabled the court to rather easily conclude that defendant’s
violation of the statute was excused.

3.  Burden  of  Proof  in  Instances  Where  Violations  Are  Excused.
Because  excuse
is  considered  a  defense,  where  the  plaintiff
otherwise  proves  the  elements  of  negligence  per  se,  the  defendant
must  plead  and  prove  its  excuse.  Ultimately  the  issue  with  excuse
becomes  whether  a  “reasonable  person  under  the  circumstances”
would  have  likewise  been  in  violation  of  the  statute.  Cases  involving
emergencies  or  loss  of  control  of  a  vehicle  are  classic  cases  of
excuse. One good example of the articulation of how excuse interacts
with negligence per se is illustrated by the California Evidence Code,
as follows:

(a) The failure of a person to exercise due care is presumed if
(1)  He  violated  a  statute,  ordinance,  or  regulation  of  a

public entity;

(2)  The  violation  proximately  caused  death  or  injury  to

person or property;

(3) The death or injury resulted from an occurrence of the
nature  which  the  statute,  ordinance,  or  regulation  was
designed to prevent; and

(4) The person suffering the death or injury to his person
or  property  was  one  of  the  class  of  persons  for  whose
protection the statute, ordinance, or regulation was adopted.
(b) This presumption may be rebutted by proof that:

(1)  The  person  violating  the  statute,  ordinance,  or
regulation did what might reasonably be expected of a person
of  ordinary  prudence,  acting  under  similar  circumstances,
who desired to comply with the law.

Cal. Evid. Code §669 (2002). This statement of the law in California is
helpful in demonstrating the prevailing view of the negligence per se
doctrine — that  it  creates  a  presumption  (or  prima  facie  case)  of
negligence  that  is  capable  of  being  overcome  or  rebutted  by  the
defendant’s  proof  that  a  reasonable  person  would  have  acted  the
same  as  the  defendant  under  the  particular  circumstances.  This
highlights the delicate balance of tort law: It defers to the assessment
by  its  sister  branches  of  government  of  preferable  conduct  in  a
general context, while retaining the flexibility to allow a jury to still ﬁnd
the  reasonable  care  standard  met  when  particular  circumstances
demand conduct different from that generally considered careful.

4.  Types  of  Excuses.   Ultimately,  a  violation  of  a  statute  may  be
excused  when  the  reasonable  person  would  have  similarly  been  in
violation  of  the  statute  under  the  circumstances  of  the  case.  There
might  be  many  reasons  why  this  would  be  true.  The  Second
Restatement  offers  the  following  helpful  enumeration  of  recognized
types of excuses:

(1)  An  excused  violation  of  a  legislative  enactment  or  an

administrative regulation is not negligence.

(2)  Unless  such  enactment  or  regulation  is  construed  not  to

permit such excuse, its violation is excused when

(a)  the  violation  is  reasonable  because  of  the  actor’s

incapacity;

(b) he neither knows nor should know of the occasion for

compliance;

(c)  he  is  unable  after  reasonable  diligence  or  care  to

comply;

(d) he is confronted by an emergency not due to his own

misconduct;

(e) compliance would involve a greater risk of harm to the

actor or to others.

Restatement (Second) of Torts §288A. (1965).

5.  Alternative  View  on  Procedural  Effect  of  Negligence  Per  Se.
While  the  typical  procedural  treatment  of  negligence  per  se  is
illustrated  by  the  above  California  evidence  code  provision — where
the violation creates a rebuttable presumption of breach — there are a
minority of courts that treat negligence per se as merely creating an
inference  of  negligence.  In  such  courts,  the  plaintiff’s  proof  of  the
statutory  violation  permits  the  jury  to  ﬁnd  negligence  but  does  not
mandate it, regardless of whether the defendant offers any evidence
of excuse. Such courts disagree with Judge Cardozo’s admonition in
Herzog that this treatment gives the jury too much “dispensing power
by  which  the  jury  may  relax  the  duty”  created  by  the  statute.  The
court  in  Wenzel  outlines  possible  procedural  effects  from  proof  of  a
statutory  violation,  ranging  from  supplying  mere  evidence  of  breach,
to a presumption of breach, and even a type of strict liability where no
excuse is permissible. Another good recent judicial discussion of the
various  procedural  views  of  the  effect  of  a  statutory  violation  is
contained in Zeni v. Anderson, 243 N.W.2d 270 (Mich. 1976) (adopting

the  prevailing  view  that  the  proof  of  a  statutory  violation  creates  a
rebuttable  presumption  that  mandates  a  ﬁnding  of  breach  in  the
absence of proof of excuse).

“LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY . . .”

Texas PJC 5.2 Negligence Per Se — Excuse

The law forbids [driving the wrong way on a street designated
and signposted as one-way]. A failure to comply with this law
is  negligence  in  itself,  unless  excused.  A  failure  to  comply  is
excused  if  [the  driver  was  incapacitated  by  a  heart  attack
immediately before the accident].

C. Custom

Often,  the  challenged  conduct  of  the  defendant  involves  an  area  of
activity  that  others  acting  in  a  certain  industry  may  tacitly  or
expressly  recognize  as  appropriate  or
inappropriate.  When  the
defendant  is  part  of  a  particular  industry,  what  evidentiary  value  is
proof  that  the  defendant  has  failed  to  comply  with  certain  industry
standards  or  practices?  Should  this  be  treated  as  tantamount  to  a
statutory  violation?  Is  it  even  relevant?  Or  what  if  a  defendant’s
conduct  conforms  to  an  industry  standard  or  practice?  Does  this
constitute  a  silver  bullet  defense  to  any  accusations  of  failing  to
observe  ordinary  care?  Other  courts  commonly  cite  the  following
case of The T.J. Hooper for resolution of these issues.

1. Industry Custom

THE T.J. HOOPER
60 F.2d 737 (2d Cir. 1932)

L.     , J.

The  barges  No.  17  and  No.  30,  belonging  to  the  Northern  Barge
Company, had lifted cargoes of coal at Norfolk, Virginia, for New York
in  March,  1928.  They  were  towed  by  two  tugs  of  the  petitioner,  the
“Montrose”  and  the  “Hooper,”  and  were  lost  off  the  Jersey  Coast  on
March tenth, in an easterly gale. [The cargo owners sued the tugboat
owners  for  negligence,  claiming  that  their  failure  to  carry  radio
receivers  by  which  they  could  have  received  timely  warnings  of  the
weather  change  caused  the  property  loss.  The  trial  court  found  in
favor of the plaintiffs and this appeal followed.

Prior to the incident the weather had been fair. The barges got into
serious  trouble  about  70  miles  north  of  Atlantic  City  as  the  wind
turned  into  a  gale,  and  the  barges  eventually  leaked  in  the  choppy
seas and lost their contents as they sank.]

The  [tugs]  would  have  had  the  beneﬁt  of  the  evening  [weather]
report  from  Arlington  had  they  had  proper  receiving  sets.  This
predicted  worse  weather;  it  read:  “Increasing  east  and  southeast
increasing
winds,  becoming  fresh  to  strong,  Friday  night  and
cloudiness  followed  by  rain  Friday.”  The  bare  “increase”  of  the
morning  had  become  “fresh  to  strong.”  To  be  sure  this  scarcely
foretold a gale of from forty to ﬁfty miles for ﬁve hours or more, rising
at  one  time  to  ﬁfty-six;  but  if  the  four  tows  thought  the  ﬁrst  report
enough, the second ought to have laid any doubts. The master of the
“Montrose”  himself,  when  asked  what  he  would  have  done  had  he
received  a  substantially  similar  report,  said  that  he  would  certainly
have  put  in.  The  master  of  the  “Hooper”  was  also  asked  for  his
opinion,  and  said  that  he  would  have  turned  back  also,  but  this
admission is somewhat vitiated by the incorporation in the question
of  the  statement  that  it  was  a  “storm  warning,”  which  the  witness

seized  upon  in  his  answer.  All  this  seems  to  us  to  support  the
conclusion  of  the  judge  that  prudent  masters,  who  had  received  the
second  warning,  would  have  found  the  risk  more  than  the  exigency
warranted; they would have been amply vindicated by what followed.
To  be  sure  the  barges  would,  as  we  have  said,  probably  have
withstood  the  gale,  had  they  been  well  found;  but  a  master  is  not
justiﬁed in putting his tow to every test which she will survive, if she
be  ﬁt.  There  is  a  zone  in  which  proper  caution  will  avoid  putting  her
capacity  to  the  proof;  a  coefﬁcient  of  prudence  that  he  should  not
disregard. Taking the situation as a whole, it seems to us that these
masters  would  have  taken  undue  chances,  had  they  got  the
broadcasts.

They  did  not,  because  their  private  radio  receiving  sets,  which
were  on  board,  were  not  in  working  order.  These  belonged  to  them
personally,  and  were  partly  a  toy,  partly  a  part  of  the  equipment,  but
neither  furnished  by  the  owner,  nor  supervised  by  it.  It  is  not  fair  to
say that there was a general custom among coastwise carriers so as
to  equip  their  tugs.  One  line  alone  did  it;  as  for  the  rest,  they  relied
upon  their  crews,  so  far  as  they  can  be  said  to  have  relied  at  all.  An
adequate receiving set suitable for a coastwise tug can now be got at
small  cost  and  is  reasonably  reliable  if  kept  up;  obviously  it  is  a
source  of  great  protection  to  their  tows.  Twice  every  day  they  can
receive  these  predictions,  based  upon  the  widest  possible
in
formation, available to every vessel within two or three hundred miles
and more. Such a set is the ears of the tug to catch the spoken word,
just  as  the  master’s  binoculars  are  her  eyes  to  see  a  storm  signal
ashore. Whatever may be said as to other vessels, tugs towing heavy
coal  laden  barges,  strung  out  for  half  a  mile,  have  little  power  to
maneuver,  and  do  not,  as  this  case  proves,  expose  themselves  to
weather which would not turn back stauncher craft. They can have at
hand protection against dangers of which they can learn in no other
way.

Is  it  then  a  ﬁnal  answer  that  the  business  had  not  yet  generally
adopted receiving sets? There are yet, no doubt, cases where courts
seem  to  make  the  general  practice  of  the  calling  the  standard  of
proper  diligence;  we  have  indeed  given  some  currency  to  the  notion
ourselves.  Indeed  in  most  cases  reasonable  prudence  is  in  fact
common prudence; but strictly it is never its measure; a whole calling
may have unduly lagged in the adoption of new and available devices.
It  may  never  set  its  own  tests,  however  persuasive  be  its  usages.
Courts must in the end say what is required; there are precautions so
imperative  that  even  their  universal  disregard  will  not  excuse  their
omission.  But  here  there  was  no  custom  at  all  as  to  receiving  sets;
some had them, some did not; the most that can be urged is that they
had  not  yet  become  general.  Certainly  in  such  a  case  we  need  not
pause; when some have thought a device necessary, at least we may
say  that  they  were  right,  and  the  others  too  slack.  The  statute
(section  484,  title  46,  U.S.  Code  [46  USCA  §484])  does  not  bear  on
this  situation  at  all.  It  prescribes  not  a  receiving,  but  a  transmitting
set, and for a very different purpose; to call for help, not to get news.
We hold the tugs therefore because had they been properly equipped,
they  would  have  got  the  Arlington  reports.  The  injury  was  a  direct
consequence of this unseaworthiness.

Decree afﬁrmed.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Statutes vs. Industry Customs.  In the famous The T.J. Hooper
case, the defendant hoped that the tugboat industry custom was its
safe harbor, but the court sunk that argument. Judge Hand, in a bit of
hyperbole,  stated  that  “there  was  no  custom  at  all”  yet  earlier  in  the
opinion  acknowledged  that  only  one  tugboat  line  kept  an  ofﬁcial
working radio on board; all the rest failed to have such a policy. If the
doctrine  of  negligence  per  se  is  premised  upon  deference  to

legislative (and executive branch agencies’) determination as to what
“reasonable care under the circumstances” might sometimes require,
why  does  the  court  not  afford  similar  weight  to  an  industry’s
practices?  Does  the  court  say  that  industry  custom  might  provide
some evidence of what ordinary prudence is? If custom is not given
controlling, standard-of-care weight, why should it be relevant how an
industry  normally  operates?  How  might  this  evidence  inform  the
application of the Learned Hand formula?

2.  Swords  and  Shields.   In  cases  where  the  defendant’s  conduct
has fallen short of industry practices, the plaintiff would be using the
evidence  of  industry  practice  as  a  sword  to  afﬁrmatively  establish  a
breach  of  the  duty  of  reasonable  care.  On  the  other  hand,  where  a
defendant  is  pointing  to  its  adherence  to  an  industry  practice,  it  is
using the evidence defensively as a shield to attempt to protect itself
from  being  found  liable.  According  to  the  court  in  The  T.J.  Hooper,
and the many cases that have cited it since it was handed down, the
legal  effect  or  evidentiary  weight  given  to  industry  custom  is  the
same  regardless  of  whether  it  is  used  as  a  sword  or  shield.
Practically,  however,  when  might  a  jury  tend  to  give  the  industry
custom  more  weight  in  its  determination  of  the  issue  of  breach —
when the defendant company has adhered to the custom (shield) or
when the plaintiff shows the defendant company has failed to live up
to the custom of others within its own industry (sword)?

3. Custom  Within  the  Tug  Industry.   In  The  T.J.  Hooper,  who  was
attempting to point to industry custom and for what purpose? Did the
court  recognize  such  a  custom?  How  much  weight  was  afforded  to
such  evidence?  Finally,  if  the  court  had  to  determine  the  issue  of
breach  without  controlling  guidance  from  industry  customs,  what
tools  did  the  court  employ  to  determine  breach?  Consider  that  the
author  of  the  opinion  is  our  famous  Learned  Hand.  Notice  how  he
observed  the  relative  inexpensiveness  of  a  tug’s  owner  maintaining
an  operational  radio  on  board,  and,  in  the  absence  of  such  advance
warnings of inclement weather, how exposed the slow moving barges

towed  by  a  tug  would  be  in  a  storm.  Do  you  see  how  this
demonstrates that with a relatively small expense, a tug’s owner can
reduce  the  foreseeable  risk  to  barges  caught  in  all-too-frequent
storms at sea?

2. Personal Custom

There are many instances where the defendant has chosen to adopt
certain  personal  customs  or  policies  for  itself.  Many  corporations
have  detailed  policies  and  procedures  manuals  designed  to  impact
the conduct of its ofﬁcers and employees. Do these internal policies
create  an  alternative  standard  of  care?  Surely  a  defendant  may  not
opt  out  of  its  tort  duty  of  reasonable  care  through  the  adoption  of
policies.  But  when  the  defendant  fails  to  adhere  to  its  own  policies,
does this provide a shortcut method for ﬁnding a breach of the duty
of  reasonable  care?  The  following  case  contains  an  insightful
discussion  into  the  problems  with  allowing  an  actor’s  personal
customs  or  policies  to  serve  as  a  substitute  for  the  duty  of
reasonable care.

WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. WRIGHT
774 N.E.2d 891 (Ind. 2002)

     , J.

Ruth Ann Wright sued for injuries she sustained when she slipped
on a puddle of water at the “Outdoor Lawn and Garden Corral” of the
Carmel  Wal-Mart.  Wright  alleged  Wal-Mart  was  negligent  in  the
maintenance,  care  and  inspection  of  the  premises,  and  Wal-Mart
asserted  contributory  negligence.  By  stipulation  of  the  parties,  a
number  of  Wal-Mart’s  employee  documents  assembled  as  a  “Store
Manual”  were  admitted  into  evidence  at  the  jury  trial  that  followed.

Several of these detailed procedures for dealing with spills and other
floor  hazards.  [The  store-mandated  procedures  included  requiring
leave  a  spill
employees  to  “react  quickly”  to  spills,  to  “never
unattended,” and to “cordon off” any area containing spills.] At the end
of the trial, Wright tendered the following instruction:

There was in effect at the time of the Plaintiff’s injury a store manual and safety
handbook prepared by the Defendant, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., and issued to Wal-
Mart Store, Inc. employees. You may consider the violation of any rules, policies,
practices  and  procedures  contained  in  these  manuals  and  safety  handbook
along  with  all  of  the  other  evidence  and  the  Court’s  instructions  in  deciding
whether Wal-Mart was negligent.

The  violation  of  its  rules,  policies,  practices  and  procedures  are  a  proper
item of evidence tending to show the degree of care recognized by Wal-Mart as
ordinary care under the conditions speciﬁed in its rules, policies, practices and
procedures.

Wal-Mart objected on the ground that “you can set standards for
yourself that exceed ordinary care and the fact that you’ve done that
shouldn’t  be  used,  as  this  second  paragraph  says,  as  evidence
tending  to  show  the  degree  that  you  believe  is  ordinary.  The  jury
decides  what  ordinary  care  is.”  The  court  overruled  the  objection  to
Final Instruction 17. The court also instructed the jury that, inter alia,
(1) the jury was to consider all the instructions as a whole, and should
not  “single  out  any  certain  sentence  or  any  individual  point  or
instruction  and  ignore  the  other”  instructions;  (2)  Wal-Mart  was
required  to  maintain  its  property  in  a  reasonably  safe  condition
suitable for use by its customers; . . . [and (3)] negligence is the failure
to do what a reasonably careful and prudent person would do under
the same or similar circumstances or the doing of something that a
reasonably careful and prudent person would not do under the same
or similar circumstances . . . .

The  jury  found  Wal-Mart  liable  and  assessed  Wright’s  total
damages  at  $600,000,  reduced  to  $420,000  by  30%  comparative
fault  attributed  to  Wright.  Wal-Mart  appealed,  contending  that  the

second paragraph of Final Instruction 17 was an improper statement
of law that incorrectly altered the standard of care from an objective
one  to  a  subjective  one.  The  Court  of  Appeals  afﬁrmed,  holding  the
challenged  paragraph  of  the  instruction  was  proper  because  it  “did
not  require  the  jury  to  ﬁnd  that  ordinary  care,  as  recognized  by  Wal-
Mart,  was  the  standard  to  which  Wal-Mart  should  be  held,”  and
because the trial court had not “instructed the jury that reasonable or
ordinary  care  was  anything  other  than  that  of  a  reasonably,  careful
and ordinarily prudent person.” This Court granted transfer.

When  an  instruction  is  challenged  as  an  incorrect  statement  of
the  law  .  .  .  appellate  review  of  the  ruling  is  de  novo.  Here,  Wal-Mart
argues  that  the  second  paragraph  of  Final  Instruction  17  incorrectly
stated the law because it invited jurors to apply Wal-Mart’s subjective
view of the standard of care as evidenced by the Manual, rather than
an  objective  standard  of  ordinary  care.  Wright  responds  that  the
paragraph simply allows jurors to consider Wal-Mart’s subjective view
of ordinary care as some evidence of what was in fact ordinary care,
and does not convert the objective standard to a subjective one.

Initially,  we  note  that  implicit  in  each  of  these  positions,  and
explicit in the second paragraph of the instruction, is the assumption
that the Manual in fact “tends to show the degree of care recognized
by  Wal-Mart  as  ordinary  care  under  the  conditions  speciﬁed  in  [the
Manual].” Wal-Mart also objected to this assumption, contending “you
can set standards for yourself that exceed ordinary care and the fact
that  you’ve  done  that  shouldn’t  be  used,  as  this  second  paragraph
says,  as  evidence  tending  to  show  the  degree  that  you  believe  is
ordinary.” We agree. The second paragraph of the instruction told the
jurors  that  because  Wal-Mart  has  established  certain  rules  and
policies,  those  rules  and  policies  are  evidence  of  the  degree  of  care
recognized by Wal-Mart as ordinary care. But Wal-Mart is correct that
its  rules  and  policies  may  exceed  its  view  of  what  is  required  by
ordinary  care  in  a  given  situation.  Rules  and  policies  in  the  Manual
may have been established for any number of reasons having nothing

to do with safety and ordinary care, including a desire to appear more
clean  and  neat  to  attract  customers,  or  a  concern  that  spills  may
contaminate merchandise.

The  law  has  long  recognized  that  failure  to  follow  a  party’s
precautionary  steps  or  procedures  is  not  necessarily  failure  to
exercise ordinary care. 57 Am. Jur. 2d Negligence §187 at 239 (1998)
(failure to follow company rule does not constitute negligence per se;
jury  may  consider  rule,  but  rule  does  not  set  standard  of  conduct
establishing  what  law  requires  of  a  reasonable  person  under  the
circumstances);  1  J.D.  Lee  and  Barry  A.  Lindahl,  Modern  Tort  Law
§3.29  (1996)  (“Company  rules  are  generally  admissible  but  not
conclusive  on  the  question  of  the  standard  of  care.”).  We  think  this
rule  is  salutary  because  it  encourages  following  the  best  practices
without necessarily establishing them as a legal norm.

There is a second problem with the instruction. Even if the Manual
reflected  Wal-Mart’s  subjective  view  of  ordinary  care,  the  second
paragraph  of  the  instruction  incorrectly  states  the  law  because  it
invites  jurors  to  apply  Wal-Mart’s  subjective  view — as  evidenced  by
the Manual — rather than an objective standard of ordinary care. It is
axiomatic that in a negligence action “the standard of conduct which
the  community  demands  must  be  an  external  and  objective  one,
rather  than  the  individual  judgment,  good  or  bad,  of  the  particular
actor.”  W.  Page  Keeton  et  al.,  Prosser  &  Keeton  on  the  Law  of  Torts
§32,  at  173-74  &  n.3  (5th  ed.  1984).  An  individual  “actor’s  belief  that
he is using reasonable care is immaterial.” Keeton, supra, §32, at 174
n.3. This door swings both ways. A defendant’s belief that it is acting
reasonably  is  no  defense  if  its  conduct  falls  below  reasonable  care.
Similarly,  a  defendant’s  belief  that  it  should  perform  at  a  higher
standard than objective reasonable care is equally irrelevant. As one
court  succinctly  put  it,  “a  party’s  own  rules  of  conduct  are  relevant
and can be received into evidence with an express caution that they
are merely evidentiary and not to serve as a legal standard.” Mayo v.
Publix Super Mkts, Inc., 686 So. 2d 801, 802 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1997).

Wright  cites  four  cases  in  support  of  the  instruction:  Smith  v.
Cleveland C.C. & St. L. Ry. Co., 117 N.E. 534 (Ind. 1917); N.Y. Cent. Ry.
Co.  v.  Wyatt,  184  N.E.2d  657  (Ind.  1962);  Cent.  Ind.  Ry.  Co.  v.
Anderson  Banking  Co.,  240  N.E.2d  840  (Ind.  App.  1968);  and
Frankfort  v.  Owens,  358  N.E.2d  184  (Ind.  App.  1976).  These
authorities  support  the  admissibility  of  the  Manual,  which  Wal-Mart
does not contest. They do not support an instruction to consider any
“violation” of the Manual as “evidence tending to show the degree of
care  recognized  by  Wal-Mart  as  ordinary  care  under  the  conditions.”
We  conclude  that  the  second  paragraph  of  Final  Instruction  17  was
invitation  to  deviate  from  the  accepted  objective
an
standard of ordinary care and therefore incorrectly stated the law.

improper

When a jury instruction incorrectly states the law, we assume that
the  erroneous  instruction  influenced  the  verdict  and  will  reverse
unless  the  verdict  would  have  been  the  same  under  a  proper
instruction. This instruction suffered from two flaws. It equated Wal-
Mart’s  procedures  with  reasonable  care  and  it  asserted  that  Wal-
Mart’s  subjective  view  of  reasonable  care  was  relevant.  No  other
instruction  corrected  these  problems.  Accordingly,  read  together
these  instructions  introduced  the  concept  of  reasonable  or  ordinary
care, directed the jurors to consider the Manual as evidence tending
to  show  what  Wal-Mart  “recognized”  that  ordinary  care  to  be,  and
thereby  implied  that  a  violation  of  the  Manual  was  a  violation  of
ordinary care.

The  judgment  of  the  trial  court  is  reversed.  This  action  is

remanded for a new trial.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. A Party’s Own Customs/Habits/Policies.  In the above case, Wal-
Mart  (a  common  defense  litigant  in  tort  cases)  had  a  written  policy
and  procedure  manual  that  required  its  employees  to  behave  in  a

particular  way  under  the  circumstances  of  a  spill  on  the  store  floor.
How  was  the  plaintiff  attempting  to  use  this  manual?  What  did  the
trial court’s various instructions suggest to the jury about the weight
to be given this evidence?

2. Standard of Care vs. Admissibility as Evidence.   Wal-Mart  never
disputed  the  admissibility  of  the  manual  into  evidence.  It  just  took
exception to the particular jury instruction that became the subject of
the  court’s  opinion  on  appeal.  Why  do  courts  routinely  hold  that
evidence  of  a  party’s  own  customs/policies/habits  is  relevant  to  the
determination  of  breach  of  the  duty  of  ordinary  care?  How  should
such evidence (whether used as a sword or shield) be relevant to the
factors reflected by the Learned Hand formula? In the Wal-Mart case,
what might the existence of such a policy indicate, if the policy is not
followed by the employees?

D. Res Ipsa Loquitur

in

lack

thereof,  with

industry  custom

The  Learned  Hand  formula  provides  a  very  flexible  tool  for
determining if an actor has met the duty of reasonable care in a broad
variety of circumstances. Juries often use evidence of a defendant’s
their
compliance,  or
determination  of  what  reasonable  care  under  the  circumstances
might actually require. And when the legislature has done the math in
advance,  we  presume  that  a  party’s  failure  to  adhere  to  a  relevant
statute is a breach of the duty. In each of these instances, we have a
pretty  good  idea  what  the  defendant’s  speciﬁc  challenged  conduct
involved. But is it even possible for a plaintiff to persuade a jury that a
defendant has breached its duty in situations where the plaintiff lacks
direct evidence of the defendant’s conduct? The evidentiary doctrine
of  res  ipsa  loquitur — which  means  “the  thing  speaks  for  itself” —
shows that plaintiffs, even in the absence of direct proof of a breach,
might  still  prevail.  The  famous  case  of  Byrne  v.  Boadle  introduces

this  doctrine.  After  reviewing  this  case,  we  will  consider  a  more
modern application of its principles.

BYRNE v. BOADLE
159 Eng. Rep. 299 (Ex. 1863)

       , C.B.

[Plaintiff was walking alongside defendant’s building when he was
hit on the head by a barrel that fell from the defendant shop’s second
floor window. Plaintiff failed to offer direct evidence at trial as to what
defendant  had  done,  or  failed  to  do,  that  permitted  the  barrel  to  fall
from  his  shop.  The  trial  court  dismissed  the  plaintiff’s  negligence
claim due to this lack of direct evidence.]

We are of the opinion that the rule must be absolute to enter the
verdict for the plaintiff. The learned counsel was quite right in saying
that  there  are  many  accidents  from  which  no  presumption  of
negligence can arise, but I think it would be wrong to lay down as a
rule that in no case can presumption of negligence arise from the fact
of  an  accident.  Suppose  in  this  case  the  barrel  had  rolled  out  of  the
warehouse  and  fall  on  the  plaintiff,  how  could  he  possibly  ascertain
from  what  cause  it  occurred?  It  is  the  duty  of  persons  who  keep
barrels  in  a  warehouse  to  take  care  that  they  do  not  roll  out,  and  I
think  that  such  a  case  would,  beyond  all  doubt,  afford  prima  facie
evidence  of  negligence.  A  barrel  could  not  roll  out  of  a  warehouse
without some negligence, and to say that a plaintiff who is injured by
it  must  call  witnesses  from  the  warehouse  to  prove  negligence
seems to me preposterous. So in the building or repairing a house, or
putting  pots  on  the  chimneys,  if  a  person  passing  along  the  road  is
injured  by  something  falling  upon  him,  I  think  the  accident  alone
would  be  prima  facie  evidence  of  negligence.  Or  if  an  article
calculated  to  cause  damage  is  put  in  a  wrong  place  and  does
mischief,  I  think  that  those  whose  duty  it  was  to  put  it  in  the  right

place are prima facie responsible, and if there is any state of facts to
rebut  the  presumption  of  negligence,  they  must  prove  them.  The
present  case  upon  the  evidence  comes  to  this,  a  man  in  passing  in
front  of  the  premises  of  a  dealer  in  flour,  and  there  falls  down  upon
him  a  barrel  of  flour.  I  think  it  apparent  that  the  barrel  was  in  the
custody  of  the  defendant  who  occupied  the  premises,  and  who  is
responsible for the acts of his servants who had the control of it; and
in  my  opinion  the  fact  of  its  falling  is  prima  facie  evidence  of
negligence,  and  the  plaintiff  who  was  injured  by  it  is  not  bound  to
shew  that  it  could  not  fall  without  negligence,  but  if  there  are  any
facts  inconsistent  with  negligence  it  is  for  the  defendant  to  prove
them.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Effect of Res Ipsa Loquitur’s Application.  Despite some of the
language  in  Byrne  about  the  doctrine  creating  a  “presumption”  of
negligence,  the  vast  majority  of  courts  today  hold  that  the  doctrine
merely creates a possible inference of the defendant’s negligence —
which the jury is free to accept or reject. The practical impact of the
doctrine, therefore, is not to guarantee a verdict for the plaintiff but to
simply  give  the  plaintiff  a  chance  to  win.  When  the  doctrine  applies,
the  plaintiff  has  offered  sufﬁcient
courts
circumstantial  evidence  of  breach  to  avoid  a  directed  verdict  for  the
defendant.  This  doctrine  permits  the  plaintiff  to  get  the  issue  of
breach before the jury. The jury can ﬁnd the circumstantial inference
of breach persuasive or not. Compare this effect with that created by
the doctrine of negligence per se.

2.  Doctrine’s  Prerequisites.   Stated  simply,  res  ipsa  loquitur
requires evidence that (1) the nature of a particular accident suggests
that  it  was  probably  due  to  negligence;  (2)  the  defendant  had
exclusive control over whatever caused the accident (such that it was

the defendant’s negligence); and (3) the plaintiff lacks direct evidence
of  the  event  relative  to  the  information  available  to  the  defendant.
Some courts used to say that the circumstances must also indicate
that the plaintiff was not at fault, but this is misleading because item
(2)  already  negates  such  a  requirement  and,  further,  because  such
language is more a reflection of the common law’s harsh treatment of
contributory  negligence  than  an  aspect  of  the  doctrine  of  res  ipsa
loquitur.  We  will  consider  contributory  negligence  in  Chapter  7  on
Afﬁrmative Defenses.

KREBS v. CORRIGAN
321 A.2d 558 (D.C. Ct. App. 1974)

       , J.

This  is  an  appeal  from  a  directed  verdict  entered  in  favor  of
appellees  (defendants)  at  the  conclusion  of  appellant’s  (plaintiff’s)
case
in  chief.  The  complaint  alleged  that  defendant  Bronson
negligently caused damage to personal property belonging to plaintiff
and  that  defendant  Donald  Corrigan  was  liable  for  such  damage  as
Bronson’s principal.

The  evidence  reflected  the  following.  Plaintiff  is  an  artist  who
creates  plexiglass  sculptures.  On  the  morning  of  the  accident  he
entered his studio to ﬁnd a station wagon parked within, just inside of
a  10’  roll-back  garage  door.  The  bumper  was  very  close  to  a  large
sculpture.  The  car  had  been  placed  there  by  defendant  Bronson  so
that  he  could  avoid  the  chill  of  the  morning  while  endeavoring  to  ﬁx
some  dents  in  the  automobile.  Although  plaintiff  had  not  given
Bronson permission to put the car in the studio, he did not order him
to  remove  the  car  at  once.  However,  after  giving  Bronson  a  dent-
removing tool, so as to expedite his work, and instructing him on the
use of the tool, he asked him to remove the car as soon as possible.
At that moment the telephone (which was on a nearby wall) rang and

plaintiff proceeded to answer it. From that position he could see the
studio area, but his attention was away from Bronson as he talked on
the telephone. While still on the phone, plaintiff glanced back toward
where Bronson was working and saw him “flying through the air . . . at
least  three  feet  off  the  ground — and  he  landed  in  the  middle  of  [a
plexiglass sculpture].” Four sculptures in all were destroyed.

Upon  the  conclusion  of  plaintiff’s  case,  defendants  moved  for  a
directed verdict on the ground that plaintiff had not presented a prima
facie  case  of  negligence.  After  extended  argument,  mainly  involving
the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, the court granted defendants’ motion
and  directed  a  verdict  in  their  favor.  The  judge,  in  explaining  his
decision  to  the  jury,  indicated  that  a  verdict  was  directed  because
plaintiff could not show what caused defendant Bronson’s body to fall
or be thrown onto the sculptures.

This  information  was  not  only  unknown  to  plaintiff  but  was
peculiarly  within  the  knowledge  of  the  defendant  Bronson.  He,  of
course,  never  testiﬁed  as  to  any  explanation  he  might  have  had  for
the accident, since his motion for a directed verdict was granted. We
do  not  believe  a  plaintiff  ought  to  be  held  to  that  burden  on  these
facts  which,  left  unexplained,  support  an  inference  of  negligence.
Accordingly, we reverse and remand for a new trial.

It  is  well  established,  to  the  extent  that  a  citation  of  authority  is
unnecessary,  that  the  mere  happening  of  an  accident  does  not  give
rise  to  any  inference  of  negligence.  On  the  other  hand,  it  is
established that the circumstances of certain accidents may be such
as to justify an inference that negligence was involved. In the District
of Columbia an inference that defendant may have been negligent is
permitted when the following three conditions exist: ﬁrst, the cause of
accident-producing
the
instrumentality  is  under  the  exclusive  control  of  the  defendant;  and
third, the instrumentality is unlikely to do harm without negligence on
the  part  of  the  person  in  control.  Powers  v.  Coates,  D.C.  App.,  203

factors  distinguishes  such  cases  from  the  vast  majority  that  lack
those features, concerning which it is said that negligence is not to be
inferred from the mere happening of an accident.

In  the  case  before  us  there  is  no  doubt  that  the  cause  of  the
accident  was  known,  i.e.,  the  sculpture  was  damaged  by  Bronson’s
falling  on  it.  To  say  that  the  cause  of  the  accident  was  not  known,
because there was no evidence as to what caused Bronson to come
into contact with the sculptures, “confuses the cause of the accident
with the manner in which it was caused, lack of knowledge of which,
in plaintiff, is a reason for the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. . . .” Kerlin v.

94 U.S. App. D.C. 39, 211 F.2d 649 (1954). The doctrine was applied in
that  case  where  the  evidence  reflected  that  plaintiff,  while  standing
on  the  sidewalk,  was  struck  by  an  object  propelled  from  an  area
where defendant’s employees were digging with picks.

Nor

there  any  doubt

the  accident-producing
instrumentality,  Bronson’s  body,  was  within  his  exclusive  control.
Defendants’ contention that the dent-removing tool was the accident-
producing  instrumentality,  and  that  Bronson  did  not  have  exclusive
control over that tool, misses the mark. The dent-removing tool, if at
all  involved  in  this  case,  was  in  the  control  of  defendant  and  would
only  be  related  to  the  “manner  in  which  [the  accident]  was  caused.”
Kerlin, supra.

Lastly, as in other situations permitting the application of res ipsa
loquitur,  we  consider  it  of  no  small  signiﬁcance  that  the  accident-
producing instrumentality, Bronson’s body, is one which is unlikely to
do  harm  in  the  absence  of  negligence  on  the  part  of  the  person  in
control.  Such  a  conclusion  does  not  ignore  the  possibility  of  other
explanations  for  the  incident,  explanations  which  might  not  involve
negligence;  but  human  bodies  do  not  generally  go  crashing  into
breakable  personal  property.  When  they  do,  as  here,  we  think  the
facts  require  the  court  to  permit  an  inference  of  negligence.  The

person in control of the body or instrumentality may come forth with
an  explanation.  To  have  to  explain  the  actions  of  one’s  body  is
certainly  not  unreasonable  and  is  less  burdensome  than  to  have  to
explain  why  a  barrel  of  flour  fell  out  of  one’s  warehouse  onto  a
pedestrian, a situation to which res ipsa loquitur was held applicable
in Byrne v. Boadle, 159 Eng. Rep. 299 (Ex. 1863).

Appellees  also  contend  that  appellant  could  not  rely  on  the
doctrine of res ipsa loquitur because there was an eyewitness to the
accident,  i.e.,  defendant  Bronson,  and  that  appellant  should  have
called  Bronson  as  a  witness  before  being  allowed  to  invoke  res  ipsa
loquitur.  To  our  knowledge  this  court  has  never  held  that  a  plaintiff
may not invoke the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur when the defendant is
an eyewitness. In fact, on many occasions we have noted that one of
the  main  reasons  for  the  doctrine  is  the  superior,  if  not  exclusive,
knowledge  which  defendants  sometimes  have  as  to  the  cause  of
accidents.  If  requiring  a  plaintiff  to  call  the  defendant  as  an  adverse
witness was deemed a sufﬁcient method of determining the cause of
an  accident,  there  would  be  no  need  for  the  doctrine  of  res  ipsa
loquitur.  The  doctrine  exists  because  of  the  realization  that
examination of a defendant as an adverse witness is not a viable way
to discover the cause of an accident.

In  deciding  whether  or  not  res  ipsa  loquitur  is  applicable,  courts
necessarily  are  mindful  of  the  different  effects  which  that  decision
will  have  on  the  parties  and  the  trial.  If  res  ipsa  loquitur  is  not
employed,  plaintiff’s  case  is  terminated  even  though  he  suffered  an
injury that was caused by the defendant. If res ipsa loquitur is found
applicable,  defendant  is  put  to  no  greater  burden  than  to  produce
information  peculiarly  within  his  knowledge  as  to  how  the  incident
occurred. Even if that explanation is unsatisfactory or indeed even if
no explanation is made, the jury is free to decline to draw an inference
of negligence, and it is so instructed.

We  ﬁnd  that  the  plaintiff’s  evidence,  considered  in  the  light  most
favorable  to  him,  as  must  be  done  in  ruling  on  the  motion  for  a

directed verdict by a defendant, was sufﬁcient to raise an inference of
negligence so as to survive the defendants’ motion and to put them
to their proof.

Reversed for a new trial.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Exclusive Control.  What did the defendant mean in arguing that
he  lacked  exclusive  control  over  the  instrumentality  that  caused  the
plaintiff’s harm? Why did the court reject this?

2.  Plaintiff’s  Lack  of  Information.   Defendant  argued  that  the
plaintiff  had  the  same  access  to  information  as  the  defendant,
because the plaintiff could have called him as an adverse witness to
testify  concerning  the  cause  of  the  accident,  but  chose  not  to.
Because the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is premised, in part, on the
unfairness of requiring the plaintiff to offer direct evidence when only
circumstantial  evidence  is  available,  why  did  the  court  reject  this
argument?

3.  Problem.   Using  the  facts  from  The  T.J.  Hooper,  analyze
whether the plaintiff could have argued for application of the doctrine
of res ipsa loquitur in that case.

“LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY . . .”

Iowa Pattern Jury Charge 700.07: Res Ipsa Loquitur

Under the rules of general negligence, the occurrence of an
injury allows you to conclude that the defendant was negligent
if  the  plaintiff  proves  (1)  the  injury  was  caused  by  [the
instrument]  under  the  exclusive  control  of  the  defendant,  and
(2)  the  injury  would  not  have  occurred  if  ordinary  care  had
been used.

The  plaintiff  must  prove  the  defendant  had  exclusive

control when the negligence occurred.

The  plaintiff  must  also  prove  the  occurrence  would  not
have  happened  if  ordinary  care  had  been  used.  Proof  of  this
requirement rests on common experience.

V  RECKLESSNESS AS AN ALTERNATIVE

STANDARD

Throughout  this  chapter  we  have  been  exploring  the  standard  of
ordinary  or  reasonable  care.  And  we  have  used  the  Learned  Hand
formula  to  understand  how  a  plaintiff  typically  proves  that  the
defendant has breached this duty — by failing to undertake a burden
less  than  the  foreseeable  risk  of  harm  to  others.  However,  tort  law
sometimes  replaces  the  normal  reasonable  care  standard  with
recklessness  (also  referred  to  as  either  gross  negligence  or  by  the
phrase willful, wanton, or reckless) as a different governing standard.
This  can  either  be  due  to  courts  modifying  the  common  law  in  a
particular instance or due to legislative enactment — we will see such
examples  in  Chapter  6  Special  Duty  Rules.  Further,  a  plaintiff  might
want  to  offer  proof  of  recklessness  in  order  to  attempt  to  recover
punitive damages, as in the following case. As you read the following
case  describing  alleged  gross  negligence,  consider  how  gross
negligence  or  recklessness  is  different  than  ordinary  negligence  and
how it might be displayed, by reference to the Learned Hand formula.

MOBIL v. ELLENDER
968 S.W.2d 917 (Tex. 1998)

     , J.

Eli  Ellender  worked  periodically  as  an  independent  contractor
millwright at Mobil’s Beaumont reﬁnery and chemical plants between
1963  and  1977.  As  a  millwright,  Ellender  repaired,  serviced,  and
cleaned pumps, product lines, and other equipment. While working at
Mobil,  Ellender  was  exposed  to  benzene.  He  was  diagnosed  with
acute  myelogenous  leukemia  and  died  in  1989.  Ellender’s  surviving

family, individually and on behalf of his estate, sued Mobil and other
defendants,  alleging  that  exposure  to  benzene  caused  Ellender’s
leukemia  and  subsequent  death.  Speciﬁcally,  the  Ellenders  alleged
that Mobil was negligent [and] grossly negligent in: (1) failing to warn
Ellender about his exposure to benzene on Mobil’s premises and the
risks associated with it, and (2) failing to protect Ellender from those
risks. Just before trial, all defendants, except Mobil, agreed to settle.
Before  the  trial  court  submitted  the  case  to  the  jury,  Mobil  elected  a
dollar-for-dollar  settlement  credit.  See  Tex.  Civ.  Prac.  &  Rem.  Code
§33.014.  The  jury  found  that  Mobil’s  conduct  was  grossly  negligent
and  awarded  the  Ellenders  $622,888.97  in  compensatory  damages
and $6,000,000 in punitive damages.

Mobil  ﬁrst  argues  that  there  is  legally  insufﬁcient  evidence  to
support the jury’s ﬁndings that Mobil’s conduct was grossly negligent.
Gross negligence includes two elements: (1) viewed objectively from
the  actor’s  standpoint,  the  act  or  omission  must  involve  an  extreme
degree  of  risk,  considering  the  probability  and  magnitude  of  the
potential  harm  to  others,  and  (2)  the  actor  must  have  actual,
subjective awareness of the risk involved, but nevertheless proceed in
conscious indifference to the rights, safety, or welfare of others. See
Transportation  Ins.  Co.  v.  Moriel,  879  S.W.2d  10,  23  (Tex.  1994).
Evidence  of  simple  negligence  is  not  enough  to  prove  either  the
objective  or  subjective  elements  of  gross  negligence.  See  Universal
Servs.  Co.  v.  Ung,  904  S.W.2d  638,  641  (Tex.  1995);  Moriel,  879
S.W.2d  at  22-23.  Under  the  ﬁrst  element,  “extreme  risk”  is  not  a
remote possibility of injury or even a high probability of minor harm,
but rather the likelihood of serious injury to the plaintiff. See Ung, 904
S.W.2d  at  641;  Moriel,  879  S.W.2d  at  22.  Under  the  second  element,
actual awareness means that the defendant knew about the peril, but
its acts or omissions demonstrated that it did not care. See Wal-Mart
Inc.  v.  Alexander,  868  S.W.2d  322,  326  (Tex.  1993).
Stores,
Circumstantial evidence is sufﬁcient to prove either element of gross

negligence.  See  Moriel,  879  S.W.2d  at  22-23;  Wal-Mart  Stores,  868
S.W.2d at 327.

Mobil  asserts  that  there  is  legally  insufﬁcient  evidence  of  an
extreme  risk  to  Ellender  of  serious  injury  from  benzene  exposure  at
Mobil’s  facilities.  Mobil  argues  that  the  trial  court  and  the  court  of
appeals  improperly  relied  on  evidence  of  Mobil’s  conduct  and  the
resultant  risks  arising  after  Ellender  worked  at  Mobil.  We  conclude
that  legally  sufﬁcient  evidence  shows  that,  viewed  objectively  from
Mobil’s standpoint when Ellender worked at Mobil, Mobil did not warn
contract workers about benzene exposure or protect them from it and
this failure involved an extreme degree of risk to those workers.

There  is  evidence  that,  from  Mobil’s  viewpoint  during  the  period
Ellender worked at Mobil in the 1960s and 1970s, the extreme degree
of risk associated with benzene exposure was common knowledge in
the  petrochemical  industry.  As  early  as  1926,  the  National  Safety
Council  reported  that  “the  most  characteristic  pathological  effect  of
[benzene]  is  perhaps  its  destructive  influence  upon  the  cells  of  the
blood  and  the  blood  forming  organs.”  Mobil  stipulated  NSC
membership  dating  back  to  1922.  In  1948,  the  American  Petroleum
Institute  reported  that  benzene  could  cause  leukemia  and  that  the
only  absolutely  safe  concentration  for  benzene  was  zero.  The  API
report  also  warned  that  a  person  should  avoid  all  contact  with
benzene  if  possible,  but  that  if  the  hands  must  contact  the  solvent,
then  a  person  should  use  neoprene  gloves  or  protective  creams.
Mobil stipulated API membership dating back to 1919.

“A pinch of probability is worth a
pound of perhaps.”

Dr.  R.J.  Potts,  Mobil’s
for

medical
Western
(including

Beaumont) from 1960 to 1983,
testiﬁed  that  he  believed  Mobil
had  knowledge  of  benzene
in  the  1950s.  The
hazards
record  shows  other  petrochemical  companies  had  knowledge  of

James Thurber

benzene  hazards.  For  example,  Conoco’s  1953  Employee  Safety
Manual  included  information  from  the  1948  API  report  and  warned
that  the  only  safe  level  of  benzene  exposure  was  zero.  Conoco  also
warned that workers should use air masks in case of benzene leaks
and neoprene gloves in case of hand contact. In 1948, Exxon noted a
deﬁnite  correlation  between  benzene  and  cancer.  A  1943  report  to
Shell  warned  that  prolonged  exposure  to  low  concentrations  of
benzene may be very dangerous.

There

is  evidence

that  Ellender’s  benzene  exposure  was
dangerously high. Mobil’s own benzene samples, taken at the oleﬁns
and  aromatic  plant  where  Ellender  periodically  worked  in  the  1960s
and  1970s,  showed  dangerous  levels  of  benzene  exposure  between
1976  and  1978.  These  levels  were  many  times  more  than  levels  the
Occupational  Safety  and  Health  Administration  considered
dangerous in 1977. Roy Gatlin, one of Ellender’s co-workers, testiﬁed
that  on  many  occasions  he  and  Ellender  steam-cleaned  equipment
containing benzene and inhaled benzene. Gatlin and other co-workers
also testiﬁed that workers used benzene, furnished by Mobil, to wash
their  tools  and  hands  as  often  as  daily.  Russell  Witzke,  an  industrial
hygienist  at  Mobil  from  1973  to  1976  admitted  that  benzene  was
always  being  spilled  on  the  ground  when  piping  equipment  was
connected and disconnected.

Dr.  Eula  Bingham,  a  toxicologist  specializing  in  environmental
occupational health, reviewed testimony about Ellender’s exposure to
benzene  and  described  it  as  “substantial.”  Dr.  John  M.  Dement,  a
industrial hygienist and epidemiologist, reviewed the same testimony
and  described  Ellender’s  exposure  as  “signiﬁcant  lifetime  exposure
that would have put him at increased risk for leukemia.”

David  B.  Dunham,  a  Mobil  industrial  hygienist,  testiﬁed  that
although Mobil monitored its employees, it had an “unwritten practice
or  policy”  not  to  monitor  contract  workers  and  that  when  he
attempted to monitor contract workers, he was told not to. Ellender’s
co-workers  testiﬁed  that  they  never  saw  any  signs  warning  them  of

benzene  hazards  at  Mobil  and  that  Mobil  did  not  monitor  them  for
exposure  or  provide  them  with  protective  gear  when  they  worked
around  benzene.  Moreover,  Mobil  did  not  include  any  reference  to
benzene  or  other  chemicals  in  its  1967  pamphlet  entitled  “Mobil
Safety  and  Security  Regulations  for  Contract  Workers.”  Dr.  Josh
Esslinger,  a  former  medical  consultant  for  Mobil  in  Beaumont,
testiﬁed  that  he  knew  workers  washed  their  hands  in  benzene  and
that  such  a  practice  indicated  that  workers  were  not  adequately
warned  of  benzene  hazards.  Dr.  Dement  testiﬁed  that  Mobil’s
industrial  hygiene  program  was  poor  and  practically  nonexistent  for
contractors.  This  is  evidence  from  which  the  jury  could  reasonably
infer  that  Mobil  had  a  company  policy  of  not  monitoring  contract
workers  for  benzene  exposure,  not  warning  them  of  the  dangers  of
such exposure, and not providing them with protective gear and that
this policy involved an extreme degree of risk to those workers.

We  conclude  that  there  is  legally  sufﬁcient  evidence  that  Mobil’s
conduct, viewed objectively from Mobil’s point of view when Ellender
worked  at  Mobil,  involved  an  extreme  degree  of  risk  to  contract
workers like Ellender.

Mobil  also  asserts  that  there  is  legally  insufﬁcient  evidence  of
gross negligence’s subjective element. Mobil argues that the court of
appeals  erred  in  relying  on  evidence  of  general  knowledge  of  some
benzene  exposure  risks  to  afﬁrm  the  ﬁnding  of  actual  awareness  of
an extreme risk. Mobil further argues that there is no evidence that a
Mobil  [executive]  knew  of  an  extreme  risk  to  contract  workers.  We
conclude  that  there  is  legally  sufﬁcient  evidence  that  Mobil  .  .  .  had
actual awareness of the extreme risk benzene exposure involves, but
nevertheless proceeded in conscious indifference to the rights, safety
or welfare of Ellender and other contract workers.

Dr.  Potts,  Mobil’s  regional  medical  director  from  1960  to  1983,
testiﬁed  that  even  before  he  became  medical  director  he  knew  that
benzene  caused,  among  other  diseases,  aplastic  anemia.  He  knew
that washing hands and tools in benzene was hazardous. He further

testiﬁed  that  he  and  Dr.  Stewart,  a  physician  working  directly  under
him  at  the  Beaumont  reﬁnery,  implemented  a  plan  “to  see  that
noxious agents [including benzene] were not being used in a manner
that  was  deleterious  to  employee  health.”  Dr.  Esslinger  testiﬁed  that
Mobil  had  a  policy  to  conduct  blood  and  urine  tests  on  its  own
employees for benzene exposure and that he carried out that policy.

Dunham  testiﬁed  that  Mobil  had  a  fleet  of  industrial  hygiene
monitors  who  monitored  employees  for  benzene,  among  other
chemicals,  and  who  sent  their  results  to  Mobil’s  corporate  medical
director.  Some  of  these  samples,  including  one  sample  of  a  Mobil
maintenance  mechanic  doing  work  identical  to  the  work  Ellender
periodically  did,  showed  excessive  levels  of  benzene  exposure.
Further,  in  1969,  Mobil’s  Employee  Relations  Division  .  .  .  recognized
that  long-term  benzene  inhalation  is  the  most  likely  source  of
benzene  intoxication  and  that  continuous  exposure  to  benzene
affects  the  formation  of  red-blood  cells  in  bone  marrow.  This
circumstantial  evidence
that
Mobil . . . knew that not providing protective gear, not monitoring and
not warning workers about benzene exposure was an extreme risk to
contract workers, like Ellender, who routinely came into contact with
benzene at Mobil.

legally  sufﬁcient  evidence

is

Furthermore,  there

is  probative  evidence  that  despite  this
knowledge,  Mobil  proceeded  in  conscious  indifference  to  the  rights,
safety or welfare of contract workers like Ellender. Contrary to Mobil’s
policy of warning, monitoring, and protecting its employees, Mobil did
not  warn,  monitor,  or  protect  contract  workers  from  benzene
exposure.  Dunham  admitted  that  personal  monitoring  and  medical
surveillance are the only sure ways to assess a worker’s exposure to
benzene. Yet, Dunham testiﬁed that Mobil had an “unwritten practice
or  policy”  not  to  monitor  contract  workers  and  that  when  he
attempted to monitor contract workers, he was told not to. Ellender’s
co-workers  testiﬁed  that  they  were  not  warned  about  benzene
hazards  or  provided  benzene  protective  equipment  and  that  Mobil

actually  furnished  benzene  for  workers  to  wash  their  tools.
Dr.  Dement  testiﬁed  that  Mobil’s  failure  to  inform  workers  about
benzene  exposure  reflected  Mobil’s  conscious  disregard  for  worker
safety. Evidence that Mobil had a policy of monitoring and protecting
its own employees but chose not to do the same for contract workers
provides additional facts and circumstances for the jury to infer that
Mobil  knew  the  risks  of  benzene  exposure  yet  proceeded  with
conscious indifference toward the rights, safety or welfare of contract
workers vis-a-vis that risk.

Because there is legally sufﬁcient evidence that Mobil was grossly
negligent,  we  afﬁrm  the  jury’s  ﬁnding  of  gross  negligence  against
Mobil.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Recklessness  Deﬁned.   The  Restatement  describes  gross

negligence, as follows:

A person acts with recklessness in engaging in conduct if:

a.  the  person  knows  of  the  risk  of  harm  created  by  the

conduct . . . and

b. the precaution that would eliminate or reduce that risk
involves  burdens  that  are  so  slight  relative  to  the  magnitude
of  the  risk  as  to  render  the  person’s  failure  to  adopt  the
precaution  a  demonstration  of  the  person’s  indifference  to
the risk.

Restatement  (Third)  of  Torts  §2  (2011).  Most  courts  would  add  to
this  deﬁnition,  as  the  court  does  in  Mobil,  by  also  requiring  that  the
plaintiff prove that the risk of the activity demonstrate a “high degree
of probability” that a “substantial harm” will occur. If you compare this
to Learned Hand’s formula for ordinary negligence, how would gross
negligence vary that formula?

2. Problem.  Recall the defendant hayrick builder from Vaughan v.
Menlove at the beginning of this chapter — who took the position that
he  lacked  the  “highest  order  of  intelligence”  and  perhaps  failed  to
appreciate the risk of his actions. Would it be fair to characterize his
conduct as illustrating recklessness? Explain your answer.

Pulling It All Together

Gene  owns  and  operates  a  mid-sized  grocery  store.  Near  the
holidays he receives incentives from certain food manufacturers
to  erect  special  displays  on  the  ends  of  the  aisles  in  his  store.
This  is  a  well-established  custom  in  the  grocery  business.  One
brewery  produces  a  flavorful  beer  called  “Cheers,”  and  Cheers
pays him handsomely to display large pyramid-shaped stacks of
his  beer  around  Thanksgiving.  He  gets  paid  a  greater  amount
depending  upon  the  size  of  the  display.  Gene  builds  such  a
display  nearly  ten  feet  tall.  Of  course,  as  Thanksgiving
approaches, the store is extra busy with customers getting ready
for  their  feasts.  The  local  municipality  has  a  Fire  Code  that
requires retailers to pass an inspection with the ﬁre marshal prior
to  erecting  such  displays,  to  ensure  adequate  clearance  for
customers  to  retreat  from  a  store  during  an  emergency.  Gene
neglected to do this. Shania is a customer in the store during this
time. She has ﬁnished ﬁlling her cart with items when, as she is
passing near the Cheers display, she hears a loud noise as many
six-packs  of  Cheers  come  tumbling  down  onto  her  head,  giving

her a concussion. She is passed out and has blood pouring from
an  open  head  wound.  Nobody  sees  exactly  how  the  incident
occurred. Other customers come upon Shania’s body and yell for
Gene.  Gene  runs  over,  sees  the  blood  on  his  floor,  and  angrily
stomps to the back room to retrieve a mop to clean up the mess.
He’s  concerned  that  he  will  lose  valuable  business  if  he  doesn’t
clear  this  up  fast.  Nobody  else  intercedes  on  behalf  of  Shania
and she dies before Gene returns ten minutes later.

The  factors  considered  by  the  Hand  Formula  provide  an
analytical  construct  for  what  is  otherwise  a  purely  intuitive
method of determining whether an actor has breached the duty
of  reasonable  care.  It  is  a  cost-beneﬁt  method  of  taking  into
account  many  varying  circumstances  confronting  a  particular
actor.
Its  basic

Its  timeless  utility
inﬁnite  variety  of
considerations  can  be  applied
circumstances  to  permit  a  reasoned  analysis  of  whether  the
conduct  is  blameworthy  or  negligent.  Circumstances  that  can
easily be taken into account within the analytical conﬁnes of the
Hand  Formula  include  sudden  emergencies,  industry  customs,
the  actor’s  adoption  of  policies  and  procedures,  and  certain
character  traits  of  the  actor  in  question.  As  useful  as  the  Hand
Formula  is,  its  application  demands  that  the  factﬁnder  have
some  information  about  the  actor’s  actual  course  of  conduct
and  the  availability  of  other  alternative  courses  of  conduct.
Where  that  information  is  lacking  (e.g.,  when  barrels  fall  out  of
warehouses  for  unknown  reasons),  the  doctrine  of  res  ipsa

loquitur  acknowledges  that  circumstantial  evidence  may  be
compelling enough to permit an inference of negligence, despite
the  inability  to  scrutinize  the  actor’s  conduct  in  the  typical
manner.  Finally,  when  a  legislative  or  executive  branch  of
government has made an effort to prevent particular accidental
harms  by  mandating  a  speciﬁc  course  of  conduct,  this  can
provide a shortcut to determine breach — the reasonable person,
after all, seeks to obey the law when reasonably feasible.

1. Which raises the question — why was it originally enacted? [T]he placement of
section 308  in  chapter  7  of  title  9  of  the  Penal  Code,  dealing  with  crimes  against
religion, conscience, and “good morals,” furnishes [an] answer. While we do not have
the legislative history from 1891, it appears the statute was most probably enacted
to protect minors from the general licentiousness associated with the consumption
of  cigarettes  in  the  1890’s.  However,  we  have  found  nothing,  and  certainly
Wawanesa  has  cited  to  us  nothing,  which  would  show  that  section 308  was  ever
enacted out of some concern that minors with cigarettes would pose a ﬁre hazard.

disputed in such cases. But when one enters the world of accidental
injuries, causation often plays a vital role. We will ﬁrst pick up with the
test  for  actual  causation — the  “but-for”  test.  This  is  the  same  test
that  would  be  used  both  in  a  negligence  case  and  any  other  tort
cause  of  action.  It  is  often  straightforward  and  almost  intuitive.

Finally,  this  chapter  will  then  explore  a  second  required  test  for
legal  causation  in  a  negligence  case — proximate  cause.  As  it  turns
out, merely demanding that the defendant’s conduct constitute a but-
for  cause  often  would  permit  imposition  of  liability  on  actors  whose
conduct  was  very  remote  from  the  plaintiff’s  harm.  Without  this
additional check or limitation upon liability, the common notion is that
some  defendants  would  unfairly  be  found  liable.  We  will  explore  the
primary tests different courts use today for proximate cause.

II  ACTUAL CAUSE

A. The “But-For” Test

In  order  to  demonstrate  the  necessary  nexus  between  the
defendant’s  misconduct  and  the  plaintiff’s  harm,  a  plaintiff  must
prove  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence  that  the  misconduct  was
essential  to  bringing  about  the  harm — that  without  the  misconduct
the  plaintiff  would  not  have  suffered  the  complained  of  injury.  In
many  scenarios  this  is  not  too  difﬁcult.  A  hunter  in  the  woods  ﬁres
toward his prey without carefully surveying the area for other hunters
and accidentally shoots a fellow hunter in the leg. It is not difﬁcult to
demonstrate  actual  but-for  causation  in  this  simple  yet  realistic
scenario. Had the hunter not ﬁred his weapon without ensuring that
the  coast  was  clear,  the  injury  would  not  have  likely  occurred.
Sometimes but-for causation is more complicated. In cases where it
is  not  exactly  clear  how  the  accident  even  occurred,  demonstrating
actual causation might not be so intuitively obvious. Cay clariﬁes the
actual  burden  of  proving  but-for  causation  in  circumstances  where
the  plaintiff’s  death  is  somewhat  of  a  mystery.  The  Lyons  case
highlights  the  importance  on  focusing  upon  whether  the  wrongful
conduct of the defendant was a cause of the claimant’s harm rather
than some other innocent conduct by the defendant. And ﬁnally, the
East Texas Theatres case shows an example where plaintiff might be
able  to  prove  defendant’s  negligence  but  it  appears  the  harm  would
have occurred even had the defendant acted reasonably.

CAY v. LOUISIANA
631 So. 2d 393 (La. 1994)

      , J.

This  is  a  wrongful  death  action  ﬁled  by  the  parents  of  Keith  Cay,
who was killed in a fall from a bridge constructed and maintained by
the  Department  of  Transportation  and  Development  (DOTD).  [A]
principal issue [is] whether plaintiffs proved that DOTD’s construction
of the bridge railing at a height lower than the minimum standard for
pedestrian trafﬁc was a cause-in-fact of Cay’s fall from the bridge.

Cay,  a  twenty-seven-year-old  single  offshore  worker,  returned  to
his home in Sandy Lake from a seven-day work shift on November 3,
1987. Later that afternoon his sister drove him to Jonesville, thirteen
miles from his home, to obtain a hunting license and shotgun shells
for  a  hunting  trip  the  next  day.  Cay  cashed  a  check  for  $60.00  and
paid for the hunting items, but remained in Jonesville when his sister
returned  to  Sandy  Lake  about  7:00  p.m.  Around  10:00  p.m.  Cay
entered a barroom and stayed until about 11:00 p.m., when he left the
barroom  on  foot  after  declining  an  offer  for  a  ride  to  his  home.  He
carried an opened beer with him.

Five days later, Cay’s body was discovered on a rock bank of the
Little River, thirty-ﬁve feet below the bridge across the river. Cay would
have had to cross the bridge in order to travel from Jonesville to his
home.

Cay’s  body  was  found  in  a  thicket  of  brambles  and  brush.  The
broken brush above the body and the lack of a path through the brush
at  ground  level  indicated  that  Cay  had  fallen  from  the  bridge.  There
was  no  evidence  suggesting  suicide  or  foul  play.  [Cay  had  just
purchased  a  hunting  license  and  supplies.]  There  was  evidence,
however, that Cay, who was wearing dark clothes, was walking on the
wrong side of the road for pedestrian trafﬁc and was intoxicated.

“Ever since the ﬁrst cause

curbs,

Cay’s parents ﬁled this action against DOTD, seeking recovery on
the  basis  that  the  guard  railings  on  the  sides  of  the  bridge  were  too
low  and  therefore  unsafe  for  pedestrians  whom  DOTD  knew  were
using the bridge and that DOTD failed to provide pedestrian walkways
or signs warning pedestrians about the hazardous conditions.

The  trial  court  rendered  judgment  for  plaintiffs,  concluding  that
Cay  accidently  fell  from  the  bridge.  The  court  held  that  the  fall  was
caused  in  part  by  the  inadequate  railing  and  in  part  by  Cay’s
intoxicated  condition.  Pointing  out  that  DOTD  had  closed  the  old
bridge to both vehicular and pedestrian trafﬁc and should have been
aware that numerous pedestrians would use the new bridge to reach
a recreational park, the Trinity community and other points across the
river from Jonesville, the court found that DOTD breached its duty to
pedestrians by failing to build the side railings to a height of thirty-six
inches,  as  required  by  the  American  Association  of  State  Highway
and  Transportation  Ofﬁcials  (AASHTO)  standards  for  pedestrian
railings. The court concluded that this construction deﬁciency was a
cause of the accident in that “a higher rail would have prevented the
fall.”  Noting  that  there  was  no  evidence  establishing  what  actually
caused  the  incident,  the  court  surmised  that  Cay  was  “startled  by
oncoming  trafﬁc,  moved  quickly  to  avoid  perceived  danger,  tripped
over the low rail, lost his balance, and with nothing to prevent the fall,
fell  from  the  Little  River  Bridge.”  The  court  apportioned  fault  sixty
percent to DOTD and forty percent to Cay.

The  court  of  appeal  afﬁrmed.  The  court  concluded  that  the
inadequate  railing  was  a  cause-in-fact  of  the  accident,  stating,  “It  is
true  that  the  accident  might  have  occurred  had  the  railing  been
higher.  However,  it  is  also  true  that  the  accident  might  not  have
happened had the railing been higher.” The court further stated, “Had
the  railing  been  higher,  the  decedent  might  have  been  able  to  avoid
the accident.”

Because  these  statements  are  an  incorrect  articulation  of  the
preponderance  of  the  evidence  standard  for  the  plaintiffs’  burden  of
proof in circumstantial evidence cases, we granted certiorari.

BURDEN OF PROOF

In  a  negligence  action,  the  plaintiff  has  the  burden  of  proving
negligence  and  causation  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence.
Jordan  v.  Travelers  Ins.  Co.,  245  So.  2d  151  (La.  1971).  Proof  is
sufﬁcient  to  constitute  a  preponderance  when  the  entirety  of  the
evidence, both direct and circumstantial, establishes that the fact or
causation sought to be proved is more probable than not. Boudreaux
v. American Ins. Co., 264 So. 2d 621 (La. 1972).

One critical issue in the present case is causation, and the entirety
of  the  evidence  bearing  on  that  issue  is  circumstantial.  For  the
plaintiff to prevail in this type of case, the inferences drawn from the
circumstantial evidence must establish all the necessary elements of
a  negligence  action,  including  causation,  and  the  plaintiff  must
sustain  the  burden  of  proving  that  the  injuries  were  more  likely  than
not the result of the particular defendant’s negligence.

CAUSE-IN-FACT

Cause-in-fact is the initial inquiry in a duty-risk analysis. Cause-in-fact
is usually a “but-for” inquiry which tests whether the injury would not
have  occurred  but  for  the  defendant’s  substandard  conduct.  The

cause-in-fact issue is usually a jury question unless reasonable minds
could not differ.

The principal negligence attributed to DOTD in the present case is
the  failure  to  build  the  bridge  railings  to  the  height  required  in  the
AASHTO  standards.  The  causation  inquiry  is  whether  that  failure
caused  Cay’s  fall  or,  conversely,  whether  the  fall  would  have  been
prevented  if  DOTD  had  constructed  the  railing  at  least  thirty-six
inches high.

The  determination  of  whether  a  higher  railing  would  have
prevented Cay’s fall depends on how the accident occurred. Plaintiffs
had  the  burden  to  prove  that  a  higher  railing  would  have  prevented
Cay’s fall in the manner in which the accident occurred.

The  circumstantial  evidence  did  not  establish  the  exact  cause  of
Cay’s  fall  from  the  bridge,  but  it  is  more  likely  than  not  that  Cay’s
going  over  the  side  was  not  intentional,  either  on  his  part  or  of  the
part  of  a  third  party.  More  probably  than  not,  Cay  did  not  commit
suicide,  as  evidence  of  plans  and  preparation  for  a  hunting  trip
minimize this possibility. More probably than not, he was not pushed,
as  he  had  little  money  or  valuables  on  his  person,  and  the  evidence
from  barroom  patrons  does  not  suggest  any  hostility  toward  or  by
him during the evening. More likely than not, he was not struck by a
vehicle and knocked over the railing. It is therefore most likely that he
accidently fell over the railing.

The  evidence  suggests  that  Cay  moved  at  a  sharp  angle  toward
the  railing,  for  some  unknown  reason,  and  stumbled  over.  For
purposes  of  the  cause-in-fact  analysis,  it  matters  little  whether  his
movement  toward  the  railing  was  prompted  by  perceived  danger  of
an  approaching  automobile  or  by  staggering  in  an  intoxicated
condition  or  for  some  other  reason.  Whatever  the  cause  of  Cay’s
movement  toward  the  railing  at  a  sharp  angle,  the  cause-in-fact
is  whether  a  higher  railing  would  have  prevented  the
inquiry
accidental fall.

Principles
The Restatement articulates the
following explanation of actual
cause:

“Tortious conduct must be a factual
cause  of  harm  for  liability  to  be
imposed. Conduct is a factual cause
of  harm  when  the  harm  would  not
have occurred absent the conduct.”

The trial judge’s ﬁnding that
a  higher  railing  would  have
prevented  the  fall  is  supported
by  expert  testimony  that  the
very  reason  for  the  minimum
height  requirement  for  railing
on
for
pedestrian  use  is  to  have  a
railing  above  the  center  of
gravity  of  most  persons  using
the bridge so that the users will
not fall over.

cause-in-fact
determination is one of fact on
which  appellate  courts  must
accord great deference to the trial court. We cannot say that the trial
court  erred  manifestly  in  determining  that  a  railing  built  to  AASHTO
minimum  speciﬁcations  would  have  prevented  Cay’s  fall  when  he
approached the railing at a sharp angle, although the exact cause of
Cay’s approaching the railing at a sharp angle is not known. While a
higher  rail  would  not  have  prevented  Cay  from  jumping  or  a  third
party from throwing Cay over the rail, one could reasonably conclude
that  a  rail  above  Cay’s  center  of  gravity  would  have  prevented  an
accidental fall.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. The “But-For” Test.  The Cay court articulates a simple test for
actual causation and applies it to a case where mystery abounds. In
order to determine if the defendant’s negligence — building the railing
on the bridge four inches too low — caused the decedent’s death, the
court must determine what probably happened on that evening. The

intermediate  court  of  appeals  believed  causation  was  present  if  the
negligence  “might  have”  made  a  difference.  The  Louisiana  Supreme
Court rejects this — because the plaintiff’s burden in a civil case is to
prove  each  element  by  a  “preponderance”  of  the  evidence.  Once  the
court  determines  what  probably  happened — that  the  decedent
stumbled  toward  the  railing  and  fell  over  it — the  application  of  the
“but-for” test is fairly straightforward. Because the railing should have
been  designed  to  exceed  a  typical  adult’s  center  of  gravity,  there  is
persuasive evidence that the low railing was an essential fact that led
to the death.

2. The Number of “But-For” Causes of an Accident.  In Cay, the trial
court found two essential causes: (1) the decedent’s intoxication and
(2)  the  defendant’s  negligence.  In  fact,  when  taken  to  its  logical
extreme  there  are  virtually  an  inﬁnite  number  of  but-for  causes  for
any  event.  In  Cay,  had  the  plaintiff  not  declined  a  ride  from  another
patron  of  the  bar  he  could  not  have  fallen  off  the  bridge.  Had  the
plaintiff’s  sister  not  driven  him  to  the  town  he  would  not  have  fallen
off  the  bridge.  Had  he  not  made  the  decision  to  purchase  a  hunting
license he would not have fallen off the bridge. Had his parents never
been born, he would not have fallen off the bridge. The point of all of
this is that but-for cause is not a search for a lone cause — there  is
no such thing. It is merely an analysis of whether the defendant’s act
or omission of negligence is one of the essential links in the chain of
causation that led to the harm.

3. Problems.
A.  The  appellate  court  in  Cay  references  the  trial  court’s  surmise
that  another  driver  had  probably  done  something  to  spook  the
decedent and cause him to stumble toward the bridge railing. If
that  other  driver  could  be  located  and  plaintiff  could  show  that
he was negligent in how he drove the car, would that other driver
also  be  liable  to  the  plaintiff  for  the  negligent  death  of  the
decedent?

B.  Suppose  a  fancy  resort  permits  its  employees  to  hand  a  key
card  for  a  guest  room  to  anyone  who  requests  it  without  any
identifying  information.  A  man  requests  such  a  card  from  the
front  desk  for  a  particular  room.  The  man  goes  into  the  room
and  assaults  the  occupant  of  the  room.  However,  the  evidence
also  shows  that  the  room’s  occupant  left  the  front  door
unlocked.  Is  the  hotel’s  negligence  in  handing  out  room  keys  a
but-for cause of the guest’s damages?

C.  What  if  the  evidence  in  Cay  showed  that  Keith  Cay,  the
deceased,  was  unusually  tall — over  seven  feet?  Might  this
impact  the  actual  causation  conclusion  that  the  trial  court
made?  What  if  he  was  instead  unusually  short — less  than  ﬁve
feet?

LYONS v. MIDNIGHT SUN TRANSPORTATION
SERVICES
928 P.2d 1202 (Alaska 1996)

          .

Esther  Hunter-Lyons  was  killed  when  her  Volkswagen  van  was
struck  broadside  by  a  truck  driven  by  David  Jette  and  owned  by
Midnight  Sun  Transportation  Services,  Inc.  When  the  accident
occurred,  Jette  was  driving  south  in  the  right-hand  lane  of  Arctic
Boulevard  in  Anchorage.  Hunter-Lyons  pulled  out  of  a  parking  lot  in
front  of  him.  Jette  braked  and  steered  to  the  left,  but  Hunter-Lyons
continued to pull out further into the trafﬁc lane. Jette’s truck collided
with  Hunter-Lyons’s  vehicle.  David  Lyons,  the  deceased’s  husband,
ﬁled  suit,  asserting  that  Jette  had  been  speeding  and  driving
negligently.

At  trial,  conflicting  testimony  was  introduced  regarding  Jette’s
speed before the collision. Lyons’s expert witness testiﬁed that Jette

may  have  been  driving  as  fast  as  53  miles  per  hour.  Midnight  Sun’s
expert  testiﬁed  that  Jette  probably  had  been  driving  signiﬁcantly
slower  and  that  the  collision  could  have  occurred  even  if  Jette  had
been driving at the speed limit, 35 miles per hour. Lyons’s expert later
testiﬁed that if Jette had stayed in his own lane, and had not steered
to the left, there would have been no collision. Midnight Sun’s expert
contended that steering to the left when a vehicle pulls out onto the
roadway  from  the  right  is  a  normal  response  and  is  generally  the
safest course of action to follow.

Over  Lyons’s  objection,  the  jury  was  given  an  instruction  on  the
sudden  emergency  doctrine.  The  jury  found  that  Jette,  in  fact,  had
been  negligent,  but  his  negligence  was  not  a  legal  cause  of  the
accident. [The Alaska Supreme Court decided that it no longer would
approve  of  use  of  the  sudden  emergency  instruction  but  that  it  was
harmless  because  the  jury  found  negligence  in  favor  of  the  plaintiff
anyway.]

Lyons’s  claims  were  defeated  on  the  basis  of  lack  of  causation.
Although  the  jury  found  Jette  to  have  been  negligent,  it  also  found
that  this  negligence  was  not  the  legal  cause  of  the  accident.  Duty,
breach  of  duty,  causation,  and  harm  are  the  separate  and  distinct
elements of a negligence claim, all of which must be proven before a
defendant can be held liable for the plaintiff’s injuries.

Further, we cannot say that the jury’s ﬁnding of lack of causation
was unreasonable. There was evidence presented at trial from which
the  jury  could  reasonably  have  drawn  the  conclusion  that  even
though  Jette  was  driving  negligently,  his  negligence  was  not  the
cause  of  the  accident.  Midnight  Sun  introduced  expert  testimony  to
the  effect  that  the  primary  cause  of  the  accident  was  Ms.  Hunter-
Lyons’s action in pulling out of the parking lot in front of an oncoming
truck.  Terry  Day,  an  accident  reconstruction  specialist  testiﬁed  that,
depending  on  how  fast  Ms.  Hunter-Lyons  was  moving,  the  accident
could have happened even if Jette had been driving within the speed
limit. Midnight Sun also introduced expert testimony to the effect that

Jette  responded  properly  to  the  unexpected  introduction  of  an
automobile  in  his  trafﬁc  lane.  Although  all  of  this  testimony  was
disputed  by  Lyons,  a  reasonable  jury  could  have  concluded  that  Ms.
Hunter-Lyons  caused  the  accident  by  abruptly  pulling  out  in  front  of
an  oncoming  truck,  and  that  David  Jette’s  negligence  was  not  a
contributing  factor.  With  the  element  of  causation  lacking,  even  the
most egregious negligence cannot result in liability.

EAST TEXAS THEATRES, INC. v. RUTLEDGE
453 S.W.2d 466 (Tex. 1970)

     , J.

This is a damage suit alleging personal injuries were sustained by
Sheila  Rutledge,  on  or  about  September  25,  1966,  while  attending  a
midnight  movie  in  a  theatre  owned  and  operated  by  East  Texas
Theatres, Inc. The suit was brought by Sheila, joined by her husband,
against  East  Texas  Theatres,  Inc.  alleging  that  certain  acts  of
negligence on the part of the theatre were a proximate cause of the
injuries Sheila sustained while a patron of the theatre. The jury found
the  defendant  guilty  of  negligence  in  failing  to  remove  certain
unidentiﬁed  “rowdy  persons”  from  the  theatre  and  that  such
negligence was a cause of Sheila’s injuries. Damages were assessed
by the jury at $31,250.00. Based upon the jury ﬁndings, the trial court
entered  judgment  for  the  plaintiffs.  The  Court  of  Civil  Appeals  has
afﬁrmed.  We  reverse  the  judgments  of  both  courts  and  here  render
judgment  that  the  plaintiffs  take  nothing.  [Defendant  contends  on
appeal that the evidence of causation was insufﬁcient to support this
judgment.]

On  September  24  and  the  early  morning  of  September  25,  1966,
Sheila, a paying guest, was attending a special “midnight show” at the
Paramount  Theatre,  one  of  the  several  theatres  owned  by  the
defendant. The interior of the theatre was arranged with a lower floor

and a balcony for the seating of patrons. Sheila and her friends took
seats  on  the  lower  floor  out  beyond  the  overhang  of  the  balcony.
When the picture came to an end, Sheila started making her exit. As
she  proceeded  up  the  aisle  toward  the  front  of  the  building  for  the
purpose of leaving the theatre and just before she walked under the
balcony  overhang,  some  unidentiﬁed  person  in  the  balcony  threw  a
bottle which struck her on the side of her head just above her left ear.

CONDUCT OF THE THEATRE PATRONS

Since the jury found that the patrons in the balcony were acting in a
“rowdy”  manner  and  that  the  defendant  negligently  failed  to  remove
such  rowdy  persons  from  the  premises  and  that  such  negligence
caused  the  injuries  sustained  by  Sheila,  we  deem  it  important  to
particularly  point  out  the  evidence  bearing  on  the  conduct  of  the
patrons  during  the  evening.  The  evidence  favorable  to  the  verdict  is
that during the progress of the show, the patrons in the theatre, both
on  the  lower  floor  and  in  the  balcony,  were  engaged  in  “hollering.”
Sheila, in describing the “hollering,” said that “a few slang words” were
used. This “hollering” was intermittent; it occurred “off and on” during
“parts of” the movie. One witness testiﬁed that “they would holler and
maybe  slack  off  a  few  minutes  and  then  holler  again.”  Buddy
Henderson [a witness] testiﬁed that he saw paper or cold drink cups
either  “drifting  down”  or  being  thrown  down  toward  the  front  of  the
theatre. Sheila did not see throwing of any type. Henderson testiﬁed
that  he  did  not  recall  anything  drifting  down  or  being  thrown  down
other than the paper cold drink cups. In regard to the duration of the
commotion  in  the  theatre,  the  evidence  shows  that  there  was  more
commotion  on  the  lower  floor  than  in  the  balcony.  Henderson
testiﬁed  that  he  thought  that  the  “hollering”  seemed  to  get  worse
toward  the  end  of  the  show.  Sheila  was  certain  that  “[about]  30
minutes before the show was over it seemed to be quieter; they didn’t
seem  to  be  as  rowdy  then.”  Sheila,  Henderson  and  an  ofﬁcer  by  the

name of Burt, all agreed in their testimony that before the show was
over, and, thus, before the accident, all commotion in the theatre had
ceased.  The  last  disturbance  of  any  kind  before  the  show  was  over
was  not  throwing  but  “hollering.”  Henderson  further  testiﬁed  that
nothing happened, whether “hollering” or the throwing of paper cups,
to make him think that something bad was going to happen; he was
not worried about the safety of himself or the safety of his friends or
anybody that was there.

The  balcony,  which  would  seat  263  people,  was  “just  about  full.”
The  witness,  Burt,  estimated  that  about  175  of  the  balcony  seats
were occupied. The disturbance in the balcony seemed to come from
the balcony generally, “just all over it.” The evidence does not identify
any  particular  person  as  being  a  “rowdy  person.”  No  witness  could
state which persons in the balcony were rowdy and which were not.
No  witness  could
identify  the  person  who  threw  the  bottle.
Incidentally,  there  is  no  evidence  that  a  hard  substance  of  any
character was thrown, other than the bottle which struck Sheila. The
witness,  Henderson,  testiﬁed  that  he  could  not  identify  the  person
who threw the bottle, but that out of the corner of his eye, he saw a
“movement,  a  jerking  motion”  by  someone  in  the  balcony  and  then
saw the bottle hit Sheila. No witness testiﬁed that the bottle thrower
had been engaged in “hollering” or throwing paper cups.

Assuming  without  deciding  that  the  ﬁnding  of  negligence  is
supported by evidence of probative force, we go direct to the question
of  whether  there  is  in  the  record  evidence  or  probative  force  to
support  the  ﬁnding  of  cause.  We  hold  that  there  is  no  evidence  to
support  the  ﬁnding  of  the  jury  that  the  failure  of  the  defendant  to
remove  “rowdy  persons”  from  its  premises  was  a  cause  of  Sheila’s
injuries.

[In order to ﬁnd a negligent actor liable for the claimant’s injuries]
there must be cause in fact — a cause which produces an event and
without  which  the  event  would  not  have  occurred.  “An  essential
element of the plaintiff’s cause of action for negligence is that there

be  some  reasonable  connection  between  the  act  or  omission  of  the
defendant and the damage which the plaintiff has suffered.” Prosser,
Law  of  Torts  (3rd  Ed.)  240-41  (1964).  We  base  our  decision  here  on
the ground that the plaintiffs have failed to offer evidence of probative
force  to  establish  the  cause-in-fact  element  of
[causation].  In
particular, the plaintiffs contend that the act of omission in failing to
remove “rowdy persons” from the theatre was a cause of the injuries
resulting from the throwing of the bottle by an unknown patron of the
theatre.  We  recognize  that  cause-in-fact  covers  the  defendant’s
omissions  as  well  as  its  acts.  However,  it  cannot  be  said  from  this
record that had the defendant removed the “rowdy persons” from the
premises,  the  bottle  thrower  would  not  have  thrown  the  bottle.  The
record  in  this  case  clearly  shows  a  complete  lack  of  proof  that  the
bottle  would  not  have  been  thrown  “but  for”  the  failure  of  the
defendant to remove “rowdy persons” from the premises. There is no
evidence  that  the  bottle  thrower  was  one  of  the  “rowdy  persons”
engaged in “hollering” and throwing paper cups from the balcony. We
cannot  say  from  this  evidence  what  persons  would  have  been
removed.

We  recognize  that  the  theatre  was  under  a  duty  to  exercise
reasonable  care  for  the  safety  of  its  patrons.  However,  operators  of
theatres are not insurers of their patrons’ safety.

The judgments of the Court of Civil Appeals and the trial court are

reversed and judgment is here rendered that plaintiffs take nothing.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Connecting the Dots.  In Lyons, there was both evidence that the
defendant was negligent (in driving too fast) and that his veering the
car to the left resulted in the collision. Given this evidence, how could
the  court  uphold  a  jury  ﬁnding  of  negligence  but  no  causation?  The
point  is  that  one  must  ask  whether  the  negligent  act  was  a  but-for

cause of the harm. Just because veering to the left may have been a
cause of the accident, if this defensive maneuver was justiﬁed rather
than  negligent,  its  causal  connection  to  the  accident  is  irrelevant.
Rather, if the lone act of negligence was the speeding, the focus then
shifts  to  whether  the  additional  speed  made  a  difference  in  the
outcome.  In  this  case,  it  appears  the  jury  credited  the  testimony  of
the defendant’s expert witness who said that the collision would have
occurred regardless of whether the defendant was going 35 m.p.h. or
53 m.p.h.

2.  Plaintiff’s  Burden.   In  East  Texas  Theatres,  the  court  also  is
willing  to  concede  possible  negligence  by  the  theatre  operator  in
failing  to  remove  rowdy  audience  members  from  the  balcony.  Given
that the bottle that hit the plaintiff was thrown from the balcony, why
does  the  court  reverse  the  judgment  for  the  plaintiff  and  render
judgment  instead  for  the  defendant  based  upon  causation?  Recall
that the plaintiff must prove but-for causation by a preponderance of
the  evidence.  Did  the  plaintiff  offer  such  evidence  to  support  the
theory that if the defendant had removed the rowdy persons that this
probably  would  have  prevented  the  plaintiff’s  injuries?  What  more
would  the  plaintiff  have  had  to  show  in  this  scenario  to  avoid
summary judgment?

B. Alternatives to But-For Causation

The  but-for  test  for  actual  causation  intuitively  makes  sense  and
issue  of  whether  the  defendant’s  (or  plaintiff’s)
resolves  the
negligence  matters.  That  is,  was  the  misconduct  “negligence  in  the
air,” as Judge Cardozo mentioned in Martin v. Herzog  (i.e.,  lacking  in
causation),  or  did  the  actor’s  misconduct  have  a  logical  connection
with the plaintiff’s harm such that the party’s negligence should make
them responsible? If the but-for test is satisﬁed, a defendant is liable
to  the  plaintiff  for  the  plaintiff’s  resulting  losses.  If  the  test  is  not

involves

related,  situation

satisﬁed, the plaintiff loses. Normally this is the approach taken. But
there  are  certain  recurring  factual  scenarios  where  the  but-for  test
cannot  be  satisﬁed,  yet  permitting  the  tortfeasors  to  escape  liability
would  be  unjust.  In  these  few  exceptional  scenarios,  courts  have
dispensed  with  the  but-for  test  and  utilized  one  of  a  few  other
doctrines to save the plaintiff’s cause of action. One scenario involves
Multiple  Sufficient  Independent  Causes  for  the  plaintiff’s  harm.  A
two  similarly  acting
different,  but
tortfeasors  where  only  one  of  them  could  have  actually  caused  the
harm,  but  plaintiff  has  no  way  to  determine  which  of  the  two  is
responsible.  Alternative  Liability  is  a  theory  that  applies  to  this
instance  and  provides  motivation  for  the  two  tortfeasors  to  help
explain  the  mystery  rather  than  facing  liability.  We  will  see  a  related
doctrine, Modified Alternative Liability (a.k.a. “market share liability”),
applied  in  scenarios  where  alternative  liability  is  inapplicable  but
plaintiffs  are  still  hampered  in  their  efforts  to  prove  causation  when
injured by a fungible product sold by multiple manufacturers. Finally,
in  the  ﬁeld  of  medical  malpractice  and  toxic  torts  we  will  see  some
courts  utilize  a  test  other  than  but-for  causation  where  the
defendant’s  tortious  misconduct  has  either  decreased  a  plaintiff’s
chances  for  cure  or  increased  the  plaintiff’s  chances  for  illness,
though  the  misconduct  probably  did  not  actually  alter  the  outcome.
These two related doctrines — Loss of Chance and Increased Risk of
Harm — often help plaintiffs who seem to have been harmed in some
sense yet cannot prove but-for causation.

1. Multiple Sufﬁcient Independent Causes

Normally a tort victim who has been victimized by the misconduct of
more  than  one  tortfeasor  would  seem  to  be  in  a  relatively  good
position  as  a  strategic  proposition.  Even  if  one  tortfeasor  had
insufﬁcient assets, at least there would be another able to pay. How

could  it  possibly  be  a  bad  thing  to  have  two  tortfeasors  to  go  after?
While this is often true, in some instances it may be that neither one
can be considered a true but-for cause of the harm. Unless there is a
new  doctrine  available  to  help  rescue  the  plaintiff’s  tort  cause  of
action,  this  conceptual  but-for  dilemma  would  leave  a  legitimately
harmed  plaintiff  without  any  means  of  receiving  compensation  and
the tortfeasors would go unpunished. The following is a classic case
involving just such a scenario. Consider the rationale behind the court
recognizing and applying an alternative means of recovery.

KINGSTON v. CHICAGO & NORTHWESTERN
RAILWAY
211 N.W. 913 (Wisc. 1927)

    , J.

The  jury  found  that  both  ﬁres  were  set  by  sparks  emitted  from
locomotives on and over defendant’s right of way. Appellant contends
that there is no evidence to support the ﬁnding that either ﬁre was so
set.  We  have  carefully  examined  the  record  and  have  come  to  the
conclusion  that  the  evidence  does  support  the  ﬁnding  that  the
northeast  ﬁre  was  set  by  sparks  emitted  from  a  locomotive  then
being  run  on  and  over  the  right  of  way  of  defendant’s  main  line.  We
conclude,  however,  that  the  evidence  does  not  support  the  ﬁnding
that  the  northwest  ﬁre  was  set  by  sparks  emitted  from  defendant’s
locomotives or that the defendant had any connection with its origin.
We  therefore  have  this  situation:  The  northeast  ﬁre  was  set  by
sparks  emitted  from  defendant’s  locomotive.  This  ﬁre,  according  to
the  ﬁnding  of  the  jury,  constituted  a  proximate  cause  of  the
destruction  of  plaintiff’s  property.  This  ﬁnding  we  ﬁnd  to  be  well
supported  by  the  evidence.  We  have  the  northwest  ﬁre,  of  unknown
origin. This ﬁre, according to the ﬁnding of the jury, also constituted a

proximate  cause  of  the  destruction  of  the  plaintiff’s  property.  This
ﬁnding we also ﬁnd to be well supported by the evidence. We have a
union  of  these  two  ﬁres  940  feet  north  of  plaintiff’s  property,  from
which  point  the  united  ﬁre  bore  down  upon  and  destroyed  the
property.  We  therefore  have  two  separate,  independent,  and  distinct
agencies, each of which constituted the proximate cause of plaintiff’s
damage, and either of which, in the absence of the other, would have
accomplished such result.

It is settled in the law of negligence that any one of two or more
joint tortfeasors, or one of two or more wrongdoers whose concurring
acts of negligence result in injury, are each individually responsible for
the  entire  damage  resulting  from  their  joint  or  concurrent  acts  of
negligence. This rule also obtains

where two causes, each attributable to the negligence of a responsible person,
concur in producing an injury to another, either of which causes would produce
it regardless of the other, . . . because, whether the concurrence be intentional,
actual, or constructive, each wrongdoer, in effect, adopts the conduct of his co-
actor, and for the further reason that it is impossible to apportion the damage or
to say that either perpetrated any distinct injury that can be separated from the
whole.  The  whole  loss  must  necessarily  be  considered  and  treated  as  an
entirety.

Cook v. M., St. P. & S.S.M.R. Co., 98 Wis. 624 (74 N.W. 561), at p. 642.
That  case  presented  a  situation  very  similar  to  this.  One  ﬁre,
originating by sparks emitted from a locomotive, united with another
ﬁre  of  unknown  origin  and  consumed  plaintiffs’  property.  There  was
nothing  to  indicate  that  the  ﬁre  of  unknown  origin  was  not  set  by
some  human  agency.  The  evidence  in  the  case  merely  failed  to
identify the agency. In that case it was held that the railroad company
which set one ﬁre was not responsible for the damage committed by
the united ﬁres because the origin of the other ﬁre was not identiﬁed.
In  that  case  a  rule  of  law  was  announced  [concerning  the  situation
where one ﬁre is started by another’s negligence but the second ﬁre is
of no known responsible origin. Either ﬁre, had the other not existed,

would  have  reached  the  property  and  caused  the  harm.  Therefore,
plaintiff can have no recovery].

Emphasis  is  placed  upon  the  fact,  especially  in  the  opinion,  that
one ﬁre had “no responsible origin.” At other times in the opinion the
fact is emphasized that it had no “known responsible origin.” The plain
inference  from  the  entire  opinion  is  that  if  both  ﬁres  had  been  of
responsible  origin,  or  of  known  responsible  origin,  each  wrongdoer
would have been liable for the entire damage. The conclusion of the
court  exempting  the  railroad  company  from  liability  seems  to  be
based upon the single fact that one ﬁre had no responsible origin or
no  known  responsible  origin.  It  is  difﬁcult  to  determine  just  what
weight  was  accorded  to  the  fact  that  the  origin  of  the  ﬁre  was
unknown.  If  the  conclusion  of  the  court  was  founded  upon  the
assumption that the ﬁre of unknown origin had no responsible origin,
the  conclusion  announced  may  be  sound  and  in  harmony  with  well
settled principles of negligence.

From  our  present  consideration  of  the  subject  we  are  not
disposed  to  criticize  the  doctrine  which  exempts  from  liability  a
wrongdoer  who  sets  a  ﬁre  which  unites  with  a  ﬁre  originating  from
natural  causes,  such  as  lightning,  not  attributable  to  any  human
agency,  resulting  in  damage.  It  is  also  conceivable  that  a  ﬁre  so  set
might  unite  with  a  ﬁre  of  so  much  greater  proportions,  such  as  a
raging forest ﬁre, as to be enveloped or swallowed up by the greater
holocaust, and its identity destroyed, so that the greater ﬁre could be
said to be an intervening or superseding cause. But we have no such
situation here. These ﬁres were of comparatively equal rank. If there
was  any  difference  in  their  magnitude  or  threatening  aspect,  the
record  indicates  that  the  northeast  ﬁre  was  the  larger  ﬁre  and  was
really  regarded  as  the  menacing  agency.  At  any  rate  there  is  no
intimation  or  suggestion  that  the  northeast  ﬁre  was  enveloped  and
swallowed  up  by  the  northwest  ﬁre.  We  will  err  on  the  side  of  the
defendant if we regard the two ﬁres as of equal rank.

According to well settled principles of negligence, it is undoubted
that if the proof disclosed the origin of the northwest ﬁre, even though
its origin be attributed to a third person, the railroad company, as the
originator of the northeast ﬁre, would be liable for the entire damage.
There is no reason to believe that the  northwest  ﬁre  originated  from
any other than human agency. It was a small ﬁre. It had traveled over
a limited area. It had been in existence but for a day. For a time it was
thought  to  have  been  extinguished.  It  was  not  in  the  nature  of  a
raging forest ﬁre. The record discloses nothing of natural phenomena
which could have given rise to the ﬁre. It is morally certain that it was
set by some human agency.

Now the question is whether the railroad company, which is found
to have been responsible for the origin of the northeast ﬁre, escapes
liability  because  the  origin  of  the  northwest  ﬁre  is  not  identiﬁed,
although  there  is  no  reason  to  believe  that  it  had  any  other  than
human origin. An afﬁrmative answer to that question would certainly
make a wrongdoer a favorite of the law at the expense of an innocent
sufferer.  The  injustice  of  such  a  doctrine  sufﬁciently  impeaches  the
logic upon which it is founded. Where one who has suffered damage
by ﬁre proves the origin of a ﬁre and the course of that ﬁre up to the
point of the destruction of his property, one has certainly established
liability on the part of the originator of the ﬁre. Granting that the union
of  that  ﬁre  with  another  of  natural  origin,  or  with  another  of  much
greater  proportions,  is  available  as  a  defense,  the  burden  is  on  the
defendant  to  show  that  by  reason  of  such  union  with  a  ﬁre  of  such
character  the  ﬁre  set  by  him  was  not  the  proximate  cause  of  the
damage.  No  principle  of  justice  requires  that  the  plaintiff  be  placed
under  the  burden  of  speciﬁcally  identifying  the  origin  of  both  ﬁres  in
order  to  recover  the  damages  for  which  either  or  both  ﬁres  are
responsible.

We  are  not  disposed  to
apply  the  doctrine  of  the  Cook
Case  to  the  instant  situation.

to plead the wrong of the other as a defense to his own wrongdoing

The  fact  that  the  northeast  ﬁre  was  set  by  the  railroad

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Nature  of  But-For  Problem.   The  Kingston  case  deals  with  a
situation in which each of the two causes (i.e., the ﬁres) would easily
be  considered  a  but-for  cause  of  the  plaintiff’s  property  loss  if  the
other  ﬁre  never  existed.  But  because  of  the  two  ﬁres,  each
independent and sufﬁcient to have caused all of the plaintiff’s loss on

its  own,  neither  can  meet  the  test.  If  the  court  were  to  insist  on
traditional  but-for  causation  here  the  plaintiff  could  not  recover
against  either  tortfeasor,  and  both  tortfeasors  would  escape
judgment.  Such  a  result  would  frustrate  both  the  purpose  of
compensation and deterrence. This is a scenario where conceptually
the but-for test seems to fail in achieving justice.

2.  Other  Instances  of  Multiple  Causes.   In  one  sense,  every  tort
case involves the confluence of many but-for causes that result in a
single,  indivisible  injury  to  the  plaintiff.  If  a  criminal  assault  is
permitted  to  occur  to  a  plaintiff  in  her  hotel  room  because  of  the
hotel’s inadequate security, both the criminal and the hotel would be
considered but-for causes of the one loss. The but-for causation test
can  be  satisﬁed  and  the  plaintiff  can  recover  against  either  or  both.
Just  because  multiple  causes  exist  does  not  mean  that  a  but-for
dilemma will be present — we saw this earlier in the Cay v. Louisiana
case.  The  multiple  independent  sufﬁcient  causes  doctrine  is  only
applicable  in  situations  where  each  tortfeasor’s  misconduct,  on  its
own,  would  lead  to  the  same  result  and  thus  neither  is  actually
essential.

3. Natural Causes.  Some courts have held, as the Cook court held,
that  where  the  second,  independently  sufﬁcient  cause  is  a  natural
cause of the plaintiff’s loss, the multiple independent sufﬁcient cause
doctrine  should  not  be  available.  This  is  because  the  chief  concern
cited  in  Kingston — that  the  but-for  test  might  otherwise  allow  two
tortfeasors to both escape liability by pointing to one another — is not
present. Not all courts agree with this and will apply the doctrine even
if the second cause is of natural origins.

4.  An  Alternative  Analysis.   After  recognizing  that  the  search  for
involving  multiple
essential  but-for  causation
independent  sufﬁcient  causes  was  impossible,  courts  eventually
began  asking  instead  whether  the  defendant’s  role  was  at  least  a
substantial factor in leading to the claimant’s harm. We will see this
employed  in  such  an  instance  later  in  this  chapter  in  the  case  of

in  scenarios

Brisboy v. Fibreboard Paper Products Corp. Such alternative analysis
can  be  traced  back  to  the  language  in  Kingston  when  the  court
wondered  about  the  relative  size  of  the  two  ﬁres,  suggesting  that  if
one were far greater than the other it might diminish the smaller ﬁre
being  considered  substantial  enough
liability.  The
Restatement (Third) of Torts now suggests skipping this “substantial
factor” analysis in cases of multiple independent sufﬁcient causes.

to  create

5.  Problem.   A  plaintiff  was  exposed  to  a  toxic  substance,
asbestos,  from  multiple  different  employers  during  a  long  career
working  at  shipyards  where  asbestos  was  used  for  insulation.
Plaintiff  eventually  was  diagnosed  with  a  form  of  cancer  caused  by
asbestos  exposure.  Will  this  plaintiff  face  any  difﬁculty  proving
causation  in  a  suit  against  all  of  the  former  employers?  What
additional  information  would  be  necessary  to  determine  if  the  rule
from Kingston would apply?

2. Alternative Liability

Alternative liability is another doctrine intended to help repair a but-for
causation  problem  in  another  instance  where  the  but-for  test  would
yield  unsavory  results.  Alternative  liability  applies  in  a  multiple
tortfeasor  scenario  where  there  is  a  true  but-for  cause  associated
with the tort but the plaintiff is not in a position to identify, as between
the  tortfeasors,  which  one  is  responsible  for  causing  the  harm.
Summers is the classic case cited for this doctrine. It involves three
hunters  in  the  woods.  Plaintiff  gets  shot  but  cannot  prove  which
hunter  actually  shot  him.  The  two  defendants  both  ﬁred  the  same
type  of  weapon  in  plaintiff’s  direction  at  the  same  moment.  As  you
read this, notice that although the plaintiff suffers two injuries, as to
each injury it is clear that only one of the hunters could have caused
the  harm.  Consider  how  the  nature  of  the  but-for  problem  is  very
different  here  than  in  cases  of  multiple  independently  sufﬁcient

causes,  and  yet  the  principle  motivating  the  doctrine  is  virtually
identical.  The  next  case,  Burke,  involves  a  plaintiff  trying  to  use  a
causation  cure  (alternative  liability),  even  though  the  plaintiff’s  real
problem has more to do with proving breach of duty. For this reason,
the doctrine is unavailing there.

SUMMERS v. TICE
199 P.2d 1 (Cal. 1948)

      , J.

Each  of  the  two  defendants  appeals  from  a  judgment  against
them  in  an  action  for  personal  injuries.  Pursuant  to  stipulation  the
appeals have been consolidated.

Plaintiff’s action was against both defendants for an injury to his
right  eye  and  face  as  the  result  of  being  struck  by  bird  shot
discharged from a shotgun. The case was tried by the court without a
jury and the court found that . . . plaintiff and the two defendants were
hunting quail on the open range. Each of the defendants was armed
with  a  12-gauge  shotgun  loaded  with  shells  containing  7  1/2  size
shot. Prior to going hunting plaintiff discussed the hunting procedure
with  defendants,  indicating  that  they  were  to  exercise  care  when
shooting  and  to  “keep  in  line.”  In  the  course  of  hunting  plaintiff
proceeded  up  a  hill,  thus  placing  the  hunters  at  the  points  of  a
triangle.  The  view  of  defendants  with  reference  to  plaintiff  was
unobstructed  and  they  knew  his  location.  Defendant  Tice  flushed  a
quail  which  rose  in  flight  to  a  10-foot  elevation  and  flew  between
plaintiff and defendants. Both defendants shot at the quail, shooting
in  plaintiff’s  direction.  At  that  time  defendants  were  75  yards  from
plaintiff. One shot struck plaintiff in his eye and another in his upper
lip.  Finally  it  was  found  by  the  court  that  as  the  direct  result  of  the
shooting by defendants the shots struck plaintiff as above mentioned

and  that  defendants  were  negligent  in  so  shooting  and  plaintiff  was
not contributorily negligent.

First, on the subject of negligence, defendant Simonson contends
that  the  evidence  is  insufﬁcient  to  sustain  the  ﬁnding  on  that  score,
but he does not point out wherein it is lacking. There is evidence that
both defendants, at about the same time or one immediately after the
other,  shot  at  a  quail  and  in  so  doing  shot  toward  plaintiff  who  was
uphill  from  them,  and  that  they  knew  his  location.  That  is  sufﬁcient
from which the trial court could conclude that they acted with respect
to plaintiff other than as persons of ordinary prudence. The issue was
one of fact for the trial court.

The  problem  presented  in  this  case  is  whether  the  judgment
against  both  defendants  may  stand.  It  is  argued  by  defendants  that
there is not sufﬁcient evidence to show which defendant was guilty of
the  negligence  which  caused  the  injuries — the  shooting  by  Tice  or
that by Simonson.

[W]e believe it is clear that the court sufﬁciently found on the issue
that  defendants  were  jointly  liable  and  that  thus  the  negligence  of
both was the cause of the injury or to that legal effect. It found that
both defendants were negligent and “That as a direct and proximate
result of the shots ﬁred by defendants, and each of them, a birdshot
pellet  was  caused  to  and  did  lodge  in  plaintiff’s  right  eye  and  that
another  birdshot  pellet  was  caused  to  and  did  lodge  in  plaintiff’s
upper lip.” In so doing the court evidently did not give credence to the
admissions  of  Simonson  to  third  persons  that  he  ﬁred  the  shots,
which it was justiﬁed in doing. It thus determined that the negligence
of  both  defendants  was  the  legal  cause  of  the  injury — or  that  both
were responsible. Implicit in such ﬁnding is the assumption that the
court was unable to ascertain whether the shots were from the gun
of one defendant or the other or one shot from each of them. The one
shot  that  entered  plaintiff’s  eye  was  the  major  factor  in  assessing
damages  and  that  shot  could  not  have  come  from  the  gun  of  both
defendants. It was from one or the other only.

It  has  been  held  that  where  a  group  of  persons  are  on  a  hunting
party,  or  otherwise  engaged  in  the  use  of  ﬁrearms,  and  two  of  them
are negligent in ﬁring in the direction of a third person who is injured
thereby, both of those so ﬁring are liable for the injury suffered by the
third person, although the negligence of only one of them could have
caused the injury. The same rule has been applied in criminal cases,
and both drivers have been held liable for the negligence of one where
they engaged in a racing contest causing an injury to a third person.
These cases speak of the action of defendants as being in concert as
the  ground  of  decision,  yet  it  would  seem  they  are  straining  that
concept  and  the  more  reasonable  basis  appears  in  Oliver  v.  Miles.
There  two  persons  were  hunting  together.  Both  shot  at  some
partridges  and  in  so  doing  shot  across  the  highway  injuring  plaintiff
who was travelling on it. The court stated they were acting in concert
and  thus  both  were
liable.  The  court  then  stated:  “We  think
that . . . each is liable for the resulting injury to the boy, although no
one  can  say  deﬁnitely  who  actually  shot  him.  To  hold  otherwise
would  be  to  exonerate  both  from  liability,  although  each  was
negligent,  and  the  injury  resulted  from  such  negligence.”  Dean
Wigmore has this to say:

When two or more persons by their acts are possibly the sole cause of a harm,
or when two or more acts of the same person are possibly the sole cause, and
the plaintiff has introduced evidence that the one of the two persons, or the one
of the same person’s two acts, is culpable, then the defendant has the burden of
proving that the other person, or his other act, was the sole cause of the harm.
The  real  reason  for  the  rule — that  each  joint  tortfeasor  is  responsible  for  the
whole  damage — is  the  practical  unfairness  of  denying  the  injured  person
redress simply because he cannot prove how much damage each did, when it is
certain  that  between  them  they  did  all;  let  them  be  the  ones  to  apportion  it
among themselves.

(Wigmore, Select Cases on the Law of Torts, §153.)

When  we  consider  the  relative  position  of  the  parties  and  the
results that would flow if plaintiff was required to pin the injury on one

of the defendants only, a requirement that the burden of proof on that
subject  be  shifted  to  defendants  becomes  manifest.  They  are  both
wrongdoers — both  negligent  toward  plaintiff.  They  brought  about  a
situation  where  the  negligence  of  one  of  them  injured  the  plaintiff,
hence it should rest with them each to absolve himself if he can. The
injured party has been placed by defendants in the unfair position of
pointing to which defendant caused the harm. If one can escape the
other may also and plaintiff is remediless. Ordinarily defendants are in
a far better position to offer evidence to determine which one caused
the injury. This reasoning has recently found favor in this court.

In addition to that, however, it should be pointed out that the same
reasons of policy and justice shift the burden to each of defendants
to  absolve  himself  if  he  can — relieving  the  wronged  person  of  the
duty  of  apportioning  the  injury  to  a  particular  defendant,  apply  here
where  we  are  concerned  with  whether  plaintiff  is  required  to  supply
evidence  for  the  apportionment  of  damages.  If  defendants  are
independent tortfeasors and thus each liable for the damage caused
by  him  alone,  and,  at  least,  where  the  matter  of  apportionment  is
incapable  of  proof,  the  innocent  wronged  party  should  not  be
deprived  of  his  right  to  redress.  The  wrongdoers  should  be  left  to
work out between themselves any apportionment.

The judgment is afﬁrmed.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Nature  of  Problem.      In  the  instance  of  multiple  independent
sufﬁcient  causes,  there  is  a  conceptual  impossibility  of  proving  but-
for  causation  since  neither  of  the  tortfeasors’  actions  is  essential.
How  is  the  but-for  problem  different  with  alternative  liability,  as  set
forth in Summers?  In  alternative  liability  scenarios,  is  there  a  but-for
cause? If so, then why do courts not insist upon placing the ordinary
burden of proving this element of the cause of action? Consider that

we know for sure that one of the hunters shot the plaintiff in the eye.
As  to  that  defendant,  but-for  causation  would  be  easy  if  we  could
identify  the  source  of  the  shot  that  hit  the  eye.  But  this  evidentiary
problem,  through  no  fault  of  the  plaintiff,  would  insulate  both
defendants from liability. Absent this doctrine, how could the plaintiff
prove  causation  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence?  As  to  either
defendant, what are the statistical chances that the defendant was in
fact the one who shot the plaintiff? Can you say that either hunter is
probably  responsible?  If  not,  what  becomes  of  the  plaintiff’s  entire
case?

2. Concert  of  Action  Distinguished.   In  Summers,  the  court  briefly
considers  (and  rejects)  an  alternative  way  around  the  causation
problem — utilization of the concert of action doctrine. This is the civil
world’s  corollary  to  criminal  law’s  conspiracy  theory.  We  will  explore
that doctrine further in Chapter 9 Apportionment.

3. Problems.  Are there but-for causation problems in the following
scenarios?  If  so,  what  is  the  nature  of  the  problem?  Is  there  a
doctrinal ﬁx for any of the problems?

A.  Two  boy  scouts  are  chasing  a  third  down  a  hallway  prior  to  a
meeting.  The  two  boys  each  ﬁre  a  paper  clip  (using  a  rubber
band)  toward  the  third  at  the  same  moment.  One  of  them  hits
the  boy  in  the  eye  causing  damage.  The  victim  cannot  identify
which of the two boys actually hit him with the paper clip.

B. There are three hunters in the woods in a triangular pattern with
the plaintiff in the lead. The other two, trying to hit a deer at the
same  time,  ﬁre  their  rifles  toward  the  plaintiff.  Each  of  them
strikes  the  plaintiff  in  the  head  accidentally.  Either  bullet  would
have killed the plaintiff by itself.

C. We have the same three hunters in the woods with two shooting
at a deer. Hunter one misses the plaintiff entirely, but hunter two
hits the plaintiff causing severe injuries.

D. Same three hunters once again in the woods hunting deer. The
ﬁrst and second hunters both miss the deer and accidentally hit

the  plaintiff,  one  in  the  arm  and  the  other  in  the  leg.  The
combined bleeding from both wounds causes the plaintiff to die.

BURKE v. SCHAFFNER
683 N.E.2d 861 (Ohio Ct. App. 1996)

     , J.

On October 4, 1994, Gary Burke and his wife, Tammy Burke, ﬁled a
complaint  in  the  Franklin  County  Court  of  Common  Pleas,  naming
Kerri Schaffner as the lone defendant. The lawsuit arose as a result of
serious  injuries  sustained  by  Gary  Burke  on  October  26,  1993,  when
he was struck by a pickup truck driven by Martin Malone, with whom
the  Burkes  settled  prior  to  commencing  litigation.  The  incident
occurred  during  a  party  held  for  ofﬁcers  of  the  City  of  Columbus
Division of Police, 8th Precinct.

In Practice

Given the evidentiary nature of
the problem in an alternative
liability scenario, the doctrine
provides for an evidentiary
response — it shifts the burden
of proof to the defendants to
negate but-for causation. If one
of the defendants is successful
in doing so, they have in effect
solved the plaintiff’s riddle.

The  case  proceeded  to  a  trial  by  jury  on  March  11,  1996.
Essentially,  plaintiffs’  theory,  based  in  large  part  upon  the  testimony
of Mr. Malone, was that Ms. Schaffner stepped on the accelerator. To
the evident surprise of plaintiffs’ counsel, the defense rested without
calling  any  witnesses,  including  Ms.  Schaffner  herself.  Plaintiffs’

reopen

to

On  March  14,  1996,  the  jury  returned  a  verdict  in  favor  of  Ms.
Schaffner. The jury’s response to an interrogatory submitted with the
verdict  forms  indicated  the  jury’s  express  ﬁnding  that  Ms.  Schaffner
was not negligent.

In  their  ﬁrst  assignment  of  error,  appellants  argue  that  the  trial
court  erred  in  failing  to  grant  their  motion  for  a  directed  verdict.
Speciﬁcally,  appellants  reason  as  follows.  They  “proved”  that  Ms.
Schaffner  was  one  of  only  two  persons  who  could  have  negligently
harmed  Mr.  Burke.  The  only  other  potentially  responsible  person,
Martin Malone, called by appellants as a witness, testiﬁed that he did
not  step  on  the  accelerator.  Thus,  since  Ms.  Schaffner  failed  to

present  any  evidence  to  overcome  her  burden  to  demonstrate  that
she  did  not  cause  the  harm,  appellants  should  have  been  granted  a
directed verdict.

In  addressing  this  speciﬁc  contention,  appellants  necessarily
incorporate issues pertaining to the doctrine of alternative liability, the
subject of their second assignment of error. Thus, we address these
arguments jointly.

Appellants’  argument  relies  heavily  upon  the  testimony  of  Martin
Malone,  who,  as  indicated  above,  unequivocally  denied  stepping  on
the  accelerator.  Appellants  contend  that  the  doctrine  of  alternative
liability mandates a ﬁnding that since Ms. Schaffner did not testify or
otherwise present evidence, she failed to satisfy her burden to prove
that  she  was  not  negligent.  Appellees  counter,  and  the  trial  court  so
held,  that  the  doctrine  of  alternative  liability  is  not  applicable  to  this
case.

The  doctrine  of  alternative  liability  was  adopted  by  a  narrow
majority of the Supreme Court of Ohio in Minnich v. Ashland Oil Co.
(1984), 473 N.E.2d 1199, at the syllabus:

Where the conduct of two or more actors is tortious, and it is proved that harm
has been caused to the plaintiff by only one of them, but there is uncertainty as
to which one has caused it, the burden is upon each such actor to prove that he
has not caused the harm. (2 Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts, Section 433[B]
[3], adopted.) (Emphasis added.)

limiting

In this case, the trial court found alternative liability (and thus, burden-
shifting)  to  be  inappropriate  based  upon  a  narrow  interpretation  of
Minnich,
involving  multiple
defendants,  each  of  whom  acted  tortiously.  The  trial  court  rejected
the  doctrine  based  upon  appellants’  theory  that  only  one  of  two
persons stepped on the accelerator either the named defendant, Kerri
Schaffner, or Martin Malone, the latter of whom denied fault.

its  application

to  cases

Appellants acknowledge the current status of the doctrine in Ohio,
citing  pertinent  case  law;  however,  they  construe  the  case  law  in  a

manner  which  broadens  the  scope  of  the  doctrine  to  include
situations
involving  a  single  negligent  act  committed  by  one
potentially unidentiﬁable person, regardless of that person’s status as
a  party  or  non-party.  The  trial  court  rejected  this  expansion  of  the
doctrine.

We  too  reject  such  a  broad  interpretation.  We  agree  with  the
holding  of  the  trial  court  and  ﬁnd  its  reasoning  to  be  sound.  Plain
language in Minnich lends support to this narrow interpretation:

It should be emphasized that under this alternative liability theory, plaintiff must
still  prove:  (1)  that  two  or  more  defendants  committed  tortious  acts,  and  (2)
that plaintiff was injured as a proximate result of the wrongdoing of one of the
defendants. Only then will the burden shift to the defendants to prove that they
were not the cause of plaintiff’s injuries. This doctrine does not apply in cases
where there is no proof that the conduct of more than one defendant has been
tortious. Id. at 397. (Emphasis added.)

See, also, Goldman v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp. (1987), 33 Ohio St.
3d 40, 514 N.E.2d 691.

The  rationale  for  the  doctrine  of  alternative  liability,  and  the
burden-shifting  exception,  is  not  applicable  in  circumstances  where
only one person has acted tortiously. The Supreme Court of Ohio has
consistently  reiterated  the  rationale  justifying  the  seldom-employed
burden-shifting:

The  reason  for  the  exception  is  the  unfairness  of  permitting  tortfeasors  to
escape liability simply because the nature of their conduct and of the resulting
injury  has  made  it  difﬁcult  or  impossible  to  prove  which  of  them  caused  the
harm.

Huston v. Konieczny, 218, 556 N.E.2d 505 (Oh. 1990).

Ms. Schaffner argues, and the trial court agreed, that the doctrine
further  requires  that  the  multiple  negligent  persons  be  named  as
defendants in the litigation; if all negligent actors are brought before
the  court,  then  the  burden  shifts  to  each  of  them  to  disprove
causation. We agree. In Huston, the court was careful to note:

In order for the burden of proof to shift from the plaintiffs, all tortfeasors should
be before the court, if possible. See Comment h to Section 433b(3) (‘The cases
thus far decided in which the rule stated in Subsection has been applied all have
been cases in which all of the actors involved have been joined as defendants.’);
Sindell  v.  Abbott  Laboratories  (Cal.  1980),  607  P.2d  924,  930-93;  Summers  v.
Tice (Cal. 1948), 199 P.2d 1.

52  Ohio  St.  3d  at  219.  The  Supreme  Court  of  Ohio  has  continued  to
limit the application of alternative liability to “unique situations,” all of
which  have  required  a  plaintiff  to  satisfy  a  threshold  burden  of
proving  that  “all the  defendants  acted  tortiously.”  Horton  v.  Harwick
Chem.  Corp.  (1995),  653  N.E.2d  1196  (Oh.  1995),  citing  Goldman,
supra.

Only  upon  a  plaintiff’s  showing  that  each  of  the  multiple
defendants acted tortiously should the causation burden shift to and
among  the  defendants,  who  have  each  created  a  “substantially
similar  risk  of  harm.”  Horton  at  688.  That  rationale  simply  does  not
apply to these facts, since appellants attempted to prove that a single
tortfeasor,  Ms.  Schaffner,  committed  a  single  tortious  act,  to  the
exclusion  of  the  only  other  potentially  responsible  person — Martin
Malone,  whom  appellants  did  not  sue  and,  in  fact,  attempted  to
exculpate during trial.

law  on  this
issue is scant, research reveals
that  our  holding  is  generally  in
accord  with  those  courts  that
have  addressed  this  particular
question. In Fiorella v. Ashland
Oil, Inc.,  635  N.E.2d  1306  (Oh.
the  Summit  County
1993),
Court  of  Appeals,  construing
Minnich,  supra,  held  that  the
failure to join as defendants all
potentially  responsible  tortfeasors  precluded  the  application  of

alternative  liability.  The  court  cited  cases  from  numerous  other
jurisdictions, applying and adopting the following reasoning:

In Vigiolto v. Johns-Manville Corp. (W.D. Pa. 1986), 643 F. Supp. 1454, 1457, a
federal  district  court  rejected  application  of  the  alternative  liability  theory  in  a
case where all the possible wrongdoers were not before the court, supplying its
reasoning as follows:

The sine qua non of §433B(3) liability [alternative liability] is proof that harm
has been caused to plaintiff by at least one of the multiple [defendants] sued by
the plaintiff. If plaintiff cannot prove who caused his injuries and does not name
as defendants all who possibly could have, plaintiff has not proved that at least
one  of  the  named  defendants  caused  the  harm.  The  plaintiff  must  “name  as
defendants all who could have caused the complained of injury.”

Fiorella at 416.

As  Ms.  Schaffner  was  the  only  defendant  before  the  court,  there
was no other named defendant to whom the burden could or should
have shifted. The trial court properly ruled that alternative liability was
inappropriate under these circumstances and, thus, properly rejected
the  requested  jury  instruction.  Further,  since  alternative  liability  was
not applicable, the defendant had no burden to present evidence that
she did not cause the harm. As a result, the trial court did not err in
overruling appellants’ motion for a directed verdict, since reasonable
minds could differ in concluding who, if anyone, was negligent.

Judgment affirmed.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Prerequisites for Doctrine.  The court in Burke identiﬁes several
fundamental criteria for application of the alternative liability doctrine.
These  include  that  (a)  there  be  more  than  one  tortfeasor,  (b)  all
tortfeasors are engaged in similar conduct, (c) plaintiff was injured as
a result of the actions of one of the tortfeasors, and (d) plaintiff name
all of the tortfeasors to the action. When this doctrine applies, it acts

as  a  burden-shifting  device,  which  presumes  that  all  defendants
caused  the  plaintiff’s  harm  unless  and  until  one  of  them  proves
otherwise. Given these requirements, what was wrong with plaintiff’s
attempt  in  Burke  to  rely  upon  the  doctrine?  Was  the  doctrine
designed to ﬁx the true problem that the plaintiff faced?

2.  Knowing  When  to  Apply  Doctrines.   Ultimately,  the  Burke  case
demonstrates the importance of understanding the theory behind tort
doctrines  to  know  when  they  actually  apply.  Alternative  liability
applies when the plaintiff can prove that the few defendants brought
before  the  court  are  tortfeasors  and  that  either  of  them  could  have
been the actual cause, but that it is impossible to prove which one. In
Burke, plaintiff failed to win because plaintiff could not prove that the
defendant  passenger  had  stepped  on  the  accelerator.  This  is  the
proof  necessary  to  show  that  the  defendant  committed  an  act  of
negligence.  It  was  a  breach  failure  of  proof.  Had  the  plaintiff
demonstrated  that  the  defendant  had  carelessly  stepped  on  the
accelerator,  the  plaintiff  would  not  have  had  any  problems  proving
causation. Viewed this way, the case shows a plaintiff attempting to
ﬁx  a  breach  problem  with  a  causation  cure.  In  a  larger  sense,  the
lesson  here  is  to  know  in  what  context,  and  for  what  reasons,
particular tort doctrines apply. This will be enormously useful to you
not only on your ﬁnal exam but also in the practice of law. Ignorance
as  to  the  rationale  behind  the  alternative  liability  rule,  and  when  it
applies,  may  have  led  the  plaintiff’s  lawyer  in  Burke  to  rest  plaintiff’s
case  without  calling  the  defendant  as  an  adverse  witness,  on  the
assumption that the burden of proof had shifted to the defendant.

3. Problems.
A. Could the plaintiff in Burke have relied upon the doctrine of res

ipsa loquitur to recover against the defendant?

B. What if, in Burke, the plaintiff proved that both the driver and the
defendant passenger had placed their feet on the accelerator at
the  same  time?  How  might  this  impact  the  liability  of  the
defendant?

C.  Could  the  jury  in  Burke  have  properly  found  in  favor  of  the

plaintiff based upon the evidence that was submitted?

3. Modiﬁed Alternative Liability: Market Share

When  a  defective  product  hurts  a  plaintiff,  proving  actual  causation
might not be too complicated. But what if there are multiple unrelated
manufacturers of the same identical product and the plaintiff cannot
tell  whose  product  was  the  source  of  the  injury?  In  these  instances,
alternative liability might be unavailing for various reasons, including
that  the  plaintiff  might  be  unable  to  bring  all  of  the  manufacturers
into  court.  Further,  even  if  the  plaintiff  could  locate  and  serve
complaints on every potential source of the product, is it fair to apply
alternative  liability?  After  all,  when  there  are  only  two  tortfeasing
hunters in the woods, the odds that either is the culprit are relatively
high. When the plaintiff proves that both shot in his direction, there is
a  50/50  chance  as  to  either  defendant  that  they  were  the  actual
cause. Application of a doctrine that makes both fully liable does not
seem  out  of  the  question.  But  when  there  are  hundreds  of
manufacturers  of  a  defective,  fungible  product,  is  the  half  of  one
percent  chance  that  Company  X  is  the  source  of  the  product  that
caused the harm a sufﬁciently fair basis to make them liable for 100
percent  of  the  plaintiff’s  damages?  In  such  instances,  where  a
prevailing doctrine does not quite ﬁt, courts will sometimes create a
new  doctrinal  ﬁx  for  the  problem.  The  Sindell  case  below  is  an
example  of  just  such  a  phenomenon.  Pay  careful  attention  to  why
existing  tort  theories  could  not  help  the  plaintiff  prove  actual
causation  and  how  the  new  doctrine — modified  alternative  liability
(or  market  share  liability) — is  uniquely  shaped  to  seek  justice  that
would otherwise be unavailing.

SINDELL v. ABBOTT LABORATORIES

607 P.2d 924 (Cal. 1980)

    , J.

This case involves a complex problem both timely and signiﬁcant:
may  a  plaintiff,  injured  as  the  result  of  a  drug  administered  to  her
mother  during  pregnancy,  who  knows  the  type  of  drug  involved  but
cannot  identify  the  manufacturer  of  the  precise  product,  hold  liable
for her injuries a maker of a drug produced from an identical formula?
Plaintiff  Judith  Sindell  brought  an  action  against  eleven  drug
companies  and  Does  1  through  100,  on  behalf  of  herself  and  other
women similarly situated.

that

[In  her  complaint,  Sindell  alleged

the  defendants
manufactured,  marketed,  and  sold  a  synthetic  compound  of  the
female  hormone  estrogen  called  “DES”  from  1941  until  1971.  There
were  hundreds  of  manufacturers  who  sold  the  identical  formulation
of  DES  during  this  time  period.  The  FDA  approved  DES  as  a
miscarriage  preventative  but  only  on  an  experimental  basis  with  a
requirement  for  certain  warnings  to  that  effect.  In  1971,  the  FDA
ordered  all  manufacturers  to  discontinue  marketing  and  selling  the
product  for  preventing  miscarriages  and  to  warn  physicians  and  the
public of its ill effects. The FDA had determined that DES caused the
female  offspring  of  mothers  who  ingested  the  drug  to  suffer  certain
forms of cervical and vaginal cancer, often one or two decades after
their  birth.  Plaintiff  named  ten  speciﬁc  manufacturers  and  alleged
that other John Doe companies marketed the DES even though they
knew  or  should  have  known  that  it  was  a  carcinogenic  substance.
She also alleged that they failed to adequately test the drug and failed
to  comply  with  FDA  restrictions  regarding  DES.  Plaintiff  alleges  that
she, and other similarly situated women, were exposed to DES before
their birth, but failed to have any reason to suspect any ill effects from
their exposure until many years later. Plaintiff brought this suit within
one  year  of  discovering  that  her  illness  was  possibly  linked  to  DES

consumption  by  her  mother.  Plaintiff  suffered  a  malignant  bladder
tumor which had to be surgically removed. She now requires regular
medical monitoring for a possible recurrence.]

DES  was  produced  from  a  common  and  mutually  agreed  upon
formula as a fungible drug interchangeable with other brands of the
same  product;  [Plaintiff  alleges]  defendants  knew  or  should  have
known that it was customary for doctors to prescribe the drug by its
generic  rather  than  its  brand  name  and  that  pharmacists  ﬁlled
prescriptions  from  whatever  brand  of  the  drug  happened  to  be  in
stock.

[Defendants obtained dismissal of the plaintiff’s complaint on the
grounds  that  the  plaintiff  could  not  prove  causation  due  to  her
inability to identify which manufacturer provided the DES ingested by
the plaintiff’s mother. Plaintiff appeals from this dismissal.]

This  case  is  but  one  of  a  number  ﬁled  throughout  the  country
seeking  to  hold  drug  manufacturers  liable  for  injuries  allegedly
resulting  from  DES  prescribed  to  the  plaintiffs’  mothers  since  1947.
According  to  a  note  in  the  Fordham  Law  Review,  estimates  of  the
number of women who took the drug during pregnancy range from 1
1/2  million  to  3  million.  Hundreds,  perhaps  thousands,  of  the
daughters  of  these  women  suffer  from  adenocarcinoma,  and  the
incidence of vaginal adenosis among them is 30 to 90 percent. Most
of  the  cases  are  still  pending.  With  two  exceptions,  those  that  have
been  decided  resulted  in  judgments  in  favor  of  the  drug  company
defendants  because  of  the  failure  of  the  plaintiffs  to  identify  the
manufacturer  of  the  DES  prescribed  to  their  mothers.  The  present
action is another attempt to overcome this obstacle to recovery.

We  begin  with  the  proposition  that,  as  a  general  rule,  the
imposition of liability depends upon a showing by the plaintiff that his
or  her  injuries  were  caused  by  the  act  of  the  defendant  or  by  an
instrumentality  under  the  defendant’s  control.  The  rule  applies

whether the injury resulted from an accidental event or from the use
of a defective product.

There  are,  however,  exceptions  to  this  rule.  Plaintiff’s  complaint
suggests several bases upon which defendants may be held liable for
her  injuries  even  though  she  cannot  demonstrate  the  name  of  the
manufacturer which produced the DES actually taken by her mother.
The ﬁrst of these theories, classically illustrated by Summers v. Tice,
places the burden of proof of causation upon tortious defendants in
certain  circumstances.  The  second  basis  of  liability  emerging  from
the  complaint  is  that  defendants  acted  in  concert  to  cause  injury  to
plaintiff.  .  .  .  We  shall  conclude  that  these  doctrines,  as  previously
interpreted,  may  not  be  applied  to  hold  defendants  liable  under  the
allegations of this complaint. However, we shall propose and adopt a
[different]  basis  for  permitting  the  action  to  be  tried,  grounded  upon
an extension of the Summers doctrine.

Plaintiff  places  primary  reliance  upon  cases  which  hold  that  if  a
party  cannot  identify  which  of  two  or  more  defendants  caused  an
injury,  the  burden  of  proof  may  shift  to  the  defendants  to  show  that
they  were  not  responsible  for  the  harm.  This  principle  is  sometimes
referred to as the “alternative liability” theory.

The celebrated case of Summers v. Tice, a unanimous opinion of
this  court,  best  exempliﬁes  the  rule.  In  Summers,  the  plaintiff  was
injured  when  two  hunters  negligently  shot  in  his  direction.  We
reasoned that both were wrongdoers, both were negligent toward the
plaintiff,  and  that  it  would  be  unfair  to  require  plaintiff  to  isolate  the
defendant responsible, because if the one pointed out were to escape
liability,  the  other  might  also,  and  the  plaintiff-victim  would  be  shorn
of any remedy. In these circumstances, we held, the burden of proof
shifted to the defendants, “each to absolve himself if he can.”

Defendants  assert  that  these  principles  are  inapplicable  here.
First, they insist that a predicate to shifting the burden of proof under
Summers  is  that  the  defendants  must  have  greater  access  to

information  regarding  the  cause  of  the  injuries  than  the  plaintiff,
whereas  in  the  present  case  the  reverse  appears.  Plaintiff  does  not
claim that defendants are in a better position than she to identify the
manufacturer  of  the  drug  taken  by  her  mother  or,  indeed,  that  they
have the ability to do so at all, but argues, rather, that Summers does
not  impose  such  a  requirement  as  a  condition  to  the  shifting  of  the
burden  of  proof.  In  this  respect  we  believe  plaintiff  is  correct.  In
Summers,  the  circumstances  of  the  accident  themselves  precluded
an  explanation  of  its  cause.  To  be  sure,  Summers  states  that
defendants are “[ordinarily] . . . in a far better position to offer evidence
to  determine  which  one  caused  the  injury”  than  a  plaintiff,  but  the
decision  does  not  determine  that  this  “ordinary”  situation  was
present.  Neither  the  facts  nor  the  language  of  the  opinion  indicates
that the two defendants were in a better position than the plaintiff to
ascertain  whose  shot  caused
the  opinion
acknowledges,  it  was  impossible  for  the  trial  court  to  determine
whether the shot which entered the plaintiff’s eye came from the gun
of  one  defendant  or  the  other.  Nevertheless,  burden  of  proof  was
shifted to the defendants. Thus we conclude the fact defendants do
not  have  greater  access  to  information  that  might  establish  the
identity  of  the  manufacturer  of  the  DES  which  injured  plaintiff  does
not per se prevent application of the Summers rule.

injury.  As

the

Nevertheless,  plaintiff  may  not  prevail  in  her  claim  that  the
Summers  rationale  should  be  employed  to  ﬁx  the  whole  liability  for
her  injuries  upon  defendants,  at  least  as  those  principles  have
previously been applied. There is an important difference between the
situation  involved  in  Summers  and  the  present  case.  There,  all  the
parties who were or could have been responsible for the harm to the
plaintiff  were  joined  as  defendants.  Here,  by  contrast,  there  are
approximately  200  drug  companies  which  made  DES,  any  of  which
might  have  manufactured  the  injury-producing  drug.  Defendants
maintain that, while in Summers there was a 50 percent chance that
one of the two defendants was responsible for the plaintiff’s injuries,

here  since  any  one  of  200  companies  which  manufactured  DES
might  have  made  the  product  that  harmed  plaintiff,  there  is  no
rational  basis  upon  which  to  infer  that  any  defendant  in  this  action
caused plaintiff’s injuries, nor even a reasonable possibility that they
were responsible.

These  arguments  are  persuasive  if  we  measure  the  chance  that
any  one  of  the  defendants  supplied  the  injury-causing  drug  by  the
number of possible tortfeasors. In such a context, the possibility that
any of the ﬁve defendants supplied the DES to plaintiff’s mother is so
remote that it would be unfair to require each defendant to exonerate
itself.  There  may  be  a  substantial  likelihood  that  none  of  the  ﬁve
defendants  joined  in  the  action  made  the  DES  which  caused  the
injury,  and  that  the  offending  producer  not  named  would  escape
liability altogether. While we propose [below] an adaptation of the rule
in  Summers  which  will  substantially  overcome  these  difﬁculties,
defendants  appear  to  be  correct  that  the  rule,  as  previously  applied,
cannot  relieve  plaintiff  of  the  burden  of  proving  the  identity  of  the
manufacturer which made the drug causing her injuries.

The  second  principle  upon  which  plaintiff  relies  is  the  so-called
“concert  of  action”  theory.  With  respect  to  this  doctrine,  Prosser
states that “those who, in pursuance of a common plan or design to
commit  a  tortious  act,  actively  take  part  in  it,  or  further  it  by
cooperation  or  request,  or  who  lend  aid  or  encouragement  to  the
wrongdoer,  or  ratify  and  adopt  his  acts  done  for  their  beneﬁt,  are
equally  liable  with  him.  Express  agreement  is  not  necessary,  and  all
that is required is that there be a tacit understanding.” Prosser, Law of
Torts  (4th  ed.  1971)  §46,  p.  292.  In  our  view,  [Plaintiff’s]  litany  of
charges  is  insufﬁcient  to  allege  a  cause  of  action  under  the  rules
stated  above.  The  gravamen  of  the  charge  of  concert  is  that
defendants  failed  to  adequately  test  the  drug  or  to  give  sufﬁcient
warning of its dangers and that they relied upon the tests performed
by one another and took advantage of each other’s’ promotional and
marketing  techniques.  These  allegations  do  not  amount  to  a  charge

that  there  was  a  tacit  understanding  or  a  common  plan  among
defendants  to  fail  to  conduct  adequate  tests  or  give  sufﬁcient
warnings,  and  that  they  substantially  aided  and  encouraged  one
another in these omissions.

The complaint charges also that defendants produced DES from a
“common  and  mutually  agreed  upon  formula,”  allowing  pharmacists
to  treat  the  drug  as  a  “fungible  commodity”  and  to  ﬁll  prescriptions
from  whatever  brand  of  DES  they  had  on  hand  at  the  time.  It  is
difﬁcult to understand how these allegations can form the basis of a
cause  of  action  for  wrongful  conduct  by  defendants,  acting  in
concert. The formula for DES is a scientiﬁc constant. It is set forth in
the  United  States  Pharmacopoeia,  and  any  manufacturer  producing
that drug must, with exceptions not relevant here, utilize the formula
set forth in that compendium.

What  the  complaint  appears  to  charge  is  defendants’  parallel  or
imitative  conduct  in  that  they  relied  upon  each  other’s  testing  and
promotion methods. But such conduct describes a common practice
in industry: a producer avails himself of the experience and methods
of  others  making  the  same  or  similar  products.  Application  of  the
concept  of  concert  of  action  to  this  situation  would  expand  the
doctrine far beyond its intended scope and would render virtually any
manufacturer  liable  for  the  defective  products  of  an  entire  industry,
even  if  it  could  be  demonstrated  that  the  product  which  caused  the
injury was not made by the defendant. There is no allegation here that
each  defendant  knew  the  other  defendants’  conduct  was  tortious
toward plaintiff, and that they assisted and encouraged one another
to inadequately test DES and to provide inadequate warnings. Indeed,
it seems dubious whether liability on the concert of action theory can
be predicated upon substantial assistance and encouragement given
by one alleged tortfeasor to another pursuant to a tacit understanding
to fail to perform an act. Thus, there was no concert of action among
defendants within the meaning of that doctrine.

If  we  were  conﬁned  to  the  [theory  of  Summers],  we  would  be
constrained to hold that the judgment must be sustained. Should we
require that plaintiff identify the manufacturer which supplied the DES
used  by  her  mother  or  that  all  DES  manufacturers  be  joined  in  the
action,  she  would  effectively  be  precluded  from  any  recovery.  As
defendants  candidly  admit,  there  is  little  likelihood  that  all  the
manufacturers  who  made  DES  at  the  time  in  question  are  still  in
business  or  that  they  are  subject  to  the  jurisdiction  of  the  California
courts. There are, however, forceful arguments in favor of holding that
plaintiff has a cause of action.

In  our  contemporary  complex  industrialized  society,  advances  in
science  and  technology  create  fungible  goods  which  may  harm
consumers and which cannot be traced to any speciﬁc producer. The
response of the courts can be either to adhere rigidly to prior doctrine,
denying  recovery  to  those  injured  by  such  products,  or  to  fashion
remedies to meet these changing needs.

The most persuasive reason for ﬁnding plaintiff states a cause of
action is that advanced in Summers: as between an innocent plaintiff
and negligent defendants, the latter should bear the cost of the injury.
Here,  as  in  Summers,  plaintiff  is  not  at  fault  in  failing  to  provide
evidence of causation, and although the absence of such evidence is
not attributable to the defendants either, their conduct in marketing a
drug  the  effects  of  which  are  delayed  for  many  years  played  a
signiﬁcant role in creating the unavailability of proof.

Where, as here, all defendants produced a drug from an identical
formula  and  the  manufacturer  of  the  DES  which  caused  plaintiff’s
injuries  cannot  be
identiﬁed  through  no  fault  of  plaintiff,  a
modiﬁcation of the rule of Summers is warranted. As we have seen,
an undiluted Summers rationale is inappropriate to shift the burden of
proof of causation to defendants because if we measure the chance
that any particular manufacturer supplied the injury-causing product
by the number of producers of DES, there is a possibility that none of
the  ﬁve  defendants  in  this  case  produced  the  offending  substance

and  that  the  responsible  manufacturer,  not  named  in  the  action,  will
escape liability.

But  we  approach  the

issue  of  causation  from  a  different
perspective:  we  hold  it  to  be  reasonable  in  the  present  context  to
measure  the  likelihood  that  any  of  the  defendants  supplied  the
product which allegedly injured plaintiff by the percentage which the
DES sold by each of them for the purpose of preventing miscarriage
bears to the entire production of the drug sold by all for that purpose.
Plaintiff asserts in her briefs that Eli Lilly and Company and ﬁve or six
other companies produced 90 percent of the DES marketed. If at trial
this  is  established  to  be  the  fact,  then  there  is  a  corresponding
likelihood  that  this  comparative  handful  of  producers  manufactured
the  DES  which  caused  plaintiff’s  injuries,  and  only  a  10  percent
likelihood that the offending producer would escape liability.

If  plaintiff  joins  in  the  action  the  manufacturers  of  a  substantial
share of the DES which her mother might have taken, the injustice of
shifting  the  burden  of  proof  to  defendants  to  demonstrate  that  they
could  not  have  made  the  substance  which  injured  plaintiff  is
signiﬁcantly  diminished.  While  75  to  80  percent  of  the  market  [has
been  suggested  by  some  proponents  of  this  new  theory  of  liability]
we hold only that a substantial percentage is required.

The  presence

in  the  action  of  a  substantial  share  of  the
appropriate  market  also  provides  a  ready  means  to  apportion
damages  among  the  defendants.  Each  defendant  will  be  held  liable
for  the  proportion  of  the  judgment  represented  by  its  share  of  that
market  unless  it  demonstrates  that  it  could  not  have  made  the
product  which  caused  plaintiff’s  injuries.  In  the  present  case,  as  we
have  seen,  one  DES  manufacturer  was  dismissed  from  the  action
upon ﬁling a declaration that it had not manufactured DES until after
plaintiff  was  born.  Once  plaintiff  has  met  her  burden  of  joining  the
required  defendants,  they  in  turn  may  cross-complain  against  other
DES  manufacturers,  not  joined  in  the  action,  which  they  can  allege
might have supplied the injury-causing product.

Under

this  approach,  each  manufacturer’s

liability  would
approximate  its  responsibility  for  the  injuries  caused  by  its  own
products.  It  is  probably  impossible,  with  the  passage  of  time,  to
determine  market  share  with  mathematical  exactitude.  But  .  .  .  the
difﬁculty of apportioning damages among the defendant producers in
exact  relation  to  their  market  share  does  not  seriously  militate
against the rule we adopt. As we said in Summers with regard to the
liability of independent tortfeasors, where a correct division of liability
cannot be made “the trier of fact may make it the best it can.”

We  are  not  unmindful  of  the  practical  problems  involved  in
deﬁning  the  market  and  determining  market  share,  but  these  are
largely matters of proof which properly cannot be determined at the
pleading  stage  of  these  proceedings.  Defendants  urge  that  it  would
be  both  unfair  and  contrary  to  public  policy  to  hold  them  liable  for
plaintiff’s  injuries  in  the  absence  of  proof  that  one  of  them  supplied
the  drug  responsible  for  the  damage.  Most  of  their  arguments,
however,  are  based  upon  the  assumption  that  one  manufacturer
would be held responsible for the products of another or for those of
all  other  manufacturers  if  plaintiff  ultimately  prevails.  But  under  the
rule  we  adopt,  each  manufacturer’s  liability  for  an  injury  would  be
approximately  equivalent  to  the  damage  caused  by  the  DES  it
manufactured.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Modiﬁcations  to  Alternative  Liability.   What  prerequisites  for
application  of  the  doctrine  of  alternative  liability  were  missing  in
Sindell? The court alludes to several failings. For one thing, not all of
the potential sources of the defective product were before the court.
Remember  that  alternative  liability  operates  to  shift  the  burden  of
proof  to  the  defendants  to  come  forward  with  evidence  negating
causation  as  to  them.  In  the  absence  of  such  proof,  all  tortfeasing

defendants  are  liable.  Alternative  liability’s  operation  does  not  work
without  all  sources  present  in  the  courtroom.  Second,  there  are
simply  too  many  potential  sources  of  the  problem  to  make
application  of  the  doctrine  fair  to  any  one  defendant.  Given  these
shortcomings,  the  California  Supreme  Court  opined  that  the
application of that doctrine to ﬁx the but-for causation problem of the
plaintiffs  would  be  unfair.  Ultimately  the  court  adopts  a  variation  of
alternative  liability,  often  called  market  share  liability.  How  is  this
different from alternative liability, in terms of its prerequisites and its
effects  on  any  defendant’s  liability?  This  can  be  answered  by
reference  to  the  problems  mentioned  above  with  regard  to  applying
alternative  liability.  For  one  thing,  the  court  loosens  the  burden  of
bringing all tortfeasors before the court. If the plaintiff instead brings
before  the  court  defendants  constituting  a  substantial  share  of  the
market  for  the  product,  this  will  be  considered  sufﬁcient.  At  least  in
this  instance  there  is  a  probability  that  the  correct  manufacturer  is
present.  Second,  each  defendant  (that  fails  to  exonerate  itself  as  a
cause)  is  liable  only  for  its  percentage  share  of  the  market  of  the
product.  If  a  defendant  sold  5  percent  of  the  product  in  the  relevant
market  at  the  relevant  period  of  time,  it  would  only  be  liable  for  5
percent of the plaintiff’s compensatory damages.

2.  Statutes  of  Limitations.   Plaintiffs  in  these  DES  cases,  which
were  ﬁled  in  abundance  after  the  FDA’s  actions  in  1971,  typically
faced signiﬁcant hurdles both in terms of proving causation — due to
their  inability  to  identify  the  manufacturer  of  the  pills  taken  by  their
mothers — and  in  terms  of  justifying  the  late  ﬁling  of  their  claims
under applicable statutes of limitations. In some states the legislature
passed new laws expressly granting DES claimants additional time to
pursue their litigation. While many states have now adopted modiﬁed
alternative  liability,  in  appropriate  cases  involving  fungible  goods
where  product  identiﬁcation  is  difﬁcult,  other  states  have  refused  to
do so.

3.  Concert  of  Action.   The  court  also  dispenses  with  plaintiff’s
additional  argument  that  but-for  causation  need  not  be  proven
because all of the manufacturers were acting in unison or in concert
with  one  another.  Had  that  theory  been  applicable  to  the  facts,  the
court would have treated the defendants as one and this would have
mooted  the  product  identiﬁcation  problem.  Unfortunately,  parallel
conduct  does  not  prove  two  manufacturers  are  acting  in  any  joint
fashion.  Concert  of  action  theory  is  dealt  with  later  in  this  book  in
Chapter 9 under the topic of Apportionment.

4. Increased Risk of Future Harm

Another  causation  riddle  occurs  when  the  plaintiff  has  been  either
exposed  to  some  toxic  substance,  or  received  some  inadequate
medical  treatment,  and  this  results  in  the  plaintiff  being  at  risk  for
some future harm. The statute of limitations may compel the plaintiff
to  bring  suit  today  for  a  possible  injury  tomorrow.  Further,  the  civil
procedure doctrine of res judicata demands that in any suit a plaintiff
seek recovery for all past, present, and future damages at once. But
what  if  the  plaintiff  is  less  than  50  percent  likely  to  actually
experience  the  anticipated  future  ill  effects  of  the  exposure  or
treatment? Will the court stick with the traditional demand for proving
causation  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence,  and  only  permit
recovery for likely future effects, or will the court permit the plaintiff to
recover  on  some  other  novel  theory?  The  case  that  follows  shows
one  plaintiff’s  effort  to  suggest  a  pathway  around  this  causation
problem.

TEMPLE-INLAND PRODUCTS CORP. v. CARTER
993 S.W.2d 88 (Tex. 1999)

     , J.

The  sole  issue  in  this  case  is  whether  a  person  who  has  been
exposed to asbestos but does not have an asbestos-related disease
may recover damages for fear of the possibility of developing such a
disease  in  the  future.  The  district  court  granted  summary  judgment
for  the  defendant  on  plaintiff’s  claims  for  actual  and  punitive
damages.  A  divided  court  of  appeals  reversed  only  on  the  actual
damages  claim.  For  reasons  we  explain,  the  district  court  was
correct.

Temple-Inland  Forest  Products  Corporation  employed  Biskamp
Electric to install electric outlets and computer jacks in a laboratory at
one  of  its  paper  mills.  In  performing  the  installation,  two  Biskamp
employees, Martin Reeves Carter Sr. and Larry Wilson, drilled holes in
laboratory  countertops,  which  they  did  not  know  and  were  not  told
contained asbestos. The drilling generated dust containing asbestos
ﬁbers  to  which  Carter  and  Wilson  were  exposed.  They  had  no
protective gear to prevent them from inhaling the dust. Carter worked
on the project from four to six weeks, and Wilson worked on it about
two  weeks.  Not  until  the  work  was  almost  complete  did  the
laboratory manager warn Carter and Wilson of the asbestos, at which
point  they  stopped  work  on  the  project.  Temple-Inland  then  tested
and decontaminated the lab.

Some eighteen months later Carter and Wilson were examined by
Dr. Daniel Jenkins, to whom they had been referred by their attorney.
Although  Dr.  Jenkins  concluded  that  neither  Carter  nor  Wilson  had
any  asbestos-related  disease,  they  sued  Temple-Inland  for  mental
anguish damages caused by its having negligently exposed them to
asbestos ﬁbers.

Dr.  Jenkins  testiﬁed  at  his  deposition  that  Wilson  and  Carter
suffered from no disease as a result of their exposure to asbestos. Dr.
Jenkins, however, insisted that Wilson and Carter had been injured by
their exposure to asbestos and probable inhalation of asbestos ﬁbers

at  the  Temple-Inland  lab.  He  estimated  that  the  chances  of  their
developing a disease as a result had increased from one in a million,
which he estimated to be the risk that a person would ever develop a
disease from asbestos exposure not occupationally related, to about
one in 500,000 for the next ten or ﬁfteen years, and as much as one
in 100 over twenty or thirty years. Dr. Jenkins characterized plaintiffs’
risk as a “high possibility” but not a probability.

Based  on  the  depositions  of  Dr.  Jenkins,  Carter,  Wilson,  and
others,  Temple-Inland  moved  for  summary  judgment  on  the  ground
that  Carter  and  Wilson  had  not  suffered  any  injury  for  which  they
could  recover  mental  anguish  damages.  Temple-Inland  argued  that
plaintiffs’  claims  for  fear  of  the  mere  possibility  of  developing  some
disease  in  the  future  amounted  to  nothing  more  than  negligent
infliction of emotional distress for which they could not recover under
this  Court’s  decision  in  Boyles  v.  Kerr  [p.  356].  Plaintiffs  responded
that  their  inhalation  of  asbestos  ﬁbers  was  a  real,  physical  injury
which could eventually lead to disease, and that they were entitled to
be compensated for their anxiety over that eventuality.

The trial court granted summary judgment. The court of appeals
reversed  the  judgment  on  plaintiffs’  actual  damage  claims.  Relying
principally  on  [on  some  recent  federal  courts’  opinions]  the  court
concluded  that  “it  is  well  established  a  plaintiff  may  recover  for
mental anguish based upon fear of cancer even though the evidence
shows  the  plaintiff  does  not  have,  and  in  reasonable  medical
probability, will not have cancer, so long as there has been exposure
to the causative agent and the fear is reasonable.”

We  granted  Temple-Inland’s  application  for  writ  of  error  and  now
reverse  the  court  of  appeals’  judgment  insofar  as  it  reversed  the
district court’s judgment.

The summary judgment record establishes that Carter and Wilson
were exposed to asbestos at Temple-Inland’s lab but do not presently
suffer from any asbestos-related disease, and that while their risk of

developing  such  a  disease  was  increased  by  their  exposure  to
asbestos, that risk is still no higher than one chance in a hundred over
twenty to thirty years. The issue is whether they can recover for their
fear that they will someday develop such a disease from their work at
Temple-Inland’s lab.

Carter  and  Wilson  ﬁrst  argue  that  they  are  entitled  to  recover
mental anguish damages even if they sustained no physical injury, as
long  as  their  fear  of  developing  some  asbestos-related  disease  is
reasonable.  This  argument  conflicts  with  our  decision  in  Boyles  v.
Kerr,  where  we  held  that  “there  is  no  general  duty  not  to  negligently
inflict  emotional  distress.”  As  we  later  explained  in  City  of  Tyler  v.
Likes, “it has been established for over a century that ‘[a] person who
is  placed  in  peril  by  the  negligence  of  another,  but  who  escapes
without injury, may not recover damages simply because he has been
placed in a perilous position.’”

Carter  and  Wilson  argue  that  they  have  been  physically  injured
because  of  their  exposure  to  asbestos  ﬁbers.  Carter’s  and  Wilson’s
testimony, as well as that of Dr. Jenkins, supports the inference that
they  inhaled  asbestos  ﬁbers  in  the  lab,  and  Temple-Inland  has  not
refuted  this  inference.  The  question  comes  to  this:  given  that
plaintiffs  inhaled  asbestos  ﬁbers,  can  they  recover  mental  anguish
damages  for  their  increased  risk  and  reasonable  fear  of  possibly
developing asbestos-related diseases that they do not currently have
and may never have?

While  the  existence  of  physical  injury  is  ordinarily  necessary  for
recovery  of  mental  anguish  damages  .  .  .  ,  such  injury  may  not  be
sufficient  for  recovery  of  mental  anguish  damages  when  the  injury
has  not  produced  disease,  despite  a  reasonable  fear  that  such
disease will develop. . . . [L]ike the Supreme Court and courts in most
other  jurisdictions,  we  cannot  permit  recovery  of  mental  anguish
damages  in  cases  like  this  one.  In  almost  all  instances  involving
personal  injury,  the  law  allows  for  the  recovery  of  accompanying
mental  anguish  damages,  even  if  the  mental  anguish  is  not  itself

resulting

physically  manifested.  But  if  bodily  injury  is  at  most  latent  and  any
eventual  consequences  uncertain,  as  when  a  person’s  exposure  to
asbestos  has  not  produced  disease,  then  the  case  for  recovery  of
mental  anguish  damages  is  much  weaker.  A  person  exposed  to
asbestos can certainly develop serious health problems, but he or she
also may not. The difﬁculty in predicting whether exposure will cause
any  disease  and  if  so,  what  disease,  and  the  long  latency  period
characteristic  of  asbestos-related  diseases,  make  it  very  difﬁcult  for
judges and juries to evaluate which exposure claims are serious and
which are not. This difﬁculty in turn makes liability unpredictable, with
recovery  while  virtually
in  signiﬁcant
some  claims
indistinguishable  claims  are  denied  altogether.  Some  claimants
would inevitably be overcompensated when, in the course of time, it
happens that they never develop the disease they feared, and others
would be undercompensated when it turns out that they developed a
disease more serious even than they feared. Also, claims for exposure
could  proliferate  because  in  our  society,  as  the  Supreme  Court
observed,
“contacts,  even  extensive  contacts,  with  serious

subjected  to  toxic  substances  in  the  air  they  breathe  and  the  food
they eat. Suits for mental anguish damages caused by exposure that
has  not  resulted  in  disease  would  compete  with  suits  for  manifest
diseases  for  the  legal  system’s  limited  resources.  If  recovery  were
allowed  in  the  absence  of  present  disease,  individuals  might  feel
obliged  to  bring  suit  for  such  recovery  prophylactically,  against  the
possibility of future consequences from what is now an inchoate risk.
This  would  exacerbate  not  only  the  multiplicity  of  suits  but  the
unpredictability of results.

The  question  is  not,  of  course,  whether  Carter  and  Wilson  have
themselves  suffered  genuine  distress  over  their  own  exposure.  We
assume they have, and that their anxiety is reasonable. The question,
rather, is whether this type of claim — for fear of an increased risk of
developing an asbestos-related disease when no disease is presently

manifest — should be permitted, regardless of any individual plaintiff’s
circumstances,  when  the  effort  in  determining  the  genuineness  of
each  claim  and  assuring  appropriate  recovery  is  beset  with  the
difﬁculties  we  have  described.  We  conclude  that  no  such  action
should be recognized.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Increased Risk as a But-For Problem.  The plaintiffs alleged that
their exposure to asbestos placed them at an increased risk of future
illness  even  though  they  had  no  present  condition.
medical
Considering the normal burden of proof in a civil case — proving each
element  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence — how  does  this  case
demonstrate  a  but-for  causation  problem?  Note  that  this  problem
does  not  exist  with  regard  to  all  cases  of  future  harms.  When  a
motorist’s leg is mutilated in a car accident, it may be very likely that
she will suffer future pain and suffering the rest of her life. So long as
the  future  damages  are  likely  (more  than  50%  chance)  to  occur,  she
can recover those damages in her trial. The plaintiffs in the foregoing
case  could  not  prove  the  likelihood  of  such  future  injury.  How  does
their  redeﬁning  the  injury — from  cancer  to  the  fear  of  cancer —
attempt to circumvent the normal proof of causation? The majority of
other courts to address the unlikely prospect of future harm similarly
reject such claims. For example, in Potter v. Firestone Tire & Rubber
Co.,  863  P.2d  795  (Cal.  1993),  the  plaintiffs  complained  of  the
defendant  dumping  toxic  industrial  waste  nearby  and  increasing  the
plaintiffs’  risk  of  cancer.  Because  the  plaintiffs  could  not  prove  that
they  probably  would  suffer  such  harm  from  the  exposure,  the
California Supreme Court rejected their claims:

We cannot say that it would never be reasonable for a person who
has  ingested  toxic  substances  to  harbor  a  genuine  and  serious
fear  of  cancer  where  reliable  medical  or  scientiﬁc  opinion

indicates that such ingestion has signiﬁcantly increased his or her
risk  of  cancer,  but  not  to  a  probable  likelihood.  Nonetheless,  we
conclude, for . . . public policy reasons . . . that emotional distress
caused  by  the  fear  of  a  cancer  that  is  not  probable  should
generally not be compensable in a negligence action. 863 P.2d at
811.

2.  Alternative  No-Duty  Rationale.   In  Temple-Inland,  the  court
holds the plaintiffs to the normal rules of proving but-for causation by
a preponderance of the evidence. This is the same requirement that
would  be  applied  to  any  future  damages — lost  future  wages  arising
from  a  present  injury,  for  example.  With  regard  to  the  plaintiffs’
attempt to evade this causation rule by re-casting the damage as one
for  fear,  rather  than  for  cancer,  the  court  also  cites  another  legal
proposition — that there is no legal duty to exercise care in preventing
others  from  experiencing  emotional  distress.  This  no-duty  rule  is
covered  in  Chapter  6,  Special  Duty  Rules  when  we  revisit  the  duty
element of a negligence claim.

3.  Minority  Rule.   Departing  from  the  majority  of  courts,  which
refuse  to  recognize  recovery  for  a  future  medical  problem  that  is
unlikely to occur, a minority of courts will recognize a right to recover.
The amount of recovery in such instances is calculated by taking the
total  amount  of  damages,  if  they  were  to  occur,  and  multiplying  this
dollar amount by the present percentage chance of ever experiencing
such  harm.  In  Temple-Inland,  the  Texas  Supreme  Court  suggests
that  this  alternative  will  always  result  in  either  overcompensating
plaintiffs  or  undercompensating  plaintiffs,  but  will  never  achieve  the
right level of justice. How is this true?

4.  Problem.   A  plaintiff  underwent  surgery  that  was  not  done
correctly.  As  a  consequence  of  this  malpractice,  the  plaintiff  had  to
undergo  a  second  surgical  procedure  to  attempt  to  correct  the  ﬁrst
mistake.  Plaintiff  learned  that,  as  a  result  of  having  to  undergo  the
second procedure, he was placed at risk of an 8 to 16 percent chance

of  having  a  bowel  obstruction  in  the  future.  To  what  extent  can  this
plaintiff  demonstrate  but-for  causation  of  any  harm  under  the
traditional proof requirements? See Petriello v. Kalman, 576 A. 2d 474
(Conn. 1990).

5. Loss of Chance

In  a  related  circumstance  unique  to  medical  malpractice  claims,
courts have been even more sympathetic with the plight of plaintiffs
who  have  suffered  harm  and  accused  the  medical  doctor  of
wrongfully  denying  them  a  chance  for  a  cure.  The  loss  of  chance
doctrine  is  applied  by  a  majority  of  courts  to  permit  a  medical
malpractice  plaintiff  to  recover  against  a  doctor  who  has  failed  to
make a timely diagnosis or to treat an existing physical condition. The
causation problem arises in cases where even the timely treatment of
the condition would likely not change the bad outcome. For example,
if a deadly cancer can only be cured 5 percent of the time, even with
proper  diagnosis  and  care,  has  the  plaintiff  been  injured  when  the
doctor’s  negligence  deprives  the  plaintiff  of  the  attempted  cure?  In
the  following  case,  the  court  adopts  the  majority  rule  of  loss  of
chance  to  help  provide  some  recovery  in  this  instance.  As  you  read
this, consider why the majority of courts are more sympathetic with
the plaintiff’s plight in this scenario than in the related circumstance
in the preceding section.

LORD v. LOVETT
770 A.2d 1103 (N.H. 2001)

      , J.

The  plaintiff,  Belinda  Joyce  Lord,  appeals  the  Superior  Court’s
dismissal  of  her  “loss  of  opportunity”  action  against  the  defendants,

James  Lovett,  M.D.,  and  Samuel  Aldridge,  M.D.  We  reverse  and
remand.

The plaintiff suffered a broken neck in an automobile accident on
July 22, 1996, and was treated at the Lakes Region General Hospital
by  the  defendants.  She  contends  that  because  the  defendants
negligently  misdiagnosed  her  spinal  cord  injury,  they  failed  both  to
immobilize  her  properly  and  to  administer  steroid  therapy,  causing
her  to  lose  the  opportunity  for  a  substantially  better  recovery.  She
alleges  that  she  continues  to  suffer  signiﬁcant  residual  paralysis,
weakness and sensitivity.

Upon learning that the defendants intended to move to dismiss at
the close of the plaintiff’s case, the trial court permitted the plaintiff to
make  a  pre-trial  offer  of  proof.  She  proffered  that  her  expert  would
testify that the defendants’ negligence deprived her of the opportunity
for  a  substantially  better  recovery.  She  conceded,  however,  that  her
expert could not quantify the degree to which she was deprived of a
better recovery by their negligence.

Following  the  plaintiff’s  offer  of  proof,  the  defendants  moved  to
dismiss on two grounds: (1) New Hampshire law does not recognize
the loss of opportunity theory of recovery; and (2) the plaintiff failed
to set forth sufﬁcient evidence of causation. The trial court dismissed
the  plaintiff’s  action  on  the  basis  that  her  case  is  “clearly  predicated
on loss of . . . opportunity” and that “there’s no such theory permitted
in this State.” This appeal followed.

The  loss  of  opportunity  doctrine,  in  its  many  forms,  is  a  medical
malpractice  form  of  recovery  which  allows  a  plaintiff,  whose
preexisting injury or illness is aggravated by the alleged negligence of
a physician or health care worker, to recover for her lost opportunity
to  obtain  a  better  degree  of  recovery.  Generally,  courts  have  taken
three approaches to loss of opportunity claims.

The  ﬁrst  approach,  the  traditional  tort  approach,  is  followed  by  a
minority of courts. According to this approach, a plaintiff must prove

that  as  a  result  of  the  defendant’s  negligence,  the  plaintiff  was
deprived  of  at  least  a  ﬁfty-one  percent  chance  of  a  more  favorable
outcome  than  she  actually  received.  Once  the  plaintiff  meets  this
burden, she may recover damages for the entire preexisting illness or
condition.

injury

Under  this  approach,  a  patient  whose

is  negligently
misdiagnosed, but who would have had only a ﬁfty percent chance of
full  recovery  from  her  condition  with  proper  diagnosis,  could  not
recover damages because she would be unable to prove that, absent
the  physician’s  negligence,  her  chance  of  a  better  recovery  was  at
least  ﬁfty-one  percent.  If,  however,  the  patient  could  establish  the
necessary causal link by establishing that absent the negligence she
would  have  had  at  least  a  ﬁfty-one  percent  chance  of  a  better
outcome,  not  only  would  the  patient  be  entitled  to  recover,  but  she
would  be  awarded  damages  for  her  entire  injury.  This  approach  has
been criticized as yielding an “all or nothing” result.

The  second  approach,  a  variation  of  the  traditional  approach,
relaxes
the  standard  of  proof  of  causation.  The  causation
requirement is relaxed by permitting plaintiffs to submit their cases to
the jury upon demonstrating that a defendant’s negligence more likely
than  not  “increased  the  harm”  to  the  plaintiff  or  “destroyed  a
substantial possibility” of achieving a more favorable outcome.

Under  this  approach,  the  patient  would  not  be  precluded  from
recovering simply because her chance of a better recovery was less
than ﬁfty-one percent, so long as she could prove that the defendant’s
negligence  increased  her  harm  to  some  degree.  The  precise  degree
required  varies  by
jurisdiction.  Some  courts  require  that  the
defendant’s  negligence  increase  the  plaintiff’s  harm  by  any  degree,
while other courts require that the increase be substantial. As in the
traditional  approach,  once  the  plaintiff  meets  her  burden,  she
recovers  damages  for  the  entire  underlying  preexisting  condition  or
illness  rather  than  simply  the  loss  of  opportunity.  This  approach
“represents  the  worst  of  both  worlds  [because  it]  continues  the

arbitrariness  of  the  all-or-nothing  rule,  but  by  relaxing  the  proof
requirements, it increases the likelihood that a plaintiff will be able to
jury  to  award  full  damages.”  King,  “Reduction  of
convince  a
Likelihood” Reformulation, 28 U. Mem. L. Rev. 491 (1998).

Under  the  third  approach,  the  lost  opportunity  for  a  better
outcome  is,  itself,  the  injury  for  which  the  negligently  injured  person
may  recover.  As  with  the  second  approach,  a  plaintiff  may  prevail
even  if  her  chances  of  a  better  recovery  are  less  than  ﬁfty-one
percent.  The  plaintiff,  however,  does  not  receive  damages  for  the
entire injury, but just for the lost opportunity.

In  other  words,  if  the  plaintiff  can  establish  the  causal  link
between  the  defendant’s  negligence  and  the  lost  opportunity,  the
plaintiff may recover that portion of damages actually attributable to
the defendant’s negligence.

Under  this  approach,  “by  deﬁning  the  injury  as  the  loss  of
chance  .  .  .  ,  the  traditional  rule  of  preponderance  is  fully  satisﬁed.”
Perez v. Las Vegas Medical Center, 805 P.2d 589, 592 (Nev. 1991).

We agree with the majority of courts rejecting the traditional “all-
or-nothing” approach to loss of opportunity cases, and ﬁnd the third
approach  most  sound.  See Delaney,  873  P.2d  at  184-86;  Perez,  805
P.2d at 591-93. The third approach permits plaintiffs to recover for the
loss of an opportunity for a better outcome, an interest that we agree
should  be  compensable,  while  providing  for  the  proper  valuation  of
such an interest.

The  loss  of  a  chance  of  achieving  a  favorable  outcome  or  of  avoiding  an
adverse  consequence  should  be  compensable  and  should  be  valued
appropriately,  rather  than  treated  as  an  all-or-nothing  proposition.  Preexisting
conditions  must,  of  course,  be  taken  into  account  in  valuing  the  interest
destroyed. When those preexisting conditions have not absolutely preordained
an adverse outcome, however, the chance of avoiding it should be appropriately
compensated even if that chance is not better than even.

King,  Causation,  Valuation,  and  Chance  in  Personal  Injury  Torts
Involving Preexisting Conditions and Future Consequences,  90  Yale
L.J. 1353, 1354 (1981).

Accordingly,  we  hold  that  a  plaintiff  may  recover  for  a  loss  of
opportunity injury in medical malpractice cases when the defendant’s
alleged  negligence  aggravates  the  plaintiff’s  preexisting  injury  such
that it deprives the plaintiff of a substantially better outcome.

We disagree [with defendant] that the loss of opportunity doctrine
is inconsistent with [the legal requirement of proving each element by
a preponderance of the evidence]. By recognizing loss of opportunity
as a cognizable injury, we refute the notion that the plaintiff would be
unable to prove that the defendants’ negligence “probably” caused her
to suffer “injuries which would not otherwise have occurred.” The right
we recognize today still requires a plaintiff to prove that the injury she
suffered — the  lost  opportunity  for  a  better  outcome — was  caused,
more probably than not, by the defendant’s negligence.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Loss of Chance of Recovery as a But-For Problem.  Defendant in
Lord  argues  that  plaintiff  cannot  recover  because  plaintiff  simply
cannot  prove  but-for  causation  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence.
The court acknowledges that under traditional tort principles, plaintiff
could  not  recover  because  plaintiff  likely  would  have  not  recovered
from
treatment.
Nevertheless,  the  court  fashions  a  new  theory  permitting  recovery.
How  does  the  court  rationalize  this  new  theory  with  the  normal
burden of proof requirements?

the  underlying  condition  even  with  proper

2.  Damage  Calculation.   The  court  does  not  specify  exactly  how
damages should be quantiﬁed under this new theory of recovery but
concedes that the plaintiff should not receive compensation for 100
percent of the injury because plaintiff would have likely had the same

result  regardless  of  the  defendant’s  mistreatment.  In  other  cases,
courts  recognizing  this  theory  of  recovery  typically  provide  that  the
jury should calculate the total damages for the injury and multiply it
by a percentage reflecting the diminution in the chances for recovery.
3. Increased  Risk  of  Harm  vs.  Loss  of  Chance.   To  a  large  extent,
the  increased  risk  of  harm  scenario  (reflected  by  Carter)  simply
reflects the other side of the coin from the loss of chance scenario in
Lord. The former involves a scenario where the plaintiff was likely not
hurt by the defendant’s misconduct and likely will never be. The latter
involves  a  scenario  where  the  plaintiff  was  likely  not  adversely
affected  by  the  defendant’s  negligence,  although  the  plaintiff  does
have  a  present  injury  or  condition  (that  predates  the  defendant’s
negligence). The traditional rules are still embraced by the majority of
courts in the increased risk of harm scenario but rejected by courts in
the  loss  of  chance  scenario.  Can  you  explain  why?  Consider  how
sympathetic  each  plaintiff  is  as  they  enter  the  courtroom.  With  the
loss  of  chance  scenario,  the  plaintiff  has  suffered  the  harm.  With
increased  risk  of  harm,  the  plaintiff  approaches  the  court  having
suffered  no  harm  and,  in  all  likelihood,  not  ever  going  to  suffer  the
harm.

III  PROXIMATE CAUSE

In  many  instances  proving  the  actual  causal  link  between  the
defendant’s misconduct and the plaintiff’s harm seems to satisfy tort
law’s sense of fairness and justice. When an inattentive driver cruises
past a stop sign into an intersection striking the plaintiff, there can be
little doubt about his liability to the wounded plaintiff. But what if the
driver was inattentive because he was tired, having been kept awake
late  at  night  by  a  neighbor  hosting  a  loud  party  past  midnight  in
violation  of  a  noise-reduction  ordinance?  Perhaps  the  defendant
driver has no liability insurance and few assets to cover the plaintiff’s
losses.  If  the  plaintiff  decides  to  sue  the  noisy  neighbor,  the  plaintiff
might  be  able  to  prove  that  the  neighbor’s  careless  partying  was  an
actual,  but-for  cause  of  the  accident.  Or  what  if  the  driver  was
speeding  through  the  intersection  because  he  was  late  for  an
appointment, having overslept that morning when his defective alarm
clock failed to wake him? If the defect was due to negligent design or
manufacturing, can the wounded plaintiff sue the clock manufacturer
because  its  carelessness  was  an  additional,  actual,  but-for  cause  of
the  accident?  For  quite  some  time,  tort  law  has  recognized  that  it
needs another check on liability in order to prevent what it perceives
as unfair results when the defendant’s negligence is too remote from
the  plaintiff’s  harm  or  when  the  accident  that  occurred  is  so
surprising  and  unexpected.  When  fairness  demands  that  the
defendant  prevail,  despite  the  plaintiff’s  proof  of  breach  of  duty  and
actual  causation,  the  only  element  available  is  tort  law’s  concept  of
proximate causation.

Some  courts  have  referred  to  proximate  causation  as  the
“ultimate  issue”  in  a  negligence  case.  While  perhaps  hyperbole,  it  is
unquestionably  a  complex  potential  issue  in  many  cases  involving
accidental harm, particularly where there are multiple remote actors.

As  you  may  recall,  courts  have  fairly  consistently  refuted  any
suggestion that proximate cause plays a role in intentional tort cases.
For  example,  we  saw  courts  reject  defendants’  attempts  to  invoke
proximate cause as a check on liability in the trespass case of Baker
v. Shymkiv and in the battery case of Nelson v. Carroll  in  Chapter  2.
In  both  cases  of  surprisingly  bad  harm,  the  courts  found  that  the
defendants  satisﬁed  the  elements  for  the  respective  intentional  tort
and that proximate cause provided no check on liability.

Yet in cases of accidental harm, courts are more concerned with
imposing liability on a mere careless defendant who did not intend to
invade anyone’s legal interests or to cause harm of any type. In such
cases,  courts  have  labored  to  articulate  a  framework  suitable  to  the
task  of  separating  out  cases  where  liability  is  fairly  imposed,  from
instances  where  it  seems  unfair  to  make  the  careless  actor  pay  for
the  resulting  unexpected  harm.  How  to  articulate  a  test  that
ultimately  is  measured  by  a  vague  notion  of  “fairness”  is  something
for  which  courts  have  failed  to  ﬁnd  a  uniform  answer — so  we  will
delve into three different tests courts have used for proximate cause.
But  ﬁrst  we  will  begin  with  the  seminal  decision  in  Palsgraf v. Long
Island  Railway  where  the
judges  publicly  debated  what  was
ultimately  the  question  of  who  should  decide  this  question  of
fairness — the  judge  by  ruling  upon  the  issue  under  the  element  of
“duty,” or the jury by resolving the fairness debate under the banner of
“proximate cause”?

A. Introduction

Palsgraf is one of those few tort cases that any astute lawyer or law
student will instantly recall and about which will often have a strong
opinion.  The  defendant  railroad’s  employees  carelessly  jostled  a
passenger  in  an  ill-advised  attempt  to  help  him  squeeze  onto  a
crowded train. But that passenger was not injured. Rather, the injury

judgment  was  entered

liable  for  negligence  and

occurred seconds later across the train station to another passenger
hurt  by  the  ripples  of  the  defendant’s  action.  The  jury  found  the
in
defendant
accordance  with  the  verdict.  The  majority  opinion  sets  aside  this
judgment.  Set  forth  below  are  the  majority  opinion  authored  by  the
famous Judge Cardozo and the dissenting opinion of Judge Andrews.
Pay close attention to the judges’ debate about (a) the macro issue of
whether the issue of liability for a surprising result should be resolved
as  one  of  duty  or  proximate  causation,  and  (b)  the  micro  issue  of
whether  the  harm  that  occurred  on  the  train  station  was  too
surprising  from  the  standpoint  of  the  defendant  to  fairly  create
liability.

PALSGRAF v. LONG ISLAND RAILWAY CO.
162 N.E. 99 (N.Y. 1928)

       , J.

Plaintiff  was  standing  on  a  platform  of  defendant’s  railroad  after
buying  a  ticket  to  go  to  Rockaway  Beach.  A  train  stopped  at  the
station,  bound  for  another  place.  Two  men  ran  forward  to  catch  it.
One  of  the  men  reached  the  platform  of  the  car  without  mishap,
though  the  train  was  already  moving.  The  other  man,  carrying  a
package, jumped aboard the car, but seemed unsteady as if about to
fall. A guard on the car, who had held the door open, reached forward
to  help  him  in,  and  another  guard  on  the  platform  pushed  him  from
behind. In this act, the package was dislodged, and fell upon the rails.
It  was  a  package  of  small  size,  about  ﬁfteen  inches  long,  and  was
covered by a newspaper. In fact, it contained ﬁreworks, but there was
nothing in its appearance to give notice of its contents. The ﬁreworks
when  they  fell  exploded.  The  shock  of  the  explosion  threw  down
some  scales  at  the  other  end  of  the  platform,  many  feet  away.  The
scales struck the plaintiff, causing injuries for which she sues.

The conduct of the defendant’s guard, if a wrong in its relation to
the  holder  of  the  package,  was  not  a  wrong  in  its  relation  to  the
plaintiff, standing far away. Relatively to her it was not negligence at
all. Nothing in the situation gave notice that the falling package had in
it  the  potency  of  peril  to  persons  thus  removed.  Negligence  is  not
actionable  unless  it  involves  the  invasion  of  a  legally  protected
interest,  the  violation  of  a  right.  “Proof  of  negligence  in  the  air,  so  to
speak,  will  not  do”  Martin v. Herzog,  228  N.Y.  164,  170.  If  no  hazard
was  apparent  to  the  eye  of  ordinary  vigilance,  an  act  innocent  and
harmless, at least to outward seeming, with reference to her, did not
take to itself the quality of a tort because it happened to be a wrong,
though apparently not one involving the risk of bodily insecurity, with
reference to someone else. “In every instance, before negligence can
be  predicated  of  a  given  act,  back  of  the  act  must  be  sought  and
found  a  duty  to  the  individual  complaining,  the  observance  of  which
would  have  averted  or  avoided  the  injury”  W.  Va.  Central  R.  Co.  v.
State, 96 Md. 652, 666. The plaintiff sues in her own right for a wrong
personal  to  her,  and  not  as  the  vicarious  beneﬁciary  of  a  breach  of
duty to another.

A different conclusion will involve us, and swiftly too, in a maze of
contradictions. A guard stumbles over a package which has been left
upon a platform. It seems to be a bundle of newspapers. It turns out
to be a can of dynamite. To the eye of ordinary vigilance, the bundle is
abandoned waste, which may be kicked or trod on with impunity. Is a
passenger  at  the  other  end  of  the  platform  protected  by  the  law
against the unsuspected hazard concealed beneath the waste? If not,

is  the  result  to  be  any  different,  so  far  as  the  distant  passenger  is
concerned, when the guard stumbles over a valise which a truckman
or  a  porter  has  left  upon  the  walk?  The  passenger  far  away,  if  the
victim  of  a  wrong  at  all,  has  a  cause  of  action,  not  derivative,  but
original and primary. His claim to be protected against invasion of his
bodily security is neither greater nor less because the act resulting in
the invasion is a wrong to another far removed. In this case, the rights
that  are  said  to  have  been  violated,  the  interests  said  to  have  been
invaded, are not even of the same order. The man was not injured in
his person nor even put in danger. The purpose of the act, as well as
its effect, was to make his person safe. If there was a wrong to him at
all,  which  may  very  well  be  doubted,  it  was  a  wrong  to  a  property
interest only, the safety of his package. Out of this wrong to property,
which threatened injury to nothing else, there has passed, we are told,
to  the  plaintiff  by  derivation  or  succession  a  right  of  action  for  the
invasion  of  an  interest  of  another  order,  the  right  to  bodily  security.
The diversity of interests emphasizes the futility of the effort to build
the  plaintiff’s  right  upon  the  basis  of  a  wrong  to  someone  else.  The
gain is one of emphasis, for a like result would follow if the interests
were the same. Even then, the orbit of the danger as disclosed to the
eye  of  reasonable  vigilance  would  be  the  orbit  of  the  duty.  One  who
jostles one’s neighbor in a crowd does not invade the rights of others
standing  at  the  outer  fringe  when  the  unintended  contact  casts  a
bomb  upon  the  ground.  The  wrongdoer  as  to  them  is  the  man  who
carries  the  bomb,  not  the  one  who  explodes  it  without  suspicion  of
the  danger.  Life  will  have  to  be  made  over,  and  human  nature
transformed, before prevision so extravagant can be accepted as the
norm  of  conduct,  the  customary  standard  to  which  behavior  must
conform.

The argument for the plaintiff is built upon the shifting meanings
of such words as “wrong” and “wrongful,” and shares their instability.
What the plaintiff must show is “a wrong” to herself, i.e., a violation of
her own right, and not merely a wrong to someone else, nor conduct

“wrongful” because unsocial, but not “a wrong” to anyone. We are told
that one who drives at a reckless speed through a crowded city street
is  guilty  of  a  negligent  act  and,  therefore,  of  a  wrongful  one
irrespective  of  the  consequences.  Negligent  the  act  is,  and  wrongful
in the sense that it is unsocial, but wrongful and unsocial in relation to
other travelers, only because the eye of vigilance perceives the risk of
damage.  If  the  same  act  were  to  be  committed  on  a  speedway  or  a
race course, it would lose its wrongful quality. The risk reasonably to
be perceived deﬁnes the duty to be obeyed, and risk imports relation;
it is risk to another or to others within the range of apprehension. This
does not mean, of course, that one who launches a destructive force
is  always  relieved  of  liability  if  the  force,  though  known  to  be
destructive,  pursues  an  unexpected  path.  Some  acts,  such  as
shooting,  are  so  imminently  dangerous  to  anyone  who  may  come
within  reach  of  the  missile,  however  unexpectedly,  as  to  impose  a
duty of prevision not far from that of an insurer. Even today, and much
oftener in earlier stages of the law, one acts sometimes at one’s peril.
(Under  this  head,  it  may  be,  fall  certain  cases  of  what  is  known  as
transferred  intent,  an  act  willfully  dangerous  to  A  resulting  by
misadventure  in  injury  to  B.  These  cases  aside,  wrong  is  deﬁned  in
terms of the natural or probable, at least when unintentional Parrot v.
Wells-Fargo Co. [the “Nitro-Glycerine Case”], 15 Wall. [U.S.] 524.) The
range of reasonable apprehension is at times a question for the court,
and at times, if varying inferences are possible, a question for the jury.
Here, by concession, there was nothing in the situation to suggest to
the most cautious mind that the parcel wrapped in newspaper would
spread wreckage through the station. If the guard had thrown it down
knowingly  and  willfully,  he  would  not  have  threatened  the  plaintiff’s
safety, so far as appearances could warn him. His conduct would not
have  involved,  even  then,  an  unreasonable  probability  of  invasion  of
her  bodily  security.  Liability  can  be  no  greater  where  the  act  is
inadvertent.

Negligence,  like  risk,  is  thus  a  term  of  relation.  Negligence  in  the
abstract, apart from things related, is surely not a tort, if indeed it is
understandable at all. Negligence is not a tort unless it results in the
commission of a wrong, and the commission of a wrong imports the
violation of a right, in this case, we are told, the right to be protected
against interference with one’s bodily security. . . . The victim does not
sue  derivatively,  or  by  right  of  subrogation,  to  vindicate  an  interest
invaded in the person of another. Thus, to view his cause of action is
to ignore the fundamental difference between tort and crime. He sues
for breach of a duty owing to himself.

The law of causation, remote or proximate, is thus foreign to the
case  before  us.  The  question  of  liability  is  always  anterior  to  the
question of the measure of the consequences that go with liability. If
there is no tort to be redressed, there is no occasion to consider what
damage might be recovered if there were a ﬁnding of a tort. We may
assume,  without  deciding,  that  negligence,  not  at  large  or  in  the
abstract,  but  in  relation  to  the  plaintiff,  would  entail  liability  for  any
and all consequences, however novel or extraordinary. There is room
for  argument  that  a  distinction  is  to  be  drawn  according  to  the
diversity of interests invaded by the act, as where conduct negligent
in that it threatens an insigniﬁcant invasion of an interest in property
results  in  an  unforeseeable  invasion  of  an  interest  of  another  order,
as,  e.  g.,  one  of  bodily  security.  Perhaps  other  distinctions  may  be
necessary. We do not go into the question now. The consequences to
be followed must ﬁrst be rooted in a wrong.

The judgment of the Appellate Division and that of the Trial Term
should  be  reversed,  and  the  complaint  dismissed,  with  costs  in  all
courts.

DISSENT

Judge William S. Andrews

Assisting  a  passenger  to  board  a  train,  the  defendant’s  servant
negligently  knocked  a  package  from  his  arms.  It  fell  between  the
platform  and  the  cars.  Of  its  contents  the  servant  knew  and  could
know  nothing.  A  violent  explosion  followed.  The  concussion  broke
some  scales  standing  a  considerable  distance  away.  In  falling  they
injured the plaintiff, an intending passenger.

Upon these facts may she recover the damages she has suffered
in  an  action  brought  against  the  master?  The  result  we  shall  reach
depends upon our theory as to the nature of negligence. Is it a relative
concept — the breach of some duty owing to a particular person or to
particular  persons?  Or  where  there  is  an  act  which  unreasonably
threatens  the  safety  of  others,  is  the  doer  liable  for  all  its  proximate
consequences,  even  where  they  result  in  injury  to  one  who  would
generally be thought to be outside the radius of danger? This is not a
mere  dispute  as  to  words.  We  might  not  believe  that  to  the  average
mind the dropping of the bundle would seem to involve the probability
of harm to the plaintiff standing many feet away whatever might be

the case as to the owner or to one so near as to be likely to be struck
by  its  fall.  If,  however,  we  adopt  the  second  hypothesis  we  have  to
inquire  only  as  to  the  relation  between  cause  and  effect.  We  deal  in
terms of proximate cause, not of negligence.

Negligence  may  be  deﬁned  roughly  as  an  act  or  omission  which
unreasonably  does  or  may  affect  the  rights  of  others,  or  which
unreasonably fails to protect oneself from the dangers resulting from
such acts. Here I conﬁne myself to the ﬁrst branch of the deﬁnition.
Nor do I comment on the word “unreasonable.” For present purposes
it sufﬁciently describes that average of conduct that society requires
of its members.

But we are told that “there is no negligence unless there is in the
particular  case  a  legal  duty  to  take  care,  and  this  duty  must  be  one
which  is  owed  to  the  plaintiff  himself  and  not  merely  to  others.”
Salmond  Torts  [6th  ed.],  24.  This,  I  think  too  narrow  a  conception.
Where  there  is  the  unreasonable  act,  and  some  right  that  may  be
affected, there is negligence whether damage does or does not result.
That  is  immaterial.  Should  we  drive  down  Broadway  at  a  reckless
speed, we are negligent whether we strike an approaching car or miss
it by an inch. The act itself is wrongful. It is a wrong not only to those
who  happen  to  be  within  the  radius  of  danger  but  to  all  who  might
have been there — a wrong to the public at large. Such is the language
of the street. . . . As was said by Mr. Justice Holmes many years ago,
“the measure of the defendant’s duty in determining whether a wrong
has  been  committed  is  one  thing,  the  measure  of  liability  when  a
wrong has been committed is another.” Spade v. Lynn & Boston R.R.
Co., 172 Mass. 488. Due care is a duty imposed on each one of us to
protect  society  from  unnecessary  danger,  not  to  protect  A,  B  or  C
alone.

It  may  well  be  that  there  is  no  such  thing  as  negligence  in  the
abstract. “Proof of negligence in the air, so to speak, will not do.” In an
empty world negligence would not exist. It does involve a relationship
between man and his fellows. But not merely a relationship between

man  and  those  whom  he  might  reasonably  expect  his  act  would
injure. Rather, a relationship between him and those whom he does in
fact injure. If his act has a tendency to harm some one, it harms him
a mile away as surely as it does those on the scene. We now permit
children to recover for the negligent killing of the father. It was never
prevented on the theory that no duty was owing to them. A husband
may  be  compensated  for  the  loss  of  his  wife’s  services.  To  say  that
the wrongdoer was negligent as to the husband as well as to the wife
is merely an attempt to ﬁt facts to theory.

In the well-known Polemis Case, 3 K.B. 560 (1921), Scrutton said
that  the  dropping  of  a  plank  was  negligent  for  it  might  injure
“workman or cargo or ship.” Because of either possibility the owner of
the vessel was to be made good for his loss. The act being wrongful
the doer was liable for its proximate results. Criticized and explained
as this statement may have been, I think it states the law as it should
be and as it is.

The  proposition  is  this.  Everyone  owes  to  the  world  at  large  the
duty  of  refraining  from  those  acts  that  may  unreasonably  threaten
the  safety  of  others.  Such  an  act  occurs.  Not  only  is  he  wronged  to
whom harm might reasonably be expected to result, but he also who
is  in  fact  injured,  even  if  he  be  outside  what  would  generally  be
thought  the  danger  zone.  There  needs  be  duty  due  the  one
complaining  but  this  is  not  a  duty  to  a  particular  individual  because
as  to  him  harm  might  be  expected.  Harm  to  someone  being  the
natural result of the act, not only that one alone, but all those in fact
injured  may  complain.  We  have  never,  I  think,  held  otherwise.
Unreasonable risk being taken, its consequences are not conﬁned to
those who might probably be hurt.

If  this  be  so,  we  do  not  have  a  plaintiff  suing  by  “derivation  or
succession.”  Her  action  is  original  and  primary.  Her  claim  is  for  a
breach of duty to herself — not that she is subrogated to any right of
action  of  the  owner  of  the  parcel  or  of  a  passenger  standing  at  the
scene of the explosion.

The  right  to  recover  damages  rests  on  additional  considerations.
The plaintiff’s rights must be injured, and this injury must be caused
by  the  negligence.  We  build  a  dam,  but  are  negligent  as  to  its
foundations.  Breaking,  it  injures  property  downstream.  We  are  not
liable  if  all  this  happened  because  of  some  reason  other  than  the
insecure foundation. But when injuries do result from our unlawful act
we  are  liable  for  the  consequences.  It  does  not  matter  that  they  are
unusual, unexpected, unforeseen and unforeseeable. But there is one
limitation.  The  damages  must  be  so  connected  with  the  negligence
that the latter may be said to be the proximate cause of the former.

These  two  words  have  never  been  given  an  inclusive  deﬁnition.
What is a cause in a legal sense, still more what is a proximate cause,
depend  in  each  case  upon  many  considerations,  as  does  the
existence of negligence itself. Any philosophical doctrine of causation
does  not  help  us.  A  boy  throws  a  stone  into  a  pond.  The  ripples
spread. The water level rises. The history of that pond is altered to all
eternity.  It  will  be  altered  by  other  causes  also.  Yet  it  will  be  forever
the resultant of all causes combined. Each one will have an influence.
How great only omniscience can say. You may speak of a chain, or if
you please, a net. An analogy is of little aid. Each cause brings about
future events. Without each the future would not be the same. Each is
proximate in the sense it is essential. But that is not what we mean by
the word. Nor on the other hand do we mean sole cause. There is no
such thing.

Should  analogy  be  thought  helpful,  however,  I  prefer  that  of  a
stream. The spring, starting on its journey, is joined by tributary after
tributary.  The  river,  reaching  the  ocean,  comes  from  a  hundred
sources.  No  man  may  say  whence  any  drop  of  water  is  derived.  Yet
for  a  time  distinction  may  be  possible.  Into  the  clear  creek,  brown
swamp  water  flows  from  the  left.  Later,  from  the  right  comes  water
stained  by  its  clay  bed.  The  three  may  remain  for  a  space,  sharply
divided.  But  at  last,  inevitably  no  trace  of  separation  remains.  They
are so commingled that all distinction is lost.

As we have said, we cannot trace the effect of an act to the end, if
end  there  is.  Again,  however,  we  may  trace  it  part  of  the  way.  A
murder  at  Serajevo  may  be  the  necessary  antecedent  to  an
assassination  in  London  twenty  years  hence.  An  overturned  lantern
may burn all Chicago. We may follow the ﬁre from the shed to the last
building.  We  rightly  say  the  ﬁre  started  by  the  lantern  caused  its
destruction.

A  cause,  but  not  the  proximate  cause.  What  we  do  mean  by  the
word “proximate” is, that because of convenience, of public policy, of a
rough sense of justice, the law arbitrarily declines to trace a series of
events beyond a certain point. This is not logic. It is practical politics.
Take our rule as to ﬁres. Sparks from my burning haystack set on ﬁre
my house and my neighbor’s. I may recover from a negligent railroad.
He  may  not.  Yet  the  wrongful  act  as  directly  harmed  the  one  as  the
other.  We  may  regret  that  the  line  was  drawn  just  where  it  was,  but
drawn  somewhere  it  had  to  be.  We  said  the  act  of  the  railroad  was
not  the  proximate  cause  of  our  neighbor’s  ﬁre.  Cause  it  surely  was.
The  words  we  used  were  simply  indicative  of  our  notions  of  public
policy.  Other  courts  think  differently.  But  somewhere  they  reach  the
point where they cannot say the stream comes from any one source.
It is all a question of expediency. There are no ﬁxed rules to govern
our  judgment.  There  are  simply  matters  of  which  we  may  take
account. We have in a somewhat different connection spoken of “the
stream of events.” We have asked whether that stream was deflected
— whether  it  was  forced  into  new  and  unexpected  channels.  This  is
rather rhetoric than law. There is in truth little to guide us other than
common sense.

There  are  some  hints  that  may  help  us.  The  proximate  cause,
involved as it may be with many other causes, must be, at the least,
something  without  which  the  event  would  not  happen.  The  court
must ask itself whether there was a natural and continuous sequence
between  cause  and  effect.  Was  the  one  a  substantial  factor  in
producing  the  other?  Was  there  a  direct  connection  between  them,

without too many intervening causes? Is the effect of cause on result
not  too  attenuated?  Is  the  cause  likely,  in  the  usual  judgment  of
mankind,  to  produce  the  result?  Or  by  the  exercise  of  prudent
foresight could the result be foreseen? Is the result too remote from
the  cause,  and  here  we  consider  remoteness  in  time  and  space?
Clearly,  we  must  so  consider,  for  the  greater  the  distance  either  in
time or space, the more surely do other causes intervene to affect the
result.  When  a  lantern  is  overturned  the  ﬁring  of  a  shed  is  a  fairly
direct  consequence.  Many  things  contribute  to  the  spread  of  the
conflagration — the  force  of  the  wind,  the  direction  and  width  of
streets,  the  character  of  intervening  structures,  other  factors.  We
draw an uncertain and wavering line, but draw it we must as best we
can.

Once again, it is all a question of fair judgment, always keeping in
mind the fact that we endeavor to make a rule in each case that will
be  practical  and  in  keeping  with  the  general  understanding  of
mankind.

This last suggestion is the factor which must determine the case
before  us.  The  act  upon  which  defendant’s  liability  rests  is  knocking
an  apparently  harmless  package  onto  the  platform.  The  act  was
negligent.  For  its  proximate  consequences  the  defendant  is  liable.  If
its  contents  were  broken,  to  the  owner;  if  it  fell  upon  and  crushed  a
passenger’s  foot,  then  to  him.  If  it  exploded  and  injured  one  in  the
immediate vicinity, to him also as to A in the illustration. Mrs. Palsgraf
was standing some distance away. How far cannot be told from the
record — apparently twenty-ﬁve or thirty feet. Perhaps less. Except for
the  explosion,  she  would  not  have  been  injured.  We  are  told  by  the
appellant in his brief “it cannot be denied that the explosion was the
direct cause of the plaintiff’s injuries.” So it was a substantial factor in
producing  the  result — there  was  here  a  natural  and  continuous
sequence — direct  connection.  The  only  intervening  cause  was  that
instead  of  blowing  her  to  the  ground  the  concussion  smashed  the
weighing  machine  which  in  turn  fell  upon  her.  There  was  no

remoteness  in  time,  little  in  space.  And  surely,  given  such  an
explosion  as  here  it  needed  no  great  foresight  to  predict  that  the
natural  result  would  be  to  injure  one  on  the  platform  at  no  greater
distance from its scene than was the plaintiff. Just how no one might
be  able  to  predict.  Whether  by  flying  fragments,  by  broken  glass,  by
wreckage  of  machines  or  structures  no  one  could  say.  But  injury  in
some form was most probable.

Under  these  circumstances  I  cannot  say  as  a  matter  of  law  that
the plaintiff’s injuries were not the proximate result of the negligence.
That  is  all  we  have  before  us.  The  court  refused  to  so  charge.  No
request was made to submit the matter to the jury as a question of
fact, even would that have been proper upon the record before us.
The judgment appealed from should be afﬁrmed, with costs.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Dealing with Bizarre Consequences.  Palsgraf is the classic torts
case  in  which  two  esteemed  judges  have  a  war  of  words  regarding
how  tort  law  should  deal  with  determining  the  scope  of  liability  for
unusual accidents. With respect to the elements of a negligence case,
where does Judge Cardozo believe the unusual nature of the accident
should primarily be analyzed? How does Judge Andrews disagree? Is
this just a game of semantics or some philosophical debate suitable
for a law school lecture? Does the issue of who should decide liability
in  cases  of  surprising  outcomes  make  any  difference?  The  answer
may ultimately lie in where we place our trust for this question to be
answered.  Questions  of  duty  are  classically  viewed  as  questions  of
law  for  the  court  to  determine,  while  questions  of  proximate  cause
are  generally  considered  questions  of  fact  for  the  jury  to  answer.
Whether  you  ﬁnd  yourself  agreeing  with  Cardozo  or  Andrews  may
reflect  upon  who  you  believe  should  be  answering  the  question  of
how far removed liability should be extended.

to  question  whether

2.  Theory  of  Negligence.   In  his  majority  opinion,  Judge  Cardozo
seemed
railway  had  even  acted
unreasonably (“If there was a wrong to him at all, which may very well
be  doubted”)  given  that  arguably  the  railway  was  trying  to  help  the
man  leaping  onto  the  train  to  avoid  a  fall.  The  intermediate  court  of
appeals,  which  afﬁrmed  the  judgment  for  Mrs.  Palsgraf,  had  this  to
say about the railway’s conduct:

the

Instead  of  aiding  or  assisting  the  passenger  engaged  in  such  an
act,  they  might  better  have  discouraged  and  warned  him  not  to
board  the  moving  train.  It  is  quite  probable  that  without  their
assistance  the  passenger  might  have  succeeded  in  boarding  the
train,  and  no  accident  would  have  happened,  or  without  the
assistance  of  these  employees  the  passenger  might  have
desisted in his efforts to board the train.

Even the dissenting judge at the intermediate court of appeals agreed
that  the  railway  had  acted  unreasonably:  “[T]he  door  of  the  train
should  have  been  closed  before  the  train  started,  which  would  have
prevented the passenger making the attempt.”

3. Torts at a Crossroads.   Judge  Cardozo  decided  to  question  the
assumption that we owe a duty of reasonable care at all times to all
people.  Many  courts  in  negligence  cases  do  revisit  this  assumption
under certain circumstances while ignoring the issue of duty in most
negligence  cases.  In  Chapter  6,  Special  Duty  Rules,  we  will  return  to
the  issue  of  duty  by  visiting  these  recurring  instances  of  courts
pausing  at  the  element  of  “duty”  and  divining  whether  a  duty  of
reasonable care exists or should be modiﬁed. But ﬁrst, because most
courts in practice routinely presume a duty of reasonable care (as we
shall see in Chapter 6, Special Duty Rules) and instead handle issues
of unusual accidents under the analytical framework of “proximate” or
“legal”  causation,  we  will  turn  to  that  topic  in  the  next  subsection  of

this  chapter.  Judge  Andrews’  dissent  introduced  to  us  several
examples of proximate cause analysis.

4. And the Winner Is?  With respect to the issue of duty, once you
have covered Chapter 6, Special Duty Rules, turn back to the facts of
Palsgraf  and  ask  yourself  if  Judge  Cardozo  reached  the  right
conclusion  on  the  issue  of  whether  the  defendant  owed  plaintiff  a
duty  of  care.  In  terms  of  their  practice,  most  courts  today  would
agree  with  Judge  Andrews  on  the  macro  issue  of  whether  Palsgraf
was  a  proximate  cause  or  a  duty  case.  As  you  will  see  in  the  next
chapter,  courts  generally  assume  a  duty  of  care  in  circumstances
where  a  defendant  acts.  Further,  due  to  defendant’s  afﬁrmative
conduct, the status of plaintiff as a business invitee, and defendant’s
status  as  a  common  carrier,  it  is  doubtful  any  court  today  would
bother to debate whether a duty of care existed toward Ms. Palsgraf.
Yet  many  courts  might  disagree  with  Judge  Andrews’  micro
conclusion  that  proximate  cause  existed  on  the  facts  of  that  case,
depending  upon  the  speciﬁc  proximate  cause  test  selected.  As  we
explore  the  actual  proximate  cause  tests  in  the  next  section,  you
should  come  back  to  the  facts  of  Palsgraf  and  Judge  Andrews’
opinion, and ask yourself if he got the actual results of that case right.
5.  Problem.   With  regard  to  the  leaping  passenger  holding  the
ﬁreworks rolled up inside the newspaper, how would Judge Cardozo
and  Judge  Andrews  each  have  analyzed  his  liability  toward  Ms.
Palsgraf?  Would  he  have  owed  her  a  duty  of  care  and  would
proximate cause be satisﬁed as to him?

B. The Direct Cause Test

One of the older, blunter analytical tools for determining the issue of
proximate  cause  is  referred  to  as  the  direct  cause  test.  Judge
Andrews,  in  discussing  possible  tests  for  proximate  cause,  asked  if
there  was  “a  direct  connection  between  [the  negligent  act  and  the

harm],  without  too  many  intervening  causes?”  The  following  two
cases, one older and one of more recent origin, apply this direct cause
test  to  two  very  different  fact  patterns  and  reach  different
conclusions. As you read these cases, consider whether you see any
beneﬁts to the direct cause test.

IN RE POLEMIS
3 K.B. 560 (Ct. App. 1921)

[The  claimants  were  owners  of  a  ship  that  was  lost  in  a  ﬁre.
Included  among  the  items  in  the  ship’s  cargo  were  benzene  and
petrol. While in port at Casablanca in July 1917, stevedores employed
by  the  defendant  (who  had  chartered  the  ship)  were  removing
portions  of  the  cargo.  They  had  placed  wooden  planks  across  the
ship’s  hold  to  assist  them  during  the  unloading  of  the  ship.  The
stevedores  used  slings  to  move  the  cargo  up  from  the  ship’s  hold.
Petrol  vapors  were  in  the  air  within  the  ship’s  cargo  hold  due  to
leaking of benzene and petrol.] In the course of heaving a sling of the
cases from the hold, the rope by which the sling was being raised or
the  sling  itself  came  into  contact  with  the  boards  placed  across  the
forward  end  of  the  hatch,  causing  one  of  the  boards  to  fall  into  the
lower  hold,  and  the  fall  was  instantaneously  followed  by  a  rush  of
flames  from  the  lower  hold,  and  this  resulted  eventually  in  the  total
destruction of the ship.

[The  ship’s  owner  alleged  that  the  charterers  were  liable  for  the
negligence of the stevedores that caused the ﬁre and the ship’s loss.
The  charterers  took  issue  with  these  allegations,  saying  that  there
was  no  negligence  for  which  they  were  responsible  and  that  the
damage  to  the  ship  was  too  remote  to  create  liability — that  no
“reasonable man would have foreseen danger and/or damage of this
kind resulting from the fall of the board.”

The  arbitrators  found  that  the  stevedores  were  negligent  in
causing  the  planks  to  fall  into  the  ship’s  cargo  hold  and  that  this
negligence  created  a  spark  which  ignited  the  petrol  vapors  and
resulted  in  the  total  loss  of  the  ship.  The  arbitrators  also  found,
however,  that  such  loss  could  not  reasonably  have  been  foreseen,
even  though  some  other  damage  to  cargo  or  the  ship  was
foreseeable.  An  award  against  the  charterers  was  levied  and  an
appeal taken.]

      , L.J.

In  the  present  case  the  arbitrators  have  found  as  a  fact  that  the
falling  of  the  plank  was  due  to  the  negligence  of  the  defendants’
servants. The ﬁre appears to me to have been directly caused by the
falling  of  the  plank.  Under  these  circumstances  I  consider  that  it  is
immaterial  that  the  causing  of  the  spark  by  the  falling  of  the  plank
could not have been reasonably anticipated. . . . Given the breach of
duty  which  constitutes  the  negligence,  and  given  the  damages  as  a
direct result of that negligence, the anticipations of the person whose
negligent act has produced the damage appear to me to be irrelevant.
I consider that the damages claimed are not too remote.

        , L.J.

The  defence

is  that  the  damage

is  too  remote  from  the
negligence, as it could not be reasonably foreseen as a consequence.
On  this  head  we  were  referred  to  a  number  of  well  known  cases  in
which  vague  language,  which  I  cannot  think  to  be  really  helpful,  has
been  used  in  an  attempt  to  deﬁne  the  point  at  which  damage
becomes  too  remote  from,  or  not  sufﬁciently  directly  caused  by,  the
is  the  original  cause  of  action,  to  be
breach  of  duty,  which
recoverable. For instance, I cannot think it useful to say the damage
must be the natural and probable result. This suggests that there are
results  which  are  natural  but  not  probable,  and  other  results  which
are  probable  but  not  natural.  I  am  not  sure  what  either  adjective

means in this connection; if they mean the same thing, two need not
be  used;  if  they  mean  different  things,  the  difference  between  them
should be deﬁned. . . . To determine whether an act is negligent, it is
relevant  to  determine  whether  any  reasonable  person  would  foresee
that  the  act  would  cause  damage;  if  he  would  not,  the  act  is  not
negligent. But if the act would or might probably cause damage, the
fact that the damage it in fact causes is not the exact kind of damage
one  would  expect  is  immaterial,  so  long  as  the  damage  is  in  fact
directly  traceable  to  the  negligent  act,  and  not  due  the  operation  of
independent  causes  having  no  connection  with  the  negligent  act,
except that they could not avoid its results. Once the act is negligent,
the fact that its exact operation was not foreseen is immaterial. . . . In
the present case it was negligent in discharging cargo to known down
the  planks  of  the  temporary  staging,  for  they  might  easily  cause
some damages either to workmen, or cargo, or the ship. The fact that
they  did  directly  produce  an  unexpected  result,  a  spark  in  an
atmosphere of petrol vapour which caused a ﬁre, does not relieve the
person who was negligent from the damage which his negligent act
directly caused.

LAUREANO v. LOUZOUN
560 N.Y.S.2d 337 (N.Y. App. Div. 1990)

          .

On  January  21,  1985,  the  plaintiff,  a  tenant  in  the  defendants’
premises, arose from bed at approximately 5 A.M. and put two large
pots of water on her stove to boil. While in the process of pouring the
boiling water from one pot into the other, the plaintiff banged the pots
against  each  other,  causing  the  boiling  water  to  spill  onto  her  knee
and  feet.  The  plaintiff  commenced  the  instant  action,  alleging,  inter
alia, that the defendants’ negligence in failing to provide heat and hot
water  to  the  premises  and  in  failing  to  maintain  the  boiler  in  proper

working condition caused the incident and her resulting injuries. The
plaintiff further alleged that the defendants had constructive notice of
the  defective  condition  at  least  two  weeks  prior  to  the  incident,  as
well as actual notice. The defendants moved for summary judgment
on  the  ground  that  their  conduct  was  not,  as  a  matter  of  law,  the
proximate cause of the plaintiff’s injuries. The trial court granted the
motion  holding  that  “there  was  no  connection  of  proximate  cause
between the lack of heat and the accident.” We afﬁrm.

The  defendants’  failure  to  provide  heat  and  hot  water  to  the
premises  was  not  the  proximate  cause,  as  a  matter  of  law,  of  the
injuries sustained by the plaintiff. [T]he defendants’ conduct gave rise
to  the  plaintiff’s  attempt  to  provide  a  substitute  supply  of  heat.  [Yet]
the  intervening  act  of  banging  one  pot  against  the  other  brought
about the injuries sustained by the plaintiff. Those injuries would not
have resulted from the failure to supply hot water alone, and cannot
be  classiﬁed  as  injuries  normally  to  have  been  expected  to  ensue
from the landlord’s conduct.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Direct Cause Test.  As enunciated in the Polemis case, the court
looked  to  determine  if  there  were  any  independent  intervening
actions  that  took  place  between  the  defendant’s  negligence  and  the
plaintiff’s  harm.  On  the  facts  of Polemis  and  Laureano,  why  is  there
proximate  cause  found  in  the  former  but  not  the  latter,  utilizing  this
standard  for  determining  proximate  cause?  Do  you  like  the  seeming
simplicity of this test for proximate cause or do you think it leads to
unfair results?

2.  Preference  for  Proximate  Cause  Tests.   Does  the  direct  cause
test,  which  does  not  require  that  the  harm  suffered  be  foreseeable
from  the  defendant’s  standpoint,  seem  to  be  a  pro-plaintiff  test  for
proximate  cause?  If  so,  why  does  the  plaintiff  in  Laureano  lose?  Do

you  see  why  the  court  believed  that  the  tenant’s  need  to  boil  water
was not an independent intervening cause while the tenant’s banging
of  the  pans  into  each  other  was  an  independent  intervening  cause?
Observe  that  it  only  takes  a  single  independent  intervening  cause  to
put a kink in the chain of causation.

3. Problems.
A.  Regarding  Polemis,  what  if  it  were  determined  that  the  initial
leak  of  petrol  vapors  was  due  to  the  antecedent  act  of
negligence  by  someone  coming  on  board  the  ship  and  spilling
the  product  in  the  ship’s  cargo  hold?  Would  that  originally
negligent actor be found to be a proximate cause of the loss of
the ship?

B.  Using  the  facts  from  Palsgraf,  analyze  proximate  causation

using the direct cause test.

C. The Foreseeability Test

While  some  courts  continue  to  use  the  direct  cause  test  to  analyze
proximate cause, a greater number of courts have come to embrace
a foreseeability test for proximate cause. This test considers whether
the  nature  of  the  harm  or  accident  giving  rise  to  the  plaintiff’s  claim
was  the  same  general  type  of  harm  or  accident  that  was  within  the
scope  of  the  original  risk  that  permitted  a  ﬁnding  of  breach  of  the
duty  of  reasonable  care.  There  is  a  natural  symmetry,  therefore,
between  this  proximate  cause  test  and  the  Learned  Hand  analysis
already  employed  in  the  breach  determination.  The  following  case
illustrates its application to another scenario involving a rather bizarre
twist  of  events.  As  you  read  each  case  in  the  Proximate  Cause
section of this book, consider whether the facts of each case would
satisfy the other proximate cause tests as well. Doing so will help you
conclude whether, and to what extent, the choice of proximate cause
tests matters.

1. Whether the Type of Accident Was Within the Scope

of the Risk

TIEDER v. LITTLE
502 So. 2d 923 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1987)

       , J.

This is a consolidated appeal by the plaintiffs from (1) a ﬁnal order
dismissing a complaint as to one defendant, and (2) a ﬁnal summary
judgment entered in favor of a second defendant, in a wrongful death
action.  The  trial  court  concluded  that  the  defendants’  alleged
negligence  was  not,  as  a  matter  of  law,  a  proximate  cause  of  the
death  of  the  plaintiffs’  decedent.  For  the  reasons  which  follow,  we
disagree and reverse.

The  facts  of  this  case,  as  alleged  in  the  operative  complaint  and
as developed by the discovery and afﬁdavits ﬁled in the record, may
be briefly stated as follows.

On  January  7,  1983,  at  approximately  9:00  P.M.,  the  plaintiffs’
decedent, Trudi Beth Tieder, was struck by an automobile, pinned up
against  a  brick  wall,  and  killed  when  the  wall  collapsed  on  her — as
she  walked  out  the  front  door  of  Eaton  Hall  dormitory  on  the
University  of  Miami  campus.  At  the  time,  two  students  were
attempting to clutch-start an automobile in the circular drive in front
of  Eaton  Hall — one  student  was  pushing  the  car  while  the  other
student  was  in  the  car  behind  the  wheel — when,  suddenly,  the
student behind the wheel lost control of the car. The automobile left
the  circular  driveway,  lurched  over  a  three-inch  curb  onto  a  grassy
area,  and  travelled  some  thirty-three  feet  across  the  front  lawn
parallel  to  Eaton  Hall.  The  automobile  collided  with  an  elevated
walkway leading out of the front door of Eaton Hall, jumped onto the
walkway,  and  struck  the  plaintiffs’  decedent  as  she  walked  out  the

front  door  of  the  dormitory.  The  automobile  continued  forward,
pinning  the  decedent  against  a  high  brick  wall  that  supported  a
concrete  canopy  at  the  entrance  to  the  dormitory.  Because  the  wall
was  negligently  designed  and  constructed  without  adequate
supports  required  by  the  applicable  building  code,  the  entire  wall
came  off  intact  from  its  foundation  and  crushed  her  to  death.  Dr.
Joseph Davis, the Dade County Medical Examiner, averred by afﬁdavit
that in his opinion the decedent would not have died merely from the
automobile  impact;  in  his  opinion,  she  died  as  a  result  of  the  brick
wall  falling  intact  and  in  one  piece  upon  her.  Two  afﬁdavits  of
professional  engineers  were  also  ﬁled  below  detailing  the  negligent
design and construction of the subject brick wall.

The  plaintiffs  Sheila  M.  Tieder  and  Richard  J.  Tieder,
administrators of the estate of Trudi Beth Tieder, brought a wrongful
death  action  against:  (1)  the  owner  and  the  operator  of  the
automobile  (not  parties  to  this  appeal),  (2)  Robert  M.  Little,  the
architect who designed the allegedly defective brick wall, and (3) the
University  of  Miami,  which  caused  the  said  brick  wall  to  be  erected
and maintained. The amended complaint charged the defendant Little
and  the  University  of  Miami  with  various  acts  of  negligent  conduct
including negligence in the design and construction of the brick wall.
The defendant Little moved to dismiss the complaint against him and
urged  that  his  alleged  negligence  was  not,  as  a  matter  of  law,  the
proximate cause of the decedent’s death because the entire accident
was  so  bizarre  as  to  be  entirely  unforeseeable;  the  University  of
Miami  moved  for  a  summary  judgment  in  its  favor  and  made  the
same argument. The trial court agreed and granted both motions.

In the instant case, the parties appear to agree that, for complaint
dismissal and summary judgment purposes, the ﬁrst two elements of
the  plaintiff’s  negligence  (wrongful  death)  action  are  shown  on  this
record. It is solely the third element of “proximate cause” which is in
dispute  in  this  case.  The  defendants  contended  below,  and  the  trial
court  agreed,  that  the  defendants’  negligence  in  designing  and

constructing the brick wall was not, as a matter of law, the proximate
cause  of  the  death  of  the  plaintiffs’  decedent.  The  plaintiffs,  on  the
other  hand,  contend  that  the  complaint  alleges  sufﬁcient  facts,  and
the record raises sufﬁcient issues of material fact, that a jury issue is
presented on the proximate cause element. It is therefore necessary
to  consult  the  applicable  Florida  law  on  “proximate  cause”  in
negligence actions as applied to the facts presented herein.

At  the  outset,  the  “proximate  cause”  element  of  a  negligence
action  embraces,  as  a  sine  qua  non  ingredient,  a  causation-in-fact
test, that is, the defendant’s negligence must be a cause-in-fact of the
plaintiff’s injuries. Generally speaking, Florida courts have followed a
“but-for” causation-in-fact test, that is, “to constitute proximate cause
there  must  be  such  a  natural,  direct  and  continuous  sequence
between the negligent act [or omission] and the [plaintiff’s] injury that
it can be reasonably said that but for the [negligent] act [or omission]
the injury would not have occurred.” There is, however, a “substantial
factor”  exception  to  the  “but-for”  test  where  two  causes  concur  to
bring  about  an  event  in  fact,  either  one  of  which  would  have  been
sufﬁcient  to  cause  the  identical  result.  Stahl  v.  Metropolitan  Dade
County,  438  So.  2d  14,  18-19  (Fla.  3d  DCA  1983).  In  that  narrow
circumstance, it is settled that a “defendant’s conduct in an action for
personal injuries is considered a cause [in fact] of the event if it was a
material and substantial factor in bringing it about.” Loftin v. Wilson,
67 So. 2d 185, 191 (Fla. 1953).

In  addition  to  the  causation-in-fact  test,  the  “proximate  cause”
element  of  a  negligence  action  includes  a  second  indispensable
showing.  This  showing  is  designed  to  protect  defendants  from  tort
liability  for  results  which,  although  caused-in-fact  by  the  defendant’s
negligent  act  or  omission,  seem  to  the  judicial  mind  highly  unusual,
extraordinary, or bizarre, or, stated differently, seem beyond the scope
of  any  fair  assessment  of  the  danger  created  by  the  defendant’s
negligence. The courts here have required a common sense, fairness
showing  that  the  accident  in  which  the  plaintiff  suffered  his  injuries

was  within  the  scope  of  the  danger  created  by  the  defendant’s
negligence,  or  stated  differently,  that  the  said  accident  was  a
reasonably foreseeable consequence of the defendant’s negligence.

It is not necessary, however, that the defendant foresee the exact
sequence  of  events  which  led  to  the  accident  sued  upon;  it  is  only
necessary that the general type of accident which has occurred was
within the scope of the danger created by the defendant’s negligence,
or,  stated  differently,  it  must  be  shown  that  the  said  general-type
accident  was  a  reasonably
foreseeable  consequence  of  the
defendant’s  negligence.  .  .  .  Moreover,  it  has  long  been  held  that
“proximate cause” issues are generally for juries to decide using their
common sense upon appropriate instructions, although occasionally
when reasonable people cannot differ, the issue has been said to be
one of law for the court.

Turning  now  to  the  instant  case,  we  have  no  difﬁculty  in
concluding  that  the  trial  court  erred  in  dismissing  the  complaint
against  the  defendant  Little  and
in  entering  a  ﬁnal  summary
judgment in favor of the University of Miami. This is so because the
complaint sufﬁciently alleges the proximate cause element herein as
to  the  defendant  Little,  and  the  record  raises  genuine  issues  of
material fact with reference to the same element as to the defendant
University of Miami.

alleged
Plainly,
in  designing  and
negligence
constructing
the  brick  wall
adjoining  the  entrance  way  to
Eaton  Hall  in  this  case  was  a
cause-in-fact  of  the  accident
which  led  to  the  death  of  the
plaintiffs’ decedent. It is alleged
that the said wall was designed
insufﬁcient
and  built  with
supports as required by the applicable building code so that, when it

was impacted in this case, it fell over intact, and in one piece, on the
decedent. Dr. Joseph Davis, the Dade County Medical Examiner, avers
that  in  his  opinion  the  decedent  died  as  a  result  of  the  brick  wall
falling intact upon her. “But for” the negligent design and construction
of  the  brick  wall  which  led  to  its  collapse  in  one  piece,  then,  the
decedent would not have died. A jury question is therefore presented
on this aspect of the proximate cause element.

The foreseeability aspect of the proximate cause element is also
satisﬁed  in  this  case  for  the  complaint  dismissal  and  summary
judgment purposes. The collapse of a brick wall resulting in the death
of  a  person  near  such  wall  is  plainly  a  reasonably  foreseeable
consequence  of  negligently  designing  and  constructing  such  a  wall
without adequate supports in violation of applicable building codes —
even though the exact sequence of events leading to the collapse of
the  wall — as  in  this  case,  the  bizarre  incident  involving  the  clutch-
started automobile leaving the circular driveway and striking the wall
— may  have  been  entirely  unforeseeable.  The  general-type  accident
which  occurred  in  this  case — namely,  the  collapse  of  the  brick  wall
resulting  in  the  decedent’s  death — was  entirely  within  the  scope  of
the  danger  created  by  the  defendants’  negligence  in  designing  and
constructing  the  wall  without  adequate  supports,  and  was  a
reasonably  foreseeable  consequence  of  such  negligence.  Just  as
injuries sustained by business patrons in attempting to escape a ﬁre
in a cafeteria or hotel was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of
the  cafeteria  or  hotel’s  negligence  in  failing  to  have  adequate  ﬁre
exits,  even  though  the  act  of  the  arsonist  in  setting  the  building
aflame was entirely unforeseeable — so too the death of the plaintiffs’
decedent was entirely foreseeable in this case even though the exact
sequence of events leading to the collapse of the wall may have been
unforeseeable.  This  being  so,  a  jury  issue  is  presented  on  the
proximate  cause  element  as  pled  in  the  complaint  and  revealed  by
this record.

The  ﬁnal  order  of  dismissal  and  the  ﬁnal  summary  judgment
under review are both reversed and the cause is remanded to the trial
court for further proceedings.
Reversed and remanded.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Learned Hand Formula Gets Double Duty.  The foreseeability test
for proximate cause, in effect, goes back to the same Learned Hand
formula we saw courts employ in analyzing issues of breach of duty.
If  the  accident  that  hurt  the  plaintiff  was  one  of  those  possible
accidents that led to the conclusion that defendant breached its duty,
by failing to exercise enough care to avoid it from occurring, then the
foreseeability  test  is  satisﬁed.  What  types  of  events  were  within  the
scope of the foreseeable risks of harm that would have compelled the
reasonable  person  to  comply  with  the  building  code  in  Tieder?  Is
what  happened  to  the  plaintiff — an  insufﬁciently  supported  wall
collapsing when force was applied to it — the reason for compliance
with the building code?

2.  Popularity  of  the  Foreseeability  Test.   Though  some  courts
persist in using the direct cause test, and some others have adopted
a substantial factor test (which we will explore next), the majority of
courts  analyze  proximate  cause  using  the  foreseeability  test.  Even
English  courts  that  created  the  direct  cause  test — as  we  saw  in
Polemis — subsequently  rejected  that  analysis.  In  the  case  of  The
Wagon  Mound,  1961  A.C.  388  (P.C.),  the  Privy  Council  opined:
“Enough  has  been  said  to  show  that  the  authority  of  Polemis  has
been  severely  shaken  though  lip-service  has  from  time  to  time  been
paid to it. In their Lordships’ opinion it should no longer be regarded
as  good  law.”  Instead,  the  court  adopted  the  test  of  reasonable
foreseeability.

3.  Palsgraf  Revisited.   In  dissent,  Judge  Andrews  analyzed  the
plaintiff’s  accident  in  Palsgraf  under  the  various  proximate  cause
tests.  With  respect  to  the  foreseeability  test,  he  concluded  that
“surely, given such an explosion as here it needed no great foresight
to  predict  that  the  natural  result  would  be  to  injure  one  on  the
platform  at  no  greater  distance  .  .  .  than  was  the  plaintiff.”  Do  you
agree  with  Judge  Andrews’  application  of  the  foreseeability  test  for
proximate cause? Was it the foreseeable risk of injury to Ms. Palsgraf
that made the railway employees’ decision to reach out and touch the
leaping  passenger  negligent?  The  dissenters  at  the  intermediate
court  of  appeals  (who  voted  to  reverse  the  plaintiff’s  judgment)
believed that the defendant should have prevailed, not on duty, but on
a  ﬁnding  of  no  proximate  cause:  “The  negligence  of  defendant  was
not  a  proximate  cause  of  the  injuries  to  plaintiff.  The  explosion  was
not reasonably probable as a result of defendant’s act of negligence.
The negligence of defendant was not a likely or natural cause of the
explosion,  since  the  latter  was  such  an  unusual  occurrence.”  225

foreseeability
sometimes  asserted  that  they  should  not  be  liable  if  the  amount  of
harm  suffered  by  the  plaintiff  is  greater  than  could  have  been
reasonably  foreseen.  For  example,  imagine  a  driver  goes  through  a
red  light  and  hits  a  very  frail  pedestrian.  This  plaintiff  suffers
permanent,  disabling  injuries  due  to  a  prior  history  of  orthopedic
problems  with  her  legs.  Courts  reject  this  attempt  to  limit  liability,
citing  the  Eggshell  Plaintiff  rule — that  a  negligent  tortfeasor  “takes
his victim as he ﬁnds him.” The Restatement of Torts (Second) §461
cmt.  a  (1965)  states  that,  “A  negligent  actor  must  bear  the  risk  that
his  liability  will  be  increased  by  reason  of  the  actual  physical
condition  of  the  other  toward  whom  his  act  is  negligent.”  A  related
doctrine  is  the  Shabby  Millionaire  Rule,  which  makes  a  defendant
lost  wages)  of
liable  for  unforeseeable  economic

losses  (i.e.,

someone who appeared to have a low income. Thus, for purposes of
proximate  cause,  the  extent  of  harm  need  not  be  foreseeable.  How
does  this  compare  with  breach  analysis  in  terms  of  whether  the
extent of harm is pertinent? Remember the Learned Hand formula in
pondering  this  distinction.  How  does  this  formula  reflect  the  reality
that  the  extent  of  foreseeable  harm  is  directly  relevant  to  analyzing
breach of the duty of reasonable care?

2. Breach of Duty Does Not Necessarily Prove

Proximate Cause

CRANKSHAW v. PIEDMONT DRIVING CLUB
156 S.E.2d 208 (Ga. Ct. App. 1967)

Plaintiff  Elizabeth  Crankshaw  seeks  damages  against  Piedmont
Driving Club, Inc. alleging that on January 15, 1966, she in company

with R.M. Harris and Miss Arlene Harris patronized the dining room of
the  defendant;  that  Miss  Harris  ordered  shrimp  and  began  eating
same at which time she noticed a peculiar odor emanating from the
shrimp dish causing her to feel nauseated; that Miss Harris excused
herself  and  proceeded  toward  the  rest  room;  shortly  thereafter
plaintiff  proceeded  toward  the  rest  room  to  give  aid  and  comfort  to
Miss  Harris  and  as  plaintiff  entered  the  rest  room  she  saw  Miss
Harris  leaning  over  one  of  the  bowls;  that  “unbeknownst  to  plaintiff,
Miss  Harris  had  vomited  just  inside  the  entrance  to  the  rest  room”
and  that  as  she  hurried  toward  her  she  “stepped  into  the  vomit,  and
her feet flew out from under her,” causing her to fall and break her hip.
The  petition  alleged  negligence  of
in  selling
unwholesome, deleterious food and in failing to clean up the floor of
the rest room or to warn plaintiff of the condition of the floor.

the  defendant

The trial court sustained the defendant’s general demurrer to the

petition, from which judgment the plaintiff appeals.

      , J.

Appellant

in  her  brief  properly  abandons  the  allegation  of
negligence  due  to  defendant’s  failure  to  clean  the  regurgitated
substance from the floor since under the facts alleged the defendant
had no notice, actual or constructive, of its presence on the floor prior
to  plaintiff’s  fall.  Appellant  contends,  however,  that  “the  heart  of  the
legal  question  presented”  is  whether  or  not  the  negligent  serving  of
unwholesome  food  to  Miss  Harris  was  the  proximate  cause  of  her
(appellant’s)  injury.  Viewing  the  case  from  this  posed  question  we
conclude  that  the  trial  court  was  correct  in  sustaining  the  general
demurrer.

“If  the  damages  are  only  the  imaginary  or  possible  result  of  the
tortious  act,  or  other  and  contingent  circumstances  preponderate
largely in causing the injurious effect, such damages are too remote
to be the basis of recovery against the wrongdoer.” Code  §105-2008.
Damages  must  flow  from  the  “legal  and  natural  result  of  the  act

done.” Code §105-2009. The question of proximate cause is one for a
jury  except  in  palpably  clear  and  indisputable  cases.  We  think  the
facts alleged in this petition bring it within the exception and subject
it  to  be  ruled  upon  as  a  matter  of  law.  The  court  must  assume  this
burden  where  a  jury  can  draw  but  one  reasonable  conclusion  if  the
facts  alleged  are  proved,  that  conclusion  being  that  the  acts  of  the
defendant were not the proximate cause of the injury. In our opinion a
jury  could  not  reasonably  conclude  that  the  plaintiff’s  injury  was
proximately  caused  by  the  defendant’s  negligence
in  serving
unwholesome food to another person.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Foreseeability  of  Any  Harm  Not  Sufﬁcient.   A  demurrer  to  an
original  petition  is  a  state  court  equivalent  in  Georgia  to  a  federal
court  motion  to  dismiss  for  failure  to  state  a  cause  of  action  under
Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  12(b)(6).  All  facts  alleged  must  be  accepted  as  true.
Despite  this  standard  for  reviewing  the  plaintiff’s  pleading  favorably,
the  court  still  found  in  Crankshaw  that  plaintiff  could  not  possibly
prove  proximate  cause.  Even  though  defendant  might  have  been
in  serving  tainted  seafood,  the  court  ﬁnds  that  the
negligent
reasonably  foreseeable  risks  involved  in  serving  such  food  do  not
include  a  slip-and-fall  incident.  Though  such  an  outcome  might  be
“imaginary” or “possible” this is not the same as saying that it would
be reasonably foreseeable.

2. Problems.
A.  Assume  that  a  country  club  has  a  policy  that  forbids
unaccompanied  children  under  the  age  of  8  years  old  from
swimming in the club pool, even though the club has a full-time
lifeguard  on  duty.  One  summer  afternoon  the  lifeguard  fails  to
enforce  this  policy  and  a  6-year-old  boy  is  permitted  to  swim
without any parental supervision or presence. Later that day the

boy  comes  down  sick  from  a  bacterial  infection  he  contracted
during that afternoon swim in the contaminated pool. If he can
prove  negligence  against  the  country  club  for  letting  him  swim
without  escort,  will  he  also  be  able  to  establish  proximate
cause?

B. Would the Polemis case have had a different outcome under the

foreseeability test than under the direct cause test?

C.  By  contrast,  take  the  facts  from  the  University  of  Miami  in  the
Tieder case and apply the direct cause test for proximate cause
with respect to the alleged negligence of designing the wall with
improper supports. Under the foreseeability test the court ﬁnds
proximate  cause  does  potentially  exist.  But  under  the  direct
cause test, do you see any independent intervening actions that
occurred after the design of the wall and prior to the death of the
student? If so, this intervening action will put a kink in the chain
of causation and cut off liability to the architect and owner.

D.  Again  using  the  facts  from  Tieder,  would  the  direct  cause  test
provide  any  protection  to  the  students  who  clutch-started  their
car?  Were  there  any  independent  intervening  acts  after  their
negligence in starting and losing control of their car?

D. The Substantial Factor Test

The ﬁnal test that some courts use in their proximate cause analysis
is  the  substantial  factor  test.  This  test  was  ﬁrst  employed  as  an
alternative  to  the  but-for  test  of  actual  cause  in  cases  where  the
doctrine of multiple independent sufﬁcient causes applies (the Florida
appellate court in Tieder discussed this use of the substantial factor
test). Multiple courts, however, have since employed the test as their
primary  test  for  proximate  cause.  We  will  ﬁrst  familiarize  ourselves
with the substantial factor test in Brisboy — a case involving multiple
independent  sufﬁcient  causes,  where  the  court  is  using  it  as  an

alternative  to  but-for  actual  causation.  Following  that  we  will
encounter  the  test  as  a  standard  for  ﬁnding  proximate  cause  in
Thorne Equipment.

1. Introduction to the Substantial Factor Test

In its earliest inception, the substantial factor test was introduced by
courts  as  an  alternative  to  the  but-for  test  for  actual  causation  in
scenarios where there were multiple independent sufﬁcient causes —
such as we saw earlier in this chapter with the two ﬁres burning down
the plaintiff’s property. Understanding that it was impossible for either
of  the  two  ﬁres  to  constitute  a  true  but-for  cause,  courts  began
instead to ask whether either or both of the ﬁres were a “substantial
factor” in causing the plaintiff’s harm. The Brisboy case below depicts
just  such  a  scenario  where  the  court  utilizes  the  substantial  factor
test as an alternative to demanding proof that any of the defendants’
conduct (or here, products) was a but-for cause of the harm.

BRISBOY v. FIBREBOARD PAPER PRODUCTS CORP.

Charlotte  Rand  ﬁled  a  complaint  on  October  31,  1979,  seeking
damages  for  the  wrongful  death  of  her  husband,  Charles  Rand.
Plaintiff  alleged  that  her  decedent  died  as  a  result  of  lung  cancer
caused  by  asbestosis  contracted  during  his  26-year  career  as  an
asbestos  insulation  worker.  Plaintiff  named  as  defendants  the  nine

employers  her  decedent  had  worked  for  from  1951  until  1977,  but
three  of  those  defendants  settled  with  the  plaintiff  prior  to  trial.  [By
the end of trial the lone remaining defendant was Fibreboard.]

The  testimony  of  a  coworker  of  the  decedent,  Laurence  Jean,
revealed  that  the  decedent  worked  for  the  defendant  for  at  least  six
months  and  at  most  nine  months  as  an  asbestos  insulator,  i.e.,
applying insulation material containing asbestos to various pipes. Mr.
Jean testiﬁed that the air was “very, very dusty” while performing the
work, and that there was no way to avoid breathing this dust.

The  evidence  presented  at  trial  also  revealed  that  plaintiff’s
decedent  was  a  heavy  cigarette  user,  having  smoked  two  packs  per
day  for  30  years.  The  effect  of  the  cigarette  use  on  the  plaintiff’s
condition  was  disputed  by  the  medical  experts  presented  by  the
parties.  Dr.  Joseph  Wagoner,  appearing  on  behalf  of  the  plaintiff,
discounted the effect of Mr. Rand’s cigarette smoking on the grounds
that Mr. Rand died of adenocarcinoma, and that cigarette smoking is
more  related  to  the  squamous-type  cell,  not  the  adeno  type.  Dr.
Wagoner  concluded  that  cigarette  smoking  does  not  increase  an
asbestos worker’s risk of developing lung cancer.

Dr.  Leighton  Kong,  who  performed  the  autopsy  on  the  decedent,
admitted that cigarette smoking can be related to adenocarcinoma of
the  lung,  and  in  fact  could  have  been  the  sole  cause  of  Mr.  Rand’s
lung  cancer.  However,  Dr.  Kong  believed  that  there  is  a  stronger  link
between asbestosis and cancer than cigarette smoking and cancer.

Dr.  Gerrit  Scheppes  also  testiﬁed  on  plaintiff’s  behalf.  Dr.
Scheppes  indicated  that,  in  his  opinion,  Mr.  Rand’s  lung  cancer  was
caused  by  asbestosis.  However,  Dr.  Scheppes  admitted  that  Mr.
Rand’s  history  of  cigarette  smoking  played  a  minor  contributing  role
in the development of his lung cancer.

The  defendant’s  medical  evidence  included  the  testimony  of  Dr.
Harry  Demopoulos.  Dr.  Demopoulos  opined  that  Mr.  Rand  did  not
suffer from asbestosis and that Mr. Rand’s adenocarcinoma was due

solely to cigarette smoking. Dr. William Weiss testiﬁed that Mr. Rand
had no evidence of pulmonary asbestosis and, in light of this fact, Mr.
Rand’s development of lung cancer was attributable to his history of
cigarette smoking. Dr. Weiss also testiﬁed that, while asbestosis and
cigarette  smoking  can  combine  to  create  a  synergistic  effect  and
thus a greater risk of developing lung cancer than the additive risk of
the  two  factors  alone,  this  increased  risk  does  not  exist  without  the
presence of asbestosis.

On  appeal,  defendant  ﬁrst  argues  that  there  was  insufﬁcient
evidence  to  establish  that  Mr.  Rand’s  six-to  nine-month  exposure  to
defendant’s  asbestos  products  was  a  proximate  cause  of  his  death.
Defendant  argues  that  the  trial  court  therefore  improperly  denied
defendant’s motion for a directed verdict . . . .

Under  Michigan  law,  an  actor  will  not  be  held  liable  for  his
negligent  conduct  unless  that  conduct  was  a  legal  or  proximate
cause  of  the  harm  to  the  plaintiff.  There  may  be  more  than  one
proximate cause of an injury, and thus the mere fact that some other
cause concurs, contributes, or cooperates to produce an injury does
not relieve any of the parties whose negligent conduct was one of the
causes of the plaintiff’s harm. An actor’s negligent conduct will not be
a  legal  or  proximate  cause  of  the  harm  to  another  unless  that
conduct was a substantial factor in bringing about the harm. McLean
v.  Rogers,  300  N.W.2d  389  (1980).  One  of  the  considerations  in
determining  whether  an  actor’s  conduct  was  a  substantial  factor  in
bringing  about  the  harm  to  another  is  “the  number  of  other  factors
which  contribute  in  producing  the  harm  and  the  extent  of  the  effect
which they have in producing it.” 2 Restatement Torts, 2d, §433(a), p.
432. Where a number of events each contribute to the ultimate harm,
one may have such a predominant effect as to make the effect of a
particular  actor’s  negligence  insigniﬁcant.  On  the  other  hand,  where
none  of  the  contributing  factors  has  a  predominant  effect,  their
combined effect may act to dilute the effect of the actor’s negligence

and  prevent  it  from  becoming  a  substantial  factor  in  bringing  about
the harm.

The  plaintiff’s  proofs,  viewed  in  the  light  most  favorable  to  him,
revealed the following. Mr. Rand’s autopsy indicated that he died from
cancer  resulting  from  asbestosis  and  that  there  was  a  massive
amount  of  asbestos  in  his  lungs.  The  nature  of  the  disease  from
which Mr. Rand suffered is that it progresses cumulatively, with each
group  of  asbestos  ﬁbers  which  lodges  in  the  lung  doing  damage  to
the area in which it is present. The exposure to asbestos need not be
extensive,  and,  in  fact,  even  one  month  of  exposure  may  cause
asbestosis  and  ultimately  result  in  the  victim’s  death.  Consequently,
there is no safe level of exposure to any carcinogen.

This  evidence  was  sufﬁcient  to  permit  reasonable  minds  to
conclude that Mr. Rand died, at least in part, due to the development
of  asbestosis  in  his  lungs  as  a  result  of  his  inhalation  of  asbestos
ﬁbers  during  his  working  career.  While  plaintiff  naturally  could  not
directly  prove  that  defendant’s  asbestos  ﬁbers  caused  the  disease
which led to his death (it is impossible to determine which particular
ﬁbers from the group of ﬁbers to which Mr. Rand was exposed in his
career caused the disease), plaintiff did establish that, during the time
Mr.  Rand  worked  with  defendant’s  product,  the  air  was  extremely
dusty and that, when asbestos dust is visible, it necessarily implies an
extreme  exposure.  Plaintiff  also  established  that  each  ﬁber  which
lodges  in  the  lung  causes  asbestosis  in  the  area  around  that  ﬁber.
Thus,  reasonable  minds  could  conclude  that  Mr.  Rand  inhaled
asbestos ﬁbers from defendant’s product and developed asbestosis.
The  only  remaining  issue,  therefore,  is  whether  the  harm  caused  by
defendant’s  negligent  conduct  was  a  substantial  factor  in  bringing
about the disease which led to Mr. Rand’s death. While clearly a close
question, we ﬁnd that there was sufﬁcient evidence in plaintiff’s favor
to withstand a motion for a directed verdict. Evidence was presented
which  showed  that  Mr.  Rand  was  heavily  exposed  to  defendant’s
product for six to nine months, that asbestos products were phased

out  in  the  early  1970’s,  and  that  Mr.  Rand  was  exposed  to  asbestos
products  only  50  percent  of  the  time  at  work  during  the  years  from
1954-1962.  This  conclusion  is  supported  by  two  federal  court
opinions  dealing  with  the  complex  problem  of  proof  in  asbestosis
cases: Borel v. Fibreboard Paper Products Corp, 493 F.2d 1076 (C.A.
5,  1973),  cert den  419  U.S.  869;  42  L.  Ed.  2d  107  (1974);  Migues  v.
Fibreboard Corp, 662 F.2d 1182 (C.A. 5, 1981). We therefore ﬁnd that
the  trial  court  properly  denied  defendant’s  motion  for  a  directed
verdict.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Substantial  Factor  as  an  Alternative  to  “But-For.”   Early  on,  the
substantial  factor  test  was  utilized  by  some  courts  when  the
conceptual  problem  with  the  but-for  test  precluded  its  use  because
there were multiple, independently sufﬁcient causes — as in Kingston,
where  there  were  two  ﬁres  of  roughly  equal  size  which  converged
upon  the  plaintiff’s  property.  That  court  discussed  the  fact  that  the
defendant might prevail if it could show that the ﬁre it started was so
small and insubstantial in comparison to the ﬁre from the northwest
quadrant of Chicago. This type of analysis gave rise to courts asking
in  such  cases  whether  the  defendant’s  conduct  was  a  “substantial
factor” in causing the harm rather than a “but-for” factor in causing it.
Some courts, as we will see in the next case, subsequently borrowed
this  test  as  their  primary  test  for  proximate  cause  rather  than  being
used  solely  as  a  substitute  test  for  actual  cause.  Used  in  either
context, however, it is the same test.

2.  Review:  Multiple  Independent  Sufﬁcient  Causes.   Under  what
view of the facts in Brisboy would that case illustrate an instance of
independent  sufﬁcient  causes?  What  expert  evidence
multiple
suggested that the asbestos that the plaintiff was exposed to, at any

of  the  nine  employer’s  locations,  might  have  been  sufﬁcient  to  have
caused  the  disease  without  the  cooperation  of  any  other  exposure?
The  Restatement  (Third)  identiﬁes  toxic  tort  cases  as  illustrating
multiple independent sufﬁcient causes where there is some threshold
dose  sufﬁcient  to  cause  the  disease  and  the  plaintiff  is  exposed  to
such doses from multiple defendants. §27 cmt. g (2011).

3.  Restatement  Formulation  of  the  Substantial  Factor  Test.   The
Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts  §433(2)  (1965)  shows  how  the
substantial  factor  test  should  be  utilized  in  cases  of  multiple
independent sufﬁcient causes:

If  two  forces  are  actively  operating,  one  because  of  the  actor’s
negligence, the other not because of any misconduct on his part,
and each of itself is sufﬁcient to bring about the harm to another,
the actor’s negligence may be found to be a substantial factor in
bringing it about. (Emphasis added.)

In the next case, we will see the court explore all of the factors to be
considered  in  the  substantial  factor  test  in  determining  whether  an
actual cause of an event is also a proximate cause of an event.

2. Substantial Factor as a Test for Proximate Cause

Eventually, having been introduced to the substantial factor test as an
alternative to but-for actual causation, some courts began to turn to
the  substantial  factor  test  as  a  proximate  cause  test — as  an
alternative  to  either  the  direct  cause  or  the  foreseeability  test.  The
American  Truck  Leasing  case  below  is  an  example  of  a  modern
court’s  adaptation  of  the  substantial  factor  test  as  its  jurisdiction’s
primary test for proximate cause in a setting where but-for cause was
undisputed.  Notice  the  various  criteria  courts  utilize  in  applying  the
modern substantial factor test.

AMERICAN TRUCK LEASING, INC. v. THORNE
EQUIPMENT CO.
583 A.2d 1242 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1991)

In  this  case,  the  trial  court  determined  as  a  matter  of  law  that  a
property  owner’s  alleged  negligence,  even  if  proved,  was  not  a
substantial  factor  in  causing  the  plaintiff’s  loss.  Therefore,  the  court
sustained preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer to those
counts of the plaintiff’s complaint which asserted liability on the part
of the property owner. After careful review, we afﬁrm.

Dorothy  Gross  was  the  owner  of  a  vacant  building
[in]
Philadelphia.  On  June  27,  1988,  between  1:30  and  2:30  a.m.,  a  ﬁre
started  in  combustible  trash  and  debris  which  had  been  allowed  to
accumulate on the premises. The ﬁre spread across a narrow street
and  damaged  premises  .  .  .  owned  by  Joseph  A.  Tartaglia  and
occupied  for  business  purposes  by  JATCO,  Inc.  The  ﬁre  burned  for
more  than  eight  hours  before  being  extinguished.  Pursuant  to  a
determination  made  by  the  City  of  Philadelphia,  Thorne  Equipment
was  engaged  thereafter  to  demolish  a  six  story  elevator  shaft  on
Tartaglia’s land. This elevator shaft, although still standing, had been
damaged by the ﬁre. Thorne Equipment began its demolition work on
June 28, 1988, but during the course thereof a portion of the elevator
shaft  fell  upon  and  damaged  buildings  and  vehicles  owned  by  the
plaintiffs, American Truck Lines, Inc. and American Truck Leasing, Inc.
(American).  American  thereafter  ﬁled  a  civil  action  against  Thorne
Equipment,  the  City  of  Philadelphia,  Tartaglia,  JATCO,  Inc.  and
Dorothy  Gross.  All  claims  remain  undetermined  in  the  trial  court
except  the  claim  against  Dorothy  Gross,  which  has  been  summarily
dismissed.

American  alleged

established by calling to mind,
that, if the injured person had
never been born, the injury
would not have happened. So
the courts ask another question:
Was the wrong act the

occurrence  of  a  ﬁre.  That
negligence,  if  it  existed,  would

to  be  a  substantial  factor  in
bringing  about  such  harm.
Restatement (Second) of Torts
§431. Factors to be considered
in  determining  whether  an  act
in
is  a  substantial
bringing about harm to another
in
enumerated
are
Restatement (Second) of Torts
§433 as follows:

factor

following
in
themselves  or  in  combination  with  one  another  important  in
determining whether the actor’s conduct is a substantial factor
in bringing about harm to another:

considerations

The

are

(a)  the  number  of  other  factors  which  contribute  in
producing  the  harm  and  the  extent  of  the  effect  which  they
have in producing it;

(b)  whether  the  actor’s  conduct  has  created  a  force  or
series of forces which are in continuous and active operation
up  to  the  time  of  the  harm,  or  has  created  a  situation
harmless  unless  acted  upon  by  other  forces  for  which  the
actor is not responsible;
(c) lapse of time.

When these considerations are applied to the facts of the instant
case, they demonstrate that even if Dorothy Gross had been negligent
in  allowing  combustible  trash  to  accumulate  on  her  property,  such
accumulation was too far removed factually and chronologically from
American’s harm to be a legal cause thereof. Gross’s negligence was
passive  and  harmless  until  acted  upon  by  an  independent  force.
Moreover,  the  ﬁre  which  erupted  on  her  property  was  extinguished
before any harm had occurred to American. The negligence for which
she  was  responsible,  if  any,  was  not  in  active  operation  at  the  time
when damages were caused to American’s property. Those damages
were  caused  on  the  day  following  the  ﬁre  because  of  the  manner  in
which  the  ﬁre-weakened  elevator  shaft  was  demolished  by  Thorne
Equipment. Because the negligent accumulation of combustible trash
was  too  far  removed  from  the  damages  to  American’s  property  and
because  those  damages  were  caused  by  the  intervening  act  of  the
demolition  contractor,  it  cannot  be  said  legally  or  factually  that  the
alleged  negligence  of  Dorothy  Gross  was  a  substantial  factor  in
causing harm to American.

In  Ford  v.  Jeffries,  379  A.2d  111  (Pa.  1977),  the  Supreme  Court
held that it was for the jury to determine whether a property owner’s
negligence  in  maintaining  his  property  in  a  state  of  disrepair  was  a
substantial  factor  in  causing  the  harm  to  a  neighbor’s  property
damaged  by  ﬁre  originating  on  the  original  owner’s  property.  In  the
instant  case,  however,  American’s  property  damage  was  not  caused
by  a  spreading  ﬁre.  It  was  caused,  rather,  by  the  demolition  of  a  ﬁre
damaged  grain  elevator  after  the  ﬁre  had  been  extinguished.  This
demolition  constituted  an
independent  agency.  We  conclude,
therefore, that the trial court correctly determined that Dorothy Gross,
as a matter of law, was not legally responsible for appellant’s harm.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Actual  and  Proximate  Cause.   In  Thorne,  the  court  does  not
discuss  actual  cause,  apparently  because  defendant  Dorothy  Gross
did  not  contest  that  type  of  required  causation.  Do  you  understand
how  Gross’s  alleged  negligence  in  letting  the  ﬁre  start  would  be
considered an actual but-for cause of the plaintiff’s property damage?
If there had never been the ﬁre, would there have been any demolition
of  the  elevator  shaft?  And  if  there  had  been  no  demolition,  would
plaintiff’s property have been hurt? Once actual causation is satisﬁed,
however,  the  court  has  to  address  the  challenged  requirement  of
proximate  or  legal  causation.  This  court  employed  the  substantial
factor  test  as  its  primary  test  for  proximate  cause.  How  does  the
court  analyze  the  three  considerations  under  Restatement  (Second)
§433  in  concluding  as  a  matter  of  law  that  Gross’s  negligence  was
not a proximate cause of the plaintiff’s harm?

2. Commingling  of  Tests.   If  this  choice  of  three  different  tests  is
not  confusing  enough,  be  forewarned  that  there  are  some  courts  in
some  jurisdictions  that  use  more  than  one  test  for  proximate  cause
at the same time. In such jurisdictions, for example ones that require
that  a  cause  be  both  a  foreseeable  cause  of  the  harm  and  a
substantial  factor  in  bringing  about  the  harm,  would  having  to  clear
more than one proximate cause hurdle be something that would tend
to favor plaintiffs or defendants? Recall who has the burden of proof
on this issue.

3.  Restatement  (Third)  View.   The  relatively  recent  Restatement
(Third) states a preference for what’s referred to as a “risk standard”
test  for  proximate  cause:  “An  actor’s  liability  is  limited  to  those
physical  harms  that  result  from  the  risks  that  made  the  actor’s
conduct  tortious.”  §29  (2011).  Comment  d  to  §29  further  indicates
that  the  test  is  designed  to  prevent  the  imposition  of  liability  by
“conﬁning liability’s scope to the reasons for holding the actor liable in
the  ﬁrst  place.”  If  you  think  this  sounds  an  awful  lot  like  the
foreseeability  test  for  proximate  cause,  you  are  not  alone.  This  is
acknowledged in the drafts of the Third Restatement:

Properly  understood,  both  the  risk  standard  and  a  foreseeability
test exclude liability for harms that were sufﬁciently unforeseeable
at  the  time  of  the  actor’s  tortious  conduct  that  they  were  not
among  the  risks — potential  harms — that  made  the  actor
negligent. . . . [W]hen scope of liability arises in a negligence case,
the  risks  that  make  an  actor  negligent  are  limited  to  foreseeable
ones, and the factﬁnder must determine whether the type of harm
that  occurred  is  among  those  reasonably  foreseeable  potential
harms that made the actor’s conduct negligent.

§29,  cmt.  j  (2011).  Thus,  despite  the  change  in  semantics,  the  Third
Restatement  has  in  reality  simply  indicated  a  preference  for  the
traditional foreseeability test for proximate cause.

4. Problem.  Again, as a bit of review of the different tests we have
seen  for  proximate  cause,  how  would  proximate  cause  be  analyzed
jurisdictions  utilizing  as  their
in
using  the  facts  from  Thorne
proximate  cause  test,  (a)  the  direct  cause  test;  and  (b)  the
foreseeability  test?  Does  one  test  seem  to  be  easier  to  resolve  in  a
rather  deﬁnitive  manner  than  the  other  test?  What  does  this  say
about the beneﬁts or weaknesses about each of these tests?

E. Superseding vs. Intervening Causes

In some cases, there is a ﬁnal potential way that the plaintiff’s effort
to prove causation in a negligence claim can be derailed. Even though
a plaintiff has proven that defendant’s negligence was a factual but-
for cause of her harm, and even though the plaintiff has been able to
satisfy  the  jurisdiction’s  test  for  proximate  cause,  defendant  might
still be able to argue that a superseding cause puts a fatal kink in the
chain of causation. A superseding cause is a third party’s intervening
act  (occurring  after  the  defendant’s  negligence)  that  was  not
reasonably  foreseeable  from  the  standpoint  of  the  defendant.  In

Price,  the  court  discusses  and  applies  this  test  for  distinguishing
between  a  mere  intervening  cause  and  a  fatal  superseding  cause.
The McCane-Sondock case involves a court applying this same test
in the context of an intentional crime as the intervening act. In each
case  the  defendant  argues  that  intentional  misconduct  by  a  third
party  that  intervened  should  cut  off  causation.  As  you  read  the
following cases, pay close attention to how this test for superseding
versus  intervening  causes  has  a  different  focal  point  than  the
foreseeability test for proximate cause.

PRICE v. BLAINE KERN ARTISTA, INC.
893 P.2d 367 (Nev. 1995)

          .

injuries  sustained  when  he  was  wearing  a

Appellant Thomas Price ﬁled an action sounding in negligence as
a  result  of
large
manufactured  “head”  and  was  pushed  or  fell  to  the  floor  in  a  Reno
club.  The  district  court  found  that  Price’s  injuries  resulted  from  a
supervening cause and entered summary judgment against him. We
conclude  that  material  factual  issues  precluded  summary  judgment
and therefore reverse.

Thomas  Price  ﬁled  an  action  .  .  .  against  Blaine  Kern  Artista,  Inc.
(“BKA”),  a  Louisiana  corporation  that  manufactures  oversized  masks
in  the  form  of  caricatures  resembling  various  celebrities  and
characters (hereafter “caricature mask”). The caricature mask covers
the entire head of the wearer. Price alleged in his complaint that the
caricature  mask  of  George  Bush  which  he  wore  during  employment
as  an  entertainer  at  Harrah’s  Club  in  Reno  was  defective  due  to  the
absence of a safety harness to support his head and neck under the
heavy  weight.  He  also  alleged  that  his  injury  occurred  when  a
Harrah’s  patron  pushed  him  from  behind,  causing  the  weight  of  the
caricature mask to strain and injure his neck as he fell to the ground.

On  BKA’s  motion  for  summary  judgment,  the  district  court
determined  that  the  patron’s  push  that  precipitated  Price’s  fall
constituted  an  unforeseeable  superseding  cause  absolving  BKA  of
liability.

The focal point of this appeal is whether the unknown assailant’s
push  that  caused  Price  to  fall  to  the  ground  is  an  intervening,
superseding cause of Price’s injuries, insulating BKA from liability. . . .
Price  argues  that  legal  causation  is  a  question  of  fact  to  be
decided by the trier of fact and that an intervening criminal or tortious
act by a third party does not necessarily preclude liability as a matter
of law. In so arguing, however, he concedes (rather improvidently, we
suggest) that BKA, a Louisiana corporation, could not reasonably be
expected to have foreseen an attack on a user of one of its products
by  a  third-party  assailant  in  Reno,  Nevada,  and  relies  exclusively  on
the  prospect  that  a  jury  might  reasonably  infer  that  a  performer
wearing a top-heavy, oversized caricature mask may stumble, trip, be
pushed,  or  become  imbalanced  for  numerous  reasons.  That  same
jury, according to Price, may ﬁnd that BKA proximately caused Price’s
injury  due  to  its  failure  to  equip  the  caricature  mask  of  our  former
President with a safety harness.

BKA  ﬁrst  counters  that  legal  causation,  although  normally  a  jury
issue, may nevertheless be resolved summarily in appropriate cases
when  there  is  no  genuine  issue  of  material  fact  on  the  issue  of
foreseeability.  BKA  next  argues  that  this  is  an  appropriate  case  for
summary  judgment  because,  by  Price’s  own  admission,  the  third-
party attack forming the basis of his complaint was not foreseeable
to BKA, and is thus a superseding cause of Price’s injuries.

Contrary  to  BKA’s  assertions,  we  conclude  for  two  reasons  that
genuine  issues  of  material  fact  remain  with  respect  to  the  issue  of
legal causation.

[W]ith respect to the negligence claim, while it is true that criminal
or tortious third-party conduct typically severs the chain of proximate

intervening

intentional  act

causation  between  a  plaintiff  and  a  defendant,  the  chain  remains
unbroken  when  the  third  party’s
is
reasonably  foreseeable.  Under  the  circumstances  of  this  case,  the
trier of fact could reasonably ﬁnd that BKA should have foreseen the
possibility  or  probability  of  some  sort  of  violent  reaction,  such  as
pushing,  by  intoxicated  or  politically  volatile  persons,  ignited  by  the
sight  of  an  oversized  caricature  of  a  prominent  political  ﬁgure.  We
certainly  cannot  preclude  such  an  inference  as  a  matter  of  law  and
decline to penalize Price for his attorney’s lack of acuity in conceding
this  issue.  Indeed,  while  the  precise  force  that  caused  Price’s  fall  is
uncertain,  shortly  before  the  fall,  an  irate  and  perhaps  somewhat
confused patron of Harrah’s took issue with the bedecked Price over
Bush’s policy on abortion rights.

For  the  reasons  discussed  above,  we  conclude  that  a  genuine
issue  of  material  fact  remains  with  respect  to  the  issue  of  the  legal
and  proximate  cause  of  Price’s  injuries.  Accordingly,  we  reverse  the
district court’s entry of summary judgment and remand for trial.

540 S.W.2d 764 (Tex. App. 1976)

James Roy Emmittee d/b/a Bedford Package Store sued McCane-
Sondock  Protection  Systems,  Inc.  for  negligently  installing  a  burglar
alarm system at his business. After a jury trial, judgment was entered
awarding  Emmittee  $6,839  damages.  McCane-Sondock  appeals.  We
afﬁrm.

Appellant argues in ﬁve points of error there was no evidence [or
legally insufﬁcient evidence] to support the ﬁnding that it proximately
caused the loss by failing to connect the wires leading from the hold-
up  button  to  the  burglar  alarm  control  panel  and  that  such  ﬁnding

was so against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence
as to be manifestly wrong and unjust.

Appellant argues its action could not be a proximate cause of the
loss  suffered  by  Emmittee  because  it  was  the  action  of  some  third
party which caused the loss.

The court in Teer v. J. Weingarten, Inc., 426 S.W.2d 610 (Tex. Civ.

App. — Houston (14th Dist.) 1968, writ ref. n.r.e.) said:

[T]he  Texas  Courts  are  ﬁrmly  committed  to  the  proposition  that  the  issue  of
foreseeability is related to the issue of proximate cause. It is also undoubtedly
true, as a matter of substantive Texas law, that an intervening cause reasonably
foreseeable by the defendant, is not such a new and independent cause as to
break the chain of causation between the defendant’s negligence and the injury
complained of to the extent of relieving the defendant of liability for such injury.
City of Austin v. Schmedes, 154 Tex. 416, 279 S.W.2d 326.

It is established appellant failed to connect the wires leading from
the  hold-up  buttons  to  the  burglar  alarm  control  panel  and  failed  to
test the system after installation of the alarm buttons.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Foreseeable  Intervening  Acts.   As  both  cases  above  illustrate,
intervening third party actions that are reasonably foreseeable do not
interfere  with  legal  causation.  Only  if  the  third-party  conduct  is
unforeseeable  would  it  negate  causation.  The  Price  court  refers  to
such  causes  as  superseding,  while  the  McCane-Sondock  court
refers to them as new and independent. Even though one involves at
least an intentional tort (a battery) and the other criminal misconduct,
neither ends up negating causation. Why would intentional or criminal
misconduct be more likely to satisfy the test for superseding cause?
Why did the factual circumstances in these two cases not follow that
pattern?

2.  Tieder  Revisited.   Recall  the  facts  from  the  case  of  Tieder,
involving the crushed college student at the University of Miami. The
appellate  court  found  that  there  was  potentially  proximate  cause
against  the  owner  and  architect  who  designed  the  defective  wall
utilizing  the  foreseeability  test  of  proximate  cause.  Should  the
defendants  in  that  case  have  raised  the  defense  of  superseding
cause instead? If defendants had raised that defense, how should the
court rule?

3. Medical Malpractice as Superseding Cause.  Sometimes there is
an intervening act by a medical doctor who is attempting to treat the
plaintiff’s  initial  injury.  In  this  scenario,  the  intervening  act  being
analyzed  comes  after  the  plaintiff’s  initial  injury  and  serves  to
aggravate  those  injuries.  What  if  the  doctor  commits  medical
malpractice  and  this  aggravates  the  initial  injury  caused  by  the
defendant?  Does  the  act  by  the  doctor  constitute  an  unforeseeable
intervening act — a superseding cause — so that the defendant is not
liable for the exacerbation of the injury? Courts typically treat this as a
fact  question.  But  generally  courts  hold  that  the  mere  fact  that  the
doctor’s treatment fell below the duty of care does not necessarily cut
off  or  reduce  the  defendant’s  liability  because  a  doctor’s  negligence
can be foreseeable:

Generally,  medical  treatment  sought  by  an  injured  person  is
considered  a  normal  consequence  of  the  tortfeasor’s  conduct.  A
defendant  will  be  liable  for  the  adverse  results  of  medical
treatment  unless  the  treatment  is  extraordinary  or  the  harm  is
outside the risks incident to the medical treatment.

Weems v. Hy-Vee Food Stores, Inc., 526 N.W.2d 571 (Iowa App. 1994);
Corbett v. Weisband, 551 A.2d 1059 (Pa. App. Ct. 1988) (ﬁnding that
even a doctor’s undisputed negligent treatment was not necessarily a
superseding cause because the “issue is whether his negligence was
‘highly extraordinary.’” Id. at 1075).

4.  Car  Thief’s  Accident  as  Superseding  Cause.   A  very  interesting
scenario  that  has  been  litigated  in  many  courts  involves  a  car  thief
causing a trafﬁc accident shortly after stealing the car. As you might
imagine, the thief might be difﬁcult to either sue or to collect from on
a  judgment.  In  many  instances,  the  aggrieved  plaintiff  sues  instead
the  owner  of  the  stolen  vehicle  arguing  that  their  negligence  (e.g.,
leaving  the  keys  in  the  unlocked  vehicle)  was  a  legal  cause  of  the
accident.  The  defendant  owners  have  often  raised  the  issue  of

superseding  cause.  Most  courts  have  been  friendly  toward  this
defense,  citing  either  no  duty,  no  proximate  cause,  or  superseding
cause as the reason to deny recovery:

[A]  substantial  number  of  courts  have  not  held  owners  liable  for
leaving the keys in their unattended vehicles and for the injuries to
third  persons  as  a  result  of  the  thefts  and  subsequent  negligent
operation  of  those  vehicles.  Those  courts  have  concluded  either
that an owner owes no duty to the general public to guard against
the  risk  of  a  thief’s  negligent  operation  of  a  vehicle  .  .  .  ;  that  the
theft and subsequent negligence of the thief could not reasonably
be foreseen by the owner . . . ; or . . . because the thief’s actions
constituted an independent, intervening cause.

McClenahan  v.  Cooley,  806  S.W.2d  767,  773  (Tenn.  1991)  (quoting
Prosser  and  Keeton,  The  Law  of  Torts,  §44  (5th  ed.  1984)).  The
Cooley court said the issue should be analyzed as one of intervening
versus  superseding  cause.  It  concluded  that,  at  least  when  the
accident  happens  shortly  after  the  theft,  there  is  a  jury  question  on
whether  the  actions  of  the  thief  could  be  reasonably  foreseeable.  It
refused to afﬁrm summary judgment for the car owner. In Chapter 6,
Special Duty Rules, we will see this same scenario in Moody v. Delta
Western  (introducing  the  ﬁreﬁghter  rule,  but  not  discussing  the
proximate cause dilemma).

5.  Superseding  Causes  in  a  Direct  Cause  Jurisdiction.   At  least
when a court’s primary test for proximate cause is the foreseeability
or  substantial  factor  test,  there  is  no  conceptual  problem  with  the
ﬁnal,  additional  application  of  the  superseding  cause  test — it  is
analysis  that  is  not  redundant.  But  would  it  make  any  sense  in  a
direct  cause  jurisdiction  to  consider  whether  an  intervening  act  is  a
superseding  cause?  After  all,  any  independent,  intervening  act  by  a
third party negates proximate causation anyway. Asked another way,
in a direct cause jurisdiction would the alarm company defendant in

McClane-Sondock  necessarily  win?  Do  you  see  any  room  for
argument  by  the  plaintiff  in  a  direct  cause  case  to  hold  the  alarm
company  liable  as  the  legal  cause  of  its  harm?  Consider  the
indispensible  relationship  between  the  alarm  company’s  negligent
conduct and the ability of the burglar to commit his intentional act of
stealing  from  the  plaintiff.  Do  you  see  how  one  appears  to  be
dependent  on  the  other,  rather  than  constituting  an  independent
intervening act?

Upon Further Review

The  law  of  torts  could  dispense  with  the  complexities  of
proximate cause if we were prepared to dispense justice with no
concern for fairness. We could hold people liable for remote acts
of  negligence  that  caused  unforeseeable  ripples  around  the
world decades after the fact. The only limitation on liability would
be  the  courts’  ability  to  perceive  but-for  causation.  But  there
seems to be universal agreement that this is untenable when we
are dealing with accidental injuries. So the trick becomes ﬁnding
a way to articulate at what point we draw a line in the sand and
say,  “no  more.”  As  Judge  Andrews  observed  in  his  famous
dissent in Palsgraf, “[w]e may regret that the line was drawn just
where it was, but drawn somewhere it had to be. . . . The words
we  used  were  simply
indicative  of  our  notions  of  public
policy. . . .”

Most courts choose between one of three tests for proximate
cause,  with
test  of
the  prevailing  view  preferring
foreseeability.  After  considering  the  foreseeable  scope  of  harm
in  determining  whether  a  defendant’s  conduct  is  careless,  we
then  ask  whether  the  nature  of  the  accident  is  what  we  feared
might happen all along. If so, then proximate cause exists even
though all of the precise details might not have been foreseen. In

the

days  past,  the  direct  test  was  more  in  fashion,  though  it  is  still
used  even  today  at  times.  Unlike  the  foreseeability  test,  which
focuses  upon  whether  the  nature  of  the  ﬁnal  accident  was
foreseeable,  the  direct  test  focuses  instead  upon  whether  any
independent,  intervening  acts  broke  the  chain  of  causation —
foreseeability is not relevant to this analysis. Finally, some courts
have adopted the substantial factor test, which considers issues
of  time,  the  number  of  other  factors,  and  to  what  extent  the
defendant’s carelessness unleashed a force still active when the
plaintiff  was  harmed.  Particularly
foreseeability  and
substantial  factor  jurisdictions,  even  if  the  applicable  test  is
satisﬁed, in appropriate cases the defendant might still prevail by
proving that an unforeseeable intervening act has made it unfair
to impose liability on the defendant.

in

When  all  three  tests  are  easily  satisﬁed,  there  likely  is  not  a
very  signiﬁcant  proximate  cause  issue  in  the  case;  this  is  very
common.  But  when  application  of  different  proximate  cause
tests  yields  different  conclusions,  this  is  indicative  of  a  very
serious proximate cause challenge to the plaintiff’s ability to hold
the  negligent  actor  liable.  Considerable  attention — whether  on
your  torts  ﬁnal  or  in  handling  a  lawsuit — is  likely  warranted  on
the matter. Whether proximate cause truly is the “ultimate issue”
in a torts case likely varies with the circumstances of each case.
But mastering the subject is highly useful.

Pulling It All Together

Wheels,  Inc.  is  a  manufacturer  of  automobile  tires  and  rims.  It
supplies  tires  and  rims  in  large  quantities  to  Fjord  Motors,  a
Norwegian automobile manufacturer. To save money and boost
proﬁts,  Wheels  laid  off  all  of  its  quality  control  inspectors  at  its
manufacturing  facility.  As  a  result,  certain  units  of  a  particular
model  rim  were  shipped  to  Fjord  despite  hairline  cracks  that
were  too  small  to  be  seen  by  the  unaided  eye,  but  could  have

has the x-ray equipment and used to have a policy to inspect by
x-ray  each  rim  before  it  was  shipped,  but  this  practice  had  to
stop  due  to  the  layoffs.  Fjord  was  not  told  of  this  change  in
practice,  was  unaware  of  the  hairline  cracks  in  the  rims,  and

Juan was a new purchaser of one of the Fjords that received
a defective wheel rim. He was headed to the ofﬁce, speeding at
an  excessive  rate  on  the  interstate  freeway  one  sunny  morning
when  the  crack  on  his  rim  suddenly  caused  a  complete  wheel
failure  and  his  wheel  came  off  the  Fjord.  Because  he  was
running  late,  rather  than  try  to  pull  to  the  side,  he  gripped  the
steering  wheel  hard,  maintained  his  speed,  and  tried  to  keep
going.  But  his  efforts  to  control  the  car  were  in  vain  and  a  few
seconds  later  he  completely  lost  control  of  his  Fjord.  As  he
swerved from his lane of trafﬁc, another car (driven by Roxanne)
tried  to  pass  him  rather  than  slowing.  As  a  result,  Juan  and
Roxanne ran into each other, and they both spun out of control,

coming  to  a  stop  in  the  middle  lane  of  the  freeway,  blocking
much  of  the  trafﬁc  behind  them.  Roxanne  was  only  mildly  hurt,
but  the  delay  occasioned  by  the  crash  caused  her  to  miss  an
important business meeting and she was ﬁred from her job later
that  day.  One  of  the  vehicles  coming  up  behind  the  accident
scene  a  few  minutes  later  was  a  truck  ﬁlled  with  frozen  meats.
The driver of the truck, Frank, was distracted while texting on his
cellphone and failed to notice the stoppage on the freeway. As a
result,  Frank  crashed  into  the  back  of  another  car  that  had  just
come to a stop ahead of him due to the crash between Juan and
Roxanne.  This  caused  signiﬁcant  property  damage  to  the  car.
The truck was also disabled because the front-end damage hurt
its engine. The truck was stalled for hours due to both the engine
problems and the delays the public authorities had in cleaning up
the  damaged  vehicles  belonging  to  Juan  and  Roxanne.  Also,
because  the  engine  was  not  running  on  the  truck,  the
refrigeration  unit  was  shut  down  and  the  entire  shipment  of
frozen meat thawed and was ruined.

I  INTRODUCTION

Thus  far,  we  have  been  assuming  that  there  is  always  a  duty  of
reasonable care. We spent time reviewing the character traits of the
reasonable  person,  to  what  extent  this  reasonable  person  took  on
certain attributes of the actor in question, and how the circumstances
of the accident were factored into the analysis. All the while, we have
implicitly  assumed  that  a  duty  of  reasonable  care  existed.  This
chapter  will  reexamine  that  assumption,  because  it  turns  out  that
such a duty is not nearly as omnipresent as this assumption. We will
begin  with  the  traditional  dichotomy  between  a  person’s  acts  and  a
person’s  omissions.  This  will  create  certain  default  positions  on  the
issue of the existence of a duty. We will also cover exceptions to such
default  positions.  Beyond  that,  this  chapter  will  address  certain
recurring  factual  situations  where  tort  law  has  determined  whether,
and  to  what  extent,  a  particular  duty  of  care  will  exist.  Often  the
circumstance  of  special  relationships  among  the  parties,  the  nature
of the activity, the nature of the harm, and the status of the victim and
the  defendant  actor  influence  this  determination.  Not  only  will  you
become  familiar  with  these  special  duty  rules,  but  you  will  also  gain
some insight into how courts go about fashioning these rules of law.

A very fundamental proposition
in  negligence
the
presumption  that  when  we  act
we have to act with reasonable
care.  Implicit  within  this  black
letter law is the rather startling
corollary
that  we  do  not
generally  have  an  obligation  to
act,  even  though  refusing  to
come to the aid of an imperiled
person  may
seem  most
unreasonable and uncivilized, if
not  downright  monstrous.  If
this  bothers  you,  you  can  take
some  comfort  in  the  fact  that
tort law does impose a general
duty of care on all of us to take
reasonable  care  when  we  do
choose
to  undertake  some
activity.  When  we  drive  a  car
we must do so carefully. When
we  go  hunting  we  must
exercise  care.  When  we  mow
our  lawn  the  obligation  to  act
with  care  is  established.  But
failing to drive our car, or mow
our  lawn,  or  go  hunting  does  not  generally  make  us  negligent
regardless  of  the  circumstances.  If  we  do  not  have  an  obligation  to
rescue others, we will see that when we do undertake to lend a hand,

we  are  obligated  to  act  with  reasonable  care.  A  related  doctrine,
however,  establishes  that  if  an  actor  has  caused  a  situation  of  peril
for  another  and  we  inject  ourselves  into  the  perilous  situation  as  a
rescuer, the law also imposes the same duty of care on that original
actor toward us — the rescue doctrine. After exploring the parameters
of  the  right  to  remain  inactive,  and  the  obligation  to  exercise  care
when acting, we will delve into the rescue doctrine and a special no-
duty rule that often precludes public emergency actors from suing to
recover for their own injuries during a rescue.

A. Acts vs. Omissions

The Yania case that follows is a classic case concerning the lack of a
duty  to  act  to  come  to  the  aid  of  another.  This  fundamental  rule  of
law  is  something  many  law  students  ﬁnd  shocking.  The  Lawter
decision  immediately  thereafter  illustrates  the  limits  of  this  no-duty
rule. Finally, in Lundy, we will begin to see some cracks in the wall of
this legal dichotomy. As it turns out, when some special relationship
exists between the parties, the Yania rule of law is modiﬁed to create
a duty of care otherwise absent.

1. No General Duty to Aid Others

YANIA v. BIGAN
155 A.2d 343 (Pa. 1959)

     , J.

A  bizarre  and  most  unusual  circumstance  provides

the

background of this appeal.

On September 25, 1957 John E. Bigan was engaged in a coal strip-
mining  operation  in  Shade  Township,  Somerset  County.  On  the
property being stripped were large cuts or trenches created by Bigan
when  he  removed  the  earthen  overburden  for  the  purpose  of
removing the coal underneath. One cut contained water 8 to 10 feet
in  depth  with  side  walls  or  embankments  16  to  18  feet  in  height;  at
this cut Bigan had installed a pump to remove the water.

At approximately 4 p.m. on that date, Joseph F. Yania, the operator
of  another  coal  strip-mining  operation,  and  one  Boyd  M.  Ross  went
upon  Bigan’s  property  for  the  purpose  of  discussing  a  business
matter with Bigan, and, while there, were asked by Bigan to aid him in
starting the pump. Ross and Bigan entered the cut and stood at the
point where the pump was located. Yania stood at the top of one of
the cut’s side walls and then jumped from the side wall — a height of
16 to 18 feet — into the water and was drowned.

Yania’s widow, in her own right and on behalf of her three children,
instituted  wrongful  death  and  survival  actions  against  Bigan
contending Bigan was responsible for Yania’s death. [Bigan demurred
to the complaint and the trial court dismissed the complaint. Plaintiff
has appealed this dismissal.]

Summarized, Bigan stands charged with three-fold negligence: (1)
by  urging,  enticing,  taunting  and  inveigling  Yania  to  jump  into  the
water;  (2)  by  failing  to  warn  Yania  of  a  dangerous  condition  on  the
land, i.e., the cut wherein lay 8 to 10 feet of water; (3) by failing to go
to Yania’s rescue after he had jumped into the water.

Our inquiry must be to ascertain whether the well-pleaded facts in
the  complaint,  assumedly  true,  would,  if  shown,  sufﬁce  to  prove
negligent conduct on the part of Bigan.

Appellant  initially  contends  that  Yania’s  descent  from  the  high
embankment  into  the  water  and  the  resulting  death  were  caused
“entirely” by the spoken words and blandishments of Bigan delivered
at  a  distance  from  Yania.  The  complaint  does  not  allege  that  Yania

slipped  or  that  he  was  pushed  or  that  Bigan  made  any  physical
impact upon Yania. On the contrary, the only inference deducible from
the facts alleged in the complaint is that Bigan, by the employment of
cajolery  and  inveiglement,  caused  such  a  mental  impact  on  Yania
that the latter was deprived of his volition and freedom of choice and
placed under a compulsion to jump into the water. Had Yania been a
child  of  tender  years  or  a  person  mentally  deﬁcient  then  it  is
conceivable that taunting and enticement could constitute actionable
negligence  if  it  resulted  in  harm.  However  to  contend  that  such
conduct  directed  to  an  adult  in  full  possession  of  all  his  mental
is  not  only  without
faculties  constitutes  actionable  negligence
precedent but completely without merit.

Principles

Dietrich Bonhoeffer

“Silence in the face of evil is evil
itself. To not speak is to speak;
to not act is to act.”

The  only  condition  on
land  which  could
Bigan’s
possibly  have  contributed
in
any  manner  to  Yania’s  death
was the water-ﬁlled cut with its
high  embankment.  Of
this
condition  there  was  neither
concealment  nor
to
warn,  but,  on  the  contrary,  the
complaint speciﬁcally avers that Bigan not only requested Yania and
Boyd to assist him in starting the pump to remove the water from the
cut  but  “led”  them  to  the  cut  itself.  If  this  cut  possessed  any
potentiality of danger, such a condition was as obvious and apparent
to  Yania  as  to  Bigan,  both  coal  strip-mine  operators.  Under  the
circumstances  herein  depicted  Bigan  could  not  be  held  liable  in  this
respect.

failure

Lastly, it is urged that Bigan failed to take the necessary steps to
rescue Yania from the water. The mere fact that Bigan saw Yania in a
position of peril in the water imposed upon him no legal, although a
moral, obligation or duty to go to his rescue unless Bigan was legally
responsible,  in  whole  or  in  part,  for  placing  Yania  in  the  perilous

position: Restatement, Torts, §314. Cf: Restatement, Torts, §322. The
language  of  this  Court  in  Brown v. French,  104  Pa.  604,  607,  608,  is
apt:

If  it  appeared  that  the  deceased,  by  his  own  carelessness,
contributed in any degree to the accident which caused the loss of
his life, the defendants ought not to have been held to answer for
the consequences resulting from that accident. . . . He voluntarily
placed himself in the way of danger, and his death was the result
of  his  own  act.  .  .  .  That  his  undertaking  was  an  exceedingly
reckless  and  dangerous  one,  the  event  proves,  but  there  was  no
one  to  blame  for  it  but  himself.  He  had  the  right  to  try  the
experiment,  obviously  dangerous  as  it  was,  but  then  also  upon
him rested the consequences of that experiment, and upon no one
else;  he  may  have  been,  and  probably  was,  ignorant  of  the  risk
which  he  was  taking  upon  himself,  or  knowing  it,  and  trusting  to
his own skill, he may have regarded it as easily superable. But in
either case, the result of his ignorance, or of his mistake, must rest
with himself — and cannot be charged to the defendants.

The complaint does not aver any facts which impose upon Bigan
legal responsibility for placing Yania in the dangerous position in the
water and, absent such legal responsibility, the law imposes on Bigan
no duty of rescue.

Recognizing  that  the  deceased  Yania  is  entitled  to  the  beneﬁt  of
the  presumption  that  he  was  exercising  due  care  and  extending  to
appellant the beneﬁt of every well pleaded fact in this complaint and
the  fair  inferences  arising  therefrom,  yet  we  can  reach  but  one
conclusion:  that  Yania,  a  reasonable  and  prudent  adult  in  full
possession  of  all  his  mental  faculties,  undertook  to  perform  an  act
which he knew or should have known was attended with more or less
peril  and  it  was  the  performance  of  that  act  and  not  any  conduct
upon Bigan’s part which caused his unfortunate death.

2. When Acting, the Duty of Care Exists

UNITED STATES v. LAWTER
219 F.2d 559 (5th Cir. 1955)

        , J.

[T]he  suit  was  for  damages  for  the  death  of  plaintiff’s  wife.  The
claim  was  that  the  death  was  caused  by  the  negligence  of  Coast
Guard personnel in the conduct of a helicopter air-sea rescue.

[On  April  18,  1953,  the  deceased,  Loretta  Jean  Lawter,  her
husband Oren Lawter, his brother Andrew Lawter and his wife, Susan
Lawter, were in a 16-foot skiff in Biscayne Bay, when a wave drowned
out  the  outboard  motor  attached  to  the  skiff  and  further  waves
resulted in the swamping of the boat. As a result, the four passengers
were cast into water approximately 500 yards from the nearest shore.
The water at that particular point was approximately four feet deep.

At  this  time  a  U.S.  Coast  Guard  helicopter  was  making  a  routine
patrol  flight  over  the  Biscayne  Bay  area.  The  flight  by  the  helicopter
was made for the purpose of determining if any vessels or people in
the  area  were  in  the  need  of  aid  or  assistance,  so  that  such  aid  or
assistance could be rendered before darkness set in. The crew of the
helicopter  included  some  who  had  experience  and  training  in  sea
rescues  and  some  completely  lacking  any  such  experience  or
training. The crew spotted the four Lawters in the water. There were
no  boats  or  vessels  nearby  to  rescue  them  and  so  the  crew  of  the
helicopter  proceeded  to  undertake  the  rescue.  The  helicopter  was
equipped  with  a  cable  used  to  raise  someone  from  the  sea.  It  was
supposed  to  be  secured  to  any  rescued  person  prior  to  being  lifted
into the helicopter. On this occasion, an inexperienced member of the
crew  took  charge  of  this  rescue.  The  cable  was  lowered  to  the
decedent but not secured to her. She merely had a hold of it with her

hands.  Before  any  crewmember  could  secure  her,  the  inexperienced
crewmember  began  hoisting  her  into  the  air  toward  the  helicopter.
She was raised until her head and shoulders were above the bottom
of the door in the helicopter, when the cable was stopped. Deceased
had not been raised high enough to be brought into the cabin. Before
the  cable  could  be  raised  further,  she  lost  her  grip  and  fell  to  her
death.]

[The trial court found negligence on the part of the United States.
That court held that a duty was imposed upon respondent to act with
reasonable  care  in  the  performance  of  rescue  operations  once  such
rescue  operations  are  undertaken.  The  court  entered  judgment  for
plaintiff in the sum of $10,000.]

As  appellee  correctly  points  out,  the  case  made  is  not  one  of
omission  or  failure  on  the  part  of  the  Coast  Guard  to  act,  but  of  a
deﬁnite  and  afﬁrmative  act  causing  death,  an  act  deliberately
undertaken and negligently performed by it.

Whatever then might be said of the liability of the United States, if
the  case  had  to  do  with  mere  negligent  omission  or  inaction  of  the
Coast Guard, as was the case in Indian Towing Co. v. United States,
5th Cir., 211 F.2d 886, is not controlling here. For the uncontradicted
evidence  shows  that  the  Coast  Guard,  pursuant  to  long  established
policy,  afﬁrmatively  took  over  the  rescue  mission,  excluding  others
therefrom, and thus not only placed the deceased in a worse position
than  when  it  took  charge,  but  negligently  brought  about  her  death,
and  it  is  hornbook  law  that  under  such  circumstances  the  law
imposes  an  obligation  upon  everyone  who  attempts  to  do  anything,
even  gratuitously,  for  another  not  to  injure  him  by  the  negligent
performance of that which he has undertaken.

The judgment is afﬁrmed.

3. Special Relationships Compelling Action

LUNDY v. ADAMAR OF NEW JERSEY, INC.
34 F.3d 1173 (3d Cir. 1994)

         , J.

Appellant  Sidney  Lundy  suffered  a  heart  attack  while  a  patron  at
appellee’s  casino,  TropWorld  Casino  (“TropWorld”),  in  Atlantic  City,
New  Jersey.  While  he  survived,  Lundy  was  left  with  permanent
disabilities.  Lundy  and  his  wife  here  appeal  from  a  summary
judgment  entered  against  them  by  the  district  court.  Their  appeal
raises [the issue of] what duty, if any, did TropWorld owe under New
Jersey law to provide medical care to Lundy.

The district court held that TropWorld’s duty is, at most, to provide
basic ﬁrst aid to the patron when the need becomes apparent and to
take reasonable steps to procure appropriate medical care. Because
the court found no evidence that TropWorld was negligent in carrying
out  this  duty  to  Lundy,  it  granted  TropWorld’s  motion  for  summary
judgment. We will afﬁrm.

On  August  3,  1989,  Lundy,  a  66-year-old  man  with  a  history  of
coronary  artery  disease,  was  patronizing  TropWorld  Casino.  While
Lundy  was  gambling  at  a  blackjack  table,  he  suffered  cardiac  arrest
and fell to the ground unconscious. Three other patrons quickly ran to
Lundy  and  began  to  assist  him.  The  ﬁrst  to  reach  him  was  Essie
Greenberg (“Ms. Greenberg”), a critical care nurse. Ms. Greenberg was
soon  joined  by  her  husband,  Dr.  Martin  Greenberg  (“Dr.  Greenberg”),
who  is  a  pulmonary  specialist.  The  third  individual  who  aided  Lundy
did not disclose his identity, but he indicated to Dr. Greenberg that he
was a surgeon. During his deposition, Dr. Greenberg stated that, when
he ﬁrst arrived on the scene, Lundy was unresponsive, not breathing,
and without a pulse. Dr. Greenberg testiﬁed that he, his wife, and the
surgeon
cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (“CPR”) on Lundy.

Meanwhile,  the  blackjack  dealer  at  the  table  where  Lundy  had
been gambling pushed an emergency “call” button at his table which
alerted TropWorld’s Security Command Post that a problem existed.

A sergeant in TropWorld’s security force and a TropWorld security
guard arrived at the blackjack table apparently within ﬁfteen seconds
of  their  receiving  the  radio  message  from  the  Security  Command
Post.  The  Greenbergs  and  the  unidentiﬁed  surgeon  were  already
assisting Lundy. Upon arriving, the security guard called the Security
Command Post on her hand-held radio and requested that someone
contact  the  casino  medical  station,  which  was  located  one  floor
above  the  casino.  Several  witnesses  agree  that  Nurse  Margaret
Slusher  (“Nurse  Slusher”),  the  nurse  who  was  on-duty  at  the  casino
medical  station  at  the  time,  arrived  on  the  scene  within  a  minute  or
two  of  being  summoned.  As  soon  as  Nurse  Slusher  arrived,  she
instructed the security guards to call for an ambulance.

Nurse  Slusher  brought  with  her  an  ambu-bag,  oxygen,  and  an
airway. She did not, however, bring an intubation kit to the scene. Dr.
Greenberg testiﬁed that he asked Nurse Slusher for one and she told
him  that  it  was  TropWorld’s  “policy”  not  to  have  an  intubation  kit  on
the premises. Nurse Slusher testiﬁed at her deposition that some of
the  equipment  normally  found  in  an  intubation  kit  was  stocked  in
TropWorld’s medical center, but that she did not bring this equipment
with her because she was not qualiﬁed to use it.

Nurse Slusher proceeded to assist the three patrons in performing
CPR on Lundy. Speciﬁcally, Nurse Slusher placed the ambu-bag over
Lundy’s  face  while  the  others  took  turns  doing  chest  compressions.
The  ambu-bag  was  connected  to  an  oxygen  source.  Dr.  Greenberg
testiﬁed  that  he  was  sure  that  air  was  entering  Lundy’s  respiratory
system and that Lundy was being adequately oxygenated during the
period when he was receiving both CPR treatment and air through the
ambu-bag. Dr. Greenberg went on to say that the only reason he had
requested  an
intubation  kit  was  “to  establish  an  airway  and
subsequently provide oxygen in a more efﬁcient manner.”

Upon the arrival of the EMT unit, a technician, with the help of the
two doctor patrons, attempted to intubate Lundy using an intubation
kit  brought  by  the  EMT  unit.  Dr.  Greenberg  claimed  that,  due  to
Lundy’s  stout  physique  and  rigid  muscle  tone,  it  was  a  very  difﬁcult
intubation,  and  that  there  were  at  least  a  half  dozen  failed  attempts
before  the  procedure  was  successfully  completed.  After  intubation,
Lundy regained a pulse and his color improved.

[By  way  of  granting  a  summary  judgment  motion,  the]  district
court  held  that  TropWorld  had  fulﬁlled  its  duty  to  Lundy  under  New
Jersey  law.  The  court  found  that  TropWorld  had  “immediately
summoned medical attention for Mr. Lundy once it became aware of
his need for it.” Additionally, the court stated that [TropWorld] “fulﬁlled
its  duty  to  aid  injured  patrons  by  having  at  least  a  registered  nurse
available, trained in emergency care, who could immediately size up a
patron’s  medical  situation  and  summon  appropriate  emergency
medical  personnel  and  equipment  by  ambulance  to  respond  to  the
patrons’s (sic) emergency needs.”

Additionally,  the  court  held  that  New  Jersey’s  Good  Samaritan
Statute,  N.J.  Stat.  Ann.  §2A:62A-1  (West  1993),  shielded  TropWorld
and  its  employees  from  liability  for  any  acts  or  omissions  they  took
while rendering care in good faith to Lundy.

The  Lundys  cannot,  and  do  not,  claim  that  TropWorld  was
responsible in any way for Mr. Lundy’s medical emergency. Rather, as
we understand it, the Lundys advance two theories of liability against
TropWorld.  First,  the  relationship  between  a  casino  and  its  patrons
gives rise to a duty to provide medical care, and TropWorld breached
this  duty  when  it  failed  to  have  on-site  the  equipment  and  skilled
personnel  necessary  to  perform  an  intubation.  Second,  TropWorld
breached  a  voluntarily  assumed  duty  by  failing  to  provide  Dr.
Greenberg,  upon  his  request,  with  the  laryngoscope  with  intubation
tube that was available in the medical station.

Generally, a bystander has no duty to provide afﬁrmative aid to an
injured  person,  even  if  the  bystander  has  the  ability  to  help.  See  W.
Page  Keeton  et  al.,  Prosser  and  Keeton  on  the  Law  of  Torts  §56,  at
375 (5th ed. 1984). New Jersey courts have recognized, however, that
the  existence  of  a  relationship  between  the  victim  and  one  in  a
position  to  render  aid  may  create  a  duty  to  render  assistance.  In
Szabo v. Pennsylvania R.R. Co., 132 N.J.L. 331, 40 A.2d 562 (N.J. Err.
& App. 1945), for example, New Jersey’s highest court held that [if an
employee,] while engaged in the work of his or her employer, sustains
an  injury  rendering  him  or  her  helpless  to  provide  for  his  or  her  own
care,  the  employer  must  secure  medical  care  for  the  employee.  If  a
casino owner in New Jersey owes no greater duty to its patrons than
an  employer  owes  its  employees  while  they  are  engaged  in  the
employer’s business, we think it clear that TropWorld did not fail in its
duty to render assistance.

The  Lundys  insist,  however,  that  TropWorld  had  a  duty  beyond
that  recognized  in  Szabo.  They  urge  speciﬁcally  that  the  Supreme
in  the
Court  of  New  Jersey  would  adopt  the  rule  set  forth
Restatement (Second) of Torts §314A (1965). Section 314A states in
pertinent part:

(1)  A  common  carrier  is  under  a  duty  to  its  passengers  to

take reasonable action

(a) to protect them against unreasonable risk of physical

harm, and

(b) to give them ﬁrst aid after it knows or has reason to
know  that  they  are  ill  or  injured,  and  to  care  for  them  until
they can be cared for by others.

(2) An innkeeper is under a similar duty to its guests.
(3)  A  possessor  of  land  who  holds  it  open  to  the  public  is
under  a  similar  duty  to  members  of  the  public  who  enter  in
response to his invitation.

We  think  it  likely  that  the  Supreme  Court  of  New  Jersey  would
accept the principles enunciated in §314A and would apply them in a
case  involving  a  casino  and  one  of  its  patrons.  The  pertinent
commentary  following  §314A
indicates  that  the  duty  “to  take
reasonable  action  .  .  .  to  give  .  .  .  ﬁrst  aid”  in  times  of  emergency
requires  only  that  carriers,  innkeepers  and  landowners  procure
appropriate medical care as soon as the need for such care becomes
apparent  and  provide  such  ﬁrst  aid  prior  to  the  arrival  of  qualiﬁed
assistance as the carrier’s, innkeeper’s or landowner’s employees are
reasonably  capable  of  giving.  Clearly,  the  duty  recognized  in  §314A
does  not  extend  to  providing  all  medical  care  that  the  carrier  or
innkeeper  could  reasonably  foresee  might  be  needed  by  a  patron.
Speciﬁcally, the commentary states:

f.  The  defendant  .  .  .  in  the  case  of  an  ill  or  injured  person  .  .  .  will  seldom  be
required  to  do  more  than  give  such  ﬁrst  aid  as  he  reasonably  can,  and  take
reasonable steps to turn the sick man over to a physician, or to those who will
look after him and see that medical assistance is obtained.

Nurse  Slusher  was  a  registered,  licensed  nurse  who  had  been
trained  in  emergency  care  and  who  had  ﬁfteen  years  of  nursing
experience.  The  uncontradicted  evidence  was  that,  despite  this
training  and  experience,  she  was  not  competent  to  perform  an
intubation. It necessarily follows that the duty which the Lundys insist
the  New  Jersey  Supreme  Court  would  recognize  in  this  case  would
require casinos to provide a full-time on-site staff physician. Certainly,
maintaining  on  a  full-time  basis  the  capability  of  performing  an
intubation goes far beyond any “ﬁrst aid” contemplated by §314A. We
are  conﬁdent  the  New  Jersey  Supreme  Court  would  decline  to
impose  liability  on  TropWorld  for  failing  to  maintain  that  full-time
capability.

The Lundys further claim that, even if there would otherwise be no
duty  to  provide  a  level  of  care  encompassing  intubation,  TropWorld
voluntarily  assumed  a  duty  to  provide  such  care  and  breached  that

duty  by  negligently  failing  to  provide  it.  As  we  understand  the
argument, TropWorld voluntarily assumed this duty in two ways. First,
by  [having]  a  laryngoscope  with  intubation  tube  on  the  premises,
TropWorld voluntarily assumed the duty of having it available for use
on  request.  Second,  by  voluntarily  undertaking  to  assist  Mr.  Lundy,
TropWorld  assumed  a  duty  to  use  due  care  in  providing  that
assistance and breached this duty when Nurse Slusher failed to bring
the laryngoscope with intubation tube to Dr. Greenberg. In connection
with  this  second  argument,  the  Lundys  rely  upon  the  principles
outlined  in  §324  of  the  Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts  which
provides:

One  who,  being  under  no  duty  to  do  so,  takes  charge  of
another  who  is  helpless  adequately  to  aid  or  protect  himself  is
subject to liability to the other for any bodily harm caused to him
by

(a) the failure of the actor to exercise reasonable care to
secure the safety of the other while within the actor’s charge,
or

(b) the actor’s discontinuing his aid or protection, if by so
doing he leaves the other in a worse position than when the
actor took charge of him.

its

As  we  have  indicated,  TropWorld’s  medical  center,  did  have  a
laryngoscope  with
inventory  of
intubation  tube  as  part  of
equipment. Nurse Slusher did not bring this equipment with her when
she  was  summoned  to  Pit  3,  however.  She  brought  only  that
equipment that she was qualiﬁed to use: the ambu-bag, oxygen, and
an airway. At some point after her arrival on the scene, Dr. Greenberg
asked  for  an  intubation  kit.  While  the  Lundys  do  not  expressly  so
state, we understand their contention to be that Nurse Slusher should
have  returned  to  the  medical  center  at  this  point  and  retrieved  the
intubation tube for Dr. Greenberg’s use and TropWorld is liable for her

failure to do so. They suggest that her failure to do so was the result
of  an  ill-considered  TropWorld  policy  that  she  was  not  permitted  to
use intubation equipment.

We reject the notion that TropWorld voluntarily assumed a duty to
Mr. Lundy it would not otherwise have had. The Lundys have referred
us  to  no  New  Jersey  case  law  supporting  this  proposition  and  we
have found none.

The Lundys’ argument based on §324 of the Restatement, ignores
the  fact  that  the  principles  restated  therein  have  been  materially
altered  by  New  Jersey’s  Good  Samaritan  Act,  §2A:  62A-1  N.J.  Stat.
Ann.  That  Act  provides  that  anyone  “who  in  good  faith  renders
emergency  aid  at  the  scene  of  an
.  emergency  to  the
victim . . . shall not be liable for any civil damages as a result of acts
or  omissions  by  such  person  in  rendering  the  emergency  care.”  We
believe  the  Supreme  Court  of  New  Jersey  would  hold  that  this
mandate protects TropWorld from liability in the situation before us.

.

.

The  Lundys  do  not,  and  cannot,  assert  that  there  was  bad  faith
here.  Rather,  they  seek  to  avoid  the  effect  of  New  Jersey’s  Good
Samaritan  Act  by  relying  on  what  is  known  as  the  “preexisting  duty”
exception  to  the  Act.  Under  this  exception,  the  Act  provides  no
immunity from liability if the duty allegedly breached by the volunteer
was  a  duty  that  existed  prior  to  the  voluntary  activity.  E.g.,  Præt  v.
Borough  of  Sayreville,  218  N.J.  Super.  218,  527  A.2d  486  (1987)
(police  ofﬁcers  who  have  a  preexisting  duty  to  render  emergency
assistance to a motorist trapped in a car may be held liable for failing
to  extricate  motorist  and  prevent  ﬁre).  We  do  not  believe  the
preexisting  duty  exception  is  applicable  under  New  Jersey  law  in  a
situation, like the present one, where the preexisting duty is a limited
one  and  the  alleged  negligence  is  the  failure  to  provide  a  level  of
assistance beyond that required by the preexisting duty.

We  think  this  becomes  apparent  when  one  focuses  on  the
purposes  of  the  Good  Samaritan  Act  and  the  preexisting  duty

exception and on the nature of the preexisting duty in this case. The
purpose of the Good Samaritan Act is to encourage the rendering of
assistance to victims by providing that the voluntary rendering of aid
will  not  give  rise  to  any  liability  that  would  not  otherwise  exist.  The
preexisting duty exception recognizes that fulﬁllment of this objective
of  the  statute  can  be  accomplished  without  the  eradication  of
preexisting duties.

Nurse  Slusher  had  no  preexisting  duty  to  Lundy  apart  from  her
role  as  an  employee  of  TropWorld.  Nurse  Slusher,  if  she  had  been  a
fellow  patron,  for  example,  would  have  had  no  preexisting  duty
obligation  and  she  would  have  been  fully  protected  by  the  Good
Samaritan Act. Thus, the only relevant preexisting duty for purposes
of  applying  the  Act  under  New  Jersey  law  is  the  preexisting  duty
owed  by  TropWorld  to  Mr.  Lundy.  That  preexisting  duty,  as  we  have
seen, was a duty limited to summoning aid and, in the interim, taking
reasonable  ﬁrst  aid  measures.  It  did  not  include  the  duty  to  provide
the  medical  equipment  and  personnel  necessary  to  perform  an
intubation.  It  follows,  we  believe,  that  Nurse  Slusher’s  conduct  with
respect  to  the  providing  or  withholding  of  the  intubation  equipment
on  the  premises  was  not  conduct  with  respect  to  which  she  or
TropWorld owed a preexisting duty to Lundy. It further follows that, if
TropWorld  is  responsible  for  the  assistance  voluntarily  provided  by
Nurse Slusher, it is protected by the Act from liability arising from her
alleged  negligence  in  failing  to  provide  that  intubation  equipment.
Accordingly,  we  conclude  that  TropWorld’s  motion  for  summary
judgment was properly granted.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Acts  vs.  Omissions.   Why  does  the  common  law  make  this
distinction  between  acts  and  failures  to  act?  Judge  Cardozo  in
Palsgraf argued that the foreseeable orbit of danger set the contours

for the duty of care. Wasn’t the plaintiff in Yania (who drowned after
jumping  into  the  water)  in  foreseeable  danger?  Did  Dr.  Greenberg,  in
Lundy, have any common law obligation to come to the assistance of
the  ill  gambler?  Regardless  of  how  slight  (or  reasonable)  the  burden
might  be  on  a  bystander  to  come  to  the  rescue  of  another,  and
despite how foreseeable (perhaps inevitable) the harm might be from
inaction,  the  common  law  generally  does  not  obligate  one  to  act.
What is the overriding interest that would preclude such a duty? What
exceptions to this no-duty principle do we see at work or referenced
in the above cases?

2.  Restatement  View  of  a  Duty  to  Act.   Restatement  (Second)  of
Torts §314 (1965) provides: “The fact that the actor realizes or should
realize  that  action  on  his  part  is  necessary  for  another’s  aid  or
protection  does  not  of  itself  impose  upon  him  a  duty  to  take  such
action.”  Illustration  no.  4  to  this  section  provides  this  example:  “A,  a
strong  swimmer,  sees  B,  against  whom  he  entertains  an
unreasonable hatred, floundering in deep water and obviously unable
to  swim.  Knowing  B’s  identity,  he  turns  away.  A  is  not  liable  to  B.”
While  this  is  the  common  law  in  America,  many  European  countries
disagree. Further, there is a small number of northeastern states that
by legislative ﬁat have changed this common law rule and require an
actor with actual knowledge of another’s peril to render aid if such is
possible without exposing the rescuer to danger.

3. Special Relationships Can Create an Obligation to Act.  The court
in  Lundy  references  the  judicial  rulings  requiring  an  employer  to
provide  aid  to  an  injured  employee  on  the  job.  And  the  Restatement
provision quoted in Lundy mentions three other instances where the
default no-duty assumption is rejected — in cases involving common
carriers, innkeepers, and property owners with injured customers. Do
these  groups  have  anything  in  common  that  might  explain  the
exceptional  rule  demanding  that  they  take  some  action  to  assist
others? Two ideas spring to mind. First, that in these relationships the
defendant  seems  to  be  in  a  position  to  proﬁt  in  some  manner  from

the  presence  of  the  plaintiff;  therefore,  imposing  a  duty  of  care
requiring action does not seem unfair. Second, in these scenarios, the
plaintiff  is  generally  put  in  a  position  of  having  to  rely  upon  the
defendant  for  protection.  The  confluence  of  these  two  general
thoughts  seems  to  be  enough  impetus  under  the  common  law  to
overcome  the  no-duty  common  law  rule  and  to  instead  compel
(reasonable) actions.

4. Good  Samaritan  Statutes.   As  the  court  in  Lundy  states,  Good
Samaritan statutes are designed to remove the threat of litigation as
a potential disincentive to assisting gratuitously one in need. One has
to be careful not to treat all such legislation as the same. The way the
statute  is  phrased  can  lead  to  very  different  levels  of  protection.
Consider  the  disparate  levels  of  protection  under  the  following  two
states’ Good Samaritan statutes. With respect to each, who may take
advantage  of  the  statute’s  protection?  What  level  of  immunity  from
common  law  negligence  is  offered?  How  successful  would  you
anticipate  each  statute  being  in  removing  the  chill  arising  from  the
common  law’s  imposition  of  a  duty  of  reasonable  care  upon
rescuers?

5.  Default  Rules  for  Duty.   This  chapter  will  present  many  cases
presenting  special  duty  rules  that  courts  have  crafted  for  particular
recurring  factual  scenarios.  As  the  foregoing  cases
illustrate,
however, the common law generally imposes on actors a duty to act
with reasonable care. In cases of failure to act, the default rule is that
there is no duty to act with reasonable care. The Restatement (Third)
of  Torts  does  a  pretty  good  job  explaining  how  courts  actually
operate consistent with these default positions:

Ordinarily, an actor whose conduct creates risks of physical harm
to  others  has  a  duty  to  exercise  reasonable  care.  Except  in

unusual  categories  of  cases  in  which  courts  have  developed  no-
duty  rules,  an  actor’s  duty  to  exercise  reasonable  care  does  not
require attention from the court.

In Practice

How difﬁcult is it to distinguish
between acts and omissions?
The Restatement urges caution
in this regard: “The distinction
[between acts and omissions]
can be misleading. The proper
question is . . . whether the
actor’s entire conduct created a
risk of harm. [A] failure to
employ an automobile’s
brakes . . . is not a case of
nonfeasance [because] the
entirety of the actor’s conduct
(driving an automobile) created
a risk of harm.”

actors who are not accused of afﬁrmative conduct creating the risk of
harm, no general duty is presumed: “An actor whose conduct has not
created a risk of physical . . . harm to another has no duty of care to
the  other  unless  the  court  determines  that  one  of  the  afﬁrmative
duties [otherwise found] is applicable.”

6. Palsgraf Revisited.  Given this common law dichotomy between
acts  and  omissions,  would  the  law  generally  impose  upon  the
employees  of  the  Long  Island  Railway  an  obligation  to  act  with
reasonable care when they undertake to perform some task? Was the
Long  Island  Railway  accused  of  failing  to  take  action  or  of  taking
some  careless  action?  It  seems  that  the  essence  of  Mrs.  Palsgraf’s
complaint in that case was that when the employees of the defendant
reached  out  and  put  their  hands  upon  the  leaping  passenger,  they
failed  to  exercise  reasonable  care.  While  Judge  Cardozo  said  that
some  foreseeable  harm  particular  to  the  plaintiff  was  necessary  to
trigger  a  duty,  what  does  the  Restatement  provision  quote  above
indicate?  In  fact,  the  Third  Restatement  has  rather  directly  refuted
Cardozo’s contention that the “orbit of danger” sets the duty of care:

A  no-duty  ruling  represents  a  determination,  a  purely  legal
question,  that  no  liability  should  be  imposed  on  actors  in  a
category  of  cases.  These  reasons  .  .  .  do  not  depend  on  the
foreseeability of harm based on the speciﬁc facts of a case. They
should  be  articulated  directly  without  obscuring  references  to
foreseeability.

Restatement  (Third)  of  Torts  §7  cmt.  j  (2011).  Thus,  because  the
Long  Island  Railway  employees  afﬁrmatively  acted  in  a  way  that
created a risk of harm, they presumptively owed Mrs. Palsgraf a duty
of reasonable care, regardless of whether they could foresee danger
to  her  speciﬁcally.  Furthermore,  as  Lundy  notes,  common  carriers
(including  railways)  have  special  relationships  with  their  passengers
that  create  duties  that  would  not  otherwise  even  exist  under  the
common law. The facts of Palsgraf indicate that Mrs. Palsgraf was a
passenger of the defendant waiting for her train to arrive. Given these
considerations,  does  it  now  strike  you  as  odd  that  Judge  Cardozo
chose to deal with the issue of a surprising outcome under the rubric
of duty rather than proximate cause?

7.  Exception  Where  Defendant  Caused  the  Peril.   Another
recognized  exception  to  the  no-duty  to  rescue  rule  is  when  the
defendant  has  wrongfully  created  the  peril  in  the  ﬁrst  instance.  If  a
defendant has caused an accident, he has a duty of reasonable care
to effectuate some rescue or to at least seek help from others. This
can  either  be  understood  as  an  exception  to  the  no-duty  to  rescue
rule or as a mere practical reality of his liability in the ﬁrst instance. If
you  have  wrongfully  caused  an  accident,  you  will  already  be  held
legally responsible for the resulting injuries. If you fail to lessen these
injuries through rescue efforts, you are already liable for the full extent
of the harm by virtue of your tort in causing the accident. It is in your
interest to reduce, or mitigate, the totality of the damages if possible.
Regardless  of  the  theory,  a  tortfeasor  has  every  incentive  to  lessen
his liability by reducing the ultimate harm.

8.  Problems.   Will  a  duty  of  reasonable  care  likely  exist  in  the

following scenarios?

A.  Rodney  is  driving  his  Mustang  when  a  young  girl,  Amanda,
strolls  out  into  an  intersection.  Rodney  has  the  green  light  and
fails  to  apply  his  brakes,  hitting  Amanda  and  causing  serious
injuries.

B.  Jamie  runs  a  printing  shop.  One  afternoon,  a  customer  of  his
trips  and  falls  over  a  pile  of  booklets  left  on  an  aisle  floor.  She
has  a  compound  fracture  and  is  bleeding  profusely.  Jamie
ignores the customer’s injury and gets back to work.

C.  Donald,  who  owns  the  TropWorld  Casino,  is  being  driven  home
from  work  one  January  morning  when  he  sees  a  hungry,
shivering,  homeless  person  by  the  side  of  the  road  with  a  sign
begging for a coat and money for food. He instructs his driver to
speed up so that Donald doesn’t have to look upon the suffering
for  too  long.  The  homeless  man  dies  later  that  evening  from
hunger and exposure to the elements.

D. One late evening in the law school library, Joshua suffers a heart
attack  and  falls  to  the  floor  unconscious.  One  of  his  more

competitive  classmates,  Madeleine,  steps  over  Joshua’s  body
while she returns to her cubicle to get back to work on her torts
outline. Joshua dies.

4. Duty Ends at Expiration of Special Relationship

is  a

relationship, this will overcome the general default rule of no duty to
act with reasonable care to assist another. Presumably Mr. Lundy had
such  a  relationship  with  the  casino  while  he  was  inside  their
business.  The  Restatement  provision  also  references  relationships
between  common  carriers  and  innkeepers  with  regard  to  their
respective  customers.  The  following  case  analyzes  the  duration  of
this special relationship in terms of the issue of duty.

BOYETTE v. TRANS WORLD AIRLINES, INC.
954 S.W.2d 350 (Mo. App. 1997)

         , J.

This  is  an  appeal  by  Patricia  Boyette  (Appellant)  from  the  trial
court’s decision granting summary judgment for Trans World Express
(TWE) in her wrongful death action for the death of her son, Joseph
Rutherford  (Rutherford).  Because  TWE  presented  uncontested  facts
negating  the  element  of  duty,  the  judgment  of  the  trial  court  is
afﬁrmed.

On April 2, 1989, Rutherford and three co-workers took TWE flight
7145 from Memphis, Tennessee to Sioux City, Iowa with a change of
planes  at  Lambert  International  Airport.  Andrea  Lake  (Lake)  was  the
sole flight attendant on this flight. Prior to departure from Memphis,
Rutherford  had  at  least  two  drinks  containing  alcohol.  During  a
ground delay in Memphis, and for the duration of the Memphis to St.
Louis flight, Rutherford consumed six more alcoholic drinks.

Once  TWE  flight  7145  arrived  in  St.  Louis,  Rutherford  deplaned
onto the tarmac with the other passengers. While on the way to the
terminal, Rutherford passed under a yellow rope and climbed onto a
luggage  tug  that  was  idling  on  the  tarmac.  Britney  Callier  (Callier),  a
TWE  gate  agent,  radioed  his  supervisor  and  requested  airport
security. The supervisor contacted airport security at 4:23 p.m. Upon
learning of the dispatch to airport security, Rutherford slid off the tug
and  entered  the  terminal  without  further  incident.  At  4:33  p.m.
Callier’s supervisor contacted airport security and informed them that
their help was no longer needed.

Once inside the terminal Rutherford made his way toward the gate
from  which  his  connecting  flight  was  departing.  On  the  way  to  the
gate, Rutherford stole an electric golf cart and began driving around
the gate area. Callier, who at this point had returned to the terminal to
begin  boarding  passengers  on  another  outbound  flight,  chased
Rutherford on foot in an effort to stop him or to maintain sight of him
until security could be summoned.

Callier  eventually  cornered  Rutherford  in  an  alcove  off  of  the  D
concourse and informed Rutherford’s co-workers that Rutherford was
going  to  jail.  However,  Callier  was  unable  to  locate  Rutherford  in  the
alcove [as Rutherford had escaped to Room D-231, a cleaning room
that had been left unlocked. This room contained a small door leading
to a trash chute that, in turn led to a trash compactor 10 feet below.
Inside  the  compactor  was  an  electric  eye  that,  if  blocked  for  more
than 8 seconds, would begin to compact all “trash” inside].

[In an attempt to evade further detection, Rutherford climbed into
the trash chute.] Rutherford climbed too far into the trash chute and
fell into the trash compactor ten feet below, injuring himself in the fall.
[A  colleague  of  Rutherford’s  informed  TWE  personnel  at  4:51  that
Rutherford had fallen into the trash chute. TWE personnel radioed for
assistance in ﬁnding a shut-off switch for the compactor. Before this
happened, however, TWE personnel heard the compactor start. By the
time they shut it off, Rutherford’s body had been compacted. He was
taken to a hospital and pronounced dead.]

Appellant  ﬁled  a  wrongful  death  action  against  TWE  .  .  .  and
others. In her petition, the appellant claimed TWE acted negligently by
chasing  Rutherford  through  the  concourse  after  he  commandeered
the  golf  cart  and,  once  he  was  discovered  in  the  trash  compactor,
failing  to  take  necessary  steps  to  ensure  Rutherford’s  safety.  On
November  14,  1994,  the  trial  court  granted  TWE’s  motion  for
summary  judgment.  From  this  order  and  judgment,  the  appellant
appeals.

the

trial  court  erred

The  appellant  argues

in  granting
the  .  .  .  motion  for  summary  judgment  on  her  negligence  cause  of
action. It is well-established law that in order to maintain a negligence
cause  of  action  the  appellant  must  establish:  “1)  the  existence  of  a
duty on the part of the defendant to protect [Rutherford] from injury;
2)  a  breach  of  that  duty;  3)  that  defendant’s  breach  proximately
caused [Rutherford’s] injuries.” Krause v. United States Truck Co., Inc.,
787  S.W.2d  708,  710  (Mo.  banc  1990);  Strickland  v.  Taco  Bell  Corp,
849  S.W.2d  127,  131  (Mo.  App.  E.D.  1993).  If  the  appellant  fails  to
show  the  existence  of  a  duty  owed  by  .  .  .  TWE  to  Rutherford,  she
cannot maintain a negligence cause of action.

The  appellant  contends  the  pursuit  of  Rutherford  by  TWE
employees  after  he  commandeered  the  golf  cart  expanded  the
duration  of  the  duty  of  care  TWE,  as  a  common  carrier,  owed  to
Rutherford. We disagree.

Missouri  has

long  recognized  a  special  relationship  exists
between a common carrier, like TWE, and its passengers. “A common
carrier  has  a  duty  to  exercise  the  highest  degree  of  care  to  safely
transport its passengers and protect them while in transit.” Collier v.
Bi-State Dev. Agency, 700 S.W.2d 479, 480 (Mo. App. E.D. 1985). But
this duty exists only so long as the special relationship of passenger
and carrier exists. Meyer v. St. Louis Pub. Serv. Co., 253 S.W.2d 525
(Mo. App. 1952). The carrier discharges its duty once the passenger
reaches  a  reasonably  safe  place.  Sanford  v.  Bi-State  Dev.  Agency,
705 S.W.2d 572 (Mo. App. E.D. 1986). In the instant case it is without
dispute Rutherford safely reached the airport. Thus, TWE fulﬁlled the
duty  it  owed  Rutherford  as  a  common  carrier  once  he  reached  the
airport  terminal.  At  that  point  TWE’s  duty  as  a  common  carrier  was
discharged.  [Whether  a  “reasonably  safe  place”  is  the  tarmac  or  the
terminal matters not in this case.]

At oral arguments the appellant suggested that even if TWE’s duty
as  a  common  carrier  was  discharged  once  Rutherford  reached  the
airport  terminal,  a  new  duty  arose  once  TWE  initiated  pursuit  of
Rutherford.  We  disagree.  [The  court  further  held  that  even  if  a  duty
could be found, there was no proximate cause, as the crushing death
was  too  remote  a  consequence  to  chasing  someone  through  the
airport.]

Because  TWE’s  duty  as  a  common  carrier  was  discharged  once
Rutherford reached the airport terminal and because, even assuming
a new duty arose from Callier’s pursuit, there is no causal connection
between Callier’s pursuit and Rutherford’s death, the trial court’s grant
of summary judgment for TWE is afﬁrmed.

The judgment of the trial court is afﬁrmed.

NOTE

1. Relationship as Basis for Duty.  In Boyette, the court agreed that
the relationship between the common carrier, TWE, and its customer
was  sufﬁcient  to  create  an  obligation  to  act  with  care.  Plaintiff
attempted  to  rely  upon  this  relationship  to  trigger  an  obligation  to
effectuate a rescue with reasonable care. What was wrong with this
theory?  Note  that  even  had  the  court  found  a  duty,  plaintiff  would
have had to demonstrate that TWE failed to take reasonably prudent
measures to make a timely rescue. The facts indicated TWE did make
a  call  for  help  in  an  attempt  to  save  the  plaintiff.  But  the  issue  of
breach  is  not  faced  if  the  court  holds  that  no  duty  of  care  existed.
How is this case different on the issue of duty from Lawter, where the
defendant attempted a rescue, but did so carelessly?

B. Rescuers

Thus  far  we  have  dealt  with  whether  and  when  someone  might  be
obligated to act, notwithstanding the uniquely American common law
rule blessing inaction. Another related special duty rule concerns how
the  common  law  should  treat  the  rescuer  who  becomes  a  victim  in
the course of the rescue. That is, when one chooses to take action to
aid  another,  should  the  law  afford  any  protection  in  the  case  of  the
injured  rescuer?  To  what  extent  does  the  original  tortfeasor — who
created  the  need  for  another’s  rescue — owe  any  duty  toward  the
rescuer?  The  following  cases  present  the  Rescue  Doctrine  and  its
antithesis — the rather alarming Firefighter Rule.

1. The Rescue Doctrine

McCOY v. AMERICAN SUZUKI MOTOR CORP.
961 P.2d 952 (Wash. 1998)

       , J.

Respondent  James  McCoy’s  product

liability  suit  against
petitioners  American  Suzuki  Motor  Corporation  and  Suzuki  Motor
Company,  Ltd.  (Suzuki)  was  dismissed  by  summary  judgment.  The
Court  of  Appeals  reversed  and  reinstated  the  claim.  We  afﬁrm  the
Court of Appeals, but on different grounds, and remand for trial.

The issues are (1) whether the rescue doctrine may be invoked in
a product liability action; (2) whether a plaintiff asserting a claim as a
rescuer  under  the  rescue  doctrine  must  still  prove  his  injuries  were
proximately caused by defendant’s allegedly tortious conduct; and, if
so, (3) whether the alleged fault of this defendant was the proximate
cause of this plaintiff’s injuries.

We  conclude  the  rescue  doctrine  may  be  invoked  in  a  product
liability  action.  We  also  conclude  the  rescuer  must  show  the
defendant’s  wrongdoing  proximately  caused  his  injuries.  Lastly,  we
conclude the question of whether Suzuki proximately caused rescuer
McCoy’s  injuries  is  a  disputed  one  for  the  jury  to  determine  on
remand.

At  5:00  P.M.  on  a  cold  November  evening  James  McCoy  drove
eastbound  on  Interstate  90  outside  Spokane  as  the  car  which
preceded him, a Suzuki Samurai, swerved off the roadway and rolled.
McCoy  stopped  to  render  assistance,  ﬁnding  the  driver  seriously
injured.  Shortly  thereafter  a  Washington  State  Patrol  trooper  arrived
on  the  scene  and  asked  McCoy  to  place  flares  on  the  roadway  to
warn  approaching  vehicles.  McCoy  did  so,  but  concerned  the  flares
were insufﬁcient, continued further and positioned himself a quarter-
mile  from  the  accident  scene  with  a  lit  flare  in  each  hand,  manually
directing trafﬁc to the inside lane.

By  6:50  P.M.,  almost  two  hours  after  the  accident,  the  injured
driver and passenger of the Suzuki were removed and the scene was
cleared, leaving only the trooper and McCoy on the roadway. McCoy
walked back on the shoulder of the roadway to his car with a lit flare

in  his  roadside  hand.  When  McCoy  was  within  three  or  four  car-
lengths  of  the  trooper,  the  trooper  pulled  away  without  comment.
Moments later McCoy was struck from behind while still walking on
the roadway’s shoulder by a hit-and-run vehicle.

McCoy and his wife ﬁled a multicount complaint against [various
defendants,  including  the  driver  of  the  Suzuki  and  the  State  of
Washington  as  well  as  against]  American  Suzuki  Motor  Corporation
and  its  parent  corporation,  Suzuki  Motor  Company,  Ltd.,  for  its
allegedly  defective  Samurai  which  allegedly  caused  the  wreck  in  the
ﬁrst place. We presently consider only McCoy’s claim against Suzuki.
McCoy alleged the Suzuki Samurai was defectively designed and
manufactured,  was  not  reasonably  safe  by  virtue  of  its  tendency  to
roll,  and  lacked  proper  warnings.  McCoy  also  alleged  these  defects
caused  the  principal  accident,  that  he  was  injured  while  a  rescuer
within  the  purview  of  the  “rescue  doctrine,”  and  Suzuki  should
therefore be held liable for his injuries.

Suzuki  moved  for  summary  judgment  asserting:  (1)  the  rescue
doctrine  does  not  apply  to  product  liability  actions;  and  (2)  even  if  it
does, McCoy must still, but cannot, prove Suzuki proximately caused
his  injuries.  The  trial  court  found  the  rescue  doctrine  applies  to
product  liability  actions  but  concluded  any  alleged  defect  in  the
Suzuki  was  not  the  proximate  cause  of  McCoy’s  injuries  and,
accordingly, granted summary judgment of dismissal.

McCoy  appealed  the  dismissal  to  the  Court  of  Appeals  which
reversed in a published, split decision. The appellate court found the
rescue  doctrine  applies  in  product  liability  actions  just  as  it  does  in
negligence actions. The court agreed with the trial court that McCoy’s
injuries were not proximately caused by Suzuki; however, it held under
the rescue doctrine an injured rescuer need not prove the defendant
proximately  caused  his  injuries.  Instead  the  court  concluded  the
rescuer need only prove the defendant proximately caused the danger
and that the rescuer was injured while rescuing.

The  Court  of  Appeals  thus  concluded  McCoy  alleged  sufﬁcient
facts  to  avoid  summary  judgment  of  dismissal  and,  accordingly,
remanded for trial. We granted review.

THE RESCUE DOCTRINE

The rescue doctrine is invoked in tort cases for a variety of purposes
in  a  variety  of  scenarios.  The  doctrine,  as  here  asserted,  allows  an
injured  rescuer  to  sue  the  party  which  caused  the  danger  requiring
the  rescue
in  the  ﬁrst  place.  As  Justice  Cardozo  succinctly
summarized,  the  heart  of  this  doctrine  is  the  notion  that  “danger
invites rescue.” Wagner v. International Ry. Co., 232 N.Y. 176, 133 N.E.
437, 437, 19 A.L.R. 1 (1921). This doctrine serves two functions. First,
it informs a tortfeasor it is foreseeable a rescuer will come to the aid
of the person imperiled by the tortfeasor’s actions, and, therefore, the
tortfeasor  owes  the  rescuer  a  duty  similar  to  the  duty  he  owes  the
imperils.  Second,  the  rescue  doctrine  negates  the
person  he
presumption  that  the  rescuer  assumed  the  risk  of  injury  when  he
knowingly  undertook  the  dangerous  rescue,  so  long  as  he  does  not
act rashly or recklessly.

To  achieve  rescuer  status  one  must  demonstrate:  (1)  the
defendant was negligent to the person rescued and such negligence
caused the peril or appearance of peril to the person rescued; (2) the
peril  or  appearance  of  peril  was  imminent;  (3)  a  reasonably  prudent
person  would  have  concluded  such  peril  or  appearance  of  peril
existed; and (4) the rescuer acted with reasonable care in effectuating
the  rescue.  The  Court  of  Appeals  found  McCoy  demonstrated
sufﬁcient facts of rescuer status to put the issue of whether he met
the  four  requirements  .  .  .  to  the  jury.  Suzuki  does  not  question  this
ﬁnding. Nor will we.

DOES THE RESCUE DOCTRINE APPLY IN PRODUCT LIABILITY
ACTIONS?

Suzuki  argues  the  rescue  doctrine  may  not  be  invoked  in  product
liability actions. Suzuki contends the PLA supplants all common law
remedies  and  contends  the  rescue  doctrine  is  nothing  more  than  a
common  law  remedy.  We  disagree.  The  rescue  doctrine  is  not  a
common  law  remedy.  Rather,  it  is  shorthand  for  the  idea  that
rescuers  are  to  be  anticipated  and  is  a  reflection  of  a  societal  value
judgment  that  rescuers  should  not  be  barred  from  bringing  suit  for
knowingly  placing  themselves  in  danger  to  undertake  a  rescue.  We
can  conceive  of  no  reason  why  this  doctrine  should  not  apply  with
equal force when a product manufacturer causes the danger.

MUST PLAINTIFF SHOW PROXIMATE CAUSATION UNDER THE
RESCUE DOCTRINE?

McCoy  argues  the  rescue  doctrine  relieves  the  rescuer-plaintiff  of
proving  the  defendant’s  wrongdoing  proximately  caused  his  injuries.
McCoy  asserts  a  rescuer  may  prevail  in  a  suit  by  showing  the
defendant  proximately  caused  the  danger  and  that,  while  serving  as
rescuer, the plaintiff was injured. The Court of Appeals agreed stating
the  rescue  doctrine  “varies  the  ordinary  rules  of  negligence.”  McCoy,
86 Wn. App. at 110 (citing Solgaard v. Guy F. Atkinson Co., 6 Cal. 3d
361, 491 P.2d 821, 99 Cal. Rptr. 29 (1971)).

The  Court  of  Appeals  erred  on  this  point.  [T]he  rescuer,  like  any
other plaintiff, must still show the defendant proximately caused his
injuries.

Here,  Suzuki  argues,  it  was  totally  unforeseeable  that  a  rescuer
such  as  McCoy  would  be  injured  by  a  third  vehicle  under  these
particular facts and, accordingly, Suzuki asks us to rule in its favor on
this issue as a matter of law. We ﬁnd the issue of foreseeability of the
intervening  cause  is  sufﬁciently  close  that  it  should  be  decided  by  a
jury,  not  the  court.  A  jury  might  consider  the  position  of  the  rescuer,
the  negligence  of  the  oncoming  motorist,  if  any,  and  many  other
factors.

In the present case, if the Suzuki Samurai is found to be defective
the  jury  could  ﬁnd  it  foreseeable  that  the  Suzuki  Samurai  would  roll
and that an approaching car would cause injury to either those in the
Suzuki Samurai or to a rescuer, depending on the speciﬁc facts to be
proved.  We  note  sister
jurisdictions  have  reached  the  same
conclusion under similar facts.

Here, we do not ﬁnd the alleged fault of Suzuki, if proved, to be so
remote  from  these  injuries  that  its  liability  should  be  cut  off  as  a
matter  of  law.  Accordingly,  we  will  not  dismiss  this  case  for  lack  of
legal causation. Instead we remand the case for trial consistent with
this opinion.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Effect of  Rescue  Doctrine.   As  the  court  indicates,  the  Rescue
Doctrine  negates  any  presumption  of  an  assumption  of  the  risk  (a
topic discussed later in Chapter 7 on Afﬁrmative Defenses) and also
informs a tortfeasor that the presence of a rescuer at the scene of an
accident is likely. This legal boost to the foreseeability of a rescuer at
the scene can help (a) remove any doubt about the defendant owing
the rescuer a duty of care (to the extent, like Cardozo, the court might
be  reluctant  to  ﬁnd  such  a  duty),  and  (b)  assist  with  proving
proximate  causation  to  the  extent  that  the  court  is  utilizing  a
foreseeability  test  for  proximate  cause,  or  analyzing  whether  the
actions of the rescuer might constitute a superseding cause.

2.  Proximate  Cause.   The  court  holds  that  the  original  tortfeasor
owes  a  rescuer  the  same  duty  of  care  owed  to  the  original  victim.
However,  even  a  rescuer  invoking  the  Rescue  Doctrine  must  still
prove  proximate  cause.  In  effect,  what  must  the  jury  conclude  was
reasonably foreseeable in order to ﬁnd proximate cause on the facts
of McCoy?

2. The Fireﬁghter Rule

MOODY v. DELTA WESTERN
38 P.3d 1139 (Alaska 2002)

        , J.

The  question  in  this  case  is  whether  the  so-called  Fireﬁghter’s
Rule  applies  in  Alaska.  The  Fireﬁghter’s  Rule  holds  that  ﬁreﬁghters
and  police  ofﬁcers  who  are  injured  may  not  recover  based  on  the
negligent  conduct  that  required  their  presence.  For  public  policy
reasons  we  join  the  overwhelming  majority  of  states  that  have
adopted the rule.

I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS

Joseph  Coolidge,  who  was  highly

The facts of this case are undisputed. On or around July 25, 1996, a
Delta Western employee left a fuel truck owned by Delta Western in a
driveway  in  Dillingham.  The  keys  were  in  the  ignition,  the  door  was
unlocked,  and  the  truck  contained  fuel  and  weighed  over  10,000
pounds.  Delta  Western  had  a  policy  of  removing  the  keys  from  the
ignitions  of  its  trucks.  Delta  Western  enacted  this  policy  because  of
past incidents involving the theft and unauthorized entry of its trucks.
intoxicated,  entered  the
unlocked truck and proceeded to drive around Dillingham. He ran cars
off the road, nearly collided with several vehicles, and drove at speeds
exceeding  seventy  miles  per  hour.  Brent  Moody,  the  chief  of  the
Dillingham Police Department, was one of the ofﬁcers who responded
to the reports of the recklessly driven fuel truck. The driver of the van
in  which  Moody  was  a  passenger  attempted  to  stop  the  truck  after
moving in front of it, but Coolidge rammed the van, throwing Moody
against  the  dashboard  and  windshield.  Moody  suffered  permanent
injuries.

Moody ﬁled suit against Delta Western, alleging that the company
(through  its  employee)  negligently  failed  to  remove  the  truck’s  keys
from  the  ignition.  In  its  amended  answer,  Delta  Western  argued  that
the “Fireﬁghter’s Rule” barred Moody’s cause of action. Delta Western
moved for summary judgment based on its Fireﬁghter’s Rule defense.
The  superior  court  granted  Delta  Western’s  motion,  holding  that  the
Fireﬁghter’s  Rule  bars  police  ofﬁcers  from  recovering  for  injuries
caused  by  the  “negligence  which  creates  the  very  occasion  for  their
engagement.”

Nearly  all  of  the  courts  that  have  considered  whether  or  not  to
adopt the Fireﬁghter’s Rule have in fact adopted it. Only one court [the
Oregon Supreme Court] has rejected it.

Both  [ﬁreﬁghters  and  police  ofﬁcers]  are  paid  to  confront  crises
and allay dangers by an uncircumspect citizenry, a circumstance that
serves  to  distinguish  ﬁreﬁghters  and  police  from  most  other  public
employees.  Citizens  summon  police  and  ﬁreﬁghters  to  confront
danger. Government entities maintain police and ﬁre departments in
anticipation of those inevitable physical perils that burden the human
condition, whereas most public employment posts are created not to
confront  dangers  that  will  arise  but  to  perform  some  other  public
function that may incidentally involve risk.

This

fundamental  concept  rests  on  the  assumption  that
government entities employ ﬁreﬁghters and police ofﬁcers, at least in
part,  to  deal  with  the  hazards  that  may  result  from  their  taxpayers’
own  future  acts  of  negligence.  Exposing  the  negligent  taxpayer  to
liability for having summoned police would impose upon him multiple
burdens for that protection.

Jurisdictions  adopting  the  Fireﬁghter’s  Rule  emphasize
its
narrowness;  the  doctrine  bars  only  recovery  for  the  negligence  that
creates  the  need  for  the  public  safety  ofﬁcer’s  service.  Thus  the
Fireﬁghter’s Rule does not apply to negligent conduct occurring after
the  police  ofﬁcer  or  ﬁreﬁghter  arrives  at  the  scene  or  to  misconduct

other than that which necessitates the ofﬁcer’s presence. [Kreski, 415
N.W.2d 178, 189 (Mich. 1987) (recognizing exceptional cases, such as
those  involving  willful  misconduct,  in  which  courts  have  refused  to
apply ﬁreﬁghter’s rule to bar action).]

Modern courts stress interrelated reasons, based on public policy,
for the rule. The negligent party is said to have no duty to the public
safety ofﬁcer to act without negligence in creating the condition that
necessitates the ofﬁcer’s intervention because the ofﬁcer is employed
by  the  public  to  respond  to  such  conditions  and  receives
compensation and beneﬁts for the risks inherent in such responses.
Requiring  members  of  the  public  to  pay  for  injuries  resulting  from
such  responses  effectively  imposes  a  double  payment  obligation  on
them.  Further,  because  negligence  is  at  the  root  of  many  calls  for
public safety ofﬁcers, allowing recovery would compound the growth
of litigation.

Courts  ﬁnd  an  analogy  in  cases  in  which  a  contractor  is  injured
while  repairing  the  condition  that  necessitated  his  employment.  In
these  cases,  the  owner  is  under  no  duty  to  protect  the  contractor
against  risks  arising  from  the  condition  the  contractor  is  hired  to
repair, and thus is not liable even if the condition was the product of
the owner’s negligence. This “contractor for repairs” exception to the
general  duty  of  reasonable  care  is  grounded  in  necessity  and
fairness.  Property  owners  should  not  be  deterred  by  the  threat  of
liability  to  the  contractor  from  summoning  experts  to  repair  their
property, regardless of why repairs are needed. Further, owners have
paid for the contractor’s expertise at confronting the very danger that
injured him and should not have to pay again if the contractor is then
injured.  The  same  factors  are  found  to  apply  with  respect  to  the
public’s need to call for the services of public safety ofﬁcers.

We  agree  with  the  reasoning  of  the  modern  courts  and  with  the
analogy  to  contractor  cases.  The  Fireﬁghter’s  Rule  reflects  sound
public policy.

We thus conclude that the Fireﬁghter’s Rule applies in Alaska. We
reach this conclusion based on the merits of the rule as accepted by
the overwhelming majority of the courts of our sister states. It follows
that summary judgment was properly granted.

AFFIRMED.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Public  Policy.   The  courts’  refusal  to  recognize  a  duty  of  care
owed  to  public  emergency  personnel — police  and  ﬁreﬁghters —
reflects  a  combination  of  two  identiﬁed  policies.  What  are  these
reasons? And speaking of the policies behind the Firefighter Rule, do
you see any parallel between these and the rationale for the no-duty
rule we encountered in Creasy v. Rusk in Chapter  4  (no  duty  of  care
owed  by  patient  to  his  caregiver
in  nursing  home)?  Effective
advocates  identify  the  policies  behind  the  rules  to  enable  their  best
arguments in cases where there is a lack of clarity regarding a rule’s
application.

2.  Problems.   Would  the  Firefighter  Rule  preclude  the  following

claims?

A. Ofﬁcer Moody ﬁles a tort suit against the thief who broadsided

the van and directly caused his injuries.

B. Ofﬁcer Moody sues Delta Western on the same theory, but he is

an unpaid volunteer police ofﬁcer.

SNELLENBERGER v. RODRIGUEZ
760 S.W.2d 237 (Tex. 1988)

        , J.

This is an appeal in a wrongful death action brought by the heirs
of  Harold  Snellenberger  against  Rosita  Hernandez  Rodriguez.  The

trial court granted a summary judgment for Rodriguez. The court of
appeals  afﬁrmed  the  judgment  of  the  trial  court.  We  afﬁrm  the
judgment of the court of appeals.

On  March  23,  1983,  Rodriguez  drove  her  automobile  over  and
critically
injured  a  small  child.  At  the  time  of  the  accident,
Snellenberger was employed as a police ofﬁcer by the City of Pecos.
When  he  and  another  ofﬁcer  were  notiﬁed  of  the  accident,  they
immediately  proceeded  to  the  scene  in  their  separate  patrol  cars.
Upon  arrival,  the  other  ofﬁcer  administered  CPR  to  the  child,  while
ofﬁcer  Snellenberger  moved  back  the  crowd  of  people  which  had
gathered  at  the  scene.  Included  in  the  crowd  was  the  grief-stricken
mother of the injured child. As ofﬁcer Snellenberger began controlling
the crowd, he suddenly collapsed and later died of a heart attack. His
widow  and  children  brought  this  action  relying  upon  the  rescue
doctrine.

As  a  matter  of  public  policy,  the  rescue  doctrine  supports  the
heroic acts of individuals who rush into danger to rescue others from
imminent peril. This doctrine came into being before the adoption of
comparative negligence in order to relieve the all or nothing effects of
contributory  negligence.  See  Wagner  v.  International  Railway  Co.,
232  N.Y.  176,  133  N.E.  437  (1921);  Kelley  v.  Alexander,  392  S.W.2d
790 (Tex. Civ. App. — San Antonio 1965, writ ref’d n.r.e.).

The court of appeals held that the rescue doctrine was not raised
under the facts of this case because “no perilous situation existed to
invite rescue.” Without ruling on whether this was a proper application
of  the  rescue  doctrine,  we  nonetheless  afﬁrm  the  judgment  of  the
court  of  appeals  because  we  hold,  as  a  matter  of  law,  that  Ofﬁcer
Snellenberger’s  heart  attack  was  not  a  foreseeable  result  of
Rodriguez’s negligence.

The  rescue  doctrine  does  not  dispense  with  the  requirement  of
foreseeability  in  negligence  causes  of  action.  In  establishing  the

requirement of proximate cause in negligence actions, this court has
stated:

[A]  mere  showing  of  negligence  will  not  justify  holding  the  one  guilty  thereof
liable  for  damages.  The  evidence  must  go  further,  and  show  that  such
negligence  was  the  proximate,  and  not  the  remote,  cause  of  the  resulting
injuries. In order for it to be said that an injury proximately resulted from an act
of negligence, the evidence must justify the conclusion that such injury was the
natural  and  probable  result  thereof.  In  order  to  justify  such  a  conclusion,  the
evidence  must  justify  a  ﬁnding  that  the  party  committing  the  negligent  act
ought to have foreseen the consequences thereof in the light of the attendant
circumstances.

Carey  v.  Pure  Distributing  Corporation,  124  S.W.2d  847,  849  (Tex.
1939).

“Foreseeability  means  that  the  actor,  as  a  person  of  ordinary
intelligence,  should  have  anticipated  the  dangers  that  his  negligent
act  created  for  others.”  Nixon  v.  Mr.  Property  Management,  690
S.W.2d at 549-50.

In Freeman v. City of Pasadena, 744 S.W.2d 923, 924 (Tex. 1988)
we  rejected  the  notion  that  the  “due  care/foreseeability  issue  [is]
totally within the jury’s discretion.” We held that as a matter of law it is
not  foreseeable  that  a  stepfather  who  was  not  at  the  scene  of  the
accident would suffer emotional harm from the negligent injury to his
stepson.

The judgment of the court of appeals is afﬁrmed.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Rescue  Doctrine  Does  Not  Ensure  Victory.   Even  though  the
court in Snellenberger is willing to apply the Rescue Doctrine to these
facts,  it  still  holds  that  a  necessary  element — proximate  cause —
cannot be satisﬁed. If the doctrine is supposed to, in part, help bolster
a  plaintiff  rescuer’s  arguments  for  foreseeability,  why  does  the

plaintiff  still  lose?  Why,  as  a  matter  of  law,  isn’t  the  injury  here
reasonably foreseeable even if “danger invites rescue”? Consider how
the  facts  differ  between  Snellenberg  and  McCoy.  If  the  doctrine
informs the tortfeasor of the likely presence of a rescuer at the scene
of  an  accident  caused  by  the  tortfeasor’s  misconduct,  the  courts
seem  to  be  saying  that  the  risk  of  a  secondary  auto  accident  is
reasonably foreseeable while the risk of a heart attack at the scene of
a trafﬁc accident is a seemingly random event that is not reasonably
foreseeable. What these cases illustrate is that the Rescue Doctrine
aids a plaintiff-rescuer by enhancing her foreseeability argument, but
the doctrine has limits and does not guarantee a recovery.

2. Problem.  Given the court’s opinion in Moody, what is the other

fatal flaw with the plaintiff’s attempts to recover in Snellenberger?

Upon Further Review

As we have seen, a primary distinction in negligence cases exists
between a defendant’s acts and a defendant’s omissions. While
either  can  be  the  basis  for  a  negligence  claim,  when  the
defendant  has  acted  in  a  way  that  caused  the  plaintiff’s  injury,
courts normally assume there was a duty of reasonable care, but
assume  no  duty  existed  in  cases  of  omissions.  These  are
general rules that are subject to exceptions. Special relationships
are a primary circumstance that varies this no-duty presumption,
as  we  saw  in  Lundy.  We  have  seen  mention  of  employers,
common carriers, hoteliers, and businesses open to the public as
examples  of  such  relationships  that  vary  the  common  law
blessing  on  inactivity.  With  respect  to  those  who  choose  to
become rescuers, the common law would impose a duty of care
upon them, but Good Samaritan statutes often overcome this —
subject to the language of the particular statute applicable. But
unless  the  rescuer  is  a  ﬁreﬁghter  or  police  ofﬁcer,  the  common

law  generally  makes  it  easier  for  a  rescuer  to  sue  the  original
tortfeasor  by  enhancing  foreseeability  arguments  and  making
clear that the duty that ran toward the original victim also runs to
the rescuer.

III  DUTY TO PROTECT THIRD PARTIES FROM

ANOTHER’S HARM

In  the  prior  section  we  saw  the  default  rule  that  actions  typically
require  due  care,  but  that  inaction  owes  no  duty  of  care.  We  also
encountered  exceptions  to  this  principle  based  upon  a  “special”
relationship  between  the  tortfeasor  and  the  victim — relationships
such  as  employer-employee,  landowner-customer,  common  carrier-
passenger, and innkeeper-guest. Sometimes the victim does not have
any special relationship with the defendant but courts still impose a
duty  to  act  with  reasonable  care.  These  exceptions  involve  factual
scenarios  where  the  tortfeasor  has  a  special  relationship  with  the
one who is the source of the victim’s harm. This can be articulated in
terms of a duty to warn the victim or, at times, a duty to control the
one threatening harm. We will cover two areas where this exceptional
duty  rule  has  been  applied — in  the  context  of  health  care  workers
and employers.

A. Health Care Workers

It  is  clear  that  doctors  owe  a  duty  of  care  toward  their  patients  and
that, even in cases of omissions, the special nature of the relationship
compels  reasonable  conduct.  Later  in  this  chapter  we  will  consider
the special rules applicable to such medical malpractice lawsuits. But
what  about  a  health  care  professional’s  obligation  to  protect  third
parties from harm caused by the patient? In what circumstances can
the relationship between the doctor and patient obligate the doctor to
take  action  to  protect  third  parties  at  risk  of  harm  from  the  patient?
The Emerich and Bradshaw cases below discuss two circumstances
where  the  patient  might  pose  a  risk  of  harm  to  others — when  the

patient  suffers  a  mental  illness  and  has  manifest  a  desire  to  harm
another and when the patient suffers a contagious disease.

EMERICH v. PHILADELPHIA CENTER FOR HUMAN
DEVELOPMENT
720 A.2d 1032 (Pa. 1998)

     , J.

We  granted  allocatur  limited  to  the  issues  of  one,  whether  a
mental  health  professional  has  a  duty  to  warn  a  third  party  of  a
patient’s threat to harm the third party; two, if there is a duty to warn,
the scope thereof; and ﬁnally, whether in this case a judgment on the
pleadings was proper.

This  admittedly  tragic  matter  arises  from  the  murder  of
Appellant’s  decedent,  Teresa  Hausler,  by  her  former  boyfriend,  Gad
Joseph  (“Joseph”).  At  the  time  of  the  murder,  Joseph  was  being
treated  for  mental  illness  and  drug  problems.  Appellant  brought
wrongful death and survival actions against Appellees. Judgment on
the pleadings was granted in favor of Appellees by the trial court and
was afﬁrmed on appeal by the Superior Court.

A  detailed  recitation  of  the  facts  is  necessary  to  analyze  the
complex  and  important  issues  before  us.  The  factual  allegations
raised in Appellant’s complaint, which we must accept as true, are as
follows.

Ms.  Hausler  and  Joseph,  girlfriend  and  boyfriend,  were
cohabitating  in  Philadelphia.  For  a  substantial  period  of  time,  both
Ms. Hausler and Joseph had been receiving mental health treatment
at Appellee Philadelphia Center for Human Development (the “Center”
or “PCHD”). Appellee Anthony Scuderi was a counselor at the Center.

Joseph  was  diagnosed  as  suffering  from,  among  other  illnesses,
post-traumatic  stress  disorder,  drug  and  alcohol  problems,  and

explosive  and  schizo-affective  personality  disorders.  He  also  had  a
history of physically and verbally abusing Ms. Hausler, as well as his
former wife, and a history of other violent propensities. Joseph often
threatened  to  murder  Ms.  Hausler  and  suffered  from  homicidal
ideations.

Several  weeks  prior  to  June  27,  1991,  Ms.  Hausler  ended  her
relationship  with  Joseph,  moved  from  their  Philadelphia  residence,
and  relocated  to  Reading,  Pennsylvania.  Angered  by  Ms.  Hausler’s
decision to terminate their relationship, Joseph had indicated during
several  therapy  sessions  at  the  Center  that  he  wanted  to  harm  Ms.
Hausler.

On  the  morning  of  June  27,  1991,  at  or  about  9:25  a.m.,  Joseph
telephoned  his  counselor,  Mr.  Scuderi,  and  advised  him  that  he  was
going  to  kill  Ms.  Hausler.  Mr.  Scuderi  immediately  scheduled  and
carried  out  a  therapy  session  with  Joseph  at  11:00  that  morning.
During the therapy session, Joseph told Mr. Scuderi that his irritation
with  Ms.  Hausler  was  becoming  worse  because  that  day  she  was
returning  to  their  apartment  to  get  her  clothing,  that  he  was  under
great stress, and that he was going to kill her if he found her removing
her clothing from their residence.

Mr. Scuderi recommended that Joseph voluntarily commit himself
to a psychiatric hospital. Joseph refused; however, he stated that he
was  in  control  and  would  not  hurt  Ms.  Hausler.  At  12:00  p.m.,  the
therapy  session  ended,  and,  as  stated  in  the  complaint,  Joseph  was
permitted to leave the Center “based solely upon his assurances that
he would not harm” Ms. Hausler.

At  12:15  p.m.,  Mr.  Scuderi  received  a  telephone  call  from  Ms.
Hausler  informing  him  that  she  was  in  Philadelphia  en  route  to
retrieve  her  clothing  from  their  apartment,  located  at  6924  Large
Street. Ms. Hausler inquired as to Joseph’s whereabouts. Mr. Scuderi
instructed  Ms.  Hausler  not  to  go  to  the  apartment  and  to  return  to
Reading.

In  what  ultimately  became  a  fatal  decision,  Ms.  Hausler  ignored
Mr.  Scuderi’s  instructions  and  went  to  the  residence  where  she  was
fatally  shot  by  Joseph  at  or  about  12:30  p.m.  Five  minutes  later,
Joseph  telephoned  Mr.  Scuderi  who  in  turn  called  the  police  at  the
instruction of Director Friedrich.

Joseph was subsequently arrested and convicted of the murder of
Ms.  Hausler.  Based  upon  these  facts,  Appellant  ﬁled  [this]  wrongful
death and survival action, alleging that Appellees negligently failed to
properly  warn  Ms.  Hausler,  and  others  including  her  family,  friends
and the police, that Joseph presented a clear and present danger of
harm to her.

The  trial  court  granted  judgment  on  the  pleadings  in  favor  of
Appellees  ﬁnding,  inter  alia,  that  the  duty  of  a  mental  health
professional  to  warn  a  third  party  had  not  yet  been  adopted  in
Pennsylvania, but that even if such a legal duty existed, Mr. Scuderi’s
personal  warning  discharged  that  duty.  The  Superior  Court  afﬁrmed,
reiterating that mental health care providers currently have no duty to
warn a third party of a patient’s violent propensities, and that even if
such a duty existed, Appellant failed to establish a cause of action as
his  decedent  was  killed  when  she  ignored  Mr.  Scuderi’s  warning  not
to go to Joseph’s apartment.

Initially,  we  must  determine  if  in  this  Commonwealth,  a  mental
health  care  professional  owes  a  duty  to  warn  a  third  party  of  a
patient’s threat of harm to that third party, and if so, the scope of such
a  duty.  While  this  precise  issue  is  one  of  ﬁrst  impression  for  this
court, it is an issue which has been considered by a number of state
and  federal  courts  and  has  been  the  subject  of  much  commentary.
Supported  by  the  wisdom  of  decisions  from  other  jurisdictions,  as
well as by analogous decisions by this court and lower court case law
in  this  Commonwealth,  we  determine  that  a  mental  health  care
professional,  under  certain  limited  circumstances,  owes  a  duty  to
warn  a  third  party  of  threats  of  harm  against  that  third  party.
Nevertheless,  we  ﬁnd  that  in  this  case,  judgment  on  the  pleadings

was proper, and thus, we afﬁrm the decision of the learned Superior
Court, albeit, for different reasons.

Under  common  law,  as  a  general  rule,  there  is  no  duty  to  control
the conduct of a third party to protect another from harm. However, a
judicial  exception  to  the  general  rule  has  been  recognized  where  a
defendant stands in some special relationship with either the person
whose  conduct  needs  to  be  controlled  or  in  a  relationship  with  the
intended victim of the conduct, which gives to the intended victim a
right to protection. See, Restatement (Second) of Torts §315 (1965).
Appellant  argues  that  this  exception,  and  thus,  a  duty,  should  be
recognized in Pennsylvania.

Our  analysis  must  begin  with  the  California  Supreme  Court’s
landmark  decision  in  Tarasoff  v.  Regents  of  Univ.  of  California,  551
P.2d 334 (1976), which was the ﬁrst case to ﬁnd that a mental health
professional may have a duty to protect others from possible harm by
their patients. In Tarasoff, a lawsuit was ﬁled against, among others,
psychotherapists  employed  by  the  Regents  of  the  University  of
California  to  recover  for  the  death  of  the  plaintiffs’  daughter,  Tatiana
Tarasoff, who was killed by a psychiatric outpatient.

Two months prior to the killing, the patient had expressly informed
his  therapist  that  he  was  going  to  kill  an  unnamed  girl  (who  was
readily  identiﬁable  as  the  plaintiffs’  daughter)  when  she  returned
home  from  spending  the  summer  in  Brazil.  The  therapist,  with  the
concurrence  of  two  colleagues,  decided  to  commit  the  patient  for
observation.  The  campus  police  detained  the  patient  at  the  oral  and
written  request  of  the  therapist,  but  released  him  after  satisfying
themselves  that  he  was  rational  and  exacting  his  promise  to  stay
away  from  Ms.  Tarasoff.  The  therapist’s  superior  directed  that  no
further action be taken to conﬁne or otherwise restrain the patient. No
one  warned  either  Ms.  Tarasoff  or  her  parents  of  the  patient’s
dangerousness.

After  the  patient  murdered  Ms.  Tarasoff,  her  parents  ﬁled  suit
alleging,  among  other  things,  that  the  therapists  involved  had  failed
either  to  warn  them  of  the  threat  to  their  daughter  or  to  conﬁne  the
patient.

The  California  Supreme  Court,  while  recognizing  the  general  rule
that  a  person  owes  no  duty  to  control  the  conduct  of  another,
determined  that  there  is  an  exception  to  this  general  rule  where  the
defendant stands in a special relationship to either the person whose
conduct needs to be controlled or in a relationship to the foreseeable
victim  of  that  conduct,  citing  Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts  §315-
320.  Applying  that  exception,  the  court  found  that  the  special
relationship  between  the  defendant  therapists  and  the  patient  could
support  afﬁrmative  duties  for  the  beneﬁt  of  third  persons.  Tarasoff,
551 P.2d at 343.

The court made an analogy to cases which have imposed a duty
upon  physicians  to  diagnose  and  warn  about  a  patient’s  contagious
disease  and  concluded  that  “‘by  entering  into  a  doctor-patient
relationship  the  therapist  becomes  sufﬁciently  involved  to  assume
some responsibility for the safety, not only of the patient himself, but
also of any third person whom the doctor knows to be threatened by
the  patient.’”  Id.,  551  P.2d  at  344,  quoting  Fleming  &  Maximov,  The
Patient and His Victim: The Therapist’s Dilemma, 62 Cal. L. Rev. 1025,
1030 (1974).

The  court  also  considered  various  public  policy

interests
determining  that  the  public  interest  in  safety  from  violent  assault
outweighed  countervailing  interests  of  the  conﬁdentiality  of  patient
therapist  communications  and
in  predicting
dangerousness. Id., 551 P.2d at 344-48.

the  difﬁculty

The California Supreme Court ultimately held:

When  a  therapist  determines,  or  pursuant  to  the  standards  of  his  profession
should  determine,  that  his  patient  presents  a  serious  danger  of  violence  to
another, he incurs an obligation to use reasonable care to protect the intended
victim against such danger.

551 P.2d at 340.

Following  Tarasoff,  the  vast  majority  of  courts  that  have
considered the issue have concluded that the relationship between a
mental health care professional and his patient constitutes a special
relationship which imposes upon the professional an afﬁrmative duty
to protect a third party against harm. Thus, the concept of a duty to
protect  by  warning,  albeit  limited  in  certain  circumstances,  has  met
with virtually universal approval.

We  believe  that  the  Tarasoff  decision  and  its  progeny  are
consistent  with,  and  supported  by,  Pennsylvania  case  law  and
properly recognize that pursuant to the special relationship between a
mental  health  professional  and  his  patient,  the  mental  health
professional has a duty to warn a third party of potential harm by his
patient.

Further  supporting  the  concept  of  a  duty  to  warn,  this  court  has
already  recognized  the  existence  of  a  cause  of  action  against  a
physician  favoring  a  third  person  in  the  context  of  contagious
disease, and, thus, has recognized certain legal duties on the part of a
physician to protect another from future harm by a patient.

In  DiMarco  v.  Lynch  Homes-Chester  County,  Inc.,  583  A.2d  422
(1990), this court held that a physician may be liable to a non-patient
third  person  who  is  injured  because  of  his  negligent  treatment  of  a
patient.  In  that  case,  a  physician  misinformed  his  patient,  a  blood
technician who had been accidentally exposed to the communicable
disease, hepatitis B, that if she remained symptom-free for six weeks
she was not infected with the disease. While the patient was told to
refrain  from  sexual  relations  for  six  weeks,  she  abstained  from  sex
with her boyfriend for eight weeks. After eight weeks, when she was
still symptom-free, the patient engaged in sexual relations. Both she
and  her  partner  were  later  diagnosed  with  hepatitis  B.  The  patient’s
boyfriend  brought  an  action  against,  inter  alia,  the  patient’s  doctors
alleging their negligence in not having warned the patient that having

sexual  relations  within  six  months  of  exposure  to  hepatitis  B  could
expose her sexual partner to the disease.

This  court  extended  the  physician’s  duty  to  encompass  third
parties  whose  health  could  be  threatened  by  contact  with  the
diseased patient.

Such  precautions  are  taken  not  to  protect  the  health  of  the
patient, whose well being has already been compromised, rather such
precautions  are  taken  to  safeguard  the  health  of  others.  Thus,  the
duty  of  a  physician  in  such  circumstances  extends  to  those  “within
the foreseeable orbit of risk of harm” (citation omitted). DiMarco, 583
A.2d at 424.

Having found that a physician owes a duty to a non-patient third
party, at least in the context of a contagious disease, we believe that
there  is  no  reason  why  an  analogous  duty  to  warn  should  not  be
recognized  when  the  disease  of  the  patient  is  a  mental  illness  that
may  pose  a  potentially  greater  and  more  immediate  risk  of  severe
harm or death to others. See, Peck, 499 A.2d at 425.

Finally, sound principles of public policy support a duty to warn. It
has been stated by this court that “in determining the existence of a
duty  of  care,  it  must  be  remembered  that  the  concept  of  duty
amounts  to  no  more  than  ‘the  sum  total  of  those  considerations  of
policy which led the law to say that the particular plaintiff is entitled to
protection’  from  the  harm  suffered.”  Mazzagatti  v.  Everingham  By
Everingham, 516 A.2d 672, 678 (1986). Thus, recognition of a duty is
in essence one of policy considerations.

It is axiomatic that important policy considerations exist regarding
the  public’s  interest  in  safety  from  immediate  and  serious,  if  not
deadly,  harm.  Countervailing  policies  regarding  the  treatment  of
mental  health  patients,  speciﬁcally  recognition  of  the  difﬁculty  in
predicting  violent  behavior,
importance  of  conﬁdential
the
communications  between  therapist  and  patient,  and  the  policy  that
patients  be  placed  in  the  least  restrictive  environment  must  be

acknowledged. We believe, however, that the societal interests in the
protection of this Commonwealth’s citizens from harm mandates the
ﬁnding of a duty to warn. Simply stated, it is reasonable to impose a
duty  on  a  mental  health  professional  to  warn  a  third  party  of  an
immediate, known and serious risk of potentially lethal harm. This is
especially  so  considering  the  very  circumscribed  instances  in  which
we  ﬁnd  such  a  duty  to  warn  arises,  which  are  more  fully  discussed
below.

After  consideration  of  the  above,  we  ﬁnd  that  the  special
relationship  between  a  mental  health  professional  and  his  patient
may, in certain circumstances, give rise to an afﬁrmative duty to warn
for the beneﬁt of an intended victim. We ﬁnd, in accord with Tarasoff,
that  a  mental  health  professional  who  determines,  or  under  the
standards  of  the  mental  health  profession,  should  have  determined,
that  his  patient  presents  a  serious  danger  of  violence  to  another,
bears  a  duty  to  exercise  reasonable  care  to  protect  by  warning  the
intended victim against such danger.

Mindful  that  the  treatment  of  mental  illness  is  not  an  exact
science, we emphasize that we hold a mental health professional only
to  the  standard  of  care  of  his  profession,  which  takes  into  account
the uncertainty of such treatment. Thus, we will not require a mental
health  professional  to  be  liable  for  a  patient’s  violent  behavior
because he fails to predict such behavior accurately.

Moreover,  recognizing  the  importance  of  the  therapist-patient
relationship,  the  warning  to  the  intended  victim  should  be  the  least
expansive based upon the circumstances.
As stated by the court in Tarasoff,

We  realize  that  the  open  and  conﬁdential  character  of  psychotherapeutic
dialogue  encourages  patients  to  express  threats  of  violence,  few  of  which  are
ever  executed.  Certainly  a  therapist  should  not  be  encouraged  routinely  to
reveal  such  threats;  such  disclosures  could  seriously  disrupt  the  patient’s
relationship with his therapist and with the person threatened. To the contrary,
the  therapist’s  obligations  to  his  patient  require  that  he  not  disclose  a

conﬁdence unless such disclosure is necessary to avert danger to others, and
even  then  that  he  do  so  discreetly,  and  in  a  fashion  that  would  preserve  the
privacy of his patient to the fullest extent compatible with the prevention of the
threatened danger.

Tarasoff, 551 P.2d at 347.

Having determined that a mental health professional has a duty to
protect  by  warning  a  third  party  of  potential  harm,  we  must  further
consider  under  what  circumstances  such  a  duty  arises.  We  are
extremely  sensitive  to  the  conundrum  a  mental  health  care
professional  faces  regarding  the  competing  concerns  of  productive
therapy,  conﬁdentiality  and  other  aspects  of  the  patient’s  well  being,
as well as an interest in public safety. In light of these valid concerns
and  the  fact  that  the  duty  being  recognized  is  an  exception  to  the
general  rule  that  there  is  no  duty  to  warn  those  endangered  by
another,  we  ﬁnd  that  the  circumstances  in  which  a  duty  to  warn  a
third party arises are extremely limited.

immediate  threat  of  serious  bodily

First, the predicate for a duty to warn is the existence of a speciﬁc
injury  that  has  been
and
communicated  to  the  professional.  We  believe  that  in  light  of  the
relationship  between  a  mental  health  professional  and  patient,  a
relationship in which often vague and imprecise threats are made by
an  agitated  patient  as  a  routine  part  of  the  relationship,  that  only  in
is
those  situations
communicated can a duty to warn be recognized.

in  which  a  speciﬁc  and

immediate  threat

Moreover, the duty to warn will only arise where the threat is made
against  a  speciﬁcally  identiﬁed  or  readily  identiﬁable  victim.  Strong
reasons  support  the  determination  that  the  duty  to  warn  must  have
some limits. We are cognizant of the fact that the nature of therapy
encourages patients to profess threats of violence, few of which are
acted upon. Public disclosure of every generalized threat would vitiate
the  therapist’s  efforts  to  build  a  trusting  relationship  necessary  for
progress.  Moreover,  as  a  practical  matter,  a  mental  health  care

professional would have great difﬁculty in warning the public at large
of a threat against an unidentiﬁed person. Even if possible, warnings
to the general public would “produce a cacophony of warnings that by
reason  of  their  sheer  volume  would  add  little  to  the  effective
protection of the public.” Thompson, 614 P.2d at 735.

Thus,  drawing  on  the  wisdom  of  prior  analysis,  and  common
sense, we believe that a duty to warn arises only where a speciﬁc and
immediate  threat  of  serious  bodily  injury  has  been  conveyed  by  the
patient to the professional regarding a speciﬁcally identiﬁed or readily
identiﬁable victim.

[With  regard  to  Appellees’  argument  about  the  importance  of
conﬁdentiality in the treatment of mental health patients, this] court is
aware  of  the  critical  role  that  conﬁdentiality  plays  in  the  relationship
between  therapist  and  patient,  constituting,  as  one  author  has
described,  the  “sine  qua  non  of  successful  psychiatric  treatment.”
Commonwealth  ex  rel.  Platt  v.  Platt,  266  Pa.  Super.  276,  304,  404
A.2d  410,  425  (1979).  Nevertheless,  we  believe  that  the  protection
against disclosure of conﬁdential information gained in the therapist-
patient relationship does not bar the ﬁnding of a duty to warn.

[S]imply  stated,  regulations  promulgated  by  the  State  Board  of
Psychology,  which  include  a  majority  of  members  with  license  to
practice psychology, recognize an exception in the case of a serious
threat of harm to an identiﬁed or readily identiﬁable person.

Based upon the above, it is clear that the law regarding privileged
communications  between  patient  and  mental  health  care
professional  is  not  violated  by,  and  does  not  prohibit,  a  ﬁnding  of  a
duty on the part of a mental health professional to warn an intended
victim  of  a  patient’s  threats  of  serious  bodily  harm.  As  succinctly
stated  by  the  court  in  Tarasoff,  “The  protective  privilege  ends  where
the public peril begins.” Tarasoff, 551 P.2d at 347.

In summary, we ﬁnd that in Pennsylvania, based upon the special
relationship  between  a  mental  health  professional  and  his  patient,

when  the  patient  has  communicated  to  the  professional  a  speciﬁc
and  immediate  threat  of  serious  bodily  injury  against  a  speciﬁcally
identiﬁed or readily identiﬁable third party and when the professional,
determines,  or  should  determine  under  the  standards  of  the  mental
health  profession,  that  his  patient  presents  a  serious  danger  of
violence  to  the  third  party,  then  the  professional  bears  a  duty  to
exercise reasonable care to protect by warning the third party against
such danger.

Finally  we  must  decide  whether  judgment  on  the  pleadings  was
proper  in  this  case.  Viewing  the  facts  as  averred  in  the  complaint,
with all reasonable inferences therefrom, it is clear that Joseph was a
patient  of  Appellees  and  was  being  treated  by  Appellees  for  mental
illness.  Further,  Joseph  had  a  deﬁnite,  established,  long  term  and
ongoing  relationship  with  the  Center,  and  with  Mr.  Scuderi  in
particular. Thus, sufﬁcient facts were pled to support the existence of
a  special  relationship  between  Appellees  and  Joseph,  while  Joseph
was being treated as an outpatient, which is necessary for the ﬁnding
of a duty to warn.

Moreover,  the  complaint  alleges  that

in  the  course  of  his
treatment, Joseph stated to Mr. Scuderi that if Ms. Hausler came to
his  apartment  that  day,  he  was  going  to  kill  her.  Thus,  Joseph
communicated  a  speciﬁc  and  immediate  threat  of  serious  bodily
harm  against  a  speciﬁcally  identiﬁed  victim.  The  complaint  alleges
that Mr. Scuderi knew or should have known that Joseph was a clear
and  present  danger  of  harm  to  Ms.  Hausler.  Consistent  with  the
decision rendered by the court today, and speciﬁcally, consistent with
the  limitations  regarding  when  a  duty  to  warn  arises,  the  facts  as
stated  in  the  complaint  are  sufﬁcient  to  support  a  ﬁnding  of  the
existence of a duty to warn.

Having  determined  that  the  facts  set  forth  in  the  complaint  are
sufﬁcient to support a ﬁnding of the existence of a duty to warn, we
turn to consider whether the instructions given by Mr. Scuderi to Ms.
Hausler  discharged  any  such  duty.  Both  lower  courts  in  this  matter

found,  and  Appellees  argue,  that  Mr.  Scuderi  discharged  any  duty  to
warn as a matter of law.

While  the  existence  of  a  duty  is  a  question  of  law,  whether  there
has been a neglect of such duty is generally for the jury. However, the
issue of whether an act or a failure to act constitutes negligence may
be removed from consideration by a jury and decided as a matter of
law when the case is free from doubt and there is no possibility that a
reasonable jury could ﬁnd negligence.

Our determination as to whether Appellees breached any duty as
a matter of law is really an inquiry as to whether the instruction given
by  Mr.  Scuderi  was  adequate  to  discharge  a  duty  to  warn.  A  mental
health  care  professional’s  warning  must  be  reasonable  under  the
particular  circumstances.  See  Tarasoff,  551  P.2d  at  345.  This
consideration  of  the  reasonableness  of  the  warning  under  the
circumstances  is  eminently  sound  as  different  warnings,  depending
upon  the  attendant  circumstances  in  each  case,  may  be  given  to
maintain  patient  conﬁdentiality,  and,  at  the  same  time,  to  prevent
serious bodily harm.

Here,  the  facts  as  alleged  in  the  complaint  disclose  that  Joseph
had  physically  and  verbally  abused  Ms.  Hausler  in  the  past  and  had
often threatened to murder her. Thus, Ms. Hausler knew of Joseph’s
history of violent propensities. It was Ms. Hausler who telephoned Mr.
Scuderi  on  the  date  in  question.  She  informed  Mr.  Scuderi  that  she
was en route to pick up her clothing at their apartment and inquired
as  to  the  whereabouts  of  Joseph.  A  reasonable  inference  from  her
telephone  call  and  inquiry  as  to  the  whereabouts  of  Joseph  is  that
Ms. Hausler was concerned for her safety. Mr. Scuderi informed Ms.
Hausler not to go to Joseph’s residence and instructed her to return
to her lodgment in Reading.

After  consideration  of

the
circumstances  surrounding  the  events  of  June  27,  1991,  and  after
consideration  of  Mr.  Scuderi’s  speciﬁc  instructions  designed  to

facts  as  pled

regarding

the

prevent the threatened harm, including the reasonable inferences that
Ms.  Hausler  knew  of  Joseph’s  violent  propensities  and  that  she
telephoned  Mr.  Scuderi  in  concern  for  her  safety,  we  ﬁnd  that
Mr. Scuderi’s warning was reasonable as a matter of law. The warning
was discreet and in accord with preserving the privacy of his patient
to  the  maximum  extent  possible  consistent  with  preventing  the
threatened  harm  to  Ms.  Hausler.  Thus,  Mr.  Scuderi  discharged  any
duty to warn.

While this matter evokes great sympathy, we agree with the lower
courts that after examining the complaint in this case, it is clear that
on the facts averred, as a matter of law, recovery by Appellant is not
possible. Thus, judgment on the pleadings was proper.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Restatement  Source  of  Duty.   The  Restatement  (Second)  of
Torts  recognizes  that  certain  relationships  can  give  rise  to  a  duty  to
use reasonable care to protect victims from third parties:

There is no duty so to control the conduct of a third person as

to prevent him from causing physical harm to another unless

(a)  a  special  relation  exists  between  the  actor  and  the
third person which imposes a duty upon the actor to control
the third person’s conduct, or

(b)  a  special  relation  exists  between  the  actor  and  the

other which gives to the other a right to protection.

Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts  §315  (1965).  Which  of  these
provisions does the court in Emerich rely upon to support its decision
to recognize a new duty? Under the actual facts of that case, would
the other provision also arguably apply?

2. Role of Foreseeability.  Special duty rules are often crafted with
the  concept  of  foreseeability.  In  the  case  of  the  so-called  Tarasoff

rule, there are two essential components of the doctor’s duty of care.
First, the doctor has a special relationship with the patient who is the
source  of  the  harm  to  the  plaintiff.  Absent  this  relationship,  the
common  law  default  rule  of  no  duty  to  act  would  prevail.  Second,
there  is  enhanced  foreseeability  of  harm  to  the  third  party  in
situations  where  the  patient  has  manifest  a  serious  threat  of
immediate harm to a readily identiﬁable victim. Given both the special
relationship  and  the  enhanced  foreseeability,  most  courts  have
determined  that  some  duty  of  care  to  at  least  provide  a  minimal
warning  should  be  recognized,  notwithstanding  the
legitimate
concerns for doctor-patient conﬁdentiality.

3.  Duty  to  Protect  Others  from  Contagious  Diseases.   In  its
its  prior  decisions
in  Emerich  relies  upon
decision,  the  court
recognizing  that  when  a  patient  of  a  medical  professional  has  an
illness  that  is  a  source  of  risk  to  others,  the  doctor  owes  a  duty  of
reasonable care to protect those particularly foreseeable to be at risk
from  the  illness.  Satisfaction  of  this  duty  might  be  accomplished
through some treatment of the patient or through warnings given to
the family members.

4. Tarasoff Rule vs. HIPAA Privacy Rights.  The Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) generally provides
strict rules for maintaining the privacy of patient information. Patients
believing  health  care  providers  have  violated  their  privacy  may  ﬁle  a
complaint  directly  with  the  U.S.  Department  of  Health  and  Human
Services.  How  do  these  privacy  rights  square  with  the  Tarasoff  duty
to  warn  third  parties  about  speciﬁc  threats  of  serious  harm  by  the
patient?  Federal  regulations  offer  many  exceptions  to  these  privacy
rights,  including  in  cases  where  the  health  care  provider  believes  “in
good  faith”  that  the  disclosure  is  “necessary  to  prevent  or  lessen  a
serious and imminent threat to the health or safety of a person or the
public.”  The  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  likewise
issued  a  letter  saying  that  HIPAA  permitted  Tarasoff  warnings  to
protect both patients and third parties.

BRADSHAW v. DANIEL, M.D.
854 S.W.2d 865 (Tenn. 1993)

        , J.

We  granted  this  appeal  to  determine  whether  a  physician  has  a
legal duty to warn a non-patient of the risk of exposure to the source
of  his  patient’s  non-contagious  disease — Rocky  Mountain  Spotted
Fever.  The  trial  court  denied  the  defendant  physician’s  motion  for
summary judgment, but granted an interlocutory appeal on the issue
of the physician’s legal duty. The Court of Appeals limited the record
and held that the facts were insufﬁcient to show that the risk to the
non-patient  of  contracting  Rocky  Mountain  Spotted  Fever  was  such
that a legal duty arose on the part of the physician. We disagree and
conclude, for the reasons stated herein, that the physician had a legal
duty to warn the non-patient of the risk of exposure to the source of
the patient’s non-contagious disease.

On  July  19,  1986,  Elmer  Johns  went  to  the  emergency  room  at
Methodist  Hospital  South  in  Memphis,  Tennessee,  complaining  of
headaches,  muscle  aches,  fever,  and  chills.  He  was  admitted  to  the
hospital under the care and treatment of the defendant, Dr. Chalmers
B. Daniel, Jr. Dr. Daniel ﬁrst saw Johns on July 22, 1986, at which time
he ordered the drug Chloramphenicol, which is the drug of choice for
a person in the latter stages of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. Johns’
condition rapidly deteriorated, and he died the next day, July 23, 1986.
An  autopsy  was  performed,  and  the  Center  for  Disease  Control  in
Atlanta  conclusively  conﬁrmed,  in  late  September  1986,  that  the
cause  of  death  was  Rocky  Mountain  Spotted  fever.  Although  Dr.
Daniel  communicated  with  Elmer  Johns’  wife,  Genevieve,  during
Johns’  treatment,  he  never  advised  her  of  the  risks  of  exposure  to
Rocky  Mountain  Spotted  Fever,  or  that  the  disease  could  have  been
the cause of Johns’ death.

A  week  after  her  husband’s  death,  on  August  1,  1986,  Genevieve
Johns came to the emergency roam of Baptist Memorial Hospital in
Memphis,  Tennessee,  with  similar  symptoms  of  chills,  fever,  mental
disorientation,  nausea,  lung  congestion,  myalgia,  and  swelling  of  the
hands.  She  was  admitted  to  the  hospital  and  treated  for  Rocky
Mountain  Spotted  Fever,  but  she  died  three  days  later,  on  August  4,
1986,  of  that  disease.  It  is  undisputed  that  no  patient-physician
relationship existed between Genevieve Johns and Dr. Daniel.

The plaintiff, William Jerome Bradshaw, is Genevieve Johns’ son.
He ﬁled this suit alleging that the defendant’s negligence in failing to
advise  Genevieve  Johns  that  her  husband  died  of  Rocky  Mountain
Spotted  Fever,  and  in  failing  to  warn  her  of  the  risk  of  exposure,
proximately  caused  her  death.  The  defendant  ﬁled  a  motion  to
dismiss for failure to state a cause of action on the grounds that the
physician  owed  Genevieve  Johns  no  legal  duty  because  of  the
absence of a patient-physician relationship. The trial judge denied the
motion.

The defendant physician argues that he owed his patient’s wife no
legal  duty  because  ﬁrst,  there  was  no  physician-patient  relationship,
and  second,  Rocky  Mountain  Spotted  Fever  is  not  a  contagious
disease  and,  therefore,  there  is  no  duty  to  warn  of  the  risk  of
exposure.

We  begin  our  analysis  by  examining  how  we  determine  when  a
legal duty may be imposed upon one for the beneﬁt of another. While
duty was not part of the early English common law jurisprudence of
tort  liability,  it  has  since  become  an  essential  element  in  negligence
cases.  No  claim  for  negligence  can  succeed  in  the  absence  of  any
one  of  the  following  elements:  (1)  a  duty  of  care  owed  by  the
defendant  to  the  plaintiff;  (2)  conduct  falling  below  the  applicable
standard of care amounting to a breach of that duty; (3) an injury or
loss;  (4)  causation  in  fact;  and  (5)  proximate,  or  legal  cause.  See
McClenahan v. Cooley, 806 S.W.2d 767, 774 (Tenn. 1991).

[T]he  imposition  of  a  legal  duty  reflects  society’s  contemporary
policies  and  social  requirements  concerning  the  right  of  individuals
and the general public to be protected from another’s act or conduct.
Indeed, it has been stated that “‘duty’ is not sacrosanct in itself, but is
only an expression of the sum total of those considerations of policy
which  lead  the  law  to  say  that  the  plaintiff  is  entitled  to  protection.”
Prosser, §53 at 358.

The  defendant  contends  that  the  absence  of  a  physician-patient
relationship  negates  the  existence  of  a  duty  in  this  case.  While  it  is
true  that  a  physician-patient  relationship
is  necessary  to  the
maintenance of a medical malpractice action, it is not necessary for
the  maintenance  of  an  action  based  on  negligence,  and  this  Court
has speciﬁcally recognized that a physician may owe a duty to a non-
patient third party for injuries caused by the physician’s negligence, if
the  injuries  suffered  and  the  manner  in  which  they  occurred  were
reasonably  foreseeable.  Wharton  Transport  Corp.  v.  Bridges,  606
S.W.2d  521,  526  (Tenn.  1980)  (physician  owed  duty  to  third  party
injured by disabled truck driver’s negligence, where the physician was
negligent  both  in  his  physical  examination  and  certiﬁcation  of  the
truck driver for the employer).

Here,  we  are  asked  to  determine  whether  a  physician  has  an
afﬁrmative  duty  to  warn  a  patient’s  family  member  about  the
symptoms and risks of exposure to Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, a
non-contagious disease. Insofar as we are able to determine, there is
no  reported  decision  from  this  or  any  other  jurisdiction  involving
circumstances exactly similar to those presented in this case.

We  begin  by  observing  that  all  persons  have  a  duty  to  use
reasonable  care  to  refrain  from  conduct  that  will  foreseeably  cause
injury  to  others.  See  Doe  v.  Linder,  845  S.W.2d  173  (Tenn.  1992);
Restatement (Second) of Torts §314 (1964).

In determining the existence of a duty, courts have distinguished
between action and inaction. Professor Prosser has commented that

“the  reason  for  the  distinction  may  be  said  to  lie  in  the  fact  that  by
‘misfeasance’  the  defendant  has  created  a  new  risk  of  harm  to  the
plaintiff, while by ‘nonfeasance’ he has at least made his situation no
worse,  and  has  merely  failed  to  beneﬁt  him  by  interfering  in  his
affairs.” Prosser, §56 at 373; Lindsey, supra, 689 S.W.2d at 859.

Because  of  this  reluctance  to  countenance  nonfeasance  as  a
basis of liability, as a general rule, under the common law, one person
owed no afﬁrmative duty to warn those endangered by the conduct of
another.  Prosser,  §56  at  374;  Tarasoff  v.  Regents  of  University  of
California. 551 P.2d 334, 343 (Cal. 1976).

To  mitigate  the  harshness  of  this  rule,  courts  have  carved  out
exceptions for cases in which the defendant stands in some special
relationship to either the person who is the source of the danger, or to
the  person  who  is  foreseeably  at  risk  from  the  danger.  Lindsey,  689
S.W.2d  at  859;  Tarasoff,  551  P.2d  at  343;  Restatement  (Second)  of
Torts §315 (1964). Accordingly,

while  an  actor  is  always  bound  to  prevent  his  acts  from  creating  an
unreasonable  risk  to  others,  he  is  under  the  afﬁrmative  duty  to  act  to  prevent
another  from  sustaining  harm  only  when  certain  socially  recognized  relations
exist which constitute the basis for such legal duty.

Harper & Kime, The Duty to Control the Conduct of Another, 43 Yale
L.J. 886, 887 (1934).

One  of  the  most  widely  known  cases  applying  that  principle  is
Tarasoff,  in  which  the  California  Supreme  Court  held  that  when  a
psychotherapist  determines  or,  pursuant  to  the  standards  of  his
profession,  should  determine  that  his  patient  presents  a  serious
danger of violence to another, the therapist has an afﬁrmative duty to
use  reasonable  care  to  protect  the  intended  victim  against  such
danger, and the duty may require the physician to warn the intended
victim of the danger. 551 P.2d at 340. The special relationship of the
patient to his psychotherapist supported imposition of the afﬁrmative
duty to act for the beneﬁt of third persons.

Decisions of other jurisdictions have employed the same analysis
and held that the relationship of a physician to his patient is sufﬁcient
to  support  the  duty  to  exercise  reasonable  care  to  protect  third
persons  against  foreseeable  risks  emanating  from  a  patient’s
physical  illness.  Speciﬁcally,  other  courts  have  recognized  that
physicians  may  be  liable  to  persons  infected  by  a  patient,  if  the
physician  negligently  fails  to  diagnose  a  contagious  disease,  or
having diagnosed the illness, fails to warn family members or others
who are foreseeably at risk of exposure to the disease. See Gammill
v. United States, 727 F.2d 950, 954 (10th Cir. 1984) (physician may be
found liable for failing to warn a patient’s family, treating attendants,
or  other  persons  likely  to  be  exposed  to  the  patient  of  the  nature  of
the disease and the danger of exposure).

For  example,  in  Hofmann,  an  action  was  brought  against  a
physician  by  a  child  who  had  contracted  tuberculosis  as  a  result  of
the physician’s negligent failure to diagnose the disease in his patient,
the  child’s  father.  Reversing  a  summary  judgment  for  the  physician,
the Florida District Court of Appeals held

that  a  physician  owes  a  duty  to  a  minor  child  who  is  a  member  of  the
immediate family and living with a patient suffering from a contagious disease
to  inform  those  charged  with  the  minor’s  well  being  of  the  nature  of  the
contagious disease and the precautionary steps to be taken to prevent the child
from contracting such disease and that the duty is not negated by the physician
negligently  failing  to  become  aware  of  the  presence  of  such  a  contagious
disease.

241 So. 2d at 753.

Likewise, in Shepard, supra, a wrongful death action was ﬁled by
the mother of a child who was infected and died of spinal meningitis
after  the  physician  failed  to  diagnose  the  disease  in  his  patient,  the
mother.  Again,  reversing  a  summary  judgment  in  favor  of  the
defendant  on  the  issue  of  legal  duty,  the  Michigan  Court  of  Appeals
stated that the

defendant had a physician-patient relationship with plaintiff. This was a special
relationship  with  the  one  who  allegedly  infected  Eric,  leading  to  his  death.  .  .  .
Because  defendant  had  a  special  relationship  with  plaintiff  we  conclude  that
defendant  owed  a  duty  of  reasonable  care  to  Eric.  As  plaintiff’s  son  and  a
member  of  her  household,  Eric  was  a  foreseeable  potential  victim  of
defendant’s conduct.

390 N.W.2d at 241.

Returning to the facts of this case, ﬁrst, it is undisputed that there
was  a  physician-patient  relationship  between  Dr.  Daniel  and  Elmer
Johns.  Second,  here,  as  in  the  contagious  disease  context,  it  is  also
undisputed that Elmer Johns’ wife, who was residing with him, was at
risk of contracting the disease. This is so even though the disease is
not  contagious  in  the  narrow  sense  that  it  can  be  transmitted  from
one  person  to  another.  Both  Dr.  Daniel  and  Dr.  Prater,  the  plaintiff’s
expert, testiﬁed that family members of patients suffering from Rocky
Mountain Spotted Fever are at risk of contracting the disease due to a
phenomenon  called  clustering,  which  is  related  to  the  activity  of
infected  ticks  who  transmit  the  disease  to  humans  Dr.  Prater  also
testiﬁed that Dr. Daniel negligently failed to diagnose the disease and
negligently  failed  to  warn  his  patient’s  wife,  Genevieve  Johns,  of  her
risk of exposure to the source of disease. Dr. Daniel’s expert disputed
these conclusions, but Dr. Daniel conceded there is a medical duty to
inform the family when there is a diagnosis of the disease. Thus, this
case  is  analogous  to  the  Tarasoff  line  of  cases  adopting  a  duty  to
warn  of  danger  and  the  contagious  disease  cases  adopting  a
comparable  duty  to  warn.  Here,  as  in  those  cases,  there  was  a
foreseeable risk of harm to an identiﬁable third party, and the reasons
supporting the recognition of the duty to warn are equally compelling
here.

We, therefore, conclude that the existence of the physician-patient
relationship  is  sufﬁcient  to  impose  upon  a  physician  an  afﬁrmative
duty  to  warn  identiﬁable  third  persons  in  the  patient’s  immediate
family  against  foreseeable  risks  emanating  from  a  patient’s  illness.

Accordingly,  we  hold  that  under  the  factual  circumstances  of  this
case,  viewing  the  evidence  in  a  light  most  favorable  to  the  plaintiff,
the  defendant  physician  had  a  duty  to  warn  his  patient’s  wife  of  the
risk  to  her  of  contracting  Rocky  Mountain  Spotted  Fever,  when  he
knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known, that
his  patient  was  suffering  from  the  disease.  Our  holding  here  is
necessarily  limited  to  the  conclusion  that  the  defendant  physician
owed  Genevieve  Johns  a  legal  duty.  We  express  no  opinion  on  the
other  elements  which  would  be  required  to  establish  a  cause  of
action for common-law negligence in this case.

Accordingly,  the  judgment  of  the  Court  of  Appeals  granting  the
defendant’s  motion  for  summary  judgment  is  reversed,  and  this
cause is remanded to the trial court for proceedings consistent with
this opinion.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Source  of  Duty.   The  court  mentions  the  need  for  the  special
relationship in order to create an afﬁrmative duty to act. What is the
exact special relationship utilized by the court in Bradshaw to create
this  obligation  on  the  part  of  the  doctor?  Is  this  case  analogous  to
Tarasoff  and  the  contagious  disease  cases?  There  is  arguably  less
foreseeability of harm here than in Tarasoff because, in this instance,
there  is  no  threat  of  anyone  intending  to  harm  the  plaintiff.  Further,
can  you  say  in  the  Bradshaw  case  that  the  doctor  had  a  special
relationship  with  the  source  of  the  harm?  Was  this  a  case  with  a
contagious  disease?  If  not,  it  seems  debatable  that  a  duty  of  care
should arise, absent any special relationship between the doctor and
either the victim or the source of the victim’s harm.

2. Problem.  Suppose the plaintiff-decedent in the Bradshaw case
lived in an apartment complex and had many neighbors who used the
same common areas outside. One of those neighbors, a month after

the  events  in  Bradshaw,  gets  infected  from  a  tick  at  the  complex
playground.  Should  the  doctor  treating  the  husband  for  Rocky
Mounted Spotted Fever have had a duty to warn the residents of that
apartment  complex?  If  not,  what  is  the  principle  that  allows  you  to
reject  a  duty  here  but  recognize  one  for  the  plaintiff-decedent  in
Bradshaw?

B. Employer-Employee Relationships

Just as doctor-patient relationships can give rise to duties, not only to
the patient, but also to those at risk from the patient, courts have long
recognized duties owed by employers to protect third parties from the
conduct  of  the  employees.  What  happens  to  this  duty  when  the
employee is “off the clock”? Consider the following case and how the
court approaches the recognition of a duty.

OTIS ENGINEERING CORP. v. CLARK
668 S.W.3d 307 (Tex. 1983)

         , J.

This  is  a  wrongful  death  action  instituted  by  Larry  and  Clifford
Clark  against  Otis  Engineering  Corporation  after  the  Clarks’  wives
were  killed  in  an  automobile  accident  involving  an  Otis  employee,
Robert  Matheson.  At  the  time  of  the  accident  Matheson  was  not  in
the course of his employment. The trial court granted Otis’ motion for
summary judgment. The court of appeals reversed and remanded the
cause  for  trial,  holding  there  were  genuine  issues  of  fact.  We  afﬁrm
the judgment of the court of appeals.

Two questions are presented. First, does the law impose any duty
upon  Otis  under  the  evidence  as  developed?  Secondly,  does  such
evidence give rise to any genuine issues of material fact?

Matheson  worked  the  evening  shift  at  Otis’  Carrollton  plant.  He
had a history of drinking on the job, and was intoxicated on the night
of the accident. At his dinner break that night and on other occasions
that  day  he  went  to  the  parking  lot,  where  he  allegedly  consumed
alcoholic  beverages  in  his  automobile.  Donald  Roy  was  Matheson’s
supervisor and Rennie Pyle was a co-worker who assisted Matheson
on  occasion.  Pyle  testiﬁed  that  he  knew  of  Matheson’s  drinking
problems  and  that  he  told  Roy  on  the  day  of  the  accident  that
Matheson was not acting right, was not coordinated, was slurring his
words, and that “we need to get him off the machines.” David Sartain,
a  fellow  worker,  testiﬁed  that  Matheson  was  either  sick  or  drinking,
was  getting  worse,  “his  complexion  was  blue  and  like  he  was  sick,”
and that he was weaving and bobbing on his stool and about to fall
into  his  machine.  The  supervisor  testiﬁed  that  he  observed
Matheson’s  condition  and  was  aware  that  other  employees  believed
he  should  be  removed  from  the  machine.  When  Matheson  returned
from  his  dinner  break,  Roy  suggested  that  he  should  go  home.  Roy,
as  he  escorted  Matheson  to  the  company’s  parking  lot,  asked  if  he
was all right and if he could make it home, and Matheson answered
that  he  could.  Thirty  minutes  later,  some  three  miles  away  from  the
plant, the fatal accident occurred.

Dr. Charles S. Petty, the medical examiner, testiﬁed that Matheson
had  a  blood  alcohol  content  of  0.268%  which  indicated  he  had
ingested  a  substantial  quantity  of  alcohol,  an  amount  representing
some sixteen to eighteen cocktails if consumed over a period of one
hour, or twenty to twenty-ﬁve cocktails if consumed over a period of
two hours. The doctor stated that persons working around Matheson
would  undoubtedly  have  known  of  his  condition,  expressing  his
opinion that one hundred percent of persons with that much alcohol
exhibit signs of intoxication observable to the average person.

Matheson’s  extreme  state  of  intoxication  was  well  known  to  his
supervisor  and
the
supervisor knew Matheson was in no condition to drive home safely

fellow  workers.  The

testimony

indicated

that  night.  When  some  night  shift  employees  came  to  work  around
10:30  p.m.  and  remarked  there  had  been  an  accident  on  Belt  Line
Road,  Roy  immediately  suspected  Matheson  was  involved.  Roy
testiﬁed  he  feared  Matheson  might  have  an  accident,  knowing  that
Matheson  had  to  drive  on  heavily  traveled  Belt  Line  Road  to  reach
home.  Upon  hearing  of  the  accident,  Roy,  acting  on  a  hunch,
voluntarily went to the police station to see if Matheson was involved.
The  Clarks  contend  that  under  the  facts  in  this  case  Otis  sent
home,  in  the  middle  of  his  shift,  an  employee  whom  it  knew  to  be
intoxicated.  They  aver  this  was  an  afﬁrmative  act  which  imposed  a
duty on Otis to act in a non-negligent manner. Cf. Osuna v. Southern
Pacific  Railroad,  641  S.W.2d  229  (Tex.  1982).  This  action  by  Otis
subjected  Matheson  and  other  motorists  to  the  dangers  of  an
accident on the highway.

The Clarks further contend that Otis maintained a nurses’ station
on the premises for the beneﬁt of ill or disabled employees. Although
Otis provided this facility to aid employees in situations such as this,
the supervisor chose instead to accompany Matheson to the parking
lot  and  send  him  out  on  the  highway,  even  though  he  had  foreseen
the  possibility  of  an  accident.  The  Clarks  likewise  maintain  that  Roy
jury  could  ﬁnd  to  be  more
had  other  alternatives  which  the
reasonable,  such  as  taking  Matheson  to  the  nurses’  station,  giving
him a ride home, or calling a taxi, the police, or Matheson’s wife. The
Clarks  state  that  fact  questions  exist  as  to  whether  Otis  was
negligent  in  sending  Matheson  home  in  an  obviously  intoxicated
condition and whether such negligence was a proximate cause of the
Clarks’ deaths.

Otis’ motion for summary judgment was granted on the basis that
as  a  matter  of  law  Otis  owed  no  duty  to  the  Clarks.  In  order  to
establish tort liability, a plaintiff must initially prove the existence and
breach  of  a  duty  owed  to  him  by  the  defendant.  Abalos  v.  Oil
Development  Co.  of  Texas,  544  S.W.2d  627,  631  (Tex.  1976).  As  a
general  rule,  one  person  is  under  no  duty  to  control  the  conduct  of

another,  Restatement (Second) of  Torts  §315  (1965),  even  if  he  has
the practical ability to exercise such control. Trammell v. Ramey, 329
S.W.2d  153  (Ark.  1959).  Yet,  certain  relationships  do  impose,  as  a
matter  of  law,  certain  duties  upon  parties.  See  e.g.,  Restatement
(Second)  §§316-20.  For  instance,  the  master-servant  relationship
may  give  rise  to  a  duty  on  the  part  of  the  master  to  control  the
conduct of his servants outside the scope of employment. This duty,
however, is a narrow one. Ordinarily, the employer is liable only for the
off-duty  torts  of  his  employees  which  are  committed  on  the
employer’s  premises  or  with  the  employer’s  chattels.  Restatement
(Second) §317.

Though  the  decisional  law  of  this  State  has  yet  to  address  the
precise  issues  presented  by  this  case,  factors  which  should  be
considered in determining whether the law should impose a duty are
the  risk,  foreseeability,  and  likelihood  of  injury  weighed  against  the
social  utility  of  the  actor’s  conduct,  the  magnitude  of  the  burden  of
guarding against the injury and consequences of placing that burden
on the employer. See Robertson v. LeMaster, 301 S.E.2d 563 (W. Va.
1983); Turner v. Grier, 608 P.2d 356 (Colo. 1979).

While a person is generally under no legal duty to come to the aid
of another in distress, he is under a duty to avoid any afﬁrmative act
which might worsen the situation. See W. Prosser, The Law  of  Torts
§56 at 343 (4th ed. 1971). One who voluntarily enters an afﬁrmative
course  of  action  affecting  the  interests  of  another  is  regarded  as
assuming  a  duty  to  act  and  must  do  so  with  reasonable  care.
Colonial Savings Ass’n v. Taylor, 544 S.W.2d 116 (Tex. 1976); Fox v.
Dallas Hotel Co., 240 S.W. 517 (1922); see W. Prosser, supra, §56.
its  conduct  amounted

to
nonfeasance and under established law it owed no duty to the Clarks’
respective  wives.  Otis  further  says  that  by  imposing  liability  for  the
acts  of  its  intoxicated  employee,  this  Court  would  be  judicially
creating “dram shop” liability. We disagree. This is not a “dram shop”
case. If a duty is to be imposed on Otis it would not be based on the

that,  at  worst,

Otis  contends

mere knowledge  of  Matheson’s  intoxication,  but  would  be  based  on
additional factors.

Traditional  tort  analysis  has  long  drawn  a  distinction  between
action  and  inaction  in  deﬁning  the  scope  of  duty.  Dean  Prosser
attributes  this  distinction  to  the  early  common
law  courts’
preoccupation with “more flagrant forms of misbehavior [rather than]
with  one  who  merely  did  nothing,  even  though  another  might  suffer
harm  because  of  his  omission  to  act.”  W.  Prosser,  supra,  at  338.
However,  although  courts  have  been  slow  to  recognize  liability  for
nonfeasance,  “during  the  last  century,  liability  for  ‘nonfeasance’  has
been  extended  still  further  to  a  limited  group  of  relations,  in  which
custom,  public  sentiment  and  views  of  social  policy  have  led  the
courts  to  ﬁnd  a  duty  of  afﬁrmative  action.”  Id.  at  339.  Be  that  as  it
may, we do not view this as a case of employer nonfeasance.

What  we  must  decide  is  if  changing  social  standards  and
increasing  complexities  of  human  relationships  in  today’s  society
justify imposing a duty upon an employer to act reasonably when he
exercises  control  over  his  servants.  Even  though  courts  have  been
reluctant  to  hold  an  employer  liable  for  the  off-duty  torts  of  an
employee, “as between an entirely innocent plaintiff and a defendant
who admittedly has departed from the social standard of conduct, if
only  toward  one  individual,  who  should  bear  the  loss?”  W.  Prosser,
supra,  at  257.  Dean  Prosser  additionally  observed  that  “there  is
nothing sacred about ‘duty,’ which is nothing more than a word, and a
very indeﬁnite one, with which we state our conclusion.” Id.

During  this  year,  we  have  taken  a  step  toward  changing  our
concept of duty in premises cases. In Corbin v. Safeway Stores, Inc.,
648 S.W.2d 292 (Tex. 1983), we held that a store owner has a duty to
guard  against  slips  and  falls  if  he  has  actual  or  constructive
knowledge of a dangerous condition and it is foreseeable a fall would
occur. We now leave to the jury exclusive determination of the matter
if evidence exists that the store owner had the requisite knowledge of
longer  do  we  require
the  dangerous  premises  condition.  No

knowledge of the speciﬁc object. Following Corbin, why should we be
reluctant  to  impose  a  duty  on  Otis?  As  Dean  Prosser  has  observed,
“changing social conditions lead constantly to the recognition of new
duties. No better general statement can be made, than the courts will
ﬁnd a duty where, in general, reasonable men would recognize it and
agree  that  it  exists.”  W.  Prosser, supra,  at  327.  If,  as  Prosser  asserts
should  be  done,  we  change  concepts  of  duty  as  changing  social
conditions  occur,  then  this  case  presents  the  Court  with  the
opportunity  to  conform  our  conception  of  duty  to  what  society
demands.

Several  recent  cases

jurisdictions  have  extended
in  other
concepts of duty in the area of employer liability. In Leppke v. Segura,
632 P.2d 1057 (Colo. App. 1981), a tavern owner refused to serve an
intoxicated  man;  however,  a  tavern  employee  later  jump-started  the
man’s  car.  Subsequently,  the
intoxicated  man  caused  a  fatal
automobile  accident.  The  Colorado  court,  in  reversing  a  summary
judgment, held that the employee’s afﬁrmative action was enough to
raise  an  issue  of  breach  of  duty  even  though  there  was  no
relationship  between  the  defendant  and  the  intoxicated  driver.  Id.  at
1059.

An employer was held liable for injuries sustained by third parties
in  an  accident  caused  by  its  intoxicated  employee  in  Brockett  v.
Kitchen Boyd Motor Co., 264 Cal. App. 2d 69, 70 Cal. Rptr. 136 (1968).
The  employee,  Huff,  became  intoxicated  at  a  Christmas  party  given
by  the  motor  company.  Although  Huff  was  “grossly  intoxicated,”  a
representative  of  the  company  placed  him  in  his  automobile  and
directed him to drive home. The court recognized that the supplying
of  alcohol  does  not  ordinarily  make  the  supplier  liable  to  an  injured
third  party,  but  the  afﬁrmative  acts  of  placing  him  in  his  car  and
directing  him  to  drive  home  imposed  a  duty  on  the  company  to
exercise reasonable care. 70 Cal. Rptr. at 139.

Recently, the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia rendered
its opinion in Robertson v. LeMaster, 301 S.E.2d 563 (W. Va. 1983). In

that  case,  LeMaster’s  employer,  The  Norfolk  and  Western  Railway
Company,  had  required  LeMaster  to  work  twenty-seven  consecutive
hours  to  remove  debris  and  repair  a  track  damaged  by  a  train
derailment. After many complaints by LeMaster that he was tired and
wanted  to  go  home,  LeMaster’s  foreman  permitted  him  to  do  so.
LeMaster  lived  some  ﬁfty  miles  from  his  place  of  work,  and  while
driving  his  own  car  home,  fell  asleep  and  was  involved  in  a  collision
with  Robertson,  causing  injuries  to  Robertson.  The  West  Virginia
court  recognized  that  the  railroad  company  owed  no  duty  to  control
an  employee  acting  outside  of  the  scope  of  employment,  but  stated
that  such  was  not  the  issue  in  the  case,  saying  “rather  it  is  whether
the appellee’s conduct prior to the accident created a foreseeable risk
of  harm.”  Id.  at  567.  The  court  concluded  that  requiring  LeMaster  to
work such long hours and then setting him loose upon the highway in
an obviously exhausted condition was sufﬁcient to sustain a cause of
action  against  the  railroad.  We  are  persuaded  by  the  logic  of  the
holdings in these three cases.

Therefore, the standard of duty that we now adopt for this and all
other cases currently in the judicial process, is: when, because of an
employee’s
incapacity,  an  employer  exercises  control  over  the
employee,  the  employer  has  a  duty  to  take  such  action  as  a
reasonably  prudent  employer  under
the  same  or  similar
circumstances would take to prevent the employee from causing an
unreasonable risk of harm to others. Such a duty may be analogized
to  cases  in  which  a  defendant  can  exercise  some  measure  of
reasonable  control  over  a  dangerous  person  when  there  is  a
recognizable  great  danger  of  harm  to  third  persons.  See,  e.g.,
Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts,  §319;  W.  Prosser,  supra,  at  350.
Additionally,  we  adopt  the  rule  from  cases  in  this  Restatement  area
that the duty of the employer or one who can exercise charge over a
dangerous  person  is  not  an  absolute  duty  to  insure  safety,  but
requires only reasonable care. See Missouri, K. & T. Ry. Co. of Texas

v. Wood, 95 Tex. 223, 66 S.W. 449 (1902); Sylvester v. Northwestern
Hospital of Minneapolis, 236 Minn. 384, 53 N.W.2d 17 (1952).

Therefore, the trier of fact in this case should be left free to decide
whether  Otis  acted  as  a  reasonable  and  prudent  employer
considering  the  following  factors:  the  availability  of  the  nurses’  aid
station,  a  possible  phone  call  to  Mrs.  Matheson,  having  another
employee  drive  Matheson  home,  dismissing  Matheson  early  rather
than terminating his employment, and the foreseeable consequences
of Matheson’s driving upon a public street in his stuporous condition.
As  summary  judgment  proof  clearly  raises  all  of  these  factors
questioning  the  reasonableness  of  Otis’  conduct,  a  fact  issue  is
present and summary judgment was improper.

For these reasons, we afﬁrm the judgment of the court of appeals

and remand to the trial court for determination of the issues.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Employer  Liability  for  Torts  of  Employees.   In  Chapter  9,
Apportionment,  we  will  study  the  doctrine  of  vicarious  liability,  by
which a master is deemed liable based upon its association with an
employee  who  commits  a  tort  during  her  course  and  scope  of
employment.  Such  liability  is  premised  solely  upon  the  fault  of  the
employee  rather  than  any  breach  of  duty  by  the  employer.  One
difﬁculty  the  plaintiffs  faced  in  Otis  was  that  the  tort  of  the  drunk
employee was committed “off the clock.” He had left the course and
scope  of  employment  prior  to  causing  the  accident.  Therefore,
plaintiffs needed to establish negligent conduct by the employer and,
of course, this necessitated a determination that the employer owed
a duty to prevent this accident from occurring.

2.  Duty  to  Control  Others.   The  Restatement  referred  to  by  the
court above acknowledges the many court decisions imposing a duty
upon  certain  actors  to  act  with  reasonable  care  when  they  are

responsible  for  certain  people.  Speciﬁcally,  §§316-318  imposes  a
duty  of  reasonable  care  upon  actors  with  regard  to  their  minor
children,  dangerous  persons  in  their  custody,  employees,  and  those
using their property to conduct certain activities. In view of where and
when  the  trafﬁc  accident  took  place  in  the  foregoing  case,  do  these
provisions  from  the  Restatement  clearly  resolve  the  issue  of  duty  in
the  foregoing  case?  If  the  defendant’s  employee  was  beyond  their
control at the time of the accident, exactly what is the source of the
duty  of  reasonable  care?  Consider  the  dichotomy  presented  at  the
beginning  of  this  chapter  between  malfeasance  and  nonfeasance.
While the defendant may have wanted to portray the plaintiff’s claim
as  alleging  a  failure  to  act,  the  court  takes  the  opposite  view — that
the  defendant,  while  acting  to  remove  a  problem  from  its  own
worksite,  instead  placed  that  danger  on  the  public  roads  of  North
Dallas.

Upon Further Review

Due to special relationships, the common law idea that one does
not  have  an  obligation  to  undertake  action  for  the  protection  of
others ﬁnds an exception. With regard to health care workers, the
law  recognizes  that  the  combination  of  the  special  relationship
between the doctor and the patient can provide an obligation to
act for the beneﬁt of third parties at risk from the patient. When
the  patient  has  transmitted  a  speciﬁc  serious  threat  to
intentionally injure a third party, most courts have recognized at
least  a  duty  to  provide  some  reasonable  warning.  And  in  the
contagious disease context, courts have likewise recognized that
the  patient  presents  a  highly  foreseeable  risk  of  harm  to  other
nearby health care workers and family members, which compels
action  for  their  protection.  The  employer-employee  relationship
likewise  sufﬁcient  to  create  an  obligation  to  supervise
is

employees for the protection of others. This is relatively easy to
recognize  when  the  employee  is  at  work  or  at  least  using
company property (e.g., a company car). But when the employee
is  not  at  work,  ﬁnding  a  source  of  duty  on  the  part  of  the
employer  is  much  more  difﬁcult.  While  the  employee  would  be
liable  for  his  own  torts,  when  does  the  employer  separately
breach a duty? Once the employee departs from work, generally
the  duty  to  supervise  ends.  But  the  careful  and  creative  lawyer
can  sometimes  create  a  persuasive  argument  that,  while  the
consequences  of  the  employer’s  negligence  might  be  manifest
“off  the  clock,”  the  employer  may  have  been  careless  while  the
employee was still under its control. Both the health care and the
employer scenarios involve special relationships and foreseeable
harms to others that combine to change the default no-duty rule
to one requiring action.

IV  DUTY LIMITED BY THE NATURE OF THE

PRIMARY HARM

Thus  far  we  have  encountered  the  tort  dichotomy  between
malfeasance (act) and nonfeasance (failure to act) and seen different
relationships  that  change  the  default  rules  regarding  duty.  In  this
section  we  will  ﬁnd  that  courts  have  doubts  about  whether  certain
duties  of  care  should  exist  to  prevent  certain  types  of  harm  from
being suffered. We will ﬁrst deal with instances where the defendant’s
negligence  causes  no  immediate  physical  consequences  to  the
plaintiff, but instead disturbs his emotional tranquility. This emotional
injury  may  or  may  not  have  secondary  physical  consequences,  but
the  non-physical  accidental  “touching”  of  the  mind  raises  signiﬁcant
concerns for courts. The second area we will introduce is analogous
— where  the  plaintiff  is  not  physically  impacted  in  any  way  by  the
negligence  but  instead  suffers  economic  losses  (i.e.,  lost  proﬁts).
Finally,  we  will  delve  into  an  area  some  courts  say  is  better  left  to
philosophers  and  theologians  rather  than  the  courts.  Entering  the
arena of so-called “wrongful life” claims, we will see how courts react
to plaintiffs who argue that they wished they had never been born and
blame  the  defendant  for  their  existence.  We  will  simultaneously
consider  the  related  claims  for  wrongful  birth  and  wrongful
pregnancy. In each area, think about what it is about the nature of the
claimed harm that causes courts to pause at the question of duty.

A. Emotional Distress

At  common  law,  courts  have  long  permitted  recovery  of  claimed
emotional  injuries  that  are  secondary  to  physical  harms.  When  a
defendant’s  negligence  causes  a  plaintiff  to  lose  a  limb,  there  has
never  been  any  serious  difﬁculty  recognizing  that  plaintiff’s  right  to

recover  for  the  emotional  consequences  of  the  physical  harm.  This
became known as the “Impact Rule” — that so long as some physical
injury has occurred, emotional distress was a recoverable element of
damages.  Eventually  this  rule  of  recovery  became  stretched  enough
so that any physical touching — whether truly harmful or not — could
support  a  claim  for  negligently  inflicted  emotional  distress.  In  the
following  Robb  case,  the  court  recognizes  the  absurdity  of  this  rule
and  transitions  to  a  new  rule  for  recognition  of  negligently  inflicted
emotional  distress — the  “Zone  of  Danger”  rule.  Next,  in  the  Dillon
case, we will see a subsequent court question the wisdom behind the
zone of danger rule and transition to yet another rule — the so-called
“Dillon  rule  of  foreseeability.”  Whether  following  the  impact,  zone  of
danger,  or  Dillon  rules,  each  of  these  cases  grapple  with  when  to
recognize  a  “bystander”  claim  for  negligent  infliction  of  emotional
distress when the plaintiff is not physically involved in an accident but
still seeks compensation for her emotional injuries. In the ﬁnal case in
this section, Kerr, the court will consider a broader question — outside
of the bystander area, will courts generally recognize any duty not to
negligently cause emotional distress? Particularly in this area, courts
worry about the ramiﬁcations of making it too easy for an emotionally
upset  plaintiff  to  sue.  Ask  yourself  which  rule,  each  of  which  is  still
utilized  today  by  various  courts,  strikes  the  most  effective  balance
between  compensating  victims  for  true  harm  without  turning
everyone into a tortfeasor for hurting others’ feelings.

1. From Impact Rule to Zone of Danger

ROBB v. THE PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD CO.
210 A.2d 709 (Dela. 1965)

       , J.

The  question  before  us  for  decision  is  this:  May  the  plaintiff
recover  for  the  physical  consequences  of  fright  caused  by  the
negligence of the defendant, the plaintiff being within the immediate
zone  of  physical  danger  created  by  such  negligence,  although  there
was no contemporaneous bodily impact?

Considering the record in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,

the facts may be thus summarized:

A  private  lane  leading  to  the  home  of  the  plaintiff,  Dixie  B.  Robb,
was  intersected  by  a  railroad  right-of-way  leased  to  the  defendant,
The Pennsylvania Railroad Company. On March 11, 1961, the plaintiff
was  driving  an  automobile  up  the  lane  toward  her  home  when  the
vehicle stalled at the railroad grade crossing. A rut about a foot deep
had  been  negligently  permitted  by  the  defendant  to  form  at  the
crossing.  The  rear  wheels  of  the  automobile  lodged  in  the  rut  and,
although  the  plaintiff  tried  to  move  the  vehicle  for  several  minutes,
she was unable to do so. While thus engaged in attempting to move
the vehicle, the plaintiff saw the defendant’s train bearing down upon
her. With only seconds to spare, she jumped from the stalled vehicle
and  fled  for  her  life.  Immediately  thereafter,  the  locomotive  collided
with the vehicle, hurled it into the air and demolished it. The plaintiff
was  standing  within  a  few  feet  of  the  track  when  the  collision
occurred and her face was covered with train soot and dirt. However
— and  this  is  the  nub  of  the  problem — she  was  not  touched  by  the
impact;  and  she  suffered  no
train;
contemporaneous  physical  injury.  Nevertheless,  the  plaintiff  was
greatly  frightened  and  emotionally  disturbed  by  the  accident  as  the
result of which she sustained shock to her nervous system. The fright
and nervous shock resulted in physical injuries including cessation of
lactation  which  interfered  with  the  plaintiff’s  ability  to  nurse  and
otherwise care for her infant child. Her nervous and general physical
condition  resulting  from  the  accident  also  obliged  the  plaintiff  to
abandon  a  horse  breeding  business  and  an  article  which  she  had
been engaged to write for substantial compensation.

there  was  no  bodily

The defendant moved for summary judgment taking the position
that,  assuming  the  defendant’s  negligence  and
its  proximate
causation  of  the  plaintiff’s  fright  and  nervous  shock,  she  may  not
recover  because  there  was  no  “impact”  and  contemporaneous

judge  agreed  and  granted  summary
judgment in the defendant’s favor, stating: “In spite of a modern trend
to  the  contrary  in  other  jurisdictions,  I  feel  compelled  to  follow  the

‘impact  theory’
precedents in this State.”

injury.  The  trial

The  question  is  still  an  open  one  in  this  State.  Two  reported
Delaware  cases  and  one  unreported  case  border  upon  the  ﬁeld  of
inquiry, but none really enter it.

There is sharp diversity of judicial opinion as to the right to recover
for the physical consequences of fright in the absence of an impact
and contemporaneous physical injury. . . .

The impact rule was established in America by the leading cases
of  Ewing  v.  Pittsburgh,  etc.  R.  Co.,  23  A.  340  (Pa.  1892);  Mitchell  v.
Rochester  R.  Co.,  45  N.E.  354  (N.Y.  1896);  and  Spade  v.  Lynn  &
Boston  R.  Co.,  47  N.E.  88  (Mass.  1897).  [T]he  trend  favoring  the
impact  rule  .  .  .  attained  a  head-start  in  America  by  reason  of  the
Ewing,  Mitchell  and  Spade  cases  and  it  spread  to  numerous  other
jurisdictions under the influence of those cases.

The

impact  rule

is  based,  generally  speaking,  upon  three

propositions expounded in the Mitchell and Spade cases:

1) It is stated that since fright alone does not give rise to a cause
of  action,  the  consequences  of  fright  will  not  give  rise  to  a  cause  of
action. This is now generally recognized to be a non-sequitur, want of
damage  being  recognized  as  the  reason  that  negligence  causing
mere  fright  is  not  actionable.  It  is  now  generally  agreed,  even  in
jurisdictions which have adopted the impact rule, that the gist of the
action  is  the  injury  flowing  from  the  negligence,  whether  operating
through the medium of physical impact or nervous shock.

2)  It  is  stated  that  the  physical  consequences  of  fright  are  too
remote  and  that  the  requisite  causal  connection  is  unprovable.  The
fallacies  of  this  ground  of  the  impact  rule,  viewed  in  the  light  of
growing medical knowledge, were well stated by Chief Justice Maltbie
in  Orlo  v.  Connecticut  Co.,  21  A.2d  402  (Conn.  1941).  It  was  there
pointed  out  that  the  early  difﬁculty  in  tracing  a  resulting  injury  back
through fright or nervous shock has been minimized by the advance
of medical science; and that the line of cases permitting recovery for
serious  injuries  resulting  from  fright,  where  there  has  been  but  a
trivial  impact  in  itself  causing  little  or  no  injury,  demonstrate  that
in  tracing  causal  connection
insuperable  difﬁculty
there
between the wrongdoing and the injury via the fright.

is  no

3) It is stated that public policy and expediency demand that there
be no recovery for the physical consequences of fright in the absence
of  a  contemporaneous  physical  injury.  In  recent  years,  this  has
become the principal reason for denying recovery on the basis of the
impact  rule.  In  support  of  this  argument,  it  is  said  that  fright  is  a
subjective state of mind, difﬁcult to evaluate, and of such nature that
proof  by  the  claimant  is  too  easy  and  disproof  by  the  party  charged
too difﬁcult, thus making it unsafe as a practical matter for the law to
deal  with  such  claims.  This  school  of  thought  concludes  that  to
permit  recovery  in  such  cases  would  open  a  “Pandora’s  Box”  of
ﬁctitious and fraudulent claims involving speculative and conjectural
damages with which the law and medical science cannot justly cope.
It is our opinion that the reasons for rejecting the impact rule far

outweigh the reasons which have been advanced in its support.

The  cause  of  action  and  proximate  cause  grounds  for  the  rule
have been discredited in the very jurisdictions which ﬁrst gave them
credence. As stated by Holmes, C.J., for the Supreme Judicial Court
of  Massachusetts,  the  Spade  decision  did  not  result  from  “a  logical
deduction  from  the  general  principles  of  liability  in  tort,  but  as  a
limitation of those principles upon purely practical grounds.” Smith v.
Postal Telegraph Cable  Co.,  55  N.E.  380  (Mass.  1899).  Or,  as  stated

by  the  same  eminent  jurist  on  another  occasion,  he  deemed
exemption  from  such  damages  to  be  “an  arbitrary  exception,  based
upon a notion of what is practicable.” Homans v. Boston Elevated R.
Co., 62 N.E. 737 (Mass. 1902). And, referring to the Mitchell case and
the  grounds  here  under  consideration,  Lehman,  J.,  speaking  for  the
New York Court of Appeals, stated: “Its conclusions cannot be tested
by pure logic. The court recognized that its views of public policy to
some extent dictated its decision,” Comstock v. Wilson, supra.

If more were needed to warrant a declination to follow the cause
of  action  and  the  proximate  cause  arguments,  reference  to  the
ﬁctional  and  mechanical  ends  to  which  the  impact  rule  has  been
carried would sufﬁce for the purpose. The most trivial bodily contact,
itself causing little or no injury, has been considered sufﬁcient to take
a case out of the rule and permit recovery for serious physical injuries
resulting  from  the  accompanying  fright.  Token  impact  sufﬁcient  to
satisfy  the  rule  has  been  held  to  be  a  slight  bump  against  the  seat,
dust  in  the  eyes,  inhalation  of  smoke,  a  trifling  burn,  jostling  in  an
automobile, indeed any degree of physical impact, however slight.

This leaves the public policy or expediency ground to support the

impact rule. We think that ground untenable.

It  is  the  duty  of  the  courts  to  afford  a  remedy  and  redress  for
every  substantial  wrong.  Part  of  our  basic  law  is  the  mandate  that
“every  man  for  an  injury  done  him  in  his  .  .  .  person  .  .  .  shall  have
remedy by the due course of law. . . .” Del. Const. Art. 1, Sec. 9, Del. C.
Ann.  Neither  volume  of  cases,  nor  danger  of  fraudulent  claims,  nor
difﬁculty  of  proof,  will  relieve  the  courts  of  their  obligation  in  this
regard.  None  of  these  problems  are  insuperable.  Statistics  fail  to
show  that  there  has  been  a  “flood”  of  such  cases
in  those
jurisdictions  in  which  recovery  is  allowed;  but  if  there  be  increased
litigation,  the  courts  must  willingly  cope  with  the  task.  As  to  the
danger of illusory and ﬁctional claims, this is not a new problem; our
courts deal constantly with claims for pain and suffering based upon
subjective symptoms only; and the courts and the medical profession

have  been  found  equal  to  the  danger.  Fraudulent  claims  may  be
feigned  in  a  slight-impact  case  as  well  as  in  a  no-impact  case.
Likewise,  the  problems  of  adequacy  of  proof,  for  the  avoidance  of
speculative and conjectural damages, are common to personal injury
cases generally and are surmountable, being satisfactorily solved by
our courts in case after case.

We  are  unwilling  to  accept  a  rule,  or  an  expediency  argument  in
support thereof, which results in the denial of a logical legal right and
remedy in all cases because in some a ﬁctitious injury may be urged
or a difﬁcult problem of the proof or disproof of speculative damage
may  be  presented.  Justice  is  not  best  served,  we  think,  when
compensation  is  denied  to  one  who  has  suffered  injury  through  the
negligence  of  another  merely  because  of  the  possibility  of
encouraging ﬁctitious claims or speculative damages in other cases.
Public policy requires the courts, with the aid of the legal and medical
professions,  to  ﬁnd  ways  and  means  to  solve  satisfactorily  the
problems  thus  presented-not  expedient  ways  to  avoid  them.  We
recognize that “[expediency] may tip the scales when arguments are
nicely balanced,” Woolford Realty Co. v. Rose, 286 U.S. 319, 330; but,
in  our  view,  such  nice  balance  no  longer  exists  as  to  the  subject
matter.

Accordingly, we decline to adopt the impact rule, as urged by the
defendant in this cause. The impact rule “is almost certainly destined
for ultimate extinction, although it displays surprising vitality, and the
process may not be a rapid one. [I]t seems clear that the courts which
deny  all  remedy  in  such  cases  are  ﬁghting  a  rearguard  action.”
Prosser on Torts (3d Ed.) pp. 351-352.

We  hold,  therefore,  that  where  negligence  proximately  caused
fright, in one within the immediate area of physical danger from that
negligence,  which  in  turn  produced  physical  consequences  such  as
would be elements of damage if a bodily injury had been suffered, the
injured  party  is  entitled  to  recover  under  an  application  of  the
prevailing principles of law as to negligence and proximate causation.

Otherwise  stated,  where  results,  which  are  regarded  as  proper
elements  of  recovery  as  a  consequence  of  physical  injury,  are
proximately caused by fright due to negligence, recovery by one in the
immediate zone of physical risk should be permitted.

This  view  has  the  general  approval  of  the  writers  on  the  subject
and is now distinctly the majority rule. We are satisﬁed that it is the
better rule, supported by reason, logic and fairness.

We conclude, therefore, that the Superior Court erred in the instant
case  in  holding  that  the  plaintiff’s  right  to  recover  is  barred  by  the
impact rule. The plaintiff claims physical injuries resulting from fright
proximately  caused  by  the  negligence  of  the  defendant.  She  should
have the opportunity to prove such injuries and to recover therefor if
she  succeeds.  The  summary  judgment  granted  in  favor  of  the
defendant  must  be  reversed  and  the  cause  remanded  for  further
proceedings.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Dire  Prediction  for  Impact  Rule  Not  Realized.   The  Robb  court
found  the  pragmatic  principles  undergirding  the
impact  rule
untenable  and  predicted  the  demise  of  that  rule.  What  were  the
rationales  and  how  effectively  did  the  court  repudiate  them?  By  the
way,  under  the  facts  of  Robb,  was  there  any  argument  that  the
plaintiff  could  have  recovered  without  a  new  doctrinal  switch  by  the
court? Remember factually what the plaintiff experienced in the near
miss  and  how  the  court  referenced  what  types  of  “trivial”  contact
could satisfy the impact rule. Notwithstanding the court’s prediction,
the impact rule lives on to this day being employed by multiple courts
in  different  jurisdictions.  It  is  the  distinct  minority  rule  but  it  still
survives. Do you see any advantage, conceptual or pragmatic, to the
impact rule over the zone of danger rule adopted in Robb?

2.  Requirement  for  Physical  Manifestation  of  Emotional  Distress.
The  Robb  court  permits  recovery  where  the  negligence  of  the
defendant does not even touch the plaintiff physically but affects the
plaintiff emotionally — yet only where the emotional distress results in
some  physical  consequences.  Why  limit  recovery  for  emotional
distress  in  this  way?  Do  you  see  how  even  some  courts  embracing
the  newer  zone  of  danger  rule  are  still  uncomfortable  with
recognizing  a  claim  for  negligently  caused  emotional  distress?  In
what  way  does  the  requirement  of  physical  consequences  help
courts  to  alleviate  some  of  their  concerns  with  fraudulent  and
ﬁctitious claims? Is this any more effective than the old impact rule?

3. Zone of Danger.  In terms of physical space, the zone of danger
increases the potential for a plaintiff to recover for emotional distress
— rather  than  demanding  that  the  plaintiff  be  close  enough  to  the
calamity caused by defendant’s negligence to be physically touched,
now it is sufﬁcient for the plaintiff to be merely close enough to have
a legitimate fear for their own safety. How close the plaintiff must be
necessarily  depends  upon  the  circumstances  of  the  accident.  In  the
case of a train wreck, plaintiff was surely within the zone of danger in
Robb, as she barely escaped her car before disaster struck.

4.  No  Emotional  Distress  Recovery  for  Property  Loss.   The  Robb
court failed to acknowledge that the plaintiff suffered the loss of her
vehicle  due  to  the  defendant  railway’s  negligence.  There  was  no
doubt  about  the  plaintiff’s  entitlement  to  recover  for  the  negligently
caused  property  loss.  Could  she  have  claimed  to  suffer  emotional
distress from the loss of her car? Courts have consistently refused to
recognize  such  a  claim.  See  e.g.,  Kleinke  v.  Farmers  Cooperative
Supply & Shipping, 549 N.W.2d 714 (Wis. 1996) (“[I]t is unlikely that a
plaintiff  could  ever  recover  for  the  emotional  distress  caused  by
negligent  damage  to  his  or  her  property”).  While  emotional  distress
recovery  can  be  a  component  of  damages  for  physical  injuries  to
oneself, courts do not allow such claims to be tacked onto a property

loss  claim.  No  matter  how  much  you  like  your  Camaro,  it  can  be
easily replaced.

2. From Zone of Danger to Dillon Rule of Foreseeability

Sometimes  convincing  a  court  to  abandon  one  doctrine  in  favor  of
another  requires  extraordinary  facts  that  would  yield  a  perceived
grave injustice under then-prevailing standards. Although the zone of
danger rule had already become quite popular, the California Supreme
Court  found  its  application  untenable  under  the  facts  of  the  Dillon
case below. The repudiation of the old doctrine in favor of a new one
became  so  tied  to  the  following  case  that  the  new  doctrine  is  now
known as the Dillon rule.

DILLON v. LEGG
441 P.2d 912 (Cal. 1968)

        , J.

That  the  courts  should  allow  recovery  to  a  mother  who  suffers
emotional trauma and physical injury from witnessing the infliction of
death  or  injury  to  her  child  for  which  the  tortfeasor  is  liable  in
negligence would appear to be a compelling proposition. As Prosser
points  out,  “All  ordinary  human  feelings  are  in  favor  of  her  [the
mother’s]  action  against  the  negligent  defendant.  If  a  duty  to  her
requires that she herself be in some recognizable danger, then it has
properly  been  said  that  when  a  child  is  endangered,  it  is  not  beyond
contemplation  that  its  mother  will  be  somewhere  in  the  vicinity,  and
will suffer serious shock.” Prosser, Law of Torts (3d ed. 1964) p. 353.

Nevertheless,  past  American  decisions  have  barred  the  mother’s
recovery.  Refusing  the  mother  the  right  to  take  her  case  to  the  jury,
these  courts  ground  their  position  on  an  alleged  absence  of  a

required  “duty”  of  due  care  of  the  tortfeasor  to  the  mother.  Duty,  in
turn,  they  state,  must  express  public  policy;  the  imposition  of  duty
here  would  work  disaster  because  it  would  invite  fraudulent  claims
and  it  would  involve  the  courts  in  the  hopeless  task  of  deﬁning  the
extent of the tortfeasor’s liability. In substance, they say, deﬁnition of
liability  being  impossible,  denial  of  liability  is  the  only  realistic
alternative.

We have concluded that neither of the feared dangers excuses the
frustration of the natural justice upon which the mother’s claim rests.
We shall point out that in the past we have rejected the argument that
we  should  deny  recovery  upon  a  legitimate  claim  because  other
fraudulent  ones  may  be  urged.  We  shall  further  explain  that  the
alleged inability to ﬁx deﬁnitions for recovery on the different facts of
future  cases  does  not  justify  the  denial  of  recovery  on  the  speciﬁc
facts of the instant case; in any event, proper guidelines can indicate
the extent of liability for such future cases.

In the instant case plaintiff’s ﬁrst cause of action alleged that on
or  about  September  27,  1964,  defendant  drove  his  automobile  in  a
southerly  direction  on  Bluegrass  Road  near  its  intersection  with
Clover Lane in the County of Sacramento, and at that time plaintiff’s
infant daughter, Erin Lee Dillon, lawfully crossed Bluegrass Road. The
complaint  further  alleged  that  defendant’s  negligent  operation  of  his
vehicle caused it to “collide with the deceased Erin Lee Dillon resulting
in  injuries  to  decedent  which  proximately  resulted  in  her  death.”
Plaintiff,  as  the  mother  of  the  decedent,  brought  an  action  for
compensation for the loss.

Plaintiff’s  second  cause  of  action  alleged  that  she,  Margery  M.
Dillon,  “was  in  close  proximity  to  the  .  .  .  collision  and  personally
witnessed  said  collision.”  She  further  alleged  that  “because  of  the
negligence of defendants . . . and as a proximate cause [sic]  thereof
plaintiff  .  .  .  sustained  great  emotional  disturbance  and  shock  and
injury  to  her  nervous  system”  which  caused  her  great  physical  and
mental pain and suffering.

Plaintiff’s third cause of action alleged that Cheryl Dillon, another
infant  daughter,  was  “in  close  proximity  to  the  .  .  .  collision  and
personally  witnessed  said  collision.”  Because  of  the  negligence,
Cheryl  Dillon  “sustained  great  emotional  disturbance  and  shock  and
injury  to  her  nervous  system”  which  caused  her  great  physical  and
mental pain and suffering.

On  December  22,  1965,  defendant,  after  he  had  ﬁled  his  answer,
moved  for  judgment  on  the  pleadings,  contending  that  [no  cause  of
action  for  emotional  distress  had  been  stated  from  the  mere
witnessing of the accident]. Even where a child, sister or spouse is the
object  of  the  plaintiff’s  apprehension  no  cause  of  action  is  stated
unless  the  complaint  alleges  that  the  plaintiff  suffered  emotional
distress,  fright  or  shock  as  a  result  of  fear  for  his  own  safety.  The
[trial] court granted a judgment on the pleadings against the mother’s
count,  the  second  cause  of  action,  and  denied  it  as  to  the  sister’s
count,  the  third  cause  of  action.  Margery  M.  Dillon,  the  mother,
appealed from that judgment.

Thereafter,  on  January  26,  further  proceedings  took  place  as  to
the  third  cause  of  action,  Cheryl  Dillon’s  claim  for  emotional  trauma
from witnessing her sister’s death while “watching her sister lawfully
cross  Bluegrass  Road.”  [Defendant  had  also  moved  for  summary
judgment  as  to  the  sister’s  claim  for  emotional  distress.  There  was
some evidence, though disputed, that the sister was on the curb and
within the zone of danger.]

The  trial  court  apparently  sustained  the  motion  for  judgment  on
the  pleadings  on  the  second  cause  as  to  the  mother  because  she
was not within the zone of danger and denied that motion as to the
third  cause  involving  Cheryl  because  of  the  possibility  that  she  was
within  such  zone  of  danger  or  feared  for  her  own  safety.  Thus  we
have  before  us  a  case  that  dramatically  illustrates  the  difference  in
result  [from  the  zone  of  danger  rule]  because  the  complaint  here
presents  the  claim  of  the  emotionally  traumatized  mother,  who
admittedly was not within the zone of danger, as contrasted with that

of the sister, who may have been  within  it.  The  case  thus  illustrates
the  fallacy  of  the  rule  that  would  deny  recovery  in  the  one  situation
and grant it in the other. In the ﬁrst place, we can hardly justify relief
to the sister for trauma which she suffered upon apprehension of the
child’s  death  and  yet  deny  it  to  the  mother  merely  because  of  a
happenstance  that  the  sister  was  some  few  yards  closer  to  the
accident.  The  instant  case  exposes  the  hopeless  artiﬁciality  of  the
zone-of-danger  rule.  In  the  second  place,  to  rest  upon  the  zone-of-
danger  rule  when  we  have  rejected  the  impact  rule  becomes  even
less  defensible.  We  have,  indeed,  held  that  impact  is  not  necessary
for  recovery.  The  zone-of-danger  concept  must,  then,  inevitably
collapse because the only reason for the requirement of presence in
that  zone  lies  in  the  fact  that  one  within  it  will  fear  the  danger  of
impact. At the threshold, then, we point to the incongruity of the rules
upon which any rejection of plaintiff’s recovery must rest.

We turn then to an analysis of the concept of duty, which, as we
have stated, has furnished the ground for the rejection of such claims
as the instant one. Normally the simple facts of plaintiff’s complaint
would  establish  a  cause  of  action:  the  complaint  alleges  that
defendant  drove  his  car  (1)  negligently,  as  a  (2)  proximate  result  of
which  plaintiff  suffered  (3)  physical  injury.  Proof  of  these  facts  to  a
jury leads to recovery in damages; indeed, such a showing represents
a  classic  example  of  the  type  of  accident  with  which  the  law  of
negligence has been designed to deal.

The  assertion  that  liability  must  nevertheless  be  denied  because
defendant bears no “duty” to plaintiff “begs the essential question —
whether the plaintiff’s interests are entitled to legal protection against
the  defendant’s  conduct.  .  .  .  It  [duty]  is  a  shorthand  statement  of  a
conclusion, rather than an aid to analysis in itself. . . . But it should be
recognized  that  ‘duty’  is  not  sacrosanct  in  itself,  but  only  an
expression  of  the  sum  total  of  those  considerations  of  policy  which
lead  the  law  to  say  that  the  particular  plaintiff  is  entitled  to
protection.” Prosser, Law of Torts, supra, at pp. 332-333.

The history of the concept of duty in itself discloses that it is not
an old and deep-rooted doctrine but a legal device of the latter half of
the nineteenth century designed to curtail the feared propensities of
juries toward liberal awards. “It must not be forgotten that ‘duty’ got
into our law for the very purpose of combatting what was then feared
to  be  a  dangerous  delusion  (perhaps  especially  prevalent  among
juries  imbued  with  popular  notions  of  fairness  untempered  by
paramount judicial policy), viz., that the law might countenance legal
redress for all foreseeable harm.” Fleming, An Introduction to the Law
of Torts (1967) p. 47.

We have pointed out that this late 19th century concept of duty, as
applied to the instant situation, has led the courts to deny liability. We
have  noted  that  this  negation  of  duty  emanates  from  the  twin  fears
that courts will be flooded with an onslaught of (1) fraudulent and (2)
indeﬁnable  claims.  We  shall  point  out  why  we  think  neither  fear
justiﬁed.

In  the  ﬁrst  instance,  the  argument  proceeds  from  a  doubtful
factual assumption. Whatever the possibilities of fraudulent claims of
physical injury by disinterested spectators of an accident, a question
not in issue in this case, we certainly cannot doubt that a mother who
sees  her  child  killed  will  suffer  physical  injury  from  shock.  “It  seems
sufﬁciently obvious that the shock of a mother at danger or harm to
her  child  may  be  both  a  real  and  a  serious  injury.”  Prosser,  Law  of
Torts, supra, at p. 353.

In  the  second  instance,  and  more  fundamentally,  the  possibility
that  fraudulent  assertions  may  prompt  recovery  in  isolated  cases
does not justify a wholesale rejection of the entire class of claims in
which  that  potentiality  arises.  “Certainly  it  is  a  very  questionable
position  for  a  court  to  take,  that  because  of  the  possibility  of
encouraging  ﬁctitious  claims  compensation  should  be  denied  those
who  have  actually  suffered  serious  injury  through  the  negligence  of
another.” Orlo v. Connecticut Co., 21 A.2d 402 (Conn. 1941).

The  possibility  that  some  fraud  will  escape  detection  does  not
justify  an  abdication  of  the  judicial  responsibility  to  award  damages
for sound claims: if it is “to be conceded that our procedural system
for  the  ascertainment  of  truth  is  inadequate  to  defeat  fraudulent
claims . . . the result is a virtual acknowledgment that the courts are
unable  to  render  justice  in  respect  to  them.”  Chiuchiolo  v.  New
England Wholesale Tailors, 150 A. 540 (N.H. 1930).

In  sum,  the  application  of  tort  law  can  never  be  a  matter  of
mathematical  precision.  In  terms  of  characterizing  conduct  as
tortious  and  matching  a  money  award  to  the  injury  suffered  as  well
as in ﬁxing the extent of injury, the process cannot be perfect. Yet we
cannot  let  the  difﬁculties  of  adjudication  frustrate  the  principle  that
there be a remedy for every substantial wrong.

perceived deﬁnes the duty to be obeyed.” Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R.
Co., 162 N.E. 99 (N.Y. 1928). Defendant owes a duty, in the sense of a

likelihood  made

Since the chief element in determining whether defendant owes a
duty  or  an  obligation  to  plaintiff  is  the  foreseeability  of  the  risk,  that
factor will be of prime concern in every case. Because it is inherently
intertwined  with  foreseeability  such  duty  or  obligation  must
necessarily  be  adjudicated  only  upon  a  case-by-case  basis.  We
cannot now predetermine defendant’s obligation in every situation by
a  ﬁxed  category;  no  immutable  rule  can  establish  the  extent  of  that
obligation  for  every  circumstance  of  the  future.  We  can,  however,
deﬁne guidelines which will aid in the resolution of such an issue as
the instant one.

injury  to  plaintiff,  or,

We  note,  ﬁrst,  that  we  deal  here  with  a  case  in  which  plaintiff
suffered a shock which resulted in physical injury and we conﬁne our
ruling to that case. In determining, in such a case, whether defendant
should  reasonably  foresee  the
in  other
terminology, whether defendant owes plaintiff a duty of due care, the
courts  will  take  into  account  such  factors  as  the  following:  (1)
Whether  plaintiff  was  located  near  the  scene  of  the  accident  as
contrasted  with  one  who  was  a  distance  away  from  it.  (2)  Whether
the shock resulted from a direct emotional impact upon plaintiff from
the  sensory  and  contemporaneous  observance  of  the  accident,  as
contrasted  with  learning  of  the  accident  from  others  after  its
occurrence. (3) Whether plaintiff and the victim were closely related,
as contrasted with an absence of any relationship or the presence of
only a distant relationship.

The  evaluation  of  these  factors  will  indicate  the  degree  of  the
defendant’s  foreseeability:  obviously  defendant  is  more  likely  to
foresee  that  a  mother  who  observes  an  accident  affecting  her  child
will  suffer  harm  than  to  foretell  that  a  stranger  witness  will  do  so.
Similarly, the degree of foreseeability of the third person’s injury is far
greater  in  the  case  of  his  contemporaneous  observance  of  the
accident  than  that  in  which  he  subsequently  learns  of  it.  The
defendant  is  more  likely  to  foresee  that  shock  to  the  nearby,
witnessing  mother  will  cause  .  .  .  harm  than  to  anticipate  that
someone distant from the accident will suffer more than a temporary
emotional  reaction.  All  these  elements,  of  course,  shade  into  each
other;  the  ﬁxing  of  obligation,  intimately  tied  into  the  facts,  depends
upon each case.

In the instant case, the presence of all the above factors indicates
that  plaintiff  has  alleged  a  sufﬁcient  prima  facie  case.  Surely  the
negligent  driver  who  causes  the  death  of  a  young  child  may
reasonably  expect  that  the  mother  will  not  be  far  distant  and  will
upon  witnessing  the  accident  suffer  emotional  trauma.  As  Dean
Prosser  has  stated:  “when  a  child  is  endangered,  it  is  not  beyond

contemplation  that  its  mother  will  be  somewhere  in  the  vicinity,  and
will suffer serious shock.” Prosser, The Law of Torts, supra, at p. 353.
See also 2 Harper & James, The Law of Torts, supra, at p. 1039.

Thus  we  see  no  good  reason  why  the  general  rules  of  tort  law,
including
the  concepts  of  negligence,  proximate  cause,  and
foreseeability,  long  applied  to  all  other  types  of  injury,  should  not
govern the case now before us. Any questions that the cause raises
“will be solved most justly by applying general principles of duty and
negligence, and . . . mechanical rules of thumb which are at variance
with  these  principles  do  more  harm  than  good.”  2  Harper  &  James,
The Law of Torts, supra, p. 1039 (footnote omitted).

In short, the history of the cases does not show the development
of  a  logical  rule  but  rather  a  series  of  changes  and  abandonments.
Upon the argument in each situation that the courts draw a Maginot
Line  to  withstand  an  onslaught  of  false  claims,  the  cases  have
assumed a variety of postures. At ﬁrst they insisted that there be no
recovery  for  emotional  trauma  at  all.  Retreating  from  this  position,
they  gave  relief  for  such  trauma  only  if  physical  impact  occurred.
They  then  abandoned  the  requirement  for  physical  impact  but
insisted that the victim fear for her own safety, holding that a mother
could  recover  for  fear  for  her  children’s  safety  if  she  simultaneously
entertained  a  personal  fear  for  herself.  They  stated  that  the  mother
need only be in the “zone of danger.” The ﬁnal anomaly would be the
instant case in which the sister, who observed the accident, would be
granted  recovery  because  she  was  in  the  “zone  of  danger,”  but  the
mother, not far distant, would be barred from recovery.

The  successive  abandonment  of  these  positions  exposes  the
weakness of artiﬁcial abstractions which bar recovery contrary to the
general  rules.  As  the  commentators  have  suggested,  the  problem
should be solved by the application of the principles of tort, not by the
creation  of  exceptions  to  them.  Legal  history  shows  that  artiﬁcial
islands of exceptions, created from the fear that the legal process will

not  work,  usually  do  not  withstand  the  waves  of  reality  and,  in  time,
descend into oblivion.

We have explained that recovery here will not expose the courts to
false claims or a flood of litigation. The test that we have set forth will
aid  in  the  proper  resolution  of  future  cases.  Indeed,  the  general
principles  of  tort  law  are  acknowledged  to  work  successfully  in  all
other cases of emotional trauma.

To deny recovery would be to chain this state to an outmoded rule
of  the  19th  century  which  can  claim  no  current  credence.  No  good
reason compels our captivity to an indefensible orthodoxy.

The judgment is reversed.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Further  Enlargement  of  Duty.   Near  the  end  of  its  seminal
opinion,  the  Dillon  court  briefly  traces  the  evolution  of  tort  law’s
acceptance  of  claims  for  primarily  emotional  loss.  As  the  law
transitioned  from  only  allowing  emotional  distress  secondary  to
some  physical  harm  (or  at  least  impact)  to  the  zone  of  danger,  the
court then further widens the circle by permitting a plaintiff to recover
for emotional distress despite not being close enough to reasonably
fear for her own safety. While the decedent’s sister was close enough,
the  mother  was  not.  The  court  believed  this  situation  illustrated  the
hopeless  artiﬁciality  of  the  zone  of  danger  rule,  because  surely  the
mother’s  grief  was  just  as  genuine,  and  foreseeable,  as  that  of  the
sibling.

2. Physical Manifestation of Emotional Distress.  In Dillon,  as  with
the  plaintiff  in  Robb,  the  plaintiff  complained  of  being  emotionally
upset  by  witnessing  the  event  and  of  this  causing  some  physical
consequences.  Both  courts  permitted  recovery  for  the  emotional
injury  only  because  there  was  a  physical  manifestation  of  it.  But
many other courts, in applying these duty doctrines, do not  demand
that  there  be  any  physical  manifestation  of  the  emotional  injury.  As
one court held, “To . . . require that, before one who is mentally injured
may  recover,  he  must  at  least  regurgitate  once  seems  .  .  .  to  be
imposing upon the law a requirement that makes little sense.” James
v.  Lieb,  375  N.W.2d  109,  116  (Neb.  1985)  (quoting  Fournell  v.  Usher
Pest Control Co., 305 N.W.2d 605, 611 (Neb. 1981)).

3.  Guidelines  Become  Prerequisites.   The  court  referred  to  three
“factors”  or  guidelines  that  were  to  be  a  proxy  in  the  analysis  for
“foreseeability” of the plaintiff’s emotional injury. The plaintiff in Dillon
satisﬁed all three, so the court left undecided whether all three had to
be  present  to  pursue  a  bystander  claim  for  emotional  distress.
Subsequent  decisions  from  the  California  Supreme  Court  ultimately
held  that  all  three  were  requirements  rather  than  just  factors.  See
Thing  v.  La  Chusa,  771  P.2d  814  (Cal.  1989).  This  is  how  other
jurisdictions  following  Dillon  have  treated  these  three  indicia  of
genuineness — the absence of any of the three negates any duty.

4. How  Close  Must  the  Plaintiff  Be?   The  ﬁrst  requirement — that
the  plaintiff  be  “near  the  scene”  of  the  accident  begs  the  question
“how close is close enough?” Surely one need not be close enough to

fear  for  his  own  safety  or  else  we  would  simply  regress  back  to  the
zone  of  danger  rule.  Logically,  the  ﬁrst  requirement  is  subsumed  by
the second — that the plaintiff must have been close enough to have
“contemporaneous”  sensory  observation  of  the  accident.  While  this
second  factor  seems  pretty  straightforward,  some  courts  applying
Dillon  have  struggled  at  times  trying  to  decide  whether  to  admit  or
deny a claim where the plaintiff did not actually see the accident but
came  upon  it  moments  later.  See  Archibald  v.  Braverman,  275  Cal.
App. 2d 253 (Cal. App. 1969) (mother who arrived at scene moments
after accident allowed to recover because she had heard it); cf., Hegel
v.  McMahon,  960  P.2d  424  (Wash.  1998)  (permitting  recovery  to
plaintiff  father  who  arrived  at  scene  ten  minutes  after  his  son  was
killed on his motorcycle and was able to witness son injured but still
alive).  In  McMahon,  the  Supreme  Court  of  Washington  stated  with
regard to its decision to extend the rule and permit recovery: “A bright
line  rule  that  limits  recovery  for  emotional  distress  to  those  who
witnessed the accident is attractive in its simplicity. However, it draws
an  arbitrary  line  that  served  to  exclude  plaintiffs  without  meaningful
distinction.” Id. at 428. Courts are all over the map on how strictly to
apply this requirement. The risk is that by not taking this requirement
seriously,  you  lose  the  predictability  of  the  Dillon  approach  and  also
create  potentially  greater
intended.  For
example,  should  a  loved  one  watching  the  death  of  their  relative  on
television be allowed to recover?

liability  than  originally

5. How  Badly  Hurt  Must  the  Family  Member  Be?   Courts  applying
the  Dillon  test  typically  require  the  primary  victim  to  have  suffered
death  or  at  least  serious  bodily  injury  in  the  accident.  This  can  be
viewed  as  a  fourth  prerequisite.  In  other  words,  a  mother  watching
her son get knocked off his bicycle and scufﬁng his knees would not
be  entitled  to  recover  her  emotional  distress  damages  under  Dillon.
How does this requirement comport with the underlying concern that
the emotional injury be authentic and foreseeable?

GROTTS v. ZAHNER
989 P.2d 415 (Nev. 1999)

      , J.

Appellant,  Kellie  Grotts  (“Grotts”),  and  her  ﬁance  were  involved  in
an  accident  with  respondent  Gertrude  Zahner  (“Zahner”).  Grotts
commenced  her  action  below  against  Zahner  seeking  “bystander”
injuries
emotional  distress  damages
sustained by her ﬁance in the accident. The district court dismissed
her claim of bystander emotional distress on the ground that she was
not,  as  a  matter  of  law,  “closely  related”  to  her  ﬁance  for  these
purposes. Grotts appeals.

in  connection  with  fatal

A  bystander  who  witnesses  an  accident  may  recover  for
emotional  distress  in  certain  limited  situations.  See  State  v.  Eaton,
101  Nev.  705,  716,  710  P.2d  1370,  1377-78  (1985)  (citing  Dillon  v.
Legg, 68 Cal. 2d 728, 441 P.2d 912, 916, 69 Cal. Rptr. 72 (Cal. 1968)).
To  recover,  the  witness-plaintiff  must  prove  that  he  or  she  (1)  was
injured  by  the
located  near  the  scene;  (2)  was  emotionally
contemporaneous  sensory  observance  of  the  accident;  and  (3)  was
closely related to the victim.

In  State Department  of  Transportation v. Hill,  114  Nev.  810,  816,
963  P.2d  480,  483  (1998),  a  plurality  of  this  court  determined  that
“whether  a  plaintiff  can  recover  [damages]  for  NIED  [negligent
infliction  of  emotional  distress]  after  witnessing  injury  to  another
based  on  the  plaintiff’s  relationship  to  the  victim  is  generally  a
question of fact.” Acknowledging that obvious cases will exist where
the  issue  of  “closeness”  can  be  determined  as  a  matter  of  law,  the
plurality  concluded  that  the  fact  ﬁnder  in  most  cases  should  be  left
with  the  task  of  assessing  the  nature  and  quality  of  the  claimant’s
relationship to the victim for these purposes.

We  now  conclude,  contrary  to  the  plurality  holding  in  Hill,  that
standing  issues  concerning  “closeness  of  relationship”  between  a

victim  and  a  bystander  should,  as  a  general  proposition,  be
determined  based  upon  family  membership,  either  by  blood  or
marriage.  Immediate  family  members  of  the  victim  qualify  for
standing  to  bring  NIED  claims  as  a  matter  of  law.  When  the  family
relationship  between  the  victim  and  the  bystander  is  beyond  the
immediate  family  [i.e.,  beyond  the  ﬁrst  degree  of  consanguinity]  the
fact  ﬁnder  should  assess  the  nature  and  quality  of  the  relationship
and,  therefrom,  determine  as  a  factual  matter  whether  the
relationship  is  close  enough  to  confer  standing.  This  latter  category
represents  the  “few  close  cases”  where  standing  will  be  determined
as an issue of fact, either by a jury or the trial court sitting without a
jury.  We  therefore  hold  that  any  non-family  “relationship”  fails,  as  a
matter of law, to qualify for NIED standing.

In  this  case,  Grotts  claims  standing  to  lodge  a  “bystander”  NIED
claim  because  of  her  afﬁanced  relationship  to  the  victim.  Because
she was not a member of his “family” by blood or marriage, we hold
that she does not enjoy the type of “close relationship” required under
Eaton.

For the above reasons, we afﬁrm the trial court.

    , C.J., dissenting

Just a year ago, in State Department of Transportation v. Hill, 114
Nev.  810,  963  P.2d  480  (1998),  we  drafted  a  less  rigid  and  more
equitable  framework  for  deciding  negligent  infliction  of  emotional
distress  issues.  The  majority’s  departure  from  the  framework  set
forth in Hill prevents that procedure from being tested in our district
courts  to  determine  its  validity.  I  believe  we  are  discarding  this
precedent prematurely.

The rule adopted by the majority requires a relationship by blood
or  marriage  before  one  can  claim  to  have  a  close  relationship  for
purposes  of  pursuing  damages  for  negligent  infliction  of  emotional
distress. While this rule will be predictable, it will permit some people
to pursue this claim who have no close relationship, and yet prohibit

others who have a loving, close relationship with someone injured or
killed from pursuing these claims merely because they are not related
by blood or marriage.

The case at issue provides a good example. Kellie Grotts and John
Colwell  were  very  much  in  love  and  expected  to  marry  in  the  near
future.  They  were  at  the  zenith  of  love  and  commitment.  Numerous
plays  and  novels  have  been  written  about  the  great  loss  suffered
when  this  type  of  relationship  ends  with  the  death  of  one  party.  Yet
the majority denies Kellie Grotts’ claim for emotional distress caused
as a result of witnessing the death of the love of her life and constant
companion simply because their wedding date was a few months off.
This same scenario could happen to an older man and woman who,
for  a  variety  of  reasons,  had  lived  together  for  years  but  were  not
formally married.

And the unfairness of the rule adopted today does not stop there.
Anyone  living  in  a  non-traditional  relationship  will  be  denied  the
chance  to  recover  emotional  distress  damages,  while  those  living
together with beneﬁt of marriage will not suffer such prejudice. It is a
fact of life that many gay men and lesbian women have partners with
whom  they  have  lived  for  decades  and  shared  a  close,  loving
relationship.  These  individuals  will  be  denied  the  right  to  even  claim
damages for emotional distress for witnessing injury or death to their
partner  for  no  other  reason  than  that  they  are  not  legally  married,  a
status  they  cannot  prevent.  The  closeness  of  two  people  should  be
judged by the quality and intimacy of the relationship, not by whether
there is a blood relationship or whether a document has been ﬁled at
the  courthouse.  A  segment  of  our  population  should  not  be  denied
legal redress simply because of their lifestyle.

Accordingly, I dissent.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Predictability  and  Clarity  vs.  Fairness.   Of  the  three  Dillon
criteria,  some  courts  concede  that  the  most  valuable  indicator  of
foreseeable  emotional  injury  is  the  family  relationship.  This  is  not  to
say  that  a  family  relationship  necessarily  predicts  genuine  and  deep
emotional distress when witnessing injury, or that the lack of a family
relationship  negates  any  emotional  distress.  But  the  thought  is  that,
in general, witnessing the death or serious injury to a family member
causes more emotional distress than to someone else. Some courts,
such as the one above, require legal or blood relationship. The dissent
would prefer that the closeness of the relationship just be an issue for
the jury’s consideration. However, the more predictable the result, the
more  strict  the  rules  must  be  applied.  This  sometimes  would  mean
the  dismissal  of  a  claim  where  the  emotional  distress  was  quite
severe,  presumably  such  as  when  a  ﬁancé  has  died  as  the  majority
held above.

2. Other Relationships.  Strictly applied, would a best friend for life
be permitted to sue under Dillon? What about a stepmother? A father-
in-law? If the dissent in Grotts were to prevail these would all be jury
questions — whether  the  jury  is  convinced  by  the  relationship  that
true  emotional  distress  has  occurred.  If  relationship  by  blood  or
marriage  is  required  then  the  latter  two  instances  might  possibly
qualify due to the legal relationship.

in

involved

3.  Homosexual  Relationships.   One  concern  that  the  dissent  in
Grotts  mentioned
“non-traditional
those
relationships”  who  were  once  denied  the  opportunity  to  create  a
legally  recognized  relationship  such  as  marriage.  In  2015,  however,
the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S. Ct. 2584
(2015), that homosexuals were constitutionally entitled to have states
permit their formal marriage. As a result, homosexual couples are no
longer  discriminated  against  by  virtue  of  the  Dillon  rule’s  general
requirement  for  a  legally  recognized  relationship  involving  blood  or
marriage.

4. False Dichotomy?  Most jurisdictions today choose between the
two  most  prevalent  rules  for  recognizing  negligent  infliction  of
emotional  distress — the  zone  of  danger  rule  or  the  Dillon  rule.  Yet
each  of  these  rules  permits  recovery  in  light  of  a  different  type  of
emotional  distress.  Zone  of  danger  permits  recovery  for  distress
associated  with  one’s  concern  for  oneself.  The  Dillon  recovery  for
emotional distress is limited instead to emotional distress associated
with concern for a family member. Given this difference, why should a
jurisdiction  feel  compelled  to  choose  between  these  two  rules?  A
court  could  permit  recovery  if  the  plaintiff  could  satisfy  either  test.
This  has  not  yet  happened,  however.  Should  it?  Perceptive  counsel
should always be prepared to argue for modiﬁcation or expansion of
existing  doctrines  when  the  circumstances  reveal  a  hopeless
artiﬁciality in them.
5. Problems.
A. Of the three tests we have studied — the impact rule, the zone of
danger  rule,  and  the  Dillon  rule — which  permits  the  broadest,
most liberal scope of coverage?

B.  Under  the  facts  of  Grotts,  would  the  ﬁancée  have  been  able  to
recover in either an impact rule or a zone of danger jurisdiction?

3. Is There a General Duty Not to Cause Emotional

Distress?

All  courts  permit  a  plaintiff  suffering  physical  injuries  to  recover  for
emotional distress associated with those injuries — to the extent the
jury  ﬁnds  such  emotional  distress.  And,  as  the  prior  section
illustrates,  courts  also  permit  primary  claims  for  emotional  distress
under whatever bystander rule is adopted by the jurisdiction. But will
courts  recognize  a  general  duty  not  to  negligently  inflict  emotional
distress  in  a  non-bystander  scenario?  The  following  case  tries  to
make  sense  of  the  various  rules  dealing  with  recovery  for  emotional

distress in the context of a plaintiff arguing that a general duty of care
exists.

BOYLES v. KERR
855 S.W.2d 593 (Tex. 1993)

        , C.J.

This is a suit for the negligent infliction of emotional distress. We
hold  that  there  is  no  general  duty  in  Texas  not  to  negligently  inflict
emotional distress. A claimant may recover mental anguish damages
only in connection with defendant’s breach of some other legal duty.
Because  Respondent  proceeded  below  only  on  the  theory  of
negligent infliction of emotional distress, we reverse the judgment of
the  court  of  appeals  in  her  favor.  However,  in  the  interest  of  justice,
we remand for a new trial.

On  August  10,  1985,  Petitioner  Dan  Boyles,  Jr.,  then  seventeen,
covertly  videotaped  nineteen-year-old  Respondent  Susan  Leigh  Kerr
engaging in sexual intercourse with him. Although not dating steadily,
they  had  known  each  other  a  few  months  and  had  shared  several
previous sexual encounters. Kerr testiﬁed that she had not had sexual
intercourse prior to her relationship with Boyles.

Kerr and Boyles, who were both home in Houston for the summer,
had made plans to go out on the night of the incident. Before picking
Kerr  up,  Boyles  arranged  with  a  friend,  Karl  Broesche,  to  use  the
Broesche house for sexual intercourse with Kerr. Broesche suggested
videotaping the activity, and Boyles agreed. Broesche and two friends,
Ray  Widner  and  John  Paul  Tamborello,  hid  a  camera  in  a  bedroom
before Kerr and Boyles arrived. After setting up the camera, the three
videotaped themselves making crude comments and jokes about the
activity that was to follow. They left with the camera running, and the
ensuing activities were recorded. Boyles took possession of the tape
shortly  after  it  was  made,  and  subsequently  showed  it  on  three

occasions, each time at a private residence. Although he showed the
tape  to  only  ten  friends,  gossip  about  the  incident  soon  spread
among  many  of  Kerr  and  Boyles’  friends  in  Houston.  Soon  many
students  at  Kerr’s  school,  Southwest  Texas  State  University,  and
Boyles’ school, the University of Texas at Austin, also became aware
of the story. Kerr did not learn of the video until December 1985, long
after  she  and  Boyles  had  stopped  seeing  each  other.  After  she
confronted  him,  Boyles  eventually  admitted  what  he  had  done  and
surrendered the tape to Kerr. No copies had been made.

Kerr  alleges  that  she  suffered  humiliation  and  severe  emotional
distress  from  the  videotape  and  the  gossip  surrounding  it.  At  social
gatherings,  friends  and  even  casual  acquaintances  would  approach
her and comment about the video, wanting to know “what [she] was
going  to  do”  or  “why  did  [she]  do  it.”  The  tape  stigmatized  Kerr  with
the reputation of “porno queen” among some of her friends, and she
claimed that the embarrassment and notoriety affected her academic
performance. Kerr also claimed that the incident made it difﬁcult for
her to relate to men, although she testiﬁed to having had subsequent
sexually-active  relationships.  Eventually,  she  sought  psychological
counseling.

Kerr  sued  Boyles,  Broesche,  Widner  and  Tamborello,  alleging
intentional  invasion  of  privacy,  negligent  invasion  of  privacy,  and
negligent (but not intentional) infliction of emotional distress. Before
the case was submitted to the jury, however, Kerr dropped all causes
of action except for negligent infliction of emotional distress. The jury
returned a verdict for Kerr on that claim, assessing $500,000 in actual
damages.  The  jury  also  found  that  all  defendants  were  grossly
negligent,  awarding  an  additional  $500,000  in  punitive  damages,
$350,000  of  which  was  assessed  against  Boyles.  The  trial  court
rendered judgment in accordance with the jury’s verdict. Only Boyles
appealed  to  the  court  of  appeals.  That  court  afﬁrmed  the  judgment
against  him,  concluding  that  Kerr  established  negligent  infliction  of
emotional distress under the facts of this case.

Initially,  we  must  determine  whether  negligent

infliction  of
emotional  distress  constitutes  an  independent  cause  of  action  in
Texas.  Kerr  claims  that  we  recognized  a  broad  right  to  recover  for
negligently  inflicted  emotional  distress  in  St.  Elizabeth  Hospital  v.
Garrard,  730  S.W.2d  649  (Tex.  1987).  Boyles  contends  that  the
Garrard holding is limited to the particular facts of that case.

In  Garrard,  a  hospital  negligently  disposed  of  the  Garrards’
stillborn  baby  in  an  unmarked,  common  grave  without  the  plaintiffs’
knowledge  or  consent.  The  Garrards  sued  for  negligent  infliction  of
emotional  distress,  without  alleging  that  they  suffered  any  physical
injury. This Court nonetheless concluded that they had stated a cause
of  action.  We  determined  that  “Texas  ﬁrst  recognized  the  tort  of
negligent  infliction  of  mental  anguish  in  Hill  v.  Kimball,  13  S.W.  59
(Tex.  1890).”  This  tort,  we  said,  had  been  administered  under
traditional tort concepts, subject only to a reﬁnement on the element
of  damages:  the  mental  suffering  is  not  compensable  unless  it
manifests  itself  physically.  Id.  After  determining  that  the  physical
manifestation  requirement  was  arbitrary  because  it  “denies  court
access to persons with valid claims they could prove if permitted to
do so,” id., we proceeded to abolish it.

The Court then proceeded, we believe, to create a general duty not

to inflict reasonably foreseeable emotional distress. The Court said:

Clearly,  freedom  from  severe  emotional  distress  is  an  interest  which  the  law
should  serve  to  protect.  .  .  .  Having  recognized  that  an  interest  merits
protection, it is the duty of this court to continually monitor the legal doctrines
of  this  state  to  insure  the  public  is  free  from  unwarranted  restrictions  on  the
right  to  seek  redress  for  wrongs  committed  against  them.  .  .  .  Thus,  we  hold
that  proof  of  physical  injury  resulting  from  mental  anguish  is  no  longer  an
element of the common law action for negligent infliction of mental anguish.

730  S.W.2d  at  653-54.  Four  justices  joined  in  the  judgment,  but
concurred  on  the  grounds  that  the  same  result  could  be  reached
under the traditional Texas rule allowing emotional distress damages

arising from the mishandling of a corpse. If the Court’s holding was,
as  Boyles  contends,  limited  to  the  mishandling  of  corpses,  the
concurring  opinion  would  not  need  to  have  been  written,  as  its
rationale would have been incorporated in the majority opinion.

While  the  holding  of  Garrard  was  correct,  we  conclude  that  its
reasoning was based on an erroneous interpretation of Hill v. Kimball,
and  is  out  of  step  with  most  American  jurisdictions.  Therefore,  we
overrule  the  language  of  Garrard  to  the  extent  that  it  recognizes  an
independent  right  to  recover  for  negligently  inflicted  emotional
distress.  Instead,  mental  anguish  damages  should  be  compensated
only  in  connection  with  defendant’s  breach  of  some  other  duty
imposed  by  law.  This  was  the  basis  for  recovery  prior  to  Garrard,
which expanded the scope of liability based on a misconstruction of
Hill v. Kimball.

In  Hill,  a  pregnant  woman  suffered  a  miscarriage  when  she
witnessed  the  defendant  severely  beating  two  men  in  her  yard.  The
woman sued for her physical injuries under negligence, claiming that
the  emotional  trauma  of  witnessing  the  beatings  produced  the
miscarriage  and  that  the  defendant  should  have  reasonably
anticipated  the  danger  to  her.  The  Court  found  that  the  plaintiff  had
stated a cause of action. The basis, however, was the physical injury
she  had  suffered,  together  with  her  allegation  of  foreseeability.  The
Court reasoned as follows:

That a physical personal injury may be produced through a strong emotion of
the  mind  there  can  be  no  doubt.  The  fact  that  it  is  more  difﬁcult  to  produce
such an injury through the operation of the mind than by direct physical means
affords  no  sufﬁcient  ground  for  refusing  compensation,  in  an  action  at  law,
when the injury is intentionally or negligently inflicted. . . . Here, according to the
allegations of the petition, the defendant has produced a bodily injury by means
of that emotion, and it is for that injury that the recovery is sought.

13 S.W. at 59.

The Court considered only whether the plaintiff could recover for
her physical injuries, not whether she could otherwise recover for her
emotional  distress  or  mental  anguish  caused  by  witnessing  the
beatings. Furthermore, the Court noted that liability would depend on
“whether, under the circumstances, and with the lights before him, a
reasonably prudent man would have anticipated the danger to her or
not.” Id. In other words, the defendant was negligent if he should have
known that he was imposing an unreasonable risk of physical injury
to  the  plaintiff,  not  if  he  merely  should  have  anticipated  that  the
plaintiff would suffer emotional distress.

injury

is  produced

Hill,  therefore,  did  not  recognize  a  cause  of  action  for  negligent
infliction  of  emotional  distress.  It  merely  recognized  the  right  to
recover  for  physical  injuries  under  standard  negligence  principles,
notwithstanding  that  the  physical
indirectly
through  emotional  trauma.  Garrard  thus  did  not  merely  modify  Hill,
but  created  an  entirely  new  cause  of  action.  Garrard,  however,  ill
deserves  the  lofty  pedestal  to  which  the  dissent  has  belatedly
elevated it. Even today, the justices of this Court cannot agree on the
extent  of  Garrard’s  reach  and  we  have  never  embraced  its  broad
holding. Thus, in Freeman v. City of Pasadena, 744 S.W.2d 923 (Tex.
1988),  we  limited  the  bystander  cause  of  action  to  those  persons
meeting  the  criteria  of  Dillon  v.  Legg,  68  Cal.  2d  728,  441  P.2d  912,
920,  69  Cal.  Rptr.  72  (Cal.  1968),  without  even  citing  Garrard  as  a
potential basis for broader liability.

Professor  Crump,  one  of  Boyles’  appellate  counsel,  has  argued
that  “it  is  important  .  .  .  not  to  lose  sight  of  the  contractual
relationship  between  hospital  and  patient  as  the  source  of  the
underlying  duty  [in  Garrard].”  David  Crump,  Evaluating  Independent
Torts Based upon “Intentional” or “Negligent” Infliction of Emotional
Distress:  How  Can  We  Keep  the  Baby  from  Dissolving  in  the  Bath
Water?, 34 Ariz. L. Rev. 439, 458 (1992).

Considering our opinions and those of other Texas courts, as well
as  the  law  in  most  American  jurisdictions,  Garrard  could  fairly  be

characterized as an anomaly rather than a landmark. We believe the
jurisprudence  of  our  state  is  better  served  by  overruling  Garrard ’s
broad language outright. . . .

By  overruling  the  language  of  Garrard,  we  hold  only  that  there  is
no  general  duty  not  to  negligently  inflict  emotional  distress.  Our
decision does not affect a claimant’s right to recover mental anguish
damages  caused  by  defendant’s  breach  of  some  other  legal  duty.
See,  e.g., Fisher  v. Coastal Transp. Co.,  230  S.W.2d  522  (Tex.  1950)
(negligent  infliction  of  direct  physical  injury);  Moore  v.  Lillebo,  722
S.W.2d  683  (Tex.  1986)  (wrongful  death);  Fisher  v.  Carrousel  Motor
Hotel,  Inc.,  424  S.W.2d  627  (Tex.  1967)  (battery);  Stuart  v.  Western
Union Tel. Co.,  66  Tex.  580,  18  S.W.  351  (1885)  (failure  of  telegraph
company  to  timely  deliver  death  message);  Billings v. Atkinson,  489
S.W.2d 858 (Tex. 1973) (invasion of privacy); Leyendecker & Assocs.,
Inc.  v.  Wechter,  683  S.W.2d  369  (Tex.  1984)  (defamation);  Pat  H.
Foley & Co. v. Wyatt, 442 S.W.2d 904 (Tex. Civ. App. — Houston [14th
Dist.] 1969, writ ref’d n.r.e.) (negligent handling of corpse).

Also, our holding does not affect the right of bystanders to recover
emotional  distress  damages  suffered  as  a  result  of  witnessing  a
serious  or  fatal  accident.  Texas  has  adopted  the  bystander  rules
originally  promulgated  by  the  California  Supreme  Court  in  Dillon  v.
Legg, 441 P.2d 912, 920 (Cal. 1968).

The  policy  concerns  that  require  limiting  the  emotional  distress
cause of action in the direct victim case generally do not apply in the
bystander  case.  Before  a  bystander  may  recover,  he  or  she  must
establish that the defendant has negligently inflicted serious or fatal
injuries on the primary victim.

We  emphasize  that  we  are  not  broadening  a  claimant’s  right  to
recover  mental  anguish  damages  caused  by  breach  of  a  particular
duty; we leave such right unaffected.

We  also  are  not  imposing  a  requirement  that  emotional  distress
manifest itself physically to be compensable. As explained in Garrard,

the  sole  purpose  of  the  physical  manifestation  rule  is  to  ensure  the
genuineness  of  claims  for  emotional  distress.  Garrard  criticized  this
requirement as both under- and overinclusive, id., and we agree. See
Julie  A.  Davies,  Direct  Actions  for  Emotional  Harm:  Is  Compromise
Possible?,  67  Wash.  L.  Rev.  1,  24-25
(the  physical
manifestation  rule  “has  been  criticized  on  the  ground  that  it  has  no
obvious  relation  to  emotional  harm”).  Where  emotional  distress  is  a
recognized  element  of  damages  for  breach  of  a  legal  duty,  the
claimant  may
recover  without  demonstrating  a  physical
manifestation of the emotional distress.

(1992)

Most  other  jurisdictions  do  not  recognize  a  general  duty  not  to
negligently  inflict  emotional  distress.  A  few  jurisdictions  recognize  a
general  right  to  recover  for  negligently  inflicted  emotional  distress,
but these jurisdictions are squarely in the minority.

We therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeals in favor

of Kerr on the ground of negligent infliction of emotional distress.

In  rejecting  negligent  infliction  of  emotional  distress  as  an
independent  cause  of  action,  we  stated  in  the  original  opinion  that
“tort law cannot and should not attempt to provide redress for every
instance  of  rude,  insensitive  or  distasteful  behavior,  even  though  it
may result in hurt feelings, embarrassment, or even humiliation.” We
made clear, however, that we did not consider Boyles’ conduct to fall
into that category, stating in part as follows:

The tort system can and does provide a remedy against those who engage in
such  conduct.  But  an  independent  cause  of  action  for  negligent  infliction  of
emotional  distress  would  encompass  conduct  far  less  outrageous  than  that
involved here, and such a broad tort is not necessary to allow compensation in
a truly egregious case such as this. (Emphasis supplied.)

We  denied  recovery  not  because  Boyles  breached  no  duty  toward
Kerr,  but  because  the  only  theory  which  she  chose  to  assert —
negligent  infliction  of  emotional  distress — was  overly  broad  and
would  encompass  other  cases  involving  merely  rude  or  insensitive

behavior.  We  reafﬁrm  that  conclusion  today.  [The  court  stated  that
Kerr  might  be  able  to  recover  instead  on  a  claim  for  intentional
infliction of emotional distress.]

Kerr cannot recover based on the cause of action under which she
proceeded.  It  may  well  be,  however,  that  she  failed  to  assert  and
preserve alternative causes of action because of her reliance on our
holding in Garrard. We have broad discretion to remand for a new trial
in  the  interest  of  justice  where  it  appears  that  a  party  may  have
proceeded  under  the  wrong  legal  theory.  Remand  is  particularly
appropriate  where  the  losing  party  may  have  presented  his  or  her
case  in  reliance  on  controlling  precedent  that  was  subsequently
overruled. We therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeals
and remand this cause to the trial court for a new trial.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Rejection of General Duty.  The court in Kerr repudiated the only
prior holding in that state to suggest a general duty of care to prevent
emotional  distress  exists.  Rather,  the  court  held  that  only  where  the
defendant  has  breached  some  other  independent  duty  might  a
recovery  for  emotional  distress  be  recognized.  Where  a  defendant
negligently  causes  physical  harm  this  is  rather  obvious.  With  regard
to  the  prior  decision  involving  the  careless  disposal  of  a  family
member’s  body,  the  court  clariﬁes  that  we  should  be  mindful  of  a
contractual  obligation’s  breach  as  being  the  cornerstone  of  the
it
emotional  distress  recovery.  Further,  the  court  states  that
recognizes  bystander  recovery  under  Dillon’s  requirements.  How
would an emotional distress recovery under Dillon be consistent with
this idea of there being a breach of an independent duty?

2.  Rejection  Consistent  with  Prior  Decision.   In  Temple-Inland,
seen earlier in Chapter 5 on Causation, the court rejected the effort by
the plaintiff to recover for his fear of contracting cancer in the future.

One reason for the court’s decision was its rejection of a general duty
not  to  negligently  inflict  emotional  distress  in  Kerr.  Do  you  see  the
connection between the two holdings?

3.  The  Rest  of  the  Story.   After  the  trial  in  Kerr,  defense  counsel
was  so  overjoyed  with  what  it  viewed  as  a  small  jury  verdict  for  the
plaintiff  that  it  held  a  party  to  celebrate.  Unfortunately,  at  the  party,
the  law  ﬁrm’s  staff  showed  the  video — despite  a  trial  court  order
prohibiting  such  action.  A  temporary  secretary  was  present  and
informed  opposing  counsel  and  the  court.  As  a  result,  the  law  ﬁrm
settled with Ms. Kerr for the additional sum of $600,000 for a release
from any liability of the ﬁrm for displaying the video. Would Ms. Kerr
have had a claim against the ﬁrm for negligent infliction of emotional
distress?  If  not,  what  claim,  if  any,  would  she  have  had?  Perhaps  a
claim  for  intentional  infliction  of  emotional  distress,  as  discussed  in
Chapter 2?

4. NIED vs. IIED.  The reluctance by courts to recognize a general
duty to avoid carelessly causing emotional distress to others makes
sense  when  you  consider  the  broader  torts  landscape.  In  Chapter  2,
we delved into the topic of intentional infliction of emotional distress.
You may recall that we saw the courts, while recognizing such a new
claim,  eager  to  create  fairly  high  thresholds  to  recovery  to  avoid
permitting  too  many  claims  for  trivial  matters.  These  barriers  to
recovery included: (1) the need for a defendant’s “fault” to rise beyond
negligence to either recklessness or intentional infliction of emotional
distress; (2) outrageous conduct; and (3) conduct resulting in “severe”
emotional distress — something beyond transient or trivial distress. It
would make no sense to erect such barriers to recovery for the tort of
IIED  and  then  recognize  a  general  duty  to  avoid  carelessly  causing
emotional  distress.  Viewed  this  way,  the  court’s  decision  in  Kerr  is
very predictable.

B. “Mere” Economic Harm

intangible  nature  of  emotional  distress
After  confronting  the
damages and seeing the courts’ reluctance to allow recovery for them
as  the  primary  harm  in  a  negligence  suit,  one  would  think  that
ﬁnancial  losses  would  be  viewed  differently.  In  fact,  courts  are
similarly reluctant to impose a duty of care on actors to avoid causing
economic loss to others. As you read the following case, compare the
nature  of  economic  loss  with  emotional  distress  and  the  courts’
reaction to imposing a duty of care regarding the avoidance of such
economic damage.

532 MADISON AVENUE GOURMET FOODS v.
FINLANDIA CENTER, INC.
750 N.E.2d 1097 (N.Y. 2001)

    , C.J.

The  novel

issues  raised  by  these  appeals — arising

from
construction-related  disasters  in  midtown  Manhattan — concern  a
landholder’s  duty  in  negligence  where  plaintiffs’  sole  injury  is  lost
income. . . .

Two of the three appeals involve the same event. On December 7,
1997, a section of the south wall of 540 Madison Avenue, a 39-story
ofﬁce tower, partially collapsed and bricks, mortar and other material
fell onto Madison Avenue at 55th Street, a prime commercial location
crammed with stores and skyscrapers. The collapse occurred after a
construction  project,  which  included  putting  94  holes  for  windows
into  the  building’s  south  wall,  aggravated  existing  structural  defects.
New  York  City  ofﬁcials  directed  the  closure  of  15  heavily  trafﬁcked
blocks  on  Madison  Avenue — from  42nd  to  57th  Street — as  well  as
adjacent  side  streets  between  Fifth  and  Park  Avenues.  The  closure
lasted for approximately two weeks, but some businesses nearest to
540 Madison remained closed for a longer period.

In  532  Madison  Ave.  Gourmet  Foods  v.  Finlandia  Ctr.,  plaintiff
operates a 24-hour delicatessen one-half block south of 540 Madison,
and  was  closed  for  ﬁve  weeks.  The  two  named  plaintiffs  in  the
companion  case,  5th  Ave.  Chocolatiere  v.  540  Acquisition  Co.,  are
retailers at 510 Madison Avenue, two blocks from the building, suing
on  behalf  of  themselves  and  a  putative  class  of  “all  other  business
entities,  in  whatever  form,  including  but  not  limited  to  corporations,
partnerships  and  sole  proprietorships,  located  in  the  Borough  of
Manhattan and bounded geographically on the west by Fifth Avenue,
on  the  east  by  Park  Avenue,  on  the  north  by  57th  Street  and  on  the
South by 42nd Street.” Plaintiffs allege that shoppers and others were
unable to gain access to their stores during the time Madison Avenue
was closed to trafﬁc. Defendants in both cases are Finlandia Center
(the  building  owner),  540  Acquisition  Company  (the  ground  lessee)
and Manhattan Paciﬁc Management (the managing agent).

On defendants’ motions in both cases, Supreme Court dismissed
plaintiffs’  negligence  claims  on  the  ground  that  they  could  not
establish  that  defendants  owed  a  duty  of  care  for  purely  economic
loss in the absence of personal injury or property damage. . . .

Goldberg Weprin & Ustin v. Tishman Constr. involves the July 21,
1998 collapse of a 48-story construction elevator tower on West 43rd
Street  between  Sixth  and  Seventh  Avenues — the  heart  of  bustling
Times  Square.  Immediately  after  the  accident,  the  City  prohibited  all
trafﬁc  in  a  wide  area  of  midtown  Manhattan  and  also  evacuated

nearby  buildings  for  varying  time  periods.  Three  actions  were
consolidated — one by a law ﬁrm, a second by a public relations ﬁrm
and a third by a clothing manufacturer, all situated within the affected
area. Plaintiff law ﬁrm sought damages for economic loss on behalf
of  itself  and  a  proposed  class  “of  all  persons  in  the  vicinity  of
Broadway  and  42nd  Street,  New  York,  New  York,  whose  businesses
were  affected  and/or  caused  to  be  closed”  as  well  as  a  subclass  of
area residents who were evacuated from their homes.

Noting  the  enormity  of  the  liability  sought,  including  recovery  by
putative  plaintiffs  as  diverse  as  hot  dog  vendors,  taxi  drivers  and
Broadway  productions,  Supreme  Court  concluded  that  the  failure  to
allege  personal
in
negligence.

injury  or  property  damage  barred  recovery

The Appellate Division afﬁrmed dismissal of the Goldberg Weprin
complaint, concluding that, absent property damage, the connection
between  defendants’  activities  and  the  economic  losses  of  the
purported  class  of  plaintiffs  was  “too  tenuous  and  remote  to  permit
recovery  on  any  tort  theory.”  The  court,  however,  reinstated  the
negligence and public nuisance claims of plaintiffs 532 Madison and
5th  Ave.  Chocolatiere,  holding  that  defendants’  duty  to  keep  their
premises in reasonably safe condition extended to “those businesses
in such close proximity that their negligent acts could be reasonably
foreseen  to  cause  injury”  (which  included  the  named  merchant
plaintiffs) and that, as such, they established a special injury distinct
from  the  general  inconvenience  to  the  community  at  large.  Two
Justices  dissented,  urging  application  of  the  “economic  loss”  rule,
which  bars  recovery  in  negligence  for  economic  damage  absent
personal injury or property damage.

We  now  reverse  in  532  Madison  and  5th  Ave.  Chocolatiere  and

afﬁrm in Goldberg Weprin & Ustin.

Plaintiffs contend that defendants owe them a duty to keep their
premises in reasonably safe condition, and that this duty extends to

protection  against  economic  loss  even  in  the  absence  of  personal
injury  or  property  damage.  Defendants  counter  that  the  absence  of
any  personal  injury  or  property  damage  precludes  plaintiffs’  claims
for economic injury.

The existence and scope of a tortfeasor’s duty is, of course, a legal
question for the courts, which “ﬁx the duty point by balancing factors,
including  the  reasonable  expectations  of  parties  and  society
generally,  the  proliferation  of  claims,  the  likelihood  of  unlimited  or
insurer-like  liability,  disproportionate  risk  and  reparation  allocation,
and  public  policies  affecting  the  expansion  or  limitation  of  new
channels of liability” (Hamilton v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., 96 N.Y.2d 222,
232 [quoting Palka v. Servicemaster Mgt. Servs. Corp., 83 N.Y.2d 579,
586]).  At  its  foundation,  the  common  law  of  torts  is  a  means  of
apportioning risks and allocating the burden of loss. In drawing lines
deﬁning actionable duty, courts must therefore always be mindful of
the consequential, and precedential, effects of their decisions.

As  we  have  many  times  noted,  foreseeability  of  harm  does  not
deﬁne duty. Absent a duty running directly to the injured person there
can  be  no  liability  in  damages,  however  careless  the  conduct  or
foreseeable the harm. This restriction is necessary to avoid exposing
defendants to unlimited liability to an indeterminate class of persons
conceivably injured by any negligence in a defendant’s act.

A  duty  may  arise  from  a  special  relationship  that  requires  the
defendant to protect against the risk of harm to plaintiff. Landowners,
for example, have a duty to protect tenants, patrons and invitees from
foreseeable harm caused by the criminal conduct of others while they
are  on  the  premises,  because  the  special  relationship  puts  them  in
the best position to protect against the risk. That duty, however, does
not  extend  to  members  of  the  general  public.  Liability  is  in  this  way
circumscribed,  because  the  special  relationship  deﬁnes  the  class  of
potential plaintiffs to whom the duty is owed.

In  Strauss  v.  Belle  Realty  Co.  (65  N.Y.2d  399)  we  considered
whether  a  utility  owed  a  duty  to  a  plaintiff  injured  in  a  fall  on  a
darkened staircase during a citywide blackout. While the injuries were
logically  foreseeable,  there  was  no  contractual  relationship  between
the plaintiff and the utility for lighting in the building’s common areas.
As a matter of policy, we restricted liability for damages in negligence
to direct customers of the utility in order to avoid crushing exposure
to the suits of millions of electricity consumers in New York City and
Westchester.

Even  closer  to  the  mark  is  Milliken  &  Co. v. Consolidated Edison
Co. (84 N.Y.2d 469), in which an underground water main burst near
38th  Street  and  7th  Avenue  in  Manhattan.  The  waters  flooded  a
subbasement  where  Consolidated  Edison  maintained  an  electricity
supply  substation,  and  then  a  ﬁre  broke  out,  causing  extensive
damage  that  disrupted  the  flow  of  electricity  to  the  Manhattan
interrupting  the  biannual  Buyers  Week.
Garment  Center  and
Approximately  200  Garment  Center  businesses  brought  more  than
50  lawsuits  against  Con  Edison,  including  plaintiffs  who  had  no
contractual  relationship  with  the  utility  and  who  sought  damages
solely for economic loss. Relying on Strauss, we again held that only
those  persons  contracting  with  the  utility  could  state  a  cause  of
action.  We  circumscribed  the  ambit  of  duty  to  avoid  limitless
exposure  to  the  potential  suits  of  every  tenant  in  the  skyscrapers
embodying the urban skyline.

A  landowner  who  engages  in  activities  that  may  cause  injury  to
persons  on  adjoining  premises  surely  owes  those  persons  a  duty  to
take  reasonable  precautions  to  avoid  injuring  them.  We  have  never
held,  however,  that  a  landowner  owes  a  duty  to  protect  an  entire
urban  neighborhood  against  purely  economic  losses.  A  comparison
of Beck v. FMC Corp. (53 A.D.2d 118, 121, aff’d 42 N.Y.2d 1027)  and
Dunlop Tire & Rubber Corp. v. FMC Corp. (53 A.D.2d 150, 154-155) is
instructive. Those cases arose out of the same incident: an explosion
at  defendant  FMC’s  chemical  manufacturing  plant  caused  physical

vibrations,  and  rained  stones  and  debris  onto  plaintiff  Dunlop  Tire’s
nearby factory. The blast also caused a loss of electrical power — by
destroying  towers  and  distribution  lines  owned  by  a  utility — to  both
Dunlop  Tire  and  a  Chevrolet  plant  located  one  and  one-half  miles
away.  Both  establishments  suffered  temporary  closure  after  the
accident.  Plaintiffs  in  Beck  were  employees  of  the  Chevrolet  plant
who  sought  damages  for  lost  wages  caused  by  the  plant  closure.
Plaintiff Dunlop Tire sought recovery for property damage emanating
from  the  blast  and  the  loss  of  energy,  and  lost  proﬁts  sustained
during the shutdown.

In Dunlop Tire, the Appellate Division observed that, although part
of  the  damage  occurred  from  the  loss  of  electricity  and  part  from
to  plaintiffs  was
direct  physical  contact,  defendant’s  duty
undiminished.  The  court  permitted  plaintiffs  to  seek  damages  for
economic  loss,  subject  to  the  general  rule  requiring  proof  of  the
extent  of  the  damage  and  the  causal  relationship  between  the
negligence  and  the  damage.  The  Beck  plaintiffs,  by  contrast,  could
not  state  a  cause  of  action,  because,  to  extend  a  duty  to  defendant
FMC would, “like the rippling of the waters, [go] far beyond the zone of
danger  of  the  explosion,”  to  everyone  who  suffered  purely  economic
loss (Beck v. FMC Corp., 53 A.D.2d, at 121, supra).

Policy-driven  line-drawing  is  to  an  extent  arbitrary  because,
wherever  the  line  is  drawn,  invariably  it  cuts  off  liability  to  persons
who  foreseeably  might  be  plaintiffs.  The  Goldberg Weprin  class,  for
example,  would  include  all  persons  in  the  vicinity  of  Times  Square
whose businesses had to be closed and a subclass of area residents
evacuated  from  their  homes;  the  5th  Ave.  Chocolatiere  class  would
include all business entities between 42nd and 57th Streets and Fifth
and Park Avenues. While the Appellate Division attempted to draw a
careful boundary at storefront merchant-neighbors who suffered lost
income, that line excludes others similarly affected by the closures —
such as the law ﬁrm, public relations ﬁrm, clothing manufacturer and
other  displaced  plaintiffs  in  Goldberg  Weprin,  the  thousands  of

professional,  commercial  and  residential  tenants  situated  in  the
towers  surrounding  the  named  plaintiffs,  and  suppliers  and  service
providers unable to reach the densely populated New York City blocks
at issue in each case.

As  is  readily  apparent,  an  indeterminate  group  in  the  affected
areas  thus  may  have  provable  ﬁnancial  losses  directly  traceable  to
the  two  construction-related  collapses,  with  no  satisfactory  way
geographically to distinguish among those who have suffered purely
economic  losses.  In  such  circumstances,  limiting  the  scope  of
defendants’  duty  to  those  who  have,  as  a  result  of  these  events,
suffered  personal  injury  or  property  damage — as  historically  courts
have  done — affords  a  principled  basis  for  reasonably  apportioning
liability.

We therefore conclude that plaintiffs’ negligence claims based on
economic loss alone fall beyond the scope of the duty owed them by
defendants and should be dismissed.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

loss  alone  (“mere  economic

1.  Mere  Economic  Loss  and  Emotional  Distress.   Like  emotional
distress,  courts  have  generally  held  that  there  is  no  duty  to  avoid
causing  economic
loss”).  In  both
instances,  the  absence  of  physical  harm  to  the  plaintiff  or  the
plaintiff’s tangible property raises concern as to both the authenticity
of the loss and the potential for unlimited liability far in excess of any
wrongdoing.  The  requirement  for  physical  harm  as  a  general
prerequisite to recovery of either type of damage certainly provides a
bright line for when a court will impose a duty of care.

2. Imposing a Duty Only with Hindsight.  The mere economic loss
rule says to the tortfeasor, in effect, that a duty of care will only arise
when  the  negligence  causes  some  physical  harm.  Until  the  tort  is
carried out, one cannot gauge whether the actor was under any duty

of  care.  It  is  only  with  hindsight,  when  we  can  look  at  the  ripples  of
harm, that we can determine whether any duty of care was owed.

3. Problems.  Consider the application of the mere economic loss

rule to the following circumstances:

A.  A  professional  soccer  team  had  a  goalie  under  contract  who
was  hurt  in  an  automobile  accident  caused  by  the  defendant
driver.  The  team  had  to  pay  additional  money  to  a  substitute
goalie for the duration of the season. The team sues the driver
for their losses.

B.  Among  the  areas  closed  to  trafﬁc  following  the  collapse  of  the
building  in  the  Finlandia  case  is  a  little  travel  bookshop  with  a
blue  door.  During  the  accident  to  the  tower,  one  of  the  bricks
bounces  across  the  street  and  hits  this  blue  door  causing  a
scratch.  The  owner  of  the  bookshop  pays  $1.95  to  purchase
some  paint  to  touch  up  the  door.  His  shop  is  also  closed  for  a
signiﬁcant  time,  due  to  the  police  closing  down  the  street  on
which  it  sits,  and  he  loses  $15,000  in  lost  sales.  He  sues  for
$15,001.95 in damages.

C. English Petroleum (“EP”) maintains an offshore drilling rig in the
Gulf of Mexico. The crew working on the rig fails to maintain the
rig properly and an explosion ensues, followed by a massive oil
spill.  EP  fails  to  respond  appropriately  to  the  spill  and  the
environmental  pollution  extends  to  beaches,  wetlands,  and
estuaries all along the Gulf Coast. Not only are property owners
impacted by the pollution, but also many other business owners
in  the  area  suffer  business  losses.  For  example,  numerous
seafood  restaurants  have  trouble  obtaining
locally  caught
shrimp,  lose  customers,  and  go  out  of  business.  Local  bait
shops,  boat  charters,  and  even  wedding  planners  lose  money
from the oil spill. They sue for these losses.

4.  Special  Relationships  Altering  Mere  Economic  Loss  Rule.   In
certain  situations  courts  do  not  anticipate  there  being  any  physical
harm  caused  by  a  defendant’s  negligence  but  still  permit  recovery.

For  example,  in  most  legal  or  accounting  malpractice  cases  the
entirety  of  the  harm  is  economic.  Courts  do  not  have  difﬁculty
recognizing  a  duty  of  care  owed  by  the  professional  toward  their
client,  notwithstanding  the  mere  economic  harm  rule.  The  special
relationship  trumps  the  concerns  of  the  mere  economic  harm  rule.
Sometimes,  even  outside  the  professional-client  relationship,  courts
will  permit  a  claim  for  economic  losses  to  be  made  against  such  a
professional  (e.g.,  an  accountant  who  gives  a  poor  ﬁnancial  report
relied upon by a bank to extend a loan). In this scenario, courts have
fashioned  special  rules  related  to  whether  one  without  privity  of
contract  can  still  maintain  a  cause  of  action.  In  this  non-physical
scenario,  however,  courts  rarely  concern  themselves  with  the  mere
economic harm rule.

5.  Fishermen.   There  are  a  number  of  reported  cases  involving
ﬁshermen who have lost proﬁts associated with the defendant having
caused physical harm to someone else (e.g., the owner of the boats
utilized  by  the  ﬁshermen).  Courts  tend  to  treat  the  ﬁshermen  as  a
special  class  of  claimants  and  avoid  application  of  the  mere
economic harm rule to their claims, as a limited exception to this rule.
This  exception  seems  to  reflect  traditional  sympathy  for  such
plaintiffs rather than any conceptual distinction.

C. Wrongful Pregnancy, Wrongful Life, and Wrongful

Birth

There  are  related  causes  of  action  when  there  are  unwanted
pregnancies  or  births  for  which  the  defendant  doctor’s  malpractice
was  a  but-for  cause.  Courts  dealing  with  these  type  of  cases  have
had to come up with special rules either limiting recovery or refusing
to recognize a duty of care based upon the unique nature of the harm
alleged.  Pay  close  attention  to  the  difference  between  the  claimant

and  the  claimed  harm  for  wrongful  pregnancy,  wrongful  birth,  and
wrongful life.

1. Wrongful Pregnancy

JOHNSON v. UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS OF
CLEVELAND
540 N.E.2d 1370 (Ohio 1989)

[Plaintiff  Ruth  Johnson  sued  defendant  University  Hospitals  of
Cleveland and three doctors for their negligence in performing a tubal
ligation for sterilization purposes. Due to their negligence, the plaintiff
became pregnant and gave birth to a healthy baby girl. Plaintiff’s suit
for  negligence  seeks  damages  for  pain  and  suffering  from  the
pregnancy  and  birth,  the  medical  bills  related  to  her  pregnancy  and
giving birth, and the lifetime child-rearing expenses anticipated for her
daughter. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the plaintiff of
$12,500,  which  was  the  cost  associated  with  her  pain  and  suffering
and  the  medical  expenses.  The  court  denied  any  recovery  for  the
costs  of  raising  her  daughter.  The  court  of  appeals  held  that  Ohio
recognizes  a  claim  for  wrongful  pregnancy  but  limited  the  costs  to
“damages arising from the pregnancy itself . . . delivery fees, prenatal
care, loss of spousal consortium and services during pregnancy, pain
and suffering during pregnancy and child birth, etc.” The court upheld
the trial court’s refusal to permit damages for the expenses of raising
a  healthy  child  because  such  award  would  ignore  the  beneﬁt  the
parents  receive  from  the  joys  of  raising  a  child — the  court  holding
that, as a matter of law, these beneﬁts outweigh the ﬁnancial burdens
of parenting. Further the court held that it would be a windfall to the
parents  to  make  the  defendant  pay  these  costs.  Finally,  the  court

found  that  the  costs  of  raising  the  daughter  were  too  speculative  to
permit recovery. Plaintiff appeals from this decision.]

       , J.

The  issue  raised  in  this  case  is  whether  the  parent  of  a  healthy,
normal child, born subsequent to a negligently performed sterilization
operation,  may  recover,  as  an  element  of  damages,  the  expenses  of
raising the child.

in  other

Numerous  cases

jurisdictions  have  been  reported
concerning  the  type  of  action  before  us.  These  cases  have  been
variously  classiﬁed  as  “wrongful  pregnancy,”  “wrongful  birth,”  or
“wrongful  life.”  However,  a  consensus  appears  to  be  emerging  that
several  distinct  causes  of  action  are  described  in  these  categories.
Smith v. Gore (Tenn. 1987), 728 S.W.2d 738, 741.

An action for “wrongful pregnancy” refers to a suit ﬁled by a parent
for proximate damages arising from the birth of a child subsequent to
a  doctor’s  failure  to  properly  perform  a  sterilization  procedure.  The
case before us now is a “wrongful pregnancy” action.

“Wrongful  birth,”  on  the  other  hand,  refers  to  a  cause  of  action
whereby  parents,  on  their  own  behalf,  seek  to  recover  damages  for
the  birth  of  an  impaired  child  when  the  impairment  was  caused  by
the defendant’s failure to diagnose or discover a genetic defect in the
parents  or  the  infant  through  prenatal  testing  or  counseling  in  time
for  the  parent  to  obtain  a  eugenic  abortion  or  to  prevent  pregnancy
altogether.

[There is also a “wrongful life” action that a child might attempt to
bring,  complaining  that  the  doctor’s  negligence  caused  his  birth  and
that he would have been better off not to have been born.]

This  court  in  Bowman,  a  ﬁve-to-two  per  curiam  decision,  clearly
decided  that  Ohio  recognizes  a  “wrongful  pregnancy”  action.  Such  a
cause  is  “not  barred  by  notions  of  public  policy.  The  choice  not  to
procreate,  as  part  of  one’s  right  to  privacy,  has  become  (subject  to

certain  limitations)  a  Constitutional  guarantee.”  Bowman  at  46,  2
O.O.3d at 135, 356 N.E.2d at 499.

Bowman  did  not  directly  address  the  measure  of  damages  in  a

“wrongful pregnancy” action.

Thus,  whether  child-rearing  expenses  are  recoverable

in  a
“wrongful pregnancy” action in Ohio is a question of ﬁrst impression.
Numerous  jurisdictions  have  already  addressed  this  issue  and  four
theories  of  recovery  of  damages  in  a  “wrongful  pregnancy”  action
have developed. We will review these four theories.

NO RECOVERY

When  cases  of  this  kind  were  ﬁrst  brought  in  the  United  States,
courts were hesitant to recognize any cause of action at all. An early
case, Christensen v. Thornby  (1934),  255  N.W.  620,  involved  a  failed
vasectomy.  The  Minnesota  Supreme  Court  denied  any  recovery  in
that case. Subsequently, in Shaheen v. Knight (1957), 11 Pa. D. & C.2d
41, a Pennsylvania common pleas court held that to permit damages
for  the  birth  of  a  healthy  child  was  foreign  to  the  popular  sentiment
regarding  children  and  the  family.  Both  of  these  jurisdictions  now
recognize an action for “wrongful pregnancy.”

Recently, at least one other court has taken the position that the
birth  of  a  normal  child  is  “an  event  which,  of  itself,  is  not  a  legally
compensable  injurious  consequence  even  if  the  birth  is  partially
attributable  to  the  negligent  conduct  of  someone  purporting  to  be
able  to  prevent  the  eventuality  of  childbirth.”  Szekeres  v.  Robinson
(Nev. 1986), 715 P.2d 1076, 1078. Thus, Nevada is currently the only
jurisdiction to adhere to this absolute position of no tort recovery in a
“wrongful pregnancy” action, at least when a normal, healthy child is
born.

THE BENEFITS RULE

jurisdictions  recognize  that  an  uninterrupted  chain  of
Several
causation  exists  between  a  negligently  performed  sterilization
procedure  and  the  foreseeable  consequences  of  the  conception,
pregnancy  and  birth  of  a  normal  child.  C.S.  v.  Nielson  (Utah  1988),
767 P.2d 504, 510-511.

Thus,  these  courts  believe  that  “it  must  be  recognized  that
[rearing] costs are a direct ﬁnancial injury to the parents, no different
in  immediate  effect  than  the  medical  expenses  resulting  from  the
wrongful conception and birth of the child. Although public sentiment
may recognize that to the vast majority of parents the long-term and
enduring  beneﬁts  of  parenthood  outweigh  the  economic  costs  of
rearing  a  healthy  child,  it  would  seem  myopic  to  declare  today  that
those  beneﬁts  exceed  the  costs  as  a  matter  of  law.”  Sherlock  v.
Stillwater Clinic (Minn. 1977), 260 N.W.2d 169, 175.

[Courts  adhering  to  the  beneﬁts  rule  permit]  the  jury  to  calculate
the  economic  cost  of  child  rearing  by  weighing  the  expense  against
the  worth  of  the  child’s  companionship,  comfort  and  aid  to  the
parents [opining that] the calculations of the cost of child rearing are
based on well-recognized economic factors regularly made by estate
planners  and  insurance  companies  and  are  fully  appreciated  by  the
average citizen’s own family experience.

However,  this  approach  has  been  criticized  as  essentially
comparing apples to oranges because it requires the jury to compare
pecuniary  costs  with  non-pecuniary  beneﬁts  and  then  offset  the
economic costs of child rearing with these intangible beneﬁts.

LIMITED DAMAGES

The  vast  majority  of  jurisdictions  which  have  decided  the  issue
adheres  to  this  theory  of  damages  which  denies  all  child-rearing
expenses.  Refusal  to  permit  recovery  has  been  based  upon  various
considerations:

1. A parent cannot be said to have been damaged by the birth of a
normal, healthy child because the beneﬁts of having a child outweigh
any  economic  loss  which  the  parents  might  incur  in  rearing  and
educating a healthy child.

2. Child-rearing expenses will be a windfall to the parents, wholly

disproportionate to the doctor’s culpability.

3. Another rationale is that the cost of child-rearing would be too

speculative to measure with any certainty.

“[I]t  seems  to  us  that  that  kind  of  judgment  [recovery  for  child-
rearing costs], if appropriate at all in an American Court of law, might
be  applied  at  the  end  of  a  life,  after  it  has  been  lived  and  when  the
facts can be identiﬁed. But, in our view, any attempt to apply it at birth
can  only  be  an  exercise  in  prophecy,  an  undertaking  not  within  the
speciality  of  our  factﬁnders.”  Coleman  v.  Garrison  (Del.  1975),  349
A.2d 8, 12.

4. Recovery should be denied to protect the mental and emotional
health  of  the  child,  sometimes  harshly  described  as  an  “emotional
bastard.”

Courts are concerned that if they grant child-rearing costs to the
parents  in  a  “wrongful  pregnancy”  case,  that  one  day  the  child  will
learn that he or she was not only unwanted by his or her parents, but
was  reared  by  funds  supplied  by  another  person,  and  that  this  will
greatly upset the child.

5. Damages for a “wrongful pregnancy” action should not include
child-rearing costs since to allow damages would be the equivalent of
allowing damages in an action for “wrongful life.”

FULL RECOVERY

This  rule  has  little,  if  any,  support.  However,  at  least  one  court
considers  Custodio  v.  Bauer  (1967),  251  Cal.  App.  2d  303,  59  Cal.
Rptr. 463, to be a full recovery case. See Smith v. Gore, supra, at 742.
in  Custodio,  applying  general  tort
A  California  appellate  court

principles, found that a child is a foreseeable consequence of a failed
sterilization  procedure  and  stated  that  if  a  “change  in  the  family
status  can  be  measured  economically  it  should  be  as  compensable
as  the  [other]  losses.”  Custodio,  supra,  at  323-324,  59  Cal.  Rptr.  at
476.

Appellant argues that she is entitled to a full recovery because all
the  expenses  for  child  support  are  foreseeable  and  proximately
caused by the negligent sterilization.

In  regard  to  the  extent  of  damages,  a  number  of  courts  have
discussed  the  reasonableness  of  the  alternatives  to  rearing  a  child,
i.e., an abortion or adoption, as part of the duty to mitigate.

Appellees  have  contended  that  if  this  court  adopts  the  tort
beneﬁts rule, parents would have to mitigate their damages for child
rearing  by  adoption  or  abortion.  Appellees  further  argue  that  if  the
parents choose neither to abort nor adopt and instead keep the child,
the jury would have to take this lack of mitigation into consideration
when calculating child-rearing expenses.

We  refuse  to  say  as  a  matter  of  law  that  every  parent  must
mitigate damages by abortion or adoption as a “reasonable effort” to
avoid  child-rearing  expenses.  In  fact,  we  ﬁnd  either  suggestion
repugnant. Many people would be opposed to either recourse. Thus,
in  a  “wrongful  pregnancy”  action,  the  mother  need  not  mitigate
damages  by  abortion  or  adoption  since  a  tort  victim  has  no  duty  to
make  unreasonable  efforts  to  diminish  or  avoid  prospective
damages.

We come now to decide which course of action is best for Ohio. In
doing  so,  we  comment  that  this  has  been  one  of  the  most  difﬁcult
cases  we  have  been  called  upon  to  decide.  Our  occupational  duty
continuously  requires  us  to  balance  rights  and  responsibilities  of
persons  regardless  of  their  color,  sex,  position  or  station  in  life.  We
accomplish  that  balancing  in  this  case  while  recognizing  that  our
decision will be something less than universally accepted.

We  reject  the  “no  recovery”  rule  as  being  one  that  is  clearly  in
conflict with the traditional concepts of tort law. Certainly, in the case
now before us, there was a duty and a breach of that duty which was
the proximate cause of damage. What damages should be allowed is
the more difﬁcult question.

Likewise, we are opposed to following the beneﬁts rule because of
the impossibility of a jury placing a price tag on a child’s beneﬁts to
her parents. We are not in the business of placing a value on a smile
or  quantifying  the  negative  impact  of  a  temper  tantrum.  We  are  not
qualiﬁed  to  judge  whether  a  child  might  become  President  or  a
hopeless  derelict.  We  cannot  pretend  to  know  what  the  future  may
hold — and neither can or may a jury!

Furthermore, we are not persuaded to adopt the full recovery rule
because the strict rules of tort should not be applied to an action to
which  they  are  not  suited,  such  as  a  wrongful  pregnancy  case,  in
which a doctor’s tortious conduct permits to occur the birth of a child
rather than the causing of an injury.

After  reviewing  the  four  theories  of  recovery,  we  ﬁnd  the  limited
damages theory is the most persuasive rule. Allowing a jury to award
child-rearing costs would be to invite unduly speculative and ethically
questionable assessments of such matters as the emotional effect of
a birth on siblings as well as parents, and the emotional as well as the
pecuniary costs of raising an unplanned and, perhaps, unwanted child
in varying family environments.

Additionally,  these  speculative  expenses  for  child  rearing  in  a
“wrongful pregnancy” action were not recognized at common law, just
as  damages  were  not  recognized  in  an  action  for  “wrongful  death.”
We believe that if such expenses are to be recognized, it is the role of
in  a  “wrongful
the  General  Assembly  to  establish  guidelines
pregnancy” action as the legislature has done in allowing damages in
“wrongful death” actions.

Thus,  in  a  “wrongful  pregnancy”  action,  Ohio  recognizes  the
“limited  damages”  rule  which  limits  the  damages  to  the  pregnancy
itself  and  does  not  include  child-rearing  expenses.  The  extent  of
recoverable  damages  is  limited  by  Ohio’s  public  policy  that  the  birth
of a normal, healthy child cannot be an injury to her parents.

We  are  aware  of  the  possible  hardships  that  might  result  from
today’s  decision  and  we  are  not  blind  to  the  economic  realities  that
accompany  the  rearing  of  a  child.  However,  if  liability  is  to  be
extended  in  such  cases  to  child-rearing  expenses,  then  the  General
Assembly  is  the  proper  forum  in  which  the  competing  social
philosophies  involved  in  “wrongful  pregnancy”  actions  should  be
considered in establishing the law.

Accordingly, based on the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the

court of appeals is afﬁrmed.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Wrongful  Pregnancy.   The  majority  of  courts  that  recognize  a
claim for wrongful pregnancy limit the damages to prenatal medical
expenses.  But  courts  have  expressed  a  wide  variety  of  views
regarding the available damage and pain awards, from no recovery to
a full, unlimited recovery for the costs of raising of the child. Why did
the  foregoing  court  choose  the  limited  recovery  and  reject  the  other
views?

2. Defensive  Practice  of  Medicine.   If  medical  practitioners  faced
liability for the costs of raising unwanted children in helping parents
with  their  family  planning  medical  care,  what  would  be  the
repercussions of the costs and availability of such services, if any?

3.  Problem.   If  a  couple  undergoes  a  sterilization  procedure  to
avoid  having  another  child  and  the  doctor  negligently  performs  the
procedure  resulting  in  an  unwanted  pregnancy,  may  the  couple
recover the medical costs of the abortion and for emotional distress

associated  with  the  unwanted  pregnancy  and  abortion?  Does  the
answer depend upon which jurisdiction’s rules apply?

2. Wrongful Birth and Wrongful Life

The prior case involving wrongful pregnancy dealt with the birth of a
healthy child. Even though not desired, the court had to contend with
whether  the  birth  was  a  cause  of  action  or  a  cause  for  celebration.
The next case deals with a very different problem. The plaintiffs gave
birth to a child who, but for the defendant doctor’s alleged negligence,
would  have  never  been  born.  The  child  is  born  with  severe  birth
defects  and  the  parents  alleged  they  would  have  aborted  the  child
had  they  been  properly  advised  of  the  birth  defects.  Notice  that
parents bring both a claim on their own behalf and a claim on behalf
of their disabled son. The courts treat these claims differently — can
you see why?

NELSON v. KRUSEN
678 S.W.2d 918 (Tex. 1984)

[Plaintiffs Tom and Gloria Nelson brought a wrongful birth suit in their
own  behalf  and  a  wrongful  life  suit  as  next  friends  of  Mark  Nelson,
their  minor  son,  against  Dr.  Edward  Krusen  and  Baylor  University
Medical Center. Plaintiffs alleged Dr. Krusen was negligent in advising
them  that  Mrs.  Nelson  was  not  a  genetic  carrier  of  muscular
dystrophy  and  was  no  more  likely  than  any  other  woman  to  have  a
child  afflicted  by  the  disease.  Plaintiffs  contend  that  had  the
defendant given them the proper advice, they would have terminated
the pregnancy.

According  to  the  summary  judgment  evidence,  the  Nelsons
already  had  one  child  with  muscular  dystrophy  when  they  learned

Mrs.  Nelson  was  pregnant  again.  They  consulted  defendant  Krusen
seeking  to  determine  if  Mrs.  Nelson  was  a  genetic  carrier  of  the
disease.  Dr.  Krusen  advised  them  that  she  was  not  a  carrier  and  so
they proceeded with her pregnancy. Mark Nelson was born in 1976. In
1979  they  began  to  notice  tight  heel  cords  bilaterally.  A  pediatric
neurologist  then  conﬁrmed  that  Mark  Nelson  had  muscular
dystrophy.  Plaintiffs  contend  that  the  defendant  Krusen  committed
negligence in giving them erroneous advice.

The trial court entered summary judgment for the defendants on
the wrongful life claim of Mark Nelson, ﬁnding that no cause of action
existed. On the wrongful birth claim the trial court ruled that the claim
was  untimely  under  the  statute  of  limitations.  The  court  of  appeals
afﬁrmed.

The  Supreme  Court  reversed  the  summary  judgment  of  the
wrongful  birth  claim,  ﬁnding  that  the  parents  timely  brought  their
wrongful  birth  claim.  The  court  afﬁrmed  the  summary  judgment  of
the wrongful life claim.]

Concurring opinion by          , J.

I concur in the result reached by the majority.
The  reason  for  permitting  the  Nelsons  a  cause  of  action,  but
denying a similar cause of action to their son is simple: the claim of
the parents arguably contains all the elements for a prima facie case
in negligence; the claim of the child does not.

Viewing  Dr.  Krusen’s  alleged  conduct  from  the  standpoint  of  the
parents,  under  the  summary  judgment  evidence  and  pleadings  a
viable  suit  in  negligence  is  presented.  The  elements  of  actionable
negligence  are  duty,  a  breach  of  that  duty,  an  injury  to  the  person
owed  the  duty,  and  proximate  cause.  Pullman  Co.  v.  Caviness,  116
S.W. 410 (1909, writ ref’d). The duty to give accurate medical advice
runs from the doctor to the patient. That duty was arguably breached.
Since the parents allege that they would have sought an abortion had
they known Mrs. Nelson was a genetic carrier of Duchenne muscular

dystrophy, proximate cause must be presumed. The injury consists of
medical bills that would not have been incurred by the parents, but for
the birth of Mark Nelson.

The  “wrongful  life”  cause  of  action  must  be  viewed  from  a
different perspective, that of the child. With the child as a plaintiff, a
suit  in  negligence  is  difﬁcult  to  conceptualize.  Courts  examining
“wrongful life” suits have had difﬁculty with virtually every element of
the cause of action — the nature of the duty, if any, owed to an unborn
child  under  these  circumstances,  the  concomitant  question  of
breach,  and  the  issue  of  proximate  cause  in  a  situation  where  both
the child’s life and his or her defective condition are due to the same
negligent act.

I  am  most  concerned  by  the  element  of  injury.  We  cannot
compare Mark Nelson’s current condition, life as a victim of muscular
dystrophy,  with  the  alternative  of  a  normal,  healthy  childhood.  Were
this so, the fact of injury would not be in issue, and the sole question
would  be  the  calculation  of  the  extent  of  damages.  Under  the
summary judgment evidence, the same medical advice that was the
proximate cause of his affliction must be assumed to be the cause of
his  life  itself.  To  determine  whether  Mark  Nelson  has  suffered  an
injury  in  fact,  then,  his  life  with  physical  impairment  must  be
compared to the alternative of nonexistence.

This calculation cannot rationally be made, as man knows nothing
of  nonexistence,  and  can  assign  it  neither  a  positive  nor  a  negative
value.  Unfortunately,  the  fact  of  injury  is  a  prima  facie  element  in  a
cause of action for negligence. Johnson v. Sovereign Camp, W.O.W.,
125 Tex. 329, 83 S.W.2d 605 (1935). It is not fatal to a cause of action
in negligence that a plaintiff cannot prove the quantum of injury; but a
plaintiff  must  always  establish  the  existence  of  injury.  This  is  an
impossible  burden  for  a  “wrongful  life”  plaintiff  to  meet.  Since  the
initial burden of proof of each element of a negligence cause of action
is  upon  the  plaintiff,  and  one  element  is  rationally  unprovable  in  a
“wrongful  life”  setting,  a  negligence  suit  cannot  be  maintained.  The

absence of any injury in fact is also a primary factor in the refusal of
New  York  courts  to  recognize  a  “wrongful  life”  cause  of  action.  See,
e.g.,  Becker  v.  Schwartz,  46  N.Y.2d  401,  413  N.Y.S.2d  895,  900,  386
N.E.2d  807  (1978);  Alquijay  v.  St.  Luke’s-Roosevelt  Hospital  Center,
99 A.D.2d 704, 472 N.Y.S.2d 2, 3 (1984).

There  is  no  inconsistency  between  permitting  a  cause  of  action
for the parents, but not for the child. The difference is the identity of
the  parties.  For  the  parents,  the  alternatives  to  be  considered  in
determining  whether  there  has  been  any  injury  in  fact  are  no  child,
and  no  medical  expenses,  or  a  child  with  physical  impairment
resulting  in  medical  expenses  the  parents  are  obligated  to  pay.  The
fact  of  injury  is  apparent.  For  the  child,  though,  the  alternatives  are
existence  in  an  impaired  state,  or  nonexistence.  The  fact  of  injury  is
not only not apparent, but unknowable.

The  distinction  between  the  parents’  and  child’s  cause  of  action

has also been explained in a somewhat different fashion:

When the plaintiff alleges that his own birth was wrongful, in effect he asks the
court  to  judicially  determine  that  he  should  not  have  been  allowed  to  live,  but
when another person such as a parent alleges that the infant should not have
been born, the parent does not seek to negate his own present existence. The
parent is in reality seeking damages for injuries causally related to the fact of
birth,  but  not  for  the  birth  itself.  Thus,  the  parents  are  not  placed  in  the
anomalous  position  of  trying  to  sue  themselves  into  oblivion,  as  are  the
children.

Comment, Wrongful Birth: The Emerging Status of a New Tort,  8  St.
Mary’s L.J. 140, 145 (1976) (emphasis added).

It  is  worth  noting  that  most  other  jurisdictions  make  the  same
distinction as this court makes today, ﬁnding no logical inconsistency
between  permitting  a  cause  of  action  for  the  parents,  but  not  for
children. As the Supreme Court of Georgia observed earlier this year:

An action brought by a child against the parents or physician on the theory that
because of his illegitimacy or birth defects he would have been better not born

has found almost no support in the law. However, most jurisdictions now allow
an action by parents against the physician for wrongful pregnancy or wrongful
conception.

Fulton-DeKalb Hospital Authority v. Graves, 252 Ga. 441, 314 S.E.2d
653, 654 (1984). In at least three leading decisions, a cause of action
for the parents has been permitted, but a similar cause of action for
the  child  denied  in  the  same  decision.  See  Becker  v.  Schwartz,  386
N.E.2d  807  (1978);  Speck  v.  Finegold,  408  A.2d  496  (1979),  aff’d  in
part,  rev’d  in  part,  439  A.2d  110  (1981);  Dumer  v.  St.  Michæl’s
Hospital, 233 N.W.2d 372 (1975).

Recently,  California  and  Washington  courts  have  permitted  a
limited right of recovery for a child presenting a “wrongful life” claim.
See Turpin v. Sortini, 31 Cal. 3d 220, 643 P.2d 954, 182 Cal. Rptr. 337
(1982); Harbeson v. Parke-Davis, Inc., 98 Wash. 2d 460, 656 P.2d 483
(1983).  Even  more  recently,  New  Jersey  has  approved  the  same
result — permitting  a  child’s  recovery  of  extraordinary  medical
expenses — albeit  on  a  different  rationale.  Procanik  v.  Cillo,  97  N.J.
339,  478  A.2d  755  (1984).  It  is  tempting  to  join  these  courts  in
fashioning  some  relief  for  a  severely  handicapped  child,  when  that
child  may  be  burdened  with  crushing  medical  expenses  for  the
remainder of his natural life.

“Whether it is better never to
have been born at all than to
have been born with even gross
deﬁciencies is a mystery more
properly left to the philosophers
and the theologians.”

Becker v. Schwarts, 386
N.E.2d 807, 812 (N.Y.
1978).

result.

The  California  Supreme
Court  distinguished  between  general  and  special  damages  in  a
“wrongful  life”  setting,  denying  the  former,  yet  permitting  the  latter.
Explaining  why  general  damages  could  not  be  assessed,  the  Turpin
court  observed  that  “the  problem  is  not  .  .  .  simply  the  ﬁxing  of
damages  for  a  conceded  injury,  but  the  threshold  question  of
determining  whether  the  plaintiff  has  in  fact  suffered  an  injury  by
being born with an ailment as opposed to not being born at all.” 643
P.2d  at  963.  The  court  also  noted  that  “it  is  simply  impossible  to
determine  in  any  rational  or  reasoned  fashion  whether  the  plaintiff
has  in  fact  suffered  an  injury  in  being  born  impaired  rather  than  not
being born.” Id.

Thus, the California Supreme Court, in denying general damages,
seems to have explicitly conceded that a prima facie element of the
tort  was  not  established.  In  deciding  to  award  special  damages,
however,  the  Turpin  court  ignored  the  reasoning  that  prevented  an
award  of  general  damages.  The  problem  of  establishing  the  fact  of
injury  was  simply  passed  over,  and  all  discussion  focused  on  the
nonspeculative nature of a recovery for medical expenses.

To reiterate, the pleadings and briefs of plaintiffs in this case are
based  in  negligence.  While  this  court  is  not  adverse  to  reexamining
and  modifying  traditional  negligence  concepts  to  meet  changing
social  needs,  see  Otis  Eng’g  Corp.  v.  Clark,  668  S.W.2d  307  (Tex.
1983), it is properly unwilling to take the step required by a “wrongful
life”  plaintiff:  complete  waiver  of  the  requirement  of  injury  in  a
negligence cause of action. Once such a step is taken, it is difﬁcult to
envision any principled basis for refusing to extend the reasoning to
other elements and other situations.

This court neither addresses nor decides the question of whether
some day, under some different theory, a plaintiff might prevail under
similar  facts.  “New  and  nameless  torts  are  being  recognized
constantly, and the progress of the common law is marked by many
cases of ﬁrst impression, in which the court has struck out boldly to

create  a  new  cause  of  action,  where  none  has  been  recognized
before.”  W.  Prosser  and  W.  Keeton,  The  Law  of  Torts  §1  (5th  ed.
1984).  The  claim  of  Mark  Nelson,  however,  simply  fails  to  state  a
cause of action in negligence and must be denied.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Conceptual Damage Problem.   In  effect,  the  Nelson  court  holds
(as do most courts) that while the parents might be able to proceed
with  a  wrongful  birth  claim,  the  child  does  not  have  a  wrongful  life
claim. With regard to the child’s cause of action, most courts ﬁnd that
the  concept  of  proving  that  the  defendant’s  negligence  caused  an
injury is too difﬁcult to fathom. Why is this a problem for the wrongful
life claim of the child but not the parents’ wrongful birth claim?

2. Right to Privacy and Wrongful Birth.  The parents on a wrongful
birth claim allege that, but for the defendant’s negligence, they would
have  exercised  their  rights  to  terminate  the  pregnancy.  To  what
extent,  therefore,  does  the  existence  of  this  cause  of  action  depend
upon the continued validity of the Supreme Court’s decision in Roe v.
Wade?

3. Problems.
A. A married couple has a strong desire to have a girl but not a boy.
They  seek  counseling,  upon  the  wife  becoming  pregnant,  to
determine the sex of their child. The technician wrongly informs
them that they are going to have a girl. They end up giving birth
to  a  boy  and  contend  that,  but  for  the  wrong  reading  of  the
ultrasound, they would have terminated the pregnancy and tried
again  for  a  girl.  How  would  the  court  analyze  the  existence  of
their  wrongful  birth  cause  of  action?  Would  the  birth  of  their
healthy son be viewed as a viable wrongful birth claim? Or would
the  court  treat  it  with  the  same  view  that  most  courts  have  of

wrongful  pregnancy  claims — that  generally  the  birth  of  a
healthy child should be a cause for celebration?

B. A doctor’s negligence during the birth of a baby boy causes the
child to suffer permanent damage to his brain. The boy sues the
doctor for negligence. Will his claim be recognized? How would
a court measure his damages?

4. Odd Nature of Wrongful Birth Damages.  In most wrongful birth
claims, the parents are suing for two types of damages: (1) emotional
distress  damages  for  having  a  disabled  child  they  would  have  never
chosen  to  parent,  and  (2)  economic  losses  associated  with  the
extraordinary  care  for  such  a  child.  We  just  ﬁnished  reading  two
categories  of  cases,  one  rejecting  a  general  duty  to  avoid  causing
emotional  distress  (Kerr)  and  the  other  rejecting  a  negligence  claim
for economic losses (Finlandia). Is it odd that a plaintiff can pursue a
type of negligence claim that consists of both of these questionable
types  of  damages?  Consider  the  relationship  between  the  plaintiffs
and  defendant  in  a  wrongful  birth  claim  that  helps  to  avoid  limitless
liability to the public.

Upon Further Review

Negligence  claims  that  are  not  associated  with  physical  harm
but  instead  with  emotional  or  economic  injuries  are  suspect  in
tort  law.  This  is  because  the  harm  might  be  easily  feigned  and
because  imposing  a  duty  to  avoid  such  harms  generally  could
expose  defendants  to  far-flung,  unlimited  liability  far  beyond
what  courts  would  deem  acceptable.  Rather  than  stifle  activity,
courts  craft  small  exceptions.  With  respect  to  emotional
distress,  courts  will  recognize  bystander  claims  while  rejecting
any  general  duty  to  avoid  causing  emotional  problems.  For
economic loss, courts essentially cling to something analogous
to the impact rule — that absent physical harm to one’s property

or  person  you  cannot  recover  purely  economic  losses.  With
respect  to  newborn  children,  courts  refuse  to  recognize  a
wrongful  life  claim  by  a  disabled  child  whose  life  might  have
been avoided by careful prenatal diagnosis and the performance
of  an  abortion.  The  harm  is  too  conjectural  and  problematic —
courts  refuse  to  acknowledge  that  one  might  be  better  off
unborn  than  born  with  problems.  The  claim  by  parents  is  not
problematic for the courts as we can identify and measure their
harm.

V  DUTY LIMITED BY NATURE OF THE ACTIVITY:

PRIMARY ASSUMPTION OF THE RISK

A. Introduction

Thus  far  we  have  seen  the  concept  of  a  duty  of  care  impacted  by
notions  of  freedom  not  to  act  or  intervene  in  a  perilous  situation,  by
the lack of special relationships, and by concerns about the nature of
the  harm  incurred  by  the  plaintiff.  In  this  section,  we  will  see  courts
negate  any  duty  of  care  in  instances  where  the  doctrine  of  primary
assumption  of  risk  applies.  You  may  have  already  heard  the  phrase
“assumption of the risk.” If so, be warned that tort law has three very
distinct  varieties  of  assumption  of  risk.  Two  of  these  types  of
assumption of risk — secondary implied and express — are dealt with
in  Chapter  7  under  the  topic  of  Afﬁrmative  Defenses.  By  contrast,
primary  assumption  of  the  risk  operates  to  impair  the  plaintiff’s
is  not,
ability  to  show  negligence  against  the  defendant  and
technically  speaking,  an  afﬁrmative  defense.  We  will  introduce  this
concept  with  a  very  old  opinion  by  Judge  Cardozo  in  Steeplechase
Amusement,  and  then  consider  a  more  modern  application  in
Snowbird Ski Resort.

B. Inherent Risk

MURPHY v. STEEPLECHASE AMUSEMENT CO., INC.
166 N.E. 173 (N.Y. 1929)

       , J.

The defendant, Steeplechase Amusement Company, maintains an

amusement park at Coney Island, New York.

One of the supposed attractions is known as “The Flopper.” It is a
inclined  plane,  on  which
moving  belt,  running  upward  on  an
passengers  sit  or  stand.  Many  of  them  are  unable  to  keep  their  feet
because  of  the  movement  of  the  belt,  and  are  thrown  backward  or
aside. The belt runs in a groove, with padded walls on either side to a
height of four feet, and with padded flooring beyond the walls at the
same angle as the belt. An electric motor supplies the needed power.
Plaintiff, a vigorous young man, visited the park with friends. One
of them, a young woman, now his wife, stepped upon the moving belt.
Plaintiff  followed  and  stepped  behind  her.  As  he  did  so,  he  felt  what
he describes as a sudden jerk, and was thrown to the floor. His wife in
front  and  also  friends  behind  him  were  thrown  at  the  same  time.
Something more was here, as every one understood, than the slowly
moving  escalator  that  is  common  in  shops  and  public  places.  A  fall
was foreseen as one of the risks of the adventure. There would have
been no point to the whole thing, no adventure about it, if the risk had
not  been  there.  The  very  name  above  the  gate,  the  Flopper,  was
warning to the timid. If the name was not enough, there was warning
more distinct in the experience of others. We are told by the plaintiff’s
wife that the members of her party stood looking at the sport before
joining  in  it  themselves.  Some  aboard  the  belt  were  able,  as  she

viewed  them,  to  sit  down  with  decorum  or  even  to  stand  and  keep
their  footing;  others  jumped  or  fell.  The  tumbling  bodies  and  the
screams  and  laughter  supplied  the  merriment  and  fun.  “I  took  a
chance,” she said when asked whether she thought that a fall might
be expected.

Plaintiff  took  the  chance  with  her,  but,  less  lucky  than  his
companions,  suffered  a  fracture  of  a  knee  cap.  He  states  in  his
complaint  that  the  belt  was  dangerous  to  life  and  limb  in  that  it
stopped  and  started  violently  and  suddenly  and  was  not  properly
equipped  to  prevent  injuries  to  persons  who  were  using  it  without
knowledge  of  its  dangers,  and  in  a  bill  of  particulars  he  adds  that  it
was  operated  at  a  fast  and  dangerous  rate  of  speed  and  was  not
supplied  with  a  proper  railing,  guard  or  other  device  to  prevent  a  fall
therefrom. No other negligence is charged.

is  a  cause  and  the

We  see  no  adequate  basis  for  a  ﬁnding  that  the  belt  was  out  of
order. It was already in motion when the plaintiff put his foot on it. He
cannot  help  himself  to  a  verdict  in  such  circumstances  by  the
addition of the facile comment that it threw him with a jerk. One who
steps upon a moving belt and ﬁnds his heels above his head is in no
position to discriminate with nicety between the successive stages of
jerk,
jerk  which
the  shock,  between  the
accompanying the fall, as an instantaneous effect. There is evidence
for  the  defendant  that  power  was  transmitted  smoothly,  and  could
not  be  transmitted  otherwise.  If  the  movement  was  spasmodic,  it
was an unexplained and, it seems, an inexplicable departure from the
normal workings of the mechanism. An aberration so extraordinary, if
it  is  to  lay  the  basis  for  a  verdict,  should  rest  on  something  ﬁrmer
than  a  mere  descriptive  epithet,  a  summary  of  the  sensations  of  a
tense and crowded moment. But the jerk, if it were established, would
add little to the case. Whether the movement of the belt was uniform
or  irregular,  the  risk  at  greatest  was  a  fall.  This  was  the  very  hazard
that was invited and foreseen.

Volenti non fit injuria. One who takes part in such a sport accepts
the dangers that inhere in it so far as they are obvious and necessary,
just  as  a  fencer  accepts  the  risk  of  a  thrust  by  his  antagonist  or  a
spectator  at  a  ball  game  the  chance  of  contact  with  the  ball.  The
antics  of  the  clown  are  not  the  paces  of  the  cloistered  cleric.  The
rough and boisterous joke, the horseplay of the crowd, evokes its own
guffaws, but they are not the pleasures of tranquility. The plaintiff was
not seeking a retreat for meditation. Visitors were tumbling about the
belt  to  the  merriment  of  onlookers  when  he  made  his  choice  to  join
them. He took the chance of a like fate, with whatever damage to his
body might ensue from such a fall. The timorous may stay at home.

A  different  case  would  be

the  sport  were  obscure  or

Nothing  happened  to  the  plaintiff  except  what  common  experience
tells us may happen at any time as the consequence of a sudden fall.
Many  a  skater  or  a  horseman  can  rehearse  a  tale  of  equal  woe.  A
different case there would also be if the accidents had been so many
as to show that the game in its inherent nature was too dangerous to
be  continued  without  change.  The  president  of  the  amusement
company says that there had never been such an accident before. A
nurse  employed  at  an  emergency  hospital  maintained  in  connection
with the park contradicts him to some extent. She says that on other
occasions  she  had  attended  patrons  of  the  park  who  had  been
injured  at  the  Flopper,  how  many  she  could  not  say.  None,  however,
had been badly injured or had suffered broken bones. Such testimony
is not enough to show that the game was a trap for the unwary, too
perilous  to  be  endured.  According  to  the  defendant’s  estimate,  two
hundred  and  ﬁfty  thousand  visitors  were  at  the  Flopper  in  a  year.

Some  quota  of  accidents  was  to  be  looked  for  in  so  great  a  mass.
One  might  as  well  say  that  a  skating  rink  should  be  abandoned
because skaters sometimes fall.

The judgment of the Appellate Division and that of the Trial Term
should  be  reversed,  and  a  new  trial  granted,  with  costs  to  abide  the
event.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Primary  Assumption  of  the  Risk  vs.  Contributory  Negligence.
Sometimes  different  tort  doctrines  overlap.  In  a  case  involving
primary assumption of the risk, it is possible to allege as well that the
plaintiff  took  some  unreasonable  risk  of  harm  in  participating  in  an
obviously  dangerous  activity.  But  primary  assumption  of  the  risk  is
not focused upon blaming the plaintiff for participating voluntarily in
some  risky  endeavor.  The  focal  point  is  on  the  activity  itself,  or  at
least  defendant’s  provision  of  that  activity.  What  is  it  about  the
activity of riding an amusement park ride like the Flopper that causes
the court to invoke the doctrine?

2. Foreseeability  Negates  Duty.   Often,  courts  rely  upon  concepts
of  foreseeability  in  crafting  special  duty  rules.  The  Tarasoff  rule  and
the Dillon rule are both examples of this we have just covered earlier
in this chapter. Do you see how with regard to primary assumption of
the  risk,  the  foreseeability  of  the  potential  harm  is  actually  used  to
eliminate any duty of care? Why would this be true in this area?

C. A More Refined Test for Inherent Risks

CLOVER v. SNOWBIRD SKI RESORT
808 P.2d 1037 (Utah 1991)

    , J.

Plaintiff  Margaret  Clover  sought  to  recover  damages  for  injuries
sustained  as  the  result  of  a  ski  accident  in  which  Chris  Zulliger,  an
employee  of  defendant  Snowbird  Corporation  (“Snowbird”),  collided
with her. From the entry of summary judgment in favor of defendants,
Clover appeals.

At  the  time  of  the  accident,  Chris  Zulliger  was  employed  by
Snowbird as a chef at the Plaza Restaurant . . . which was located at
the  base  of  the  resort,  and  the  Mid-Gad  Restaurant,  which  was
located halfway to the top of the mountain.

On  December  5,  1985,  the  date  of  the  accident,  Zulliger  was
scheduled  to  begin  work  at  the  Plaza  Restaurant.  Prior  to  beginning
work,  he  had  planned  to  go  skiing.  .  .  .  Snowbird  preferred  that  their
employees know how to ski because it made it easier for them to get
to and from work.

[Zulliger  skied  four  runs  before  heading  down  the  mountain  to
work.  On  his  ﬁnal  run  he]  took  a  route  that  was  often  taken  by
Snowbird  employees  to  travel  from  the  top  of  the  mountain  to  the
Plaza. About mid-way down the mountain, at a point above the Mid-
Gad,  Zulliger  decided  to  take  a  jump  off  a  crest  on  the  side  of  an
intermediate run. He had taken this jump many times before. A skier
moving  relatively  quickly  is  able  to  become  airborne  at  that  point
because of the steep drop off on the downhill side of the crest. Due to
this drop off, it is impossible for skiers above the crest to see skiers
below  the  crest.  The  jump  was  well  known  to  Snowbird.  In  fact,  the
Snowbird ski patrol often instructed people not to jump off the crest.
There was also a sign instructing skiers to ski slowly at this point in
the run. Zulliger, however, ignored the sign and skied over the crest at
a  signiﬁcant  speed.  Clover,  who  had  just  entered  the  same  ski  run
from  a  point  below  the  crest,  either  had  stopped  or  was  traveling
slowly below the crest. When Zulliger went over the jump, he collided
with Clover, who was hit in the head and severely injured.

Clover brought claims against Zulliger and Snowbird, alleging that
[Snowbird was negligent in designing and maintaining its ski runs and
Zulliger  was  negligent  in  his  manner  of  skiing].  Zulliger  settled
separately  with  Clover.  [By  summary  judgment,]  the  trial  judge
dismissed Clover’s claims against Snowbird [because] Utah’s Inherent
Risk  of  Skiing  Statute,  Utah  Code  Ann.  §§78-27-51  to  -54  (Supp.
1986), bars plaintiff’s claim of negligent design and maintenance. . . .

The

trial  court  dismissed  Clover’s  negligent  design  and
maintenance  claim  on  the  ground  that  such  a  claim  is  barred  by
Utah’s Inherent Risk of Skiing Statute, Utah Code Ann. §§78-27-51 to
-54  (Supp.  1986).  This  ruling  was  based  on  the  trial  court’s  ﬁndings
that  “Clover  was  injured  as  a  result  of  a  collision  with  another  skier,
and/or the variation of steepness in terrain.” Apparently, the trial court
reasoned that regardless of a ski resort’s culpability, the resort is not
liable for an injury occasioned by one or more of the dangers listed in
section 78-27-52(1). This reasoning, however, is based on an incorrect
interpretation of sections 78-27-51 to -54.

Utah Code Ann. §§78-27-51 and -52(1) read in part:

Inherent risks of skiing — Public policy

The Legislature ﬁnds that the sport of skiing is practiced
by  a  large  number  of  residents  of  Utah  and  attracts  a  large
number  of  nonresidents,  signiﬁcantly  contributing  to  the
economy of this state.

. . . It is the purpose of this act, therefore, to clarify the law
in  relation  to  skiing  injuries  and  the  risks  inherent  in  that
sport,  and  to  establish  as  a  matter  of  law  that  certain  risks
are inherent in that sport, and to provide that, as a matter of
public  policy,  no  person  engaged  in  that  sport  shall  recover
from a ski operator for injuries resulting from those inherent
risks.

Inherent risk of skiing — Deﬁnitions

As used in this act:

(1)  “Inherent  risk  of  skiing”  means  those  dangers  or
conditions  which  are  an  integral  part  of  the  sport  of  skiing,
including,  but  not  limited  to:  changing  weather  conditions,
variations  or  steepness  in  terrain;  snow  or  ice  conditions;
surface or subsurface conditions such as bare spots, forest
growth,  rocks,  stumps,  impact  with  lift  towers  and  other
structures and their components; collisions with other skiers;
and a skier’s failure to ski within his own ability.

It  is  clear  that  [these  sections]  protect  ski  area  operators  from
suits initiated by their patrons who seek recovery for injuries caused
by an inherent risk of skiing. The statute, however, does not purport to
grant  ski  area  operators  complete  immunity  from  all  negligence
claims initiated by skiers. While the general parameters of the act are
clear,  application  of  the  statute  to  speciﬁc  circumstances  is  less
certain. In the instant case, both parties urge different interpretations
of  the  act.  Snowbird  claims  that  any  injury  occasioned  by  one  or
more  of  the  dangers  listed  in  section  78-27-52(1)  is  barred  by  the
statute because, as a matter of law, such an accident is caused by an
inherent  risk  of  skiing.  Clover,  on  the  other  hand,  argues  that  a  ski
area operator’s negligence is not an inherent risk of skiing and that if
the  resort’s  negligence  causes  a  collision  between  skiers,  a  suit
arising from that collision is not barred by [the statute].

Although  the  trial  court  apparently  agreed  with  Snowbird,  we
decline  to  adopt  such  an  interpretation.  The  basis  of  Snowbird’s
argument  is  that  the  language  of  section  78-27-52(1)  stating  that
“inherent risk of skiing means those dangers or conditions which are
an  integral  part  of  the  sport  of  skiing,  including  but  not  limited
to:  .  .  .  collision  with  other  skiers”  must  be  read  as  deﬁning  all
collisions between skiers as inherent risks. The wording of the statute
does not compel such a reading. To the contrary, the dangers listed in
section  78-27-52(1)  are  modiﬁed  by  the  term  “integral  part  of  the

sport of skiing.” Therefore, ski area operators are protected from suits
to recover for injuries caused by one or more of the dangers listed in
section  78-27-52(1)  only  to  the  extent  that  those  dangers,  under  the
facts of each case, are integral aspects of the sport of skiing. Indeed,
the  list  of  dangers  in  section  78-27-52(1)  is  expressly  nonexclusive.
The  statute,  therefore,  contemplates  that  the  determination  of
whether a risk is inherent be made on a case-by-case basis, using the
entire statute, not solely the list provided in section 78-27-52(1).

jurisdictions  employed

Inasmuch as the purpose of the statute is to “clarify the law,” not
to  radically  alter  ski  resort  liability,  it  is  necessary  to  briefly  examine
the relevant law at the time the statute was enacted. Although there
is limited Utah case law on point, when the statute was enacted the
the  doctrine  of  primary
majority  of
assumption  of  risk  in  limiting  ski  resorts’  liability  for  injuries  their
patrons  received  while  skiing.  Terms  utilized  in  the  statute  such  as
“inherent  risk  of  skiing”  and  “assumes  the  risk”  are  the  same  terms
relied upon in such cases. This language suggests that the statute is
meant  to  achieve  the  same  results  achieved  under  the  doctrine  of
primary  assumption  of  risk.  In  fact,  commentators  suggest  that  the
statute  was  passed  in  reaction  to  a  perceived  erosion  in  the
protection ski area operators traditionally enjoyed under the common
law doctrine of primary assumption of risk.

As we have noted in the past, the single term “assumption of risk”
has  been  used  to  refer  to  several  different,  and  occasionally
overlapping,  concepts.  One  concept,  primary  assumption  of  risk,  is
simply  “an  alternative  expression  for  the  proposition  that  the
defendant was not negligent, that is, there was no duty owed or there
was no breach of an existing duty.” This suggests that the statute, in
clarifying  the  “confusion  as  to  whether  a  skier  assumes  the  risks
inherent in the sport of skiing,” operates to deﬁne the duty ski resorts
owe to their patrons.

Finally,  it  is  to  be  noted  that  without  a  duty,  there  can  be  no
negligence. Such an interpretation, therefore, harmonizes the express

purpose  of  the  statute,  protecting  ski  area  operators  from  suits
arising out of injuries caused by the inherent risks of skiing, with the
fact that the statute does not purport to abrogate a skier’s traditional
right to recover for injuries caused by ski area operators’ negligence.

A  similar  analysis  leads  to  the  conclusion  that  the  [duty  this
statute imposes] on ski resorts [includes] the duty to use reasonable
care  for  the  protection  of  its  patrons.  .  .  .  [H]owever,  a  ski  area
operator  is  under  no  duty  to  protect  its  patrons  from  the  inherent
risks  of  skiing.  The  inherent  risks  of  skiing  are  those  dangers  that
skiers  wish  to  confront  as  essential  characteristics  of  the  sport  of
skiing  or  hazards  that  cannot  be  eliminated  by  the  exercise  of
ordinary care on the part of the ski area operator.

The  term  “inherent  risk  of  skiing,”  refers  to  those  risks  that  are
essential characteristics of skiing — risks that are so integrally related
to  skiing  that  the  sport  cannot  be  undertaken  without  confronting
these risks. Generally, these risks can be divided into two categories.
The  ﬁrst  category  of  risks  consists  of  those  risks,  such  as  steep
grades, powder, and mogul runs, which skiers wish to confront as an
essential  characteristic  of  skiing.  Under  sections  78-27-51  to  -54,  a
ski  area  operator  is  under  no  duty  to  make  all  of  its  runs  as  safe  as
possible  by  eliminating  the  type  of  dangers  that  skiers  wish  to
confront as an integral part of skiing.

The second category of risks consists of those hazards which no
one  wishes  to  confront  but  cannot  be  alleviated  by  the  use  of
reasonable care on the part of a ski resort. It is without question that
skiing  is  a  dangerous  activity.  Hazards  may  exist  in  locations  where
they  are  not  readily  discoverable.  Weather  and  snow  conditions  can
suddenly change and, without warning, create new hazards where no
hazard previously existed. Hence, it is clearly foreseeable that a skier,
without  skiing  recklessly,  may  momentarily  lose  control  or  fall  in  an
unexpected  manner.  Ski  area  operators  cannot  alleviate  these  risks,
and  under  sections  78-27-51  to  -54,  they  are  not  liable  for  injuries
caused by such risks. . . . This does not mean, however, that a ski area

operator is under no duty to use ordinary care to protect its patrons.
In fact, if an injury was caused by an unnecessary hazard that could
have  been  eliminated  by  the  use  of  ordinary  care,  such  a  hazard  is
not,  in  the  ordinary  sense  of  the  term,  an  inherent  risk  of  skiing  and
would fall outside of sections 78-27-51 to -54.

Having established the proper interpretation of sections 78-27-51
to -54, the next step is to determine whether, given this interpretation,
there  is  a  genuine  issue  of  material  fact  in  regard  to  Clover’s  claim.
First,  the  existence  of  a  blind  jump  with  a  landing  area  located  at  a
point  where  skiers  enter  the  run  is  not  an  essential  characteristic  of
an  intermediate  run.  Therefore,  Clover  may  recover  if  she  can  prove
that Snowbird could have prevented the accident through the use of
ordinary  care.  It  is  to  be  noted  that  Clover’s  negligent  design  and
maintenance  claim  is  not  based  solely  on  the  allegation  that
Snowbird  allowed  conditions  to  exist  on  an  intermediate  hill  which
caused  blind  spots  and  allowed  skiers  to  jump.  Rather,  Clover
presents evidence that Snowbird was aware that its patrons regularly
took  the  jump,  that  the  jump  created  an  unreasonable  hazard  to
skiers  below  the  jump,  and  that  Snowbird  did  not  take  reasonable
measures to eliminate the hazard. This evidence is sufﬁcient to raise
a genuine issue of material fact in regard to Clover’s negligent design
and maintenance claim.

In light of the genuine issues of material fact in regard to each of

Clover’s claims, summary judgment was inappropriate.
Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Inherent Dangers.  The statute in Utah referred both to collisions
with other skiers and changes in terrain as inherent dangers of snow
skiing.  The  court  clariﬁed,  however,  that  only  some  collisions  and
some  changes  in  terrain  were  actually  inherent  dangers.  The  court

then  identiﬁes  two  types  of  inherent  dangers:  positive  dangers  that
are desirable, and negative dangers that can’t reasonably be avoided
without  fundamentally  changing  the  sport  or  activity.  How  does  the
court  then  decide  that  the  allegations  of  negligence  by  the  plaintiff
possibly demonstrated negligence?

2.  A  Necessary  Doctrine?   Courts  and  commentators  agree  that
primary assumption of the risk is merely an acknowledgment that the
defendant  either  has  no  duty  to  prevent  inherent  risks  or  that  the
defendant  has  not  breached  any  duty  of  care  regarding  such  risks.
Application of the Learned Hand formula for negligence is ultimately
what  is  employed  to  deﬁne  an  inherent  risk.  Given  this,  does  the
doctrine really add anything to our negligence analysis?

3. Societal Expectations Can Change.   The  primary  assumption  of
the  risk  doctrine  is  so  associated  with  foul  ball  injuries  at  baseball
games that some refer to the doctrine as the “baseball doctrine.” For
many  years  courts  have  fairly  consistently  denied  recovery  to
spectators  at  baseball  games  hit  by  foul  balls.  But  in  recent  years,
Major  League  Baseball  teams  have  begun  extending  the  netting
further  around  the  stadium  (past  the  dugout  areas)  after  a  series  of
well publicized and serious injuries, including one to a young child at
the  New  York  Yankees’  stadium  during  the  summer  of  2017.  After
these changes, would a fan attending a baseball game at a stadium
that had not yet extended the netting and who gets hit sitting behind
the dugout, be in a better position to argue that this activity no longer
constituted a primary assumption of the risk?

4.  Problems.   Does  primary  assumption  of  the  risk  preclude  the

following negligence claims?

A.  A  spectator  at  a  major  league  ballpark  sitting  along  the  third
base side is hit with a foul ball and injured. She sues the club for
negligently failing to protect her from such hazards.

B.  A  spectator  at  a  major  league  ballpark  sitting  directly  behind
home  plate  is  hit  by  a  foul  ball  and  injured.  The  ballpark  had

recently decided to remove the netting that was typically used to
protect fans in this portion of the park.

C. A spectator at a major league ballpark is on a concourse with a
peek hole built into the wall that permits someone waiting in line
for hot dogs to watch the action. The spectator is not watching
the action and a ball hit during batting practice comes through
the opening and hits the spectator.

Upon Further Review

Primary  assumption  of  the  risk  is  just  a  particular  way  that  a
court  can  declare  as  a  matter  of  law  that  the  defendant  is  not
liable  to  the  plaintiff  in  negligence,  either  because  there  was  no
duty to prevent harms associated with inherent risks, or because
there  was  no  unreasonable  conduct  by  the  defendant.  It  is
technically not an afﬁrmative defense but simply another way of
saying that the plaintiff has failed to prove negligence. It applies
when the particular risk is either desirable or not one that can be
avoided  through  the  exercise  of  reasonable  care.  The  modern
inquiry focuses not so much upon the plaintiff’s awareness, but
more  upon  the  nature  of  the  activity  and  the  defendant’s
conduct. In Chapter 7, we will learn about two true defenses that
share  a  common  name — secondary  implied  assumption  of  the
risk and express assumption of the risk.

VI  DUTY BASED UPON VICTIM’S STATUS

A. Introduction

In  premises  liability  cases,  tort  law  has  traditionally  altered  its  duty
rules  based  upon  the  status  of  the  victim  who  was  hurt  upon  the
defendant’s land. In other words, not all claimants are treated equally.
We  will  see  at  the  end  of  this  section  that  there  has  emerged  a
modern  trend  away  from  such  disparate  treatment.  We  begin,
however,  with  a  review  of  the  traditional  categories  of  trespasser,
licensee,  and  invitee.  Be  careful  to  understand  both  how  courts
deﬁne  and  determine  these  categories,  as  well  as  how  and  why  the
duty rules vary with each.

B. Trespassers

Trespassers occupy a least-favored status among all of the entrants
to  another’s  property.  This  stems  from  the  strong  tradition  in  the
common law to respect the property rights of citizens. You may recall
in  Chapter  2  that  it  was  relatively  easy  to  be  labeled  a  trespasser
(even  if  acting  in  good  faith)  so  long  as  you  were  on  the  land  of
another  without  their  permission.  Further,  as  a  trespasser  your
liability  was  quite  broad — unburdened  by  any  proximate  cause
limitations.  Most  jurisdictions  have  held  that,  therefore,  a  landowner
owes  only  minimal  duties  toward  a  trespasser — the  duty  to  refrain
from  gross  negligence  (“willful  or  wanton  misconduct”).  This  limited
duty is subject to modiﬁcation. In the case of trespassers who have
stepped  onto  the  defendant’s  property  with  sinister
intentions,
arguably even a lesser duty applies, as we will see in the Ryals case
below.  In  the  case  of  child  trespassers,  however,  courts  will

sometimes  elevate  the  duty  of  care  owed  under  the  attractive
nuisance doctrine. This is explored in the Stanley case.

1. Adult Trespassers

RYALS v. UNITED STATES STEEL CORP.
562 So. 2d 192 (Ala. 1990)

     , J.

Wilson  Ryals,  Jr.,  as  administrator  of  the  estate  of  his  brother,
David  Ryals,  appeals  from  a  summary  judgment  in  favor  of  the
defendant, United States Steel Corporation (“U.S. Steel”). The plaintiff
alleged  that  the  defendant  caused  the  decedent’s  death  by
negligently or wantonly failing to maintain and secure a “switch rack”
[something  akin  to  an  electrical  substation].  Ryals  later  voluntarily
dismissed the negligence claim, and the trial court entered summary
judgment in favor of U.S. Steel on the wantonness claim.

Because  this  Court,  by  this  opinion,  recognizes  two  distinct
classes  of  trespassers  to  land — (1)  mere  trespassers,  to  whom  the
landowner  owes  the  duty  not  to  wantonly  injure  them;  and  (2)
trespassers  who  enter  upon  the  land  of  another  with  the  manifest
intent  to  commit  a  criminal  act  and  to  whom  the  landowner  owes
only  the  duty  not  to  intentionally  injure  them — we  afﬁrm  the
judgment.

On March 31, 1984, Wilson and David Ryals, as trespassers, went
to  U.S.  Steel’s  Muscoda  Mines  switch  rack  for  the  purpose  of
“stripping  out”  copper,  brass,  and  other  salvageable  metals.  Wilson
Ryals  testiﬁed  at  his  deposition  that,  when  they  arrived  at  the  site,
they found the base of the structure to be partially stripped; that they
found  one  rusty  warning  sign,  detached  metals  lying  on  the  ground,
dangling  wires,  garbage  in  and  around  the  fenced  area  and  wild

vegetation  growing  around  the  fence;  and  that  they  found  the  gate
leading into the switch rack to be “wide open.” David Ryals contacted
a 44,000-volt copper line; he suffered third degree burns over 95% of
his body and died several days later as a result.

The only issue presented here is whether U.S. Steel was entitled to
a summary judgment under the appropriate standard of care owed by
U.S.  Steel  to  David  Ryals,  as  a  trespasser,  who,  at  the  time  of  his
injury, was engaged in the crime of theft of U.S. Steel’s property.

Necessarily antecedent to any evaluation of the facts, however, is
a  determination  of  the  legal  duty  owed  by  a  landowner  to  a
trespasser.  David  Ryals  was,  without  question,  a  trespasser.  The
standard  of  care  that  a  landowner  owes  to  a  trespasser  is  generally
recognized  as  the  lowest  standard  of  care  owed  to  one  who  enters
upon  another’s  land.  The  landowner  is  bound  only  to  refrain  from
reckless, willful, or wanton conduct toward the trespasser. Copeland
v. Pike Liberal Arts School, 553 So. 2d 100 (Ala. 1989).

It  is  noteworthy  that  the  highest  degree  of  care  imposed  upon  a
landowner  by  this  traditional  common  law  rule  toward  a  mere
trespasser,  i.e.,  one  who  wrongfully  comes  upon  the  land  of  another
but without any motive, design, or intent to engage in further wrongful
conduct,  is  not  to  recklessly  or  wantonly  injure  that  person.  Ryals
does  not  contend  otherwise;  rather,  he  argues  that  the  facts,  when
construed most favorably to him, support a ﬁnding of wantonness on
the  part  of  U.S.  Steel,  and,  thus,  that  summary  judgment  was
inappropriate.  Admittedly,  if  all  trespassers  are  to  be  treated  equally,
and  if  we  agree  that  the  conduct  of  U.S.  Steel  amounted  to
wantonness, then the summary judgment is due to be reversed.
“Wantonness” has been deﬁned by this Court as follows:

[Wantonness is] the conscious doing of some act or the omission of some duty
under  the  knowledge  of  the  existing  conditions,  and  conscious  that  from  the
doing of such act or omission of such duty injury will likely or probably result.

Kilcrease v. Harris, 259 So. 2d 797, 801-02 (1972).

Ryals  contends  that  a  genuine  issue  of  material  fact  was
presented  on  the  question  whether  U.S.  Steel  wantonly  caused  the
death of David Ryals. Ryals bases his wantonness argument primarily
on  his  claim  that  when  he  and  his  brother  arrived  at  the  site  they
found it in the condition hereinabove set out. He also points out that
agents  of  U.S.  Steel  acknowledged  in  deposition  and  in  answers  to
interrogatories  that  there  had  been  two  prior  deaths  at  the  same
switch  rack  under  similar  circumstances.  He  maintains,  in  light  of
those alleged and admitted facts, that the factﬁnder could reasonably
infer  that  U.S.  Steel  had  actual  or  constructive  notice  that  persons
might come into contact with the electrical lines at the switch rack.

We  agree;  if  reckless  or  wanton  conduct  is  the  appropriate
standard  of  care  applicable  to  these  facts,  then  a  jury  question  has
been presented as to U.S. Steel’s conduct. We believe, however, that
these  facts  strongly  demonstrate  a  public  policy  justiﬁcation  for
lowering  the  requisite  degree  of  care  due  from  a  landowner  to  one
who, as here, wrongfully enters upon the land of another to commit a
crime.  For  public  policy  reasons,  therefore,  we  hold  that  the  duty
owed  by  a  landowner  to  an  adult  trespasser  who  comes  upon  the
land  and  is  injured  while  committing  a  crime  is  the  duty  not  to
intentionally injure such trespasser.

Applying  this  standard  to  the  full  context  of  the  instant  case,  we
conclude  that  a  fact  question  was  not  presented  on  the  issue
whether U.S. Steel intentionally caused the death of David Ryals. The
switch rack was surrounded by a chain link fence topped with barbed
wire. On the fence surrounding the switch rack there was at least one
sign warning of the electrical danger within. Given these conspicuous
indications  of  danger,  an  unlocked  gate  would  not  imperil  a  person
unless that person elected to disregard the obvious danger presented
by the electricity. In summary, the evidence, as a matter of law, fails to
suggest  that  U.S.  Steel  breached  its  duty  not  to  intentionally  injure
David Ryals, who undisputedly, at the time of his injury, was an adult

illegally upon U.S. Steel’s property for the purpose of stealing copper
wire.

Accordingly,  the  judgment  of  the  trial  court  is  due  to  be,  and  it

hereby is, afﬁrmed.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Justiﬁcation for Lower Duty to Ordinary Trespassers.  There are
two  ways  to  justify  the  lower  duty  owed  to  trespassers.  First,  that
trespassers  are  simply  disliked  or  disfavored  and,  as  a  matter  of
justice,  should  not  be  entitled  to  the  same  protections  as  one
permitted  to  be  on  the  property.  Second,  that  they  are
less
foreseeable than the invited or permitted guest. Given that they might
happen onto the land at any time, day or night, and without notice, it
would create an undue burden on the owner to anticipate and prepare
the land for their safe entry.

2.  Duty  Not  to  Intentionally  Harm  the  Criminal  Trespasser.   Most
courts have not reached the issue of whether the duty of care should
be lowered further for a trespasser on another’s property to commit a
crime.  What  seems  to  be  the  justiﬁcation  for  doing  so?  By  saying
there is only a duty not to intentionally injure the trespasser, the court
is  really  taking  such  liability  out  of  the  realm  of  accidental  torts
altogether. To create liability under this standard, the defendant would
have  to  have  committed  a  battery.  On  the  other  hand,  we  have
previously  seen  in  Chapter  3  that  conduct  that  would  otherwise
constitute  a  battery  can  be  justiﬁed  to  protect  property.  If  the
landowner  in  Ryals  had  set  up  the  electrical  substation  in  order  to
purposefully  injure  the  plaintiff,  for  the  protection  of  its  property,
would this have been justiﬁed? Recall the holding of the court in the
Katko (spring gun) case in that chapter.

3. Gross Negligence as Typical Standard for Trespassers.  The court
in  Ryals  stated  that  if  the  typical  standard  applicable  to  trespassers

were utilized then the summary judgment would have been improper.
Which facts, in particular, demonstrate that the defendant might have
met the standard for gross negligence?

2. Child Trespassers: The Attractive Nuisance Doctrine

injured  plaintiff

When  the
is  a  child  trespasser,  courts  face
countervailing feelings. On the one hand, the common law still favors
landowners  and  disfavors  those  who  commit  trespass.  These
feelings  justify  in  part  the  lower  duty  owed  to  such  tortfeasors  by
landowners.  But  on  the  other  hand,  the  law  seeks  to  protect  and
promote  the  interests  of  children.  So  when  a  child  trespasser  is
injured  on  another’s  property  and  sues  that  landowner,  courts  stand
in  the  crossroads  of  these  conflicting  principles  and  emotions.  The
common  law  has  developed  the  attractive  nuisance  doctrine  as  its
compromise answer to this dilemma.

BENNETT v. STANLEY
748 N.E.2d 41 (Ohio 2001)

       , J.

In this case we are called upon to determine what level of duty a
property  owner  owes  to  a  child  trespasser.  We  resolve  the  question
by adopting the attractive nuisance doctrine set forth in Restatement
of the Law 2d, Torts (1965), Section 339. We also hold that an adult
who attempts to rescue a child from an attractive nuisance assumes
the  status  of  the  child,  and  is  owed  a  duty  of  ordinary  care  by  the
property owner.

When  Rickey  G.  Bennett,  plaintiff-appellant,  arrived  home  in  the
late afternoon of March 20, 1997, he found his two young daughters
crying.  The  three-year-old,  Kyleigh,  told  him  that  “Mommy”  and

Chance,  her  ﬁve-year-old  half-brother,  were  “drowning  in  the  water.”
Bennett ran next door to his neighbors’ house to ﬁnd mother and son
unconscious in the swimming pool. Both died.

The  Bennetts  had  moved  next  door  to  defendants-appellees,
Jeffrey  and  Stacey  Stanley,  in  the  fall  of  1996.  The  Stanleys  had
purchased  their  home  the  previous  June.  At  the  time  of  their
purchase, the Stanleys’ property included a swimming pool that had
gone unused for three years. At that time, the pool was enclosed with
fencing  and  a  brick  wall.  After  moving  in,  the  Stanleys  drained  the
pool once but thereafter they allowed rainwater to accumulate in the
pool to a depth of over six feet. They removed a tarp that had been on
the  pool  and  also  removed  the  fencing  that  had  been  around  two
sides  of  the  pool.  The  pool  became  pond-like:  it  contained  tadpoles
and  frogs,  and  Mr.  Stanley  had  seen  a  snake  swimming  on  the
surface. The pool contained no ladders, and its sides were slimy with
algae.

The Stanleys were aware that the Bennetts had moved next door
and that they had young children. They had seen the children outside
unsupervised.  Stacey  Stanley  had  once  called  Chance  onto  her
property  to  retrieve  a  dog.  The  Stanleys  testiﬁed,  however,  that  they
never had any concern about the children getting into the pool. They
did not post any warning or “no trespassing” signs on their property.

Rickey Bennett testiﬁed that he had told his children to stay away
from  the  pool  on  the  Stanleys’  property.  He  also  stated  that  he  had
never seen the children playing near the pool.

Kyleigh  told  her  father  that  she  and  Chance  had  been  playing  at
the  pool  on  the  afternoon  of  the  tragedy.  The  sheriff’s  department
concluded that Chance had gone to the pool to look at the frogs and
somehow fell into the pool. His mother apparently drowned trying to
save him.

Bennett  alleged  [in  his  complaint]  that  appellees  had  negligently
maintained an abandoned swimming pool on their property and that

appellees’  negligence  proximately  caused  the  March  20,  1997
drowning  of  Chance  and  Cher.  Appellant  averred  that  appellees  had
created  a  dangerous  condition  by  negligently  maintaining  the  pool
and  that  appellees  reasonably  should  have  known  that  the  pool
posed  an  unreasonable  risk  of  serious  harm  to  others.  Appellant
speciﬁcally alleged that appellees’ pool created an unreasonable risk
of harm to children who, because of their youth, would not realize the
potential danger. Appellant further asserted that appellees’ conduct in
maintaining the pool constituted willful and wanton misconduct such
as to justify an award of punitive damages.

Appellees  ﬁled  a  motion  for  summary  judgment,  which  the  trial
court  granted  on  September  4,  1998.  The  trial  court  found  that
Chance  and  Cher  were  trespassers  on  appellees’  property  and  that
appellees  therefore  owed  them  only  a  duty  to  refrain  from  wanton
and  willful  misconduct.  As  the  complaint  alleged  that  appellees  had
violated a duty of ordinary care, the court found for the Stanleys as a
matter of law.

On appeal, the appellate court afﬁrmed the trial court’s granting of
summary  judgment.  It,  too,  held  that  appellees  owed  the  decedents
only a duty to refrain from wanton and willful misconduct, and added
that there was no evidence of such misconduct. The appellate court
also  addressed  the  issue  of  appellees’  duty  to  Cher  Bennett.  The
court  held  that  even  if  she  were  on  the  Stanleys’  property  in  an
attempt  to  rescue  Chance,  she  would  still  have  the  status  only  of  a
licensee  [to  whom  the  Stanleys  would  not  owe  a  duty  of  reasonable
care].

Ohio  has  long  recognized  a  range  of  duties  for  property  owners
vis-a-vis  persons  entering  their  property.  Currently,  to  an  invitee  the
landowner owes a duty “to exercise ordinary care and to protect the
invitee by maintaining the premises in a safe condition.” Light v. Ohio
Univ.  (1986),  28  Ohio  St.  3d  66,  68,  28  Ohio  B.  Rep.  165,  167,  502
N.E.2d  611,  613.  To  trespassers,  on  the  other  hand,  “a  landowner
owes  no  duty  .  .  .  except  to  refrain  from  willful,  wanton  or  reckless

conduct which is likely to injure [the trespasser].” Gladon, 75 Ohio St.
3d  at  317,  662  N.E.2d  at  293.  Today,  we  face  the  issue  of  whether
child  trespassers  should  become  another  class  of  users  who  are
owed a different duty of care.

This  court  has  consistently  held  that  children  have  a  special
status in tort law and that duties of care owed to children are different
from duties owed to adults.

“The  dangerous

Recognizing  the  special  status  of  children  in  the  law,  this  court
has  even  accorded  special  protection  to  child  trespassers  by
adopting the “dangerous instrumentality” doctrine:
[to  nonliability  to
instrumentality  exception
trespassers]  imposes  upon  the  owner  or  occupier  of  a  premises  a
higher duty of care to a child trespasser when such owner or occupier
actively  and  negligently  operates  hazardous  machinery  or  other
apparatus,  the  dangerousness  of  which  is  not  readily  apparent  to
children.” McKinney v. Hartz & Restle Realtors, Inc. (1987), 510 N.E.2d
386, 390.

That  doctrine  was  developed  in  Coy  v.  Columbus,  Delaware  &
Marion Elec. Co. (1932), 125 Ohio St. 283, 181 N.E. 131, a case where
a  six-year-old  boy  was  injured  when  he  touched  a  high  voltage
transformer  owned  by  the  defendant  and  located  in  a  vacant  lot
known  to  be  frequented  by  children.  The  court  applied  a  negligence
standard  to  the  behavior  of  the  company,  despite  the  fact  that  the
child had been trespassing.

Thus, the court adopted as early as 1932 some of the hallmarks of
the  attractive  nuisance  doctrine.  Elements  such  as  knowledge  of
children’s presence, the maintenance of a potentially dangerous force,
and an exercise of care by the owner commensurate with the danger
are  a  part  of  the  attractive  nuisance  doctrine  in  most  states,  as
reflected in Section 339 of the Restatement of Torts.

Despite the fact that in premises liability cases a landowner’s duty
is  deﬁned  by  the  status  of  the  plaintiff,  and  that  children,  even  child

trespassers,  are  accorded  special  protection  in  Ohio  tort  law,  this
court  has  never  adopted  the  attractive  nuisance  doctrine.  The
doctrine as adopted by numerous states is set forth in Restatement
of the Law 2d, Torts (1965), Section 339:

A possessor of land is subject to liability for physical harm to
children  trespassing  thereon  caused  by  an  artiﬁcial  condition
upon land if:

(a)  the  place  where  the  condition  exists  is  one  upon
which  the  possessor  knows  or  has  reason  to  know  that
children are likely to trespass, and

(b) the condition is one of which the possessor knows or
has  reason  to  know  and  which  he  realizes  or  should  realize
will  involve  an  unreasonable  risk  of  death  or  serious  bodily
harm to such children, and

(c)  the  children  because  of  their  youth  do  not  discover
the condition or realize the risk involved in intermeddling with
it or in coming within the area made dangerous by it, and

(d)  the  utility  to  the  possessor  of  maintaining  the
condition and the burden of eliminating the danger are slight
as compared with the risk to children involved, and

(e)  the  possessor  fails  to  exercise  reasonable  care  to

eliminate the danger or otherwise to protect the children.

This court has never explicitly rejected the Restatement version of
the  doctrine,  which  was  adopted  in  1965.  Instead,  Ohio’s  tradition  in
this area of the law is based upon this court’s rejection in 1907 of the
“turntable doctrine.”

The  “turntable  doctrine”  was  a  somewhat  controversial  doctrine
wherein  railroads  could  be  liable  to  children  for  injuries  suffered  on
unguarded railroad turntables. The theory of liability was established
in Sioux City & Pacific RR. Co. v. Stout (1873), 84 U.S. (17 Wall.) 657,
21 L. Ed. 745, and had been adopted by many states as of 1907. The

burning question for many years was whether to apply the doctrine to
non-turntable  cases.  Many  of  the  states  that  adopted  the  turntable
doctrine  refused  to  apply  it  to  cases  not  involving  turntables.  Id.  at
245, 83 N.E. at 69-70.

However,  the  theory  of  liability  has  evolved  since  1907.  The
Restatement of the Law, Torts (1934) and Restatement of the Law 2d,
Torts (1965) removed legal ﬁctions and imposed balancing factors to
consider  on  behalf  of  landowners.  Comment,  The  Restatement’s
Attractive  Nuisance  Doctrine:  An  Attractive  Alternative  for  Ohio,  46
Ohio  St.  L.J.  135,  138-139  (1985).  Ohio’s  refusal  to  recognize  the
turntable  doctrine  in  1907  was  not  a  serious  anomaly  at  the  time;
today, our failure to adopt the attractive nuisance doctrine is.

Ohio  is  one  of  only  three  states  that  have  not  either  created  a
special  duty  for  trespassing  children  or  done  away  with  distinctions
of  duty  based  upon  a  person’s  status  as  an  invitee,  licensee,  or
trespasser. Kessler  v.  Mortenson  (Utah  2000),  2000  UT  95,  16  P.3d
1225,  1228;  Comment,  supra,  46  Ohio  St.  L.J.  at  147;  Drumheller,
Maryland’s  Rejection  of  Attractive  Nuisance  Doctrine  (1996),  55  Md.
L. Rev. 807, 810, and fn. 32.

[Previously  this  court  has  rejected  attempts  to

invoke  the
attractive nuisance doctrine, in part, because the foreseeability of the
child’s  presence  required  by  §339(a)  of  the  Restatement  (Second)
was  lacking.]  In  this  case,  there  is  at  least  a  genuine  issue  of  fact
regarding  the  foreseeability  of  one  of  the  Bennett  children  entering
onto  the  Stanley  property.  [H]ere,  the  child  resided  next  door.
Reasonable minds could conclude that it was foreseeable that one of
the Bennett children would explore around the pool.

Thus,  in  this  case  we  cannot  decline  to  adopt  the  attractive
nuisance  doctrine  because  of  a  lack  of  foreseeability.  Any  failure  to
adopt  attractive  nuisance  would  be  to  reject
its  philosophical
underpinnings  and  would  keep  Ohio  in  the  small  minority  of  states
that do not recognize some form of the doctrine.

Adopting  the  attractive  nuisance  doctrine  would  be  merely  an
incremental change in Ohio law, not out of line with the law that has
developed  over  time.  It  is  an  appropriate  evolution  of  the  common
law. While the present case is by no means a guaranteed winner for
the plaintiff, it does present a factual scenario that would allow a jury
to  consider  whether  the  elements  of  the  cause  of  action  have  been
fulﬁlled.

We  therefore  use  this  case  to  adopt  the  attractive  nuisance
doctrine contained in Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts (1965) §339.
In  doing  so,  we  do  not  abandon  the  differences  in  duty  a  landowner
owes to the different classes of users. In this case we simply further
recognize  that  children  are  entitled  to  a  greater  level  of  protection
than  adults  are.  We  remove  the  “distinctions  without  differences”
between  the  dangerous  instrumentality  doctrine  and  the  attractive
nuisance doctrine. Whether an apparatus or a condition of property is
involved,  the  key  element  should  be  whether  there  is  a  foreseeable,
“unreasonable  risk  of  death  or  serious  bodily  harm  to  children.”
Restatement, §339(b).

The  Restatement’s  version  of  the  attractive  nuisance  doctrine
balances  society’s  interest  in  protecting  children  with  the  rights  of
landowners to enjoy their property. Even when a landowner is found
to have an attractive nuisance on his or her land, the landowner is left
merely  with  the  burden  of  acting  with  ordinary  care.  A  landowner
does not automatically become liable for any injury a child trespasser
may suffer on that land.

The  requirement  of  foreseeability  is  built  into  the  doctrine.  The
landowner must know or have reason to know that children are likely
to trespass upon the part of the property that contains the dangerous
condition.  See  Section  339(a).  Moreover,  the  landowner’s  duty  “does
not extend to those conditions the existence of which is obvious even
to children and the risk of which should be fully realized by them.” Id.
at Comment i. Also, if the condition of the property that poses the risk
is essential to the landowner, the doctrine would not apply:

“The public interest in the possessor’s free use of his land for his
own  purposes  is  of  great  signiﬁcance.  A  particular  condition  is,
therefore, regarded as not involving unreasonable risk to trespassing
children  unless  it  involves  a  grave  risk  to  them  which  could  be
obviated  without  any  serious  interference  with  the  possessor’s
legitimate use of his land.” Id. at Comment n.

We are satisﬁed that the Restatement view effectively harmonizes
the competing societal interests of protecting children and preserving
property  rights.  In  adopting  the  attractive  nuisance  doctrine,  we
acknowledge  that  the  way  we  live  now  is  different  from  the  way  we
lived  in  1907,  when  Harvey  was  decided.  We  are  not  a  rural  society
any longer, our neighbors live closer, and our use of our own property
affects others more than it once did.

Despite  our  societal  changes,  children  are  still  children.  They  still
learn  through  their  curiosity.  They  still  have  developing  senses  of
judgment. They still do not always appreciate danger. They still need
protection by adults. Protecting children in a changing world requires
the common law to adapt. Today, we make that change.

Finally, we add that on remand should the facts establish that the
attractive  nuisance  doctrine  applies  in  this  case,  that  ﬁnding  would
also  affect  the  duty  of  care  the  appellees  owed  to  Cher  Bennett  if
Cher entered the property to rescue her son.

On  remand,  the  evidence  may  establish  that  Cher’s  status  was
that  of  a  rescuer.  This  court  has  held  pertaining  to  rescuers  that  “if
the  rescuer  does  not  rashly  and  unnecessarily  expose  himself  to
danger, and is injured, the injury should be attributed to the party that
negligently, or wrongfully, exposed to danger, the person who required
assistance.” Pennsylvania Co. v. Langendorf, 28 N.E. 172 (Ohio 1891),
paragraph  three  of  the  syllabus.  While  the  attractive  nuisance
doctrine is not ordinarily applicable to adults, it “may be successfully
invoked by an adult seeking damages for his or her own injury if the
injury  was  suffered  in  an  attempt  to  rescue  a  child  from  a  danger

created  by  the  defendant’s  negligence.”  62  American  Jurisprudence
2d  (1990),  Premises  Liability  §288.  Therefore,  we  hold  that  if  Cher
Bennett  entered  the  Stanleys’  property  to  rescue  her  son  from  an
attractive nuisance, the Stanleys owed her a duty of ordinary care.

Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and

remand the cause to the trial court.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Origins of the Attractive Nuisance Doctrine.  The court in Stanley
discusses  the  turntable  doctrine.  This  was  a  product  of  the
nineteenth century that arose out of a concern for children who were
trespassing  onto  railroad  property  and  getting  hurt  on  turntables.
These  were  devices  designed  to  turn  locomotives  around  to  face  a
different  direction.  Because  the  children  were  coming  onto  the
property  “attracted”  to  the  dangerous  condition  (the  turntables),  and
the  railroads  were  able  to  anticipate  their  presence  and  take
precautions,  courts  treated  these  child  trespassers  differently  than
adults and required reasonable precautions to be taken.

the  doctrine

2.  Artiﬁcial  Conditions.   Notice  that  the
limits  application  of

language  of  the
to  manmade
Restatement
conditions  on  the  defendant’s  land.  It  is  this  limitation  that  has  led
some courts to conclude that the attractive nuisance doctrine should
not  apply  to  swimming  pools  because  water  is  a  natural  hazard —
something  “reasonably  to  be  expected  to  be  fully  understood  and
appreciated  by  any  child  of  an  age  allowed  at  large.”  Restatement
(Second)  §339,  cmt.  j  (1965).  The  Stanley  court  apparently  did  not
agree with this comment from the Restatement.

3.  The  Rescue  Doctrine.   The  majority  in  Stanley  held  that,  in
addition to the child, the parent coming to the aid of the child should
also  have  the  same  duty  of  care  extended  to  them.  The  dissent
disagrees  with  this  extension  of  the  attractive  nuisance  doctrine  to

any  adult,  particularly  because  it  believed  that  the  traditional  rescue
doctrine, covered earlier in this chapter, would yield the same result.

4. Changing Status.  Courts have held that just because someone
enters  land  with  one  status  does  not  mean  they  retain  that  status
regardless  of  the  circumstances.  See  e.g.,  Gladon  v.  Greater
Cleveland  Regional  Transit  Authority,  662  N.E.2d  287  (Ohio  1996)
(plaintiff who held a ticket to ride defendant’s train was no longer an
invitee  when  he  left  public  areas);  Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts
§336  (1965)  (using  illustration  of  a  train’s  customer  who  has  fallen
onto the tracks and been run over, customer should be considered a
trespasser  because  he  was  not  permitted  on  the  tracks).  For
example,  if  someone  enters  a  convenience  store  to  purchase  candy
but enters a back room marked “Staff Only — Not for Use by Public”
— they have shifted from an invitee to a trespasser. Which set of rules
to  apply  to  their  claim  for  personal  injury  would  depend  upon  when
and where their accident occurred. If in the back room, the landowner
would  only  have  to  refrain  from  gross  negligence  (unless  the
attractive nuisance doctrine applied).

5. Problems.  In each of the following scenarios, what duty of care

do the target defendants owe? Why?

A.  Twelve-year-old  Peter  is  aware  that  his  neighbors  have  a  tree
house  built  20  feet  off  the  ground  in  an  old  oak  tree.  Without
their permission, he enters the property and climbs into the tree
house. Despite seeing that it is high off the ground, he decides
to  jump  off.  After  breaking  his  leg,  his  parents  want  to  sue  the
neighbors.

B.  Eight-year-old  Sarah  likes  horses.  Her  house  is  in  a  semi-rural
area and is adjacent to ranch property owned by another family.
Sarah, without permission, climbs through the barbed wire fence
and goes up to pet a horse on the backside. The horse becomes
spooked and kicks her in the head, causing a serious injury. Her
parents want to sue the ranch owners.

C.  Paul  is  a  ten-year-old  boy  who  lives  next  door  to  the  Smith
family. The Smith children are all grown. Nevertheless, they still
have  an  old  rusty  swing  set  in  their  unfenced  yard.  Paul
sometimes  goes  onto  the  property  when  the  Smiths  are  not
around to use the swing set. One evening he decides it would be
fun to use the swing set while the Smiths were asleep. He also
has  been  thinking  of  playing  a  prank  on  the  Smiths  by  toilet
papering  their  trees.  While  it’s  dark  he  enters  the  yard  armed
with rolls of toilet paper and begins throwing them through the
trees.  He  then  gets  on  the  swing  and  begins  swinging
vigorously.  He  failed  to  notice  that  the  chain  on  one  of  the
swings  had  loosened  and  the  swing  collapses,  throwing  him
violently  to  the  ground  and  breaking  his  neck.  He  wants  to  sue
the Smiths.

C. Licensees

Licensees occupy a middle ground between trespassers and invitees.
We have already seen that the traditional duty owed to trespassers is
to avoid hurting them through gross negligence. Invitees are owed a
duty  of  reasonable  care.  Consider  how  the  duty  owed  to  licensees
takes  on  some  attributes  of  each  of  these  foregoing  standards.  The
following case discusses this middle ground.

KNORPP v. HALE
981 S.W.2d 469 (Tex. App. 1998)

     , J.

Bonita  Knorpp  appeals  from  a  directed  verdict  in  a  premises
liability case. Knorpp contends that the trial court erred by ﬁnding her
son, Todd Erwin, to be a licensee rather than an invitee at the time of

his  death  and  by  rendering  a  directed  verdict  against  her  claim  for
damages.

The decedent, Todd Erwin, was killed while cutting down a tree at
the  Hales’  house.  The  evidence  shows  that  he  had  moved  to
Texarkana to be near the Hales’ daughter Autumn, who he had been
dating for about a year, and that he spent a great deal of time at their
house.  The  Hales  were  planning  a  New  Year’s  Eve  bonﬁre  at  a
location in a pasture near their house around the base of a dead pine
tree. They decided to cut down the tree. Erwin went to the house on
December 6, 1994, took the Hales’ chain saw, and began to cut down
the tree. After about forty-ﬁve minutes, the tree fell in an unexpected
direction and landed on Erwin, killing him.

There  was  evidence  that  Erwin  had  worked  with  his  stepfather
cutting and trimming trees. The stepfather testiﬁed that Erwin did not
cut  the  tree  properly.  He  testiﬁed  that  the  vertical  distance  between
Erwin’s  front  and  back  cuts  was  too  great;  that  Erwin  should  have
used a rope to pull the tree in a particular direction and should have
used wedges to direct the tree’s fall.

When Knorpp completed the presentation of her evidence, the trial
court granted the landowner’s motion for a directed verdict and ruled
as  a  matter  of  law  that  Hale  was  a  licensee  and  that  there  was  no
evidence  that  the
landowners  were  negligent  under  applicable
standards for a licensee.

Knorpp  .  .  .  contends  that  there  was  evidence  that  Erwin  was  an

invitee on this particular day when he came onto the property.

The  owner/operator  of  property  owes  the  highest  degree  of  care
to  an  invitee.  An  invitee  has  been  described  as  one  who  enters  on
another’s land with the owner’s knowledge and for the mutual beneﬁt
of  both.  Rosas  v.  Buddies  Food  Store,  518  S.W.2d  534,  536  (Tex.
1975), citing Restatement (Second) of Torts §332 (1965).

A licensee is a person who is privileged to enter or remain on land
only by virtue of the possessor’s consent. Dominguez v. Garcia,  746

S.W.2d 865, 867 (Tex. App. — San Antonio 1988, writ denied), quoting
Restatement (Second) of Torts §330 (1965). Thus, a licensee is one
who enters with permission of the landowner, but does so for his own
convenience or on business for someone other than the owner. Smith
v. Andrews,  832  S.W.2d  395,  397  (Tex.  App. — Fort  Worth  1992,  writ
denied).

A  landowner  owes  an  invitee  a  duty  to  exercise  ordinary  care  to
protect him from risks of which the owner is actually aware and those
risks  of  which  the  owner  should  be  aware  after  reasonable
inspection. Motel 6 G.P., Inc. v. Lopez, 929 S.W.2d 1, 3 (Tex. 1996). To
recover,  a  plaintiff  must  plead  and  prove  that  the  landowner  (1)  had
actual or constructive knowledge of some condition on the premises;
(2) that the condition posed an unreasonable risk of harm; (3) that the
landowner did not exercise reasonable care to reduce or eliminate the
risk; and (4) that the landowner’s failure to use such care proximately
caused  the  plaintiff’s  injuries.  Keetch  v.  Kroger  Co.,  845  S.W.2d  262,
264 (Tex. 1992).

The duty that an owner owes to a licensee is to not injure him by
“willful, wanton or grossly negligent conduct, and that the owner use
ordinary care to either warn a licensee of, or to make reasonably safe,
a dangerous condition of which the owner is aware and the licensee
is not.” State Dept. of Highways v. Payne, 838 S.W.2d 235, 237 (Tex.
1992).  In  order  to  establish  liability,  a  licensee  must  prove  (1)  that  a
condition  of  the  premises  created  an  unreasonable  risk  of  harm  to
him;  (2)  that  the  owner  actually  knew  of  the  condition;  (3)  that  the
licensee  did  not  actually  know  of  the  condition;  (4)  that  the  owner
failed  to  exercise  ordinary  care  to  protect  the  licensee  from  danger;
and (5) that the owner’s failure was a proximate cause of injury to the
licensee.

In the present case, it is admitted by all that Erwin was a regular
visitor to the Hales’ house, that he had his own key to the house and
came  and  went  unsupervised,  and  that  he  was  looked  on  as  a  likely
son-in-law.  He  was  clearly  invited  onto  the  property.  Thus,  it  would

appear that he should be deﬁned as an “invitee.” This is not, however,
the  case.  In  Texas,  a  “social  guest”  is  classiﬁed  as  a  licensee.
Dominguez, 746 S.W.2d 865; McKethan v. McKethan, 477 S.W.2d 357,
361 (Tex. Civ. App. — Corpus Christi 1972, writ ref’d n.r.e.). As set out
above, a host owes a social guest a duty not to injure him by willful,
wanton  or  gross  negligence.  Lower  Neches  Valley  Authority  v.
Murphy, 536 S.W.2d 561, 563 (Tex. 1976).

All  of  the  evidence  in  the  present  case  shows  that  the  decedent
was  invited  onto  the  premises,  but  also  shows  that  he  falls  into  the
category  of  a  “social  guest.”  In  Texas,  as  a  matter  of  law,  he  was  a
licensee. The trial court did not err by ﬁnding him to be a licensee.

Knorpp  .  .  .  contends  that  this  conclusion  is  erroneous  and  that
the trial court erred by rendering a directed verdict in the Hales’ favor,
because  regardless  of  the  decedent’s  usual  status,  a  different  one
existed in this particular situation. She argues that because there was
a discussion, at which the decedent was present, about cutting down
the tree, because Reeda Hale had asked Erwin if he was going to help
her  husband  cut  down  the  tree,  and  because  Erwin  was  going  to  be
present  at  the  bonﬁre,  then  the  cutting  of  the  tree  was  done  for  the
mutual  advantage  (or  beneﬁt)  of  the  decedent  and  the  landowner.
This,  Knorpp  argues,  constitutes  some  evidence  that  the  decedent
was an invitee and that the trial court therefore erred by ﬁnding him
to be a licensee as a matter of law.

In determining whether an individual is an invitee or a licensee, the
cases  typically  use  the
language  “mutual  beneﬁt”  or  “mutual
advantage.”  Knorpp  argues  that  this  term  stretches  so  far  as  to
include an intangible beneﬁt, such as having the opportunity to attend
or conduct the New Year’s Eve bonﬁre.

The  concept  behind  this  language  was  originally  brought  into
Texas  cases  as  a  paraphrase  of  the  predecessor  of  Restatement
(Second)  of  Torts  §332  (1965).  Carlisle  v.  J.  Weingarten,  Inc.,  137
Tex. 220, 152 S.W.2d 1073, 1076 (1941); See Spencer v. Dallas,  819

in

invitee

S.W.2d  612  (Tex.  App. — Dallas  1991,  no  writ).  In  Carlisle,  the  Court
discussed  an
terms  of  business-related  ventures
exclusively, as discussed in the Restatement. Later cases discussed
the necessity of determining who qualiﬁed as an invitee and cited to
the  Restatement  and  cases  applying  the  Restatement  concepts.
However, instead of using the more explicit terminology contained in
1  to  determine  whether  a  person  was  an  invitee,  the
Section  332
courts  instead  looked  to  see  whether  an  entry  was  one  by  a  person
invited and to the “mutual advantage” of both parties.

This  language  does  not  appear  in  the  Restatement’s  description
of  an  “invitee,”  but  is  found  in  65  C.J.S.  Negligence  §63(41)  (1966).
The  “mutual  advantage”  or  “mutual  beneﬁt”  language  found  in  C.J.S.
has  been  repeated  by  numerous  cases,  including  the  most  recent
premises  liability  cases  from  this  court.  See Dabney,  953  S.W.2d  at
536.

The two terminologies were merged in Cowart v. Meeks, 131 Tex.
36, 111 S.W.2d 1105 (1938), where that court discussed the business
relations  between  the  injured  person  and  landowner  as  showing  the
nature  of  his  invitee  status,  and  then  stating  that  in  “the  absence  of
some relation which inures to the mutual benefit of the two, or to that
of  the  owner,  no  invitation  can  be  implied,  and  the  injured  person
must be regarded as a mere licensee.” Crum v. Stasney,  404  S.W.2d
72, 75 (Tex. Civ. App.-Eastland 1966, no writ) (emphasis added).

Thus,  we  have  the  courts  using  language  abstracted  from  C.J.S.
as  a  shorthand  method  of  describing  the  analysis  to  be  used  in
determining  whether  a  party  qualiﬁes  for  the  status  of  “invitee,”  but
actually using the analysis set out in the Restatement.

It  appears  that  the  formula  set  out  by  the  Restatement  for
analysis of invitee/licensee/trespasser status was adopted for use in
Texas  by  Carlisle,  137  Tex.  220,  152  S.W.2d  1073,  as  reiterated  in
Rosa,  518  S.W.2d  at  536,  and  that  it  remains  the  proper  analysis  to
apply.

The  decedent  was  a  social  guest  of  the  landowners.  He  was  not
expecting payment for cutting down the tree, and the evidence is that
no one asked him personally to do so, but that he volunteered to do
so.  There  was  no  business  relationship  or  dealing  in  existence  or
contemplated  between  the  decedent  and  the  landowner,  and  it  is
unquestioned  that  the  land  was  not  open  to  the  public.  Accordingly,
as  a  matter  of  law,  the  decedent  was  not  an  invitee,  but  was  a
licensee on this particular occasion, and the trial court did not err by
so holding.

Knorpp  also  argues  that,  in  the  alternative,  there  was  evidence
that  the  dead  tree  presented  an  unreasonable  risk  of  harm  and  that
there is at least some evidence that the landowners were negligent in
failing  to  warn  of  the  danger  involved  in  cutting  down  the  tree.  This
contention  is  based  upon  Knorpp’s  contention  that  the  landowners
were  aware  of  the  risk  of  harm  and  failed  to  use  reasonable  care  to
reduce the risk. . . . Even if we analyze this argument as an attempt to
show liability for a licensee, the attempt fails on several grounds.

In the present case, the undisputed evidence is that the decedent
had worked with his father trimming and felling trees and that he had
at  least  a  passing  acquaintance  with  the  dangers  involved.  The
undisputed  evidence  also  shows  that  the  landowners  were  unaware
of any special dangers involved in cutting down a dead tree. Thus, the
evidence shows that the licensee was aware of the danger involved in
the action that he intentionally undertook.

The evidence also shows that the tree itself was not a dangerous
condition.  The  worry  stated  by  the  landowners  was  that  if  they
burned it in the bonﬁre, it would fall on someone. Cutting the tree was
the act that caused the danger.

Counsel attempts to compare this situation to a slip-and-fall case
where  the  ice  on  the  floor  is  not  dangerous  of  itself — it  becomes
dangerous  only  when  someone  slips  on  it.  We  do  not  accept  this
basic  premise.  Ice  on  the  floor  is  generally  a  dangerous  condition  in

itself.  A  dangerous  condition

is  one  which  creates  a
and  of
substantial risk of injury when the property is used with due care in a
manner in which it is reasonably foreseeable that it will be used. It is
generally foreseeable that a floor will be used by people walking, and
thus,  a  substantial  risk  of  injury  is  foreseeable.  In  the  present  case,
the  tree  at  that  time  was  not  in  a  condition  that  it  was  likely  to  fall
until  someone  cut  or  burned  the  tree.  Therefore,  the  dangerous
condition of the tree did not occur until it was cut.

In summary, the condition did not exist until Erwin began cutting
the tree, thus, it was not a “condition of the premises”; the owner did
not  know  that  the  licensee  was  creating  a  dangerous  condition;  and
the  licensee  was  the  one  creating  the  condition.  In  light  of  those
facts, there was nothing for the landowner to warn the licensee about,
because  no  dangerous  condition  existed  until  it  was  created  by  the
licensee and, therefore, no duty to warn was shown by the evidence.

The judgment is afﬁrmed.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Duty  Owed  to  Licensees.   While  the  duty  owed  to  trespassers
(normally)  is  to  refrain  from  gross  negligence,  the  duty  owed  to
invitees  is  to  use  reasonable  care.  The  duty  owed  to  licensees  is  a
hybrid — with  regard  to  dangerous  activities  (conducted  by  or  under
the  control  of  the  landowner),  the  duty  is  to  avoid  gross  negligence.
With regard to dangerous conditions on the land, the duty is triggered
by actual knowledge of the condition. Only then does the landowner
owe a duty of reasonable care to warn or remove the danger. Why did
the  plaintiff’s  evidence  in  Knorpp  fail  to  show  a  possible  violation  of
these hybrid standards?

2. Social Guests as Licensees.  The plaintiff took the position that
because he had a standing invitation to be on the land that he must
be  considered  an  “invitee.”  He  also  argues  that  because  he  removed

the  tree  for  the  “mutual  beneﬁt”  of  the  defendant,  he  must  also  be
considered  an  invitee.  Why  does  the  court  reject  both  of  these
arguments?  As  between  social  guests  and  random  members  of  the
public who are enticed to come upon your land, does the landowner
have a closer or “special” relationship with one more than the other?
Some  believe  these  two  categories  should  be  the  opposite,  with  the
social guest licensee owed the greater duty. The explanation usually
given by the courts for the classiﬁcation of social guests as licensees
is that there is a common understanding that the guest is expected to
take the premises as the possessor himself uses them, and does not
expect and is not entitled to expect that they will be prepared for his
reception.  See  Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts  §330,  cmt.  (h)(3)
(1965).  Not  all  courts  applying  the  traditional  rules  agree  with  this
characterization of social guests.

3. Police, Fireﬁghters, and Meter Readers.  Most courts hold, as a
matter  of  law,  that  police  and  ﬁreﬁghters  coming  onto  your  land
during  an  emergency  take  the  status  of  a  licensee  rather  than  an
invitee.  Of  course,  depending  on  the  nature  of  their  injury  the
firefighter  rule  might  preclude  any  duty  whatsoever,  but  remember
that there are limits to that doctrine’s application. Public utility meter
readers are considered, by contrast, to be invitees of the landowner.

D. Invitees

Landowners  owe  their  invitees  a  duty  of  reasonable  care  under  the
circumstances.  This  applies  with  respect  to  activities  undertaken  on
land.  With  respect  to  dangerous  conditions,  the  duty  of
the
is  triggered  by  either  actual  or  constructive
reasonable  care
knowledge.  In  cases  of  constructive  knowledge,  a  common  inquiry
consists  of  determining  the  length  of  time  that  the  dangerous
condition existed without being dealt with by the owner. The following
two cases discuss this triggering concept of constructive knowledge

and  time.  Commodore  deals  with  a  scenario  involving  a  ceiling  that
was  permitted  to  deteriorate  over  a  long  period.  The  next  case
involves  a  slip  and  fall,  a  type  of  case  where  courts  frequently
struggle to determine the passage of time.

1. Time as a Trigger of Duty

RICHARDSON v. THE COMMODORE
599 N.W.2d 693 (Iowa 1999)

      , J.

Appellant,  Russell  Richardson,  was  injured  at  a  bar  owned  and
operated  by  the  defendants/appellees  when  a  portion  of  the  ceiling
fell  on  him.  His  suit  against  the  defendants  was  dismissed  on  their
motion  for  summary  judgment.  The  court  of  appeals  afﬁrmed.  On
further review, we ﬁnd sufﬁcient evidence to create a jury question on
Richardson’s  premises  liability  claim.  Therefore,  we  vacate  the  court
of  appeals  decision  and  reverse  the  judgment  of  the  district  court,
remanding for further proceedings.

The  record  shows  that,  at  the  time  of  Richardson’s  injury,  The
Commodore  Tap  was  a  bar  operated  by  the  appellee,  The
Commodore,  Inc.  Appellees  Ralph  and  Betty  Hauerwas  owned  the
corporation as well as the building in which the bar was located.

The accident giving rise to this action occurred on September 12,
1994.  While  shooting  pool  at  the  bar  on  that  date,  Richardson  was
suddenly struck by falling plaster. Richardson thereafter brought this
action  against  the  defendants  to  recover  damages  for  his  physical
injuries.  Richardson’s  claim  was  based  on  a  theory  of  premises
liability. He alleged that he was a business invitee and the collapse of
the  ceiling  and  his  resulting  injuries  were  caused  by  the  defendants’

negligence  in  failing  to  maintain  the  premises  in  a  reasonably  safe
condition.

The record shows that the building that housed The Commodore
Tap  was  built  in  1913.  Ralph  and  Betty  Hauerwas  acquired  the
building in 1982, and subsequently moved their tavern business into
it. The tavern was on the ﬁrst floor of this two-story building. Prior to
opening for business, the Hauerwases contracted with Wayne Blumer
to  repair  portions  of  the  plaster  ceiling  of  the  ﬁrst  floor  where  the
wood lath had been exposed by the removal of some partition walls.
Blumer did not notice any signs of damage to or other problems with
the plaster ceiling at the time of his repairs.

In 1985, the Hauerwases installed a drop ceiling on the ﬁrst floor
of  the  building  to  improve  the  efﬁciency  of  heating  and  cooling  the
premises. They did not notice any problems with the plaster ceiling at
that  time.  Between  1985  and  the  date  of  the  accident  in  1994,  the
Hauerwases did not inspect the plaster ceiling, were unaware of any
problems in that ceiling, and made no repairs to it.

It  is  undisputed  that  Richardson  was  struck  by  a  portion  of  the
original  (1913)  plaster  ceiling  when  the  plaster  separated  from  the
lath  and  fell  through  the  drop  ceiling.  Blumer  repaired  the  plaster
ceiling after its collapse in 1994. He estimated that a piece of ceiling
measuring  two  feet  by  ﬁve  feet  fell.  This  piece  was  not  close  to  the
areas  he  had  repaired  in  1982.  Blumer  testiﬁed  that  the  ceiling
collapsed  due  to  its  age  and  the  effect,  over  time,  of  vibration  from
heavy trafﬁc on the adjoining street. He thought this particular area of
the ceiling may have fallen off because it was thicker than the rest of
the  plaster  ceiling.  While  making  the  repairs
in  1994,  Blumer
inspected the remainder of the plaster ceiling by looking through the
drop ceiling where the tiles had been pushed off by falling plaster, and
using  a  spotlight  to  view  whether  the  plaster  was  sagging  in  any
other areas.

As  noted  above,  Richardson’s  suit  is  based  on  a  theory  of
premises  liability.  The  district  court  granted  the  defendants’  motion
for summary judgment, holding there was no evidence they knew or
should have known of the dangerous condition of the plaster ceiling.

The general rule applicable to the liability of possessors of land for
injuries caused by conditions on the land is found in the Restatement
(Second) of Torts:

A  possessor  of  land  is  subject  to  liability  for  physical  harm
caused to his invitees by a condition on the land if, but only if, he

(a)  knows  or  by  the  exercise  of  reasonable  care  would
discover the condition, and should realize that it involves an
unreasonable risk of harm to such invitees, and

(b) should expect that they will not discover or realize the

danger, or will fail to protect themselves against it, and

(c)  fails  to  exercise  reasonable  care  to  protect  them

against the danger.

Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts  §343,  at  215-16  (1965).  The  parties
do not dispute Richardson’s status as an invitee nor the defendants’
status as possessors of the land. The dispute in this case centers on
the requirement that the defendants know of the dangerous condition
or  by  the  exercise  of  reasonable  care  should  have  known  of  the
condition.

Although  Richardson  does  not  contend  that  the  defendants  had
actual  knowledge  of  the  condition  of  the  plaster  ceiling,  he  argues
that  this  knowledge  should  be  imputed  to  them  because  the
defendants  created  the  dangerous  condition  by  installing  the  drop
ceiling.  Alternatively,  he  claims  that  if  the  defendants  had  exercised
reasonable  care  in  inspecting  the  plaster  ceiling,  they  would  have
discovered  the  condition  of  the  ceiling.  We  discuss  these  issues
separately.

Knowledge of a dangerous condition is imputed to a possessor of
land  who  has  created  the  condition  that  causes  the  plaintiff’s  injury.
See  Ling  v.  Hosts,  Inc.,  164  N.W.2d  123,  126  (Iowa  1969);  Smith  v.
Cedar  Rapids  Country  Club,  255  Iowa  1199,  1210,  124  N.W.2d  557,
564 (1963). For example, in Smith, the plaintiff was injured when she
slipped  and  fell  on  a  floor  that  had  been  waxed  to  an  uneven  and
extremely  slippery  ﬁnish.  There  was  no  dispute  that  the  defendant
had applied the ﬁnish to the floor. We stated that when “the condition
has been created by the owner[,] . . . he will not be heard to deny he
had notice of it.” Id. at 567.

This  rule  does  not,  however,  help  the  plaintiff  here.  There  is  no
evidence  that  the  defendants  created  the  condition  in  the  plaster
ceiling  that caused it to fall.  The  defendants  merely  installed  a  drop
ceiling  over  the  plaster  ceiling,  and  there  is  nothing  in  the  record  to
indicate that the drop ceiling contributed in any way to the collapse of
the  plaster  ceiling.  Therefore,  knowledge  of  the  dangerous  condition
in the plaster ceiling cannot be imputed to the defendants.

The  defendants’  duty  of  reasonable  care  as  possessors  of  the
premises  extends  to  an  inspection  of  the  premises  to  discover  any
dangerous  conditions  or  latent  defects,  “‘followed  by  such  repair,
safeguards,  or  warning  as  may  be  reasonably  necessary  for  [the
invitee’s]  protection  under  the  circumstances.’”  Wieseler  v. Sisters  of
Mercy  Health  Corp.,  540  N.W.2d  445,  450  (Iowa  1995)  (quoting
Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts  §343  cmt.  b,  at  216).  The  action
necessary to satisfy this duty of reasonable care depends upon “the
nature of the land and the purposes for which it is used.” Restatement
(Second) of Torts §343 cmt. e, at 217. “The duty of one who operates
a  place  of  entertainment  or  amusement  is  higher  than  that  of  the
owner of private property generally.” Grall v. Meyer, 173 N.W.2d 61, 63
(Iowa 1969).

[In  this  case,  the  facts]  could  support  a

jury  ﬁnding  that
reasonable care warranted an inspection. Although the plaster ceiling
had not collapsed in the past, the defendants were aware of the age

inspection  was  not  an  onerous  and

of the ceiling (it was built in 1913), and they should have realized that
a  falling  ceiling  posed  a  serious  danger  to  their  patrons.  Even  more
impractical
important,  an
burden . . . . Here, with a ladder and a flashlight, the defendants could
have conducted periodic inspections by simply lifting a ceiling tile in
the  drop  ceiling  and  viewing  the  original  ceiling,  as  Blumer  did  after
the accident in 1994. We think these facts . . . provide an evidentiary
basis  for  a  jury  ﬁnding  that  the  defendants’  duty  of  reasonable  care
included inspection for hidden defects in the plaster ceiling.

Of course, a failure to inspect is relevant only to the extent such an
inspection  would  have  revealed  the  defect  in  the  ceiling.  See
Restatement (Second) of Torts §343, at 215 (imposing liability only if
the  possessor  knew  or  would  have  discovered  the  defect  in  the
exercise of reasonable care). The record in this case shows that the
plaster ceiling fell because the plaster separated from the wood lath.
In  addition,  the  record  reveals  that  the  cause  of  this  separation  was
vibration of the ceiling over many years caused by trafﬁc outside the
building.  We  think  the  jury  could  make  a  common-sense  inference
from this evidence that the separation would not occur instantly, but
that the plaster would gradually separate over time and begin to sag,
thereby resulting in an appearance observable to someone looking at
the  ceiling.  In  fact,  the  repairman,  Blumer,  testiﬁed  that  was  exactly
what  he  was  looking  for  when  he  inspected  the  ceiling  after
Richardson’s  accident — signs  of  sagging  that  would  indicate  the
need  for  additional  repairs.  Therefore,  we  conclude  that  the  plaintiff
generated a jury question on whether the defect in the ceiling would
have been discoverable upon inspection.

We  think  material  issues  of  disputed  fact  exist  as  to  whether
reasonable  care  warranted  an  inspection  of  the  plaster  ceiling  and
whether such an inspection would have alerted the defendants to the
dangerous condition of the ceiling. Therefore, the district court erred
in ruling that the defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of
law.

WAL-MART STORES, INC. v. GONZALEZ
968 S.W.2d 934 (Tex. 1998)

        , J.

The  question  in  this  slip-and-fall  case  is  what  quantum  of
circumstantial  evidence  is  legally  sufﬁcient  to  support  a  ﬁnding  that
an  unreasonably  dangerous  condition  has  existed  long  enough  to
charge  a  proprietor  with  constructive  notice  of  the  condition.  The
court  of  appeals  held  that  there  was  legally  sufﬁcient  evidence  that
some macaroni salad had existed on the Wal-Mart floor long enough
to charge Wal-Mart with constructive notice of the condition. We hold
that  when  circumstantial  evidence
to  prove
constructive notice, the evidence must establish that it is more likely
than not that the dangerous condition existed long enough to give the
proprietor  a  reasonable  opportunity  to  discover  the  condition.
Because  we  conclude  that  the  circumstantial  evidence  in  this  case
supports  only  the  possibility  that  the  dangerous  condition  existed
long enough to give Wal-Mart a reasonable opportunity to discover it,
we reverse and render judgment for Wal-Mart.

Flora  Gonzalez  visited  the  Rio  Grande  City  Wal-Mart  with  her
daughter and two granddaughters. While walking in a busy aisle from
the  cafeteria  toward  a  store  refrigerator,  Gonzalez  stepped  on  some
cooked  macaroni  salad  that  came  from  the  Wal-Mart  cafeteria.
Gonzalez  slipped  and  fell,  sustaining  painful  injuries  to  her  back,
shoulder,  and  knee.  Gonzalez  sued  Wal-Mart  for  negligence.  A  jury
awarded  her  $100,000  and  the  trial  court  rendered  judgment  on  the
verdict.  The  court  of  appeals,  with  one  justice  dissenting,  reduced
Gonzalez’s  damages  to  $96,700  and  afﬁrmed  the  judgment  as
modiﬁed.

Gonzalez  was  Wal-Mart’s  invitee.  As  such,  Wal-Mart  owed  her  a
duty  to  exercise  reasonable  care  to  protect  her  from  dangerous
conditions in the store known or discoverable to it. Rosas v. Buddies

Food  Store,  518  S.W.2d  534,  536-37  (Tex.  1975).  However,  a  land
possessor’s duty toward its invitee does not make the possessor an
insurer of the invitee’s safety. McElhenny v. Thielepape, 155 Tex. 319,
285  S.W.2d  940,  941  (Tex.  1956).  To  recover  damages  in  a  slip-and-
fall case, a plaintiff must prove:

(1)  Actual  or  constructive  knowledge  of  some  condition  on

the premises by the owner/operator;

(2) That the condition posed an unreasonable risk of harm;
(3) That the owner/operator did not exercise reasonable care

to reduce or eliminate the risk; and

(4)  That  the  owner/operator’s  failure  to  use  such  care

proximately caused the plaintiff’s injuries.

Keetch v. Kroger Co., 845 S.W.2d 262, 264 (Tex. 1992).

issue

The  central

in  this  case

is  whether  Wal-Mart  had
constructive knowledge of the spilled macaroni. Wal-Mart argues that
the  evidence  is  legally  insufﬁcient  to  show  that  the  macaroni  had
been  on  the  floor  long  enough  to  charge  Wal-Mart  with  constructive
notice.  When  reviewing  a  legal  sufﬁciency  point,  this  court  “must
consider only the evidence and inferences tending to support the trial
court’s  ﬁnding,  disregarding  all  contrary  evidence  and  inferences.”
Continental Coffee Prods. Co. v. Cazarez, 937 S.W.2d 444, 450 (Tex.
1996). However, meager circumstantial evidence from which equally
plausible  but  opposite  inferences  may  be  drawn  is  speculative  and
thus legally insufﬁcient to support a ﬁnding. See Hammerly Oaks, Inc.
v.  Edwards,  958  S.W.2d  387,  392  (Tex.  1997);  see  also  Browning-
Ferris, Inc. v. Reyna, 865 S.W.2d 925, 928 (Tex. 1993) (holding that a
factual  ﬁnding  must  be  supported  by  more  than  mere  surmise  or
suspicion).

No  witnesses  testiﬁed  that  they  had  seen  or  were  aware  of  the
spilled macaroni before Gonzalez slipped on it. However, as evidence
that  the  macaroni  had  been  on  the  floor  for  a  prolonged  period  of

time, Gonzalez testiﬁed that the macaroni had mayonnaise in it, was
“fresh,”  “wet,”  “still  humid,”  and  contaminated  with  “a  lot  of  dirt.”
Gonzalez’s  daughter  testiﬁed  that  the  macaroni  had  footprints  and
cart track marks in it and “seemed like it had been there a while.” The
court  of  appeals  held  this  evidence  legally  sufﬁcient  to  support  the
verdict, apparently calling for a relaxed burden of proof in slip-and-fall
cases when the evidence is scant:

A  plaintiff  has  the  obligation  to  produce  the  evidence  that  exists.  If  a  court
requires more than is possible to prove, the court has taken over the legislative
function of simply deciding that there will be no negligence cause of action for
slip and falls. No court has done this, and the cause of action exists. The great
majority of slip-and-fall cases are lost at the trial level and, no doubt, always will
be. But this court is not willing to say that an injured person must go beyond the
evidence that is created by the operative facts, which would be an impossibility.
Of  course,  there  may  be  cases  where  there  is  simply  not  enough  evidence  to
make a case, even if it is all produced. This is not such a case though.

However, “the fact that proof of causation is difﬁcult does not provide
a  plaintiff  with  an  excuse  to  avoid  introducing  some  evidence  of
causation.” Schæfer v. Texas Employers’ Ins. Ass’n, 612 S.W.2d 199,
205 (Tex. 1980). As the dissent in the court of appeals explained, “the
harsh  reality  is  that  if  the  plaintiff  cannot  prove  facts  to  support  her
cause  of  action,  there  is  simply  no  recovery.  This  is  true  not  only  in
slip and fall cases, but in all cases.”

Dirt  in  macaroni  salad  lying  on  a  heavily-traveled  aisle  is  no
evidence  of  the  length  of  time  the  macaroni  had  been  on  the  floor.
That evidence can no more support the inference that it accumulated
dirt  over  a  long  period  of  time  than  it  can  support  the  opposite
inference  that  the  macaroni  had  just  been  dropped  on  the  floor  and
was  quickly  contaminated  by  customers  and  carts  traversing  the
aisle.  In  Furr’s  Supermarkets,  Inc.  v.  Arellano,  492  S.W.2d  727  (Tex.
Civ.  App. — El  Paso  1973,  writ  ref’d  n.r.e.),  another  spilled-macaroni
case,  the  court  held  that  testimony  that  the  dried  macaroni  noodles
that caused the plaintiff’s fall were “soiled, scattered and appeared as

though other persons had passed through the area and had been run
over  presumably  by  another  cart  or  carts”  was  no  evidence  of  the
length  of  time  the  macaroni  noodles  had  been  there.  Id.  at  728;  see
also  H.E.  Butt  Grocery  Co.  v.  Rodriguez,  441  S.W.2d  215,  217  (Tex.
Civ. App. — Corpus Christi 1969, no writ) (holding that testimony that
the  grape  on  which  plaintiff  slipped  was  squashed  and  muddy,  that
the  floor  was  dirty,  and  that  pieces  of  paper  were  strewn  around
nearby  was  no  evidence  that  the  grape  had  been  on  the  floor  long
enough  to  charge  the  store  with  notice);  H.E.  Butt  Grocery  Store  v.
Hamilton,  632  S.W.2d  189,  191  (Tex.  App. — Corpus  Christi  1982,  no
writ)  (holding  that  testimony  that  grapes  were  stepped  on  and  that
the juices from both red and green grapes had blended together was
no evidence of how long the grapes were on the floor). There were no
comparisons between the dirt on the macaroni salad and the dirt on
the surrounding floorspace that would justify the inference, relied on
in H.E. Butt Grocery Co. v. Heaton, 547 S.W.2d 75, 76 (Tex. Civ. App.
— Waco 1977, no writ), that the macaroni salad had been on the floor
as  long  as  the  surrounding  dirt  on  the  floor,  or  that  the  dirt  on  the
macaroni  salad  had  dried,  suggesting  that  it  had  been  there  for  a
prolonged period of time.

The  presence  of  footprints  or  cart  tracks  in  the  macaroni  salad
equally supports the inference that the tracks were of recent origin as
it  supports  the  opposite  inference,  that  the  tracks  had  been  there  a
long time. In Kimbell, Inc. v. Roberson, 570 S.W.2d 587, 590 (Tex. Civ.
App. — Tyler  1978,  no  writ),  the  court  rejected  testimony  that  two  or
three  tracks  that  had  been  made  through  a  syrupy  or  jelly-like
substance  on  which  plaintiff  slipped  tended  to  show  that  the
substance  had  been  there  long  enough  to  charge  the  store  with
constructive  notice.  The  court  explained,  “It  is  just  as  likely  that  the
tracks were made by customers traversing the aisle only minutes or
even seconds before plaintiff’s fall.” Id. at 590.

The  testimony  that  the  macaroni  salad  “seemed  like  it  had  been
there awhile” is mere speculative, subjective opinion of no evidentiary

value. The witnesses had not seen the macaroni salad prior to the fall
and had no personal knowledge of the length of time it had been on
the floor. See Robledo, 597 S.W.2d at 561 (holding that the trial court
committed  no  error  in  sustaining  objection  to  plaintiff’s  testimony
that  the  water  “had  been  there  for  some  time”  because  the  plaintiff
had no personal knowledge of how long the puddle had been there).

We  hold  that  the  evidence  that  the  macaroni  salad  had  “a  lot  of
dirt”  and  tracks  through  it  and  the  subjective  testimony  that  the
macaroni salad “seemed like it had been there awhile” is no evidence
that the macaroni had been on the floor long enough to charge Wal-
Mart  with  constructive  notice  of  this  condition.  Gonzalez  had  to
demonstrate that it was more likely than not that the macaroni salad
had  been  there  for  a  long  time;  Gonzalez  proved  only  that  the
macaroni salad could possibly have been there long enough to make
Wal-Mart responsible for noticing it.

Because  there  is  no  evidence  that  Wal-Mart  had  constructive
notice  of  the  actual  existence  of  spilled  macaroni,  this  Court  grants
Wal-Mart’s  petition  for  review,  and  reverses  the  court  of  appeals’
judgment and renders judgment that Flora Gonzalez take nothing.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Constructive Knowledge.  It should not be surprising that many
cases  brought  by  invitees  based  upon  dangerous  conditions  are
premised upon constructive knowledge. This is because if the owner
has actual knowledge and fails to take any remedial action the breach
of  duty  is  fairly  obvious.  More  contentious  are  the  claims  where  the
owner  has  no  actual  knowledge,  but  the  claimant  alleges  that  they
should  have  known  of  the  dangerous  condition.  The  court  in
Commodore  mentions  two  ways  to  demonstrate  constructive
knowledge.  What  are  those  two  ways  and  why  did  they  both  fail  in
that case?

the

2.  Overlapping  Duties  of  Care.   As

foregoing  cases
demonstrate, landowners owe a duty of reasonable care toward their
invitees  with  regard  to  dangerous  activities  conducted  on  their  land,
and with regard to dangerous conditions of which the landowner has
actual  or  constructive  knowledge.  With  regard  to  licensees,  they
occupy a middle ground between the general duty of reasonable care
owed to invitees and the duty only to avoid recklessness owed toward
trespassers.  There  is  a  borrowing  of  the  duties  in  the  case  of
licensees  based  upon  the  distinction  between  activities  and
dangerous conditions. This is analogous to the general dichotomy in
tort
law  between  acts  and  omissions.  Liability  for  dangerous
conditions could essentially be considered a claim that the landowner
failed  to  take  action  to  remedy  or  warn  about  such  conditions — an
omission. As a hybrid of the two other sets of duties, the landowner’s
duties  toward  licensees  is  mixed.  With  regard  to  activities,  the
landowner  must  avoid  recklessness.  With  regard  to  dangerous
conditions,  the  landowner  must  exercise  reasonable  care  (though
only when the owner has actual knowledge of the condition).

3.  Slip-and-Fall  Cases.   There  are  many  slip-and-fall  claims
brought  by  invitees  where  the  issue  of  constructive  knowledge
depends  upon  some  showing  that  the  condition  existed  for  an
unreasonably  long  time  without  being  discovered  and  remediated.  If
the plaintiff can show the length of time the condition persisted, then
the  jury  might  be  able  to  conclude  that  this  time  was  more  than
sufﬁcient to permit the landowner to ﬁnd and ﬁx the issue. When the
plaintiff  cannot  demonstrate  the  length  of  time,  even  approximately,

many courts hold that they have failed to meet their burden of proof
required  to  trigger  any  duty  of  care.  There  are  many  cases  involving
slip-and-fall injuries in grocery stores where the issue of constructive
knowledge focuses upon the various adjectives used to describe the
food  products  on  the  floor  as  a  means  of  demonstrating  time.  This
can be a difﬁcult way to trigger the duty of care as the intermediate
appellate  court  in  Wal-Mart  sympathized.  This  ruling  still  illustrates
the  majority  approach  to  analyzing  the  trigger  of  duty  when  there  is
no evidence of actual knowledge.

2. Open and Obvious Dangers

O’SULLIVAN v. SHAW
726 N.E.2d 951 (Mass. 2000)

     , J.

The  plaintiff  seeks  to  recover  for  injuries  he  sustained  when  he
dived,  headﬁrst,  into  the  shallow  end  of  a  swimming  pool  owned  by
located  on  their  residential  property.  His
the  defendants  and
complaint  alleges  that  the  defendants  were  negligent  in  allowing
visitors to dive into the shallow end of the pool and in failing to warn
of  the  danger  associated  with  this  activity.  A  judge  in  the  Superior
Court  allowed  the  defendants’  motion  for  summary
judgment,
reasoning that diving into the shallow end of a swimming pool is an
open and obvious danger which was known to the plaintiff, and that
the defendants therefore did not owe the plaintiff a duty of care. The
plaintiff timely appealed, and we transferred the case here on our own
motion. We afﬁrm.

The pool in question is an in-ground type, measuring eighteen feet
in width by thirty-six feet in length, with both shallow and deep ends.
The bottom of the pool is level in the shallow end, for approximately

ten feet of the pool’s length, after which it slopes gradually toward the
deep end, the sides of which are tapered. When ﬁlled to capacity, the
pool  is  four  feet  deep  at  its  shallowest  point  and  eight  feet  at  its
deepest.  There  are  no  markers,  either  in  the  pool  or  on  its  exterior
surround,  to  indicate  the  pool’s  depth  at  various  points  along  its
length or to demarcate the separation of its shallow and deep ends.
However,  a  diving  board  is  afﬁxed  to  the  exterior  of  the  pool  at  its
deep end. The pool’s interior is covered with a vinyl liner and there is
no underwater lighting, so that the bottom of the pool is not visible at
night.

The plaintiff, who was a friend of the defendants’ granddaughter,
had swum in the pool at least once prior to the night of the accident,
during  daylight  hours.  He  had  observed  various  swimmers  dive  into
the  pool’s  deep  end  from  the  diving  board.  He  also  saw  swimmers
dive into the pool from the shallow end by performing a flat or “racing
dive,”  i.e.,  diving  headﬁrst,  with  arms  outstretched  over  their  heads,
landing in the water at an angle roughly parallel to the bottom of the
pool, gliding just beneath the water’s surface and eventually surfacing
in  the  deep  end.  The  plaintiff  himself  had  previously  dived  into  the
pool’s  deep  end  from  the  diving  board  two  or  three  times,  and  had
made  one  dive  into  the  shallow  end.  Although  he  did  not  know  the
exact  dimensions  of
the  plaintiff  was  aware  of
approximately where the shallow part ended. Moreover, he was aware
of  the  shallow  end’s  approximate  depth,  having  observed  other
swimmers standing in that part of the pool and having subsequently
stood next to these people outside the pool.

the  pool,

On  the  evening  of  July  16,  1996,  the  plaintiff,  then  twenty-one
years  of  age,  was  a  guest  of  the  defendants’  granddaughter  at  the
defendants’  residence.  The  defendants  were  out  of  town,  but  their
granddaughter had permission to be on the premises and to use the
swimming  pool.  Sometime  between  9  and  9:30  P.M.  the  plaintiff
suffered injuries to his neck and back when he dived into the shallow
end of the pool. At the time, he was attempting, in racing dive fashion,

to  clear  the  ten-foot  expanse  of  the  shallow  end  and  surface  in  the
deep end, but he entered the water at too steep an angle and struck
his  head  on  the  pool  bottom,  resulting  in  a  fracture  of  his  cervical
vertebrae. By his own admission, the plaintiff knew that he could be
injured  if  he  were  to  hit  his  head  on  the  bottom  of  the  pool  when
diving, and his purpose in trying to clear the shallow end was to avoid
the  sort  of  accident  that  occurred.  The  plaintiff’s  injury  caused
immediate  paralysis  in  his  lower  extremities  and  required  a  two-day
stay in the hospital, but the paralysis was not permanent.

An  owner  or  possessor  of  land  owes  a  common-law  duty  of
reasonable  care  to  all  persons  lawfully  on  the  premises.  This  duty
includes an obligation to “maintain[] his property in a reasonably safe
condition in view of all the circumstances, including the likelihood of
injury  to  others,  the  seriousness  of  the  injury,  and  the  burden  of
avoiding the risk,” Mounsey v. Ellard, 708,  297  N.E.2d  43  (1978),  and
“to warn visitors of any unreasonable dangers of which the landowner
is aware or reasonably should be aware.” Davis  v. Westwood Group,
supra,  and  cases  cited.  However,  a  landowner  is  “not  obliged  to
supply a place of maximum safety, but only one which would be safe
to a person who exercises such minimum care as the circumstances
reasonably  indicate.”  Lyon  v.  Morphew,  424  Mass,  678  N.E.2d  1306
(1997). Moreover, it is well established in our law of negligence that a
landowner’s  duty  to  protect
lawful  visitors  against  dangerous
conditions on his property ordinarily does not extend to dangers that
would  be  obvious  to  persons  of  average  intelligence.  See  Lyon  v.
Morphew, supra. Landowners are relieved of the duty to warn of open
and  obvious  dangers  on  their  premises  because  it  is  not  reasonably
foreseeable that a visitor exercising (as the law presumes) reasonable
care for his own safety would suffer injury from such blatant hazards.
Stated  otherwise,  where  a  danger  would  be  obvious  to  a  person  of
ordinary  perception  and  judgment,  a  landowner  may  reasonably
assume that a visitor has knowledge of it and, therefore, “any further
warning  would  be  an  empty  form”  that  would  not  reduce  the

likelihood of resulting harm. LeBlanc v. Atlantic Bldg. & Supply Co., 84
N.E.2d 10 (1949).

Although  we  have  not  previously  addressed  this  precise  issue,
Massachusetts courts have continued to apply the open and obvious
danger  rule  in  cases  decided  after  the  Legislature’s  abolition  of  the
assumption of risk defense, thereby at least implicitly recognizing the
rule’s continuing viability. Assumption of risk, along with contributory
negligence,  was  an  afﬁrmative  defense  to  negligence  for  which  the
defendant  bore  the  burden  of  proof  at  trial.  A  plaintiff  assumed  the
risk of harm when he voluntarily exposed himself to a known danger
which  had  been  caused  by  the  defendant’s  negligence;  the  focus  of
the inquiry was thus on the plaintiff’s own carelessness or negligence
in failing to avoid a hazard which he knew about and appreciated. By
contrast, the open and obvious danger doctrine arises in connection
with the separate issue of a defendant’s duty to protect others from
dangerous  conditions  about  which  the  defendant  knows  or  should
know. Callahan v. Boston Edison Co., 24 Mass. App. Ct. 950, 953, 509
N.E.2d 1208 (1987) (“Whether a danger is open and obvious has to do
with  the  duty  of  the  defendant,  not  the  negligence  of  the  plaintiff”).
Rather
subjective
in  encountering  a  known
reasonableness  or  unreasonableness
hazard,  the  inquiry  is  an  objective  one  that  focuses,  instead,  on  the
reasonableness  of  the  defendant’s  conduct:  it  presumes  a  plaintiff’s
exercising  reasonable  care  for  his  own  safety  and  asks  whether  the
dangerous  condition  was,  objectively  speaking,  so  obvious  that  the
defendant  would  be  reasonable  in  concluding  that  an  ordinarily
intelligent plaintiff would perceive and avoid it and, therefore, that any
further warning would be superfluous.

a  particular  plaintiff’s

evaluating

than

Thus, the superseded common-law defense of assumption of risk
goes  to  a  plaintiff’s  failure  to  exercise  due  care  for  his  own  safety,
whereas the open and obvious danger rule concerns the existence of
a defendant’s duty of care, which the plaintiff must establish as part

of his prima facie case before any comparative analysis of fault may
be performed.

The  remaining  issue  concerns  whether  the  judge,  in  granting
summary  judgment  for  the  defendants,  correctly  concluded  that  the
open and obvious danger rule obviated any duty to warn the plaintiff
not  to  dive  headﬁrst  into  the  shallow  end  of  the  defendants’
swimming  pool.  Plain  common  sense,  bolstered  by  the  weight  of
authority in other jurisdictions where this issue has been addressed,
convince  us  that  this  conclusion  is  indisputably  correct.  See,  e.g.,
Lederman v. Pacific Indus., 939 F. Supp. 619, 625 (N.D. Ill. 1996), aff’d,
119  F.3d  551  (7th  Cir.  1997)  (under  Illinois  law,  manufacturer  of
swimming pool under no duty to warn adult of danger of quadriplegia
posed by diving into water of uncertain depth); Neff v. Coleco Indus.,
Inc. 760 F. Supp. 864, 868 (D. Kan. 1991), aff’d, 961 F.2d 220 (10th Cir.
1992) (manufacturer had no duty to warn of open and obvious risk of
diving headﬁrst into shallow swimming pool).

Finally, the plaintiff argues that, in concluding that the danger was
open and obvious, the judge improperly considered subjective factors
particular  to  this  plaintiff,  thus  revealing  that,  under  the  guise  of
performing an objective inquiry about the defendant’s duty, he was in
reality performing an assumption of risk analysis. Admittedly, certain
of  the  factors  relied  on  by  the  judge — such  as  the  plaintiff’s  prior
experience and ostensible skill as a swimmer, and his awareness that
serious injury could result if he were to strike his head on the bottom
of  the  defendants’  swimming  pool  while  diving — bear  on  this
particular plaintiff’s subjective state of mind and actual knowledge of
the  danger  of  engaging  in  this  activity,  and  thus  should  have  been
excluded  from  an  objective  inquiry  concerning  whether  the  risk  of
injury was obvious to a hypothetical “person of average intelligence.”
However,  even  when  such  subjective  factors  are  excluded  from  the
analysis,  sufﬁcient  undisputed  evidence  remains  to  support  the
judge’s conclusion.

It  would  be  obvious  to  a  person  of  average  intelligence  that  a
swimming  pool  must  have  a  bottom.  We  have  no  doubt  that  an
ordinarily  intelligent  adult  in  our  society  would  be  aware  that  the
bottom of a swimming pool is a hard surface, liable to cause injury if
one were to strike it with one’s head. Moreover, the design and layout
of the defendants’ pool would have indicated to a person of average
intelligence  that  the  end  into  which  the  plaintiff  dived  was  not
intended for this activity: the diving board was afﬁxed to the opposite
end of the pool, making it apparent that the pool’s deepest water was
located at that end and that diving was intended to take place there.
Finally, the plaintiff attempted his dive late in the evening, when there
was  little  if  any  natural  light,  and  the  defendants’  pool  had  no
underwater lighting, such that its bottom was not visible to someone
standing  outside  the  water.  The  water  into  which  the  plaintiff  dived,
then, was of uncertain depth. A person of average intelligence would
clearly  have  recognized  that  diving  head  ﬁrst  into  shallow  water  in
these  circumstances  posed  a  risk  of  suffering  injury  by  striking  the
bottom of the pool.

We  conclude  that,  because  the  danger  of  diving  into  the  shallow
end of a swimming pool is open and obvious to a person of average
intelligence,  the  defendants  had  no  duty  to  warn  the  plaintiff  of  this
danger  as  a  matter  of  law  and,  therefore,  they  could  not  be  found
liable for his injuries. The defendants’ motion for summary judgment
was correctly allowed.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Contributory  Negligence  vs.  Open  and  Obvious  Exception.   The
open  and  obvious  doctrine  utilized  by  the  court  takes  an  instance
where  the  danger  is  so  greatly  foreseeable,  that  no  duty  is  deemed
necessary.  In  many  instances  where  the  open  and  obvious  danger
doctrine  applies  it  would  also  be  possible  to  assert  contributory

negligence against the plaintiff. Another possible defense, covered in
Chapter 7, is secondary implied assumption of risk — that the plaintiff
was  aware  of  the  danger  and  voluntarily  encountered  it  anyway.  As
the  court  indicated,  many  courts  have  abolished  the  secondary
implied  assumption  of  the  risk  afﬁrmative  defense  and  contributory
negligence  is  no  longer  fatal  to  the  plaintiff’s  claim  in  many  states.
Beyond  these  pragmatic  differences,  why  else  would  the  doctrine
applied  by  the  court  be  better  for  a  defendant  than  asserting  some
other afﬁrmative defense?

2.  Objective  vs.  Subjective  Inquiry.   The  analysis  of  whether  a
danger is open and obvious is objective: Would the reasonable person
under the circumstances have noticed the danger? In defense of the
trial  court’s  analysis,  the  appellate  court  suggests  that  it  was
improper to consider any specialized knowledge or experience of the
plaintiff. But if the plaintiff were considered the actor in question, why
wouldn’t  it  be  appropriate  to  consider  any  elevated  knowledge,  gifts,
or  experience  in  utilizing  the  objective  inquiry?  Recall  Cervelli  v.
Graves  in  Chapter  4  (actor’s  elevated  knowledge  and  driving  skills
should  be  considered  in  applying  the  reasonable  person,  objective
test).

3. The  Natural  Accumulation  Rule.   Some  states  are  not  willing  to
recognize the open and obvious danger rule because it can apply to
both natural and manmade hazards. In such states they instead only
apply  a  related  doctrine — the  natural accumulation  rule.  Under  this
rule,  when  natural  hazards  (rain,  snow,  wind,  etc.)  are  obvious  to  a
reasonable  person,  the  defendant  has  no  duty  to  eliminate  the
condition or warn the plaintiff about it. It works exactly like the open
and  obvious  danger  rule  but  is  only  applicable  to  weather-related
phenomena. See e.g., Klopp v. The Wackenhut Corp., 824 P.2d 292 (N.
Mex. 1992).

3. Duty to Protect Invitees from Criminal Attack

a. Actual Awareness of Danger

We  saw  at  the  beginning  of  this  chapter,  in  Lundy,  that  when  an
invitee  is  in  peril  on  the  land  of  the  defendant,  that  the  defendant’s
relationship  with  the  invitee  requires  it  to  come  to  their  aid.  In  other
words,  actual  knowledge  of  peril  demands  some  reasonable  action.
Courts have reafﬁrmed this principle when the invitee is attacked by
someone  on  the  defendant’s  land  and  the  defendant  witnesses  the
attack.  What  is  the  source  and  what  are  the  limits  of  a  landowner’s
duty  in  such  scenarios?  The  Taco  Bell  case  below  shows  a  classic
application of this principle.

GOULD v. TACO BELL
722 P.2d 511 (Kan. 1986)

    , J.

This  is  an  appeal  from  a  jury  verdict  in  a  civil  case  ﬁnding
appellant,  Taco  Bell,  51%  at  fault  for  injuries  received  by  appellee,
Rosie Gould. Gould was injured in a Taco Bell restaurant as a result of
an assault by another patron. The altercation occurred as follows.

On  the  evening  of  July  13,  1983,  Rosie  Gould  and  her  friend,
Theresa  Holmberg,  attended  a  Kansas  City  Royals  baseball  game.
They  left  the  ballgame  about  9:30  or  10:00  p.m.  and  on  the  way

home, stopped at a local bar. After about half an hour, they left the bar
and drove to a Taco Bell restaurant located in Shawnee, Kansas. They
arrived at the restaurant at approximately 11:30 p.m. There were six
people  in  the  restaurant  seated  in  a  booth.  After  ordering  their  food,
Gould  and  Holmberg  sat  down  in  a  booth  across  from  the  group.
Karen Brown was one of the individuals in that group.

Brown  and  her  companions  began  engaging  in  loud,  crude  and
vulgar  conversation,  designed  to  be  overheard  and  to  shock  Gould
and  Holmberg.  Neither  Gould  nor  Holmberg  made  any  comment  to
Brown  or  her  companions  during  this  conversation.  At  one  point,  a
Taco Bell employee told the group to quiet down, but the conversation
grew louder.

Eventually, the group got up to leave but prior to reaching the exit,
Brown  stopped  and  said,  “Those  two  white  bitches  over  there  think
they’re  hot  shit.”  Gould  was  shocked  and  asked,  “Are  you  talking  to
us?”  When  Brown  responded,  “Yes,”  Gould  requested  her  to  “please
come  over  here  and  repeat  yourself.”  Brown  responded  by  suddenly
dashing to Gould’s booth and striking her in the face with a clenched
ﬁst,  knocking  her  sideways  and  bruising  her  face  and  nose.  Gould,
shocked, called Brown a “nigger.” Brown then began hitting Gould with
her ﬁsts with renewed effort. This beating continued for about thirty
seconds  until  Holmberg  intervened  by  moving  between  Gould  and
Brown.  She  told  Brown,  “We  don’t  want  any  trouble.”  Gould  and
Holmberg  began  moving  toward  the  door  but  Brown  kept  saying
“Come  on,  hit  me,  bitch.  Come  on,  I  want  to  ﬁght.”  Gould  and
Holmberg continued to insist they did not want to ﬁght, but when they
reached  the  door  of  the  restaurant  Brown  began  beating  on  Gould
again. She struck Gould four or ﬁve times before they moved outside
the restaurant.

During  this  second  exchange,  Mark  Wills,  the  assistant  manager
at  the  restaurant,  watched  the  altercation  as  he  came  out  from
behind the counter. Wills did not try to stop Brown because he did not
want  to  get  involved  and  for  fear  Brown  would  strike  him  for

interfering. Nor did he call the police, since he didn’t feel the situation
warranted such action. However, Wills did tell Brown, “Why don’t you
just leave? You did this two weeks before in here.”

Gould and Holmberg, attempting to escape further trouble, began
moving  toward  their  car  in  the  parking  lot.  Mark  Wills  and  another
Taco  Bell  employee  followed  the  group  outside.  While  in  the  parking
lot,  Brown  attacked  Holmberg,  shoving  her  against  the  brick  wall  of
the  restaurant  and  hitting  and  kicking  her.  Holmberg  screamed  for
someone to call the police. The Taco Bell employees did not respond.
Holmberg  was  ﬁnally  able  to  break  away  and  ran  inside  to  the  food
counter  and  asked  Wills  (who  had  followed  her  back  inside)  if  she
could  use  the  phone  to  call  the  police.  Wills  advised  her  the  phone
was not for public use. Holmberg threatened to jump over the counter
and use the phone. Wills ﬁnally reluctantly called the police.

While Holmberg was inside, Brown again attacked Gould, striking
her three or four times on the upper part of her body. When Holmberg
returned to the parking lot, she informed Brown the police were on the
way. This scared Brown and her companions and they got in their car
and left.

Gould ﬁled the present action against Taco Bell, alleging Taco Bell
failed  to  provide  security  measures  sufﬁcient  to  protect  Gould,  a
business invitee, from injuries inflicted by fellow invitees. She further
alleged  that  Taco  Bell,  through  its  employees,  could  have  prevented
the conduct of Karen Brown, thereby preventing the injuries suffered
by  Gould.  The  jury  found  Gould  49%  at  fault  and  Taco  Bell  51%  at
fault.  They  awarded  Gould  $500  in  actual  damages  and  $10,000  in
punitive damages. Taco Bell appeals the jury’s ﬁndings.

Taco Bell ﬁrst argues a premises owner cannot be held liable for
injuries sustained in a sudden attack upon one patron by another. The
duty of care owed by a premises owner to an entrant upon the land is
dependent  upon  the  status  of  the  person  entering  the  premises.  A
restaurant patron is an “invitee.” We deﬁned that term and discussed

the  duty  of  care  owed  to  an  invitee  in  Gerchberg v. Loney,  576  P.2d
593  (1978):  “The  possessor  of  premises  on  which  an  invitee  enters
owes a higher degree of care, that of reasonable or ordinary care for
the invitee’s safety. This duty is active and positive. It includes a duty
to  protect  and  warn  an  invitee  against  any  danger  that  may  be
reasonably  anticipated.”  Thus,  Taco  Bell  owed  Rosie  Gould  an
afﬁrmative duty to exercise reasonable or ordinary care for her safety.
This duty included an obligation to warn her against any danger that
might reasonably have been anticipated.

In  Kimple  v.  Foster,  205  Kan.  415,  469  P.2d  281  (1970),  we
discussed the liability of a business owner for an intentional, harmful
assault upon a patron by another patron and set forth the general rule
as follows: “A proprietor of an inn, tavern, restaurant or like business
is  liable  for  an  assault  upon  a  guest  or  patron  by  another  guest  or
third  party  where  the  proprietor  has  reason  to  anticipate  such  an
assault  and  fails  to  exercise  reasonable  care  to  forestall  or  prevent
the same.” This rule is consistent with that set forth in Restatement
(Second) of Torts § 344 (1963):

A possessor of land who holds it open to the public for entry
for  his  business  purposes  is  subject  to  liability  to  members  of
the  public  while  they  are  upon  the  land  for  such  a  purpose,  for
physical  harm  caused  by
the  accidental,  negligent,  or
intentionally harmful acts of third persons or animals, and by the
failure of the possessor to exercise reasonable care to

(a) discover that such acts are being done or are likely to

be done, or

(b)  give  a  warning  adequate  to  enable  the  visitors  to

avoid the harm, or otherwise to protect them against it.

Taco  Bell  claims  the  assault  on  Rosie  Gould  lasted  only  about  ﬁve
minutes  [and  that  this  was  insufﬁcient  to  support  a  jury  verdict
against  it  for  negligence  in  failing  to  intervene].  It  is  true  that  in  the

present case Karen Brown and her friends had been at Taco Bell only
a  few  minutes.  But  in  this  case,  there  is  evidence  Brown  had  been
involved in a similar altercation at Taco Bell approximately two weeks
before she attacked Rosie Gould. Also, there was evidence Taco Bell
management had considered hiring security personnel because of a
history of rowdyism on the premises. In Kimple,  we  stated  that  it  “is
not required that notice to the proprietor of such an establishment be
long and continued in order that he be subject to liability; it is enough
that there be a sequence of conduct sufﬁcient to enable him to act on
behalf of his patron’s safety.” The evidence in this case was sufﬁcient
to  establish  such  a  “sequence  of  conduct.”  Thus,  we  hold  the  jury’s
verdict  against  Taco  Bell  for  Gould’s  injuries  is  supported  by  the
evidence.

Our  holding  is  consistent  with  decisions  in  cases  from  other
jurisdictions.  For  example,  in  Eastep  v.  Jack-in-the-Box,  Inc.,  546
S.W.2d  116  (Tex.  Civ.  App.  1977),  a  case  with  closely  analogous
circumstances, the defendant was held liable for injuries sustained by
Mrs.  Eastep  while  she  and  her  husband  were  patrons  in  the
defendant’s  restaurant.  The  Easteps  had  just  placed  their  order  and
sat down when they were cursed loudly by a group at another table.
After  this  group  taunted  plaintiffs  for  a  few  minutes,  a  ﬁght  ensued
which  resulted  in  Mrs.  Eastep  sustaining  a  severe  laceration  to  her
right  arm.  The  ﬁght  ended  approximately  ﬁve  to  ten  minutes  after  it
began and the police arrived at the scene a few minutes after being
called. The Texas court found evidence to support the jury’s ﬁndings
that the restaurant, through its employees, was negligent in failing to
demand  that  the  assailants  leave  the  premises,  in  failing  to  timely
notify  the  police,  and  in  failing  to  warn  the  Easteps  of  the  acts  and
condition of the assailants before the ﬁght began.

Similarly, in Grasso v. Blue Bell Waffle Shop, Incorporated, 164 A.
2d 475 (D.C. 1960), the plaintiff was injured in defendant’s restaurant
when  he  was  grabbed  and  struck  by  an  intoxicated,  belligerent
customer.  The  trial  court  granted  a  directed  verdict  in  favor  of  the

restaurant  but  the  appellate  court  reversed,  ﬁnding  there  was  a  jury
question whether those in charge of the restaurant should reasonably
have  anticipated  that  the  assailant  might  injure  a  customer  and
whether they took reasonable means to prevent such injury.

As in Eastep and Grasso, there was sufﬁcient evidence to submit
this  case  to  the  jury  and  sufﬁcient  evidence  to  support  the  jury’s
ﬁnding of liability on the part of Taco Bell.

The evidence at trial indicated that the shift manager, Mark Wills,
saw Karen Brown strike the plaintiff while the plaintiff was still sitting
in  the  booth,  but  he  did  nothing.  As  the  parties  moved  toward  the
door, Wills came out from behind the food counter to an area within a
few  feet  of  the  assailant  and  the  plaintiff.  He  again  failed  to  call  the
police or attempt to intervene, but instead observed a second attack
upon Gould. It was not until Gould’s friend, Theresa Holmberg, broke
away from Karen Brown and ran inside and threatened to jump over
the  counter  in  order  to  phone  the  police  that  Wills  ﬁnally  called  the
police.

Evidence  was  also  presented  that  Mark  Wills  believed  Karen
Brown had been the cause of a disturbance in the restaurant a couple
of  weeks  before  the  present  incident  occurred,  yet  he  failed  to
intervene or call the police when she began attacking Gould.

In  addition,  Mark  Walters,  the  store  manager,  testiﬁed  that  since
he  became  manager  of  the  restaurant  in  August  1981  the  late  night
patrons  had  been  “destructive”  and  “uncontrollable.”  He  stated  that
the late night business in Taco Bell originated in the neighboring bars
and  that  the  customers  were  rowdy  and  used  loud,  vulgar,  and
obscene  language,  and  engaged  in  verbal  ﬁghts  and  occasional
physical  ﬁghts.  He  also  testiﬁed  there  was  not  sufﬁcient  help  to
handle such crowds and that Taco Bell’s written policy was to call the
police in case of disruptive customer behavior.

These  facts  indicate  that  Taco  Bell  was  aware  of  the  danger  yet

failed to intervene or warn plaintiff of such danger.

The judgment of the trial court is afﬁrmed.

b. Foreseeable Risk of Danger

As we saw in Taco Bell, when the owner of the premises sees an
invitee  under  attack,  courts  have  not  had  much  difﬁculty  declaring
that the owner has an afﬁrmative duty to exercise reasonable care in
coming  to  their  rescue.  The  tougher  issue  is  when  should  the
landowner have to anticipate a possible future criminal attack on its
invitees  and  exercise  reasonable  care  in  arranging  for  security?  The
following  case  wrestles  with  this  issue  and  discusses  a  variety  of
differing approaches taken by various states.

DELTA TAU DELTA v. JOHNSON
712 N.E.2d 968 (Ind. 1999)

     , J.

The present case asks us to determine whether the trial court, in a
negligence  action,  properly  denied  a  motion  for  summary  judgment
on  the  issue  of  duty.  After  being  sexually  assaulted  in  a  fraternity
house  where  she  had  attended  a  party,  Tracey  Johnson  (“Johnson”)
brought  a  civil  claim  against  the  perpetrator,  Joseph  Motz  (“Motz”);
Delta  Tau  Delta,  Beta  Alpha  Chapter  (“DTD”),  the  fraternity  at  which
the party and sexual assault occurred; and Delta Tau Delta, National
Fraternity  (“National”).  Johnson  claims  that  DTD  breached  a  duty  of
care  owed  to  her.  DTD  ﬁled  motions  for  summary  judgment  on  the
grounds  that  [it  did  not  owe]  Johnson  a  duty  of  care  .  .  .  [and  the]
motions  were  denied.  On  interlocutory  appeal,  the  Court  of  Appeals
reversed [this denial] of summary judgment on all issues. We . . . now
address  whether  DTD  owed  Johnson  a  common  law  duty  of
reasonable care. [We reverse and remand on this issue.]

DTD  is  a  fraternity  on  the  campus  of  Indiana  University  at
Bloomington;  it  is  the  local  chapter  of  Delta  Tau  Delta,  National
Fraternity.  On  the  evening  of  October  13,  1990,  Johnson,  an
undergraduate  student  at  Indiana  University,  attended  a  party  at
DTD’s house. Johnson had been invited to the party by a member of
DTD.  She  arrived  at  the  party  around  10:00  p.m.  with  some  friends
who  had  also  been  invited.  At  the  party,  beer  was  served  in  a
downstairs  courtyard  area  of  the  house.  Pledges  drew  beer  from  a
keg  into  pitchers,  which  they  then  poured  into  cups  to  serve  to
guests. The courtyard was very crowded and rather chaotic. Around
midnight,  Johnson  and  her  friends  were  about  to  leave  when  she
encountered Motz, an alumnus of the fraternity and an acquaintance
of hers.

Motz  had  driven  into  Bloomington  that  day.  After  going  to  a
football game, Motz bought a case of beer which he brought back to
the chapter house. He stored his beer in room C17. Prior to meeting
Johnson, Motz drank four or ﬁve of his beers.

While  Johnson  and  Motz  were  talking,  Johnson’s  friends
wandered off and she was unable to ﬁnd them. Motz offered to drive
her  home,  but  only  after  he  had  sobered  up.  Johnson  accepted  the
offer.  They  waited  together  in  room  C17  where  they  both  had  some
drinks of hard liquor, talked, and listened to music with other guests.

Between  3:30  a.m.  and  4:00  a.m.,  Johnson  again  searched  for  a
ride home. When she was unsuccessful, Motz reafﬁrmed his offer to
drive  her  home,  but  only  after  he  sobered  up.  Soon  thereafter,  Motz
locked himself and Johnson in the room. He then sexually assaulted
Johnson.

The . . . issue in this appeal is whether the trial court was correct
judgment  on  Johnson’s
to  deny  DTD’s  motion  for  summary
negligence  claim.  In  this  case,  Johnson  argues  that  DTD  owed  its
guests  a  duty  of  reasonable  care,  for  example,  by  providing
reasonable protection, security, and supervision at the party, that DTD

breached  its  duty,  and  that  the  breach  proximately  caused  her
injuries.  DTD  moved  for  summary  judgment  on  the  issue  of  duty,
it  owed  no  duty  to  protect  Johnson  from  the
arguing  that
unforeseeable criminal acts of a third party. Determining whether one
party  owes  a  duty  to  another  is  a  question  of  law  for  the  court.  As
such,  we  will  determine,  de  novo,  whether  DTD  owed  a  duty  to
Johnson  and,  thus,  whether  the  trial  court  correctly  denied  DTD’s
motion for summary judgment.

invited  by  a

[A  member  of  DTD  invited  Johnson  to  the  party  and  the  assault
occurred  in  DTD’s  house.]  In  Burrell  v.  Meads,  this  Court  held  that  a
landowner  onto  the
social  guest  who  has  been
landowner’s  land  is  to  be  treated  as  an  invitee.  569  N.E.2d  637,  643
(Ind. 1991). Thus, a social host owes his guests the duty to exercise
reasonable care for their protection. The issue in this case is whether
a  landowner  may  have  a  duty  to  take  reasonable  care  to  protect  an
invitee  from  the  criminal  acts  of  a  third  party.  This  issue  is  one  that
we have not addressed recently and one which has resulted in some
disagreement in the Court of Appeals.

The question of whether and to what extent landowners owe any
duty  to  protect  their  invitees  from  the  criminal  acts  of  third  parties
has  been  the  subject  of  substantial  debate  among  the  courts  and
legal  scholars  in  the  past  decade.  The  majority  of  courts  that  have
addressed this issue agree that, while landowners are not to be made
the  insurers  of  their  invitees’  safety,  landowners  do  have  a  duty  to
take reasonable precautions to protect their invitees from foreseeable
criminal attacks. Indiana courts have not held otherwise.

A further question arises, however, in that courts employ different
approaches  to  determine  whether  a  criminal  act  was  foreseeable
such that a landowner owed a duty to take reasonable care to protect
an invitee from the criminal act. There are four basic approaches that
courts use to determine foreseeability in this context: (1) the speciﬁc
harm test, (2) the prior similar incidents test, and (3) the totality of the
circumstances test.

Under  the  speciﬁc  harm  test,  a  landowner  owes  no  duty  unless
the  owner  knew  or  should  have  known  that  the  speciﬁc  harm  was
occurring  or  was  about  to  occur.  Most  courts  are  unwilling  to  hold
that  a  criminal  act  is  foreseeable  only  in  these  situations.  See
McClung  v.  Delta  Square,  937  S.W.2d  891,  899  (Tenn.  1996)
(abrogating  Cornpropst  v.  Sloan,  528  S.W.2d  188,  198  (Tenn.  1975)
which had employed this test).

Under the prior similar incidents (PSI) test, a landowner may owe
a  duty  of  reasonable  care  if  evidence  of  prior  similar  incidents  of
crime  on  or  near  the  landowner’s  property  shows  that  the  crime  in
question was foreseeable. Although courts differ in the application of
this  rule,  all  agree  that  the  important  factors  to  consider  are  the
number  of  prior  incidents,  their  proximity  in  time  and  location  to  the
present crime, and the similarity of the crimes. Courts differ in terms
of  how  proximate  and  similar  the  prior  crimes  are  required  to  be  as
compared  to  the  current  crime.  Compare  Baptist  Mem’l  Hosp.  v.
Gosa,  686  So.  2d  1147  (Ala.  1996)  (employing  a  strict  PSI  test;
holding that, although there were 57 crimes reported over a ﬁve year
period,  only  six  involved  a  physical  touching  and,  therefore,  the
assault  of  someone  with  a  gun  was  unforeseeable)  with  Sturbridge
Partners,  Ltd.  v.  Walker,  482  S.E.2d  339  (Ga.  1997)  (employing  a
liberal  PSI  test;  holding  that  two  prior  burglaries  of  apartments  was
sufﬁcient  to  make  a  rape  in  an  apartment  foreseeable).  While  this
approach  establishes  a  relatively  clear  line  when  landowner  liability
will  attach,  many  courts  have  rejected  this  test  for  public  policy
reasons. The public policy considerations are that under the PSI test
the  ﬁrst  victim  in  all  instances  is  not  entitled  to  recover,  landowners
have no incentive to implement even nominal security measures, the
test incorrectly focuses on the speciﬁc crime and not the general risk
of foreseeable harm, and the lack of prior similar incidents relieves a
defendant of liability when the criminal act was, in fact, foreseeable.

Under the totality of the circumstances test, a court considers all
of  the  circumstances  surrounding  an  event,  including  the  nature,

condition, and location of the land, as well as prior similar incidents,
to determine whether a criminal act was foreseeable. See e.g., Isaacs
v.  Huntington  Memorial  Hospital,  695  P.2d  653  (Cal.  1985).  Courts
that  employ  this  test  usually  do  so  out  of  dissatisfaction  with  the
limitations  of  the  prior  similar  incidents  test.  The  most  frequently
cited limitation of this test is that it tends to make the foreseeability
question  too  broad  and  unpredictable,  effectively  requiring  that
landowners anticipate crime.

We  agree  with  those  courts  that  decline  to  employ  the  speciﬁc
harm  test  and  prior  similar  incidents  test.  We  ﬁnd  that  the  speciﬁc
harm test is too limited in its determination of when a criminal act is
foreseeable. While the prior similar incidents test has certain appeal,
we ﬁnd that this test has the potential to unfairly relieve landowners
of  liability  in  some  circumstances  when  the  criminal  act  was
reasonably foreseeable.

On the other hand, the totality of the circumstances test permits
courts to consider all of the circumstances to determine duty. In our
view  and  the  view  of  other  state  supreme  courts,  the  totality  of  the
circumstances  test  does  not  impose  on  landowners  the  duty  to
ensure an invitee’s safety, but requires landowners to take reasonable
precautions  to  prevent  foreseeable  criminal  acts  against  invitees.  A
substantial factor in the determination of duty is the number, nature,
and  location  of  prior  similar  incidents,  but  the  lack  of  prior  similar
incidents  will  not  preclude  a  claim  where  the  landowner  knew  or
should  have  known  that  the  criminal  act  was  foreseeable.  The
advantage  of  the  totality  of  the  circumstances  approach  is  that  it
incorporates  the  speciﬁc  harm  and  prior  similar  incidents  tests  as
factors to consider when determining whether the landowner owed a
duty to an injured invitee without artiﬁcially and arbitrarily limiting the
inquiry.  Therefore,  we  now  explicitly  state  that  Indiana  courts
confronted with the issue of whether a landowner owes a duty to take
reasonable care to protect an invitee from the criminal acts of a third

party should apply the totality of the circumstances test to determine
whether the crime in question was foreseeable.

Applying the totality of the circumstances test to the facts of this
case,  we  hold  that  DTD  owed  Johnson  a  duty  of  reasonable  care.
Within two years of this case, two speciﬁc incidents occurred which
warrant consideration. First, in March 1988, a student was assaulted
by  a  fraternity  member  during  an  alcohol  party  at  DTD.  Second,  in
April 1989 at DTD, a blindfolded female was made, against her will, to
drink  alcohol  until  she  was  sick  and  was  pulled  up  out  of  the  chair
and spanked when she refused to drink. In addition, the month before
this sexual assault occurred, DTD was provided with information from
National  concerning  rape  and  sexual  assault  on  college  campuses.
Amongst other information, DTD was made aware that “1 in 4 college
women have either been raped or suffered attempted rape,” that “75%
of  male  students  and  55%  of  female  students  involved  in  date  rape
had  been  drinking  or  using  drugs,”  that  “the  group  most  likely  to
commit gang rape on the college campus was the fraternity,” and that
fraternities  at  seven  universities  had  “recently  experienced  legal
action taken against them for rape and/or sexual assault.” We believe
that  to  hold  that  a  sexual  assault
in  this  situation  was  not
foreseeable, as a matter of law, would ignore the facts and allow DTD
to flaunt the warning signs at the risk of all of its guests.

As  a  landowner  under  these  facts,  DTD  owed  Johnson  a  duty  to
take reasonable care to protect her from a foreseeable sexual assault.
It is now for the jury to decide whether DTD breached this duty, and, if
so,  whether  the  breach  proximately  caused  Johnson’s  injury.  While
this may be the exceptional case wherein a landowner in a social host
situation is held to have a duty to take reasonable care to protect an
invitee from the criminal acts of another, when the landowner is in a
position  to  take  reasonable  precautions  to  protect  his  guest  from  a
foreseeable  criminal  act,  courts  should  not  hesitate  to  hold  that  a
duty exists.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Social  Guest  as  Invitee.   You  will  observe  that  Indiana  recently
made  the  decision  to  treat  social  guests  as  invitees  rather  than
licensees.  While  social  guests  have  not  traditionally  been  afforded
this  status,  some  states  have  been  uncomfortable  with  giving  the
social  guest  less  protection  than  the  random  member  of  the  public
who  is  considered  an  invitee  on  the  premises  of  a  business.  Some
states have simply merged licensees and invitees and afforded them
both  a  duty  of  reasonable  care.  The  Freeland  case  in  the  next  unit
discusses such reform.

2. Differing Tests for Foreseeable Harm from Crime.  All courts will
demand  a  duty  of  reasonable  care  when  the  premises  owner
witnesses  an  invitee  being  attacked;  that  is,  when  there  is  actual
knowledge of the peril. What speciﬁcally is required of the landowner
depends on the jury’s view of the circumstances. But simply to stand
by  and  attempt  nothing  almost  certainly  will  constitute  a  breach.  If
you think of the duty to invitees for dangerous conditions, you might
consider  this  circumstance  one  where  the  owner  has  actual
knowledge of the danger. The foregoing case deals with how to tag a
landowner  with  constructive  knowledge  of  the  dangerous  condition
(i.e., the relatively high potential for crime). The two most widely used
tests — the  prior  similar  instances  test  and  the  totality  of  the
just  how
circumstances  test — are  different  ways  to  ascertain
foreseeable  the  potential  for  crime  is  on  the  land.  Where  it  is
is  greater
foreseeable  enough — for  example,  where
foreseeability  of  crime  than  in  other  surrounding  areas — courts  say
that  this  triggers  a  duty  to  take  some  reasonable  actions  to  provide
protection to the invitee or to deter such crime. In the foregoing case,
what steps might DTD have undertaken in light of the foreseeability of
date rape to protect its guests during alcohol parties?

there

3. Other Examples of This Duty.  The foregoing case is somewhat
unusual.  More  typical  examples,  where  the  issue  of  the  duty  to

protect  from  or  prevent  criminal  attack  on  invitees  arises,  involve
armed robberies, ﬁghting, or theft in shopping malls, in parking lots of
retail  stores,  or  in  taverns.  As  between  the  various  tests,  which  one
would  appear  to  be  best  for  the  landowner?  Why?  Considering  the
facts  from  Delta  Tau  Delta,  under  which  tests  would  you  conclude
that a duty of care should exist?

E. Modern Rejection of Three Categories

Now  that  you  have  rigorously  studied  the  traditional  classiﬁcation
system and learned the distinctions between invitees, licensees, and
trespassers, you will see below that approximately half of the states
have  rejected  this  system — either  in  whole  or  part.  The  following
case  shows  one  such  state’s  determination  that  the  old  system,
dependent  upon  classifying  the  plaintiff  to  determine  her  rights,  is
flawed.  Consider  carefully  the  reason  for  the  original  system  and
whether  the  approach  adopted  by  many  states  is  actually  better  or
worse in operation.

NELSON v. FREELAND
507 S.E.2d 882 (N.C. 1998)

    , J.

The  sole  issue  arising  out  of  the  case  sub  judice  is  whether
defendant  Dean  Freeland’s  (“Freeland”)  act  of  leaving  a  stick  on  his
porch constituted negligence. Indeed, this case presents us with the
simplest of factual scenarios–Freeland requested  that  plaintiff  John
Harvey  Nelson  (“Nelson”)  pick  him  up  at  his  house  for  a  business
meeting the two were attending, and Nelson, while doing so, tripped
over  a  stick  that  Freeland  had  inadvertently  left  lying  on  his  porch.
Nelson  brought  this  action  against  Freeland  and  his  wife  seeking

damages  for  the  injuries  he  sustained  in  the  fall.  The  trial  court
granted  summary  judgment  for  the  defendants,  and  the  Court  of
Appeals afﬁrmed.

Although  the  most  basic  principles  of  tort  law  should  provide  an
easy answer to this case, our current premises liability trichotomy —
that is, the invitee, licensee, and trespasser classiﬁcations — provides
no clear solution and has created dissension and confusion amongst
the  attorneys  and  judges  involved.  Thus,  once  again,  this  Court
confronts  the  problem  of  clarifying  our  enigmatic  premises-liability
scheme–a problem that we have addressed over fourteen times.

[W]e  have  repeatedly  waded  through  the  mire  of  North  Carolina
premises-liability law. Nonetheless, despite our numerous attempts to
clarify this liability scheme and transform it into a system capable of
guiding  North  Carolina  landowners  toward  appropriate  conduct,  this
case  and
its  similarly  situated  predecessors  convincingly
demonstrate  that  our  current  premises-liability  scheme  has  failed  to
establish  a  stable  and  predictable  system  of  laws.  Signiﬁcantly,
despite  over  one  hundred  years  of  utilizing  the  common-law
trichotomy, we still are unable to determine unquestionably whether a
man  who  trips  over  a  stick  at  a  friend/business  partner’s  house  is
entitled to a jury trial — a question ostensibly answerable by the most
basic tenet and duty under tort law: the reasonable-person standard
of care.

Given  that  our  current  premises-liability  scheme  has  confounded
our  judiciary,  we  can  only  assume  that  it  has  inadequately  apprised
landowners  of  their  respective  duties  of  care.  Thus,  it  befalls  us  to
examine  the  continuing  utility  of  the  common-law  trichotomy  as  a
means  of  determining  landowner  liability  in  North  Carolina.  In
analyzing  this  question,  we  will  consider  the  effectiveness  of  our
current  scheme  of  premises-liability  law,  the  nationwide  trend  of
abandoning  the  common-law  trichotomy  in  favor  of  a  reasonable-
care standard, and the policy reasons for and against abandoning the
trichotomy in this state.

Under  current  North  Carolina

law,  the  standard  of  care  a
landowner owes to persons entering upon his land depends upon the
entrant’s  status,  that  is,  whether  the  entrant  is  a  licensee,  invitee,  or
trespasser.  An  invitee  is  one  who  goes  onto  another’s  premises  in
response  to  an  express  or  implied  invitation  and  does  so  for  the
mutual beneﬁt of both the owner and himself. The classic example of
an invitee is a store customer. See, e.g., Rives v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea
Co., 68 N.C. App. 594, 315 S.E.2d 724 (1984). A licensee, on the other
hand,  “is  one  who  enters  onto  another’s  premises  with  the
possessor’s  permission,  express  or  implied,  solely  for  his  own
purposes rather than the possessor’s beneﬁt.” Mazzacco, 303 N.C. at
497,  279  S.E.2d  at  586-87.  The  classic  example  of  a  licensee  is  a
social guest. See, e.g., Crane v. Caldwell, 113 N.C. App. 362, 366, 438
S.E.2d  449,  452  (1994).  Lastly,  a  trespasser  is  one  who  enters
another’s  premises  without  permission  or  other  right.  See  Newton,
342 N.C. at 559, 467 S.E.2d at 63.

In  a

traditional  common-law  premises-liability  action,

the
threshold issue of determining the plaintiff’s status at the time of the
injury is of substantial import. The gravity of this determination stems
from  the  fact  that  there  is  a  descending  degree  of  duty  owed  by  a
landowner based upon the plaintiff’s status.

Although the common-law trichotomy has been entrenched in this
country’s tort-liability jurisprudence since our nation’s inception, over
the past ﬁfty years, many states have questioned, modiﬁed, and even
abolished it after analyzing its utility in modern times. At ﬁrst, states
believed  that  although  the  policies  underlying  the  trichotomy —
speciﬁcally  those  involving  the  supremacy  of  land  ownership  rights
— were  no  longer  viable,  they  nonetheless  could  ﬁnd  means  to
salvage it. In particular, states attempted to salvage the trichotomy by
engrafting  into  it  certain  exceptions  and  subclassiﬁcations  which
would  allow  it  to  better  congeal  with  our  present-day  policy  of
balancing  land-ownership  rights  with  the  right  of  entrants  to  receive
adequate  protection  from  harm.  Accordingly,  North  Carolina,  along

with  the  rest  of  the  country,  witnessed  the  burgeoning  of  novel
jurisprudence
involving  entrant-protection  theories  such  as  the
active-negligence  .  .  .  doctrine.  Unfortunately,  these  exceptions  and
subclassiﬁcations  ultimately  forced  courts  to  maneuver  their  way
through  a  dizzying  array  of  factual  nuances  and  delineations.  See
Kermarec,  358  U.S.  at  631,  3  L.  Ed.  2d  at  555  (stating  “the
classiﬁcation  and  subclassiﬁcation  bred  by  the  common  law  have
produced confusion and conflict”).

Additionally,  courts  were  often  confronted  with  situations  where
none  of  the  exceptions  or  sub-classiﬁcations  applied,  yet  if  they
utilized the basic trichotomy, unjust and unfair results would emerge.
Therefore, these courts were forced to deﬁne terms such as “invitee”
in  a  broad  or  strained  manner  to  avoid  leaving  an  injured  plaintiff
deserving of compensation without redress. Although these broad or
strained  deﬁnitions  may  have  led  to  just  and  fair  results,  they  often
involved rationales teetering on the edge of absurdity.

[An]  example  of  a  broad  or  strained  reading  can  be  found  in  this
Court’s  holding  in  Walker  v.  Randolph  County,  112  S.E.2d  551  (N.C.
1960).  In  Walker,  we  held  that  a  seventy-seven-year-old  woman  who
went to the county courthouse to look at a notice of sale of realty was
an  invitee  when  she  fell  down  the  courthouse  stairway.  This  case
involved  a  strained  reading  of  the  term  “invitee”  given  that  we  have
always deﬁned that term to include only those individuals who enter
another’s  premises  for  the  mutual  beneﬁt  of  the  landowner  and
himself. That is, we were willing to implicitly conclude that the county
somehow  beneﬁtted  from  posting  notices  it  was  statutorily  required
to  post  in  order  to  classify  the  plaintiff  as  an  invitee  and  hence
provide compensation. Thus,Walker demonstrate[s] how courts have
made strained readings of the trichotomy classiﬁcations to reach just
and fair results.

The  ﬁrst  signiﬁcant  move  toward  abolishing  the  common-law
trichotomy  occurred  in  1957  when  England — the  jurisdiction  giving
rise  to  the  trichotomy — passed  the  Occupier’s  Liability  Act  which

abolished  the  distinction  between  invitees,  licensees  and  so-called
contractual  visitors.  Shortly  thereafter,  the  United  States  Supreme
Court  decided  not  to  apply  the  trichotomy  to  admiralty  law  after
concluding  that  it  would  be  inappropriate  to  hold  that  a  visitor  is
entitled to a different or lower standard of care simply because he is
classiﬁed as a “licensee.” See Kermarec, 358 U.S. at 630. In so ruling,
the Court noted that “the distinctions which the common law draws
between  licensee  and  invitee  were  inherited  from  a  culture  deeply
rooted to the land, a culture which traced many of its standards to a
heritage  of  feudalism.”  Id.  Ultimately,  the  Court  concluded  that  the
numerous  exceptions  and  sub-classiﬁcations  engrafted  into  the
trichotomy  have  obscured  the  law,  thereby  causing  it  to  move
unevenly  and  with  hesitation  toward  “‘imposing  on  owners  and
occupiers a single duty of reasonable care in all the circumstances.’”
Id. at 631.

in  California

Nine  years  later,  the  Supreme  Court  of  California  decided  the
seminal case of Rowland v. Christian, 443 P.2d 561 which abolished
in  favor  of  modern
the  common-law  trichotomy
negligence principles. Speciﬁcally, the court in Rowland held that the
proper question to be asked in premises-liability actions is whether “in
the  management  of  his  property  [the  landowner]  has  acted  as  a
reasonable  man  in  view  of  the  probability  of  injury  to  others.”
Moreover,  the  court  followed  both  England’s  and  the  United  States
Supreme  Court’s  lead  by  noting  that  “whatever  may  have  been  the
historical  justiﬁcations  for  the  common  law  distinctions,  it  is  clear
that  those  distinctions  are  not  justiﬁed  in  the  light  of  our  modern
society.”  The  court  continued  by  stating  that  the  trichotomy  was
“contrary
to  our  modern  social  mores  and  humanitarian
values  .  .  .  [and  it]  obscures  rather  than  illuminates  the  proper
considerations which should govern determination of the question of
duty.” Id. at 568.

The  Rowland  decision  ultimately  served  as  a  catalyst  for  similar
judicial decisions across the country. Indeed, since Rowland, twenty-

licensee,

ﬁve jurisdictions have either modiﬁed or abolished their common-law
trichotomy  scheme — seven  within  the  last  ﬁve  years.  Speciﬁcally,
eleven  jurisdictions  have  completely  eliminated  the  common-law
distinctions  between
invitee,  and  trespasser.  Further,
fourteen jurisdictions have repudiated the licensee-invitee distinction
while maintaining the limited-duty rule for trespassers. In summation,
nearly  half  of  all
judicially
abandoned  or  modiﬁed  the  common-law  trichotomy  in  favor  of  the
modern “reasonable-person” approach that is the norm in all areas of
tort law.

in  this  country  have

jurisdictions

To  assess  the  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  abolishing  the
common-law trichotomy, we ﬁrst consider the purposes and policies
behind  its  creation  and  current  use.  The  common-law  trichotomy
traces  its  roots  to  nineteenth-century  England.  Indeed,  it  emanated
from  an  English  culture  deeply  rooted  to  the  land;  tied  with  feudal
heritage;  and  wrought  with  lords  whose  land  ownership  represented
power,  wealth,  and  dominance.  Even  though  nineteenth-century
courts  were  aware  of  the  threat  that  unlimited  landowner  freedom
and  its  accompanying  immunity  placed  upon  the  community,  they
nevertheless  refused  to  provide  juries  with  unbounded  authority  to
determine premises-liability cases. Rather, these courts restricted the
jury’s  power  because  juries  were  comprised  mainly  of  potential  land
entrants who most likely would act to protect the community at large
and  thereby  reign  in  the  landowner’s  sovereign  power  over  his  land.
Thus, the trichotomy was created to disgorge the jury of some of its
power  by  either  allowing  the  judge  to  take  the  case  from  the  jury
based on legal rulings or by forcing the jury to apply the mechanical
rules  of  the  trichotomy  instead  of  considering  the  pertinent  issue  of
whether the landowner acted reasonably in maintaining his land.

Although the modern trend of premises-liability law in this country
has  been  toward  abolishing  the  trichotomy  in  favor  of  a  reasonable-
person  standard,  there  are  some  jurisdictions  that  have  refused  to
it.  One  of  the  primary  reasons  that  some
modify  or  abolish

jurisdictions  have  retained  the  trichotomy  is  fear  of  jury  abuse — a
fear similar to the reason it was created in the ﬁrst place. Speciﬁcally,
jurisdictions retaining the trichotomy fear that plaintiff-oriented juries
— like  feudal  juries  composed  mostly  of  land  entrants — will  impose
unreasonable  burdens  upon  defendant-landowners.  This  argument,
however,  fails  to  take  into  account  that  juries  have  properly  applied
negligence principles in all other areas of tort law, and there has been
no  indication  that  defendants  in  other  areas  have  had  unreasonable
burdens  placed  upon  them.  Moreover,  given  that  modern  jurors  are
more  likely  than  feudal  jurors  to  be  landowners  themselves,  it  is
unlikely that they would be willing to place a burden upon a defendant
that they would be unwilling to accept upon themselves.

Lastly,  opponents  of  abolishing  the  trichotomy  argue  that
retention  of  the  scheme  is  necessary  to  ensure  predictability  in  the
law. For example, prior to abolishing its common-law trichotomy, the
Kansas  Supreme  Court  declined  an  invitation  to  do  so  because  it
believed  that  the  replacement  of  its  stable  and  established  system
would result in one that is devoid of standards for liability. See Britt v.
Allen County Community Jr. College, 638 P.2d 914 (Kan. 1982).

The  complexity  and  confusion  associated  with  the  trichotomy  is
twofold. First, the trichotomy itself often leads to irrational results not
only  because  the  entrant’s  status  can  change  on  a  whim,  but  also
because the nuances which alter an entrant’s status are undeﬁnable.
Consider,  for  example,  the  following  scenario:  A  real-estate  agent
trespasses  onto  another’s  land  to  determine  the  value  of  property
adjoining  that  which  he  is  trying  to  sell;  the  real-estate  agent  is
discovered by the landowner, and the two men engage in a business
conversation  with  respect  to  the  landowner’s  willingness  to  sell  his
property;  after  completing  the  business  conversation,  the  two  men
realize  that  they  went  to  the  same  college  and  have  a  nostalgic
conversation  about  school  while  the  landowner  walks  with  the  man
for one acre until they get to the edge of the property; lastly, the two
men stand on the property’s edge and speak for another ten minutes

about  school.  If  the  real-estate  agent  was  injured  while  they  were
walking  off  the  property,  what  is  his  classiﬁcation?  Surely,  he  is  no
longer a trespasser, but did his status change from invitee to licensee
once the business conversation ended? What if he was hurt while the
two men were talking at the property’s edge? Does it matter how long
they were talking?

The Supreme Court of Wisconsin made a similar argument when
it asked whether there is any reason why one who invites a guest to a
party should have less concern for that individual’s well-being than he
has for the safety of an insurance salesman delivering a policy to his
home. The court then inquired whether the life or welfare of the guest
should  be  regarded  in  a  more  sacred  manner.  Moreover,  it  queried
whether  we  realistically  can  say  that  reasonable  people  vary  their
conduct based upon the status of the entrant.

The  preceding

illustrations  demonstrate

the  complexity
associated with the trichotomy. Moreover, they demonstrate that the
trichotomy  often  forces  the  trier  of  fact  to  focus  upon  irrelevant
factual  gradations  instead  of  the  pertinent  question  of  whether  the
landowner acted reasonably toward the injured entrant. For instance,
in  the  real-estate  agent  hypothetical  posed  above,  the  trier  of  fact
would  be  focused  on  determining  the  agent’s  purpose  for  being  on
the  land  at  the  time  of  injury  instead  of  addressing  the  pertinent
question  of  whether  the  landowner  acted  as  a  reasonable  person
would under the circumstances.

Lastly,  we  note  that  the
trichotomy  has  been  criticized
because  its  underlying  landowner-immunity  principles  force  many
courts  to  reach  unfair  and  unjust  results  disjunctive  to  the  modern
fault-based  tenets  of  tort  law.  For  example,  the  Kansas  Supreme
Court noted that “modern times demand a recognition that requiring
all  to  exercise  reasonable  care  for  the  safety  of  others  is  the  more
humane  approach.”  Jones,  867  P.2d  at  307  (Kan.).  Likewise,  the
California  Supreme  Court  noted  that  using  the  trichotomy  to

determine  whether  a  landowner  owed  the  injured  plaintiff  a  duty  of
care  “is  contrary  to  our  modern  social  mores  and  humanitarian
values.” Rowland,  443  P.2d  at  567.  Indeed,  modern  thought  dictates
that “[a] man’s life or limb does not become less worthy of protection
by the law nor a loss less worthy of compensation . . . because he has
land  of  another  without  permission  or  with
come  upon  the
permission but without a business purpose.” Id.

Signiﬁcantly, the fact that judges and justices cannot agree as to
whether  a  landowner’s  conduct  is  actionable — as  evidenced  by
dissents in prior cases — evidences that the trichotomy fails to clearly
articulate  a  landowner’s  standard  of  care.  This  confusion  is  most
disturbing  when  considered  in  light  of  the  comparatively  simplistic
approach set forth in the modern tort principle of negligence and its
accompanying standard of reasonable care under the circumstances.
In  sum,  there  are  numerous  advantages  associated  with
abolishing the trichotomy. First, it is based upon principles which no
longer  apply  to  today’s  modern
industrial  society.  Further,  the
preceding  cases  demonstrate  that  the  trichotomy  has  failed  to
elucidate  the  duty  a  landowner  owes  to  entrants  upon  his  property.
Rather,  it  has  caused  confusion  amongst  our  citizens  and  the
judiciary — a confusion exaggerated by the numerous exceptions and
sub-classiﬁcations  engrafted  into  it.  Lastly,  the  trichotomy  is  unjust
and unfair because it usurps the jury’s function either by allowing the
judge  to  dismiss  or  decide  the  case  or  by  forcing  the  jury  to  apply
mechanical  rules  instead  of  focusing  upon  the  pertinent  issue  of
whether  the  landowner  acted  reasonably  under  the  circumstances.
Thus,  we  conclude  that  North  Carolina  should  join  the  twenty-four
other jurisdictions which have modiﬁed or abolished the trichotomy in
favor of modern negligence principles.

Given  the  numerous  advantages  associated  with  abolishing  the
trichotomy,  this  Court  concludes  that  we  should  eliminate  the
distinction between licensees and invitees by requiring a standard of
reasonable  care  toward  all  lawful  visitors.  Adoption  of  a  true

the  complex,  confusing,  and
negligence  standard  eliminates
unpredictable state of premises-liability law and replaces it with a rule
which focuses the jury’s attention upon the pertinent issue of whether
the  landowner  acted  as  a  reasonable  person  would  under  the
circumstances.

In  so  holding,  we  note  that  we  do  not  hold  that  owners  and
occupiers of land are now insurers of their premises. Moreover, we do
not intend for owners and occupiers of land to undergo unwarranted
burdens in maintaining their premises. Rather, we impose upon them
only the duty to exercise reasonable care in the maintenance of their
premises for the protection of lawful visitors.

Further, we emphasize that we will retain a separate classiﬁcation
for  trespassers.  We  believe  that  the  status  of  trespasser  still
maintains  viability  in  modern  society,  and  more  importantly,  we
believe that abandoning the status of trespasser may place an unfair
burden  on  a  landowner  who  has  no  reason  to  expect  a  trespasser’s
presence. Indeed, whereas both invitees and licensees enter another’s
land  under  color  of  right,  a  trespasser  has  no  basis  for  claiming
protection beyond refraining from willful injury.

Given  that  we  are  convinced  that  the  common-law  trichotomy  is
no longer viable, we should put it to rest. By so doing, we align North
Carolina  premises-liability  law  with  all  other  aspects  of  tort  law  by
basing  liability  upon  the  pillar  of  modern  tort  theory:  negligence.
Moreover,  we  now  join  twenty-four  other  jurisdictions  which  have
carefully  examined  and  analyzed  this  issue,  ultimately  determining
that the trichotomy is no longer applicable in the modern world.

Accordingly, plaintiff Nelson is entitled to a trial at which the jury
shall  be  instructed  under  the  new  rule  adopted  by  this  opinion.
Speciﬁcally,  the  jury  must  determine  whether  defendant  Freeland
fulﬁlled  his  duty  of  reasonable  care  under  the  circumstances.  This
case  is  therefore  remanded  to  the  Court  of  Appeals  for  further

remand  to  the  Superior  Court,  Guilford  County,  for  proceedings
consistent with this opinion.

1.  Frustration  with  Trichotomy.   Some  of  the  criticisms  of  the
leads  to
trichotomy  are  that
unpredictable  results.  With  regard  to  the  facts  in Freeland,  the  court
says  the  uncertain  classiﬁcation  of  the  plaintiff  made  it  unclear
whether the defendant might be liable to the plaintiff. With regard to
the dangerous condition (i.e. the left-behind stick on the steps) do you
understand  why  the  defendant’s  lack  of  actual  knowledge  might  be
critically  important  if  the  court  found  the  plaintiff  to  be  a  mere
licensee? If so, would the defendant have any potential liability? What
does  the  trichotomy  advise  about  whether  the  landowner  must
inspect the property for the beneﬁt of a licensee? Is this unpredictable
and uncertain? By contrast, under the holding of the court in Freeland,
what  will  be  the  outcome?  Does  the  uniﬁed  system  adopted  by  the
court answer the question whether a duty to inspect applied?

2. Judges  vs.  Juries.   In  the  system  ﬁrst  adopted  by  California —
which treats all injured victims the same — who ultimately determines
what the landowner should have done under the circumstances? How
is this different from the traditional system? Are jury outcomes more
predictable? Which system allows for entry of summary judgment at
times? Which system is more efﬁcient? Which system do you prefer?
3.  Yania  Revisited.   This  chapter  began  with  the  Yania  case  in
which the defendant landowner asked the plaintiff to come upon his
land to assist him. After doing so, the plaintiff fell into the water-ﬁlled
cut  and  drowned  when  the  defendant  failed  to  come  to  his  aid.  The
court there held there was no afﬁrmative duty to act. Could you now
make the argument that the defendant landowner did owe some duty

to  afﬁrmatively  act  with  reasonable  care  to  provide  some  rescue
effort? Was that case wrongly decided based upon the special status
of the plaintiff and the defendant?

Upon Further Review

Currently,  the  largest  divide  among  the  various  jurisdictions  in
premises  liability  cases  is  whether  to  accept  the  traditional
trichotomy (where duty depends upon classifying the plaintiff as
trespasser, licensee, or invitee), to break down the categories into
only  two  (trespassers  and  those  legally  entitled  to  enter  the
land),  or  to  simply  charge  the  jury  in  all  premises  liability  cases
with a “reasonable care” instruction and let the jury decide on a
case-by-case  basis  what  this  should  mean.  About  half  of  the
states still swear allegiance to the traditional classiﬁcations. The
circumstances  of  the  plaintiff’s  entry  will  still  potentially  impact
expectations  for  the  landowner  in  every  case;  the  difference  is
whether  to  have  the  judge  declare  differing  duties  based  upon
the classiﬁcations, or to let the jury intuitively take this factor into
account  as  merely  one  of  the  “circumstances”  for  applying  the
reasonable  care  standard.  Under  the  traditional  system,  legal
analysis  essentially  involves  two  steps:  (1)  classifying  the
plaintiff;  and  (2)  analyzing  the  facts  with  the  applicable  duty  to
see if a breach of duty has occurred.

VII  DUTY BASED UPON DEFENDANT’S STATUS:

PROFESSIONALS

Our  ﬁnal  set  of  special  duty  rules  deals  with  the  situation  where  the
alleged  tortfeasors  are  professionals  practicing  their  craft.  In  this
regard,  we  have  seen  in  Chapter  4  two  relevant  sets  of  rules  with
respect  to  understanding  the  objective,  reasonable  person  standard.
In  Cervelli,  the  court  stated  that  an  actor’s  superior  gifts,  talents,
knowledge, and skills are taken into consideration in judging whether
negligence  has  occurred.  This  concept  hints  at  the  possibility  that
professionals  might  be  viewed  somewhat  differently  than  others  in
applying negligence standards given their relatively elevated levels of
knowledge,  experience,  and  skills.  On  the  other  hand,  in  The  T.J.
Hooper  case  Judge  Hand  indicated  that  industry  customs  are  not
controlling on the issue of whether an actor’s conduct has conformed
to  the  reasonable  person  standard.  Yet  does  it  make  sense  to  allow
lay  juries  to  sit  in  judgment  over  doctors’  and  lawyers’  complex
judgment decisions regarding their practices when those professions
may  have  established  their  own  expectations?  A  primary  issue  this
section begins with, therefore, is how these concepts apply when the
alleged  negligence  arises  in  someone’s  professional  practice.  Is  a
professional’s duty of care higher than someone else’s and, if so, how
do  the  industry  custom  rules  apply  to  a  professional  industry?  The
following two cases show the majority view — one in a medical injury
case (Osborn) and the other (Hodges) in a legal malpractice context.

OSBORN v. IRWIN MEMORIAL BLOOD BANK
5 Cal. App. 4th 234 (Cal. App. 1992)

      , J.

The  trial  in  this  case  has  been  reported  as  the  ﬁrst  in  the  nation
where a blood bank was found liable in connection with transmission
of the acquired immune deﬁciency syndrome (AIDS) virus by a blood
transfusion.

In  February  of  1983,  at  the  age  of  three  weeks,  Michael  Osborn
contracted  the  AIDS  virus  from  a  blood  transfusion  in  the  course  of
surgery  on  his  heart  at  the  University  of  California  at  San  Francisco
Medical Center. The blood used in the operation was supplied by the
Irwin  Memorial  Blood  Bank.  Michael  and  his  parents,  Paul  and  Mary
Osborn,  sued  Irwin  and  the  University  for  damages  on  various
theories. . . . [The jury returned a 9-3 decision against Irwin, awarding
damages of $550,000 to Michael and $200,000 to his parents.] After
the  jury  returned  a  general  verdict  for  plaintiffs,  the  court  granted
the  verdict  on
Irwin’s  motion

. . .
The most signiﬁcant issue on appeal is whether Irwin was entitled
to  judgment  notwithstanding  the  verdict  on  the  issue  of  negligence.
Qualiﬁed  experts  opined  for  plaintiffs  that  Irwin’s  blood  testing  and
donor  screening  practices  prior  to  Michael’s  surgery  were  negligent
[for failure to perform certain tests on the blood] in light of concerns
about  AIDS  at  the  time.  On  matters  such  as  these  that  are  outside
common knowledge, expert opinion is ordinarily sufﬁcient to create a
prima  facie  case.  Here,  however,  there  was  uncontradicted  evidence
that Irwin was doing as much if not more in the areas of testing and
screening  than  any  other  blood  bank  in  the  country,  and  there  is  no
question that it followed accepted practices within the profession. We
hold that Irwin cannot be found negligent in these circumstances.

Most of the evidence at trial concerned the actions Irwin took, or
allegedly  should  have  taken,  to  safeguard  its  blood  supply  in  early
1983 in light of concerns at the time that AIDS might be transmissible
by  blood.  The  issue  on  appeal  is  whether,  in  light  of  that  evidence,
Irwin  was  entitled  to  judgment  notwithstanding  the  verdict  on
plaintiffs’ claim of negligence.

Plaintiffs’ principal theory of negligence is that Irwin should have
started  anti-HBc  surrogate  testing  for  AIDS  prior  to  Michael’s
operation

The  form  of  their  experts’  testimony  suggests  that  plaintiffs
assumed  their  case  against  Irwin  was  one  of  ordinary  negligence.
Plaintiffs’  experts  did  not  couch  their  opinions  in  terms  of  the
standard of care for blood banks in early 1983. They simply said what
Irwin  “should”  have  done,  or  what  a  “reasonable  person”  would  have
done,  in  light  of  what  was  known  about  AIDS  at  the  time.  We
ultimately  conclude  that  this  distinction  is  one  of  substance  as  well
as form, but the threshold question is whether Irwin should be held to
a professional standard of care.

We  note  that  this  appears  to  be  a  point  of  ﬁrst  impression  in
California. The precedents indicating that blood banks are not subject
to strict liability for providing contaminated blood (see  Health &  Saf.
Code,  §1606  [distribution  of  blood  is  a  service  rather  than  a  sale])
have observed that blood banks may be sued for negligence but have
not  undertaken  to  deﬁne  the  standard  of  care.  (See  McDonald  v.
Sacramento  Medical  Foundation  Blood  Bank,  62  Cal.  App.  3d  866
1976);  Klaus  v.  Alameda-Contra  Costa  Medical  Assn.  Blood  Bank,
Inc., 62 Cal. App. 3d 417, 419 (1976). We have determined that Irwin
is a “health care provider” within the meaning of MICRA and there is
no question that donor screening and blood testing are “professional
services” for purposes of MICRA (deﬁning “professional negligence” in
pertinent part as “a negligent act or omission to act by a health care
provider in the rendering of professional services”).

We  conclude  that  the  adequacy  of  a  blood  bank’s  actions  to
prevent  the  contamination  of  blood  is  a  question  of  professional
negligence  and  fulﬁllment  of  a  professional  standard  of  care.  As
another court has observed, the “activities of [the blood bank] at issue
here — the collection, processing, and testing of blood for transfusion
— no  doubt  require  the  exercise  of  professional  expertise  and
professional  judgment.” Doe  v. American Red  Cross Blood Services,
S.C. Region, 125 F.R.D. 637, 642 (D.S.C. 1989).

This  conclusion  is  consistent  with  most  of  the  cases  in  other
jurisdictions  that  have  considered  negligence  claims  against  blood
banks.  This  conclusion  is  also  consistent  with  California  cases  that
have  applied  a  professional  standard  to  activities  involving  special
training and skill.

Plaintiffs  contend  that  custom  and  practice  are  relevant,  but  not
conclusive, on the standard of care. This is the general rule in cases
of  ordinary  negligence.  See  Kinney  &  Wilder,  Medical  Standard
Setting  in  the  Current  Malpractice  Environment:  Problems  and
Possibilities  (1989)  22  U.C.  Davis  L.  Rev.  421,  439-40;  Keeton,
Medical Negligence — The Standard of Care 10 Tex. Tech L. Rev. 351,
354 (1979). The leading case for this rule is The T.J. Hooper (2d Cir.
1932)  60  F.2d  737,  740,  where  Learned  Hand  wrote  that  “in  most
cases reasonable prudence is in fact common prudence; but strictly it
is  never  its  measure;  a  whole  calling  may  have  unduly  lagged  in  the
adoption of new and available devices. It never may set its own tests,
however persuasive be its usages. Courts must in the end say what is
required; there are precautions so imperative that even their universal
disregard  will  not  excuse  their  omission.”  There  is  no  question  that
California follows this rule in ordinary negligence cases.

This  is  a  case  of  professional  negligence,  however,  and  we  must
assess the role of custom and practice in that context. The question
presented here is whether California law permits an expert to second-
guess an entire profession. We have found no deﬁnitive precedent on
this issue and it is not one that is likely to arise.

Custom  and  practice  are  not  controlling  in  cases,  unlike  ours,
where a layperson can infer negligence by a professional without any
expert testimony. In Leonard v. Watsonville Community Hosp. (1956)
305  P.2d  36,  for  example,  where  a  clamp  was  left  in  the  plaintiff’s
body  after  surgery,  the  lack  of  an  “‘established  practice’”  of  counting
clamps did not preclude a ﬁnding of negligence: “Defendants seek to
avoid  liability  on  the  theory  that  they  were  required  to  exercise  only
that  degree  of  skill  employed  by  other  hospitals  and  nurses  in  the
community.  It  is  a  matter  of  common  knowledge,  however,  that  no
special skill is required in counting instruments. Although under such
circumstances proof of practice or custom is some evidence of what
should  be  done  and  may  assist  in  the  determination  of  what
constitutes due care, it does not conclusively establish the standard
of care.” (Id., at 519 [italics added].)

On the other hand, in cases like ours where experts are needed to
show  negligence,  their  testimony  sets  the  standard  of  care  and  is
said  to  be  “conclusive.”  “Ordinarily,  where  a  professional  person  is
accused  of  negligence  in  failing  to  adhere  to  accepted  standards
within  his  profession  the  accepted  standards  must  be  established
only by qualiﬁed expert testimony [citations] unless the standard is a
matter  of  common  knowledge.  [Citation.]  However,  when  the  matter
in  issue  is  within  the  knowledge  of  experts  only  and  not  within
common  knowledge,  expert  evidence  is  conclusive  and  cannot  be
disregarded.”  Huber,  Hunt  &  Nichols,  Inc.  v.  Moore  (1977)  136  Cal.
Rptr.  603.  Qualiﬁed  expert  opinion  will  thus  generally  preclude  a
directed verdict in a professional negligence case.

This  case,  however,  is  distinguishable.  .  .  .  Here  it  is  undisputed
that  no  blood  bank  in  the  country  was  doing  what  the  plaintiffs’
experts’  standard  of  care  would  require  of  Irwin,  and  we  have  an
unusual  situation  where  we  are  called  upon  to  address  the
signiﬁcance of a universal practice.

While  it  may  be  true  that  “an  increasing  number  of  courts  are
rejecting  the  customary  practice  standard  in  favor  of  a  reasonable

care  or  reasonably  prudent  doctor  standard”  (Prosser  &  Keeton,  The
Law  of  Torts  (5th  ed.,  1988  pocket  supp.)  p.  30,  fn.  53  [citing  cases
outside California]), numerous commentaries have noted that custom
generally  sets  the  standard  of  care.  See,  e.g.,  King,  In  Search  of  a
Standard  of  Care  for  the  Medical  Profession:  The  “Accepted
Practice” Formula (1975) 28 Vand. L. Rev. 1213, 1235, 1245-1246.

Most  commentators  have  urged  that  a  customary  or  accepted
practice standard is preferable to one that allows for the disregard of
professional  judgment.  Indeed,  the  more  recent  commentaries  are
not  concerned  with  whether  customary  practices  should  be  the
maximum expected of medical practitioners, but rather with whether
those practices should continue to set a minimum standard in a time
of increasing economic constraints.

The  basic  reason  why  professionals  are  usually  held  only  to  a
standard  of  custom  and  practice  is  that  their  informed  approach  to
matters outside common knowledge should not be “evaluated by the
ad hoc judgments of a lay judge or lay jurors aided by hindsight.” King,
supra, 28 Vand. L. Rev. at p. 1249. In the words of a leading authority,
“When  it  can  be  said  that  the  collective  wisdom  of  the  profession  is
that a particular course of action is the desirable course, then it would
seem  that  the  collective  wisdom  should  be  followed  by  the  courts.”
Keeton, supra, 10 Tex. Tech L. Rev. at pp. 364-365.

The  “most  famous  &  judicial  departure  from  the  usual  rule”  is
Helling  v.  Carey  (1974)  519  P.2d  981.  In  that  case,  the  Washington
Supreme  Court  held  ophthalmologists  negligent  as  a  matter  of  law
for failing to administer routine glaucoma tests to a patient under the
age  of  40,  despite  expert  testimony  from  both  sides  that  the
standards  of  the  profession  did  not  require  such  testing  of  patients
that age. The court reached this decision by balancing its perception
of the seriousness of the disease against the cost of the test.

Most  of  the  commentary  on  this  case  has  been  unfavorable.  A
contemporary  observer  wrote
the  Helling  court  had
“unwisely . . . arrogated to itself medical decisions, superimposing its

that

medical  judgment  upon  the  collective  experience  of  the  medical
profession. Can it really be said that medical judgments of the courts
will  be  ‘right’  more  often  than  those  guided  by  approved  medical
practices?” King, supra, 28 Vand. L. Rev. at p. 1250; see also, Keeton,
supra,  10  Tex.  Tech  L.  Rev.  at  pp.  367-68.  Such  concerns  may  have
been  borne  out  by  subsequent  medical  research:  “It  is  a  telling
commentary  on  the  judicial  performance  in  the  Helling  case  that
medical research taking all relevant factors into account provides no
convincing evidence for the cost-effectiveness of even the customary
practice  of  screening  all  patients  over  age  40  for  glaucoma.  The
Washington court, which held on the basis of its own intuition that it
was negligence not to screen the plaintiff because she was under 40,
is thus left with egg on its face.” Havighurst, Private Reform of Tort-
Law  Dogma:  Market  Opportunities  and  Legal  Obstacles  (1986)  49
Law & Contemp. Probs. 143, 159, fn. 45.

[Prevailing sentiments in other jurisdictions, and some prior cases
from  this  state  conﬁrm]  that  professional  prudence  is  deﬁned  by
actual  or  accepted  practice  within  a  profession,  rather  than  theories
about what “should” have been done.

It  follows  that  Irwin  cannot  be  found  negligent  for  failing  to
perform  tests  that  no  other  blood  bank  in  the  nation  was  using.
Judgment notwithstanding the verdict was properly granted to Irwin
on  the  issue  of  anti-HBc  testing  because  there  was  no  substantial
evidence that failure to conduct the tests was not accepted practice
for blood banks in January and February of 1983.

HODGES v. CARTER
80 S.E.2d 144 (N.C. 1954)

Civil  action  to  recover  compensation  for  losses  resulting  from  the
alleged  negligence  of  defendant  D.D.  Topping  and  H.C.  Carter,  now

deceased, in prosecuting, on behalf of plaintiff, certain actions on ﬁre
insurance policies.

On 4 June 1948 plaintiff’s drugstore building located in Belhaven,
N.C.,  together  with  his  lunch  counter,  ﬁxtures,  stock  of  drugs  and
sundries therein contained, was destroyed by ﬁre. At the time plaintiff
was  insured  under  four  policies  of  ﬁre  insurance  against  loss  of,  or
damage to, said mercantile building and its contents. He ﬁled proof of
loss  with  each  of  the  four  insurance  companies  which  issued  said
policies.  The  insurance  companies  severally  rejected  the  proofs  of
loss,  denied  liability,  and  declined  to  pay  any  part  of  the  plaintiff’s
losses resulting from said ﬁre.

H.C. Carter and D.D. Topping were at the time attorneys practicing
in Beaufort and adjoining counties. As they were the ones from whom
plaintiff  seeks  to  recover,  they  will  hereafter  be  referred  to  as  the
defendants.

On 3 May 1949 defendants, in behalf of plaintiff, instituted in the
Superior  Court  of  Beaufort  County  four  separate  actions — one
insurers.  Complaints  were  ﬁled  and
against  each  of  the  four
summonses  were  issued,  directed  to  the  sheriff  of  Beaufort  County.
In  each  case  the  summons  and  complaint,  together  with  copies
thereof, were mailed to the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of
North  Carolina.  The  Commissioner  accepted  service  of  summons
and  complaint  in  each  case  and  forwarded  a  copy  thereof  by
registered mail to the insurance company named defendant therein.

Thereafter each defendant made a special appearance and moved
to dismiss the action against it for want of proper service of process
for that the Insurance Commissioner was without authority, statutory
or  otherwise,  to  accept  service  of  process  issued  against  a  foreign
insurance  company  doing  business  in  this  State.  When  the  special
appearance  and  motion  to  dismiss  came  on  for  hearing  at  the
judge  presiding  concluded  that  the
February  Term  1950,  the
acceptance  of  service  of  process  by  the  Insurance  Commissioner

was valid and served to subject the movants to the jurisdiction of the
court.  Judgment  was  entered  in  each  case  denying  the  motion
therein  made.  Each  defendant  excepted  and  appealed.  This  Court
reversed. Hodges v. Insurance Co., 61 S.E.2d 372.

[In  the  North  Carolina  Supreme  Court’s  reversal,  the  Court  stated
that: “At the time defendant entered its motion to dismiss the original
action, the plaintiff still had more than sixty days in which to sue out
an alias summons and thus keep his action alive. He elected instead
to rest his case upon the validity of the service had. The unfortunate
result is unavoidable.” By the time of the Supreme Court’s reversal, the
applicable  statute  of  limitations  had  run  and  no  new  suit  could  be
brought.]

On 4 March 1952 plaintiff instituted this action in which he alleges
that the defendants were negligent in prosecuting his said actions in
that  they  failed  to  (1)  have  process  properly  served,  and  (2)  sue  out
alias  summonses  at  the  time  the  insurers  ﬁled  their  motions  to
dismiss the actions for want of proper service of summons, although
they  then  had  approximately  sixty  days  within  which  to  procure  the
issuance thereof.

Defendants, answering, deny negligence and plead good faith and

the exercise of their best judgment.

At  the  hearing  in  the  court  below  the  judge,  at  the  conclusion  of
plaintiff’s evidence in chief, entered judgment of involuntary nonsuit.
Plaintiff excepted and appealed.

        , J.

This seems to be a case of ﬁrst impression in this jurisdiction. At
least counsel have not directed our attention to any other decision of
this Court on the question here presented, and we have found none.

Ordinarily when an attorney engages in the practice of the law and
contracts  to  prosecute  an  action  in  behalf  of  his  client,  he  impliedly
represents that (1) he possesses the requisite degree of learning, skill,
and  ability  necessary  to  the  practice  of  his  profession  and  which

others  similarly  situated  ordinarily  possess;  (2)  he  will  exert  his  best
judgment in the prosecution of the litigation entrusted to him; and (3)
he will exercise reasonable and ordinary care and diligence in the use
of  his  skill  and  in  the  application  of  his  knowledge  to  his  client’s
cause.

An attorney who acts in good faith and in an honest belief that his
advice and acts are well founded and in the best interest of his client
is not answerable for a mere error of judgment or for a mistake in a
point of law which has not been settled by the court of last resort in
his State and on which reasonable doubt may be entertained by well-
informed lawyers.

Conversely, he is answerable in damages for any loss to his client
which  proximately  results  from  a  want  of  that  degree  of  knowledge
and  skill  ordinarily  possessed  by  others  of  his  profession  similarly
situated, or from the omission to use reasonable care and diligence,
or  from  the  failure  to  exercise  in  good  faith  his  best  judgment  in
attending to the litigation committed to his care.

When the facts appearing in this record are considered in the light
of  these  controlling  principles  of  law,  it  immediately  becomes
manifest  that  plaintiff  has  failed  to  produce  a  scintilla  of  evidence
tending to show that defendants breached any duty the law imposed
upon  them  when  they  accepted  employment  to  prosecute  plaintiff’s
actions against his insurers or that they did not possess the requisite
learning and skill required of an attorney or that they acted otherwise
than in the utmost good faith.

The Commissioner of Insurance is the statutory process agent of
foreign  insurance  companies  doing  business  in  this  State,  G.S.  58-
153,  and  when  defendants  mailed  the  process  to  the  Commissioner
of  Insurance  for  his  acceptance  of  service  thereof,  they  were
following a custom which had prevailed in this State for two decades
or  more.  Foreign  insurance  companies  had  theretofore  uniformly
in  response  thereto,  ﬁled  their
ratiﬁed  such  service,  appeared

answers,  and  made  their  defense.  The  right  of  the  Commissioner  to
accept  [mailed]  service  of  process  in  behalf  of  foreign  insurance
companies  doing  business  in  this  State  had  not  been  tested  in  the
courts.  Attorneys  generally,  throughout  the  State,  took  it  for  granted
that under the terms of G.S. 58-153 such acceptance of service was
adequate.  And,  in  addition,  the  defendants  had  obtained  the  judicial
declaration of a judge of our Superior Courts that the acceptance of
service  by  the  Commissioner  subjected  the  defendants  to  the
jurisdiction of the court. Why then stop in the midst of the stream and
pursue some other course?

Doubtless  this  litigation  was  inspired  by  a  comment  which
appears  in  our  opinion  on  the  second  appeal  [set  forth  above].
However, what was there said was pure dictum, injected — perhaps ill
advisedly — in  explanation  of  the  reason  we  could  afford  plaintiff  no
relief  on  that  appeal.  We  did  not  hold,  or  intend  to  intimate,  that
defendants had been in any wise neglectful of their duties as counsel
for plaintiff.

The judgment entered in the court below is afﬁrmed.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Professional  Negligence  Analysis.   According  to  the  Osborn
court,  professional  malpractice  claims  are  typically  analyzed  under
the  professional  standard,  which  affords  absolute  weight  to  any
professional  customs.  If  professionals  have  recognized  certain
customs for actions under certain circumstances, these become the
standard  of  care.  When  this  occurs,  the  jury  does  not  utilize  the
considerations  normally  associated  with  the  Learned  Hand  formula
to determine if a breach of duty has occurred. Instead, the jury merely
applies  the  applicable  custom  to  the  defendant  professional’s
conduct to see if they met this alternative standard of care. The only
exception is when the professional’s action does not involve matters

over which a layperson lacks understanding. For example, if a patient
in  a  hospital  slips  and  falls  on  a  wet  floor,  the  hospital’s  negligence
would  not  rely  upon  application  of  the  professional  standard.  If  a
surgeon  forgets  to  remove  a  piece  of  surgical  hardware  from  the
patient  (a  so-called  “sponge”  case),  the  jury  need  not  hear  expert
testimony about whether a custom exists to remove a scalpel. Or if a
lawyer forgets to ﬁle a lawsuit and the statute of limitations runs on
the  claim,  even  a  lay  juror  can  understand  easily  how  this  would
amount  to  negligence.  But
in  any  area  requiring  professional
expertise  and  judgment,  the  custom  within  the  profession  governs
the analysis.

2.  Rejection  of  The  T.J.  Hooper.   The  professional  standard  is  a
stark departure from what we discovered in Chapter 4 in the case of
The  T.J.  Hooper.  The  idea  from  that  case  of  industry  custom  being
relevant but not controlling seemed to make sense. But with respect
to professionals, most courts have held that it would be nonsensical
to allow jurors to second-guess the views of an entire profession. This
conclusion makes the issue of who is considered a professional very
important. In the next case we will consider this issue squarely. In the
context of that case, you will discover why courts are willing to trust
professionals to set their own standard of care when we don’t allow
tug  boat  owners  to  do  likewise.  Application  of  the  professional
standard  of  care,  despite  the  perhaps  good  reason  for  its  use,
sometimes means that plaintiffs that appear to have been harmed by
a professional have no remedy. For example, in Osborn, the trial was
conducted  on  the  basis  of  the  normal  breach  analysis  with  expert
evidence  offered  as  to  the  feasibility  of  performing  blood  tests  at  a
low  cost  (burden)  in  the  face  of  increasing  awareness  of  the
devastating  impact  of  tainted  blood  being  given  to  unsuspecting
patients (the foreseeable risk of harm). One can easily view the case
as  exemplifying  the  observation  from  The  T.J.  Hooper  of  an  entire
industry  lagging  behind  the  care  that  a  reasonable  person  would
adhere to in a given circumstance. The same observations might be

made  of  the  lawyers  effectuating  service  of  process  in  a  rather
informal  manner  in  Hodges  when  serving  process  the  lawful  way
would  impose  no  great  burden.  Critics  of  the  professional  standard
would  thus  use  both  of  these  cases  as  examples  of  why  the
reasonable  person  standard,  as  applied  in  The  T.J.  Hooper,  should
always  be  applied.  But,  the  majority  of  courts  continue  to  apply  the
professional standard to professional groups.

3. Expert Witnesses.  When the professional standard applies, the
jury  needs  information  about  the  applicable  professional  customs.
The  only  persons  with  personal  knowledge  of  these  customs  are
experts practicing within that profession. In this way, courts have held
that expert testimony is essential in such cases to inform the jury of
the  governing  standard.  Interestingly,  a  defendant  in  a  malpractice
case necessarily qualiﬁes as such an expert witness and is permitted
to offer testimony on their own behalf — presumably always testifying
that they met the standard (or else the case needs to settle). Plaintiffs
in  malpractice  cases  need  the  testimony  of  another  professional
setting  forth  an  applicable  custom  to  which  the  defendant  did  not
adhere in order to have a potential claim of malpractice for a jury to
even  consider.  Many  malpractice  cases  involve  defendants  ﬁling
motions  for  summary  judgment  attacking  the  adequacy  of  the
plaintiff’s evidence of deviation from a professional custom. Plaintiffs
can either hire a testifying expert witness from within the profession
or,  in  some  cases,  offer  the  opinions  from  another  professional  who
has dealt with the plaintiff. For example, in some medical malpractice
cases  a  subsequent  doctor  has  treated  the  plaintiff  to  remedy  a
complication  from  the  original  doctor’s  treatment.  So  long  as  that
other doctor is practicing in the same specialty area as the defendant,
if  the  subsequent  treating  doctor  has  critical  opinions  concerning
noncompliance  with  the  governing  customs,  this  can  form  a
sufﬁcient  basis  for  the  malpractice  claim.  A  cottage  industry  has
arisen for certain professionals to make themselves available for hire
as  expert  witnesses  (for  either  side)  in  malpractice  cases.  When

juries  hear  testimony  from  dueling  expert  witnesses  as  to  prevailing
customs,  the  jury  needs  to  determine  as  a  factual  matter  whom  to
believe.

4.  Competing  Schools  of  Thought.   In  a  given  situation,  a
profession  may  not  uniformly  act  in  one  particular  way.  When  a
certain  type  of  cancer  is  diagnosed  in  a  patient,  for  example,  the
specialists  involved  in  treating  the  cancer  may  have  differences  of
and/or
opinion
chemotherapy.  In  other  words,  there  may  be  multiple  schools  of
thought within a profession as to the proper course of treatment. In
such  cases,  so  long  as  the  defendant  doctor  has  adhered  to  one  of
the  recognized  schools  of  thought,  the  doctor  has  met  the  duty  of
care  and  is  not  liable  for  malpractice.  There  is  a  lot  of  potential  for
dispute  as  to  whether  a  practice  constitutes  a  recognized  school  of
thought  or  whether
it  merely  evidences  a  handful  of  doctors
committing malpractice. These matters are usually left for the jury to
decide  upon  hearing  the  testimony  from  the  competing  expert
witnesses.

2. Who Is a Professional?

Doctors  and  lawyers  have  always  been  considered  professionals  for
purposes  of  analyzing  their  potential  negligence.  For  this  reason,
negligence  claims  against  them  are  called  “malpractice”  cases.  Who
else  is  a  professional?  Does  the  professional  standard  apply  to

anyone  practicing  a  craft  that  seems  complicated?  How  about
pharmaceutical  companies  or  automobile  manufacturers?  If  we  are
too  liberal  in  allowing  different  industries  to  qualify  for  professional
status,  then  the  well-reasoned  opinion  in  The  T.J.  Hooper  becomes
meaningless.  Even  tug  boat  owners  will  simply  declare  themselves
professionals  and  lag  behind  the  expectations  for  reasonable  care
with  impunity.  The  Rossell  case  below  does  an  excellent  job
discussing  this  question  and  suggests  a  framework  for  analyzing
how the courts should deﬁne the word “professional.” As you read the
following  case,  consider  why  this  issue  is  so  important  to  the
outcome of the case and why the court rejects the professional label
for the defendant.

ROSSELL v. VOLKSWAGEN OF AMERICA
709 P.2d 517 (Ariz. 1985)

       , J.

This  is  a  product  liability  action  brought  by  Phyllis  A.  Rossell,  as
guardian  ad  litem  on  behalf  of  her  daughter,  Julie  Ann  Kennon
(plaintiff),  against  the  manufacturer  and  the  North  American
distributor  of  Volkswagen  automobiles.  The  defendants  will  be
referred to collectively as “Volkswagen.” The case involves the design
of  the  battery  system  in  the  model  of  the  Volkswagen  automobile
popularly  known  as  the  “Beetle”  or  “Bug.”  The  jury  found  for  the
plaintiff  and  awarded  damages  in  the  sum  of  $1,500,000.  The  court
of appeals held that the plaintiff had failed to establish a prima facie
case  of  negligence  .  .  .  and  that  the  trial  judge  had  erred  in  denying
Volkswagen’s motion for judgment n.o.v.

This  action  arises  from  a  1970,  one-vehicle  accident.  At  the  time
of  the  accident  Julie,  then  eleven  months  old,  was  sleeping  in  the
front passenger seat of a 1958 Volkswagen driven by her mother. At
approximately 11:00 p.m., on State Route 93, Ms. Rossell fell asleep

and the vehicle drifted to the right, off the paved roadway. The sound
of  the  car  hitting  a  sign  awakened  Rossell,  and  she  attempted  to
correct  the  path  of  the  car,  but  oversteered.  The  car  flipped  over,
skidded off the road and landed on its roof at the bottom of a cement
culvert. The force of the accident dislodged and fractured the battery
which  was  located  inside  the  passenger  compartment.  In  the  seven
hours  it  took  Rossell  to  regain  full  consciousness  and  then  extract
herself  and  her  daughter  from  the  car,  the  broken  battery  slowly
dripped  sulfuric  acid  on  Julie.  The  acid  severely  burned  her  face,
chest,  arm,  neck,  part  of  her  back  and  shoulder,  and  both  hands.
Since  the  accident  Julie  has  undergone  extensive  corrective  surgery
but remains seriously disﬁgured and in need of additional surgery.

Plaintiff ﬁled the complaint in May, 1978. She alleged . . . negligent
design of the battery system [among other claims]. [At trial,] the case
was  submitted  to  the  jury  only  on  the  question  of  Volkswagen’s
negligence in locating the battery inside the passenger compartment.
Plaintiff  argued  at  trial  that  battery  placement  within  the
passenger  compartment  created  an  unreasonable  risk  of  harm  and
that  alternative  designs  were  available  and  practicable.  In  their  trial
motions and later motion for judgment n.o.v., Volkswagen argued that
plaintiff had failed to make a prima facie case. First, it claimed that in
a  negligent  design  case  the  defendant  must  comply  with  the
standard of a reasonably prudent designer of automobiles and that

knowledge  of  automobile  design  principles  and  engineering  practices  often  is
beyond the knowledge of laymen, [so that] plaintiff in a case such as this must
produce  expert  testimony  establishing  the  minimum  standard  of  care  and
deviation therefrom in designing the automobile. . . .

The  trial  judge  characterized  Volkswagen’s  position  as  a  contention
that plaintiff could not prevail in the

absence  of  testimony  .  .  .  from  a  qualiﬁed  expert  as  opposed  to  simply
permitting the jury to infer it, . . . that the standard of care required of a prudent

manufacturer would require that the battery be placed elsewhere [or that] it was
negligent . . . not to have placed it outside of the passenger compartment.

The trial judge disagreed with Volkswagen and denied the motion for
judgment n.o.v. However, a majority of the court of appeals held that
such evidence was required for a prima facie case.

. . .
We  turn,  then,  to  the  central  issue  presented.  What  type  of  proof
must  plaintiff  produce  in  order  to  make  a  prima  facie  case  of
negligent  design  against  a  product  manufacturer?  What  is  the
standard  of  care?  In  the  ordinary  negligence  case,  tried  under  the
familiar rubric of “reasonable care,” plaintiff’s proof must provide facts
from  which  the  jury  may  conclude  that  defendant’s  behavior  fell
below the “reasonable man” standard. Prosser, supra §31 at 169. This
question  is  ordinarily  decided  without  providing  the  jury  with  any
direct evidence about the details of what may or may not comply with
the  standard  of  care.  The  risk/beneﬁt  analysis  involved  in  deciding
what  is  reasonable  care  under  the  circumstances  is  generally  left  to
the jury. . . .

Thus, in the usual negligence case the jury is left to reach its own
conclusion  on  whether  defendant’s  conduct  complied  with  the  legal
standard of reasonable care. There need be no opinion testimony on
the  subject;  the  jury  is  encouraged,  under  proper  instruction,  to
consider  the  circumstances,  use  its  own  experience  and  apply
community standards in deciding what is or is not negligence.

Volkswagen claims that negligent design cases are an exception.
They  contend  that  product  manufacturers  are  held  to  an  expert’s
standard  of  care,  as  are  professionals  such  as  lawyers,  doctors  and
accountants.  In  professional  malpractice  cases  the  reasonable  man
standard has been replaced with the standard of “what is customary
and  usual  in  the  profession.”  Prosser,  supra  §32,  at  189.  This,  of
course,  requires  plaintiff  to  establish  by  expert  testimony  the  usual

conduct of other practitioners of defendant’s profession and to prove,
further, that defendant deviated from that standard.

It has been pointed out often enough that this gives the medical profession, and
also the [other professions], the privilege, which is usually emphatically denied
to  other  groups,  of  setting  their  own  legal  standards  of  conduct,  merely  by
adopting their own practices.

Id. (emphasis supplied) (citations omitted).

Should  we  adopt  for  manufacturers  in  negligent  design  cases  a
rule “emphatically denied to other groups” but similar to those applied
to  defendants  in  professional  malpractice  cases?  Such  a  rule,  of
course,  would  require — not  just  permit — plaintiff  to  present  explicit
evidence of the usual conduct of other persons in the ﬁeld of design
by  offering  expert  evidence  of  what  constitutes  “good  design
practice.” Plaintiff would also be required to establish that the design
adopted  by  the  defendant  deviated  from  such  “good  practice.”  We
believe that such a rule is inappropriate.

The  malpractice  requirement  that  plaintiff  show  the  details  of
conduct  practiced  by  others  in  defendant’s  profession  is  not  some
special favor which the law gives to professionals who may be sued
by their clients. It is, instead, a method of holding such defendants to
an  even  higher  standard  of  care  than  that  of  an  ordinary,  prudent
person.  Prosser,  supra  §32  at  185.  Such  a  technique  has  not  been
applied  in  commercial  settings,  probably  because  the  danger  of
allowing  a  commercial  group  to  set  its  own  standard  of  what  is
reasonable  is  not  offset  by  professional  obligations  which  tend  to
prevent  the  group  from  setting  standards  at  a  low  level  in  order  to
accommodate  other  interests.  Thus,  it  is  the  general  law  that
industries  are  not  permitted  to  establish  their  own  standard  of
conduct because they may be influenced by motives of saving “time,
effort or money.” Prosser, supra §33 at 194. Long ago, Judge Learned
Hand  expressed  the  rule  in  a  case  in  which  the  defendant  claimed

that it had not been negligent in failing to put Mr. Marconi’s invention
on its tugboats:

Is  it  then  a  ﬁnal  answer  that  the  business  had  not  yet  generally  adopted
receiving  sets?  .  .  .  Indeed  in  most  cases  reasonable  prudence  is  in  fact
common prudence; but strictly it is never its measure; a whole calling may have
unduly lagged in the adoption of new and available devices. It never may set its
own tests, however persuasive be its usages. Courts must in the end say what
is  required;  there  are  precautions  so  imperative  that  even  their  universal
disregard will not excuse their omission.

The T.J. Hooper, 60 F.2d 737, 740 (2d Cir.1932). This, of course, is not
to say that evidence of custom and usage is inadmissible.

Volkswagen  argues  that  case  law  already  recognizes  that  in
negligent design cases a manufacturer is not liable absent a showing
that he failed to conform to the standard of care in design followed by
other manufacturers. We do not agree.

In view of public policy and existing law, we decline to transform
defective design cases into malpractice cases. We believe the law is
best left as it is in this ﬁeld. Special groups will be allowed to create
their  own  standards  of  reasonably  prudent  conduct  only  when  the
nature of the group and its special relationship with its clients assure
society  that  those  standards  will  be  set  with  primary  regard  to
protection  of  the  public  rather  than  to  such  considerations  as
that  automobile
increased  proﬁtability.  We  do  not  believe
manufacturers  ﬁt  into  this  category.  This  is  no  reflection  upon
automobile  manufacturers,  but  merely  a  recognition  that  the
necessities  of  the  marketplace  permit  manufacturers  neither  the
working  relationship  nor  the  concern  about  the  welfare  of  their
customers  that  the  professions  generally  permit  and  require  from
their practitioners.

Therefore, in Arizona the rule in negligence cases shall continue to
be  that  evidence  of  industry  custom  and  practice  is  generally
admissible as evidence relevant to whether defendant’s conduct was

In  determining  what

reasonable  care  for  manufacturers,  the  plaintiff  need  only  prove  the
defendant’s  conduct  presented  a  foreseeable,  unreasonable  risk  of
harm. As in all other negligence cases, the jury is permitted to decide
what is reasonable from the common experience of mankind. We do
not  disturb  the  rule  that  in  determining  what  is  “reasonable  care,”
expert  evidence  may  be  required  in  those  cases  in  which  factual
issues  are  outside  the  common  understanding  of  jurors.  However,
unlike  most  malpractice  cases,  there  need  not  be  explicit  expert
testimony establishing the standard of care and the manner in which
defendant deviated from that standard. With these principles in mind,
we now turn to a consideration of the evidence in order to determine
whether plaintiff did prove a prima facie case.

Plaintiff  presented  two  experts,  Jon  McKibben,  an  automotive
engineer,  and  Charles  Turnbow,  a  safety  engineer.  Their  testimony
established that the great majority of cars on the road at the time the
Beetle  in  question  was  designed  had  batteries  located  outside  the
passenger  compartment,  usually  in  the  engine  compartment  and
occasionally  in  the  luggage  compartment.  There  was  evidence  from
which the jury could ﬁnd that from both an engineering and practical
standpoint the 1958 Volkswagen could have been designed with the
battery  outside  the  passenger  compartment,  as  was  the  Karmann
Ghia, an upscale model which used the same chassis as the Beetle.
There was further testimony that placement of the battery inside the
passenger  compartment  was  unreasonably  dangerous  because
“batteries do fracture in crashes, not infrequently.”

We conclude that the plaintiff did present expert evidence that the
battery design location presented a foreseeable, unreasonable risk of
harm,  that  alternative  designs  were  available  and  that  they  were
feasible  from  a  technological  and  practical  standpoint.  We  reject
Volkswagen’s  contention  that  in  addition  to  the  evidence  outlined
above,  plaintiff  was  compelled  to  produce  expert  opinion  evidence
that  the  standard  of  “good  design  practice”  required  Volkswagen  to

design  the  car  so  that  the  battery  system  was  located  outside  the
passenger compartment. Unlike a malpractice case, the jury was free
to reach or reject this conclusion on the basis of its own experience
and knowledge of what is “reasonable,” with the assistance of expert
opinion  describing  only  the  dangers,  hazards  and  factors  of  design
involved.

The  opinion  of  the  court  of  appeals  is  vacated.  The  judgment  is

afﬁrmed.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Trust as the Distinction Between Industry and Professions.   The
court  in  Rossell  clariﬁes  that  the  professional  standard  is  not  a
courtesy  offered  to  certain  special  groups  as  a  favor  but  instead
reflects  the  fact  that  certain  groups  can  be  trusted  to  set  relatively
high  standards  for  themselves.  In  this  regard,  it  gives  two  primary
considerations for determining that a group deserves the status as a
profession: (1) the nature of the group, and (2) whether it has special
relationships with its clients. With respect to the nature of the group,
the  court  observes  that  professional  groups  have  self-imposed
“professional  obligations”  and  also  tend  to  be  somewhat  insulated
from  “motives  of  saving  time,  effort,  or  money”  in  setting  customs.
The  court  then  determines  that  automobile  manufacturers  lack  the
same  relationships  with  their  customers  that  doctors  and  lawyers
have with their patients and clients, and that such manufacturers are
driven  by  proﬁt  (presumably  from  their  shareholders)  without
offsetting  professional  obligations
rules  of  professional
responsibility  for  lawyers  and  the  Hippocratic  oath  for  doctors).
Ultimately, what the courts say about commercial industry groups is
that  they  cannot  be  trusted  to  set  their  own  standards  for  fear  that
the care necessary to protect their customers will be lacking. Viewed
in this manner, the court in Rossell reafﬁrms the principles underlying

(e.g.,

Judge  Hand’s  decision  in  The  T.J.  Hooper  while  revealing  why  a
departure from this principle is applicable to true professionals.

B. Informed Consent

One unique subset of medical malpractice cases involves a physician
who  treats  a  patient  without  obtaining  their  informed  consent.  In
such a case, the patient suffers some side effect from the treatment
and  claims  that  they  would  not  have  agreed  to  the  treatment  if  the
doctor had disclosed such risk as an inherent potential aspect of the
treatment.  If  the  bad  outcome  arises  from  faulty  treatment  it  would
be a normal medical malpractice case. But sometimes even when the
treatment
in  conformance  with
applicable  medical  customs  there  may  still  be  certain  inherent  risks
of  some  side  effects.  It  is  in  such  instances,  when  a  patient  who
experiences such a side effect from otherwise proper treatment, that
an informed consent claim may be available when the physician has
failed  to  disclose  this  risk.  Of  course,  if  the  doctor  truly  obtains  no
consent before treating a patient, the doctor may have committed a
battery.  What  we  are  instead  analyzing  is  the  instance  when  the

is  appropriate  and  performed

patient does give consent to the treatment but complains that it was
not informed. Courts have recognized this type of claim as a subset
of  medical  negligence  but  have  had  some  difﬁculty  analyzing  the
standard  for  determining  what  information  must  be  disclosed  and
how  to  prove  actual  causation  on  this  unique  cause  of  action.  The
Scott case below illustrates a state’s decision to recognize this cause
of action and determine the proper method to analyze it.

SCOTT v. BRADFORD
606 P.2d 554 (Okla. 1979)

      , J.

This appeal is taken by plaintiffs in trial below, from a judgment in
favor of defendant rendered on a jury verdict in a medical malpractice
action.

Mrs. Scott’s physician advised her she had several ﬁbroid tumors
on  her  uterus.  He  referred  her  to  defendant  surgeon.  Defendant
admitted her to the hospital where she signed a routine consent form
prior  to  defendant’s  performing  a  hysterectomy.  After  surgery,  Mrs.
Scott  experienced  problems  with  incontinence.  She  visited  another
physician  who  discovered  she  had  a  vesico-vaginal  ﬁstula  which
permitted  urine  to  leak  from  her  bladder  into  the  vagina.  This
physician  referred  her  to  an  urologist  who,  after  three  surgeries,
succeeded in correcting her problems.

Mrs. Scott, joined by her husband, ﬁled the present action alleging
medical  malpractice,  claiming  defendant  failed  to  advise  her  of  the
risks  involved  or  of  available  alternatives  to  surgery.  She  further
maintained had she been properly informed she would have refused
the surgery.

The  case  was  submitted  to  the  jury  with  instructions  to  which
plaintiffs objected. The jury found for defendant and plaintiffs appeal.

The  issue  involved  is  whether  Oklahoma  adheres  to  the  doctrine
of
informed  consent  as  the  basis  of  an  action  for  medical
malpractice, and if so did the present instructions adequately advise
the jury of defendant’s duty.

Anglo-American  law  starts  with  the  premise  of  thoroughgoing
self-determination,  each  man  considered  to  be  his  own  master.  This
law does not permit a physician to substitute his judgment for that of
the patient by any form of artiﬁce. The doctrine of informed consent
arises out of this premise.

Consent  to  medical  treatment,  to  be  effective,  should  stem  from
an understanding decision based on adequate information about the
treatment,  the  available  alternatives,  and  the  collateral  risks.  This
requirement,  labeled  “informed  consent,”  is,  legally  speaking,  as
essential  as  a  physician’s  care  and  skill  in  the  performance  of  the
therapy.  The  doctrine  imposes  a  duty  on  a  physician  or  surgeon  to
inform a patient of his options and their attendant risks. If a physician
breaches  this  duty,  patient’s  consent  is  defective,  and  physician  is
responsible for the consequences.

If  treatment  is  completely  unauthorized  and  performed  without
any consent at all, there has been a battery. However, if the physician
obtains a patient’s consent but has breached his duty to inform, the
patient  has  a  cause  of  action  sounding  in  negligence  for  failure  to
inform the patient of his options, regardless of the due care exercised
at treatment, assuming there is injury.

influential

Until today, Oklahoma has not ofﬁcially adopted this doctrine.
[I]n  perhaps  one  of  the  most

informed  consent
decisions,  Canterbury  v.  Spence,  464  F.2d  772  (D.C.  Cir.  1972)  cert.
den, 409 U.S. 1064, the doctrine received perdurable impetus. Judge
Robinson  observed  that  suits  charging  failure  by  a  physician
adequately  to  disclose  risks  and  alternatives  of  proposed  treatment
were not innovative in American law. He emphasized the fundamental
concept  in  American  jurisprudence  that  every  human  being  of  adult

years  and  sound  mind  has  a  right  to  determine  what  shall  be  done
with his own body. True consent to what happens to one’s self is the
informed exercise of a choice. This entails an opportunity to evaluate
knowledgeably  the  options  available  and  the  risks  attendant  upon
each. It is the prerogative of every patient to chart his own course and
determine which direction he will take.

The  decision  in  Canterbury  recognized  the  tendency  of  some
jurisdictions  to  turn  this  duty  on  whether  it  is  the  custom  of
physicians  practicing  in  the  community  to  make  the  particular
disclosure  to  the  patient.  That  court  rejected  this  standard  and  held
the  standard  measuring  performance  of  the  duty  of  disclosure  is
conduct  which  is  reasonable  under  the  circumstances:  “[We  cannot]
ignore the fact that to bind disclosure obligations to medical usage is
to  arrogate  the  decision  on  revelation  to  the  physician  alone.”  We
agree.  A  patient’s  right  to  make  up  his  mind  whether  to  undergo
treatment should not be delegated to the local medical group. What is
reasonable  disclosure  in  one  instance  may  not  be  reasonable  in
another.  We  decline  to  adopt  a  standard  based  on  the  professional
the  scope  of  a  physician’s
standard.  We,
communications  must  be  measured  by  his  patient’s  need  to  know
enough  to  enable  him  to  make  an  intelligent  choice.  In  other  words,
full  disclosure  of  all  material  risks  incident  to  treatment  must  be
made.  There  is  no  bright  line  separating  the  material  from  the
immaterial;  it  is  a  question  of  fact.  A  risk  is  material  if  it  would  be
likely to affect patient’s decision. When non-disclosure of a particular
risk is open to debate, the issue is for the ﬁnder of facts.

therefore,  hold

This duty to disclose is the ﬁrst element of the cause of action in
negligence  based  on  lack  of  informed  consent.  However,  there  are
exceptions creating a privilege of a physician not to disclose. There is
no need to disclose risks that either ought  to  be  known  by  everyone
or  are  already  known  to  the  patient.  Further,  the  primary  duty  of  a
physician  is  to  do  what  is  best  for  his  patient  and  where  full
disclosure  would  be  detrimental  to  a  patient’s  total  care  and  best

interests  a  physician  may  withhold  such  disclosure,  for  example,
where disclosure would alarm an emotionally upset or apprehensive
patient. Certainly too, where there is an emergency and the patient is
in no condition to determine for himself whether treatment should be
administered, the privilege may be invoked.

The  patient  has  the  burden  of  going  forward  with  evidence
tending to establish prima facie the essential elements of the cause
of action. The burden of proving an exception to his duty and thus a
privilege  not  to  disclose,  rests  upon  the  physician  as  an  afﬁrmative
defense.

The cause of action, based on lack of informed consent, is divided
into  three  elements:  the  duty  to  inform  being  the  ﬁrst,  the  second  is
causation,  and  the  third  is  injury.  The  second  element,  that  of
causation,  requires  that  plaintiff  patient  would  have  chosen  no
treatment or a different course of treatment had the alternatives and
material risks of each been made known to him. If the patient would
have elected to proceed with treatment had he been duly informed of
its risks, then the element of causation is missing. In other words, a
causal  connection  exists  between  physician’s  breach  of  the  duty  to
disclose  and  patient’s  injury  when  and  only  when  disclosure  of
material  risks  incidental  to  treatment  would  have  resulted  in  a
decision against it. A patient obviously has no complaint if he would
have  submitted  to  the  treatment  if  the  physician  had  complied  with
his duty and informed him of the risks. This fact decision raises the
difﬁcult question of the correct standard on which to instruct the jury.
The  court  in  Canterbury v. Spence,  supra,  although  emphasizing
principles of self-determination permits liability only if non-disclosure
would  have  affected  the  decision  of  a  ﬁctitious  “reasonable  patient,”
even though actual patient testiﬁes he would have elected to forego
therapy had he been fully informed.

Decisions  discussing  informed  consent  have  emphasized  the
disclosure  element  but  paid  scant  attention  to  the  consent  element

of  the  concept,  although  this  is  the  root  of  causation.  Language  in
some  decisions  suggest  the  standard  to  be  applied  is  a  subjective
one, i.e., whether that particular patient would still have consented to
the  treatment,  reasonable  choice  or  otherwise.  See  Woods  v.
Brumlop,  supra,  n.8;  Wilkinson  v.  Vesey,  supra,  n.3;  Gray  v.
Grunnagle, 223 A.2d 663 (Pa. 1966); Poulin v. Zartman, 542 P.2d 251
(Alas. 1975) reh. den., 548 P.2d 1299 (Alas. 1976).

its  own

Although  the  Canterbury  rule  is  probably  that  of  the  majority,  its
“reasonable  man”  approach  has  been  criticized  by  some
commentators  as  backtracking  on
theory  of  self-
determination.  The  Canterbury  view  certainly  severely  limits  the
protection granted an injured patient. To the extent the plaintiff, given
an adequate disclosure, would have declined the proposed treatment,
and  a  reasonable  person  in  similar  circumstances  would  have
consented,  a  patient’s  right  of  self-determination  is  irrevocably  lost.
This  basic  right  to  know  and  decide  is  the  reason  for  the  full-
disclosure rule. Accordingly, we decline to jeopardize this right by the
imposition of the “reasonable man” standard.

If  a  plaintiff  testiﬁes  he  would  have  continued  with  the  proposed
treatment  had  he  been  adequately  informed,  the  trial  is  over  under
either  the  subjective  or  objective  approach.  If  he  testiﬁes  he  would
not,  then  the  causation  problem  must  be  resolved  by  examining  the
credibility  of  plaintiff’s  testimony.  The  jury  must  be  instructed  that  it
must ﬁnd plaintiff would have refused the treatment if he is to prevail.
Although it might be said this approach places a physician at the
mercy  of  a  patient’s  hindsight,  a  careful  practitioner  can  always
protect  himself  by  insuring  that  he  has  adequately  informed  each
patient he treats. If he does not breach this duty, a causation problem
will not arise.

The ﬁnal element of this cause of action is that of injury. The risk
must  actually  materialize  and  plaintiff  must  have  been  injured  as  a
result  of  submitting  to  the  treatment.  Absent  occurrence  of  the

undisclosed  risk,  a  physician’s  failure  to  reveal  its  possibility  is  not
actionable.

In summary, in a medical malpractice action a patient suing under

the theory of informed consent must allege and prove:

1)  defendant  physician  failed  to  inform  him  adequately  of  a  material  risk

before securing his consent to the proposed treatment;

2) if he had been informed of the risks he would not have consented to the

treatment;

3)  the  adverse  consequences  that  were  not  made  known  did  in  fact  occur

and he was injured as a result of submitting to the treatment.

Because  we  are  imposing  a  new  duty  on  physicians,  we  hereby
make this opinion prospective only, affecting those causes of action
arising after the date this opinion is promulgated.

The  trial  court  in  the  case  at  bar  gave  rather  broad  instructions
upon the duty of a physician to disclose. The instructions objected to
did  instruct  that  defendant  should  have  disclosed  material  risks  of
the  hysterectomy  and  feasibility  of  alternatives.  Instructions  are
sufﬁcient when considered as a whole they present the law applicable
to the issues. Jury found for defendant. We ﬁnd no basis for reversal.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Standard for Determining the Duty.  Courts have recognized the
informed  consent  cause  of  action  based  upon  the  principle  of
autonomy  of  the  individual  to  make  their  own  medical  decisions.  If
the doctor obtains your consent without advising you of the possible
negative  aspects  of  treatment,  courts  conclude  that  the  doctor  has
committed  a  form  of  medical  malpractice.  Originally,  as  courts
recognized  this  type  of  malpractice  claim  they  naturally  utilized  the
professional  standard  of  care  as  they  would  with  any  other
malpractice  claim.  That  is,  the  governing  standard  was  what  other
similar  medical  professionals  advised  their  patients  about  the  side

effects  of  the  treatment.  In  the  case  above,  the  Scott  court  rejects
this standard for several reasons, but most importantly because  the
professional standard is inconsistent with the autonomy at the heart
of  the  informed  consent  claim.  The  professional  standard  applied  in
this  context  seems  inappropriately  paternalistic  to  most  modern
courts.  Instead,  the  courts  have  adopted  the  objective,  reasonably
prudent  patient  standard  in  deciding  what  side  effects  of  treatment
are  “material.”  The  biggest  criticism  of  this  standard  is  that  it  leaves
doctors in an awkward gray zone where it may not be clear (until after
a  malpractice  case  is  ﬁled  and  tried  to  a  jury)  to  a  doctor  what
possible ill effects need to be disclosed. It can result in the defensive
practice  of  medicine  with  doctors  disclosing  every  far-flung  remote
side  effect  possible.  As  a  consequence,  patients  may  have  a  hard
time deciphering the signiﬁcant risks from the theoretical risks.

2. Causation Analysis.  The second issue the courts adopting this
cause of action have to determine is what standard should be used in
assessing actual but-for causation. After all, just because the patient
suffers the side effect does not establish causation by itself because
the malpractice is not in the manner of treatment but in the failure to
let the patient make the treatment decision. If the patient would have
opted  for  the  treatment  even  with  full  disclosure  it  is  difﬁcult  to  see
how  the  malpractice  has  caused  any  harm.  Courts  have  chosen
between  the  objective,  reasonably  prudent  patient  standard  or  the
actual subjective statements of the plaintiff. Many courts have opted
for  the  objective  standard  for  causation  out  of  practical  recognition
that  any  informed  consent  plaintiff,  aided  by  hindsight,  is  likely  to
testify  that  she  would  have  declined  the  treatment  if  only  she  had
known  of  the  risk.  Even  with  this  possibility,  the  Scott  court  still
rejects  this  objective  standard  for  causation  because  the  plaintiff
ultimately  has  the  choice  to  accept  or  reject  treatment  and  this
choice  is  so  personal  that  it  should  not  matter  if  the  decision  was
reasonably made. The jury, of course, can still reject a plaintiff’s self-
serving testimony if they do not ﬁnd the plaintiff credible.

in
3.  Emergency  Consent.   As  the  court  observes  in  Scott,
emergency scenarios where the patient is not able to give consent to
necessary  treatment,  courts  have  allowed  doctors  the  privilege  to
provide  medical  care  given  in  good  faith.  Of  course,  if  the  treatment
itself  falls  below  the  professional  standard,  the  doctor  can  still  be
subject to a malpractice suit.

C. Limitations on a Professional’s Duty

Another important issue courts have faced is how far the duty of care
stretches  for  professionals.  Speciﬁcally,  courts  have  sometimes
faced malpractice claims brought by a non-client of the professional.
In  the  Elliott  case  below,  one  state’s  highest  court  has  to  determine
whether  a  lawyer  can  be  subject  to  a  legal  malpractice  suit  brought
by  individuals  who  claim  to  have  been  adversely  impacted  by  the
lawyer’s possible mistakes in performing some estate planning for his
client.  There  are  powerful  reasons  given  to  permit  this  claim  to  go
forward, as many courts have done in similar circumstances, but this
court  determines  that  it  is  more  important  to  limit  the  duty  of  the
lawyer.

BARCELO, III v. ELLIOTT
923 S.W.2d 575 (Tex. 1996)

        , C.J.

The issue presented is whether an attorney who negligently drafts
a will or trust agreement owes a duty of care to persons intended to
beneﬁt  under  the  will  or  trust,  even  though  the  attorney  never
represented the intended beneﬁciaries. The court of appeals held that
the  attorney  owed  no  duty  to  the  beneﬁciaries,  afﬁrming  the  trial
court’s  summary  judgment  for  the  defendant-attorney.  Because  the

attorney did not represent the beneﬁciaries, we likewise conclude that
he  owed  no  professional  duty  to  them.  We  accordingly  afﬁrm  the
judgment of the court of appeals.

After Frances Barcelo retained attorney David Elliott to assist her
with  estate  planning,  Elliott  drafted  a  will  and  inter  vivos  trust
agreement for her. The will provided for speciﬁc bequests to Barcelo’s
children,  devising  the  residuary  of  her  estate  to  the  inter  vivos  trust.
Under  the  trust  agreement,  trust  income  was  to  be  distributed  to
Barcelo  during  her  lifetime.  Upon  her  death,  the  trust  was  to
terminate,  assets  were  to  be  distributed  in  speciﬁc  amounts  to
Barcelo’s  children  and  siblings,  and  the  remainder  was  to  pass  to
Barcelo’s  six  grandchildren.  The  trust  agreement  contemplated  that
the  trust  would  be  funded  by  cash  and  shares  of  stock  during
Barcelo’s lifetime, although the grandchildren contend that this never
occurred.  Barcelo  signed  the  will  and  trust  agreement  in  September
1990.

Barcelo  died  on  January  22,  1991.  After  two  of  her  children
contested the validity of the trust, the probate court, for reasons not
disclosed on the record before us, declared the trust to be invalid and
unenforceable.  Barcelo’s  grandchildren — the
intended  remainder
beneﬁciaries under the trust — subsequently agreed to settle for what
they  contend  was  a  substantially  smaller  share  of  the  estate  than
what they would have received pursuant to a valid trust.

Barcelo’s  grandchildren  then  ﬁled  the  present  malpractice  action
against  Elliott  and  his  law  ﬁrm  (collectively  “Elliott”).  Plaintiffs  allege
that  Elliott’s  negligence  caused  the  trust  to  be  invalid,  resulting  in
foreseeable  injury  to  the  plaintiffs.  Elliott  moved  for  summary
judgment on the sole ground that he owed no professional duty to the
grandchildren because he had never represented them. The trial court
granted Elliott’s motion for summary judgment.

The court of appeals afﬁrmed, concluding that under Texas law an
attorney  preparing  estate  planning  documents  owes  a  duty  only  to

his  or  her  client — the  testator  or  trust  settlor — not  to  third  parties
intended to beneﬁt under the estate plan.

The  sole  issue  presented  is  whether  Elliott  owes  a  duty  to  the
grandchildren that could give rise to malpractice liability even though
he  represented  only  Frances  Barcelo,  not  the  grandchildren,  in
preparing and implementing the estate plan.

At common law, an attorney owes a duty of care only to his or her
client,  not  to  third  parties  who  may  have  been  damaged  by  the
attorney’s negligent representation of the client. See Savings Bank v.
Ward,  100  U.S.  195,  200  (1879);  Annotation,  Attorney’s  Liability,  to
One Other Than Immediate Client, for Negligence in Connection with
Legal  Duties,  61  A.L.R.  4th  615,  624  (1988).  Without  this  “privity
barrier,”  the  rationale  goes,  clients  would  lose  control  over  the
attorney-client relationship, and attorneys would be subject to almost
unlimited liability. Texas courts of appeals have uniformly applied the
privity  barrier  in  the  estate  planning  context.  See  Thomas  v.  Pryor,
847  S.W.2d  303,  304-05  (Tex.  App. — Dallas  1992),  judgm’t  vacated
by agr., 863 S.W.2d 462 (Tex. 1993).

Plaintiffs  argue,  however,  that  recognizing  a  limited  exception  to
the  privity  barrier  as  to  lawyers  who  negligently  draft  a  will  or  trust
would  not  thwart  the  rule’s  underlying  rationales.  They  contend  that
the attorney should owe a duty of care to persons who were speciﬁc,
intended beneﬁciaries of the estate plan. We disagree.

The  majority  of  other  states  addressing  this  issue  have  relaxed
the privity barrier in the estate planning context. See Lucas v. Hamm,
56 Cal. 2d 583, 364 P.2d 685, 689, 15 Cal. Rptr. 821 (Cal. 1961), cert.
denied, 368 U.S. 987, 7 L. Ed. 2d 525, 82 S. Ct. 603 (1962); Stowe v.
Smith,  184  Conn.  194,  441  A.2d  81,  83  (Conn.  1981);  Needham  v.
Hamilton, 459 A.2d 1060, 1062 (D.C. 1983); DeMaris v. Asti,  426  So.
2d 1153, 1154 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1983); Ogle v. Fuiten, 102 Ill. 2d 356,
466 N.E.2d 224, 226-27, 80 Ill. Dec. 772 (Ill. 1984); Walker v. Lawson,
526  N.E.2d  968,  968  (Ind.  1988);  Schreiner  v.  Scoville,  410  N.W.2d
679, 682 (Iowa 1987); Pizel v. Zuspann, 247 Kan. 54, 795 P.2d 42, 51

(Kan. 1990); In re Killingsworth, 292 So. 2d 536, 542 (La. 1973); Hale
v.  Groce,  304  Ore.  281,  744  P.2d  1289,  1292-93  (Or.  1987);  Guy  v.
Liederbach,  501  Pa.  47,  459  A.2d  744,  751-53  (Pa.  1983);  Auric  v.
Continental  Cas.  Co.,  111  Wis.  2d  507,  331  N.W.2d  325,  327  (Wis.
1983).  But  see  Lilyhorn  v.  Dier,  214  Neb.  728,  335  N.W.2d  554,  555
(Neb. 1983); Viscardi v. Lerner, 125 A.D.2d 662, 510 N.Y.S.2d 183, 185
(N.Y.  App.  Div.  1986);  Simon  v.  Zipperstein,  32  Ohio  St.  3d  74,  512
N.E.2d 636, 638 (Ohio 1987).

While some of these states have allowed a broad cause of action
by those claiming to be intended beneﬁciaries, others have limited the
class  of  plaintiffs  to  beneﬁciaries  speciﬁcally  identiﬁed  in  an  invalid
will or trust. See Ventura County Humane Society v. Holloway, 40 Cal.
App.  3d  897,  115  Cal.  Rptr.  464,  468  (Cal.  Dist.  Ct.  App.  1974);
DeMaris, 426 So. 2d at 1154; Schreiner, 410 N.W.2d at 683; Kirgan v.
Parks, 60 Md. App. 1, 478 A.2d 713, 718-19 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1984)
(holding that, if cause of action exists, it does not extend to situation
where testator’s intent as expressed in the will has been carried out);
Ginther  v.  Zimmerman,  195  Mich.  App.  647,  491  N.W.2d  282,  286
(Mich. Ct. App. 1992) (same); Guy, 459 A.2d at 751-52. The Supreme
Court of Iowa, for example, held that

a cause of action ordinarily will arise only when as a direct result of the lawyer’s
professional  negligence  the  testator’s  intent  as  expressed  in  the  testamentary
instruments is frustrated in whole or in part and the beneﬁciary’s interest in the
estate is either lost, diminished, or unrealized.

Schreiner v. Scoville, 410 N.W.2d 679, 683 (Iowa 1987).

We  agree  with  those  courts  that  have  rejected  a  broad  cause  of
action  in  favor  of  beneﬁciaries.  These  courts  have  recognized  the
inevitable problems with disappointed heirs attempting to prove that
the  defendant-attorney  failed  to  implement  the  deceased  testator’s
intentions.  Certainly  allowing  extrinsic  evidence  would  create  a  host
of difﬁculties. In DeMaris v. Asti, 426 So. 2d 1153, 1154 (Fla. Dist. Ct.
App.  1983),  for  example,  the  court  concluded  that  “there  is  no

authority — the  reasons  being  obvious — for  the  proposition  that  a
disappointed  beneﬁciary  may  prove,  by  evidence  totally  extrinsic  to
the  will,  the  testator’s  testamentary  intent  was  other  than  as
expressed in his solemn and properly executed will.” Such a cause of
action  would  subject  attorneys  to  suits  by  heirs  who  simply  did  not
receive what they believed to be their due share under the will or trust.
This  potential  tort  liability  to  third  parties  would  create  a  conflict
during  the  estate  planning  process,  dividing  the  attorney’s  loyalty
between his or her client and the third-party beneﬁciaries.

Moreover,  we  believe  that  the  more  limited  cause  of  action
jurisdictions  also  undermines  the  policy
recognized  by  several
rationales  supporting  the  privity  rule.  These  courts  have  limited  the
cause of action to beneﬁciaries speciﬁcally identiﬁed in an invalid will
or  trust.  Under  these  circumstances,  courts  have  reasoned,  the
interests  of  the  client  and  the  beneﬁciaries  are  necessarily  aligned,
negating  any  conflict,  as  the  attorney  owes  a  duty  only  to  those
parties  which  the  testator  clearly  intended  to  beneﬁt.  See,  e.g.,
Needham, 459 A.2d at 1062.

In  most  cases  where  a  defect  renders  a  will  or  trust  invalid,
however, there are concomitant questions as to the true intentions of
the  testator.  Suppose,  for  example,  that  a  properly  drafted  will  is
simply not executed at the time of the testator’s death. The document
may  express  the  testator’s  true  intentions,  lacking  signatures  solely
because  of  the  attorney’s  negligent  delay.  On  the  other  hand,  the
testator may have postponed execution because of second thoughts
latter  situation,  the
regarding  the  distribution  scheme.
attorney’s representation of the testator will likely be affected if he or
she  knows  that  the  existence  of  an  unexecuted  will  may  create
malpractice liability if the testator unexpectedly dies.

In  the

The  present  case  is  indicative  of  the  conflicts  that  could  arise.
Plaintiffs  contend  in  part  that  Elliott  was  negligent  in  failing  to  fund
the trust during Barcelo’s lifetime, and in failing to obtain a signature
from  the  trustee.  These  alleged  deﬁciencies,  however,  could  have

existed  pursuant  to  Barcelo’s  instructions,  which  may  have  been
based on advice from her attorneys attempting to represent her best
interests.  An  attorney’s  ability  to  render  such  advice  would  be
severely  compromised  if  the  advice  could  be  second-guessed  by
persons named as beneﬁciaries under the unconsummated trust.

In  sum,  we  are  unable  to  craft  a  bright-line  rule  that  allows  a
lawsuit to proceed where alleged malpractice causes a will or trust to
fail in a manner that casts no real doubt on the testator’s intentions,
while  prohibiting  actions  in  other  situations.  We  believe  the  greater
good is served by preserving a bright-line privity rule which denies a
cause  of  action  to  all  beneﬁciaries  whom  the  attorney  did  not
represent.  This  will  ensure  that  attorneys  may  in  all  cases  zealously
represent  their  clients  without  the  threat  of  suit  from  third  parties
compromising that representation.

We therefore hold that an attorney retained by a testator or settlor
to  draft  a  will  or  trust  owes  no  professional  duty  of  care  to  persons
named as beneﬁciaries under the will or trust.

Plaintiffs also contend that, even if there is no tort duty extending
to  beneﬁciaries  of  an  estate  plan,  they  may  recover  under  a  third-
party-beneﬁciary  contract  theory.  While  the  majority  of  jurisdictions
that  have  recognized  a  cause  of  action  in  favor  of  will  or  trust
beneﬁciaries  have  done  so  under  negligence  principles,  some  have
allowed recovery in contract.

In Texas, however, a legal malpractice action sounds in tort and is
governed  by  negligence  principles.  See  Cosgrove  v.  Grimes,  774
S.W.2d 662, 664 (Tex. 1989); Willis v. Maverick, 760 S.W.2d 642, 644
(Tex. 1988). Cf. Heyer v. Flaig,  70  Cal.  2d  223,  449  P.2d  161,  164,  74
Cal.  Rptr.  225  (Cal.  1969)  (recognizing  that  third-party-beneﬁciary
contract  theory  “is  conceptually  superfluous  since  the  crux  of  the
action must lie in tort in any case; there can be no recovery without
negligence”).  Even  assuming  that  a  client  who  retains  a  lawyer  to
draft an estate plan intends for the lawyer’s work to beneﬁt the will or

trust  beneﬁciaries,  the  ultimate  question  is  whether,  considering  the
competing  policy  implications,  the  lawyer’s  professional  duty  should
extend  to  persons  whom  the  lawyer  never  represented.  For  the
reasons previously discussed, we conclude that the answer is no.

For the foregoing reasons, we afﬁrm the judgment of the court of

appeals.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

for

fear

lawyers  without

1.  Privity  as  a  Limit  on  Duty.   The  Elliott  court  begins  by
recognizing  the  general  rule  that  permits  only  clients  to  sue  lawyers
for  malpractice.  This  privity  rule  helps  to  clarify  to  whom  the  lawyer
owes a duty of care and helps to avoid a potential division of loyalties
by  the  lawyer.  The  rule  also  facilitates  the  unhindered  zealous
representation  of  clients  by
the
consequences  of  their  representation  on  third  parties.  Against  these
good  reasons  for  the  limitation  on  duty,  however,  the  court  admits
that the majority of courts in this estate-planning context are willing
to  recognize  some  claims  by  beneﬁciaries  despite  the  lack  of  privity
of contract with the lawyer. The broad exception permits any stranger
to a will to argue that the lawyer’s neglect explains their absence from
being  named  a  beneﬁciary.  Obviously  recognizing  such  claims  is
potentially  troublesome  because  anyone  might  make  such  a  claim
after the death of a wealthy individual. The narrow exception is more
limited — it  only  applies  to  permit  a  malpractice  claim  by  named
beneﬁciaries when the will or trust instrument is declared invalid due
to the lawyer’s negligence. The Elliott court says that trusts and wills
are  often  held  invalid  for  technical  reasons  that  cast  doubt  on
whether the instruments prepared by the lawyer accurately reflect the
testator/client’s true intentions; the court was, therefore, unwilling to
permit any exception to the strict privity rule for limiting the lawyer’s
duty.  This  general  issue  comes  up  in  other  professional  malpractice

issue  also  comes  up

claims  with  most  courts  typically  limiting  the  duty  in  a  similar  way.
Generally  only  patients  can  sue  doctors  for  malpractice.  (Though
recall  under  Tarasoff  that  third  parties  hurt  by  the  patient  can
sometimes  sue  the  patient’s  doctor,  but  these  are  not  technically
considered  malpractice  claims.)  This
in
accountant  claims  for  negligent  misrepresentation  when  investors
claim  the  accountant’s  errors  misstated  a  company’s  true  ﬁnancial
picture.  There  is  a  wide  body  of  conflicting  case  law  in  this
accountant  malpractice  area  with  the  traditional  rule  being  one  of
strict privity but modern courts being willing to consider a somewhat
broader  rule  of  duty  owed  to  known  potential  investors.  See  e.g.,
Grant  Thornton  LLP  v.  Prospect  High  Income  Fund,  314  S.W.3d  913
(Tex. 2010) (outlining the various approaches taken by courts on the
extent of an accountant’s duty of care in negligent misrepresentation
cases). This area of law is covered in Chapter 13, Business Torts.

2. Causation in a Legal Malpractice Claim.  If a lawyer is accused of
mishandling  a  case  for  a  client,  proof  of  actual  causation  of  harm
must  be  predicated  on  proof  that  the  client  would  have  won  the
underlying  case  but  for  the  lawyer’s  negligence.  To  determine
causation in the malpractice case, the jury has to decide not only the
merits of the malpractice claim but the merits of the underlying suit
as  well.  This  concept  of  proving  causation  is  referred  to  sometimes
as  the  trial  within  the  trial.  In  such  a  suit,  much  of  the  evidence
offered  will  pertain  to  the  merits  of  the  initial  suit,  which  the
malpractice  jury  will  necessarily  have  to  hear  to  determine  if  the
lawyer’s mishandling of the initial case actually made any difference.

3.  No  Mention  of  Mere  Economic  Harm  Rule.   You  may  have
wondered, as you read the foregoing decision denying recovery to the
grandchildren,  why  the  court  did  not  just  cite  to  the  mere  economic
harm  rule  to  reject  a  duty  of  care.  Indeed,  would  not  this  doctrine
preclude  almost  all  legal  malpractice  claims — because  lawyers’
mistakes  usually  do  not  result  in  physical  injuries?  For  such  claims,
courts do not apply this doctrine because it is designed to provide a

limit  to  otherwise  unlimited  potential  liabilities.  Because  malpractice
claims  are  already  generally  limited  by  the  privity  rule — a  much
narrower  duty — there  is  no  concern  for  far-flung  unlimited  liabilities
rippling  out  from  a  lawyer’s  mistakes.  This  is  also  true  in  other
malpractice  or  negligent  misrepresentation  claims  against  other
professionals,  such  as  accountants.  This  is  discussed  further  in
Chapter 13, Business Torts.

Upon Further Review

Negligence claims against professionals raise interesting issues
in  analyzing  the  breach  of  duty  as  well  as  causation.  To  the
extent  a  defendant  is  part  of  a  special  group  that,  due  to  its
nature  and  special  relationships  with  clients/patients,  can  be
trusted to set relatively high standards for itself, courts recognize
a  departure  from  the  doctrine  in  The  T.J.  Hooper  that  we
encountered  in  Chapter  4.  Rather  than  utilize  the  reasonable
man  as  the  standard  of  care,  courts  instead  look  exclusively  to
industry  custom.  Where  the  professional  is  operating  within  a
recognized school of thought in her profession, she operates in a
safe  harbor  zone  and  cannot  be  proven  to  have  breached  her
professional  duty.  If  a  breach  of  custom  can  be  demonstrated,
plaintiffs  often  have  unique  causation  issues  with  which  to
contend.  In  medical  malpractice  cases,  the  plaintiff  might  have
trouble  proving  but-for  causation  if  the  doctor’s  negligence
merely  deprived  the  plaintiff  of  a  somewhat  better  chance  of
recovery.  If  the  negligence  probably  made  no  difference,  some
courts  will  reject  any  recovery  and  others  will  offer  a  reduced
recovery based upon the percentage reduction times the actual
harm actually experienced. In claims for failure to give informed
consent, the plaintiff will need to demonstrate that either she or
a  reasonable  patient  would  not  have  undergone  the  procedure

with  proper  information  about  the  inherent  side  effects.  And  in
legal  malpractice  claims  involving  the  mishandling  of  prior
litigation,  the  jury  will  need  to  determine  the  merits  of  not  only
the malpractice allegations but also the merits of the underlying
lawsuit — for unless the lawyer’s negligence turned a victory into
a  loss,  the  professional  blunder  would  be  considered  nothing
more than “negligence in the air” and would impose no liability on
the lawyer.

Pulling It All Together

George  lived  in  a  suburban  house  by  himself.  Being  an  avid
athlete,  he  purchased  an  in-ground  basketball  goal  for  his
driveway and began to install this goal. He was pretty gifted with
his  hands  and  did  not  feel  the  need  to  consult  the  instructional
manual. He worked on the goal for several hours and believed it
was  complete.  There  were  some  extra  nuts  and  bolts  left  over.
He  considered  testing  the  strength  of  the  goal  but  ran  out  of
time, as he desired to attend a floral exhibition at the community
garden center.

Dennis  was  a  six-year-old  boy  who  lived  with  his  parents
Henry  and  Alice,  next  door  to  George.  He  had  a  way  of  getting
into  trouble.  George  was  constantly  having  to  run  Dennis  off  of
his  property,  as  Dennis  was  a  cause  of  much  consternation  to
George.  On  this  particular  date,  Dennis  was  watching  from  a

distance as George was building the new basketball goal. Dennis
stood  across
the  street  bouncing  a  basketball,  eagerly
anticipating  the  chance  to  shoot  baskets.  As  George  drove  off,
Dennis ran onto George’s property and began shooting baskets.
Dennis  noticed  a  mini-trampoline  in  George’s  garage.  He  had
seen mascots at basketball games jump from such trampolines
to  dunk  a  basketball  and  decided  to  do  likewise.  On  his  ﬁrst
attempt,  he  soared  into  the  air,  dunked  the  basketball,  and  then
grabbed  the  rim  for  dear  life.  His  weight  was  too  much  for  the
new goal. As it turns out, some necessary screws had been left
unsecured  in  the  goal.  The  entire  apparatus  fell  over  on  top  of
poor Dennis. Dennis lay on the ground screaming in agony. A few
minutes later, a schoolmate named Tommy came walking by. He
saw Dennis in pain and ran to his assistance. Tommy had seen
CPR  performed  on  television  and,  despite  the  fact  that  Dennis
was  conscious,  he  began  pounding  on  Dennis’s  chest.  This
caused Dennis’s sternum to crack and made Dennis’s condition
worse.

Eventually  an  ambulance  arrived.  The  paramedics  secured
Dennis  into  their  vehicle  and  rushed  toward  the  hospital.  At  the
hospital, the emergency room physician set some open fractures
in Dennis’s arm and provided him with pain medication. She did
not, however, prescribe any antibiotics for the open wound. A few
days  after  his  discharge,  Dennis’s  wounds  became  horribly
infected  and  he  went  to  see  a  different  doctor  at  the  same
hospital.  This  doctor,  a  surgeon,  ultimately  determined  that  the
arm could not be saved and amputated it. The surgeon indicated
that his personal practice would be to always give antibiotics for
compound fractures. While this would not absolutely prevent all
infections, it made them less likely to occur.

I  INTRODUCTION

Even  when  the  plaintiff  in  a  tort  suit  can  prove  the  elements  of  her
cause of action, this does not necessarily mean that the war is over.
Tort law has recognized a number of doctrines that can still serve to
defeat  (or  sometimes  lessen)  the  plaintiff’s  attempted  recovery.
These  are  considered  “afﬁrmative  defenses” — defenses  that,  in
effect, say “even though you have proven my negligent conduct was
the legal cause of your harm, I still win because_______.” This chapter
will  ﬁll  in  that  blank  with  a  variety  of  potential  afﬁrmative  defenses.
Chapter 3 introduced some afﬁrmative defenses unique to intentional
torts.  This  chapter  covers  afﬁrmative  defenses  of  a  more  general
application,  including  defenses  to  negligence  claims.  Whereas  a
plaintiff  has  the  burden  of  proving  the  elements  of  her  claim,  a
defendant  has  the  burden  of  proving  any  afﬁrmative  defenses.  A
number  of  these  defenses  have  been  modiﬁed  by  relatively  recent
developments  in  the  law,  some  of  them  late  in  coming.  Often,
changes  to  these  afﬁrmative  defenses  have  been  driven  by  state
legislatures  rather  than  the  common  law.  Mastering  these  defenses
and  understanding  the  rationale  behind  them  are  the  twin  goals  of
this chapter.

BUTTERFIELD v. FORRESTER
103 Eng. Rep. 926 (1809)

This was an action on the case for obstructing a highway, by means
of which obstruction the plaintiff, who was riding along the road, was
thrown down with his horse, and injured. At the trial before Bayley, J.
at  Derby,  it  appeared  that  the  defendant,  for  the  purpose  of  making
some  repairs  to  his  house,  which  was  close  by  the  road  side  at  one

end of the town, had put up a pole across this part of the road, a free
passage being left by another branch or street in the same direction.
That the plaintiff left a public house not far distant from the place in
question  at  8  o’clock  in  the  evening  in  August,  when  they  were  just
beginning  to  light  candles,  but  while  there  was  light  enough  left  to
discern the obstruction at 100 yards distance: and the witness, who
proved this, said that if the plaintiff had not been riding very hard he
might  have  observed  and  avoided  it:  the  plaintiff  however,  who  was
riding violently, did not observe it, but rode against it, and fell with his
horse and was much hurt in consequence of the accident; and there
was no evidence of his being intoxicated at the time. On this evidence
Bayley J. directed the jury, that if a person riding with reasonable and
ordinary  care  could  have  seen  and  avoided  the  obstruction;  and  if
they  were  satisﬁed  that  the  plaintiff  was  riding  along  the  street
extremely hard, and without ordinary care, they should ﬁnd a verdict
for  the  defendant,  which  they  accordingly  did.  [Plaintiff  requested  a
new trial; referred to as a “Rule,” which was denied for the reasons set
forth in the following two opinions.]

      , J. The plaintiff was proved to be riding as fast as his horse
could  go,  and  this  was  through  the  streets  of  Derby.  If  he  had  used
ordinary care he must have seen the obstruction; so that the accident
appeared to happen entirely from his own fault.

                  ,  C.J.  A  party  is  not  to  cast  himself  upon  an
obstruction  which  has  been  made  by  the  fault  of  another,  and  avail
himself of it, if he do not himself use common and ordinary caution to
be in the right. In cases of persons riding upon what is considered to
be  the  wrong  side  of  the  road,  that  would  not  authorize  another
purposely to ride up against them. One person being in fault will not
dispense  with  another’s  using  ordinary  care  for  himself.  Two  things
must concur to support this action, an obstruction in the road by the

fault of the defendant, and no want of ordinary care to avoid it on the
part of the plaintiff.

HARRIS v. MEADOWS
477 So. 2d 374 (Ala. 1985)

     , J.

This case involves a claim for damages for injuries resulting from

an automobile collision.

First  Avenue  North  in  Birmingham,  Alabama,  is  a  ﬁve-lane  street
consisting  of  two  eastbound  lanes,  two  westbound  lanes  and  a
center turn lane.

The plaintiff, Carol P. Harris, was driving east in the far right lane,
and  the  defendant,  Dora  Stubbs  Meadows,  was  in  the  center  lane
facing  west,  preparing  to  turn  left.  As  Harris  neared  Meadows,
Meadows  began  to  turn  in  front  of  Harris.  Harris  testiﬁed  that  she
blew her horn, applied her brakes, and “moved over to the right a little
bit.”  Meadows’s  vehicle  then  collided  with  the  left  side  of  Harris’s
vehicle in the area of the front fender and driver’s door. As a result of
the  collision,  Harris  suffered  a  cervical  sprain  and  a  contusion,  or
bruise, to her left hip.

Harris’s complaint contained counts alleging that the collision was
a  result  of  negligent  and  wanton  conduct  on  the  part  of  Meadows.
The wanton count was dismissed upon a motion by Meadows at the
close of all the evidence.

At  trial  Meadows  admitted  that  she  was  guilty  of  negligence  but
contended  that  Harris  should  not  recover  because  Harris  was  guilty
of  contributory  negligence.  Harris  appeals  from  a  judgment  on  the
jury’s verdict for Meadows, and a denial of her motion for a new trial.

Harris  argues  that  the  judgment  should  be  reversed  because  the
verdict upon which it is based is unsupported by facts and is contrary

to law.

A jury verdict is presumed correct and will not be set aside unless
it is without supporting evidence or is so contrary to the evidence as
to  render  it  wrong  and  unjust.  Where  the  jury  verdict  is  not  plainly
erroneous, we cannot consider other possible conclusions that might
have been reached. Kent v. Singleton, 457 So. 2d 356 (Ala. 1984).

In reviewing the record we note the following testimony by Harris:

Q.  How far from her vehicle would you say you were when you really

came down on your brakes in an attempt to stop?

A.   I  didn’t  really  come  down  on  my  brakes  in  an  attempt  to  stop.  I
slowed  down  to  see  that  maybe  she  could  get  on  across  there
and not hit me. But that was not possible. She was already on me
at that point.

Q.  Did you make any attempt to put on your brakes and come to a

stop and let this lady turn in front of you to go into Kelly’s?

A.  There wasn’t time.
Q.   But  you  never  did  come  down  hard  on  your  brakes,  lock  your
brakes,  skid,  and  attempt  to  stop.  You  were  going  to  see  if  she
had time to come in front of you?

A.   There  was  not  time  to  make  all  those  decisions.  I  just  slowed
down  thinking  she  would  see  me  coming  at  that  point  and  stop
her turn.

Q.   Did  you  ever  try  to  mash  your  brakes  to  the  floor  to  try  to  stop
your vehicle to keep from hitting the Chevrolet that was turning in
front of you?

A.  No, sir.

We are of the opinion that there was sufﬁcient evidence before the
jury  for
it  to  conclude  that  Harris  was  guilty  of  contributory
negligence  in  failing  to  act  reasonably  under  the  circumstances  to
avoid the collision. This case is perhaps illustrative of the harshness
of  the  contributory  negligence  doctrine,  a  doctrine  which,  like  the

scintilla  evidence  rule,  seems  to  be  ﬁrmly  established
jurisprudence.

in  our

There appearing no reversible error, the judgment is afﬁrmed.
AFFIRMED.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. All or Nothing.  Under the common law doctrine of contributory
negligence,  the  defense  was  an  all-or-nothing  proposition.  Either  the
plaintiff’s claim was completely unblemished by fault and the plaintiff
deemed worthy of recovery of all her damages from the defendant, or
she  could  recover  nothing  despite  proving  the  elements  of  the
defendant’s own negligence. Under this doctrine, the relative degrees
of fault between the plaintiff and the defendant were immaterial. Any
fault by the plaintiff destroyed her cause of action.

2. Justiﬁcations.  In both of the foregoing cases, did the plaintiffs
appear to have sufﬁcient evidence of the defendant’s negligence? Did
the  defendant’s  negligence  in  each  of  the  two  cases  appear  to  be
both an actual and proximate cause of each plaintiff’s harm as well?
If  so,  what  would  justify  denying  all  recovery  to  the  plaintiffs  and
permitting  the  defendants  to  avoid  any  responsibility?  What  tort
purposes  are  served  by  such  a  rule?  Are  any  tort  purposes
undermined?  Observe,  by  the  way,  that  in  the  Meadows  case,  the
defendant  likely  incurred  some  harm  during  the  car  accident  and
could have asserted her own counterclaim for negligence against the
plaintiff.  What  would  be  the  likely  result  of  such  a  counterclaim  if  it
were ﬁled?

3. Analysis  of  Contributory  Negligence.   Determining  whether  the
doctrine of contributory negligence is applicable requires application
of  the  same  elements  we  have  already  covered  with  respect  to
proving  a  defendant’s  liability — proof  of  a  duty,  breach,  cause  (both
actual  and  proximate),  and  harm.  All  doctrines  previously

encountered,  and  everything  we  have  learned  about  the  reasonable
person, applies with equal force to the analysis of a plaintiff’s fault.

4.  Problems.   Would  each  defendant  in  the  following  scenarios

appear to have a viable contributory negligence defense?

A.  While  driving  on  the

interstate  one  morning,  Plaintiff

is
distracted when she receives a text message on her phone. She
takes  her  eyes  off  the  road  to  read  the  text  message.  At  that
moment,  Defendant  suddenly  and  without  warning,  sharply
swerves  into  Plaintiff’s  lane  of  trafﬁc  and  sideswipes  Plaintiff’s
car.  Plaintiff  did  not  have  time  to  take  any  evasive  maneuvers,
even had she seen it happen.

B.  Despite  having  an  important  business  meeting  at  8:00  a.m.,
Plaintiff carelessly forgets to set his alarm clock the night before
and oversleeps. He misses his meeting and is driving to work at
8:30  a.m.  when  he  drives  his  car  into  a  controlled  intersection
with  a  green  light.  Defendant  has  a  red  light  but  ignores  it  and
drives  into  the  same  intersection  at  the  same  moment  as
Plaintiff  and  broadsides  Plaintiff’s  car.  Had  Plaintiff  awoken  on
time,  he  would  not  have  been  in  that  intersection  at  the  same
moment that Defendant ran the red light.

B. The Comparative Fault Reform

The  phrase  “tort  reform”  commonly  brings  to  mind  the  current
movement’s  predominant  form — efforts  to  curtail  the  ability  of
plaintiffs to bring tort claims and to recover for all of their harm. A few
decades ago, tort reform was just as likely to embody opposite goals.
Courts  and  legislatures  alike  began  to  express  discomfort  with  the
harshness of contributory negligence and to wonder whether that all-
or-nothing  doctrine
tort  principles  of
compensation, deterrence, and punishment, with the defense’s single-
minded focus on denying all rewards to negligent plaintiffs. The tide

has  now  turned  with  most,  but  not  all,  jurisdictions  abandoning
contributory  negligence  for  one  of  the  three  different  variations  of  a
comparative fault system. The following case explores this twentieth-
century variety of pro-plaintiff tort reform.

1. The Decision to Switch to Comparative Fault

McINTYRE v. BALENTINE
833 S.W.2d 52 (Tenn. 1992)

       , J.

In this personal injury action, we granted Plaintiff’s application for
permission to appeal in order to decide whether to adopt a system of
comparative  fault  in  Tennessee.  We  now  replace  the  common  law
defense  of  contributory  negligence  with  a  system  of  comparative
fault.

In the early morning darkness of November 2, 1986, Plaintiff-Harry
Douglas McIntyre and Defendant-Clifford Balentine were involved in a
motor  vehicle  accident  resulting  in  severe  injuries  to  Plaintiff.  The
accident  occurred  in  the  vicinity  of  Smith’s  Truck  Stop  in  Savannah,
Tennessee.  As  Defendant-Balentine  was  traveling  south  on  Highway
69, Plaintiff entered the highway (also traveling south) from the truck
stop parking lot. Shortly after Plaintiff entered the highway, his pickup
truck  was  struck  by  Defendant’s  Peterbilt  tractor.  At  trial,  the  parties
disputed  the  exact  chronology  of  events  immediately  preceding  the
accident.

Both  men  had  consumed  alcohol  the  evening  of  the  accident.
After the accident, Plaintiff’s blood alcohol level was measured at .17
percent  by  weight.  Testimony  suggested  that  Defendant  was
traveling in excess of the posted speed limit.

Plaintiff brought a negligence action against Defendant-Balentine
and  Defendant-East-West  Motor  Freight,  Inc.  Defendants  answered
that Plaintiff was contributorily negligent, in part due to operating his
vehicle while intoxicated. After trial, the jury returned a verdict stating:
“We, the jury, ﬁnd the plaintiff and the defendant equally at fault in this
accident; therefore, we rule in favor of the defendant.”

After  judgment  was  entered  for  Defendants,  Plaintiff  brought  an
appeal  alleging  the  trial  court  erred  by  refusing  to  instruct  the  jury
regarding  the  doctrine  of  comparative  negligence.  The  Court  of
Appeals afﬁrmed holding that comparative negligence is not the law
in Tennessee.

The  common

law  contributory  negligence  doctrine  has
traditionally been traced to Lord Ellenborough’s opinion in Butterfield
v. Forrester, 103 Eng. Rep. 926 (1809). There, plaintiff, “riding as fast
as his horse would go,” was injured after running into an obstruction
defendant had placed in the road. Stating as the rule that “one person
being  in  fault  will  not  dispense  with  another’s  using  ordinary  care,”
plaintiff was denied recovery on the basis that he did not use ordinary
care to avoid the obstruction.

issue  pleading;

law  system  of

The contributory negligence bar was soon brought to America as
part  of  the  common  law  and  proceeded  to  spread  throughout  the
states.  This  strict  bar  may  have  been  a  direct  outgrowth  of  the
common
issue  pleading  posed
questions  to  be  answered  “yes”  or  “no,”  leaving  common  law  courts,
the  theory  goes,  no  choice  but  to  award  all  or  nothing.  A  number  of
other  rationalizations  have  been  advanced  in  the  attempt  to  justify
the  harshness  of  the  “all-or-nothing”  bar.  Among  these:  the  plaintiff
should  be  penalized  for  his  misconduct;  the  plaintiff  should  be
injuring  himself;  and  the  plaintiff’s  negligence

supersedes the defendant’s so as to render defendant’s negligence no
longer proximate.

In Tennessee, the rule as initially stated was that “if a party, by his
own negligence, brings an injury upon himself, or contributes to such
injury,  he  cannot  recover;”  for,  in  such  cases,  the  party  “must  be
regarded as the author of his own misfortune.” Whirley v. Whiteman,
38  Tenn.  610,  619  (1858).  In  subsequent  decisions,  we  have
continued  to  follow  the  general  rule  that  a  plaintiff’s  contributory
negligence completely bars recovery. See, e.g., Hudson v. Gaitan, 675
S.W.2d 699, 704 (Tenn. 1984).

Equally entrenched in Tennessee jurisprudence are exceptions to
the  general  all-or-nothing  rule:  contributory  negligence  does  not
absolutely  bar  recovery  where  defendant’s  conduct  was  intentional,
see,  e.g.,  Stagner  v.  Craig,  19  S.W.2d  234,  234-35  (1929);  where
defendant’s  conduct  was  “grossly”  negligent,  see,  e.g.,  Ellithorpe  v.
Ford Motor Co.,  503  S.W.2d  516,  522  (Tenn.  1973);  where  defendant
had  the  “last  clear  chance”  with  which,  through  the  exercise  of
ordinary care, to avoid plaintiff’s injury, see, e.g., Roseberry v. Lippner,
574 S.W.2d 726, 728 (Tenn. 1978); or where plaintiff’s negligence may
be  classiﬁed  as  “remote.”  See,  e.g.,  Arnold  v.  Hayslett,  655  S.W.2d
941, 945 (Tenn. 1983).

In  contrast,  comparative  fault  has  long  been  the  federal  rule  in
cases  involving  injured  employees  of  interstate  railroad  carriers,  see
Federal  Employers’  Liability  Act,  ch.  149,  §3,  35  Stat.  66  (1908)
(codiﬁed at 45 U.S.C. §53 (1988)), and injured seamen. See Death on
the  High  Seas  Act,  ch.  111,  §6,  41  Stat.  537  (1920)  (codiﬁed  at  46
U.S.C.  §766  (1988));  Jones  Act,  ch.  250,  §33,  41  Stat.  1007  (1920)
(codiﬁed as amended at 46 U.S.C. §688 (1988)).

Between  1920  and  1969,  a  few  states  began  utilizing  the
principles  of  comparative  fault  in  all  tort  litigation.  Then,  between
1969 and 1984, comparative fault replaced contributory negligence in
37  additional  states.  In  1991,  South  Carolina  became  the  45th  state
leaving  Alabama,  Maryland,  North
to  adopt  comparative  fault,
Carolina, Virginia, and Tennessee as the only remaining common law

contributory  negligence  jurisdictions  [in  addition  to  the  District  of
Columbia].

Eleven  states  have  judicially  adopted  comparative  fault.1  Thirty-

four states have legislatively adopted comparative fault.2

We  recognize  that  this  action  could  be  taken  by  our  General
Assembly.  However,  legislative  inaction  has  never  prevented  judicial
abolition  of  obsolete  common  law  doctrines,  especially  those,  such
as  contributory  negligence,  conceived  in  the  judicial  womb.  Indeed,
our  abstinence  would  sanction  “a  mutual  state  of  inaction  in  which
the  court  awaits  action  by  the  legislature  and  the  legislature  awaits
guidance  from  the  court,”  Alvis  v.  Ribar,  421  N.E.2d  886,  896  (Ill.
1981), thereby prejudicing the equitable resolution of legal conflicts.

Nor do we today abandon our commitment to stare decisis. While
“conﬁdence  in  our  courts  is  to  a  great  extent  dependent  on  the
uniformity and consistency engendered by allegiance to stare decisis,
mindless obedience to this precept can confound the truth and foster
an attitude of contempt.” Hanover, 809 S.W.2d at 898.

Two  basic  forms  of  comparative  fault  are  utilized  by  45  of  our
sister  jurisdictions,  these  variants  being  commonly  referred  to  as
either “pure” or “modiﬁed.” In the “pure” form, a plaintiff’s damages are
reduced in proportion to the percentage negligence attributed to him;
for  example,  a  plaintiff  responsible  for  90  percent  of  the  negligence
that  caused  his  injuries  nevertheless  may  recover  10  percent  of  his
damages.  In  the  “modiﬁed”  form,  plaintiffs  recover  as  in  pure
jurisdictions,  but  only  if  the  plaintiff’s  negligence  either  (1)  does  not
exceed  (“50  percent”  jurisdictions)  or  (2)  is  less  than  (“49  percent”
jurisdictions) the defendant’s negligence.

In Practice

accidents) where the plaintiff

not  agree  that  a  party  should
necessarily  be  able  to  recover

have  been  criticized  as  merely  shifting  the  arbitrary  contributory
negligence  bar  to  a  new  ground.  See,  e.g., Li  v. Yellow Cab Co.,  532
P.2d 1226 (Cal. 1975) [adopting pure comparative fault]. However, we
feel  the  “49  percent  rule”  ameliorates  the  harshness  of  the  common
law  rule  while  remaining  compatible  with  a  fault-based  tort  system.
We therefore hold that so long as a plaintiff’s negligence remains less
than  the  defendant’s  negligence  the  plaintiff  may  recover;  in  such  a
case,  plaintiff’s  damages  are  to  be  reduced  in  proportion  to  the
percentage of the total negligence attributable to the plaintiff.

In  all  trials  where  the  issue  of  comparative  fault  is  before  a  jury,
the trial court shall instruct the jury on the effect of the jury’s ﬁnding
as  to  the  percentage  of  negligence  as  between  the  plaintiff  or
plaintiffs  and  the  defendant  or  defendants.  The  attorneys  for  each
party  shall  be  allowed  to  argue  how  this  instruction  affects  a
plaintiff’s ability to recover.

Turning  to  the  case  at  bar,  the  jury  found  that  “the  plaintiff  and
defendant  [were]  equally  at  fault.”  Because  the  jury,  without  the
beneﬁt  of  proper  instructions  by  the  trial  court,  made  a  gratuitous
apportionment of fault, we ﬁnd that their “equal” apportionment is not
sufﬁciently  trustworthy  to  form  the  basis  of  a  ﬁnal  determination
between these parties. Therefore, the case is remanded for a new trial
in accordance with the dictates of this opinion.

We  recognize  that  today’s  decision  affects  numerous

legal
principles  surrounding  tort  litigation.  For  the  most  part,  harmonizing
these principles with comparative fault must await another day.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

than  yes  and  no  answers.

1. Principled  Reform.   The  Balentine  decision  does  a  good  job  of
summarizing  the  transformation  of  the  vast  majority  of  jurisdictions
to  some  form  of  comparative  fault.  The  court  refers  to  four  primary
reasons  behind  the  old  contributory  negligence  rule:  (1)  that  courts
used  to  deal  exclusively  in  black  and  white,  “yes  or  no”  jury  verdicts;
(2) that negligent plaintiffs must be punished; (3) that plaintiffs must
be  deterred  from  misconduct;  and  (4)  that  the  plaintiff’s  negligence
supersedes a defendant’s prior act of negligence and, as a matter of
law,  negates  proximate  causation.  Other  changes  in  tort  law  have
shown that both courts and juries can thrive in systems that permit
something  other
In  Chapter  9,
Apportionment,  for  example,  we  will  explore  a  related  change  from
joint and several liability to several liability that similarly invites more
nuanced jury ﬁndings in determining the tortfeasors’ fault. And while
it  is  true  that  a  plaintiff’s  negligent  conduct  that  contributes  to  their
harm  cannot  be  ignored  (or  else  principles  of  punishment  and
deterrence  are  rendered  impotent),  lawmakers  have  recognized  that
the problem with contributory negligence is that it completely ignores
the  fault  of  the  defendant  and  provides  a  windfall  to  that  bad  actor.
Finally,  as  you  should  appreciate  from  the  facts  in  Balentine,  it  is

label  the  plaintiff’s  misconduct  as
“superseding”  because  the  plaintiff’s  conduct  might  be  quite
foreseeable — as was the plaintiff’s careless horse riding in Butterfield
and  the  plaintiff’s  failure  to  take  appropriate  corrective  actions  in
Meadows.  Do  you  also  see  how  relying  upon  proximate  cause

incorrect  to

doctrines to account for a plaintiff’s negligence would just be another
“all-or-nothing” approach?

Principles
One scholar observed that most
courts adopting comparative
fault have chosen the “pure”
system over a “modiﬁed”
system because only pure
comparative fault directly and
completely ties the
consequences of one’s
negligence to the jury’s
allocation of responsibility for
the harm. By contrast,
legislatures have tended to
choose a modiﬁed form as a
compromise between the
perceived extremes of
contributory negligence and
pure comparative fault. For a
good discussion of the reform
movement away from the
traditional system of
contributory negligence, see

Reasonable Tort Reform:

Comparative Negligence, 40

Mitigation
Doctrines  Under  Contributory
Negligence.
Under
contributory  negligence,  many
jurisdictions  sometimes
felt
discomfort  with  eliminating  all
recovery  by  the  plaintiff
in
certain  situations  despite  the
plaintiff’s  negligence.  One  of
these  mentioned  in  Balentine
was  the  doctrine  of  last  clear
chance;  this  doctrine  declared
that  even  if  a  plaintiff’s  own
fault  placed  the  plaintiff  in  a
situation  of  peril,  this  could  be
ignored  if  the  defendant  had  a
chance  to  avoid  causing  the
accident  and  failed  to  do  so
through  its  own  misconduct.
The  last clear  chance  doctrine
applied  when  the  defendant

necessary under modern comparative fault systems because of their
rejection  of  the  harsh  all-or-nothing  consequences.  Instead,  the  jury
considers all of these circumstances in apportioning fault among the
parties.

3.  Problems.  Different  Types  of  Comparative  Fault  Statutes.   The
following  are  examples  of  statutes  from  states  that  have  moved
away  from  contributory  negligence  by  legislative  action.  Which
system  of  comparative  fault  is  adopted  by  each  of  the  following
statutes? Imagine a case where the plaintiff has suffered $100,000 in
harm.  With  respect  to  the  jury’s  allocation  of  fault  set  forth  in  the
table  below,  what  result  is  reached  in  each  of  these  three  states?
What result in a contributory negligence state? Practice by ﬁlling out
the table.

A. New York. In any action to recover damages for personal injury,
injury  to  property,  or  wrongful  death,  the  culpable  conduct
attributable  to  the  claimant  or  to  the  decedent,  including
contributory negligence or assumption of the risk, shall not bar
recovery,  but  the  amount  of  damages  otherwise  recoverable
shall be diminished in the proportion which the culpable conduct
attributable  to  the  claimant  or  decedent  bears  to  the  culpable
conduct  which  caused  the  damages.  (New  York’s  McKinney’s
Civ. Prac. Law §1411 (1976))

B. Colorado. Contributory negligence shall not bar recovery in any
action  by  any  person  or  his  legal  representative  to  recover
damages for negligence resulting in death or in injury to person
or  property,  if  such  negligence  was  not  as  great  as  the
negligence of the person against whom recovery is sought, but
any  damages  allowed  shall  be  diminished  in  proportion  to  the
amount  of  negligence  attributable  to  the  person  for  whose

injury, damage, or death recovery is made. (Colo. Rev. Stat. §13-
21-111 (2009))

C. Wisconsin. Contributory negligence does not bar recovery in an
action  by  any  person  or  the  person’s  legal  representative  to
recover damages for negligence resulting in death or in injury to
person  or  property,  if  that  negligence  was  not  greater  than  the
negligence of the person against whom recovery is sought, but
any  damages  allowed  shall  be  diminished  in  the  proportion  to
the  amount  of  negligence  attributed  to  the  person  recovering.

2. The Apportionment Problem

that  have  rejected

the  all-or-nothing  approach  of
In  states
contributory negligence and adopted a form of comparative fault, the
issue  becomes  how  exactly  is  the  jury  supposed  to  decide  the
percentages  of  fault  or  responsibility?  Is  it  a  function  of  comparing

the reprehensibility of each party’s misconduct; or should the jury be
apportioning  the  causal  role  that  each  party’s  conduct  played  in
bringing  about  the  plaintiff’s  injury?  In  other  words,  is  the  jury
comparing  how  negligent  each  of  the  parties  was,  or  is  the  jury
deciding  which  party’s  negligence  played  a  greater  causal  role  in
bringing about the accident? This problem has been exacerbated by
the  law’s  development  of  a  strict  liability  theory  of  recovery  in
defective products cases — a so-called “liability without fault.” (We will
be  exploring  strict  liability  and  products  liability  in  Chapters  10  and
11.)  Because  many  states  adopting  products  liability  recognize
comparative negligence as an afﬁrmative defense in such cases, how
can  the  jury  apportion  “fault”  between  the  parties  or  compare  the
relative  fault  between  the  parties  and  the  defective  product?  The
following  case  illustrates  a  mainstream  approach  to  the  problem  of
how  juries  should  play  the  blame  game  necessitated  by  states’
adoption of various forms of comparative fault.

SANDFORD v. CHEVROLET
642 P.2d 624 (Or. 1982)

was  driving  overturned  and  caught  ﬁre.  She  brought  an  action  for
damages  against  a  number  of  defendants  in  which  she  alleged,
among other things, that the accident was caused by a defective tire

by  The  Tire  Factory.  The  defendants  ﬁled  answers  alleging  that

injuries.  The

The  Court  of  Appeals  reversed.  We  allowed  review  in  this
case . . . primarily to decide whether and how the proportionate fault
law  applies  when  a  dangerously  defective  product  and  a  plaintiff’s
negligence together resulted in the plaintiff’s injuries.

[The Court ﬁrst held that a plaintiff’s ordinary negligence could be
considered  as  an  afﬁrmative  defense  even  in  a  case  brought  on  the
basis of strict products liability rather than negligent conduct by the
defendants.]

[The other] problem posed by the [comparative fault] statute is the
question  exactly  what
in  determining  the
is  to  be  assessed
“percentage of fault attributable to the person” seeking recovery, and
whether  that  person’s  fault  was  “greater  than  the  combined  fault  of
the person or persons against whom recovery is sought.”

[We  must  observe  at  the  outset,  that  some  commentators
consider it futile to attempt to explain what is to be compared, rather]
“one must simply close one’s eyes and accomplish the task.” 10 Ind.
L.  Rev.  796,  806-808.  The  opinion  in  [Pan-Alaska  Fisheries,  Inc.  v.
Marine Const. &  Design Co.,  565  F.2d  1129  (9th  Cir.  1977),  similarly
questions the signiﬁcance of theoretical distinctions when it states:

In  any  event,  whether  we  use  the  term  comparative  fault,  contributory
negligence,  comparative  causation,  or  even  comparative  blameworthiness,  we
are merely beating around the semantical bush seeking to achieve an equitable
method of allocating the responsibility for an injury or loss.

565  F.2d  at  1139.  In  part  this  view  rests  on  the  assumption  that
rational  analysis  in  tort  cases  dissolves  in  the  collegial  judgment  of
juries.  That  is  probably  an  unwarranted  generalization;  ability  and
effort to decide in accordance with law can be expected to differ from
one  jury  to  the  next  with  such  variables  as  the  makeup  of  the
particular  jury,  with  the  quality  of  evidence  and  advocacy,  and  not
least with the rationality of the legal formulations in which the court
explains the jury’s task to it.

jury.  Trial

In any event, the assumption does not let us escape the need to
state coherent rules of liability. Some tort cases are tried to the court
judges  must  know  on  what  ﬁndings  an
without  a
apportionment  of  damages  depends,  whether  these  are  to  be  made
by  the  judge  or  by  a  jury.  Our  system  of  appeal  as  well  as  trial
predicates that jurors will conscientiously attempt to apply the law if
it  is  explained  in  comprehensible  terms.  A  juror  who  wants  to  know
how  to  treat  cause  and  how  to  treat  fault  is  entitled  to  an  answer,
whatever  comes  of  it  in  a  collective  decision.  Counsel  need  to  know
whether to address the relative gravity of the parties’ fault or to seek
expert  testimony  on  the  relative  impact  of  their  respective  fault  in
causing  the  asserted  harm.  We  cannot  dismiss  the  question  as  a
distinction  without  a  difference].  The  question  has  puzzled
commentators as well as courts. At least three views are possible.

A. QUANTIFYING “FAULT”

The  ﬁrst  is  that  the  formula  calls  upon  the  factﬁnder  to  assess  the
relative  magnitude  of  the  parties’  respective  “fault.”  As  stated  by  a
leading  textbook  on  these  laws:  “The  process  is  not  allocation  of
physical  causation,  but  rather  of  allocating  fault,  which  cannot  be
scientiﬁcally  measured.”  Schwartz,  Comparative  Negligence  276
(1974).  It  has  been  recognized  that  fault  is  an  evaluation  that  does
not  lend  itself  to  quantiﬁcation,  so  that  a  comparison  of  fault
magniﬁes  the  subjective  elements  already  intrinsic  to  the  ordinary
judgment of negligence. This is true even in assigning proportions to
two  or  more  distinct  types  of  negligence,  but  critics  have  found  a
greater  theoretical  obstacle  when  the  responsibility  of  one  party  is
grounded  in  fault  other  than  negligence,  or  in  no  fault  at  all.  The
obstacle  is  greater  where  strict  products  liability  is  explained  as  a
device  for  spreading  losses  from  economic  activity  regardless  of
fault.  .  .  .  Whether  the  “fault”  in  products  liability  inheres  in  the
defective  product  or  in  the  act  of  placing  it  on  the  market,  however,

difﬁculties  of  comparison  with  the  injured  party’s  fault  undeniably
remain.

B. “COMPARATIVE CAUSATION”

Some  courts,  applying  comparative  negligence  law  have  tried  to
escape  the  difﬁculty  by  stating  that  the  allocation  of  damages  is  to
reflect  relative  causation,  that  is  to  say,  an  assessment  of  the
proportion in which the plaintiff’s injuries were caused by the product
defect on the one hand and by plaintiff’s own negligence on the other.
See,  e.g.,  Murray  v.  Fairbanks  Morse,  610  F.2d  149  (3d  Cir.  1979)
(applying  Virgin  Island  comparative  negligence  statute);  Pan-Alaska
They have done so in the belief that this is conceptually more logical
or pragmatically easier than to compare the defect of a product with
the negligence of one whom it has injured. With due respect to these
courts,  however,  we  are  not  persuaded  that  the  concept  of
is  more  cogent  or  meaningful  than
“comparative  causation”
comparative  fault,  if  by  “causation”  is  meant  some  relation  of  cause
and  effect  in  the  physical  world  rather  than  the  very  attribution  of
responsibility for which “causation” is to serve as the premise.

[In this case,] both the defect and the plaintiff’s fault must in fact
be  causes  of  one  injury  before  a  question  of  apportionment  of  fault
arises.  Although  defendants  in  this  case  had  completed  all  acts
necessary  for  liability  when  they  manufactured  and  mounted  a
dangerously  defective  tire  that  might  blow  out  and  overturn  the
Sandford  pickup,  they  obviously  would  not  be  liable  if  the  pickup
overturned  for  some  unrelated  reason.  Similarly,  it  would  not  matter
that a driver operated his car unlawfully or recklessly if he was injured
by an explosion due to an electrical defect that would have occurred
with  the  same  harmful  consequences  if  the  car  had  been  standing
still. In less obvious situations where the physical course of events is
in doubt, if either party convinces the factﬁnder that its misconduct in

fact was not a cause of the injury, there is no occasion for allocating
partial damages.

The  concept  of  apportioning  causation  must  be  tested  on  the
assumption  that  both  causes  had  to  join  to  produce  the  injury  for
which damages are to be allocated. Once it is assumed, however, that
two  or  more  distinct  causes  had  to  occur  to  produce  an  indivisible
injury, we doubt that the purpose of the proportional fault concept is
to  subject  the  combined  causation  to  some  kind  of  vector  analysis,
even  in  the  rare  case  of  simultaneous,  physically  commensurable
forces. In most cases, it would be a vain exercise.

C. MIXING “FAULT” WITH “PROXIMATE” CAUSATION

The  National  Conference  of  Commissioners  on  Uniform  State  Laws
attempted to overcome the distinction, or perhaps split the difference,
in  a  proposed  Uniform  Comparative  Fault  Act,  by  calling  on  the
factﬁnder,  in  determining  the  percentages  of  fault,  to  “consider  both
the nature of the conduct of each party at fault and the extent of the
causal relation between the conduct and the damages claimed.” See
Wade,  Products  Liability  and  Plaintiff’s  Fault — The  Uniform
Comparative Fault Act,  29  Mercer  L  Rev  373  (1978).  This  might  add
the difﬁculties of comparing causation to those of comparing fault if
causation  in  fact  were  meant,  especially  since  the  act  also  calls  for
special  ﬁndings.  But  the  comments  indicate  that  “the  extent  of  the
causal  relation”  does  not  mean  causation  in  fact  but  what  has
traditionally been labeled “proximate cause.”

[In  terms  of  which  method  this  Court  is  to  apply,  our  governing
statute,]  Proportionate  fault  under  ORS  18.470.  ORS  18.470,  by  its
terms  applies  whenever  “the  fault  attributable  to  the  person  seeking
recovery  was  not  greater  than  the  combined  fault  of  the  person  or
persons  against  whom  recovery  is  sought.”  If  there  was  such  fault,
“any  damages  allowed  shall  be  diminished  in  the  proportion  to  the
percentage of fault attributable to the person recovering.” There is no

reference to causation, or to any question how much the fault of each
contributed  to  the  injury.  We  do  not  mean  that  the  allegedly  faulty
conduct  or  condition  need  not  have  affected  the  event  for  which
recovery  is  sought;  as  we  have  said,  it  must  have  been  a  cause  in
fact.  But  the  statute  does  not  call  for  apportioning  damages  by
quantifying the contribution of several causes that had to coincide to
produce the injury.

Rather,  ORS  18.470  falls  within  the  ﬁrst  of  the  different
approaches  that  we  have  reviewed.  It  calls  upon  the  factﬁnder  to
assess  and  quantify  fault.  [This  statute  makes  no  mention  of
comparing  causation.]  If  the  plaintiff’s  conduct  is  not  faultless,  the
assessment has two purposes: To determine whether her fault is “not
greater  than”  that  of  defendants,  and  if  it  is  not,  then  to  reduce  the
plaintiff’s recovery of damages “in the proportion to the percentage of
fault attributable to” the plaintiff.

[I]f  the  plaintiff’s  behavior  which  was  one  cause  of  the  injury  is
alleged  to  have  been  negligent  or  otherwise  “fault,”  it  is  to  be
measured against behavior that would have been faultless under the
circumstances. The factﬁnder is to determine the degree to which the
plaintiff’s behavior fell short of that norm and express this deﬁcit as a
is  applied  to  diminish  the
numerical  percentage,  which  then
recoverable  damages.  There  necessarily  must  be  some  comparable
assessment  of  the  fault  attributable  to  defendants  as  a  departure
from the norm invoked against them (which, in products liability, will
involve  the  magnitude  of  the  defect  rather  than  negligence  or  moral
“blameworthiness”)  in  order  to  determine  which  is  greater.  In  this
comparison,  the  benchmark  for  assessing  a  defendant’s  fault  for
marketing  a  product  which  is  dangerously  defective  in  design,
manufacture,  or  warning  is  what  the  product  should  have  been
without the defect. The benchmark for the injured claimant’s fault is
conduct  which  would  not  be  unlawful  or  careless  in  any  relevant
respect.  This  corresponds  to  views  expressed  by  the  Supreme
Judicial Court of Maine:

[A]pportionment is on the basis of fault or blame. This involves a comparison of
the  culpability  of  the  parties,  meaning  by  culpability  not  moral  blame  but  the
degree  of  departure  from  the  standard  of  a  reasonable  man.  [C]omparison  is
invited  between  degrees  of  fault  which  may  range  from  trivial  inadvertence  to
the  grossest  recklessness.  In  judging  the  conduct  of  an  actor  it  should  be
considered  complete  carefulness  is  at  one  end,  a  deliberate  intention  to  bring
about the result is at the other. Negligence ranges from the least blameworthy
type, namely, inadvertence and negligent errors of judgment up to a state where
knowledge  or  more  complete  knowledge  supervenes  and  the  negligence  of
obstinacy, self-righteousness or reckless is reached. The factﬁnder must be told
then  under  our  statute,
it  should  give  consideration  to  the  relative
blameworthiness of the causative fault of the claimant and of the defendant.

Wing v. Morse, 300 A.2d 491, 500 (Me. 1973).

Accordingly,  after  determining  whether  and  how  far  each  party’s
conduct  was  at  fault,  measured  against  the  norm  governing  that
party’s conduct, these respective degrees of fault are to be converted
into a percentage which will be applied to the plaintiff’s total damages
to determine his actual recovery.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. The  Choice  of  Apportionment  Theories.   Although  the  Sandford
court  acknowledges  that  the  precise  formula  for  apportioning
responsibility  may  not  matter  to  a  real  jury,  it  reafﬁrms  that  this  is
more than a question of semantics. In bench trials, the judge needs to
know what it is she is apportioning, and appellate courts, in reviewing
the sufﬁciency of evidence, need to know what it is they are looking
for  in  the  evidence.  And  juries,  attempting  their  best  to  listen  to  the
court’s  instructions  and  the  arguments  of  counsel,  need  to  have
some basis upon which to act. In short, the issue matters in the real
world  where  juries  are  frequently  asked  to  apportion  between  the
claimant  and  the  defendant.  The  Sandford  court  embraces  the  idea
of comparing the blameworthiness of the parties (or product), in part,

because comparing the causal role makes no sense when actual “but
for” cause demands that the parties’ conduct (or product) played an
essential role in order to create liability in the ﬁrst instance.

2. Third  Restatement  View.   Section  8  of  the  Restatement  (Third)
of  Torts  (2000)  appears  to  advocate  for  option  three,  mixing  the
concepts of fault and comparative proximate causation:

Factors for Assigning Shares of Responsibility

Factors  for  assigning  percentages  of  responsibility  to  each

person whose legal responsibility has been established include:

(a)  the  nature  of  the  person’s  risk-creating  conduct,
including  any  awareness  or  indifference  with  respect  to  the
risks  created  by  the  conduct  and  any  intent  with  respect  to
the harm created by the conduct; and

(b)  the  strength  of  the  causal  connection  between  the

person’s risk-creating conduct and the harm.

3.  Problems.   Utilizing  the  foregoing  view  from  the  Third
Restatement  on  apportioning  fault,  where  both  fault  and  relative
proximate  cause  are  considered,  how  would  you  argue  the
apportionment  question  to  the  jury  as  an  advocate  for  both  the
plaintiff and the defendant in the following scenarios?

A. The custodian at a law school was tired one evening and failed
to clean up a puddle of coffee that had spilled on the tile floor in
the hallway. Plaintiff, a law student, is rushing to get to her torts
class the next morning and is literally running around the corner
of the hallway when her foot hits the puddle. She slips and falls,
breaking  her  wrist.  Plaintiff  sues  the  school  on  a  premises
liability  claim.  The  school  contends  she  fell  so  violently  only
because she was running around a blind corner.

B.  Defendant  supplies  barrels  of  flammable  chemicals  to  Plaintiff
corporation. Defendant failed to inspect the barrels on a recent

shipment  and,  therefore,  did  not  notice  one  of  the  barrels  was
leaking  dangerous  vapors  into  the  air.  After  its  delivery,  one  of
Plaintiff’s employees decided (against company policy) to light a
cigarette  in  the  chemical  storage  room  where  the  barrels  were
kept. The vapors exploded, causing massive property damage to
Plaintiff’s building and inventory.

3. Multiple Tortfeasors in Modiﬁed Comparative Fault

issue  arises

The  other  apportionment-related
in  modiﬁed
comparative fault jurisdictions — those of either the 49 percent or 50
percent varieties. The statutes are quite clear that the plaintiff’s fault
must  be  compared  to  that  of  the  person  against  whom  judgment  is
sought in order to determine if it is no greater than (50 percent rule)
or less than (49 percent rule) the defendant’s fault. But how does this
comparison  work  in  a  case  with  multiple  tortfeasor  defendants?
Should the comparison be made multiple times, between the plaintiff
and each single defendant? Or should the fault of the defendants be
lumped  together  and  then,  as  a  unit,  compared  with  that  of  the
plaintiff? That issue is dealt with head on in the following case.

BEAUDOIN v. TEXACO, INC.
653 F. Supp. 512 (D.N.D. 1987)

          , J.

A collision of legal principles renders a truly equitable result in this
case impossible. The difﬁcult decision confronting this court is which
inequitable result is most proper.

Mark  Beaudoin,  the  plaintiff,  was  an  employee  of  Wood  Wireline.
Texaco,  Inc.,  the  defendant,  hired  Wireline  to  conduct  a  pressure

gradient  check  on  Texaco’s  well,  CM  Loomer  #13  near  Keene,  North
Dakota.

Beaudoin  and  a  co-worker  arrived  on  the  unlighted  site  before
dawn  on  February  21,  1983,  to  prepare  their  equipment  for  the  job.
Beaudoin  was  uncoiling  wire  from  a  large  spool  mounted  on  the
wireline rig when he was struck in the left eye by the end of the wire.
He is now legally blind in that eye.

Texaco’s employee John Spain arrived after the incident occurred

to supervise the work being done on the site.

On  March  29,  1985,  Beaudoin  brought  an  action  for  damages
against  Texaco.  Beaudoin  alleged  that  the  injury  was  the  result  of
Texaco’s  negligence  in  requiring  the  work  to  commence  at  an  hour
that would require the equipment to be set up in darkness, in failing to
provide  proper  lighting,  and  in  failing  to  properly  supervise  the  work.
Texaco alleged that the injury was the result of Beaudoin’s negligence
in  handling  the  wire  carelessly.  Both  parties  denied  the  negligence
alleged  against  them.  Testimony  was  presented  at  trial  that  could
have led to the conclusion that Wood Wireline was negligent in failing
to  provide  proper  equipment  and  training  for  its  employees.  Wood
Wireline  is  immune  from  liability  under  the  provisions  of  North
Dakota’s  worker’s  compensation  law,  NDCC  §65-04-28,  and  is  not  a
defendant in the action.

The  jury  found  damages  of  $44,057.04,  and  apportioned  the
negligence causing the injury as follows: 60% to Wood Wireline, 30%
to  Beaudoin,  and  10%  to  Texaco.  This  court  must  now  determine
what judgment results from this verdict.

That  determination  depends  on  the  proper  interpretation  and

application of North Dakota’s comparative negligence statute.

Contributory negligence shall not bar recovery in an action by any person or his
legal representative to recover damages for negligence resulting in death or in
injury  to  person  or  property,  if  such  negligence  was  not  as  great  as  the
negligence  of  the  person  against  whom  recovery  is  sought,  but  any  damages
allowed  shall  be  diminished  in  proportion  to  the  amount  of  negligence

attributable  to  the  person  recovering.  .  .  .  Upon  the  request  of  any  party,  this
section shall be read by the court to the jury and the attorneys representing the
parties may comment to the jury regarding this section.

NDCC §9-10-07.

The  narrow  question  before  this  court  is  whether  in  cases
involving a negligent plaintiff and more than one other negligent actor
this  statute  allows  recovery  only  against  those  defendants  more
negligent than the plaintiff or against all negligent defendants so long
as  the  plaintiff’s  negligence  is  less  than  the  combined  negligence  of
the other negligent actors. The North Dakota Supreme Court has not
ruled on this issue, and the other jurisdictions are divided.

This court must ﬁrst determine how a federal district court sitting
with  diversity  jurisdiction  should  properly  approach  resolving  a  legal
issue  not  yet  settled  by  the  highest  court  of  the  law-determining
state.

This court will not presume to divine the thinking or inclinations of
the  justices  of  the  North  Dakota  Supreme  Court,  but  will  attempt  to
examine  and  weigh  the  persuasive  authority  as  that  court  would  if
this issue were before it. Those sources include the case law of sister
states, the case law of the other states, the majority rule and modern
trend  if  there  are  such,  and  principles  of  justice  and  equity.  It  is  the
opinion  of  this  court  that  there  is  no  conflict  between  the  goal  of
seeking  the  best  legal  conclusion  and  the  goal  of  seeking  the
conclusion that the North Dakota Supreme Court would reach.

As  the  states  have  abandoned  the  harsh  and  outdated  rule  of
contributory negligence they have replaced it with one of two general
types  of  comparative  negligence.  A  number  of  jurisdictions  have
adopted “pure” comparative negligence. Under this rule, every party is
liable  for  its  own  share  of  the  negligence.  If,  for  example,  a  plaintiff
bears 60% of the responsibility for the injuries he has suffered, he will
bear  60%  of  the  cost,  while  the  negligent  defendant  whose
responsibility  is  40%  will  be  liable  for  40%  of  the  cost.  Other

jurisdictions,  including  North  Dakota,  have  opted  for  a  system  of
“modiﬁed” comparative negligence. These systems vary in detail, but
all  prohibit  a  plaintiff  who  is  assigned  more  than  50%  of  the  causal
negligence  from  recovering  any  damages.  Following  this  approach
the  40%  negligent  defendant  in  the  example  above  would  be
completely  free  from  any  liability.  Whatever  the  merits  of  the  policy
reasons  for  the  adoption  of  modiﬁed  comparative  negligence,  such
systems  lead  to  a  number  of  unavoidable  complications,  one  of
which confronts this court today.

Modiﬁed  comparative  negligence  jurisdictions  follow  one  of  two
rules  for  determining  the  damage  award  in  cases  with  multiple
tortfeasors  at  least  one  of  which  is  less  negligent  than  the  plaintiff:
the “Wisconsin rule” and the “unit rule.” Under the Wisconsin rule the
plaintiff’s  share  of  the  negligence  is  compared  in  turn  with  the
negligence  apportioned  to  each  individual  defendant.  Any  defendant
whose percentage of the negligence is lower than, or, in North Dakota,
equal to, the plaintiff’s, is dismissed from the case. Under the unit rule
the plaintiff’s share of the negligence is compared to the sum of the
shares of negligence apportioned to the other negligent actors. If the
plaintiff’s  share  is  less  than  that  sum,  then  the  plaintiff  can  recover
from  each  of  the  defendants.  This  court  must  determine  which  of
these  rules  should,  from  the  perspective  of  the  North  Dakota
Supreme Court, be applied in this case.

Minnesota  follows,  and  Wisconsin  initiated,  the  Wisconsin  rule.
Marier v. Memorial Rescue Service, Inc., 296 Minn. 242, 207 N.W.2d
706, 707, 708 (1973), Walker v. Kroger Grocery & Baking Co., 214 Wis.
519,  252  N.W.  721,  727,  728  (1934).  Absent  any  countervailing
considerations,  that  rule  should  be  applied  in  this  case.  There  are,
however, a number of countervailing considerations.

The Wisconsin rule is the minority rule. This court has discovered
fourteen  states  that  follow  the  unit  rule,  but  only  six  that  follow  the
Wisconsin rule.

The unit rule is the modern trend. Of the six Wisconsin rule states,
four adopted the rule ten or more years ago. Seven states have had to
choose  between  the  alternative  rules  in  the  last  ﬁve  years,  and  all
seven have chosen the unit rule.

It  is  evident  that  the  weight  of  authority  is  heavily  in  favor  of  the
unit  rule.  Furthermore,  even  the  states  that  have  adopted  the
Wisconsin  rule  do  not  appear  to  strongly  support  it.  None  of  the  six
opinions  in  which  state  high  courts  chose  the  Wisconsin  rule  was
based  on  arguments  supporting  the  rule  on  its  merits.  As  the  Utah
Supreme Court observed, “almost without variation, those states that
have adopted the Wisconsin rule have done so on the rather wooden
analysis  that  the  Legislature  must  have  intended  to  adopt  the  court
decisions  construing  the  Wisconsin  statute  as  a  part  of  that  state’s
law.”  679  P.2d  at  909.  This  approach,  based  only  on  a  canon  of
statutory construction, has been thoroughly repudiated. See, e.g., 642
P.2d  at  632,  679  P.2d  at  905,  624  P.2d  at  388-394  (Bistline,  J.,
dissenting). Sufﬁce to say that, as discussed above, the North Dakota
Supreme Court gives serious consideration to the judicial gloss of the
source  state  of  a  statute,  but  does  not  abdicate  its  judicial  and
intellectual responsibilities in doing so. Following the supreme court’s
approach,  the  fact  that  North  Dakota  derived  §9-10-07  from
Wisconsin  by  way  of  Minnesota  creates  a  presumption  in  favor  of
Wisconsin case law, but it does not settle the question without further
inquiry.

The  other  argument  generally  relied  on  by  courts  adopting  the
Wisconsin rule is that their comparative negligence statute is phrased
in  terms  of  a  single  defendant,  as  is  North  Dakota’s:  “if  such
negligence was not as great as the negligence of the person against
whom recovery is sought. . . . ” NDCC §9-10-07. The Code contains a
provision aimed at preventing this kind of misplaced reliance. “Words
used in the singular number include the plural and words used in the
plural  number  include  the  singular,  except  when  a  contrary  intention
plainly  appears.”  NDCC  §1-01-35.  The  intention  appearing  from  the

text  of  §9-10-07  is,  of  course,  not  plain.  It  is  not  clear  whether  the
legislature  intended  to  excuse  all  defendants  whose  negligence  is
less than the plaintiff’s or to limit recovery only to those plaintiffs who
bear less than half the fault for their own injuries. In the absence of a
plain  meaning  of  §9-10-07’s  text,  §1-01-35  becomes  operative,  and
the  term  “person”  in  §9-10-07  must  be  taken  to  include  both  the
singular and the plural. This statutorily mandated rule of construction
requires the adoption of the unit rule, as it aggregates the negligence
of the other parties at fault for comparison with the negligence of the
plaintiff.

Perhaps the most telling strike against the Wisconsin rule is that it

is no longer supported by the Wisconsin Supreme Court.

This  case  is  one  of  many  cases  which  have  come  before  this  court  involving
multiple party tortfeasors. . . . The majority of the court has become convinced
that  comparing  the  negligence  of  the  individual  plaintiff  to  that  of  each
individual  tortfeasor — rather  than  comparing  the  negligence  of  the  individual
plaintiff to that of the combined negligence of the several tortfeasors who have
collectively  contributed  to  plaintiff’s
injuries — leads  to  harsh  and  unfair
results. . . .

May v. Skelley Oil Co., 83 Wis. 2d 30, 264 N.W.2d 574, 578 (1978). It
appears that at present the Wisconsin Supreme Court adheres to the
rule  because  it  considers  itself  bound  by  its  prior  holdings  and  the
state legislature’s failure to counteract them. Reiter v. Dyken, 95 Wis.
2d 461, 290 N.W.2d 510, 515-517 (1980). The North Dakota Supreme
Court is not caught in such a trap, and so those considerations do not
apply in this state.

The factors leading to the adoption of the unit rule are numerous
and  compelling.  This  court  has  considered  the  following  factors  in
weighing its decision: the unit rule is the majority rule and the modern
trend;  those  courts  that  have  most  thoroughly  reviewed  the
arguments  of  policy  and  law  have  chosen  the  unit  rule,  while  those
courts opting for the Wisconsin rule have generally done so because

of undue deference to a canon of statutory construction or misplaced
reliance on statutory phraseology; application of the unit rule in North
Dakota  is  mandated  by  §1-01-35.  Further  arguments  against  the
Wisconsin rule and in favor of the unit rule have been made. See, e.g.,
483 A.2d at 483-489, 679 P.2d at 904-909.

Following  this  approach,  this  court  concludes  that  the  North
Dakota  Supreme  Court  would  proﬁt  from  the  misfortune  of
Wisconsin,  and  avoid  placing  itself  in  the  trap  in  which  that  court
ﬁnds  itself.  This  court  is  convinced  that  the  correct  decision  is  to
apply the unit rule in this case, and that that is the decision the North
Dakota Supreme Court would reach.

Application of the unit rule in this case raises the issue of whether
“the  person  against  whom  recovery  is  sought”  includes  statutorily
immune employers who were not made parties to a suit. Other states
have reviewed this issue and determined that they are to be included.
In this case, therefore, Beaudoin’s negligence, 30%, will be compared
against the negligence of Texaco and Wireline, 70%. Since Beaudoin’s
negligence is less, he can recover.

In  North  Dakota  a  joint  tortfeasor  is  liable  for  the  share  of
negligence attributed to a statutorily immune employer. In this case,
then,  Texaco,  which  was  only  10%  contributorily  negligent,  will  be
forced  to  pay  70%  of  the  damages.  This  is  clearly  an  inequitable
result, but given the current state of the law it is unavoidable.

If  the  Wisconsin  rule  were  applied  to  the  facts  of  this  case,
Beaudoin,  who  was  only  30%  contributorily  negligent,  would  be
denied  any  recovery.  This  would  be  an  inequitable  result.  Further,  it
would  be  an  inequitable  result  imposed  by  the  operation  of  the
comparative  negligence  provision  of  §9-10-07.  The  result  actually
reached  is  also  inequitable,  but  the  inequity  is  imposed  by  the
operation  of  the  joint  and  several  liability  provision  of  §9-10-07  and
the immunity provision of §65-04-28. As was noted at the opening of
this order, it is a collision of legal principles that renders an equitable

result  in  this  case  impossible.  This  court  has  declined  to  adopt  an
outmoded  rule  that  works  inequity,  but  another  outmoded  and
inequitable  rule,  joint  and  several  liability,  still  remains  to  prevent  a
just outcome. Some states have abolished this rule as a part of their
statutory  system  of  comparative  negligence,  but  the  North  Dakota
Legislature has not yet done so. If it were to adopt a several liability
rule, then the combination of that rule and the unit rule would produce
more  nearly  equitable  results  than  can  be  achieved  if  either  the
Wisconsin rule or the joint and several liability rule is present.

Therefore it is ORDERED:

That  plaintiff  Mark  Chris  Beaudoin  shall  have  judgment  against  defendant
Texaco, Inc. in the sum of 70% of $44,057.04, that is $30,839.93, plus interest
thereon  from  the  date  of  judgment  and  costs  and  disbursements  as  taxed  by
the  clerk  and  added  to  the  judgment.  The  clerk  shall  prepare  and  enter  the
judgment.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Problem Unique to Modiﬁed Comparative Fault.  Given the jury’s
apportionment  in  the  Texaco  case,  what  would  be  the  outcome  in
each of the following jurisdictions?

A. In contributory negligence?
B. In pure comparative fault?

The dilemma the court faced in Texaco would not matter in either a
contributory  negligence  or  a  pure  comparative  fault  jurisdiction
because  no  comparison  between  (or  among)  the  claimant  and  the
defendant(s) is needed to implement the doctrine. Either the plaintiff
recovers nothing (in contributory negligence) or the plaintiff recovers
something  (in  pure  comparative  fault).  But  in  modiﬁed  comparative
fault,  the  court  must  consider  whether  any  recovery  is  permitted  in
light  of  the  plaintiff’s  apportionment.  Unfortunately,  many  of  the

modiﬁed comparative fault statutes are written in a manner similar to
the  North  Dakota  statute  in  Texaco.  That  is,  the  statutes  are  often
worded  as  if  the  only  parties  being  apportioned  fault  are  a  single
plaintiff and a single defendant. When that is not the case, the court
must  ascertain  the  appropriate  method  by  which  to  compare  fault
levels.

2.  Other  Rationales  for  Rejection  of  the  Wisconsin  Rule.   The
federal district court in Texaco alludes to other public policy reasons
for  rejecting  the  Wisconsin  rule.  One  is  based  upon  the  conceptual
math  problems.  For  example,  consider  if  a  jury  apportioned  fault  30
percent to the plaintiff, 60 percent to Defendant 1, and 10 percent to
Defendant 2. Under the Wisconsin rule, the court would ﬁrst compare
the  plaintiff’s  fault  of  30  percent  with  Defendant  1’s  fault  of  60
percent  (and  permit  recovery).  Then  the  court  would  compare
plaintiff’s  30  percent  fault  with  Defendant  2’s  10  percent  (and  reject
any  recovery  against  that  defendant).  But  all  of  this  comparison
would  involve  a  total  of  130  percent  fault  rather  than  limiting  the
universe  of  fault  to  100  percent.  The  other  problem  with  the
Wisconsin rule is more pragmatic — the more tortfeasors that cause
the plaintiff’s harm (and are included in the apportionment question)
the  more  likely  the  plaintiff  will  be  unable  to  recover.  For  example,  if
there are three defendants who contribute to the plaintiff’s injury and
the jury assesses fault against all three and plaintiff equally, they will
each be 25 percent at fault — plaintiff will be unable to recover in a 49
percent modiﬁed comparative fault state (since plaintiff’s fault is not
less  than  any  defendant).  But  if  there  was  only  one  defendant
apportioned  the  75  percent  fault,  plaintiff  could  easily  recover
something  in  a  modiﬁed  comparative  fault  state.  Courts  often  cite
these additional arguments for rejecting the Wisconsin rule.

3. Problems.  Can a Better Modiﬁed Comparative Fault Statute Be

Built?

A. Read the following statute and ask yourself whether this statute
renders  moot  the  unit  rule  vs.  Wisconsin  rule  debate.  In  other

words,  what  would  the  result  be  under  this  statute  using  the
jury’s ﬁndings from the Texaco case?

Sec. 33.001. Proportionate Responsibility. In an action to which
this chapter applies, a claimant may not recover damages if his
percentage of responsibility is greater than 50 percent.

Tex.  Civ.  Prac.  &  Rem.  Code  §33.001.  Does  this  rule  implicitly
embrace a unit rule result or a Wisconsin rule result?

B. The Oregon proportionate fault statute at issue in the Sandford
v.  Chevrolet  case  permits  a  plaintiff  to  recover  whenever  “the
fault attributable to the person seeking recovery was not greater
than the combined fault of the person or persons against whom
recovery  is  sought.”  Does  this  statute  expressly  incorporate  a
Wisconsin  rule  or  unit  rule?  Is  the  statute  more  clear  than  the
North Dakota statute in Texaco?

III  ASSUMPTION OF THE RISK

We have previously explored primary assumption of the risk — the “no
duty” doctrine that declares that a reasonable person would not make
special  efforts  to  reduce  or  eliminate  “inherent  risks”  of  certain
activities. That doctrine is not an afﬁrmative defense but a particular
way of concluding that the defendant who provided the activity was
not  negligent.  In  terms  of  true  afﬁrmative  defenses,  tort  law  has
traditionally  recognized  two  varieties  of  assumption  of  the  risk:  (a)
express assumption of the risk, where the plaintiff has promised not
to hold the defendant liable for its own negligence prior to the injury;
and (b) secondary implied assumption of the risk, where the plaintiff
has knowingly and voluntarily decided to encounter a risk previously
created by the defendant’s negligence.

A. Express Assumption of the Risk

When  a  defendant  pleads  that  the  plaintiff  has  previously  agreed  to
assume  the  risk  of  injury  due  to  the  defendant’s  negligence,  that
defendant  must  overcome  two  hurdles:  (1)  that  the  exculpatory
clause does not offend the court’s view of public policy in terms of its
enforcement,  and  (2)  that  the  clause  was  worded  with  sufﬁcient
clarity  to  release  the  defendant  from  liability  for  the  plaintiff’s  actual
injuries. We will take up these issues in that order.

1. Public Policy Hurdle

TUNKL v. REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF
CALIFORNIA

383 P.2d 441 (Cal. 1963)

        , J.

This case concerns the validity of a release from liability for future
negligence  imposed  as  a  condition  for  admission  to  a  charitable
research  hospital.  For  the  reasons  we  hereinafter  specify,  we  have
concluded  that  an  agreement  between  a  hospital  and  an  entering
patient  affects  the  public  interest  and  that,  in  consequence,  the
exculpatory  provision  included  within  it  must  be  invalid  under  Civil
Code section 1668.

Hugo  Tunkl  brought  this  action  to  recover  damages  for  personal
injuries  alleged  to  have  resulted  from  the  negligence  of  two
physicians  in  the  employ  of  the  University  of  California  Los  Angeles
Medical Center, a hospital operated and maintained by the Regents of
the  University  of  California  as  a  nonproﬁt  charitable  institution.  Mr.
Tunkl died after suit was brought, and his surviving wife, as executrix,
was substituted as plaintiff.

The  University  of  California  at  Los  Angeles  Medical  Center
admitted Tunkl as a patient on June 11, 1956. The Regents maintain
the  hospital  for  the  primary  purpose  of  aiding  and  developing  a
program of research and education in the ﬁeld of medicine; patients
are  selected  and  admitted  if  the  study  and  treatment  of  their
condition would tend to achieve these purposes. Upon his entry to the
hospital, Tunkl signed a document setting forth certain “Conditions of
Admission.” The crucial condition number six reads as follows:

Release:  The  hospital  is  a  nonproﬁt,  charitable  institution.  In  consideration  of
the  hospital  and  allied  services  to  be  rendered  and  the  rates  charged  therefor,
the  patient  or  his  legal  representative  agrees  to  and  hereby  releases  The
Regents of the University of California, and the hospital from any and all liability
for the negligent or wrongful acts or omissions of its employees, if the hospital
has used due care in selecting its employees.

Plaintiff  stipulated  that  the  hospital  had  selected  its  employees
with due care. The trial court ordered that the issue of the validity of
the  exculpatory  clause  be  ﬁrst  submitted  to  the  jury  and  that,  if  the
jury  found  that  the  provision  did  not  bind  plaintiff,  a  second  jury  try
the issue of alleged malpractice. When, on the preliminary issue, the
jury returned a verdict sustaining the validity of the executed release,
the court entered judgment in favor of the Regents.3 Plaintiff appeals
from the judgment.

In  one  respect,  as  we  have  said,  the  decisions  [regarding  the
enforceability of exculpatory provisions] are uniform. The cases have
consistently  held  that  the  exculpatory  provision  may  stand  only  if  it
does  not  involve  “the  public  interest.”6  [For  example,]  courts  struck
down exculpatory clauses as contrary to public policy in the case of a
contract  to  transmit  a  telegraph  message  (Union  Constr.  Co.  v.
Western  Union  Tel.  Co.  (1912)  125  P.  242)  and  in  the  instance  of  a
contract  of  bailment  (England  v.  Lyon  Fireproof  Storage  Co.  (1928)
271 P. 532). In Hiroshima v. Bank of Italy (1926) 248 P. 947, the court
invalidated  an  exemption  provision  in  the  form  used  by  a  payee  in
directing a bank to stop payment on a check. The court relied in part
upon  the  fact  that  “the  banking  public,  as  well  as  the  particular
individual who may be concerned in the giving of any stop-notice, is
interested in seeing that the bank is held accountable for the ordinary
and  regular  performance  of  its  duties  and,  also,  in  seeing  that
direction in relation to the disposition of funds deposited in [the] bank
are  not  heedlessly,  negligently,  and  carelessly  disobeyed  and  money
paid out, contrary to directions given.”

In  placing  particular  contracts  within  or  without  the  category  of
those affected with a public interest, the courts have revealed a rough
outline of that type of transaction in which exculpatory provisions will
be held invalid. Thus, the attempted but invalid exemption involves a
following
transaction  which  exhibits  some  or  all  of
characteristics.  It  concerns  a  business  of  a  type  generally  thought
suitable  for  public  regulation.  The  party  seeking  exculpation  is

the

engaged  in  performing  a  service  of  great  importance  to  the  public,
which  is  often  a  matter  of  practical  necessity  for  some  members  of
the  public.  The  party  holds  himself  out  as  willing  to  perform  this
service for any member of the public who seeks it, or at least for any
member  coming  within  certain  established  standards.  As  a  result  of
the  essential  nature  of  the  service,  in  the  economic  setting  of  the
transaction,  the  party  invoking  exculpation  possesses  a  decisive
advantage  of  bargaining  strength  against  any  member  of  the  public
who seeks his services. In exercising a superior bargaining power the
party  confronts  the  public  with  a  standardized  adhesion  contract  of
exculpation,  and  makes  no  provision  whereby  a  purchaser  may  pay
additional reasonable fees and obtain protection against negligence.
Finally,  as  a  result  of  the  transaction,  the  person  or  property  of  the
purchaser is placed under the control of the seller, subject to the risk
of carelessness by the seller or his agents.

While  obviously  no  public  policy  opposes  private,  voluntary
transactions  in  which  one  party,  for  a  consideration,  agrees  to
shoulder a risk which the law would otherwise have placed upon the
other  party,  the  above  circumstances  pose  a  different  situation.  In
this situation the releasing party does not really acquiesce voluntarily
in  the  contractual  shifting  of  the  risk,  nor  can  we  be  reasonably
certain  that  he  receives  an  adequate  consideration  for  the  transfer.
Since the service is one which each member of the public, presently
or  potentially,  may  ﬁnd  essential  to  him,  he  faces,  despite  his
economic inability to do so, the prospect of a compulsory assumption
of the risk of another’s negligence. The public policy of this state has
been, in substance, to posit the risk of negligence upon the actor; in
instances  in  which  this  policy  has  been  abandoned,  it  has  generally
been  to  allow  or  require  that  the  risk  shift  to  another  party  better  or
equally able to bear it, not to shift the risk to the weak bargainer.

In  the  light  of  the  decisions,  we  think  that  the  hospital-patient
contract clearly falls within the category of agreements affecting the
public  interest.  To  meet  that  test,  the  agreement  need  only  fulﬁll

some  of  the  characteristics  above  outlined;  here,  the  relationship
fulﬁlls  all  of  them.  Thus,  the  contract  of  exculpation  involves  an
institution  suitable  for,  and  a  subject  of,  public  regulation.  That  the
services  of  the  hospital  to  those  members  of  the  public  who  are  in
special need of the particular skill of its staff and facilities constitute
a practical and crucial necessity is hardly open to question.

The  hospital,  likewise,  holds  itself  out  as  willing  to  perform  its
services for those members of the public who qualify for its research
and training facilities. While it is true that the hospital is selective as
to  the  patients  it  will  accept,  such  selectivity  does  not  negate  its
public aspect or the public interest in it. The hospital is selective only
in the sense that it accepts from the public at large certain  types  of
cases  which  qualify  for  the  research  and  training  in  which  it
specializes.  But  the  hospital  does  hold  itself  out  to  the  public  as  an
institution  which  performs  such  services  for  those  members  of  the
public who can qualify for them.

In  insisting  that  the  patient  accept  the  provision  of  waiver  in  the
contract,  the  hospital  certainly  exercises  a  decisive  advantage  in
bargaining.  The  would-be  patient  is  in  no  position  to  reject  the
proffered  agreement,  to  bargain  with  the  hospital,  or  in  lieu  of
agreement to ﬁnd another hospital. The admission room of a hospital
contains  no  bargaining  table  where,  as
in  a  private  business
transaction,  the  parties  can  debate  the  terms  of  their  contract.  As  a
instant  agreement
result,  we  cannot  but  conclude  that  the
manifested  the  characteristics  of  the  so-called  adhesion  contract.
Finally,  when  the  patient  signed  the  contract,  he  completely  placed
himself in the control of the hospital; he subjected himself to the risk
of its carelessness.

In  brief,  the  patient  here  sought  the  services  which  the  hospital
offered to a selective portion of the public; the patient, as the price of
admission and as a result of his inferior bargaining position, accepted
a clause in a contract of adhesion waiving the hospital’s negligence;
the  patient  thereby  subjected  himself  to  control  of  the  hospital  and

Principles

rigidly  narrow

the  possible  infliction  of  the  negligence  which  he  had  thus  been
compelled  to  waive.  The  hospital,  under  such  circumstances,
occupied  a  status  different  than  a  mere  private  party;  its  contract
with the patient affected the public interest. We see no cogent current
reason for according to the patron of the inn a greater protection than
innkeeper’s
the  patient  of  the  hospital;  we  cannot  hold  the
performance affords a greater public service than that of the hospital.
We  must  note,  ﬁnally,  that
the  integrated  and  specialized
society  of  today,  structured
dependency,
upon  mutual
cannot

concept  of  the  public  interest.
From the observance of simple
standards  of  due  care  in  the
the
driving  of  a  car
performance  of
the  high
standards  of  hospital  practice,
the  individual  citizen  must  be
completely  dependent  upon
the  responsibility  of  others.
The  fabric  of  this  pattern  is  so
closely woven that the snarling
of  a  single  thread  affects  the
lightly
whole.  We  cannot
immunity
accept  a  sought
from careless failure to provide
the  hospital  service  upon
which  many  must  depend.
Even  if  the  hospital’s  doors  are  open  only  to  those  in  a  specialized
in  the
category,  the  hospital  cannot  claim

The judgment is reversed.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Exculpatory Clauses at Intersection of Different Aims.  One might
wonder, from a torts perspective, why a court would ever enforce an
exculpatory  clause.  It  undermines  the  tort  purpose  of  compensating
deserving  victims  as  well  as  the  goal  of  deterring  avoidable  injuries.
On the other hand, exculpatory clauses are governed to an extent by
contract  law,  which  generally  permits  parties  the  autonomy  to
structure their personal affairs as they see ﬁt. Courts have essentially
compromised — they  will  enforce  such  clauses  as  an  express
assumption  of  the  risk  so  long  as  the  clauses  do  not  violate  public
policy. Despite the non-exhaustive yet lengthy list of factors utilized in
Tunkl, courts seem to enforce these clauses to the extent they merely
express  the  voluntary  decision  on  a  private  matter  to  assign  (or
diminish)  duties  between  those  parties.  Thus,  some  of  the  factors
relate  to  whether  the  activity  or  transaction  is  truly  just  a  private
matter,  and  others  relate  to  whether  the  plaintiff  actually  and
voluntarily agreed to the clause.

2. Other  Examples  of  Void  Exculpatory  Clauses.   In  addition  to  the
provision of hospital services, courts have also refused to uphold an
express  assumption  of  the  risk  in  a  variety  of  other  circumstances,
including the following examples:

A.  Requiring  parents  of  high  school  students  to  sign  a  release  in
connection  with  school  athletic  programs.  Wagenblast  v.
Odessa School District, 758 P.2d 968 (Wash. 1988).

B.  Exculpatory  agreement  by  employee  releasing  employer  from
negligence  in  the  workplace  environment.  Brown  v.  Soh,  909

A.2d 43 (Conn. 2006).

C.  An  express  assumption  of  the  risk  barring  recovery  even  for
grossly  negligent  or  intentional  misconduct.  City  of  Santa
Barbara v. Superior Court, 161 P.3d 1095 (Cal. 2007).

3. Problems.  In light of the factors adopted by the Tunkl court for
considering the public policy issue of enforcement of an exculpatory
clause, should a court agree to enforce an express assumption of the
risk in the following hypothetical scenarios?

A.  Ford  Motor  Company,

its  form  sales  contracts  with
consumers, exonerates itself from liability for any of its defective
cars.

in

B. A manufacturer of trampolines includes a release on its website
that a purchaser must accept when ordering one of its products
online.

C.  A  lease  between  a  landlord  and  tenant  includes  an  express
assumption  of  the  risk  clause  that  excuses  the  landlord  from
liability  for  negligence  in  maintaining  the  common  areas  of  the
rental property.

D.  A  scuba  diving  school  requires  its  students  to  sign  a  release

agreement in order to receive instruction.

2. The Drafting Hurdle

Even  if  the  defendant’s  reliance  upon  a  release  survives  the  public
policy  scrutiny  under  the  Tunkl  factors,  the  court  may  still  refuse  to
enforce  the  release  if  it  is  not  drafted  with  sufﬁcient  clarity.  The
following  case  involves  an  attempted  utilization  of  a  release  as  a
defense  by  a  health  club.  As  you  read  this  case,  consider  why  the
Tunkl  factors  might  permit  the  enforcement  of  a  properly  worded
release for health club members. But note why this particular release
was nevertheless found invalid due to its drafting.

ALACK v. VIC TANNY INTERNATIONAL OF
MISSOURI, INC.
923 S.W.2d 330 (Mo. 1996)

     ,   ., J.

Plaintiff  was  injured  while  using  health  club  facilities.  He  had
signed a two-page, seventeen-paragraph “Retail Installment Contract”
containing a general exculpatory clause. The clause, however, did not
expressly release the health club from injuries resulting from its own
negligence.  The  trial  court  ruled  that  the  exculpatory  clause  did  not
bar plaintiff’s negligence action as a matter of law, but the trial court
allowed the contract as evidence and submitted the issue to the jury
as  a  matter  of  fact.  The  jury  returned  a  verdict  for  plaintiff  in  the
amount of $17,000.

We  hold  that  the  exculpatory  clause  was  ambiguous  and  that
defendant  health  club  did  not  insulate  itself  from  liability  for  future
negligence  because  the  exculpatory  clause  did  not  use  the  word
“negligence”  or  “fault”  or  their  equivalents  so  that  a  clear  and
unmistakable  waiver  occurred.  The  judgment  of  the  trial  court  is
afﬁrmed.

In  1982,  Charles  Alack  became  a  member  of  Vic  Tanny
International  of  Missouri,  Inc.,  a  health  club  facility.  Alack  was
encouraged  to  engage  in  a  speciﬁc  cardiovascular  workout  routine
known  as  the  “Super  Circuit.”  During  this  routine,  a  member  was
instructed to exercise on ten different weight machines while running
a  lap  between  each  exercise.  The  weight  machines  used  during  a
“Super Circuit” were speciﬁcally chosen because they required only a
selection of weight amount prior to their use and would not interrupt
the cardiovascular nature of the routine.

While  using  an  upright  row  machine  during  a  “Super  Circuit,”  the
machine’s  handle  disengaged  from  the  weight  cable  and  smashed
into Alack’s mouth and jaw. Alack suffered injuries to his mouth and

lips,  including  several  loose  and  broken  teeth.  As  of  the  trial,  Alack
had seen his dentist over 20 times, had undergone two surgeries, and
was scheduled for a third surgery. While the surgeries relieved some
of  Alack’s  pain,  his  temporomandibular  joint  remained  displaced.
Alack  testiﬁed  that  he  will  be  subject  to  additional  jaw  problems,
including  arthritic  changes,  and  might  require  additional  surgery  in
the  future.  Alack  had  already  incurred,  or  was  committed  to  incur,
in  medical  expenses  for  these  surgical  and  dental
$17,000
procedures.

“critically

The handle of the machine was connected without the necessary
clevis  pin  placed  between  the  cable  and  the  pigtail  hook.  The
manufacturer  originally  designed,  manufactured,  and  shipped  the
machine with the clevis pin in place. The manufacturer also provided
a  user  manual  warning  that  keeping  the  equipment  correctly
assembled  was
important  to  user  safety.”  At  trial,
maintenance  employees  of  Vic  Tanny  acknowledged  that  the  work-
out machine could be dangerous if used without the clevis pin. It was
also  acknowledged
that  Vic  Tanny  did  not  require  periodic
inspections by any speciﬁcally designated employee to make certain
that  the  clevis  pin  was  in  place.  [Plaintiff’s  product  liability  claim
against  the  manufacturer  was  dismissed  because  the  evidence
showed  the  defect  occurred  after  it  had  already  been  shipped  to
Defendant intact.]

On cross-examination, Alack was questioned about his Vic Tanny
“Retail  Installment  Contract,”  including  a  paragraph  purporting  to
release Vic Tanny from “any and all claims” against it.2 At no place in
the  membership  contract  does  Alack  expressly  agree  to  release  Vic
Tanny  from  its  own  future  negligence  or  fault.  All  seventeen  of  the
paragraphs  on  the  form-contract  were  printed  with  the  same-sized
lettering.  Nothing  made  Paragraph  G,  or  any  of  the  language
contained therein, conspicuously stand out. Alack signed the contract
near the bottom of the ﬁrst page. Paragraph G was on the back side
of the contract.

During  trial,  Vic  Tanny  initially  used  the  exculpatory  paragraph  to
demonstrate that Alack was aware that injuries could occur during a
workout  session.  Then  Alack  used  the  paragraph  to  explain  that  he
believed he was only releasing Vic Tanny from any injuries caused if
he  attempted  to  lift  too  much  weight  or  workout  for  too  long  of  a
period.  Alack  explained  what  the  clause  meant  to  him  during  direct
examination:

Q.   (By  Alack’s  attorney)  And  having  read  that  language  what  was

your understanding as to what that language meant?

A.  (By Alack) That language to me meant that if — It’s somewhat of a
limitation  of  liability  intended.  And  to  me  it  meant  that  if  I  did
something, sprained my back, which I have done, sprained ankle
or whatever in working out with the weights that they’re not liable.
Q.  Did you understand that language to mean that if Vic Tanny was
negligent  and  that  negligence  resulted  in  injury  to  you  that  you
could not bring a claim against Vic Tanny for negligence?

A.  No, that was not my understanding.

In Practice
A clause disclaiming liability for
negligence signed prior to any
tort is referred to in Fed. R. Civ.
P. 8 as an “assumption of risk,”
whereas a clause in a contract
disclaiming liability for
negligence signed after a tort
has already occurred is referred
to as a “release” (i.e., a
settlement).

Finally,  Vic  Tanny  argued
that  the  exculpatory  clause
entitled  it  to  a  directed  verdict
because Paragraph G bars any
negligence claim by Alack as a
matter  of  law.  The  trial  judge
decided  to  submit  the  issue  to
jury  was
the
instructed  that  it  could  ﬁnd  in
favor  of  Vic  Tanny  only  if  it
that,  when  Alack
believed
signed
the  membership
agreement,  he  had  agreed  to
release  Vic  Tanny  from  the

jury.  The

type of claim involved in this case. The jury returned a verdict against
Vic  Tanny  on  Alack’s  negligence  count,  and  awarded  Alack
$17,000.00  in  damages.  Vic  Tanny  ﬁled  a  motion  for  judgment
notwithstanding the verdict [which was overruled by the trial court].

Vic Tanny appeals, alleging that the trial court erred in denying Vic
Tanny  a  directed  verdict  as  a  matter  of  law  on  Alack’s  negligence
claim because of the exculpatory membership contract. . . .

Although exculpatory clauses in contracts releasing an individual
from  his  or  her  own  future  negligence  are  disfavored,  they  are  not
prohibited as against public policy. Rock Springs Realty, Inc. v. Waid,
392  S.W.2d  270,  272  (Mo.  1965).  However,  contracts  exonerating  a
party  from  acts  of  future  negligence  are  to  be  “strictly  construed
against  the  party  claiming  the  beneﬁt  of  the  contract,  and  clear  and
explicit language in the contract is required to absolve a person from
such  liability.”  Hornbeck  v.  All  American  Indoor  Sports,  Inc.,  898
S.W.2d  717,  721  (Mo.  App.  1995).  It  is  a  “well-established  rule  of
construction that a contract provision exempting one from liability for
his  or  her  negligence  will  never  be  implied  but  must  be  clearly  and
explicitly  stated.”  Poslosky  v.  Firestone  Tire  and  Rubber  Co.,  349
S.W.2d 847, 850 (Mo. 1961).

Most states have enforced exculpatory clauses when they include
speciﬁc references to the negligence or fault of the drafter. In Dresser
Industries,  Inc.  v.  Page  Petroleum,  Inc.,  853  S.W.2d  505,  508-509
(Tex. 1993), the Texas Supreme Court applied an “express negligence
doctrine” that requires a release to speciﬁcally express the intent of a
party  to  be  relieved  from  his  or  her  own  negligence.  The  court
explained
releases,  exculpatory
agreements, or waivers are extraordinary methods of shifting the risk
individuals  wishing  to  protect
of  negligent  conduct.  Therefore,
themselves  from  their  own  negligence  “must  express  that  intent  in
speciﬁc terms within the four corners of the contract.”

indemnity  agreements,

that

In Gross v. Sweet, 400 N.E.2d 306, 309 (N.Y. 1979), the New York
Court of Appeals ﬁrst noted the following principles of law regarding
the construction of exculpatory language:

As the cases make clear, the law’s reluctance to enforce exculpatory provisions
of this nature has resulted in the development of an exacting standard by which
courts  measure  their  validity.  So,  it  has  been  repeatedly  emphasized  that  it
must  appear  plainly  and  precisely  that  the  “limitation  of  liability  extends  to
negligence  or  other  fault  of  the  party  attempting  to  shed  his  ordinary
responsibility.”

Not  only  does  this  stringent  standard  require  that  the  drafter  of  such  an
agreement  make  its  terms  unambiguous,  but  it  mandates  that  the  terms  be
understandable  as  well.  Thus,  a  provision  that  would  exempt  its  drafter  from
any  liability  occasioned  by  his  fault  should  not  compel  resort  to  a  magnifying
glass and lexicon.

The court then held that a release providing that “I . . . waive any
and  all  claims,”  language  remarkably  similar  to  that  used  in  the
present  case,  was  insufﬁcient  to  bar  a  personal  injury  action  for
negligence because the release “nowhere expresses any intention to
exempt  the  defendant  from  liability  for  injury  or  property  damages
which may result from his failure to use due care.” In requiring the use
of  the  word  “negligence”  or  “words  conveying  a  similar  import”  the
inherently
court  noted  that  while  one  might  accept  the  risks
associated with any particular activity, “it does not follow that he was
aware  of,  much  less  intended  to  accept,  any  enhanced  exposure  to
injury  occasioned  by  the  carelessness  of  the  very  persons  on  which
he depended for his safety.” See Doyle v. Bowdoin College,  403  A.2d
1206,  1208  (Me.  1979)  (holding  the  release  must  use  the  “greatest
particularity”  to  extinguish  negligence  liability  and  there  must  be  an
express  reference  to  liability  for  negligence);  Geise  v.  County  of
Niagara,  458  N.Y.S.2d  162,  164  (Sup.  1983)  (explaining  that  a
negligence  claim  was  not  barred  unless  words  referring  to  the
“neglect” or “fault” of the defendant were used in the release); Haugen
v. Ford Motor Co., 219 N.W.2d 462, 470 (N.D. 1974) (holding that there

is  no  “plain  and  precise”  limitation  of  liability  without  a  reference  to
“negligence”);  Blum  v.  Kauffman,  297  A.2d  48,  49  (Del.  1972)
(explaining  that  the  word  “negligence”  was  not  in  release  and,
therefore,  did  not  “clearly  and  unequivocally”  spell  out  the  intent  to
grant  such  protection  from  liability  for  negligence);  Ciofalo  v.  Vic
Tanney  Gyms,  Inc.,  177  N.E.2d  925,  926,  (N.Y.  1961)  (barring  claim
when “negligence” stated in release).

We  are  persuaded  that  the  best  policy  is  to  follow  our  previous
decisions and those of other states that require clear, unambiguous,
unmistakable,  and  conspicuous  language  in  order  to  release  a  party
from  his  or  her  own  future  negligence.  The  exculpatory  language
must  effectively  notify  a  party  that  he  or  she  is  releasing  the  other
party from claims arising from the other party’s own negligence. Our
traditional  notions  of  justice  are  so  fault-based  that  most  people
might not expect such a relationship to be altered, regardless of the
length  of  an  exculpatory  clause,  unless  done  so  explicitly.  General
language will not sufﬁce.

A  determination  as  to  whether  a  [contract]  is  ambiguous  is  a
question of law to be decided by the court. An ambiguity arises when
there is duplicity, indistinctness, or uncertainty in the meaning of the
words  used  in  the  contract.  In  this  case,  the  exculpatory  clause
purports  to  shield  Vic  Tanny  from  liability  for  “any  damages,”
“any . . . injuries” and “any and all claims, demands, damages, rights
of  action,  present  or  future  .  .  .  resulting  from  or  arising  out  of  the
Member’s  .  .  .  use  .  .  .  of  said  gymnasium  or  the  facilities  and
equipment  thereof.”  (Emphasis  added.)  Vic  Tanny  argues  that  this
language  is  clear  and  unambiguous.  In  a  theoretical  vacuum,  the
words  “any  and  “all”  might  appear  unambiguous:  “all”  means  “every”
and  “any”  means  “all.”  Webster’s  Third  New  International  Dictionary
54, 97 (1976).

When  viewed  in  the  context  of  the  law  governing  exculpatory
clauses, however, this clause is ambiguous. As extensive as it is, the
exculpatory clause at issue in this case is ambiguous because it did

not  speciﬁcally  state  that  a  member  was  releasing  Vic  Tanny  for  its
own future negligence. Additionally, there is no question that one may
never exonerate oneself from future liability for intentional torts or for
gross negligence, or for activities involving the public interest. Yet the
words used here would purport to include these claims, which cannot
be  waived.  Although  these  claims  were  not  asserted  here,  they
demonstrate  the  ambiguity  of  the  contractual  language.  A  contract
that purports to relieve a party from any and all claims but does not
actually do so is duplicitous, indistinct and uncertain.

Alack  testiﬁed  that  he  did  not  understand  that  he  was  releasing
Vic  Tanny  from  its  own  future  negligence.  Additionally,  the  twelve
jurors found, as a matter of fact, that the exculpatory clause did not
so release Vic Tanny. While this issue is to be decided as a matter of
law, and should not have been submitted to the jury, our law on such
an  important  point  cannot  be  so  out  of  step  with  the  understanding
of  our  citizens.  The  better  rule  is  one  that  establishes  a  bright-line
test, easy for courts to apply, and certain to alert all involved that the
future  “negligence”  or  “fault”  of  a  party  is  being  released.  The  words
their  equivalents  must  be  used
“negligence”  or
conspicuously  so  that  a  clear  and  unmistakable  waiver  and  shifting
of  risk  occurs.4  There  must  be  no  doubt  that  a  reasonable  person
agreeing  to  an  exculpatory  clause  actually  understands  what  future
claims he or she is waiving.

“fault”  or

The  trial  court  did  not  err  in  denying  Vic  Tanny’s  request  for  a
directed verdict because the exculpatory clause at issue did not meet
the requirements discussed above.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Strict  Scrutiny.   While  courts  hearing  tort  claims  will  permit  an
express  assumption  of  the  risk  (also  known  as  an  exculpatory
agreement)  if  it  does  not  offend  public  policy,  most  courts  do  apply

strict  scrutiny  to  such  agreements  and  construe  them  against  the
party  invoking  their  protections.  Typically,  the  party  invoking  the
protection of the clause is also the party that drafted the clause and
insisted upon its execution. Certainly, a lack of clarity will invalidate a
particular  exculpatory  clause.  In  the  Vic  Tanny  case,  the  court
demanded, as a matter of law, that the agreement expressly indicate
that the claims being released included claims based upon the health
club’s  own  negligence — the  so-called  express  negligence  rule.
Beyond  this,  the  court  also  alluded  to  other  courts’  demands  when
scrutinizing  releases,  such  as  that  the  language  be  clear  and
unmistakable as well as conspicuous. Beyond the failure to meet the
express negligence rule, do you see other potential problems with the
release in Vic Tanny?

2.  Restatement  (Second)  View.   Second  Restatement  §496B
generally  provides  that:  “A  plaintiff  who  by  contract  or  otherwise
expressly agrees to accept a risk of harm arising from the defendant’s
negligent  .  .  .  conduct  cannot  recover  for  such  harm,  unless  the
agreement  is  invalid  as  contrary  to  public  policy.”  In  addition,  the
Restatement  (Second)  also  comments  on  the  need  for  a  showing
that the plaintiff was aware of and freely agreed to the release:

In  order  for  an  express  agreement  assuming  the  risk  to  be
effective, it must appear that the plaintiff has given his assent to
the  terms  of  the  agreement.  Particularly  where  the  agreement  is
drawn by the defendant, and the plaintiff’s conduct with respect to
it is merely that of a recipient, it must appear that the terms were
in fact brought home to him and understood by him, before it can
be found that he has accepted them.

B. Secondary Implied Assumption of the Risk

While  express  assumption  of  the  risk  arises  because  of  courts’
willingness  to  permit  contract  principles  to  supply  the  defense  to  a
negligence  claim,  secondary  implied  assumption  of  the  risk  has
nothing  to  do  with  any  contractual  relationship  between  the  parties.
We will begin by observing the traditional application of the doctrine
in  two  different  cases.  The  latter  of  the  two  demonstrates  a  very
broad application of the doctrine. Following those cases, we will see a
court wrestle with the question of whether it makes sense to continue
to  recognize  secondary  implied  assumption  of  the  risk  as  a  viable
separate defense in the age of comparative fault.

The Riddle case set forth immediately below applies both express
and  secondary  implied  assumption  of  the  risk  to  ﬁnd  against  the
plaintiff. Observe differences between these two types of assumption
of  risk  in  the  court’s  discussion.  The  next  case,  Schroyer,  discusses
unqualified assumption of the risk as opposed to the qualified variety
involved in Riddle. What is the essential difference between these two
versions of secondary implied assumption of the risk?

1. Qualiﬁed Secondary Implied Assumption of the Risk

RIDDLE v. UNIVERSAL SPORT CAMP
786 P.2d 641 (Kan. App. 1990)

          .

Theresa  Riddle  appeals  from  summary  judgment  denying  her
personal injury claim and holding that Tennessee law was applicable
and that Riddle had . . . assumed the risk of her injury. We afﬁrm as
modiﬁed.

Theresa  Riddle  was  a  cheerleader  for  Kansas  State  University
during  the  1983-84  and  1984-85  academic  years.  She  signed  a
release  to  the  University  in  1983,  but  apparently  signed  no  such
release  in  1984.  As  a  condition  to  her  participation  in  cheerleading,
she was required to attend the Universal Sport Camp d/b/a Universal
Cheerleaders  Association  (Universal)  in  Memphis,  Tennessee.  Bea
Pray and Scott Shell supervised the cheer leading squad at the camp.
In  August  1984,  Riddle  was  involved  in  building  a  “toe-touch
pyramid” on which she was to be the top person. Two men from the
camp gave her a boost, pushing on the bottom of her feet. The men
tossed  her  “a  little  too  hard,”  causing  her  to  overrotate  and  fall
forward, missing the people on whom she was supposed to land. She
landed  on  her  face.  Camp
fell  approximately  ﬁfteen  feet  and
employees  told  her  she  probably  had  a  hyperextended  back  and  did
not recommend medical treatment. The next day Riddle participated
in pyramid formations despite pain and back spasms.

Three  days

later,  Riddle’s  back  was  x-rayed,  and  she  was
diagnosed  as  suffering  from  a  fractured  vertebra.  She  received
injections,  medication,  and  therapy.  She  eventually  was  released  to
return  to  cheerleading,  which  she  continued  to  do  in  a  limited
capacity to the end of the 1984-85 basketball season.

UNIVERSAL SPORT CAMP

The  trial  court  elected  to  apply  Tennessee  substantive  law  pursuant
to Brown v. Kleen Kut Mfg. Co., 714 P.2d 942 (1986) (a tort action is
governed  by  the  laws  of  the  state  where  the  injuries  are  sustained).
Riddle does not raise the choice of law issue on appeal.

Prior  to  participating  in  the  camp,  Riddle  signed  a  “Medical

to  a  release  from  the  defendant’s  own  “negligence”  in  order  to  be
enforced. The court noted that Tennessee “has elected not to follow

favors

Riddle  signed  a  statement  to  Universal  Sport  Camp  expressly
assuming  the  risk  of  injury  and  agreeing  to  pay  medical  bills  herself
or from insurance money. Tennessee recognizes the validity of such
releases,  and  summary  judgment  is  appropriate  with  respect  to  the
defendant Universal.

THE OTHER DEFENDANTS

The trial court found that Riddle expressly assumed the risk of injury
when  she  signed  the  medical  treatment  release  and  liability  release
prior  to  attending  camp  and  thus  her  claims  were  barred  against  all
the defendants. It is uncontroverted that this release was required by
Universal.  The  form  was  apparently  provided  by  Universal;  the  other
defendants are not named in the document nor are they claiming that
they required the release.

As  to  Universal,  the  release  constituted  a  contractual  release  of
liability under Tennessee law. As to the other defendants, the release
was  written  evidence  of  Riddle’s  voluntary  exposure  to  the  known
dangers  involved  in  participating  in  the  cheerleading  camp.  Under
Tennessee law, the assumption of risk defense is not dependent upon
a contractual relationship.

“At  the  commencement  of  any  analysis  of  the  doctrine  of
assumption of risk, we must recognize that we deal with a potpourri
labels,  concepts,  deﬁnitions,  thoughts,  and  doctrines.  The
of
confusion  of  labels  does  not  end  with  the  indiscriminate  and
interchangeable  use  of  the  terms  ‘contributory  negligence’  and
‘assumption  of  risk.’  In  the  case  law  and  among  text  writers,  there
have  developed  categories  of  assumption  of  risk.  Distinctions  exist
between  express  and  implied;  between  primary  and  secondary;  and
between  reasonable  and  unreasonable  or,  as  sometimes  expressed,

strict  and  qualified.”  Blackburn  v.  Dorta,  348  So.  2d  287,  290  (Fla.
1977).

In  express  assumption  of  risk,  the  plaintiff  expressly  contracts
that defendant shall have no duty of care toward plaintiff. The courts
continue  to  hold  that  an  action  for  negligence  is  barred  under  these
circumstances.

Implied  assumption  of  risk  exists  when  a  plaintiff  has  impliedly
consented to assume risks. Implied assumption of risk is divided into
primary  and  secondary  assumption  of  risk.  Primary  assumption  of
risk is basically a principle of no negligence where there is no duty or
no breach. This would include the ordinary risks of an activity where
no  negligence  exists.  Assumption  of  risk  would  still  exist  in  that
situation, but its utility is small as it could more properly be explained
as non-negligence without reference to assumption of risk. Without a
breach of duty by the defendant there is nothing left to compare with
any misconduct of the plaintiff.

Secondary  assumption  of

risk  contemplates  a  voluntary
encounter  with  a  known  and  obvious  risk  created  by  the  negligent
conduct  of  another.  It  is  further  broken  down  into  reasonable  and
unreasonable  assumption  of  such  risk.  The  distinction  between  the
in
two
comparison with the risk involved.

is  determined  by  weighing  the  utility  of  the  conduct

One example of a reasonable secondary assumption of risk would
be  a  tenant  who  is  injured  when  he  enters  his  burning  apartment  to
save  his  child  and  it  is  determined  that  the  ﬁre  was  due  to  the
landlord  negligently  allowing  the  premises  to  become  highly
flammable. An example of an unreasonable secondary assumption of
risk  would  be  when  a  tenant,  under  the  same  circumstances,  enters
his burning apartment to retrieve his hat.

Absent  an  express  contract  with  the  defendants  other  than
Universal, we must determine if there was an implied assumption of
risk.  “The  elements  of  assumption  of  the  risk  are:  (1)  actual

knowledge of the danger; (2) appreciation of the gravity of the danger;
and  (3)  voluntary  exposure  to  the  danger.  Knowledge  of  the  danger
can be established if the danger was so obvious that one was bound
to know of it.” Frazier v. Moore, 651 S.W.2d at 242.

Considering  the  ﬁrst  element,  Riddle  knew  of  the  risks  of  injury
related to cheerleading. Riddle was an experienced cheerleader in her
second year for Kansas State University, this was her second year at
the  camp,  she  had  moved  from  alternate  to  full-time  cheerleader  in
1983  because  another  girl  was  injured,  and  she  had  also  been
previously injured in 1984, which required surgery.

Likewise,  Riddle’s  experience  would  lead  her  to  appreciate  the
danger  (the  second  element)  involved  in  any  number  of  routines,
including the “toe-touch pyramid” in which she is literally flung some
ten  to  ﬁfteen  feet  into  the  air,  where  she  lands  on  the  backs  of  two
men who are in turn standing on the shoulders of two other men. The
risk of falling is obvious.

Finally, Riddle voluntarily assumed the risk (the third element), as
evidenced  by  her  becoming  and  remaining  a  cheerleader,  her
attendance at the camps, and her written release to Universal. Riddle
assumed the risk.

Riddle contends that the defendants were negligent in not having

a spotter in front of the pyramid.

Assuming  for  purposes  of  summary  judgment  the  defendants
were  negligent  in  failing  to  place  a  spotter  in  front  of  the  pyramid,
then Riddle’s assumption of risk would not be classiﬁed as an implied
primary  assumption  of  risk  in  which  the  defendant  neither  owes  a
duty to plaintiff nor is negligent.

Secondary  (reasonable  or  unreasonable)  assumption  of  risk
contemplates  a  voluntary  encounter  with  a  known  and  obvious  risk
created  by  the  negligence  of  the  defendant.  Again,  assuming  the
defendants were negligent in failing to place a spotter in front of the
pyramid,  this  would  have  been  obvious  to  Riddle  before  and  during

the routine, and, notwithstanding defendants’ negligence, it would be
unreasonable  as  a  matter  of  law  for  Riddle  to  risk  a  fall  of
approximately  ﬁfteen  feet  knowing  there  was  no  spotter.  Under
Tennessee law, the defendants’ negligence, then, would not preclude
the assumption of risk defense as a bar to Riddle’s claims.

The  trial  court  correctly  concluded  that  the  risk  of  falling  was  a
speciﬁc  risk  known  to  Riddle  and  voluntarily  encountered.  When
facts  reveal  knowledge  of  danger  and  voluntary
undisputed
participation  in  the  hazardous  activity,  there  is  no  jury  question,  and
judgment for the defendant is appropriate.

Summary  judgment  in  favor  of  Universal  based  upon  Riddle’s
express  assumption  of  risk  is  afﬁrmed.  Summary  judgment  in  favor
of the other defendants is afﬁrmed as modiﬁed based upon Riddle’s
implied assumption of risk.

2. Unqualiﬁed Secondary Implied Assumption of the

Risk

    , J.

SCHROYER v. McNEAL
592 A.2d 1119 (Md. App. 1991)

The  genesis  of  this  case  was  a  slip  and  fall  accident  which
occurred  on  the  parking  lot  of  the  Grantsville  Holiday  Inn  in  Garrett
County,  Maryland.  Frances  C.  McNeal  (McNeal),  the  respondent,
sustained  a  broken  ankle  in  the  accident  and,  as  a  result,  sued
Thomas  Edward  Schroyer  and  his  wife,  Patricia  A.  Schroyer  (the
Schroyers),  the  petitioners,  in  the  Circuit  Court  for  Garrett  County,
alleging  both  that  they  negligently  maintained  the  parking  lot  and
negligently failed to warn her of its condition. The jury having returned
a  verdict  in  favor  of  McNeal  for  $50,000.00  and  their  motion  for

judgment  notwithstanding  the  verdict  or  for  new  trial  having  been
denied, the Schroyers appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which
afﬁrmed.  In  its  opinion,  the  intermediate  appellate  court  directly
addressed
the  Schroyers’s  primary  negligence  and  McNeal’s
contributory negligence; however, although it was properly presented,
that court did not speciﬁcally address whether McNeal had assumed
the risk of her injury. We issued the writ of certiorari at the request of
the  Schroyers  and  now  reverse.  We  hold  that,  as  a  matter  of  law,
McNeal assumed the risk of the injury. We need not and, therefore, do
not, reach the other issues presented.

The  events  surrounding  McNeal’s  accident  and  her  subsequent
complaint  against  the  Schroyers  are  largely  not  in  dispute.  McNeal
arrived  at  the  Grantsville  Holiday  Inn  at  approximately  5:30  p.m.  on
January 9, 1985. At that time, although approximately four inches of
sleet and ice had accumulated, she observed that the area in front of,
and surrounding, the main lobby area, where hotel guests registered,
had been shoveled and, thus, was reasonably clear of ice and snow.
She also noticed, however, that the rest of the parking lot had neither
been  shoveled  nor  otherwise  cleared  of  the  ice  and  snow.  McNeal
parked  her  car  in  front  of  the  hotel  while  she  registered.  While
registering, she requested a room closest to an exit due to her need to
“cart”  boxes  and  paperwork  back  and  forth  to  her  room.  She  was
assigned a room close to the west side entrance, which was at the far
end of the hall, away from the lobby. This was done notwithstanding
the  hotel’s  policy  of  not  assigning  such  rooms  during  inclement
weather.  Also,  contrary  to  policy,  McNeal  was  not  advised  that  she
should not use the west entrance and, of course, no warnings to that
effect were posted near that entrance.

Having  registered,  McNeal  drove  her  car  from  the  main  entrance
to within ten to ﬁfteen feet of the west side entrance. She parked on
packed ice and snow. Moreover, as she got out of her car, she noticed
that  the  sidewalk  near  the  entrance  had  not  been  shoveled  and,
furthermore,  that  the  area  was  slippery.  Nevertheless,  she  removed

her  cat  from  the  car  and  crossed  the  ice  and  snow  carefully,  and
without mishap. On the return trip to her car to retrieve the remainder
of her belongings, she slipped and fell, sustaining the injury previously
described.

Concerning  her  knowledge  of  the  parking  lot’s  condition,  McNeal
testiﬁed  that,  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  where  she  parked  her  car,
the  “packed  ice  and  snow”  was  slippery  and  that,  as  a  result,  she
entered  the  building  “carefully.”  She  denied,  however,  that  it  was
unreasonable for her, under the circumstances, to try to traverse the
parking  lot;  she  “didn’t  think  it  was  that  slippery.  I  didn’t  slip  the  ﬁrst
time in.”

The  Schroyers  moved  for  judgment,  both  at  the  end  of  McNeal’s
case in chief and at the conclusion of all the evidence. That McNeal
had assumed the risk of her injury was one of the grounds advanced
in  support  of  those  motions.  Both  motions  were  denied.  The  jury
having  returned  its  verdict  in  favor  of  McNeal,  the  Schroyers  ﬁled  a
motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or a new trial. As in
the  case  of  the  motions  for  judgment,  they  argued  that  respondent
was  barred  from  recovery  by  the  doctrine  of  assumption  of  the  risk.
The trial court denied that motion.

As  indicated  earlier,  the  Court  of  Special  Appeals  did  not  directly
address  whether  McNeal  assumed  the  risk  of  injury.  Although  it
recognized  that  she  “knew  of  the  dangerous  condition”  and,
presumably,  acted  voluntarily  when  she  started  to  cross  the  ice  and
snow  covered  parking  lot  and  sidewalk,  the  court  perceived  the

circumstances.” It concluded that whether McNeal was contributorily
negligent,  i.e.,  acted  reasonably  in  light  of  the  known  risk,  was  a
question appropriately left to the jury for decision.

Assumption  of  the  risk  and  contributory  negligence  are  closely
related  and  often  overlapping  defenses.  They  may  arise  from  the

same facts and, in a given case, a decision as to one may necessarily
include the other.

The  relationship  between  the  defenses  has  also  been  addressed

in the Restatement (Second) of Torts:

The  same  conduct  on  the  part  of  the  plaintiff  may  .  .  .  amount  to  both
assumption  of  risk  and  contributory  negligence,  and  may  subject  him  to  both
defenses.  His  conduct  in  accepting  the  risk  may  be  unreasonable  and  thus
negligent,  because  the  danger  is  out  of  all  proportion  to  the  interest  he  is
seeking  to  advance,  as  where  he  consents  to  ride  with  a  drunken  driver  in  an
unlighted car on a dark night, or dashes into a burning building to save his hat.
Likewise,  even  after  accepting  an  entirely  reasonable  risk,  he  may  fail  to
exercise reasonable care for his own protection against that risk.

§496A,  comment  d,  at  562.  The  overlap  between  assumption  of  the
risk  and  contributory  negligence  is  a  complete  one  where  “the
plaintiff’s  conduct  in  voluntarily  encountering  a  known  risk  is  itself
unreasonable. . . . ” §496A, comment c 4. When that occurs, the bar to
recovery is two-pronged: 1) because the plaintiff assumed the risk of
injury and 2) because the plaintiff was contributorily negligent.

There  is,  however,  a  distinction,  and  an  important  one,  between
the  defenses  of  assumption  of  the  risk  and  contributory  negligence.
That  distinction  was  stated  in  Warner v. Markoe,  189  A.2d  260,  264
(Md. 1937), thusly:

The  distinction  between  contributory  negligence  and  voluntary  assumption  of
the  risk  is  often  difﬁcult  to  draw  in  concrete  cases,  and  under  the  law  of  this
state  usually  without  importance,  but  it  may  be  well  to  keep  it  in  mind.
Contributory  negligence,  of  course,  means  negligence  which  contributes  to
cause a particular accident which occurs, while assumption of risk of accident
means voluntary incurring that of an accident which may not occur, and which
the  person  assuming  the  risk  may  be  careful  to  avoid  after  starting.
Contributory negligence defeats recovery because it is a proximate cause of the
accident which happens, but assumption of the risk defeats recovery because it
is a previous abandonment of the right to complain if an accident occurs.

189 A. at 264. The distinction is no less clearly made by reference to
the  rationale  underlying  the  doctrine  of  assumption  of  the  risk.  We
explicated  that  rationale  in  Gibson  v.  Beaver,  226  A.2d  273,  275
(1967) (quoting W. Prosser, Handbook of the Law of Torts §55 at 303
(2d ed. 1955)):

The  defense  of  assumption  of  risk  rests  upon  the  plaintiff’s  consent  to  relieve
the defendant of an obligation of conduct toward him, and to take his chances
of harm from a particular risk. Such consent may be found: . . . by implication
from  the  conduct  of  the  parties.  When  the  plaintiff  enters  voluntarily  into  a
relation  or  situation  involving  obvious  danger,  he  may  be  taken  to  assume  the
risk, and to relieve the defendant of responsibility. Such implied assumption of
risk requires knowledge and appreciation of the risk, and a voluntary choice to
encounter it.

See also  Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts  §496A,  comment  d,  at  562
and  §496C,  at  569-574.  Assumption  of  the  risk,  then,  “implies  an
intentional  exposure  to  a  known  danger  which  may  or  may  not  be
true of contributory negligence.” Burke v. Williams, 223 A.2d at 189.

Whether  they  overlap  or  not,  the  critical  distinction  between
contributory  negligence  and  assumption  of  the  risk  is  that,  in  the
latter,  by  virtue  of  the  plaintiff’s  voluntary  actions,  any  duty  the
defendant owed the plaintiff to act reasonably for the plaintiff’s safety
is  superseded  by  the  plaintiff’s  willingness  to  take  a  chance.
Consequently, unlike the case of contributory negligence, to establish
assumption  of  the  risk,  negligence  is  not  an  issue — proof  of
negligence is not required. The plaintiff need only be aware of the risk,
which he or she then voluntarily undertakes. Restatement (Second) of
Torts, §496A, comment d, at 562; Prosser and Keeton §68 at 485-86;
Keenan,  193  A.2d  at  36;  Bull  Steamship  Lines  v.  Fisher,  77  A.2d  at
146.

It  is,  in  short,  the  willingness  of  the  plaintiff  to  take  an  informed
chance  that  distinguishes  assumption  of  the  risk  from  contributory
negligence.  Thus,  just  as  the  facts  of  a  given  case  may  warrant  the
same  result  on  either  theory,  the  facts  in  another  may  warrant

conflicting  results.  In  other  words,  “either  may  constitute  a  defense,
with  or  without  the  other.”  Evans,  167  A.2d  at  594.  A  plaintiff  who
proceeds  reasonably,  and  with  caution,  after  voluntarily  accepting  a
risk,  not  unreasonable  in  itself,  may  not  be  guilty  of  contributory
negligence,  but  may  have  assumed  the  risk.  See  Pinehurst  Co.  v.
Phelps, 163 Md. 68, 72, 160 A. 736, 737 (1932) (“A risk, while obvious,
may  not  be  so  imminently  dangerous  that  a  prudent  man  would
necessarily  avoid  it,  yet  if  it  shall  be  freely  encountered  it  will  in
general be held to be so far assumed that no recovery for consequent
injury is possible.”). That plaintiff may be barred from recovery on the
ground of assumption of the risk, while he or she would recover were
the defense theory contributory negligence.

While,  ordinarily,  application  of  either  defense  will  produce  the
same  result,  that  is  not  always  the  case.  Especially  is  that  so  in  the
instant  case.  The  record  reflects,  and  the  Court  of  Special  Appeals
held,  a  matter  not  in  dispute  on  this  appeal,  that  McNeal  was  fully
aware of the dangerous condition of the premises. She knew that the
area  was  ice  and  snow  covered  and  that  the  ice  and  snow  were
slippery.  Nevertheless,  she  parked  in  the  area  and,  notwithstanding,
according  to  her  testimony,  that  she  proceeded  carefully,  she  took  a
chance  and  walked  over  the  ice  and  snow  covered  parking  lot  and
sidewalk because she did not think it was “that” slippery.

It  is  clear,  on  this  record,  that  McNeal  took  an  informed  chance.
Fully aware of the danger posed by an ice and snow covered parking
lot and sidewalk, she voluntarily chose to park and traverse it, albeit
carefully, for her own purposes, i.e. her convenience in unloading her
belongings. Assuming that the decision to park on the ice and snow
covered  parking  lot  and  to  cross  it  and  the  sidewalk  was  not,  itself,
to  how  she
contributory  negligence,  McNeal’s
proceeded  may  well  have  generated  a  jury  question  as  to  the
reasonableness  of  her  actions.  On  the  other  hand,  it  cannot  be
gainsaid that she intentionally exposed herself to a known risk. With
full  knowledge  that  the  parking  lot  and  sidewalk  were  ice  and  snow

testimony  as

covered  and  aware  that  the  ice  and  snow  were  slippery,  McNeal
voluntarily chose to park on the parking lot and to walk across it and
the  sidewalk,  thus  indicating  her  willingness  to  accept  the  risk  and
relieving the Schroyers of responsibility for her safety. Consequently,
while the issue of her contributory negligence may well have been for
the  jury,  the  opposite  is  true  with  respect  to  her  assumption  of  the
risk. We hold, as a matter of law, that McNeal assumed the risk of her
own injuries.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Express vs. Implied Assumption of the Risk.  In Riddle, the camp
defendant was entitled to summary judgment because it had a valid
exculpatory  clause  in  its  camp  contract  signed  by  the  plaintiff.
Tennessee  law,  which  applied  to  the  case,  does  not  follow  the
express  negligence  rule  and  the  court  found  that  this  clause  was
clear  enough,  since  strict  scrutiny  was  not  applied.  This  defense
would  not  be  applicable  to  the  remaining  defendants,  including
Kansas  State  University,  as  they  were  not  parties  to  the  contract.
However,  the  court  found  that  the  separate  doctrine  of  secondary
implied  assumption  of  the  risk  did  apply  and  served  as  a  complete
bar to recovery. What were the elements of this defense? Why, on the
facts of the case, did the court ﬁnd this defense to be valid?

2.  Qualiﬁed  vs.  Unqualiﬁed  Secondary  Implied  Assumption  of  the
Risk.   The  Riddle  court  indicated  that  some  jurisdictions  apply
secondary  implied  assumption  of  the  risk  in  an  unqualified  manner,
while others (including Tennessee) apply it with the qualiﬁcation that
the  doctrine  is  only  applicable  when  the  decision  by  the  plaintiff  to
voluntarily encounter a known risk was an unreasonable decision. In
this  limited  manner,  what  is  the  difference  between  traditional
contributory  negligence  and  secondary  implied  assumption  of  the
risk?  While  this  variety  of  assumption  of  the  risk  requires  subjective

awareness  and  appreciation  by  the  plaintiff  of  the  risk,  if  the  court
limits
its  application  to  situations  where  that  decision  was
unreasonable,  contributory  negligence  (if  still  observed  by  the  court)
likewise would bar the claim; so limited, the doctrine is unnecessary
baggage. However, in its traditional application, not all courts limited
the  doctrine  in  this  manner.  Many  courts  applied  the  doctrine
regardless of how reasonable the plaintiff’s conduct may have been,
so long as the remaining elements of secondary implied assumption
of  the  risk  were  present — this  is  unqualified  secondary  implied
assumption of the risk. This was true in the McNeal case where the
court  demonstrated  that,  even  though  the  plaintiff’s  decision  to
encounter  the  snow  and  ice  was  reasonable  (according  to  the  jury),
the evidence was undisputed that she nevertheless voluntarily chose
to encounter the known risk; this decision barred her claim.

3.  Voluntary  Exposure  to  Danger.   Courts  have  taken  a  common-
sense  approach  to  the  third  prerequisite  for  application  of  this
defense — that the claimant voluntarily exposed herself to the danger.
For  example,  in  Rush  v.  Commercial  Realty,  145  A.  476  (N.J.  1929),
the plaintiff was hurt while using a “detached privy” at the apartment
she leased from the defendant. The privy had a defective trap door in
the  floor.  The  plaintiff  was  hurt  when  using  the  facilities,  when  the
trap  door  opened  and  she  fell  nine  feet  into  the  ground,  no  doubt
suffering extreme disgust in addition to her physical injuries. The New
Jersey  Supreme  Court,  in  ruling  for  the  plaintiff  on  her  negligence
claim against the landlord, held that even if the other requirements of
secondary implied assumption of the risk were met, the defense was
still inapplicable: “It should be observed that Mrs. Rush had no choice,
when impelled by the calls of nature, but to use the facilities placed at
her disposal by the landlord, to wit, a privy with a trap door in the floor,
poorly  maintained.  We  hardly  think  this  was  [an]  assumption  of  the
risk;  she  was  not  required  to  leave  the  premises  and  go  elsewhere.”
Would  this  conclusion  still  stand  if  the  landlord  had  provided  a
second privy without a trap door?

4.  Problems.   Would  secondary  implied  assumption  of  the  risk

apply in the following scenarios?

A.  A  chef  notices  that  his  toaster  is  starting  to  emit  a  strange,
burning odor and that excessive amounts of smoke accompany
its recent usage. He continues to use it, observing that while the
smoke  was  not  expected  it  still  appeared  to  work.  The  toaster
catches  on  ﬁre,  and  the  chef  suffers  a  burned  hand  trying  to
extinguish the flames.

B. A motorist recently had the brakes replaced on his automobile.
The mechanic who repaired the brakes neglected to completely
reﬁll the brake fluid necessary for the hydraulics on the brakes to
work  properly.  The  motorist  notices  that  the  brakes  are
somewhat mushy in the days following the repair but the brakes
still perform. He continues to drive the car. As he approaches a
red light, he applies the brakes. Suddenly, they fail altogether and
he is involved in an accident.

C.  A  tourist  pays  a  fee  at  a  riding  stable  to  ride  a  horse  for  the
afternoon in the mountains. She notices that the saddle appears
loose and unsteady, but continues to ride the horse because she
did  not  want  to  lose  any  of  her  allotted  time  on  the  horse  by
having the saddle ﬁxed. As the horse is galloping around a curve,
the saddle falls off and the rider falls to the ground and is hurt.

3. Does Comparative Fault Abolish Secondary Implied

Assumption of the Risk?

Given the frequent overlap between secondary implied assumption of
the  risk  and  contributory  negligence,  many  courts  have  had  to
confront the legal question of whether their rejection of the absolute
defense  of  contributory  negligence  (in  favor  of  comparative  fault)
necessitates  an  abandonment  of  secondary  implied  assumption  of

the risk as well. The following court discusses the divergent views on
this  important  question  and  illustrates  most  courts’  answer  to  this
question.

DAVENPORT v. COTTON HOPE PLANTATION
HORIZONTAL PROPERTY REGIME
508 S.E.2d 565 (S.C. 1998)

    , J.

This is a comparative negligence case arising out of an accident
in which respondent, Alvin Davenport, was injured while descending a
stairway near his apartment. We afﬁrm as modiﬁed.

Alvin Davenport is a resident of Cotton Hope Plantation located on
Hilton  Head  Island.  The  plantation  is  organized  under  state  law  as
Cotton  Hope  Plantation  Horizontal  Regime  (“Cotton  Hope”).  Cotton
Hope  is  composed  of  ninety-six  condominium  units  located  in
levels.  The
multiple  buildings.  Each  building  consists  of  three
buildings  have  three  stairways  each,  one  in  the  middle  and  two  on
either side. Davenport’s unit is on the top level, approximately ﬁve feet
from a stairway. Davenport leases his unit from the owner.

Cotton  Hope  employed  Property  Administrators,  Incorporated
(“PAI”)  to  maintain  the  grounds  at  Cotton  Hope  Plantation.  In  April
1991,  PAI,  as  Cotton  Hope’s  agent,  hired  Carson  Landscaping
Company,  Inc.,  (“Carson”)  to  perform
landscaping  and  general
maintenance  work  at  the  condominiums.  Carson’s  duties  included
checking the outdoor lights and changing light bulbs as needed.

In  June  1991,  Davenport  began  reporting  that  the  floodlights  at
the  bottom  of  the  stairway  he  used  were  not  working.  Davenport
testiﬁed  he  made  several  phone  calls  to  PAI  complaining  about  the
problem.  Davenport  nevertheless  continued  to  use  the  stairway
during  this  time.  On  the  evening  of  August  12,  1991,  Davenport  fell

while  descending  the  stairway  closest  to  his  apartment.  Davenport
testiﬁed he fell after attempting to place his foot on what appeared to
be a step but was really a shadow caused by the broken floodlights.
He admitted not using the handrail in the stairway.

Davenport sued Cotton Hope for his injuries. At the close of all the
evidence, the trial court directed a verdict against Davenport, ﬁnding
he had assumed the risk of injury. The trial court also held that even if
assumption  of  risk  were  abrogated  by  the  adoption  of  comparative
negligence,  Davenport  was  more  than  ﬁfty-percent  negligent.
Davenport appealed the trial court’s ruling.

The threshold question we must answer is whether assumption of
risk  survives  as  a  complete  bar  to  recovery  under  South  Carolina’s
comparative  negligence  system.  In  Nelson  v.  Concrete  Supply
Company,  303  S.C.  243,  399  S.E.2d  783  (1991),  we  adopted  a
modiﬁed  version  of  comparative  negligence.  Under  this  system,  “for
all  causes  of  action  arising  on  or  after  July  1,  1991,  a  plaintiff  in  a
negligence action may recover damages if his or her negligence is not
greater  than  that  of  the  defendant.”  Nelson  made  clear  that  a
plaintiff’s  contributory  negligence  would  no  longer  bar  recovery
unless such negligence exceeded that of the defendant. Not so clear
was what would become of the defense of assumption of risk.

Currently  in  South  Carolina,  there  are  four  requirements  to
establishing the defense of assumption of risk: (1) the plaintiff must
have  knowledge  of  the  facts  constituting  a  dangerous  condition;  (2)
the  plaintiff  must  know  the  condition  is  dangerous;  (3)  the  plaintiff
must  appreciate  the  nature  and  extent  of  the  danger;  and  (4)  the
plaintiff must voluntarily expose himself to the danger.

As  noted  by  the  Court  of  Appeals,  an  overwhelming  majority  of
jurisdictions that have adopted some form of comparative negligence
have  essentially  abolished  assumption  of  risk  as  an  absolute  bar  to
recovery. In analyzing the continuing viability of assumption of risk in
a  comparative  negligence  system,  many  courts  distinguish  between

“express” assumption of risk and “implied” assumption of risk. See W.
Page  Keeton  et  al.,  Prosser  and  Keeton  on  the  Law  of  Torts,  §68  at
496 (5th ed. 1984). Implied assumption of risk is further divided into
the  categories  of  “primary”  and  “secondary”  implied  assumption  of
risk. Id. We will discuss each of these concepts below.

Express  assumption  of  risk  applies  when  the  parties  expressly
agree in advance, either in writing or orally, that the plaintiff will relieve
the defendant of his or her legal duty toward the plaintiff. Thus, being
under  no
legal  duty,  the  defendant  cannot  be  charged  with
negligence.  Even  in  those  comparative  fault  jurisdictions  that  have
abrogated  assumption  of  risk,  the  rule  remains  that  express
assumption of risk continues as an absolute defense in an action for
negligence.  The  reason  for  this  is  that  express  assumption  of  risk
sounds
is  based  upon  an  express
manifestation of consent.

in  contract,  not  tort,  and

Express assumption of risk is contrasted with implied assumption
of risk, which arises when the plaintiff implicitly, rather than expressly,
assumes known risks. As noted above, implied assumption of risk is
implied
characterized  as  either  primary  or  secondary.  Primary
assumption of risk arises when the plaintiff impliedly assumes those
risks  that  are  inherent  in  a  particular  activity.  Primary  implied
assumption of risk is not a true afﬁrmative defense, but instead goes
to  the  initial  determination  of  whether  the  defendant’s  legal  duty
encompasses  the  risk  encountered  by  the  plaintiff.  In  Perez,  the
Tennessee Supreme Court summarized the doctrine in the following
way:

In  its  primary  sense,  implied  assumption  of  risk  focuses  not  on  the  plaintiff’s
conduct  in  assuming  the  risk,  but  on  the  defendant’s  general  duty  of  care.
Clearly,  primary  implied  assumption  of  risk  is  but  another  way  of  stating  the
conclusion  that  a  plaintiff  has  failed  to  establish  a  prima  facie  case  [of
negligence] by failing to establish that a duty exists.

872 S.W.2d at 902. In this sense, primary implied assumption of risk
is simply a part of the initial negligence analysis.

Secondary  implied  assumption  of  risk,  on  the  other  hand,  arises
when  the  plaintiff  knowingly  encounters  a  risk  created  by  the
defendant’s negligence. It is a true defense because it is asserted only
after the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of negligence against
the  defendant.  Secondary  implied  assumption  of  risk  may  involve
either reasonable or unreasonable conduct on the part of the plaintiff.
implied  assumption  of  risk  are
compatible  with  comparative  negligence,  we  will  refer  to  secondary
implied assumption of risk simply as “assumption of risk.”

Since  express  and  primary

As  alluded  to  in  Litchfield,  assumption  of  risk  and  contributory
negligence have historically been recognized as separate defenses in
South Carolina. However, other courts have found assumption of risk
functionally
indistinguishable  from  contributory  negligence  and
consequently abolished assumption of risk as a complete defense.

To date, the only comparative fault jurisdictions that have retained
assumption  of  risk  as  an  absolute  defense  are  Georgia,  Mississippi,
Nebraska,  Rhode  Island,  and  South  Dakota.  Only  the  Rhode  Island
Supreme Court has provided a detailed discussion of why it believes
the  common  law  form  of  assumption  of  risk  should  survive  under
comparative negligence. In Kennedy v. Providence Hockey Club, Inc.,
Island  Supreme  Court
376  A.2d  329  (R.I.  1977),  the  Rhode
distinguished  between  assumption  of
risk  and  contributory
negligence,  emphasizing  the  former  was  measured  by  a  subjective
standard  while  the  latter  was  based  on  an  objective,  reasonable
person  standard.  The  court  further  noted  that  it  had  in  the  past
limited  the  application  of  assumption  of  risk  to  those  situations
where  the  plaintiff  had  actual  knowledge  of  the  hazard.  The  court
then  rejected  the  premise  that  assumption  of  risk  and  contributory
negligence overlap:

Contributory  negligence  and  assumption  of  the  risk  do  not  overlap;  the  key
difference  is,  of  course,  the  exercise  of  one’s  free  will  in  encountering  the  risk.
Negligence  analysis,  couched  in  reasonable  hypotheses,  has  no  place  in  the
assumption  of  the  risk  framework.  When  one  acts  knowingly,  it  is  immaterial
whether he acts reasonably.

Kennedy, 376 A.2d at 333.

Rhode  Island’s  conclusions  are  in  sharp  contrast  with  the  West
Virginia  Supreme  Court’s  opinion  in  King  v.  Kayak  Manufacturing
Corp.,  387  S.E.2d  511  (W.  Va.  1989).  Like  Rhode  Island,  the  West
Virginia  Supreme  Court  in  King  recognized  that  assumption  of  risk
was  conceptually  distinct  from  contributory  negligence.  The  court
speciﬁcally  noted  that  West  Virginia’s  doctrine  of  assumption  of  risk
required  actual  knowledge  of  the  dangerous  condition,  which
conformed with the general rule elsewhere in the country. In fact, the
court  cited  Rhode  Island’s  decision  in  Kennedy  as  evidence  of  this
general rule. Nevertheless, the West Virginia court concluded that the
absolute  defense  of  assumption  of  risk  was  incompatible  with  its
therefore  adopted  a
comparative
comparative assumption of risk rule, stating, “a plaintiff is not barred
from recovery by the doctrine of assumption of risk unless his degree
of  fault  arising  therefrom  equals  or  exceeds  the  combined  fault  or
negligence  of  the  other  parties  to  the  accident.”  The  court  explained
that the absolute defense of assumption of risk was as repugnant to
its fault system as the common law rule of contributory negligence.

the risk. If the plaintiff’s total negligence exceeds or equals that of the
defendant, only then is the plaintiff completely barred from recovery.

Like  Rhode

Island  and  West  Virginia,  South  Carolina  has
historically maintained a distinction between assumption of risk and
contributory  negligence,  even  when  the  two  doctrines  appear  to
overlap. Thus, the pertinent question is whether a plaintiff should be
completely  barred  from  recovery  when  he  voluntarily  assumes  a
known  risk,  regardless  of  whether  his  assumption  of  that  risk  was
reasonable  or  unreasonable.  Upon  considering  the  purpose  of  our
comparative fault system, we conclude that West Virginia’s approach
is the most persuasive model.

In  Nelson,  we  adopted  Chief  Judge  Sanders’s  analysis  of
comparative negligence [because]: “It is contrary to the basic premise
of our fault system to allow a defendant, who is at fault in causing an
accident, to escape bearing any of its cost, while requiring a plaintiff,
who is no more than equally at fault or even less at fault, to bear all of
its  costs.”  By  contrast,  the  main  reason  for  having  the  defense  of
assumption of risk is not to determine fault, but to prevent a person
who  knowingly  and  voluntarily  incurs  a  risk  of  harm  from  holding
another  person  liable.  Cotton  Hope  argues  that  the  justiﬁcation
behind  assumption  of  risk  is  not  in  conflict  with  South  Carolina’s
comparative fault system. We disagree.

[I]t  is  contrary  to  the  premise  of  our  comparative  fault  system  to
require a plaintiff, who is ﬁfty-percent or less at fault, to bear all of the
costs  of  the  injury.  In  accord  with  this  logic,  the  defendant’s  fault  in
causing  an  accident  is  not  diminished  solely  because  the  plaintiff
knowingly  assumes  a  risk.  If  assumption  of  risk  is  retained  in  its
current  common  law  form,  a  plaintiff  would  be  completely  barred
from  recovery  even  if  his  conduct  is  reasonable  or  only  slightly

negligence by deﬁnition seeks to assess and compare the negligence
of  both  the  plaintiff  and  defendant.  This  goal  would  clearly  be
thwarted  by  adhering  to  the  common  law  defense  of  assumption  of
risk.

We  therefore  hold  that  a  plaintiff  is  not  barred  from  recovery  by
the  doctrine  of  assumption  of  risk  unless  the  degree  of  fault  arising
therefrom  is  greater  than  the  negligence  of  the  defendant.  To  the

they  are  overruled.  Express  and  primary

Cotton Hope argues that even if this Court abrogates assumption
of risk as a complete defense, the trial court’s directed verdict should
be  upheld  [because]  as  a  matter  of  law,  Davenport’s  negligence
exceeded that of Cotton Hope. We disagree.

The trial court based its ruling on the fact that Davenport knew of
the  danger  weeks  before  his  accident,  and  he  had  a  safe,  alternate
route. However, there was also evidence suggesting Cotton Hope was
negligent  in  failing  to  properly  maintain  the  lighting  in  the  exterior
stairway.  In  the  light  most  favorable  to  Davenport,  it  could  be
reasonably  concluded  that  Davenport’s  negligence  in  proceeding
down the stairway did not exceed Cotton Hope’s negligence. Thus, it
is properly submitted for jury determination.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Express,  Primary  Implied,  and  Secondary  Implied.   The  court  in
Davenport  begins  by  observing  differences  between  these  three
varieties  of  assumption  of  the  risk.  What  are  the  essential
differences?  Why  does  the  court  believe  that  express  and  primary
implied  assumption  of  the  risk  should  be  unaffected  by  a
jurisdiction’s movement from contributory negligence to comparative

fault?  Why  does  this  not  hold  true  as  well  (for  most  courts)  with
regard to secondary implied assumption of the risk?

2. The  Rescue  Doctrine  Revisited.   You  may  recall  that  one  of  the
two  functions  of  the  rescue  doctrine  (covered  in  Chapter  6,  Special
Duty Rules) is to invalidate any attempted application of the defense
of secondary implied assumption of the risk in the case of a rescuer.
Do  you  see  how  a  rescuer  might  be  deemed  to  have  knowingly  and
voluntarily  encountered  a  risk  by  engaging  in  certain  rescue  efforts?
For this reason, the law traditionally has held that this defense should
not  apply  to  rescuers.  Because  most  states  have  now  shifted  to
comparative  fault  and,  accordingly,  eliminated  the  doctrine  of
secondary  implied  assumption  of  the  risk,  this  aspect  of  the  rescue
doctrine  has  little  utility.  Remember  that  the  rescue  doctrine  only
applied to rescuers whose decision to engage in a rescue effort was
“reasonable.”  With  unqualiﬁed  secondary  implied  assumption  of  the
risk  effectively  abolished  in  most  states,  only  unreasonable  conduct
applied  through  comparative  fault  would  be  a  defense  against  an
injured  rescuer.  And,  by  deﬁnition,  whenever  the  rescue  doctrine
applies  there  has  been  no  such  unreasonable  conduct.  Accordingly,
the  only  remaining  viable  defense  of  comparative  fault  would  not
apply anyway.

Upon Further Review

Reflecting  courts’  judgment  that  an  express  assumption  of  the
risk  can  constitute  private  parties’  freedom  to  delineate  their
respective  rights  and  responsibilities  on  private  matters,  courts
will enforce such exculpatory clauses when they clear these two
hurdles: (i) they do not touch upon public concerns, and (ii) they
are  drafted  with  sufﬁcient  clarity  so  that  there  is  no  doubt  that
the agreement truly represents the intention of the plaintiff prior
to  the  accident.  Secondary  implied  assumption  of  the  risk,  by

contrast,  is  premised  more  on  the  apparent  inconsistency
between a plaintiff knowingly and voluntarily encountering a risk
created  by  defendant’s  negligence,  and  then  trying  to  hold  the
defendant  responsible  post-accident.  When  this  decision  by  the
plaintiff
implied
is  unreasonable  (i.e.,  qualiﬁed  secondary
assumption  of  the  risk),  it  looks  essentially  the  same  as
contributory  negligence.  As  states  began
to  abandon
contributory  negligence  in  favor  of  comparative  fault,  it  made
sense to eliminate qualiﬁed assumption of the risk as a separate
defense  doctrine.  With  respect  to  the  unqualiﬁed  application  of
the  doctrine,  courts  appreciated  the  particular  anomaly  that
would result if a plaintiff’s reasonable decision to encounter the
risk  created  by  defendant’s  negligence  were  barred  under  that
doctrine,  even  though  comparative  fault  would  not  reduce  the
plaintiff’s  award.  As  a  result,  modern  courts  in  states  that  have
moved to comparative fault tend to permit a defense only when
the jury ﬁnds the decision unreasonable (i.e., negligent), and then
this  fault  is  apportioned.  In  other  words,  in  most  states  today
there is no longer any secondary implied assumption of the risk
— only comparative fault.

IV  IMMUNITIES

Another  set  of  afﬁrmative  defenses  arise,  based  not  upon  the
agreement or the conduct of the plaintiff, but upon the status of the
defendant  or  the  special  status  of  the  relationship  between  the
plaintiff and the defendant. These are immunities to suit that exist to
prevent  liability  for  very  different  reasons.  The  ﬁrst  is  sovereign
immunity,  a  common  law  doctrine  originally  premised  upon  the
quaint  idea  that  “the  king  can  do  no  wrong.”  This  doctrine,  which
applies  to  both  the  federal  and  state  and  local  governments,  has
some  exceptions  that  are  frequently  the  subject  of  litigation.  There
are also intrafamilial immunities that have existed, both (a) between
spouses and (b) between parents and their children.

A. Sovereign Immunity

1. The Federal Government

CESTONARO v. UNITED STATES
211 F.3d 749 (3d Cir. 2000)

       , J.

This  appeal  requires  us  to  interpret  the  “discretionary  function”
exception to the Federal Tort Claims Act’s general waiver of sovereign
immunity.  The  District  Court  dismissed  a  wrongful  death  complaint
against  the  United  States,  ﬁnding  that  the  discretionary  function
exception  to  the  Federal  Tort  Claim  Act’s  waiver  of  sovereign
immunity, 28 U.S.C. §2680(a), applied. We will reverse.

The  underlying  facts  are  undisputed.  In  December  1993,  Daniele
Cestonaro,  his  wife  Giovanna,  and  their  daughter,  all  Italian  citizens
and  residents,  were  vacationing  in  St.  Croix,  Virgin  Islands.  On  the
evening  of  December  28,  the  Cestonaros  parked  their  rental  car  in  a
lot  on  Hospital  Street  in  Christiansted.  Upon  returning  to  their  car
after dinner, the Cestonaros were confronted by two armed gunmen.
Daniele Cestonaro was shot and died almost immediately.

The  Hospital  Street

lot  falls  within  the  boundaries  of  the
Christiansted  National  Historic  Site  owned  and  controlled  by  the
United States Department of the Interior, National Park Service. At the
time of the murder, the Hospital Street lot was not an ofﬁcial parking
lot. There were no signs designating or even indicating that it was a
parking  lot;  it  was  neither  paved  nor  striped.  The  lot’s  appearance,
however,  differed  from  the  surrounding  area  in  the  Christiansted
National Historic Site in terms of grade and surface, as it consisted of
broken asphalt from a previous paving. Since the 1940s, the general
public  had  used  the  Hospital  Street
lot  as  a  parking  area.
Furthermore,  the  National  Park  Service  was  aware  that  crimes  had
occurred  in  the  lot  before  December  28,  1993.  In  addition  to  crime
incidents  reports  from  the  Virgin  Island  Police  Department  and  its
own  park  rangers,  the  National  Park  Service  also  received  regular
complaints about safety in the Hospital Street lot from local business
owners.

It  is  undisputed  that  the  National  Park  Service  had  done  nothing
to deter nighttime parking in the Hospital Street lot. It had not posted
signs  prohibiting  parking,  nor  signs  warning  of  dangers  of  nighttime
parking,  nor  issued  tickets  for  illegal  parking.  In  fact,  the  lot  was
lighted at night. Some time after the lot came into the government’s
possession,  ﬁve  lights  were  installed  illuminating  the  Hospital  Street
lot. It is undisputed the National Park Service maintained those lights.
Giovanna  Cestonaro  ﬁled  a  wrongful  death  action  against  the
United  States  under  the  Federal  Tort  Claims  Act  and  the  Virgin
Islands  Wrongful  Death  Statute.  In  her  complaint,  Mrs.  Cestonaro

alleged  that  “defendant  was  negligent  in  failing  to  provide  adequate
lighting  and  correct  the  known  dangerous  condition  and  to  warn
others  about  the  existence  of  the  dangerous  condition”  at  the
Hospital Street lot. The United States ﬁled a motion to dismiss under
Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  12(b)(1)  asserting  the  District  Court  lacked  subject
matter  jurisdiction  because  the  challenged  National  Park  Service
actions  fell  under  the  discretionary  function  exception  to  the  FTCA’s
waiver of sovereign immunity.

The  District  Court  dismissed  the  complaint,  ﬁnding  the  National
Park  Service’s  decisions  concerning  the  Hospital  Street  lot  were
grounded in its mission to “safeguard the natural and historic integrity
of  national  parks”  and  in  its  policy  “to  minimally  intrude  upon  the
setting of such parks.” Mrs. Cestonaro appealed.

The  Federal  Tort  Claims  Act  is  a  partial  waiver  of  the  sovereign
immunity  that  would  otherwise  protect  the  United  States  from  tort
liability  stemming  from  the  actions  of  its  employees.  The  express
purpose of the FTCA is to make the United States liable “in the same
manner  and  to  the  same  extent  as  a  private  individual  under  like
circumstances.  .  .  .  ”  28  U.S.C.  §2674.  But  the  FTCA’s  waiver  is
tempered  by  several  exceptions.  For  our  purposes,  the  relevant
exception is the “discretionary function exception” that withdraws the
waiver of sovereign immunity with regard to:

Any claim based upon . . . the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise
or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an
employee of the Government whether or not the discretion involved be abused.

identifying  the  contours  of  the

The  analytical  framework  of  the  discretionary  function  exception
has been laid out by the Supreme Court in a trilogy of cases — United
States v. S.A. Empresa de Viação Aérea Rio Grandense (Varig),  467
U.S. 797 (1984); Berkovitz v. United States, 486 U.S. 531 (1988); and
United States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315 (1991).

The  ﬁrst  issue  is  whether  “a  federal  statute,  regulation,  or  policy
speciﬁcally  prescribes  a  course  of  action  for  an  employee  to  follow.”
Berkovitz, 486 U.S. at 536. If so, the exception cannot apply. If not, the
question  is  whether  the  governmental  action  or  inaction  “is  of  the
kind that the discretionary function exception was designed to shield.”
Id. If it is, the action constitutes the exercise of protected discretion,
and the United States is immune from suit.

The  touchstone  of  the  second  step  of  the  discretionary  function
test is susceptibility to policy analysis. As we have previously stated,
a  plaintiff’s  claim  can  only  survive  if  “the  challenged  actions  cannot
‘be grounded in the policy of the regulatory regime.’” Gotha,  115  F.3d
at  179.  The  Court  in  Gaubert  underscored  the  importance  of  the
relationship  between
the  discretionary  decision  and  policy
considerations,  noting  the  exception  applies  only  if  the  challenged
actions can “be said to be based on the purposes that the regulatory
regime seeks to accomplish.”

Before  proceeding  to  apply  the  discretionary  function  analysis  to
the facts of this case, there is one remaining preliminary issue — we
must identify the challenged action. In effect, plaintiff challenges the
National Park Service’s decisions concerning lighting and warning in
the Hospital Street lot.

As  noted,  the  ﬁrst  step  in  our  analysis  is  whether  there  was
discretion  over  the  challenged  action,  that  is,  whether  a  federal
regulation or policy speciﬁcally prescribes a course of action. Plaintiff
contends  the  National  Park  Service,  by  virtue  of  a  1985  agreement

with the Virgin Islands, had no discretion with respect to the Hospital
Street  lot.  According  to  the  plaintiff,  the  1985  Addendum  mandated
the removal of the Hospital Street lot by 1988, thereby eliminating any
National Park Service discretion.

The  District  Court  addressed  the  argument  in  two  ways.  First,  it
expressed  skepticism  that  the  1985  Addendum  constituted  the  kind
of  mandate  that  prevented  the  government’s  recourse  to  the
discretionary  function  exception.  Second,  it  held  the  plaintiff  did  not
allege negligence on the part of the National Park Service for failing to
close the parking lot, but rather for failing to provide adequate lighting
or to warn of known dangers associated with nighttime parking in the
lot.

Given the qualiﬁcation “subject to the availability of funds” [within
the  Addendum,  this]  does  not  appear  to  be  the  kind  of  express
mandate  that  precludes  coverage  by  the  discretionary  function
exception.  See,  e.g.,  Berkovitz,  486  U.S.  at  536  (“The  discretionary
function exception will not apply when a federal statute, regulation, or
policy  speciﬁcally  prescribes  a  course  of  action  for  an  employee  to
follow.”).  Here,  the  National  Park  Service’s  determination  whether
there  were  funds  available  seems  to  be  the  kind  of  judgment  or
choice inherent in the discretionary function exception.

But  we  need  not  determine  whether  the  1985  Addendum
eliminates the National Park Service’s discretion regarding the use of
the Hospital Street lot. We agree with the District Court that the 1985
Addendum  does  not  mandate  a  speciﬁc  course  of  conduct  and
cannot be dispositive with respect to lighting and warning decisions
in  the  Hospital  Street  lot.  The  lighting  and  warning  decisions  here,
therefore, remain discretionary.

But this does not end our inquiry. We must determine whether the
discretionary lighting and warning decisions are susceptible to policy
analysis  and  therefore  enjoy  the  protection  of  the  discretionary
function  exception.  See,  e.g.,  Gaubert,  499  U.S.  at  322-23  (“Even

assuming the challenged conduct involves an element of judgment, it
remains to be decided whether that judgment is of the kind that the
discretionary function exception was designed to shield.”).

The  National  Park  Service  contends

its  decisions  (or  non-
decisions)  not  to  add  lighting  nor  to  post  warning  signs  were
grounded  in  its  overarching  objective  of  returning  the  area  to  its
historic appearance. The government points to several documents to
ground  this  policy  concern.  First,  it  relies  on  the  original  1952
Memorandum of Agreement, which established the National Historic
Site  with  the  purpose  of  preserving  the  integrity  of  the  historic
structures  and  grounds.  It  also  points  to  a  1972  Memorandum  of
Agreement which recited that its “basic objective in the management
of  Christiansted  National  Historic  Site  is  to  retain  the  architectural
and  historical  integrity  of  the  structures  and  their  environment.”  The
National  Park  Service  also  argues  it  is  not  expressly  required  to  add
lighting or post warning signs in the Hospital Street lot.

The  National  Park  Service’s  arguments  are  inapposite.  It  may  be
arguable  that  the  initial  decision  to  maintain  parking  at  the  Hospital
Street lot was protected by the discretionary function exception. But
assuming  this  were  so,  subsequent  decisions  concerning  the
Hospital  Street  lot  were  not  necessarily  protected.  See,  e.g.,  Indian
Towing  Co.,  Inc.  v.  United  States,  350  U.S.  61  (1955);  George  v.
United States, 735 F. Supp. 1524 (M.D. Ala. 1990).

Indian  Towing  involved  alleged  negligence  by  the  United  States
Coast  Guard  in  its  failure  to  properly  maintain  the  light  on  a
lighthouse  it  had  established.  Despite  the  Coast  Guard’s  claim  of
sovereign immunity, the Court found the United States could be held
liable  under  the  FTCA  for  the  negligent  operation  of  the  lighthouse
even  though  the  initial  decision  to  establish  a  lighthouse  was
discretionary. The Court explained:

The  Coast  Guard  need  not  undertake  the  lighthouse  service.  But  once  it
exercised its discretion to operate a light on Chandeleur Island and engendered

reliance on the guidance afforded by the light, it was obligated to use due care
to  make  certain  that  the  light  was  kept  in  good  working  order;  and,  if  the  light
did  become  extinguished,  then  the  Coast  Guard  was  further  obligated  to  use
due care to discover this fact and to repair the light or give warning that it was
not  functioning.  If  the  Coast  Guard  failed  in  its  duty  and  damage  was  thereby
caused to petitioners, the United States is liable under the Tort Claims Act.

Indian Towing Co., 350 U.S. at 69.

In  George,  a  District  Court  rejected  the  National  Forest  Service’s
attempt  to  invoke  the  discretionary  function  exception  when  Mr.
George was attacked by an alligator while swimming in a recreational
swimming area designated by the Forest Service. The court held that
although  the  decision  to  establish  the  swimming  area  was
discretionary,  the  subsequent  failure  to  warn  the  public  of  known
dangers was not covered by the exception.

Even  if  there  was  protected  discretion  for  the  National  Park
Service’s decision to maintain parking at the Hospital Street lot, that
does not answer whether subsequent decisions were also protected.
The  National  Park  Service  fails  to  show  how  providing  some
lighting,  but  not  more,  is  grounded  in  the  policy  objectives  with
respect to the management of the National Historic Site. Similarly, the
National Park Service has not presented a viable argument as to how
its alleged failure to warn is rooted in its policy objectives.

Accordingly,  we  see  no  tension  between  our  decision  and  those
reached in the cases cited. Under proper circumstances, the National
Park  Service  may  balance  aesthetic  and  safety  interests  and  avoid
liability  through  the  discretionary  function  exception.  To  properly
invoke an aesthetic interest, there must be a reasonable relationship
between that interest and the challenged action.

In  our  view,  plaintiff’s  suit  does  not  put  the  District  Court  in  the
position  of  second  guessing  a  National  Park  Service  administrative
decision  that  is  “grounded  in  social,  economic,  and  political  policy.”
We  are  unable  to  ﬁnd  a  rational  nexus  between  the  National  Park
Service’s  lighting  or  warning  decisions  (or  non-decisions)  and  social,

economic  and  political  concerns.  Nor  will  plaintiff’s  claim  seriously
impede the National Park Service’s proper functions or operations.

For  the  reasons  stated,  we  hold  the  discretionary  function
exception  does  not  apply  to  the  National  Park  Service’s  decisions
concerning  the  Hospital  Street  lot.  We  will  reverse  the  judgment  of
the  District  Court  and  remand  for  proceedings  consistent  with  this
opinion.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. FTCA and DFE.  The common law says that citizens cannot sue
the government in tort unless the government permits it. It used to be
that, at the federal government level, citizens hurt due to government
neglect would petition a local congressman to try to get a bill passed
by  Congress  permitting  their  particular  claim.  Eventually  Congress
decided  to  pass  a  broad  statutory  waiver  called  the  Federal  Tort
Claims Act (“FTCA”):

[T]he  district  courts  .  .  .  shall  have  exclusive  jurisdiction  of  civil
actions  on  claims  against  the  United  States,  for  money
damages  .  .  .  for  injury  or  loss  of  property,  or  personal  injury  or
death  caused  by  the  neglect  or  wrongful  act  or  omission  of  any
employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his
ofﬁce  or  employment,  under  circumstances  where  the  United
States,  if  a  private  person,  would  be  liable  to  the  claimant  in
accordance  with  the  law  of  the  place  where  the  act  or  omission
occurred.

28 U.S.C. §1346(b)(1) (2009). One major restriction on this waiver of
immunity  is  the  so-called  discretionary  function  exception  (“DFE”),
which  states  that  the  waiver  in  §1346(b)(1)  does  not  apply  to  any
claim  “based  upon  the  exercise  or  performance  or  the  failure  to
exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a

federal agency or an employee of the Government, whether or not the
discretion involved be abused.” 28 U.S.C. §2680(a) (2009).

2. Other Limitations on Federal Government Liability.  Other federal
statutes  make  clear  that,  even  for  claims  permitted  by  the  FTCA,
there  is  no  governmental  liability  for  pre-judgment  interest  or  for
punitive  damages.  Furthermore,  there  is  no  liability  for  strict  liability
torts  or  intentional  torts.  Finally,  all  suits  under  the  FTCA  are  within
the  federal  courts’  exclusive  subject  matter  jurisdiction,  and  the
claimant  is  not  entitled  to  a  jury  trial.  How  can  such  limitations  be
constitutional? Because the federal government need not permit any
suits  (and  none  were  permitted  at  common  law  when  the  U.S.
Constitution was adopted), and so such limitations are permissible. In
other words, it is only by the grace of the king that any suit at all may
be maintained.

3. Problems.  With regard to the following fact patterns, would the
challenged  actions  of  the  federal  government  likely  be  within  the
DFE’s exception (and thus immune)?

A. Assume there is a federal regulation that declares that no doctor
at  a  Veteran’s  Administration  hospital  may  work  more  than  20
hours in a day. The plaintiff is hurt when a tired VA doctor in her
23rd consecutive hour cuts an artery during surgery and kills the
patient. The local VA administrator permitted the doctor to work
that many hours despite the regulation because he felt that this
doctor  could  work  extraordinary  hours.  May  the  victim  sue  the
VA claiming the administrator’s decision was negligent?

B.  A  Bureau  of  Prisons  regulation  requires  that  all  exercise
equipment be checked on a regular cycle to ensure it is in good
working  order.  The  warden  at  a  Federal  Correctional  Institute
decides that an examination once a quarter will be sufﬁcient due
to  concerns  about  staff  resources.  A  prisoner  is  hurt  when  a
pull-down  bar  collapses.  This  bar  had  not  been  checked  since
the last quarterly cycle.

C.  A  postal  worker  driving  his  route  is  in  a  hurry  and  decides  to
speed through a school zone, neglecting to see a child step out
in front of him. He runs over the child.

2. State and Local Governments

law  has  applied  sovereign

While  the  common
immunity,  or
governmental immunity, to not only the federal government but also
to  state  and  local  governments,  there  have  been  some  important
differences. First, in many states the common law has evolved into a
dichotomy  between  governmental  vs.  proprietary  services  of  the
government. That is, when a state or local government is performing
a service or task that is considered governmental, immunity from suit
exists; however, it does not exist when the government is performing
in  a  proprietary  capacity.  In  at  least  some  states,  the  lack  of  a
is
coherent  way  to  determine  what
governmental  has  caused  some  wholesale  reexamination  of  the
immunity doctrine.

is  proprietary  and  what

CAMPBELL v. INDIANA
284 N.E. 733 (Ind. 1973)

         , J.

These  cases  were  consolidated  for  the  purposes  of  appeal.  The
facts  in  the  two  cases  are  somewhat  different,  but  the  outcome  of
both  is  dependent  on  the  same  question  of  law.  The  cases  were
decided  separately  in  the  Court  of  Appeals  and  were  consolidated
upon transfer to the Supreme Court.

In the Campbell case the appellants sustained personal injuries as
a  result  of  a  head-on  collision  with  an  automobile  traveling  in
appellant’s  lane  of  trafﬁc  upon  a  state-maintained  highway.  In  their

complaint  appellants  alleged  negligence  on  the  part  of  the  state  in
that, after repaving the highway, it failed to: (a) mark with a yellow line
the  aforesaid  State  Road  221  where  it  is  unsafe  to  pass;  and  (b)
carelessly  and  negligently  failed  to  install  no  passing  signs  along
Road 221 or any other signs indicating to the traveling public that the
public  highway  was  unsafe  for  passing.  Appellants  also  contended
that the road as maintained constituted a nuisance.

In the Knotts case, the appellant sued the City of Indianapolis and
the  State  of  Indiana  complaining  that  he  sustained  $100,000  in
damages because of personal injuries incurred as the result of a fall
on  a  crosswalk  in  Indianapolis.  Appellant  alleged  that  the  injuries
were the result of the negligent state of repair of the crosswalk. The
fall  occurred  on  the  crosswalk  at  the  intersection  of  Market  Street
and  Monument  Circle  in  Indianapolis.  Monument  Circle  is  a  part  of
the  state  highway  system  and  as  such,  the  State  of  Indiana  is
responsible  for  its  care  and  maintenance.  In  both  Campbell  and
Knotts  the  state  ﬁled  a  motion  to  dismiss  in  the  trial  court  alleging
that there was no basis upon which relief could be granted premised
upon the doctrine of sovereign immunity. In both cases the trial court
sustained  the  motion  and  the  Court  of  Appeals  afﬁrmed  the  rulings.
Thereafter, both appellants petitioned this court for transfer to resolve
the status of the doctrine of sovereign immunity in Indiana.

Both  the  Campbell  and  Knotts  briefs  raise  the  issue  of  whether
the  State  of  Indiana  still  recognizes  the  common  law  doctrine  of
sovereign immunity. The doctrine in its present form is a far cry from
the  original  common  law  principle  which  exempted  the  sovereign
from liability in court on the basis that “the king could do no wrong.”
The  doctrine  has  been  amended  and  eroded  until  the  most  that
remains is an abstract and confusing principle which ﬁnds literally no
continuity between jurisdictions. The purpose for which the doctrine
was  created  has  long  since  vanished  and  it  is  now  time  to  ﬁnally
reexamine the basis of the rule.

The  original  adoption  of  the  doctrine  in  America  following  the
Revolutionary  War  was  founded  on  the  premise  that  the  new
government  was  not  ﬁnancially  secure  enough  to  face  claims  of
negligence  in  its  governmental  activities.  Therefore,  the  English
Common Law was adopted and the same immunity which protected
the  King  from  liability  was  adopted  to  protect  the  states.  The  ﬁrst
inroad in Indiana to limit the doctrine occurred in the case of City  of
Goshen v. Myers (Ind. 1889), 21 N.E. 657, where the court held that:

In  our  opinion,  it  was  the  duty  of  the  city  of  Goshen  to  keep  the  bridge  under
consideration  in  repair.  The  public  bridges  within  the  limits  of  the  cities  of  the
State,  located  upon  the  streets  and  public  highways  of  the  cities — and  such
cities, where they take charge of the same, are liable to persons suffering injury
or loss.

Id. at 658-59.

Out  of  early  forms  of  municipal

liability  grew  the  current
governmental-proprietary  standard  which  has  been  applied  to  the
state and its subdivisions. This is in essence a court-made distinction
as  to  the  types  of  activities  which  governmental  bodies  perform,
created to ameliorate the harshness of total governmental immunity.
It  is  generally  held  that  if  a  governmental  body  is  negligent  in
performing  a  proprietary  function,  it  will  be  liable  for  its  negligence;
while,  if  its  activity  is  classiﬁed  as  governmental,  the  defense  of
sovereign immunity shall apply.

Exactly  what  constitutes  a  proprietary  function  as  opposed  to  a
governmental  function  has  never  been  clearly  enunciated  by  the
courts,  and  this  failure  to  establish  criteria  has  led  to  the  generally
confused state of the bench and bar in the application of the doctrine
of sovereign immunity. Deciding on useful guidelines between rather
obscure,  whimsical  notions  enunciated  by  the  appellate  courts
throughout the country has caused enormous conflicts in the courts
in the past decade. However, the fact that the doctrine is beyond the
scope of explicit deﬁnition has not halted its application. In the case

of  Flowers  v.  Board  of  Commissioners  of  County  of  Vanderburgh
(Ind.  1960),  168  N.E.2d  224,  this  court  held,  in  regard  to  appellant
recovering  for  injuries  sustained  in  a  skating  rink  operated  by  the
county  and  for  use  of  which  admission  was  charged,  [that  the
defendant  was
its  activity  was
liable  to  the  plaintiff  because
proprietary rather than governmental in nature].

Further erosion of the doctrine followed in the case of Brinkman v.
City  of  Indianapolis  (Ind.  1967),  231  N.E.2d  169,  in  which  the
Appellate  Court  abolished  the  right  of  a  city  to  claim  the  defense  of
sovereign immunity regardless of whether the nature of the act was
governmental or proprietary. The court reasoned:

rule,  however,  often  produces

The  governmental-proprietary
legalistic
distinctions that are only remotely related to the fundamental considerations of
municipal tort responsibility. As for example, it does not seem to be good policy
to permit the chance that a school building may or may not be producing rental
income at the time determine whether a victim may recover for a fall into a dark
and unguarded basement stairway or elevator shaft. Neither does it seem to be
good policy to ﬁnd that a municipal garbage truck is engaged in a nonimmune
proprietary  function  when  en  route  from  a  wash  rack  to  the  garage  while  the
same truck is engaged in an immune governmental function when enroute to a
garbage pickup.

in  unbearable  cost  to  the  public

The  extent  to  which  a  municipal  corporation  should  be  held  liable  for  torts
committed  by  its  ofﬁcers  or  employees  in  the  course  of  the  employment  is  a
perplexing problem that has been the subject of litigation on many occasions.
There  has  been  a  general  apprehension  that  fraud  and  excessive  litigation
would  result
in  the  event  municipal
corporations were treated as ordinary persons for purposes of tort liability. On
the other hand, the unfairness to the innocent victim of a principle of complete
tort  immunity  and  the  social  desirability  of  spreading  the  loss — a  trend  now
evident  in  many  ﬁelds — have  been  often  advanced  as  arguments  in  favor  of
extending the scope of liability. It is doubtful whether the purposes of tort law
are  well  served  by  either  the  immunity  rule  or  its  exceptions.  After  careful
consideration  we  are  of  the  opinion  that  the  doctrine  of  sovereign  immunity
has  no  proper  place  in  the  administration  of  a  municipal  corporation.”
(Emphasis added)

Id. at 172.

The next logical step was taken in the case of Klepinger v. Board
of Commissioners (Ind. 1968), 239 N.E.2d 160. The court abrogated
immunity for all counties in Indiana. In the aftermath of Klepinger  all
that  remained  was  immunity  to  the  state.  The  court  in  Klepinger
made it clear that the governmental-proprietary distinction was to be
completely disregarded in cases involving city or county immunity.

In  Perkins  v.  State  (1969),  252  Ind.  549,  251  N.E.2d  30,  the
Supreme Court utilized the governmental-proprietary function to limit
the  application  of  the  doctrine  on  the  state  level.  In  Perkins,  the
appellants fell ill due to the contamination of a lake with raw sewage.
They  had  rented  a  lakeside  cottage  in  a  state  park  for  which  the
maintenance  thereof  was  the  duty  of  the  state.  The  trial  court
sustained the state’s motion to dismiss on the ground that the court
did not have jurisdiction due to the sovereign immunity of the state.
The  Supreme  Court  reversed,  holding  that  such  operation  was  a
proprietary  activity,  and,  therefore,  the  state  could  not  avail  itself  of
the  immunity  privilege.  Following  the  holding  in  Perkins,  all  that
remained  of  sovereign  immunity  was  immunity  on  the  part  of  the
state  from  negligent  acts  occurring  while  the  state  was
in
performance  of  a  solely  “governmental  function.”  Exactly  what  a
governmental function constituted was not yet clearly deﬁned.

With  only  a  mere  fraction  of  the  original  doctrine  remaining,  we
are  faced  with  the  task  of  attempting  to  eliminate  the  confusion
surrounding the doctrine.

The argument has been presented that elimination of the doctrine
of sovereign immunity will impose a disastrous ﬁnancial burden upon
the  state.  Assuming  there  is  any  relevancy  to  this  contention,  we
point out that the abrogation of sovereign immunity on the state level
is consistent with conditions already existing in cities and counties in
this  state.  If  city  and  county  governments  can  withstand  the

consequences  of  such  liability,  where  trafﬁc  hazards  seemingly  are
greater, the state should be able to also bear such burden.

We  may  also  add  that  the  elimination  of  sovereign  immunity
means  a  more  equitable  distribution  of  losses  in  society  caused  by
the  government  unto  members  of  society,  rather  than  forcing
individuals to face the total loss of the injury.

The state argues that abolition of sovereign immunity will result in
a great number of problems for the state. Inability to collect payment
for claims against the state, inability of the state to secure adequate
insurance,  and  prospective  legal  chaos  are  cited  as  examples  of
some of these problems. The arguments which the state presents are
questions  which  properly  belong  to  the  legislature  in  facing  and
solving the problems of liability.

We do not mean to say by this opinion that all governmental units
can  be  held  liable  for  any  and  all  acts  or  omissions  which  might
cause  damage  to  persons.  For  example,  one  may  not  claim  a
recovery  because  a  city  or  state  failed  to  provide  adequate  police
protection to prevent crime. Simpson’s Food Fair v. City of Evansville
(Ind. 1971), 272 N.E.2d 871. Nor may one recover damages because a
state  ofﬁcial  made  an  appointment  of  an
individual  whose
incompetent  performance  gives  rise  to  a  suit  alleging  negligence  on
the  part  of  the  state  ofﬁcial  for  making  such  an  appointment.
Likewise, the United States Supreme Court has recognized a judicial
immunity. Pierson v. Ray (1967), 386 U.S. 547. On this subject matter
Professor Prosser, in his treatise, stated the following:

At  the  very  outset  it  was  more  or  less  obvious  that  some  vestige  of  the
governmental immunity must be retained. It was, for example unthinkable that
either state [or] a municipality should be held liable for a wrong decision of its
courts, for an erroneous evaluation of property by a tax assessor. In several of
the  decisions  abrogating  the  immunities,  there  was  language  used  which
reserved  the  possibility  that  there  might  still  be  immunity  as  to  “legislative”  or
“judicial” functions, or as to acts or omissions of government employees which
were “discretionary.”

Prosser, Law of Torts §131, at 986 (4th ed. 1971.)

Therefore,  it  appears  that  in  order  for  one  to  have  standing  to
recover in a suit against the state there must have been a breach of
duty owed to a private individual.

Finding no basis for the continuation of the doctrine of sovereign
immunity as applicable to the state any more than it is applicable to
municipal corporations and counties, we hold that such a defense by
the state is not available to any greater extent than it is now available
to municipal corporations and counties of this state. Judgment of the
trial  court  is  reversed  with  directions  to  vacate  by  ruling  on  the
motion to dismiss in each case and to enter an order overruling such
motion and for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Proprietary  vs.  Governmental.   Though  Indiana  repudiated  this
common  law  distinction,  many  states  still  retain  the  rule  that
immunity  at  the  state  and  local  level  exists  for  governmental
functions  but  not  proprietary  functions.  The  standard  for  judging
between  the  two  is  often  vague.  For  example,  here  is  one  court’s
articulation  of  the  test:  “[W]hether  in  providing  such  services,  the
governmental  entity
is  exercising  the  powers  and  duties  of
government conferred by law for the general beneﬁt and well being of
its citizens.” Edwards v. City of Portsmouth, 375 S.E.2d 747, 750 (Va.
1989).  This
little
predictability in deciding, for example, whether an ambulance service
run  by  a  municipality  is  proprietary  or  governmental.  In  such  states
where  this  dichotomy  still  prevails,  one  can  only  be  safe  in  ﬁnding
published decisions that are on point.

incredibly  nebulous  test  that  affords

is  an

2.  Statutory  Waiver  at  the  State/Local  Level.   Even  for  activities
that are governmental, a state might have statutes that permit partial
waivers of immunity. Unlike the FTCA, which provides a broad waiver

of  immunity  subject  to  some  exceptions  (like  the  DFE),  most  states
retain  a  broad  immunity  with  statutes  that  provide  limited  waivers.
For example, many state waivers of immunity apply where someone’s
injury  arises  out  of  the  state  government’s  use  of  real  or  personal
property.  Much  litigation  ensues,  of  course,  over  what  such  phrases
actually mean. Again, it is imperative to resort to the decisional law of
such jurisdictions to understand the application of such statutes.

B. Spousal and Parental Immunity

At  common  law,  one  spouse  was  not  permitted  to  sue  the  other  in
tort. In application, this rule of law was applied if the tort claim arose
during the marriage or if the spouses were married at the time of the
lawsuit’s ﬁling. So entrenched was this rule that even after the demise
of  the  original  justiﬁcation — that  the  wife  was  indistinct  from  her
husband — courts  continued  to  apply  this  doctrine  based  upon  new
justiﬁcations.  In  most  states,  this  immunity  has  been  abolished,  in
whole or in part, for reasons similar to those set forth below in Price.
The court’s discussion and abandonment of the doctrine exempliﬁes
the  process  by  which  an  antiquated  tort  doctrine  eventually  passes
away. With respect to parental immunity, though the doctrine has less
bite  than  it  used  to  have,  most  courts  continue  to  recognize  some
vitality  in  the  limited  doctrine.  As  you  read  the  next  two  cases,
consider  why  most  courts  have  rejected  spousal  immunity  but
continue to give credence to some level of parental immunity.

1. Spousal Immunity

PRICE v. PRICE
732 S.W.2d 316 (Tex. 1987)

          , J.

This  case  presents  us  with  the  opportunity  to  re-examine  the
validity of the doctrine of interspousal immunity. The case originated
as  a  civil  action  of  negligence  for  personal  injuries  brought  by
Kimberly  Parmenter  Price  against  her  husband,  Duane  Price.  Duane
Price’s  motion  for  summary  judgment  was  granted.  The  court  of
appeals  afﬁrmed  that  judgment.  We  reverse  the  judgment  of  the
court of appeals and remand this cause to the trial court.

In July of 1983, Kimberly Parmenter, at the time a feme sole, was
injured  when  a  motorcycle  on  which  she  was  riding  collided  with  a
truck.  The  motorcycle  was  driven  by  Duane  Price.  Six  months  after
the  accident,  Duane  and  Kimberly  were  married.  After  marriage,
Kimberly  brought  this  action  seeking  recovery  from  her  husband,
Duane, and from the driver of the truck, claiming that the negligence
of  these  drivers  had  caused  her  injuries.  The  driver  of  the  truck  and
his  employer  settled.  The  trial  court,  in  granting  summary  judgment
for  Duane,  relied  on  the  doctrine  that  one  spouse  could  not  sue
another for negligent conduct.

The  doctrine  of  interspousal  immunity  is  a  part  of  the  common
law,  having  been  judicially  created.  Its  origins  are  shrouded  in
antiquity, but the basis of the doctrine is “that a husband and wife are
one  person.”  Firebrass  v.  Pennant,  2  Wils.  255,  256  (C.P.  1764)
(emphasis in original).

A woman’s disability during coverture was an essential ingredient
in  fostering  the  doctrine.  As  was  stated  in  Thompson  v.  Thompson,
218 U.S. 611, 614-15 (1910):

At  common  law  the  husband  and  wife  were  regarded  as  one, — the  legal
existence of the wife during coverture being merged in that of the husband; and,
generally  speaking,  the  wife  was  incapable  of  making  contracts,  of  acquiring
property  or  disposing  of  the  same  without  her  husband’s  consent.  They  could
not  enter  into  contracts  with  each  other,  nor  were  they  liable  for  torts
committed by one against the other (emphasis added).

An  earlier  thesis  on  American  law  expanded  the  concept  of
superiority  of  the  husband  over  the  wife  even  to  the  extent  of
restraining  her  liberty  or  disciplining  her.  2  Kent’s  Com.  174  (8th  ed.
1854).  While  in  this,  the  last  quarter  of  the  twentieth  century,  such
views  seem  preposterous,  recognition  that  those  views  were
prevalent in the law makes easily understandable why suits by wives
against husbands were not permitted.

However,  the  husband/wife  unity  argument  as  grounds  for  the
doctrine was severely impeded by the adoption of what were known
as Married Women Acts. These legislative acts occurred principally in
the  latter  half  of  the  nineteenth  century  and  early  twentieth  century.
These acts, while varying from state to state, generally gave wives the
rights  to  own,  acquire  and  dispose  of  property;  to  contract;  and,  to
sue  in  respect  to  their  property  and  contracts.  Most  importantly,
many  of  the  statutes  speciﬁcally  abolished  the  doctrine  of  the
oneness of husband and wife.

jurisdictions,

With the demise of the legal ﬁction of the merger of husband and
wife into a single entity, the doctrine of interspousal immunity found
support in considerations of marital harmony, as well as the potential
for  collusive
lawsuits.  Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts  §895F,
comment d (1979).
American

in  upholding  the  doctrine,  early  on
espoused the premise that a civil suit by one spouse against another
would  destroy  the  harmony  of  the  home.  One  court,  in  a  ﬁre  and
brimstone  opinion  upholding  the  prohibition  against  suits  between
spouses, foresaw all manner of evil should the immunity doctrine be
terminated.  In  Ritter  v.  Ritter,  31  Pa.  396  (1858),  that  court,  while
observing  that  a  favorite  maxim  at  common  law  was  that  marriage
makes a man and woman one person at law, also said:

Nothing  could  so  complete  that  severance  [of  the  marriage  relationship]  and
degradation,  as  to  throw  open  litigation  to  the  parties.  The  maddest  advocate
for woman’s rights, and for the abolition on earth of all divine institutions, could
wish  for  no  more  decisive  blow  from  the  courts  than  this.  The  flames  which

litigation would kindle on the domestic hearth would consume in an instant the
conjugal bond, and bring on a new era indeed — an era of universal discord, of
unchastity, of bastardy, of dissoluteness, of violence, cruelty, and murders.

The second argument for barring interspousal suits, the possibility
of  collusive  lawsuits,  is  entirely  inconsistent  with  the  subjugation  of
wife  to  husband  and  preservation  of  happy  homes  theses.
Nevertheless, such inconsistency did not seem to trouble the courts.
The possibility of collusion was alluded to in Abbott v. Abbott, 67 Me.
304  (1877),  where  it  was  suggested  that  a  widow  could  raid  her
deceased  husband’s  estate  by  claiming  all  sorts  of  wrongs  by  him
during  his  lifetime.  The  fraud  theory  expanded  into  vogue  with  the
advent of insurance to cover vehicular accidents. In Newton v. Weber,
119  Misc.  Rep.  240,  196  NYS  113,  114  (1922),  the  court  said  of
allowing  a  tort  action  by  a  wife  against  her  husband,  “the
maintenance  of  an  action  of  this  character,  unless  the  sole  purpose
be  a  raid  upon  an  insurance  company,  would  not  add  to  conjugal
happiness and unison.”

Without  ascribing  any  reasons  for  doing  so,  Texas  adopted  the
in
doctrine  of
Nickerson  and  Matson  v.  Nickerson,  65  Tex.  281  (1886).  Nickerson
barred all civil actions for tort between husband and wife.

immunity  one  hundred  years  ago

interspousal

The  doctrine  remained  ﬁrmly  established  as  Texas  law  until
Bounds v. Caudle, 560 S.W.2d 925 (Tex. 1977). Bounds abrogated the
rule as to intentional torts. In Bounds, this court concluded that suits
for  willful  or  intentional  torts  would  not  disrupt  domestic  tranquility
since “the peace and harmony of a home” which had “been strained
to  the  point  where  an  intentional  physical  attack  could  take  place”
could not be further impaired by allowing a suit to recover damages.

Is  there  today  any  policy  justiﬁcation  for  retaining  this  feudal
concept  of  the  rights  of  parties  to  a  marriage?  Apparently,  our
colleagues  on  the  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  have  decided  “no”  in

respect to the marital discord argument. The Fourth Court of Appeals
questioned the justiﬁcation of the policy when it observed:

While  the  new  legislation  [the  Married  Women  Acts]  forced  recognition  of  the
rights  of  a  married  woman  to  recover  from  her  husband  if  he  broke  the  leg  of
her  mule,  the  courts  continued  to  clothe  him  with  immunity  if  he  tortiously
broke his wife’s leg.

It has never been satisfactorily explained how permitting the wife to recover
for  her  husband’s  conduct  which  tortiously  injures  her  property  would  not
disrupt domestic harmony, while allowing her to recover for bodily injury would.

Sneed v. Sneed, 705 S.W.2d 392, 394 (Tex. App. — San Antonio 1986,
writ ref’d n.r.e.).

Dean  William  Prosser,  a  preeminent  commentator  on  tort  law,

certainly agreed that the doctrine is indefensible. He has stated:

Stress has been laid upon the danger of ﬁctitious and fraudulent claims, on the
very dubious assumption that a wife’s love for her husband is such that she is
more  likely  to  bring  a  false  suit  against  him  than  a  genuine  one;  and  likewise,
the possibility of trivial actions for minor annoyances, which might well be taken
care  of  by  ﬁnding  consent  to  all  ordinary  ﬁctions  of  wedlock — or  at  least
assumption of risk! The chief reason relied upon by all these courts, however, is
that personal tort actions between husband and wife would disrupt and destroy
the peace and harmony of the home, which is against the policy of the law. This
is on the bald theory that after a husband has beaten his wife, there is a state of
peace and harmony left to be disturbed; and that if she is sufﬁciently injured or
angry  to  sue  him  for  it,  she  will  be  soothed  and  deterred  from  reprisals  by
denying her the legal remedy.

Prosser, Law of Torts, §122 at 863 (4th ed. 1971). While it is true that
part of this quote involves intentional rather than negligent torts, the
arguments  in  favor  of  interspousal  immunity  are  generally  equally
applicable,  and  lacking,  as  to  both.  It  is  difﬁcult  to  fathom  how
denying  a  forum  for  the  redress  of  any  wrong  could  be  said  to
encourage domestic tranquility. It is equally difﬁcult to see how suits
based  in  tort  would  destroy  domestic  tranquility,  while  property  and
contract actions do not.

As  to  the  potential  for  fraud  and  collusion,  we  are  unable  to
distinguish  interspousal  suits  from  other  actions  for  personal  injury.
In  Whitworth  v.  Bynum,  699  S.W.2d  194,  197  (Tex.  1985),  this  court
“refuse[d]  to  indulge  in  the  assumption  that  close  relatives  will
prevaricate  so  as  to  promote  a  spurious  lawsuit.”  Our  system  of
justice is capable of ascertaining the existence of fraud and collusion.
The  Supreme  Court  of  West  Virginia,  abolishing  the  rule
in
Coffindaffer v. Coffindaffer, 244 S.E.2d 338, 343 (1978), stated:

Anyone who has confronted insurance defense counsel in personal injury cases
knows that it is a rare occasion when the false or collusive claim escapes their
searching examination. We do an injustice not only to the intelligence of jurors,
but  to  the  efﬁcacy  of  the  adversary  system,  when  we  express  undue  concern
over  the  quantum  of  collusive  or  meritless  lawsuits.  There  is,  to  be  sure,  a
difference between the ability to ﬁle a suit and to achieve a successful result. It
is  upon  the  anvil  of  litigation  that  the  merit  of  a  case  is  ﬁnally  determined.
Forged in the heat of trial, few but the meritorious survive.

In  regards  to  both  the  domestic  tranquility  and  fraud  arguments,
Prosser and Dean Page Keeton have said “almost no legal writer has
had any use for these arguments, and under repeated criticisms and
reiterated attacks on them in the courts, judicial perception of these
arguments  has  slowly  shifted.”  W.  Prosser  &  P.  Keeton,  Law  of  Torts
§122 at 902 (5th ed. 1984).

Other  jurisdictions  have  preceded  us  in  either  completely  or

partially abolishing the doctrine of interspousal immunity.

The  doctrine  of  interspousal  immunity  has  previously  been
abrogated  as  to  some  causes  of  action  in  this  jurisdiction.  We  now
abolish that doctrine completely as to any cause of action. We do not
limit  our  holding  to  suits  involving  vehicular  accidents  only,  as  has
been  done  by  some  jurisdictions  and  as  has  been  urged  upon  us  in
this  case.  To  do  so  would  be  to  negate  meritorious  claims  such  as
was  presented  in  Stafford  v.  Stafford,  726  S.W.2d  14  (Tex.  1987).  In
that  case  a  husband  had  transmitted  a  venereal  disease  to  his  wife,
resulting in an infection that ultimately caused Mrs. Stafford the loss

of  her  ovaries  and  fallopian  tubes,  ending  for  all  time  her  ability  to
bear  children.  While  we  ruled  for  her,  the  issue  of  interspousal
immunity had not been preserved for our review. To leave in place a
bar  to  suits  like  that  of  Mrs.  Stafford  or  other  suits  involving  non-
vehicular  torts  would  amount  to  a  repudiation  of  the  constitutional
guarantee of equal protection of the laws. This we will not do.

Our  result  today  is  compelled  by  the  fundamental  proposition  of
public  policy  that  the  courts  should  afford  redress  for  a  wrong,  and
the  failure  of  the  rationale  supporting  the  doctrine  to  withstand
scrutiny.  We  therefore  reverse  the  judgment  of  the  court  of  appeals
upholding the trial court’s summary judgment, and remand this cause
to the trial court for further proceedings.

2. Parental Immunity

SANDOVAL v. SANDOVAL
623 P.2d 800 (Az. 1981)

       , J.

We  must  answer  the  following  question  on  appeal:  Does  the
parental immunity doctrine, as it presently exists in Arizona, bar a suit
by a minor child against his parents for negligence in leaving a gate
open through which the minor child drove his tricycle and was injured
by a passing automobile?

On  22  January  1977,  four-year-old  Ramero  Sandoval  rode  his
tricycle  from  his  front  yard  into  the  street  in  front  of  his  home  and
was  run  over  by  an  automobile  driven  by  Mr.  Noe  Perez  Lopez.
Ordinarily,  the  gate  to  the  fenced  front  yard  is  closed  and  the  child
rides  his  tricycle  inside  the  yard,  but  in  this  case  the  child’s  father,
Antonio  Sandoval,  negligently  forgot  to  close  the  gate  when  he  left
the house prior to the accident.

Mr. Perez was an uninsured motorist. The parents of Ramero did
not  have  uninsured  motorist  insurance,  but  did  have  a  homeowner’s
insurance  policy  which  they  believed  would  pay  a  judgment  that
might be obtained by the minor child against the parents.

The child, through his guardian ad litem, ﬁled a complaint against
injuries  was  their
his  parents  alleging  that  the  cause  of  his
negligence.  The  superior  Court  of  Maricopa  County  granted  the
parents’  motion  for  summary  judgment  based  upon  the  doctrine  of
parental immunity.

The  principles  of  parental  immunity  were  formulated  in  the
landmark case of Hewlett v. George (Ragsdale), 9 So. 885 (1891). In
that  case  the  Mississippi  Supreme  Court  stated  the  following
rationale:

The peace of society, and of the families composing society, and a sound public
policy,  designed  to  subserve  the  repose  of  families  and  the  best  interests  of
society, forbid to the minor child a right to appear in court in the assertion of a
claim to civil redress for personal injuries suffered at the hands of the parent.

This case has been followed by a majority of state courts because
of  the  need  to  preserve  family  unity  and  prevent  collusion  between
family  members  against  their  insurance  companies.  However,  with
the  advent  of  the  automobile  and  the  increasing  presence  of
insurance,  a  minority  of
jurisdictions  has  abrogated  parental
immunity  where  the  minor  has  been  injured  as  a  result  of  the
negligent driving of a parent. E.g., Hebel v. Hebel, 435 P.2d 8 (Alaska
1967); Briere v. Briere, 224 A.2d 588 (N.H. 1966); Goller v. White, 122
N.W.2d  193  (Wisc.  1963).  Prior  to  1970,  Arizona  clearly  followed
Hewlett, supra, see Purcell v. Frazer, 435 P.2d 736 (1967), but in 1970
we overruled Purcell, and partially abrogated the immunity doctrine in
the  case  of  Streenz  v.  Streenz,  471  P.2d  282  (Az.  1970).  Both  the
Purcell  and  Streenz  cases
in
automobile  accidents  through  the  negligent  driving  of  a  parent.  Our
two  reasons  for  abrogating  parental  immunity  in  Streenz  were:  (1)

involved  minor  children

injured

That  the  common  law  has  long  allowed  suits  by  a  child  against  a
parent  in  property  and  contract  actions.  Therefore,  it  is  reasonable
that the law should protect the rights of the child in a personal injury
action as well. (2) The existence of liability insurance to compensate
the  plaintiff,  particularly  in  automobile  accident  cases,  negates  the
possibility of disrupting family unity. After balancing the potential for
disruptive  suits  against  the  need  to  compensate  injured  parties,  we
held that the minor child could sue her parents for injuries sustained
through  the  negligent  driving  of  her  mother.  We  did  not,  however,
abolish the doctrine in its entirety. We stated:

Our  holding  today  is  not  a  total  abrogation  of  the  parental  immunity  doctrine.
Rather we agree . . . that “the role of paterfamilias should not be usurped by the
judiciary  as  to  intrafamilial  activities  involving  parental  discipline,  care  and
control.”

In  Streenz  we  cited  with  approval  Goller  v.  White,  supra,  which
held  that  parents  would  not  be  immune  from  suit  in  personal  injury
actions  brought  by  their  children  against  them  except  in  two
situations:

(1)  Where  the  alleged  negligent  act  involves  an  exercise  of  parental  authority
over  the  child;  and  (2)  where  the  alleged  negligent  act  involves  an  exercise  of
ordinary  parental  discretion  with  respect  to  the  provision  of  food,  clothing,
housing, medical and dental services, and other care. Goller v. White, supra, 20
Wis. 2d at 413, 122 N.W.2d at 198.

In  Streenz  we  also  cited  with  approval  a  later  case  of  the  same
Wisconsin court. Lemmen v. Servais, 158 N.W.2d 341 (Wisc. 1968). In
Lemmen, a child was injured when she was struck by a car after she
alighted from a school bus. The child sued the driver of the car, who
then  ﬁled  a  third-party  claim  against  the  parents  for  contribution  to
any recovery obtained by the child. The basis of the driver’s claim was
that  the  parents  were  negligent  in  failing  to  properly  instruct  their
child on safety procedures in crossing the street. The court held that
the  second  exception  stated  in  Goller,  supra,  applied  to  make  the

parents  immune  from  suit,  because  they  were  acting  within  their
discretion  as  parents  with  respect  to  the  “other  care”  of  their  child.
The court stated:

The two exceptions set forth in Goller are directed toward preserving, fostering
and maintaining a proper and wholesome parent-child relationship in a family.
The  immunity  granted  by  these  two  exceptions  is  accorded  the  parent,  not
because he is a parent, but because as a parent he pursues a course within the
family constellation which society exacts of him and which is beneﬁcial to the
state.  The  parental  nonliability  is  not  granted  as  a  reward,  but  as  a  means  of
enabling the parents to discharge the duties which society exacts.

Lemmen, at 343-344.

In  Streenz,  we  did  not  delineate  precisely  the  areas  in  which
parental  immunity  would  continue  to  be  a  bar  to  suit  by  a  minor  for
the  negligence  of  his  parents,  though  it  is  apparent  that  automobile
cases  are  ones  in  which  the  doctrine  of  parental  immunity  is
abolished.  This,  however,  is  not  an  automobile  case  in  the  usual
sense in that the parent’s obligation did not arise out of his driving of
an automobile. The direct cause of Ramero’s injuries was the impact
of  the  Perez  automobile,  not  the  act  of  leaving  the  gate  open.  We
distinguish  this  act  from  the  act  of  the  parents  in  Streenz,  supra,  in
which the parent, as a driver, had a duty to the world at large to drive
carefully.  If  an  accident  resulted  because  of  the  parent’s  negligent
driving, any passenger in the vehicle could have been injured, and the
driver  should  be  liable  to  that  passenger  regardless  of  the  fact  that
the passenger is the child of the driver.

A  case  with  similar  facts  is  the  Illinois  case  of  Cummings  v.
Jackson,  372  N.E.2d  1127  (Ill.  App.  1978).  There  the  parent,  in
violation of a city ordinance, failed to trim the trees between the edge
of the street and the parent’s property line. This obstructed the view
of a driver who ran over the minor child. The Illinois Court of Appeals
stated:

[A] suit charging a breach of a duty owed the general public is not as disruptive
to  a  family  unity  as  one  charging  breach  of  duty  owed  primarily  to  family
members and thus bringing into contention the inner workings of the family.

In  the  instant  case  the  duty  alleged  to  have  been  breached  by  the  mother
concerned  the  maintenance  of  trees  on  the  area  immediately  adjacent  to  the
home.  The  duty  was  owed  primarily  to  the  general  public,  however,  and  only
incidentally  to  the  members  of  the  family  living  in  the  house.  Although  the
question is a close one, we conclude that the injury to plaintiff was not alleged
to arise out of the family relationship.

372 N.E.2d at 1128.

We  believe  that  Cummings  is  distinguishable  from  the  instant
case  in  that  the  mother  had  a  duty  to  the  public  (imposed  by  city
ordinance) to keep the trees trimmed, and insofar as her failure was
the proximate cause of the minor child’s injuries, she could be liable.
In  the  instant  case,  the  closing  of  the  gate  was  a  duty  owed  to  the
child alone and a part of the parental “care and control” or “other care”
to be provided by the parents.

The familial obligations imposed by nature because of the parental relationship,
imperfect though they may sometimes be because of the ever present common
denominator  of  human  behavior,  are  quite  distinct  from  the  general  obligation
which the law imposes upon every one in all his relations to his fellow men, and
for the breach of which it gives a remedy.

A new and heavy burden would be added to the responsibility and privilege
of  parenthood,  if  within  the  wide  scope  of  daily  experiences  common  to  the
upbringing  of  children  a  parent  could  be  subjected  to  a  suit  for  damages  for
each failure to exercise care and judgment commensurate with the risk.

Lemmen v. Servais, Id. 344.

Regrettably,  the  injured  child  may  be  foreclosed  from  recovery.
Assuming the driver was negligent, the lack of recovery results more
from the fact that the driver of the automobile which injured the child
was uninsured than from the fact of parental immunity. We hold that
the  act  of  leaving  a  gate  open  should  not  subject  the  plaintiff’s

parents  to  suit  and  that  the  trial  court  properly  granted  summary
judgment to the defendants.

We  do  not,  by  this  case,  limit  the  abrogation  of  the  parental
immunity doctrine to automobile negligence cases. We will continue
to  consider,  on  a  case  by  case  basis,  the  actual  cause  of  the  injury
and whether the act of the parent breached a duty owed to the world
at  large,  as  opposed  to  a  duty  owed  to  a  child  within  the  family
sphere.

Judgment afﬁrmed.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Abrogation of Spousal Immunity.  In the vast majority of states,
spousal  immunity  no  longer  exists.  The  doctrine’s  original  rationale
was  conceptual  and  based  upon  a  legal  ﬁction — that  the  husband
and  wife  were  one  person  (i.e.,  the  husband).  While  that  flawed
premise eventually became too obvious to ignore, courts continued to
recognize the doctrine based upon one of two inconsistent premises:
(1) that the suit was a legitimate legal dispute between the spouses
and would destroy the marriage; or (2) that the suit was a fraudulent
attempt to reach into the pockets of an insurance policy. Why did the
court  in  Price  determine  that  neither  of  these  arguments  supported
the doctrine any longer?

2. Partial Abrogation of Parental Immunity.  Courts have frequently
mentioned  similar  concerns  regarding  a  child’s  suit  against  her
parent — disruption to family harmony and the potential for insurance
fraud.  Yet  notwithstanding  this  similarity,  most  courts  continue  to
recognize at least a limited version of the parental immunity doctrine.
Notice in Sandoval that the court makes a distinction between cases
involving  negligent  driving  or  negligent  tree  maintenance  and  those
involving  alleged  negligent  supervision  of  the  children.  Given  this

distinction, what seems to be the remaining concern with completely
abrogating parental immunity?

3. Parental Discipline Privilege and Immunity.  The Sandoval  court
was  concerned  with  whether  a  negligence  claim  might  still  be
covered  by  immunity.  When  a  parent  spanks  a  child  or  places  the
child  in  “time  out,”  what  prevents  the  child  from  suing  for  an
intentional  tort?  Courts  have  long  held  that  there  is  a  privilege  or
immunity  for  such  conduct — that  would  otherwise  qualify  as  an
intentional  tort — so  long  as  it  involves  the  good  faith  use  of
reasonable  force  or  imposition  of  punishment  in  a  way  that  is
necessary  to  control,  train,  and  educate  the  child.  As  one  court
described this immunity to discipline:

Not  every  spanking  is  a  battery  and  not  every  “time  out”  in  one’s
bedroom  is  a  false  imprisonment.  The  parent’s  prerogative  to
exercise authority and attend to a child’s needs must be exercised
within  reasonable  limits.  When  her  conduct  so  far  exceeds  the
discharging  of  normal  parental  duties  and  responsibilities,  the
public policies of peace, tranquility and discipline in the home are
no longer served by this doctrine of immunity.

Brozdowski v. Southern Conn. Gas Co., 192 Conn. Super. LEXIS 2534
(Conn.  Sup.  1992).  In  extreme  cases  of  unreasonable  punishments,
neither the court nor agencies of the state have a problem declaring
the  conduct  extreme  and  wrongful  and  offering  sanctions  in  the
forms  of  civil  tort  suits,  criminal  prosecution,  or  other  regulatory
sanctions such as removing the child from the home. Might spanking
become so taboo that eventually this immunity will no longer permit
such battery to occur?

4.  Problems.   Should  the  following  claims  against  the  victims’

parents be barred by parental immunity?

A. A father allows his 13-year-old daughter to stay out late without
a curfew, and she is injured while running around town with her
friends after midnight.

B.  A  mother  is  watching  out  her  living  room  window  while  her  5-
year-old plays a game in the alley behind their house with other
children. A car coming down the alley hits the child.

C. A mother purchases a new lawn mower and decides to remove
the  deflector  shield  from  the  side  of  the  mower.  As  a  result,
while the mother is mowing the yard one day, some rocks shoot
out the side of the mower and hit her son in the eye — causing
him to become blind.

D.  A  famous  NFL  player  disciplines  his  pre-school  son  by  using  a
wooden  spoon  to  spank  him  causing  cuts,  marks,  and  bruising
to his thigh and back.

Upon Further Review

Advising  a  client  that  her  otherwise  strong  tort  claim  is  barred
because the target defendant is immune from a civil lawsuit can
be daunting. Most lay people are shocked to hear of the concept
of  civil  immunity.  While  some  immunities  have  ancient  origins,
whether  or  not  the  immunity  will  have  modern  vitality  often
depends  upon  whether  currently  acceptable  alternative
justiﬁcations  exist.  “The  king  can  do  no  wrong”  might  sufﬁce  in
the  eighteenth  century,  but  twentieth-century  Americans  would
not tolerate such a rationale for federal governmental immunity.
Instead,  the  concept  of  not  using  taxpayer  funds  to  beneﬁt

isolated  individuals  can  instead  justify  the  doctrine.  And  while
few  states  cling  to  spousal  immunity,  most  still  recognize  a
legitimate  need  to  continue  to  protect  certain  uniquely  parental
decisions from judicial oversight or second-guessing.

V  STATUTES OF LIMITATION AND REPOSE

Like the immunity defenses and unlike comparative fault, statutes of
limitation defenses have nothing to do with the factual merits of the
lawsuit. Even the best tort claim will be “dead on arrival” if ﬁled in an
untimely manner. Every civil cause of action, including all tort claims,
has  a  limited  shelf  life  as  set  by  a  statute.  Many  personal  injury
claims, for example, must be brought within two or three years. Many
defamation  claims  are  time-barred  after  one  year.  Lawyers  must  be
careful in several respects when planning their tort litigation. First, a
careful  understanding  of  the  applicable  statute  is  required  to  ensure
that  counsel  knows  exactly  what  starts  the  running  of  the  clock.
Second,  counsel  must  be  aware  of  the  availability  of  (and  the  limits
on)  equitable  doctrines  that  are  sometimes  utilized  by  courts  to
provide  additional  time  to  bring  a  claim.  When  applicable,  these
equitable  doctrines  can  stop  the  clock  for  a  period  of  time.  Finally,
counsel also needs to distinguish between a statute of limitation and
a  statute  of  repose;  the  latter  sometimes  has  harsh  results  by
declaring  a  claim  time-barred  before  the  plaintiff  even  owns  a  tort
cause of action.

A. Statutes of Limitation

1. Accrual of a Claim

CRUMPTON v. HUMANA, INC.
661 P.2d 54 (N.M. 1983)

     , J.

This  is  a  frivolous  appeal.  We  also  note  that  there  is  a  strong
indication  in  the  record  that  counsel  for  the  appellant  ineptly  and
perhaps  negligently  handled  his  client’s  case.  Counsel  for  the
appellant failed to ﬁle suit before the applicable statute of limitations
had run. We are disappointed when members of our State Bar betray
the trust and conﬁdence of their clients by engaging in careless and
unprofessional practice.

On  February  8,  1979,  Wanda  Crumpton  underwent  surgery  at
Llano  Estacado  Medical  Center  in  Hobbs.  She  alleged  that  she
sustained  injuries  to  her  neck  and  legs  when  an  attending  nurse
attempted  to  lower  her  hospital  bed  on  February  11,  1979.  Her  suit
was ﬁled more than three years later on February 15, 1982. The trial
court granted a motion for summary judgment on the ground that the
suit  was  barred  by  the  three-year  statute  of  limitations.  Crumpton
now appeals and argues that the exact date of her injury may not be
ascertainable.

Crumpton argues that her injury was not ascertainable until some
time  after  the  accident  occurred.  Further,  she  contends  that  the
statute  of  limitations  should  have  been  tolled  during  the  time  the
parties were negotiating.

These  arguments  are  entirely  without  merit.  In  her  deposition,
Crumpton  plainly  testiﬁed  that  her  injuries  occurred  on  February  11,
1979.  She  also  testiﬁed  that  she  is  still  having  problems  in  her
shoulders,  legs  and  sides  which  she  attributed  to  the  February  11,
1979  incident.  Crumpton  offers  no  evidence  to  contradict  the  fact
that the alleged negligent act and injury occurred simultaneously on
February  11,  1979.  In  our  view,  the  fact  that  she  had  continuing
treatments and hospitalizations after the injury does not necessarily
make the date of the injury unascertainable.

Under . . . the general three-year statute of limitations, Section 37-
1-8,  Crumpton’s  suit  is  barred.  [This  statute  of  limitation]  clearly
indicates that the statute of limitations commences running from the

date  of  injury.  .  .  .  In  Peralta v. Martinez,  90  N.M.  391,  564  P.2d  194
(Ct.  App.  1977),  cert. denied,  90  N.M.  636,  567  P.2d  485  (1977),  the
Court of Appeals stated at page 394:

”The  injury  is  done  when  the  act  heralding  a  possible  tort  inflicts  a  damage
which  is  physically  objective  and  ascertainable”.  .  .  .  We  hold  the  limitation
period  begins  to  run  from  the  time  the  injury  manifests  itself  in  a  physically
objective manner and is ascertainable.

Crumpton cites no authority for her argument that the statute of
limitations  should  be  tolled  during  the  time  when  the  parties  were
negotiating  a  settlement.  The  record  indicates  that  defendants  did
not  fraudulently  lead  Crumpton  to  believe  that  the  case  would  be
settled at some future date. In fact, the record indicates that in May
1981, defendants sent Crumpton a letter wherein defendants made a
ﬁnal offer for a compromise settlement of the case.

Accordingly,  we  afﬁrm  the  trial  court’s  grant  of  summary
judgment against Crumpton. Because we determine this appeal to be
frivolous and entirely without merit, costs and attorneys fees are to be
borne by appellants.

IT IS SO ORDERED.

2. The Legal Injury Rule and the Discovery Rule

Exception

S.V. v. R.V.
933 S.W.2d 1 (Tex. 1996)

     , J.

R. intervened in her parents’ divorce proceeding, alleging that her
father,  S.,  was  negligent  by  sexually  abusing  her  until  she  was
seventeen years old. (Given the sensitive nature of these allegations,

we  refer  to  the  parties  only  by  initials  to  avoid  the  use  of  proper
names.)  Because  R.  did  not  sue  her  father  within  two  years  of  her
eighteenth  birthday  as  required  by  the  applicable  statutes  of
limitations,  her  action  is  barred  as  a  matter  of  law  unless  the
discovery rule permits her to sue within two years of when she knew
or  reasonably  should  have  known  of  the  alleged  abuse.  R.  contends
that  the  discovery  rule  should  apply  in  this  case  because  she
repressed all memory of her father’s abuse until about a month after
she  turned  twenty,  some  three  months  before  she  intervened  in  the
divorce action. The district court directed a verdict against R. on the
grounds that the discovery rule does not apply in this case, and that
R. adduced no evidence of abuse. A divided court of appeals reversed
and remanded for a new trial. We reverse the judgment of the court of
appeals  and  afﬁrm  the  judgment  of  the  district  court  on  limitations
grounds.

Before we review the evidence in this case it is important to have
clearly  in  mind  the  issue  that  is  crucial  in  determining  whether  to
apply the discovery rule. To pose that issue we begin with an analysis
of our discovery rule jurisprudence.

We  have  long  recognized  the  salutary  purpose  of  statutes  of
limitations.  In  Gautier  v.  Franklin,  1  Tex.  732,  739  (1847),  we  wrote
that statutes of limitations are justly held:

as  statutes  of  repose  to  quiet  titles,  to  suppress  frauds,  and  to  supply  the
deﬁciencies  of  proof  arising  from  the  ambiguity,  obscurity  and  antiquity  of
transactions. They proceed upon the presumption that claims are extinguished,
or  ought  to  be  held  extinguished  whenever  they  are  not  litigated  in  the  proper
forum  at  the  prescribed  period.  They  take  away  all  solid  ground  of  complaint,
because they rest on the negligence or laches of the party himself; they quicken
diligence by making it in some measure equivalent to right. . . .

Joseph P. Story, Conflicts of Law 482.

More recently, we explained:

Limitations  statutes  afford  plaintiffs  what  the  legislature  deems  a  reasonable
time to present their claims and protect defendants and the courts from having
to  deal  with  cases  in  which  the  search  for  truth  may  be  seriously  impaired  by
the  loss  of  evidence,  whether  by  death  or  disappearance  of  witnesses,  fading
memories, disappearance of documents or otherwise. The purpose of a statute
of limitations is to establish a point of repose and to terminate stale claims.

Murray v. San Jacinto Agency, Inc., 800 S.W.2d 826, 828 (Tex. 1990).
The  enactment  of  statutes  of  limitations  is,  of  course,  the
prerogative  of  the  Legislature.  At  the  time  this  case  was  ﬁled  and
tried,  the  applicable  statute  was  the  one  governing  personal  injury
actions  generally,  which  provided:  “A  person  must  bring  suit
for . . . personal injury . . . not later than two years after the day the
cause of action accrues.” Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §16.003(a). The
code contains two other provisions relevant to this case. One is: “If a
person  entitled  to  bring  a  personal  action  is  under  a  legal  disability
when  the  cause  of  action  accrues,  the  time  of  the  disability  is  not
included  in  the  limitations  period.”  Tex.  Civ.  Prac.  &  Rem.  Code
§16.001(b).  The  other  is:  “For  the  purposes  of  this  subchapter,  a
person is under a legal disability if the person is: (1) younger than 18
years  of  age.”  Id.  §16.001(a).  Thus,  a  person  has  until  his  or  her
twentieth birthday (or the next business day, §16.072) to bring suit for
personal injury from sexual assault if — and here we come to the root
of the problem in the case before us — the cause of action “accrued”
while the person was a minor.

Many other statutes peg the beginning of the limitations period on
the  date  the  cause  of  action  “accrues.”  Occasionally  the  date  of
accrual  is  deﬁned.  E.g.,  Tex.  Civ.  Prac.  &  Rem.  Code  §16.003(b)  (a
wrongful  death  cause  of  action  “accrues  on  the  death  of  the  injured
person”).  More  often,  however,  the  deﬁnition  of  accrual  is  not
prescribed by statute and thus has been left to the courts. As a rule,
we  have  held  that  a  cause  of  action  accrues  when  a  wrongful  act
causes  some  legal  injury,  even  if  the  fact  of  injury  is  not  discovered
until  later,  and  even  if  all  resulting  damages  have  not  yet  occurred.

Trinity River Auth. v. URS Consultants, Inc., 889 S.W.2d 259, 262 (Tex.
1994). We have not applied this rule without exception, however, and
have sometimes held that an action does not accrue until the plaintiff
knew or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known of
the wrongful act and resulting injury.

Accrual of a cause of action is deferred in two types of cases. In
one  type,  those
involving  allegations  of  fraud  or  fraudulent
concealment,  accrual  is  deferred  because  a  person  cannot  be
permitted  to  avoid  liability  for  his  actions  by  deceitfully  concealing
wrongdoing  until  limitations  has  run.  The  other  type,  in  which  the
discovery rule applies, comprises those cases in which “the nature of
the  injury  incurred  is  inherently  undiscoverable  and  the  evidence  of
injury  is  objectively  veriﬁable.”  These  two  elements  of  inherent
undiscoverability  and  objective  veriﬁability  balance  the  conflicting
policies  in  statutes  of  limitations:  the  beneﬁts  of  precluding  stale  or
spurious claims versus the risks of precluding meritorious claims that
happen to fall outside an arbitrarily set period. Restated, the general
principle  is  this:  accrual  of  a  cause  of  action  is  deferred  in  cases  of
fraud  or  in  which  the  wrongdoing  is  fraudulently  concealed,  and  in
discovery  rule  cases  in  which  the  alleged  wrongful  act  and  resulting
injury  were  inherently  undiscoverable  at  the  time  they  occurred  but
may  be  objectively  veriﬁed.  This  principle,  while  not  expressed  in
every  deferred  accrual  case,  is  derived  from  them  and  best  deﬁnes
when  the  exception  to  the  legal  injury  rule  has  been  and  should  be
applied.

We  have  considered  the  “inherently  undiscoverable”  element  of
the discovery rule in several cases. Willis, 760 S.W.2d at 645 (lawyer’s
error could not be discovered by client who was ignorant of the law);
Nelson, 678 S.W.2d at 923 (malpractice in muscular dystrophy gene
screening  could  not  be  discovered  by  parents  until  child  showed
symptoms); Kelley, 532 S.W.2d at 949 (false credit report could not be
discovered  until  credit  denied);  Hays,  488  S.W.2d  at  414  (“One  who
undergoes  a  vasectomy  .  .  .  and  then  after  tests  is  told  that  he  is

sterile,  cannot  know  that  he  is  still  fertile  .  .  .  until  either  his  wife
becomes  pregnant  or  he  is  shown  to  be  fertile  by  further  testing.”);
Gaddis,  417  S.W.2d  at  578  (“it  is  often  difﬁcult,  if  not  impossible,  to
discover that a foreign object has been left within the body within the
statutory period of limitation”). The common thread in these cases is
that when the wrong and injury were unknown to the plaintiff because
of  their  very  nature  and  not  because  of  any  fault  of  the  plaintiff,
accrual of the cause of action was delayed.

To be “inherently undiscoverable,” an injury need not be absolutely
impossible to discover, else suit would never be ﬁled and the question
whether  to  apply  the  discovery  rule  would  never  arise.  Nor  does
“inherently undiscoverable” mean merely that a particular plaintiff did
not  discover  his  injury  within  the  prescribed  period  of  limitations;
discovery of a particular injury is dependent not solely on the nature
of  the  injury  but  on  the  circumstances  in  which  it  occurred  and
plaintiff’s diligence as well. An injury is inherently undiscoverable if it
is by nature unlikely to be discovered within the prescribed limitations
period despite due diligence.

We have also considered the “objectively veriﬁable” element of the
rule  in  a  number  of  cases.  In  Gaddis,  a  patient  claimed  that  her
doctors  were  negligent  in  leaving  a  sponge  inside  her  body  after
surgery.  The  presence  of  the  sponge  in  her  body — the  injury — and
the explanation for how it got there — the wrongful act — were beyond
liability  was  asserted  were
dispute.  The
demonstrated  by  direct,  physical  evidence.  In  contrast,  Robinson
involved a claim by a patient against his doctors for misdiagnosis of
his back condition. We summarized the issue this way:

facts  upon  which

Plaintiff,  to  prove  his  cause  of  action,  faces  the  burden  of  proving  both  a
mistake in professional judgment and that such mistake was negligent. Expert
testimony would be required. Physical evidence generally is not available when
the  primary  issue  relevant  to  liability  concerns  correctness  of  past  judgment.
Unlike  Gaddis  v.  Smith  there  exists  in  the  present  case  no  physical  evidence
which in-and-of-itself establishes the negligence of some person. What physical

evidence  was  to  the  cause  of  action  alleged  in  Gaddis  v.  Smith,  expert
testimony is to the cause of action in the present case. Even the fact of injury is
a matter of expert testimony.

Expert  testimony,  we  concluded,  did  not  supply  the  objective
veriﬁcation  of  wrong  and  injury  necessary  for  application  of  the
discovery rule.

In  the  present  case  plaintiff  R.  claims  that  her  father  sexually
abused her and that she unconsciously repressed all memory of it for
years. If the legal injury rule were applied, R.’s claims against S. would
each  have  accrued  on  the  date  the  alleged  incident  of  abuse
occurred. In applying the statute of limitations, however, the years of
her  minority  are  not  included.  In  effect,  then,  under  the  legal  injury
rule,  R.  is  in  the  same  position  as  if  her  claims  all  accrued  on  her
eighteenth birthday and limitations began to run on that date, expiring
about  four  months  before  she  ﬁled  suit.  R.’s  claims  are  therefore
barred unless she is entitled to an exception to the legal injury rule. R.
does  not  allege  fraud  or  fraudulent  concealment,  nor  could  she.  R.
was not deceived into thinking that she was not being abused when
she was. To the contrary, R.’s contention is that she was fully aware
of  the  episodes  of  abuse,  so  painfully  so  that  she  repressed  all
memory  of  them  for  years.  Thus,  for  accrual  to  be  deferred  the
discovery  rule  must  apply.  For  the  discovery  rule  to  apply,  R.’s  claim
must  have  been  inherently  undiscoverable  within  the  limitations
period and objectively veriﬁable.

We  have  twice  held  a  ﬁduciary’s  misconduct  to  be  inherently
undiscoverable. Willis, 760 S.W.2d at 645 (attorney); Slay, 187 S.W.2d
at  394  (trustee).  The  reason  underlying  both  decisions  is  that  a
person  to  whom  a  ﬁduciary  duty  is  owed  is  either  unable  to  inquire
into the ﬁduciary’s actions or unaware of the need to do so. While a
person  to  whom  a  ﬁduciary  duty
is  relieved  of  the
responsibility  of  diligent  inquiry  into  the  ﬁduciary’s  conduct,  so  long
as  that  relationship  exists,  when  the  fact  of  misconduct  becomes

is  owed

apparent it can no longer be ignored, regardless of the nature of the
relationship. Because parents generally stand in the role of ﬁduciaries
toward  their  minor  children,  see  Thigpen  v.  Locke,  363  S.W.2d  247,
253  (Tex.  1962),  R.  was  not  obliged  to  watch  for  misconduct  by  her
father as long as she was a minor. Again, however, R. does not claim
to have been misled.

Nevertheless,  given  the  special  relationship  between  parent  and
child,  and  the  evidence  reviewed  in  detail  below  that  some  traumas
are  by  nature  impossible  to  recall  for  a  time,  we  assume  without
deciding  that  plaintiff  can  satisfy  the  inherent  undiscoverability
element  for  application  of  the  discovery  rule.  We  therefore  focus  on
the second element of objective veriﬁability. The question is whether
there  can  be  enough  objective  veriﬁcation  of  wrong  and  injury  in
childhood sexual abuse cases to warrant application of the discovery
rule.

The  literature  on  repression  and  recovered  memory  syndrome
establishes that fundamental theoretical and practical issues remain
to be resolved. These issues include the extent to which experimental
psychological theories of amnesia apply to psychotherapy, the effect
of repression on memory, the effect of screening devices in recall, the
forensic  and
effect  of  suggestibility,
therapeutic  truth,  and  the  extent  to  which  memory  restoration
techniques  lead  to  credible  memories  or  confabulations.  Opinions  in
this  area  simply  cannot  meet  the  “objective  veriﬁability”  element  for
extending the discovery rule.

the  difference  between

Accordingly, we conclude that the discovery rule does not apply in

this case.

We  do  not,  of  course,  impose  any  additional  requirements  on
proof of a childhood sexual abuse case brought within the applicable
limitations  period.  The  objective  veriﬁability  requirement  of  the
discovery rule does not apply in proving the case on the merits.

Nor  are  we  insensitive  to  the  terrible  wrong  of  childhood  sexual
abuse and the strong public policies condemning it as reflected in the
criminal statutes. False accusations of abuse are equally devastating
to  families,  however.  As  several  state  legislatures  have  already
realized,  the  law  must  approach  these  difﬁcult  cases  with  an
appreciation  of  all  the  interests  affected.  We  believe  the  best
approach is to apply the discovery rule in the same manner that we
have applied it today . . . and would apply it in any other case.

The  judgment  of  the  court  of  appeals  is  reversed  and  the

judgment of the district court is afﬁrmed.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Interpreting  the  Word  “Accrue.”   When  analyzing  any  statute  of
limitation issue, it is important to understand that the judicial history
of  interpreting  a  particular  statute  may  impact  its  meaning  in  a
signiﬁcant  way.  Many  statutes  of  limitation — which  are  frequently
phrased  to  run  from  the  time  a  claim  “accrues” — are  interpreted  in
light of the legal injury rule. This means, as the court held above, that
because a cause of action is complete when injury has occurred, the
claim accrues upon the happening of the physical injury regardless of
whether  the  plaintiff  realizes  she  has  been  injured.  See  e.g.,  Rod  v.
Farrell,  291  N.W.2d  568  (Wis.  1980)  (interpreting  the  medical
malpractice  statute  of  limitation  use  of  the  word  “accrue”  to  refer  to
the  date  of  the  injury  and  ﬁnding  the  claim  barred  even  though
plaintiff  had  no  way  to  discover  the  claim  until  17  years  later).
Sometimes,  however,  a  court  will  interpret  a  statute  of  limitation  to
implicitly  incorporate  a  discovery  rule  so  that  the  claim  does  not
“accrue” under it until the plaintiff knew or should have known he had
a possible claim. See e.g., Hanley v. Citizens Bank of Massachusetts,
2001  W.L.  717106  (Mass.  Super.  2001)  (interpreting  a  statute  of
limitation that granted a plaintiff “three years after the cause of action

accrues” to mean the plaintiff had until three years after an event took
place  that  would  “reasonably  likely  put  the  plaintiff  on  notice  that
someone  may  have  caused  her  injury”).  Some  statutes  of  limitation
expressly incorporate a discovery rule into the text of the statute. For
example, Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §16.010 provides that in a claim
for  misappropriation  of  trade  secrets,  the  claim  must  be  brought
within “three years after the misappropriation is discovered or by the
exercise of reasonable diligence should have been discovered.” What
is  signiﬁcant  is  that  a  lawyer  should  not  assume,  in  the  absence  of
express statutory language, that a client is entitled to the beneﬁt of a
discovery rule.

2. Alternative  Deﬁnitions  of  “Accrue”  in  Statutes.   Sometimes  the
legislature  will  draft  particular  statutes  of  limitation  that  expressly
contain  an  alternative  deﬁnition  for  when  the  claim  accrues.  For
example,  many  wrongful  death  claims  are  governed  by  statutes  of
limitation that expressly state that the claim accrues on the death of
the injured person. In cases where, following an accident, the primary
victim does not die for an extended period of time, the normal time to
ﬁle suit could signiﬁcantly increase.

3.  Limitations  in  Repressed  Sexual  Abuse  Cases.   Other  courts
have reached similar conclusions as the Texas Supreme Court did in
S.V. For example, in Doe v. Maskell, 679 A.2d 1087, 1093 (Md. 1996),
the court found that plaintiff’s claims of repressed memory of sexual
abuse as a minor by a chaplain at a parochial school were barred by
the  applicable  statute  of  limitations  and  that  the  discovery  rule  was
inapplicable:  “[W]e  are  unconvinced  that  repression  exists  as  a
phenomenon  separate  and  apart  from  the  normal  process  of
forgetting. Therefore we hold that the mental process of repression of
memories of past sexual abuse does not activate the discovery rule.”

4. Problems.   Should  the  applicable  statutes  of  limitation  bar  the

following claims?

A. A statute of limitation provides that all personal injuries claims
must  be  ﬁled  within  three  years  of  the  accrual  of  the  claim.
Plaintiff  uses  Defendant’s  insecticide  in  her  garden  to  protect
her tomato plants from certain bugs. Her repeated exposure to
the  chemical  over  ﬁve  years  results  in  increasing  levels  of
fatigue  and  dizziness.  In  year  ﬁve,  her  doctor  diagnoses  her
condition  as  resulting  from  the  chemical  exposure.  She
discontinues use of the product and sues due to her permanent
neurological impairment.

B.  Plaintiff  is  kidnapped  by  Defendant  and  held  hostage  in  his
basement  in  Cleveland  for  10  years.  She  ﬁnally  escapes  and
sues  him  for  all  of  her  injuries.  The  applicable  statute  of
limitation  provides  for  a  two-year  period  to  bring  all  claims  for
personal injuries upon their accrual.

B. Statutes of Repose

Statutes  of  limitation  typically  run  from  the  date  a  cause  of  action
“accrues,”  which  is  either  the  date  of  injury  (damage  or  legal  injury
being  the  last  element  of  a  tort  cause  of  action)  or,  when  the
discovery rule applies, the date that the plaintiff knew or should have
known  of  a  possible  claim.  Sometimes  the  legislature  is  concerned
that  a  case  might  be  ﬁled  against  a  defendant  long  after  the
defendant’s conduct giving rise to the claim has occurred. This could
happen  if  the  defendant’s  negligence  sets  in  motion  a  sequence  of
events that does not harm the plaintiff for many years. For example, if
you negligently exposed your workers to asbestos but it did not result
in  injury  for  two  decades,  a  worker’s  suit  against  you  might  still  be
timely  under  a  two-year  statute  of  limitation  so  long  as  the  sick
worker  ﬁled  suit  soon  after  becoming  ill.  Or,  in  cases  where  the
discovery  rule  is  applied  to  a  statute  of  limitation,  the  plaintiff’s

lengthy  delay  in  bringing  suit  might  be  justiﬁed  where  the  plaintiff’s
injury was inherently undiscoverable for a period of time.

For  these  reasons,  legislatures  sometimes  will  craft  a  statute  of
repose — an  additional  or  alternative  requirement  for  bringing  a  suit
within  a  period  of  time  running  from  the  date  of  a  particular  event,
such  as  the  date  of  the  defendant’s  negligence.  These  are
increasingly  enacted  in  many  states  for  medical  malpractice  cases,
product  liability  cases,  and  construction  defect  cases.  Although  the
terms  of  the  particular  statutes  ultimately  guide  the  analysis,  courts
typically  ﬁnd  that  the  discovery  rule  is  inapplicable  to  statutes  of
repose.  To  apply  a  discovery  rule  would  undermine  the  deﬁnite
deadline  offered  by  such  a  statutory  scheme.  In  this  instance,  the
only  avenue  around  missing  such  a  deadline  might  be  through  the
doctrine  of  fraudulent  concealment — that  the  defendant  concealed
the  existence  of  the  claim.  The  Kern  case  below  discusses  this
equitable tolling doctrine in a statute of repose scenario. Statutes of
repose also raise the possibility that someone might be barred from
bringing a claim based upon a deadline that had already passed prior
to the plaintiff even being injured or owning a cause of action. Efforts
to attack the unconstitutionality of such statutes of repose are often
difﬁcult, as we will see.

We reverse the Court of Appeals and the trial court.

Dale  Kern  received  external  beam  radiation  therapy  for  cancer  of
the bladder at St. Joseph Hospital in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The
treatments  were  administered  by  defendant  Dr.  Simmons,  an
employee  of  defendant-respondent,  X-Ray  Associates,  from  August
16, 1977, through September 22, 1977. Kern and his wife were told by
Dr.  Simmons  that  Kern’s  therapy  would  consist  of  30  treatments  of
radiation. After Kern had received 25 treatments, however, the therapy
was discontinued without explanation. When Kern and his wife asked
Dr.  Simmons  the  reason  for  the  early  termination  of  the  therapy,  Dr.
Simmons  did  not  respond  and  appeared  to  stare  off  in  the  other
direction.  After  the  radiation  treatments,  Kern  experienced  problems
with  frequency  of  urination  and  the  passing  of  blood  in  his  bowel
movements  and  urine.  Kern  died  on  August  30,  1982.  The  cause  of
death listed on the death certiﬁcate was sepsis-urinary tract infection
due to or as a consequence of irradiation cystitis and proctitis and/or
urinary bladder cancer.

radiation

Both  Kern  and  his  wife  believed  that  the  problems  Kern
experienced  after
therapy  were  acceptable
complications of the treatments. They were never informed that Kern
had  received  an  excessive  amount  of  radiation.  However,  after
reading  a  newspaper  article  in  1981  regarding  excessive  radiation
having  allegedly  been  administered  at  St.  Joseph  Hospital,  they
began to suspect the propriety of Kern’s treatment. Kern and his wife
employed  a  lawyer  to  investigate  whether  Kern’s  radiation  therapy
had been administered properly.

This lawsuit was ﬁled on March 21, 1983, by Kern’s widow in her
capacity  as  personal  representative  of  her  husband’s  estate.  She
alleged  that  her  husband’s  death  was  due  to  the  negligent
administration and calculation of external beam radiation therapy. Dr.
Simmons  and  X-Ray  Associates  ﬁled  a  motion  for  summary
judgment  contending  that  petitioner’s  lawsuit  was  barred  by  NMSA
1978,  Section  41-5-13.  The  trial  court  and  the  Court  of  Appeals
agreed.

Section  41-5-13  requires  that  a  claim  be  ﬁled  “within  three  years
after  the  date  that  the  act  of  malpractice  occurred.  .  .  .  ”  Petitioner
argues  that  there  is  no  malpractice  until  there  is  injury  and  that  the
statute,  therefore,  should  not  start  to  run  until  the  injury  has
manifested
is
ascertainable.  She  argues  that  Peralta  v.  Martinez,  564  P.2d  194
(N.M.  Ct.  App.),  cert.  denied,  567  P.2d  485  (1977)  and  the  general
rules  of  statutory  construction  compel  such  an  interpretation.  We
disagree.

in  a  physically  objective  manner  and

itself

Prior  to  the  enactment  of  the  Medical  Malpractice  Act  in  1976,
malpractice  actions  were  governed  by  the  general  statute  of
limitations  applicable  to  all  personal  injury  actions,  NMSA  1953,
Section 23-1-8, which is now NMSA 1978, Section 37-1-8. This statute
reads, in applicable part, “for an injury to the person or reputation of
any  person,  within  three  years.”  Primarily  because  of  the  use  of  the
word  “injury,”  Peralta  interpreted  this  statute  of  limitations  “to  run
from  the  time  the  injury  manifests  itself  in  a  physically  objective
manner and is ascertainable.” Peralta v. Martinez at 394, 564 P.2d at
197  (emphasis  in  original).  Peralta  is  not  controlling  in  the  present
case, therefore, for two reasons. First, it construes a different statute
of limitations. Second, Section 41-5-13 makes no reference to “injury”
or  any  such  comparable  term.  In  fact,  Peralta  recognized  this
signiﬁcant  wording  difference  between  the  general  statute  of
limitations it was construing and NMSA 1953, Section 58-33-13 (Int.
Supp. 1976), the precursor of Section 41-5-13.

We  agree  with  the  Court  of  Appeals  that  the  meaning  of  Section
41-5-13 is clear and unambiguous. If the language of a statute is not
ambiguous,  the  literal  meaning  of  the  words  must  be  applied.  The
statute clearly starts to run from the time of the occurrence of the act
giving  rise  to  the  cause  of  action.  Since  we  ﬁnd  the  meaning  of  this
is  no  need  to  resort  to  rules  of
statute  unambiguous,  there
construction.

We  recognize  that  this  statute  may  be  harsh  when  applied  to
latent  injury  cases.  Although  the  “wrongful  act  rule,”  as  our  type  of
statute  has  become  known,  was  once  the  general  rule,  it  is  now
generally  disfavored  and  many  states  have  enacted  some  form  of
discovery  provision  which  typically  provides  for  the  cause  of  action
not  to  accrue  until  the  patient  discovers  or  should  have  discovered
the  injury.  Any  changes  to  our  statute,  however,  should  be  made  by
the Legislature and not by the courts.

In the present case, petitioner’s lawsuit was ﬁled more than three
years  after  Kern’s  last  radiation  treatment  and  is  barred  by  Section
41-5-13  unless  the  statute  was  tolled  by  the  doctrine  of  fraudulent
concealment.  New  Mexico  recognizes  the  doctrine  of  fraudulent
concealment  in  medical  malpractice  actions.  Hardin  v.  Farris,  530
P.2d  407  (N.M.  Ct.  App.  1974).  The  doctrine  is  based  not  upon  a
construction of the statute, but rather upon the principle of equitable
estoppel. The theory is premised on the notion that the one who has
prevented  the  plaintiff  from  bringing  suit  within  the  statutory  period
should  be  estopped  from  asserting  the  statute  of  limitations  as  a
defense.

In  Hardin,  the  court  recognized  the  estoppel  nature  of  fraudulent

concealment and stated:

We  therefore  conclude  that  where  a  party  against  whom  a  cause  of  action
accrues prevents the one entitled to bring the cause from obtaining knowledge
thereof  by  fraudulent  concealment  .  .  .  the  statutory  limitation  on  the  time  for
bringing the action will not begin to run until the right of action is discovered, or,
by the exercise of ordinary diligence, could have been discovered.

Id. at 410. Silence may sometimes constitute fraudulent concealment
where  a  physician  breaches  his  ﬁduciary  duty  to  disclose  material
information  concerning  a  patient’s  treatment.  The  statute  of
limitations,  however,  is  not  tolled  if  the  patient  knew,  or  through  the
exercise  of  reasonable  diligence  should  have  known,  of  his  cause  of
action within the statutory period. If tolled by fraudulent concealment,

the  statute  commences  to  run  again  when  the  patient  discovers,  or
through the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered,
the malpractice.

When  we  consider  the  record,  we  ﬁnd  that  petitioner  did  present
sufﬁcient  evidence  to  raise  an  issue  of  material  fact  regarding  Dr.
Simmons’  knowledge  of  excessive
radiation  having  been
administered  to  Kern.  The  record  reveals  that  in  opposition  to
[defendants’]  motion  for  summary  judgment,  [Kern]  presented  the
afﬁdavit  of  a  doctor  knowledgeable  in  the  ﬁeld  of  therapeutic
radiology  who  stated  that  although  the  intended  treatment  plan  for
Kern conformed with the customary standards at that time, the dose
levels  given  did  not  follow  the  plan  and  were  greatly  excessive  and
that such dose levels “will cause unacceptable complications such as
those recorded in the medical records as being suffered by Dale Kern,
deceased.”  In  addition,  the  afﬁdavit  of  a  radiation  physicist  stated,
“Whoever  calculated  the  treatment  times  needed  to  implement  this
treatment  plan  performed  a  gross  calculation  error.”  (Emphasis
added.)  Petitioner  also  presented  her  own  afﬁdavit  which  contained
the facts set forth at the beginning of this opinion.

In  support  of  his  motion  for  summary  judgment,  Dr.  Simmons
ﬁled  an  afﬁdavit  denying  knowledge  of  any  malpractice  and  denying

concealment  of  any  material  facts.  Resolving,  however,  all  doubts  in
favor  of  petitioner,  we  ﬁnd  the  evidence  sufﬁcient  to  create  a  fact
issue. The early termination of the treatments without explanation, Dr.
Simmons’ failure to answer the Kerns’ question concerning the early
termination,  and  the  statements  in  the  afﬁdavits  ﬁled  by  petitioner
lend  possible  support  to  petitioner’s  claims  of  excessive  radiation
having  been  given  to  Kern,  and  of  “a  gross  calculation  error”  having
been made in implementing Kern’s treatment plan.

Summary  judgment  was  improperly  granted.  The  trial  court  and
the Court of Appeals are reversed. The case is remanded to the trial
court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Statute  of  Repose.   Statutes  of  repose  are  intended  to  operate
in  a  stricter  fashion  than  statutes  of  limitation.  This  is  often
accomplished in one of two ways. First, the statute often begins the
running of the deadline from a more speciﬁc date, such as the date of
the  alleged  medical  malpractice,  the  date  a  manufacturer  sold  a
product,  or  the  date  a  construction  project  was  completed.  Second,
such  statutes  are  generally  considered  to  be  exempt  from  possible
application of any discovery rule, unless the plaintiff facing a possibly
stale  claim  is  able  to  plead  and  prove  fraudulent  concealment  as  in
Kern.

2.  Fraudulent  Concealment.   As  discussed  by  the  court  in  Kern,
fraudulent concealment might consist of the defendant afﬁrmatively
covering up information that would reveal a cause of action, perhaps
by lying to the plaintiff about certain facts. On the other hand, where
there  is  a  ﬁduciary  or  special  relationship  between  the  parties,
fraudulent  concealment  is  possible  where  the  defendant  is  merely
silent. Either way, courts generally hold that the equitable doctrine of
fraudulent concealment can be a defense to the application of either

a  statute  of  limitation  or  a  statute  of  repose.  By  contrast,  the
discovery  rule  typically  is  only  available  (if  at  all)  as  a  defense  to  a
statute of limitation.

3.  Constitutionality  of  Statutes  of  Repose.   Some  plaintiffs
particularly aggrieved by the harsh application of a statute of repose
have  challenged  its  legality,  either  under  a  due  process  or  equal
protection  argument.  One  noteworthy  example  is  Sedar  v.  Knowlton
Construction  Co.,  551  N.E.2d  938  (Ohio  1990)  in  which  the  plaintiff
was injured in a dormitory at Kent State University. In 1985, his arm
was  injured  in  a  panel  of  wire-reinforced  glass  due  to  alleged  faulty
design and construction. Unfortunately for the plaintiff, the trial court
dismissed  his  lawsuit  ﬁled  less  than  two  years  later  because  of  the
applicable  statute  of  repose  for  cases  involving  construction  or
improvement  defects.  This  statute  of  repose  precluded  all  claims
brought “more than ten years after . . . the furnishing [of construction]
services.”  Because  the  dormitory  was  completed  in  1966,  all  claims
for defective construction were required to be brought by 1976 — nine
years  before  plaintiff  was  even  hurt.  The  only  way  the  plaintiff’s  suit
could have been timely was to bring it nearly a decade before he had
any injuries. Of course, no such suit was possible then. Nevertheless,
the court upheld the statute as a rational exercise of the legislature’s
power  to  limit  the  liability  of  architects  and  builders  to  “encourage
[them] to experiment with new designs and materials.” By contrast, in
Kennedy v. Cumberland Engineering Co., 471 A.2d 195 (R.I. 1984), the
Rhode Island Supreme Court held unconstitutional a 10-year statute
of repose for product manufacturers — the statute required all claims
to  be  brought  within  10  years  of  the  initial  sale  of  the  product.  The
plaintiff was ﬁrst injured by defendant’s product 9 years after its initial
sale;  plaintiff  had  no  way  of  discovering  when  the  product  was  ﬁrst
sold  until  after  ﬁling  suit  several  years  later  and  obtaining  the  sales
history  of  the  product  during  discovery.  The  court  held  that  such
harsh application — even to the point where one might not be injured
until long after the deadline for suits had passed — violated the right

to a forum guaranteed by the state constitution, stating: “[A] product
with a life expectancy much greater than ten years can unfairly enjoy
a  total  immunity  from  the  effect  of  its  defect  for  a  great  part  of  the
product’s useful life. The application of this statute to this plaintiff is
no less harsh and unjust.” Id. at 200.

4.  Problems.   Using  the  same  general  facts  and  the  statute  of
repose from the Kern case, consider whether the following variations
would alter the outcome the court reached:

A.  After  discontinuing  the  radiation  therapy,  neither  Kern  nor  his
wife have any conversations with their doctor about the reasons
for the premature stopping of his treatments.

B.  In  response  to  being  questioned  by  the  Kerns  about  why  the
treatments  were  abruptly  stopped,  their  doctor  says,  “We  were
concerned  that  your  levels  of  radiation  might  be  such  that  you
would be at too high of a risk of suffering some complications,
and we would rather err on the side of safety.”

C.  A  month  after  the  actual  conversation  with  their  doctor  about
the  abrupt  termination  of  Mr.  Kern’s  radiation,  Mr.  Kern
overhears  a  nurse  say,  “I  sure  hope  none  of  our  patients  were
hurt from their exposure to radiation.” Mr. Kern is not completely
sure  what  this  means  and  is  concerned,  but  he  fails  to  inquire
about it any further.

Upon Further Review

There  are  few  worse  feelings  for  a  plaintiff’s  lawyer  than  the
realization  that  she  has  been  tardy  in  ﬁling  a  client’s  case.  The
transformation  of  a  good  tort  claim  into  one  fraught  with  a
technical  deﬁciency  is  not  only  a  cause  for  concern  for  the
lawyer,  but  also  for  the  lawyer’s  legal  malpractice  insurance
carrier.  Whether  as  a  plaintiff’s  lawyer  trying  to  screen  a  new

case to be sure it is still viable, or as a defense lawyer reading a
new  complaint  and  trying  to
identify  possible  afﬁrmative
lawyers  need  to  be  able  to  accurately
defenses,  all  trial
determine the timetable during which a particular claim must be
ﬁled.  Generalities  will  not  sufﬁce.  Instead,  counsel  needs  to
isolate  the  applicable  statute,  determine  if  it  is  a  statute  of
limitation or a statute of repose, clarify what stops the applicable
time  period  from  commencing,  and  identify  if  any  equitable
tolling  doctrines  might  extend  the  time  period  during  which  the
claim must be ﬁled.

Paula
Christmas  lights  on  an  early  December  morning.  A  low-flying
military  F-18  ﬁghter  jet  flies  overhead  circling  the  mountain  on
which Paula’s home was built. Paula was amazed by the sight of
the aircraft, though alarmed at how low it was flying. Rather than
leaving her rooftop, however, she decided to stay where the view
was  good  and  take  photographs  of  it  with  her  smartphone.
Finally  it  headed  directly  toward  her  home;  Paula  was  giddy  at
the  prospect  of  the  image  she  might  capture.  However,  as  it
passed  overhead,  the  wind  gust  generated  by  the  plane’s
movement  through  the  air  literally  knocked  Paula  off  her  feet,
causing  her  to  roll  off  the  edge  of  the  roof  and  suffer  a  serious
neck  fracture.  Paula  incurred  extensive  medical  bills  and  it  will

in

take  her  years  of  therapy  to  regain  the  ability  to  walk.  In  the
meantime, she complained to the Department of Defense within
a month of the accident about the low flight of the aircraft. The
government  ofﬁcial,
to  Paula’s  complaints,

erroneously  advised  her  that  the  aircraft  was  never  lower  than
300 feet — well above the 200-foot ceiling for aircraft practicing
combat  maneuvers  over
residential  areas  dictated  by
Department  of  Defense  regulations.  Three  years  pass  since  the
accident. Out of desperation to pay her continuing medical bills,
she ﬁnally consults a lawyer. The lawyer obtains the actual flight
records  for  that  F-18’s  operations  on  the  day  of  the  incident
(through a Freedom of Information Act request) and learns that
the aircraft was recorded flying as low as 150 feet and that the
pilot’s  commander  had  authorized  the  low  flight  as  “good
training.”  Assume  that  there  is  a  governing  statute  that  states,
“Any  claims  for  personal  injuries  caused  by  aircraft  must  be
brought within two years of the date of the flight.”

Michigan,  West  Virginia,  New  Mexico,  Illinois,  Iowa,  Missouri,  Kentucky,  and  South
Carolina.  Nine  courts  adopted  pure  comparative  fault.  In  two  of  these  states,
legislatures subsequently enacted a modiﬁed form. Two courts adopted a modiﬁed
form of comparative fault. See Bradley v. Appalachian Power Co., 163 W. Va. 332,
256  S.E.2d  879  (1979)  (plaintiff  may  recover  if  his  negligence  is  less  than

(plaintiff may recover if his negligence is not greater than defendants’).

2.  Six  states  have  legislatively  adopted  pure  comparative  fault:  Mississippi,
Rhode Island, Washington, New York, Louisiana, and Arizona; eight legislatures have
enacted the modiﬁed “49 percent” rule (plaintiff may recover if plaintiff’s negligence
is less than defendant’s): Georgia, Arkansas, Maine, Colorado, Idaho, North Dakota,
Utah, and Kansas; eighteen legislatures have enacted the modiﬁed “50 percent” rule

defendant’s):  Wisconsin,  Hawaii,  Massachusetts,  Minnesota,  New  Hampshire,
Vermont,  Oregon,  Connecticut,  Nevada,  New  Jersey,  Oklahoma,  Texas,  Wyoming,
Montana, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and Delaware; two legislatures have enacted
statutes  that  allow  a  plaintiff  to  recover  if  plaintiff’s  negligence  is  slight  when
compared to defendant’s gross negligence: Nebraska and South Dakota.

3. Plaintiff at the time of signing the release was in great pain, under sedation,
and probably unable to read. At trial plaintiff contended that the release was invalid,
asserting that a release does not bind the releasor if at the time of its execution he
suffered from so weak a mental condition that he was unable to comprehend the
effect of his act. The jury, however, found against plaintiff on this issue. Since the
verdict  of  the  jury  established  that  plaintiff  either  knew  or  should  have  known  the
signiﬁcance  of  the  release,  this  appeal  raises  the  sole  question  of  whether  the
release can stand as a matter of law.

6. The view that the exculpatory contract is valid only if the public interest is not
involved represents the majority holding in the United States. Only New Hampshire,
in  deﬁnite  opposition  to  “public  interest”  test,  categorically  refuses  to  enforce
exculpatory provisions.

equally sophisticated commercial entities. Less precise language may be effective
in such situations, and we reserve any such issues.

II  ACTUAL, COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

A. Special (Economic) Damages

Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(g).

In Practice
The Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure require that if “an
item of special damage” is being
sought by a plaintiff, “it must be
speciﬁcally stated” in the
complaint.

Actual  damages  awards  are
designed  to  make  the  victim
whole  by  compensating  the
victim  for  the  harm  that  has
been  suffered  (past  damages)
as  of  the  time  of  trial  and  all
damages  likely  to  be  suffered
after the trial (future damages).
This  remedial  purpose  is  why
actual damages also go by the
name compensatory damages.
The  two  categories  of  actual
damages  are  often  referred  to  as  special  and  general.  Special
damages  are  economic  harms  caused  by
the  defendant’s
misconduct.  These  are  called  economic  because  the  items  in  this
category  relate  to  matters  for  which  there  are  objective  economic
values in the marketplace. For example, economic losses include lost
wages or earning capacity, medical expenses, and property repairs (or
lost fair market value of property). Every day medical expenses are, in
effect,  bought  and  sold  in  doctors’  ofﬁces  and  hospitals.  Medicines
have a particular purchase price. When someone has been unable to
work  due  to  the  accident,  the  factﬁnder  can  ascertain  what  that
person would have earned from their job had they not been hurt. For
future  lost  earning  capacity  (if  the  plaintiff’s  injuries  will  prevent  her
from doing some jobs in the future) it is possible to estimate what her
earning  power  would  have  been  in  the  market  but  for  the  injuries.
Many  times,  some  of  these  items  of  damages  are  relatively  non-

controversial.  Simply  keeping  receipts  for  certain  expenses  incurred
from  injuries  can  sufﬁce  to  prove  elements  of  such  a  loss.  Other
times,  the  parties  may  end  up  going  to  trial  over  disputed  issues  of
economic  losses.  The  Martin  case  below  offers  a  good  foray  into  a
factﬁnder’s  analysis  in  setting  compensatory  damages.  We  get  to
peek into the mind of the factﬁnder because it was a bench trial (due
to being an FTCA claim against the U.S. government), and the judge
has written ﬁndings of fact supporting the entry of a damage award.
As you read this opinion, pay close attention to the details of how the
court goes about calculating the special damages.

MARTIN v. UNITED STATES
471 F. Supp. 6 (D. Ariz. 1979)

     , J.

This  is  a  Federal  Tort  Claims  case  tried  in  the  District  of  Arizona
while I was sitting there, by assignment, in February. On February 14,
1979, by oral opinion, I found in favor of plaintiffs on the issue of the
government’s negligence; in addition, I found against the government
issue  of  contributory  negligence.  Liability  having  been
on  the
established,  I  requested  the  parties  to  submit  post-trial  memoranda
concerning damages, so as to permit me to decide the damage issue
upon my return to the District of Oregon.

The facts of this near-fatal accident are simple. [Melvin E. Burrows
II, one of the two plaintiffs in this case,] . . . a grade school youngster,
[was]  riding  home  from  school  on  a  motorbike  [as  a  passenger]  at
about  6:00  P.M.  on  September  21,  1977,  when  [the  bike]  struck  a
line  negligently  maintained  by  the
sagging  or
government.  [Plaintiff  suffered]  tragically  severe  and  permanent
injuries.1 The damage elements are:

“down”  power

1) Past medical expenses, which are agreed;

2) Future medical expenses, also agreed, save for minor aspects;
3) Present value of lost future earning capacity;
4) Pain and suffering, and interference with normal and usual activities.

Plaintiff  Burrows  sustained  severe  burns  to  his  face,  head,  back,

buttocks, arms and legs.

PAST MEDICAL EXPENSES

[P]laintiff has submitted uncontested documentation of past medical
expenses totaling $48,130.97.

FUTURE MEDICAL EXPENSES

[P]laintiff  originally  sought  an  award  of  $55,000  for  future  medical
expenses based upon the testimony of Dr. Alan Sacks that each of 11
further  contemplated  plastic  surgeries  will  cost  about  $3,000;  that
the operations should be performed at intervals of approximately six
months;  that  hospital  costs  have  doubled  over  the  past  ﬁve  years;
and  that  future  cost  increases  will  be  about  12-15%  per  year.  The
defendant objected to plaintiff’s suggestion that I take judicial notice
of  the  asserted  rate  of  inflation  in  hospital  costs.  Defendant  also
noted that the award could be immediately invested by the plaintiff to
generate  a  return  that  would  at  least  partially  offset  future  medical
care  cost  inflation.  Following  my  letter  of  March  20,  1979,  to  the
parties seeking clariﬁcation of this matter, the parties agreed to entry
of  an  award  for  future  medical  expenses  of  $48,629.  In  addition,  I
award  $5,000  for  psychological  treatments  to  accompany  Melvin’s
additional surgeries, as recommended by Dr. Aaron Canter, a clinical
psychologist  who  treated  Melvin  during  and  after  his  stay  at  the
Maricopa County Hospital.

LOSS OF EARNING CAPACITY

Probable Earning Capacity Absent the Accident

Clarence Martin is principal of the Florence middle school, owner of a
rooﬁng  business  that  employs  Melvin  Burrows’  father,  and  uncle  of
the  other  plaintiff  in  this  case.  He  testiﬁed  upon  the  basis  of  his
observation of Melvin during the seven years he has known him and
the  month  and  a  half  that  Melvin  had  attended  the  middle  school
prior  to  the  accident.  He  believed  that  Melvin  was  average  or  above
average  in  intelligence  and  probably  would  have  become  a  skilled
worker,  perhaps  a  mechanic  or  a  carpenter.  Dr.  Glenn  Wilt,  an
associate  professor  of  ﬁnance  at  Arizona  State  University  and  an
investment counselor, stated:

[I]t  can  be  reasonably  presumed  that,  but  for  their  injuries,  both  Melvin  and
Jeffrey would have gravitated into positions in one of the construction trades.
Clearly,  that  is  exactly  what  most  of  their  uninjured  classmates  will  do,  and
considering the general demand in this territory, due to the growth of population
and need for attendant services in the construction ﬁeld, a strong demand can
be forecast for these jobs.

Dr.  David  Yandell,  a  clinical  psychologist  and  vocational
rehabilitation  counselor  called  by  the  defendant,  testiﬁed  that  the
intelligence  and  aptitude  tests  administered  by  Dr.  Donald  Guinoud
show that Melvin could not have pursued a career in the skilled crafts
but instead probably would have become a laborer. Defendant’s other
witness, Dr. John Buehler, chairman of the department of economics
at  the  University  of  Arizona,  expressed  his  opinion  that  neither
plaintiff  probably  would  have  become  a  worker  in  the  skilled  trades,
but rather each would have earned average wages.2

Based upon my evaluation of the testimony and the expertise and
credibility of the witnesses, I conclude that Melvin Burrows probably
would have become a skilled worker. Dr. Wilt stated that a carpenter
would, at 1978 wage rates, earn about $9,450 per year during a four-
year  apprenticeship  and  during  a  subsequent  42-year  career  as  a
journeyman  carpenter  would  earn  about  $18,900  annually  in  wages
and  $3,900  annually  in  fringe  beneﬁts.  I  accept  these  ﬁgures  as

reasonable  approximations  of  Melvin’s  lifetime  earnings  had  he  not
experienced this accident.

Probable Earning Capacity

Dr.  Guinourd  testiﬁed  that  Melvin  might  be  employable  as  a  night
watchman  or  night  diesel  mechanic  not  involved  with  the  public
interaction aspect of either business. Dr. Wilt concluded that, because
of Melvin’s disﬁgurement and intolerance to sunlight and perspiration,
he would probably be unable to ﬁnd a job suited to his handicap. Dr.
Canter  testiﬁed  that  Melvin  would  beneﬁt  psychologically  from
working even at a lowly position.

Based  upon  the  testimony  and  my  own  observation  of  Melvin
Burrows, I conclude that he probably will be able to work at an entry-
level position for at least half of his normal working life. According to
Dr.  Wilt,  such  work  would  generate  an  annual  income  of  $3,120  in
1978 dollars. Thus, Melvin is entitled to recover in 1978 dollars $6,330
per year for four years (apprenticeship period), then $19,680 per year
for the following 42 years (journeyman period).

Inflation Rate and Return on Investment

Dr.  Wilt  testiﬁed  that  it  is  reasonable  to  expect  an  annual  wage
inflation  rate  of  7%  over  Melvin’s  working  lifetime  and  that  a  sum  of
money  in  the  hundreds  of  thousands  of  dollars  could  earn  7%
annually  in  relatively  riskless  investments.3  Dr.  Buehler,  on  the  other
hand,  stated  that  wages  should  be  expected  to  increase  only  5.5%
annually  over  this  period  and  that  the  award  could  presently  be
invested with essentially no risk yet earn more than 9% annually.

I  ﬁnd  that  the  award  can  presently  be  invested  at  very  little  risk
and  return  7.5%  compounded  annually.  I  ﬁnd  that  5.5%
is  a
reasonable  annual  rate  of  wage  inflation  to  be  expected  during
Melvin’s working lifetime.

Amount of the Award

I award an amount for the loss of Melvin’s earning capacity sufﬁcient
when  invested  at  a  7.5%  annual  rate  of  return  to  generate  in  1978
dollars  $6,330  per  year  for  the  four  years  1983-86  (hypothetical
apprenticeship  period)  and  $19,680  per  year  for  the  following  42
years 1987-2028 (hypothetical journeyman period). These amounts in
1978  dollars  are  to  be  converted  to  current  dollars  for  each  year  by
application  of  a  5.5%  expected  annual  rate  of  wage  inflation,  then
discounted  at  7.5%  per  year  back  to  1979.  By  this  method  of
calculation, the award for loss of Melvin’s earning capacity amounts
to $548,029.

[The court reviewed the evidence regarding the extensive burns to
the plaintiff’s body, the painful removal of charred layers of skin from
his face, head, and buttocks, the permanent contortion of his mouth
into a sneer, and his psychological and sociological suffering (e.g, the
taunting and ridicule he has faced from schoolmates and strangers)
in reaching a ﬁnding of an additional $1,000,000 in damages for pain
and suffering.

The  court  went  through  a  similar  analysis  in  ﬁnding  actual

damages for similar components of harm for the other plaintiff.]

The  foregoing  shall  constitute  ﬁndings  of  fact  and  conclusions
pursuant to Rule 52, Fed. R. Civ. P., together with earlier ﬁndings and
conclusions set out in my oral opinion on February 14, 1979.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Medical  Expenses.   Tortfeasors  are  required  to  pay  for  the
medical  expenses  incurred  in  good  faith  for  injuries  caused  by  a
tortfeasor’s misconduct. Courts frequently speak in terms of medical
expenses  that  were  “reasonable  and  necessary”  as  proper  items  for
inclusion  in  a  damage  award.  When  the  services  are  obviously
necessary there may be little dispute about this item of damages. But

where  it  is  unclear  that  treatment  was  associated  solely  with  the
injury caused by the tortfeasor, there may be a greater need for expert
testimony  (usually  the  treating  health  care  provider)  to  prove  the
causal  link  between  the  expense  and  the  incident.  Future  medical
expenses  almost  always  require  expert  testimony  to  prove  that  they
will  in  “reasonable  probability”  be  incurred  in  the  future  for  the
underlying condition.

2.  Lost  Earning  Capacity.   For  past  lost  wages,  reference  for  the
amount  lost  is  typically  made  to  the  job  plaintiff  actually  had  at  the
time  of  the  incident.  Where  the  injuries  have  prevented  the  plaintiff
from working, often a simple mathematical calculation yields the past
lost  wages  amount.  Future  lost  earning  capacity  can  be  quite  a  bit
trickier. One can obtain damages for future lost earning capacity even
if  not  presently  employed,  so  long  as  the  evidence  shows  that  the
injuries  will  prevent  employment  that  otherwise  would  have  been
forecast  as  likely  to  have  occurred.  In  the  Martin  case,  this  required
extrapolation,  based  upon  the  character  traits  of  the  minor  plaintiff
and the surrounding circumstances, as to what he likely would have
inherently
done  after  reaching  adulthood.  This
speculative, but it is a necessary exercise if the goal is to attempt to
provide  full  compensation.  See  Feldman  v.  Allegheny  Airlines,  382  F.
Supp.  1271  (D.  Conn.  1974)  (approving  the  practice  of  extrapolating
based upon the evolving pattern of the claimant’s life). A minority of
courts  will  not  permit  such  speculation  into  areas  of  employment
never  before  achieved  by  a  plaintiff.  These  courts  tend  to  restrict
generally  future  earning  capacity  to  the  same  type  of  employment
plaintiff  has  already  achieved  (subject  to  increases  based  upon
seniority). See State v. Guinn, 555 P.2d 530 (Alaska 1976).

is,  of  course,

3.  Inflation.   The  court  in  Martin  had  to  increase  the  future
earnings  calculation  based  upon  the  assumption  that  cost  of  living
raises  in  the  applicable  area  of  likely  employment  would  increase
during  the  work  life  expectancy  of  the  plaintiff.  Failure  to  take  such
inflationary  pressures  on  earnings  into  account  would  otherwise

result  in  not  compensating  the  plaintiff  for  all  of  his  actual  losses.
Courts used to refuse to use inflation to increase such future special
damage awards because they felt that this was too speculative. But
economists  recognize  the  need  to  include  inflationary  adjustments,
and courts have shifted positions on this issue today.

4. Discounting  to  Present  Value.   Also,  in  Martin,  the  court  had  to
take  the  future  special  damages  award  and  discount  it  so  that  the
award today of future losses would not overcompensate the plaintiff.
Without  discounting  to  present  value,  awards  of  future  special
damages  would  overcompensate  a  plaintiff  because  $1  today  is
worth  more  than  $1  in  the  future  due  to  the  ability  to  invest  that
money.  One  legal  scholar  has  explained  the  principle  of  reducing
future awards of special damages to present value as follows:

[I]t  is  assumed  that  the  plaintiff  will  invest  the  sum  awarded  and
receive  interest  thereon.  That  interest  accumulated  over  the
number  of  relevant  years  will  be  available,  in  addition  to  the
capital,  to  provide  the  plaintiff  with  his  future  support  until  the
total is exhausted at the end of the period. The projected interest
must therefore be allowed in reduction of capital lest it be claimed
that the plaintiff is overcompensated.

Fleming, Inflation and Tort Compensation, 26 Am. J. Comp. Law 51,
66 (1977). Note the difference in opinions in Martin between experts
as to the appropriate discount rate to use; the job of the factﬁnder is
to employ a discount rate that reflects a reasonably safe investment.
While  the  need  to  reduce  to  present  value  and  the  principles
governing  this  calculation  are  clear,  the  proper  rates  to  use  can
become  a  topic  on  which  competing  expert  witnesses  disagree  in
particular cases. Courts do not require that future awards of general,
noneconomic damages be discounted to present value.

5. Total Offset Alternative.  If you are paying close attention to the
math in the two foregoing notes, the thought should occur to you that

on  future  special  damages,  we  ﬁrst  increase  the  damages  using  a
percentage  (for  inflation)  and  then  decrease  the  damages  using  a
percentage  (the  discount  to  present  value  number).  Some  courts
believe  that  it  is  simpler  and  fairer  to  simply  declare  these  two
computations  a  “total  offset”  and  to  neither  increase  the  future
damages  for  inflation  nor  decrease  them  to  present  value.  See
generally  Kaczkowski  v.  Bolubasz,  421  A.2d  1027  (Pa.  1980)
(discussing  the  differences  between  the  minority  “total  offset”
position  and  the  majority  approach  of  increasing  for  inflation  and
then decreasing to present value). In most scenarios, the total offset
approach is more plaintiff-friendly than the majority approach. This is
because the discount rate is usually higher than the rate of inflation
(or else people would not bother to invest money).

6. Taxation of Damages.  Under current federal tax laws, awards of
actual,  compensatory  damages  for  personal  injury  cases  are  not
subject  to  federal  income  tax.  This  is  true  even  for  past  lost  wages
and future lost earning capacity. Many states permit the factﬁnder to
take  into  account  the  non-taxation  on  this  element  of  recovery  (by
reducing  the  award  to  after-tax  estimates  of  earnings)  in  order  to
avoid a windfall recovery to the plaintiff and the defendant paying an
excessive amount of actual damages.

7. Problem.   Trial  courts  have  discretion  as  to  whether  to  submit
one  damage  question  to  the  jury  or  to  break  up  the  damages  into
multiple  questions  or  blanks  to  ﬁll  in,  as  in  the  following  example.  If
you were the defense counsel would you prefer one approach to the
other?

B. General (Noneconomic) Damages

General damages are another category of actual damages designed
to  compensate  for  noneconomic  harms — injuries  for  which  there  is
no actual market value. It is conceptually difﬁcult to quantify physical
pain  and  suffering  or  emotional  anguish  in  dollars  and  cents.  These
damages are simply incapable of exact mathematical calculation and
this  is  qualitatively  different  than  what  we  encountered  with  special
damages. Yet money is the language of tort law no matter the type of
harm  involved.  The  tort  goals  we  ﬁrst  encountered  in  Chapter  1 —
compensating  worthy  victims,  deterring  conduct  that  is  likely  to
cause  harm,  and  punishing  misconduct — are  all  furthered  through
the auspices of a court order requiring a tortfeasor to pay a victim a
certain  amount  of  money.  The  primary  dilemma  with  general
damages  is  ascertaining  when  a  jury’s  award  is  appropriate.  While
juries  are  not  permitted  to  receive  evidence  of  other  jury  awards  of
general  damages,  the  judges  (both  trial  and  appellate)  frequently
compare  jury  awards  of  general  damages  in  order  to  determine  if  a
challenged award seems appropriate. The Miraglia case below is an
example of a trial court judge conducting such an analysis in a tragic
case.  You  will  notice  perhaps  that  this  analysis  seems  more  akin  to
art than science.

Because  it  is  difﬁcult  for
juries  to  ﬁnd  general  damages

Principles
“We disagree with those
students of tort law who believe
that pain and suffering are not
real costs and should not be
allowable items of damages in a
tort suit. No one likes pain and
suffering and most people
would pay a good deal of money
to be free of them. If they were
not recoverable in damages, the
cost of negligence would be less
to the tortfeasors and there
would be more negligence, more
accidents, more pain and
suffering, and hence higher
social costs.”

Finally,  we  will  consider  the
possibility  of  juries  awarding,  under  different  labels,  damages  for
essentially the same harms. General damages include harms referred
to by labels such as pain and suffering, emotional anguish (or mental
distress),  disﬁgurement,  physical  impairment  or  disability,  loss  of
reputation,  and  loss  of  spousal  or  parental  consortium.  A  classic
example  of  the  potential  for  double  dipping  in  these  losses  comes
with  the  additional  item  of  general  damages  referred  to  as  hedonic
losses — loss of the intrinsic joy of life. We will encounter one court’s
attempt to control the potential for juries making cumulative awards
due to a request for compensation of this type of loss.

1. Review of Jury’s Award

Of  all  of  the  categories  of  general  damages,  by  far  the  one  that
receives  the  most  attention  (and  criticism)  is  an  award  for  pain and
suffering.  Consider  the  words  of  one  famous  California
jurist
regarding the enigma of awards for pain and suffering:

It would hardly be possible ever to compensate a person fully for
pain  and  suffering.  “No  rational  being  would  change  places  with
the injured man for an amount of gold that would ﬁll the room of
the  court,  yet  no  lawyer  would  contend  that  such  is  the  legal
measure  of  damages.”  Translating  pain  and  anguish  into  dollars
can, at best, be only an arbitrary allowance, and not a process of
measurement, and consequently the judge can, in his instructions
give the jury no standard to go by; he can only tell them to allow
such amount as in their discretion they may consider reasonable.
The chief reliance for reaching reasonable results in attempting to
value  suffering  in  terms  of  money  must  be  the  restraint  and
common sense of the jury.

Seffert  v.  Los  Angeles  Transit  Lines,  364  P.2d  337,  345  (Cal.  1961)
(Traynor,  J.,  dissenting  from  afﬁrmance  of  jury’s  pain  and  suffering
award). Consider whether you agree with the jury’s or the trial judge’s
determination  of  what  a  reasonable  award  of  pain  and  suffering
damages should be for the victim in the following case.

MIRAGLIA v. H&L HOLDING CORP.
799 N.Y.S.2d 162 (N.Y. Sup. 2004)

       , J.

Lane  &Sons  Construction  Corp.,  (Lane),  (third  party  defendant)
moves  to  reduce  the  damages  awarded  to  the  plaintiff,  after  a  jury

trial,  contending  that  the  award  is  excessive  and  materially  deviates
from fair and reasonable compensation.

The  plaintiff  sustained  serious  and  catastrophic  injuries  when  he
fell while traversing a trench at a construction site in the Bronx. As a
result of plaintiff’s fall into a trench at the job site he became impaled
on  a  reinforcement  bar  (rebar)  that  was  surgically  removed  several
hours after his admission to the hospital. It is in this setting that the
jury,  after  a  trial  and  after  hearing  testimony  from  plaintiff’s
physicians  and  other  experts  (that  was  largely  uncontroverted)
regarding  the  devastating  and  traumatic  nature  of  the  injuries  he
sustained, rendered a verdict in the sum of $86 million including $20
million for past pain and suffering and $55 million for future pain and
suffering.

Plaintiff’s  treating  physician  Dr.  Carrano,  the  Director  of  Spinal
Cord Services at Helen Hayes Hospital, described in explicit detail the
nature and effect of the injuries plaintiff incurred. Dr. Carrano provided
the court and jury with a graphic picture of plaintiff’s suffering, stating
in part, that the pain plaintiff continues to experience “is of two types.
He  has  nerve  pain  in  his  legs,  and  that  nerve  pain  is  perhaps  one  of
the worst pains that you could think of. Imagine somebody stabbing
you with a knife, a gazillion times, or with a pin all over the place. That
numbness,  that  tingling,  that  stabbing  sensation”  [is]  “present  all  the
time.  But  it  is  a  constant  pain  and  that  pain  will  not  go  away.”  Dr.
Carrano  depicted  plaintiff’s  chronic  pain  by  providing  the  jury  with  a
vivid description of the damage to plaintiff’s spinal column when the
rebar  went  into  the  area  of  his  spinal  cord  and  the  compression
fracture  also  caused  by  the  pipe  entering  his  body.  Dr.  Carrano
described the emotional pain sustained by the plaintiff caused by the
distress  of  no  longer  having  the  ability  to  walk  and  the  nerve  pain
emanating from his legs which Dr. Carrano testiﬁed was permanent.
The jury also heard testimony regarding plaintiff’s chronic bed sores,
his  catherization  in  order  to  urinate,  his  inability  to  control  bowel

infections  and
movements,  constant  urinary
hospitalization for the conditions described by Dr. Carrano.

track

repeated

Manifestly,  pain  and  suffering  awards  are  not  subject  to  precise
standards that permit a purely mathematically evaluation in order to
determine  whether  a  verdict  deviates  materially  from  what
is
reasonable compensation. CPLR §5501 requires that:

In reviewing a money judgment in an action in which . . . it is contended that the
award is excessive or inadequate and that a new trial should have been granted
unless a stipulation is entered to a different award, the appellate division shall
determine that an award is excessive or inadequate if it deviates materially from
what would be reasonable compensation.

It

is  well  established  that  the

language  quoted,  although
speciﬁcally  directed  to  the  appellate  courts,  also  applies  to  the  trial
court  mandating  the  trial  court  to  review  jury  awards  to  determine
whether  the  award  is  excessive  or  inadequate.  Consequently,  review
under  CPLR  5501  requires  the  trial  court  to  evaluate  whether  the
award  deviates  from  comparable  awards  and  as  the  court  observed
in  Donlon  v.  City  of  New  York,  284  A.D.2d  13,  reviewing  comparable
awards  “cannot,  due  to  the  inherently  subjective  nature  of  non-
economic  awards,  be  expected  to  produce  mathematically  precise
results,  much  less  a  per  diem  pain  and  suffering  rate.”  It  is  also
evident  that  review  of  jury  verdicts  for  personal  injuries  to  ascertain
whether the award is reasonable, involves questions of fact and is the
peculiar  function  of  the  jury.  If  such  principles  are  to  be  accorded
weight,  when  reviewing  the  sufﬁciency  or  excessiveness  of  jury
awards,  the  trial  court  should  not  blindly  substitute  its  judgment  for
that of the jury without affording considerable deference to the jury’s
interpretation of the evidence.

Defendant Lane referred this Court to several cases in an effort to
convince the Court that the award, in the instant case, is not fair and
reasonable. The Court also heard the arguments raised by counsel for
each party and reviewed the cases cited by counsel which purport to

support each party’s position regarding the verdict. At the outset, this
court acknowledges that the verdict rendered by the jury in the case
at bar is unprecedented in view of the evidence presented regarding
plaintiff’s  injuries  and  the  jury  award  clearly  exceeds  what  can  be
considered fair and reasonable.

Lane’s  counsel  submitted  approximately  eighteen  (18)  prior
verdicts  to  “enlighten  the  court  and  in  a  sense,  may  constrain  it”
Senko  v.  Fonda,  53  A.D.2d  638,  639,  to  support  the  contention  that
the  award  for  pain  and  suffering  cannot  be  justiﬁed.  As  previously
stated, this Court recognizes that the jury award which approximates
$86  million  deviates  from  what  can  be  considered  fair  and
reasonable. However, this recognition regarding the size of the verdict
in  the  instant  case  does  not  automatically  carry  with  it  the  court’s
determination that the award falls within the boundaries which Lane
suggests would be a fair and reasonable award for the plaintiff, who
concededly is a paraplegic experiencing constant pain.

[The  court  ﬁrst  reduced  the  jury’s  award  of  $10  million  for  future
medical  expenses  to  $8,294,669,  which  was  the  actual  amount
testiﬁed  to  by  plaintiff’s  expert  witnesses,  a  medical  doctor,  and  an
economist.]

With  respect  to  Lane’s  contention  that  the  award  for  pain  and
suffering deviates from reasonable compensation, counsel direct the
Court’s  attention  to  several  cases  where  the  plaintiff  purportedly
sustained  similar  or  more  signiﬁcant  injuries  than  the  plaintiff  in  the
instant  action  such  as  Schifelbine,  where  the  award  of  $23,218.586
was substantially reduced; Coniker v. State, 181 Misc. 2d 801 (N.Y. Ct.
of  Claims  1999),  23-year-old  quadriplegic,  verdict  of  $10  million
reduced to $6 million; Auer v. State of New York, 289 A.D.2d 626 (3d
Dept., 2001), future pain and suffering award raised from $750,000 to
$1,500,000;  Driscoll  v.  New  York  City  Transit  Authority,  262  A.D.2d
271  (2d  Dept.  1999),  injured  plaintiff  a  paraplegic,  awarded  $10
million  for  past  and  future  pain  and  suffering,  reduced  to  $2  million;
Dimarco v. NYC Health & Hospitals Corporation, 247 A.D.2d 574 (2d

Dept.,  1998),  plaintiff  sustained  brain  damage,  verdict  reduced  to
$1,300,000 for past pain and suffering and $1,500,000 for future pain
and  suffering;  Eccleston  v.  New  York  City  Health  &  Hospitals  Corp.,
266  A.D.2d  426
(2d  Dept.  1999),  plaintiff  sustained  serious
neurological injuries causing sensory paralysis to the lower half of the
infant’s  body,  verdict  for  past  and  future  pain  and  suffering  reduced
from  $7  million  to  $1,425,000;  Karney  v.  Arnot-Ogden  Memorial
Hospital,  251  A.D.2d  780,  674  N.Y.S.2d  449  (3d  Dept.  1998),  infant
plaintiff  sustained  neurological  injuries  including  cerebral  palsy  and
spastic  diplegia,  verdict  reduced  to  $2  million;  Brown  v.  City  of  New
York,  275  A.D.2d  726  (N.Y.2d  Dept.  2000),  quadriplegic  plaintiffs,
separate verdicts for past and future pain and suffering reduced to $4
million; Harvey v. Mazal American Partners, 165 A.D.2d 242 [N.Y. 1st
Dept.  1991],  plaintiff  construction  worker  fell  two  stories,  suffered
incomplete parapeglia, incontinency, $10 million verdict for past and
future pain and suffering reduced and $10 million for future medical
expenses  reduced  to  $7  million;  Nowlin  v.  City  of  New  York,  182
A.D.2d  376  (N.Y.  1st  Dept.  1992),  $7,450,000  verdict  for  past  and
future pain and suffering reduced (by stipulation) to $2.5 million and
the economic loss reduced to $5 million; Bebee v. City  of  New  York,
231  A.D.2d  481  (2d  Dept.  1996),  plaintiff  suffered  paraplegia,  $22
million verdict including $10 million for pain and suffering reduced to
$3,015,000;  Pahuta  v.  Massey-Ferguson  Inc.,  997  F.  Supp.  379
(W.D.N.Y. 1998), a 21-year-old plaintiff sustained paralysis of the lower
half of her body, jury award of $2.4 million afﬁrmed; Barnes v. City of
New York,  N.Y.  L.J.,  Jan.  5,  1999,  at  27  col  1,  Sup.  Ct.  Bronx  County,
plaintiff  was  shot  by  a  police  ofﬁcer,  paraplegia  injury,  $76.4  million
verdict  reduced  to  $1  million  for  past  pain  and  suffering  and  $7.5
million  for  future  pain  and  suffering;  Torres  v. City  of  New York,  259
A.D.2d 693, the plaintiff who sustained a gun shot wound to his back
which caused motor and sensory paralysis of the entire lower half of
his body was awarded $11 million for pain and suffering and reduced
to $2.5 million.

[I]t  is  self-evident  that  reviewing  prior  verdicts  furnishes  “to  the
judicial  mind  some  indication  of  the  consensus  of  opinion  of  jurors
and courts to the proper relation between the character of the injured
and  the  amount  of  compensation  awarded”  (Senko  v.  Fonda,  53
A.D.2d  638).  Evaluation  of  prior  awards,  in  similar  personal  injury
cases  is  intended  to  provide  guidance  to  the  court  in  resolving
disputed  contentions  regarding  the  adequacy  or  inadequacy  of  a
verdict so that issues such as prejudice or sympathy do not become
the  motivating  factor  for  the  award.  The  trial  court,  therefore,  in
reviewing  a  jury  award  must  consider  the  nature  of  the  injury
sustained by the plaintiff, the plaintiff’s age, the physical condition of
the  plaintiff  prior  to  the  occurrence,  the  permanency  of  the  injury
sustained, plaintiff’s ability to return to gainful employment, the pain,
both  physical  and  emotional,  experienced  and  to  be  experienced  in
the future, the extent of future hospitalization and ascertain whether
the  award  in  part  was  generated  by  the  devastating  effect  of
plaintiff’s  injury.  Here,  x  rays  introduced  at  the  trial  showing  the
presence  of  the  rebar  that  entered  plaintiff’s  body  clearly  invoked
sympathy  by  the  jury  causing  in  part,  a  huge  verdict  that  was
intended  to  compensate  the  plaintiff  not  only  for  pain  and  suffering
he sustained but the grief experienced by the impact of the steel rod
entering  his  body.  Manifestly,  modiﬁcation  of  damages  awards
cannot  be  based  on  past  precedents  alone  and  as  the  Appellate
Division appropriately stated in PoYee So v. Wing Tat Realty:

Although  possessing  the  power  to  set  aside  an  excessive  jury  verdict,  a  trial
court  should  nonetheless  be  wary  of  substituting  its  judgment  for  that  of  a
panel  of  fact  ﬁnders  whose  peculiar  function  is  the  ﬁxation  of  damages.
Modiﬁcation  of  damages,  which  is  a  speculative  endeavor,  cannot  be  based
upon case precedent alone, because comparison of injuries in different cases is
virtually impossible.

In  contrast  to  the  cases  cited  by  the  defendant  Lane,  plaintiff’s
counsel submits several cases where jury’s award were signiﬁcantly
larger  than  the  awards  presented  by  the  defendant.  In  Bondi  v.

Bambrick,  308  A.D.2d  330  (1st  Dept.),  plaintiff  was  severely  injured
when she was struck by the defendant who was operating his motor
vehicle while intoxicated. Plaintiff was 35 years of age at the time of
the  accident  and  lost  part  of  one  leg,  underwent  nine  surgeries,
including  skin  grafts,  two  surgeries  involving  removal  and  relocation
of muscle tissue with pervasive scarring and a wound at the area of
the  amputation  that  may  never  heal.  The  court  held  that  the  “total
pain  and  suffering  award  of  $9,750,000”  did  not  deviate  from
reasonable  compensation.  In  Weigl  v.  Quincy  Specialties  Co.,  735
N.Y.S.2d  729,  the  jury  awarded  plaintiff  $20  million  for  pain  and
suffering  that  was  reduced  by  the  trial  court  to  $8  million  and
sustained by the  appellate division,  (N.Y.  1st  Dept.  2003).  Barnes v.
City of New York involved an action brought by a 22-year-old plaintiff
to  recover  damages  sustained  when  he  was  shot  in  the  back  by  a
police ofﬁcer. The gunshot wound rendered Barnes a paraplegic with
multiple  psychological  disorders.  The  trial  court  in  Barnes  reduced
the  jury  award  of  $15  million  for  past  pain  and  suffering  and  $35
million  for  future  pain  and  suffering  to  a  total  of  $9,750,000.  The
Court  in  Mundy  v.  New  York  City  Transit  Authority,  299  A.D.2d  243
(N.Y. 1st Dept. 2002) reviewed a verdict for $20 million for past pain
and  suffering  and  $10  million  for  future  pain  and  suffering  that  was
reduced to $3 million and $5 million respectively. This Court has also
reviewed the award of $14 million to the plaintiff in Waldron v. City of
New York, NYLJ, June 7, 2004, vol. 108; p. 5, who sustained a spinal
injury that rendered him a paraplegic. The injuries he sustained which
also included a T1 fracture, fractured ribs and a punctured lung were
caused  when  he  was  shot  by  a  police  ofﬁcer.  The  Court  denied  the
city’s motion to set aside the verdict.

This Court’s review of the cases set forth in this opinion denotes
the  factors  which  are  considered  in  assessing  what  would  be
reasonable  compensation.  This  process,  now  completed,  does  not
however provide a clear picture that permits the application of some
formula  that  identiﬁes  the  limits  of  compensation  for  injuries  that

parallel  plaintiff’s  suffering.  It  is  undisputed  that  plaintiff  who  at  one
time  was  a  strong  and  vibrant  man  is  now  a  wheelchair-bound
paraplegic.  The  devastating  injury  he  sustained  was  caused  by  the
pipe  that  upon  entering  his  body  destroyed  his  bowel  requiring  a
colostomy  bag  to  collect  his  waste  matter  and  he  is  required  to
manage his bladder with catheters. Plaintiff’s nerve pain in his legs is
continuous  and  permanent.  Such  injuries,  including  those  previously
described, including the permanency of his injuries and his inability to
return  to  gainful  employment,  are  the  factors  that  this  court  has
applied in determining what would be reasonable compensation.

For the foregoing reasons, this Court grants defendant’s motion to
set aside the verdict as excessive unless within 30 days after service
of  a  copy  of  this  decision  and  order  with  notice  of  entry  plaintiff
stipulates  to  reduce  the  jury  award  for  past  pain  and  suffering  from
$20  million  to  $5  million;  for  future  pain  and  suffering  from  $55
million  to  $10  million,  and  for  future  medical  related  expenses  from
$10 million to $8,295,000.

This constitutes the decision and order of the Court.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Comparison  of  Prior  Jury  Awards.   While  it  is  customary  for
judges,  both  trial  and  appellate,  to  consider  other  juries’  awards  in
comparable  cases  to  determine  the  reasonableness  of  general
damage  awards,  courts  forbid  counsel  from  informing  the  jury  of
such awards. This might strike you as somewhat hypocritical, but the
prevailing thought is that it would misdirect the jury’s attention away
from the facts of the particular case before them. Not all courts agree
that  it  is  appropriate  to  consider,  even  on  appeal,  whether  a  jury’s
award  is  consistent  with  other  comparable  cases.  See e.g.,  Ritter  v.
Stanton,  745  N.E.2d  828,  847-849  (Ind.  Ct.  App.  2001)  (suggesting
that aggressive comparability analysis by a court in review of a jury’s

damage  ﬁndings  might  violate  at  least  the  spirit  of  the  Seventh
Amendment’s right to a jury trial).

2. Remittitur and Additur.  The order of the court in Miraglia is an
example  of  a  remittitur.  This  is  when  the  trial  court  advises  the
plaintiff that the plaintiff can either accept a reduction in the damages
or else the trial court will grant a new trial. All courts have the power
of remittitur. Additur is a related concept — when the court gives the
defendant  a  choice  of  either  accepting  an  increase  to  the  damage
award  (when  the  jury’s  award  is  too  low  in  light  of  the  evidence)  or
else the court will grant the plaintiff’s motion for a new trial. Federal
courts do not have the power of additur.

3. Attorney’s  Fees.   U.S.  courts  follow  the  “American  Rule”  which
generally  requires  litigants  to  pay  for  their  own  attorney’s  fees.  The
only primary exceptions to this are when either a statute directs that
the  prevailing  party  recover  their  attorney’s  fees  (often  in  consumer
rights  and  employment  discrimination  statutes)  or  if  a  governing
contract  between  the  litigants  so  provides.  But  in  most  tort  claims,
even  the  prevailing  plaintiff  often  recovers  only  50  percent  to  60
percent of the actual amount awarded by the jury, and that assumes
the defendant has the funds to satisfy the judgment. The remainder
of the award is often taken up by attorney’s fees and other expenses
(e.g.,  expert  witness  fees).  There  is  some  thought  among  plaintiffs’
counsel that one of the pragmatic purposes behind awards of general
damages is to increase the total recovery enough to help the plaintiff
pay off the attorney’s fees while still yielding a sufﬁcient net recovery
to help compensate for more tangible harms.

4. Evidentiary  Support  for  Future  Pain  and  Suffering.   Where  there
is objective evidence that, due to the physical nature of the plaintiff’s
injury,  it  is  plainly  apparent  that  she  will  likely  suffer  future  pain  and
suffering,  the  plaintiff  is  not  required  to  offer  expert  testimony  to
support such an award. On the other hand, where the injury is more
subjective  and  less  obvious  to  cause  ongoing  pain  and  suffering,
most courts require expert medical testimony to support an award of

future pain and suffering. For example, in Krause, Inc. v. Little, 34 P.3d
566, 572 (Nev. 2001), the court held that it was common knowledge
that  broken  bones  can  cause  continued  pain  and  that  no  expert
testimony  was  needed  to  permit  a  jury  award  of  future  pain  and
suffering  damages.  The  court  stated  that  the  injury  itself  was
objective,  being  observable  and  understandable  without  expert
assistance.  Another  plaintiff  complaining  of  sexual  dysfunction,
headaches, and backaches after having ten stitches in his head was
not  permitted  such  an  award  of  future  pain  and  suffering  damages
where  the  only  evidence  to  support  an  inference  of  future  pain  and
suffering was from the plaintiff’s subjective complaints. Thompson v.
Port Authority of New York, 284 A.2d 232, (N.Y. App. Div. 2001).

2. Per Diem Awards

Given  the  uncertainty  and  lack  of  mathematical  precision  regarding
how  the  factﬁnder  should  translate  noneconomic  harms
into
monetary awards, trial lawyers have been creative in trying to help the
jury  with  this  endeavor.  Some  controversies  have  arisen  regarding
certain practices that plaintiffs’ counsel have crafted to help the jury
understand  the  seriousness  of  such  harms.  Consider  the  following
jury  argument  regarding  a  hypothetical  case  with  alleged  pain  and
suffering as an item of possible damages:

Ladies  and  gentlemen,  the  judge  has  instructed  you  that  one  of
the items of damage for your consideration in this case, after you
have  found  the  defendant  negligent,  concerns  my  client  Paul’s
pain and suffering. This item actually refers to two related, serious
harms — his physical pain that he endures constantly, twenty-four
hours each and every day since the date the defendant’s careless
driving  caused  the  horrendous  accident.  You  have  also  heard
Paul’s personal family physician’s expert opinion that this type of
pain  will  likely  be  a  permanent  part  of  the  remaining  twenty-ﬁve

years of his expected life. Imagine that — 25 years of ever-present
pain.  And  there  is  also  the  associated  mental  horror  of  knowing
that his life will be spent enduring such pain. Imagine the toll this
will  take.  The  best  physicians  can  offer  him  no  prospect  of  relief
despite the best medical practices.

You are asked to do something difﬁcult, which is to determine
a  monetary  award  for  this  lifetime  of  hurt.  Let  me  suggest  one
technique that might help you a bit. Imagine what one day looks
like  for  Paul.  Better  yet,  imagine  a  single  hour  of  his  life.  You’ve
seen him grimace while testifying on the stand for about an hour,
after walking slowly to the stand aided by his walking cane and his
persistent limp. Now you have to decide what this pain is worth in
terms  of  dollars.  Let  me  just  suggest  a  possible  ﬁgure  of  $5  per
hour. A pretty small sum isn’t it? Surely his pain is far worse than
that, but we want to be reasonable. You, of course, might decide a
smaller or larger sum is more appropriate. But if you start with a
premise of $5 per hour, in one day he would suffer $120 dollars. In
a  month  that  would  add  up  to  merely  $3,600 — not  a  huge  sum,
considering a whole month of unrelenting pain and anguish. Even
a whole year of that is $43,200. Anyway, you can do the rest of the
math.  Just  take  the  annual  ﬁgure  and  multiple  it  by  Paul’s
undisputed  remaining  life  expectancy  to  reach  a  possible  award
for his future pain and suffering. Perhaps this is helpful for you.

Notice  how  this  argument  breaks  down  the  victim’s  lifetime  of
suffering  into  easily  manageable  units.  Do  you  think  such  an
argument  would  be  more  effective  than  standing  in  front  of  the  jury
and suggesting they award $1,000,000 to the plaintiff for his pain and
suffering?  The  Beagle  case  explores  some  of  the  pros  and  cons  of
this practice and joins the majority view in ruling upon its legality.

BEAGLE v. VASOLD

417 P.2d 673 (Cal. 1966)

    , J.

Plaintiff brought an action against defendants for personal injuries
suffered  by  him  as  the  result  of  an  automobile  accident.  The  jury
returned a verdict in his favor in the sum of $1,719.48, and he appeals
from  the  judgment  entered  thereon,  contending  that  the  damages
awarded are inadequate as a matter of law. The only issue raised on
this  appeal  by  any  of  the  parties  is  whether  the  trial  court  erred  in
prohibiting plaintiff’s counsel from stating in argument to the jury the
amount of general damages claimed by plaintiff, either in terms of a
total sum or of a sum for a time segment. We conclude it was error to
restrict counsel’s arguments in that regard.

Plaintiff’s injuries resulted from an accident in which a car driven
by Kenneth Vasold went over an embankment while rounding a curve
in  the  road.  Vasold  died  as  a  result  of  his  injuries.  Plaintiff  and  two
other  occupants  of  the  car  were  injured.  In  the  complaint,  plaintiff
prayed for $61,025.18 in general damages, as well as compensation
for medical expenses, loss of earnings, and costs of suit.

The  trial  court  informed  plaintiff’s  attorney  in  chambers  that  he
would not be permitted to mention to the jury “the value of his action
in dollars” in a lump sum or as to “any per diem damages such as so
many dollars per day, or so many dollars per month” because “[Such]
is not evidence.” In accordance with this request, counsel conﬁned his
arguments  on  the  question  of  damages  to  the  amount  of  past  and
anticipated  medical  expenses  and  loss  of  earnings,  a  description  of
plaintiff’s  injuries,  and  general  statements  to  the  effect  that  plaintiff
was  entitled  to  recover  for  past  and  future  pain  and  suffering
resulting from the accident.

One of the most difﬁcult tasks imposed upon a jury in deciding a
case involving personal injuries is to determine the amount of money
the plaintiff is to be awarded as compensation for pain and suffering.

No method is available to the jury by which it can objectively evaluate
such damages, and no witness may express his subjective opinion on
the matter. In a very real sense, the jury is asked to evaluate in terms
of  money  a  detriment  for  which  monetary  compensation  cannot  be
ascertained  with  any  demonstrable  accuracy.  As  one  writer  on  the
subject  has  said,  “Translating  pain  and  anguish  into  dollars  can,  at
best,  be  only  an  arbitrary  allowance,  and  not  a  process  of
measurement,  and  consequently  the  judge  can,  in  his  instructions,
give the jury no standard to go by; he can only tell them to allow such
amount as in their discretion they may consider reasonable. . . . The
chief  reliance  for  reaching  reasonable  results  in  attempting  to  value
suffering in terms of money must be the restraint and common sense
of the jury. . . . ” (McCormick on Damages, §88, pp. 318-319.)

[whereby  counsel

Before turning to the question of the propriety of the so-called “per
diem”  argument
in  argument  segments  the
damages into a stated amount of money representing a certain time
period, such as $5 for each day] it is signiﬁcant to note that, while no
case has been found speciﬁcally holding an attorney may inform the
jury  as  to  the  total  amount  of  the  general  damages  sought  by  the
plaintiff,  there  is  a  clear  implication  that  such  a  statement  may  be
made by an attorney, and defendants here do not seriously challenge
plaintiff’s  assertion  that  the  trial  court  erred  in  limiting  counsel’s
argument in this regard.

It has long been a courtroom practice of attorneys in this state to
tell  the  jury  the  total  amount  of  damages  the  plaintiff  seeks,  and  no
questioning of the technique has come to our attention. Moreover, an
attorney  may  and  frequently  does  read  the  complaint,  including  the
prayer, to the jury.

The  question  whether  an  attorney  may  argue  to  the  jury  that  his
client’s damages for pain and suffering may be measured in terms of
a  stated  number  of  dollars  for  speciﬁc  periods  of  time  presents  a
more difﬁcult problem. Few issues in the area of tort law have evoked
more  controversy  in  the  last  decade.  While  no  California  case  has

decided the matter, the controversy has been resolved in most of our
sister states and in some federal jurisdictions.

Twenty-one  jurisdictions  which  have  passed  on  the  issue  permit
an attorney to make the “per diem” argument. [See e.g.,]  Baron Tube
Co. v. Transport Ins. Co., 365 F.2d 858 (5th Cir. 1966); Atlantic Coast
Line R.R. Co. v. Kines, 160 So. 2d 869 (Ala. 1963); Vanlandingham  v.
Gartman, 367 S.W.2d 111 (Ark. 1963); Newbury v. Vogel, 379 P.2d 811
(Colo. 1963); Evening Star Newspaper Co. v. Gray, 179 A.2d 377 (D.C.
Mun.  Ct.  App.  1962);  Ratner  v.  Arrington  111  So.  2d  82  (Fla.  App.
1959); Southern Indiana Gas & Elec. Co. v. Bone, 180 N.E.2d 375 (Ind.
App. 1962; Grossnickle v. Village of Germantown 209 N.E.2d 442 (Oh.
1965);  and  Hernandez  v.  Baucum,  344  S.W.2d  498  (Tex.  Civ.  App.
1961).

In 11 jurisdictions the argument is not permitted. [See e.g.,] Henne
v. Balick, 146 A.2d 394 (Del. 1958); Franco v. Fujimoto, 390 P.2d 740
(Haw.  1964);  Caley  v.  Manicke,  182  N.E.2d  206  (Ill.  1962);  Botta  v.
Brunner, 138 A.2d 713 (N.J. 1958); and Caylor v. Atchison, Topeka &
Santa Fe Ry. Co., 374 P.2d 53 (Kan. 1962).

The conflict has also been thoroughly debated in the law reviews.
An examination of a large number of articles on the subject indicates
that  a  substantial  majority  of  the  authors  are  of  the  view  that  it  is
desirable to permit “per diem” argument.

We believe the reasons hereinafter discussed persuasively require
California to align itself with the majority of jurisdictions on this issue.
The  opening  guns  in  the  battle  to  prohibit  an  attorney  from
arguing  damages  on  a  “per  diem”  basis  were  sounded  in  Botta  v.
Brunner and every decision since Botta holding such argument to be
improper has followed, at least in part, the reasoning employed in that
case.  In  Botta  the  Supreme  Court  of  New  Jersey  upheld  the  trial
court’s refusal to permit plaintiff’s attorney to suggest that his client’s
damages for pain and suffering be measured by a stated number of
dollars for each day, essentially on the rationale that such statements

of counsel are not evidence and have no foundation in the evidence,
but in the minds of jurors they substitute “unproven, speculative and
fanciful standards of evaluation for evidence.”

We do not ﬁnd the reasoning of Botta convincing. It is, of course,
axiomatic that pain and suffering are difﬁcult to measure in monetary
terms. Yet the inescapable fact is that this is precisely what the jury is
called upon to do. As one critic of Botta has noted: “The plaintiff sues
for  money.  The  defendant  defends  against  an  award  of  money.  The
jury
in  terms  of  money.
Nevertheless, the jury must be precluded from hearing any reference

suggests

Thus,  an  attorney  who
that  his  client’s
damages for pain and suffering be calculated on a “per diem” basis is
not presenting evidence to the jury but is merely drawing an inference
from the evidence given at the trial. Of course, the trial court has the
power and duty to contain argument within legitimate bounds and it
may  prevent  the  attorney  from  drawing  inferences  not  warranted  by
the evidence. For example, counsel should not be permitted to argue
future  damages  for  pain  and  suffering  on  a  “per  diem”  basis  where
the evidence would not justify an inference that the plaintiff will suffer
pain in the future.

Another dubious aspect of Botta is its conclusion that an attorney
who  employs  the  “per  diem”  argument  invades  the  province  of  the
jury. It seems patently clear that an attorney does not interfere with a
jury’s  decision-making  powers  to  any  greater  extent  when  he
suggests  that  damages  be  measured  on  a  segmented  basis  than
when he exhorts the jury to ﬁnd the defendant negligent. It has never
been  contended  that  the  jury  forsakes  its  duty  of  determining
whether  the  defendant  acted  as  a  reasonable  man  because  counsel
is  permitted  to  discuss  the  participants’  conduct  and  the  inferences
to be drawn therefrom.

Many  of  the  authorities,  including  Botta,  point  out  that  it  is
logically inconsistent to permit counsel to inform the jury of the lump
sum amount claimed by the plaintiff or to suggest that a certain sum
be awarded, while shielding the jury from the suggestion that the total
amount  may  be  fragmented  to  represent  periods  of  time.  These
cases  reason  that  discussion  of  a  “per  diem”  amount  involves  no
more  speculation  than  a  total  ﬁgure.  Indeed,  in  a  Nevada  case  the
court  stated  that,  while  it  found  the  reasoning  of  Botta  very
persuasive, it felt compelled to allow “per diem” argument because of
the practice in Nevada of telling the jury the total amount of damages

sought  by  the  plaintiff.  Johnson  v.  Brown,  345  P.2d  754,  759  (Nev.
1959). Moreover, the jury itself may calculate the segmented amount
of a verdict which it has under discussion from the ﬁgures available
since,  in  addition  to  the  lump  sum  amount  sought,  it  is  customarily
told the life expectancy of the plaintiff where it is claimed there will be
future detriment.

Some  legal  scholars  indicate  the  actual  subjective  basis  for
decisions  which  hold  the  “per  diem”  argument  improper  is  the  belief
such  argument  results  in  excessive  verdicts  and  that  courts  which
prohibit the “per diem” argument demonstrate a lack of conﬁdence in
the  jury  system.  Even  if  it  can  be  established  that  larger  verdicts
result  on  occasions  when  the  “per  diem”  argument  is  employed,  it
does  not  necessarily  follow  that  these  awards  are  excessive  under
the  circumstances  of  the  particular  cases  since,  as  pointed  out
hereinafter, both the trial and the appellate courts have the power and
the  duty  to  reduce  verdicts  which  are  unreasonably  large.  As  was
stated  in  one  case,  “if  the  evil  feared  is  excessive  verdicts,  then  the
cure  ought  to  be  directed  against  the  product,  not  the  practice.”
Johnson v. Colglazier (1965) 348 F.2d 420, 425, 429.

Other objections made to the use of a mathematical formula are
that it produces an illusion of certainty which appeals to the jury but
can  only  mislead  it  and  that  it  can  result  in  grossly  magnifying  the
total damages by shrewd manipulation of the unit of time employed.
There  are  at  least  two  answers  to  the  foregoing  objections.  First,
whatever manner of calculation is proposed by counsel or employed
by  the  jury,  the  verdict  must  meet  the  test  of  reasonableness.  The
“per  diem”  argument  is  only  a  suggestion  as  to  one  method  of
reaching  the  goal  of  reasonableness,  not  a  substitute  for  it.  Second,
there  exist  meaningful  safeguards  to  prevent  the  jury  from  being
misled. As expected of him by his client, plaintiff’s attorney will urge
the  jury  to  award  the  maximum  amount  of  damages  which  the
evidence  plausibly  justiﬁes,  but  he  has  the  best  of  reasons  for
refraining from grossly exaggerating his claim since, by doing so, he

may  so  tax  the  credulity  of  the  jury  that  it  will  disregard  his  entire
argument.

Denial  of  the  “per  diem”  argument  deprives  counsel  of  the  full
fruits  of  effective  advocacy  on  the  issue  of  damages,  which  is  not
infrequently  the  crucial  conflict  in  the  trial  of  an  action  for  personal
justify  handcufﬁng
injuries.  Only  the  most  persuasive  reasons
attorneys  in  the  exercise  of  their  advocacy  within  the  bounds  of
propriety. We do not ﬁnd them here.

We come, ﬁnally, to the question whether the trial court’s error in
limiting counsel’s argument in the present case resulted in prejudice.
Plaintiff,  a  carpenter  by  trade,  was  39  years  old  at  the  time  of  the
accident.  He  was  hospitalized  for  12  days.  He  suffered  cuts  on  his
head and hands, a sliver of wood became lodged under his eyelid, and
one  of  his  front  teeth  was  chipped  in  the  mishap.  Subsequently,  his
vision  became  impaired.  He  had  not  worn  eyeglasses  prior  to  the
accident  but  was  required  to  obtain  a  pair  shortly  thereafter,  and  a
few weeks after receiving the ﬁrst pair of glasses he suffered another
change
in  his  vision,  requiring  a  different  prescription  for  his
eyeglasses.

Plaintiff did not have any pains in his back before the accident, but
subsequent  thereto  he  had  severe  back  pains  which  radiated  down
his  thighs  to  the  knees.  He  was  required  to  wear  a  back  brace  and
had  been  unable  to  work  in  his  trade  as  a  carpenter  since  the
accident. A medical doctor testiﬁed that plaintiff was suffering from a
congenital  back  defect  known  as  spondylolisthesis  and,  although
there  is  some  conflict  in  the  evidence  on  the  issue,  the  expert
testimony strongly indicates that this condition became symptomatic
as a result of the accident. The doctor also testiﬁed that an operation
costing  $2,000  would  be  necessary  in  order  to  relieve  plaintiff’s
condition. After an examination of the entire record, we are compelled
to conclude that it is reasonably probable that a result more favorable
to plaintiff would have been reached if the trial court had not limited

counsel’s  argument  on  the  question  of  damages  for  pain  and
suffering.

When prejudicial error appears in the determination of the issue of
damages, “It has been held that on an appeal from a judgment where
the evidence as to liability is ‘overwhelming’ a retrial may be limited to
the issue of damages. Where, however, the evidence as to liability is in
sharp  and  substantial  conflict,  and  the  damages  awarded  are  so
grossly  inadequate  as  to  indicate  a  compromise  on  the  issues  of
liability  and  damages,  the  case  should  be  remanded  for  a  retrial  of
both issues.” Clifford v. Ruocco, 246 P.2d 651 (Cal. 1952).

The judgment is reversed.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. The Per Diem Debate.  Though the majority of courts permit per
diem  arguments,  many  such  courts  expect  the  trial  judge  to  remind
the jurors that they are hearing mere arguments of counsel and that
they  get  to  decide  what  the  facts  are  in  the  case.  Nevertheless,  this
admonition  from  the  judge  does  little  to  offer  solace  to  defense
counsel,  who  generally  do  not  want  the  jury  thinking  in  per  diem
terms.  Why  is  it  that  defendants  are  so  opposed  to  the  per  diem
argument,  given  that  it  could  be  used  by  either  side  to  suggest  a
possible award (large or small)? Which objections to this type of jury
argument discussed in Beagle seemed the most persuasive?

2. Golden Rule Arguments.  What if, in addition to the hypothetical
closing argument set forth just before Beagle, plaintiff’s counsel also
said something such as: “Now when I suggest the sum of $5 per hour
for this pain you may think that’s quite a large ﬁgure. You would likely
not  feel  this  way  if  it  were  you  experiencing  an  hour  of  my  client’s
pain. Would you take on a lifetime of the pain and suffering my client
is expected to have for a measly $5 per hour?” In another portion of

the  opinion,  the  court  contrasted  its  ruling  on  per  diem  arguments
with prohibited golden rule arguments:

In  holding  that  counsel  may  properly  suggest  to  the  jury  that
plaintiff’s  pain  and  suffering  be  measured  on  a  “per  diem”  basis,
we  do  not  imply  that  we  also  approve  the  so-called  “golden  rule”
argument,  by  which  counsel  asks  the  jurors  to  place  themselves
in the plaintiff’s shoes and to award such damages as they would
“charge” to undergo equivalent pain and suffering. Id. at 182 n.11.

The  overwhelming

judicial  sentiment  regarding  golden  rule
arguments  is  that  they  improperly  attempt  to  shift  the  focal  point
from  the  actual  victim  to  the  jurors  in  assessing  damages.  The
ultimate  prejudice  with  golden  rule  arguments  is  that  they  appeal  to
the  sentiment  alluded  to  by  Justice  Traynor  in  the  quote  at  the
beginning of this section on general damages — that no sane person
would voluntarily take on a serious injury in exchange for even a room
full of gold. To use such a device to ask the jury to award a room full
of gold is universally condemned.

3. Day in the Life Videos

Another arrow in plaintiff’s counsel’s quiver is a videotaped depiction
of a “day-in-the-life” of the plaintiff introduced to support the plaintiff’s
claim  to  pain  and  suffering  damages.  While  courts  have  broad
discretion under the rules of evidence regarding such videos, counsel
frequently  dispute  the  admissibility  of  particular  videos.  Whether  or
not  the  videotape  is  a  useful  piece  of  demonstrative  evidence  or  a
calculated  appeal  to  the  prejudices  and  sympathies  of  a  jury  is  a
question  trial  courts  have  to  answer  in  many  cases.  Below  is  one
court’s review of such a decision.

DONNELLAN v. FIRST STUDENT, INC.
891 N.E.2d 463 (Ill. App. 2008)

      , J.

On February 11, 2002, plaintiff Vincent Donnellan’s cargo van was
rear-ended by a school bus driven by an employee of defendant First
Student, Inc. Plaintiff, 31 years old on the date of the accident, had no
adverse  health  issues  at  the  time.  Plaintiff  alleged  in  his  complaint
that,  as  a  result  of  the  accident,  he  suffered  numerous  permanent
physical  and  mental  injuries.  Defendant  conceded  its  negligence  in
the accident, but disputed that the accident was the proximate cause
of plaintiff’s alleged injuries.

On April 7, 2006, following several days of trial, the jury returned a
verdict in favor of plaintiff for $6 million. Defendant seeks reversal of
the  jury  verdict  or,  alternatively,  reversal  of  the  damages  award  and
remand for new trial on damages or substantial remittitur. Defendant
argues  that  the  trial  court  abused  its  discretion  and  committed
in  allowing  plaintiff’s  day-in-the-life  video  as
prejudicial  error
demonstrative  evidence.  For  the  following  reasons,  we  afﬁrm  the
verdict of the jury.

On  September  11,  2002,  plaintiff  ﬁled  a  complaint  against
defendant and Earl F. McClendon for injuries allegedly suffered due to
defendant’s  negligence  in  the  February  11,  2002,  accident.  At  the
time,  McClendon  was  defendant’s  employee  and  driving  the  school
bus that rear-ended plaintiff. Prior to trial, McClendon was voluntarily
dismissed and defendant admitted negligence.

Prior  to  the  commencement  of  trial  on  the  issues  of  causation
and damages, the trial court heard the parties’ motions in limine.  At
issue on appeal [is the trial court’s decision] regarding plaintiff’s day-
in-the-life video.

The  parties  and  the  trial  court  watched  the  day-in-the-life  video
that the trial court described as a 4.5-minute video of plaintiff arriving
at  his  therapist’s  ofﬁce  and  going  through  physical  therapy.
Defendant  argued  that  the  video  was  not  demonstrative,  but
substantive medical evidence, and that the audio and video depicted
plaintiff in pain during his therapy session. Defendant claimed that it
was at a disadvantage from the late disclosure as it could not depose
the  therapist  or  videographer  before  trial.  The  trial  court  found  that,
with  the  proper  foundation  from  someone  with  personal  knowledge
that  the  video  truly  and  accurately  depicts  what  it  shows,  the  video
would be allowed as demonstrative evidence without audio. The trial
court  further  granted  defendant  the  right  to  depose  the  physical
therapist in the video.

Plaintiff  testiﬁed  that  [at  the  scene  of  the  accident]  he  was  dizzy
and  had  a  headache,  but  he  refused  treatment  at  the  scene  of  the
accident. A friend drove him home, where he went to bed. Later that
day, plaintiff felt great pain and continued to have a headache so he
went to the emergency room. Plaintiff was diagnosed with a cervical
strain. Two days later, plaintiff returned to the emergency room due to
pain in the lower back and neck.

Plaintiff  testiﬁed  to  the  years  of  consultations,  treatments,  and
physical  therapy  he  had  received,  and  continued  to  receive,  to  treat
his  headaches  and  pain  and  sleep  and  vision  problems  and  to  work
on  regaining  mobility.  Plaintiff  takes  several  medications  but  could
not recall which types. For a period of time, plaintiff received painful
steroid  shots  in  the  base  of  his  neck  to  treat  his  headaches.  While
these treatments seemed to work, they were discontinued as plaintiff
began  to  feel  pain  beyond  the  treatment  time  in  the  area  that  he
received  the  shots.  Plaintiff  also  continued  to  receive  Botox
treatments to try and strengthen his leg.

Plaintiff  testiﬁed  to  his  typical  day  and  week.  On  Monday  and
Thursday,  plaintiff  attends  therapy.  On  the  other  days  of  the  week,
plaintiff  works  for  his  friend  Gavin  Nicholas,  as  his  health  allows.
Plaintiff  works  in  a  supervisory  capacity  at  construction  sites,
assuring
tradesmen  and  contractors  are
coordinated.  After  the  accident,  plaintiff  obtained  his  commercial
driver’s  license  on  his  fourth  attempt.  While  he  still  drives  his  car
short distances, plaintiff can no longer drive trucks or operate heavy
machinery. Plaintiff testiﬁed that he often has to close one eye and tilt
his head to see properly when driving.

the

Plaintiff’s  wife,  Rosanne  Donnellan,  a  pediatrician,  testiﬁed  that
she  and  plaintiff  were  engaged  on  December  24,  2001,  and  married
on  May  25,  2002,  and  that  she  was  pregnant  with  their  ﬁrst  child.
Rosanne  testiﬁed  that  she  ﬁrst  noticed  plaintiff’s  leg  starting  to  turn
in a few months after the accident until it eventually was turned in at
all  times.  Rosanne  stated  that  plaintiff  had  regular  headaches,  back

spasms,  vomiting  due  to  pain,  and  sleep  problems.  In  addition,
plaintiff  complained  of  double  vision  and,  as  a  result,  he  no  longer
reads for enjoyment.

Rosanne  testiﬁed  that  plaintiff  suffers  serious  memory  lapses.
She testiﬁed that she was worried that this was a danger to plaintiff
and  their  household.  Rosanne  also  testiﬁed  that  plaintiff’s  problems
have  resulted  in  a  drastic  decrease  in  the  couple’s  attendance  at
social  functions  because  plaintiff  does  not  want  to  suffer  pain  or
people looking at him.

Dr.  Gary  M.  Yarkony,  board  certiﬁed  in  physical  medicine  and
rehabilitation since 1982, ﬁrst saw plaintiff on July 12, 2002. Plaintiff
complained of neck and back pain when he visited Yarkony. Yarkony
suspected that plaintiff was suffering from a brain injury, including a
cranial  nerve  injury  that  was  causing  a  problem  with  plaintiff’s  eye
muscle. Yarkony stated that this type of injury is typically associated
with  traumatic  brain  damage  and  he  ordered  an  MRI  of  plaintiff’s
brain. Yarkony testiﬁed that the MRI did not demonstrate any issues
and he utilized the later SPECT scan, which identiﬁed a brain injury, in
his  diagnosis.  Yarkony  also  noted  that  he  ﬁrst  observed  plaintiff
walking with an unusual gait on July 16, 2003, during his visit. Using a
“little  rehab  doctor  trick,”  he  observed  plaintiff  walking  in  the  parking
lot as he left the examination to assure it was not an act.

Yarkony testiﬁed that plaintiff suffered a coup contre coup injury,
meaning  an  injury  to  the  brain  at  the  site  of  impact,  the  back  of
plaintiff’s  brain,  and  the  opposite  side,  the  front  of  his  brain.  In
addition, Yarkony diagnosed plaintiff with fourth nerve palsy, dystonia,
myofascial  pain,  allodynia,  occipital  neuralgia,  and  depression.  The
result  of  these  ailments  are  hypersensitivity  to  pain,  cognitive
dysfunctions, double vision, headaches, sleeping and mood problems
and  decreased  ability  to  walk.  Yarkony  opined  that  plaintiff’s
symptoms  will  all  naturally  worsen  as  plaintiff  ages  and  his  body
deteriorates.

[The jury returned a verdict of $6 million for the plaintiff, including]
$82,500  for  the  stipulated  past  medical  expenses,  $3,417,500  for
disability  experienced  and  expected  in  the  future,  $500,000  for
disﬁgurement,  and  $2  million  for  past  and  future  pain  and  suffering.
The  trial  court  denied  defendant’s  post-trial  motion  and  this  appeal
followed.

Defendant  ﬁrst  argues  that  the  trial  court  erred  in  admitting
therapy  video  as  demonstrative  evidence.
plaintiff’s  physical
Defendant  asserts  that  the  video  was  not  timely  disclosed,  an
insufﬁcient  foundation  was  laid,  and  it  improperly  focused  on
plaintiff’s  discomfort  to  elicit  sympathy  from  the  jury.  Defendant
argues that the failure to bar the video . . . resulted in reversible error.
We  review  a  trial  court’s  admission  of  a  day-in-the-life  video  for  an
abuse  of  discretion,  which  occurs  only  when  no  reasonable  person
would agree with the decision of the trial court.

Plaintiff’s  video,  shot  on  March  17,  2006,  is  approximately  ﬁve
minutes long and contains footage of plaintiff exiting his car, walking
into  the  rehabilitation  center,  and  undergoing  therapy  on  his  leg  and
foot.  Plaintiff  produced  the  video  to  defense  counsel  on  March  29,
2006, the day before trial proceedings began. Defendant argues that
because the video was not disclosed until such a late date, in addition
to  the  failure  to  disclose  the  physical  therapist  as  a  trial  witness,  it
was deprived of any opportunity to challenge the evidence.

Defendant continues to argue that plaintiff’s video was not a day-
in-the-life video as it did not simply demonstrate plaintiff’s daily tasks
and  functions.  Defendant  points  to  several  instances  in  the  video
where  plaintiff  grimaces  and  presents  expressions  of  pain  while  his
foot is manipulated by the therapist.

Defendant  points  out  that  this  case  is  unlike  Georgacopoulos  v.
University  of  Chicago  Hospitals  &  Clinics,  504  N.E.2d  830  (Ill.  App.
1987). In Georgacopoulos, this court afﬁrmed the admission of a day-
in-the-life video that included a portion where the plaintiff undergoes

a  painful  physical  therapy  session.  The  court  noted  that  the  therapy
session  was  only  a  portion  of  the  19-minute  video  and  that  the  trial
court described the tape as “‘tasteful.’” The court further distinguished
that case from a federal case that found a day-in-the-life video more
prejudicial than probative because it only showed a physical therapy
session  of  the  plaintiff  that  had  suffered  severe  burns.  Thomas  v.
C.G.  Tate  Construction  Co.,  465  F.  Supp.  566,  569  (D.S.C.  1979).
Defendant  argues  that,  as  in  the  Thomas  case,  plaintiff’s  video  was
only of his physical therapy session and the display of pain by plaintiff
was therefore more prejudicial than probative.

Plaintiff  asserts  that  the  trial  court  properly  rejected  defendant’s
argument  that  the  video  was  more  documentation  of  a  medical
examination  than  demonstrative  day-in-the-life  evidence.  Plaintiff
notes that our courts have stated that day-in-the-life videos constitute
demonstrative  evidence  which  helps  jurors  understand  witness
testimony. [And Plaintiff asserts] that a proper foundation was laid by
Rosanne,  who  testiﬁed  that  she  had  attended  two  physical  therapy
sessions in the past. She testiﬁed that the video accurately depicted
how plaintiff exits his car, how he walks, and how his physical therapy
is  administered.  Plaintiff  argues  that  this  is  all  that  is  required  to
properly lay a foundation for demonstrative video evidence.

First,  we  agree  that  day-in-the-life  videos  are  demonstrative  and
not substantive videos. In addition, the very purpose of these videos
is  to  illustrate  evidence  regarding  a  party’s  life  at  the  time  of  trial.
Accordingly, the disclosure prior to trial was not prejudicial. A day-in-
the-life video is akin to a photograph and admissible if a foundation is
laid by someone having personal knowledge of the ﬁlmed object and
that  the  video  is  an  accurate  portrayal  of  that.  The  video’s probative
value  also  must  not  be  substantially  outweighed  by  the  danger  of
prejudice.

Rosanne certainly knew plaintiff and could testify to his ability to
drive, get out of a car and how he walked. She testiﬁed that she had
attended plaintiff’s sessions with the physical therapist twice and that

the  video  was  an  accurate  depiction  of  plaintiff  and  his  therapy
session.  As  with  a  photograph,  Rosanne  had  personal  knowledge  of
the contents of the video and the trial court properly accepted this as
a foundation.

As  in  Georgacopoulos,  the  video  in  this  case  was  “tastefully”
produced. The video was not produced to improperly precondition the
jury on plaintiff’s theory. Having viewed the video, it does not present
a focus on plaintiff’s pain and discomfort to the exclusion of anything
else.  While  plaintiff  does  wince  and/or  grimace  in  different  spots  in
the  video,  he  also  smiles  and  talks  with  the  therapist.  There  is  no
undue  focus  on  his  pain,  it  simply  focuses  on  a  typical  therapy
session that the evidence at trial indicated would be required for the
rest of plaintiff’s life.

Finally, defendant contends that the jury award of $6 million was
excessive  and  should  be  reversed  with  remand
further
proceedings on that issue or a substantial remittitur must be entered.
The question of damages is speciﬁcally reserved for the trier of fact,
and  we  will  not  substitute  our  judgment  lightly.  We  may  reverse  or
modify  a  damages  award  as  excessive  only  if  it  is  unfair  and
unreasonable,  if  it  results  from  passion  or  prejudice,  or  it  is  so
excessively large that it shocks the conscience.

noneconomic loss determined by the jury was over 70 times greater
than  the  economic  loss  of  the  stipulated  medical  bills.  Defendant
argues that this fact alone makes the verdict shocking and excessive
as  a  matter  of  law.  Plaintiff  responds  by  highlighting  the  great
discretion  granted  to  the  jury  in  setting  the  amount  of  a  verdict  and
also that Illinois does not require any particular ratio of economic loss
to  non-economic  loss  and  that  the  evidence  presented  at  trial
supported the jury’s award.

that

While a damage award for noneconomic damages such as those
suffered  by  plaintiff  is  subject  to  even  less  precision  than  economic
damages or lost wages, it still must be a product of the evidence and
not  passion  such  that  it  is  shockingly  excessive.  As  defendant
indicated,  a  “plethora  of  medical  evidence,”  was  presented  at  trial.
That  evidence  indicated  plaintiff’s  life  will  be  negatively  affected  for
the remainder of his life, with a life expectancy of more than 40 years.
While  it  is  true  that  plaintiff  has  retained  a  certain  amount  of
ability  to  function  since  the  accident  as  defendant  enumerates,  the
evidence  also  showed  that  each  of  those  activities
listed  by
defendant  is  limited  by  plaintiff’s  lost  mobility,  increased  pain,  and
depression.  Furthermore,  testimony  was  given  indicating  that,  as
plaintiff  aged  and  his  body  deteriorated,  his  symptoms  would  likely
worsen. While $6 million is a large sum, it is by no means so large as
to  shock  the  conscience  as  compensation  for  the  lifetime  of
consequences  that  plaintiff  and  his  family  face  due  to  the  physical
and mental limitations posed by his injuries.

Accordingly,  for  the  aforementioned  reasons,  the  decision  of  the

trial court is afﬁrmed.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. The  Evidentiary  Debate.   The  Federal  Rules  of  Evidence  (which
also  provide  a  model  for  most  states’  evidentiary  rules  as  well)
generally  provide  that  evidence  that  is  “relevant”  is  admissible  (Rule
401) so long as it is not unduly “prejudicial” (Rule 403). Though most
courts are willing to consider the admission into evidence of a day-in-
the-life video as relevant evidence of a plaintiff’s pain and suffering as
well  as  of  a  plaintiff’s  physical  limitations  from  a  disability,  courts
frequently  have  to  consider  whether  the  evidence  is  too  prejudicial
and panders to the jury’s emotions. In the above case, the court found

that  the  video’s  depiction  of  the  plaintiff  was  tastefully  done  and
supported by appropriate evidence.

2.  Problem.   Imagine  that  you  are  plaintiff’s  counsel  for  a  client
who suffered a serious spinal cord injury resulting in paralysis below
the shoulders. With the admonition from the Donnellan court in mind
— that a video depicting your client’s daily life and limitations must be
accurate,  tasteful,  and  without  “undue  focus  on  his  pain” — consider
what aspects of your client’s daily life would be suitable to show to a
jury in order to demonstrate the seriousness of his condition. Which
speciﬁc  portions  of  his  daily  life  might  you  seek  to  include  in  the
video?  How  long  is  an  appropriate  length  for  the  video  depiction,
considering  that  you  want  the  jury  to  award  appropriately  high
damages  without  offending  the  jury?  Which  aspects  that  you  might
want to depict would be most objectionable to defense counsel?

4. Hedonic Damages

Beginning  in  the  1980s,  plaintiffs’  counsel,  concerned  that  the
existing  categories  of  general  damages  (e.g.,  pain  and  suffering,
disﬁgurement,  impairment,  mental  anguish)  might  allow  other  harm
to  fall  through  the  compensatory  cracks,  began  advocating  for
recognition  of  another  category  of  general  damages — the  lost
enjoyment  of  life  or  hedonic  damages.  As  you  might  imagine,
defendants  are  not  thrilled  about  adding  yet  another  damage  line  to
verdict forms and have resisted this urging from the plaintiffs’ bar. In
the case below the court wrestles with whether it is fair to recognize
this additional category of damages. It adopts the majority approach.

“Hedonism” comes from the Greek word for “delight” or
“pleasure.”

McDOUGALD v. GARBER
536 N.E.2d 372 (N.Y. 1989)

        , J.

This  appeal  raises  fundamental  questions  about  the  nature  and
role  of  nonpecuniary  damages  in  personal  injury  litigation.  By
nonpecuniary  damages,  we  mean  those  damages  awarded  to
compensate  an  injured  person  for  the  physical  and  emotional
consequences of the injury, such as pain and suffering and the loss of
the ability to engage in certain activities. Pecuniary damages, on the
other  hand,  compensate  the  victim  for  the  economic  consequences
of the injury, such as medical expenses, lost earnings and the cost of
custodial care.

The  speciﬁc  questions  raised  here  deal  with  the  assessment  of
nonpecuniary damages and are (1) whether some degree of cognitive
awareness  is  a  prerequisite  to  recovery  for  loss  of  enjoyment  of  life
and  (2)  whether  a  jury  should  be  instructed  to  consider  and  award
damages  for  loss  of  enjoyment  of  life  separately  from  damages  for
pain and suffering. We answer the ﬁrst question in the afﬁrmative and
the second question in the negative.

On September 7, 1978, plaintiff Emma McDougald, then 31 years
old,  underwent  a  Caesarean  section  and  tubal  ligation  at  New  York
Inﬁrmary.  Defendant  Garber  performed  the  surgery;  defendants
Armengol and Kulkarni provided anesthesia. During the surgery, Mrs.
McDougald  suffered  oxygen  deprivation  which  resulted  in  severe
brain  damage  and  left  her  in  a  permanent  comatose  condition.  This
action  was  brought  by  Mrs.  McDougald  and  her  husband,  suing

derivatively, alleging that the injuries were caused by the defendants’
acts of malpractice.

A jury found all defendants liable and awarded Emma McDougald
a total of $9,650,102 in damages, including $1,000,000 for conscious
pain and suffering and a separate award of $3,500,000 for loss of the
pleasures and pursuits of life. The balance of the damages awarded
to  her  were  for  pecuniary  damages — lost  earnings  and  the  cost  of
custodial and nursing care. Her husband was awarded $1,500,000 on
his derivative claim for the loss of his wife’s services.

[On appeal, the primary dispute] is the award to Emma McDougald
for  nonpecuniary  damages.  At  trial,  defendants  sought  to  show  that
Mrs. McDougald’s injuries were so severe that she was incapable of
either  experiencing  pain  or  appreciating  her  condition.  Plaintiffs,  on
the  other  hand,  introduced  proof  that  Mrs.  McDougald  responded  to
certain stimuli to a sufﬁcient extent to indicate that she was aware of
her  circumstances.  Thus,  the  extent  of  Mrs.  McDougald’s  cognitive
abilities, if any, was sharply disputed.

The parties and the trial court agreed that Mrs. McDougald could
not  recover  for  pain  and  suffering  unless  she  were  conscious  of  the
pain.  Defendants  maintained  that  such  consciousness  was  also
required to support an award for loss of enjoyment of life. The court,
however,  accepted  plaintiffs’  view  that  loss  of  enjoyment  of  life  was
compensable without regard to whether the plaintiff was aware of the
loss.  Accordingly,  because  the  level  of  Mrs.  McDougald’s  cognitive
abilities was in dispute, the court instructed the jury to consider loss
of  enjoyment  of  life  as  an  element  of  nonpecuniary  damages
separate from pain and suffering.

We conclude that the court erred, both in instructing the jury that
Mrs. McDougald’s awareness was irrelevant to their consideration of
damages  for  loss  of  enjoyment  of  life  and  in  directing  the  jury  to
consider that aspect of damages separately from pain and suffering.

We begin with the familiar proposition that an award of damages
to a person injured by the negligence of another is to compensate the
victim, not to punish the wrongdoer. The goal is to restore the injured
party,  to  the  extent  possible,  to  the  position  that  would  have  been
occupied had the wrong not occurred. To be sure, placing the burden
of  compensation  on  the  negligent  party  also  serves  as  a  deterrent,
but  purely  punitive  damages — that
is,  those  which  have  no
compensatory  purpose — are  prohibited  unless  the  harmful  conduct
is intentional, malicious, outrageous, or otherwise aggravated beyond
mere negligence.

for  pecuniary  damages.  An  economic

Damages  for  nonpecuniary  losses  are,  of  course,  among  those
that  can  be  awarded  as  compensation  to  the  victim.  This  aspect  of
damages,  however,  stands  on  less  certain  ground  than  does  an
award
loss  can  be
in  kind  by  an  economic  gain;  but  recovery  for
compensated
loss  of
losses  such  as  pain  and  suffering  and
noneconomic
enjoyment of life rests on “the legal ﬁction that money damages can
compensate for a victim’s injury.” We accept this ﬁction, knowing that
although  money  will  neither  ease  the  pain  nor  restore  the  victim’s
abilities,  this  device  is  as  close  as  the  law  can  come  in  its  effort  to
right  the  wrong.  We  have  no  hope  of  evaluating  what  has  been  lost,
but  a  monetary  award  may  provide  a  measure  of  solace  for  the
condition created.

Our  willingness  to  indulge  this  ﬁction  comes  to  an  end,  however,
when  it  ceases  to  serve  the  compensatory  goals  of  tort  recovery.
When that limit is met, further indulgence can only result in assessing
damages that are punitive. The question posed by this case, then, is
whether  an  award  of  damages  for  loss  of  enjoyment  of  life  to  a
person  whose  injuries  preclude  any  awareness  of  the  loss  serves  a
compensatory purpose. We conclude that it does not.

Simply  put,  an  award  of  money  damages  in  such  circumstances
has no meaning or utility to the injured person. An award for the loss
of  enjoyment  of  life  “cannot  provide  [such  a  victim]  with  any

consolation  or  ease  any  burden  resting  on  him.  He  cannot  spend  it
upon necessities or pleasures. He cannot experience the pleasure of
giving  it  away.”  Flannery  v.  United  States,  718  F.2d  108,  111,  cert
denied 467 U.S. 1226.

We  recognize  that,  as  the  trial  court  noted,  requiring  some
cognitive  awareness  as  a  prerequisite  to  recovery  for  loss  of
enjoyment  of  life  will  result  in  some  cases  “in  the  paradoxical
situation  that  the  greater  the  degree  of  brain  injury  inflicted  by  a
negligent defendant, the smaller the award the plaintiff can recover in
general  damages.”  The  force  of  this  argument,  however — the
temptation  to  achieve  a  balance  between  injury  and  damages — has
nothing to do with meaningful compensation for the victim. Instead,
the  temptation  is  rooted  in  a  desire  to  punish  the  defendant  in
proportion  to  the  harm  inflicted.  However  relevant  such  retributive
symmetry may be in the criminal law, it has no place in the law of civil
damages,  at  least  in  the  absence  of  culpability  beyond  mere
negligence.

that  cognitive  awareness

Accordingly,  we  conclude

is  a
prerequisite to recovery for loss of enjoyment of life. With respect to
pain and suffering, the trial court charged simply that there must be
“some  level  of  awareness”  in  order  for  plaintiff  to  recover.  We  think
that  this  is  an  appropriate  standard  for  all  aspects  of  nonpecuniary
loss.  No  doubt  the  standard  ignores  analytically  relevant  levels  of
cognition,  but  we  resist  the  desire  for  analytical  purity  in  favor  of
simplicity. A more complex instruction might give the appearance of
greater  precision  but,  given  the  limits  of  our  understanding  of  the
human mind, it would in reality lead only to greater speculation.

We  turn  next  to  the  question  whether  loss  of  enjoyment  of  life
should be considered a category of damages separate from pain and
suffering.

There  is  no  dispute  here  that  the  fact  ﬁnder  may,  in  assessing
nonpecuniary  damages,  consider  the  effect  of  the  injuries  on  the

plaintiff’s capacity to lead a normal life. Traditionally, in this State and
elsewhere, this aspect of suffering has not been treated as a separate
category of damages; instead, the plaintiff’s inability to enjoy life to its
fullest has been considered one type of suffering to be factored into a
general award for nonpecuniary damages, commonly known as pain
and suffering.

Recently,  however,  there  has  been  an  attempt  to  segregate  the
suffering associated with physical pain from the mental anguish that
stems  from  the  inability  to  engage  in  certain  activities,  and  to  have
juries provide a separate award for each.

Principles

Though still a minority position,
there has been a trend toward
recognizing hedonic damages
as a separate category of
damages. One scholarly article
urges retrenchment on this
trend for a number of reasons,
but most notably because:
“[a]mong the gravest risks
hedonic damages pose is the
risk of double counting.”

If  we  are  to  depart  from  this  traditional  approach  and  approve  a
separate award for loss of enjoyment of life, it must be on the basis
that  such  an  approach  will  yield  a  more  accurate  evaluation  of  the
compensation due to the plaintiff. We have no doubt that, in general,
the  total  award  for  nonpecuniary  damages  would  increase  if  we
adopted  the  rule.  That  separate  awards  are  advocated  by  plaintiffs
and  resisted  by  defendants  is  sufﬁcient  evidence  that  larger  awards
are  at  stake  here.  But  a  larger  award  does  not  by  itself  indicate  that
the goal of compensation has been better served.

The advocates of separate awards contend that because pain and
suffering  and  loss  of  enjoyment  of  life  can  be  distinguished,  they
must be treated separately if the plaintiff is to be compensated fully
for  each  distinct  injury  suffered.  We  disagree.  Such  an  analytical
approach may have its place when the subject is pecuniary damages,
which  can  be  calculated  with  some  precision.  But  the  estimation  of
nonpecuniary damages is not amenable to such analytical precision
and  may,  in  fact,  suffer  from  its  application.  Translating  human
suffering into dollars and cents involves no mathematical formula; it
rests,  as  we  have  said,  on  a  legal  ﬁction.  The  ﬁgure  that  emerges  is
unavoidably  distorted  by  the  translation.  Application  of  this  murky
process  to  the  component  parts  of  nonpecuniary  injuries  (however
analytically  distinguishable  they  may  be)  cannot  make  it  more
accurate. If anything, the distortion will be ampliﬁed by repetition.

Thus,  we  are  not  persuaded  that  any  salutary  purpose  would  be
served  by  having  the  jury  make  separate  awards  for  pain  and
suffering and loss of enjoyment of life. We are conﬁdent, furthermore,
that the trial advocate’s art is a sufﬁcient guarantee that none of the
plaintiff’s losses will be ignored by the jury.

The errors in the instructions given to the jury require a new trial
on  the  issue  of  nonpecuniary  damages  to  be  awarded  to  plaintiff
Emma  McDougald.  Defendants’  remaining  contentions  are  either
without  merit,  beyond  the  scope  of  our  review  or  are  rendered
academic by our disposition of the case.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Conceptual Purity vs. Practicality.  In rejecting hedonic damages
as  a  separate  item  of  general  recovery,  the  New  York  court  agrees
that  it  is  possible  to  conceptualize  a  difference  between  pain  and
suffering harm and the harm for loss of enjoyment of life’s activities.
If this is the case, why does the court ultimately reject this category
as a separate item of compensation?

2. Awareness of Suffering.  With respect to some of the plaintiff’s
losses, whether or not the plaintiff is conscious makes no difference
in  terms  of  her  right  to  recover  for  it.  Why  does  it  make  sense  to
require consciousness for some items of damage but not all?

3. Majority View.  The opinion of the New York court on the issue
of  whether  hedonic  damages  constitute  a  separate  item  apart  from
pain and suffering represents the clear majority view among courts in
the  United  States.  Some  courts,  however,  permit  a  separate  line  on
the  verdict  form  for  hedonic  damages,  but  most  consider  loss  of
enjoyment to be a part of the broader recovery for pain and suffering.
Yet other courts have held that such items are not recoverable under
any category of recognized general damages. In terms of the closing
arguments  that  might  be  presented  at  the  conclusion  of  a  personal
injury  trial,  does  the  New  York  court’s  holding  substantially  impact
how  the  attorneys  will  approach  the  issue?  If  not,  what  is  the  real
consequence of the holding in most cases?

C. Wrongful Death and Survival Claims

At common law the death of a victim was paradoxically a cause for
celebration  for  the  tortfeasor  because  the  claims  expired  with  the
victim.  That  is,  no  cause  of  action  survived  the  death  of  the  victim.
Ironically,  this  meant  that  it  was  cheaper  for  a  defendant  to  kill  a
victim than just to injure him. This began to change in the ﬁrst half of

the  nineteenth  century  by  certain  acts  of  legislatures.  Today  every
state  has  enacted  wrongful  death  statutes  and  survival  statutes.  A
survival cause of action is owned by the estate of the decedent and
provides for recovery for damages suffered by the decedent from the
time of the tort until his death; such damages might include pain and
suffering damages as well as medical expenses and lost wages. This
claim survives for the beneﬁt of the estate. A wrongful death cause of
action  provides  for  recovery  by  certain  statutory  beneﬁciaries
(typically  the  immediate  family)  to  compensate  for  their  losses
associated with the death of their loved one; that is, a wrongful death
claim  covers  the  harm  to  others  beginning  at  the  moment  of  the
victim’s  death.  Exactly  what  forms  of  damages  are  recoverable,  and
who is entitled to bring suit, are ultimately governed by the terms of
the  applicable  statute.  Many  wrongful  death  statutes  have  been
interpreted  to  provide  for  recovery  of  only  “pecuniary”  losses.  What
this  means  and  whether  a  wrongful  death  beneﬁciary  might  be  able
to sue for an item of general damages has been the subject of many
lawsuits, such as the following case.

JORDAN v. BAPTIST THREE RIVERS HOSPITAL
984 S.W.2d 593 (Tenn. 1999)

      , J.

We  granted  this  appeal  to  determine  whether  spousal  and
parental  consortium  losses  should  be  permissible  in  wrongful  death
actions. Tennessee law previously permitted the anomalous result of
allowing spousal consortium losses in personal injury cases but not
in  cases  of  wrongful  death.  Upon  review  of  the  modern  trend  of
authority  and  careful  scrutiny  of  our  statutory  scheme,  we  hold  that
loss  of  consortium  claims  should  not  be  limited  to  personal  injury
suits.  We  hold  that  the  pecuniary  value  of  a  deceased’s  life  includes
the element of damages commonly referred to as loss of consortium.

This cause of action arises out of the death of Mary Sue Douglas
(“decedent”). The plaintiff, Martha P. Jordan, is a surviving child of the
decedent  and  the  administratrix  of  the  decedent’s  estate.  The
plaintiff,  on  behalf  of  the  decedent’s  estate,  ﬁled  a  medical
malpractice  action  against  the  defendants,  Baptist  Three  Rivers
Hospital, Mark W. Anderson, M.D., Noel Dominguez, M.D., and Patrick
Murphy, M.D. The plaintiff has alleged that the defendants’ negligence
caused the decedent’s death.

The  plaintiff’s  complaint  sought  damages  for  loss  of  consortium
[among  other  items  of  damage  incurred  by  the  decedent].  The
defendants ﬁled a motion to strike and a motion for judgment on the
pleadings asserting that Tennessee law does not permit recovery for
loss of parental consortium.

The  trial  court  granted  the  defendants’  motion  to  strike  and
granted  the  plaintiff  permission  to  ﬁle  an  interlocutory  appeal.  The
Court of Appeals [denied the application for an interlocutory appeal].
We  granted  appeal  to  determine  whether  claims  for  loss  of  spousal
and  parental  consortium  in  wrongful  death  cases  are  viable  in
Tennessee under Tenn. Code Ann. §20-5-113.

A  wrongful  death  cause  of  action  did  not  exist  at  common  law.
Pursuant  to  the  common  law,  actions  for  personal  injuries  that
resulted  in  death  terminated  at  the  victim’s  death  because  “in  a  civil
court the death of a human being could not be complained of as an
injury.” W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts
§127, at 945 (5th ed. 1984) (“Prosser”). “The [legal] result was that it
was  cheaper  for  the  defendant  to  kill  the  plaintiff  than  to  injure  him,
and  that  the  most  grievous  of  all  injuries  left  the  bereaved  family  of
the  victim  .  .  .  without  a  remedy.”  Id.  This  rule  of  non-liability  for
wrongful  death  was  previously  the  prevailing  view  in  both  England
and  in  the  United  States.  East  Tennessee  V.  &  G.  Ry.  Co.  v.  Lilly,  18
S.W. 243, 244 (Tenn. 1891).

In  1846,  the  British  Parliament  enacted  a  wrongful  death  statute
designed to abrogate the common law rule’s harsh effect of denying
recovery  for  personal  injuries  resulting  in  death.  The  English  statute
was  referred  to  as  “Lord  Campbell’s  Act”  and  created  a  cause  of
action  for  designated  survivors  that  accrued  upon  the  tort  victim’s
death.

Jurisdictions  in  the  United  States  were  quick  to  follow  England’s
lead.  In  1847,  New  York  became  the  ﬁrst  American  jurisdiction  to
enact  a  wrongful  death  statute.  Presently,  every  jurisdiction  in  the
United States has a wrongful death statute. These statutes, including
that  of  Tennessee,  embody  the  substantive  provisions  of  Lord
Campbell’s Act and permit designated beneﬁciaries to recover losses
sustained as a result of the tort victim’s death.

Because  a  cause  of  action  for  wrongful  death  is  a  creation  of
statute, recoverable damages must be determined by reference to the
particular statute involved. Although all states have abolished the rule
of  non-liability  when  personal  injury  results  in  death,  the  statutory
methods  of  doing  so  fall  into  two  distinct  categories — wrongful
death statutes and survival statutes.

The  majority  of  states  have  enacted  “survival  statutes.”  These
statutes  permit  the  victim’s  cause  of  action  to  survive  the  death,  so
that  the  victim,  through  the  victim’s  estate,  recovers  damages  that
would  have  been  recovered  by  the  victim  had  the  victim  survived.
Survival  statutes  do  not  create  a  new  cause  of  action;  rather,  the
cause of action vested in the victim at the time of death is transferred
to the person designated in the statutory scheme to pursue it, and the
action  is  enlarged  to  include  damages  for  the  death  itself.  Prosser,
§126,  at  942-43.  “The  recovery  is  the  same  one  the  decedent  would
have  been  entitled  to  at  death,  and  thus  included  such  items  as
wages lost after injury and before death, medical expenses incurred,
and  pain  and  suffering,”  and  other  appropriate  compensatory
damages suffered by the victim from the time of injury to the time of
death. Id. at 943.

In  contrast  to  survival  statutes,  “pure  wrongful  death  statutes”
create a new cause of action in favor of the survivors of the victim for
their  loss  occasioned  by  the  death.  These  statutes  proceed  “on  the
theory of compensating the individual beneﬁciaries for the loss of the
economic  beneﬁt  which  they  might  reasonably  have  expected  to
receive  from  the  decedent  in  the  form  of  support,  services  or
contributions  during  the  remainder  of  [the  decedent’s]  lifetime  if  [the
decedent]  had  not  been  killed.”  Prosser,  §127,  at  949.  Hence,  most
wrongful death jurisdictions have adopted a “pecuniary loss” standard
of  recovery,  allowing  damages  for  economic  contributions  the
deceased would have made to the survivors had death not occurred
and for the economic value of the services the deceased would have
rendered to the survivors but for the death.

Tennessee’s  approach  to  providing  a  remedy  for  death  resulting
from personal injury is a hybrid between survival and wrongful death
statutes, resulting in a statutory scheme with a “split personality.” 27
Tenn. L. Rev. at 454. The pertinent damages statute, Tenn. Code Ann.
§20-5-113, has been in existence in one form or another since 1883.
It provides:

Where  a  person’s  death  is  caused  by  the  wrongful  act,  fault,  or  omission  of
another, and suit is brought for damages . . . the party suing shall, if entitled to
damages,  have  the  right  to  recover  the  mental  and  physical  suffering,  loss  of
time,  and  necessary  expenses  resulting  to  the  deceased  from  the  personal
injuries,  and  also  the  damages  resulting  to  the  parties  for  whose  use  and
benefit  the  right  of  action  survives  from  the  death  consequent  upon  the
injuries received.

Tenn. Code Ann. §20-5-113 (emphasis added).

The  plain  language  of  Tenn.  Code  Ann.  §20-5-113  reveals  that  it
may be classiﬁed as a survival statute because it preserves whatever
cause  of  action  was  vested  in  the  victim  at  the  time  of  death.  The
survival  character  of  the  statute  is  evidenced  by  the  language  “the
party suing shall have the right to recover [damages] resulting to the

deceased  from  the  personal  injuries.”  Thrailkill  v.  Patterson,  879
S.W.2d  836,  841  (Tenn.  1994)  (emphasis  added).  Tennessee  courts
have declared that the purpose of this language is to provide “for the
continued  existence  and  passing  of  the  right  of  action  of  the
deceased,  and  not  for  any  new,  independent  cause  of  action  in
[survivors].” Whaley v. Catlett, 53 S.W. 131, 133 (Tenn. 1899); see also
Herrell  v.  Haney,  341  S.W.2d  574,  576  (Tenn.  1960).  Accordingly,
Tenn.  Code  Ann.  §20-5-113  “in  theory,  preserve[s]  the  right  of  action
which  the  deceased  himself  would  have  had,  and  .  .  .  [has]  basically
been  construed  as  falling  within  the  survival  type  of  wrongful  death
statutes for over a century” because it continues that cause of action
by  permitting  recovery  of  damages  for  the  death  itself.  Jones,  539
S.W.2d at 123-25.

Notwithstanding the accurate, technical characterization of Tenn.
Code Ann. §20-5-113 as survival legislation, the statute also creates a
cause  of  action  that  compensates  survivors  for  their  losses.  The
statute  provides  that  damages  may  be  recovered  “resulting  to  the
parties  for  whose  use  and  benefit  the  right  of  action  survives  from
the  death.”  Id.  (emphasis  added).  Hence,  survivors  of  the  deceased
may  recover  damages  for  their  losses  suffered  as  a  result  of  the
death as well as damages sustained by the deceased from the time
of  injury  to  the  time  of  death.  Our  inquiry  shall  focus  on  whether
survivors should be permitted to recover consortium losses.

The  defendant  argues  that  this  Court  has  previously  held  that
Tenn.  Code  Ann.  §20-5-113  is  a  survival  statute  and  that  survival
statutes generally do not permit recovery under consortium theories.
While  this  Court  in  Jones  v.  Black,  539  S.W.2d  123  (Tenn.  1976),
previously classiﬁed Tennessee’s wrongful death statute as a survival
statute  for  purposes  of  limitations  of  action,  we  are  not  conﬁned  to
interpret the statute according to the strictures of a judicially imposed
classiﬁcation when such an interpretation would ignore unambiguous
statutory language. Accordingly, our analysis of Tenn. Code Ann. §20-
5-113 shall focus on the statute’s language and not on what damages

that,  notwithstanding

“survival”  statutes  in  other  states  generally  permit.  It  must  be
remembered
technical
characterization of Tenn. Code Ann. §20-5-113 as survival legislation,
the  statute  also  provides  for  a  cause  of  action  that  compensates
survivors for their losses.

the  accurate,

Damages under our wrongful death statute can be delineated into
two  distinct  classiﬁcations.  The  ﬁrst  classiﬁcation  permits  recovery
for  injuries  sustained  by  the  deceased  from  the  time  of  injury  to  the
time of death. Damages under the ﬁrst classiﬁcation include medical
expenses,  physical  and  mental  pain  and  suffering,  funeral  expenses,
lost wages, and loss of earning capacity.

The  second  classiﬁcation  of  damages  permits  recovery  of
incidental damages suffered by the decedent’s next of kin. Incidental
damages have been judicially deﬁned to include  the  pecuniary  value
of  the  decedent’s  life.  Pecuniary  value  has  been  judicially  deﬁned  to
include  “the  expectancy  of  life,  the  age,  condition  of  health  and
strength, capacity for labor and earning money through skill, any art,
trade, profession and occupation or business, and personal habits as
to sobriety and industry.” Id. Pecuniary value also takes into account
the  decedent’s  probable  living  expenses  had  the  decedent  lived.
Wallace v. Couch, 642 S.W.2d 141 (Tenn. 1982).

The  wrongful  death  statute  neither  explicitly  precludes
consortium damages nor reflects an intention to preclude consortium
damages.  The  statute’s  language  does  not  limit  recovery  to  purely
economic  losses.  To  the  contrary,  the  statute’s  plain  language
appears to encompass consortium damages.

Indeed, this Court has recognized that pecuniary value cannot be
deﬁned  to  a  mathematical  certainty  as  such  a  deﬁnition  “would
overlook the value of the [spouse’s] personal interest in the affairs of
the  home  and  the  economy  incident  to  [the  spouse’s]  services.”
Thrailkill,  879  S.W.2d  at  841.  We  further  believe  that  the  pecuniary
value of a human life is a compound of many elements. An individual

family member has value to others as part of a functioning social and
economic  unit.  This  value  necessarily  includes  the  value  of  mutual
i.e.  human  companionship.  Human
society  and  protection,
companionship  has  a  deﬁnite,  substantial  and  ascertainable
pecuniary value, and its loss forms a part of the value of the life we
seek  to  ascertain.  Moreover,  it  seems  illogical  and  absurd  to  believe
that the legislature would intend the anomaly of permitting recovery
of consortium losses when a spouse is injured and survives but not
when the very same act causes a spouse’s death.

The wrongful death statute precludes neither a minor child nor an
adult  child  from  seeking  compensation  for  the  child’s  consortium
losses.

A  review  of  case  law  in  other  jurisdictions  indicates  a  trend  to
expand  consortium  claims  to  include  the  impairment  of  a  child’s
relationship  with  a  parent.  In  cases  involving  a  parent’s  death,  “the
general  rule  .  .  .  followed  is  that  a  child’s  loss  of  nurture,  education
and  moral  training  which  it  probably  would  have  received  from  a
parent  wrongfully  killed  is  a  pecuniary  loss  to  be  considered  as  an
element of the damages suffered by the child.” Recovery for Wrongful
Death at §3:47 (listing thirty-four jurisdictions so holding). See also 94
Va. L. Rev. at 266 (“Most states allow a surviving child to recover for
loss of consortium where a parent is tortiously killed.”); Prosser, §127,
at  952  (“Even  jurisdictions  that  have  rejected  the  loss  of  society  or
consortium  claim,  as  such,  have  permitted  one  form  of  it,  namely  a
loss  of  guidance  and  advice  that  the  decedent  would  have  provided
[to the child].”).

A basis for placing an economic value on parental consortium is
that the education and training which a child may reasonably expect
to  receive  from  a  parent  are  of  actual  and  commercial  value  to  the
child.  Accordingly,  a  child  sustains  a  pecuniary  injury  for  the  loss  of
parental  education  and  training  when  a  defendant  tortiously  causes
the death of the child’s parent.

The  additional  considerations  employed  for  spousal  consortium
may be applicable to parental consortium claims. We agree with the
observation  of  one  court  that  “companionship,  comfort,  society,
guidance,  solace,  and  protection  .  .  .  go  into  the  vase  of  family
happiness [and] are the things for which a wrongdoer must pay when
he shatters the vase.” Spangler v. Helm’s New York-Pittsburgh Motor
Exp., 153 A.2d 490 (Penn. 1959).

Adult children may be too attenuated from their parents in some
cases to proffer sufﬁcient evidence of consortium losses. Similarly, if
the  deceased  did  not  have  a  close  relationship  with  any  of  the
statutory  beneﬁciaries,  the  statutory  beneﬁciaries  will  not  likely
sustain  compensable  consortium  losses  or  their  consortium  losses
will  be  nominal.  The  age  of  the  child  does  not,  in  and  of  itself,
preclude  consideration  of  parental  consortium  damages.  The  adult
child  inquiry  shall  take  into  consideration  factors  such  as  closeness
of the relationship and dependence (i.e., of a handicapped adult child,
assistance with day care, etc.).

We hold that consortium-type damages may be considered when
calculating the pecuniary value of a deceased’s life. This holding does
not  create  a  new  cause  of  action  but  merely  reﬁnes  the  term
“pecuniary  value.”  Consortium  losses  are  not  limited  to  spousal
claims but also necessarily encompass a child’s loss, whether minor
or  adult.  Loss  of  consortium  consists  of  several  elements,
encompassing  not  only  tangible  services  provided  by  a  family
member,  but  also  intangible  beneﬁts  each  family  member  receives
from the continued existence of other family members. Such beneﬁts
include attention, guidance, care, protection, training, companionship,
cooperation,  affection,  love,  and  in  the  case  of  a  spouse,  sexual
relations.  Our  holding  conforms  with  the  plain  language  of  the
wrongful death statutes, the trend of modern authority, and the social
and economic reality of modern society.

The decision of the trial court granting the defendants’ motion to

strike is reversed.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Wrongful  Death  and  Survival  Statutes.   In  Jordan,  the  court
devotes  time  to  distinguishing  between  wrongful  death  and  survival
statutes — these differences relate to (a) who owns the claim, (b) who
is  the  “victim”  who  is  the  focal  point  in  assessing  damages,  (c)  the
timing  of  when  the  recoverable  damages  are  incurred,  and  (d)  the
types  of  damages  recoverable.  To  a  large  extent,  the  intricate
answers  to  these  questions  are  found  in  each  state’s  respective
statutes. In general though, how did Jordan answer these questions?
As  between  wrongful  death  and  survival  claims,  do  you  believe  one
will tend to be of greater value than the other?

2.  Loss  of  Consortium  Recovery.   The  court

in  McDougald
mentioned that the husband received a jury award of $1.5 million for
loss  of  household  services  of  his  wife.  Courts  have  traditionally
permitted  a  spouse’s  right  to  recover  for  the  personal  loss  arising
from the serious disability of a husband or wife. Typically referred to
as loss of consortium damages, such recovery is intended to provide
compensation  for  harms  to  the  relationship  as  well  as  the  loss  of
personal  services  provided  by  that  spouse.  In  Jordan,  the  court
confronted  the  issue  of  whether  the  state’s  wrongful  death  statute
permitted  a  loss  of  consortium  claim  and  whether  this  should  allow
an  adult  child  to  recover  for  the  wrongful  death  of  a  parent.  Many
courts  now  recognize  such  claims  by  one  whose  parent  is  killed.
Courts  have  also  recently  recognized  a  loss  of  “ﬁlial”  consortium
claim for the parent of a deceased child. Most courts, however, refuse
to extend loss of consortium claims to cover other relationships, such
as grandparent-grandchild, siblings, friends, or even a ﬁancée.

3. Derivative Nature of Claim.  Where a loss of consortium claim is
recognized, it is derivative  of  the  primary  victim’s  claim.  This  means
that  any  defense  the  defendant  may  have  to  the  primary  victim’s
claim  also  applies  with  equal  force  to  the  loss  of  consortium  claim
(including comparative fault or the primary victim’s assumption of the

risk). If the primary victim is apportioned a level of fault, the owner of
the  derivative  cause  of  action  for  loss  of  consortium  is  equally
impacted by this apportionment (this could result in either a reduction
or elimination of their claim, depending upon the type of comparative
fault  system  and  the  levels  of  apportioned  fault).  Wrongful  death
claims  are  similarly  derivative  of  the  decedent’s  survival  cause  of
action and subject to the same afﬁrmative defenses.

4.  Overlap  Between  Bystander  Injury  and  Lost  Consortium.
Previously  in  Chapter  6  on  Special  Duty  Rules,  we  explored  courts’
willingness to permit a claim, in Dillon jurisdictions, for the emotional
distress  of  witnessing  the  death  or  serious  injury  of  a  loved  one.  In
such  a  scenario,  the  family  member  witnessing  the  tragic  accident
would  likely  also  have  a  loss  of  consortium  claim  if  the  victim  were
either a spouse or a parent/child of the witness. Signiﬁcant potential
overlap  exists  between  one’s  bystander  claim  for  emotional  anguish
and  the  loss  of  consortium  arising  from  the  same  accident.  The
difference  between  them  is  that  the  bystander  claim  remedies  the
harm  from  witnessing  the  event  while  the  consortium  claim  arises
from  the  ensuing  negative  impact  on  the  relationship  between  the
witness and victim. In the real world of a jury box, one wonders how
easily  a  typical  juror  could  maintain  such  distinction  in  assessing
damages.

5.  Problems.   Imagine  a  trafﬁc  accident  occurs  on  an  interstate
freeway,  causing  severe  injuries  to  the  plaintiff.  The  plaintiff  is  taken
to a hospital and treated for a week prior to her death. With respect to
the Tennessee wrongful death and survival statute interpreted by the
court  in  Jordan,  try  to  classify  each  of  the  following  components  of
harm as either appropriate damages for a wrongful death claim or for
a survival claim:

A. The cost of an ambulance taking the plaintiff-decedent from the

scene of the accident to the hospital.

B. Hospital bills incurred in treating the plaintiff-decedent’s injuries,
including  medicines,  room  costs,  treatment  expenses,  MRI
exams, etc.

C.  Disﬁgurement  to  the  plaintiff’s  face  from  burns  received  in  the

accident.

D. Funeral and burial expenses.
E.  Pain  experienced  by  plaintiff-decedent  once  she  became

conscious until she passed away.

F.  Lost  wages  of  the  plaintiff-decedent  during  the  week  between

the accident and her death.

G.  The  lost  future  earnings  that  would  likely  have  been  used  to
provide support to the plaintiff-decedent’s immediate family.
H.  The  loss  associated  with  the  plaintiff-decedent’s  spouse  and

children in losing the plaintiff-decedent.

I.  The  cost  of  the  household  services  likely  to  be  incurred  in  the
future that would have normally been performed by the plaintiff-
decedent (e.g., mowing the lawn regularly).

J.  The  loss  of  enjoyment  of  the  daily  activities  of  life  experienced

by the plaintiff-decedent prior to her death.

D. Property Damages

Where  the  defendant’s  misconduct  has  caused  property  damage,  a
typical  method  of  calculating  this  item  of  special  damage  is  to  use
the  difference  between  the  market  value  of  the  property  prior  to  the
tort  and  after  the  tort.  The  reduction  in  the  amount  is  the  lost  fair
market  value  of  the  property.  Of  course,  where  the  property  is
completely  destroyed  due  to  the  defendant’s  tort,  the  entire  market
value  at  the  time  of  its  destruction  becomes  recoverable.  Market
value  is  what  the  property  could  have  been  sold  for  on  the  open
market  in  a  voluntary  sale  to  a  willing  buyer.  Where  the  property  is
merely damaged and it is unclear how this damage has impacted the

market value, courts often permit consideration of the costs of repair
of  the  item  as  a  substitute  method  for  calculating  the  damage.
Generally,  costs  of  repair  as  an  alternative  calculation  of  damage
should  not  exceed  the  actual  market  value  of  the  unimpaired  item.
When the plaintiff cannot use the property for a signiﬁcant period of
time as a result of the defendant’s tort, courts will permit recovery of
a reasonable rental cost as a way to determine the damages for the
loss of use of the item. Each of these calculations of actual damage
would  be  in  the  nature  of  special  or  economic  losses.  As  to  these
items  of  damage,  little  controversy  exists  in  terms  of  the  principles
governing providing a remedy.

While  these  damage  models  are  relatively  straightforward  in  tort
cases  involving  harm  to  personal  property,  plaintiffs  in  some  such
cases have made creative attempts to recover for additional items of
loss. The following recent case involving an injury to someone’s dog
portrays  such  an  attempt.  As  you  read  the  opinion,  consider  the
rationales  behind  courts’  reluctance  to  permit  recovery  of  general
damages for injury to most types of personal property.

STRICKLAND v. MEDLEN
397 S.W. 3d 184 (Tex. 2013)

       , J.

Beauty without Vanity,
Strength without Insolence,
Courage without Ferocity,
4
And all the Virtues of Man without his Vices

Texans  love  their  dogs.  Throughout  the  Lone  Star  State,  canine
companions  are  treated — and  treasured — not  as  mere  personal
property but as beloved friends and conﬁdants, even family members.

Given the richness that companion animals add to our everyday lives,
losing “man’s best friend” is undoubtedly sorrowful. Even the gruffest
among us tears up (every time) at the end of Old Yeller.

This case concerns the types of damages available for the loss of
a family pet. If a cherished dog is negligently killed, can a dollar value
be placed on a heartsick owner’s heartfelt affection? More pointedly,
may  a  bereaved  dog  owner  recover  emotion-based  damages  for  the
loss?  In  1891,  we  effectively  said  no,  announcing  a  “true  rule”  that
categorized  dogs  as  personal  property,  thus  disallowing  non-
economic  damages.  In  2011,  however,  a  court  of  appeals  said  yes,
effectively  creating  a  novel — and  expansive — tort  claim:  loss  of
companionship for the wrongful death of a pet.

In  today’s  case,  involving  a  family  dog  that  was  accidentally
euthanized, we must decide whether to adhere to our restrictive, 122-
year-old precedent classifying pets as property for tort-law purposes,
or  to  instead  recognize  a  new  common-law  loss-of-companionship
claim that allows non-economic damages rooted solely in emotional
attachment, a remedy the common law has denied those who suffer
the  wrongful  death  of  a  spouse,  parent,  or  child,5  and  is  available  in
Texas only by [the enactment of a wrongful death] statute.

We  acknowledge  the  grief  of  those  whose  companions  are
negligently  killed.  Relational  attachment  is  unquestionable.  But  it  is
also  uncompensable.  We  reafﬁrm  our  long-settled  rule,  which  tracks
the  overwhelming  weight  of  authority  nationally,  plus  the  bulk  of
amicus  curiae  briefs  from  several  pet-welfare  organizations  (who
understand  the  deep  emotional  bonds  between  people  and  their
animals): Pets are property in the eyes of the law, and we decline to
permit non-economic damages rooted solely in an owner’s subjective
feelings. True, a beloved companion dog is not a fungible, inanimate
object like, say, a toaster. The term “property” is not a pejorative but a
its  use  should  not  be  misconstrued  as
legal  descriptor,  and
discounting  the  emotional  attachment  that  pet  owners  undeniably

feel.  Nevertheless,  under  established  legal  doctrine,  recovery  in  pet-
death  cases  is,  barring  legislative  reclassiﬁcation,  limited  to  loss  of
value, not loss of relationship.

We reverse the court of appeals’ judgment and render judgment in

favor of the [defendant].

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

In  June  2009,  Avery,  a  mixed-breed  dog  owned  by  Kathryn  and
Jeremy  Medlen,  escaped  the  family’s  backyard  and  was  promptly
picked up by Fort Worth animal control. Jeremy went to retrieve Avery
but lacked enough money to pay the required fees. The shelter hung a
“hold  for  owner”  tag  on  Avery’s  cage  to  alert  employees  that  the
Medlens  were  coming  for  Avery  and  ensure  he  was  not  euthanized.
Despite  the  tag,  shelter  worker  Carla  Strickland  mistakenly  placed
Avery on the euthanasia list, and he was put to sleep.

Jeremy  and  his  two  children  learned  of  Avery’s  fate  a  few  days
later  when  they  returned  to  retrieve  him.  Devastated,  the  Medlens
sued Strickland for causing Avery’s death and sought “sentimental or
intrinsic value” damages since Avery had little or no market value but
was  irreplaceable.  Strickland  specially  excepted,  contending  such
damages  are  unrecoverable  in  pet-death  cases.  The  trial  court
directed  the  Medlens  to  amend  their  pleadings  to  “state  a  claim  for
damages  recognized  at  law.”  The  Medlens  amended  their  petition  to
drop the words “sentimental value” but realleged damages for Avery’s
“intrinsic value.” Strickland specially excepted on the same basis, and
the trial court, sure that Texas law barred such damages, dismissed
the suit with prejudice.

The  court  of  appeals  reversed,  becoming  the  ﬁrst  Texas  court  to
hold that a dog owner may recover intangible loss-of-companionship
damages  in  the  form  of  intrinsic  or  sentimental-value  property
damages.  Addressing  our  1891  decision  in  Heiligmann  v.  Rose  [16
S.W. 931], which pegged dog-loss damages to market value or a value

ascertained  from  the  dog’s  “usefulness  and  services,”  the  court  of
appeals  stated,  “Texas  law  has  changed  greatly  since  1891”  and
“sentimental  damages  may  now  be  recovered  for  .  .  .  all  types  of
personal  property.”  Reinstating  the  Medlens’  claim,  the  court  of
appeals  concluded:  “Because  an  owner  may  be  awarded  damages
based  on  the  sentimental  value  of  lost  personal  property,  and
because dogs are personal property, the trial court erred in dismissing
the Medlens’ action against Strickland.”

This  appeal  followed,  posing  a  single,  yet  signiﬁcant,  issue:
whether  emotional-injury  damages  are  recoverable  for  the  negligent
destruction of a dog.

DISCUSSION

America is home to 308 million humans and 377 million pets. In fact,
“American pets now outnumber American children by more than four
to one.” In a nation with about 78 million pet dogs and 86 million pet
cats (and 160 million pet ﬁsh), where roughly 62% of households own
a pet, it is unsurprising that many animal owners view their pets not
as  mere  personal  property  but  as  full-fledged  family  members,  and
treat them as such:

A  study  found  that  70%  of  pet  owners  thought  of  their  pets  as
family members.
45% of dog owners take their pets on vacation.
Over 50% of pet owners say they would rather be stranded on a
deserted island with a dog or cat than with a human.
50% of pet owners report being “very likely” to put their own lives
in  danger  to  save  their  pets,  and  33%  are  “somewhat  likely”  to
risk their lives.
In 2012, Americans spent roughly $53 billion on their pets.

The  human-animal  bond  is  indeed  powerful.  As  the  Medlens’
second  amended  petition  states:  “The  entire  Medlen  family  was

devastated  by  the  loss  of  Avery,  who  was  like  a  family  member  to
them.”  Countless  Texas  families  share  this  pets-as-family  view,  but
Texas  law,  for  a  century-plus,  has  labeled  them  as  “property”  for
purposes of tort-law recovery.

Our  analysis  begins  with  Heiligmann  v.  Rose,  our  1891  case
upholding  $75  in  damages  for  the  poisoning  of  three  “well  trained”
Newfoundland  dogs.  Heiligmann  articulated  some  key  valuation
principles  for  animal  cases.  First,  we  classiﬁed  dogs  as  personal
property  for  damages  purposes,  not  as  something  giving  rise  to
personal-injury  damages.  Second,  we  declared  a  “true  rule”  for
damages  that  flags  two  elements:  (1)  “market  value,  if  the  dog  has
any,” or (2) “some special or pecuniary value to the owner, that may be
ascertained by reference to the usefulness and services of the dog.”

In Heiligmann, the dogs “were of ﬁne breed, and well trained,” with
one  using  different  barks  to  signal  whether  an  approaching  person
was a man, woman, or child. While the owner could sell each dog for
$5,  they  had  no  market  value  beyond  that,  but  the  Court  upheld
damages of $25 each:

There  is  no  evidence  in  this  case  that  the  dogs  had  a  market  value,  but  the
evidence  is  ample  showing  the  usefulness  and  services  of  the  dogs,  and  that
they were of special value to the owner. If the jury from the evidence should be
satisﬁed  that  the  dogs  were  serviceable  and  useful  to  the  owner,  they  could
infer  their  value  when  the  owner,  by  evidence,  ﬁxes  some  amount  upon  which
they could form a basis.

The Medlens insist that Heiligmann does not limit recovery to an
amount based solely on the dog’s economic usefulness and services.
Rather, when the Court mentioned certain dogs lacking market value
but  having  “a  special  value  to  the  owner,”  we  meant  something  far
broader  and  distinct  from  the  dogs’  commercial  attributes.  Similarly,
argue  the  Medlens,  when  the  Court  in  Heiligmann  noted  a  dog’s
“special or pecuniary value to the owner,” the word “or” indicates two
distinct  categories  of  non-market  value  dogs — those  with  a  special

value to the owner, and those with a pecuniary value to the owner. We
disagree.

Given  its  ordinary,  contextual  meaning,  Heiligmann  tied  the
recovery of “special or pecuniary value” to the dogs’ “usefulness and
services” — their  economic  value,  not  their  sentimental  value.  While
we referenced evidence “showing the usefulness and services of the
dogs,  and  that  they  were  of  a  special  value  to  the  owner,”  the  next
conditional  sentence  pegs  the  jury’s  valuation  decision  to  the  dogs’
economic attributes: “If the jury from the evidence should be satisﬁed
that  the  dogs  were  serviceable  and  useful  to  the  owner.  .  .  .  ”  The
implication,  any  evidence
decision  never  references,  even  by
regarding companionship or owner affection.

Thus,  a  dog’s  “special  or  pecuniary  value”  refers  not  to  the  dog-
human bond but to the dollars-and-cents value traceable to the dog’s
usefulness and services. Such value is economic value, not emotional
value  based  on  affection,  attachment,  or  companionship.  In  short,
Heiligmann’s  use  of  the  word  “special”  does  not  authorize  “general
damages” and does not refer generically to a dog’s ability to combat
loneliness, ease depression, or provide security. The valuation criteria
is not emotional and subjective; rather it is commercial and objective.
[the]  post-Heiligmann
decision  [in]  Brown  v.  Frontier  Theatres,  Inc.  [369  S.W.2d  299  (Tex.
1963)] entitles property owners to seek intrinsic or sentimental-value
damages  for  certain  destroyed  property  that  lacks  market  value  or
“special  or  pecuniary”  value.  Because  dogs  are  considered  property
under  Texas  law,  they  should  be  treated  no  differently,  argue  the
Medlens.  Accordingly,  Avery’s  intrinsic  value  to  them,  including
companionship,  is  recoverable.  We  decline  to  stretch  our  post-
Heiligmann decisions this far.

Alternatively,  the  Medlens  assert  that

Our  decision  a  half-century  ago  in  Brown  involved  irreplaceable
family  heirlooms  such  as  a  wedding  veil,  pistol,  jewelry,  hand-made
bedspreads  and  other  items  going  back  several  generations — in

other  words,  family  keepsakes  that  “have  their  primary  value  in
sentiment.” Such one-of-a-kind heirlooms have a “special value . . . to
their owner,” and damages may factor in “the feelings of the owner for
such  property.”  Notably,  on  the  same  day  we  decided  Brown  ﬁfty
years ago, we reafﬁrmed in another case the default damages rule for
destroyed  non-heirloom  property  lacking  market  or  replacement
value:
the
owner  .  .  .  excluding  any  fanciful  or  sentimental  considerations.”
[Crisp v. Sec. Nat’l Ins. Co., 369 S.W.2d 326, 328 (Tex. 1963).]

to

Heiligmann  remains  our  lone  case  directly  on  point,  and  after  a
century-plus  we  are  loathe  to  disturb  it.  An  owner’s  attachment  to  a
one-of-a-kind  family  keepsake  as  in  Brown  is  sentimental,  but  an
owner’s  attachment  to  a  beloved  pet  is  more:  It  is  emotional.  Pets
afford  here-and-now  beneﬁts — company,  recreation,  protection,  etc.
— unlike  a  passed-down  heirloom  kept  around  chiefly
to
commemorate past events or passed family members. We agree with
the  amicus  brief  submitted  by  the  American  Kennel  Club  (joined  by
several  other  pet-welfare  groups):  “While  no  two  pets  are  alike,  the
emotional attachments a person establishes with each pet cannot be
shoe-horned into keepsake-like sentimentality for litigation purposes.”
Finally,  .  .  .  permitting  sentiment-based  damages  for  destroyed
heirloom property portends nothing resembling the vast public-policy
impact of allowing such damages in animal-tort cases.

Columnist  George  Will  expressed  pleasure  in  the  Strickland
court’s decision to stick with its 1891 “true value” doctrine:

By this judicial statesmanship, the trial bar was muzzled, for
now,  and  denied  a  fresh  arena  for  mischief.  So  Texas’  Supreme
Court is, for now, man’s best friend.

George  F.  Will,  Texas  Court  Limits  Lawyers  in  Pet-Related

Suits, Washington Post (May 29, 2013).

Loss  of  companionship,  the  gravamen  of  the  Medlens’  claim,  is
fundamentally  a  form  of  personal-injury  damage,  not  property
damage.  It  is  a  component  of  loss  of  consortium,  including  the  loss
of
“love,  affection,  protection,  emotional  support,  services,
companionship,  care,  and  society.”  Loss-of-consortium  damages  are
available  only  for  a  few  especially  close  family  relationships,  and  to
allow  them  in  lost  pet  cases  would  be  inconsistent  with  these
limitations.  Therefore,  like  courts  in  the  overwhelming  majority  of
other  states,  the  Restatement  of  the  Law  of  Torts,  and  the  other
Texas courts of appeals that have considered this question, we reject
emotion-based  liability  and  prohibit  recovery  for  loss  of  the  human-
animal bond.

We  do  not  dispute  that  dogs  are  a  special  form  of  personal
property.  That  is  precisely  why  Texas  law  forbids  animal  cruelty
generally  (both  civilly  and  criminally),  and  bans  dog  ﬁghting  and
unlawful  restraints  of  dogs  speciﬁcally — because  animals,  though
property, are unique. Most dogs have a simple job description: provide
devoted companionship. We have no need to overrule Brown’s narrow
heirloom exception today; neither do we broaden it to pet-death cases
and  enshrine  an  expansive  new  rule  that  allows  recovery  for  what  a
canine  companion  meant  to  its  owner.  The  Medlens  ﬁnd  it  odd  that
Texas law would permit sentimental damages for loss of an heirloom
but  not  an  Airedale.  Strickland  would  ﬁnd  it  odd  if  Texas  [common]
law  permitted  damages  for  loss  of  a  Saint  Bernard  but  not  for  a
brother  Bernard.  The  law  is  no  stranger  to  incongruity,  and  we  need
not  jettison  Brown  in  order  to  refuse  to  extend  it  to  categories  of
property beyond heirlooms.

The “true rule” in Texas remains this: Where a dog’s market value
is unascertainable, the correct damages measure is the dog’s “special
or  pecuniary  value”  (that  is,  its  actual  value) — the  economic  value
derived  from  its  “usefulness  and  services,”  not  value  drawn  from
companionship or other non-commercial considerations.

CONCLUSION

To his dog, every man is Napoleon;
hence the constant popularity of dogs.73

It  is  an  inconvenient,  yet  inescapable,  truth:  “Tort  law  .  .  .  cannot
remedy every wrong.” Lines, seemingly arbitrary, are required. No one
disputes that a family dog — “in life the ﬁrmest friend” — is a treasured
companion.  But  it  is  also  personal  property,  and  the  law  draws
sensible,  policy-based  distinctions  between  types  of  property.  The
majority  rule  throughout  most  of  America — including  Texas  since
1891 — leavens  warm-heartedness  with  sober-mindedness,  applying
a  rational  rule  rather  than  an  emotional  one.  For  the  reasons
discussed above, we decline to (1) jettison our 122-year-old precedent
classifying  dogs  as  ordinary  property,  and  (2)  permit  non-economic
damages rooted in relational attachment.

We reverse the court of appeals’ judgment and render judgment in

favor of Strickland.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Personal  Injury  vs.  Property  Damages.   The  court  in  Strickland
distinguishes  between  the  items  of  damage  recoverable  in  personal
injury litigation versus property damage cases. Are you persuaded by
the  court’s  distinction  between  the  two?  What  is  the  justiﬁcation  for
refusing  to  allow  recovery  of  emotional  distress  damages  (or  any
other  general  damage  category)  for  the  loss  of  a  family  pet  despite
the court’s acknowledgment that such harm is likely to occur? Is this
law  consistent  with  the  tort  goal  of  providing  full
rule  of
compensation to injured parties?

2.  Negligent  Infliction  of  Emotional  Distress.   Where  a  defendant
has  negligently  caused  primary  harm  to  another  and  this  harm  has
caused secondary and indirect loss to bystanders, we have seen the

courts  ﬁnd  different  doctrinal  methods  to  limit  recovery,  with  the
majority of courts adopting the Dillon  rule  and  only  permitting  close
family  members  who  actually  witness  the  death  or  serious  harm  to
recover  for  their  emotional  losses  (Chapter  6,  Special  Duty  Rules).  If
the plaintiff’s argument in Strickland were accepted, what would this
do  to  the  sanctity  behind  the  Dillon  limitations?  Strickland  can,
therefore,  be  viewed  both  as  a  case  limiting  the  nature  of  damages
recoverable  when  the  primary  harm  was  to  one’s  personal  property,
as well as a case reafﬁrming that a Dillon-type of recovery is limited
to human family members.

3. Heirloom Exception.  As the Strickland court acknowledges, one
deviation from the general rule limiting damages for loss of personal
property to market value arises in the case of items considered family
heirlooms that may have no recognizable market value but have great
sentimental  value.  This  exception  has  been  found  applicable  when
the  item  damaged  or  destroyed  was  clothing,  books,  pictures,
furniture, or other household goods that had unique personal value to
the owner but to no one else. In such cases, courts have recognized
that  the  market  value  recovery  would  fail  to  offer  compensation  for
the  real  loss  and  so  they  permit  the  jury  to  assess  damages  based
upon  the  emotional  injury  to  the  owner.  On  the  other  hand,  is  it
difﬁcult
for  permitting
exceptional,  emotional-related  recovery  for  damage  to  an  heirloom
but not to a pet?

to  conceptualize  a

legitimate

reason

Upon Further Review

While some students might be tempted to view damage issues
as  an  uninteresting  after-thought
in  tort  cases,  questions
regarding  what  sums  should  be  paid  by  the  tortfeasor  often
dominate tort litigation. Indeed, in many cases the liability issues
is  to
are  very  straightforward  and  the

jury’s  primary

job

determine  actual  damages.  Many  out-of-court  settlement
discussions  and  mediations  focus  upon  the  parties’  disparate
views  of  the  proper  amounts  that  should  be  paid  to  the  victim.
With  regard  to  special  or  economic  losses,  the  determination  is
often  aided  by  relatively  concrete  formulas  approved  by  the
courts  to  help  determine  the  economic  losses  suffered  due  to
the  defendant’s  tortious  misconduct.  Where  the  nature  of  the
loss does not involve something that is typically bought or sold
in the marketplace — such as disﬁgurement or pain or emotional
distress — the law has had a much more difﬁcult time providing
any concrete formulas. Instead, courts often are only able to give
the juries vaguely worded principles to guide their deliberations,
and  appellate  courts  frequently  ﬁnd  their  analysis  limited  to
comparing  one  jury’s  award  of  general  damages  with  other
juries’  awards  in  similar  cases.  It  is  rough  justice.  On  the  other
hand,  courts  have  come  up  with  a  variety  of  concrete  rules  in
cases  involving  general  damages  that  govern  the  types  of
evidence and arguments that lawyers are permitted to present to
the  jury.  In  this  way,  courts  try  to  reign  in  potential  abuses  by
juries in ﬁnding general damages disproportionate to the injuries
suffered  by  plaintiffs.  The  next  section  will  deal  with  other
potential limits on the recovery of actual damages.

III  LIMITATIONS ON ACTUAL DAMAGES

Thus  far  we  have  focused  upon  differentiating  between  the  various
types  of  actual  damages  and  understanding  particular  analytical
these  varieties.  A  complete
issues  arising  under  some  of
understanding  of  tort  law’s  treatment  of  actual  damages  demands
consideration  of  three  additional  issues  that  potentially  impact  the
actual size of compensatory damage recovery in a tort case. First, the
doctrine  of  failure  to  mitigate  damages  imposes  a  post-tort  duty
upon  the  plaintiff  to  exercise  reasonable  care  to  treat  or  lessen  the
ultimate  harm  plaintiff  suffers  and  for  which  plaintiff  can  expect  to
receive  compensation  from  the  tortfeasor.  We  will  begin  with  two
cases  that  illustrate  the  two  different  analytical  approaches  to  this
duty.  We  will  then  take  up  consideration  of  a  hotly  debated  topic —
whether an accident victim’s failure to anticipate a crash and wear a
seat  belt  should  have  any  damage  recovery  reduced  as  either
evidence of a failure to mitigate or comparative fault. Second, a long-
established  doctrine  called  the  collateral  source  rule  declares  that
the  plaintiff’s  receipt  of  beneﬁts  from  someone  other  than  the
tortfeasor (e.g., health insurance) to help pay or reimburse plaintiff for
some of her losses should not work to lessen the tortfeasor’s liability
for  all  of  the  harm  caused.  This  doctrine  has  come  under  attack  in
recent decades, and some courts (or legislatures) have abandoned it.
We will encounter a court considering such a change to the doctrine.
Finally, we will consider the epicenter of the tort reform movement —
statutory  ceilings  on  a  plaintiff’s  recovery  of  actual  damages.  Many
states now have legislatively imposed limits on tort recovery; this has
led  to  constitutional  challenges  regarding  such  limits,  with  mixed
results.

A. Failure to Mitigate Damages

The doctrine of failure to  mitigate damages — sometimes  called  the
“avoidable consequences rule” — places an obligation on the victim to
exercise reasonable care to reduce or “mitigate” her actual damages.
Given  that  so  much  of  tort  law  deals  with  the  goal  of  avoiding  or
deterring losses, placing the duty on the victim makes a lot of sense.
Further, to the extent the plaintiff could have minimized some of her
losses  through  exercising  reasonable  care  after  the  initial  injury,  tort
law  believes  it  inappropriate  to  reward  the  plaintiff  by  awarding  full
damages. In this instance, the tort goal of providing compensation to
worthy  victims  only  demands  compensating  the  plaintiff  for
unavoidable losses. While all courts place this expectation — or duty
— upon  the  plaintiff,  there  are  two  different  conceptual  ways  of
implementing  this  doctrine.  The  traditional  method  of  enforcing  this
obligation is for courts to consider the failure to mitigate damages to
be a damage limiting doctrine by which the jury is merely instructed
in  ﬁnding  the  actual  damages  to  not  include  any  sums  that  the
plaintiff  could  have  avoided  by  exercising  reasonable  care
in
responding to the injuries. Some other courts, however, after moving
away  from  contributory  negligence  to  some  form  of  comparative
fault,  have  chosen  to  consider  a  breach  of  the  duty  to  exercise
reasonable care in minimizing harm to be a type of fault (negligence)
and  will  apportion  this  fault  and  reduce  damages  post-verdict  by
judicial  action.  See  how  the  two  courts  below  follow  each  of  these
two  models,  and  consider  whether  it  makes  a  difference  which
conceptual approach a state chooses.

1. Failure to Mitigate as “Fault”

MILLER v. EICHHORN
426 N.W.2d 641 (Iowa 1988)

       , J.

Plaintiffs  appeal  a  damage  award  in  their  favor  for  injuries
resulting from an automobile accident. Plaintiffs claim . . . there were
errors in the instructions. We afﬁrm.

A car driven by Plaintiff-Appellant Connie M. Miller collided with a
car  driven  by  Defendant-Appellee  Harold  Eichhorn.  The  collision
occurred  when  defendant  backed  his  car  from  his  driveway  into  the
injuries  Connie  allegedly
street.  Plaintiffs  sued  defendants  for
received in the accident. Plaintiff Keith Miller is Connie’s husband. His
claim was for loss of consortium. The case was tried to a jury which
found Connie’s damages to be $3,569.70. The jury found no damages
for Keith. The jury determined Connie’s fault to be ﬁfteen percent and
Harold’s fault to be eighty-ﬁve percent.

Plaintiff  challenges  the  trial  court’s  submission  of  an  instruction
on  mitigation  of  damages.  Plaintiff  objected  to  the  mitigation  of
damage  instruction  claiming  the  failure  to  mitigate  damages  is  not
fault.  We  disagree.  Iowa  Comparative  Fault  Act,  Iowa  Code  section
668.1, provides:

As  used  in  this  chapter  .  .  .  the  term  [“fault”]  also  includes  .  .  .  unreasonable
failure to avoid an injury or to mitigate damages.

Section 668.3 provides:

In determining the percentages of fault, the trier of fact shall consider both the
nature  of  the  conduct  of  each  party  and  the  extent  of  the  causal  relation
between the conduct and the damages claimed.

The  statute  clearly  provides  the  unreasonable  failure  to  mitigate
damages means fault as used in the statute.

damages.

Principles
The Restatement (Second) of
Torts §918 (1965) provides the
following succinct statement
concerning mitigation: “One
injured by the tort of another is
not entitled to recover damages
for any harm that he could have
avoided by the use of
reasonable effort of expenditure
after the commission of the
tort.”

Plaintiff,  Stephen  Klanseck,
brought  this  action,  seeking
damages  for  injuries  suffered
in a motorcycle accident which
occurred  May  27,  1976.  Mr.  Klanseck  had  that  day  purchased  a
Honda  GL  1000  motorcycle  from  defendant  Anderson  Sales  &
Service, Inc., and was heading for home with his new cycle when the
machine  began  to  “ﬁshtail.”  Plaintiff  applied  the  brakes  and  the
motorcycle  slid  sideways  and  went  down,  resulting  in  plaintiff’s
injuries.

Following  the  accident,  plaintiff  received  sutures  in  his  left  arm,
was  x-rayed  and  released.  Twelve  days  later,  a  fracture  of  plaintiff’s
right  wrist  was  diagnosed  and  treated.  Plaintiff,  who  was  employed
as an auto mechanic, claimed that his injuries resulted in chronic pain
and  numbness  in  his  left  arm  and  hand,  which  interfered  with  his
work and eventually resulted in a serious mental disorder.

With  regard  to  plaintiff’s  alleged  failure  to  mitigate  damages,  the

court gave the following instruction:

Now,  a  person  has  a  duty  to  use  ordinary  care  to  minimize  his  own  damages
after he has been injured, and it is for you to decide whether the Plaintiff failed

to use such ordinary care and, if so, whether any damages resulted from such
failure.

You may not compensate the Plaintiff for any portion of his damages which

resulted from his failure to use ordinary care.

Plaintiff contends that this instruction was erroneous because no
evidence  was  presented  that  would  create  an  issue  as  to  plaintiff’s
failure to mitigate his damages. Defendant points to the testimony of
Dr. Gary W. Roat, and claims that it creates an issue on the question
of  mitigation.  Dr.  Roat,  a  neurologist,  testiﬁed  that  the  plaintiff  had
come to him on referral from another physician about a year after the
accident  and  that  he  had  treated  the  plaintiff  a  number  of  times  for
numbness and tingling in his hand as well as back and leg pain. After
trying  several  medications,  Dr.  Roat  recommended  that  plaintiff
undergo  additional  diagnostic  tests,  including  nerve  conduction
studies,  an  electromyelographic  examination,  and  a  myelogram  to
determine  whether  he  had  a  herniated  disk.  According  to  Dr.  Roat’s
testimony,  plaintiff  decided  against  taking  these  tests  unless  his
symptoms worsened.

It  is  well  settled  that  an  injured  party  has  a  duty  to  exercise
reasonable  care  to  minimize  damages,  including  obtaining  proper
medical or surgical treatment. It is also settled that the charge of the
court  must  be  based  upon  the  evidence  and  should  be  conﬁned  to
the issues presented by the evidence.

Although  the  evidence  of  plaintiff’s  alleged  failure  to  mitigate
damages  was  weak,  there  was  evidence  that  plaintiff  had  not
followed  the  recommendation  of  Dr.  Roat.  Even  scant  evidence  may
support an instruction where it raises an issue for the jury’s decision.
The  trial  court’s  instruction  on  failure  to  mitigate  damages  was
proper.

Afﬁrmed.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Does  the  Different  Treatment  Matter?   While  Miller  treats  the
mitigation  issue  as  one  of  comparative  fault,  the  Klanseck  court
treats it as an issue of damages for the jury to consider in assessing
the  actual  damages  award.  Do  you  see  how  the  difference  in
approach  might  lead  to  the  exact  same  result?  Can  you  think  of  an
instance  where  it  might  matter?  Consider  a  situation  where  the
plaintiff  suffers  a  compound  fracture  in  an  auto  accident  due  to  the
defendant’s fault and is treated at an emergency room. Among other
things,  the  plaintiff  is  given  antibiotics  to  take  for  possible  infection.
Plaintiff fails to take the medicine, the wound is horribly infected and
she ultimately loses the limb. In her suit for all of her damages from
the  other  driver,  do  you  see  why  a  jury  might  consider  that  a
signiﬁcant percentage of her injuries were her own fault? If so, and if
the  state  treats  a  failure  to  mitigate  as  a  type  of  “fault”  to  be
apportioned, what percentage might the jury apply? What happens if
the  state  is  a  49  percent  or  50  percent  modiﬁed  comparative  fault
jurisdiction  and  the  jury  translates  the  plaintiff’s  failure  to  mitigate
into  an  apportionment  of  fault,  giving  the  plaintiff  75  percent  of  the
total fault and the defendant driver only 25 percent? How much does
the plaintiff recover? If the state, however, treats the plaintiff’s failure
to mitigate as merely a damages issue, how much might the plaintiff
recover?  This  possibility  of  the  failure  to  mitigate  acting  as  a
complete bar to recovery (despite the defendant being solely to blame
for the accident itself) might be a good reason for a state to reject the
treatment of mitigation as a comparative fault proposition.

2. Problems.  With respect to the mitigation doctrine’s prohibition
on  a  victim  recovering  damages  for  harms  that  could  have  been
avoided  following  an  accident,  do  you  believe  a  failure  to  mitigate
damages argument exists in the following two scenarios?

A.  Plaintiff  suffers  a  compound  fracture  in  an  accident,  and  her
is  available  to  treat  her
doctors  advise  her  that  surgery
condition. Due to religious objections, however, plaintiff declines

medical  treatment.  Her  limb  develops  necrosis  and  has  to  be
amputated.  See  Loomis,  Thou  Shalt  Take  Thy  Victim  as  Thou
Findest  Him:  Religious  Conviction  as  a  Pre-Existing  State  Not
Subject to the Avoidable Consequences Rule, 14 Geo. Mason L.
Rev. 473 (2007).

B.  Plaintiff  sues  for  the  wrongful  death  of  his  spouse  who  was
killed when a roof at a restaurant collapsed on her as she dined.
Plaintiff seeks loss of consortium damages, among other items.
Plaintiff  and  his  wife  were  25  years  old  at  the  time  of  the
accident.  Plaintiff  has  since  begun  dating  another  woman  but
refuses  to  ever  consider  remarrying.  Compare  Benwell  v.  Dean,
57  Cal.  Rptr.  394  (Cal.  App.  1967)  (court  held  that  defendant’s
proffered  evidence  that  plaintiff/widow  of  victim  had  since
remarried  was  inadmissible  to  reduce  damages  in  wrongful
death claim seeking loss of consortium) with Jensen v. Heritage
Mutual  Ins.  Co.,  127  N.W.2d  228  (Wis.  1974)  (“the  possibility  of
marriage or remarriage is always an element which it is proper
for  the  jury  to  consider  in  determining  damages  in  a  wrongful
death action.”).

“LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY . . . ”

5th Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions (Civil Cases) 15.15
Mitigation of Damages:

A person who claims damages resulting from the wrongful act
of  another  has  a  duty  under  the  law  to  use  reasonable
diligence to mitigate — to avoid or minimize those damages.

suffered damages, the plaintiff may not recover for any item of
damage  which  he  could  have  avoided  through  reasonable
effort.

3. Seat-Belt Defense

NABORS WELL SERVICES v. ROMERO
456 S.W.3d 553 (Tex. 2015)

     , J.

For more than forty years evidence of a plaintiff’s failure to use a
seat  belt  has  been  inadmissible  in  car-accident  cases.  That  rule,
which  this  Court  ﬁrst  announced  in  1974,  offered  plaintiffs  safe
harbor  from  the  harshness  of  an  all-or-nothing  scheme  that  barred
recovery for even the slightest contributory negligence. Moreover, the
Court  reasoned  that  although  a  plaintiff’s  failure  to  use  a  seat  belt
may  exacerbate  his  injuries,  it  cannot  cause  a  car  accident,  and
therefore should not affect a plaintiff’s recovery.

In  1985  the  Legislature  jumped  in  to  statutorily  prohibit  evidence
of use or nonuse of seat belts in all civil cases. It repealed that law in
2003, leaving our rule to again stand alone. But much has changed in
the past four decades. The Legislature has overhauled Texas’ system
for  apportioning  fault  in  negligence  cases — a  plaintiff’s  negligence
can  now  be  apportioned  alongside  a  defendant’s  without  entirely
barring the plaintiff’s recovery. And unlike in 1974, seat belts are now
required  by  law  and  have  become  an  unquestioned  part  of  daily  life
for the vast majority of drivers and passengers.

These  changes  have  rendered  our  prohibition  on  seat-belt
evidence an anachronism. The rule may have been appropriate in its
time, but today it is a vestige of a bygone legal system and an oddity
in light of modern societal norms. Today we overrule it and hold that
relevant evidence of use or nonuse of seat belts is admissible for the
purpose of apportioning responsibility in civil lawsuits.

I

This case arises from a collision between a Nabors Well Services, Ltd.
transport  truck  and  a  Chevrolet  Suburban  with  eight  occupants —
three  adults  and  ﬁve  children.  Both  vehicles  were  traveling
southbound on two-lane U.S. Highway 285 in rural West Texas. As the
transport  truck  slowed  to  make  a  left  turn  into  a  Nabors  facility,
Martin  Soto,  the  Suburban’s  driver,  pulled  into  the  opposing  trafﬁc
lane and attempted to pass the transport truck. As Soto passed, the
transport  truck  began  its  left  turn  and  clipped  the  Suburban,  which
careened  off  the  highway  and  rolled  multiple  times.  The  evidence  is
disputed as to whether the transport truck used a turn signal and for
how  long  and  whether  Soto  could  have  passed  the  transport  truck
within the legal passing zone.

Aydee  Romero,  an  adult  passenger,  was  killed  in  the  accident.
Martin,  his  wife  Esperanza  Soto,  and  all  ﬁve  children — Esperanza,
Guadalupe,  and  Marielena  Soto,  and  Edgar  and  Saul  Romero —
suffered injuries. There is conflicting evidence as to which occupants
were belted and which were ejected from the Suburban. A responding
state trooper wrote in his report that all occupants were unrestrained
except  Marielena  and  the  elder  Esperanza.  But  both  of  them,  along
with  the  younger  Esperanza,  testiﬁed  they  did  not  use  seat  belts,
while  Martin  and  Guadalupe  testiﬁed  they  wore  theirs.  Guadalupe
testiﬁed all occupants were ejected except for Martin and Edgar, but
Edgar testiﬁed he was ejected. And an EMS report stated one of the
family members reported at the scene that seven of eight occupants
were ejected.

The Soto and Romero families sued Nabors and its truck driver. At
trial,  Nabors  sought  to  offer  expert  testimony  from  a  biomechanical
engineer,  James  Funk,  Ph.D.,  that  seven  of  the  eight  Suburban
occupants  were  unbelted  (all  except  Martin,  the  driver),  that  ﬁve  of
those seven were ejected from the vehicle, and that the failure to use
seat  belts  caused  the  passengers’  injuries  and  the  one  fatality.
Nabors also hoped to introduce evidence of a citation issued to Soto
for  driving  without  properly  restraining  the  child  passengers  as  well

as testimony from the plaintiffs as to who was unbelted and who was
ejected.

Following our precedent in Carnation Co. v. Wong, 516 S.W.2d 116
(Tex.  1974),  the  trial  court  excluded  all  evidence  of  nonuse  of  seat
belts.  The  jury  found  Nabors  51%  and  Soto  49%  responsible  for  the
accident, and awarded the Soto and Romero families collectively just
over  $2.3  million.  The  court  of  appeals  afﬁrmed  the  trial  court’s
judgment  based  solely  on  the  Carnation  prohibition  on  seat-belt
evidence.  We  granted  review  to  consider  the  current  viability  of
Carnation  in  light  of  the  Legislature’s  repeal  of  its  statutory  ban  on
seat-belt evidence.

A

Texas’s  earliest  cases  on  the  admissibility  of  seat-belt  evidence  ﬁrst
appeared  in  the  late  1960s.  The  context  within  which  these  cases
arose is instructive. First, there was no law requiring seat-belt use; in
fact,  a  federal  mandate  that  seat  belts  be  installed  as  standard
equipment  on  all  new  passenger  vehicles  was  barely  in  its  infancy.
And  second,  Texas  courts  operated  under  an  unforgiving  all-or-
nothing  rule  in  negligence  cases  that  entirely  barred  a  plaintiff  from
recovery if the plaintiff himself was negligent in any way.

This  Court  ﬁrst  encountered  the  issue  in  Kerby  v.  Abilene
Christian  College,  in  which  the  driver  of  a  linen  truck,  Kerby,  was
ejected through the open sliding door of his truck after colliding with
an  ACC  bus.  503  S.W.2d  526,  526  (Tex.  1973).  The  jury  found  Kerby
negligent  and  35%  responsible  for  his  injuries.  The  trial  court
accordingly  reduced  Kerby’s  recovery  by  35%,  but  the  court  of
appeals tossed his award entirely because under the law at the time
his  contributory  negligence  barred  any  recovery  whatsoever.  This
Court reversed both lower courts and restored Kerby’s recovery in full,

reasoning  that  “[c]ontributory  negligence  must  have  the  causal
connection  with  the  accident  that  but  for  the  conduct  the  accident
would  not  have  happened.”  Accordingly,  “negligence  that  merely
increases  or  adds  to  the  extent  of  the  loss  or  injury  occasioned  by
another’s  negligence  is  not  such  contributory  negligence  as  will
defeat  recovery.”  In  so  holding,  the  Court  drew  “a  sharp  distinction
between  negligence  contributing  to  the  accident  and  negligence
contributing to the damages sustained.” The Court further likened the
facts  of  Kerby  to  earlier  cases  in  which  courts  of  appeals  held  the
failure  to  use  a  seat  belt  was  not  “actionable  negligence”  or
that  would  bar  recovery,”  and
“contributory  negligence  such
underscored  the  “conceptual  difﬁculty  of  applying  the  mitigation  of
[damages concept to Plaintiff’s conduct antedating the negligence of
the Defendant.” Id. In so doing, the Court declared seat-belt evidence
incompatible  with  the  only  two
legal  doctrines — contributory
negligence  and  failure  to  mitigate  damages — that  arguably  could
accommodate it.

A year later in Carnation v. Wong, the jury found plaintiffs involved
in  a  car  accident  negligent  for  failing  to  use  seat  belts.  The  jury
attributed 50% of the fault for the husband’s injuries against him and
70%  of  the  fault  for  the  wife’s  injuries  against  her.  The  trial  court
reduced the Wongs’ awards correspondingly, but the court of appeals
overturned  those  reductions.  Finding  no  reversible  error,  this  Court
announced: “We now hold that . . . persons whose negligence did not
contribute  to  an  automobile  accident  should  not  have  the  damages
awarded  to  them  reduced  or  mitigated  because  of  their  failure  to
wear available seat belts.”

B

About  a  decade  after  Carnation,  the  federal  government  began  to
push seat-belt-use initiatives that would give rise to the ﬁrst seat-belt
laws  in  Texas.  The  Texas  Legislature,  along  with  many  others,

responded,  and  in  1985  for  the  ﬁrst  time  made  it  a  criminal  offense
for anyone ﬁfteen years or older to ride in a front seat unbelted, and
further placed on drivers a responsibility to properly restrain children
under ﬁfteen riding in a front seat. The new law further provided that:
“Use  or  nonuse  of  a  safety  belt  is  not  admissible  evidence  in  a  civil
trial.”  And  with  that  prohibition,  Carnation  was  mothballed — not
stricken  from  the  books  but  preempted  by  a  stricter  statutory
prohibition.  The  prohibition  against  seat-belt  evidence  in  civil  trials
remained  intact  throughout  the  law’s  evolution  until  2003,  when  the
Legislature repealed the provision as part of the sweeping tort-reform
legislation.  The  Legislature  did  not  replace  the  prohibition  with  any
language  afﬁrming  the  use  of  seat-belt  evidence — it  simply  struck
the provision altogether.

III

Everyone in this case agrees the statutory repeal revived this Court’s
holding  in  Carnation,  a  common-law  rule  subsumed  for  eighteen
years  by  a  broader  statutory  prohibition  but  never  overruled.  The
question is whether that rule, established more than forty years ago,
should still stand today. While the Legislature now says nothing about
seat-belt  evidence  speciﬁcally,  it  has  said  much  since  Carnation
about the assignment of responsibility in negligence lawsuits.

At the time Kerby and Carnation were tried, Texas followed the all-
or-nothing  system  of  contributory  negligence.  Under  contributory
negligence, if a plaintiff was even one percent at fault, he or she could
not recover. [Beginning in 1973, the legislature adopted a 50 percent
comparative responsibility system which is now embodied in Chapter
33  of  Texas’  Civil  Practice  &  Remedies  Code.]  Gone  is  the  “harsh
system of absolute victory or total defeat.” See Parker, 565 S.W.2d at
518.  Under  [the  current  law  a  plaintiff  who  is  no  more  than  50%  at
fault  merely  has  damages  reduced  according  to  the  plaintiff’s
percentage  of  fault].  And  the  statute  casts  a  wide  net  over  conduct

that may be considered in this determination, including negligent acts
or  omissions  as  well  as  any  conduct  or  activity  that  violates  an
applicable  legal  standard.  The  directive  is  clear — fact-ﬁnders  should
consider  each  person’s  role  in  causing,  “in  any  way,”  harm  for  which
recovery of damages is sought. The question we now face is whether
injury-
the  “sharp  distinction”  between  occurrence-causing  and
causing  negligence  this  Court  drew  in  Kerby  is  still  viable  in  light  of
the  Legislature’s  current  mandate.  In  other  words,  can  a  plaintiff’s
failure  to  use  a  seat  belt,  though  it  did  not  cause  the  car  accident,
limit his recovery if it can be shown that the failure to use a seat belt
caused or contributed to cause his injuries?

The  systematic  elimination  of  outmoded  ameliorative  doctrines
has  led  to  speculation  about  the  continued  viability  of  the  “sharp
distinction”  we  recognized  in  Kerby.  The  Third  Restatement  has
speciﬁcally  cited  Carnation  as  an  example  of  how  “[s]ome  courts
used  to  forgive  a  plaintiff  of  pre-accident  negligence  that  merely
aggravated  the  injury.”  Restatement  (Third)  of  Torts:  Apportionment
of Liab. §3 Reporter’s Note, cmt. b at 39 (2000) (emphasis in original).
Of such decisions, the Restatement observes:

They gave various rationales for this rule, including that the legislature had not
mandated  the  conduct,  that  counting  the  conduct  would  constitute  a  windfall
for  the  defendant,  and  that  a  plaintiff  should  not  have  to  foresee  and  guard
against  the  possibility  of  a  defendant’s  negligence.  None  of  these  rationales
provides  an  adequate  account  for  the  rule,  because  each  of  them  could  be
applied  with  equal  force  to  ordinary  contributory  negligence.  The  most
satisfactory explanation is that courts were hostile to the harsh consequences
of  contributory  negligence  as  an  absolute  bar  to  recovery  and  developed  the
rule  as  an  ameliorative  device.  Comparative  responsibility  eviscerates  that
rationale.

Our precedents holding that a plaintiff’s injury-causing negligence
cannot  reduce  a  plaintiff’s  recovery  cannot  stand
if  today’s
proportionate-responsibility  statute  contradicts  those  precedents.
And  we  hold  it  does.  We  recently  observed  in  Dugger  that  the

proportionate-responsibility statute “indicates the Legislature’s desire
to compare responsibility for injuries rather than bar recovery, even if
the  claimant  was  partly  at  fault  or  violated  some  legal  standard.”
Dugger, 408 S.W.3d at 832.

Furthermore,  [our  current  comparative  responsibility  laws]  focus
the  fact-ﬁnder  on  assigning  responsibility  for  the  “harm  for  which
recovery  of  damages  is  sought” — two  examples  of  which  are
“personal  injury”  and  “death” — and  not  strictly  for  the  underlying
occurrence,  such  as  a  car  accident.  This  distinction  recognizes
plaintiffs  do  not  sue  simply  because  they  were  involved  in  a  car
accident;  they  sue  because  they  suffered  damages  for  which  they
have not been compensated. Accordingly, the question is not simply
who caused the car accident, but who caused the plaintiff’s injuries.

We  believe  most  reasonable  people  considering  who  caused  a
plaintiff’s  injuries  in  a  car  accident  would  not  lean  on  a  logical
distinction  between  occurrence-causing  and  injury-causing  conduct.
Rather,  most  would  say  a  plaintiff  who  breaks  the  law  or  otherwise
acts  negligently  by  not  using  a  seat  belt  is  at  least  partially
responsible  for  the  harm  that  befalls  him.  This  is  true  even  if  he  did
not  cause  the  car  accident,  provided  it  can  be  shown  the  failure  to
buckle up exacerbated his injuries.

Given the statute’s plain language, we conclude that, for purposes
of  the  proportionate-responsibility  statute,  the  Legislature  both
intends  and  requires  fact-ﬁnders  to  consider  relevant  evidence  of  a
plaintiff’s pre-occurrence, injury-causing conduct. This comports with
the modern trend in tort law toward “abolishing doctrines that give all-
or-nothing  effect  to  certain  types  of  plaintiff’s  negligence  based  on
the  timing  of  the  plaintiff’s  and  defendant’s  negligence”  and  instead
considering  “the  timing  of  the  plaintiff’s  and  defendant’s  negligence
[as] factors for assigning percentages of responsibility.” Restatement
(Third) of Torts: Apportionment of Liab. §3, Reporter’s Note, cmt. b at
41.

Today’s holding opens the door to a category of evidence that has
never been part of our negligence cases, but we need not lay down a
treatise  on  how  and  when  such  evidence  should  be  admitted.  Seat-
belt  evidence  has  been  unique  only  in  that  it  has  been  categorically
prohibited in negligence cases. With that prohibition lifted, our rules of
evidence  include  everything  necessary  to  handle  the  admissibility  of
seat-belt  evidence.  As  with  any  evidence,  seat-belt  evidence  is
admissible  only  if  it  is  relevant.  The  defendant  can  establish  the
relevance of seat-belt nonuse only with evidence that nonuse caused
or  contributed  to  cause  the  plaintiff’s  injuries.  And  the  trial  court
should  ﬁrst  consider  this  evidence,  for  the  purpose  of  making  its
relevance determination, outside the presence of the jury.

The  fact-ﬁnder  may  consider  relevant  evidence  of  a  plaintiff’s
failure  to  use  a  seat  belt  as  a  “negligent  act  or  omission”  or  as  a
violation of “an applicable legal standard” in cases where the plaintiff
was  personally  in  violation  of  an  applicable  seat-belt  law.  And  in
cases  in  which  an  unrestrained  plaintiff  was  not  personally  in
violation of a seat-belt law, the fact-ﬁnder may consider whether the
plaintiff  was  negligent  under  the  applicable  standard  of  reasonable
care.  This  scenario  is  likely  to  arise  when  children  are  among  the
passengers of the plaintiff’s vehicle. Most children do not violate seat-
belt laws by failing to restrain themselves; rather, it is the driver upon
whom  the  law  places  the  responsibility  to  properly  restrain  them.
Nonetheless, a minor is still held to the degree of care that would be
exercised  by  an  “ordinarily  prudent  child  of
[the  same]  age,
intelligence,  experience  and  capacity  .  .  .  under  the  same  or  similar
circumstances.” Rudes  v. Gottschalk,  159  Tex.  552,  324  S.W.2d  201,
204
jury  may  further  apportion  third-party
responsibility to the person upon whom the law places the burden to
properly restrain the child.

(Tex.  1959).  The

There  also  should  be  no  confusion  on  the  relationship  of  this
holding  with  the  existing  failure-to-mitigate-damages  doctrine.  A
plaintiff’s  failure  to  mitigate  his  damages  traditionally  occurs  post-

occurrence  and  the  doctrine  does  not  readily  translate  in  the  pre-
occurrence  context.  That  distinction  remains.  A  plaintiff’s  post-
occurrence failure to mitigate his damages operates as a reduction of
his  damages  award  and  is  not  considered  in  the  responsibility
apportionment. It is only the plaintiff’s pre-occurrence, injury-causing
responsibility
conduct
apportionment.

that  should  be  considered

is  rooted

in  statutory

Today’s  holding
interpretation  and  the
unavoidable  conclusion  that  our  proportionate-responsibility  statute
both  allows  and  requires  fact-ﬁnders  to  consider  pre-occurrence,
injury-causing conduct. But the arguments against allowing seat-belt
evidence, including some urged by the families in this case, transcend
statutory interpretation and touch on themes of general fairness and
fundamental principles of tort law. We respond to them because we
believe  our  holding  is  not  merely  correct  statutory  interpretation;  it
also promotes sound public policy.

Attitudes  toward  use  of  seat  belts  have  evolved  drastically  since
the early 1970s. When we decided Kerby and Carnation, seat-belt use
was  not  required  by  law.  Seat-belt  laws  are  now  in  effect  in  every
state,  and  the  vast  majority  of  Texans  buckle  up  on  a  regular  basis.
Yet  until  today  a  contradictory  legal  system  punished  seat-belt
nonuse with criminal citations while allowing plaintiffs in civil lawsuits
to beneﬁt from juries’ ignorance of their misconduct.

Some  argue  that  admitting  seat-belt  evidence  violates  the
principle  that  a  plaintiff  is  not  required  to  anticipate  the  negligent  or
unlawful conduct of another. See Humble Oil & Refining Co. v. Martin,
148 Tex. 175, 222 S.W.2d 995, 1001 (Tex. 1949) (noting the “general
axiom  that  a  person  is  not  bound  to  anticipate  the  negligence  of
others”). But this has never been a steadfast rule of tort law. Rather, it
is a guiding principle the law has balanced with the duty everyone has

to guard against foreseeable risks — a duty that has been recognized
at least since Palsgraf v. Long Island R. Co., 248 N.Y. 339, 162 N.E. 99
(N.Y. 1928). The general danger of driving is obvious to everyone. So
when it comes to foreseeing the general hazard of automobile travel,
“[t]here  is  nothing  to  anticipate;  the  negligence  of  other  motorists  is
omnipresent.”  Law  v.  Superior  Court,  157  Ariz.  147,  755  P.2d  1135,
1141 (Ariz. 1988). Indeed, by enacting seat-belt laws, the Legislature
has required motorists to anticipate the negligence of others.

Finally,  some  insist  that  admitting  seat-belt  evidence  provides  a
windfall  for  defendants  who  will  be  relieved  of  paying  the  full
damages  caused  by  their  negligence.  But  the  reverse  is  equally
arguable — a  plaintiff  whose  injuries  were  exacerbated  by  failure  to
use a seat belt beneﬁts from the jury’s ignorance of his own conduct.
The  result  is  certainly  an  oddity:  the  unbelted  plaintiff  is  likely  to  be
punished  with  a  criminal  citation  carrying  a  monetary  ﬁne  from  the
police ofﬁcer investigating the accident, but in the civil courtroom his
illegal  conduct  will  be  rewarded  by  monetary  compensation.  There
are  no  windfalls  under  the  rule  we  announce  today.  Even  when  trial
courts properly admit seat-belt evidence, defendants will still be held
liable  for  the  damages  they  caused,  but  not  the  injuries  the  plaintiff
caused by not using a seat belt.

We  hold  relevant  evidence  of  use  or  nonuse  of  seat  belts,  and
relevant  evidence  of  a  plaintiff’s  pre-occurrence,
injury-causing
conduct  generally,  is  admissible  for  the  purpose  of  apportioning
responsibility under our proportionate-responsibility statute, provided
that  the  plaintiff’s  conduct  caused  or  was  a  cause  of  his  damages.
Accordingly,  we  reverse  the  court  of  appeals’  judgment  and  remand
this  case  to  the  court  of  appeals  for  further  proceedings  consistent
with this opinion.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Trend  in  Recognizing  Seat-Belt  Defense.   The  court  in  Nabors
discusses  the  fact  that  traditional  tort  concepts — like  the  duty  to
in  favor  of
protect  oneself  from  foreseeable  dangers — argue
permitting
jury  consideration  of  seat-belt  non-use  to  reduce
damages. In doing so, the court admits, however, that seat-belt non-
use  cannot  be  considered  a  classic  form  of  failure  to  mitigate
because  it  happens  before  the  injury  rather  than  constituting  an
unreasonable  response  to  an  injury.  On  the  other  hand,  the  court  no
longer  ﬁnds  a  disconnect  in  applying  comparative  fault  principles  to
seat-belt  non-use.  The  court  reasons  that  the  jury  is  being  asked  to
apportion  between  the  collision-causing  defendant’s  fault  in  causing
the accident and the plaintiff’s fault in enhancing the injuries beyond
what  would  have  been  suffered.  It  helped  in  that  case  that  the
jurisdiction’s  comparative  fault  statute  asks  jurors  to  apportion  fault
for  the  injuries  or  harm  rather  than  for  causing  the  accident  itself.
Further,  the  court  mentions  two  other  changes  in  the  legal  context
that  prompted  the  court  to  re-visit  the  matter:  (1)  the  switch  away
from  contributory  negligence  (that  would  have  completely  barred  a
claim  if  seat-belt  non-use  had  been  considered  negligence)  to  a
comparative  fault  system  that  still  permits  some  reduced  recovery
despite  a  plaintiff’s  negligence;  and  (2)  the  fault  of  the  plaintiff  in
failing  to  wear  a  seat  belt  is  typically  more  stark  now  in  light  of
statutes in every state generally mandating seat-belt usage. Does the
court limit its holding, however, to scenarios where a statute has been
violated by the plaintiff?

2.  Duty  to  Anticipate  Others’  Negligence.   You  may  recall  that  in
Chapter  4,  Negligence:  Breach  of  Duty  of  Reasonable  Care,  we
encountered the defendant’s argument in Davis  v. Consolidated Rail
(illustrating  the  court’s  use  of  the  Learned  Hand  formula  to  breach
analysis) that it should have had no obligation to act in anticipation of
possible  contributory  negligence  by  the  plaintiff  (working  under  a
train  without  the  required  blue  flag).  In  that  case  the  court
acknowledged that general principle was correct but found that there

were  exceptions  where  an  actor  should  anticipate  possible
negligence by others. How convinced are you by the way the court in
the Nabors case dispenses with the plaintiff invoking the same point
— that  victims  of  others’  negligent  driving  should  not  have  to
anticipate such negligence and wear seat belts?

3. Problems.  How might the following scenarios be handled when

a jurisdiction decides to permit a seat-belt defense?

A.  In  Texas,  where  Nabors  was  decided,  the  court  acknowledges
that the state has adopted a 50 percent comparative fault rule.
What if Bill broadsides into Jim’s vehicle by wrongfully running a
red  light?  The  impact  causes  Jim’s  car  to  roll  over  and  he  is
ejected due to not wearing a seat belt and, as a result, suffers a
fractured neck and becomes a quadriplegic. Despite undisputed
evidence that Bill was solely responsible for the collision and the
ensuing  roll-over,  the  jury  apportions  the  total  fault  (taking  into
account  the  seat-belt  non-use)  as  follows:  Jim  75  percent  and
Bill  25  percent.  The  total  damages  are  $10  million.  How  much
will Jim recover from Bill?

B. In the same accident as the preceding hypothetical, a ﬁve-year-
old  child,  Freddy,  is  also  unrestrained  in  the  back  seat  of  Jim’s
vehicle.  Freddy  likewise  is  ejected  during  the  roll-over.  May  the
jury assess fault against Freddy though the applicable seat-belt
statute does not impose a statutory duty on the child to wear a
seat belt (only on the adult driver to have the child restrained)?
May the jury reduce the damages awardable to Freddy from his
failure to wear a seat belt?

C.  Hillary  is  riding  her  motorcycle  when  she  is  side-swiped  by
Donald,  the  driver  of  a  pick-up  truck,  who  fails  to  notice  the
motorcyclist next to him. Hillary suffers a severe brain injury as
she  was  not  wearing  a  helmet.  (Her  state  does  not  mandate  a
helmet  for  riders  who  have  taken  a  training  course.)  She  also
suffers  multiple  fractures  in  her  arms  and  legs,  but  they  heal.

The  brain  injury  will  be  a  lifelong  disability,  however,  and  the
evidence suggests that had Hillary worn a helmet she would not
have  suffered  a  permanent  brain  injury.  Does  the  rule  from
Nabors also allow Donald to reduce or escape responsibility for
paying  for  all  the  damages  from  the  accident  he  caused?
Consider  Jones  v.  Harley-Davidson,  Inc.,  2016  U.S.  Dist.  LEXIS
123225 (E.D. Tex. 2016).

D.  Paul  loves  to  drive  his  vintage  1965  Ford  Mustang  convertible.
Of course, it has no air bag because this technology didn’t exist
when  the  car  was  manufactured.  He’s  hit  by  Ringo  and  Paul  is
killed  despite  wearing  his  seat  belt.  Defendant  wants  to  offer
expert  testimony  that  if  Paul  had  driven  a  car  with  an  air  bag
that  he  would  have  survived.  In  light  of  the  Nabors  holding,
should this evidence and argument be permitted?

B. Collateral Source Rule

The  collateral  source  rule  forbids  the  reduction  of  the  claimant’s
actual damages by virtue of the claimant’s receipt of any beneﬁt from
a  third  party  (e.g.,  a  health  insurance  company)  that  offsets  the
harms for which the claimant seeks recovery from the tortfeasor. To
many ﬁrst confronting this doctrine, the initial reaction is shock. Why
should  the  defendant  be  forced  to  pay  the  plaintiff  for  certain
damages  for  which  he  has  been  reimbursed?  Doesn’t  this  act  as  a
potentially  huge  windfall  for  the  plaintiff  and  unnecessarily  increase
tort  judgments  and  the  defendant’s  litigation  losses?  This  common
law  rule  was  not  fashioned  without  acknowledgment  of  these
arguments,  and  many  courts  still  ﬁnd  the  doctrine  to  be  sound
despite  the  challenges  to  it.  However,  some  courts  and  legislatures
have  abandoned  or  limited  the  doctrine  as  a  type  of  tort  reform.  As
you  read  the  following  case,  consider  who  might  beneﬁt  from  the
windfall under both the existing doctrine and its alternative.

HELFEND v. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RAPID
TRANSIT DISTRICT
465 P.2d 61 (Cal. 1970)

        , J.

Defendants  appeal  from  a  judgment  of  the  Los  Angeles  Superior
Court  entered  on  a  verdict  in  favor  of  plaintiff,  Julius  J.  Helfend,  for
$16,400  in  general  and  special  damages  for  injuries  sustained  in  a
bus-auto  collision  that  occurred  on  July  19,  1965,  in  the  City  of  Los
Angeles.

We  have  concluded  that  the  judgment  for  plaintiff  in  this  tort
action against the defendant governmental entity should be afﬁrmed.
The trial court properly followed the collateral source rule in excluding
evidence  that  a  portion  of  plaintiff’s  medical  bills  had  been  paid
through a medical insurance plan that requires the refund of beneﬁts
from tort recoveries.

Shortly  before  noon  on  July  19,  1965,  plaintiff  drove  his  car  in
central  Los  Angeles  east  on  Third  Street  approaching  Grandview.  At
this  point  Third  Street  had  six  lanes,  four  for  trafﬁc  and  one  parking
lane  on  each  side  of  the  thoroughfare.  While  traveling  in  the  second
lane from the curb, plaintiff observed an automobile driven by Glen A.
Raney,  Jr.,  stopping  in  his  lane  and  preparing  to  back  into  a  parking
space.  Plaintiff  put  out  his  left  arm  to  signal  the  trafﬁc  behind  him
that he intended to stop; he then brought his vehicle to a halt so that
the other driver could park.

At  about  this  time  Kenneth  A.  Mitchell,  a  bus  driver  for  the
Southern California Rapid Transit District, pulled out of a bus stop at
the curb of Third Street and headed in the same direction as plaintiff.
Approaching  plaintiff’s  and  Raney’s  cars  which  were  stopped  in  the
second lane from the curb, Mitchell pulled out into the lane closest to
the  center  of  the  street  in  order  to  pass.  The  right  rear  of  the  bus
sideswiped  plaintiff’s  vehicle,  knocking  off  the  rear-view  mirror  and

crushing plaintiff’s arm, which had been hanging down at the side of
his car in the stopping signal position.

An  ambulance  took  plaintiff  to  Central  Receiving  Hospital  for
emergency ﬁrst aid treatment. Upon release from the hospital plaintiff
proceeded  to  consult  Dr.  Saxon,  an  orthopedic  specialist,  who  sent
plaintiff  immediately  to  the  Sherman  Oaks  Community  Hospital
where  he  received  treatment  for  about  a  week.  Plaintiff  underwent
physical therapy for about six months in order to regain normal use of
his left arm and hand. He acquired some permanent discomfort but
no permanent disability from the injuries sustained in the accident. At
the  time  of  the  injury  plaintiff  was  67  years  of  age  and  had  a  life
expectancy  of  about  11  years.  He  owned  the  Jewel  Homes
Investment  Company  which  possessed  and  maintained  small  rental
properties. Prior to the accident plaintiff had performed much of the
minor  maintenance  on  his  properties  including  some  painting  and
minor plumbing. For the six-month healing period he hired a man to
do all the work he had formerly performed and at the time of the trial
still employed him for such work as he himself could not undertake.

Plaintiff  ﬁled  a  tort  action  against  the  Southern  California  Rapid
Transit  District,  a  public  entity,  and  Mitchell,  an  employee  of  the
transit  district.  At  trial  plaintiff  claimed  slightly  more  than  $2,700  in
special  damages,  including  $921  in  doctor’s  bills,  a  $336.99  hospital
bill,  and  about  $45  for  medicines.5  Defendant  requested  permission
to show that about 80 percent of the plaintiff’s hospital bill had been
paid  by  plaintiff’s  Blue  Cross  insurance  carrier  and  that  some  of  his
other medical expenses may have been paid by other insurance. The
superior  court  thoroughly  considered  the  then  very  recent  case  of
City  of  Salinas  v.  Souza  &  McCue  Constr.  Co.,  424  P.2d  921  (Cal.
1967),  distinguished  the  Souza  case  on  the  ground  that  Souza
involved a contract setting, and concluded that the judgment should
not  be  reduced  to  the  extent  of  the  amount  of  insurance  payments
which  plaintiff  received.  The  court  ruled  that  defendants  should  not

be  permitted  to  show  that  plaintiff  had  received  medical  coverage
from any collateral source.

After  the  jury  verdict  in  favor  of  plaintiff  in  the  sum  of  $16,400,
defendants  appealed,  raising  [as  their  primary  argument  that]  trial
court committed prejudicial error in refusing to allow the introduction
of evidence to the effect that a portion of the plaintiff’s medical bills
had been paid from a collateral source.

We must decide whether the collateral source rule applies to tort
actions  .  .  .  in  which  the  plaintiff  has  received  beneﬁts  from  his
medical insurance coverage.

The Supreme Court of California has long adhered to the doctrine
that  if  an  injured  party  receives  some  compensation  for  his  injuries
from  a  source  wholly  independent  of  the  tortfeasor,  such  payment
should not be deducted from the damages which the plaintiff would
otherwise  collect  from  the  tortfeasor.  See,  e.g.,  Peri  v.  Los  Angeles
Junction  Ry.  Co.,  137  P.2d  441  (Cal.  1943)  [(plaintiff  victim  of  auto
accident  was  entitled  to  undiminished  recovery  for  lost  past  wages
despite  having  insurance  that  reimbursed  plaintiff  for  $2  per  day  for
time off of work because the “[d]amages recoverable for a wrong are
not  diminished  .  .  .  by  [being]  indemniﬁed  for  his  loss  by  insurance
effected by him, and to the procurement of which the defendant did
not  contribute)].  As  recently  as  August  1968  we  unanimously
reafﬁrmed  our  adherence  to  this  doctrine,  which  is  known  as  the
“collateral source rule.”

Although the collateral source rule remains generally accepted in
jurisdictions  have
the  United  States,  nevertheless  many  other
restricted  or  repealed  it.  In  this  country  most  commentators  have
criticized  the  rule  and  called  for  its  early  demise.  In  Souza  we  took
note  of  the  academic  criticism  of  the  rule,  characterized  the  rule  as
“punitive,” and held it inapplicable to the governmental entity involved
in  that  case.  [The  court  then  noted  that  Souza  was  a  breach  of

contract case and not a tort case and that the receipt of beneﬁts did
not truly come from an independent source.]

The collateral source rule as applied here embodies the venerable
concept  that  a  person  who  has
insurance
premiums  to  assure  his  medical  care  should  receive  the  beneﬁts  of
his thrift. The tortfeasor should not garner the beneﬁts of his victim’s
providence.

invested  years  of

The collateral source rule expresses a policy judgment in favor of
insurance  for
encouraging  citizens  to  purchase  and  maintain
personal
injuries  and  for  other  eventualities.  Courts  consider
insurance  a  form  of  investment,  the  beneﬁts  of  which  become
payable without respect to any other possible source of funds. If we
were to permit a tortfeasor to mitigate damages with payments from
plaintiff’s insurance, plaintiff would be in a position inferior to that of
having  bought  no  insurance,  because  his  payment  of  premiums
would have earned no beneﬁt. Defendant should not be able to avoid
payment of full compensation for the injury inflicted merely because
the victim has had the foresight to provide himself with insurance.

Some  commentators  object  that  the  above  approach  to  the
collateral  source  rule  provides  plaintiff  with  a  “double  recovery,”
rewards  him  for  the  injury,  and  defeats  the  principle  that  damages
should  compensate  the  victim  but  not  punish  the  tortfeasor.  We
agree  with  Professor  Fleming’s  observation,  however,  that  “double
recovery is justiﬁed only in the face of some exceptional, supervening
reason,  as  in  the  case  of  accident  or  life  insurance,  where  it  is  felt
unjust  that  the  tortfeasor  should  take  advantage  of  the  thrift  and
prescience  of  the  victim  in  having  paid  the  premium.”  Fleming,
Introduction to the Law of Torts (1967) p. 131. As we point out infra,
recovery in a wrongful death action is not defeated by the payment of
the beneﬁt on a life insurance policy.

Furthermore,  insurance  policies  increasingly  provide  for  either
subrogation  or  refund  of  beneﬁts  upon  a  tort  recovery,  and  such

refund  is  indeed  called  for  in  the  present  case.  See  Fleming,  The
Collateral Source Rule and Loss Allocation in Tort Law, supra, 54 Cal.
L.  Rev.  1478,  1479.  Hence,  the  plaintiff  receives  no  double  recovery;
the collateral source rule simply . . . permits a proper transfer of risk
from the plaintiff’s insurer to the tortfeasor by way of the victim’s tort
recovery. The double shift from the tortfeasor to the victim and then
from the victim to his insurance carrier can normally occur with little
cost  in  that  the  insurance  carrier  is  often  intimately  involved  in  the
initial  litigation  and  quite  automatically  receives  its  part  of  the  tort
settlement or verdict.

Even  in  cases  in  which  the  contract  or  the  law  precludes
subrogation  or  refund  of  beneﬁts,17  or  in  situations  in  which  the
collateral  source  waives  such  subrogation  or  refund,  the  rule
performs  entirely  necessary  functions
in  the  computation  of
damages. For example, the cost of medical care often provides both
attorneys  and  juries  in  tort  cases  with  an  important  measure  for
assessing the plaintiff’s general damages. To permit the defendant to
tell  the  jury  that  the  plaintiff  has  been  recompensed  by  a  collateral
source  for  his  medical  costs  might  irretrievably  upset  the  complex,
delicate,  and  somewhat  indeﬁnable  calculations  which  result  in  the
normal jury verdict.

We also note that generally the jury is not informed that plaintiff’s
attorney  will  receive  a  large  portion  of  the  plaintiff’s  recovery  in
contingent  fees  or  that  personal  injury  damages  .  .  .  are  normally
deductible  by  the  defendant.  Hence,  the  plaintiff  rarely  actually
receives  full  compensation  for  his  injuries  as  computed  by  the  jury.
The  collateral  source  rule  partially  serves  to  compensate  for  the
attorney’s  share  and  does  not  actually  render  “double  recovery”  for
the plaintiff. Indeed, many jurisdictions that have abolished or limited
the  collateral  source  rule  have  also  established  a  means  for
assessing  the  plaintiff’s  costs  for  counsel  directly  against  the
defendant rather than imposing the contingent fee system.19 In sum,
the  plaintiff’s  recovery  for  his  medical  expenses  from  both  the

tortfeasor  and  his  medical  insurance  program  will  not  usually  give
him  “double  recovery,”  but  partially  provides  a  somewhat  closer
approximation to full compensation for his injuries.

If  we  consider  the  collateral  source  rule  as  applied  here  in  the
context  of  the  entire  American  approach  to  the  law  of  torts  and
damages,  we  ﬁnd  that  the  rule  presently  performs  a  number  of
legitimate  and  even  indispensable  functions.  Without  a  thorough
revolution  in  the  American  approach  to  torts  and  the  consequent
damages, the rule at least with respect to medical insurance beneﬁts
has  become  so  integrated  within  our  present  system  that  its
precipitous judicial nulliﬁcation would work hardship. In this case the
collateral source rule lies between two systems for the compensation
of  accident  victims:  the  traditional  tort  recovery  based  on  fault  and
the  increasingly  prevalent  coverage  based  on  non-fault  insurance.
Neither  system  possesses  such  universality  of  coverage  or
completeness of compensation that we can easily dispense with the
collateral  source  rule’s  approach  to  meshing  the  two  systems.  The
reforms  which  many  academicians  propose  cannot  easily  be
achieved through piecemeal common law development; the proposed
changes,
if  desirable,  would  be  more  effectively  accomplished
through  legislative  reform.  In  any  case,  we  cannot  believe  that  the
judicial  repeal  of  the  collateral  source  rule,  as  applied  in  the  present
case, would be the place to begin the needed changes.

Although in the special circumstances of Souza we characterized
the collateral source rule as “punitive” in nature, we have pointed out
the  several  legitimate  and  fully  justiﬁed  compensatory  functions  of
the  rule.  In  fact,  if  the  collateral  source  rule  were  actually  punitive,  it
could  apply  only  in  cases  of  oppression,  fraud,  or  malice  and  would
be  inapplicable  to  most  tort,  and  almost  all  negligence,  cases
regardless  of  whether  a  governmental  entity  were  involved.  We
therefore  reafﬁrm  our  adherence  to  the  collateral  source  rule  in  tort
cases in which the plaintiff has been compensated by an independent
collateral  source — such  as  insurance,  pension,  continued  wages,  or

disability payments — for which he had actually or constructively paid
or  in  cases  in  which  the  collateral  source  would  be  recompensed
from  the  tort  recovery  through  subrogation,  refund  of  beneﬁts,  or
some other arrangement. Hence, we conclude that in a case in which
a  tort  victim  has  received  partial  compensation  from  medical
insurance  coverage  entirely  independent  of  the  tortfeasor  the  trial
court  properly  followed  the  collateral  source  rule  and  foreclosed
defendant  from  mitigating  damages  by  means  of  the  collateral
payments.

The judgment is afﬁrmed.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Subrogation.   The  court  discusses  subrogation,  which  was
applicable  to  the  plaintiff’s  recovery  in  that  case,  as  one  justiﬁcation
for maintaining the collateral source rule. Although the plaintiff might
theoretically receive a windfall if it recovers as medical expenses from
a tortfeasor sums for which a health insurer has already reimbursed
it,  when  the  insurer  has  a  right  to  subrogation  that  windfall  is
eliminated.  Subrogation  typically  exists  either  due  to  the  contractual
terms  of  the  insurance  policy  (as  a  matter  of  contract  law)  or  by
operation  of  a  statute  that  expressly  provides  for  subrogation  rights
in  certain  instances.  For  example,  worker’s  compensation  insurers
are  typically  granted  a  right  to  subrogation  when  the  hurt  employee
has a claim against a tortfeasor. These insurers frequently intervene
in  litigation  brought  by  worker’s  compensation  beneﬁciaries  in  order
to  protect  their  subrogation  interest.  In  those  cases,  the  insurer
typically  gets  to  keep  the  ﬁrst  fruits  on  the  applicable  recovered
damages  until  the  amount  of  their  subrogation  lien  has  been
satisﬁed.  For  this  reason,  such  insurers  are  often  present  during
pretrial  settlement  conferences  and  mediation  because  no  deal

resolving the litigation can be obtained without their participation and
acquiescence.

2. Windfall Arguments.  No matter what system is used, there is a
windfall  available  to  someone.  Under  the  collateral  source  rule  the
windfall  either  goes  to  the  plaintiff,  or,  if  there  is  subrogation
permitted  by  a  health  insurance  company,  to  the  insurer  (which  has
received premiums to pay for losses but ends up not paying out on a
loss).  When  the  collateral  source  rule  is  legislatively  eliminated,  the
tortfeasor  (and  its  liability  insurance  company)  receives  a  windfall
because  its  tort  liability  is  reduced  as  a  result  of  the  plaintiff’s
foresight to arrange for insurance coverage.

3. Legislative Repeal.  Some legislative bodies have disagreed with
the  Helfend  arguments  for  retaining  the  common  law  collateral
source  rule.  In  fact,  the  California  legislature  ultimately  enacted  a
statute  that  abrogates  the  collateral  source  rule
in  medical
malpractice  cases,  allowing  doctors  to  offer  evidence  to  the  jury  of
the plaintiff’s receipt of beneﬁts (such as health insurance) in order to
reduce  the  damages  awarded.  See  Calif.  Civ.  Code  §3333.1;  Fein  v.
Permanente  Medical  Group,  695  P.2d  665  (Cal.  1985)  (upholding  the
constitutionality of this statutory reversal of the collateral source rule,
saying  it  was  within  the  legislature’s  discretion  to  retain  or  dispense
with the common law rule). Nearly half of the states have repealed, or
limited, the collateral source rule in some manner. Interestingly, even
in  some  cases  where  the  legislature  has  overturned  the  collateral
source rule, some health insurers have still tried to assert subrogation
rights  against  the  plaintiff’s  receipt  of  a  tort  judgment.  Of  course,
permitting  such  subrogation  would  go  further  than  eliminating  a
windfall  to  the  plaintiff  because,  if  allowed,  the  plaintiff  would  not
even  theoretically  be  fully  compensated.  The  courts  have  rebuffed
such  attempts.  See  Perreira  v.  Rediger,  778  A.2d  429  (N.J.  2001)
(New Jersey, which legislatively repealed the collateral source rule by
permitting  defendant  to  offer  evidence  of  collateral  beneﬁts  in  order

to reduce its tort liability, would not recognize any subrogation rights
otherwise claimed by health insurer).

C. Statutory Limits

The  poster  child  for  tort  reform  involves  legislatively  imposed  limits
on  certain  plaintiffs’  entitlement  to  some  or  all  categories  of
compensatory  damages.  The  chief  rationale  is  that  “runaway”  jury
verdicts  are  windfalls  for  plaintiffs  and  trial  lawyers  but  bad  for
business  and  the  economy  in  general  (by  driving  up  costs  for
everyone),  or  at  least  bad  for  certain  segments — chiefly  medical
doctors  and  hospitals.  With  respect  to  medical  malpractice  caps  on
damages, reformers have successfully urged many legislators to limit
recovery because our “unrestrained” tort system has driven up health
care  costs  for  everyone,  caused  doctors’  malpractice  insurance
premiums  to  go  through  the  roof,  and  resulted  in  many  doctors
abandoning  practice  altogether — or  at  least  in  certain  “litigation
magnet” states. In essence, the argument goes that the combination
of  our  tort  common  law  and  the  constitutional  jury  system  has
conspired to cause a “tort crisis” that demands innovative solutions.

1. Examples of Statutory Limits

There are a variety of statutes that limit recovery of actual damages.
The  majority  of  these  statutes  only  apply  to  a  narrow  category  of
claims — chiefly  medical  malpractice  suits.  The  California  and  Texas
statutes set forth below are so limited. The Maryland statute is much
broader  in  this  sense  as  it  applies  to  all  personal  injury  tort  claims.
Many of the statutes only limit noneconomic general damages while
imposing  no  limits  on  special  economic  losses.  The  Texas  medical
malpractice  wrongful  death  statute  (§74.303),  however,  limits  both

general  and  special  damages — as  well  as  exemplary  damages — to
$500,000.

California Civ. Code §333.2 (1975)

amount not to exceed $500,000 for each claimant, regardless
of  the  number  of  defendant  physicians  or  health  care
providers  against  whom  the  claim  is  asserted  or  the  number
of separate causes of action on which the claim is based.

received  before
in  the  future  for
judgment  or  required
treatment of the injury.

2. Constitutionality of Limits on Actual Damages

While  all  of  the  damage-limiting  statutes  are  subject  to  potential
interpretational  disputes  (as  are  most  statutes),  the  most  serious
legal questions arising out of these statutes focus upon their legality.

Do legislative efforts intended to limit a tort claimant’s recovery of all
jury-awarded  damages  violate  the  claimant’s  constitutional  rights?
There are several primary constitutional attacks: (1) substantive due
process arguments contend that the legislature has acted irrationally
by  taking  away  a  portion  of  the  plaintiff’s  cause  of  action;  (2)  equal
protection arguments assert that, when the legislature imposes limits
on  only  some  personal  injury  claimants  (e.g.,  medical  malpractice
victims),  the  statute  violates  the  claimant’s  right  to  be  treated  the
same  as  all  other  personal
injury  victims;  and  (3)  Seventh
Amendment right to jury trial arguments claim that, by superimposing
legislative  determinations  over  the  actual  damages  to  which  a
claimant  might  have  recovery,  the  statutes  disregard  the  jury’s
function and render a portion of the jury’s job moot. The courts vary
widely  regarding  these  challenges.  Sometimes  the  disagreement
concerns  whether  the  court  believes  there  is  a  true  “tort  crisis”  to
justify such legislation. Sometimes the differing legal conclusions of
the courts can be attributed to varying levels of judicial scrutiny over
legislation. And sometimes the difference in results can be explained
by different conceptual views of the jury’s role in our judicial process.
Below is a good example of two courts’ reactions to such arguments.

SAMSEL v. WHEELER TRANSPORT SERVICES, INC.
789 P.2d 541 (Kan. 1990)

       , J.

Chief Judge Earl E. O’Connor of the United States District Court for
the  District  of  Kansas  has  certiﬁed  the  following  question  for
resolution:  Does  K.S.A.  1987  Supp.  60-19a01  violate  the  Kansas
Constitution?

The majority of our legislature voted to limit the traditional role of
the jury to determine the monetary value for loss of the quality of life
in  Kansas  by  setting  a  limit  on  the  recovery  of  noneconomic

damages. The majority of this court recognizes that the legislature’s
decision  to  modify  the  common
limit  on
noneconomic damages, is a legislative decision that does not violate
our state constitution.

law,  by  setting  a

A  great  change  in  tort  doctrine  has  taken  place  over  the  past
century.  The  primary  function  of  damages  is  no  longer  seen  as
deterrence or retribution for harm caused; damages are now seen as
compensation.  In  large  part,  this  shift  has  been  caused  by  the
modern  availability  of  affordable  liability  insurance,  the  purchase  of
which has occasionally been required by legislation.

It  is  the  availability  of  liability  insurance  which  critics  warn  is
threatened  by  the  present  tort  system.  If  insurance  goes,  so  will
compensation  to  many  plaintiffs,  no  matter  how  favorable  the  laws
are  in  their  favor.  In  reality,  “[j]ustice  is  not  achieved  when  deserved
compensation  is  granted  by  a  court;  it  is  achieved  when  that
compensation is paid to the plaintiff.” Citizens Committee Report 52.
The  insurance  crisis  of  the  1970s,  referred  to  in  the  Citizens
Committee  Report,  was  partially  caused  by  the  industry’s  increased
market at lower premiums due to its remarkably high rate of return on
investments.  The  crisis  was  especially  hard-felt  in  the  malpractice
insurance area. In response to this crisis and to ensure the continued
availability  of  medical  liability  insurance,  every  state  enacted  some
type of tort reform; the statutes number over 300.

In the case before this court, the question certiﬁed by the United
States  District  Court  for  the  District  of  Kansas  arises  out  of  a
personal  injury  action  wherein  the  plaintiff,  Douglas  Samsel,  claims
that  one  of  the  defendants,  Don  Hilgenfeld,  negligently  caused  an
automobile  accident  by  driving  left  of  the  center  line.  Samsel  was
rendered a quadriplegic as a result of this accident. Other defendants
are Wheeler Transport Services, Inc., Hilgenfeld’s employer, and Great
West Casualty Co., Wheeler’s insurance company. Douglas Samsel is
a  resident  of  Kansas;  Hilgenfeld  of  Nebraska.  Wheeler  has  its

principal place of business in Nebraska and Great West is organized
under  Nebraska  law.  The  case  was  ﬁled  in  federal  court  based  on
diversity of citizenship pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1332 (1982).

When  the  accident  occurred  on  May  16,  1988,  K.S.A.  1987  Supp.
60-19a01 was in effect. This statute caps damages in personal injury
actions  for  pain  and  suffering  [or  other  noneconomic  losses]  at
$250,000.

The  certiﬁed  question  limits  our  review  to  an  analysis  of  the
Kansas  Constitution.  The  federal  court  will  decide  whether  the
contested  statute  offends  the  federal  constitution.  Speciﬁcally,
plaintiff argues that the statutory cap violates §§5 and 18 of the Bill
of  Rights  in  the  Kansas  Constitution.  Section  5  states:  “The  right  of
trial  by  jury  shall  be  inviolate.”  Section  18  is  almost  as  succinct:  “All
persons,  for  injuries  suffered  in  person,  reputation  or  property,  shall
have remedy by due course of law, and justice administered without
delay.”

We have previously said that §18 protects the right to “reparation
for  injury,  ordered  by  a  tribunal  having  jurisdiction,  in  due  course  of
procedure and after a fair hearing.” Ernest v. Faler, 697 P.2d 870 (Kan.
1985).

The certiﬁed question requires us to review our state constitution,
the role of the common law, legislative and judicial power vis-a-vis the
common  law,  and  the  separation  of  powers  doctrine.  It  is  also
essential  that  we  analyze  the  doctrine  of  stare  decisis  and  the
consequences of our prior decisions.

Our  constitution  is  a  written  charter  enacted  by  the  direct  action
of the citizens of Kansas. It is a compilation of the fundamental laws
of  the  state  and  embodies  the  principles  upon  which  the  state
government was founded. The object of our constitution is to provide
a government of law and not of men, while insuring the protection of
life, liberty, and property.

The  state  constitution  establishes  the  form  of  our  government.
Like the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of Kansas
the  separation  of
contains  no  express  provision
governmental  powers,  but  all  decisions  of  this  court  have  taken  for
granted the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers between
the  three  branches  of  the  state  government — legislative,  executive,
and judicial.

requiring

Our  constitution  does  not  make  this  court  the  critic  of  the
legislature;  rather,  this  court  is  the  guardian  of  the  constitution  and
every
legislative  act  comes  before  us  with  a  presumption  of
constitutionality.  A  statute  will  not  be  declared  unconstitutional
unless its infringement on the superior law of the constitution is clear,
beyond  substantial  doubt.  In  determining  whether  a  statute  is
constitutional, courts must guard against substituting their views on
economic or social policy for those of the legislature. Courts are only
concerned  with  the  legislative  power  to  enact  statutes,  not  with  the
wisdom behind those enactments.

welfare of the people of the state.

Section 5 of the Kansas Bill of Rights protects the right to jury trial
as  it  existed  under  common  law  at  the  time  the  constitution  was

adopted.  Under  the  common  law,  jury  verdicts  have  always  been
subject  to  the  concurrence  of  the  trial  judge  and  the  trial  judge’s
power  to  grant  a  new  trial.  The  right  of  the  trial  court  and  the
appellate court to grant a remittitur or a new trial does not violate the
individual’s  right  to  a  jury  trial  guaranteed  by  the  United  States
Constitution. See Capital Traction Co. v. Hof, 174 U.S. 1 (1899).

A  court  may  refuse  to  accept  a  jury’s  ﬁnding  of  damages  in  a
personal  injury  case  if,  in  the  light  of  the  evidence,  the  amount  is
either so high or so low as to shock the conscience of the court. The
court, in such a case, may offer the affected party the opportunity to
accept  a  damage  verdict  more  in  line  with  the  evidence.  If  the  party
consents to the altered verdict, the party loses the right to appeal as
to the amount of damages. If the party refuses to accept the altered
verdict, the court may order a new trial, in which the party again faces
the court’s discretion to refuse to order damages in the amount found
by the jury.

KNOWLES v. UNITED STATES
544 N.W.2d 183 (S.D. 1996)

      , J.

Parents  brought  suit  for  severe  injuries  suffered  by  minor  son
while  under  care  of  Air  Force  hospital.  The  United  States  admitted
liability  and  invoked  the  $1  million  cap  on  medical  malpractice
damages.  The  federal  district  court  held  the  cap  was  constitutional
under  the  South  Dakota  and  United  States  Constitutions.  On  appeal
to  the  Eighth  Circuit  Court  of  Appeals,  four  certiﬁed  questions  were
presented and accepted by the South Dakota Supreme Court. For the
reasons set forth herein, we hold that the damages cap of SDCL 21-3-
11 is unconstitutional.

In Practice

Kris  Knowles  was  twelve
days  old  when  he  was
admitted  for  treatment  of  a
fever at the Ellsworth Air Force
Base  Hospital,  near  Rapid  City,

Some scholars have argued that
legislative caps on
noneconomic damages have a
disproportionate adverse impact
upon female claimants who are
allegedly more likely than men
to suffer emotional injuries. See
Lisa Ruder, Comment, Caps on
Noneconomic Damages and
the Female Plaintiff, 44 Case W.
Res. L. Rev. 197 (1993), and
Koenig & Rustad, His and Her
Tort Reform: Gender Injustice in
Disguise, 70 Wash. L. Rev. 1
(1995).

South  Dakota.  Medical  Service
Specialists,
the  Air  Force’s
equivalent  to  nurses’  aides,
recorded  Kris’  temperature.  On
the  night  before  his  discharge,
the  specialists  failed  to  report
to  nurses  or  physicians  that
Kris’  temperature  had  been
dropping throughout that night.
Kris  developed  hypoglycemia
and  suffered  respiratory  arrest
resulting  in  severe,  permanent
brain damage.

William  and  Jane  Knowles
brought  suit  on
their  own
behalf  and  for  Kris  for  medical
malpractice,  emotional  distress,  and  loss  of  consortium.  The  United
States admitted liability for medical malpractice and ﬁled a motion for
entry of judgment of $1 million based on SDCL 21-3-111, which limits
damages  in  medical  malpractice  actions  to  $1  million.  The  United
States  District  Court  of  South  Dakota,  Western  Division,  ruled  that
SDCL 21-3-11 was constitutional and entered judgment for $1 million.
Knowles  appealed.  The  Eighth  Circuit  Court  of  Appeals  certiﬁed  [to
this court the issue of the statute’s constitutionality under the South
Dakota Constitution].

Initially, we note that many courts have invalidated limitations on
damages  based  on  their  respective  state  constitutions.  Moore  v.
Mobile Infirmary Ass’n, 592 So. 2d 156, 158 (Ala. 1991) (invalidating a
damages cap on personal injury awards); Wright v. Central Du  Page
Hosp. Ass’n, 347 N.E.2d 736 (Ill. 1976); Brannigan v. Usitalo, 587 A.2d
1232  (N.H.  1991);  Arneson  v.  Olson,  270  N.W.2d  125  (N.D.  1978);
Morris v. Savoy, 576 N.E.2d 765 (Ohio 1991); Lucas v. United States,
757 S.W.2d 687 (Tex. 1988); Condemarin v. Univ. Hosp., 775 P.2d 348

(Utah  1989);  Sofie  v.  Fibreboard  Corp.,  771  P.2d  711  (Wash.  1989)
(invalidating a damages cap on all personal injury actions).

Other

jurisdictions  have  upheld  a  damages  cap:  Fein  v.
Permanente Medical Group, 695 P.2d 665 (Calif. 1985); Johnson v. St.
Vincent  Hosp.,  Inc.,  404  N.E.2d  585  (Ind.  1980);  Samsel  v.  Wheeler
Transp.  Serv.,  Inc.,  789  P.2d  541  (Kan.  1990);  Etheridge  v.  Medical
Center Hosp., 376 S.E.2d 525 (Va. 1989).

However,  the  questions  presented  herein  generally  turn  on  the
particular  constitutional  provisions  of  the  state  and  the  case  law
precedent  interpreting  those  provisions.  Because  the  provisions  of
jury
the  South  Dakota  Constitution  guaranteeing  the  right  to
trial . . . and due process are dispositive, we do not reach [any of] the
other constitutional questions.

South  Dakota  Constitution  article  VI,  §6  guarantees  the  right  of

trial by jury:

The  right  of  trial  by  jury  shall  remain  inviolate  and  shall  extend  to  all  cases  at
law without regard to the amount in controversy[.]

“Inviolate”  has  been  deﬁned  as  “free  from  change  or  blemish:  pure,
unbroken . . . free from assault or trespass: untouched, intact[.]” Sofie,
771 P.2d at 721-22. In discussing the role of the jury, the United States
Supreme Court has stated:

Maintenance  of  the  jury  as  a  fact-ﬁnding  body  is  of  such  importance  and
occupies  so  ﬁrm  a  place  in  our  history  and  jurisprudence  that  any  seeming
curtailment of the right to a jury trial should be scrutinized with the utmost care.

Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U.S. 474 (1935) (assessment of damages is a
“matter so peculiarly within the province of the jury[.]”).

“A jury is the tribunal provided by law to determine the facts and to
ﬁx the amount of damages.” Schaffer v. Edward D. Jones & Co.,  521
N.W.2d  921,  927  n.9  (S.D.  1994).  “The  amount  of  damages  to  be
awarded  is  a  factual  issue  to  be  determined  by  the  trier  of  fact[.]”
Sander  v.  The  Geib,  Elston,  Frost  Pro.  Ass’n,  506  N.W.2d  107,  119

(S.D.  1993)  (citation  omitted).  With  any  jury  award  for  personal
injuries,  we  “have  allowed  [the  jury]  ‘wide  latitude’”  in  making  its
award. Id. (citation omitted).

We are unwilling to allow the trial court authority to limit a damages award as a
matter  of  law.  .  .  .  A  jury  determination  of  the  amount  of  damages  is  the
essence of the right to trial by jury — to go beyond the procedural mechanisms
now  in  place  [remittitur]  for  reduction  of  a  verdict  and  to  bind  the  jury’s
discretion is to deny this constitutional right.

Moore, 592 So. 2d at 161 (emphasis in original). The damages cap is
unconstitutional  because  it  limits  the  jury  verdict  “automatically  and
absolutely”  which  makes  the  jury’s  function  “less  than  an  advisory
status.” Id. at 164 (emphasis in original).

SDCL  21-3-11  arbitrarily  and  without  a  hearing

imposes  a
limitation  of  one  million  dollars  on  all  damages  in  all  medical
malpractice actions. It does so without provisions for determining the
extent of the injuries or resulting illness, or whether these injuries or
illness resulted in death. It purports to cover even those cases where
the  medical  costs  occasioned  by  the  malpractice  alone  exceed  one
million dollars. In other words, the damages recovered in these cases
could  actually  be  payable  to  the  wrongdoers  for  medical  expenses,
not  to  the  victims.  It  does  so  in  all  cases,  even  when  a  judicial
determination  of  damages  above  one  million  dollars  results  from  an
adversarial hearing after notice.

For  these  reasons,  we  hold  that  the  damages  cap  violates  the

right to a jury trial under South Dakota Constitution article VI, §6.

Surprisingly, a bigger problem
perceived by the judges was
juries awarding too little in

reluctant to award any punitive

that media coverage of tort

It  cannot  seriously  be  contended  that  the  extension  of  special  beneﬁts  to  the
medical  profession  and  the  imposition  of  an  additional  hurdle  in  the  path  of
medical malpractice victims relate to the protection of the public health.

756 P.2d at 783.

In Arneson, 270 N.W.2d at 136, the North Dakota Supreme Court
upheld the trial court’s ﬁnding that no medical malpractice insurance
availability or cost crisis existed:

The Legislature was advised that malpractice insurance rates were determined
on a national basis, and did not take into account the state-wide experience of
smaller  States  such  as  North  Dakota.  Thus,  premiums  were  unjustiﬁably  high
for States such as North Dakota with fewer claims and smaller settlements and
judgments.

Id. Similar evidence on how rates are calculated was presented to the
1975 South Dakota Committee.

Before  SDCL  21-3-11  was  amended  in  1986,  the  statute  only
capped  general  or  noneconomic  damages.  Now,  the  $1  million  cap
applies to all damages, noneconomic and economic. 1986 S.D. Sess.
Laws  ch.  172.  This  record  provides  no  reasons  for  amending  the
statute or making the cap apply to all damages. Therefore, even if the
legislative  record  and  ﬁndings  were  sufﬁcient  to  support  the
existence of an insurance crisis and the reasonableness of the cap on
noneconomic  damages  at  $500,000,  they  would  not  support  the
reasonableness  of  placing  a  cap  on  all  damages,  economic  and
noneconomic,  at  $1  million.  No  justiﬁable  reason  appears  to  cap
economic damages.

SDCL  21-3-11  does  not  treat  each  medical  malpractice  claimant
into  two  classes:  those  whose
uniformly.  It  divides  claimants
damages are less than $1 million and those whose damages exceed
$1 million. Those who have awards below the statutory cap shall be
fully  compensated  for  their  injury  while  those  exceeding  the  cap  are
not.

Therefore,  SDCL  21-3-11  does  not  bear  a  “real  and  substantial
relation  to  the  objects  sought  to  be  obtained”  and  we  hold  that  the
damages cap violates due process guaranteed by [the] South Dakota
Constitution.

We  are  not  saying  that  the  state  cannot  subsidize  health
practitioners  or  even  the  health  insurance  industry.  We  are  simply
saying that it cannot be done in this manner to the sole detriment of
the  injured.  Obviously,  fewer  constitutional  objections  would  exist  if
the state would pay the difference to the injured; or, before the fact, to
the insurer or health care provider; or, in all personal injury actions, all
damages,  economic  and  noneconomic,  were  limited  in  reasonable
proportions  for  all  those  wrongfully  injured  for  the  beneﬁt  of  all
wrongdoers.  We  decline  to  comment  on  the  wisdom,  as  opposed  to
the constitutionality of such approach.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Rationales  for  Differing  Decisions.   The  Kansas  and  South
Dakota  Supreme  Courts  reached  remarkably  different  decisions
regarding essentially the same questions. With regard to the right to a
jury  trial,  why  do  the  two  courts  disagree?  With  regard  to  the  due
process arguments, is the difference between the two decisions more
because  of  disparate  views  over  the  existence  of  a  tort  crisis  or
because  of  the  degree  to  which  they  were  each  willing  to  scrutinize
the wisdom behind the legislation?

2. Debate over Tort Crisis.  Beginning in the 1970s, renewed in the
1980s,  and  repeated  in  the  ﬁrst  decade  of  the  twenty-ﬁrst  century
have been cries by business and insurance interests of a “tort crisis”
demanding reforms to limit juries’ abilities to award large damages in
tort cases. Whether such a crisis has ever really existed is the subject
of  much  scholarly  debate.  See  e.g.,  Michael  A.  Allen,  A  Survey  and
Some  Commentary  on  Federal  “Tort  Reform,”  39  Akron  L.  Rev.  909
(2006);  Michael  J.  Saks,  Do  We  Really  Know  Anything  About  the
Behavior of the Tort Litigation System — And Why Not?, 140 U. Pa. L.
Rev.  1147  (1992);  Johnson,  The  Attack  on  Trial  Lawyers  and  Tort
Law,  A  Commonwealth  Institute  Report  (2003).  Perhaps  the  poster

child  for  a  need  for  tort  reform  was  the  McDonald’s  hot  coffee  case
where  media  reports  on  the  multi-million-dollar  jury  award  were
widely disseminated and repeated. The jury verdict became a punch
line for many late-night comedians and the inspiration for an episode
of Seinfeld. A recent HBO documentary entitled Hot Coffee attempted
to debunk many of the perceived myths commonly held by the public
regarding this case. Ironically, one possible unintended consequence
of the media-driven tort reform movement might be to cause juries to
increase  their  awards  of  damages.  One  empirical  study  of  juror
behavior found a correlation between jurors’ belief in the frequency of
million-dollar verdicts and their willingness to similarly award at least
a  million  dollars  in  actual  damages.  Edith  Green,  Jane  Goodman  &
Elizabeth  F.  Loftus,  Jurors’  Attitudes  About  Civil  Litigation  and  the
Size of Damage Awards, 40 American U. L. Rev. 805 (1991).

IV  NOMINAL DAMAGES

Where  the  defendant  violates  the  rights  of  the  plaintiff  but  actually
causes no harm for which actual damage can be determined, it would
seem obvious that the plaintiff cannot recover actual damages from
the tortfeasor. But is it still worth the court’s time to entertain a claim
for  damages  in  name  only?  That  is,  should  the  court  consider
awarding  nominal  damages  for  technical  violations  of  rights?  The
following  case  illustrates  just  such  a  scenario,  where  the  jury
apparently  found  no  harm  caused  by  the  defendant’s  good-faith  act
of  trimming  the  plaintiff’s  trees.  Upon  entry  of  a  take-nothing
judgment  in  favor  of  the  defendant,  the  plaintiff  appealed  seeking
some  vindication  of  its  claim.  Consider  the  possible  public  policy
served by permitting such a suit as you read the following case.

LONGENECKER v. ZIMMERMAN
267 P.2d 543 (Kan. 1954)

     , J.

This  was  an  action  to  recover  damages  for  an  alleged  trespass.
Plaintiff  (appellant)  in  her  petition  alleged  she  was  the  owner  of
certain  described  real  estate,  and  defendant  (appellee)  without  her
permission hired and caused the Arborﬁeld Tree Surgery Company, its
agents and employees, to go upon her property and top off, injure and
in  effect  destroy  three  cedar  trees  of  the  value  of  $150  each,  which
trees were growing upon plaintiff’s property and were both shade and
in  their  presence.  Plaintiff  further  stated  she  was
ornamental
entitled  .  .  .  to  recover  from  the  defendant  by  reason  of  the  matters
hereinbefore [for the] value of the plaintiff’s property thus injured and
destroyed. Defendant answered by way of a general denial.

Plaintiff’s  evidence  disclosed  that  she  and  defendant  owned
adjoining  residences  and  were  neighbors  for  about  ﬁve  years.  On
September  8,  1950,  defendant  without  her  permission  employed  a
tree  surgery  company  to  go  upon  plaintiff’s  property  and  top  three
cedar  trees.  The  trees  were  located  some  two  or  three  feet  north  of
plaintiff’s south boundary line. The trees before being topped were 20
to 25 feet high, and were as she wanted them on her property. About
10 feet were cut off the tops of the trees, and from such topping the
trees would never grow any higher, and she didn’t want them to stop
growing.  Cedars  are  not  pruned  from  the  top,  but  are  feathered  and
shaped  and  not  cropped.  She  considered  the  trees  were,  in  effect,
destroyed  by  improper  pruning.  She  attached  a  sentimental  value  to
them as they stood; they served a special purpose, were both shade
and ornamental trees and were worth $150 to $200 each.

Defendant’s evidence was to the effect that the trees, prior to the
time  they  were  topped,  seemed  to  be  dying  out  at  the  top  and  they
also contained bagworms; that two or three feet were taken out of the
top of one tree and about a foot or so out of the other two; that the
work done was beneﬁcial to the trees and that they were not injured.
The  work  consisted  of  cutting  out  dead  branches  and  cleaning  out
bagworms.  One  of  defendant’s  expert  witnesses  testiﬁed  on  direct
examination that the cutting away of dead wood would not injure the
physical  condition  of  the  tree.  However,  on  cross-examination  he
testiﬁed that if the top is taken out, it is the ambition of every bud on
the  tree  to  try  to  take  the  place  of  the  terminal  bud  which  has  been
sacriﬁced,  but  the  trunk  itself  is  no  longer  going  to  grow  in  height.
Defendant stated that she was mistaken as to the boundary line and
believed the trees were on her property.

this
requested instruction, the court
gave the following instruction:

lieu  of

In

You are instructed that the motive of
the defendant is not material, and is not necessary that the defendant be acting
with  malice  or  wrongful  intent  in  order  for  plaintiff  to  recover  damages  to  her
trees, if any.

The  defendant  has  admitted  that  she  had  plaintiff’s  trees  topped  and
therefore she has admitted the trespass and is liable in damages for such sum,
if  any,  as  you  find  from  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence  plaintiff  has
sustained.

In  arriving  at  the  value  of  said  trees  you  may,  if  you  find  from  a
preponderance of the evidence they have been damaged, injured or destroyed,
and  should  take  into  consideration  the  cost  of  replacement  and  also  the
sentimental and utility value of the trees. (Italics supplied.)

From  every  direct  invasion  of  the  person  or  property  of  another,
the  law  infers  some  damage,  without  proof  of  actual  injury.  In  an

action  of  trespass  the  plaintiff  is  always  entitled  to  at  least  nominal
damages,  even  though  he  was  actually  beneﬁted  by  the  act  of  the
defendant.  52  Am.  Jur.  872,  873,  Trespass,  §47;  63  C.J.  1035,  §225.
Since from every unauthorized entry into the close of another, the law
infers some damage, nominal damages are recoverable therefor even
though no substantial damages result and none are proved. In Craig
v. St. Louis-San Francisco R. Co., 120 Kan. 105, 106, 242 P. 117, 118,
it was said:

For  present  purposes  it  may  be  said  that  an  invasion  of  a  legally  protected
interest  imports  injury,  and  injury  is  redressed  by  damages.  Quantum  of
damages depends on extent of injury caused by the invasion. If nothing but the
invasion  appears,  the  injury  is  technical,  and  is  compensated  by  nominal
damages.

It is apparent the trial court erred in including the italicized portion
in  the  mentioned  instruction,  thereby  submitting  the  question  to  the
jury  whether  plaintiff  had  suffered  any  damage  by  reason  of  the
unlawful trespass, when in fact the jury should have been instructed
that damages, in some amount, resulted as a matter of law.

The  petition  alleges  the  facts  constituting  trespass  at  common
law,  that  is,  that  the  plaintiff  was  the  owner  of  certain  property  and
that the defendant without permission or other just cause hired third
persons to go upon a portion of plaintiff’s property and top, injure and,
in  effect,  destroy  three  cedar  trees,  each  of  the  value  of  $150.  .  .  .  It
cannot be said that the erroneous instruction given by the trial court
was not prejudicial to the rights of plaintiff. The judgment of the trial
court  is  reversed  and  the  cause  is  remanded  with  instructions  to
grant the plaintiff a new trial.

1. Justiﬁcation  for  Nominal  Damages.   There  are  a  fair  number  of
cases,  primarily  older  cases,  where  the  court  recites  the  black  letter

law that nominal damages are available for an intentional invasion of
another’s rights, even if no actual harm occurs. There is a legal injury
brought  about  by  intentional  conduct  and  for  this  the  law  affords  a
remedy  at  least  in  the  form  of  nominal  damages.  In  a  world  of
crowded court dockets, what sense does this make? One justiﬁcation
offered  relates  to  permitting  nominal  recovery  if  only  to  declare  the
rights of the respective parties in the event of later disputes:

Thus,  the  allowance  of  nominal  damages  is  generally  based  on
the  ground  either  that  every  injury  from  its  very  nature  legally
imports  damage,  or  that  the  injury  complained  of  would  in  the
future  be  evidence  in  favor  of  the  wrongdoer,  where,  if  continued
for a sufﬁcient length of time, the invasion of the plaintiff’s rights
would ripen into a prescriptive right in favor of the defendant. The
maxim “de minimis non curat lex” [the law cares not about trifles]
will  not  preclude  the  award  of  nominal  damages  in  such  cases.
However,  if  there  is  no  danger  of  prescription,  no  proof  of
substantial loss or injury, or willful wrongdoing by the defendant, it
has  been  said  that  there  is  no  purpose  for  allowing  nominal
damages, and judgment should be rendered for the defendant.

22 Am. Jur. 2d, Damages, §9 (1996). Accordingly, one can fairly safely
assume that any intentional tort (except for a harmless intermeddling
as discussed under Trespass to Chattels in Chapter 2) should at least
give rise to a possible claim for nominal damages. On the other hand,
courts  would  dismiss  a  case  for  negligence  where  the  misconduct
inflicted  no  harm,  as  there  is  no  purpose  to  be  served  in  awarding
nominal  damages  where  the  defendant’s  carelessness  amounted  to
“negligence in the air.”

2.  Other  Motivations  for  Seeking  Nominal  Damages.   Beyond
vindicating her rights, why else might a “victim” of an intentional tort
bother to sue for nominal damages? One reason might be to have a
court rule upon a legal issue in which the parties have some interest.

Setting precedent might be enormously valuable in one setting even if
it ﬁrst arose in a seemingly minor case for nominal damages. Further,
when one’s constitutional rights are violated, courts have sometimes
declared  a  plaintiff  who  has  proven  a  technical  violation  and
recovered  nominal  damages  to  be  the  “prevailing  party”  under  civil
rights statutes that also permit such party to recover attorney’s fees
from  the  defendant.  Sometimes  awards  of  attorney’s  fees  can  be
quite  substantial  and  can  offer  some  deterrent  to  the  defendant
continuing to engage in such misconduct.

Mich. L. Rev. 1257, 1329 (1976).

A study of hundreds of federal
court cases found that punitive

While compensating victims —

“extraordinary” and is used only
to
additional
punishment and deterrence for
the  egregious  conduct  in  which  the  defendant  engaged.  Such  an
award  is  “additional”  because  even  an  award  of  actual  damages
provides some level of punishment and deterrence. Forcing someone
to  pay  for  harms  caused  is  a  negative  consequence  for  having  hurt
another.  But  the  thought  is  that  the  transfer  of  money  to  cover  the
harms may be sufﬁcient to compensate or reimburse the plaintiff but
may  not  be  enough  of  a  punishment  for  the  wrongdoer.  Plaintiffs’
lawyers  making  closing  arguments  in  punitive  damage  cases  talk
about “sending a message” to the defendant that its conduct will not

We have already spent considerable time exploring expansion and
contraction  in  tort  law  based  upon  waxing  and  waning  sentiment

regarding  the  degree  to  which  the  law  fulﬁlls  its  purposes  of
compensating,  deterring,  and  punishing,  balanced  against  providing
jury  verdicts  of
windfall  recoveries  for  plaintiffs  with  runaway
excessive  damages.  These  same  debates  often  focus  upon  awards
of punitive damages because, while they are not routinely handed out
large
in  most  tort  cases,  the  headlines  regarding  particularly
exemplary damage awards can garner much attention. Large punitive
damage awards may be hard to justify at times because of the reality
that  such  an  award  is  truly  a  windfall  to  the  victim  who  has  already
received the law’s best estimate of full compensatory damages, and
then may also receive a punitive award many times greater than his
actual damages.

The  other  aspect  of  punitive  damage  law  that  makes  it  a  natural
center  of  legal  debate  is  that  it  occupies  a  gray  land  somewhere
between  the  civil  and  criminal  sides  of  our  justice  system.  Criminal
law  places  its  primary  focus  upon  retribution — punishing  unlawful
conduct  in  a  way  that  satisﬁes  citizens  and  makes  it  less  likely  that
criminal behavior will be repeated. While that is criminal law’s primary
focus,  judges  frequently  also  enter  judgments  in  criminal  law  cases
requiring  the  convicted  criminal  to  make  restitution  payments  to
compensate  their  victims.  Overlap  exists  between  these  two  worlds
in  two  places — in  criminal  cases  when  restitution  is  required  and  in
civil  cases  when  punitive  damages  are  awarded.  But  the  punitive
damage context is where the controversy exists because civil cases
do  not  offer  the  same  heightened  constitutional  protections  for
citizens  accused  of  crimes — the  constitutional  rights  to  counsel,  to
not have to testify against oneself, and for the prosecution to have to
prove the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Is it appropriate to award
potentially large “ﬁnes” in the form of punitive damages in a civil case
without  such  procedural  protections?  These  concerns  underlie
various  legal  issues  that  abound  in  recent  tort  cases  where  punitive
damages are being considered.

In  this  section  we  will  begin  by  reviewing  some  of  the  common
law’s  conclusions  regarding  when  compensatory  awards  may  be
insufﬁcient and punitive damages necessary to offer complete justice
in response to the tortfeasor’s misconduct. After that we will explore
statutory  and  constitutional  limitations  upon  the  amount  of  punitive
damages.

A. When Civil Punishment Is Permitted

1. Malicious Conduct

Many cases of punitive damages involve intentional torts. But as the
following case demonstrates, not every intentional tort circumstance
warrants an additional award as punishment against the tortfeasor.

SHUGAR v. GUILL
283 S.E.2d 507 (N.C. 1981)

Plaintiff  instituted  this  civil  action  on  5  January  1979  seeking
damages  for  injuries  allegedly  caused  by  an  assault  and  battery
committed  by  defendant.  At  trial  defendant  duly  moved  to  dismiss
plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages on the ground that plaintiff had
failed  properly  to  plead  or  prove  such  claim.  The  trial  judge  denied
these motions and submitted to the jury the issues of liability, punitive
damages, and compensatory damages.

Plaintiff’s  evidence  tended  to  show  that  on  19  October  1978
around  9:25  a.m.  he  entered  the  defendant’s  restaurant  in  Tarboro
known  as  “Cotton’s  Grill”  for  the  purpose  of  joining  several  regular
customers for coffee. After serving himself a cup of coffee, he joined
the  group.  Plaintiff  moved  toward  the  table  where  the  men  sat
without  paying  for  his  cup  of  coffee.  Defendant  was  seated  at  the

table,  and  as  plaintiff  took  a  seat  at  the  table,  he  said  to  defendant,
“This  cup  of  coffee  is  on  the  house.”  Plaintiff  then  told  defendant  to
“charge it against the formica that you owe me for.”

Plaintiff’s remarks were in reference to a dispute between himself
and  defendant  regarding  a  piece  of  formica  that  a  contractor  had
job  at  plaintiff’s  place  of  business  with  his
removed  from  a
permission  to  use  it  in  the  completion  of  a  job  at  defendant’s
restaurant in March, 1978. Plaintiff had billed defendant twice for the
formica, but the $6.25 bill remained unpaid at the time of the October
1978 incident. Defendant had refused to pay for the formica and had
in  turn  sent  plaintiff  a  bill  for  what  defendant  claimed  was  lost  time
for  a  painter  who  had  been  conversing  with  plaintiff  while  he  was
working on a job for defendant. Plaintiff had not honored defendant’s
request  to  reimburse  him  for  the  painter’s  lost  time  although
defendant  had  offered  to  pay  plaintiff  for  the  formica  after  plaintiff
had paid defendant for the claimed lost time.

Following plaintiff’s comment regarding the charging of the coffee
against  the  formica  cost,  defendant  commented  on  plaintiff’s
leave  the  restaurant
cheapness  and  demanded  that  plaintiff
immediately.  Plaintiff  responded  by  saying,  “Make  me.”  Defendant
then  picked  plaintiff  up  in  a  “bear  hug”  and  started  toward  the  door.
Plaintiff managed to free himself and blows were exchanged. Plaintiff
was  struck  about  the  eyes  twice,  and  defendant’s  glasses  were
broken  when  he  was  hit  in  the  face  during  the  scuffle.  A  bystander
attempted  to  intervene,  and  plaintiff,  apparently  thinking  the  melee
over,  dropped  his  hands  to  his  side  at  which  point  defendant  struck
plaintiff squarely in the face breaking his nose and causing it to bleed
profusely.

Plaintiff lost consciousness momentarily after being struck in the
nose.  The  entire  incident  lasted  less  than  sixty  seconds.  Later  that
day,  plaintiff  visited  a  Tarboro  physician  who  referred  him  to  a
specialist in Greenville.

Plaintiff’s  nose  was  treated  by  straightening,  packing,  and
bandaging.  The  medical  treatment  involved  was  quite  painful,  and
plaintiff experienced a partial loss of breathing capacity as a result of
the blow to the nose. Plaintiff’s medical expenses totalled $234.

The  jury  answered  the  issue  of  liability  in  plaintiff’s  favor  and
awarded  him  $2,000  in  compensatory  damages  and  $2,500  in
punitive damages.

      , J.

The  rationale  permitting  recovery  of  punitive  damages  is  that
in  addition  to  compensatory
such  damages  may  be  awarded
damages  to  punish  a  defendant  for  his  wrongful  acts  and  to  deter
others  from  committing  similar  acts.  A  civil  action  may  not  be
maintained solely for the purpose of collecting punitive damages but
may  only  be  awarded  when  a  cause  of  action  otherwise  exists  in
which  at  least  nominal  damages  are  recoverable  by  the  plaintiff.
Worthy v. Knight, 187 S.E. 771 (N.C. 1936).

It is well established in this jurisdiction that punitive damages may
be recovered for an assault and battery but are allowable only  when
the assault and battery is accompanied by an element of aggravation
such as malice, or oppression, or gross and wilful wrong, or a wanton
and  reckless  disregard  of  plaintiff’s  rights.  Oestreicher  v.  American
Nat. Stores, Inc., 225 S.E.2d 797 (N.C. 1976).

Some  jurisdictions  permit  the  recovery  of  punitive  damages  on
the theory of implied or imputed  malice  when  a  person  intentionally
does an act which naturally tends to be injurious. These jurisdictions
thus  infer  the  malice  necessary  to  support  recovery  of  punitive
damages  from  any  assault  and  battery.  Barker  v.  James,  486  P.2d
195  (Ariz.  1971);  Robbs  v.  Missouri  Pac.  Ry.  Co.,  242  S.W.  155  (Mo.
1922);  Custer  v.  Kroeger,  209  Mo.  App.  450,  240  S.W.  241  (1922);
Mecham v. Foley, 235 P.2d 497 (Utah 1951). We do not adhere to this
rule.  To  justify  the  awarding  of  punitive  damages  in  North  Carolina,
there  must  be  a  showing  of  actual  or  express  malice,  that  is,  a

showing  of  a  sense  of  personal  ill  will  toward  the  plaintiff  which
activated  or  incited  a  defendant  to  commit  the  alleged  assault  and
battery. Baker v. Winslow, 113 S.E. 570 (N.C. 1922).

[In reviewing the punitive damage award here, we] ﬁnd it helpful to
review  the  types  of  cases  in  which  punitive  damages  have  been
in  cases  where  a
allowed.  Punitive  damages  were  recovered
clergyman  while  peacefully  walking  down  a  street  was  attacked  by
the defendant and severely injured; where the plaintiff while eating in
a hotel dining room was compelled to sign a retraction by a show of
violence,  accompanied  with  offensive  and  threatening  language;
where defendant assaulted a weak and old person with a stick loaded
with  lead  for  the  reason  that  defendant  thought  plaintiff  was  a
trespasser; [and] where a twelve-year-old boy was assaulted in public
in the presence of others without justiﬁcation or excuse. We note that
all  of  these  cases  contain  a  thread  of  unprovoked  humiliating
assaults,  assaults  on  children,  assaults  on  weaker  persons,  or
assaults where a deadly weapon was callously used. Such is not the
case before us.

The  case  of  Riepe  v.  Green,  65  S.W.2d  667  (Mo.  App.  1933),  is
most  instructive  toward  decision  because  of  its  strong  factual
similarity  to  the  case  before  us.  There  plaintiff  brought  a  civil  action
against defendant seeking compensatory and punitive damages. The
evidence of the plaintiff disclosed that there had been some difﬁculty
between plaintiff and defendant and that plaintiff “had no good feeling
toward him (defendant) for over a year.” Id. at 668. On the day that the
incident complained of occurred, defendant was talking to some men
on the street when plaintiff called him and asked “have you found any
more victims?” Plaintiff then drove his wagon across the sidewalk so
that  defendant  could  not  move.  After  some  further  conversation,
plaintiff  told  defendant  that  he  did  not  want  any  dealings  with  him
because of his refusal to pay for some cow pasture. Plaintiff testiﬁed
that he might have called defendant an “S.O.B.” and a damned crook.
Thereafter, a ﬁght ensued which resulted in plaintiff’s alleged injuries.

The  jury  answered  issues  awarding  plaintiff  compensatory  and
punitive  damages,  and  defendant  appealed.
In  reversing  and
remanding, the Kansas City Court of Appeals reasoned:

The general rule, as to punitive damages, is to the effect that the question is one
for  the  jury  and  not  for  the  court.  This  general  rule  is  predicated  upon  the
presumption that wantonness, recklessness, oppression, or express malice be
shown  by  some  fact  or  circumstance  in  evidence  from  which  one  of  these
elements may be inferred. (Citation omitted.)

We  fail  to  ﬁnd  any  evidence  in  the  record  before  us  that  justiﬁes  the
submission of the issue of punitive damages. In so far as words and conduct
could  provoke  such  a  state  of  mind  as  above,  the  plaintiff  is  shown  to  be  the
aggressor.  One  who  drives  a  wagon  across  the  pathway  of  another  with  the
intent  expressed  by  plaintiff  furnishes  a  poor  subject  for  smart  money.  While
foul  words  and  epithets  do  not  justify  assault,  yet  such  words  and  epithets
mitigate,  and,  in  the  absence  of  any  showing  that  defendant  was  actuated  by
willfull, wanton, and malicious state of mind, it was error to submit the issue of
punitive damages.

Id. at 669.

Applying the above-stated principles of law to the facts presented
by  this  appeal,  we  conclude  that  the  evidence  presented  was  not
sufﬁcient  to  permit  the  jury  reasonably  to  infer  that  defendant’s
actions  were  activated  by  personal  ill  will  toward  plaintiff  or  that  his
acts  were  aggravated  by  oppression,  insult,  rudeness,  or  a  wanton
and  reckless  disregard  of  plaintiff’s  rights.  To  the  contrary,  the
evidence shows that two adults acting as adolescents engaged in an
affray which was precipitated by plaintiff’s “baiting” of defendant and
plaintiff’s  invitation  that  he  be  ejected  from  defendant’s  premises.
Thus,  the  trial  court  erred  by  denying  defendant’s  motion  to  dismiss
on  the  ground  that  there  was  not  sufﬁcient  evidence  to  carry  the
issue of punitive damages to the jury. We afﬁrm the Court of Appeals’
action in vacating for the reasons set forth herein.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Proving  Elements  of  Tort  Not  Necessarily  Enough.   While
intentional  tort  claims  are  often  the  subject  of  punitive  damage
awards, most states refuse to make the possibility of such an award
automatic.  Rather,  in  most  jurisdictions  the  plaintiff  must  prove — in
addition  to  the  elements  of  the
intentional  tort — aggravating
circumstances  referred  to  as  “malice.”  A  minority  of  courts  assume
this  bad  intent  when  an  intentional  tort  is  proven.  The  problem  with
this  approach  is  that  many  intentional  torts  might  not  involve  any  ill
will (for example, a simple trespass where the defendant has taken a
shortcut across the landowner’s property).

2.  Nominal  Damages  as  Anchor.   Some  courts  have  permitted
punitive  damage  claims  when  the  defendant’s  intentional  tort  was
coupled  with  “malice”  despite  the  fact  that  no  actual  harm  was
caused, so long as there was an award of at least nominal damages.
See,  e.g.,  Peete  v.  Blackwell,  504  So.  2d  222  (Ala.  1986)  (upholding
award of $10,000 in punitive damages where angry doctor struck the
arm of a nurse during an emergency procedure despite the fact that
the jury only awarded $1 in nominal damages). This practice is called
into serious question both by constitutional due process issues (see
State  Farm  v.  Campbell  below)  and  under  certain  states’  statutory
modiﬁcations to punitive damages.

3. Problems.   In  light  of  the  Shugar  opinion,  would  the  following

scenarios appear to be appropriate for awards of punitive damages?

A.  A  music  teacher  walks  up  behind  a  student  of  his  in  a  social
setting  and  taps  his  ﬁngers  on  the  student’s  back  as  if  to
simulate  how  to  play  the  piano.  The  student  recoils  in  pain  as
the contact causes a dislocation in her vertebrae. Assume this is
a single intent battery jurisdiction (where only an intent to cause
contact that turns out to be harmful, is required).

B.  A  neighbor  mistakenly  believes  a  tree  is  on  his  property  and
hires  a  trimming  service  to  trim  some  unsightly  and  unhealthy
branches. It turns out the tree belongs to a neighbor.

C. A debt collector repeatedly hits a debtor over the head with the
butt  end  of  a  handgun  in  order  to  compel  full  payment  of  the
debt.  As  the  collector  raises  his  hand  to  swing  at  the  debtor
again, the gun discharges and shoots the debtor in the abdomen
causing serious injuries.

2. Corporate Liability for Reckless Conduct

In  addition  to  a  showing  of  “malice”  accompanying  the  commission
of  an  intentional  tort,  most  courts  have  also  recognized  reckless
misconduct  (or  gross  negligence)  as  an  additional  path  to  punitive
damages.  In  Chapter  3,  we  explored  gross  negligence  as  an
alternative standard to ordinary negligence in Mobil Oil v. Ellender. In
that case, the court discussed the two-pronged nature of a showing
of  gross  negligence:  (1)  that,  viewed  objectively,  the  defendant’s
conduct  created  a  substantial  probability  of  serious  danger  to  the
plaintiff; and (2) that the defendant had a subjective awareness of the
risk of harm arising from its actions but made the conscious decision
to  disregard  this  risk.  Many  cases  of  gross  negligence  arise  in  the
corporate  context,  such  as  Mobil Oil.  In  such  cases,  courts  have  to
determine  precisely  whose  reckless  misconduct  sufﬁces  to  justify
punishing  the  corporate  entity.  In  other  words,  when  does  the
reckless  misconduct  of  an  employee  count  as  recklessness  by  the
corporation  itself?  Below  is  an  additional  excerpt  from  Mobil  Oil
discussing and applying the gross negligence standard to a punitive
damage award in the corporate context.

MOBIL v. ELLENDER

in

A  corporation  may  be  liable  in  punitive  damages  for  gross
negligence  only  if  the  corporation  itself  commits  gross  negligence.
See  Fort  Worth  Elevators,  Co.  v.  Russell,  70  S.W.2d  397,  406  (Tex.
1934), overruled on other grounds by Wright v. Gifford-Hill & Co., 725
S.W.2d 712 (Tex. 1987). Because a corporation can “act only through
agents  of  some  character,”  Fort  Worth  Elevators,  70  S.W.2d  at  402,
this  Court  has  developed  tests  for  distinguishing  between  acts  that
are  solely  attributable  to  agents  or  employees  and  acts  that  are
directly  attributable  to  the  corporation.  See  Hammerly  Oaks,  Inc.  v.
Edwards,  958  S.W.2d  387  (Tex.  1997).  A  corporation  is  liable  for
it  authorizes  or  ratiﬁes  an  agent’s  gross

King  v.  McGuff,  149  Tex.  432,  234  S.W.2d  403,  405  (Tex.  1950)
(adopting the Restatement of Torts section 909).

if

A corporation is also liable if it commits gross negligence through
the actions or inactions of a vice principal. See Hammerly Oaks, 958
S.W.2d at 389. “Vice principal” encompasses:

(a)  corporate  ofﬁcers;  (b)  those  who  have  authority  to  employ,  direct,  and
discharge  servants  of  the  master;  (c)  those  engaged  in  the  performance  of
nondelegable  or  absolute  duties  of  the  master;  and  (d)  those  to  whom  the

master  has  conﬁded  the  management  of  the  whole  or  a  department  or  a
division of the business.

See Hammerly Oaks, 958 S.W.2d at 391.

In  determining  whether  acts  are  directly  attributable  to  the
corporation,  the  reviewing  court  does  not  simply  judge  individual
elements or facts. Instead, the court should review all the surrounding
facts and circumstances to determine whether the corporation itself
is grossly negligent. Whether the corporation’s acts can be attributed
to  the  corporation  itself,  and  thereby  constitute  corporate  gross
negligence, is determined by reasonable inferences the factﬁnder can
draw  from  what  the  corporation  did  or  failed  to  do  and  the  facts
existing  at  relevant  times  that  contributed  to  a  plaintiff’s  alleged
damages.

[The court found that the evidence showed there was a signiﬁcant
health risk that was known throughout the industry, and within Mobil,
to  prolonged  or  repeated  exposure  to  benzene.  The  evidence  also
showed  that  the  exposure  of  workers  at  defendant’s  plant  was  at
dangerously high levels.]

Mobil  counters  that  because  there  is  no  evidence  that  a  vice
principal’s  conduct  involved  an  extreme  degree  of  risk  to  contract
workers  like  Ellender,  Mobil  cannot  be  liable  for  gross  negligence.
However,  in  reviewing  all  the  facts  and  circumstances,  we  conclude
that  there  is  evidence  that  Mobil’s  own  acts  and  omissions  involved
an extreme degree of risk to contract workers like Ellender.

David  B.  Dunham,  a  Mobil  industrial  hygienist,  testiﬁed  that
although Mobil monitored its employees, it had an “unwritten practice
or  policy”  not  to  monitor  contract  workers  and  that  when  he
attempted to monitor contract workers, he was told not to. Ellender’s
co-workers  testiﬁed  that  they  never  saw  any  signs  warning  them  of
benzene  hazards  at  Mobil  and  that  Mobil  did  not  monitor  them  for
exposure  or  provide  them  with  protective  gear  when  they  worked
around  benzene.  Moreover,  Mobil  did  not  include  any  reference  to

benzene  or  other  chemicals  in  its  1967  pamphlet  entitled  “Mobil
Safety  and  Security  Regulations  for  Contract  Workers.”  Dr.  Josh
Esslinger,  a  former  medical  consultant  for  Mobil  in  Beaumont,
testiﬁed  that  he  knew  workers  washed  their  hands  in  benzene  and
that  such  a  practice  indicated  that  workers  were  not  adequately
warned  of  benzene  hazards.  Dr.  Dement  testiﬁed  that  Mobil’s
industrial  hygiene  program  was  poor  and  practically  nonexistent  for
contractors.  This  is  evidence  from  which  the  jury  could  reasonably
infer  that  Mobil  had  a  company  policy  of  not  monitoring  contract
workers  for  benzene  exposure,  not  warning  them  of  the  dangers  of
such exposure, and not providing them with protective gear and that
this  policy  involved  an  extreme  degree  of  risk  to  those  workers.  See
generally  McPhearson,  463  S.W.2d  at  176.  Thus,  there  is  evidence
that acts and omissions of Mobil itself involved an extreme degree of

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Gross Negligence as Basis for Punitive Damages.  While the vast
majority  of  courts  have  traditionally  accepted  the  possibility  of  a
jury’s award of punitive damages in accidental injury cases where the
defendant’s conduct amounts to gross negligence, reckless, or “wilful
and wantonness,” a minority of courts have dismissed this possibility
— instead  insisting  on  a  showing  of  “actual  malice”  as  a  motivation
for the wrongful conduct as the needed threshold. See,  e.g.,  Owens-
Illinois,  Inc.  v.  Zenobia,  601  A.2d  633  (Md.  1992)  (rejecting  gross
negligence  as  a  basis  for  punitive  damages  and  instead  insisting
upon  a  ﬁnding  of  “evil  motive,  intent  to  injure,  ill  will,  or  fraud,  i.e.,
‘actual malice.’”).

2.  Gross  Negligence  of  the  Corporation  Itself.   An  artiﬁcial  legal
entity, such as a corporation, can only act through its employees and

agents.  But  just  because  one  of  those  employees  has  engaged  in
misconduct  warranting  punitive  damages  does  not  automatically
mean  the  corporation  should  be  punished.  In  the  next  chapter  on
Apportionment,  we  will  discuss  vicarious  liability — a  type  of  guilt  by
association — for  actual  damages.  But  the  ease  by  which  a
corporation might be liable for its employees’ ordinary negligence in a
suit  for  compensatory  damages  does  not  apply  to  exemplary
damages.  In  Mobil,  the  court  acknowledges  various  bases  for
corporate liability for punitive damages — authorization or ratiﬁcation
of  the  employees’  malicious  or  grossly  negligent  conduct,  or  where
the bad-acting employee is part of management, as a vice principal.
The  court  also  mentions  the  gross  negligence  in  hiring  a  bad-acting
employee as a basis for corporate liability for punitive damages, but
this  is  redundant  because  such  conduct  would  necessarily  involve
the gross negligence of a vice principal.

3.  Problems.   In  light  of  the  court’s  opinion  in  Mobil  Oil,  would
there be a potential for punitive damages against the corporate entity
below?

A.  A  pizza  delivery  person  is  heavily  intoxicated  while  driving  to

deliver a pizza and runs over the plaintiff pedestrian.

B.  The  same  pizza  delivery  person  was  visibly  intoxicated  in  front
of  the  pizza  store  manager  while  picking  up  the  pizza  for
delivery.

B. The Amount of Punitive Damages

Under  the  common  law,  there  is  no  real  measure  for  the  amount  of
punitive  damages  other  than  that  the  jury  should  ﬁnd  a  suitable
amount in light of the following considerations:

The nature of the wrong;
The character of the conduct involved;

The degree of culpability of the wrongdoer;
The situation and sensibilities of the parties concerned;
The  extent  to  which  such  conduct  offends  a  public  sense  of
justice and propriety; and
The net worth of the defendant.

Tex.  Civ.  Prac.  &  Rem.  Code  §41.011  (listing  the  factors  the  trier  of
fact  “shall  consider”  in  “determining  the  amount  of  exemplary
damages,  if  any”).  As  further  examples  of  tort  reform,  both  the  U.S.
Supreme  Court  and  various  state  legislatures  have  placed  limits  on
the traditionally great discretion given to juries. We will discuss each
of these types of limits in order. In State Farm Insurance v. Campbell,
the Supreme Court applies new constitutional Due Process limits to a
insurance  company’s  conduct

1. Due Process Limits

For centuries, federal courts have left the world of punitive damages
to the control of state common law. Recently as a type of judicial tort
reform,  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court  has  recognized  as  a  Due  Process
limitation that excessively high punitive damage awards may violate
the rights of the tortfeasor. In State Farm, the Court applies this new
constitutional  standard  to  a  rather  large  award  against  an  insurer
whose  conduct  “merits  no  praise.”  The  issue  was  whether  the  state
court  jury  had  doled  out  an  excessive  punishment  in  its  exemplary
damage award.

STATE FARM MUTUAL v. CAMPBELL

538 U.S. 408 (2003)

       , J.

We address once again the measure of punishment, by means of
punitive  damages,  a  State  may  impose  upon  a  defendant  in  a  civil
case. The question is whether, in the circumstances we shall recount,
an  award  of  $145  million
full
compensatory damages are $1 million, is excessive and in violation of
the  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the
Constitution of the United States.

in  punitive  damages,  where

In 1981, Curtis Campbell (Campbell) was driving with his wife, Inez
Preece Campbell, in Cache County, Utah. He decided to pass six vans
traveling  ahead  of  them  on  a  two-lane  highway.  Todd  Ospital  was
driving a small car approaching from the opposite direction. To avoid
a  head-on  collision  with  Campbell,  who  by  then  was  driving  on  the
wrong  side  of  the  highway  and  toward  oncoming  trafﬁc,  Ospital
swerved onto the shoulder, lost control of his automobile, and collided
with  a  vehicle  driven  by  Robert  G.  Slusher.  Ospital  was  killed,  and
Slusher was rendered permanently disabled. The Campbells escaped
unscathed.

liability  and  declined  offers  by
Slusher  and  Ospital’s  estate  to
settle  the  claims  for  the  policy
limit  of  $50,000.  State  Farm
also  ignored  the  advice  of  one
of  its  own  investigators  and
took  the  case  to  trial,  assuring
[their

assets were safe, that they had
no liability for the accident, and
that State Farm would take care of them so they need not hire their
own  separate  counsel].  To  the  contrary,  a  jury  determined  that
Campbell was 100 percent at fault, and a judgment was returned for
$185,849, far more than the amount offered in settlement.

that

At  ﬁrst  State  Farm  refused  to  cover  the  $135,849  in  excess
liability. Its counsel made this clear to the Campbells: “You may want
to put for sale signs on your property to get things moving.” Nor was
State Farm willing to post a supersedeas bond to allow Campbell to
appeal the judgment against him. Campbell obtained his own counsel
to appeal the verdict. During the pendency of the appeal, in late 1984,
Slusher,  Ospital,  and  the  Campbells  reached  an  agreement  whereby
Slusher  and  Ospital  agreed  not  to  seek  satisfaction  of  their  claims
against the Campbells. In exchange the Campbells agreed to pursue
a  bad  faith  action  against  State  Farm  and  to  be  represented  by
Slusher’s  and  Ospital’s  attorneys.  The  Campbells  also  agreed  that
Slusher  and  Ospital  would  have  a  right  to  play  a  part  in  all  major
decisions  concerning  the  bad  faith  action.  No  settlement  could  be
concluded  without  Slusher’s  and  Ospital’s  approval,  and  Slusher  and
Ospital would receive 90 percent of any verdict against State Farm.

In 1989, the Utah Supreme Court denied Campbell’s appeal in the
wrongful  death  and  tort  actions.  State  Farm  then  paid  the  entire
judgment,  including  the  amounts  in  excess  of  the  policy  limits.  The
Campbells nonetheless ﬁled a complaint against State Farm alleging

bad faith, fraud, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. State
Farm  moved  in  limine  to  exclude  evidence  of  alleged  conduct  that
occurred in unrelated cases outside of Utah, but the trial court denied
the motion. At State Farm’s request the trial court bifurcated the trial
into  two  phases  conducted  before  different  juries.  In  the  ﬁrst  phase
the  jury  determined  that  State  Farm’s  decision  not  to  settle  was
unreasonable because there was a substantial likelihood of an excess
verdict.

Before  the  second  phase  of  the  action  against  State  Farm  we
decided BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559 (1996), and
refused  to  sustain  a  $2  million  punitive  damages  award  which
accompanied  a  verdict  of  only  $4,000  in  compensatory  damages.
Based on that decision, State Farm again moved for the exclusion of
evidence  of  dissimilar  out-of-state  conduct.  The  trial  court  denied
State Farm’s motion.

The  second  phase  addressed  State  Farm’s  liability  for  fraud  and
intentional  infliction  of  emotional  distress,  as  well  as  compensatory
and  punitive  damages.  The  Utah  Supreme  Court  aptly  characterized
this phase of the trial:

State Farm argued during phase II that its decision to take the case to trial was
an  “honest  mistake”  that  did  not  warrant  punitive  damages.  In  contrast,  the
Campbells  introduced  evidence  that  State  Farm’s  decision  to  take  the  case  to
trial  was  a  result  of  a  national  scheme  to  meet  corporate  ﬁscal  goals  by
capping  payouts  on  claims  company  wide.  To  prove  the  existence  of  this
scheme,  the  trial  court  allowed  the  Campbells  to  introduce  extensive  expert
testimony  regarding  fraudulent  practices  by  State  Farm  in  its  nation-wide
operations.  Although  State  Farm  moved  prior  to  phase  II  of  the  trial  for  the
exclusion of such evidence and continued to object to it at trial, the trial court
ruled  that  such  evidence  was  admissible  to  determine  whether  State  Farm’s
conduct in the Campbell case was indeed intentional and sufﬁciently egregious
to warrant punitive damages.

Evidence  pertaining  to  the  [scheme]  concerned  State  Farm’s
business  practices  for  over  20  years  in  numerous  States.  Most  of

these  practices  bore  no  relation  to  third-party  automobile  insurance
claims, the type of claim underlying the Campbells’ complaint against
the  company.  The  jury  awarded  the  Campbells  $2.6  million  in
compensatory damages and $145 million in punitive damages, which
the trial court reduced to $1 million and $25 million respectively. Both
parties appealed.

The  Utah  Supreme  Court  [reinstated  the  $145  million  punitive
damage verdict. State Farm appealed from the judgment of $1 million
in actual damages and $145 million in punitive damages].

We  recognized  in  Cooper  Industries,  Inc.  v.  Leatherman  Tool
Group,  Inc.,  532  U.S.  424  (2001),  that  in  our  judicial  system
compensatory  and  punitive  damages,  although  usually  awarded  at
the same time by the same decisionmaker, serve different purposes.
Compensatory  damages  “are  intended  to  redress  the  concrete  loss
that  the  plaintiff  has  suffered  by  reason  of  the  defendant’s  wrongful
conduct.”  By  contrast,  punitive  damages  serve  a  broader  function;
they are aimed at deterrence and retribution.

While  States  possess  discretion  over  the  imposition  of  punitive
damages,  it  is  well  established  that  there  are  procedural  and
substantive  constitutional  limitations  on  these  awards.  The  Due
Process  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  prohibits  the
imposition  of  grossly  excessive  or  arbitrary  punishments  on  a
tortfeasor.  The  reason
is  that  “elementary  notions  of  fairness
enshrined  in  our  constitutional  jurisprudence  dictate  that  a  person
receive  fair  notice  not  only  of  the  conduct  that  will  subject  him  to
punishment, but also of the severity of the penalty that a State may
impose.”  Id.,  at  574.  To  the  extent  an  award  is  grossly  excessive,  it
furthers  no
legitimate  purpose  and  constitutes  an  arbitrary
deprivation of property.

Although  these  awards  serve  the  same  purposes  as  criminal
penalties,  defendants  subjected  to  punitive  damages  in  civil  cases
have  not  been  accorded  the  protections  applicable  in  a  criminal

proceeding.  This  increases  our  concerns  over  the  imprecise  manner
in which punitive damages systems are administered.

In light of these concerns, in Gore we instructed courts reviewing
punitive  damages  to  consider  three  guideposts:  (1)  the  degree  of
reprehensibility  of  the  defendant’s  misconduct;  (2)  the  disparity
between the actual or potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the
punitive damages award; and (3) the difference between the punitive
damages  awarded  by  the  jury  and  the  civil  penalties  authorized  or
imposed in comparable cases.

Under  the  principles  outlined  in  BMW  of  North  America,  Inc.  v.
Gore,  this  case  is  neither  close  nor  difﬁcult.  It  was  error  to  reinstate
the  jury’s  $145  million  punitive  damages  award.  We  address  each
guidepost of Gore in some detail.

“[T]he  most  important  indicium  of  the  reasonableness  of  a
punitive  damages  award  is  the  degree  of  reprehensibility  of  the
defendant’s conduct.” Gore, supra, at 575. We have instructed courts
to  determine  the  reprehensibility  of  a  defendant  by  considering
whether: the harm caused was physical as opposed to economic; the
tortious conduct evinced an indifference to or a reckless disregard of
the health or safety of others; the target of the conduct had ﬁnancial
vulnerability;  the  conduct  involved  repeated  actions  or  was  an
isolated  incident;  and  the  harm  was  the  result  of  intentional  malice,
trickery, or deceit, or mere accident. It should be presumed a plaintiff
has been made whole for his injuries by compensatory damages, so
if  the  defendant’s
punitive  damages  should  only  be  awarded
is  so
culpability,  after  having  paid  compensatory  damages,
reprehensible  as  to  warrant  the  imposition  of  further  sanctions  to
achieve punishment or deterrence.

Applying these factors in the instant case, we must acknowledge
that  State  Farm’s  handling  of  the  claims  against  the  Campbells
merits  no  praise.  The  trial  court  found  that  State  Farm’s  employees
altered  the  company’s  records  to  make  Campbell  appear  less

culpable.  State  Farm  disregarded  the  overwhelming  likelihood  of
liability  and  the  near-certain  probability  that,  by  taking  the  case  to
trial,  a  judgment  in  excess  of  the  policy  limits  would  be  awarded.
State  Farm  ampliﬁed  the  harm  by  at  ﬁrst  assuring  the  Campbells
their assets would be safe from any verdict and by later telling them,
postjudgment, to put a for-sale sign on their house. While we do not
suggest  there  was  error  in  awarding  punitive  damages  based  upon
State  Farm’s  conduct  toward  the  Campbells,  a  more  modest
punishment  for  this  reprehensible  conduct  could  have  satisﬁed  the
State’s  legitimate  objectives,  and  the  Utah  courts  should  have  gone
no further.

This case, instead, was used as a platform to expose, and punish,
the perceived deﬁciencies of State Farm’s operations throughout the
country. The Utah Supreme Court’s opinion makes explicit that State
Farm was being condemned for its nationwide policies rather than for
the conduct direct toward the Campbells.

[The  most]  fundamental  reason  the  Utah  courts  erred  in  relying
upon this and other evidence: The courts awarded punitive damages
to  punish  and  deter  conduct  that  bore  no  relation  to  the  Campbells’
harm. A defendant’s dissimilar acts, independent from the acts upon
which liability was premised, may not serve as the basis for punitive
damages.  A  defendant  should  be  punished  for  the  conduct  that
harmed the plaintiff, not for being an unsavory individual or business.
Due  process  does  not  permit  courts,  in  the  calculation  of  punitive
damages,  to  adjudicate  the  merits  of  other  parties’  hypothetical
claims  against  a  defendant  under  the  guise  of  the  reprehensibility
analysis, but we have no doubt the Utah Supreme Court did that here.
Punishment  on  these  bases  creates  the  possibility  of  multiple
punitive damages awards for the same conduct; for in the usual case
nonparties  are  not  bound  by  the  judgment  some  other  plaintiff
obtains.

The same reasons lead us to conclude the Utah Supreme Court’s
decision  cannot  be  justiﬁed  on  the  grounds  that  State  Farm  was  a

recidivist.  Although  “our  holdings  that  a  recidivist  may  be  punished
more  severely  than  a  ﬁrst  offender  recognize  that  repeated
misconduct  is  more  reprehensible  than  an  individual  instance  of
malfeasance,” Gore, at 577, in the context of civil actions courts must
ensure the conduct in question replicates the prior transgressions.

The  Campbells  have

identiﬁed  scant  evidence  of  repeated
misconduct of the sort that injured them. Nor does our review of the
Utah  courts’  decisions  convince  us  that  State  Farm  was  only
punished for its actions toward the Campbells. Although evidence of
other acts need not be identical to have relevance in the calculation of
punitive  damages,  the  Utah  court  erred  here  because  evidence
pertaining to claims that had nothing to do with a third-party lawsuit
was  introduced  at  length.  For  example,  the  Utah  Supreme  Court
criticized State Farm’s investigation into the personal life of one of its
employees  and,  in  a  broader  approach,  the  manner  in  which  State
reprehensibility
Farm’s  policies  corrupted
guidepost does not permit courts to expand the scope of the case so
that a defendant may be punished for any malfeasance, which in this
case  extended  for  a  20-year  period.  In  this  case,  because  the
Campbells  have  shown  no  conduct  by  State  Farm  similar  to  that
which  harmed  them,  the  conduct  that  harmed  them  is  the  only
conduct relevant to the reprehensibility analysis.

its  employees.  The

Turning to the second Gore guidepost, we have been reluctant to
identify  concrete  constitutional  limits  on  the  ratio  between  harm,  or
potential  harm,  to  the  plaintiff  and  the  punitive  damages  award.  We
decline again to impose a bright-line ratio which a punitive damages
award cannot exceed. Our jurisprudence and the principles it has now
established  demonstrate,  however,  that,  in  practice,  few  awards
exceeding  a  single-digit  ratio  between  punitive  and  compensatory
damages, to a signiﬁcant degree, will satisfy due process. In Haslip, in
upholding a punitive damages award, we concluded that an award of
more  than  four  times  the  amount  of  compensatory  damages  might
be close to the line of constitutional impropriety. We cited that 4-to-1

ratio  again  in  Gore.  The  Court  further  referenced  a  long  legislative
history,  dating  back  over  700  years  and  going  forward  to  today,
providing  for  sanctions  of  double,  treble,  or  quadruple  damages  to
deter  and  punish.  While  these  ratios  are  not  binding,  they  are
instructive.  They  demonstrate  what  should  be  obvious:  Single-digit
multipliers  are  more  likely  to  comport  with  due  process,  while  still
achieving the State’s goals of deterrence and retribution, than awards
with ratios in range of 500 to 1, or, in this case, of 145 to 1.

Nonetheless,  because  there  are  no  rigid  benchmarks  that  a
punitive  damages  award  may  not  surpass,  ratios  greater  than  those
we  have  previously  upheld  may  comport  with  due  process  where  “a
particularly  egregious  act  has  resulted  in  only  a  small  amount  of
economic  damages.”  The  converse  is  also  true,  however.  When
compensatory  damages  are  substantial,  then  a  lesser  ratio,  perhaps
only equal to compensatory damages, can reach the outermost limit
of  the  due  process  guarantee.  The  precise  award  in  any  case,  of
course,  must  be  based  upon  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  the
defendant’s conduct and the harm to the plaintiff.

In  sum,  courts  must  ensure  that  the  measure  of  punishment  is
both  reasonable  and  proportionate  to  the  amount  of  harm  to  the
plaintiff and to the general damages recovered. In the context of this
case, we have no doubt that there is a presumption against an award
that has a 145-to-1 ratio. The compensatory award in this case was
substantial; the Campbells were awarded $1 million for a year and a
half  of  emotional  distress.  This  was  complete  compensation.  The
harm arose from a transaction in the economic realm, not from some
physical assault or trauma; there were no physical injuries; and State
Farm  paid  the  excess  verdict  before  the  complaint  was  ﬁled,  so  the
Campbells  suffered  only  minor  economic  injuries  for  the  18-month
period in which State Farm refused to resolve the claim against them.
The  compensatory  damages  for  the  injury  suffered  here,  moreover,
likely  were  based  on  a  component  which  was  duplicated  in  the
punitive award. Much of the distress was caused by the outrage and

humiliation the Campbells suffered at the actions of their insurer; and
it  is  a  major  role  of  punitive  damages  to  condemn  such  conduct.
Compensatory  damages,  however,  already  contain  this  punitive
element.

The  third  guidepost  in  Gore  is  the  disparity  between  the  punitive
damages  award  and  the  “civil  penalties  authorized  or  imposed  in
comparable cases.”

license,

Here, we need not dwell long on this guidepost. The most relevant
civil  sanction  under  Utah  state  law  for  the  wrong  done  to  the
Campbells  appears  to  be  a  $10,000  ﬁne  for  an  act  of  fraud,  an
amount  dwarfed  by  the  $145  million  punitive  damages  award.  The
Supreme  Court  of  Utah  speculated  about  the  loss  of  State  Farm’s
the  disgorgement  of  proﬁts,  and  possible
business
imprisonment,  but  here  again  its  references  were  to  the  broad
fraudulent  scheme  drawn  from  evidence  of  out-of-state  and
dissimilar conduct. This analysis was insufﬁcient to justify the award.
An  application  of  the  Gore  guideposts  to  the  facts  of  this  case,
especially in light of the substantial compensatory damages awarded
(a portion of which contained a punitive element), likely would justify
a  punitive  damages  award  at  or  near  the  amount  of  compensatory
damages.  The  punitive  award  of  $145  million,  therefore,  was  neither
reasonable nor proportionate to the wrong committed, and it was an
irrational  and  arbitrary  deprivation  of  the  property  of  the  defendant.
The  proper  calculation  of  punitive  damages  under  the  principles  we
have discussed should be resolved, in the ﬁrst instance, by the Utah
courts.

The  judgment  of  the  Utah  Supreme  Court  is  reversed,  and  the

case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion

I adhere to the view expressed in my dissenting opinion in BMW of
North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 598-99 (1996), that the Due
Process  Clause  provides  no  substantive  protections  against
“excessive” or “unreasonable” awards of punitive damages. I am also
of  the  view  that  the  punitive  damages  jurisprudence  which  has
sprung  forth  from  BMW  v.  Gore  is  insusceptible  of  principled

to  accord  state-court

When  the  Court  ﬁrst  ventured  to  override  state-court  punitive
damages awards, it did so moderately. The Court recalled that “in our
federal  system,  States  necessarily  have  considerable  flexibility  in
determining  the  level  of  punitive  damages  that  they  will  allow  in
different classes of cases and in any particular case.” Gore, 517 U.S.

punitive  damages,  the  handiwork  in  setting  single-digit  and  1-to-1
benchmarks could hardly be questioned; in a judicial decree imposed
on  the  States  by  this  Court  under  the  banner  of  substantive  due
process, the numerical controls today’s decision installs seem to me
boldly out of order.

I remain of the view that this Court has no warrant to reform state
law governing awards of punitive damages. Even if I were prepared to
accept  the  flexible  guides  prescribed  in  Gore,  I  would  not  join  the
Court’s  swift  conversion  of  those  guides  into  instructions  that  begin
to  resemble  marching  orders.  For  the  reasons  stated,  I  would  leave
the judgment of the Utah Supreme Court undisturbed.

2. Statutory Limits

Justice Ginsburg had earlier dissented from the majority’s opinion in
the  BMW  v. Gore  case  on  the  grounds  that  the  Supreme  Court  was
violating principles of traditional federalism by imposing unnecessary
federal  court  oversight  to  state  court  jury  decisions.  She  observed
that  many  states  had  already  passed  legislation  placing  appropriate
limits  on  the  size  of  punitive  damage  verdict.  Since  then,  additional
states have followed suit. The majority of states now place statutory

limits  on  the  jury’s  ability  to  award  exemplary  damages.  Some
examples include:

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  No  Entitlement  to  Award  of  Punitive  Damages.   Courts  have
consistently held that a plaintiff has no vested right or entitlement to
an  award  of  punitive  damages.  No  matter  how  despicable  the
behavior of the tortfeasor, a jury can decide that only actual damages

should be awarded. This makes it extremely difﬁcult for a plaintiff to
complain  about  a  punitive  damage  cap’s  application  under  any
constitutional right analysis.

2.  Impact  of  Statutory  Limits  on  BMW  Factors.   Given  that  so
many states now have statutory limits on punitive damages, such as
those  examples  above,  does  this  add  weight  to  the  concerns  of
Justice Scalia that the federal courts have no business meddling in a
state’s  punitive  damage  jurisprudence?  If  a  punitive  damage  award
complies  with  any  of  the  foregoing  statutes,  is  it  likely  to  be  held
unconstitutional  under  State  Farm?  If  not,  is  it  worth  the  incursion
into state law matters?

“LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY . . . ”

5th Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions (Civil Cases) 15.13
Punitive Damages:

If  you  determine  that  the  defendant’s  conduct  was  so
shocking  and  offensive  as  to  justify  an  award  of  punitive
damages,  you  may  exercise  your  discretion  to  award  those
damages.  In  making  any  award  of  punitive  damages,  you
should  consider  that  the  purpose  of  punitive  damages  is  to
punish  a  defendant  for  shocking  conduct,  and  to  deter  the
defendant and others from engaging in similar conduct in the
future.  The  law  does  not  require  you  to  award  punitive
damages,  however,  if  you  decide  to  award  punitive  damages,
you  must  use  sound  reason  in  setting  the  amount  of  the
damages.  The  amount  of  an  award  must  not  reflect  bias,
prejudice, or sympathy toward any party. However, the amount
can be as large as you believe necessary to fulﬁll the purposes
of  punitive  damages.  You  may  consider  the  ﬁnancial
resources  of  the  defendant  in  ﬁxing  the  amount  of  punitive

damages and you may impose punitive damages against one
or  more  of  the  defendants,  and  not  others,  or  against  more
than one defendant in different amounts.

1. While my description of plaintiffs’ injuries may seem clinical and detached, I
did  not  view  their  plight  without  compassion.  But  it  would  serve  little  purpose  to
adorn  this  description  with  emotional  adjectives.  And  my  task,  in  any  event,  is  to
make an award based upon the facts, freed from inappropriate considerations such
as sympathy, passion or prejudice. This I have tried to do.

2. Plaintiff Burrows was born November 30, 1963; thus, he was 12 years old and
an  eighth  grader  at  the  time  of  the  accident.  Neither,  therefore,  has  had  any  work
history, making it necessary for damages purposes to predict what each plaintiff’s
future earnings would have been if the accident hadn’t happened. Prediction also is
necessary as to actual future earnings in light of the disabilities suffered from the
accident. Neither side suggested that either plaintiff would likely become a member
of the professions or work in a managerial or entrepreneurial capacity. Thus, each
side,  in  submitting  opinions  as  to  the  vocational  future  of  the  plaintiffs,  assumed
that  each  would  enter  the  workforce  at  19,  upon  completion  of  high  school.
Plaintiffs’  experts,  in  predicting  a  skilled  worker  future,  assumed  a  four-year
apprenticeship  period,  with,  thereafter,  a  42-year  journeyman  career  in  effect,
assuming  retirement  from  the  workforce  at  age  65.  Defendant’s  expert  made
similar assumptions, except that defendant did not agree that either plaintiff would
have become a member of a skilled craft.

3. Each side recognized, of course, the necessity to reduce to present value the
projected  stream  of  lost  future  earnings.  The  method  may  be  stated  simply.  The
estimator (fact ﬁnder) must predict what inflation will occur in the wage rate during
the working lifetime of each plaintiff and what return (or interest) could be earned
from investment of the lump sum award over that same period. The fact ﬁnder then
must calculate the amount of an award that would return a stream of earnings over
the plaintiff’s working lifetime equal to the amount of earnings that the plaintiff will
lose over that period as a result of his injury. In simple, non-expert lingo, the higher
the assumed rate of investment return (interest) compared to the assumed rate of
wage inflation, the lower is the present lump-sum amount of the award. Conversely,
the  lower  the  assumed  rate  of  investment  return  (discount  to  present  value)
compared  to  the  assumed  rate  of  wage  inflation,  the  higher  is  the  present  lump-
sum  amount  of  the  award.  If  the  assumed  interest  rate  is  equal  to  the  assumed

wage inflation rate, then no adjustment to ascertain present value is necessary. It is
not  entirely  surprising,  therefore,  that  plaintiffs’  experts  expressed  opinions  calling
for  the  use  of  factors  producing  large  present-day  amounts,  and  that  defendant’s
experts expressed opinions calling for the use of factors producing small present-
day amounts.

caused  by  the  death  of  the  insured  are  proceeds  of  an  investment  and  can  be
received  independently  of  the  claim  for  damages  against  the  person  who  caused
the  death  of  the  insured.  The  same  rule  has  been  held  applicable  to  accident
insurance contracts. As to both kinds of insurance it has been stated: ‘Such a policy
is  an  investment  contract,  giving  the  owner  or  beneﬁciary  an  absolute  right,
independent of the right against any third person responsible for the injury covered
by the policy.’ An insurer who fully compensates the insured, however, is subrogated
to the rights of the insured against [or may receive a refund of beneﬁts from] one
who insured his property if the insurance was for the protection of the property of
the insured, and was therefore an indemnity contract. In such cases subrogation [or
refund  of  beneﬁts]  is  the  means  by  which  double  recovery  by  the  owner  is
prevented  and  the  ultimate  burden  shifted  to  the  wrongdoer  where  it  belongs.”

provision  in  a  Blue  Shield  medical  insurance  contract  similar  to  the  one  at  issue
here. Block v. California Physicians’ Service, 53 Cal. Rptr. 51 (Cal. App. 1966).

19.  Under  workmen’s  compensation,  subrogation  normally  prevents  double
recovery  by  shifting  the  loss  to  the  tortfeasor.  In  actions  to  recover  against  a
tortfeasor, the court sets a reasonable attorney’s fee.

the sum of one million dollars.

6.  SDCL  21-3-11  was  adopted  as  a  result  of  recommendations  by  the  1975
South Dakota Legislature’s Special Committee on Medical Malpractice. As noted by
one commentator:

Statements  made  by  insurance  representatives  before  the  [Committee],
referring  to  the  low  number  of  medical  malpractice  claims  brought  in  the
state, can only create signiﬁcant doubt that South Dakota was experiencing a
genuine  insurance  crisis  at  that  time.  Startling  data  on  medical  malpractice
claims  in  South  Dakota,  North  Dakota,  and  Minnesota,  collected  by  the
Minnesota Department of Commerce from 1982-1987 [the Hatch Study], also
tends to call into question the basis for cries of any insurance crisis; if claim
frequency  and  severity  did  not  change  signiﬁcantly  in  those  years,  and  if  in
those same six years only one-half of one percent of all medical malpractice
plaintiffs  were  awarded  any  damages,  why  then  did  physicians’  insurance
premiums triple in that same time period?

The  Hatch  Study  concluded  that  “despite  unchanging  claim  frequency  and

I  INTRODUCTION

Even  after  adjudicating  the  merits  of  the  plaintiff’s  tort  claim  and
determining the amount of damages, the court may not yet be ready
to  close  the  ﬁle  and  send  it  to  storage.  Many  modern  cases  involve
multiple  alleged  tortfeasors  that  played  a  role  in  bringing  about  the
plaintiff’s harm. We have already seen a number of instances of such
claims.  A  few  examples  that  come  to  mind  would  include  two  boys
ﬁring  paper  clips  at  another  scout’s  eye  during  a  pack  meeting
(McQuiggan  v.  Boy  Scouts  of  America),  a  doctor  and  a  hospital
allowing  a  cancer  patient  to  be  over-radiated  (Kern  v.  St.  Joseph
Hospital), and a rescuer being hit in a secondary collision (McCoy v.
American  Suzuki  Motor  Corp.).  This  increased  frequency  of  cases
involving  multiple  tortfeasors  is  partly  due  to  greater  complexity  in
our  lives  that  leave  us  interacting  with  greater  numbers  of  people  in
varying ways and capacities. For example, in the nineteenth century, a
vehicular  accident  was  likely  to  involve  two  (slow  moving)  wagons.
On  today’s  congested,  speedy  highways,  one  gaffe  often  involves
many vehicles and drivers. A driver may have been inattentive to his
steering and veered into the path of another car. That other car may
not have responded in a timely fashion, causing a collision that spilled
over  to  the  next  lane  where  an  innocent  motorist  was  hit.  The
possibilities for multi-tortfeasor scenarios are endless.

concept  of  conceptual  indivisibility — that  is,  there  is  no  way  to
allocate  the  one  set  of  harms  based  upon  notions  of  causation
because  all  of  the  misconduct  was  a  necessary  link  in  the  chain  of
causation that led to the one accident  with  its  one  set  of  losses.  By
contrast,  if  one  motorist  is  involved  in  two  different  accidents  that
occur  at  different  times  and  places  and  each  accident  results  in
separately  identiﬁable  damage  to  the  car  (e.g.,  one  rear-ender  hurts

door), obviously each tortfeasing driver will be separately liable for the

We  have  already  seen  some  of  these  multiple  tortfeasor
scenarios.  One  as-yet  unexplored  issue  that  has  been  lurking  in  the
darkened  corners  of  our  prior  coverage  involves  the  actual  entry  of
judgment  in  these  multiple  tortfeasor  scenarios.  What  if  there  are
multiple  defendants  found  liable  to  the  plaintiff?  How  much  of  the
plaintiff’s actual damages does each defendant have to pay? Further,
if  the  plaintiff  has  settled  with  one  tortfeasor  but  gone  to  trial  and
won  against  another  joint  tortfeasor,  does  the  plaintiff  get  to  collect

more  than  100  percent  of  her  damages?  If  apportionment  of
responsibility  is  called  for,  how  should  this  be  conducted  and  who
should be included in the apportionment analysis? To what extent are
employers subject to the entry of judgment against them based upon
the  misconduct  of  someone  under  their  control?  What  is  the  result
when  tortfeasors  are  not  acting  independently  but  actually  working
together in bringing about the plaintiff’s harm?

These  are  far  from  clerical  or  administrative  issues.  Rather,
answering  these  remaining  questions  involves  incredible  complexity
and  important  policy  debates  that  are  not  academic.  Until  they  are
addressed, a trial court often cannot enter the ﬁnal judgment needed
to ﬁnish the process of civil adjudication of a tort claim. And looking
even further back, the resolution of these issues impacts the strategy
decisions made by a claimant’s attorney in determining who to name
as  a  defendant  in  a  lawsuit.  Confronting  these  difﬁcult  issues  and
mastering them are the audacious goals of this chapter.

In Practice
The U.S. Supreme Court has
held that the procedural joinder
rules (i.e., Rules 19 and 20) do
not require a plaintiff to sue all
tortfeasors in order to recover a
claim for all her damages:

This
articulated — any
tortfeasor
found to have been a cause of
the  plaintiff’s  harm  could  be
liable  to  the  plaintiff  for  all  of
the compensable damages. The procedural rules have never required
a  plaintiff  to  sue  all  possible  tortfeasors  in  one  action.  A  plaintiff
could, for any reason, decide to ﬁle suit against only one or some of
the  joint  tortfeasors  that  caused  the  plaintiff’s  singular  harm.  Under
this  doctrine,  if  one  of  the  tortfeasors  has  inadequate  assets  to  pay
damages, the plaintiff can simply recover the entirety of her judgment
for actual damages from another tortfeasor with deeper pockets. It is
referred to as “joint and several” because, as a group, the tortfeasors
are  jointly  responsible  and  liable  to  the  plaintiff  and,  individually  (or
severally),  any  of  the  tortfeasors  can  be  liable  to  the  plaintiff  for  the
entire amount of damages.

Two  interesting  scenarios  developed  under  this  doctrine.  First,
how  should  the  loss  be  spread  as  between  the  tortfeasors?  If  the
plaintiff  recovers  all  of  her  damages  from  only  one  of  the  joint
tortfeasors,  what  recourse  does  that  defendant  have  to  seek
reimbursement  (known  as  contribution)  from  the  other
joint
tortfeasors? Second, what is the effect under joint and several liability
when  the  plaintiff  has  already  reached  a  pretrial  settlement  for  a
portion  of  the  plaintiff’s  damages  with  one  of  the  joint  tortfeasors?
May the plaintiff still recover 100 percent of her demonstrated losses
from
tortfeasors?  Concern  with
overcompensating  victims  led  joint  and  several  liability  courts  to
create the concept of a settlement credit to avoid such result.

The  following  case  illustrates  the  common  law  operation  of  joint
and  several  liability  as  well  as  courts’  recognition  of  the  right  of
contribution and analysis of how such a claim should be valued.

SITZES v. ANCHOR MOTOR FREIGHT, INC.
289 S.E.2d 679 (W. Va. 1982)

      , J.

We  have  accepted  [a]  certain  certiﬁed  question  from  the  United
States  District  Court  for  the  Southern  District  of  West  Virginia.
Generally,  we  are  asked  to  state  what  effect  our  adoption  of
comparative  negligence  .  .  .  has  upon  .  .  .  the  rules  of  contribution
among joint tortfeasors.

The facts of the case have been presented to us as follows:

Plaintiffs in this action, Arnold L. Sitzes and Edward L. Rucks, are administrators
of  the  estate  of  Patricia  Ann  Roberson.  Mrs.  Roberson  was  killed  in  an
automobile accident on January 19, 1977. At the time, she was a passenger in a
pick-up truck driven by her husband, James R. Roberson, which collided with a
motor  truck  driven  by  Oswald  R.  Carter,  an  agent  and  employee  of  the

defendant Anchor Motor Freight, Inc. Mrs. Roberson is survived by her husband
and her son, Joseph Eugene Roberson.

Plaintiffs  commenced  this  action  against  the  defendant  on  November  23,
leave  of  court,  defendant  ﬁled  a  third-party  complaint  for
1977.  With
contribution against Mr. Roberson on February 12, 1980. This court, perceiving
a potential conflict between West Virginia’s normal rules of contribution (which
would  apportion  damages  equally  among  joint  tortfeasors)  and  the  state’s
newly-adopted rule of comparative negligence (which requires a jury to “assign
the  proportion  or  degree  of  this  total  negligence  among  the  various  parties,”
Bradley v. Appalachian Power, 163 W. Va. 332, 256 S.E.2d 879, 885 (1979), and
which denies recovery to a plaintiff whose negligence equals or exceeds 50% of
the  combined  negligence  of  the  parties  to  the  accident),  instructed  the  jury  to
assign percentages of fault to the third-party plaintiff and third-party defendant
if it found that both had been negligent. Plaintiffs’ decedent was not negligent,
and was therefore excluded from the apportioning.

On March 31, 1981, the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs and against

the defendants and assessed plaintiffs’ damages in the amount of $100,000.

On the third-party claim, the jury found both the third-party plaintiff and the
third-party  defendant  negligent,  and  found  that  the  degree  of  negligence
attributable  to  Anchor  Motor  Freight  was  70%  and  the  degree  attributable  to
James R. Roberson was 30%.

Thus, in summary, the jury concluded that the accident was caused by the
combined  negligence  of  the  defendant  (70%  negligent)  and  the  third-party
defendant (30% negligent); that the amount of damages was $100,000.

This jurisdiction is committed to the concept of joint and several
liability  among  tortfeasors.  A  plaintiff  may  elect  to  sue  any  or  all  of
those  responsible  for  his  injuries  and  collect  his  damages  from
whomever is able to pay, irrespective of their percentage of fault. Our
adoption of a modiﬁed rule for contributory negligence in Bradley did
not change our adherence to joint and several liability:

Neither our comparative negligence rule nor Haynes [v. City of Nitro, 240 S.E.2d
544 (W. Va. 1977)] is designed to alter our basic law which provides for joint and
several liability among joint tortfeasors after judgment. Most courts which have
considered  the  question  after  either  a  statutory  or  judicial  adoption  of  some
form of comparative negligence have held that the plaintiff can sue one or more

joint tortfeasors, and if more than one is sued and a joint judgment is obtained,
he may collect the entire amount from any one of the defendants.

It  is  clear  from  the  foregoing  quotation  that  the  concept  of  joint
and  several  liability  after  judgment  relates  primarily  to  the  liability  of
all of the joint tortfeasors to the plaintiff. We decline here, as we did in
Bradley,  to  alter  our  rule  permitting  joint  and  several  liability  as
against  joint  tortfeasors  after  judgment.  This  concept  of  joint  and
several  liability  after  judgment  runs  throughout  other  areas  of  our
judgment law.9

In the present case, the trial court permitted the jury to apportion
the  two  joint  tortfeasors.  The  jury  concluded  that  the  defendant,
Anchor  was  70%  at  fault  while  the  third-party  defendant,  Mr.
Roberson,  was  found  to  be  30%  at  fault.10  The  certiﬁed  question
inherently  demands  consideration  of  whether  we  recognized  that
primary  fault  or  negligence  should  be  apportioned  among  joint
tortfeasors in accordance with their degrees of fault.

The basic purpose of the joint and several liability rule is to permit
the  injured  plaintiff  to  select  and  collect  the  full  amount  of  his
damages  against  one  or  more  joint  tortfeasors.  This  rule  however
need  not  preclude  a  right  of  comparative  contribution  between  the
joint  tortfeasors  inter se.  The  purpose  of  this  latter  rule  is  to  require
the joint tortfeasors to share in contribution based upon the degree of
fault  that  each  has  contributed  to  the  accident.  There  is  a  deﬁnite
trend  in  the  ﬁeld  of  tort  law  toward  allocation  of  judgmental  liability
between  the  joint  tortfeasors  inter  se.  It  is  thought  to  be  fairer  to
require them to respond in damages based on their degrees of fault.

Historically,  at  common  law,  there  was  no  right  of  contribution
between  joint  tortfeasors  on  the  theory  that  the  law  should  not  aid
wrongdoers.  The  historic  development  of  this  point  is  contained  in
Northwest  Airlines,  Inc.  v.  Transport  Workers  Union  of  American,
AFL-CIO, et al.,  451  U.S.  77  (1981),  where  Justice  Stevens  states  in
note 17:

Thirty-nine States and the District of Columbia recognize to some extent a right
to  contribution  among  joint  tortfeasors.  In  10  jurisdictions,  the  common-law
rule was initially changed by judicial action.

The right of contribution developed because it was thought unfair to
have one of several joint tortfeasors pay the entire judgment and not
be  able  to  obtain  contribution  from  any  of  his  fellow  wrongdoers.  It
would seem proper social policy that a wrongdoer should not escape
his  liability  on  the  fortuitous  event  that  another  paid  the  entire  joint
judgment.

In this State since 1872, by virtue of W. Va. Code, 55-7-13, we have
permitted a right of contribution between joint tortfeasors. Thus, our
cases . . . have utilized the phrases “joint and several liability” and the
“right of contribution” if the judgment debtor pays more than his pro

who were liable on the judgment.

Procedure still reflect the
common law’s willingness to let
the plaintiff be the master of her
own lawsuit:

rule

Comparative  contribution  makes

the  right  of  contribution
equitable  to  the  degree  of  fault  between  each  tortfeasor.  This  is  in
keeping  with  the  trend  toward  reducing  substantial  artiﬁciality  or
unfairness  in  tort  law.  A  number  of  states  by  statute  now  base
contribution on relative fault.

Over the last twenty years there has been a noticeable trend in our

tort decisions to ameliorate the rigidity of many common law rules.

We  have  attempted  not  only  substantively  but  procedurally  to
fashion a more equitable allocation of fault and its attendant liability
in our tort law. Our seminal decision of Haynes v. City of Nitro, supra,
recognized  the  right  of  a  joint  tortfeasor  to  bring  in  a  fellow  joint
tortfeasor  by  way  of  a  third-party  complaint  under  Rule  14  of  our
Rules of Civil Procedure. The purpose of this rule was to modify the
strict  common  law  principle  that  prevented  a  right  of  contribution
among  joint  tortfeasors  before  judgment.  The  old  common  law  rule
enabled  the  plaintiff  to  sue  one  of  several  joint  tortfeasors  and  hold
him responsible for the entire damage claim, even though other joint
tortfeasors had contributed to the damages. Because the defendant
had no right prior to Haynes, supra, to bring in by way of contribution
another joint tortfeasor, he became liable for the entire judgment.

In the present case, the third-party defendant, Roberson, was not
a co-defendant. Thus, insofar as the plaintiff is concerned, his entire
judgment  of  $100,000  is  collectible  only  against  the  defendant,
Anchor.  On  the  other  hand,  in  the  third-party  action  ﬁled  by  Anchor
against Roberson, the third-party defendant, was found to be 30% at
fault. This means that Anchor is entitled to collect $30,000 from the
third-party defendant Roberson.

The  certiﬁed  question  having  been  answered,  this  case

is

dismissed from the docket.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Joint  and  Several  Liability.   While  joint  and  several  liability  was
universally  accepted  at  common  law,  many  courts  and  legislatures
have  abandoned  it  in  recent  decades  either  in  whole  or  at  times.
Some  courts  continue  to  retain  the  doctrine  even  after  a  switch  to
comparative fault. In Sitzes, the court declares its continued fealty to
the doctrine that seeks to maximize the plaintiff’s ability to recover all
of  her  compensable  damages.  In  the  next  section  we  will  see  other
courts take a different view.

2.  One  Satisfaction  Rule.   A  concern  that  occurs  to  many  law
students ﬁrst encountering the doctrine of joint and several liability is
the possibility of the plaintiff recovering more than 100 percent of its
damages.  If  the  plaintiff  is  permitted  to  sue  one  tortfeasor  after
another  in  separate  actions  for  the  same  harm,  what  prevents  a
plaintiff from receiving redundant awards of damages and realizing a
windfall? The answer is the one satisfaction rule, which declares that
a plaintiff who has received full satisfaction of a tort judgment for one
harm  cannot  continue  to  recover  against  other  joint  tortfeasors  for
that same harm:

It is elementary that one who has been injured by the joint wrong
of  several  parties  may  recover  his  damages  against  either  or  all;

but, although there may be several suits and recoveries, there can
be but one satisfaction. The reason of the rule is that while  there
may  be  many  perpetrators  of  a  wrongful  act,  each  of  whom  is
separately liable, yet the act and its consequences are indivisible,
and the injured person is, therefore, limited to a single satisfaction.

Bundt  v.  Embro,  265  N.Y.S.2d  872,  875  (N.Y.  Sup.  1965)  (emphasis
added).  If  the  plaintiff  recovers  a  judgment  in  the  ﬁrst  suit  but  is
unhappy  with  the  jury’s  ﬁnding  of  damages  and  the  subsequent
judgment, plaintiff cannot seek to recover more by ﬁling a second suit
against  another  tortfeasor  for  the  same  harm  on  the  hope  of
convincing a second jury to award greater damages. The one-bite-at-
the-apple civil procedure doctrine of collateral estoppel  will  preclude
the plaintiff from having this fact issue determined a second time in
order to improve the outcome. See e.g., Nielson v. Spanaway General
Medical Clinic, Inc., 956 P.2d 312 (Wash. 1998).

3.  Contribution  as  a  Necessary  Byproduct.   While  some  courts
traditionally  refused  to  permit  one  tortfeasor  to  sue  another  for
contribution  because  of  the  view  that  the  court  should  not  lend  its
hand  to  a  wrongdoer,  modern  courts  retaining  joint  and  several
liability have come to embrace contribution as an appropriate method
to  assure  that  all  wrongdoers  feel  the  adverse  consequences  for
causing  a  harm.  Thus,  contribution  assures  that  deterrence  is
provided  for  all  tortfeasors  who  contributed  to  causing  a  singular
harm. It is also considered more fair to the defendant who originally
paid  all  of  the  plaintiff’s  damages.  Most  courts,  therefore,  see
contribution  as  a  necessary  corollary  to  the  doctrine  of  joint  and
several liability. It is available to any defendant who has been forced
to pay for more than its own share of the harm. It permits an action
for partial reimbursement against other joint tortfeasors. The plaintiff
in  the  main  suit  may  have  sued  these  other  tortfeasors,  but  the
plaintiff chose to enforce the judgment against another defendant. Or
the  plaintiff  may  have  never  bothered  to  sue  all  of  the  joint

tortfeasors. If neither the plaintiff nor the defendant (through a third-
party action) has brought the contribution defendant into the original
suit, a subsequent suit for contribution will be necessary. In that new
lawsuit, the ﬁndings of the original jury (including any apportionment
ﬁndings) will not be binding on the contribution defendant because it
has not yet had its day in court and due process demands a new fact
ﬁnding. Further, courts have held that the statute of limitations on a
contribution  claim  does  not  begin  to  run  until  after  the  entry  of
judgment  against  the  original  defendant.  See,  e.g.,  Cooper  v.
Philadelphia  Dairy  Products  Co.,  112  A.2d  308,  309-310  (N.J.  Super.
1955)  (the  cause  of  action  owned  by  the  victim  is  distinct  from  the
cause  of  action  for  contribution  arising  out  of  the  duty  of  the  joint
tortfeasor to reimburse the original defendant).

Principles

Contribution assures that
deterrence is provided for all
tortfeasors who contributed to
causing a singular harm.

principles  behind  the  one  satisfaction  rule.  To  avoid  all  of  this

III  SEVERAL LIABILITY

Most courts (and legislatures) came to view the transition from the all
or nothing world of contributory negligence to the modern scheme of
comparative  fault  as  a  catalyst  for  reconsidering  joint  and  several
liability. At the opposite end of the spectrum was the new doctrine of
several liability, by which a tortfeasor only is liable for his share of the
fault  that  led  to  the  plaintiff’s  harm.  This  doctrine  shifts  the  risk  of
insolvency  from  the  tortfeasors  to  the  victim.  It  also  has  created
some of its own interesting dilemmas, including whether and how to
apportion  fault  between  a  negligent  and  an  intentional  tortfeasor  as
well  as  the  question  of  how  to  apportion  responsibility  in  scenarios
where some of the tortfeasors are incapable of being sued for legal or
practical reasons.

A. Rejection of Joint and Several Liability in Favor of

Several Liability

Despite  the  view  of  some  courts,  as  illustrated  by  Sitzes,  that  joint
and  several  liability  should  be  retained,  other  courts  have  struggled
with  the  apparent  disharmony  between  a  comparative  fault  system
— whereby a negligent plaintiff is permitted to recover a portion of her
damages — and  the  doctrine  of  joint  and  several  liability.  This  led
some  courts  to  reject  joint  and  several  liability  and  to  adopt  instead
the doctrine of several liability — in which a tortfeasor is only liable for
his  own  percentage  of  fault.  In  Chapter  7,  Afﬁrmative  Defenses,  we
previously  explored  a  portion  of  the  Tennessee  Supreme  Court’s
decision  in  McIntyre  v.  Balentine,  in  which  that  court  judicially
abandoned contributory negligence in favor of comparative fault. The
Balentine  court  believed
issues  of  contributory
negligence/comparative  fault  and  joint  and  several  liability  were

that

the

necessarily  linked;  in  another  portion  of  its  opinion,  Balentine  also
abandoned joint and several liability, for the reasons set forth below.

McINTYRE v. BALENTINE
833 S.W.2d 52 (Tenn. 1992)

       , J.

[In a personal injury action arising out of collision on Highway 69
in which both the plaintiff and defendant drivers had been consuming
alcohol,  the  plaintiff  pulled  out  in  front  of  the  defendant,  and  the
defendant failed to stop or avert the accident. The court rejected the
“all or nothing” rule of contributory negligence. In its place, the court
adopted the 49 percent modiﬁed comparative fault rule.]

We  recognize  that  today’s  decision  affects  numerous

legal
principles  surrounding  tort  litigation.  For  the  most  part,  harmonizing
these  principles  with  comparative  fault  must  await  another  day.
However,  we  feel  compelled  to  provide  some  guidance  to  the  trial
courts charged with implementing this new system.

First, and most obviously, the new rule makes the doctrine of last
clear chance obsolete. [This was discussed in Chapter 7 as a type of
common law mitigation doctrine to soften some of the harshness of
contributory  negligence.]  The  circumstances  formerly  taken  into
account  by  [that  doctrine]  will  henceforth  be  addressed  when
assessing relative degrees of fault.

Second, in cases of multiple tortfeasors, plaintiff will be entitled to
recover so long as plaintiff’s fault is less than the combined fault of all
tortfeasors. [This holding is the same as that of the court in Beaudoin
v. Texaco,  in  Chapter  7,  rejecting  the  “Wisconsin  rule”  in  favor  of  the
unit rule in a modiﬁed comparative fault system.]

Third,  today’s  holding  renders  the  doctrine  of  joint  and  several
liability  obsolete.  Our  adoption  of  comparative  fault  is  due  largely  to

considerations  of  fairness:  the  contributory  negligence  doctrine
unjustly  allowed  the  entire  loss  to  be  borne  by  a  negligent  plaintiff,
notwithstanding that the plaintiff’s fault was minor in comparison to
defendant’s.  Having  thus  adopted  a  rule  more  closely  linking  liability
and fault, it would be inconsistent to simultaneously retain a rule, joint
and  several  liability,  which  may  fortuitously  impose  a  degree  of
liability that is out of all proportion to fault.7

Further,  because  a  particular  defendant  will  henceforth  be  liable
only  for  the  percentage  of  a  plaintiff’s  damages  occasioned  by  that
defendant’s negligence, situations where a defendant has paid more
than  his  “share”  of  a  judgment  will  no  longer  arise,  and  therefore
[there will no longer be a general need for any right to contribution].

Fourth, fairness and efﬁciency require that defendants called upon
to  answer  allegations  in  negligence  be  permitted  to  allege,  as  an
afﬁrmative  defense,  that  a  nonparty  caused  or  contributed  to  the
injury or damage for which recovery is sought. In cases where such a
defense  is  raised,  the  trial  court  shall  instruct  the  jury  to  assign  this
nonparty  the  percentage  of  the  total  negligence  for  which  he  is
responsible.  However,  in  order  for  a  plaintiff  to  recover  a  judgment
against such additional person, the plaintiff must have made a timely
amendment  to  his  complaint  and  caused  process  to  be  served  on
such  additional  person.  Thereafter,  the  additional  party  will  be
required to answer the amended complaint. The procedures shall be
in accordance with the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Rationale  for  Rejection  of  Joint  and  Several  Liability.   Most
courts  reconsidering  the  doctrine  of  joint  and  several  liability  after
their  jurisdiction’s  abandonment  of  contributory  negligence  have
tended  to  likewise  embrace  several  liability.  A  primary  conceptual
reason  for  this  is  the  perceived  inconsistency  between  rejecting  the

all-or-nothing doctrine of contributory negligence and retaining the all-
or-nothing  apportionment  doctrine  of  joint  and  several  liability.  Both
comparative fault and several liability illustrate the prevailing modern
view that one’s rights and responsibilities in a tort suit should reflect
the actual extent to which one was at fault and nothing more. Rather
than seeing litigants wearing either white or black hats, these cases
tend  to  see  the  tort  world  in  various  shades  of  gray.  Further,  many
jurisdictions  have  embraced  several  liability  as  a  type  of  tort  reform
based  upon  the  belief  that  it  is  simply  unfair  to  hold  a  tortfeasor
accountable
for  all  damages,  despite  being
apportioned as little as one percent of the responsibility. Advocates of
several liability see it as custom-tailored justice rather than the rough
and harsh justice doled out by joint and several liability.

2.  When  the  Choice  Matters.   Given  the  right  of  contribution
available to a tortfeasor under joint and several liability who has paid
for more than his own share of the harm, why is the choice between
joint  and  several  liability  versus  several  liability  so  hotly  debated?
Either way, the plaintiff can receive full compensation and a tortfeasor
will ultimately only be out-of-pocket to the extent of his own share of
fault.  The  choice  ultimately  matters  in  instances  where  some  of  the
tortfeasors  are  either  insolvent  or  not  amenable  to  a  tort  suit  and
entry  of  judgment.  In  this  scenario,  the  choice  between  the  two
systems reflects a value judgment by the state as to whether the risk
of  such  insolvency  should  be  borne  by  the  victim  or  by  another
tortfeasor. Under the common law where the victim was necessarily
blameless,  the  decision  to  impose  this  risk  upon  the  tortfeasor
seemed obvious. Under modern comparative fault systems, however,
the  issue  is  not  always  quite  as  clear  or  compelling.  But  make  no
mistake:  Whether  a  jurisdiction  retains  joint  and  several  liability  or
adopts  several  liability  in  its  stead,  it  is  making  a  values-based
decision  as  to  whether  to  favor  the  victim  or  the  tortfeasor  in
allocating the risk of insolvency.

3.  Several  Liability  Negates  Contribution  and  Credits
Settlement.  Because a tortfeasor in a several liability system is only
paying  for  his  own  share  of  the  harm  (a  simple  calculation  of  the
tortfeasor’s  percentage  of  fault  multiplied  by  the  actual  damages),
logically  there  can  be  no  right  of  contribution — in  such  a  system  a
tortfeasor  never  pays  more  than  his  own  share.  See,  e.g.,  Kottler  v.
Washington,  963  P.2d  834  (Wash.  1998)  (no  contribution  claim
against  settling  defendants  who  settled  their  own  proportionate
shares  of
liability,  remaining
defendant  would  only  be  paying  for  his  own  personal  share  of
liability). Further, it would be illogical to grant a non-settling defendant
in  a  several  liability  scenario  any  right  to  a  credit  based  upon  the
distinct  potential  liability  of  a  settling  tortfeasor.  The  liability  of  each
toward  the  plaintiff  is  distinct,  like  a  separate  debt.  See,  e.g.,  Neil  v.
Kavena,  859  P.2d  203  (Ariz.  App.  1993)  (credit  not  applicable  if
settling  and  non-settling  parties  are  not  jointly  and  severally  liable).
Indeed, to reduce one judgment debtor’s several liability based upon a
credit  for  another  tortfeasor’s  settlement  would  only  penalize  a
plaintiff  for  compromising  her  claim  against  the  settling  tortfeasor.
Not only would this be illogical but it would practically render partial
settlements  extinct.  Courts  desire  to  encourage  settlements  rather
than  impede  them.  Thus,  it  is  now  clear  that  both  contribution  and
credits — while  an
liability
systems — are not recognized when several liability is being imposed
against a defendant.

B. Threshold Level Joint and Several Liability

Statutes

The  Balentine  case  involved  a  judicial  decision  to  abandon  the
common  law  rule  of  joint  and  several  liability.  In  many  states  this
decision  has  been  made  legislatively.  As  a  result  of  both  judicial
declaration and legislative enactment, the majority of jurisdictions no
longer  recognize  pure  joint  and  several  liability.  The  majority  of
jurisdictions  have  either  generally  embraced  several
liability  or
created a hybrid system as a sort of compromise on the issue. Some
statutes  create  a  default  rule  of  several  liability  but  still  permit  joint
and several liability when a particular tortfeasor’s level of apportioned
fault rises to a speciﬁc level. Others will impose several liability except
as to certain categories of cases or categories of actual damages, for
which  joint  and  several  liability  will  apply.  Consider  how  each  of  the
following statutes creates such a hybrid set of apportionment rules:

New Jersey Stat. §2A:15-53 (2009)

Except  as  provided

[regarding
environmental  tort  claims],  the  party  so  recovering  may
recover as follows:

in  subsection

(d)

(a)  The  full  amount  of  the  damages  from  any  party
determined  by  the  trier  of  fact  to  be  60%  or  more
responsible for the total damages.

(b) . . .
(c)  Only  that  percentage  of  the  damages  directly
attributable  to  that  party’s  negligence  or  fault  from  any
party  determined  by  the  trier  of  fact  to  be  less  than  60%
responsible for the total damages.

Texas Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §33.013 (2003)

(a) Except as provided in Subsection (b), a liable defendant
is liable to a claimant only for the percentage of the damages
found by the trier of fact equal to that defendant’s percentage
of  responsibility  with  respect  to  the  personal  injury,  property
damage,  death,  or  other  harm  for  which  the  damages  are
allowed.

(b)  Notwithstanding  Subsection  (a),  each  liable  defendant
is,  in  addition  to  his  liability  under  Subsection  (a),  jointly  and
severally  liable  for  the  damages  recoverable  by  the  claimant
under Section 33.012 with respect to a cause of action if:

(1)  the  percentage  of  responsibility  attributed  to  the
defendant with respect to a cause of action is greater than
50 percent.

Hawaii Rev. Stat. §663-10.9 (1995)

Joint  and  several  liability  for  joint  tortfeasors  .  .  .  is

abolished except in the following circumstances:

(1) For the recovery of economic damages against joint

tortfeasors in actions involving injury or death to persons;

(2)  For  the  recovery  of  economic  and  noneconomic

damages against joint tortfeasors in actions involving:

a. Intentional torts;
b. Torts relating to environmental pollution;
c. Toxic and asbestos-related torts;
d. Torts relating to aircraft accidents;
e. Strict and products liability torts.
f. Torts relating to motor vehicle accidents . . . ;

tortfeasors whose individual degree of negligence is found
to be twenty-ﬁve percent or more. . . .

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Problems.  In each of the following scenarios, analyze whether
joint and several liability would exist under each of the three statutes
set  forth  above.  How  should  the  trial  court  enter  judgment?  Is  there
any other information the court might require in order to make these
decisions?

A.  Trespass  claim  arising  out  of  ﬁre  accidentally  set  by  four
defendant  trespassers  on  plaintiff’s  business  property  late  at
night.  Jury  apportions  25  percent  fault  to  each  of  the  four
defendants with damages based on diminished market value of
property of $100,000.

B. Plaintiff hurt when a screw on a medical implant device comes
implant
loose  after  surgery.  Plaintiff  sues  surgeon  and
manufacturer. Jury ﬁnds the defective implant manufacturer to
be 50 percent at fault, the doctor 30 percent at fault, and plaintiff
20 percent at fault. Plaintiff’s special damages are $50,000, and
her general damages are $50,000.

C. Plaintiff pedestrian is hit crossing a street with the right of way
by  two  drivers  approaching  the  intersection  from  opposite
directions,  each  of  whom  ignored  the  red  light  and  struck  the
plaintiff. The jury ﬁnds the plaintiff’s pain and suffering damages
to be $1,000,000 and economic losses to be $250,000. The jury
apportions the fault equally between the two drivers.

2.  Legislative  Values.   As  you  consider  each  of  the  following
examples  of  legislative  reform  of  the  common  law  doctrine  of  joint
and several liability, consider what value statements are reflected by
the  particular  reform.  When  a  state  switches  generally  to  several
liability,  what  value  is  reflected  by  this  decision?  With  regard  to
Hawaii’s  statute,  what  seems  to  be  the  legislature’s  view  of  general
damages and of intentional tortfeasors? With regard to the threshold

levels  in  the  New  Jersey  and  Texas  statutes,  what  seems  to  be  the
legislators’ view regarding when it is appropriate to hold a tortfeasor
liable  for  all  of  the  plaintiff’s  harm?  Do  there  appear  to  be  common
values reflected by all three statutes or might their provisions simply
reflect legislative compromise?

“LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY . . .”

Texas PJC 4.3 Proportionate Responsibility

If  you  answered  “Yes”  to  Question[s]_______[applicable
liability question(s)] for more than one of those named below,
then answer the following question.

Assign  percentages  of  responsibility  only  to  those  you
found  caused  or  contributed  to  cause  the  [occurrence  or
injury]. The percentages you ﬁnd must total 100 percent. The
percentages  must  be  expressed  in  whole  numbers.  The
percentage  of  responsibility  attributable  to  any  one  is  not
necessarily  measured  by  the  number  of  acts  or  omissions
found.

C. Apportionment with Absent or Immune Actors

Several  important  interpretational  issues  have  arisen  in  several
liability jurisdictions. While it is clear that a jury should apportion the
fault of any of the tortfeasors that plaintiff might have sued or been
able  to  sue,  does  it  make  sense  to  allow  a  jury  to  consider
apportioning some of the fault to parties that cannot be sued? This is
an important issue because in a several liability jurisdiction, any fault
apportioned  to  an  absent  or  immune  party  necessarily  reduces  the
liability of a named defendant from whom the plaintiff might actually

receive  compensation.  Further,  plaintiff  obviously  does  not  receive  a
judgment  against  any  absent  party.  And  in  threshold  level  joint  and
several liability jurisdictions, reducing the fault of a named defendant
might  prevent  that  tortfeasor  from  reaching  the  threshold  level  of
fault necessary to trigger joint and several liability. Often this question
is  answered  by  resort  to  the  appropriate  statute  in  the  jurisdiction.
Below is one court’s attempt to divine legislative intent on this matter.

SULLIVAN v. SCOULAR GRAIN CO.
853 P.2d 877 (Utah 1993)

     , J.

This  case  comes  to  us  pursuant  to  rule  41  of  the  Utah  Rules  of
Appellate  Procedure  as  a  question  certiﬁed  from  the  United  States
District Court for the District of Utah. Two issues have been accepted
on certiﬁcation:

1. Under the Utah Comparative Fault Act, Utah Code Annot. §78-27-38, et seq.,
can  a  jury  apportion  the  fault  of  the  plaintiff’s  employers  that  caused  or
contributed  to  the  accident  although  said  employers  are  immune  from  suit
under Utah Workers’ Compensation Act, Utah Code Ann. §35-1-60, et seq.

2. Under the Utah Comparative Fault Act, Utah Code Ann. §78-27-38, et seq.,
can a jury apportion the fault of an individual or entity that has been dismissed
from  the  litigation  but  against  whom  it  is  claimed  that  they  have  caused  or
contributed to the accident.

We  hold  that  the  purpose  and  intent  of  the  Utah  Liability  Reform
Act require that a jury account for the relative proportion of fault of a
plaintiff’s  employer  that  may  have  caused  or  contributed  to  an
from  suit.
the  employer
accident,  even
Apportionment of fault does not of itself subject the employer to civil
liability.  Rather,  the  apportionment  process  merely  ensures  that  no
defendant is held liable to any claimant for an amount of damages in
excess of the percentage of fault attributable to that defendant.

is

We  also  hold  that  an  individual  or  entity  dismissed  from  a  case
pursuant  to  an  adjudication  on  the  merits  of  the  liability  issue  may
not be included in the apportionment. When a defendant is dismissed
due  to  a  determination  of  lack  of  fault  as  a  matter  of  law,  the
defendant’s  exclusion  from  apportionment  does  not  subject  the
remaining  defendants  to  liability  for  damages  in  excess  of  their
proportionate fault.

The  following  facts  are  taken  from  the  federal  district  court’s
certiﬁcation order. In October 1986, plaintiff Kenneth Sullivan lost his
left  arm  and  left  leg  in  an  accident  on  the  railroad  tracks  at  the
Freeport  Center  in  Clearﬁeld,  Utah.  At  the  time  of  his  injury,  Sullivan
was assigned to unload grain from rail cars into warehouses. He was
employed  by  Scoular  Grain  Company,  Freeport  Center  Associates,
and Scoular Grain Company of Utah (“the Scoular parties”).

the  exclusive

Sullivan ﬁled this action against the Scoular parties, Union Paciﬁc
Railroad Company, Denver & Rio Grande Western Railroad Company,
Oregon Short Line Railroad Company, Utah Power & Light Company,
Trackmobile, Inc., and G.W. Van Keppel Company. In 1989, the federal
district court found the Scoular parties immune from plaintiff’s claim
under
remedy  provision  of  Utah’s  Workers’
Compensation Law and dismissed them from the action. That court
also found that defendant Denver & Rio Grande Western Railroad had
no  legal  duty  to  Sullivan  and  dismissed  it  from  the  lawsuit.  The
in  the  case  are  Utah  Power  &  Light,
remaining  defendants
Trackmobile,  G.W.  Van  Keppel,  Union  Paciﬁc  Railroad,  and  Oregon
Short Line Railroad. A motion to dismiss Utah Power & Light for lack
of jurisdiction is pending at this time.

Defendant  Trackmobile  moved  to  have  the  jury  apportion  and
compare  the  fault  of  all  the  originally  named  defendants,  whether
dismissed  or  present  at  trial.  Plaintiff  opposed  this  motion,  claiming
that  only  the  fault  of  parties  who  are  defendants  at  trial  may  be
compared.

The  court’s  principal  duty  in  interpreting  statutes  is  to  determine
legislative  intent,  and  the  best  evidence  of  legislative  intent  is  the
plain  language  of  the  statute.  Jensen  v.  Intermountain  Health  Care,
Inc., 679 P.2d 903, 906 (Utah 1984).

Plaintiff argues that his former employers must be excluded from
the apportionment process because they are not “defendants” under
the Liability Reform Act’s deﬁnition. Section 68-3-11 of the Utah Code
states that “words and phrases . . . [which] are deﬁned by statute, are
to be construed according to such peculiar and appropriate meaning
or  deﬁnition.”  Under  section  78-27-39  of  the  Liability  Reform  Act,  a
jury may be instructed “to ﬁnd separate special verdicts determining
the  total  amount  of  damages  sustained  and  the  percentage  or
proportion  of  fault  attributable  to  each  person  seeking  recovery  and
to  each  defendant.”  Section  78-27-37(1)  deﬁnes  “defendant”  as  “any
person not immune from suit who is claimed to be liable because of
fault  to  any  person  seeking  recovery.”  (Emphasis  added.)  Therefore,
plaintiff  argues,  because  the  district  court  found  the  Scoular  parties
to  be  “immune  from  suit”  under  the  exclusive  remedy  provision  of
Utah Workers’ Compensation Act, Utah Code Ann. §35-1-60, they are
not defendants and are excluded from apportionment under the plain
language of the Act.

Excluding  plaintiff’s  employers  from  the  apportionment  process,
however, would directly conflict with the language of other sections of
the Act which require that no defendant be held liable for damages in
excess of its proportion of fault. The relevant portions of sections 78-
27-38 and -40 read as follows:

78-27-38. Comparative negligence. The fault of a person seeking recovery shall
not alone bar recovery by that person. He may recover from any defendant or
group  of  defendants  whose  fault  exceeds  his  own.  However,  no  defendant  is
liable  to  any  person  seeking  recovery  for  any  amount  in  excess  of  the
proportion of fault attributable to that defendant.

78-27-40. Amount of liability limited to proportion of fault–No contribution.
Subject to Section 78-27-38, the maximum amount for which a defendant may

be  liable  to  any  person  seeking  recovery  is  that  percentage  or  proportion  of
the damages equivalent to the percentage or proportion of fault attributed to
that defendant. No defendant is entitled to contribution from any other person.
(Emphasis added.)

If  the  Scoular  parties,  who  allegedly  contributed  to  the  accident,
included  on  the  special  verdict  form,  the  remaining
are  not
defendants  will  be  potentially  liable  to  plaintiff  for  an  amount  in
excess of their proportion of fault. For example, if the Scoular parties
were  90%  at  fault  and  the  defendants  remaining  in  the  action  were
10% at fault, the remaining defendants would be apportioned 100% of
any damages awarded even though they were only 10% at fault. Such
a  result  would  violate  the  plain  language  of  sections  78-27-38  and
-40.

Thus,  we  are  faced  with  two  arguably  contradictory  statutes
within the same article. Section 78-27-37 deﬁnes “defendant” in a way
inclusion  of  an  employer  from
that  appears  to  preclude  the
apportionment.  But  excluding  employers  from  apportionment  would
violate  the  mandate  of  section  78-27-40  that  no  defendant  be  held
liable  for  damages  greater  than  its  proportion  of  fault.  This  conflict
creates  an  ambiguity  that  requires  the  court  to  make  a  policy
inference as to the overall purpose and intent of the Act.

“When interpreting an ambiguous statute, we ﬁrst try to discover
the underlying intent of the legislature, guided by the purpose of the
statute  as  a  whole  and  the  legislative  history.”  Hansen  v.  Salt  Lake
County,  794  P.2d  838,  841  (Utah  1990)  (citations  omitted).  We  then
try  to  harmonize  ambiguous  provisions  accordingly.  Clover  v.
Snowbird Ski Resort, 808 P.2d 1037, 1045 (Utah 1991).

In the 1986 session of the Utah Legislature, Substitute Senate Bill
No.  64  proposed  that  a  jury  may  determine  the  “total  amount  of
damages  sustained  and  a  percentage  or  proportion  of  fault
attributable to each person seeking recovery, to each defendant, and
to  each  other  person  whose  fault  contributed  to  the  injury  or
damages.”  (Emphasis  added.)  Before  being  enacted,  the  bill  was

amended  by  deleting  the  part  underlined  above  and  inserting  the
word  “and”  before  “to  each  defendant.”  The  result  is  codiﬁed  at  Utah
Code Ann. §78-27-39:

The trial court may, and when requested by any party shall, direct the jury, if any,
to  ﬁnd  separate  special  verdicts  determining  the  total  amount  of  damages
sustained and the percentage or proportion of fault attributable to each person
seeking recovery and to each defendant.

Sullivan  argues  that  this  amendment  shows  that  the  legislature  did
not intend to include nonparties in the apportionment process.

Trackmobile  counters  that  the  reason  for  the  amendment  is  not
clear  and  argues  that,  by  contrast,  the  intent  of  the  comparative
negligence  statute  to  limit  a  defendant’s  liability  to  his  or  her
proportion  of  fault  is  clear.  That  purpose  is  to  ensure  that  “no
defendant is liable to any person seeking recovery for any amount in
excess of the proportion of fault attributable to that defendant.” Utah
Code Ann. §78-27-38.

46th  Leg.  1986,  General  Sess.,
Senate  Day  31,  Records  No.  63  (Feb.  12,  1986).  Second,  each
preliminary draft of Senate Bill 64 states in the title that the purpose
of  the  Act  was,  among  other  things,  “abolishing  joint  and  several
liability.”  If  the  jury  is  prevented  in  this  case  from  considering  the
relative  fault  of  the  Scoular  parties  in  the  apportionment  process,
Trackmobile and the other defendants will be held liable in the event
of a verdict for plaintiff, not only for their own proportionate share of
fault,  but  also  for  the  proportionate  share  of  fault  attributable  to  the
Scoular  parties.  Thus,  one  of  the  major  evils  of  joint  and  several
liability  would  result,  and  the  stated  purpose  of  the  legislature  in
abolishing it would be frustrated.

Any judicial or legislative decision concerning tort liability requires
a balancing of competing interests and a policy decision as to which
party  should  bear  the  risks  of  an  immune  or  insolvent  tort-feasor.
Prior to 1986, under joint and several liability, a tortfeasor bore the risk
of paying not only his or her share of the plaintiff’s damages, but also
the  shares  of  other  tortfeasors  who  were  impecunious  or  immune
from suit. The 1986 Utah Liability Reform Act shifted the risks caused

by impecunious or immune tort-feasors to the plaintiffs by abolishing
joint and several liability and contribution among tortfeasors.

Plaintiff  correctly  asserts  that  if  his  employer’s  actions  are
included in apportionment, his recovery may be signiﬁcantly reduced.
Plaintiff’s  recovery  from  nonemployer  defendants  would  be  reduced
directly  in  proportion  to  the  percentage  of  fault,  if  any,  the  jury
attributes to the employer.
On  the  other  hand,

in  Trackmobile’s  view,  fairness  to  the
defendants  requires  that  each  defendant  pay  only  its  proportionate
share  of  the  plaintiff’s  damages.  If  the  Scoular  parties  are  not
included  in  apportionment,  Trackmobile  and  the  other  defendants
would  be  liable  for  damages  in  excess  of  their  proportion  of  fault.
“There  is  nothing  inherently  fair  about  a  defendant  who  is  [for
example] 10% at fault paying 100% of the loss. . . .” Brown v. Keill, 224
Kan. 195, 580 P.2d 867, 874 (Kan. 1978).

General  comparative  negligence  theory  also  supports  the
inclusion  of  nonparty  employers  in  apportionment.  For  example,
according to Heft and Heft:

It is accepted practice to include all tortfeasors in the apportionment question.
This  includes  nonparties  who  may  be  unknown  tortfeasors,  phantom  drivers,
and  persons  alleged  to  be  negligent  but  not  liable  in  damages  to  the  injured
party  such  as  in  the  third  party  cases  arising  in  the  workmen’s  compensation
area. . . .

The  reason  for  such  rules  is  that  true  apportionment  cannot  be  achieved
unless  that  apportionment  includes  all  tortfeasors  guilty  of  causal  negligence
either causing or contributing to the occurrence in question, whether or not they
are parties to the case.

Carroll  R.  Heft  &  C.  James  Heft,  Comparative  Negligence  Manual,
§8.100,  at  14  (John  J.  Palmer  &  Stephen  M.  Flanagan  eds.,  rev.  ed.
1992) (footnote omitted). Thus, it is accepted practice for the jury to
apportion  the  comparative  fault  of  all  tortfeasors  when  comparative
negligence is at issue.

Based  on  the  foregoing  analysis,  our  answers  to  the  questions

certiﬁed from the federal court are as follows:

1. A jury may apportion the fault of employers under Utah Code Ann. §78-27-38
to -43 notwithstanding their immunity under Utah Code Ann. §35-1-60.

2.  A  jury  may  not  apportion  the  fault  of  a  party  that  has  been  dismissed

from the lawsuit pursuant to an adjudication on the merits of the liability issue.

DISSENT

       , Justice (Dissenting)

The majority opinion holds that an immune non-defendant should
be  included  in  the  apportionment  of  fault  to  defendants  under  the
Liability  Reform  Act.  I  submit  that  the  majority,  in  direct  deﬁance  of
the speciﬁc language of the Act and its legislative history, completely
reverses  the  intended  effect  of  the  Act  as  to  how  fault  should  be
apportioned when one of the parties whose negligence contributed to
the plaintiff’s injuries is immune from liability.

The majority rejects clear and consistent statutory language and
its compelling legislative history with the extraordinary argument that
“failing  to  include  immune  employers  in  the  apportionment  violates
the  main  purpose  of  the  Act  by  improperly  subjecting  the  remaining
defendants  to  liability  in  excess  of  their  proportion  of  fault.”  I  see
nothing  improper  in  the  legislative  scheme.  The  fact  is  that  it  is  for
the Legislature — not this Court — to decide how to deal with the fault
of  an  immune  party  in  a  multi-defendant  comparative  negligence
case.

While it is true that the Act abolishes joint and several liability, that
was not its sole purpose. The Act also provides the manner in which
fault  should  be  allocated  in  comparative  negligence  cases  and  how
the  universe  of  actionable  fault  should  be  apportioned  when  one
party is immune.

The damage the majority does to the legislative scheme and to a
plaintiff’s  rights  is  exacerbated  by  the  provision  in  the  Workers’

Compensation  Act  that  gives  an  employer  (whose  fault  may  have
contributed  to  a  plaintiff’s  injuries)  a  lien  against  the  plaintiff’s
damage  recovery  for  beneﬁts  paid  out  of  workers’  compensation.
Thus,  not  only  is  the  plaintiff  made  responsible  for  the  employer’s
proportionate share of fault, but he must also reimburse his employer
out  of  his  diminished  recovery  for  any  workers’  compensation
beneﬁts  received.  This  is  not  only  unjust  and  inequitable,  but  might
well be unconstitutional.

NOTE

1.  Statutory  Interpretation.   The  Utah  court  agrees  with  the
proposition  that  it  should  interpret  the  relevant  statute  according  to
its plain meaning. The court then declares two statutory provisions to
be in conflict and resorts to considering legislative goals and policies.
As  a  result,  it  concludes  that  excluding  an  immune  and  absent
tortfeasor  from  the  apportionment  would  result  in  the  named
defendant being held liable for more than its share of the fault. Do you
see  any  flaws  with  this  analysis?  As  the  dissent  alludes  to,  the
legislature  seems  to  be  addressing  two  separate  questions.  First,
how should the apportionment of fault be handled — by including all
who  may  have  been  at  fault,  even  if  they  cannot  be  sued?  Second,
once  the  jury  answers  the  apportionment  question,  what  are  the
effects  of  that  ﬁnding?  By  switching  to  several  liability,  which  of  the
two  questions  was  the  legislature  actually  addressing?  Was  there  a
separate  statute  that  addressed  the  ﬁrst  question?  What  did  it  say?
Nevertheless,  the  Utah  court  adopts  a  policy  for  a  several  liability
jurisdiction  that  most  other  several  liability  statutes  also  adopt  after
tort  reform — that  even  where  the  plaintiff  is  legally  precluded  from
suing someone (due to immunity) or is practically unable to sue (due
to  being  unknown  or  having  unknown  whereabouts),  statutes  today
are  often  interpreted  to  permit  the  jury  to  consider  the  fault  of  such

absent or immune actors, in addition to the named parties. Can you
explain  why  this  issue  does  not  really  matter  to  a  plaintiff  in  a  joint
and several liability jurisdiction?

D. Negligent Enabling

While the concept and application of several liability would appear to
liable
be  fairly  straightforward — a  tortfeasor  should  only  be
according to his own percentage of apportioned fault — many courts
have found some equitable exceptions to this rule. One such scenario
involves  the  concept  of  negligent  enabling,  where  one  defendant’s
duty of care is to prevent another from committing a subsequent tort.
For  example,  under  the  Tarasoff  rule  (covered  in  Chapter  6,  Special
Duty  Rules),  a  medical  doctor  sometimes  owes  an  obligation  to
prevent  her  patient  from  intentionally  causing  harm  to  third  parties.
Or consider the burglar alarm company who installs an alarm for the
purpose  of  helping  to  prevent  a  burglary  (the  Chapter  5  Emmittee
case). If the doctor or alarm company breaches their duty, should the
jury  be  permitted  to  apportion  the  fault  between  the  negligent  actor
and the intentional tortfeasor who was more directly responsible for
the plaintiff’s harm? This concept of negligent enabling is not limited
to  scenarios
intentional  tortfeasing.  For
example,  how  should  apportionment  in  a  several  liability  jurisdiction
work  when  a  car’s  owner  hands  over  the  keys  to  an  obviously
intoxicated  friend  who  carelessly  injures  a  pedestrian?  Consider  the
arguments  for  and  against  apportioning  fault  in  a  case  of  negligent
enabling.

TURNER v. JORDAN, M.D.
957 S.W.2d 815 (Tenn. 1997)

        , C.J.

We  granted  this  [to  decide]  whether  the  patient’s  intentional
conduct should be considered in determining comparative fault under
McIntyre v. Balentine, 833 S.W.2d 52 (Tenn. 1992).

The trial court determined that the psychiatrist in this case owed a
duty  of  care  to  the  nurse,  and  instructed  the  jury  to  consider  the
intentional  conduct  of  the  patient,  a  non-party,  in  determining  the
psychiatrist’s  comparative  fault.  The  jury  returned  a  verdict  for  the
nurse  in  the  amount  of  $1,186,000.  It  allocated  the  fault  as  100
percent  to  the  psychiatrist  and  zero  percent  to  the  patient.  The  trial
court  approved  the  jury’s  verdict  except  as  to  the  allocation  of  fault,
and granted a new trial. The Court of Appeals afﬁrmed, ﬁnding that a
duty  was  owed,  that  the  patient’s  intentional  conduct  should  be
compared  with  the  psychiatrist’s  negligence,  and  that  a  new  trial
should have been granted.

We  agree  that  the  psychiatrist  owed  a  duty  of  care  because  he
knew  or  should  have  known  that  his  patient  posed  an  unreasonable
risk of harm to a foreseeable, readily identiﬁable third party. We have
also  determined  that  the  trial  court  erred  in  instructing  the  jury  to
compare  the  patient’s  intentional  conduct  with  the  defendant’s
negligence  in  allocating  fault.  We,  however,  consider  the  error
harmless  because  the  jury  allocated  100  percent  of  the  fault  to  the
negligent defendant psychiatrist.

In March of 1993, the plaintiff, Emma Turner, a nurse at Hubbard
Hospital  in  Nashville,  was  attacked  and  severely  beaten  by  Tarry
Williams,  a  psychiatric  in-patient  at  the  hospital.  The  defendant,
Harold Jordan, M.D., was the attending psychiatrist.

Williams, who had been diagnosed as bipolar and manic, had been
a patient at Hubbard on ﬁve prior occasions; three of these times he
was found to be a danger to himself or others and was committed to
the  Middle  Tennessee  Mental  Health  Institute.  On  one  occasion,  in

April of 1990, Williams tried to attack Dr. Jordan with a table leg, but
hospital staff intervened.

On  March  4,  1993,  Williams  was  again  admitted  to  Hubbard’s
psychiatric  ward  and  examined  by  a  resident  physician.  Williams’s
history indicated that he had not taken his prescribed lithium, which
was  used  to  control  his  bipolar  disorder,  for  over  a  week.  Williams
also reported that he had met with “Gorbachev and Saddam Hussein”
and  that  he  had  “classiﬁed  information”  about  space  flights  and
nuclear science. The resident physician determined that Williams had
illogical  and  disorganized  thinking,  flight  of  ideas,  grandiosity,  and
delusional thinking. Lithium was prescribed, which takes ﬁve to seven
days to reach a therapeutic level.

The next day, on March 5, 1993, Dr. Jordan reviewed and approved
the resident physician’s orders. He and members of a treatment team
then  attempted  to  interview  Williams,  who  refused  to  cooperate  and
left  the  interview.  The  treatment  team  then  discussed  the  case  for
thirty to forty-ﬁve minutes, after which Dr. Jordan wrote:

This  patient  presents  no  behavior  or  clinical  evidence  suggesting  that  he  is
suicidal. He is aggressive, grandiose, intimidating, combative, and dangerous.
We will discharge him soon by allowing him to sign out AMA [Against Medical
Advice]. (Emphasis added.)

That  evening,  according  to  notes,  Williams,  although  quiet  and  non-
disruptive, had an “angry and hostile” affect. Around 11:30 p.m., after
requesting  a  cigarette  and  asking  the  nurse,  Emma  Turner,  about
being  discharged,  Williams  attacked  Turner,  inflicting  severe  head
injuries.

Thereafter, Emma Turner sued Dr. Jordan for medical negligence,
alleging he violated his duty to use reasonable care in the treatment
of his patient, which proximately caused her injuries and damages. At
trial,  Dr.  David  Sternberg,  a  psychiatric  expert  witness,  testiﬁed  that
Jordan’s failure to medicate, restrain, seclude or transfer Williams fell
below the standard of care for psychiatrists.

After the completion of the proof, the trial court instructed the jury
on the law of comparative fault, and it provided the jury with a verdict
form indicating it could allocate the fault, if any, between the alleged
negligence  of  Dr.  Jordan  and  the  alleged  intentional  conduct  of
patient Williams.2 The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs, Emma
and  Rufus  Turner,  allocating  100  percent  of  the  fault  to  defendant
Jordan.  The  trial  court  approved  all  of  the  jury’s  verdict  except  the
allocation  of  fault.  As  a  result,  it  granted  the  defendant’s  motion  for
new trial, but thereafter granted an interlocutory appeal. The Court of
Appeals afﬁrmed.

We  granted  the  appeal  to  consider  [among  other  things,  the]
comparison  of  fault  between  a  negligent  actor  and  an  intentional
actor.

[The court reafﬁrmed the legal duty in Tennessee, based upon the
doctor’s special relationship with a known dangerous patient to warn
others  foreseeably  endangered  by  the  patient,  citing  Bradshaw  v.
Daniel,  854  S.W.2d  865,  869  (Tenn.  1993)  covered  in  Chapter  6,
Special Duty Rules.]

Having determined that a duty of care exists in this case, we now
turn  to  the  issue  of  whether  the  defendant  psychiatrist’s  negligence
should have been compared with the intentional act of the non-party
patient  Williams  in  determining  the  extent  of  the  defendant’s  liability
to the plaintiffs.

The plaintiffs’ argument is twofold: a psychiatrist’s liability should
not  be  reduced  by  the  occurrence  of  a  foreseeable  act  he  had  the
duty to prevent; and as a matter of practice and policy, the negligent
act  of  a  tortfeasor  should  not  be  compared  to  the  intentional  act  of
another  tortfeasor.  The  defendant  maintains  that  comparison  is
proper  because  it  limits  his  liability  to  his  percentage  of  fault  in
causing harm to the plaintiff.

In  McIntyre  v.  Balentine,  we  adopted  a  modiﬁed  form  of
comparative  fault  under  which  a  plaintiff  whose  negligence  is  less

than that of a defendant may recover damages in an amount reduced
in  proportion  to  the  percentage  of  the  plaintiff’s  own  negligence.
Based on notions of fairness and justice, we abolished the outdated
doctrine of contributory negligence and yet stressed that “a particular
defendant  [is]  liable  only  for  the  percentage  of  a  plaintiff’s  damages
occasioned by that defendant’s negligence.” McIntyre,  833  S.W.2d  at
58.  Moreover,  to  provide  guidance  in  future  cases,  we  said  that  a
is  permitted  to  show  that  a  non-party  caused  or

contributed to the damages for which the plaintiff seeks recovery.

Other

Accordingly, in determining comparative fault, we have considered
cases in which the negligence of a tortfeasor was compared with the
negligence of other tortfeasors. Volz v. Ledes, 895 S.W.2d 677 (Tenn.
1995);  Bervoets  v.  Harde  Ralls  Pontiac-Olds,  Inc.,  891  S.W.2d  905
(Tenn. 1994). We have also considered the question of comparing the
negligence  of  a  defendant  with  the  strict  liability  of  third-party
defendants. Owens v. Truckstops of America, 915 S.W.2d at 431-33.
This  case  presents  our  ﬁrst  opportunity  to  determine  whether  the
negligent act of a defendant should be compared with the intentional
act of another in determining comparative fault.
jurisdictions  have  addressed  the

issue.  In  Veazey  v.
Elmwood  Plantation  Assoc.,  Ltd.,  650  So.  2d  712  (La.  1994),  the
plaintiff was sexually assaulted by an intruder and ﬁled a negligence
action  against  her  apartment  complex  for  failing  to  maintain
in  turn,
adequate  security;  the  defendant  apartment  complex,
defended  on  the  basis  of  the  intentional  act  by  the  assailant.  The
Louisiana  Supreme  Court  declined  to  compare  the  negligent  act  of
the  defendant  with  the  intentional  act  of  the  third  party  primarily
because it believed the negligent defendant should not be allowed to
reduce  its  fault  by  relying  on  an  intentional  act  it  had  the  duty  to
prevent.  It  also  expressed  several  public  policy  concerns  that
supported its conclusion: that comparison would reduce the plaintiff’s
recovery because juries will likely allocate most if not all fault to the
intentional  actor;  that  allocating  fault  to  the  intentional  party  may

reduce the incentive for the negligent actor to act with due care; and
that  comparison  is  impractical  because  intentional  and  negligent
torts  are  different  “not  only  in  degree  but  in  kind,  and  the  social
condemnation attached to it.” Id. at 719.

In another sexual assault case, Kansas State Bank & Trust Co. v.
Specialized Transportation Services, Inc., 249 Kan. 348, 819 P.2d 587
(Kan.  1991),  the  parents  of  a  child  who  was  sexually  assaulted  by  a
school  bus  driver  ﬁled  a  negligence  suit  against  the  school  and  the
bus  company.  The  Kansas  Supreme  Court  held  that  a  negligent
defendant should not be permitted to reduce its liability by intentional
acts they had a duty to prevent.

The Kansas Supreme Court followed its holding in Gould v. Taco
Bell,  722  P.2d  511  (Kan.  1986),  in  which  it  said  the  question  of
comparing  negligent  and  intentional  acts  depends  on  “the  nature  of
the duty owed in each instance.” In Gould, an assailant physically and
verbally  abused  the  plaintiff  in  a  restaurant  in  full  view  of  the
restaurant’s managers. The court held that the restaurant’s negligent
failure  to  maintain  security  under  the  facts  of  the  case  should  not
have been compared with the intentional conduct of the assailant.

A  similar  approach  was  suggested  by  the  New  Jersey  Supreme
Court in Blazovic v. Andrich, 590 A.2d 222 (N.J. 1991). There the jury
was  permitted  to  compare  the  negligence  of  a  restaurant  owner  in
failing  to  maintain  adequate  lighting  and  security  in  the  parking  lot
with  the  intentional  act  of  a  patron  who  attacked  the  plaintiff.  While
the court upheld the comparison, it recognized that apportionment of
fault  between  tortfeasors  may  be  precluded  “when  the  duty  of  one
encompassed  the  obligation  to  prevent  the  speciﬁc  misconduct  of
the  other.”  It  distinguished  the  facts  before  it  on  the  basis  that  “the
events  that  allegedly  took  place  in  the  parking  lot  neither  were
sufﬁciently  foreseeable  nor  bore  an  adequate  causal  relationship  to
[the  negligent  defendant’s]  alleged  fault  to  justify  the  imposition  on
[the defendant] of the entire responsibility for the resultant injury.” 590
A.2d at 233; compare Gould, 722 P.2d at 511-13.

Other  courts  take  a  different  view.  In  Reichert  v.  Atler,  875  P.2d
379  (N.M.  1992),  a  bar  patron  was  killed  when  assaulted  by  another
customer.  The  bar  owners  were  sued  for  failing  to  provide  adequate
security, and the bar owners relied on the intentional act of the third
party to reduce their liability. The court held that the bar owner may
reduce  his  liability  by  the  percentage  of  fault  attributable  to  a  third
party. They reasoned that this principle was most consistent with the
rejection  of  joint  and  several  liability  in  comparative  fault  cases  and
that each individual tortfeasor should be held responsible only for his
or  her  percentage  of  fault.  875  P.2d  at  381.  See  also  Barth  v.
Coleman, 878 P.2d 319 (N.M. 1994) (following Reichert).

Likewise,  in Weidenfeller v. Star &  Garter,  2  Cal.  Rptr.  2d  14  (Cal.
App.  4  Dist.  1991),  an  assault  victim  sued  a  bar  owner  for  failing  to
have adequate lighting and security. The jury allocated 75 percent of
the fault to the assailant. On appeal, the court said that the argument
that  negligent  acts  should  not  be  compared  with  intentional  acts
“violated the common sense notion that a more culpable party should
bear the ﬁnancial burden caused by its intentional act.”

Accordingly, the concern in cases that compare the negligence of
a defendant with the intentional act of a third party is not burdening
the  negligent  tortfeasor  with  liability  in  excess  of  his  or  her  fault;
conversely, the primary concern in those cases that do not compare
is that the plaintiff not be penalized by allowing the negligent party to
use the intentional act it had a duty to prevent to reduce its liability.

In  our  view,  the  conduct  of  a  negligent  defendant  should  not  be
compared  with  the  intentional  conduct  of  another  in  determining
comparative  fault  where  the  intentional  conduct  is  the  foreseeable
risk  created  by  the  negligent  tortfeasor.  As  other  courts  have
recognized,  comparison  presents  practical  difﬁculties  in  allocating
fault  between  negligent  and  intentional  acts,  because  negligent  and
intentional torts are different in degree, in kind, and in society’s view
of the relative culpability of each act. Such comparison also reduces
the negligent person’s incentive to comply with the applicable duty of

care.  Moreover,  while  a  negligent  defendant  may,  of  course,  raise  a
third  party’s  intentional  act  to  refute  elements  of  the  plaintiff’s
negligence claim such as duty and causation, fairness dictates that it
should  not  be  permitted  to  rely  upon  the  foreseeable  harm  it  had  a
duty to prevent so as to reduce its liability.

Principles
Negligent enabling is when one
breaches the duty speciﬁcally of
preventing the subsequent tort
from occurring.

Our  holding  also  comports
with  the  principles  underlying
McIntyre.  The  plaintiff  here
was not negligent. On the other
hand,
the  defendant  was
negligent,  and  his  breach  of
care
the  plaintiff’s
injuries.  Thus,  the  defendant’s
liability  to  the  plaintiff  is  linked
to  his  degree  of  fault  as  required  by McIntyre,  and  he  should  not  be
permitted  to  reduce  his  liability  by  relying  on  the  occurrence  of  the
foreseeable  risk  of  harm  he  had  a  duty  to  prevent.  As  one
commentator  has  written:  “the  McIntrye  principle  of  holding  the
tortfeasor liable for only his own percentage of fault is not abrogated
by  nonapportionment  when  the  nature  of  the  tortfeasor’s  breach  is
that  he  created  the  risk  of  the  second  tortfeasor’s  [intentional]  act.”

Accordingly,  we  conclude  that  the

determined  that  the  negligence  of  the  defendant  should  have  been
compared  with  the  intentional  act  of  the  defendant’s  patient.  In  this
case,  however,  the  error  was  harmless  in  that  the  jury  apportioned
100 percent of the fault to the defendant. Thus, we remand the case

1. Practical  and  Conceptual  Issues.   Do  you  see  why  the  difﬁcult
apportionment  issue  addressed  in  Turner  does  not  arise  in  the
context  of  joint  and  several  liability?  In  instances  where  joint  and
several  liability  applies,  there  is  no  need  to  apportion  between
tortfeasors

liable  to  the  plaintiff  for  the  entire  harm.
liability
jurisdictions, of course, any percentage apportioned to the intentional
tortfeasor  will  directly  reduce  the  liability  of  the  negligent  tortfeasor.
Some  courts  conclude  that  this  is  acceptable,  premised  upon  their
belief  that  this  was  the  desired  outcome  when  rejecting  joint  and
several  liability.  However,  the  majority  of  several  liability  courts  (like
the  above  opinion  in  Turner)  in  addressing  the  issue  of  negligent
enabling — where  the  duty  of  the  negligent  party  was  speciﬁcally  to
prevent  the  subsequent  tort — conclude  otherwise;  these  courts
believe that it makes no sense to create a duty only to lessen liability
upon its breach. This is practical policymaking. Often the intentional
tortfeasor is judgment proof or cannot be found. Reducing the liability
of the negligent enabler results in the plaintiff receiving only fractional
compensation.  Beyond  this,  the  majority  of  courts  also  stress  the
jury  to  apportion  between
conceptual  difﬁculty  of  asking  a
fundamentally  different
those  who
fault — between
types  of
accidentally injure another and those who strive to do so. At least one
court  has  suggested  a  creative  way  to  both  honor  the  explicit
language of its several liability statute and avoid the unsavory result
of denying full compensation to the plaintiff. In Bedford v. Moore, 166
S.W.3d  454  (Tex.  App. — Fort  Worth,  2005),  the  court  held  the  jury
should  ﬁrst  apportion  between  both  the  negligent  enabler  and  the
subsequent  tortfeasor,  but  that  the  negligent  actor  should  be  liable
for both percentages of fault as a joint liability. And if this combined
percentage exceeds a jurisdiction’s threshold level for imposing joint
and  several  liability,  then  the  negligent  enabler  would  face  joint  and
several liability. Whether the direct tortfeasor would also face several

or joint and several liability would depend upon how much fault was
apportioned to that tortfeasor.

2. Right of Contribution or Indemnity.  Near the end of the opinion
above,  the  court  in  footnote  nine  observed  that  it  had  no  need  to
decide  whether  there  should  be  contribution  or  indemnity  rights  by
the  negligent  enabler  against  the  intentional  tortfeasor.  Most  courts
in this scenario believe that a right to indemnity should exist because
the negligent enabler is being held jointly liable for both its percentage
of fault and that of the intentional tortfeasor. Further, to deny such a
right  would  be  to  allow  the  intentional  tortfeasor  to  escape  liability
altogether  in  favor  of  imposing  the  full  loss  at  the  feet  of  the  actor
less culpable. See, e.g., Degener v. Hall Contracting Corp., 27 S.W.3d
775 (Ky. 2000) (while negligent enablers were liable for the fault of the
subsequent  intentional  tortfeasors,  they  were  entitled  to  a  common
law  indemnity  action  for  the  fault  attributable  to  the  intentional
tortfeasors).

3. Problems.  Under the holding of Turner, would a court likely ﬁnd
the  initial  negligent  actor  responsible  for  all  of  the  victim’s  harm  in
each of the following scenarios?

A.  A  security  company  is  hired  by  a  nightclub  to  prevent  anyone
from  entering  the  club  with  a  weapon.  A  company  employee
assigned  to  the  front  door  one  evening  fails  to  check  a  patron
for a weapon. That patron gets angry later in the evening while
at the club and shoots another customer.

B. A car owner gives her car keys to an obviously intoxicated driver
who  takes  the  car  and  hurts  another  person  while  driving
carelessly.

C. An electrical company secures a contract with the city to install
streetlights on a busy road in town. The company fails to install
the  poles  properly,  making  them  less  secure.  A  driver  fails  to
control his car and hits the pole causing it to fall over (due to its
improper installation) and crush a nearby pedestrian.

Upon Further Review

in  multiple
law,  plaintiff’s  award  of  damages
At  common
tortfeasor  cases  was  always  based  upon  joint  and  several
liability — this  facilitated  easier  recovery  of  all  damages  by  the
innocent plaintiff. The adoption of comparative fault has caused
most  states  to  modify  their  rules  so  that  several  liability
this  shift,  no  state  has
predominates.  Notwithstanding
completely abandoned joint and several liability in all instances.
Regardless  of  one’s  position  on  the  debate  between  these  two
systems  of  apportioning  liability,  the  switch  to  several  liability
has  created  certain  interpretational  dilemmas  that  were  not  a
concern  at  common  law,  including  apportionment  in  cases  of
absent  or  immune  tortfeasors,  comparisons  between  negligent
and intentional tortfeasors, and what to do with a negligent actor
whose  fault  has  permitted  a  subsequent  actor’s  tort  to  occur.
How a state answers these questions involves important public
policy debates and, on a very practical level, impacts a plaintiff’s
decision  as  to  who  to  sue  and  which  theories  to  adopt  in
presenting a tort claim.

IV  EQUITABLE DOCTRINES CREATING JOINT

LIABILITY

A. Introduction

In  addition  to  the  negligent  enabling  scenario  discussed  in  the
previous  section,  there  are  a  few  other  instances  where  courts  have
crafted other doctrines that result in one being liable not just for his
own  fault  but  also  for  the  fault  of  another.  Vicarious  liability  is  a
doctrine  that  imposes  liability  upon  one,  however  innocent,  based
solely upon that party’s relationship with the actual tortfeasor. When
applicable,  both  the  tortfeasor  and  the  vicariously  liable  defendant
share  a  joint  liability.  The  concert  of  action  doctrine  creates  a  joint
liability for those actors who are found to be involved in the tortious
misconduct  that  has  harmed  the  plaintiff,  either  by  virtue  of  a
common scheme or some acts of encouragement. While applying in
very  different  contexts  and  supported  by  different  principles,  in
application  these  two  doctrines  operate  in  a  similar  fashion — by
creating a joint liability not only on the part of the primary tortfeasor,
but  also  with  those  connected  with  the  tortfeasor  either  by  their
relationship or by their incriminating conduct. Both doctrines have the
effect  of  providing  additional  defendants  against  whom  a  victim
might  be  able  to  recover.  In  this  way,  the  doctrines  further  the  tort
purpose of providing compensation to tort victims.

is the common law doctrine of
or
vicarious
respondeat superior.  The  term
“vicarious”  refers  generally  to
of
the
standing in place for another or to a type of shared experience. Both
of  these  non-legal  meanings  are  appropriate  for  the  tort  doctrine  of
vicarious  liability  because  this  doctrine  involves  one  being  held
lawfully  responsible  for  the  tortious  harm  inflicted  by  another.
Vicarious liability is, at its core, guilt by association with a tortfeasor.
It is manifest in various forms, including the liability of one business
partner for the torts of another, the liability of any member of a “joint
enterprise”  for  the  tort  of  another  member,  the  liability  of  one  family
member  for  the  tort  of  another  conducted  in  pursuing  the  family
affairs, and the liability (under some state statutes) of the owner of a
vehicle loaned to a tortfeasor who causes an accident. But the most
prevalent  application  of  vicarious  liability  is  in  the  master-servant
(nowadays  the  employer-employee)  context.  The  following  case
introduces  vicarious  liability  in  a  case  where  the  plaintiff  seeks  to
impose liability on the defendant employer in two ways, one involving
a direct liability claim and the other for vicarious liability.

TRAHAN-LAROCHE v. LOCKHEED SANDERS, INC.
657 A.2d 417 (N.H. 1995)

      , J.

The  plaintiffs,  Rita  Trahan-Laroche  and  Lucien  Laroche,  appeal  a
decision of the Superior Court granting the motion of the defendant,
Lockheed Sanders, Inc., [to dismiss] on their respondeat superior and
negligent supervision claims. We reverse and remand.

On  October  24,  1990,  a  flatbed  trailer  separated  from  the  pickup
truck  towing  it  and  collided  with  the  plaintiffs’  vehicle.  Patrick  J.

Maimone,  employed  by  the  defendant  as  a  maintenance  mechanic,
was the driver as well as the owner of both the truck and the trailer.
One of his tasks was to hay the ﬁelds at the defendant’s facilities in
Hudson  and  Litchﬁeld.  Maimone  provided  most  of  the  haying
equipment, most of which he towed to the defendant’s premises with
his truck and trailer. The defendant did not compensate Maimone for
the use of the equipment or the time spent transporting it, but did pay
him  his  normal  wages  while  haying  the  ﬁelds  and  permitted  him  to
keep any hay he removed. Prior to the day of the accident, Maimone
had  completed  haying  the  ﬁelds  at  the  defendant’s  Litchﬁeld  facility,
but had not removed his trailer or all of the farming equipment. After
work  on  October  24,  1990,  but  before  leaving  the  defendant’s
premises,  Maimone  hitched  his  trailer  to  his  truck  for  use  in
transporting  hay  from  his  farm  to  the  Agway  store  to  sell  that
evening. He planned to return the trailer to remove the remaining farm
machinery. The trailer separated from the truck during the drive from
the defendant’s Litchﬁeld facility to Maimone’s farm.

The  plaintiffs  sued  the  defendant  under  theories  of  respondeat
superior  and  negligent  supervision.  They  argued  that  Maimone  was
acting  within  the  scope  of  his  employment  at  the  time  of  the
accident.  Alternatively,  they  argued  that  while  on  the  defendant’s
property and under the defendant’s supervision and control, Maimone
negligently attached his trailer and used inadequate safety chains in
violation  of  the  common  law.  The  defendants  moved  for  summary
judgment,  arguing  that  no  disputed  issues  of  material  fact  existed
and that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim upon which relief may be
granted  because  Maimone  was  not  acting  within  the  scope  of  his
employment.

The  trial  court  ruled  as  a  matter  of  law  that  Maimone  acted
outside  the  scope  of  his  employment.  Treating  the  defendant’s
motion as a motion to dismiss, the court concluded that “even taking
the  facts  and  reasonable  inferences  drawn  therefrom  in  the  light

most favorable to them, the plaintiffs have failed to state a claim that
would permit them to recover.”

Under  the  doctrine  of  respondeat  superior,  an  employer  may  be
held  vicariously  responsible  for  the  tortious  acts  of  an  employee
committed incidental to or during the scope of employment. Here, the
plaintiff  has  alleged  that  the  movement  of  Maimone’s  trailer  for
temporary personal use was understood to be part of the agreement
between Maimone and the defendant regarding Maimone’s provision
of  the  farming  equipment  and  removal  of  the  hay,  and  therefore
incidental to Maimone’s employment. This allegation could lead to a
ﬁnding  that  would  support  recovery  based  on  the  doctrine  of
respondeat superior if found to be true by a jury.

to enhance the plaintiff’s ability
to collect on a tort judgment. It

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Respondeat Superior Claim.  The basic rule of vicarious liability
in the master-servant context is quite easy to articulate — a master is
liable for the torts committed by his servant in the course and scope
of  employment.  See  Restatement  (Second)  of  Agency  §219  (1958).
Thus,  there  are  two  basic  components  to  the  doctrine’s  application.
First,  the  relationship  needs  to  be  one  of  employer-employee.
Employment relationships come in all shapes and sizes. A corporate
ofﬁcer  can  be  an  employee,  and  so  can  the  janitor  who  empties  the
ofﬁcer’s trashcan each evening. There are many published decisions
analyzing whether someone who seems to be acting for the beneﬁt of
the defendant is an employee or a mere “independent contractor.” We
will  see  a  multi-factored  list  of  considerations  courts  utilize  to  make
this  distinction.  The  chief  factor  will  be  the  extent  of  control  the
defendant has over the details of the tortfeasor’s work. Second, even
if  an  employment  relationship  exists,  vicarious  liability  only  attaches
when  the  employee  commits  the  tort  in  the  “course  and  scope”  of
employment.  When  the  employee  is  “off  the  clock,”  the  relationship
ceases  as  far  as  vicarious  liability  is  concerned.  There  is,  again,  a
plethora of cases giving meaning to the phrase “course and scope of

employment.”  Notice  that  the  employer’s  liability  exists  absent  proof
of  fault  against  the  employer.  Some  have  suggested  that  vicarious
liability  is,  therefore,  a  type  of  strict  liability  or  liability  without  fault.
This thought may be somewhat misleading because various liability,
for  it  to  attach,  certainly  requires  that  the  plaintiff  prove  the  fault  of
the employee. True strict liability requires no traditional proof of fault
against anyone. In Trahan-Laroche, there appeared to be no dispute
about  the  employer-employee  relationship  that  existed  between
defendant  Lockheed  Sanders  and  Patrick  Maimone.  With  respect  to
the second element, the court believed that there were both sufﬁcient
allegations  and  evidence  to  submit  to  the  jury  the  issue  of  whether
Maimone was acting in the course and scope of employment at the
time  of  his  alleged  negligent  act.  The  next  two  cases  will  further
explore the law related to these two elements of vicarious liability.

2. Negligent Supervision Claim.  You may recall seeing in Chapter
6, Special Duty Rules (in connection with the Otis Engineering  case),
that employers have their own duty to supervise their employees for
the  protection  of  third  parties.  If  an  employer  breaches  its  own  duty
through  poor  hiring,  supervision  of  its  employee,  or  the  negligent
entrustment  of  dangerous  materials  or  machinery  to  an  employee,
then  it  has  its  own  independent  basis  for  liability.  Breaching  its  own
duty of care imposes direct liability  on  the  employer  based  upon  its
own  fault  and  is  distinct  from  vicarious  liability  concepts.  For
example,  if  an  employer  knowingly  permits  an  intoxicated  employee
to use a company vehicle to make a delivery, it has breached its own
duty of care. If that employee drives carelessly and hits a pedestrian,
the employer is also subject to vicarious liability. In such instances, it
would be appropriate to submit for apportionment purposes the fault
of both the employee (for driving poorly) and the employer (for letting
a drunk drive its truck) — but the employer would face a judgment for
the  combined  percentage  of  fault.  In  Trahan-Laroche,  the  appellate
court  believed  that  the  allegations  and  evidence  were  sufﬁcient  to
demonstrate  a  possible  breach  of  duty  of  care  owed  by  Lockheed

Sanders,  which  arose  out  of  a  failure  to  supervise  the  actions  of
Maimone in connecting the trailer while on the defendant’s premises.
In cases such as this, one has to be careful to analyze separately the
fault of the employer as well as the vicarious liability of the employer
for the employee’s fault.

3. Effect of Vicarious Liability Doctrine.  It is important to consider
the impact of the vicarious liability doctrine on the entry of judgment
in  a  torts  case.  The  doctrine  exists  to  provide  a  deep  pocket  to
enhance  the  plaintiff’s  ability  to  collect  on  a  tort  judgment.  If  the
plaintiff proves the two prerequisites for the doctrine and proves that
the  defendant’s  employee  committed  a  tort  against  the  plaintiff,  the
plaintiff can recover against the employer to the same extent as she
could against the employee. Of course, to recover against either, the
plaintiff  has  to  name  that  party  as  a  defendant  in  the  lawsuit  and
serve  them  with  process.  The  plaintiff  can  sue  both  or  either  of  the
two.  In  terms  of  apportionment  issues,  in  cases  of  pure  vicarious
liability there is no reason to apportion between the employee and the
employer — the  employer  is  not  accused  of  being  separately  at  fault
itself; it merely stands in the shoes of its employee and bears a joint
liability  to  the  same  extent  as  the  employee.  If  the  employee  is
apportioned  25  percent  of  the  total  fault  in  a  several  liability
jurisdiction, the plaintiff can seek to collect on that 25 percent of the
total damages from the employee, the employer, or a combination of
the  two.  If  the  plaintiff  collects  the  judgment  from  the  vicariously
liable  employer,  that  employer  may  pursue  a  common
law
indemnification  claim  against  the  employee.  Indemniﬁcation  is  the
right to seek full reimbursement for all damages paid by virtue of the
tort caused by another for whom the vicariously liable actor was held
responsible. Although it operates similarly to a contribution claim, it is
technically  distinct.  A  right  to  contribution  is  a  claim  between  joint
tortfeasors in a joint and several liability context where one has paid
beyond his own level of fault and seeks a partial reimbursement. In a
case  of  pure  vicarious  liability,  the  employer  is  not  a  joint  tortfeasor

instead  owns  a  right  to

indemniﬁcation  rather  than
and  so
contribution.  Can  you  understand  why  the  vicariously  liable  actor
should  be  entitled  to  be  fully  indemniﬁed  from  the  tortfeasor
employee?

Florida Standard Jury Instruction 3.3: Issues as to Vicarious
Liability

The  ﬁrst  issue  for  your  determination  on  the  claim  of
claimant  against  defendant  on  account  of  the  alleged
negligence  of  [third  party]  is  whether  [the  third  party]  was  an
agent  of  defendant  and  was  acting  within  the  scope  of  his
employment at the time and place of the incident complained
of.  An  agent  is  a  person  who  is  employed  to  act  for  another,
and whose actions are controlled by his or her employer or are
subject to his or her employer’s right of control. An employer is
responsible  for  the  negligence  of  its  agent  if  such  negligence
occurs while the agent is performing services which he or she
was employed to perform or while the agent is acting at least
in part because of a desire to serve his or her employer and is
doing  something  that  is  reasonably  incidental  to  his  or  her
employment or something the doing of which was reasonably
foreseeable  and  reasonably  to  be  expected  of  persons
similarly employed.

But  a  person  is  not  responsible  for  the  negligence  of  an
independent contractor. An independent contractor is a person
who is engaged by another to perform speciﬁc work according
to his or her own methods and whose methods of performing
the work are not controlled by the person engaging him or her
and are not subject to that person’s right of control.

1. Employees vs. Independent Contractors

Sometimes  in  vicarious  liability  claims,  it  is  clear  that  the  direct
tortfeasor was involved in performing a task for the beneﬁt of another
but  it  is  unclear  whether  an  employer-employee  relationship  existed.
Absent  this  relationship,  there  is  no  guilt  by  association.  In  the
following case, plaintiff fails in her attempt to invoke vicarious liability
as  a  basis  for  seeking  judgment  against  the  corporate  entity.  What
was lacking, according to the court?

THROOP v. F.E. YOUNG & CO.
382 P.2d 560 (Az. 1963)

        , J.

The  plaintiff,  Mrs.  Marie  D.  Throop,  a  widow,  brought  a  wrongful
death action for the beneﬁt of herself and her minor children, against
defendants Robert D. Stauffer, as administrator of the estate of Peter
J. Hennen, deceased, and the F.E. Young and Company.

Vernon  Throop,  husband  of  the  plaintiff,  Marie  Throop,  was  a
counter-intelligence ofﬁcer of the United States Army working out of
Tucson, Arizona. On October 10, 1957, Throop, with a passenger, was
driving west towards Tucson on U. S Highway 80 near Benson. On a
level  and  straight  highway  in  broad  daylight  the  vehicle  occupied  by
Peter Hennen, proceeding in an easterly direction, suddenly swerved
into Throop’s lane of trafﬁc causing a violent head-on collision. Both
Throop and Hennen were found dead in their cars by witnesses to the
accident.

At  the  conclusion  of  the  evidence,  both  defendants  moved  for  a
directed  verdict.  The  court  directed  a  verdict  for  the  defendant  F.E.
Young and Company and denied the motion of Robert D. Stauffer, as
administrator.  The  jury  returned  a  verdict  for  plaintiff  in  the  sum  of
$50,400.00 against the administrator.

Plaintiff has appealed from the directed verdict in favor of the F.E.
Young and Company, and the defendant Stauffer, as administrator of
the  estate  of  Hennen,  has  appealed  from  the  verdict  in  favor  of
plaintiff.

[With  respect  to  the  plaintiff’s  recovery  against  the  estate  of  the
other  driver,  Hennen,  the  court  found  the  trial  court’s  use  of  the
doctrine  of  res  ipsa  loquitur  was  appropriate  and  that  the  evidence
was sufﬁcient to support the jury’s decision in favor of the plaintiff.

Plaintiff  appealed  from  the  entry  of  a  directed  verdict  on  her

claims against defendant F.E. Young and Company.]

Plaintiff’s  ﬁrst  assignment  of  error  is  that  there  was  sufﬁcient
evidence  from  which  the  jury  could  have  found  that  the  defendant
controlled  or  had  the  right  to  control  the  actions  of  its  deceased
salesman.

The  uncontradicted  evidence  of  Hennen’s  employment  by  F.E.
Young and Company showed that Violet Jennings, 48, a widow, was
president of the Company which caused to be manufactured various
medical  testing  kits  and  sold  them  to  wholesalers  throughout  the
country.  The  company  employed  the  services  of  only  two  ofﬁce
employees  other  than  the  services  of  Peter  J.  Hennen.  Hennen  had
been  with  the  company  15  years  and  during  the  lifetime  of  William
Jennings (deceased husband of Violet Jennings), a letter was drawn
up  by  Mr.  Jennings  outlining  the  terms  of  the  contract  between  the
company  and  Hennen.  Mrs.  Jennings  testiﬁed  that  the  manner  in
which Mr. Hennen performed the services for the company was that
he would come to the company ofﬁce from time to time, pull cards on
wholesale houses, and pick out the ones he desired to visit; or, if one
of  the  two  ofﬁce  employees  would  make  a  list  of  wholesalers  for
Hennen to visit, he would modify the list as he saw ﬁt. He took care of
his  own  hotel  and  traveling  expenses  out  of  his  commissions;  1¼
cents per mile was paid on his automobile which he owned. He had
no power to ﬁx prices but he often gave more discounts than were on

the discount cards furnished wholesalers and the company accepted
these. He arranged his selling visits in accordance with the times he
wished  to  visit  relatives  in  various  parts  of  the  country  and  stayed
with  his  relatives  for  varying  periods  of  time  as  he  desired.  Hennen
sold  the  goods  of  at  least  one  other  company  while  on  his  trips,  in
particular,  novelty  glass  vases  and  paper  weights  for  the  St.  Clair
Glass  Works.  The  amount  of  his  commissions  with  the  defendant
company  never  exceeded  $1,200  in  any  one  year  as  Hennen  was
receiving  social  security  and  did  not  wish  to  jeopardize  this  status.
The company made deductions from payments to Hennen for federal
withholding tax and paid federal employment compensation. He was
carried  the  same  way  on  personnel  records  as  the  two  ofﬁce
employees.  Hennen  visited  the  ofﬁce  an  average  of  only  four  or  ﬁve
times a year.

The  test  to  determine  if  the  doctrine  of  “respondeat  superior”
applies  to  charge  an  employer  with  liability  for  negligence  of  his
employee  is  whether,  with  respect  to  the  physical  conduct  of  the
employee  and  the  performance  of  his  service,  he  is  subject  to  the
employer’s  control  or  right  of  control.  This  principle  is  stated  in
Restatement of the Law, Agency 2d, §220 in part as follows:

§220. Definition of Servant

(1) A servant is a person employed to perform services in the affairs of
another and who with respect to the physical conduct in the performance
of the services is subject to the other’s control or right to control.

(2)  In  determining  whether  one  acting  for  another  is  a  servant  or  an
independent  contractor,  the  following  matters  of  fact,  among  others,  are
considered:

(a) the extent of control which, by the agreement, the master may

exercise over the details of the work;

(b)  whether  or  not  the  one  employed  is  engaged  in  a  distinct

occupation or business;

* * *

(e)  whether

the
instrumentalities, tools, and the place of work for the person doing the
work;

the  workman  supplies

the  employer  or

* * *

(g) the method of payment, whether by the time or by the job.”

* * *

The foregoing test has been approved and followed in Arizona in
the  cases  of  Consolidated  Motors,  Inc.  v.  Ketcham,  66  P.2d  246
(Ariz.), and Lee Moor Contracting Co. v. Blanton, 65 P.2d 35 (Ariz.).

The  following  discussion  from  the  Consolidated  Motors  case  is

controlling in the instant case:

But  the  ultimate  fact,  which  these  evidentiary  facts  are  merely  intended  to
assist the jury or court in determining, is whether the alleged servant is subject
to the other’s control or right to control in the manner in which he reaches the
desired result. The distinction is well set forth as follows:

It is important to distinguish between a servant and an agent who is not a
servant,  since  ordinarily  a  principal  is  not  liable  for  the  incidental  acts  of
negligence  in  the  performance  of  duties  committed  by  an  agent  who  is  not  a
servant.  One  who  is  employed  to  make  contracts  may,  however,  be  a  servant.
Thus,  a  shop  girl  or  a  traveling  salesman  may  be  a  servant  and  cause  the
employer to be liable for negligent injuries to a customer or for negligent driving
while  traveling  to  visit  prospective  customers.  The  important  distinction  is
between  service  in  which  the  actor’s  physical  activities  and  his  time  are
surrendered  to  the  control  of  the  master,  and  service  under  an  agreement  to
accomplish results or to use care and skill in accomplishing results. . . . For the
purpose of determining liability, they are “independent contractors” and do not
cause the person for whom the enterprise is undertaken to be responsible.

Plaintiff contends that by virtue of the contract signed by Hennen
and  Mr.  Jennings  prior  to  his  death,  at  least  seven  years  before  the
accident,  Mr.  Hennen  was  clearly  a  servant  and  not  an  independent
contractor  by  reason  of  the  mandatory  provisions  of  the  contract.
This contract provided that Hennen was to do the following: “You are
to call on accounts or prospects in person and not by telephone. You

are to present all items that we sell to each dealer. You are to submit
a written report on each prospect called on, giving reasons where an
order  is  not  obtained  for  each  item.”  The  letter  further  provided  that
Hennen  would  make  collections,  pick  up  stock  from  customers,  put
out display cards to dealers and perform other duties. This letter was
later  copied  by  Mrs.  Jennings  but  was  never  signed  and  was
apparently  used  as  a  memorandum  of  the  method  of  computing
commissions due Hennen.

The  uncontradicted  testimony  is  that  Hennen  never  made  any
written reports or put out display cards. There is no testimony as to
the  manner  he  called  on  customers.  Hennen  did  pick  up  and  return
some  unsalable  items.  Mrs.  Jennings  testiﬁed  that  when  she  took
over  the  business  on  her  husband’s  death  she  just  continued  things
as they were and never discussed any changes in procedure with Mr.
Hennen. Hennen had no ofﬁce duties and when he would return from
his  trips  he  would  report  to  Mrs.  Jennings,  his  “superior”  but  not  his
“supervisor.”

Of  signiﬁcance  to  the  control  or  right  to  control  issue  is  the
testimony that Hennen represented other companies, such as the St.
Clair Glass Works, but the extent of this representation was unknown.
Some  of  the  samples  of  the  St.  Clair  Glass  Works  were  found  in
Hennen’s car after his death.

There is no evidence of actual control over Hennen’s use of his car
or methods of selling. Any right to control selling procedures, if such
still  existed  by  virtue  of  the  original  letter-contract,  would  not  justify
an inference of any right to control the time, method or manner of the
operation  of  Hennen’s  automobile.  This  was  a  matter  of  Hennen’s
uncontrolled discretion within the United States at large, for business,
for  pleasure,  representing  defendant’s  company  or  other  companies
as he chose.

Plaintiff next states as a “signpost” that the fact either party may
terminate the employment at any time without liability, raises a strong

inference that the workman is a servant. Plaintiff [argues the power to
discharge gives the power to direct the smallest details of the work].

Rather than unnecessarily extend this opinion by a discussion of
all  the  “signposts”  set  forth  in  plaintiff’s  assignments  of  error  it
sufﬁces  to  state  that  the  ultimate  issue  in  the  servant-independent
contractor  disputes  is  “control  or  right  to  control”.  The  “matters  of
fact”  or  “signposts”  listed  in  the  Restatement  are  but  matters  to  be
considered.

An  examination  of  the  facts  in  the  instant  case  makes  readily
apparent  the  correctness  of  the  trial  court’s  ruling  in  directing  a
verdict in favor of defendant F.E. Young and Company for there is no
evidence  from  which  to  reasonably  infer  that  the  defendant  had  a
right to control Hennen in the operation of his automobile. The whole
of the United States and anywhere he chose to go in it was Hennen’s
territory.  He  visited  prospects  at  whatever  time  he  chose  and  he
selected  the  prospects,  visiting  the  ofﬁce  only  four  or  ﬁve  times  a
year.  Clearly,  no  inference  of  control  could  stand  the  scrutiny  of  a
motion  for  judgment  notwithstanding  the  verdict  had  the  case  been
submitted  to  the  jury.  There  being  no  control  or  right  of  control,  the
reason for imposing vicarious liability upon this employer is wanting.

The judgment is afﬁrmed.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Multiple  Criteria  Used  to  Determine  Control.   The  court
identiﬁed  by  the  Restatement
references  some  of  the  factors
(Second) of Agency as useful in determining if the tortfeasor was an
employee or a mere independent contractor. The court notes that the
key  is  the  extent  of  “control”  one  has  over  the  details  of  the  other’s
work,  whether  exercised  or  not.  Other  courts  have  identiﬁed  other
additional  relevant  criteria  in  this  inquiry,  including  (a)  the  extent  of
specialized  skills  necessary  to  perform  the  assigned  tasks,  (b)  the

provision of materials needed for the tasks and the place of the work,
(c) the relationship of the work to the regular business of the alleged
employer,  and  (d)  the  belief  of  the  parties  as  to  their  relationship  as
well  as  the  belief  of  third  parties  dealing  with  them.  None  of  these
lists  are  exhaustive,  as  courts  will  consider  any
relevant
circumstances.  One  potential  criteria  courts  discount,  however,  is
language
labeling  the  agent  as  an
“independent contractor.” While this language is relevant to the belief
of  the  parties,  it  is  not  controlling  and  certainly  not  binding  on  the
third-party  victim  of  the  tort.  See,  e.g.,  Anton  v.
Industrial
Commission, 688 P.2d 192, 194 (Ariz. 1984) (contract language is not
determinative  of  the  issue  but  rather  the  “objective  nature  of  the
relationship,  determined  upon  an  analysis  of  the  totality  of  the  facts
and circumstances of each case.”).

in  the  parties’  contract

2. Court Rejects Vicarious Claims.  The court in Throop determined
that the requisite employer-employee relationship was missing on the
vicarious liability claim. What facts were most essential to the court’s
conclusion that the tortfeasor was an independent contractor rather
than  an  employee  of  the  defendant  corporation?  Would  it  have
changed the outcome, for example, if the driver were not permitted to
represent any other companies in his travels for the defendant?

3. Rationale  for  Vicarious  Liability.   Most  courts  have  traditionally
focused upon the right to control the assigned tasks as creating a fair
argument  in  favor  of  imposing  vicarious  liability.  What  is  it  about
someone’s control over another that makes it fairer to impose guilt by
association upon them?

4. Problems.   Consider  whether  the  following  relationships  would
meet  the  criteria  for  an  employer-employee  relationship.  Use  the
Restatement  criteria  to  articulate  your  answer.  What  additional
information  might  you  want  to  know  before  reaching  a  ﬁrm
conclusion in each instance?

A.  While  delivering  the  defendant’s  newspapers  to  customers,  a
delivery  person  speeds  in  his  car  and  hits  a  patch  of  ice.  He
loses  control  of  his  vehicle  and  drives  through  the  plaintiff’s
living room.

B.  Defendant  hires  a  nanny  to  care  for  her  child,  including  driving
the  child  to  and  from  school  and  other  extracurricular  events.
The  nanny  has  an  accident  during  one  of  these  trips  for  which
she is at fault.

C.  Defendant  hires  a  plumber  to  install  a  new  gas  line  to  his
ﬁreplace.  The  plumber  accidentally  errs  in  performing  his  work
and  this  leads  to  an  explosion  that  not  only  destroys  the
defendant’s  home,  but  also  the  neighbor’s  home.  The  neighbor
sues defendant.

2. Course and Scope of Employment

Even  if  the  direct  tortfeasor  is  proven  to  be  the  employee  of  the
defendant  employer,  vicarious  liability  is  not  automatic.  Unless  the
tort occurs while the employee is acting in the course and scope  of
employment  there  is  no  guilt  by  association.  The  following  case
discusses the criteria used by courts to determine this issue when it
is disputed.

FRUIT v. EQUITABLE LIFE ASSURANCE SOCIETY
502 P.2d 133 (Alaska 1972)

         , J.

This  case  arises  from  a  tragic  accident  in  which  the  appellee,
John Schreiner, was crushed between his parked automobile and the
colliding  vehicle  owned  and  driven  by  the  appellant,  Clay  Fruit.

Schreiner’s left leg was amputated and the muscle tissue of the right
leg so destroyed as to leave him crippled and permanently disabled.

At  the  time  of  the  accident,  Fruit,  a  life  insurance  salesman,  was
attending  a  sales  convention  of  his  employer,  Equitable  Life
Assurance  Society  (Equitable).  The  annual  convention  was  being
conducted  at  the  resort  location  of  Land’s  End  near  Homer  on  July
10-13,  1969.  Sales  employees  of  the  company  were  required  to
attend  the  convention.  After  discussing  with  district  managers  the
possibility  of  transporting  the  Anchorage  insurance  salesmen  to  the
convention  by  bus,  the  agency  manager  decided  that  participants
should  travel  by  private  transportation,  and  that  they  would  be
reimbursed a lump sum for their expenses. Clay Fruit chose to drive
his  own  automobile,  accompanied  by  his  wife,  another  insurance
agent and the wife and child of the latter.

Insurance  experts  from  California  and  Washington  were  also
invited  as  guests  to  the  convention,  and  the  Alaska  salesmen  were
encouraged  to  mix  freely  with  these  guests  to  learn  as  much  as
possible  about  sales  techniques  during  the  three-day  gathering.
Scheduled events included business meetings during morning hours,
evening  dinners  and  at  least  two  cocktail  parties.  District  managers
entertained their own sales personnel at other cocktail parties.

On the ﬁrst evening of the convention, Thursday, July 10, 1969, the
out-of-state guests and the agency manager dined at the Waterfront
Bar  and  Restaurant  in  downtown  Homer,  approximately  ﬁve  miles
from the convention headquarters at Land’s End. They were joined a
few hours later by a number of sales agents, including Fruit, for drinks
and  socializing.  At  other  times  during  the  ﬁrst  two  days  of  the
convention,  the  participants  made  occasional  visits  in  small  groups
to the Salty Dawg Bar located about a half-mile from the convention
center at Land’s End.

A  desk  clerk  at  Land’s  End  testiﬁed  that  loud  and  sometimes
disorderly  partying  continued  around  the  room  of  the  agency

manager and the adjoining porch and stairway until the early hours of
the  morning  on  Friday,  July  11,  1969.  One  of  the  district  managers
testiﬁed that he complained about the noise to the agency manager.

A  business  meeting  on  Friday  morning  proceeded  on  schedule
followed  by  a  cocktail  party  and  hors  d’oeuvres  in  the  room  and
adjoining spaces of the agency manager. Fruit went to the room of an
out-of-state  guest  with  whom  he  talked  business  and  had  drinks.
Testimony  indicates  that  by  mid-afternoon  Fruit  was  asleep  on  the
floor. That evening, a scheduled cocktail party and seafood dinner on
the  beach  proceeded  without  Fruit  who  was  still  asleep  in  a  room
adjacent to that of the out-of-state guest.

At  some  time  between  10:00  and  11:30  p.m.  following  the
seafood  dinner  other  members  of  the  group  awoke  Fruit  who,
accompanied by his wife and two couples, walked to the Salty Dawg
Bar  and  returned  shortly.  The  others  were  tired  and  went  to  bed  but
Fruit decided to go to Homer as he was under the impression that the
out-of-state guests were at the Waterfront Bar and Restaurant. Fruit
then drove his car to Homer but departed when he did not ﬁnd any of
his colleagues.

His  return  route  to  Land’s  End  took  him  past  the  Salty  Dawg  Bar
where Schreiner’s automobile was disabled on or immediately off the
side of the road opposite Fruit’s lane. While the facts of the particular
moment  of  the  accident  which  occurred  at  approximately  2:00  a.m.
on July 12, 1969, are unclear, it appears that Fruit applied his brakes
and skidded across the dividing line of the highway, colliding with the
front of Schreiner’s car. The hood of Schreiner’s automobile had been
raised  and  Schreiner  was  standing  in  front  of  his  car.  The  collision
crushed his legs.

The  subsequent  amputation  and  crippling  of  Schreiner  was
exacerbated by a urinary disorder resulting from exploratory surgery
necessitated by the accident. Schreiner sued Fruit and his employer,
Equitable, for damages including pain and suffering, mental anguish,

interference with normal activities, continuing medical expenses, loss
of  income  and  ﬁnancial  losses  incurred  from  the  forced  sale  of  his
home,  a  lot  and  securities.  The  jury  found  on  special  interrogatories
that Fruit’s negligence was the proximate cause of the accident; that
he  was  acting  within  the  course  and  scope  of  his  employment  for
Equitable;  that  Equitable  was  directly  negligent  in  planning  and
conducting the convention, which negligence was a proximate cause
of  the  accident;  and  that  Schreiner  was  not  contributorily  negligent.
The  jury  awarded  damages  of  $635,000  against  both  defendants.
Both moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict and presently
appeal from the respective denials of the motions.

Equitable contends that the evidence was insufﬁcient to establish
that Fruit was acting within the course and scope of his employment
at  the  time  of  the  accident;  that  Equitable  cannot  be  held  directly
liable for the manner in which it conducted the summer conference;
and  that  Equitable  did  not  receive  a  fair  trial  because  the  facts
adduced  by  the  plaintiff  in  support  of  its  direct  negligence  claim
“tainted the jury’s consideration of respondeat superior.”

The  jury  found  that  Fruit  was  an  employee  acting  within  the
course  and  scope  of  his  employment  for  Equitable  at  the  time  and
place  of  the  accident.  Under  the  doctrine  of  respondeat  superior
(which simply means “let the employer answer”) Equitable would thus
be  liable  for  Fruit’s  acts  of  negligence  despite  lack  of  fault  on
Equitable’s part.

requires  an  analysis  of  the  doctrine  of  respondeat  superior,  one  of
the  few  anomalies  to  the  general  tort  doctrine  of  no  liability  without
fault.

The  origins  of  the  principle  whereby  an  employer  may  be  held
vicariously  liable  for  the  injuries  wrought  by  his  employee  are  in
dispute.  Justice  Holmes  traces  the  concept  to  Roman  law  while
Wigmore  ﬁnds  it  to  be  of  Germanic  origin.  The  doctrine  emerged  in
English law in the 17th Century. Initially a master was held liable for
those acts which he commanded or to which he expressly assented.
This was expanded to include acts by implied command or authority
and eventually to acts within the scope of employment. The modern
theory evolved with the growth of England’s industry and commerce.

A  truly  imaginative  variety  of  rationale[s]  have  been  advanced  by
courts and glossators in justiﬁcation of this imposition of liability on

employers [including the employer’s duty to control its employees, or
the  employer  and  employee  being  a  “single  persona”.]  Baty  more
cynically states: “In hard fact, the reason for the employers’ liability is
the damages are taken from a deep pocket.”

The two theories which carry the greatest weight in contemporary
legal thought are respectively, the “control” theory which ﬁnds liability
whenever  the  act  of  the  employee  was  committed  with  the  implied
authority,  acquiescence  or  subsequent  ratiﬁcation  of  the  employer,
and  the  “enterprise”  theory  which  ﬁnds
liability  whenever  the
enterprise of the employer would have beneﬁted by the context of the
act of the employee but for the unfortunate injury.

The  aspect  of  the  relationship  most  commonly  advanced  to
delimit  the  theory  is  the  “scope  of  employment”  of  the  employee-
tortfeasor. While the factual determination generally is left to the jury,
many  cases  lying  in  the  penumbras  of  “scope  of  employment”  have
the
produced  confusing  and  contradictory
development  of  an  otherwise  worthy  doctrine  of  law.  To  assist  in
delineating the areas of tortious conduct imposing liability, it is helpful
to consider what we believe to be the correct philosophical basis for
the doctrine.

There  was  a  time  when  the  artisans,  shopkeepers  and  master
craftsmen  could  directly  oversee  the  activities  of  their  apprentices
and  journeymen.  Small,  isolated  communities  or  feudal  estates
evinced  a  provincial  sense  of  social  interaction  which  ensured  that
many  enterprises  would  conduct  their  businesses  with  a  careful
concern  for  the  community  of  its  patrons.  But  in  the  present  day
when  hundreds  of  persons  divide  labors  under  the  same  corporate
roof  and  produce  a  single  product  for  market  to  an  unidentiﬁed
the  communal  spirit  and  shared  commitment  of
consumer,
enterprises from another age is sacriﬁced to other efﬁciencies. At the
same  time,  the  impersonal  nature  of  such  complex  enterprises  and
their mechanization make third parties considerably more vulnerable
to  injury  incidentally  arising  from  the  pursuit  of  the  business.

Business  corporations  are  granted  a  personal  identiﬁcation  in  legal
ﬁction  to  limit  liability  of  the  investors,  but  not  to  insulate  the
corporate entity itself from liability for the unfortunate consequences
of its enterprise. The basis of respondeat superior has been correctly
stated  as  the  desire  to  include  in  the  costs  of  operation  inevitable
losses to third persons incident to carrying on an enterprise, and thus
distribute the burden among those beneﬁted by the enterprise.

Consistent  with  these  considerations,  it  is  apparent  that  no
categorical  statement  can  delimit  the  meaning  of  “scope  of
employment”  once  and  for  all  times.  Applicability  of  respondeat
superior will depend primarily on the ﬁndings of fact in each case. In
this particular case, Clay Fruit’s employment contract required that he
attend  the  sales  conference.  Each  employee  was  left  to  his  own
resources for transportation, and many of the agents, including Fruit,
chose to drive their own automobiles. By the admission of Equitable’s
agency  manager,  the  scope  of  the  conference  included  informal
socializing as well as formal meetings. Social contact with the out-of-
state guests was encouraged, and there is undisputed evidence that
such associations were not limited to the conference headquarters at
Land’s End. Some agents, including Fruit, gathered with the guests in
Homer  the  evening  before  the  accident,  and  groups  of  agents  and
their wives visited the Salty Dawg on various occasions.

When Fruit left for the Waterfront Bar and Restaurant his principal
purpose  was  to  join  the  out-of-state  guests.  This  testimony  of  his
was further conﬁrmed by the fact that once he discovered that they
were not present at the Waterfront he departed immediately. Had he
been  engaged  in  a  “frolic  of  his  own”  it  would  appear  likely  that  he
would have remained there. There was evidence from which the jury
would ﬁnd that he was at least motivated in part by his desire to meet
with the out-of-state guests and thus to beneﬁt from their experience
so as to improve his abilities as a salesman.

Because  we  ﬁnd  that  fair-minded  men

in  the  exercise  of
reasonable  judgment  could  differ  as  to  whether  Fruit’s  activities  in

returning from Homer to the convention headquarters were within the
scope  of  his  employment,  we  are  not  disposed  to  upset  the  jury’s
conclusion  that  liability  for  damages  may  be  vicariously  imputed  to
Equitable.

The judgment below is afﬁrmed.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Course  and  Scope.   Courts  have  an  obligation  to  review  the
factual  evidence  relating  to  a  vicarious  liability  claim  in  order  to
determine  if  there  are  sufﬁcient  facts  by  which  a  jury  might
reasonably ﬁnd that a defendant’s employee was acting in the course
and  scope  of  employment.  The  issue  is  ultimately  an  issue  of  fact,
however,  and  frequently  is  left  to  the  jury’s  judgment  as  in  the  Fruit
case  above.  One  relatively  concise  statement  of  relevant  criteria  on
this issue, however, is found in the Restatement (Second) of Agency
§228(a):

Conduct  of  a  servant  is  within  the  scope  of  employment  if,  but
only if:

(A) it is of the kind he is employed to perform;
(B)  it  occurs  substantially  within  the  authorized  time  and  space

limits;

(C)  it  is  actuated,  at  least  in  part,  by  a  purpose  to  serve  the

master; and

(D) if force is intentionally used by the servant against another, the

use of force is not unexpected by the master.

2.  Frolic  and  Detour.   In  analyzing  this  issue  courts  frequently
resort  to  the  use  of  certain  phrases  in  reaching  conclusions.  For
example,  when  an  employee  has  substantially  deviated  from  his
appropriate  duties  such  that  he  is  no  longer  within  the  course  and

scope of employment courts will often say that he has engaged in a
“frolic” — a  temporary  abandonment  of  the  relationship  that  is  the
basis for the imposition of vicarious liability. When the deviation is not
substantial enough to destroy vicarious liability, courts refer to it as a
mere “detour.”

3. Going and Coming Rule.  Courts have generally held as a matter
of  black  letter  law  that  employees  are  not  within  the  scope  of
employment  when  they  are  engaged  in  a  routine  commute  to  and
from  work.  If  they  commit  a  tort  while  driving  home  from  the  ofﬁce,
they are typically not considered to be within the course and scope of
employment.  This  rule  applies  unless  the  employee  is  engaged  in  a
“special  errand”  for  her  employer  that  requires  the  travel,  such  as
when  an  associate  at  a  law  ﬁrm  is  instructed  to  drive  to  the
courthouse  on  the  way  to  work  to  review  a  case  ﬁle.  If  the  young
lawyer  has  an  accident  while  driving  to  the  court,  this  will  be
considered  a  special  errand  and  thus  falls  within  the  course  and
scope of employment.

4.  Intentional  Misconduct.   Courts  have  struggled  at  times  with
employees  who,  while  engaged  in  the  work  of  the  employer,  have
engaged  in  an  intentional  tort  such  as  battering  a  customer  at  a
store. Many courts refuse to recognize the employee as being within
the  course  and  scope  of  employment  during  the  commission  of  an
intentional tort because the employee is not actuated by any sense of
furthering  the  employer’s  business  in  such  instances.  See,  e.g.,  Lisa
M.  v.  Henry  Mayo  Newhall  Memorial  Hospital,  907  P.2d  358  (Cal.
1995)  (sexual  assaults  not  within  course  and  scope  of  employment
generally).  Yet  there  is  no  absolute  rule  cutting  off  vicarious  liability
for intentional torts. See, e.g., Patterson v. Blair, 172 S.W.3d 361 (Ky.
2005) (afﬁrming vicarious liability verdict when employee shot a gun
at  car’s  tires  while  attempting  to  repossess  the  vehicle);  Fearing  v.
Bucher,  977  P.2d  1163,  1168  (Or.  1999)  (pastor  of  church  who
engaged in sexual abuse could be within scope of employment if the
assaults were an “outgrowth of and were engendered by conduct that

was  within  the  scope”  of  his  duties).  In  a  similar  vein,  courts  have
generally  held  that  the  fact  that  an  employee’s  tortious  misconduct
in  violation  of  the  employer’s  rules  does  not
was  committed
automatically  disqualify  the  doctrine  of  vicarious
liability  from
attaching.  Otherwise,  employers  could  categorically  avoid  any
vicarious  liability  by  simply  having  a  rule  that  employees  were  not
permitted to commit any torts.

5. Problems.  How would you analyze whether the tortious actions
of  each  employee  in  the  following  scenarios  was  committed  within
the course and scope of employment?

A. A beer company advises its delivery drivers to always obey the
speed  limits.  One  driver  flaunts  this  rule  and  continues  to  drive
at  much  higher  speeds.  One  afternoon  during  a  delivery,  the
speeding driver hits a pedestrian.

B. An employee is instructed by her boss to deliver a package to a
customer an hour’s drive north of town. After driving for ﬁfteen
minutes toward the customer, the employee takes an exit to get
a  cup  of  coffee.  While  exiting  the  freeway,  the  employee
carelessly rear-ends another car.

C.  An  employee  at  a  manufacturing  facility  is  feeling  drowsy  and
steps  outside  to  get  some  fresh  air  and  enjoy  smoking  a
cigarette.  The  employee  negligently  drops  the  cigarette  into  a
trash  dumpster  while  it  is  still  lit.  This  causes  a  ﬁre,  which
spread to the plaintiff’s property next door.

D.  A  manager’s  assistant  at  defendant’s  restaurant  comes  into
work  after  hours  one  evening  when  the  restaurant  is  closed  to
catch  up  on  completing  some  paperwork.  The  assistant  falls
asleep  at  his  desk  during  the  middle  of  the  night  and  is
awakened  by  a  startled  housekeeper  who  is  present  to  empty
the trashcans from the ofﬁce. The assistant misperceives what
is happening and violently punches the housekeeper in the face.
E.  An  installer  for  a  cable  TV  company  arrives  at  the  Kennedy
mansion  to  upgrade  their  service  to  the  new  premium  level.

While in the house installing the new boxes, the installer begins
to  notice  all  of  the  ﬁne  jewels  laying  around.  He  also  discovers
the family is headed to Maine for a long weekend stay. So after
ﬁnishing  the  job,  he  returns  late  that  night  when  the  house  is
empty. He sneaks inside of it using a window he had unlatched,
and makes off with hundreds of thousands of dollars in jewels.
A security video camera captures the installer doing this, but he
has fled to Costa Rica.

C. Concert of Action

Many courts will impose liability on a defendant for the tort of another
when there is proof that the defendant was acting in concert with the
primary tortfeasor. This theory of liability is analogous to the criminal
law  concepts  of  conspiracy,  and  aiding  and  abetting.  In  a  tort  suit,
the effect of a ﬁnding that one was acting in concert with a tortfeasor
is  to  impose  liability  jointly  on  both  actors.  This  is  true  even  if  the
plaintiff would be unable to prove each of the elements of any other
tort  cause  of  action  against  the  defendant.  Concert  of  action  is
similar  to  vicarious  liability  in  that  one  is  being  held  responsible  for
the tortious harms caused by another. This theory is distinguishable
from  vicarious  liability,  however,  because  there  is  some  level  of
wrongdoing  here  rather  than  simply  being  guilty  by  association.  The
court below discusses different ways that one might be considered to
be liable under the concert of action theory. As you read the following
cases, ask yourself why the plaintiff had to resort to relying upon the
concert  of  action  doctrine  and  why  this  doctrine  was  available  in
Herman but unavailing to create liability in Shinn. After Shinn, we will
also  see  lawyers  for  a  very  sympathetic  pair  of  victims  of  a  car
accident  attempt  to  impose  liability  on  someone  who  was  not
physically  involved  in  the  accident,  but  had  texted  the  driver  at  fault
moments before the accident.

1. Conduct Creating Joint Liability

HERMAN v. WESGATE
464 N.Y.S.2d 315 (N.Y. App. Div. 1983)

                  

Plaintiff was injured while a guest at a stag party to celebrate the
impending marriage of defendant Thomas Hauck. The party was held
on-board a barge owned by defendant Donald Wesgate and Thomas
Rouse.  Following  a  three-hour  cruise,  the  barge  was  anchored  near
the shoreline of Irondequoit Bay. The depth of the water off the bow
of  the  barge  was  approximately  two  feet.  Several  guests  began
“skinny  dipping”  and,  within  a  brief  period  of  time,  some  in  the  party
began to throw others still clothed off the bow into the water. Two or
more  individuals  escorted  plaintiff  to  the  bow  of  the  barge  where,
unwillingly, he went overboard. Trauma to his head or neck resulted in
injury to his spinal cord.

[The  trial  court  granted  the  summary  judgment  motions  of
defendants  John  Hauck  and  James  Hauck.  Plaintiff  appealed  from
this order.]

It  was  improper  to  grant  the  motions  of  defendants  John  Hauck
and  James  Hauck.  Plaintiff’s  complaint  alleges  concerted  action  by
all of the defendants.

Concerted  action  liability  rests  upon  the  principle  that  “[all]  those  who,  in
pursuance of a common plan or design to commit a tortious act, actively take
part  in  it,  or  further  it  by  cooperation  or  request,  or  who  lend  aid  or
encouragement  to  the  wrongdoer,  or  ratify  and  adopt  his  acts  done  for  their
beneﬁt,  are  equally  liable  with  him”  (Prosser,  Torts  [4th  ed],  §46;  see,  also
Restatement, Torts 2d, §876). An injured plaintiff may pursue any one joint tort-
feasor  on  a  concerted  action  theory.  Such  tort-feasor  may,  in  turn,  seek
contribution from others who acted in concert with him.

Here, the conduct of the defendants alleged to be dangerous and
tortious is the pushing or throwing of guests, against their will, from
the  barge  into  the  water.  Liability  of  an  individual  defendant  will  not
depend  upon  whether  he  actually  propelled  plaintiff  into  the  water;
participation in the concerted activity is equivalent to participation in
the  accident  resulting  in  the  injury.  Whether  codefendants  acted  in
concert  is  generally  a  question  for  the  jury.  The  complaint  states  a
cause  of  action  against  each  of  the  defendants  and  the  record
presents questions of fact as to whether defendants John Hauck and
James  Hauck  acted  in  concert  with  the  other  defendants.  Thus
summary judgment should not have been granted.

SHINN v. ALLEN
984 S.W.2d 308 (Tex. App. 1998)

      , J.

Appellant,  Marjorie  Gail

as
representative/sole heir of the estate of Robert Wayne Shinn, appeals
the  rendition  of  summary  judgment  in  favor  of  appellee,  Russell
Martin Allen.

individually

Shinn,

and

In December 1994, a vehicle driven by Jeremy Michael Faggard, in
which Allen was a passenger, collided with a vehicle driven by Robert
Wayne  Shinn,  Gail  Shinn’s  husband.  Robert  Shinn  was  killed  in  the
accident, and Gail Shinn was seriously injured.

Gail  Shinn  sued  Allen  for  negligence,  alleging  Allen  substantially
assisted or encouraged an intoxicated person to drive an automobile
on public roads that resulted in the collision which killed Robert Shinn
and  injured  her.  Allen  moved  for  summary  judgment  contending  he
owed no duty to Gail Shinn. The summary judgment was granted.

In her sole point of error, Gail Shinn alleges the trial court erred in
granting Allen’s motion for summary judgment because the evidence

established  the  existence  of  both  a  duty  and  a  question  of  material
fact under the concert-of-action theory of liability.

The summary judgment evidence consists of Allen’s afﬁdavit, his
deposition, his answers to interrogatories, and a copy of the judgment
in Faggard’s driving-while-intoxicated case.

On  the  day  of  the  accident,  Faggard  picked  Allen  up  from  his
parents’ home at approximately 3:00 p.m. to go and “hang out.” Allen
and  Faggard  were  acquaintances  who  had  met  playing  volleyball.
Allen stated that Faggard was not a “close buddy of mine.” Both Allen
and  Faggard  were  under  21  years  of  age;  however,  about  an  hour
before the accident Faggard decided to buy some beer. Faggard and
Allen went to the convenience store where Faggard bought a twelve-
pack  of  beer.  Allen  did  not  pay  for  the  beer  or  arrange  for  the
purchase of the beer. Allen stated he did not plan on drinking that day
and did not know that Faggard drank. After buying the beer, Faggard
and  Allen  went  to  Faggard’s  house  and  talked  and  drank  the  beer.
Allen  consumed  four  or  ﬁve  beers,  and  Faggard  consumed  six  or
seven. Allen and Faggard did not eat anything while drinking the beer,
and the last time Allen ate was at “lunchtime.”

Sometime  before  7:00  p.m.,  Allen  asked  Faggard  to  take  him
home  because  his  parents  wanted  him  home  by  7:00  p.m.  to  eat
dinner.  During  the  ride  home,  Allen  did  not  think  Faggard  was
speeding.

The summary judgment evidence indicates Allen did not exercise
any control over the operation of Faggard’s vehicle. Allen afﬁrmatively
stated that he did not know what Faggard’s tolerance level to alcohol
was.  Allen  did  not  observe  anything
indicating  Faggard  was
intoxicated  before  the  accident.  Faggard  did  not  slur  his  words  and
was  not  stumbling  or  walking  in  a  way  that  would  indicate  he  was
intoxicated.  Allen,  however,  did  state  that  he  (Allen)  was  drunk.
Faggard was later convicted of driving while intoxicated.

Gail Shinn asserts that the summary judgment should be reversed
because  there  is  a  fact  issue  regarding  whether  Allen  is  liable  under
the  concert-of-action  theory.  The  Texas  Supreme  Court  has  stated
that,  “whether  such  a  theory  of  liability  is  recognized  in  Texas  is  an
open question.” Juhl v. Airington, 936 S.W.2d 640, 643 (Tex. 1996). A
version  of  the  theory  has  been  articulated  by  Professor  Keeton  as
follows:

All those who, in pursuance of a common plan or design to commit a tortious
act, actively take part in it, or further it by cooperation or request, or who lend
aid  or  encouragement  to  the  wrongdoer,  or  ratify  and  adopt  the  wrongdoer’s
acts done for their beneﬁt, are equally liable.

W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on The Law of Torts §46, at
323 (5th ed. 1984).

The  Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts  also

incorporates  this
principle,  imposing  liability  on  a  person  for  the  conduct  of  another
which causes harm. Section 876 states:

§876 Persons Acting in Concert

For  harm  resulting  to  a  third  person  from  the  tortious

conduct of another, one is subject to liability if he

(a)  does  a  tortious  act  in  concert  with  the  other  or

pursuant to a common design with him, or

(b)  knows  that  the  other’s  conduct  constitutes  a  breach
of  duty  and  gives  substantial  assistance  or  encouragement
to the other so to conduct himself, or

(c)  gives  substantial  assistance

in
accomplishing  a  tortious  result  and  his  own  conduct,
separately  considered,  constitutes  a  breach  of  duty  to  the
third person.

the  other

to

Restatement (Second) of Torts §876 (1977).

Gail  Shinn  argues  that  the  facts  of  this  case  fall  under  section
876(b). Subsection (b) imposes liability not for an agreement, but for
substantially assisting and encouraging a wrongdoer in a tortious act.
This subsection requires that the defendant have “an unlawful intent,
i.e., knowledge that the other party is breaching a duty and the intent
to  assist  that  party’s  actions.”  Juhl,  936  S.W.2d  at  644  (quoting
Payton v. Abbott Labs, 512 F. Supp. 1031, 1035 (D. Mass. 1981)).

Comment d to section 876 lists ﬁve factors that can be relevant to
whether  the  defendant  substantially  assisted  the  wrongdoer.  These
include: (1) the nature of the wrongful act; (2) the kind and amount of
the assistance; (3) the relation of the defendant and the actor; (4) the
presence  or  absence  of  the  defendant  at  the  occurrence  of  the
wrongful act; and (5) the defendant’s state of mind.

1. NATURE OF THE WRONGFUL ACT

The  purpose  of  the  concert-of-action  theory  is  to  deter  antisocial  or
dangerous behavior that is likely to cause serious injury or death to a
person or certain harm to a large number of people. Juhl, 936 S.W.2d
at 644-45. It is commonly recognized that driving while intoxicated is
an antisocial and dangerous behavior, likely to cause serious injury or
death to a person.

2. THE KIND AND AMOUNT OF THE ASSISTANCE

Gail  Shinn  relies  on  Cooper v. Bondoni,  841  P.2d  608  (Okla.  Ct.  App.
1991),  to  support  her  position.  The  court  in  Cooper  recognized  that
the  non-acting  person  must  give  substantial  assistance  or
encouragement to the tortfeasor in order to afﬁx Section 876 liability.
Id.  at  612  (emphasis  added).  There  is  no  evidence  Allen  purchased
the  beer,  ordered  the  beer,  paid  for  the  beer,  encouraged  Faggard  to
consume  the  beer,  or  encouraged  Faggard  to  drive  recklessly.  Allen
asked  for  a  ride  home.  Allen’s  request  was  gratuitous.  There  is  no

evidence  that  Faggard’s  decision  to  drive  in  an  intoxicated  condition
was more than his alone.

3. RELATION OF THE PARTIES

There is no special relationship between Allen and Faggard, such as
an  employee/employer  relationship,  that  would  place  one  party  in  a
position  of  control  over  the  other.  Allen  and  Faggard  were  just
acquaintances who decided to “hang out” one afternoon.

4. PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF THE DEFENDANT

Although we are not bound by out-of-state decisions, we ﬁnd Olson v.
Ische,  343  N.W.2d  284  (Minn.  1984),  informative  on  this  issue.  In
Olson,  the  court  held  that  “the  mere  presence  of  the  particular
defendant at the commission of the wrong, or his failure to object to
is
to  charge  him  with
it,
uncontroverted that Allen was riding in Faggard’s car as a passenger
when the accident occurred.

is  not  enough

responsibility.”

It

5. DEFENDANT’S STATE OF MIND

The summary judgment evidence shows Allen stated he did not think
Faggard was intoxicated. While a fact issue exists as to whether Allen
had  knowledge  that  Faggard  was  intoxicated,  that  issue  alone  does
not  create  a  fact  issue  as  to  whether  Allen  substantially  assisted  or
encouraged  Faggard.  Rather,  Allen’s  state  of  mind  is  merely  one  of
ﬁve  factors  that  can  be  relevant  to  whether  Allen  substantially
assisted Faggard.

In reviewing the summary judgment evidence in the context of the
above  ﬁve  factors,  we  conclude  Gail  Shinn  did  not  raise  a  material
fact issue that Allen substantially assisted or encouraged Faggard in
operating the vehicle.

[W]e conclude that the evidence conclusively disproves that Allen

breached the concert-of-action theory of duty to Gail Shinn.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Conspirators and Aiders and Abettors.  Restatement (Second) of
Torts  §876  describes  three  scenarios  where  the  concert  of  action
doctrine  will  create  a  joint  liability.  Subpart  (a)’s  reference  to  a  tort
committed  pursuant  to  a  “common  design”  describes  a  conspiracy
carried out by direct tortfeasors but to which the defendant has also
attached himself perhaps by being a part of the planning of the tort.
Subparts  (b)  and  (c)  are  more  analogous  to  aiding  and  abetting
because  they  each  involve  conduct  by  the  defendant  to  offer
“substantial assistance” or “encouragement” to the primary tortfeasor.
In the Shinn case, there was obviously no plan to be involved in a car
accident  or  to  engage  in  careless  driving.  Why  did  the  court  reject
imposing  the  doctrine  under  subpart  (b)  despite  the  fact  that  the
defendant asked the drunk driver to give him a ride home? Why was
this not considered enough encouragement to create joint liability? By
contrast, the relatively brief involvement by the defendants in Herman
was considered adequate to potentially amount to acting in concert.
What was different about the defendants’ conduct in the two cases?

2.  Role  and  Effect  of  Doctrine.   If  a  plaintiff  cannot  prove  the
elements of the underlying tort against all of the actors, she can still
impose a joint liability for the harm done through resort to the concert
of  action  doctrine.  In  the  Shinn  case,  the  defendant  had  moved  for
summary judgment on the basis of a no duty argument — that he had
no  duty  to  the  plaintiff  for  the  negligent  operation  of  the  car  by  the
drunken  acquaintance.  Plaintiff  responded  to  this  argument  by
pointing to the concert of action doctrine as a basis for maintaining
the  lawsuit  against  the  passenger.  Why  did  the  court  reject  the
possible  application  of  the  concert  of  action  doctrine  in  Shinn  but

determine  in  Herman  that  the  plaintiff  presented  a  jury  question?  If
you could change one fact in Shinn that might change the outcome,
which fact would it be?

3. Problems.   Would  Restatement  §876  concert  of  action  liability
apply  in  the  following  scenarios?  Which  provision  would  provide  the
best argument in each case?

A. Two teenage boys each pull up to a red light late at night. They
each  start  revving  their  engines  in  an  apparent  challenge  to  a
street  race.  As  the  light  turns  green,  both  cars  speed  into  the

that car has no assets or insurance. Can the other driver be held

B. A crowd of people gathers on a street corner around a potential

yells  to  the  victor,  “give  him  another  kick  to  be  sure  he’s  not
going to get back up and continue!” Others in the crowd join in
the refrain of “Kick him! Kick him!” Giving in to the peer pressure,
the victorious ﬁghter kicks the loser, fracturing several ribs and
puncturing  the  other  boy’s  lung.  Can  the  beaten  boy  sue
members of the crowd as well as the victorious ﬁghter?

KUBERT v. BEST
432 N.J. Super. 495 (N.J. App. 2013)

       , J.

Plaintiffs  Linda  and  David  Kubert  were  grievously  injured  by  an
eighteen-year-old  driver  who  was  texting  while  driving  and  crossed
the  center-line  of  the  road.  Their  claims  for  compensation  from  the
young driver have been settled and are no longer part of this lawsuit.
Plaintiffs appeal the trial court’s dismissal of their claims against the

driver’s seventeen-year-old friend who was texting the driver much of
the  day  and  sent  a  text  message  to  him  immediately  before  the
accident.

New  Jersey  prohibits  texting  while  driving.  A  statute  under  our
motor  vehicle  laws  makes  it  illegal  to  use  a  cell  phone  that  is  not
“hands-free”  while  driving,  except  in  certain  speciﬁcally-described
emergency  situations.  For  future  cases  like  this  one,  the  State
Legislature enacted a law, called the “Kulesh, Kubert, and Bolis Law,”
to provide criminal penalties for those who are distracted by use of a
cell phone while driving and injure others.

The issue before us is not directly addressed by these statutes or
any  case  law  that  has  been  brought  to  our  attention.  We  must
determine  as  a  matter  of  civil  common  law  whether  one  who  is
texting from a location remote from the driver of a motor vehicle can
be liable to persons injured because the driver was distracted by the
text.

On the afternoon of September 21, 2009, David Kubert was riding
his motorcycle, with his wife, Linda Kubert, riding as a passenger. As
they came south around a curve on Hurd Street in Mine Hill Township,
a  pick-up  truck  being  driven  north  by  eighteen-year-old  Kyle  Best
crossed the double-center line of the roadway into their lane of travel.
David Kubert attempted to evade the pick-up truck but could not. The
front  driver’s  side  of  the  truck  struck  the  Kuberts  and  their
motorcycle. The collision severed, or nearly severed, David’s left leg. It
shattered  Linda’s  left  leg,  leaving  her  fractured  thighbone  protruding
out of the skin as she lay injured in the road.

Best stopped his truck, saw the severity of the injuries, and called
911.  The  time  of  the  911  call  was  17:49:15,  that  is,  ﬁfteen  seconds
after  5:49  p.m.  Best,  a  volunteer  ﬁreman,  aided  the  Kuberts  to  the
best of his ability until the police and emergency medical responders
arrived. Medical treatment could not save either victim’s leg. Both lost
their left legs as a result of the accident.

After  the  Kuberts  ﬁled  this  lawsuit,  their  attorney  developed
evidence  to  prove  Best’s  activities  on  the  day  of  the  accident.  In
September  2009,  Best  and  Colonna  were  seeing  each  other  socially
but  not  exclusively;
they  were  not  boyfriend  and  girlfriend.
Nevertheless, they texted each other many times each day. Best’s cell
phone  record  showed  that  he  and  Colonna  texted  each  other  sixty-
two times on the day of the accident, about an equal number of texts
originating from each.

The accident occurred about four or ﬁve minutes after Best began
driving  home  from  the  YMCA  [where  he  worked].  At  his  deposition,
Best testiﬁed that he did not text while driving — meaning that it was
not his habit to text when he was driving. He testiﬁed falsely at ﬁrst
that he did not text when he began his drive home from the YMCA on
the  day  of  the  accident.  But  he  was  soon  confronted  with  the
telephone  records,  which  he  had  seen  earlier,  and  then  he  admitted
that he and Colonna exchanged text messages within minutes of his
beginning to drive.

The  sequence  of  texts  between  Best  and  Colonna  indicates  the
precise  time  of  the  accident — within  seconds  of  5:48:58.  Seventeen
seconds elapsed from Best’s sending a text to Colonna and the time
of  the  911  call  after  the  accident.  Those  seconds  had  to  include
Best’s stopping his vehicle, observing the injuries to the Kuberts, and
dialing 911. It appears, therefore, that Best collided with the Kuberts’
motorcycle  immediately  after  sending  a  text  at  5:48:58.  It  can  be
inferred  that  he  sent  that  text  in  response  to  Colonna’s  text  to  him
that  he  received  twenty-ﬁve  seconds  earlier.  Finally,  it  appears  that
Best initiated the texting with Colonna as he was about to and after
he began to drive home.

Missing from the evidence is the content of the text messages.
After plaintiffs learned of Colonna’s involvement and added her to
their lawsuit, she moved for summary judgment. Her attorney argued
to the trial court that Colonna had no liability for the accident because

she was not present at the scene, had no legal duty to avoid sending
a text to Best when he was driving, and further, that she did not know
he  was  driving.  [The  trial  judge  granted  the  motion,  dismissing  the
claims against Colonna.]

In this case, plaintiffs argue that a duty of care should be imposed
upon Colonna because she aided and abetted Best’s violation of the
law  when  he  used  his  cell  phone  while  driving.  To  support  their
argument, plaintiffs cite §876 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, a
compilation  of  common  law  principles.  Under  §876,  an  individual  is
liable if he or she knows that another person’s “conduct constitutes a
breach of duty and gives substantial assistance or encouragement to
the other.”

To illustrate this concept, the Restatement provides the following

hypothetical example:

A  and  B  participate  in  a  riot  in  which  B,  although  throwing  no  rocks  himself,
encourages  A  to  throw  rocks.  One  of  the  rocks  strikes  C,  a  bystander.  B  is
subject to liability to C.

Restatement §876, comment d, ill. 4.

The example illustrates that one does not actually have to be the
person who threw a rock to be liable for injury caused by the rock. In
Tarr  v.  Ciasulli,  853  A.2d  921  (N.J.  2004),  the  New  Jersey  Supreme
Court adopted the principle stated in Restatement §876 as applicable
to  determine  joint  liability  when  persons  act  in  concert  and  cause
harm to another.

In this case, plaintiffs assert that Colonna and Best were acting in
concert  in  exchanging  text  messages.  Although  Colonna  was  at  a
remote  location  from  the  site  of  the  accident,  plaintiffs  say  she  was
“electronically present” in Best’s pick-up truck immediately before the
accident  and  she  aided  and  abetted  his  unlawful  use  of  his  cell
phone.

In  Champion  ex  rel.  Ezzo  v.  Dunfee,  939  A.2d  825  (N.J.  App.
2008),  we  analyzed  §876  in  a  context  where  the  defendant  was

actually present at the site of the accident. In Champion, the injured
plaintiff was a backseat passenger in a car driven by a friend who had
been drinking. The driver’s girlfriend was also a passenger in the car,
sitting in the front seat. The car approached speeds of 100 miles per
hour  as  the  driver  tried  to  prove  the  performance  capabilities  of  his
car.  The  car  hit  a  bump  and  crashed,  severely  injuring  the  backseat
passenger.  He  sued  the  driver,  and  subsequently,  added  the  driver’s
girlfriend as a defendant in his lawsuit on a theory that she had a duty
to prevent her boyfriend from driving because she knew he had been
drinking.

We  reviewed  common  law  precedents  from  other  jurisdictions
where  passengers  in  a  car  had  encouraged  the  driver  to  consume
alcohol or drugs or otherwise to drive dangerously, and we compared
those  precedents  to  others  where  the  passengers  were  present  but
neither encouraged nor prevented the negligent conduct of the driver.
We  concluded  that  the  law  permits  recovery  against  a  passenger
under  two  conditions.  One  is  a  “special  relationship”  that  gave  the
passenger  control  over  the  driver’s  conduct,  such  as  an  employer-
employee  or  parent-child  relationship.  The  second  is  “that  the
defendant  passenger  actively encouraged  the  driver  to  commit”  the
negligent act. Mere failure to prevent wrongful conduct by another is
ordinarily not sufﬁcient to impose liability. In Champion, the girlfriend
could  not  be  held  liable  merely  for  failing  to  prevent  her  boyfriend’s
negligent driving.

In this case, Colonna did not have a special relationship with Best
by  which  she  could  control  his  conduct.  Nor  is  there  evidence  that
she actively encouraged him to text her while he was driving. Colonna
sent  two  texts  to  Best  in  the  afternoon  of  September  21,  2009,  one
about  two  hours  and  the  second  about  twenty-ﬁve  seconds  before
the  accident.  What  she  said  in  those  texts  is  unknown.  Even  if  a
reasonable inference can be drawn that she sent messages requiring
responses, the act of sending such messages, by itself, is not active

encouragement  that  the  recipient  read  the  text  and  respond
immediately, that is, while driving and in violation of the law.

Principles
Regarding §876 (a) and (b)’s
varieties of concert of action
liability, one commentator
described them as follows:

The  ﬁrst  variety  is  indistinguishable

Another  case  decided  by
this court, Podias v. Mairs, 926
A.2d 859 (N.J. App. 2007), also
provides  some  guidance  on
liability  of  a  passenger  for
aiding  and  abetting  a  driver’s
wrongful  conduct.  In  Podias,
we  reviewed  claims  against
two  passengers  who  were
present when an eighteen-year-

We  reviewed  Restatement  §876  and  held  that  the  passengers
could be found liable for giving “substantial assistance” to the driver

in failing to fulﬁll his legal duty to remain at the scene of the accident
and to notify the police. We found “an aiding and abetting theory” to
be viable because the passengers had taken “afﬁrmative steps in the
immediate  aftermath  [of  the  accident]  to  conceal  their  involvement”
and to encourage the driver’s violation of the law.

Unlike  the  facts  of  Podias,  the  evidence  in  this  case  is  not
sufﬁcient  for  a  jury  to  conclude  that  Colonna  took  afﬁrmative  steps
and gave substantial assistance to Best in violating the law. Plaintiffs
produced  no  evidence  tending  to  show  that  Colonna  urged  Best  to
read and respond to her text while he was driving.

The  evidence  available  to  plaintiffs  is  not  sufﬁcient  to  prove
Colonna’s  liability  to  the  Kuberts  on  the  basis  of  aiding  and  abetting
Best’s negligent driving while using a cell phone.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Separating Causation from Liability.  In Kubert, there was at least
inferential evidence that the driver of the pick-up truck was distracted
by receiving and sending text messages with his friend Colonna. This
should provide sufﬁcient evidence that defendant Colonna was a but-
for  cause  of  the  accident — that  without  her  sending  text  messages
to  the  driver  moments  before  the  accident,  he  would  not  have  been
distracted  and  struck  the  plaintiffs  on  their  motorcycle.  But  merely
being a cause of harm does not sufﬁce to impose liability. One avenue
of possible attack was to argue that the defendant Colonna had  her
own  independent  duty  of  reasonable  care  to  prevent  another  driver
from texting while driving. But the plaintiff’s primary efforts to impose
involved  utilizing  the  concert  of  action  theory  from
liability
Restatement §876. The appellate court afﬁrmed the trial court’s grant
of summary judgment, rejecting the application of this doctrine under
the  facts  of  the  case.  What  evidence  was  missing  that  would  have
permitted  the  doctrine  to  apply  to  Colonna?  Do  you  agree  with  the

court’s  use  of  the  Podias  and  Champion  cases  to  explain  its
decision?

2. Problem.  Would any of the three varieties of concert of action
liability embodied in §876 apply in the following scenario? Juanita is a
sophomore in college and a close college friend of hers, Frederick, is
hanging  out  with  Juanita  at  her  apartment  one  afternoon.  Juanita
demonstrates  to  Frederick  how  she  is  able  to  download  music  for
free  from  a  questionable  website.  She  advises  Frederick  that,  even
though  it  is  not  legal,  there  is  no  way  they  would  ever  get  caught
doing  it.  Frederick  goes  home  that  night  and  begins  downloading
hundreds  of  pirated  songs  from  the  website.  The  owner  of  the
copyright on the songs eventually discovers the identity of Frederick.
The  owner  also  wants  to  sue  Juanita  under  §876  for  her  role  in
Frederick’s conversion of its music.

2. Extent of Liability for Acting in Concert

When one is cheering on the commission of a tort that is taking place
immediately in full view, it seems reasonable to hold the one acting in
concert  fully  liable  for  the  harm  caused.  But  what  if  the  one  that  is
acting  in  concert  does  not  know  about  some  of  the  primary
tortfeasor’s  conduct  and  does  not  know  about  the  full  extent  of  the
harms being caused by the others involved? Is it fair to hold all of the
actors  fully  liable  for  the  full  extent  of  the  harms?  The  Grim  case
below discusses the extent of one’s liability when found to be acting
in concert with other tortfeasors who cause harms.

AMERICAN FAMILY MUT. INS. CO. v. GRIM
440 P.2d 621 (Kan. 1968)

 ’      , J.

This  is  a  subrogation  action  by  the  American  Family  Mutual
Insurance Company (plaintiff) to recover from a thirteen-year-old boy
(defendant)  a  portion  of  a  ﬁre  loss  paid  to  the  Derby  Methodist
Church,  the  company’s  insured,  as  the  result  of  a  ﬁre  occurring
August  16,  1965.  Following  a  trial  without  a  jury,  the  lower  court
entered judgment in favor of the insurance company, and defendant
has appealed.

The  issues  raised  on  appeal  relate  to  the  sufﬁciency  of  the

evidence and the liability of the defendant as a joint tortfeasor.

On  the  evening  of  August  15,  1965,  the  defendant  and  three
companions, ages thirteen and fourteen, gathered at the home of one
of the boys to spend the night. They planned to sleep in the backyard
in sleeping bags, as they had done several times previously during the
summer. About ten o’clock the four lads decided to go downtown to a
ﬁlling  station  to  get  some  Cokes.  They  left  the  yard  through  a  back
gate  and  proceeded  down  the  alley.  The  home  was  located  about
three houses south of the church, and as they passed the church, one
of  the  boys  remarked  that  Cokes  were  kept  in  a  refrigerator  in  the
kitchen and maybe they could get some there.

The  boys  entered  the  building  through  the  unlocked  door  of  the
main entrance to the sanctuary, which is the east wing of the church.
The  kitchen  is  located  in  the  north  part  of  the  west  wing.  [The  boys
went  to  the  west  wing  and  found  the  kitchen  doors  locked.  They
began to look for other ways into the kitchen.] The defendant and his
three  companions  .  .  .  went  into  the  furnace  room  located  on  the
south side of the west wing. From here two of the boys went up into
the  attic  through  a  trap  door  that  opened  into  the  area  above  the
hallway.  The  defendant  and  his  other  companion  remained  behind.
Upon  entering  the  attic,  the  two  boys  found  some  paper  material
which, without the defendant’s knowledge, they rolled up, lighted with
a match, and used as torches to light their way. As the torches burned
down  during  the  search  in  the  attic,  the  two  boys  extinguished  one
over  the  hallway  area  and  the  second  over  the  area  north  of  the

hallway  into  which  they  had  gained  admittance  through  a  small
opening in the wall. One torch was extinguished by “stomping” it on a
board  lying  across  the  rafters;  the  other  burned  rapidly  and  was
permitted  to  fall  between  the  rafters  onto  the  ceiling.  [T]he  two
youths, believing the torches to be fully extinguished, left the attic and
descended to the furnace room. From the time the two boys entered
the attic until they returned to the furnace room the defendant was in
the hallway obtaining a drink at the water fountain.

The  four  youths  then  left  the  church  through  the  same  door  by
which they had entered and proceeded to a ﬁlling station where they
drank  Cokes.  After  walking  around  for  a  while,  they  returned  to  their
sleeping bags around midnight. In the early morning hours of August
16  the  church  was  discovered  to  be  on  ﬁre,  and  the  local  ﬁre
department  was  called  to  the  scene.  When  the  ﬁremen  arrived  they
found extensive ﬁre, with smoke coming out from under the eaves of
the building and through the roof at one point on the south side of the
west  wing.  Defendant  and  his  three  companions  were  awakened
about 5:00 a.m. by the ﬁre alarm activity and went over to the church
to help remove Boy Scout equipment from a storage room located in
the southeast corner of the east wing.

The  trial  court  found  that  the  ﬁre  was  started  as  a  result  of  the
torches,  either  one  or  both,  that  were  lighted  in  the  attic;  that  the
cause  of  the  ﬁre  was  the  lighting  of  the  torches  and  the  attempt  to
extinguish  them;  that  defendant  knew  nothing  about  the  lighting  of
the torches, but that he and the other three boys were in the church,
and two of the boys were in the attic, for the purpose of attempting to
ﬁnd  an  entrance  into  the  kitchen  in  order  to  get,  or  attempt  to  get,
Cokes therefrom. The court concluded that defendant was jointly and
severally  liable,  and  entered  judgment  for  the  plaintiff  insurance
company in the sum of $25,000.

Defendant vigorously argues he cannot be held liable, either jointly
or  severally,  for  the  damage  caused  by  the  ﬁre.  He  observes  there
was no evidence his companions had any discussion with him about

using  torches  and  the  trial  court  speciﬁcally  found  that  he  knew
nothing  about  the  lighting  of  the  torches  in  the  attic.  Although
plaintiff’s  petition  recites,  “Defendant  and  three  other  persons
engaged in a joint venture,” it appears the case was actually tried and
submitted without objection to the lower court on the theory that the
four  boys  were  jointly  engaged  in  the  commission  of  an  unlawful
tortious  act — gaining  entrance  to  the  kitchen  in  order  to  obtain
Cokes — and all were liable as joint tort feasors for any wrongful act
done in attempting to accomplish their objective.

One who aids, abets and encourages others in the commission of
an unlawful act is guilty as a principal, and all are jointly and severally
liable  in  a  civil  action  for  any  damages  that  may  have  resulted  from
their act. Defendant argues this rule does not apply, because he had
nothing to do with the use of the torches, nor did he know they were
being  used.  The  weakness  of  his  argument  lies  in  defendant’s
disregard of the fact the torches were used in the four boys’ attempt
to carry out their original unlawful plan.

The rule of joint and several liability . . . prevails where tortfeasors
act in concert in the execution of a common purpose. The tort liability
of  persons  acting  in  concert  is  expressed  in  the  Restatement  of  the
Law of Torts, §876:

For  harm  resulting  to  a  third  person  from  the  tortious  conduct  of

another, a person is liable if he. . . .

(b) knows that the others conduct constitutes a breach of duty and
gives  substantial  assistance  or  encouragement  to  the  other  so  to
conduct himself.

Germane to our case is the comment [to subsection (b)] that a person
who  encourages  another  to  commit  a  tortious  act  may  also  be
responsible  for  other  foreseeable  acts  done  by  such  other  person  in
connection with the intended act. To illustrate the point, the following
example is given:

A  and  B  conspire  to  burglarize  C’s  safe.  B,  who  is  the  active  burglar,  after
entering  the  house  and  without  A’s  knowledge  of  his  intention  to  do  so,  burns
the  house  in  order  to  conceal  the  burglary.  A  is  liable  to  C,  not  only  for  the
conversion of the contents of the safe, but also for the destruction of the house.

A  fortiori,  the  same  result  would  obtain  had  B  negligently  set  ﬁre  to
the house while using a match or torch to ﬁnd the safe.

Here,  the  boys  entered  the  church  for  the  common  purpose  of
obtaining Cokes from the kitchen. Finding their way thwarted by the
locked door, the boys sought a means of entry through the attic to an
area over the kitchen where entrance could be accomplished through
the ceiling. In their attempt to reach that area, the need for adequate
lighting  could  reasonably  be  anticipated.  The  use  of  the  torches
served  that  purpose.  From  the  time  the  boys  entered  the  church  to
the  time  of  departure,  defendant  was  more  than  an  innocent
bystander.  Although  he  actually  did  not  enter  the  attic  or  have
anything to do with the use of the torches, there was evidence from
which  it  could  be  inferred  that  he  actively  participated  and  lent
encouragement  and  cooperation  to  the  successful  accomplishment
of  their  over-all  mission.  At  no  time  did  he  make  any  attempt  to
withdraw from participation in the agreed-on objective or plan. In fact,
it  would  appear  he  intended  to  reap  the  same  beneﬁts,  once  the
mission was completed, as would be forthcoming to his companions.

The judgment is afﬁrmed.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Basis  for  Liability.   The  trial  and  appellate  courts  in  Grim
reference  Restatement  §876(b)  as  the  basis  for  ﬁnding  that  the
defendant  had  acted  in  concert  with  the  other  boys  who  negligently
set ﬁre to the church. Can you make an argument that §876(a) could
also apply to this factual scenario?

2.  Liability  Limited  by  Foreseeability.   As  we  have  seen  in  many
other  instances  in  the  law  of  torts,  the  court  adopts  a  rule  of
foreseeability in order to limit the potential liability of one found to be
acting in concert. Exactly what must the defendant foresee in order to
be fully liable for all of the resulting harms? Did the defendant in Grim
have  any  ideas  that  the  other  members  of  the  group  were  going  to
use  torches?  If  not,  what  did  the  defendant  foresee  that  the  court
found to be sufﬁcient?

3. Problems.
A.  Multiple  manufacturers  of  the  drug  DES  employ  an  identical
formula for their drug and market it as safe for use in pregnant
women. When it is revealed that the drug causes birth defects,
may the plaintiffs employ the concert of action doctrine to hold
them  all  jointly  liable  (and  thus  avoid  potentially  difﬁcult  issues
of
identifying  which  manufacturer  actually  caused  each
plaintiff’s harm)? What did the court say about this in Sindell v.
Abbott Laboratories?

B. Recall the Wawanesa Mutual Ins. v. Matlock case from Chapter
4,  Negligence:  Breach  of  Duty  of  Reasonable  Care.  Timothy
purchased  cigarettes  for  the  younger  Eric  and  together  they
trespassed  on  the  Woodman  Pole  Company’s  lot,  smoking  and
roughhousing  atop  a  large  stack  of  wooden  telephone  poles.
This  led  to  an  accidental  ﬁre  and  the  loss  of  $100,000  in
property. Could Timothy have been considered jointly liable with
Eric due to the concert of action doctrine?

Upon Further Review

Even  in  a  world  of  several  liability,  courts  still  employ  the
equitable doctrines of vicarious liability and concert of action to
create joint liability against one for the misconduct of another. In
each  instance,  the  victim  is  permitted  to  sue  either  the  primary

tortfeasors,  the  deeper  pockets  employing  the  tortfeasors,  or
both.  Though  these  doctrines  have  different  conceptual  bases
for  their  utilization,  they  operate  in  similar  ways  and  ultimately
for the similar purpose of permitting a victim to be more likely to
have  a  full  recovery.  Further,  when  joint  liability  attaches  to  one
for  the  misconduct  of  another,  a  right  to  indemniﬁcation  will  be
created so that ultimately the risk of loss might be borne by the
direct tortfeasor.

Pulling It All Together

HomeResource, Inc. is in the business of supplying home health
nurses to elderly homebound patients. The company screens the
nurses by conﬁrming their degree and credentials and running a
criminal records history on their candidates. The nurses receive
as  compensation  an  hourly  rate  tied  to  whatever  amount  the
elderly  patients’  insurers  agree  to  reimburse  for  their  time.
HomeResource  keeps  the  balance  to  offset
its  operating
expenses  and  proﬁts.  The  nurses  they  provide  to  the  patients
use  their  own  vehicles  and  all  of  their  own  equipment  (scrubs,
gloves,  stethoscope,  etc.).  The  company  does  perform  periodic
in-home checks on patients and also checks the record-keeping
practices  of  the  nurses  to  ensure  they  conform  to  industry
standards.

HomeResource  hired  Jillian  as  a  new  home  health  nurse.
They  checked  her  educational  and  licensing  records  but  never
got around to checking her criminal record — they missed a prior
conviction  she  had  in  another  state  for  theft  of  a  dwelling.
HomeResouce  assigned  Jillian  to  work  with  an  elderly  man
named  Trent  who  was  suffering  the  early  stages  of  dementia
and  had  limited  mobility.  She  worked  in  Trent’s  home  full-time,
Monday  through  Friday  during  the  daytime.  During  the  three
months she worked there she began stealing cash from Trent, as
well  as  jewelry  (watches,  primarily,  and  a  few  gold  chains),  and
taking blank checks and using them to pay some of her personal
expenses.  Trent  had  many  indications  of  these  missing  items
but he did not want to believe that Jillian would do such a thing.
He  also  ignored  his  bank  statements  for  those  three  months,
which  showed  the  illicit  check-writing  activities  of  Jillian.  When
Trent’s adult daughter was visiting, she looked at one of Trent’s
bank  statements  and  discovered  Jillian’s  illicit  activities.  Jillian
was arrested. Trent hired a lawyer who sued HomeResource, Inc.
and Jillian. He sued Jillian for conversion with losses of $10,000.
He also alleged emotional distress and said he could never trust
another  nurse  again.  He  alleged  HomeResource  was  liable  as
her  employer  and  also  that  it  was  negligent  in  hiring  and
supervising her activities.

The case went to trial and the jury found in favor of Trent and
against HomeResource and Jillian on all legal theories. The jury
found actual damages of $60,000 ($10,000 in stolen items and
$50,000  in  emotional  distress  related  to  the  loss  of  property).
The
jury  also  found  punitive  damages  against  Jillian  for
$250,000.  The  jury  apportioned  fault  as  follows:  Jillian,  50
percent;  HomeResource,  25  percent;  and  Trent,  25  percent.  The
state has a statute providing that a plaintiff found to be at fault is
still  permitted  to  recover  “so  long  as  the  claimant’s  fault  is  less
than the fault of the person against whom they seek to recover.

2. Prior to trial, the trial court had overruled the plaintiff’s motion in limine asking
that  the  negligent  conduct  of  the  defendant  not  be  compared  with  the  intentional
act of Williams. At trial there was no allegation or proof that the plaintiff herself was
negligent in any way.

negligent  defendant  may  be  entitled  to  contribution  or  indemnity  from  the
intentional actor. See Restatement of Restitution, §§94 and 97.

something the law determines involves non-reciprocal dangers. That
is, the defendant has chosen to be involved in an activity that creates
unique and signiﬁcant risks for others; this choice demands that the
defendant, in essence, act as an insurer for victims.

Strict liability in tort was historically reserved for harms caused by
a  defendant’s  wild  animals  or  unusually  dangerous  activities.  In  this
chapter, we will study strict liability by reviewing cases involving these
two  categories  of  strict  liability.  In  each  category,  note  exactly  what
the defendant must do to subject itself to liability without a showing
of  negligence.  We  will  also  discuss  how  strict

fundamentally  different  from  a  traditional,  fault-based  approach  to

hurt  today  by  wild  animals  and  by  defendants’  unusually  dangerous
activities, but also because this form of strict liability was the genesis
for the concept of strict liability for defective products — the topic we
take up next in Chapter 11.

II  UNUSUALLY DANGEROUS ACTIVITIES

Modern  common  law  abandoned  a  requirement  for  proving  fault  in
cases  involving  unusually  dangerous  activities,  beginning  in  the
nineteenth-century English case of Rylands v. Fletcher.  In  that  case,
the  defendants  constructed  a  reservoir  on  land  located  above  some
vacant mine shafts. As the reservoir began to ﬁll with water, it burst
through  one  of  these  mine  shafts,  flooding  the  plaintiff’s  adjacent
property. The defendants were unaware of the shafts, and there was
no negligence proven against them. Nevertheless, the court found the
defendants  liable  due  to  the  nature  of  their  activity  and  despite  the
lack  of  fault.  The  court  stated  that  “the  true  rule  of  law  is,  that  the
person  who  for  his  own  purposes  brings  on  his  lands  and  collects
and keeps there anything likely to do mischief if it escapes must keep
it in at his peril, and, if he does not do so, is prima facie answerable
for  all  the  damage  which  is  the  natural  consequence  of  its  escape.”

appeal,  Lord  Cairns
liability  based  upon  the
defendant’s  “non-natural  use”  of  the  land.  This  holding  has  generally
been  accepted  in  the  United  States  in  the  form  of  courts  imposing
strict  liability  on  “ultrahazardous”  and  “extraordinary”  activities.  See,
e.g., Ainsworth v. Lakin, 180 Mass. 397 (Mass. 1902).

imposed  strict

When strict liability is found to apply to an activity, the defendant
is liable for all of the harmful consequences of the activity regardless
of  how  much  care  was  employed  to  avoid  the  harm.  The  major
question  involves  the  type  of  activities  for  which  the  doctrine  will
apply.  The  Exner  case  below  involves  the  defendant’s  storage  of
blasting  materials.  Courts  have  had  little  difﬁculty  determining  that
blasting  activities  involve  “unusual  and  extraordinary”  conduct.  But
pay  attention  to  the  rationale  behind  the  application  of  strict  liability
as well as the difference between this claim and one for negligence.

EXNER v. SHERMAN POWER CONST. CO.
54 F.2d 510 (2d Cir. 1931)

 .     , J.

This  is  an  action  in  tort,  brought  by  Delia  H.  Exner  to  recover
damages to her person, property, and business which were caused by
the  explosion  of  dynamite  kept  by  the  defendant  company  in
connection  with  work  upon  a  hydroelectric  development  at  Bellows
Falls,  Vt.,  in  which  it  was  engaged.  The  plaintiff  Frederick  Exner,  the
husband  of  Delia  H.  Exner,  was  joined  as  a  plaintiff  because  he
sought to recover damages for injuries to his marital rights.

The defendant kept dynamite in a small hut on the westerly bank
of  the  Connecticut  River  located  conveniently  to  its  work.  This  hut
was  approximately  935  feet  from  the  dwelling  of  the  plaintiffs,  in
which they rented rooms and apartments and carried on a restaurant
and  lunchroom.  The  dynamite  hut  was  located  close  to  a  thickly
settled  part  of  Bellows  Falls,  and  within  ﬁfty  rods  of  ﬁve  dwelling
houses, a hotel, several factories, and business buildings belonging to
persons other than the plaintiffs.

Mildred  Wolfel,  one  of  defendant’s  witnesses,  who  observed  the
explosion from the New Hampshire side of the river, 300 or 400 feet
from where it occurred, said that she saw two men coming out of the
dynamite  hut  carrying  boxes;  that  she  saw  a  flash  and  a  ball  of  ﬁre
and then another flash, and experienced an explosion so severe as to
throw  her  across  the  road.  The  hut  was  blown  to  atoms  by  the
explosions, and three men engaged in getting the cases of dynamite
to take down to the place along the river where the blasting was to be
done were killed.

There was evidence that Mrs. Exner, the plaintiff, who was in bed
in her house at the time of the explosion, was thrown out of bed and
received injuries, that her house was so badly shattered as to require

extensive repairs, and that her business was damaged. The accident
occurred on February 18, 1928.

The  principal  storehouse  of  the  dynamite  was  on  the  eastern  or
New Hampshire side of the river. From that, dynamite was brought in
an automobile across the bridge and placed in the hut to be warmed
so  as  to  be  in  condition  for  use  when  needed  for  blasting.  Evidence
was introduced that twenty cases of dynamite, weighing ﬁfty pounds
each,  were  sent  from  the  storehouse  across  the  river  to  the  hut  the
day before the explosion, and that three such cases were still on hand
in the hut before the additional twenty cases were brought to it. There
was evidence that after the explosion one of the witnesses picked up
as  much  as  two  ﬁfty-pound  cases  of  unexploded  dynamite  at  the
scene of the explosion and found four or ﬁve more in a tool box thirty
to  ﬁfty  feet  from  the  hut.  The  general  foreman  of  the  defendant
testiﬁed that about one thousand pounds of dynamite were ordinarily
required  for  daily  use  in  blasting,  but  on  some  days  when  the
company was not doing much drilling much less than one thousand
pounds would be used.

The defendant’s president testiﬁed that there was no place where
the  dynamite  hut  could  be  located  that  would  be  accessible  to  the
work  that  would  not  be  within  ﬁfty  rods  from  an  inhabited  dwelling,
and,  if  it  had  been  placed  beyond  that  limit,  the  dynamite  would
necessarily have been too cold for use before it reached the job and
would have been carried more frequently than was the case through
the streets of Bellows Falls, to the greater peril of the inhabitants. He
also  said  that  the  hut  was  adopted  as  a  place  to  store  a  supply  of
dynamite for daily use after a hearing before the deputy ﬁre marshal
of the state, and with his consent.

There  is  a  statute  of  Vermont  (Rev.  Laws  1880,  §4323),  the
consideration  of  which  is  involved  in  this  case,  which  reads  as
follows:

Keeping  Explosives.  A  person  who  keeps  or  suffers  to  be  kept  upon  premises
owned or occupied by him, within ﬁfty rods of an inhabited building of another
person,  more  than  ﬁfty  pounds  of  gunpowder  or  nitroglycerine  at  one  time,  or
more than one pound, unless contained in sound canisters of tin or other metal,
or  a  package  containing  more  than  ﬁfty  pounds  of  dynamite,  shall  be  ﬁned
twenty-ﬁve  dollars,  and  twenty-ﬁve  dollars  additional  for  each  day  that  it  is  so
kept after notice from an inhabitant of such town to remove the same.

The  plaintiffs  [alleged,  among  other  things,  that  defendant  was
liable  for  having  violated  the  statute  by  storing]  an  amount  of
dynamite  in  excess  of  ﬁfty  pounds  within  ﬁfty  rods  of  a  building
inhabited by another than the defendant.

Upon  the  case  as  submitted  to  the  jury  we  must  determine
whether,  under  section  4323,  or  under  the  common
law,  the
defendant  became  liable,  irrespective  of  any  fault,  for  the  damage
arising from the explosion.

The defendant was not, in our opinion, liable to the plaintiffs for a
violation of section 4323. It is well established that only members of a
class  to  be  beneﬁted  can  invoke  a  civil  remedy  by  reason  of  such  a
statute as we have here. The plaintiffs inhabited a dwelling more than
ﬁfty rods from the dynamite hut, and the act in terms covers only an
area  within  a  radius  of  ﬁfty  rods  from  the  place  of  storage.  It  is
impossible to see how the plaintiffs were of the class intended to be
beneﬁted  by  a  law  forbidding  storage  of  dynamite  within  an  area  in
which they were not included. The plaintiffs were not of the class to
be beneﬁted.

The  question  remains  whether  there  was  an  absolute  liability  for
the damage caused by the explosion at common law. We may say at
the outset that we have been referred to nothing relevant as to this in
the  Vermont  decisions,  but  they  would  not  control  in  any  event,
because  the  matter  is  one  in  which  we  are  at  liberty  to  gather  the
principle to be applied from the general ﬁeld of jurisprudence.

Dynamite  is  of  the  class  of  elements  which  one  who  stores  or
uses  in  such  a  locality,  or  under  such  circumstances  as  to  cause

likelihood of risk to others, stores or uses at his peril. He is an insurer,
and is absolutely liable if damage results to third persons, either from
the direct impact of rocks thrown out by the explosion (which would
be a common-law trespass) or from concussion.

For  the  reasons  already  given  in  discussing  the  Vermont  statute,
we assume that the storage of dynamite in the case at bar was not
an  act  of  which
the  plaintiffs  could  complain.  There  was
uncontradicted  proof  that  the  place  of  storage  and  the  quantities
stored  were  approved  by  the  deputy  ﬁre  marshal  of  the  state.  While
such  approval  would  be  no  protection  against  claims  of  persons
inhabiting dwellings within the prescribed zone, the plaintiffs were not
of that class and could not have enjoined the storage. The liability of
the  defendant  is  not  founded  on  illegal  storage  or  on  negligence,
which was not proved, but upon the ground that the use of dynamite
is so dangerous that it ought to be at the owners’ risk.

In  Bradford  Glycerine  Co.  v.  St.  Marys  Woolen  Mfg.  Co.,  54  N.E.
528  (Ohio),  the  defendant  manufactured  and  stored  nitroglycerine
which  exploded  and  caused  damage  to  the  plaintiff.  The  Supreme
Court of Ohio held that the defendant was liable though there was no
proof of negligence. To the same effect was the decision in French v.
Center  Creek  Powder  Mfg.  Co.,  158  S.W.  723  (Mo).  These  cases
followed  Rylands  v.  Fletcher,  L.R.  3  H.L.  330,  which  has  found
considerable explicit support in this country.

It is true that some courts have distinguished between liability for
a  common-law  trespass,  occasioned  by  blasting,  which  projects
rocks  or  debris  upon  the  property  or  the  person  of  the  plaintiff,  and
liability for so-called consequential damages arising from concussion,
and  have  denied  liability  for  the  latter  where  the  blasting  itself  was
conducted at a lawful time and place and with due care. Yet in every
practical sense there can be no difference between a blasting which
projects  rocks  in  such  a  way  as  to  injure  persons  or  property  and  a
blasting  which,  by  creating  a  sudden  vacuum,  shatters  buildings  or
knocks down people. In each case, a force is applied by means of an

element likely to do serious damage if it explodes. The distinction is
based  on  historical  differences  between  the  actions  of  trespass  and
case and, in our opinion, is without logical basis.

We  can  see  no  reason  for  imposing  a  different  liability  for  the
results of an explosion, whether the dynamite explodes when stored
or when employed in blasting. To be sure there is a greater likelihood
of  damage  from  blasting  than  from  storage,  but  in  each  case  the
explosion  arises  from  an  act  connected  with  a  business  conducted
for  proﬁt  and  fraught  with  substantial  risk  and  possibility  of  the
gravest consequences. As Justice Holmes has said in The Common
Law, p. 154: “The possibility of a great danger has the same effect as
the  probability  of  a  less  one,  and  the  law  throws  the  risk  of  the
venture on the person who introduces the peril into the community.”

Frequently  as  much  as  one  thousand  pounds  of  dynamite  were
stored  by  the  defendant  near  a  group  of  dwellings,  factories,  and  a
hotel. The fact that the explosion was severe enough to kill three men,
blow up the hut, unsettle and damage the plaintiff’s house, over nine
hundred  feet  away,  and  that  even  then,  one  hundred  pounds  of
dynamite  still  remained  unexploded,  shows  that  there  must  have
been a large amount of dynamite in or about the hut at the time of the
accident. When a person engages in such a dangerous activity, useful
though it be, he becomes an insurer.

It is argued that transportation of the dynamite through the town
in  small  quantities  would  have  increased  the  risk  to  the  public.  This
seems  to  be  true,  and  no  reason  is  shown  for  taking  such  a  course,
because  it  would  have  added  to  the  danger  without  relieving  the
defendant from absolute liability, had an explosion occurred while the
dynamite was on the way.

It  the  case  at  bar,  the  court  decided  that  the  Vermont  statute
made  the  storage  illegal  and  afforded  the  plaintiffs  a  remedy.  With
this we differ, for the reasons already stated. Nevertheless, as we hold

that the defendant acted at its own risk in storing a large amount of
dynamite at the particular locality chosen, the error was harmless.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. When Strict Liability Applies.  The principles behind strict liability
for ultrahazardous activities has since become embodied in §519 of
the  Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts:  “One  who  carries  on  an
abnormally  dangerous  activity  is  subject  to  liability  for  harm  to  the
person,  land  or  chattels  of  another  resulting  from  the  activity,
although  he  has  exercised  the  utmost  care  to  prevent  the  harm.”
Section 520 of the Restatement sets forth the following factors to be
is  abnormally
considered
dangerous:

in  determining  whether  an  activity

(a) existence of a high degree of risk of some harm to the person,

land or chattels of others;

(b) likelihood that the harm that results from it will be great;
(c)  inability  to  eliminate  the  risk  by  the  exercise  of  reasonable

care;

(d) extent to which the activity is not a matter of common usage;
(e) inappropriateness of the activity to the place where it is carried

on; and

(f) extent to which its value to the community is outweighed by its

dangerous attributes.

2. Distinction Between Defendant’s Activity and Others.  Looking at
the Restatement’s factors for imposition of strict liability, were these
present  in  Exner  when  the  defendant  chose  to  store  a  thousand
pounds  of  dynamite  close  to  town?  Notice  in  Exner  that  the  court
found liability against the defendant despite the fact that the plaintiff
had  no  theory  as  to  a  better  course  of  behavior  for  the  defendant’s
use and storage of the dynamite. Arguably, the defendant was storing

the  dynamite  in  the  way  least  likely  to  cause  harm  while  still
permitting the public works project that apparently had great value to
the  community.  Would  it  appear  the  defendant  acted  unreasonably?
Given the reasonableness of the defendant’s activity, why is it fair to
make the defendant pay the plaintiff’s damages?

3.  Other  Potential  Applications.   Some  aggressive  and  creative
lawyers have attempted to have courts impose strict liability against
manufacturers  of  guns  when  the  guns  were  later  used  to  commit
acts of violence by third parties. The argument has been that selling
guns is an unusual activity that gives rise to the risk of great harm in
society  when  used  inappropriately.  Despite  the  arguments,  courts
have  pretty  consistently  rejected  strict  liability  in  this  scenario  upon
is  not
the  premise  that  the  manufacture  and  sale  of  guns
ultrahazardous,  only  the  use  of  the  weapons.  See,  e.g.,  Martin  v.
Harrington & Richardson, Inc., 743 F.2d 1200 (7th Cir. 1984); Perkins v.
F.I.E. Corp, 762 F.2d 1250 (5th Cir. 1985).

4. Reducing the Restatement Factors to Two.   One  can  reduce  the
Restatement  (Second)’s  six  factors  into  two  key  questions  that  pay
homage to the origins of this area of the law: (a) “to what extent is the
activity  dangerous?”  and  (b)  “how  uncommon  is  the  activity?”  The
more the activity reflects an unusual degree of potential harm and is
not  carried  out  by  many  others  in  the  community,  the  more  likely
courts are to conclude that those who choose to engage in such an
unusually dangerous activity should be forced to internalize the cost
for  it  through  application  of  strict  liability.  Positive  answers  to  these
two questions evidence a dangerous, non-reciprocal risk that the law
declares  should  impose  liability  when  the  risks  are  realized.  Indeed,
the Restatement (Third) of Torts §20 reduces the six factors down to
these  two,  inquiring  only  as  to  an  activity’s  risks  and  whether  it  is  a
matter  of  “common  usage.”  The  only  additional  factor  from  the
Second  Restatement  that  does  not  fall  neatly  into  either  of  these
considerations is factor (f), which asks about the value of the activity
to  the  community.  Courts  were  very  mixed  in  applying  this  last

consideration,  unclear  as  to  whether  the  activity’s  high  value  should
insulate  the  actor  from  liability  or  whether  its  high  value  means  the
actor  should  be  able  to  afford  to  pay  for  its  true  costs  on  the
community. In other words, if the activity has signiﬁcant value, those
carrying  it  out  should  be  able  to  charge  higher  prices  to  absorb  the
costs  imposed  by  strict  liability.  However,  others  argue  that  if  the
activity has great value, imposing strict liability should be avoided for
fear  of  chilling  an  important  activity.  The  Third  Restatement  drops
this ﬁnal consideration altogether.

Judge August Hand

5. Famous Jurists.  If you were attentive in your reading, you might
have  noticed  that  the  author  of  the  Exner  opinion  for  the  Second
Circuit had a familiar last name. Judge Augustus Noble Hand was the
older  ﬁrst  cousin  of  our  ubiquitous  Judge  Learned  Hand.  Judge
Augustus  Hand  was  perhaps  known  most  for  his  decision  in  1934
declaring that the sale of contraceptives to physicians for use by their

patients  did  not  involve  any  immoral  or  obscene  devices.  United
States v. One Package, 86 F.2d 737 (2d Cir. 1934).

6.  Problems.   Using  the  Restatement  (Second)  factors,  should  a

court apply strict liability in the following circumstances?

A. Every Halloween, Defendant sets up and runs a haunted house
in which customers walk through a darkened facility with creepy,
costumed  characters  that  jump  out  and  chase  the  customers.
One  customer  trips  and  falls  while  being  chased  through  the
dark facility, suffering a broken leg.

B.  Defendant  conducts  public  ﬁreworks  displays,  typically  on  the
4th  of  July,  in  public  places  such  as  parks,  stadiums,  or
riverfront  properties.  During  one  display,  for  unknown  reasons,
one  of  the  cannons  misﬁres  and  causes  the  ﬁrework  to  blast
horizontally into a crowd. Plaintiff suffers severe burns.

C.  Defendant  operates  a  driving  range  for  golfers  adjacent  to  a
roadway, which has a large volume of trafﬁc. Golfers frequently
hit  bad  golf  shots  that  veer  onto  the  road.  Plaintiff  is  driving  a
convertible down this road when he is hit by an errant golf shot
in his eye that causes partial blindness.

D.  Defendant  runs  a  shipping  line  and  is  unwittingly  transporting
nitroglycerin  in  an  unmarked  crate.  Upon  arriving  at  the  port  in
San Francisco, the defendant discovers a leak coming from the
crate and, upon taking a hammer to the crate to open it, causes
a  massive  explosion  that  kills  nearby  people  and  destroys
buildings.

III  WILD AND TRESPASSING ANIMALS

The  common  law  has  similarly  held  that  owners  or  possessors  of
animals may be strictly liable for harms caused by those animals. In
the  Byram  case  below,  the  court  outlined  three  classes  of  cases  in
which  the  owners  of  animals  are  strictly  liable.  As  you  read  this
opinion, pay close attention to why the defendant’s possession of the
animal  that  caused  the  plaintiff’s  harm  should  not  create  strict
liability.  Following  this  case,  in  Clark,  the  plaintiff  contends  that  the
animal responsible for her injuries should be declared “wild” and that
strict  liability  should  be  applied.  Note  the  alternative  arguments  the
plaintiff also employs to attempt to invoke strict liability. As you read
these cases, ask yourself what similarity there is in the law between
strict liability’s application to dangerous activities and its application
to certain animal-inflicted harms.

BYRAM v. MAIN
523 A.2d 1387 (Me. 1987)

        , J.

Defendant  Peter  Main  appeals  from  a  judgment  entered  on
August 22, 1986 in the amount of $27,483.52 for plaintiff Ray Byram.
After  a  jury-waived  trial  the  court  found  Main  strictly  liable  for
damages  to  Byram’s  tractor-trailer  rig  caused  in  the  early  morning
hours  of  July  22,  1981,  when  Byram’s  rig  struck  Meadow,  the  pet
donkey of Main’s daughter, which had escaped from its enclosure and
wandered  onto  Interstate  95  in  Orono.  The  judgment  here  on  review
was  entered  following  a  second  trial  in  this  case,  on  remand  from
plaintiff  Byram’s  earlier  appeal  to  this  court.  On  that  ﬁrst  appeal  we
held  that  the  Superior  Court  had  improperly  directed  a  verdict  for

Main  on  Byram’s  negligence  claim,  because  the  evidence  presented
by Byram concerning the adequacy of the fence used to contain the
donkey had generated a question for the jury as to Main’s negligence.
Before the second trial Byram amended his complaint to add a strict
liability count, and by stipulation of the parties the original negligence
count was dismissed with prejudice.

The  sole  issue  presented  by  this  second  appeal  is  whether  the
owner of a domestic animal that has escaped and wandered onto a
high-speed public highway is strictly liable for harm resulting from a
motor  vehicle’s  collision  with  that  animal.  Main  urges  us  that  the
Superior Court erred in relying upon Decker v. Gammon,  44  Me.  322
(1857),  as  authority  for  imposing  strict  liability  upon  him  and  that
there is no basis in common law for ﬁnding strict liability on the facts
of this case. We agree, and therefore vacate the judgment for Byram.
In  doing  so  we  adopt  for  application  to  the  present  facts  the  rule  of
liability set forth in the Restatement (Second) of Torts §518 (1977).

Decker  deﬁnes  three  classes  of  cases  in  which  the  owners  of

animals are liable for harm done by them to others:

1. The owner of wild beasts, or beasts that are in their nature vicious, is, under

all circumstances, liable for injuries done by them.

2. If domestic animals, such as oxen and horses, injure any one, . . . if they are
rightfully in the place where they do the mischief, the owner of such animals
is not liable for such injury, unless he knew that they were accustomed to do
mischief.

3.  The  owner  of  domestic  animals,  if  they  are  wrongfully  in  the  place  where
they do any mischief, is liable for it, though he had no notice that they had
been accustomed to do so before.

The  Superior  Court  found  that  the  case  at  bar  fell  within  the  third
class.

The  Superior  Court  misinterpreted  the  Decker  court’s  use  of  the
in  that  term  the  donkey’s
included
word  “wrongfully”  when
extremely  inappropriate  presence  on  the  interstate.  Viewing  Decker
against the backdrop of the common law, we read that opinion to say

it

that cases involving trespass by domestic animals are the only cases
imposing  strict  liability  encompassed  in  the  third  class.  Under
common law both in 1857 and today, an owner of a domestic animal
not known to be abnormally dangerous is strictly liable only for harms
caused by that animal while trespassing; if the animal causes harm in
a  public  place,  no  liability  is  imposed  upon  the  owner  without  a
ﬁnding  that  the  owner  was  at  fault.  Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts
§§504, 509, 518 (1977); W. Keeton, Prosser and Keeton on Torts §76,
at 538-42 (5th ed. 1984). The Decker court, in deﬁning three classes
of cases, set forth the whole common law of animal owner liability so
as to ﬁt the particular case before it into that general framework. The
holding of the Decker case was limited to its facts. The Decker court
decided  only  that  strict  liability  applies  in  a  fact  situation  that
supports  a  trespass  action.  The  1857  Law  Court  speciﬁcally  noted
that:

In  the  case  before  us,  though  the  declaration  is  not  technically  for  trespass
quare  clausum,  it  is  distinctly  alleged  that  the  defendant’s  horse,  “being  so
unlawfully  at  large,  broke  and  entered  the  plaintiff’s  close,  and  injured  the
plaintiff’s horse,” which was there peaceably and of right depasturing.

Therefore,  Decker  cannot  properly  be  interpreted  to  extend  by
dictum strict liability to harm caused by an animal in a public place. In
fact,  the  Decker  court  speciﬁcally  noted  that  “if  the  owner  puts  a
horse  or  an  ox  to  grass  in  his  ﬁeld,  and  the  horse  or  ox  breaks  the
hedge, and runs into the highway, and gores or kicks some passenger,
an action will not lie against the owner unless he had notice that they
had done such a thing before.”

We  realize  that  since  1857  radical  changes  have  occurred  in  the
nature  and  use  of  public  highways,  particularly  those  with  limited
access  and  high-speed  motor  trafﬁc.  Despite  those  changes,
however,  we  do  not  read  Decker’s  words  “wrongfully  in  the  place”  to
apply to the facts of the case at bar. The general development of the
law has not been in that direction. In fact, Decker, when its third class

is  correctly  interpreted  to  include  animal  trespass  cases  but  not
cases  where  the  animal  is  in  a  merely  inappropriate  place  when  it
causes  harm,  is  still  a  remarkably  good  statement  of  the  common
law as it remains today, as reflected by the Restatement.

Furthermore,  the  considerations  that  support  the  strict  liability
rules  in  animal  trespass  and  wild  animal  cases  do  not  apply  to  the
present  facts.  The  liability  imposed  by  courts  in  cases  described  by
the third Decker category and by section 504 of the Restatement and
the  comments  following  developed  as  an  extension  of  liability  for
trespass  by  persons;  the  possessor  of  a  domestic  animal  was
identiﬁed  with  the  animal,  so  that  when  it  trespassed  the  owner
trespassed. Prosser and Keeton on Torts §76, at 539. The imposition
of  strict  liability  for  trespass  protects  the  crucial  right  of  the
possessor of land to its exclusive use and control. Strict liability could
not serve that same purpose in the case at bar because no individual
has the right to the exclusive use and control of a public highway.

The  ﬁrst  Decker  rule,  now  set  forth  in  Restatement  (Second)  of
Torts §507, imposes strict liability for the consequences of keeping a
wild  animal,  an  activity  that,  while  not  wrongful,  exposes  the
community  to  an  obvious  abnormal  danger.7  The  keeper  of  a  wild
animal  “takes  the  risk  that  at  any  moment  the  animal  may  revert  to
and exhibit” “the dangerous propensities normal to the class to which
it  belongs.” Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts  §507  comment  c,  at  11-
12.  Nonetheless,  strict  liability  is  not  applied  to  all  damages  caused
by  wild  animals.  Even  a  wild  animal  that  goes  astray  and  causes
damage to a highway traveler in circumstances similar to those of the
case at bar would not at common law bring strict liability down upon
its keeper.

[The possessor of a wild animal] is liable for only such harm as the propensities
of the animal’s class or its known abnormal tendencies make it likely that it will
inflict. Thus if [a tame] bear, having escaped, goes to sleep in the highway and is
run  into  by  a  carefully  driven  motor  car  on  a  dark  night,  the  possessor  of  the

bear  is  not  liable  for  harm  to  the  motorist  in  the  absence  of  negligence  in  its
custody.

Id.  comment  e,  at  12.  The  rationale  for  imposing  strict  liability  upon
the owners of wild animals thus does not support applying anything
beyond a negligence rule on the facts presented to us here.

For  the  purposes  of  this  decision,  therefore,  we  adopt  the
approach of Restatement (Second) of Torts §518, which is supported
by the case law in Maine and elsewhere:

Except for animal trespass, one who possesses or harbors a domestic
animal  that  he  does  not  know  or  have  reason  to  know  to  be  abnormally
dangerous, is subject to liability for harm done if, but only if,

(a) he intentionally causes the animal to do the harm, or
(b) he is negligent in failing to prevent the harm.

We,  as  does  the  Restatement,  leave  the  highway  traveler  who  is
injured by colliding with a stray domestic animal solely to his remedy
in  negligence.  The  degree  of  care  required  of  the  animal  owner  is  of
course  commensurate  with  the  propensities  of  the  particular
domestic  animal  and  with  the  location,  including  proximity  to  high-
speed  highways,  of  the  place  where  the  animal  is  kept  by  its  owner.
Whether  the  owners  of  large  domestic  pets  should  be  required  to
bear  more  stringent  responsibilities  for  those  animals  than  are
imposed by common law is a question the public policy makers of the
other branches of state government may well wish to address.

Judgment  vacated.  Remanded  with  directions  to  enter  judgment

for defendant.

CLARK v. BRINGS
169 N.W.2d 407 (Minn. 1969)

        , J.

While  working  as  a  babysitter  for  respondents’  three  young
children,  appellant  was  without  warning  attacked  and  bitten  by  their
pet Siamese cat. She brought this action to recover for the extensive
injuries which allegedly resulted, and she appeals . . . after the court
below  directed  a  verdict
respondents.  These  alternative
contentions are argued: (1) That the common-law cause of action for
injuries by animals should be changed, or the statute covering injuries
by  dogs  judicially  extended,  to  hold  owners  of  cats  strictly  liable  for
the acts of their pets; [or] (2) that the evidence in this case should be
held sufﬁcient to prove a cause of action under the common law as it
now  stands,  that  is,  to  show  that  respondents’  cat  was  dangerous
and that they were aware of the fact.

Principles
Matters are different when risks
are non-reciprocal even if
injurers exercise due care. Some
risks are reasonable because
they are to the long-run
advantage of those imperiled by
them, but they are not mutually
beneﬁcial in the sense that
reciprocal risks are. For
example, given the importance
of driving to our daily lives, each
of us may beneﬁt from the
transport of large quantities of
gasoline over the roads, even
though this method of
transporting gasoline creates
risks of massive explosion, and

Most  of  the  problems  in
this appeal fall within the ambit
of  the  common-law’s  system
of  distributing  the  costs  of
misbehavior  by  animals.  The
relevant cause of action in tort,
sometimes  called  “the  scienter
action,”  which  is  not  .  .  .  based
on  negligence,  divides  animals
held  as  property
two
into
classes:
Domesticated
animals, or those mansuetæ or
domitæ  naturæ,  and  wild
beasts,  or  those  feræ  naturæ.
In  the  case  of  injury  by  one  of
the  ﬁrst  class,  the  plaintiff
must  prove  that  the  particular
animal  was  abnormal  and
dangerous,  and  that  its  owner
or harborer let it run unfettered
or
though

actually

he

even though most of us never
expect to make use of the legal
right to transport vast quantities
of gasoline in this manner. It
follows that the prospective
victims of non-reciprocal risk
impositions are not fully
compensated for bearing these
risks by the right to impose
equal risks in turn. The
imposition of non-reciprocal
risks is not part of a normal life,
and the value of the right to
impose such risks does not
offset the disvalue of having to
bear exposure to them.
Subjecting non-reciprocal risks
to strict liability offsets this
unfairness. By ensuring that
those injured by non-reciprocal
risk impositions are — so far as
possible — fully compensated
for their injuries, strict liability
affects a more robust mutuality
of beneﬁt.

This

judicial  distinction
between  classes  of  animals
was clearly announced, at least
by dicta, as early as 1730. The
scienter  action  as  it  has  come
down  to  us  is  not  without  its
modern  critics,  who  would
apply
the  simpler  rules  of
liability  for  negligence  to  some
or all of the situations it covers,
but  the  ancient  doctrine  has
long  been  given  continuous
approval  and  application
in
Minnesota.

Appellant  ﬁrst  contends
that this distinction is based on
comparative  economic  utility,  the  owners  of  “useful”  animals  being
somewhat protected as an encouragement to maintaining them and
the  owners  of  “useless”  animals  receiving  no  protection  whatever.

Although the cat may once have served rural society as a “mouser,” it
is argued, in modern cities it is merely a dispensable pet, the owner of
which  ought  to  be  held,  as  would  the  owner  of  a  tiger,  liable  for  any
damage it causes.

So far as this argument may be based on the relative productivity
of  animals,  it  is  not  well  founded.  It  is  true  that  the  economic
contribution  made  by  certain  animals  has  been  considered  by  the
courts in the difﬁcult cases of animals whose tameness has seemed
in doubt. Thus, holding bees to be domesticated, the court in Earl v.
Van Alstine, 8 Barb. (N.Y.) 630, 636, said that “the law looks with more
favor upon the keeping of animals that are useful to man, than such
as  are  purely  noxious  and  useless.”  It  is  also  true  that  many  of  the
animals  which  have  been  held  to  be  of  a  harmless  nature,  such  as
milk  cows  are  obviously  more  economically  productive  and,  in  that
narrow sense, more useful to society than are cats.

The example of the horse, however, belies the suggestion that this
is  the  primary  ground  on  which  the  common  law  distinguishes.  The
position  of  the  horse  has  changed  with  the  times,  however,  as
perhaps  has  that  of  the  cat;  yet  the  law  has  continued  to  apply  the
same rules to these animals when in service only for amusement and
exercise.

So  far  as  appellant’s  argument  may  proceed  on  any  broader
theory  of  utility,  we  ﬁnd  no  basis  for  distinguishing  between  species
of  animals.  The  courts  have  indeed  held  animals  feræ  naturæ  to
include  such  worthless  predators  as  coyotes,  and  wolves,  but  they
have  made  the  same  ﬁnding  as  to  chimpanzees,  elephants,  and,
proverbially,  tigers.  All  of  these  are  animals  of  undoubted  value  to
society  in  science,  education,  and  entertainment,  on  the  keepers  of
which  the  law  must  have  some  reason  other  than  uselessness  for
imposing a special burden of care.

A  close  examination  of  the  authorities  shows  that  the  law’s
division  of  animals  into  those  domesticated  and  those  dangerous  is

based  rather  on  “[e]xperience  as  interpreted  by  the  English  law.”
Holmes, The Common Law, p. 157. Horses, cows, and other animals
have been regarded by the courts as domitæ naturæ because “years
ago,  and  continuously  to  the  present  time,  the  progeny  of  these
classes has been found by experience to be harmless, and so the law
assumes  the  result  of  this  experience  to  be  correct  without  further
proof.” Filburn v. People’s Palace and Aquarium Co. L.R. 25 Q.B. 258,
260.

“[I]t appears,” moreover, “that as soon as an animal is placed in the
harmless class by judicial decision, judicial notice will be taken of the
fact in any future case.” Williams, Liability for Animals, p. 295. In the
few apposite cases, the courts have without exception explicitly held
or  implicitly  regarded  the  cat  as  a  domesticated  animal,  one  “that  is
dealt with by mankind on the footing that a person may safely keep
it.” Clinton v. J. Lyons & Co. [1912] 3 K.B. 198, 207. As was stated by
Chief  Justice  Rugg  in  Goodwin  v.  E.B.  Nelson  Grocery  Co.  132  N.E.
51, 53 (Mass.): “The domestic cat is by nature ordinarily harmless and
docile.”

William  Blake’s  famous  poem,  “The  Tiger”  begins  with  the
following memorable lines:

Tiger, Tiger, burning bright
In the forest of the night,
What immortal hand or eye
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?

We should be most reluctant, therefore, to be the ﬁrst to observe
judicially in this little house pet, the cat, the “fearful symmetry” which
the  poet,  William  Blake,  saw  in  the  tiger.  If  the  law  has  erred  in
interpreting  mankind’s  experience  with  cats,  or  if  this  animal’s  value
to  society  strikes  an  inadequate  balance  against  whatever  damage

and injury it might cause, then it is for the legislature, which can best
assess  the  total  dimension  of  the  problem,  to  change  the  common
law by statute.

This  change,  appellant  asserts  alternatively,  has  in  fact  been
accomplished  by  the  legislature.  She  argues  that  Minn.  St.  347.22,
which  makes  the  owner  of  a  dog  liable  for  the  bites  which  it  might
without  provocation  inflict  on  those  rightfully  coming  near  it,  by
necessary implication includes cats — that is, if the owner of one pet
is  thus  to  be  held  liable,  then  the  same  statutory  policy  should  be
applied to the owner of another.

Minn. St. 347.22 (L. 1951, c. 315, §1) was the ﬁrst statute on this

subject and provides:

If  a  dog,  without  provocation,  attacks  or  injures  any  person  who  is  peaceably
conducting himself in any place where he may lawfully be in any urban area, the
owner of the dog is liable in damages to the person so attacked or injured to the
full  amount  of  the  injury  sustained.  The  term  “owner”  includes  any  person
harboring  or  keeping  a  dog.  The  term  “dog”  includes  both  male  and  female  of
the canine species.

Before 1951, a person bitten by a dog in Minnesota could recover only
through the scienter action.

Whatever the theory on which this statute was enacted, its close
wording  would  seem  to  preclude  any  extension  of
its  severe
provisions  to  the  owners  of  other  animals,  even  those  others  of  the
“leisured classes” of pets. This court has not so extended this statute
in other cases, for since its enactment we have continued to apply the
common law in cases involving all other beasts.

If  the  Minnesota  Legislature  had  in  1951  intended  to  revise  the
common  law  as  to  cats  in  the  same  manner  as  it  abolished  it  as  to
dogs,  there  would  have  been  no  difﬁculty  in  doing  so  expressly,  and
there  would  be  no  apparent  barrier  to  amending  the  statute  now.
Absent  legislative  action,  we  decline  to  hold  that  Minn.  St.  347.22
applies to the owners of cats.

We must consider, then, whether appellant made out a jury issue
as  to  her  scienter  action.  To  prove  that  respondents’  cat  had
committed  prior  acts  of  viciousness,  known  to  them,  appellant’s
evidence  was  threefold:  First,  the  cat  had  once  before  bitten  a
babysitter;  second,  the  cat  had  scratched  several  members  of  the
household; and third, the cat was usually conﬁned to the basement.

The  biting  incident,  although  not  without  signiﬁcance,  is  less
signiﬁcant  than  appellant  would  acknowledge.  The  babysitter  who
had been bitten testiﬁed that the incident occurred when she and the
children  were  playing  with  the  cat  by  pulling  a  spool  across  the
basement floor on a string. The cat became excited from chasing it,
she  related,  and  inflicted  a  “superﬁcial”  bite  on  her  ankle.  The
respondents, moreover, were not informed of this “attack” incident.

It is true that a pet’s owner need not “have notice that the animal
has frequently ‘broken through the tameness of his nature’ into acts
of aggression,” and that the notice is sufﬁcient should the animal just
once “throw off the habits of domesticity and tameness, and put on a
savage  nature.”  Kittredge  v.  Elliott,  16  N.H.  77,  81.  “It  is  not  true,  as
has  often  been  stated,  that  ‘the  law  allows  a  dog  his  ﬁrst  bite,’  for  if
the owner has good reason to apprehend, from his knowledge of the
nature  and  propensity  of  the  animal,  that  he  has  become  evilly
inclined, the duty of care and restraint attaches.” Cuney v. Campbell,
78  N.W.  878,  879  (Minn.).  Here,  however,  the  testimony  shows  that
the  cat  was  provoked  and  excited  by  play  when  it  inflicted  the  ﬁrst
injury, and the authorities universally hold that “[s]uch an attack is no
evidence of viciousness in the animal and is insufﬁcient to render the
owner liable.” Erickson v. Bronson, 83 N.W. 988 (Minn). At best, to say
that  this  bite  “was  vicious  is  merely  conjecture,”  and  the  testimony
thus cannot withstand a motion for a directed verdict.

that

The  evidence

the  cat  had  several

times  scratched
respondents themselves, their children, and their other babysitters is
scarcely  more  signiﬁcant.  The  cat  usually  scratched  them  on  their
hands, it appears, when they were picking it up or playfully handling it.

We  would  agree  that  it  is  the  mere  dangerousness  of  an  animal’s
character, and not any intentional malevolence, which must be proved
to render its owner liable — that the “propensity is vicious if it tends to
harm, whether manifested in play or in anger, or in some outbreak of
untrained  nature  which,  from  want  of  better  understanding,  must
remain unclassiﬁed.” Hill v. Moseley, 17 S.E.2d 676, 678. But many of
these incidents of scratching would seem necessarily to be excused
as provoked, under the rule discussed supra; in any event, injuries of
so slight a nature as those shown, unaccompanied by any indications
of  a  propensity  of  the  cat  to  cause  greater  harm,  are  inadequate  to
prove  that  it  was  dangerous  and  ought  to  have  been  caged  or
destroyed.

in

their  basement

Appellant  relies  upon  evidence  that  respondents  kept  their  cat
conﬁned
to  establish  knowledge  and
acknowledgment by respondents that their cat was dangerous. There
is  indeed  authority  to  the  effect  that  such  restraint  of  a  pet  may  be
proof  that  the  animal  was,  as  its  owner  knew,  vicious.  The  sort  of
conﬁnement shown in the case at bar, however, could hardly support
an  inference  that  respondents  knew  of  any  danger  from  their  cat.  It
was  kept  in  the  basement,  they  testiﬁed,  simply  to  prevent  its
scratching  their  living  room  furniture,  not  to  protect  against  attack
upon people. Respondents’ three children, the youngest only about 3
years old, shared with the cat a furnished basement recreation room,
where many of their toys were kept and where they often played. The
precautions  taken  to  keep  the  cat  downstairs  were  minimal,
consisting largely of a catch on the basement door, and the restraint
was not continuously effective. The trial court, in our opinion, rightly
considered the whole of this evidence far too tenuous for submission
to the jury.

Afﬁrmed.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Wild  vs.  Domestic  Animals.   What  is  the  justiﬁcation  for
imposing liability on owners and possessors of wild animals without
a  showing  of  fault?  Consider  the  phrase  “abnormal  danger”  as  used
by the court in Byram.  How  does  this  justiﬁcation  compare  with  the
principle  supporting  strict  liability  for  ultrahazardous  activities?  How
would  the  Restatement  (Second)’s  factors  for  imposing  liability  for
ultrahazardous  activities  apply  to  the  activity  of  keeping  a  tiger  in
one’s backyard?

2.  Different  Pathways  to  Imposing  Strict  Liability.   Byram  does  a
good  job  discussing  the  three  ways  in  which  animal  owners  can  be
subject  to  strict  liability  for  harm  caused  by  their  animals:  (a)
characterization  of  their  animal  as  wild;  (b)  the  scienter  action,  in
which  a  particular  domesticated  animal  has  previously  displayed  to
its  owner  aberrational  character  traits  of  a  propensity  for  violence;
and  (c)  the  animal  causing  harm  while  on  the  victim’s  property
without  consent.  Clark  also  demonstrates  that  a  legislature  may
modify  the  common  law  by  enacting  statutes  that  impose  strict
liability  under  certain  circumstances
inflicted  by
domesticated  animals,  such  as  the  Minnesota  law  creating  strict
liability for dog owners. In Clark, the plaintiff’s various arguments for
imposing  strict  liability  essentially  raised  three  questions  for  the
court:  (a)  Are  cats  tantamount  to  tigers?  (b)  Are  cats  tantamount  to
dogs? and (c) Had the defendant’s cat acted like a tiger in the past?
Notice that the ﬁrst two questions concern the cat species generally
while the last question, relevant to the scienter action, only concerns
the  defendant’s  pet.  Why  did  the  court  answer  each  question  in  the
negative?

for  harms

3. Negligence vs. Scienter Action.  In Clark, the court describes the
scienter  action  as  imposing  strict  liability  once  it  is  shown  that  the
defendant had actual or constructive knowledge from speciﬁc acts of
its  domesticated  animal  of  dangerous  propensities  abnormal  to  its
species.  Focusing  on  the  actual  or  constructive  knowledge  of  the
defendant  to  impose  liability  appears  to  come  close  to  describing  a

fault-based  negligence  cause  of  action.  But  notice  that  in  a  scienter
action, once this level of awareness by the owner of a domesticated
animal is demonstrated, the owner becomes absolutely liable for the
harm  inflicted  by  its  pet  regardless  of  what  measures  the  owner
undertook to prevent such harm. In this way, the scienter action still
imposes strict liability rather than requiring negligence as a basis for
liability. Once Fluffy has been shown to be a very bad kitty, no amount
of  care  by  its  owner  will  preclude  liability  for  the  harm  Fluffy  inflicts
on  others.  Of  course,  if  a  pet’s  owner  makes  no  efforts  to  protect
others from its animal despite foreseeable knowledge of the animal’s
propensity to inflict injuries, a victim can always assert a negligence
action  as  well.  And  when  the  pet  owner’s  acts  or  omissions  display
gross negligence, an action for punitive damages might be warranted.
The point is that the availability of a strict liability cause of action for
wild animals does not displace other fault-based claims that might be
available based on the circumstances.

A. Defendant lives in a semi-rural area and keeps exotic animals on
his property, which a large fence surrounds. Vandals cut a hole
in  his  fence  one  evening  and  a  zebra  escapes.  The  zebra  runs
through  an  intersection  in  a  nearby  town,  causing  two  cars  to
collide.

B. A local college keeps a bear in a caged enclosure on campus as
its mascot. The bear escapes the enclosure and urinates on the
plaintiff’s new car parked on a public street, ruining its paint job.
C.  A  city  ordinance  requires  dog  owners  to  keep  their  pets  on  a
leash  when  walking  on  public  property.  The  defendant’s
unleashed dog is chasing Frisbees in a public park when it spots
the plaintiff’s dog (on a leash) and attacks it.

D. Defendant has a pit bull, which has never displayed a propensity
for viciousness. However, it is provoked one day while sitting in
the  defendant’s  driveway  by  youths  on  their  bikes  throwing

rocks  toward  the  dog.  The  pit  bull  attacks  one  of  the  teens  on
his bike and inflicts signiﬁcant wounds to the teen’s leg.

E.  Defendant  owns  a  ranch  and  has  horses.  One  of  the  horses,
Ginger,  has  a  bit  of  a  short  fuse  and  becomes  annoyed  when
ridden  for  long  periods  of  time.  She  has  a  tendency  in  such
instances  to  refuse  to  be  ridden  any  further,  as  she  stubbornly
will simply stop moving. She has also tried on a few occasions
to  turn  her  head  back  toward  a  rider’s  leg  and  bump  the  leg  to
indicate her annoyance. Becoming tired while being ridden by a
guest of the ranch, Ginger turned her head and tried to bump the
rider’s leg. When the rider responded by kicking the horse in her
ribs, Ginger got angry and bit the rider’s foot.

Upon Further Review

For  most  of  our  usual  activities,  such  as  mowing  the  lawn,
driving  to  work,  shopping  in  the  local  market,  building  a  tree-
house,  keeping  a  family  pet,  or  playing  tennis,  the  law  does  not
make one liable unless found to be at fault in causing another’s
injuries — either  through  an
intentional  tort  or  an  act  of
carelessness.  But  when  conduct  creates  non-reciprocal  risks
because  it  is  so  unusual,  and  when  those  risks  are  considered
signiﬁcant, the law has for a long time dispensed with a showing
of  fault  as  a  condition  of  imposing  liability.  So,  for  example,
actors who use explosives in their business or keep a pet cobra
can  be  held  strictly  liable  when  their  conduct  causes  harm  to
another.  Such  liability  can  attach  regardless  of  how  much  care
was  employed  by  the  actor — they  become  insurers  of  others
hurt  by  their  conduct.  While  this  body  of  law  is  important  in  its
own  right,  it  was  considered  a  fairly  niche  area  of  tort  law  until
the recognition of strict products liability.

II  HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT AND ADOPTION

A. Limitations on Duty

At  one  point  in  time,  courts  uniformly  applied  a  limited  special  duty
rule in negligence cases that recognized a duty of care to a consumer
injured  by  a  product  only  if  the  seller  was  in  contractual  privity  with
the  plaintiff.  That  is,  the  consumer  could  only  assert  a  negligence
claim  against  her  immediate  seller  of  the  product.  If  the  plaintiff
bought  directly  from  the  manufacturer,  she  could  sue
if  the
manufacturer could be shown to be at fault. On the other hand, most
consumer  products  are  not  sold  directly  by  the  manufacturer  to  the
consumer  but  through  wholesalers,  distributors,  and  then  retailers.
Under  this  scenario,  the  only  entity  owing  the  consumer  a  duty  of
care  would  be  the  retailer  from  whom  the  plaintiff  purchased  the
item.  Unfortunately,  retailers  are  less  likely  to  have  acted  negligently
than  manufacturers — after  all,  retailers  rarely  exercise  any  control
over  the  design  or  building  of  such  goods.  The  retailer  might  also
have no indication, until the plaintiff’s injury and suit, of the existence
of any problem. Thus, the only one in the stream of commerce owing
a duty of care toward the plaintiff would be the one least likely to be
culpable  of  any  wrongdoing.  Courts  increasingly  desired  to  make  it
easier for consumers damaged by defective products to ﬁnd recourse
against  sellers  of  such  goods.  This  limited  duty  rule  was  a  major
obstacle in the path of easing restrictions on suits brought by injured
consumers. A case with enormous influence in torts was decided in
1916  in  an  opinion  written  by  Judge  Cardozo.  In  the  MacPherson
case  below,  note  how  Judge  Cardozo  masterfully  and  dramatically
changes the law while making it look like less than a wholesale shift
in the law of torts.

MACPHERSON v. BUICK MOTOR COMPANY
111 N.E. 1050 (N.Y. 1916)

       , J.

The  defendant  is  a  manufacturer  of  automobiles.  It  sold  an
automobile  to  a  retail  dealer.  The  retail  dealer  resold  to  the  plaintiff.
While  the  plaintiff  was  in  the  car,  it  suddenly  collapsed.  He  was
thrown  out  and  injured.  One  of  the  wheels  was  made  of  defective
wood,  and  its  spokes  crumbled  into  fragments.  The  wheel  was  not
made  by  the  defendant;  it  was  bought  from  another  manufacturer.

willfully  concealed  it.  The  charge  is  one,  not  of  fraud,  but  of
negligence. The question to be determined is whether the defendant

purchaser.

is  evidence,  however,  that

inspection,  and  that

The  foundations  of  this  branch  of  the  law,  at  least  in  this  state,
were laid in Thomas v. Winchester (6 N.Y. 397). A poison was falsely
labeled.  The  sale  was  made  to  a  druggist,  who  in  turn  sold  to  a
customer.  The  customer  recovered  damages  from  the  seller  who
afﬁxed the label. “The defendant’s negligence,” it was said, “put human
life  in  imminent  danger.”  A  poison  falsely  labeled  is  likely  to  injure
anyone who gets it. Because the danger is to be foreseen, there is a
duty  to  avoid  the  injury.  Cases  were  cited  by  way  of  illustration  in
which  manufacturers  were  not  subject  to  any  duty  irrespective  of
contract.  The  distinction  was  said  to  be  that  their  conduct,  though
negligent,  was  not  likely  to  result  in  injury  to  anyone  except  the
purchaser.  We  are  not  required  to  say  whether  the  chance  of  injury
was  always  as  remote  as  the  distinction  assumes.  Some  of  the
illustrations might be rejected today. The principle of the distinction is
for present purposes the important thing.

Thomas  v. Winchester  became  quickly  a  landmark  of  the  law.  In
the  application  of  its  principle  there  may  at  times  have  been
uncertainty or even error. There has never in this state been doubt or
disavowal of the principle itself. The chief cases are well known, yet to
recall some of them will be helpful. Loop v. Litchfield (42 N.Y. 351) is
the earliest. It was the case of a defect in a small balance wheel used
on  a  circular  saw.  The  manufacturer  pointed  out  the  defect  to  the
buyer, who wished a cheap article and was ready to assume the risk.
The risk can hardly have been an imminent one, for the wheel lasted
ﬁve  years  before  it  broke.  In  the  meanwhile  the  buyer  had  made  a
lease  of  the  machinery.  It  was  held  that  the  manufacturer  was  not
answerable to the lessee. Loop v. Litchfield was followed in Losee v.
Clute (51 N.Y. 494), the case of the explosion of a steam boiler. That
decision  has  been  criticised  (Thompson  on  Negligence,  233;
Shearman  &  Redﬁeld  on  Negligence  [6th  ed.],  §117);  but  it  must  be
conﬁned to its special facts. It was put upon the ground that the risk
of  injury  was  too  remote.  The  buyer  in  that  case  had  not  only
accepted the boiler, but had tested it. The manufacturer knew that his
own test was not the ﬁnal one. The ﬁnality of the test has a  bearing
on  the  measure  of  diligence  owing  to  persons  other  than  the
purchaser  (Beven,  Negligence  [3d  ed.],  pp.  50,  51,  54;  Wharton,
Negligence [2d ed.], §134).

These early cases suggest a narrow construction of the rule. Later
cases,  however,  evince  a  more  liberal  spirit.  First  in  importance  is
Devlin  v.  Smith  (89  N.Y.  470).  The  defendant,  a  contractor,  built  a
scaffold  for  a  painter.  The  painter’s  servants  were  injured.  The
contractor  was  held  liable.  He  knew  that  the  scaffold,  if  improperly
constructed,  was  a  most  dangerous  trap.  He  knew  that  it  was  to  be
used  by  the  workmen.  He  was  building  it  for  that  very  purpose.
Building  it  for  their  use,  he  owed  them  a  duty,  irrespective  of  his
contract with their master, to build it with care.

From Devlin v. Smith we pass over intermediate cases and turn to
the  latest  case  in  this  court  in  which  Thomas  v.  Winchester  was

followed. That case is Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co. (195 N.Y. 478, 480). The
defendant  manufactured  a  large  coffee  urn.  It  was  installed  in  a
restaurant.  When  heated,  the  urn  exploded  and  injured  the  plaintiff.
We held that the manufacturer was liable. We said that the urn “was
of such a character inherently that, when applied to the purposes for
which  it  was  designed,  it  was  liable  to  become  a  source  of  great
danger to many people if not carefully and properly constructed.”

It  may  be  that  Devlin  v.  Smith  and  Statler  v.  Ray  Mfg.  Co.  have
extended  the  rule  of  Thomas  v.  Winchester.  If  so,  this  court  is
committed  to  the  extension.  The  defendant  argues  that  things
life  are  poisons,  explosives,  deadly
imminently  dangerous  to
weapons — things whose normal function it is to injure or destroy. But
whatever  the  rule  in  Thomas  v.  Winchester  may  once  have  been,  it
has  no  longer  that  restricted  meaning.  A  scaffold  is  not  inherently  a
destructive  instrument.  It  becomes  destructive  only  if  imperfectly
constructed.  A  large  coffee  urn  may  have  within  itself,  if  negligently
made, the potency of danger, yet no one thinks of it as an implement
whose  normal  function  is  destruction.  We  are  not  required  at  this
time either to approve or to disapprove the application of the rule that
was made in these cases. It is enough that they help to characterize
the trend of judicial thought.

We  hold,  then,  that  the  principle  of  Thomas  v.  Winchester  is  not
limited  to  poisons,  explosives,  and  things  of  like  nature,  to  things
which in their normal operation are implements of destruction. If the
nature of a thing is such that it is reasonably certain to place life and
limb  in  peril  when  negligently  made,  it  is  then  a  thing  of  danger.  Its
nature  gives  warning  of  the  consequences  to  be  expected.  If  to  the
element  of  danger  there  is  added  knowledge  that  the  thing  will  be
used  by  persons  other  than  the  purchaser,  and  used  without  new
tests, then, irrespective of contract, the manufacturer of this thing of
danger  is  under  a  duty  to  make  it  carefully.  That  is  as  far  as  we  are
required to go for the decision of this case. There must be knowledge
of  a  danger,  not  merely  possible,  but  probable.  It  is  possible  to  use

almost anything in a way that will make it dangerous if defective. That
is not enough to charge the manufacturer with a duty independent of
his contract. Whether a given thing is dangerous may be sometimes
a question for the court and sometimes a question for the jury. There
must also be knowledge that in the usual course of events the danger
will be shared by others than the buyer. Such knowledge may often be
inferred from the nature of the transaction. But it is possible that even
knowledge  of  the  danger  and  of  the  use  will  not  always  be  enough.
The  proximity  or  remoteness  of  the  relation  is  a  factor  to  be
considered. We are dealing now with the liability of the manufacturer
of the ﬁnished product, who puts it on the market to be used without
inspection by his customers. If he is negligent, where danger is to be
foreseen, a liability will follow.

imminent  danger,  an

We  are  not  required  at  this  time  to  say  that  it  is  legitimate  to  go
back  of  the  manufacturer  of  the  ﬁnished  product  and  hold  the
manufacturers  of  the  component  parts.  To  make  their  negligence  a
cause  of
independent  cause  must  often
intervene;  the  manufacturer  of  the  ﬁnished  product  must  also  fail  in
his  duty  of  inspection.  It  may  be  that  in  those  circumstances  the
negligence  of  the  earlier  members  of  the  series  is  too  remote  to
constitute, as to the ultimate user, an actionable wrong. We leave that
question  open.  We  shall  have  to  deal  with  it  when  it  arises.  The
difﬁculty  which  it  suggests  is  not  present  in  this  case.  There  is  here
no break in the chain of cause and effect. In such circumstances, the
presence  of  a  known  danger,  attendant  upon  a  known  use,  makes
vigilance  a  duty.  We  have  put  aside  the  notion  that  the  duty  to
safeguard  life  and  limb,  when  the  consequences  of  negligence  may
be foreseen, grows out of contract and nothing else. We have put the
source of the obligation where it ought to be. We have put its source
in the law.

From this survey of the decisions, there thus emerges a deﬁnition
of  the  duty  of  a  manufacturer,  which  enables  us  to  measure  this
defendant’s liability. Beyond all question, the nature of an automobile

gives warning of probable danger if its construction is defective. This
automobile was designed to go ﬁfty miles an hour. Unless its wheels
were sound and strong, injury was almost certain. It was as much a
thing  of  danger  as  a  defective  engine  for  a  railroad.  The  defendant
knew the danger. It knew also that the car would be used by persons
other  than  the  buyer.  This  was  apparent  from  its  size;  there  were
seats  for  three  persons.  It  was  apparent  also  from  the  fact  that  the
buyer was a dealer in cars, who bought to resell. The maker of this car
supplied it for the use of purchasers from the dealer just as plainly as
the contractor in Devlin v. Smith supplied the scaffold for use by the
servants  of  the  owner.  The  dealer  was  indeed  the  one  person  of
whom it might be said with some approach to certainty that by him
the car would not be used. Yet the defendant would have us say that
he was the one person whom it was under a legal duty to protect. The
law  does  not  lead  us  to  so  inconsequent  a  conclusion.  Precedents
drawn from the days of travel by stage coach do not ﬁt the conditions
of travel to-day. The principle that the danger must be imminent does
not  change,  but  the  things  subject  to  the  principle  do  change.  They
are whatever the needs of life in a developing civilization require them
to be.

In this view of the defendant’s liability there is nothing inconsistent
with the theory of liability on which the case was tried. It is true that
the  court  told  the  jury  that  “an  automobile  is  not  an  inherently
dangerous  vehicle.”  The  meaning,  however,  is  made  plain  by  the
context. The meaning is that danger is not to be expected when the
vehicle is well constructed. The court left it to the jury to say whether
the  defendant  ought  to  have  foreseen  that  the  car,  if  negligently
constructed,  would  become
“imminently  dangerous.”  Subtle
distinctions  are  drawn  by  the  defendant  between  things  inherently
dangerous  and  things  imminently  dangerous,  but  the  case  does  not
turn  upon  these  verbal  niceties.  If  danger  was  to  be  expected  as
reasonably  certain,  there  was  a  duty  of  vigilance,  and  this  whether
you  call  the  danger  inherent  or  imminent.  In  varying  forms  that

thought was put before the jury. We do not say that the court would
not have been justiﬁed in ruling as a matter of law that the car was a
dangerous  thing.  If  there  was  any  error,  it  was  none  of  which  the
defendant can complain.

manufacturer.  It  was  not  merely  a  dealer  in  automobiles.  It  was  a
manufacturer  of  automobiles.  It  was  responsible  for  the  ﬁnished
product. It was not at liberty to put the ﬁnished product on the market
without subjecting the component parts to ordinary and simple tests
(Richmond & Danville R.R. Co. v. Elliott, 149 U.S. 266, 272). Under the
charge  of  the  trial  judge  nothing  more  was  required  of  it.  The
obligation  to  inspect  must  vary  with  the  nature  of  the  thing  to  be
inspected.  The  more  probable  the  danger,  the  greater  the  need  of
caution.  Both  by  its  relation  to  the  work  and  by  the  nature  of  its
business, it is charged with a stricter duty.

The judgment should be afﬁrmed with costs.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Eradication  of  Special  Duty  Limit.   The  plaintiff  in  MacPherson
encountered a duty problem with respect to its attempted negligence
claim against Buick. As an example of a special duty rule (similar to
those  we  encountered  in  Chapter  6,  Special  Duty  Rules)  sellers  of
goods  who  were  not  in  direct  privity  of  contract  with  the  plaintiff
generally  had  no  duty  of  care  toward  the  plaintiff.  Can  you  imagine
why  the  law  had  come  up  with  this  limitation  to  protect  remote
sellers? This special duty rule was ﬁrst announced in Winterbottom v.
Wright, 152 Eng. Rep. 402 (1842) where the court stated that a coach
driver hurt by a defect in the stagecoach he was hired to drive could
not sue for negligence because he lacked privity of contract. You will
recall  encountering  Judge  Cardozo  in  the  Palsgraf  case,  where  he

declared  that  the  concept  of  a  duty  of  care  was  premised  upon  a
foreseeable risk of harm to the plaintiff from the defendant’s conduct.
In  MacPherson,  Cardozo  determined  to  run  the  historic  no-duty  rule
for  sellers  of  goods  lacking  privity  of  contract  with  victims  through
this  crucible  of  foreseeability.  Judge  Cardozo  ﬁrst  noted  that  an
exception  to  the  general  no-duty  rule  had  become  the  trend  based
upon  the  foreseeability  of  signiﬁcant  harm  to  remote  users  of
negligently  designed  and  manufactured  goods.  How  does  Cardozo
use this exception to establish a new rule? What are the two aspects
of  foreseeability  that  Cardozo  declares  are  necessary  to  remove  the
privity barrier in a particular case?

2. Liability of Retailer.  Near the end of his opinion in MacPherson,
Judge  Cardozo  turns  his  attention  to  the  second  issue  of  whether
there  was  evidence  of  any  fault  against  Buick.  He  contrasts  the
potential requirement for an inspection of the ﬁnished goods against
a manufacturer such as Buick with the subsequent retailer of the car.
He  observes  that  Buick  was  “not  merely  a  dealer  in  automobiles.  It
was  a  manufacturer  of  automobiles.  It  was  not  at  liberty  to  put  the
ﬁnished  product  on  the  market  without  subjecting  the  component
parts  to  ordinary  and  simple  tests.”  The  negative  implication  of  this
observation is that an ordinary retailer, having no part in the design or
manufacture  of  a  ﬁnished  good,  might  not  have  any  obligation — as
part  of  its  duty  of  reasonable  care — to  inspect  or  test  a  car  before
selling  it.  This  observation  highlights  a  signiﬁcant  importance  of  the
decision in MacPherson because, prior to this case, the only seller in
the  stream  of  commerce  owing  the  plaintiff  a  duty  of  care  was  the
one
likely  to  be  found  to  have  breached  such  a  duty.
MacPherson  ﬁxes  this  anomaly  and  opens  the  door  to  suits  by
victims  against  those  likely  to  have  deeper  pockets  than  the  retailer
with whom the plaintiff dealt.

least

3. Liability of Remote Component Manufacturer.  On the other end
of  the  stream  of  commerce  from  the  retailer,  Cardozo  briefly
speculates about the potential liability of the remote manufacturer of

the  defective  wheel  used  on  the  Buick.  While  not  absolving  that
remote seller of a duty of care, Cardozo wonders whether proximate
cause  will  be  a  stumbling  block  for  an  injured  consumer  under  his
direct  cause  view  of  proximate  cause:  “It  may  be  that  in  those
circumstances the negligence of the earlier members of the series is
too remote to constitute, as to the ultimate user, an actionable wrong.
We leave that question open.” Do you understand why under a direct
cause  test  for  proximate  cause  the  subsequent  negligence  of  Buick
might be considered an independent intervening cause?

4.  Paving  the  Way  for  Strict  Liability  Against  Sellers.   Though
Cardozo conditioned a ﬁnding of duty on Buick being able to foresee
the  special  dangers  of  a  negligently  constructed  car  to  users  other
than  immediate  purchasers,  courts  eventually  quit  asking  these
questions  and  began  to  routinely  assume  a  duty  on  all  product
manufacturers owed toward any user or victim of a negligently built
product. Thus, MacPherson paved the way toward easing one of the
two major impediments toward recovery by victims of products. The
Escola  case  below  suggested  a  pathway  around  the  other  hurdle —
establishing fault, or negligence, against a product seller.

B. Rejection of Fault or Contract Breach as

Prerequisites to Recovery

The MacPherson case was enormously important in terms of making
manufacturers who were careless about designing or building goods
accountable  to  remote  injured  consumers.  But  it  still  left  intact
certain other hurdles to recovery, either on a tort theory or a breach of
warranty theory. In the following case of Escola v. Coca Cola, Justice
Traynor in his famous concurring opinion proposed that courts ﬁnd a
new, simpler pathway toward an injured consumer’s recovery that is
neither  shackled  with  the  burden  of  proving  fault  nor  subject  to  the
intricacies  of  the  law  of  sales  (for  a  warranty  recovery).  Although  it

was  “just”  a  concurring  opinion,  the  strength  of  his  arguments
resonated and ultimately became the basis nearly two decades later
for the adoption of strict products liability. Consider the multifaceted
arguments  Justice  Traynor  gives  for  this  proposed  fundamental
change in the law.

ESCOLA v. COCA COLA BOTTLING CO. OF FRESNO
150 P.2d 436 (Cal. 1944)

      , J.

Plaintiff,  a  waitress  in  a  restaurant,  was  injured  when  a  bottle  of
Coca  Cola  broke  in  her  hand.  She  alleged  that  defendant  company,
which  had  bottled  and  delivered  the  alleged  defective  bottle  to  her
employer,  was  negligent  in  selling  “bottles  containing  said  beverage
which on account of excessive pressure of gas or by reason of some
defect in the bottle was dangerous and likely to explode.” This appeal
is from a judgment upon a jury verdict in favor of plaintiff.

Defendant’s  driver  delivered  several  cases  of  Coca  Cola  to  the
restaurant,  placing  them  on  the  floor,  one  on  top  of  the  other,  under
and behind the counter, where they remained at least thirty-six hours.
Immediately before the accident, plaintiff picked up the top case and
set it upon a nearby ice cream cabinet in front of and about three feet
from the refrigerator. She then proceeded to take the bottles from the
case  with  her  right  hand,  one  at  a  time,  and  put  them  into  the
refrigerator. Plaintiff testiﬁed that after she had placed three bottles in
the  refrigerator  and  had  moved  the  fourth  bottle  about  eighteen
inches  from  the  case  “it  exploded  in  my  hand.”  The  bottle  broke  into
two  jagged  pieces  and  inflicted  a  deep  ﬁve-inch  cut,  severing  blood
vessels,  nerves  and  muscles  of  the  thumb  and  palm  of  the  hand.
Plaintiff  further  testiﬁed  that  when  the  bottle  exploded,  “It  made  a
sound  similar  to  an  electric  light  bulb  that  would  have  dropped.  It
made  a  loud  pop.”  Plaintiff’s  employer  testiﬁed,  “I  was  about  twenty

feet  from  where  it  actually  happened  and  I  heard  the  explosion.”  A
fellow  employee,  on  the  opposite  side  of  the  counter,  testiﬁed  that
plaintiff “had the bottle, I should judge, waist high, and I know that it
didn’t  bang  either  the  case  or  the  door  or  another  bottle  .  .  .  when  it
popped.  It  sounded  just  like  a  fruit  jar  would  blow  up.”  The  witness
further  testiﬁed  that  the  contents  of  the  bottle  “flew  all  over  herself
and myself and the walls and one thing and another.”

The  top  portion  of  the  bottle,  with  the  cap,  remained  in  plaintiff’s
hand,  and  the  lower  portion  fell  to  the  floor  but  did  not  break.  The
broken  bottle  was  not  produced  at  the  trial,  the  pieces  having  been
thrown  away  by  an  employee  of  the  restaurant  shortly  after  the
accident.  Plaintiff,  however,  described  the  broken  pieces,  and  a
diagram of the bottle was made showing the location of the “fracture
line” where the bottle broke in two.

One of defendant’s drivers, called as a witness by plaintiff, testiﬁed
that he had seen other bottles of Coca Cola in the past explode and
had  found  broken  bottles  in  the  warehouse  when  he  took  the  cases
out, but that he did not know what made them blow up.

Plaintiff then rested her case, having announced to the court that
being  unable  to  show  any  speciﬁc  acts  of  negligence,  she  relied
completely on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.

Although  it  is  not  clear  in  this  case  whether  the  explosion  was
caused  by  an  excessive  charge  or  a  defect  in  the  glass,  there  is  a
sufﬁcient  showing  that  neither  cause  would  ordinarily  have  been
present  if  due  care  had  been  used.  Further,  defendant  had  exclusive
control  over  both  the  charging  and  inspection  of  the  bottles.
Accordingly,  all  the  requirements  necessary  to  entitle  plaintiff  to  rely
on  the  doctrine  of  res  ipsa  loquitur  to  supply  an  inference  of
negligence are present.

The judgment is afﬁrmed.

       , J., concurring

I  concur  in  the  judgment,  but  I  believe  the  manufacturer’s
negligence should no longer be singled out as the basis of a plaintiff’s
right to recover in cases like the present one. In my opinion it should
now  be  recognized  that  a  manufacturer  incurs  an  absolute  liability
when an article that he has placed on the market, knowing that it is to
be used without inspection, proves to have a defect that causes injury
to  human  beings.  McPherson  v.  Buick  Motor  Co.  established  the
principle,  recognized  by  this  court,  that  irrespective  of  privity  of
contract,  the  manufacturer  is  responsible  for  an  injury  caused  by
such an article to any person who comes in lawful contact with it. In
these  cases  the  source  of  the  manufacturer’s  liability  was  his
negligence  in  the  manufacturing  process  or  in  the  inspection  of
component  parts  supplied  by  others.  Even  if  there  is  no  negligence,
however, public policy demands that responsibility be ﬁxed wherever
it will most effectively reduce the hazards to life and health inherent in
defective  products  that  reach  the  market.  It  is  evident  that  the
manufacturer  can  anticipate  some  hazards  and  guard  against  the
recurrence  of  others,  as  the  public  cannot.  Those  who  suffer  injury
from  defective  products  are  unprepared  to  meet  its  consequences.
The  cost  of  an  injury  and  the  loss  of  time  or  health  may  be  an
overwhelming  misfortune  to  the  person  injured,  and  a  needless  one,
for  the  risk  of  injury  can  be  insured  by  the  manufacturer  and
distributed among the public as a cost of doing business. It is to the
public  interest  to  discourage  the  marketing  of  products  having
defects  that  are  a  menace  to  the  public.
If  such  products
nevertheless ﬁnd their way into the market it is to the public interest
to  place  the  responsibility  for  whatever  injury  they  may  cause  upon
the manufacturer, who, even if he is not negligent in the manufacture
of  the  product,  is  responsible  for  its  reaching  the  market.  However
intermittently such injuries may occur and however haphazardly they
may  strike,  the  risk  of  their  occurrence  is  a  constant  risk  and  a
general one. Against such a risk there should be general and constant

protection  and  the  manufacturer  is  best  situated  to  afford  such
protection.

ipsa

The injury from a defective product does not become a matter of
indifference  because  the  defect  arises  from  causes  other  than  the
negligence  of  the  manufacturer,  such  as  negligence  of  a  sub-
manufacturer  of  a  component  part  whose  defects  could  not  be
revealed by inspection, or unknown causes that even by the device of
loquitur  cannot  be  classiﬁed  as  negligence  of  the
res
manufacturer.  The  inference  of  negligence  may  be  dispelled  by  an
afﬁrmative  showing  of  proper  care.  If  the  evidence  against  the  fact
inferred is “clear, positive, uncontradicted, and of such a nature that it
cannot rationally be disbelieved, the court must instruct the jury that
the nonexistence of the fact has been established as a matter of law.”
(Blank v. Coffin, 126 P.2d 868 (Cal.)) An injured person, however, is not
ordinarily in a position to refute such evidence or identify the cause of
the  defect,  for  he  can  hardly  be  familiar  with  the  manufacturing
process  as  the  manufacturer  himself  is.  In  leaving  it  to  the  jury  to
decide  whether  the  inference  has  been  dispelled,  regardless  of  the
evidence  against  it,  the  negligence  rule  approaches  the  rule  of  strict
liability.  It  is  needlessly  circuitous  to  make  negligence  the  basis  of
recovery  and  impose  what  is  in  reality  liability  without  negligence.  If
public  policy  demands  that  a  manufacturer  of  goods  be  responsible
for their quality regardless of negligence there is no reason not to ﬁx
that responsibility openly.

In  the  case  of  foodstuffs,  the  public  policy  of  the  state  is
formulated in a criminal statute. The statute imposes criminal liability
not only if the food is adulterated, but if its container, which may be a
bottle has any deleterious substance or renders the product injurious
to  health.  The  criminal  liability  under  the  statute  attaches  without
proof  of  fault,  so  that  the  manufacturer  is  under  the  duty  of
ascertaining whether an article manufactured by him is safe. Statutes
of this kind result in a strict liability of the manufacturer in tort to the
member of the public injured.

The  statute  may  well  be  applicable  to  a  bottle  whose  defects
cause  it  to  explode.  In  any  event  it  is  signiﬁcant  that  the  statute
imposes  criminal  liability  without  fault,  reflecting  the  public  policy  of
protecting the public from dangerous products placed on the market,
irrespective of negligence in their manufacture. While the Legislature
imposes criminal liability only with regard to food products and their
containers, there are many other sources of danger. It is to the public
interest  to  prevent  injury  to  the  public  from  any  defective  goods  by
the imposition of civil liability generally.

The retailer, even though not equipped to test a product, is under
an  absolute  liability  to  his  customer,  for  the  implied  warranties  of
ﬁtness for proposed use and merchantable quality include a warranty
is  not  necessarily  a
of  safety  of  the  product.  This  warranty
contractual one for public policy requires that the buyer be insured at
the  seller’s  expense  against  injury.  The  courts  recognize,  however,
that  the  retailer  cannot  bear  the  burden  of  this  warranty,  and  allow
him  to  recoup  any  losses  by  means  of  the  warranty  of  safety
attending  the  wholesaler’s  or  manufacturer’s  sale  to  him.  Such  a
procedure, however, is needlessly circuitous and engenders wasteful
litigation. Much would be gained if the injured person could base his
action directly on the manufacturer’s warranty.

health  and  safety  it  must  give
rights to others than the dealer.
In the words of Judge Cardozo
in  the  McPherson  case:  “The
dealer  was
indeed  the  one
person  of  whom  it  might  be
said  with  some  approach  to
certainty  that  by  him  the  car
would  not  be  used.  Yet,  the
defendant  would  have  us  say
that  he  was  the  one  person
whom it was under a legal duty to protect. The law does not lead us
to  so  inconsequent  a  solution.”  While  the  defendant’s  negligence  in
the  McPherson  case  made  it  unnecessary  for  the  court  to  base
liability  on  warranty,  Judge  Cardozo’s  reasoning  recognized  the
injured person as the real party in interest and effectively disposed of
the  theory  that  the  liability  of  the  manufacturer  incurred  by  his
warranty should apply only to the immediate purchaser. It thus paves
the way for a standard of liability that would make the manufacturer
guarantee the safety of his product even when there is no negligence.
This  court  and  many  others  have  extended  protection  according
to  such  a  standard  to  consumers  of  food  products,  taking  the  view
that the right of a consumer injured by unwholesome food does not
depend  “upon  the  intricacies  of  the  law  of  sales”  and  that  the
warranty of the manufacturer to the consumer in absence of privity of
contract  rests  on  public  policy.  Dangers  to  life  and  health  inhere  in
other consumers’ goods that are defective and there is no reason to
differentiate them from the dangers of defective food products.

In  the  food  products  cases  the  courts  have  resorted  to  various
ﬁctions to rationalize the extension of the manufacturer’s warranty to
the consumer: that a warranty runs with the chattel; that the cause of
action of the dealer is assigned to the consumer; that the consumer
is  a  third  party  beneﬁciary  of  the  manufacturer’s  contract  with  the

dealer. They have also held the manufacturer liable on a mere ﬁction
of negligence: “Practically he must know it [the product] is ﬁt, or bear
the  consequences  if  it  proves  destructive.”  Such  ﬁctions  are  not
necessary  to  ﬁx  the  manufacturer’s  liability  under  a  warranty  if  the
warranty is severed from the contract of sale between the dealer and
the  consumer  and  based  on  the  law  of  torts  as  a  strict  liability.
Warranties  are  not  necessarily  rights  arising  under  a  contract.  An
action on a warranty “was, in its origin, a pure action of tort,” and only
late  in  the  historical  development  of  warranties  was  an  action  in
assumpsit allowed.

As  handicrafts  have  been  replaced  by  mass  production  with  its
great  markets  and  transportation  facilities,  the  close  relationship
between  the  producer  and  consumer  of  a  product  has  been  altered.
Manufacturing  processes,  frequently  valuable  secrets,  are  ordinarily
either  inaccessible  to  or  beyond  the  ken  of  the  general  public.  The
consumer  no  longer  has  means  or  skill  enough  to  investigate  for
himself the soundness of a product, even when it is not contained in a
sealed  package,  and  his  erstwhile  vigilance  has  been  lulled  by  the
steady efforts of manufacturers to build up conﬁdence by advertising
and  marketing  devices  such  as  trade-marks.  Consumers  no  longer
approach  products  warily  but  accept  them  on  faith,  relying  on  the
reputation of the manufacturer or the trademark. Manufacturers have
sought  to
increasingly  high  standards  of
inspection  and  a  readiness  to  make  good  on  defective  products  by
way  of  replacements  and  refunds.  The  manufacturer’s  obligation  to
the  consumer  must  keep  pace  with  the  changing  relationship
between  them;  it  cannot  be  escaped  because  the  marketing  of  a
product  has  become  so  complicated  as  to  require  one  or  more
intermediaries. Certainly there is greater reason to impose liability on
the  manufacturer  than  on  the  retailer  who  is  but  a  conduit  of  a
product that he is not himself able to test.

justify  that  faith  by

The manufacturer’s liability should, of course, be deﬁned in terms
of the safety of the product in normal and proper use, and should not

extend to injuries that cannot be traced to the product as it reached
the market.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Subsequent  Adoption.   In  1963,  Justice  Traynor  wrote  the
majority opinion in Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc., 377 P.2d
897 (Cal. 1963) formally adopting the same theory of strict liability he
endorsed in Escola for identical reasons. In Greenman, a power lathe
manufactured  by  the  defendant  hurt  the  plaintiff.  One  of  the  legal
problems  the  plaintiff  had  with  recovering  under  a  warranty  theory
was  that  state  law  demanded  that  a  plaintiff  give  a  timely  notice  of
breach  of  warranty  to  anyone  he  intended  to  pursue  on  a  warranty
theory.  The  plaintiff,  not  realizing  the  possible  claim  against  the
remote manufacturer, failed to comply with this notice obligation. The
court nevertheless permitted the plaintiff to recover on this new tort
theory of strict liability due to the defect in the product that rendered
it  dangerous.  The  court  summarized  the  plaintiff’s  right  to  recover
under this theory of absolute liability, as follows:

Implicit  in  the  machine’s  presence  on  the  market  .  .  .  was  a
representation  that  it  would  safely  do  the  jobs  for  which  it  was
built.  Under  these  circumstances,  it  should  not  be  controlling
whether  plaintiff  selected  the  machine  because  of  statements  in
[a]  brochure,  or  because  of  the  machine’s  own  appearance  of
excellence  that  belied  the  defect  lurking  beneath  the  surface,  or
because  he  merely  assumed  that  it  would  safely  do  the  jobs  it
was built to do. It should not be controlling whether the details of
the  sales  from  manufacturer  to  retailer  and  from  retailer  to
plaintiff’s  wife  were  such  that  one  or  more  of  the  implied
warranties of the sales act arose. To establish the manufacturer’s
liability,  it  was  sufﬁcient  that  plaintiff  proved  that  he  was  injured
while  using  the  [lathe]  in  a  way  it  was  intended  to  be  used  as  a

result of a defect in design and manufacture of which plaintiff was
not aware that made the [lathe] unsafe for its intended use.

C. Restatement (Second) §402A (1965)

Within just a few years after the formal adoption of the legal theory of
strict  products  liability  in  Greenman,  Restatement  (Second)  §402A
was  published.  It  was  quickly  adopted  by  most  jurisdictions.  It  has
become  the  most  cited  and  influential  provision  in  the  entire
Restatement. It contemplates liability as follows:

§402A Special Liability of Seller of Product for Physical Harm
to User or Consumer

(1)  One  who  sells  any  product  in  a  defective  condition
unreasonably  dangerous  to  the  user  or  consumer  or  to  his
property is subject to liability for physical harm thereby caused
to the ultimate user or consumer, or to his property, if

(a) the seller engaged in the business of selling such a

product, and

(b)  it  is  expected  to  and  does  reach  the  user  or
consumer  without  substantial  change  in  the  condition  in
which it is sold.

(2) The rule stated in Subsection (1) applies although

(a)  the  seller  has  exercised  all  possible  care  in  the

preparation and sale of his product, and

(b)  the  user  or  consumer  has  not  bought  the  product
from or entered into any contractual relation with the seller.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Section  402  A  Reflection  of  MacPherson  and  Escola.   How  are
the  decisions  in  MacPherson  and  Escola/Greenman  reflected  by
§402A?  In  the  stream  of  commerce,  which  sellers  would  face  strict
liability  under  its  provisions?  What  sorts  of  losses  create  strict
liability?  There  has  more  recently  been  published  a  Restatement
(Third) of Torts: Products Liability (1998), but its provisions have not
been  as  widely  received  or  embraced  as  §402A  from  the  Second
Restatement.

2.  Warranty  Law,  Negligence  Law,  and  Strict  Liability.   While  one
might  read  the  foregoing  cases  and  conclude  that  strict  liability  law
has  wholly  displaced  any  continued  role  for  warranty  or  negligence
law when a consumer is hurt by a product, this would be misleading.
While  an  injured  party  might  not  need  to  resort  to  the  “intricacies  of
the law of sales” in order to seek recompense, that avenue can still be
available.  Both  claims  for  breach  of  express  and  implied  warranties
are  generally  governed  today  by  Article  2  of  the  U.C.C.  On  such
claims, the U.C.C. does not stake out a certain position on the privity
requirement,  instead  leaving  a  few  options  to  courts,  with  a  range
from (a) only the purchaser, immediate family, and household guests
being  allowed  to  sue  for  breach  of  warranty  to  (b)  all  those
foreseeably  injured  by  the  breach  of  warranty  for  the  product  being
permitted to sue. Why would someone jump through the extra hoops
necessary to bring a warranty claim? Sometimes the remedies might
be broader (including the possibility of recovering for purely economic
losses) or the breach might help to facilitate a broader attack against
the  seller  under  a  state’s  deceptive  trade  practices  statute  (which
might permit recovery of attorney’s fees or trebled damages). Finally,
it  might  be  that  under  a  state’s  particular  deﬁnitions  of  a  product
“defect” that a warranty claim might be subject to a different standard
than a strict liability claim. (We will see this latter scenario later in this
chapter in the Denny v. Ford Motor Co. case.) Also, negligence claims

can likewise be brought in addition to a strict liability claim. It may be
that  the  plaintiff  is  able  to  conjure  up  evidence  of  traditional  fault
against a product seller and might want the jury to be able to receive
this incriminating evidence. Further, the consumer might even be able
to  offer  evidence  of  gross  negligence  to  justify  a  submission  on
punitive  damages  to  the  jury.  Thus,  while  the  emergence  of  strict
products liability law has freed consumers of the necessity of relying
upon  warranty  and  negligence  causes  of  action,  these  alternative
claims are still available in some circumstances.

3.  Defects  that  Are  Unreasonably  Dangerous.   Comment  g  to
Restatement  (Second)  402A  describes  a  “defective  condition”  as
follows:

it

leaves  the  seller’s  hands,

The rule stated in this Section applies only where the product is, at
the  time
in  a  condition  not
the  ultimate  consumer,  which  will  be
contemplated  by
unreasonably  dangerous  to  him.  The  seller  is  not  liable  when  he
delivers  the  product
in  a  safe  condition,  and  subsequent
mishandling  or  other  causes  make  it  harmful  by  the  time  it  is
consumed.  The  burden  of  proof  that  the  product  was  in  a
defective  condition  at  the  time  that  it  left  the  hands  of  the
particular  seller  is  upon  the  injured  plaintiff;  and  unless  the
evidence can be produced which will support the conclusion that
it was then defective, the burden is not sustained.

D. Strict Liability Is for Product Sellers

The whole concept of strict liability to injured consumers for defective
goods  is  applied  solely  against  product  sellers.  And  this  is  true  only
for  those  who  are  regularly  engaged  in  the  business  of  selling  the
goods.  After  all,  only  product  sellers  would  have  an  opportunity  to
recoup  their  liability  losses  by  adjusting  the  price  of  the  goods.  In
some cases, it is obvious that a defendant was a seller of the product

that hurt the plaintiff. But in our modern society with complex means
of selling and distributing goods, sometimes who constitutes a seller
is not so clear. Consider the very recent decision in the following case
against  Amazon.  As  you  read  the  court’s  opinion,  do  you  agree  that
Amazon was not a seller?

AMAZON.COM, INC. v. McMILLAN
2021 Tex. LEXIS 624 (Tex. 2021)

     , J.

Texas  law  imposes  strict  liability  on  manufacturers  and  some
sellers  of  defective  products.  In  the  ﬁrst  few  decades  after  we
recognized  common-law  strict  products  liability,  the  people  and
entities  held  liable  were  typically  part  of  a  conventional  distribution
chain:  upstream  manufacturers,  mid-stream  distributors,  and
downstream  retailers.1  Today,  third-party  e-commerce  platforms —
such  as  Amazon,  eBay,  Etsy,  and  Alibaba — provide  many  of  the
services traditionally performed by distributors and retailers, enabling
merchants  from  all  over  the  world  to  reach  consumers  directly.  But
are  such  online  marketplaces  strictly  liable  for  defective  products
manufactured  and  owned  by  third  parties?  The  Fifth  Circuit  asks
whether Amazon.com is a “seller” under Texas law when it does not
hold title to third-party products sold on its website but controls the
process of the transaction and delivery.

We answer no. The Legislature’s deﬁnition of “seller” in Chapter 82
of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code is consistent with and does
not  expand  the  common-law  deﬁnition.  Under  that  deﬁnition,  when
the  ultimate  consumer  obtains  a  defective  product  through  an
ordinary  sale,  the  potentially  liable  sellers  are  limited  to  those  who
relinquished  title  to  the  product  at  some  point  in  the  distribution
chain.  Therefore,  Amazon  is  not  a  “seller”  of  third-party  products
under Texas law.

BACKGROUND

Amazon.com  is  an  e-commerce  company  with  a  global  reach.  From
its beginnings as a small online bookseller, Amazon has expanded its
business  model  to  include  general  consumer  retail,  digital  content
streaming,  web  services,  and — more  recently — groceries.  Amazon’s
online  retail  marketplace  offers  Amazon-branded  products,  third
party-branded products owned by Amazon and listed on the website
as “sold by” Amazon, and products owned and “sold by” third parties.
According to the website’s “Conditions of Use,” to which all customers
must agree when making a purchase, Amazon makes no warranties
for  products
third-party  merchants  and  disclaims
responsibility for third-party product descriptions. Other than a short
line of text under the “buy” button identifying the seller, the experience
of purchasing products “sold by” third-party merchants is no different
from  buying  products  “sold  by”  Amazon.2  When  a  customer
purchases  a  third-party  product  listed  on  Amazon.com,  Amazon
processes  payment,  retains  a  portion  of  the  purchase  price,  and
remits the remainder to the third-party merchant.

“sold  by”

A third-party merchant who sells a product through Amazon.com
may  store  and  ship  that  product  itself  or  use  the  Fulﬁllment  by
Amazon  (FBA)  logistics  service.  Under  FBA,  the  merchant  uses
Amazon  warehouses  to  store  product
inventory,  and  Amazon
packages  a  product  when  it  is  sold  and  delivers  it  to  a  carrier  for
shipment to the purchaser. The merchant retains title to its products
prior  to  the  ultimate  customer  purchase.  But  Amazon  maintains
signiﬁcant  control  over  products  sold  through  FBA.  Amazon  has  the
ability  to  refuse  products  and  controls  all  aspects  of  customer
service.  Amazon  also  processes  returns  and  delivers  customer
refunds  for  FBA  products,  and  merchants  must  reimburse  Amazon
for these costs.

This suit concerns a product “sold by” a third-party merchant that
used  the  FBA  service.  According  to  the  allegations  of  the  complaint

ﬁled  in  federal  court,  Morgan  McMillan’s  husband  purchased  a
remote  control  on  Amazon.com  that  was  “sold  by”  “USA  Shopping
7693.”  Almost  a  year  later,  McMillan’s  nineteen-month-old  daughter
opened  the  remote’s  battery  compartment  and  swallowed  the
included button battery. Though the battery was surgically removed,
battery  fluid  caused  permanent  damage  to  the  child’s  esophagus.
When  McMillan  sought
information  from  Amazon  about  “USA
Shopping 7693,” Amazon identiﬁed the account as belonging to Hu Xi
Jie,  an  FBA  user  with  an  address  in  China.  Amazon  subsequently
suspended  Hu  Xi  Jie’s  account  and  removed  the  remote  from  its
website.

McMillan  sued  both  Amazon  and  Hu  Xi  Jie  in  the  U.S.  District
Court  for  the  Southern  District  of  Texas,  alleging  strict  liability  for
design and marketing defects. McMillan attempted to serve Hu Xi Jie
through the Texas Secretary of State but Hu Xi Jie did not answer or
make  an  appearance.  At  the  close  of  discovery,  Amazon  moved  for
summary  judgment  on  the  ground  that  it  was  not  a  seller  of  the
remote  and  therefore  could  not  be  held  strictly  liable.  McMillan
responded  that  Amazon  was  a  non-manufacturing  seller  that  could
be  held  liable  under  the  Texas  Products  Liability  Act.  Although  non-
manufacturing  sellers  typically  are  not  liable  under  the  [Texas’

the
manufacturer is not subject to the jurisdiction of the court. Because
McMillan had alleged that Hu Xi Jie was the manufacturer, and Hu Xi
Jie did not make an appearance, the federal district court concluded
that  McMillan  had  taken  the  initial  steps  required  to  trigger  the
exception.4

retailer  provisions],  an  exception  applies  when

The  district  court  denied  Amazon’s  motion  for  summary
judgment. Applying the Act’s deﬁnition of seller, the court concluded
that: (1) Amazon’s role as a service provider did not preclude it from
also  being  a  seller;  (2)  Amazon’s  possession  and  control  of  the
remote  was  evidence  that  it  engaged  in  the  business  of  placing  the
product in the stream of commerce; (3) Amazon’s lack of title did not

preclude  it  from  being  a  seller;  and  (4)  Amazon’s  relationship  to  the
manufacturer aligned with the policy justiﬁcations for strict liability.

On the parties’ joint motion, the district court certiﬁed its order for
interlocutory  appeal,  and  the  Fifth  Circuit  granted  permission  to
appeal.  Noting  our  track  record  of  deciding  cases  timely,  the  Fifth
Circuit  certiﬁed  the  following  question  to  this  Court,  which  we
accepted.

The statutory meaning of “seller” in Chapter 82 is consistent with
our cases and the Restatements

Before  the  Legislature  adopted  the  Texas  Products  Liability  Act,
sellers  of  defective  products  could  be  held  strictly  liable  under  the
common  law.               (      )             §  402A.  Under  the  Act,
codiﬁed  as  Chapter  82  of  the  Civil  Practice  and  Remedies  Code,  the
general rule is the opposite: a non-manufacturing  seller “is not liable
for  harm  caused  .  .  .  by  [a]  product  unless  the  claimant  proves”  that
one of the enumerated exceptions applies.    .    .     . &    .      
§ 82.003.

Although  the  extent  of  seller  liability  is  different  under  the
common  law  and  Chapter  82,  the  deﬁnition  of  who  constitutes  a
seller  is  similar.  The  statute  deﬁnes  a  seller  as  “a  person  who  is
engaged in the business of distributing or otherwise placing, for any
in  the  stream  of  commerce  for  use  or
commercial  purpose,
consumption a product or any component part thereof.” § 82.001(3).
To  decide  whether  Amazon  is  a  seller  under  Chapter  82,  we  must
determine whether Amazon’s role in the distribution chain amounts to
“distributing  or  otherwise  placing”  a  product  in  the  stream  of
commerce.

Though  statutory  language  should  be  construed  according  to
common  usage,  phrases  that  have  acquired  a  particular  meaning —
whether  by  deﬁnition  or  otherwise — should  be  construed
accordingly.  [W]e  have  concluded  that  concepts  included  in  the

Legislature’s  “seller”  deﬁnition  acquired  particular  meaning  from  our
common-law  products  liability  cases.  The  Texas  common  law  of
products  liability  has  been  shaped  by  section  402A  of  the  Second
Restatement  of  Torts.  When  we  adopted  section  402A  in  1967,  we
identiﬁed  as  sellers  not  only  manufacturers  but  also  non-
manufacturing  distributors.  We  later  recognized  that  dealers  are
sellers. We have also extended seller liability to a limited category of
entities  that  engage  in  “non-sale  commercial  transactions.”  For
example,  entities
to  defective
promotional  goods  with  the  expectation  of  making  future  sales  are
sellers.  Entities  that  retain  title  to  but  share  the  use  of  defective
products as part of a commercial transaction — including bailors and
lessors — can  be  sellers.  Additionally,  those  that  provide  a  mix  of
goods  and  services  may  be  sellers.  Fresh  Coat,  Inc.  v.  K-2,  Inc.,  318
S.W.3d 893, 899 (Tex. 2010) (holding that stucco subcontractor was
seller  of  stucco  that  it  provided  with  installation  services).  Thus,
performance of services does not in itself preclude seller status.

We  have  refused  to  extend  liability  to  all  persons  or  entities
involved  in  the  distribution  chain,  however.  Those  that  provide  both
goods  and  services  are  not  sellers  if  the  provision  of  products  is
incidental  to  the  provision  of  services.  Centerpoint  Builders,  496

sales — such  as  auctioneers,  advertising  agencies,  newspapers,
internet  providers,  and  shipment  companies — are  not  sellers.  See
New Tex. Auto, 249 S.W.3d at 404 (citing             (     )         :

liability”).

The  deﬁnition  of  “seller”  the  Legislature  chose  in  Chapter  82
reflects  these  decisions,  which  bring  certain  non-sale  commercial
transactions within the scope of products liability. The Legislature did
not  limit  its  deﬁnition  to  the  common  meaning  of  seller:  someone
who parts with title for a price. See    .     .  &     .        §  2.106(a);
Hegar v. Am. Multi-Cinema, Inc., 605 S.W.3d 35, 42 (Tex. 2020). Such
ordinary  sellers  are  covered  by  the  portion  of  the  deﬁnition  that
includes  those  “engaged  in  the  business  of  distributing”  a  product.
   .     .      .  &     .        §  82.001(3);  Distributor,       ’      
            (11th  ed.  2019)  (deﬁning  “distributor”  as  a  “supplier  that
sells  chiefly  to  .  .  .  commercial  users”).  But  Chapter  82  sellers  also
include non-selling entities that, for a commercial purpose, “otherwise
plac[e]” products in the stream of commerce for use or consumption,
thus  occupying  a  position  equivalent  to  those  who  make  sales.  See,
e.g.,  McKisson,  416  S.W.2d  at  792  (“One  who  delivers  an  advertising
sample to another with the expectation of proﬁting therefrom through
future  sales  is  in  the  same  position  as  one  who  sells  the  product.”).
The  Third  Restatement’s  deﬁnition  of
“selling  or  otherwise
distributing” is thus consistent with, and does not extend beyond, our
common-law  “seller”  deﬁnition.  We  see  no  reason  to  give  the
Legislature’s phrase “distributing or otherwise placing” a substantially
different meaning.

Our dissenting colleagues take a different approach, relying on the
dictionary  deﬁnition  of  “place”  and  picking  out  additional  verbs
mentioned in some of our cases that they view as synonyms — such
as “supplying, delivering, introducing, or releasing the product into the
stream  of  commerce”  or  “physically  conveying  or  transferring
products  within  the  sales  process.”  This  approach  does  not  yield  a
helpful deﬁnition that courts can apply consistently to cases involving
similar facts. For example, does “delivering” or “physically conveying”
make  every  mail  carrier  or  delivery  service  a  seller?  Or  does
“introducing”  or  “releasing”  indicate  that  only  the  person  or  entity  at

the  head  of  the  stream  of  commerce  is  a  seller?  The  dissent’s
approach provides little guidance in answering such questions.

Chapter 82 does not expand liability for those not considered
sellers under the common law

Given  that  Chapter  82  is  more  restrictive  than  the  common  law,  we
see  no  indication  that  the  Legislature  intended  for  “distributing  or
otherwise  placing”  to  include  commercial  behavior  beyond  ordinary
sales  and  previously  qualifying  non-sale  commercial  transactions.
Accordingly, the necessary qualities of those transactions provide the
limits  of  “seller”  status  under  Chapter  82.  Our  cases  show  that  both
sales  and  non-sale  commercial  transactions,  at  a  minimum,  involve
sellers that hold or relinquish title in a product’s distribution chain.

When  the  facts  involve  a  sale  in  the  ordinary  sense,  none  of  our
cases have suggested that anyone other than a person or entity who
has  relinquished  title  in  the  chain  can  be  a  “seller.”  See  Fresh  Coat,
318  S.W.3d  at  899  (holding  stucco  subcontractor  that  purchased
stucco  from  manufacturer  and  sold  it  to  homeowner  as  part  of
installation was “seller”); SSP Partners v. Gladstrong Invs. (USA) Corp.,
275  S.W.3d  444,  457  (Tex.  2008)  (describing  title-transferring
importer  as  “seller”  of  butane  lighters  to  non-manufacturing  retail
“seller”);  see  also  Firestone  Steel  Prods.,  927  S.W.2d  at  616  (holding
designer of original product concept was not liable for injuries caused
by manufacturer who copied and modiﬁed product’s design because
designer  was  not  involved  in  production  or  distribution  of  defective
product).11

Likewise, when a non-sale commercial transaction occurs, none of
our cases have suggested that anyone other than those who have at
least held title in the chain can be a seller. See McKisson, 416 S.W.2d
at 790-92 (holding distributor that gratuitously transferred title to hair-
product  sample  with  expectation  of  future  sales  was  seller);
Armstrong, 570 S.W.2d at 376-77 (acknowledging that bailor may be

held  liable  for  defective  products  provided  for  public  use  when
“bailment for mutual beneﬁt” accompanies a future sale of the bailed
property,  other  property,  or  services);  Rourke,  530  S.W.2d  at  800-01
(holding  rental  company  that  held  title  to  and  rented  out  defective
scaffolding was subject to strict liability). Our cases and Chapter 82’s
language  indicate  that  ordinary  sales  and  non-sale  commercial
transactions are distinct from one another; there is no indication that
the  Legislature  intended  for  non-sale  concepts  to  apply  when  a  sale
occurs.  The  “or”  conjunction  in  “distributing  or  otherwise  placing”
suggests that a person or entity may become a “seller” by engaging in
one  of  the  transaction  types,  but  not  both.12  See  also             
(     )           :      .      .  §  20  (deﬁning  “selling  or  otherwise
distributing”  to  require  a  transfer  of  ownership  unless  a  non-sale
commercial transaction is involved).

Our  cases  also  have  acknowledged  that  non-sale  liability  is
possible only when the person or entity provides the product in a way
that puts them in the same position as one making a sale. We have
not  imposed  non-sale  liability  on  bailees  or  consignees  in  cases
where  a  sale  occurs.  See  New  Tex.  Auto,  249  S.W.3d  at  402,  404
(holding  that  commercial  auctioneers  do  not  place,  but  merely
facilitate  the  placement  of,  products  in  the  stream  of  commerce);
            (     )         :     .     . § 20 cmt. g (“Sales personnel
and  commercial  auctioneers  are  also  outside  the  rules  of  this
Restatement.”).

Thus,  the  district  court’s  statement  that  “Texas  law  does  not
require an entity to transfer title or sell a product to be considered a
seller”  is  not  generally  applicable.  In  cases  where  an  ordinary  sale
occurs,  a  sale  analysis — transfer  of  title  for  a  price — is  used  to
identify which person or entity qualiﬁes as a seller of the product.

Considering title to determine seller status is also consistent with

approach,  many  courts  have  concluded  that  Amazon  is  not  a  seller
when it does not hold or relinquish title to the product. See, e.g., State
Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Amazon.com, Inc., 835 F. App’x 213, 216 (9th
Cir.  2020)  (holding  that  Amazon  was  not  a  “seller”  under  Arizona’s
common-law  Restatement-based  multi-factor  test,  under  which
holding  title  is  a  factor);  Erie  Ins.  Co.  v.  Amazon.com,  Inc.,  925  F.3d
135,  144  (4th  Cir.  2019)  (concluding  that  Amazon  did  not  hold  title
and  thus  was  not  a  “seller”  under  Maryland  law,  which  is  based  on
Restatement  section  402A);  Eberhart  v.  Amazon.com,  Inc.,  325  F.
Supp. 3d 393, 397-98 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (concluding that “regardless of
what  attributes  are  necessary  to  place  an  entity  within  the  chain  of
distribution, the failure to take title to a product places that entity on
the outside,” and such a requirement is reinforced by the Restatement
(Third) of Torts: Products Liability); but see State Farm Fire & Cas. Co.
v.  Amazon.com  Servs.,  Inc.,  70  Misc.  3d  697,  137  N.Y.S.3d  884,  889
(Sup.  Ct.  2020)  (disagreeing  with  Eberhart  that  title  is  dispositive
under New York law).

In  sum,  we  conclude  that  when  a  product-related  injury  arises
from  a  transaction  involving  a  sale,  sellers  are  those  who  have
relinquished  title  to  the  allegedly  defective  product  at  some  point  in
the chain of distribution. The rule that a person need not transfer title
to  be  held  strictly
limited  to  non-sale  commercial
transactions.

is

Amazon is not a “seller” under Texas law when it does not hold or
relinquish title to an allegedly defective product

Having  explained  the  relevant  legal  principles,  we  next  apply  those
principles to answer the Fifth Circuit’s question. Here, the summary-
judgment evidence shows that the distribution chain concluded with
a  sale  to  the  consumer:  McMillan  obtained  title  to  the  remote  for  a
price. She did not engage in a non-sale commercial transaction, such
as receiving the remote through a lease or as a promotional sample.

Therefore,  Amazon  is  a  “seller”  if  it  either  made  the  ultimate  sale  to
McMillan  or  relinquished  title  at  some  point  upstream
in  the
distribution chain. Amazon did neither.

First, Amazon did not make the ultimate consumer sale because
Amazon did not hold title to the remote and relinquish it to McMillan;
Hu  Xi  Jie  held  title  at  the  time  of  transfer.  McMillan  argues  that
Amazon’s Conditions of Use — which provide for transfer of title upon
Amazon’s delivery of a product to the shipping company — establish
that  Amazon  transferred  title  to  her.  But  Amazon’s  ability  to  transfer
title  from  Hu  Xi  Jie  to  a  purchaser  does  not  confer  title  on  Amazon.
Amazon’s  possession  and  transfer  of  Hu  Xi  Jie’s  products  could  be
considered  an  entrustment,  but  entrustments  do  not  make  an
entrustee a “seller” for strict-liability purposes.

Second, there is no evidence that Amazon held or relinquished title
to the remote at any point upstream from the sale to McMillan. As an
FBA  user,  Hu  Xi  Jie  maintained  title  to  the  inventory  even  while
Amazon  had  possession.  Possession  followed  by  a  transfer  of  title
between  third  parties  does  not  constitute  a  sale.  In  fact,  none  of
Amazon’s  upstream  actions — such  as  web  hosting,  advertising,
marketing,  warehousing,  payment  processing,  and  shipping —
constituted  a  sale  under  Texas  law.  Nor  does  considering  these
actions  together  change  the  result.  By  offering  a  suite  of  marketing,
ﬁnancing,  and  logistics  services  to  third-party  sellers,  Amazon  has
developed  a  business  model  that  is  not  title  dependent.  And  though
Amazon’s business model gives the company a signiﬁcant amount of
control  over  the  process  of  the  transaction  and  the  delivery  of  the
product,  this  control  does  not  transform  an  otherwise  non-title-
holding sales facilitator into a “seller.”

CONCLUSION

To  be  liable  as  a  non-manufacturing  seller  of  defective  products
under  section  82.003,  an  entity  must  ﬁrst  qualify  as  a  seller  under

section  82.001.  We  hold  that  “sellers”  under  section  82.001  are
persons  or  entities  engaged  in  the  business  of  distributing  products
in  the  stream  of
through  ordinary  sales  or  placing  products
commerce  through  non-sale  commercial  transactions.  Because  the
product  in  this  case  was  sold  on  Amazon’s  website  by  a  third  party
and  Amazon  did  not  hold  or  relinquish  title,  Amazon  is  not  a  seller
even  though  it  controlled  the  process  of  the  transaction  and  the
delivery  of  the  product.  We  answer  the  Fifth  Circuit’s  certiﬁed
question no.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Transfer of Title as Condition of Seller Status.   The  court  in  the
above opinion ﬁnds that in most cases to be a “seller” of a product for
strict  product  liability  purposes,  one  has  to  have  received  title  and
then bestowed the title upon another in the stream of commerce. As
the  court  mentions,  other  courts  have  reached  the  same  conclusion
regarding similar Amazon “sales.” This narrow sense of being a seller
perhaps makes sense and is a fairly bright line rule to apply. But given
the policies underlying strict products liability, does it make sense to
limit liability in this manner?

2. Common  Law  Liability  Up  and  Down  the  Stream  of  Commerce.
Restatement  (Second)  402A  establishes  liability  for  any  seller  of  a
defective  product  within  the  stream  of  commerce — manufacturers,
wholesalers,  distributors,  and  retailers.  So  long  as  the  defendant  is
regularly engaged in the sale of goods, and the product is proven to
have  contained  an  unreasonably  dangerous  “defect”  at  the  time  the
defendant  sold  the  item,  that  seller  is  liable.  In  effect,  the  common
law  recognizes  a  joint  liability  for  all  sellers  of  the  defective  product
that  hurt  the  plaintiff.  The  common  law  also  has  recognized,  within
the  stream  of  commerce,  that  there  is  an  implied  right  to  be
indemniﬁed  by  a  seller  further  upstream  from  the  defendant  seller

held  liable  to  the  plaintiff.  For  example,  if  a  retailer  is  liable  to  the
plaintiff for a defective good received (in that same condition) from a
wholesaler,  the  retailer  can  sue  the  wholesaler  for  complete
indemniﬁcation.  Of  course,  the  wholesaler  can  then  sue  the
manufacturer  for  indemniﬁcation  as  well,  so  long  as  the  defective
condition existed when the manufacturer initially sold the product. In
this  way,  the  plaintiff  has  multiple  sources  for  redress  for  injuries
caused  by  defective  products,  and  (due  to  the  indemnity  rights)  the
loss  theoretically  will  be  borne  by  the  seller  that  was  the  original
source  of  the  defect.  In  cases  where  the  only  allegations  against
various sellers involve their conduct in selling the defective good (as
contrasted with some other act of negligence), there is no reason to
have  the  jury  apportion  fault  among  the  sellers.  If  there  is  any
apportionment  question,  there  would  simply  be  a  line  item  for  the
product  itself.  The  percentage  fault  attributed  to  the  product  would
create  a  joint  liability  for  the  sellers  of  the  product  (much  like
vicarious  liability  creates  a  joint  liability  for  both  employee  and
employer).  Of  course,  in  reality,  the  ultimate  economic  loss  likely  is
not  left  on  the  shoulders  of  even  the  manufacturer.  As  Justice
Traynor argued in Escola, manufacturers can pass on such losses to
the  consumers  of  their  products  by  simply  raising  the  price  on  the
good to reflect such liabilities.

3.  Who  Is  a  Seller?   A  related  interesting  issue  has  arisen
concerning  who  qualiﬁes  as  a  product  “seller.”  First,  some  plaintiffs
have  attempted  to  hold  service  providers  strictly  liable  when  their
service  involved  the  use  of  a  product  that  contained  a  defect.  For
example, in Newmark v. Gimbel’s, Inc., 258 A.2d 697 (N.J. 1969), the
plaintiff  was  hurt  while  receiving  service  at  a  beauty  parlor  by
allegedly  defective  permanent  wave  solution.  The  salon  owner
resisted the strict liability claim, arguing that she was selling services
rather  than  products.  The  New  Jersey  court  permitted  the  strict
liability  claim.  The  court  distinguished  beauty  parlors  from  other
professional  service  providers.  Two  years  earlier,  in  Magrine  v.

Krasnica,  227  A.2d  539  (N.J.  1967)  the  same  court  held  that  strict
products liability could not be applied to a claim against a dentist who
attempted  to  use  a  hypodermic  needle  to  inject  anesthetic  into  the
plaintiff’s gums when it broke off and caused injury to the patient. The
court  found  that  the  dentist  was  providing  professional  services
It  found  that  the
predominantly  rather  than  selling  products.
rationales  behind  imposing  strict  liability  on  product  sellers  had  no
application to professionals. Other courts tend to agree that when the
primary  purpose  behind  the  transaction  is  to  bestow  a  professional
service  rather  than  sell  a  product,  strict
liability  should  be
inapplicable. See, e.g., Easterly v. HSP of Texas, Inc., 772 S.W.2d 211,
213 (Tex. App. — Dallas 1989) (hospital could not be held strictly liable
for defective catheter used at hospital on patient as it was an integral
part of the professional services, not a separate product sale). Courts
have also debated whether commercial lessors of products could be
strictly  liable  as  a  product  “seller”  with  most  concluding  that  strict
liability  should  be  applicable.  See,  e.g.,  Cintrone  v.  Hertz  Truck
Leasing  &  Rental  Service,  212  A.2d  769  (N.J.  1965)  (reversing
dismissal of strict liability claim against Hertz which leased truck that
was not in good working order).

4.  New  vs.  Used  Goods.   An  individual  who  resells  a  used
automobile  or  a  used  appliance  at  a  garage  sale  will  not  face  strict
liability for a defect in those goods because they are not considered
to be in the regular business of selling goods. Whether someone who
engaged  in  the  commercial  re-sale  of  used  products  should  face
strict  liability  is  a  disputed  matter.  Compare  Realmuto  v.  Straub
Motors, 322 A.2d 440 (N.J. 1974) (strict liability applies to dealer who
sells used products) with La Rosa v. Superior Court, 176 Cal. Rptr. 224
(1981) (refusing to apply strict liability to sellers of used goods).

5. Innocent Retailer Statutes.  In contravention of §402A’s liability
up and down the stream of commerce for all sellers, some states by
statute  have  limited  this  liability  with  the  passage  of  so-called
“Innocent  Retailer  Statutes”  that  limit  strict  product  liability,  in  most

cases,  to  sellers  who  are  manufacturers,  thus  shielding  most
distributors  and  retailers  from  liability.  This  arguably  makes  some
sense  as  manufacturers  are  typically  the  ultimate  source  of  any
defect in the goods. Further, limiting liability in this fashion avoids the
multiplicity  of  lawsuits  where,  for  example,  a  retailer  is  held  strictly
liable to a consumer and then ﬁles lawsuits further upstream seeking
common law indemniﬁcation. Because manufacturers often have the
deepest  pockets,  these  statutes  often  are  not  problematic  for  an
injured consumer. But when a manufacturer has become insolvent or
is  beyond  the  court’s  jurisdictional  power  (as  was  the  Chinese
manufacturer in the above Amazon case) an innocent retailer statute
can  be  a  potential  problem.  Fortunately,  these  statutes  often  have
exceptions  where  the  manufacturer,  for  legal  or  practical  reasons,  is
no longer a potential source of recovery — as was apparently true in
the Amazon case.

III  DEFECTS

A. Manufacturing

Restatement  (Second)  §402A  does  not  specify  particular  types  of
defects that may exist in a product. Nevertheless, courts have settled
upon  three  categories  of  product  defects — manufacturing,  design,
and marketing (i.e., warnings). A design defect occurs when the idea
or plans for a product render it unreasonably dangerous. Imagine an
automobile  designer  drawing  up  the  plans  for  a  new  vehicle  with
wheels  held  in  place  by  only  two  lug  nuts.  The  plans  might  be
followed  perfectly  but  the  wheel  will  likely  fail  because  it  is  not
designed to withstand enough physical forces on it to be able to hold
it  securely  to  the  vehicle  over  time.  This  ill-conceived  design  for  a
wheel  might  permit  the  ultimate  characterization  that
it  was
unreasonably dangerous and, therefore, defective. On the other hand,
the design might have called for ﬁve lug nuts (a standard number for
a passenger vehicle) but somewhere during the actual assembly of a
particular  unit  on  the  assembly  line,  one  car  went  through  and  only
received four lug nuts. In other words, the plans were not followed. If
that missing lug nut resulted in a wheel coming loose and causing an
accident  with  injuries,  the  claimant  would  assert  a  manufacturing
defect.  Finally,  if  you  assume  that  even  the  best  designed  and
properly  manufactured  automobile  wheels  might,  over  time,  come
loose due to the physics of their movement, it might be necessary for
the  seller  to  provide  a  warning  accompanying  the  automobile
cautioning that, for example, the tightness of the lug nuts needs to be
checked every 25,000 miles to guarantee they remain tight. A failure
to provide this warning could be evidence of a marketing defect.

Most  would  agree  that  identifying  a  manufacturing  defect  is,  of
the three categories, the most straightforward analysis. This does not

always mean that it will be easy to determine; that is dependent upon
how  clear  the  facts  may  be.  But  courts  generally  agree  as  to  what
they  are  looking  for  when  testing  for  a  manufacturing  defect.  A
manufacturing  defect  is  described  in  the  Restatement  of  Products
Liability  as  a  “physical  departure  from  a  product’s  intended  design.”
Section 1, comment a (1998). In such cases, one is merely comparing
the  plans  with  the  actual  output  of  the  unit  that  hurt  the  plaintiff.  If
the deviation from the plans caused the plaintiff’s injury, plaintiff has
a good manufacturing defect case. Observe that the issue of how or
why  the  defect  occurs  is  irrelevant.  Further,  it  makes  no  difference
how  hard  the  manufacturer  tried  to  prevent  such  errors.  Liability  is
very strict.

The  following  case,  involving  a  claim  by  a  smoker  against  a
tobacco  company,  will  apply  this  straightforward  analysis  by
comparing  the  product  that  hurt  the  plaintiff  with  the  plans  for  that
product.  This  case  actually  involved  manufacturing,  design,  and
marketing  defect  claims.  We  will  revisit  this  case  again,  therefore,  in
each  of  the  next  two  sections  as  we  encounter  those  types  of
defects.

AMERICAN TOBACCO CO. v. GRINNELL
951 S.W.2d 420 (Tex. 1997)

PART 1 — MANUFACTURING DEFECT

      , J.

In  1952,  nineteen-year-old  Wiley  Grinnell  began  smoking  Lucky
Strikes, cigarettes manufactured by the American Tobacco Company.
Almost a year later, Grinnell changed to Pall Malls, also manufactured
by  American.  After  smoking  for  approximately  thirty-three  years,
Grinnell  was  diagnosed  with  lung  cancer  in  July  1985.  Shortly
thereafter,  he  ﬁled  this  lawsuit.  He  died  less  than  a  year  later.

Grinnell’s  family  continued  this  suit  after  his  death,  adding  wrongful
death and survival claims. The family alleges that American failed to
warn  of,  and  actively  concealed,  facts  that  it  knew  or  should  have
known,  including  the  facts  that  Grinnell  could  quickly  become
addicted  to  cigarettes  and  that  his  smoking  could  result  in  injury  or
death  from  the  cancer-causing  ingredients  if  he  used  the  cigarettes
as  American  intended.  They  also  allege  that,  even  though  American
knew  or  should  have  known  that  its  cigarettes  were  dangerous  and
could  not  be  used  safely,  American  represented  to  consumers  that
cigarettes were not harmful, dangerous, or capable of causing injury.

The  Grinnells  assert  [among  other  claims]  strict  liability  design,

marketing, and manufacturing defect [claims].

The  trial  court  granted

[defendant’s  motions  for  summary
judgment]  and  dismissed  the  Grinnells’  suit.  The  court  of  appeals
reversed the trial court’s judgment and remanded the entire case.

The  Grinnells  allege  that  cigarettes  are  both  defective  and
unreasonably  dangerous  under  section  402A  of  the  Restatement
(Second) of Torts. Speciﬁcally, they assert that American’s cigarettes
are  (1)  defectively  designed  because  ingredients  found  in  cigarettes
cause  cancer,  addiction,  and  disease,  (2)  defectively  marketed,
because the cigarette packages contain inadequate warnings, and (3)
defectively  manufactured  because  cigarettes  contain  pesticide
residue. In his deposition taken one month before his death, Grinnell
testiﬁed  that  had  he  known  of  the  dangers  inherent  in  cigarettes  he
would never have started smoking in the ﬁrst place.

In  Texas,  section  402A  of  the  Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts
governs claims for strict liability in tort. Firestone Steel Prods. Co. v.
Barajas,  927  S.W.2d  608,  613  (Tex.  1996);  McKisson  v.  Sales
Affiliates,  Inc.,  416  S.W.2d  787,  788-89  (Tex.  1967).  Section  402A
provides:

(1)  one  who  sells  any  product  in  a  defective  condition  unreasonably
dangerous to the user or consumer or to his property is subject to liability

for physical harm thereby caused to the ultimate user or consumer, or to
his property, if

(a) the seller is engaged in the business of selling such a product,

and

(b) it is expected to and does reach the user or consumer without

substantial change in the condition in which it is sold.

Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts  §402A  (1965).  A  product  may  be
unreasonably dangerous because of a defect in marketing, design, or
manufacturing. Caterpillar, Inc. v. Shears,  911  S.W.2d  379,  382  (Tex.
1995); Technical Chem. Co. v. Jacobs, 480 S.W.2d 602, 604-05 (Tex.
1972). The Grinnells allege that the cigarettes sold by American were
unreasonably dangerous due to each of the three types of defect.

MANUFACTURING DEFECT

We  turn  .  .  .  to  the  Grinnells’  strict  liability  claim  based  on  a
manufacturing defect. The Grinnells assert that American’s products
were  defectively  manufactured  because  they  contained  carcinogens
including  pesticide  residue.  During
and  other  toxic  chemicals,
discovery,  the  Grinnells  obtained  internal  documents  showing  that
American  fumigated  its  Turkish  tobacco  with  Acritet  34,  a  chemical
composed  of  acrylonitrile  and  carbon  tetrachloride.  American  uses
Turkish tobacco in all of its cigarettes. In 1978, American circulated a
memorandum  noting  new  government  regulations  requiring  all
materials containing acrylonitrile to be afﬁxed with a “Cancer Hazard”
warning label. Likewise, the Grinnells allege that American knew that
methyl  bromide  pesticide  residue  remained  in  its  tobacco  after
fumigation.  The  Grinnells  alleged  that  this  potentially  cancerous
pesticide residue contributed to Grinnell’s cancer and resulting death.
Under  Texas  law,  a  plaintiff  has  a  manufacturing  defect  claim
when  a  ﬁnished  product  deviates,  in  terms  of  its  construction  or
quality,  from  the  speciﬁcations  or  planned  output  in  a  manner  that
renders it unreasonably dangerous. See Ford  Motor Co. v. Pool,  688

S.W.2d 879, 881 (Tex. App. — Texarkana 1985), aff’d in part and rev’d
in part on other grounds, 715 S.W.2d 629 (Tex. 1986); see also Lucas
v. Texas Indus., Inc.,  696  S.W.2d  372,  377-78  (Tex.  1984);  Morgan v.
Compugraphic Corp.,  675  S.W.2d  729,  732-33  (Tex.  1984);  Darryl  v.
Ford  Motor  Co.,  440  S.W.2d  630,  632  (Tex.  1969).  The  common-
knowledge  defense  does  not  apply  to  this  type  of  claim  because  a
user does not anticipate a manufacturing defect. This type of defect
is a deviation from the planned output.

American, conceding that its cigarettes contain pesticide residue,
argues  that  summary  judgment  was  proper  because  all  cigarette
manufacturers  fumigate  their  tobacco  with  some  type  of  pesticide,
and  residue  inevitably  remains  after  fumigation.  Thus,  American
concludes  that  the  Grinnells’  claims  based  on  the  presence  of
pesticide residue are actually design defect claims masquerading as
manufacturing defect claims.

transform

residue  does  not

According to the undisputed facts, pesticide residue is incidentally,
yet normally, found in tobacco after it is fumigated. The presence of
pesticide residue is not an anomaly attributable only to the cigarettes
Grinnell smoked. Nevertheless, the fact that all cigarettes potentially
contain  pesticide
the  Grinnells’
manufacturing defect claim into a design defect claim subject to the
common-knowledge defense. Simply because certain precautions or
improvements  in  manufacturing  technology,  which  could  eliminate
pesticide  residue  from  cigarettes,  are  universally  disregarded  by  an
entire  industry  does  not  excuse  their  omission.  See  T.J.  Hooper,  60
F.2d  737,  740  (2d  Cir.),  cert.  denied,  287  U.S.  662  (1932).  Although
pesticide residue may be found in many if not all cigarettes, it is not
an  ingredient  American  intended  to  incorporate  into  its  cigarettes.
Analyzed  in  this  light,  the  presence  of  pesticide  residue  could  be  a
manufacturing  defect,  not  a  design  defect.  Therefore,  American  did
not conclusively negate the existence of a defect in its cigarettes.

We  hold

that  summary

judgment  was

improper  on  the

manufacturing defect claim.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

test

1.  Distinct  Test  for  Manufacturing  Defects.   The

for
manufacturing  defects  assumes  that  the  manufacturer  had  a  good
design, recipe, or plan for the product but something went awry in the
details of actually making the particular product that hurt the plaintiff.
This  is  normally  demonstrated  by  comparing  the  original  plans  or
speciﬁcations  with  the  product  that  hurt  the  plaintiff  to  determine  if
there  is  any  deviation.  Alternatively,  the  plaintiff  can  compare  the
product  causing  her  injuries  with  other  ostensibly  identical  products
made by the same manufacturer to determine if there were any flaws
that  led  to  the  plaintiff’s  injury.  How  did  the  plaintiffs  in  the  tobacco
case  above  demonstrate  that  something  went  awry
in  the
manufacture of the cigarettes? Was the manufacturer really surprised
by the cigarettes that it produced?

2.  Tainted  Food  Products.   Sometimes  manufacturers  of  some
processed food will be sued when a contaminant is found inside their
ﬁnished product that has injured someone. For example, in Jackson v.
Nestle-Beich, Inc., 589 N.E.2d 547 (Ill. 1992), the plaintiff purchased a
chocolate  pecan-caramel  candy  made  by  the  defendant.  When  the
plaintiff bit into the candy, she broke her tooth due to the presence of
a  hard  pecan  shell  within  the  piece  of  candy.  Under  the  normal
analysis  for  a  manufacturing  defect,  one  would  easily  conclude  that
unless  the  recipe  calls  for  a  shell  in  the  ﬁnished  product,  the  candy
that  hurt  the  plaintiff  had  a  manufacturing  defect.  Nevertheless,  the
defendant attempted to invoke a doctrine recognized by a number of
courts — the
this  doctrine,
foreign-natural  doctrine.  Under
manufacturing  defects  only  exist  when  the  unintended  ingredient  is
wholly foreign to the items intended for the ﬁnal prepared food item.
For example, a hair from a rat found in a can of soup would be foreign
to  any  of  the  intended  ingredients.  On  the  other  hand,  because  the
candy  purchased  by  the  plaintiff  was  supposed  to  have  pecans,  the
shell  from  a  pecan  would  be  considered  a  natural  (though

unintended) ingredient and would not create a manufacturing defect.
Many courts, including the Illinois Supreme Court in that case, reject
this  doctrine  because  it  seems  to  inject  issues  of  fault  into  what  is
supposed to be a strict liability analysis.

3.  Problems.   Would  there  appear  to  be  a  good  claim  for  a

manufacturing defect in the following scenarios?

A. A carbonated can of cola contains a shard of loose, sharp metal
that damages the plaintiff’s throat when she attempts to take a
drink from the can.

B.  A  manufacturer  of  latex  gloves  makes  different  models  of  the
gloves  for  use  in  hospitals.  One  model  contains  extra  amounts
of  latex  to  provide  greater  protection  from  germs.  Another
model  is  made  that  contains  less  latex  in  recognition  that
certain users of the gloves might be prone to allergic reactions
to high concentrations of latex. Plaintiff is a nurse at a hospital
who  uses  the  higher  concentration  latex  gloves  and  suffers  a
bad allergic reaction to the gloves.

C.  Defendant  manufactures  artiﬁcial  hip

lost  market  share.  The  competitor  sneaks

joints  for  surgical
implantation  in  patients  with  bad  hips.  A  competitor  decides
that  bad  publicity  for  the  defendant  company  would  help  him
into
regain
defendant’s facility late at night and loosens some of the parts
on  a  number  of  the  artiﬁcial  hips.  When  those  hips  are  later
implanted  into  patients,  the  parts  become  loose  due  to  the
vandalism  and  the  patients  suffer  personal  injuries,  requiring
removal  of  the  hip  implants  and  the  implantation  of  new
devices.  A  number  of  the  patients  ﬁle  a  class  action  against
defendant  citing  the  loosened  parts  as  manufacturing  defects.
Surveillance videos at defendant’s plant reveal the source of the
problem.

4.  Circumstantial  Evidence  Appropriate  Absent  Direct  Proof.   The
indeterminate  product  defect  test  from  the  Restatement  (Third)  of
Torts §3, permits courts to utilize a jury instruction permitting a jury

to rely upon circumstantial evidence to prove a manufacturing defect
in  some  rare  instances.  While  in  most  cases,  direct  evidence  of  a
manufacturing  defect  exists,  where  the  product  is  destroyed  in  the
accident,  it  may  be  that  no  direct  comparison  is  feasible.  In  such
cases, most courts have permitted circumstantial evidence similar to
the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur we studied previously. Of course, like
the  doctrine  of  res  ipsa  loquitur,  the  indeterminate  product  defect
test only makes sense in application when comparison of the product
to  the  manufacturer’s  plans  is  not  available.  Additionally,  because
evidence of a manufacturer’s designs and warnings for its products is
always  available  for  scrutiny,  this  doctrine  necessarily  is  limited  to
potential  manufacturing  defect  theories.  Might  this  doctrine  provide
some assistance to a waitress who gets cut from an exploding bottle
of Coca-Cola but where direct comparison of the product to the plans
is impossible because another employee has innocently thrown away
the evidence?

Upon Further Review

If  one  assumes  a  manufacturer’s  ideas  for  a  product  are  safe
and  appropriate,  any  unplanned  deviations  from  that  idea
constitute  a  manufacturing  or  construction  defect.  If  that
deviation  leads  to  physical  harm  to  the  plaintiff  it  would  be
considered  an  unreasonably  dangerous  manufacturing  defect
that  makes  sellers  of  that  product  strictly  liable — regardless  of
if  the
any  care  undertaken  to  avoid  that  outcome.  Even
defendant  has  production  protocols  that  eliminate  99.9  percent
of  all  possible  errors,  the  one  flawed  unit  that  falls  through  the
cracks and injures the plaintiff still creates liability for the seller.
It  is  the  best  example  of  truly  strict  liability  as  the  focus  is
entirely upon the traits of the product and whether its production
results in some surprising and undesired feature. In most cases,

the  analysis  is  very  concrete,  as  one  simply  compares  the
original  plans  with  the  actual  unit  that  hurt  the  plaintiff.  Where
such direct analysis is not possible — for example, where the unit
is  destroyed  in  the  accident — resort  to  circumstantial  evidence
of a defect might be permissible as well.

B. Design Defects

In  manufacturing  defects,  a  particular  unit
in  the  defendant’s
production  has  deviated  from  the  original  plans.  By  contrast,  design
defect claims involve accusations that the entire product line was ill
conceived.  Recall  the  example  of  the  automobile  manufacturer  who
designs a wheel held in place by only two lug nuts. After these wheels
begin  falling  off  of  customers’  cars  and  causing  injuries,  an  expert
might opine that such design was destined to cause these accidents
because  of  insufﬁcient  support  for  the  weight  of  the  wheels  on  the
vehicle.  The  focus  in  design  defect  claims  is  not  upon  just  the  one
automobile  that  plaintiff  was  driving,  but  upon  the  entire  line  of
identically  designed  cars  containing  this  same  defect.  Courts
emphasize  frequently  that  the  design  of  the  product  is  scrutinized
rather  than  the  designer,  to  contrast  strict  liability  from  negligence.
Yet  under  the  analysis  of  many  courts,  the  line  between  negligence
and  strict  liability  can  be  easily  obscured.  As  you  will  see  in  the
following cases, some courts utilize a consumer expectation test  to
identify  a  design  defect,  while  others  resort  to  a  balancing  analysis
referred  to  as  the  risk  utility  test.  The  difference  in  origin  and
operation  of  these  two  analytical  models  reflects  the  dual  heritage
(warranty and negligence law) of strict products liability.

1. The Consumer Expectation Test

Reflecting  its  warranty  law  heritage,  the  consumer  expectation  test
for  design  defects  focuses  upon  the  expectations  for  the  product’s
performance  by  the  ordinary  consumer  of  the  product.  The  origin  of
this  particular  test  comes  from  comments  contained  within  the
Restatement (Second) of Torts §402A: “The rule stated in this Section
applies  only  where  the  defective  condition  of  the  product  makes  it
unreasonably  dangerous  to  the  user  or  consumer.  The  article  sold
must  be  dangerous  to  an  extent  beyond  that  which  would  be
contemplated  by  the  ordinary  consumer  who  purchases  it,  with  the
ordinary  knowledge  common
its
to
characteristic.”  In  the  Sparks  case  below,  the  California  appellate
court  discusses  when  this  test  is  appropriately  used  in  a  design
defect  case  and  what  evidence  is  appropriately  used  to  analyze  its
application.  Pay  close  attention  to  the  evidence  utilized  by  the
plaintiffs  to  substantiate  their  claims  of  a  design  defect  and  also
observe  the  evidence  defendant  unsuccessfully  argued  should
instead be the focal point.

SPARKS v. OWENS-ILLINOIS, INC.
32 Cal. App. 4th 461 (1995)

      , J.

Owens-Illinois,  Inc.  (Owens-Illinois  or  appellant),  timely  appeals
from  a  judgment  entered  after  a  jury  trial,  by  which  it  was  held  100
percent  responsible  for  personal  injuries  to  Charles  Wayne  Sparks
(Sparks)  and  his  wife,  Betty  Raley  Sparks,  respondents  herein.  The
jury  found  that  an  Owens-Illinois  product,  an  asbestos-containing
thermal insulation known as Kaylo, was defective, and that the defect
was  the  sole  legal  cause  of  injury  to  Sparks.  Appellant  contends
that  .  .  .  [t]here  was  no  evidence  that  Kaylo  was  defective  because
plaintiffs failed to show that it could have been designed more safely,
i.e., without asbestos as a component.

Owens-Illinois made and sold a product known as “Kaylo” between
1948 and 1958. Kaylo was a calcium silicate insulation, made with 13
to  20  percent  asbestos,  which  was  sold  in  pipe-covering  and  block
forms,  and  intended  to  be  used  for  “industrial  high[-]temperature
thermal insulation.” The asbestos used in Kaylo was predominantly of
the  chrysotile  variety  but  amosite  was  also  used  to  a  lesser  extent.
Owens-Illinois sold its Kaylo operation to Owens-Corning Fiberglass in
April  1958.  Owens-Corning  Fiberglass  continued  to  make  and  sell
Kaylo pipe covering and block insulation after April 1958.

Charles  Sparks  joined  the  United  States  Navy  in  1959,  when  he
was 20 years old. Although he originally intended to obtain training as
a draftsman, he was instead sent for training as a metalsmith. Also in
1959,  Sparks  met  and  married  his  wife,  Betty.  Shortly  after  he  was
married, Sparks was sent out on a six-month cruise aboard the heavy
cruiser U.S.S. Bremerton.

The  Bremerton  operated  on  steam  turbines  and,  therefore,  had
many pipes, valves, condensers, heat exchangers, generators, boilers,
and  other  machinery  which  had  to  be  insulated  against  high
temperatures. There was no signiﬁcant work on the insulation during
the  cruise  but,  in  January  or  February  of  1960,  the  Bremerton  was
sent  to  Long  Beach  for  a  decommissioning  overhaul,  which  lasted
approximately  six  months.  Sparks’s  duty  aboard  the  Bremerton
during the decommissioning was to remove and inspect the valves in
the various pipelines. In order for Sparks to do this, the insulation had
to be sawed or cut, and removed from the pipes. A great deal of dust
was  generated  by  the  procedures  Sparks  followed  to  remove  the
insulation  and  the  valves.  At  the  same  time,  the  boilers  and  other
machinery were being overhauled by procedures that also generated
dust  to  which  Sparks  was  exposed.  Regular  cleanup  procedures
during the decommissioning involved the use of compressed air and
fox-tail brooms, both of which generated a large amount of dust.

Plaintiffs presented the deposition testimony of another insulator
who worked at the Puget Sound Shipyard. That witness, Ralph David,

testiﬁed that he had no idea that his workplace exposure to asbestos
could  be  dangerous  to  his  health.  Mr.  David  further  stated  that  both
he  and  the  other  workers  who  ripped  out  and  installed  asbestos-
containing insulation simply assumed that it was part of their job and
that there was no particular danger in it.

Several  medical  experts  testiﬁed  on  behalf  of  the  Sparkses.  Dr.
Barry  Horn  testiﬁed  that  .  .  .  the  exposure  which  Charles  Sparks
experienced  on  the  Bremerton  was  the  most  intense  of  his  lifetime
and  was  “certainly”  sufﬁcient,  “in  and  of  itself,”  to  have  caused  his
mesothelioma.

product markets — in particular,

in

Both  Owens-Illinois  and  the  plaintiffs  submitted  jury  instructions
specifying the “consumer expectation test” for determining whether a
given product was defectively designed . . . and Owens-Illinois joined
in  the  plaintiffs’  request  for  [an  instruction  on  multiple,  independent,
sufﬁcient causes: “Where two or more causes combine to bring about
an injury and any of them operating alone would have been sufﬁcient
to  cause  the  injury,  each  cause  is  considered  to  be  a  legal  cause  of
the  injury  if  it  is  a  material  element  and  a  substantial  factor  in
bringing it about, even though the result would have occurred without
it”].

As to the [plaintiff’s defective design claim, the jury was instructed
that:]  “Charles  and  Betty  Sparks  have  the  burden  of  proving  by  a
preponderance of the evidence all of the facts necessary to establish:
1.  That  defendant  Owens-Illinois,  Inc.’s  product  failed  to  perform  as
safely as an ordinary consumer of that product would expect; 2. That
the  defect  in  design  existed  when  the  product  left  the  defendant’s
possession;  3.  That  the  design  of  the  product  was  a  legal  cause  of
Mr.  Sparks[’s]  injury;  4.  That  the  product  was  used  in  a  manner
reasonably  foreseeable  by  the  defendant;  [and  5.]  the  nature  and
extent of Charles Sparks[’s] and Betty Spark[s’s] injuries.”

Owens-Illinois  contends  that  the  jury  verdict  must  be  reversed
because  there  was  no  showing  that  Kaylo  was  a  defective  product.
That is, Owens-Illinois contends plaintiffs were required to show that
high-temperature  insulation  such  as  Kaylo  could  have  been  more
safely  designed,  i.e.,  without  asbestos,  for  use  aboard  Navy  ships.
Respondent argues that it was not required to make such a showing

in  this  case,  in  which  the  jury  was  properly  instructed  to  apply  only
the  “consumer  expectation”  test  to  determine  whether  appellant’s
product was defectively designed. Respondent has the better of this
argument.

It  is  well  settled  in  California  that  a  manufacturer  may  be  held
strictly  liable  in  tort  for  placing  a  defective  product  on  the  market  if
that product causes personal injury, provided that the injury resulted
from  a  use  of  the  product  that  was  reasonably  foreseeable  by  the
defendant.  This  doctrine  of  strict  liability  extends  to  products  which
have design defects, manufacturing defects, or “warning defects.”

The instant case involves only allegations of design defects. It is,
thus, governed by Barker  [v. Lull  Engineering Co.,  573  P.2d  443  (Cal.
1978)],  where  our  Supreme  Court  held  that  a  product  may  be  found
defective  in  design  under  either  of  two  alternative  theories.  “First,  a
product  may  be  found  defective  in  design  if  the  plaintiff  establishes
that the product failed to perform as safely as an ordinary consumer
would  expect  when  used  in  an  intended  or  reasonably  foreseeable
manner.  Under  this  ﬁrst,  so-called  “consumer  expectation  test,”  a
plaintiff is required to produce evidence of the “objective conditions of
the  product”  as  to  which  the  jury  is  to  employ  its  “own  sense  of
whether  the  product  meets  ordinary  expectations  as  to  its  safety
under the circumstances presented by the evidence.”

The  second  prong  of  the  Barker  test  for  design  defects  is  as
follows: “[A] product may alternatively be found defective in design if
the  plaintiff  demonstrates  that  the  product’s  design  proximately
caused  his  injury  and  the  defendant  fails  to  establish,  in  light  of  the
relevant  factors,  that,  on  balance,  the  beneﬁts  of  the  challenged
design outweigh the risk of danger inherent in such design.” In order
to  satisfy  its  burden  under  this  so-called  “risk-beneﬁt”  theory,  the
defendant  manufacturer  may — but  is  not  required  to — present
evidence  of  the  feasibility  of  a  safer  alternative  design,  the  ﬁnancial
cost  of  an  improved  design,  and  any  adverse  consequences  to  the
product or the consumer from the alternative design.

The  plaintiffs  in  this  case  limited  their  theory  of  recovery  by
electing  to  proceed  only  under  the  “consumer  expectation  test”  for
design defects. Owens-Illinois contends, however, that it was error to
allow the plaintiffs to proceed in this fashion because the “consumer
expectation  test”  is  inappropriate  in  this  case  in  that  the  undisputed
evidence  establishes  that  Kaylo  was  “the  best  possible  product  that
could have been manufactured.” Owens-Illinois further contends that
plaintiffs were required — and failed — to prove that there was a safer
alternative  design  for  Kaylo.  We  reject  these  arguments,  which  are
devoid of factual and legal support.

Our  Supreme  Court  recently  analyzed  the  circumstances  under
which  the  “consumer  expectation  test”  should,  and  should  not,  be
employed.  Soule v. General  Motors  Corp.,  882  P.2d  298  (Cal.  1994).
The  court  held  that  “the  consumer  expectations  test  is  reserved  for
cases  in  which  the  everyday  experience  of  the  product’s  users
permits  a  conclusion  that  the  product’s  design  violated  minimum
safety  assumptions,  and  is  thus  defective  regardless  of  expert
opinion about the merits of the design.” The Soule court further held
that  where  the  consumer  expectation  test  applies,  evidence  of  the
relative risks and beneﬁts of the design is irrelevant and inadmissible:
“If the facts permit such a conclusion, and if the failure resulted from
the  product’s  design,  a  ﬁnding  of  defect  is  warranted  without  any
further  proof.  The  manufacturer  may  not  defend  a  claim  that  a
product’s design failed to perform as safely as its ordinary consumers
would  expect  by  presenting  expert  evidence  of  the  design’s  relative
risks and beneﬁts.”

On  the  other  hand,  our  Supreme  Court  held  that  the  “consumer
expectation test” should not be used where the alleged injury resulted
from products whose characteristics or performance are beyond the
understanding  or  common  experience  of  those  who  ordinarily  use
them.  .  .  .  Such  “instances”  include  claims  involving  “complex”
products  which  “cause  injury  in  a  way  that  does  not  engage  its

ordinary  consumers’  reasonable  minimum  assumptions  about  safe
performance.”

The  Soule  case  provides  a  good  example  of  a  situation  in  which
the  consumer  expectation  test  is  not  appropriate.  There,  the  court
was  confronted  with  a  complicated  claim  that  General  Motors’
defective  design  of  the  wheel  assembly  and  front  floorboard
enhanced the injuries the plaintiff suffered when another car collided
with  the  left  front  wheel  area  of  her  automobile.  As  the  court
explained, “Plaintiff’s theory of design defect was one of technical and
mechanical  detail.  It  sought  to  examine  the  precise  behavior  of
several  obscure  components  of  her  car  under  the  complex
circumstances  of  a  particular  accident.  The  collision’s  exact  speed,
angle, and point of impact were disputed. It seems settled, however,
that  plaintiff’s  Camaro  received  a  substantial  oblique  blow  near  the
left  front  wheel,  and  that  the  adjacent  frame  members  and  bracket
assembly  absorbed  considerable  inertial  force.”  The  court  held  that
the  consumer  expectation  test  should  not  have  been  used:  “An
ordinary  consumer  of  automobiles  cannot  reasonably  expect  that  a
car’s frame, suspension, or interior will be designed to remain intact in
any  and  all  accidents.  Nor  would  ordinary  experience  and
understanding  inform  such  a  consumer  how  safely  an  automobile’s
design  should  perform  under  the  esoteric  circumstances  of  the
collision  at  issue  here.  Indeed,  both  parties  assumed  that  quite
complicated  design  considerations  were  at  issue,  and  that  expert
testimony was necessary to illuminate these matters.”

There  were  neither  “complicated  design  considerations,”  nor
“obscure components,” nor “esoteric circumstances” surrounding the
“accident” in the instant case. Kaylo was a common type of asbestos-
containing block insulation. It was a simple, stationary product in its
ordinary uses. Because it was made of friable material that had to be
cut  and  shaped  to  perform  its  insulating  function  on  irregularly
shaped  objects,  it  generated  large  amounts  of  asbestos-laden  dust
during  normal  installation,  inspection,  removal,  and  replacement

processes. The design failure was in Kaylo’s emission of highly toxic,
respirable  ﬁbers  in  the  normal  course  of  its  intended  use  and
maintenance  as  a  high-temperature  thermal  insulation.  It  is  a
reasonable
inference  from  the  evidence  that  this  emission  of
respirable ﬁbers, which were capable of causing a fatal lung disease
after  a  long  latency  period,  was  a  product  failure  beyond  the
“legitimate, commonly accepted minimum safety assumptions of its
ordinary consumers.”

The  instant  case  is  analogous  to  West  v.  Johnson  &  Johnson
Products,  Inc.  (1985)  174  Cal.  App.  3d  831.  In  West,  the  plaintiff
became  seriously  ill  during  her  menstrual  period.  At  the  time,  there
were  growing  indications  that  tampon  use  sometimes  caused  toxic
shock  syndrome  (TSS).  After  reading  medical  reports,  plaintiff’s
physicians belatedly concluded that she had suffered TSS caused by
tampons  produced  by  the  defendant.  At  trial,  experts  debated  the
nature  of  plaintiff’s  illness,  and  disputed  whether  the  tampon  design
and materials used by the defendant encouraged TSS. The trial court
instructed the jury only on the “consumer expectation test” prong of
Barker, and the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff.

On  appeal,  the  defendant  contended  that  the  risk-beneﬁt  test
alone  was  proper.  The  Court  of  Appeal  .  .  .  reasoned  that,  in  a  time
before  there  was  general  awareness  and  warnings  about  TSS,  the
plaintiff  “had  every  right  to  expect”  that  use  of  such  a  seemingly
innocuous  product  “would  not  lead  to  a  serious  (or  perhaps  fatal)
illness.”

The  same  is  true  here.  Plaintiffs  presented  ample  evidence  that,
when  used  in  the  intended  manner,  Kaylo  violated  the  minimum
safety  expectations  of  its  ordinary  consumers.  For  example,  Ralph
David  testiﬁed  that  he  and  other  insulators  freely  manipulated
asbestos-containing  insulation  products  such  as  Kaylo  during  both
installation  and  removal  procedures,  all  the  while  assuming  that  it
was  innocuous,  just  part  of  their  job.  Samuel  Schillaci,  the  Owens-
Illinois  employee  who  was  responsible  for  the  Kaylo  division  in  the

throughout

1950’s,  testiﬁed  that  he  frequently  observed  workers  in  the  ﬁeld
sawing  Kaylo,  generating  dust,  but  not  wearing  respirators.  Plaintiff
himself testiﬁed that he and all the other workers around him on the
Bremerton  worked  with  asbestos-containing  insulation  and  cleaned
up after such projects in a manner that caused large amounts of dust
the  work  area,  without  any  special
to  circulate
precautions  against  the  generation,  distribution  or  inhalation  of  the
asbestos ﬁbers, and without any expectation that the respirable ﬁbers
could  cause  serious  illness.  The  jury  could  infer  from  this  and  other
testimony that the ordinary users of Kaylo in the late 1950’s and early
1960’s  did  not  expect  to  develop  a  fatal  disease  from  simply
breathing  Kaylo  dust  and,  thus,  that  the  product’s  performance  did
not  meet  the
its  ordinary
consumers.” We conclude that the trial court did not err by instructing
the jury only on the “consumer expectation test,” and that there was
substantial evidence to support the jury ﬁnding of a design defect in
Kaylo.

For  all  the  foregoing  reasons,  the  judgment  of  the  trial  court  is

afﬁrmed in its entirety.

2.  State-of-the-Art  Evidence.   The  trial  court  had  granted  the
plaintiff’s  pretrial  motion  in  limine  ruling  that  the  defendant’s
proffered “state-of-the-art defense” evidence was inappropriate under
the  consumer  expectation  test.  In  design  defect  cases  analyzed
under  the  alternative  risk  utility  test,  as  we  shall  see,  courts  focus
upon a cost-beneﬁt analysis of the details of the defendant’s chosen
design,  considering  the  state  of  the  art  of  knowledge  available.  In
such  cases,  defendants  sometimes  defend  these  claims  on  the
grounds that, at the time of the product’s design, the state of the art
did  not  include  knowledge  of  the  risks  of  using  the  product.  Some
states even have statutes that provide a “state-of-the-art defense” in
instances  when  the  defendant  can  show  that  it  used  a  design  that
was,  at  the  time,  as  technologically  advanced  as  was  reasonably
possible.  One  fundamental  difference  between  the  consumer
expectation  test  and  the  risk  utility  test  is  that  the  former  focuses
exclusively  upon  the  awareness  of  risks  by  the  consumers  of  the
product; knowledge on the part of the manufacturer is irrelevant.

that  ordinary  consumers  would  have  no  particular

expectation  test  is  more  appropriate  in  claims  involving  asbestos-
infused  insulation  and  tampons  but  not  appropriate  in  the  case
involving  the  design  of  a  car’s  floorboard?  Also,  note  that  under  the
consumer  expectation  test  the  controlling  standard  is  not  the
subjective  beliefs  of  the  injured  claimant  but  the  objective  viewpoint
of the ordinary users of the product.

2. The Risk Utility Test

Embodying more of the negligence heritage behind strict liability law,
the  majority  of  jurisdictions  have  adopted  the  risk  utility  test  for
analyzing alleged design defects. This test involves a balancing of the
beneﬁts of the product’s existing design with the risks of that design
in light of other possible alternatives. Courts look to multiple factors
in  applying  this  test  as  is  evidenced  by  the  Dawson  case  below.  As
you  consider  the  application  of  this  analysis,  see  if  you  can  still  ﬁnd
differences  between  this  test  for  a  strict  liability  design  defect  and
ordinary negligence concepts.

DAWSON v. CHRYSLER CORP.
630 F.2d 950 (3d Cir. 1980)

     , J.

This appeal from a jury verdict and entry of judgment in favor of
the plaintiffs arises out of a New Jersey automobile accident in which
a  police  ofﬁcer  was  seriously  injured.  The  legal  questions  in  this
diversity  action,  that  are  governed  by  New  Jersey  law,  are  relatively
straight-forward.  The  public  policy  questions,  however,  which  are
beyond  the  competence  of  this  Court  to  resolve  and  with  which
Congress  ultimately  must  grapple,  are  complex  and
implicate
national economic and social concerns.

In  adjudicating  this  appeal,  we  ﬁrst  decide  the  question  whether
the  district  court  erred  in  denying  the  defendant’s  motion  for
judgment  notwithstanding  the  verdict.  [We  will  also]  address  the
troubling  public  policy  dilemma  namely,  that  under  existing  federal
law  individual  juries  in  the  various  states  are  permitted,  in  effect,  to
establish national automobile safety standards. The result of such an
arrangement,  predictably,  is  not  only  incoherence  in  the  safety
requirements  set  by  disparate  juries,  but  also  the  possibility  that  a
standard  established  by  a  jury  in  a  particular  case  will  conflict  with
other policies regarding the economics of the automobile industry as
well as energy conservation programs.

On September 7, 1974, Richard F. Dawson, while in the employ of
the Pennsauken Police Department, was seriously injured as a result
of an automobile accident that occurred in Pennsauken, New Jersey.
As  Dawson  was  driving  on  a  rain-soaked  highway,  responding  to  a
burglar alarm, he lost control of his patrol car a 1974 Dodge Monaco.
The  car  slid  off  the  highway,  over  a  curb,  through  a  small  sign,  and
into an unyielding steel pole that was ﬁfteen inches in diameter. The
car  struck  the  pole  in  a  backwards  direction  at  a  forty-ﬁve  degree
angle on the left side of the vehicle; the point of impact was the left
rear  wheel  well.  As  a  result  of  the  force  of  the  collision,  the  vehicle
literally  wrapped  itself  around  the  pole.  The  pole  ripped  through  the
body  of  the  car  and  crushed  Dawson  between  the  seat  and  the
“header”  area  of  the  roof,  located  just  above  the  windshield.  The  so-
called  “secondary  collision”  of  Dawson  with  the  interior  of  the

automobile  dislocated  Dawson’s  left  hip  and  ruptured  his  ﬁfth  and
sixth  cervical  vertebrae.  As  a  result  of  the  injuries,  Dawson  is  now  a
quadriplegic.  He  has  no  control  over  his  body  from  the  neck  down,
and requires constant medical attention.

Dawson,  his  wife,  and  their  son  brought  suit  in  the  Court  of
Common Pleas of Philadelphia against the Chrysler Corporation, the
manufacturer  of  the  vehicle  in  which  Dawson  was  injured.  Chrysler
removed the case to the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Pennsylvania on the grounds of diversity, and subsequently
had the case transferred to the District Court for the District of New
Jersey.  The  plaintiffs’  [strict  products  liability  theory  was]  that  the
patrol  car  was  defective  because  it  did  not  have  a  full,  continuous
steel frame extending through the door panels, and a cross-member
running  through  the  floor  board  between  the  posts  located  between
the  front  and  rear  doors  of  the  vehicle.  Had  the  vehicle  been  so
designed, the Dawsons alleged, it would have “bounced” off the pole
following  relatively  slight  penetration  by  the  pole  into  the  passenger
space.

Expert  testimony  was  introduced  by  the  Dawsons  to  prove  that
the  existing  frame  of  the  patrol  car  was  unable  to  withstand  side
impacts at relatively low speed, and that the inadequacy of the frame
permitted the pole to enter the passenger area and to injure Dawson.
The same experts testiﬁed that the improvements in the design of the
frame  that  the  plaintiffs  proposed  were  feasible  and  would  have
prevented  Dawson  from  being  injured  as  he  was.  According  to
plaintiffs’  expert  witnesses,  a  continuous  frame  and  cross-member
would  have  deflected  the  patrol  car  away  from  the  pole  after  a
minimal intrusion into the passenger area and, they declared, Dawson
likely would have emerged from the accident with only a slight injury.

In  response,  Chrysler  argued  that  it  had  no  duty  to  produce  a
“crashproof”  vehicle,  and  that,  in  any  event,  the  patrol  car  was  not
defective.  Expert  testimony  for  Chrysler  established  that  the  design
and construction of the 1974 Dodge Monaco complied with all federal

vehicle  safety  standards,  and  that  deformation  of  the  body  of  the
vehicle is desirable in most crashes because it absorbs the impact of
the crash and decreases the rate of deceleration on the occupants of
the vehicle. Thus, Chrysler’s experts asserted that, for most types of
automobile  accidents,  the  design  offered  by  the  Dawsons  would  be
less safe than the existing design. They also estimated that the steel
parts that would be required in the model suggested by the Dawsons
would  have  added  between  200  and  250  pounds  to  the  weight,  and
approximately $300 to the price of the vehicle. It was also established
that  the  1974  Dodge  Monaco’s  unibody  construction  was  stronger
than comparable Ford and Chevrolet vehicles.

After  all  testimony  had  been  introduced,  Chrysler  moved  for  a
directed  verdict,  which  the  district  judge  denied.  The  jury  thereupon
returned  a  verdict  in  favor  of  the  plaintiffs.  The  jury  awarded  Mr.
Dawson  $2,064,863.19  for  his  expenses,  disability,  and  pain  and
loss  of
suffering,  and  granted  Mrs.  Dawson  $60,000.00  for
consortium  and  loss  of  services.  After  the  district  court  entered
judgment,  Chrysler  moved  for  judgment  notwithstanding  the  verdict
or, alternatively for a new trial. The court denied both motions.

At the outset, it is important, indeed crucial, to point out, that the
substantive issues of this diversity case are controlled by the law of
New  Jersey.  [W]e  proceed  with  the  adjudication  of  this  appeal
pursuant to the rubric of strict liability.

Chrysler  urges  that  .  .  .  it  had  no  obligation  to  manufacture  a
vehicle  that  would  protect  a  passenger  against  the  type  of  harm
suffered by Dawson. As we understand Chrysler’s argument, however,
it appears to be directed, not to Chrysler’s duty vis-a-vis Dawson, but
rather to the question whether the patrol car was defective inasmuch
as  it  did  not  adequately  prevent  Dawson  from  sustaining  serious
injury. For, as we stated in Huddell, it is “beyond peradventure that an
automobile  manufacturer  today  has  some  legal  obligation  to  design
and  produce  a  reasonably  crashworthy  vehicle.  Rephrased  in  the
liability,  the  manufacturer  must  consider
terminology  of  strict

accidents  as  among  the  “intended  uses  of  its  products,”  and
passengers  injured  in  such  accidents  as  among  the  group  of
reasonably foreseeable plaintiffs.

Thus, the controlling issue in the case is whether the jury could be
permitted to ﬁnd, under the law of New Jersey, that the patrol car was
defective.

The determination whether a product [contains a design defect] is
to be informed by what the New Jersey Supreme Court has termed a
“risk/utility  analysis.”  Cepeda  v.  Cumberland  Engineering  Co.,  Inc.,
386  A.2d  816,  825-29  (N.J.  1978).  Under  this  approach,  a  product  is
defective if “a reasonable person would conclude that the magnitude
of the scientiﬁcally perceivable danger as it is proved to be at the time
of  trial  outweighed  the  beneﬁts  of  the  way  the  product  was  so
designed  and  marketed.”  Id.  at  826.  The  court  in  Cepeda  identiﬁed
seven factors that might be relevant to this balancing process:

(1)  The  usefulness  and  desirability  of  the  product  its  utility  to  the  user  and  to
the public as a whole.

(2) The safety aspects of the product the likelihood that it will cause injury,

and the probable seriousness of the injury.

(3) The availability of a substitute product which would meet the same need

and not be as unsafe.

(4)  The  manufacturer’s  ability  to  eliminate  the  unsafe  character  of  the
product without impairing its usefulness or making it too expensive to maintain
its utility.

(5) The user’s ability to avoid danger by the exercise of care in the use of the

product.

(6) The user’s anticipated awareness of the dangers inherent in the product
and  their  avoidability,  because  of  general  public  knowledge  of  the  obvious
condition  of  the  product,  or  of  the  existence  of  suitable  warnings  or
instructions.

(7) The feasibility, on the part of the manufacturer, of spreading the loss by

setting the price of the product or carrying liability insurance.

The  court  suggested  that  the  trial  judge  ﬁrst  determine  whether  a
balancing  of  these  factors  precludes  liability  as  a  matter  of  law.  If  it

does  not,  then  the  judge  is  to  incorporate  into  the  instructions  any
factor for which there was presented speciﬁc proof and which might
be deemed relevant to the jury’s consideration of the matter.

Chrysler  maintains  that,  under  these  standards,  the  district  court
erred in submitting the case to the jury because the Dawsons failed,
as  a  matter  of  law,  to  prove  that  the  patrol  car  was  defective.
Speciﬁcally,  it  insists  that  the  Dawsons  did  not  present  sufﬁcient
evidence  from  which  the  jury  reasonably  might  infer  that  the
alternative design that they proffered would be safer than the existing
design, or that it would be cost effective, practical, or marketable. In
short, Chrysler urges that the substitute design would be less socially
beneﬁcial than was the actual design of the patrol car. In support of
its argument, Chrysler emphasizes that the design of the 1974 Dodge
Monaco complied with all of the standards authorized by Congress in
the National Trafﬁc and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, Pub. L. 89-
563, tit. I, §107, 80 Stat. 718, codiﬁed in 15 U.S.C. §1396 (1976), and
set forth in accompanying regulations, 49 C.F.R. §571.1 (1979).

Compliance  with  the  safety  standards  promulgated  pursuant  to
the National Trafﬁc and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, however, does not
relieve  Chrysler  of  liability  in  this  action.  For,  in  authorizing  the
Secretary  of  Transportation  to  enact  these  standards,  Congress
explicitly provided, “Compliance with any Federal motor vehicle safety
standard  issued  under  this  subchapter  does  not  exempt  any  person
from  any  liability  under  common  law.”  15  U.S.C.  §1397(c)  (1976).
Thus,  consonant  with  this  congressional  directive,  we  must  review
Chrysler’s  appeal  on  the  question  of  the  existence  of  a  defect  under
the common law of New Jersey that is set forth above.

Our examination of the record persuades us that the district court
did not err in denying Chrysler’s motion for judgment notwithstanding
the  verdict.  The  Dawsons  demonstrated  that  the  frame  of  the  1974
Dodge  Monaco  was  noncontinuous  that  is,  it  consisted  of  a  front
portion  that  extended  from  the  front  of  the  car  to  the  middle  of  the
front  passenger  seat,  and  a  rear  portion  that  ran  from  the  middle  of

the  rear  passenger  seat  to  the  back  end  of  the  vehicle.  Thus,  there
was a gap in the seventeen-inch side area of the frame between the
front  and  rear  seats.  The  plaintiffs  also  proved  that,  after  colliding
with the pole, the car slid along the left side portion of the rear frame
until  it  reached  the  gap  in  the  frame.  At  that  point,  the  pole  tore
through  the  body  of  the  vehicle  into  the  passenger  area  and
proceeded  to  push  Dawson
into  the  header  area  above  the
windshield.

Three  experts,  a  design  analyst,  a  mechanical  engineer,  and  a
biochemical engineer also testiﬁed on behalf of the Dawsons. These
witnesses  had  examined  the  patrol  car  and  concluded  that  it  was
inadequate  to  withstand  side  impacts.  They  testiﬁed  that  there  was
an  alternative  design  available  which,  had  it  been  employed  in  the
1974 Monaco, would have prevented Dawson from sustaining serious
injuries. The substitute design called for a continuous frame with an
additional  cross  member  running  between  the  so-called  B-posts  the
vertical posts located at the side of the car between the front and rear
seats.  According  to  these  witnesses,  this  design  was  known  in  the
industry well before the accident and had been tested by a number of
independent testing centers in 1969 and in 1973.

The mechanical engineer conducted a number of studies in order
to  ascertain  the  extent  to  which  the  alternative  design  would  have
withstood  the  crash.  On  the  basis  of  these  calculations,  he  testiﬁed
that  the  pole  would  have  penetrated  only  9.9  inches  into  the
passenger space, and thus would not have crushed Dawson. Instead,
the  engineer  stated,  the  car  would  have  deflected  off  the  pole  and
back  into  the  highway.  Under  these  circumstances,  according  to  the
biochemical  engineer,  Dawson  would  have  been  able  to  “walk  away
from the accident” with but a bruised shoulder.

Also introduced by the Dawsons were reports of tests conducted
for  the  United  States  Department  of  Transportation,  which  indicated
that, in side collisions with a ﬁxed pole at twenty-one miles per hour,
frame  improvements  similar  to  those  proposed  by  the  experts

increase

presented by the Dawsons reduced intrusion into the passenger area
by  ﬁfty  percent,  from  sixteen  inches  to  eight  inches.  The  study
concluded  that  the  improvements,  “in  conjunction  with  interior
alterations,  demonstrated  a  dramatic
in  occupant
protection.”  There  was  no  suggestion  at  trial  that  the  alternative
design recommended by the Dawsons would not comply with federal
safety  standards.  On  cross-examination,  Chrysler’s  attorney  did  get
the  Dawsons’  expert  witnesses  to  acknowledge  that  the  alternative
design  would  add  between  200  and  250  pounds  to  the  vehicle  and
would  cost  an  additional  $300  per  car.  The  Dawsons’  experts  also
conceded that the heavier and more rigid an automobile, the less able
it is to absorb energy upon impact with a ﬁxed object, and therefore
the  major  force  of  an  accident  might  be  transmitted  to  the
passengers. Moreover, an expert for Chrysler testiﬁed that, even if the
frame  of  the  patrol  car  had  been  designed  in  conformity  with  the
plaintiffs’ proposals, Dawson would have sustained injuries equivalent
to  those  he  actually  incurred.  Chrysler’s  witness  reasoned  that
Dawson  was  injured,  not  by  the  intrusion  of  the  pole  into  the
passenger space, but as a result of being thrown into the header area
of the roof by the vehicle’s initial contact with the pole that is, prior to
the impact of the pole against the driver’s seat.

On the basis of the foregoing recitation of the evidence presented
respectively  by  the  Dawsons  and  by  Chrysler,  we  conclude  that  the
record  is  sufﬁcient  to  sustain  the  jury’s  determination  .  .  .  that  the
design of the 1974 Monaco was defective. The jury was not required
to  ascertain  that  all  of  the  factors  enumerated  by  the  New  Jersey
Supreme Court in Cepeda weighed in favor of the Dawsons in order to
ﬁnd  the  patrol  car  defective.  Rather,  it  need  only  to  have  reasonably
concluded,  after  balancing  these  factors,  that,  at  the  time  Chrysler
distributed the 1974 Monaco, the car was “not reasonably ﬁt, suitable
and safe for its intended or reasonably foreseeable purposes.” Suter,
406 A.2d at 149.

Although  we  afﬁrm  the  judgment  of  the  district  court,  we  do  so
with  uneasiness  regarding  the  consequences  of  our  decision  and  of
the decisions of other courts throughout the country in cases of this
kind.

As we observed earlier, Congress, in enacting the National Trafﬁc
and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, provided that compliance with the Act
does not exempt any person from liability under the common law of
the  state  of  injury.  The  effect  of  this  provision  is  that  the  states  are
free,  not  only  to  create  various  standards  of  liability  for  automobile
manufacturers  with  respect  to  design  and  structure,  but  also  to
delegate  to  the  triers  of  fact  in  civil  cases  arising  out  of  automobile
accidents  the  power  to  determine  whether  a  particular  product
conforms to such standards. In the present situation, for example, the
New Jersey Supreme Court has instituted a strict liability standard for
cases  involving  defective  products,  has  deﬁned  the  term  “defective
product”  to  mean  any  such  item  that  is  not  “reasonably  ﬁt,  suitable
and  safe  for  its  intended  or  reasonably  foreseeable  purposes,”  and
has  left  to  the  jury  the  task  of  determining  whether  the  product  at
issue measures up to this standard.

The  result  of  such  arrangement  is  that  while  the  jury  found
Chrysler  liable  for  not  producing  a  rigid  enough  vehicular  frame,  a
factﬁnder in another case might well hold the manufacturer liable for
producing  a  frame  that  is  too  rigid.  Yet,  as  pointed  out  at  trial,  in
certain types of accidents head-on collisions it is desirable to have a
car  designed  to  collapse  upon  impact  because  the  deformation
would absorb much of the shock of the collision, and divert the force
of  deceleration  away  from  the  vehicle’s  passengers.  In  effect,  this
permits
in  different
juries  applying  varying
jurisdictions  to  set  nationwide  automobile  safety  standards  and  to
impose  on  automobile  manufacturers  conflicting  requirements.  It
would  be  difﬁcult  for  members  of  the  industry  to  alter  their  design
and  production  behavior  in  response  to  jury  verdicts  in  such  cases,
because  their  response  might  well  be  at  variance  with  what  some

individual

laws

other jury decides is a defective design. Under these circumstances,
the  law  imposes  on  the  industry  the  responsibility  of  insuring  vast
numbers of persons involved in automobile accidents.

Equally  serious  is  the  impact  on  other  national  social  and
economic  goals  of  the  existing  case-by-case  system  of  establishing
requirements.  As  we  have  become  more
automobile  safety
dependent  on  foreign  sources  of  energy,  and  as  the  price  of  that
energy  has  increased,  the  attention  of  the  federal  government  has
been drawn to a search to ﬁnd alternative supplies and the means of
conserving  energy.  More  recently,  the  domestic  automobile  industry
has  been  struggling  to  compete  with  foreign  manufacturers  which
have stressed smaller, more fuel-efﬁcient cars. Yet, during this same
period,  Congress  has  permitted  a  system  of  regulation  by  ad  hoc
adjudications  under  which  a
jury  can  hold  an  automobile
manufacturer  culpable  for  not  producing  a  car  that  is  considerably
heavier, and likely to have less fuel efﬁciency.

In  sum,  this  appeal  has  brought  to  our  attention  an  important
conflict  that  implicates  broad  national  concerns.  Although  it  is
important  that  society  devise  a  proper  system  for  compensating
those  injured  in  automobile  collisions,  it  is  not  at  all  clear  that  the
present  arrangement  of  permitting  individual  juries,  under  varying
standards  of  liability,  to  impose  this  obligation  on  manufacturers  is
fair or efﬁcient. Inasmuch as it was the Congress that designed this
system,  and  because  Congress  is  the  body  best  suited  to  evaluate
and,  if  appropriate,  to  change  that  system,  we  decline  today  to  do
anything in this regard except to bring the problem to the attention of
the legislative branch.

Bound  as  we  are  to  adjudicate  this  appeal  according  to  the
substantive law of New Jersey, and because we ﬁnd no basis in that
law  to  overturn  the  jury’s  verdict,  the  judgment  of  the  district  court
will be afﬁrmed.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Similarities  to  Negligence.   The  comparison  of  the  product’s
utility  with  the  risks  associated  with  the  product’s  intended  or
foreseeable  uses,  appears  strangely  familiar  to  the  Learned  Hand
analysis for breach of duty in a negligence case (see Chapter 4). You
might  say  that  a  reasonable  automobile  designer  would  necessarily
take into account the same factors that courts utilize in applying the
risk utility analysis. This has led to the observation by some that strict
liability  design  defect  claims  are  functionally  the  equivalent  of  a
negligence claim.

2.  Differences  from  Negligence.   Despite  similarities  between
negligence  analysis  and  the  risk  utility  test,  many  theoretical  and
some  practical  differences  demonstrate  that  they  are  not  identical.
For example, the “state of the art” of an industry’s knowledge can be
utilized  in  determining  the  risk  portion  of  the  risk  utility  test,  even  if
there is no proof that a reasonable manufacturer did or should have
known  of  the  risk.  Furthermore,  some  courts  explicitly  (and  others
implicitly) permit hindsight to be considered in applying the risk utility
test;  whereas  this  application  of  hindsight  would  be  abhorrent  to  a
court evaluating a negligence claim. In addition, the jury considers the
qualitative aspects of the product in a strict liability claim rather than
the conduct of the defendant seller — evidence of what the defendant
knew  is  theoretically  not  germane  in  a  strict  liability  case.  Finally,
when the risk utility test is applied in the case of a non-manufacturing
commercial  seller  of  a  product  (for  which  liability  is  just  as  broad
under Restatement (Second) of Torts §402A), the fact that the seller
was not involved with the design of the product is no defense.

3. Crashworthiness as a Design Defect.  Many auto manufacturers
have  argued  that  a  car  need  not  be  designed  to  perform  in  any
particular  way  during  a  crash  because  the  car’s  intended  purpose  is
not  to  be  involved  in  an  accident.  They  argue  that  being  in  a  crash
constitutes  a  type  of  product  “misuse”  that  need  not  be  taken  into

account  in  designing  the  product.  Most  (though  not  all)  courts  have
rejected  this  argument  because  of  the  inevitability  of  car  accidents.
These  courts  have  held  that  such  use  is  a  foreseeable,  even  if  not
desired,  use  of  the  product  and  that  this  foreseeability  compels
consideration  of  the  risks  involved  in  designing  the  car.  See,  e.g.,
Larsen v. General Motors Corp., 391 F.2d 495, 502 (8th Cir. 1968). In
applying  this  crashworthy  doctrine,  most  courts  put  the  burden  on
the  defendant,  once  a  defect  is  proven,  to  differentiate  between  the
underlying damages from the accident itself and the enhancement of
the injuries from the car not being safe in the event of a crash. If the
defendant cannot provide a basis for the jury separating out the initial
harm  from  the  secondary  injury,  the  defendant  is  liable  for  all  of  the
harm incurred in the accident.

4. Federal Issue: Preemption of State Law Claims.  The court above
refused the defense offered by the defendant that its compliance with
federal  regulations  in  designing  the  product  offered  a  safe  harbor  of
immunity.  There  are
instances  where  courts  have  found  that
congressional  legislation  evidences  either  an  express  or  implied
preemption of any state law to the contrary. If the court believes that
Congress did not intend to tolerate any standard for the defendant’s
conduct  different  than  a  federal  standard,  preemption  would
sometimes  preclude  a  state  law  tort  claim  where  the  defendant’s
design (or warning) for a product ﬁnds federal approval. Because the
federal  statute  in  the  above  case  expressly  stated  otherwise,  there
was  no  federal  preemption  of  the  claims.  In  an  important  and
relatively  recent  opinion,  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court  held  in  Wyeth  v.
Levine,  555  U.S.  555  (2009),  that  the  FDA’s  approval  of  certain  drug
labels  did  not  preempt  any  state  law  strict  liability  claim  asserting  a
marketing (warning) defect. In its opinion written by Justice Stevens,
the court said that there is a strong presumption against preemption,
which could only be rebutted by a “clear and manifest purpose” in the
legislation to supersede the historic police powers of the state.

5.  State  Law  Issue:  Weight  to  Be  Given  Compliance.   Even  where
there  is  no  federal  preemption  (a  question  of  federal  law),  it  is  up  to
each state to determine what weight, if any, to give to the fact that the
federal government has approved a design or warning for a particular
product. While some courts expressly hold that such a circumstance
is  irrelevant  to  the  state  law  inquiry  into  a  possible  product  defect
(see  Edwards  v.  Basel  Pharmaceuticals,  933  P.2d  298  (Okla.  1997)),
other  states  have  ruled  otherwise,  often  by  virtue  of  tort  reform
statutes  giving  great  weight  to  evidence  of  federal  approval  of  the
product.  For  example,  Texas  has  enacted  a  statute  creating  a
rebuttable  presumption  that  there  is  no  defective  design  or  warning
when  the  manufacturer  has  “complied  with  mandatory  safety
standards  or  regulations  adopted  and  promulgated  by  the  federal
government.”  Tex.  Civ.  Prac.  &  Rem.  Code  §82.008(a).  Such  a
presumption is only rebuttable upon proof that the federal regulations
were inadequate to protect the public or that the manufacturer lied to
the government to obtain approval for the design or warning.

3. The Alternative Feasible Design Requirement

As  the  court  in  the  Dawson  case  mentioned,  under  the  risk  utility
analysis, a jury need not ﬁnd that each factor favors the existence of
a defect. Instead, a balancing of the totality of these considerations is
supposed  to  drive  the  jury’s  verdict.  Notwithstanding  the  general
agreement with most courts of this concept, some jurisdictions have
held  that  under  the  risk  utility  analysis  a  mandatory  prerequisite  for
ﬁnding a design defect is the plaintiff’s proof of an alternative feasible
product design. The Grinnell case, which we have previously reviewed
in  part  with  respect  to  manufacturing  defects,  addresses  this
evidentiary  requirement

AMERICAN TOBACCO CO. v. GRINNELL
951 S.W.2d 420 (Tex. 1997)

PART 2 — DESIGN DEFECT

[As set forth previously in this chapter as Part I, the decedent began
smoking the defendant’s cigarettes in 1952 and contracted cancer 33
years  later.  In  the  wrongful  death  and  survival  action  against  the
manufacturer, plaintiff asserted defective manufacturing, design, and
marketing theories of liability, among others. Part II of the opinion, set
forth below, contains the Court’s analysis of the summary judgment
granted against the plaintiff on her defective design claim.]

The  duty  to  design  a  safe  product  is  “an  obligation  imposed  by
law.”  McKisson  v.  Sales  Affiliates,  Inc.,  416  S.W.2d  787,  789  (Tex.
1967).  Whether  a  seller  has  breached  this  duty,  that  is,  whether  a
product is unreasonably dangerous, is a question of fact for the jury.
See Turner v. General Motors Corp., 584 S.W.2d 844, 848 (Tex. 1979).
In  determining  whether  a  product  is  defectively  designed,  the  jury
must  conclude  that  the  product  is  unreasonably  dangerous  as
designed,  taking  into  consideration  the  utility  of  the  product  and  the
risk involved in its use.

In Turner we held that evidence of the following factors of risk and
utility  were  admissible  in  design  defect  cases:  (1)  the  utility  of  the
product to the user and to the public as a whole weighed against the
gravity  and  likelihood  of  injury  from  its  use;  (2)  the  availability  of  a
substitute  product  which  would  meet  the  same  need  and  not  be
unsafe  or  unreasonably  expensive;  (3)  the  manufacturer’s  ability  to
eliminate  the  unsafe  character  of  the  product  without  seriously
impairing  its  usefulness  or  signiﬁcantly  increasing  its  costs;  (4)  the
user’s  anticipated  awareness  of  the  dangers  inherent  in  the  product
and  their  avoidability  because  of  general  public  knowledge  of  the
obvious  condition  of  the  product,  or  of  the  existence  of  suitable

warnings  or  instructions;  and  (5)  the  expectations  of  the  ordinary
consumer.  Id.  at  846,  847.  See  also  Caterpillar,  Inc.,  911  S.W.2d  at
384;  Boatland  of  Houston,  Inc.  v.  Bailey,  609  S.W.2d  743,  746  n.2
(Tex. 1980).

American  argues  that  the  common-knowledge  defense  bars  the
Grinnells’ design defect claims as a matter of law. But, as we stated in
Turner,  “the  user’s  anticipated  awareness  of  the  dangers  inherent  in
the  product  and  their  avoidability  because  of  general  public
knowledge  of  the  obvious  condition  of  the  product,”  and  “the
expectations  of  the  ordinary  consumer,”  are  but  two  factors  for  the
jury to consider when determining whether a product was defectively
designed.  American’s  attempt  to  invoke  the  common-knowledge
defense  is  actually  an  attempt  to  invoke  the  “open  and  obvious
defense”  or  “patent  danger  rule,”  which  this  Court  has  rejected  in
design defect cases:

A  number  of  courts  are  of  the  view  that  obvious  risks  are  not  design  defects
which  must  be  remedied.  See,  e.g.,  Gray,  771  F.2d  866,  870  (applying
Mississippi law); Delvaux  v.  Ford  Motor  Co.,  764  F.2d  469,  474  (7th  Cir.  1985)
(applying  Wisconsin  law);  Young  v.  Tide  Craft,  Inc.,  270  S.C.  453,  242  S.E.2d
671,  680  (1978).  However,  our  Court  has  held  that  liability  for  a  design  defect
may  attach  even  if  the  defect  is  apparent.  Turner,  584  S.W.2d  at  850.
Determining if a design is unreasonably dangerous requires balancing the utility
of the product against the risks involved in its use. Id. at 847 & n.1.

Caterpillar,  Inc.,  911  S.W.2d  at  383-84.  Accordingly,  American’s
attempt  to  invoke  the  common-knowledge  defense  in  the  context  of
an alleged design defect is without merit.

Alternatively,  American  argues  that  it  is  entitled  to  summary
judgment  because  no  safer  alternative  cigarette  design  exists.  In
Turner,  we  held  that  “the  availability  of  a  substitute  product  which
would  meet  the  same  need  and  not  be  unsafe  or  unreasonably
expensive,”  was  one  factor  for  juries  to  consider  when  determining
whether  a  product  was  defectively  designed.  We  reafﬁrmed  this
holding  in  Caterpillar,  Inc.  v.  Shears  by  stating  that  “if  there  are  no

safer  alternatives,  a  product  is  not  unreasonably  dangerous  as  a
matter  of  law.1”  911  S.W.2d  at  384.  Accordingly,  if  there  is  no  safer
alternative  to  the  cigarette  manufactured  by  American,  then  its
cigarettes are not unreasonably dangerous as a matter of law.

The  Grinnells  assert  that  American’s  cigarettes  could  have  been
made  reasonably  safer  by  ﬁltration,  and  by  reducing  the  amount  of
tobacco, tar, nicotine, and toxins in them. In making its argument that
no reasonably safer alternative design exists, American relies on the
testimony  of  the  Grinnells’  experts,  Drs.  Greenberg,  Stevens,  and
Ginzel.  These  experts  testiﬁed  that  Grinnell  would  have  developed
cancer  and  died  regardless  of  whether  ﬁlters,  lower  tar,  or  less
tobacco had been used. Speciﬁcally, Dr. Greenberg testiﬁed:

Q:  It didn’t matter to you and your opinion would not have changed
as  to  the  cause  of  the  lung  cancer,  regardless  of  the  brand,
whether  it  was  ﬁltered  or  nonﬁltered,  short  or  long  cigarette.  Is
that right?
A:  That’s correct.

Dr. Ginzel testiﬁed similarly:

Q:  Doctor, is there any safe cigarette with respect to lung cancer?
A:  Not that I know of.
Q:   Is  there  any  design  for  a  cigarette  that  Mr.  Grinnell  could  have

smoked that would have avoided his claimed lung cancer?

A:  Not during his lifetime, no.

dangerous

Ultimately,  the  Grinnells  essentially  concede  that  no  reasonably
safer alternatives exist, but argue that all cigarettes are defective and
nonetheless.2  Because  American
unreasonably
conclusively proved that no reasonably safer alternative design exists
for its cigarettes, we hold that summary judgment was proper on all
of  the  Grinnells’  design  defect  claims,  including  those  based  on  the
addictive quality of cigarettes.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Differing  List  of  Factors.   Note  that  in  the  Grinnell  case,  the
court  identiﬁes  itself  as  a  risk  utility  jurisdiction  for  purposes  of
analyzing  a  design  defect  case.  Not  all  such  jurisdictions  recite  an
identical  list  of  considerations,  though  they  all  tend  to  overlap
signiﬁcantly.  The
identiﬁed  by  Grinnell  actually
incorporates  the  consumer  expectation  test  into  the  risk  utility
analysis  as  one  of  the  considerations.  It  thus  represents  a  hybrid
approach.

factor

last

2.  Mandatory  Proof  of  Alternative  Feasible  Design.   The  court
indicates that both the court and the legislature had demanded that
in  design  defect  cases,  the  plaintiff  offer  evidence  of  an  alternative
feasible design that would provide essentially the same functions of
the  product,  but  in  a  safer  and  economically  and  technologically
feasible  manner.  Courts  that  require  this  as  an  element  of  a  design
defect  claim  have  held  that  the  plaintiff  need  not  actually  build  a
prototype  of  the  proposed  alternative  design  but  simply  offer  expert
testimony  showing  the  feasibility  of  such  a  design.  See  General
Motors  v.  Sanchez,  997  S.W.2d  584,  592  (Tex.  1999)  (“[P]laintiffs  did
not  have  to  build  an  automobile  transmission  to  prove  a  safer
alternative  design.  A  design  need  only  prove  ‘capable  of  being
developed.’”). Not all courts agree that this one factor in the risk utility
analysis  requires  proof  of  an  alternative  feasible  design  as  a
prerequisite  for  ﬁnding  a  defect.  See,  e.g.,  Potter  v.  Chicago
Pneumatic Tool Co., 694 A.2d 1319 (Conn. 1997).

4. Comparing the Consumer Expectation and Risk

Utility Tests

In  some  cases,  the  choice  between  the  consumer  expectation  test
and the risk utility test might make no difference — when products are

either  so  obviously  flawed  or  well-designed  that  either  test  should
yield the same verdict. But in other cases, the choice between the two
tests  might  change  the  verdict.  The  following  case  offers  a  unique
opportunity to gain one court’s insight into the difference between the
two  tests  in  the  context  of  an  actual  case.  In  Denny,  the  plaintiff
asserted both a strict liability design defect claim as well as a breach
of warranty claim. The court found the two claims different enough to
permit submission of both theories to the jury. New York utilizes the
risk  utility  test  for  strict  liability  design  defect  claims  but,  in  effect,
uses a consumer expectation test for breach of warranty claims. Pay
close  attention  to  why  the  appellate  court  ﬁnds  that  the  jury  may
have properly found for the defendant manufacturer on the risk utility
test but in favor of the plaintiff using the consumer expectation test.

DENNY v. FORD MOTOR CO.
662 N.E.2d 730 (N.Y. 1995)

      , J.

Are  the  elements  of  New  York’s  causes  of  action  for  strict
products liability and breach of implied warranty always coextensive?
If not, can the latter be broader than the former? These are the core
issues  presented  by  the  questions  that  the  United  States  Court  of
Appeals  for  the  Second  Circuit  has  certiﬁed  to  us  in  this  diversity
action involving an allegedly defective vehicle. On the facts set forth
by  the  Second  Circuit,  we  hold  that  the  causes  of  action  are  not
identical  and  that,  under  the  circumstances  presented  here,  it  is
possible  to  be  liable  for  breach  of  implied  warranty  even  though  a
liability  has  not  been  satisfactorily
claim  of  strict  products
established.

As stated by the Second Circuit, this action arises out of a June 9,
1986  accident  in  which  plaintiff  Nancy  Denny  was  severely  injured
when the Ford Bronco II that she was driving rolled over. The rollover

accident occurred when Denny slammed on her brakes in an effort to
avoid  a  deer  that  had  walked  directly  into  her  motor  vehicle’s  path.
Denny  and  her  spouse  sued  Ford  Motor  Co.,  the  vehicle’s
manufacturer, asserting claims for negligence, strict products liability
and breach of implied warranty of merchantability. The case went to
trial  in  the  District  Court  for  the  Northern  District  of  New  York  in
October of 1992.

In Practice

Rule 18 of the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure permits a
plaintiff to join as many claims
as desired against a particular
defendant. When a product
hurts the plaintiff, the plaintiff
might join to her strict products
liability action a count of
negligence as well as a count
for breach of warranty,
depending upon whether the
state utilizes different tests for
these claims.

The  trial  evidence  centered
particular
on
the
characteristics
utility
vehicles,  which  are  generally
for  off-road  use  on
made
rugged
unpaved  and  often
terrain.  Such  use  sometimes
necessitates  climbing  over
obstacles  such  as  fallen  logs
and rocks. While utility vehicles
are  traditionally  considerably
larger  than  passenger  cars,
some  manufacturers  have
created  a  category  of  down-
sized  “small”  utility  vehicles,
which  are  designed
to  be
lighter,  to  achieve  better  fuel
economy  and,  presumably,  to
appeal  to  a  wider  consumer  market.  The  Bronco  II  in  which  Denny
was injured falls into this category.

Plaintiffs  introduced  evidence  at  trial  to  show  that  small  utility
vehicles  in  general,  and  the  Bronco  II  in  particular,  present  a
signiﬁcantly  higher  risk  of  rollover  accidents  than  do  ordinary
passenger  automobiles.  Plaintiffs’  evidence  also  showed  that  the
Bronco  II  had  a  low  stability  index  attributable  to  its  high  center  of
gravity  and  relatively  narrow  track  width.  The  vehicle’s  shorter

factors
wheelbase  and  suspension  system  were  additional
contributing to its instability. Ford had made minor design changes in
an  effort  to  achieve  a  higher  stability  index,  but,  according  to
plaintiffs’  proof,  none  of  the  changes  produced  a  signiﬁcant
improvement in the vehicle’s stability.

Ford  argued  at  trial  that  the  design  features  of  which  plaintiffs
complained  were  necessary  to  the  vehicle’s  off-road  capabilities.
According to Ford, the vehicle had been intended to be used as an off-
road vehicle and had not been designed to be sold as a conventional
passenger automobile. Ford’s own engineer stated that he would not
recommend the Bronco II to someone whose primary interest was to
use  it  as  a  passenger  car,  since  the  features  of  a  four-wheel-drive
utility  vehicle  were  not  helpful  for  that  purpose  and  the  vehicle’s
design made it inherently less stable.

Despite  the  engineer’s  testimony,  plaintiffs  introduced  a  Ford
marketing  manual  which  predicted  that  many  buyers  would  be
attracted  to  the  Bronco  II  because  utility  vehicles  were  “suitable  to
contemporary life styles” and were “considered fashionable” in some
suburban  areas.  According  to  this  manual,  the  sales  presentation  of
the  Bronco  II  should  take  into  account  the  vehicle’s  “suitab[ility]  for
commuting  and  for  suburban  and  city  driving.”  Additionally,  the
vehicle’s  ability  to  switch  between  two-wheel  and  four-wheel  drive
would  “be  particularly  appealing  to  women  who  may  be  concerned
about  driving  in  snow  and  ice  with  their  children.”  Plaintiffs  both
testiﬁed  that  the  perceived  safety  beneﬁts  of  its  four-wheel-drive
capacity were what attracted them to the Bronco II. They were not at
all interested in its off-road use.

At  the  close  of  the  evidence,  the  District  Court  Judge  submitted
both  the  strict  products  liability  claim  and  the  breach  of  implied
warranty claim, despite Ford’s objection that the two causes of action
were identical. [The jury rejected the negligence claim and no appeal
was  taken  as  to  it.]  With  respect  to  the  strict  products  liability  claim
the court told the jury that “[a] manufacturer who places a product on

the  market  in  a  defective  condition  is  liable  for  injury  which  results
from use of the product when the product is used for its intended or
reasonably foreseeable purpose.” Further, the court stated:

A  product  is  defective  if  it  is  not  reasonably  safe.  It  is  not  necessary  for  the
plaintiffs  to  prove  that  the  defendant  knew  or  should  have  known  of  the
product[’]s  potential  for  causing  injury  to  establish  that  the  product  was  not
reasonably  safe.  Rather,  the  plaintiffs  must  prove  by  a  preponderance  of  the
evidence that a reasonable person . . . who knew of the product’s potential for
causing injury and the existence of available alternative designs . . . would have
concluded  that  such  a  product  should  not  have  been  marketed  in  that
condition.  Such  a  conclusion  should  be  reached  after  balancing  the  risks
involved  in  using  the  product  against  the  product[’]s  usefulness  and  its  costs
against the risks, usefulness and costs of the alternative design as compared to
the product defendant did market.

With  respect  to  the  breach  of  implied  warranty  claim,  the  court  told
the jury:

The law implies a warranty by a manufacturer which places its product on the
market  that  the  product  is  reasonably  ﬁt  for  the  ordinary  purpose  for  which  it
was intended. If it is, in fact, defective and not reasonably ﬁt to be used for its
intended purpose, the warranty is breached.

The  plaintiffs  claim  that  the  Bronco  II  was  not  ﬁt  for  its  ordinary  purpose
because  of  its  alleged  propensity  to  rollover  and  lack  of  warnings  to  the
consumer of this propensity.

Neither party objected to the content of these charges.

In  response  to  interrogatories,  the  jury  found  that  the  Bronco  II
was not “defective” and that defendant was therefore not liable under
plaintiffs’  strict  products  liability  cause  of  action.  However,  the  jury
also  found  that  defendant  had  breached  its  implied  warranty  of
merchantability  and  that  the  breach  was  the  proximate  cause  of
Nancy  Denny’s
injuries.  Following  apportionment  of  damages,
plaintiff was awarded judgment in the amount of $1.2 million.

In  this  proceeding,  Ford’s  sole  argument  is  that  plaintiffs’  strict
products  liability  and  breach  of  implied  warranty  causes  of  action

were  identical  and  that,  accordingly,  a  defendant’s  verdict  on  the
former cannot be reconciled with a plaintiff’s verdict on the latter. This
argument is, in turn, premised on both the intertwined history of the
two  doctrines  and  the  close  similarity  in  their  elements  and  legal
functions.  Although  Ford  recognizes  that  New  York  has  previously
permitted personal injury plaintiffs to simultaneously assert different
products  liability  theories  in  support  of  their  claims,  it  contends  that
the  breach  of  implied  warranty  cause  of  action,  which  sounds  in
contract,  has  been  subsumed  by  the  more  recently  adopted,  and
more  highly  evolved,  strict  products  liability  theory,  which  sounds  in
tort. Ford’s argument has much to commend it. However, in the ﬁnal
analysis,  the  argument  is  flawed  because  it  overlooks  the  continued
existence of a separate statutory predicate for the breach of warranty
theory  and  the  subtle  but  important  distinction  between  the  two
theories that arises from their different historical and doctrinal root.

When  products  liability  litigation  was  in  its  infancy,  the  courts
relied upon contractual warranty theories as the only existing means
of facilitating economic recovery for personal injuries arising from the
use  of  defective  [products].  Eventually,  the  contractually  based
implied  warranty  theory  came  to  be  perceived  as  inadequate  in  an
economic universe that was dominated by mass-produced products
and an impersonal marketplace. Its primary weakness was, of course,
its rigid requirement of a relationship of privity between the seller and
the  injured  consumer — a  requirement  that  often  could  not  be
satisﬁed.  However,  the  warranty  approach  remained  unsatisfactory,
and the courts shifted their focus to the development of a new, more
flexible tort cause of action: the doctrine of strict products liability.

The  establishment  of  this  tort  remedy  has,  as  this  Court  has
recognized,  signiﬁcantly  diminished  the  need  to  rely  on  the
contractually  based  breach  of  implied  warranty  remedy  as  a  means
of  compensating  individuals  injured  because  of  defective  products.
Further,  although  the  available  defenses  and  applicable  limitations
principles  may  differ,  there  is  a  high  degree  of  overlap  between  the

substantive aspects of the two causes of action. Indeed, on an earlier
occasion, this Court observed, in dictum, that “strict liability in tort and
implied warranty in the absence of privity are merely different ways of
describing the very same cause of action.”

Nonetheless, it would not be correct to infer that the tort cause of
implied
action  has  completely  subsumed  the  older  breach  of
warranty cause of action or that the two doctrines are now identical
in every respect.

Although  the  products  liability  theory  sounding  in  tort  and  the
breach of implied warranty theory authorized by the UCC coexist and
are  often  invoked  in  tandem,  the  core  element  of  “defect”  is  subtly
different  in  the  two  causes  of  action.  Under  New  York  law,  a  design
defect may be actionable under a strict products liability theory if the
product
[T]he  New  York  standard  for
determining  the  existence  of  a  design  defect  has  required  an
assessment of whether “if the design defect were known at the time
of  manufacture,  a  reasonable  person  would  conclude  that  the  utility
of  the  product  did  not  outweigh  the  risk  inherent  in  marketing  a
product designed in that manner.”

is  not  reasonably  safe.

The  adoption  of  this  risk/utility  balance  as  a  component  of  the
“defectiveness”  element  has  brought  the  inquiry  in  design  defect
cases  closer  to  that  used  in  traditional  negligence  cases,  where  the
reasonableness  of  an  actor’s  conduct  is  considered  in  light  of  a
number  of  situational  and  policy-driven  factors.  While  efforts  have
been  made  to  steer  away  from  the  fault-oriented  negligence
principles  by  characterizing  the  design  defect  cause  of  action  in
terms  of  a  product-based  rather  than  a  conduct-based  analysis,  the
reality  is  that  the  risk/utility  balancing  test  is  a  “negligence-inspired”
approach,  since  it  invites  the  parties  to  adduce  proof  about  the
manufacturer’s  choices  and  ultimately  requires  the  fact  ﬁnder  to
make  “a  judgment  about  [the  manufacturer’s]  judgment.”  In  other
words,  an  assessment  of  the  manufacturer’s  conduct  is  virtually
inevitable,  and,  as  one  commentator  observed,  “[i]n  general,  .  .  .  the

‘defective  design’

[is]

It  is  this  negligence-like  risk/beneﬁt  component  of  the  defect
element  that  differentiates  strict  products  liability  claims  from  UCC-
based  breach  of  implied  warranty  claims  in  cases  involving  design
defects.  While  the  strict  products  concept  of  a  product  that  is  “not
reasonably safe” requires a weighing of the product’s dangers against
its  over-all  advantages,  the  UCC’s  concept  of  a  “defective”  product
requires an inquiry only into whether the product in question was “ﬁt
for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used.” The latter
inquiry  focuses  on  the  expectations  for  the  performance  of  the
in  the  customary,  usual  and  reasonably
product  when  used
foreseeable manners. The cause of action is one involving true “strict”
liability, since recovery may be had upon a showing that the product
was not minimally safe for its expected purpose — without regard to
the
the  manufacturer’s
“reasonableness” in marketing it in that unsafe condition.

This distinction between the “defect” analysis in breach of implied
warranty  actions  and  the  “defect”  analysis  in  strict  products  liability
the  differing  etiology  and  doctrinal
actions
underpinnings  of  the  two  distinct  theories.  The  former  class  of
actions  originates  in  contract  law,  which  directs  its  attention  to  the
purchaser’s  disappointed  expectations;  the  latter  originates  in  tort
law, which traditionally has concerned itself with social policy and risk
allocation by means other than those dictated by the marketplace.

[Some] criticize the consumer-expectation-based tests for product
defect and argue instead for the use of a risk/utility approach. . . . One
of  the  cited  commentators,  for  example,  argues  that  the  consumer
expectation test is a “blunt instrument” “when it comes to recognizing
and  maximizing  the  .  .  .  goals,  objectives,  interests  and  values
important to  modern tort law”  (Kennedy,  The  Role  of  the  Consumer

Expectation Test Under Louisiana’s Products Liability Tort Doctrine,
69 Tul. L. Rev. 117, 152 [emphasis supplied]).

Signiﬁcantly, the consumer-expectation test has its advocates as
well  as  its  critics.  In  view  of  the  “rigors  of  the  risk-utility  test,”  it  has
been  suggested  that  it  is  “worthwhile”  to  retain  the  consumer-
expectation test . . . rather than simply abandoning it.

In any event, while the critics and commentators may debate the
relative  merits  of  the  consumer-expectation  and  risk/utility  tests,
there  is  no  existing  authority  for  the  proposition  that  the  risk/utility
analysis  is  appropriate  when  the  plaintiff’s  claim  rests  on  a  claimed
breach  of  implied  warranty  under  UCC  2-314(2)(c)  and  2-318.
Further,  .  .  .  the  negligence-like  risk/utility  approach  is  foreign  to  the
realm of contract law.

As a practical matter, the distinction between the defect concepts
in tort law and in implied warranty theory may have little or no effect
in most cases. In this case, however, the nature of the proof and the
way in which the fact issues were litigated demonstrates how the two
causes of action can diverge. In the trial court, Ford took the position
that the design features of which plaintiffs complain, i.e., the Bronco
II’s  high  center  of  gravity,  narrow  track  width,  short  wheel  base  and
specially  tailored  suspension  system,  were  important  to  preserving
the  vehicle’s  ability  to  drive  over  the  highly  irregular  terrain  that
typiﬁes off-road travel. Ford’s proof in this regard was relevant to the
strict  products  liability  risk/utility  equation,  which  required  the  fact
ﬁnder  to  determine  whether  the  Bronco  II’s  value  as  an  off-road
vehicle outweighed the risk of the rollover accidents that could occur
when the vehicle was used for other driving tasks.

On the other hand, plaintiffs’ proof focused, in part, on the sale of
the Bronco II for suburban driving and everyday road travel. Plaintiffs
also adduced proof that the Bronco II’s design characteristics made it
unusually  susceptible  to  rollover  accidents  when  used  on  paved
roads. All of this evidence was useful in showing that routine highway

and street driving was the “ordinary purpose” for which the Bronco II
was sold and that it was not “ﬁt” — or safe — for that purpose.

Thus, under the evidence in this case, a rational fact ﬁnder could
have  simultaneously  concluded  that  the  Bronco  II’s  utility  as  an  off-
road  vehicle  outweighed  the  risk  of  injury  resulting  from  rollover
accidents and that the vehicle was not safe for the “ordinary purpose”
of daily driving for which it was marketed and sold. Under the law of
this  State  such  a  set  of  factual  judgments  would  lead  to  the
concomitant  legal  conclusion  that  plaintiffs’  strict  products  liability
cause  of  action  was  not  viable  but  that  defendant  should
nevertheless be held liable for breach of its implied promise that the
Bronco  II  was  “merchantable”  or  “ﬁt”  for  its  “ordinary  purpose.”
Importantly,  what  makes  this  case  distinctive  is  that  the  “ordinary
purpose” for which the product was marketed and sold to the plaintiff
was  not  the  same  as  the  utility  against  which  the  risk  was  to  be
weighed.  It  is  these  unusual  circumstances  that  give  practical
signiﬁcance to the ordinarily theoretical difference between the defect
concepts  in  tort  and  statutory  breach  of  implied  warranty  causes  of
action.

In Practice

liability has made it too easy for
product sellers to be found
liable, and that this has had a

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Different  Heritage.   The  court  in  Denny  describes  how  the  risk
utility test is similar to and derived from the law of negligence; while
the  consumer  expectation  test  derives  from  warranty  law.  Although
the  court  believed  there  was  substantial  overlap  between  a  strict
liability  design  defect  claim  and  a  breach  of  warranty  claim,  it
indicated  that  they  had  different  deﬁnitions  of  “defect” — at  least
under the laws of many jurisdictions. If that jurisdiction had employed
a consumer expectation test for a design defect, would it have made
sense  to  submit  a  separate  issue  on  the  breach  of  warranty  claim?
Regarding  the  court’s  suggestion  that  strict  liability  and  negligence
were  almost  one  and  the  same,  some  scholars  would  agree.  Some
have  suggested  that  it  is  foolishness  to  believe  that  a  design  defect
claim  is  analyzed  differently  than  a  negligence  claim,  at  least  when
the risk utility test is employed. Judge Posner made this argument in
the  context  of  Indiana  law  requiring  proof  of  negligence  in  a  design
defect case:

Expressly requiring proof of negligence in a design-defect case, as
Indiana  law  does,  though  unusual  really  isn’t  much  of  a  legal
innovation,  since  “defect”  always  implied  something  that  should
not  have  been  allowed  into  the  product — something,  in  other
words, that could have been removed at a reasonable cost in light
of the risk that it created.

Mesman v. Crane Pro Services, Inc., 409 F.3d 846, 849 (7th Cir. 2005).

2.  Problem.   Consider  whether  the  risk  utility  and  the  consumer
in  the  following

expectation  tests  would  yield  similar  results
scenarios:

A. A bulletproof vest is designed in a way that makes it susceptible
to  permitting  a  bullet  to  strike  the  person  wearing  the  vest,
because there are obvious circular areas cut out along the sides.
A police ofﬁce wearing one of these vests is struck in the ribs by
a bullet that hits in the area of one of these cutouts.

B. A well-known chef on the Food Network sells a set of knives that
are very sharp, for use in chopping vegetables. The plaintiff cuts
off her ﬁnger using this knife.

C. Marketing Defects

There  are  instances  where  a  product  has  great  utility  accompanied
with risks for which no better design is available. While such products
would  not  generally  be  considered  to  have  a  design  defect,  strict
products  liability  law  also  recognizes  that  a  marketing  defect  can
exist when needed warnings are not properly given to consumers. In
these  cases,  two  primary  areas  of  dispute  concern  (a)  when  is  a
warning required, and (b) what exactly must the warning say? When
the  plaintiff  has  suffered  an  injury  from  an  intended  or  foreseeable
use of the product, and no warning of this risk was given, the issue of
liability  for  a  marketing  or  warning  defect  is  concentrated  solely  on
the  former  issue.  In  some  instances,  however,  the  defendant  has
provided  a  warning  of  a  known  risk,  but  the  plaintiff  complains  that
the warning was not good enough. These two issues tend, in practice,
to  be  mutually  exclusive  because  it  is  difﬁcult  for  a  defendant  who
has given some warning of a particular risk to argue that no warning
was  necessary.  In  the  following  case,  what  is  the  nature  of  the
defendant’s defense to the argument that the product was defective
in its marketing?

1. The Duty to Warn

RICHTER v. LIMAX INTERNATIONAL
45 F.3d 1464 (10th Cir. 1995)

   , J.

Dearmedia  Richter  appeals  from  the  district  court’s  grant  of
judgment  as  a  matter  of  law  to  Limax  International,  Inc.  and  LMX-
Manufactures  Consultants,  Inc.  (collectively  Limax).  Richter  claimed
that  repetitive  use  of  a  mini-trampoline  manufactured  by  Limax
caused  stress  fractures  in  her  ankles.  In  March  1991,  Richter  sued
Limax  alleging  the  mini-trampoline  was  defectively  designed  and
came with an inadequate warning. The jury found, in a special verdict,
that  the  mini-trampoline  was  not  defectively  designed.  However,  it
nonetheless  found  Limax  was  liable  under  theories  of  strict  liability
and negligence for its failure to warn and determined damages to be
$472,712  reduced  by  Richter’s  percentage  of  fault  of  thirty-eight
percent.

Limax  then  moved  for  judgment  as  a  matter  of  law,  which  the
court  granted.  The  court  concluded  the  defendant  had  no  duty  to
warn  because  the  plaintiff  had  failed  to  prove  that  Limax  had
knowledge  of  the  danger  of  stress  fractures  or  that  the  danger  was
known in the state of the art. The court further concluded that under
these  circumstances  Kansas  law  does  not  impose  a  duty  on
manufacturers to warn about dangers they might have discovered by
conducting  reasonable  tests.  Richter  appealed.  We  reverse  and
remand  to  the  district  court  with  instructions  to  reinstate  the  jury’s
verdict and enter a judgment on the verdict.

Richter  purchased  a  mini-trampoline  from  Limax  on  February  1,
1989. There were no instructions in or on the box containing the mini-
trampoline,  although  the  trampoline  did  have  sticker  on  it  stating:

“This product was designed to be used only as an exercise device. It
is  not  designed  to  be  used  for  acrobatics,  trampolining  or  any
springboard  type  activities.”  Richter  stated  she  only  used  the
trampoline for jogging. She began by jogging for short periods of time
but  eventually  increased  her  time  up  to  sixty  minutes  per  day.  She
used the product until March 10, 1989. The next day she experienced
severe  pain  in  her  ankles  while  walking.  A  doctor  diagnosed  her  as
having stress fractures in her ankles. Richter testiﬁed the pain forced
her  to  discontinue  her  work  as  a  sales  representative  for  a  furniture
manufacturer.

The  plaintiff  produced  expert  testimony  which  established
relatively simple tests would have revealed that because the surface
the  center  and
of  a  mini-trampoline  depresses
decreasingly  towards  the  edges,  as  a
jogger’s  feet  strike  the
trampoline’s  surface  and  it  gives  way,  the  inside  of  each  foot  drop
further  than  the  outside.  This  rotation  of  the  foot,  which  is  termed
“eversion,”  occurs  to  a  lesser  degree  in  normal  jogging,  but  rebound
jogging markedly accentuates the degree of rotation.

Further testimony established it has long been known that lateral
pulling  on  a  bone  by  ligaments  or  muscles  can  cause  microscopic
fractures. If the bone is not allowed time to heal and the stress on the
bone  continues,  these  tiny  fractures  can  coalesce  into  a  stress
fracture.  The  eversion  of  the  feet  caused  by  the  mini-trampoline
results  in  certain  tissues  pulling  laterally  on  particular  ankle  bones.
Richter’s  expert  witnesses  testiﬁed  that
long-term  use  of  the
trampoline could cause stress fractures in the affected anklebones.

Limax  admitted  it  conducted  no  tests  relating  to  the  long-term
effects  of  jogging  on  the  mini-trampoline  and  did  not  systematically
review published studies of mini-trampolines by sports medicine and
exercise  specialists.  The  CEO  of  Limax  testiﬁed  the  company  had
sold  approximately  two  million  mini-trampolines  world-wide  and
Richter’s  complaint  about  stress  fractures  was  the  ﬁrst  Limax  had
received.  Further,  although  mini-trampolines  had  been  in  use  since

1975,  by  the  time  of  Richter’s  purchase  no  one  had  yet  suggested
their use entailed a risk of stress fractures. No expert testifying at trial
could  identify  any  study  or  article  on  rebound  jogging  or  mini-
trampolines  that  reported  ankle  stress  fractures  or  pointed  out  the
risk joggers faced of incurring such an injury.

testimony  by  experts

Richter,  however,  produced

that
observations  from  very  simple  tests,  interpreted  in  light  of  well-
established knowledge about the structure of the foot and the causes
of  stress  fractures,  would  have  made  it  apparent  that  the  repetitive
use  of  the  mini-trampoline  for  jogging  could  cause  stress  fractures.
Two experts testiﬁed the danger was well within the state of society’s
knowledge about such matters. One of Richter’s experts pointed out
that  although  there  were  no  known  reports  concerning  mini-
trampolines  as  a  cause  of  stress  fractures,  sport  and  exercise
magazines  as  well  as  scientiﬁc  and  medical  journals  have  long
published  articles  establishing  that  repetitive  jogging  can  cause
stress  fractures.  The  testimony  veriﬁed  that  such  repetitive  jogging
on  a  mini-trampoline  exaggerates  the  stresses  that  result  from
repetitive jogging on a flat surface. Although the mini-trampoline was
found  by  the  jury  not  to  have  a  defective  design,  Richter’s  expert
witness  testimony  established  that  the  marked  accentuation  of
eversion caused by the design of the mini-trampoline could result in
her kind of injury developing from her repetitive jogging.

Richter contends Kansas law imposes a duty on manufacturers to
test their products and warn consumers appropriately. In Wooderson
v.  Ortho  Pharmaceutical  Corp.,  the  Kansas  Supreme  Court  held  an
ethical  drug  company  had  a  duty  to  warn  the  medical  profession
about  what  “it  knows,  has  reason  to  know,  or  should  know,  based
upon  its  position  as  an  expert  in  the  ﬁeld,  upon  its  research,  upon
cases  reported  to  it,  and  upon  scientiﬁc  development,  research,  and
publications in the ﬁeld.” 681 P.2d 1038, 1057 (Kan.), cert. denied, 469
U.S. 965 (1984). Richter interprets the language “upon its research,” to
require  manufacturers  to  test  their  products  for  their  potential  to
injure consumers.

The  district  court  held,  “though  not  without  misgivings,”  that
Kansas  law  does  not  require  a  manufacturer  to  test  its  products  for
dangers  not  otherwise  known  in  the  state  of  the  art.  The  court  held
that because the evidence indicated that prior to Richter’s injuries, no
one  was  aware  of  the  possibility  that  jogging  on  a  mini-trampoline
could cause stress fractures, there was nothing to give rise to a duty
warn.

We ﬁnd the district court’s restrictive interpretation is contrary to
Kansas  law  on  the  duty  of  a  manufacturer  to  warn  consumers  of
foreseeable  dangers.  An  earlier  district  court  decision  summed  up
Kansas law relating to the duty to warn consumers:

Ordinarily, a manufacturer has a duty under Kansas law to warn consumers and
users of its products when it knows or has reason to know that its product is or
is likely to be dangerous during normal use. The duty to warn is a continuous
one,  requiring  the  manufacturer  to  keep  abreast  of  the  current  state  of
knowledge  of  its  products  as  acquired  through  research,  adverse  reaction
reports,  scientiﬁc  literature,  and  other  available  methods.  A  manufacturer’s
failure  to  adequately  warn  of  its  product’s  reasonably  foreseeable  dangers
renders that product defective under the doctrine of strict liability.

Pfeiffer v. Eagle Mfg. Co., 771 F. Supp. 1133, 1139 (D. Kan. 1991).

Kansas applies the same test to whether a manufacturer met his

duty to warn under negligence as it does under strict liability.5

Kansas  law  makes  clear  this  general  duty  to  warn  consumers  of
foreseeable dangers is not limited to ethical drug companies. In 1976,
Kansas adopted the rule set out in the Restatement (Second) of Torts
§402A (1965) in Brooks v. Dietz, 545 P.2d 1104, 1108 (Kan. 1976), an
adoption that has been repeatedly afﬁrmed. Section 402A establishes
strict  liability  for  a  seller  of  a  product  whose  defective  condition
makes  the  product  unreasonably  dangerous.  Comment  h  to  section
402A states that where a seller “has reason to anticipate that danger
may  result  from  a  particular  use  .  .  .  he  may  be  required  to  give
adequate warning of the danger (see Comment j), and a product sold
without such warning is in a defective condition.” Kansas courts have
relied on both comments j and k to section 420A in concretizing the
duty to warn announced in comment h.7

See Cott,  856  P.2d  at  931;  Humes  v.  Clinton,  246  Kan.  590,  792
P.2d  1032,  1039  (Kan.  1990);  Johnson,  718  P.2d  at  1323.  These
comments  make  clear  that  a  product  may  not  be  defectively
designed,  but  may  nonetheless  be  defective  because
the
manufacturer failed to adequately warn the users of the product of a
reasonably foreseeable hazard. The Kansas Supreme Court in Savina
stated this proposition as follows:

Under the strict liability theory, a plaintiff is not required to establish misconduct
by  the  maker  or  seller  but,  instead,  is  required  to  impugn  the  product.  The
plaintiff  must  show  the  product  is  in  “a  defective  condition  unreasonably
dangerous,”  which  means  that  it  must  be  defective  in  a  way  that  subjects
persons  or  tangible  property  to  an  unreasonable  risk  of  harm.  Prosser  and
Keeton,  Law  of  Torts  §99,  p.  695  (5th  ed.  1984)  A  product  can  be  defective  in
one of the following three ways: (1) a flaw is present in the product at the time it
is sold; (2) the Producer or assembler of the product fails to adequately warn
of  a  risk  or  hazard  related  to  the  way  the  product  was  designed;  or  (3)  the
product,  although  perfectly  manufactured,  contains  a  defect  that  makes  it
unsafe. Prosser, §99, pp. 695-98.

795 P.2d at 923 (emphasis added).

The  district  court’s  restriction  of  the  general  duty  to  warn  to
speciﬁc  design  defects  overlooks  that  under  Kansas  law  of  strict
liability,  even  if  a  product  does  not  have  a  design  defect,  failure  to
warn  of  a  foreseeable  danger  arising  from  the  product’s  normal  use
makes the product defective.

The mini-trampoline was speciﬁcally intended for exercise, and in
particular, for jogging. When used for this purpose, however, the mini-
trampoline’s  design  results  in  the  foot  turning  in  a  way  that  places
stress on the anklebones. That the design is not defective, within the
state of the known art, does not detract from the manufacturer’s duty
to  warn  the  consumer  of  foreseeable  dangers  that  can  arise  from
normal use.

Given  that  repetitive  jogging  on  the  mini-trampoline  could  cause
stress  fractures,  the  question  becomes  whether  Richter  presented
sufﬁcient evidence that a jury could permissibly conclude reasonable
tests  would  have  been  effective  in  bringing  this  danger  to  light.
Richter  presented  a  substantial  amount  of  expert  testimony  to  the
effect  that  visual  observation  of  a  person  jogging  on  the  mini-
trampoline by someone with expertise in biomechanics, would reveal
eversion  and  further  that  relatively  simple  tests  could  measure  the
degree  of  eversion.  A  comparison  of  that  measurement  with  a
measurement  of  the  eversion  caused  by  jogging  on  a  flat  surface
would have revealed mini-trampolines cause users’ feet to evert to a
markedly greater degree. Testimony established that it is well known
that  such  stresses,  experienced  on  a  repetitive  basis,  could  cause
fractures.  We  hold  the  jury  could  have  reasonably  found  Richter’s
injury  was  causally  related  to  repetitive
jogging  on  the  mini-
trampoline, the use for which Limax’s product was intended. The jury
could  also  reasonably  have  concluded  Limax  should  have  warned
users  of  this  danger  because  the  danger  was  eminently  knowable
given the state of the art and Limax should have known of it.

true  that  no  one  appears  to

until  Richter’s  injury  occurred,
but  it  is  also  true  that  plaintiff’s  evidence  demonstrated  that  the
danger was patently obvious to any expert who had a reason to look
for  it.  The  jury  could  permissibly  conclude  Limax  should  reasonably
have  foreseen  that  design  of  the  mini-trampoline  could  result  in  the
harm produced. Limax conceded that it did no testing or research to
consider foreseeable harm arising out of the uses to which the mini-
trampoline would be put.

Manufacturers  do  not  have  a  duty  to  test  for  inconceivable
dangers, nor do they have a duty to test for every conceivable danger.
They  do  have  a  duty  to  warn  of  dangers  of  harmful  effects  arising
from the foreseeable use and misuse of a product that are known or

are readily foreseeable in the state of art. In any given case, plaintiff’s
evidence  must  sufﬁciently  demonstrate  that  the  harm  incurred
should have been reasonably foreseeable to the manufacturer of the
product. Absent such proof a manufacturer cannot be held liable for
harm that no reasonable person could anticipate.

Every case must turn on its own evidentiary facts. In the present
case, plaintiff’s experts testiﬁed that the accentuated eversion of the
foot  caused  by  prolonged  jogging  on  the  mini-trampoline  made
Richter’s  injury  foreseeable  and  that  the  manufacturer  should  have
warned the user of the product of the possible foreseeable harm she
encountered.  We  do  not  make  this  ruling  as  a  matter  of  law.  We
simply ﬁnd that there existed substantial evidence in the record from
which  the  jury  could  ﬁnd  that  the  harm  was  foreseeable.  As  earlier
stated, we must review the evidence in the light most favorable to the
verdict holder. A fair and impartial jury concluded under the evidence
that  because  of  the  speciﬁc  design  of  the  mini-trampoline,  Richter’s
harm  was  foreseeable.  We  simply  conclude  there  was  sufﬁcient
evidence to allow the jury to make that ﬁnding.

We  ﬁnd  that  the  district  court  erred  in  granting  a  judgment  as  a
matter of law and we therefore hold that the verdict and judgment in
favor of the plaintiff should be reinstated.

inadequate  warning  creates  a

F.2d 1438, 1442 (10th Cir. 1987) (citing Wooderson, 681 P.2d at 1057).
Limax insists that because the jury heard no evidence as to what an
adequate warning might have been, the jury had no basis for deciding
a  warning  would  have  been  effective.  Limax  contends  that  to
establish  causation,  Richter  should  have  had  to  testify  she  would
have  behaved  differently  had  she  been  warned.  Kansas  does  not

require  such  self-serving  testimony  from  plaintiffs  and  Limax’s
argument  entirely  ignores  that  the  effect  of  the  presumption  is  to
place  the  burden  on  Limax  to  rebut  it.  The  trial  court  did  not  err  in
submitting the issue to the jury.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Duty to Warn.  According to the Restatement (Third), a product
has  a  marketing  defect  “because  of  inadequate  instructions  or
warnings  when  the  foreseeable  risks  of  harm  posed  by  the  product
could  have  been  reduced  or  avoided  by  the  provision  of  reasonable
instructions or warnings by the seller or other distributor . . . and the
omission  of  the  instructions  or  warnings  renders  the  product  not
reasonably safe.” §2(c) (1998).

2.  Negligence  Revisited.   Of  all  of  the  areas  of  strict  products
liability, the defective marketing (or warning) area overlaps most with
negligence  law.  The  court  above  quotes  Kansas  courts  as  holding
that  negligence  and  strict  liability  for  marketing  defects  are  one  and
the same. With respect to manufacturing and design  defects,  where
would those ﬁt on the continuum of negligence law versus true strict
(no fault) liability?

3.  Design  and  Marketing  Defect  Claims.   A  defective  marketing
claim  might  be  made  in  conjunction  with  a  design  defect  claim  or
independently.  In  the  Limax  case  above,  the  plaintiff  sued  on  both
theories though the jury rejected the defective design claim. Can you
understand  why,  at  least  in  a  risk-utility  jurisdiction,  it  might  be
difﬁcult  to  prevail  on  a  defective  design  of  a  mini-trampoline  claim?
Exactly  how  else  could  a  mini-trampoline  be  designed  to  avoid  the
“eversion” referred to in the case? On the other hand, even a product
with  a  proper  design  might  still  have  foreseeable  risks  associated

with  its  use.  In  these  instances,  the  product  will  still  be  considered
defective
lacks  a  reasonably  adequate  warning  of  those
foreseeable risks.

4.  Read  and  Heed  Presumption.   Courts  have  recognized  a  “read
and  heed”  presumption  to  help  facilitate  the  plaintiff’s  proof  of
causation  in  cases  where  no  warning  has  been  given.  Because
plaintiff  must  demonstrate  that  any  defect  caused  the  plaintiff’s
physical harm, this doctrine provides that if the required warning had
been given, the plaintiff would have read it and abided by the warning
to  protect  herself  from  the  injury.  This  presumption  thus  helps  the
plaintiff  in  such  a  case  to  prove  actual  causation  from  the  failure  to
warn.  However,
is  a  rebuttable  presumption,  meaning  that
defendants are allowed to try to persuade the factﬁnder that, had the
necessary  warning  been  given,  a  particular  plaintiff  would  have  still
disregarded  it,  making  the  failure  to  warn  immaterial.  In  such
instances, there is no causal link between the product defect and the
plaintiff’s harm and so no liability attaches.

5. Learned Intermediary Doctrine.  In most cases, the duty to warn
is  satisﬁed  when  a  reasonably  adequate  warning  is  given  to  the
consumer  (often  with  instructions  accompanying  the  product  or  on
intermediary
the  packaging
doctrine,  the  duty  to  warn  is  satisﬁed  with  respect  to  prescription
drugs and devices by providing the warning to the physician instead.
The  law  presumes  that  the  physician  can  decipher  such  warnings
and  decide  in  her  professional  judgment  what  information  needs  to
be shared with the patient when prescribing the drugs or device:

learned

Although ordinarily warnings must be given to the ultimate user of
a  product,  a  different  approach  has  been  developed  for
prescription  drugs.  It  is  settled  in  a  substantial  majority  of
jurisdictions that the duty a manufacturer of ethical drugs owes to
the  consumer  is  to  warn  only  physicians  (or  other  medical

personnel permitted by state law to prescribe drugs) of any risks
or contra-indications associated with that drug.

Stanback  v.  Parke,  Davis  &  Co.,  657  F.2d  642,  644  (4th  Cir.  1981).
Interestingly,  some  courts  have  held  that  the  learned  intermediary
doctrine no longer insulates sellers of prescription drugs from liability
where they have engaged in the direct marketing of such drugs to the
consumers (through advertisements) because the sellers are trying to
influence  the  consumers  directly.  See,  e.g.,  Perez  v.  Wyeth
Laboratories,  734  A.2d  1245  (N.J.  1999)  (“The  direct  marketing  of
drugs  to  consumers  generates  a  corresponding  duty  requiring
manufacturers  to  warn  of  defects  in  the  product”).  But  cf.  In  re
Norplant Contraceptive Prods. Liab. Litig., 165 F.3d 374 (5th Cir. 1999)
(applying  Texas’  learned  intermediary  doctrine  despite  aggressive
marketing of drugs by defendants).

2. Common Knowledge Exception

for

Tort law has a practical component to many of its doctrines. One of
those  practical  principles  concerns  a  disdain
requiring
unnecessary action. In Chapter 6, Special Duty Rules, we encountered
the open and obvious danger doctrine that eliminates any duty by a
premises owner to eliminate or warn about dangerous conditions on
the land of which an ordinary person would obviously be aware. With
respect  to  strict  liability  claims  for  defective  marketing,  tort  law  has
come up with an analogous exception to the normal duty to provide
warnings  about  the  risks  arising  from  the  intended  or  foreseeable
uses of products. This common knowledge defense is applied in the
Grinnell  case,  which  we  have  already  encountered  in  both  the
manufacturing defect and design defect sections. Pay close attention
to the subtle distinction the court makes between two different risks
of smoking as we visit this case one ﬁnal time.

951 S.W.2d 420 (Tex. 1997)

PART 3 — MARKETING DEFECT

Opinion  [As  set  forth  previously  in  this  chapter,  the  decedent  began
smoking the defendant’s cigarettes in 1952 and contracted cancer 33
years  later.  In  the  wrongful  death  and  survival  action  against  the
manufacturer,  the  plaintiff  asserted  defective  manufacturing,  design,
and  marketing  theories  of  liability,  among  others.  Part  III  of  the
opinion, set forth below, contains the Texas Supreme Court’s analysis
of  the  summary  judgment  granted  against  the  plaintiff  on  her
defective marketing (or warning) claim.]

A  defendant’s  failure  to  warn  of  a  product’s  potential  dangers
when warnings are required is a type of marketing defect. Caterpillar,
Inc., 911 S.W.2d at 382; Lucas v. Texas Indus., Inc., 696 S.W.2d 372,
377  (Tex.  1984).  The  existence  of  a  duty  to  warn  of  dangers  or
instruct  as  to  the  proper  use  of  a  product  is  a  question  of  law.
Firestone  Steel,  927  S.W.2d  at  613;  General  Motors  Corp.  v.  Sænz,
873  S.W.2d  353,  356  (Tex.  1993).  Generally,  a  manufacturer  has  a
duty  to  warn  if  it  knows  or  should  know  of  the  potential  harm  to  a
user  because  of  the  nature  of  its  product.  Bristol-Myers  Co.  v.
Gonzales, 561 S.W.2d 801, 804 (Tex. 1978). Nevertheless, this Court
has  recognized  that  there  is  no  duty  to  warn  when  the  risks
associated with a particular product are matters “within the ordinary
knowledge common to the community.” Joseph E. Seagram & Sons,
Inc. v. McGuire, 814 S.W.2d 385, 388 (Tex. 1991) (holding that no legal
duty  exists  to  warn  of  the  health  risks  of  alcohol  consumption
because such risks are common knowledge). American argues that it
had no duty to warn Grinnell of the risks associated with smoking its
cigarettes because the dangers of smoking were common knowledge
when Grinnell began smoking in 1952.

Comments  i  and  j  to  Restatement  section  402A  incorporate
common  knowledge  into  the  analysis  of  whether  a  product  is
“unreasonably  dangerous”  under  that  section  Comment  i,  which
deﬁnes
liability  against
manufacturers  unless  a  product  is  dangerous  to  an  extent  beyond
that  which  would  be  contemplated  by  the  ordinary  consumer  with
knowledge common to the community:

“unreasonably  dangerous,”

forecloses

Many products cannot possibly be made entirely safe for all consumption, and
any  food  or  drug  necessarily  involves  some  risk  of  harm,  if  only  from  over-
consumption. . . . That is not what is meant by “unreasonably dangerous” in this
Section.  The  article  sold  must  be  dangerous  to  an  extent  beyond  that  which
would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer who purchases it, with the
ordinary  knowledge  common  to  the  community  as  to  its  characteristics.  .  .  .
Good  tobacco  is  not  unreasonably  dangerous  merely  because  the  effects  of
smoking  may  be  harmful;  but  tobacco  containing  something  like  marijuana
may be unreasonably dangerous.

Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts  §402A  cmt.  i  (1965)  (emphasis
added).  Comment  j  excuses  a  seller  from  the  duty  to  warn  about
dangers that are generally known and recognized:

In order to prevent the product from being unreasonably dangerous, the seller
may be required to give directions or warning, on the container, as to its use. . . .
But  a  seller  is  not  required  to  warn  with  respect  to  products,  or  ingredients  in
them,  which  are  only  dangerous,  or  potentially  so,  when  consumed  in  excess
quantity,  or  over  a  long  period  of  time,  whenthe  danger,  or  potentiality  of
danger,  is  generally  known  and  recognized.  .  .  .  The  dangers  of  alcoholic
beverages are an example. . . .

Id. §402A cmt. j (1965) (emphasis added).

Common knowledge, in the context of comments i and j, connotes
a  general  societal  understanding  of  the  risks  inherent  in  a  speciﬁc
product  or  class  of  products.  Seagram,  814  S.W.2d  at  388.  In
Seagram we also emphasized that the standard for ﬁnding common
knowledge  as  a  matter  of  law  is  a  strict  one.  First  holding  that  the
term  “common  knowledge”  encompasses  “those  facts  that  are  so

well  known  to  the  community  as  to  be  beyond  dispute,”  id.,  we  then
noted:

Because  Seagram  is  asking  this  court  to  determine  common  knowledge  as  a
matter  of  law,  we  ﬁnd  the  judicial  notice  rule  helpful  in  providing  a  standard.
Compare  33  S.  Goode,  O.  Wellborn,  III  &  M.  Sharlot,  Guide  to  Texas  Rules  of
Evidence §201.2 (Tex. Prac. 1988) (requiring “high degree of indisputability” as
prerequisite  to  judicial  notice)  with  Brune  v.  Brown  Forman  Corp.,  758  S.W.2d
827,  830-31  (Tex.  App. — Corpus  Christi  1988,  writ  denied)  (“common
information  known  by  the  public  generally  based  upon
knowledge
indisputable facts”).

is

814 S.W.2d at 388 n.6.

Thus,  common  knowledge  is  an  extraordinary  defense3  that
applies  only  in  limited  circumstances.  As  the  court  in  Brune  noted,
common  knowledge  encompasses  only  those  things  “so  patently
obvious and so well known to the community generally, that there can
be  no  question  or  dispute  concerning  their  existence.”  Brune,  758
S.W.2d at 830-31. We will ﬁnd common knowledge as a matter of law
only when the standard set out in Seagram is met. It is not met in all
respects here.

For example, we do not ﬁnd the dangers of alcohol and cigarettes,
or  the  public’s  awareness  of  those  respective  dangers,  to  be
commensurate.  Unlike  Seagram  &  Sons,  which  did  not  dispute  the
health  dangers  of  prolonged  alcohol  use,  the  tobacco  industry,
including  American,  actively  disputed  that  cigarettes  posed  any
health  risk  at  the  time  Grinnell  began  smoking  in  1952.  Indeed,  the
industry  continues  to  dispute  the  health  risks  of  smoking  and  the
addictive nature of cigarettes, before Congress, in the national press,
and even at oral argument before the Court in this case. Despite this
ongoing  “dispute,”  we  are  bound  to  apply  the  rule  that  whether
knowledge  has  become  common  to  the  community  is  an  objective
determination.  See  Caterpillar,  Inc.  v.  Shears,  911  S.W.2d  379,  383
(Tex. 1995).

The  party  asserting  the  common-knowledge  defense  must
establish  that  the  dangers  attributable  to  alcohol,  tobacco,  or  other
products  were  a  matter  of  common  knowledge  when  the  consumer
began  using  the  product.  Based  on  the  summary  judgment  record,
we hold American established that the general ill-effects of smoking
were  commonly  known  when  Grinnell  started  smoking  in  1952.
However,  we  also  hold  that  American  did  not  establish  that  the
addictive  quality  of  cigarettes  was  commonly  known  when  Grinnell
began smoking in 1952.

Regarding  the  general  health  risks  associated  with  smoking,  the
Tennessee Supreme Court held as early as 1898 that these risks were
“generally  known.”  Austin  v.  State,  101  Tenn.  563,  48  S.W.  305,  306
(Tenn.  1898),  aff’d  as  modified  sub  nom.  Austin  v.  Tennessee,  179
U.S. 343, 45 L. Ed. 224, 21 S. Ct. 132 (1900). On certiorari, the United
States Supreme Court observed:

We should be shutting our eyes to what is constantly passing before them were
we  to  affect  an  ignorance  of  the  fact  that  a  belief  in  [cigarettes’]  deleterious
effects,  particularly  upon  young  people,  has  become  very  general,  and  that
into  the  public  press
communications  are  constantly  ﬁnding  their  way
denouncing their use as fraught with great danger.

179 U.S. at 348 (emphasis added). Other early courts also recognized
the  harmful  effects  of  smoking  cigarettes.  Gundling  v.  City  of
Chicago,  176  Ill.  340,  52  N.E.  44,  45  (Ill.  1898)  (cigarettes  are
“deleterious” and “injurious”), aff’d,  177  U.S.  183,  44  L. Ed.  725,  20  S.
Ct.  633  (1900);  State  v.  Nossaman,  107  Kan.  715,  193  P.  347,  348
(Kan. 1920) (dangers of smoking and deleterious effects of cigarettes
are  common  knowledge);  Liggett  &  Myers  Tobacco  Co.  v.  Cannon,
132  Tenn.  419,  178  S.W.  1009,  1010  (Tenn.  1915)  (cigarettes  are
“possessed of no virtue, being bad inherently”).

Moreover,  by  1962,  when  the  Surgeon  General’s  advisory
committee  began  examining  the  health  risks  associated  with
smoking, there were already more than seven thousand publications

of  professional  and  general  circulation  examining  the  relationship
between  smoking  and  health.  Of  these  publications,  articles
published in nationally circulated magazines dating back to the early
1900s  informed  readers  about  the  deleterious  effects  of  smoking.
Brown,  Is  a  Tobacco  Crusade  Coming?,  Atlantic  Monthly,  Oct.  1920,
at  447  (adverse  medical  science  ﬁndings  on  smoking  have  been
brought  before  the  public  for  the  past  thirty  years);  Does  Tobacco
Make One Tired?, The Literary Digest, Apr. 15, 1922, at 27 (noting the
effect of heavy smoking, light smoking, and nonsmoking on workers’
efﬁciency);  Hirshberg,  Truth About Tobacco,  Harper’s  Weekly,  Jan.  4,
1913  (consumer  awareness  of  claims  linking  smoking  to  cancer,
health  disease,  and  bronchitis  is  pervasive);  Norr,  Cancer  by  the
Carton,  Reader’s  Digest,  Dec.  1952,  at  7  (examining  data  and
projecting the number of future lung cancer deaths from smoking).

During  this  same  period,  many  books  examined  the  health  risks
the  use  of
associated  with  smoking  and  argued  against
cigarettes.  .  .  .  These  books  and  articles  published  before  1952
indicate  that  the  general  dangers  of  smoking  were  common
knowledge  even  before  Grinnell  began  smoking.  See,  e.g.,  Crist  &
Majoras,  The  “New”  Wave  in  Smoking  and  Health  Litigation — Is
Anything  Really  So  New?,  54  Tenn.  L.  Rev.  551,  553  (1987)  (“Even
prior to the beginning of this century, . . . the public [was] constantly
exposed  to  innumerable  reports  associating  smoking  with  health
risks.”);  Henderson  &  Twerski,  Closing  the  American  Products
Liability Frontier: The Rejection of Liability Without Defect, 66 N.Y.U.
L.  Rev.  1263,  1325  (1991)  (“The  amount  of  information  available  to
American consumers about the dangers of smoking is, and for some
while has been, staggering.”).

Not  only  does  historical  evidence  illustrate  the  public’s  pre-1952
awareness of smoking’s dangerous effects, but the Grinnells’ experts
also  conﬁrmed  that  the  health  hazards  of  smoking  were  common
knowledge when Grinnell began smoking. Dr. Ravenholt, an expert on
cancer and its causes, testiﬁed that the dangers of smoking were well

known by the 1950s: “I think the majority [of people] would have been
aware,  you  know,  an  adult,  reasonably  intelligent.”  He  also  testiﬁed
that,  in  1950,  “evidence  emerged  of  the  lung  cancer  producing
capability  of  smoking”  and  that  the  dangers  attributable  to  smoking
were extensively published and frequently front-page news stories in
the 1950s. Dr. Greenberg likewise testiﬁed that the decision to smoke
or refrain from smoking cigarettes is a matter of “individual personal
responsibility” in light of the health risks.

We  conclude  that  the  general  health  dangers  attributable  to
cigarettes  were  commonly  known  as  a  matter  of  law  by  the
community  when  Grinnell  began  smoking.  See  Caterpillar,  Inc.  v.
Shears,  911  S.W.2d  at  383
is  usually
determined as a matter of law).

(common  knowledge

We cannot conclude, however, that the speciﬁc danger of nicotine
addiction  was  common  knowledge  when  Grinnell  began  smoking.
Addiction  is  a  danger  apart  from  the  direct  physical  dangers  of
smoking  because  the  addictive  nature  of  cigarettes  multiplies  the
likelihood  of  and  contributes  to  the  smoker’s  ultimate  injury,  in
Grinnell’s  case,  lung  cancer.  See  Garner,  Cigarette  Dependency  and
Civil Liability: A Modest Proposal, 53 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1423, 1430 (1980)
(“Dependency  adds  a  new  dimension  to  smoking,  for  it  greatly
increases the likelihood of high volume, long term use which leads to
disease,  disability,  and  early  death.”).  This  Court  has  also  recognized
the seriousness of addiction and the need for manufacturers to warn
of  this  danger  in  the  context  of  prescription  drugs.  Crocker  v.
Winthrop  Labs.,  514  S.W.2d  429,  432-33  (Tex.  1974)  (holding  drug
manufacturer liable under Restatement (Second) of  Torts  §402B  for
misrepresenting  that  drug  “was  free  and  safe  from  all  dangers  of
addiction”);  see  also  Carlisle  v.  Philip  Morris,  Inc.,  805  S.W.2d  498,
516 (Tex. App. — Austin 1991, writ denied) (“Indeed, the failure to warn
of  cigarettes’  addictive  nature  could  be  the  essence  of  a  plaintiff’s
complaint.”).  We  acknowledge  that  some  authorities  support  the
proposition  that  some  members  of  the  community  associated

addiction with smoking cigarettes earlier in this century. Ploch v. City
of  St.  Louis,  345  Mo.  1069,  138  S.W.2d  1020,  1023  (Mo.  1940)
(cigarettes  have  “harmful  properties”  and  it  is  common  knowledge
that  nicotine  produces  “tobacco  addicts”);  Wiley,  The  Little  White
Slaver,  Good  Housekeeping,  Jan.  1916,  at  91  (people  can  become
“slaves”  to  the  cigarette  habit  and  cigarette  smoking  can  “shorten
their lives”).

The Surgeon General spoke to the addictive nature of tobacco in
the most recent and comprehensive report on the subject in 1988. In
that  report,  the  Surgeon  General  concluded  that:  (1)  cigarettes  and
other  forms  of  tobacco  are  addicting,  (2)  nicotine  is  the  drug  in
tobacco  that  causes  addiction,  and  (3)  the  pharmacologic  and
behavioral processes that determine tobacco addiction are similar to
those that determine addiction to drugs such as heroin and cocaine.
More recently, the Food and Drug Administration has concluded that
tobacco products are addictive.

But  we  cannot  simply  assume  that  common  knowledge  of  the
general  health  risks  of  tobacco  use  naturally  includes  common
knowledge  of  tobacco’s  addictive  quality.  Indeed,  as  David  Kessler,
former head of the FDA, has pointed out:

Before  1980,  when  FDA  last  considered  its  jurisdiction  over  tobacco  products,
no  major  public  health  organization  had  determined  that  nicotine  was  an
addictive  drug.  Today,  however,  all  major  public  health  organizations  in  the
United States and abroad with expertise in tobacco or drug addiction recognize
that the nicotine delivered by cigarettes and smokeless tobacco is addictive.

The  FDA  based  its  1996  assertion  of  jurisdiction  on  “a  wealth  of
epidemiologic  and  laboratory  data  establishing  that  tobacco  users
display the clinical symptoms of addiction and that nicotine has the
characteristics  of  other  addictive  drugs.”  Thus,  unlike  the  general
dangers  associated  with  smoking,  as  late  as  1988  and  certainly  in
1952,  the  danger  of  addiction  from  smoking  cigarettes  was  not
widely  known  and  recognized  in  the  community  in  general,  or,

particularly,  by  children  or  adolescents.  The  FDA  has  explained  that
because  of  tobacco’s  addictive  effects,  the  only  way  to  prevent  the
ensuing  disease  and  death  is  to  prevent  children  and  adolescents
from  starting  to  use  tobacco:  “Most  people  who  suffer  the  adverse
health  consequences  of  using  cigarettes  and  smokeless  tobacco
begin their use before they reach the age of 18, an age when they are
not prepared for, or equipped to, make a decision that, for many, will
have lifelong consequences.”

Because  the  community’s  knowledge  concerning  the  danger  of
nicotine addiction associated with cigarettes was not beyond dispute
in  1952,  the  Seagram  standard  for  ﬁnding  common  knowledge  as  a
matter of law has not been met. We agree with the court in Rogers v.
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.:

There  is  no  basis  for  our  judicially  noticing  what  the  ordinary  consumer’s
knowledge concerning the addictive qualities of cigarettes may have been when
[the plaintiff] began smoking in 1940. The state of knowledge attributable to the
community of individuals consuming cigarettes has changed over time and will
continue  to  do  so.  It  was  not  until  1988  that  the  Surgeon  General  published  a
report informing of the addictive nature of cigarettes.

557 N.E.2d 1045, 1054 (Ind. Ct. App. 1990). Accordingly, we hold that
American  did  not  establish  as  a  matter  of  law  that  the  danger  of
addiction associated with cigarettes was commonly known in 1952.

Because  we  conclude  that  American  did  not  conclusively
establish  that  the  danger  of  addiction  to  nicotine  was  common
knowledge,  the  Grinnells  may  maintain  their  strict  liability  marketing
defect claims to the extent they are based on the addictive qualities
of cigarettes, if no other defenses defeat those claims.

The  Grinnells  assert  that  American  breached  its  duty  to  warn
users  about  it  product’s  addictive  nature  because  before  January  1,
1966, the product’s packages contained no warnings. A manufacturer
is  required  to  give  an  adequate  warning  if  it  knows  or  should  know
that potential harm may result from use of the product. Bristol-Myers

Co. v. Gonzales, 561 S.W.2d 801, 804 (Tex. 1978). In the absence of a
warning,  a  rebuttable  presumption  arises  that  the  “user  would  have
read and heeded such warnings and instructions.” Magro v. Ragsdale
Bros., Inc.,  721  S.W.2d  832,  834  (Tex.  1986)  (citing  Technical Chem.
Co. v. Jacobs, 480 S.W.2d 602, 606 (Tex. 1972)). A manufacturer may
rebut  the  presumption  with  evidence  that  the  plaintiff  did  not  heed
whatever  warnings  were  given,  or  would  not  have  heeded  any
proposed warnings. See Magro, 721 S.W.2d at 834; see also General-
Motors Corp. v. Sænz, 873 S.W.2d 353, 358-59 (Tex. 1993).

The  Grinnells  assert  that  when  Grinnell  started  smoking  in  1952
he  did  not  know  and  had  heard  nothing  about  any  risk  of  addiction
associated with smoking. The Grinnells further assert that American’s
failure to warn of the addictive nature of cigarettes caused Grinnell’s
eventual death because Grinnell testiﬁed that had he known what he
later  learned,  he  would  never  have  started  smoking.  In  rebuttal,
American  cites  testimony  that  in  the  late  1950s  and  the  1960s,
Grinnell  continued  smoking  despite  warnings  from  his  father,
coaches, and friends.

At  most,  the  evidence  relied  on  by  American  establishes  that
some people warned Grinnell about the general dangers of smoking.
It does not conclusively establish that had Grinnell been warned that
cigarettes  were  addictive  before  he  began  smoking  he  would  have
refused to follow the warnings. Grinnell testiﬁed at his deposition that
if  he  had  known  of  the  dangers  associated  with  smoking,  including
addiction, he never would have started smoking. At the very least, this
testimony creates a fact issue regarding whether Grinnell would have
heeded  warnings  had  they  been  given  to  him  before  he  began
smoking. Dr. Grabowski, an expert on addiction, testiﬁed that Grinnell
was  addicted  to  cigarettes  by  the  late  1950s  and  early  1960s  and
could  not  have  stopped  smoking  without  “intensive  intervention.”  In
short, American’s summary judgment evidence does not conclusively
establish that adequate warnings would not have been followed and
thus  would  not  have  “made  a  difference  in  the  outcome.”  Summary

judgment  on  the  Grinnells’  marketing  defect  theory  related  to  the
addictive nature of cigarettes was therefore improper.

Thus,  to  the  extent  we  hold  that  the  general  health  risks  of
smoking were within the knowledge common to the community even
before  Grinnell  began  smoking  in  1952,  American  has  established
that  its  cigarettes  were  not  unreasonably  dangerous.  Summary
judgment  was,  therefore,  proper  to  the  extent  the  Grinnells’  strict
liability  claims  relate  to  the  general  health  risks  associated  with
smoking. However, we also hold that American did not establish as a
matter of law that the speciﬁc danger of addiction from smoking was
knowledge  common  to  the  community.  Therefore,  we  hold  that  the
Grinnells’ marketing defect claim survives to the extent it is based on
the  allegation  that  the  addictive  nature  of  cigarettes  rendered
American’s products unreasonably dangerous, and to the extent it is
not preempted by federal law.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Common Knowledge as a Defense.  The court indicates that the
common knowledge exception to the duty to warn only arises when it
is beyond dispute that a risk was a matter of common knowledge at
the  relevant  period  of  time  and  place.  The  Restatement  (Third)
articulates this exception, and its ration-ale, as follows:

A  product  seller  is  not  subject  to  liability  for  failing  to  warn
regarding risks . . . that should be obvious to, or generally known
by,  foreseeable  product  users.  .  .  .  Warnings  of  an  obvious  or
generally-known  risk  in  most  instances  will  not  provide  an
effective additional measure of safety. Furthermore, warnings that
deal  with  obvious  or  generally  known  risks  may  be  ignored  by
users  and  consumers  and  may  diminish  the  signiﬁcance  of
warnings about non-obvious, not-generally-known risks.

Section 2, comment j. (1998). While this is a fairly high threshold for
invocation of the no-duty doctrine, the court above ﬁnds the common
knowledge defense applicable to the risk of cancer but not applicable
to the risk of addiction. Why does the court distinguish between these
two risks in terms of the viability of this defense?

2.  Knowledge  as  a  Creator  and  Destroyer  of  Duty.   The
foreseeability of a risk of harm associated with the use of a product
can  be  seen  on  a  continuum  as  both  the  creator  and  destroyer  of  a
duty  to  warn.  On  the  one  hand,  tort  law  requires  there  to  be  some
foreseeable risk of harm associated with the product — at least in the
so-called  “state  of  the  art” — as  a  prerequisite  for  imposing  any
obligation (or duty) to warn about the uses of the product. But where
that knowledge rises to the level of undisputed common knowledge,
the duty to warn is eviscerated.

3.  Problems.   Would  the  common  knowledge  exception  apply  to

any of the following risks?

A.  The  risks  associated  with  intoxication  from  drinking  alcoholic

beverages

B.  The  risks  associated  with  falling  off  of  a  trampoline  while

jumping on it

C. The risk of death from being shot with a ﬁrearm
D. The risk of liver or kidney dysfunction from taking the herb kava

root

IV  DEFENSES ARISING OUT OF PLAINTIFF’S

MISCONDUCT

Some defenses apply equally to strict products liability claims as they
do  to  any  other  tort  claim.  For  example,  a  plaintiff’s  delinquency  in
ﬁling a strict liability claim gives rise to a defense under the applicable
statute  of  limitations  (as  covered  in  Chapter  7).  Other  defenses  are
unique  to  products  claims.  As  was  discussed  in  Dawson,  a  federal
statute  might  be  interpreted  to  expressly  or  implicitly  preempt  the
availability of state law products liability claims. Or a state might give
presumptive  or  controlling  weight  to  the  federal  government’s
approval of a manufacturer’s design or warning. All of these defenses,
both general to any tort suit and unique to a products liability claim,
have  already  been  discussed.  What  remains  for  our  consideration,
however,  is  the  extent  to  which  defenses  based  upon  a  claimant’s
misconduct might be recognized in a strict liability products suit.

Initially at common law, courts uniformly refused to recognize any
general act of negligence by a claimant as even a partial defense to a
claim  for  strict  liability.  Punishing  the  plaintiff  for  her  misconduct
seemed  repugnant  to  the  goal  of  holding  the  defendant  absolutely
liable — such  refusal  to  recognize  contributory  negligence  applying
with  equal  force  to  all  varieties  of  strict  liability  claims,  whether
involving  wild  animals,  unusually  dangerous  activities,  or  defective
products. This rule of law was adopted at a time when any degree of
the  claimant  acted  as  a  complete  defense.
negligence  by
Nevertheless,  courts  were  willing  to  recognize  qualiﬁed
(i.e.,
unreasonable)  secondary  implied  assumption  of  risk  as  a  complete
defense.  Further,  in  a  strict  products  liability  lawsuit,  courts  likewise
recognized product misuse as an additional complete defense.

With  almost  all  jurisdictions  shifting  to  comparative  fault,  courts
began  to  reexamine  these  traditional  rules  for  blaming  the  plaintiff.

Some  courts  have  steadfastly  refused  to  change  their  view  of
defenses  in  strict  liability  cases  while  others  have  embraced  the
application  of  comparative  fault  (and  the  elimination  of  secondary
implied assumption of the risk as a separate defense) to strict liability
suits. This section will ﬁrst examine the ongoing debate over whether
to  recognize  negligence  as  a  defense  to  a  strict  liability  claim.  The
Bowling  and  Daly  cases  contain  excellent  contrary  opinions  on  this
question. Finally, we will look at the continuing role that the defense
of product misuse has in strict products liability suits.

A. Is Negligence a Defense to Strict Liability?

BOWLING v. HEIL CO.
511 N.E.2d 373 (Ohio 1987)

Appellant, Emma K. Bowling, brought this action against appellee, the
Heil Company (“Heil”), among others, in her representative capacity as
the  administratrix  of  the  estate  of  her  husband,  David  B.  Bowling,
seeking  to  recover  damages  for  his  alleged  wrongful  death.  Bowling
died  when  he  was  crushed  between  the  chassis  of  a  truck  and  the
dump bed mounted onto it.

Heil  is  engaged  in  the  business  of  manufacturing  and  selling
dump  truck  beds  and  hydraulic  dump  hoist  systems  designed  to  be
installed  on  the  chassis  of  trucks  produced  by  various  truck
manufacturers.  Heil  does  not  install  its  dump  beds  and  hoist
systems;  rather,  it  sells  them  to  authorized  distributors  who  install
them onto the chassis of trucks selected by their customers.

In May 1979, Ralph Rogers purchased the dump truck at issue for
use  in  his  backhoe  business.  The  truck  was  equipped  with  a  Heil
1617 DL dump hoist system, which included a dump bed, a hydraulic
hoist, and a hydraulic pump valve assembly.

As originally mounted, the 1617 DL system utilized a cable control
system  linking  the  truck  cab  controls  to  the  hydraulic  pump  valve.
Rogers  was  dissatisﬁed  with  the  operation  of  the  cable  control
system,  however,  and  returned  the  truck  to  [the  seller,]  Sweeney,
requesting  that  a
installed.  Sweeney
lever  control  system  be
contacted  Robco,  Inc.  (“Robco”),  another  Heil  distributor,  and  Robco
replaced the cable control system with a lever control system, which
had  also  been  manufactured  by  Heil.  The  failure  of  one  of  Robco’s
welds  made  while  installing  the  lever  control  system  triggered  the
tragic series of events culminating in David Bowling’s death.

On April 26, 1980, [the truck was being used to move ﬁve tons of
gravel.  One  of  the  individuals  using  the  truck]  pushed  the  in-cab
control lever forward to lower the dump bed, but due to the failure of
Robco’s  weld,  the  bed  would  not  come  down.  David  Bowling,  [who
was  present  and  assisting  in  the  job],  leaned  over  the  chassis,
underneath  the  raised  bed,  to  investigate  the  problem.  Bowling
reached in with his hand and grabbed the control lever on the pump
valve assembly, and when he manually manipulated it the dump bed
rapidly descended upon him, killing him instantly.

Appellant proceeded against Heil on [a theory of] strict liability in
tort. The jury returned a verdict in favor of appellant against Heil and
assessed damages at $1.75 million. Upon written interrogatories, the
jury  determined  that  Heil  was  strictly  liable,  that  Bowling  was
contributorily  negligent  but  that  he  had  not  assumed  a  known  risk,
and [apportioned 30 percent of the loss to Bowling].

Based  on  the  jury’s  ﬁndings,  the  trial  court  entered  judgment
against Heil for $1.75 million plus funeral costs, less those amounts
previously received by appellant by way of settlement with [Sweeney
and Robco]. On appeal by Heil, the court of appeals afﬁrmed the jury’s
verdict,  but  remanded  the  case  with  directions  to  enter  judgment
against  Heil  in  the  amount  of  $700,000  only,  representing  forty
percent of $1.75 million.

     , J.

[This  case  presents

issue  of]  whether  principles  of
comparative  negligence  or  comparative  fault  are  applicable  to  a
products  liability  action  based  upon  strict  liability  in  tort.  For  the
reasons that follow, we answer [this question] in the negative.

the

Included in the body of Ohio law governing products liability is an
analysis  of  the  defenses  available  in  actions  involving  allegedly
defective products. Currently, two afﬁrmative defenses based upon a
plaintiff’s misconduct are recognized. First, an otherwise strictly liable
defendant  has  a  complete  defense  if  the  plaintiff  voluntarily  and
knowingly assumed the risk occasioned by the defect. Second, such
a  defendant  is  also  provided  with  a  complete  defense  if  the  plaintiff
misused the product in an unforeseeable manner.

The  court  of  appeals  below,  construing  Comment  n  to  Section
402A, attempted to distinguish between negligent “afﬁrmative action”
by a plaintiff and negligent passive conduct by him in failing either to
discover  a  defect  or  to  guard  against  the  possibility  of  its  existence.
The  court  held  that  although  a  plaintiff’s  passive  contributory
negligence  provides  no  defense  to  a  products  liability  action,  his
contributorily  negligent  “afﬁrmative  action”  does  provide  a  defense,
and that such afﬁrmative negligence should be compared by a jury to
the  fault  of  a  strictly  liable  manufacturer  of  a  defective  product,  in  a
manner similar to the principles of comparative negligence.

Comment n to Section 402A provides:

Contributory negligence of the plaintiff is not a defense when such negligence
consists  merely  in  a  failure  to  discover  the  defect  in  the  product,  or  to  guard
against  the  possibility  of  its  existence.  On  the  other  hand  the  form  of
contributory  negligence  which  consists
in  voluntarily  and  unreasonably
proceeding  to  encounter  a  known  danger,  and  commonly  passes  under  the
name of assumption of risk, is a defense under this Section as in other cases of
strict liability. If the user or consumer discovers the defect and is aware of the
danger,  and  nevertheless  proceeds  unreasonably  to  make  use  of  the  product
and is injured by it, he is barred from recovery.

The  court  of  appeals  has  carved  out  a  middle  ground,  to  wit:
contributory negligence consisting of “afﬁrmative action,” theoretically
located  between  a  plaintiff’s  failure  to  discover  or  guard  against  a
defect  and  his  voluntary  assumption  of  a  known  risk.  There  is  no
such  middle  ground.  Comment  n  covers  the  entire  spectrum  of
conduct which can be termed “contributory negligence,” as applicable
to products liability actions. That spectrum begins with a mere failure
to  discover  a  defect  in  a  product,  continues  with  a  failure  to  guard
against the existence of a defect, and concludes with an assumption
of the risk of a known defect. “Afﬁrmative action” by the plaintiff is not
left  uncovered.  Failure  to  guard  against  a  defect  can  be  “afﬁrmative
action.” Indeed such would describe the conduct of David Bowling in
this case.

Under  Comment  n,  either  a  plaintiff’s  contributory  negligence
amounts to a voluntary assumption of a known risk, or it does not. If
it  does,  then  that  conduct  provides  an  otherwise  strictly  liable
defendant  with  a  complete  defense.  If  it  does  not,  the  contributory
negligence of the plaintiff provides no defense.3

In  the  case  sub  judice,  the

jury  found  that  Bowling  was
contributorily  negligent  but  that  he  had  not  assumed  a  known  risk.
Therefore,  his  contributory  negligence  did  not  provide  Heil  with  a
defense to appellant’s strict liability claim.

Of  course,  the  absence  of  support  in  either  the  Restatement  or
existing Ohio law for the recognition of comparative negligence as a
defense  to  strict  liability  does  not  preclude  this  court  from  adopting
comparative  negligence  principles  as  part  of  the  law  of  products
liability.  This  court,  having  developed  that  body  of  law,  remains
inherently  vested  with  the  power  to  modify  it.  We  now  turn  to  a
consideration of the public policy underlying the application of strict
liability in tort to products liability cases, in order to demonstrate why
such modiﬁcation is not appropriate.

Dean Prosser has [explained the goals of strict products liability in

these] terms:

The costs of damaging events due to defectively dangerous products can best
be borne by the enterprisers who make and sell these products. Those who are
merchants  and  especially  those  engaged  in  the  manufacturing  enterprise
have  the  capacity  to  distribute  the  losses  of  the  few  among  the  many  who
purchase the products. It is not a ‘deep pocket’ theory but rather a “risk-bearing
economic” theory. The assumption is that the manufacturer can shift the costs
of  accidents  to  purchasers  for  use  by  charging  higher  prices  for  the  costs  of
products.

(Emphasis added.) Prosser & Keeton, Law of Torts (5 Ed. 1984) 692-
693, Section 98.

liability

Under  negligence  principles,  on  the  other  hand,

is
determined  according  to  fault.  In  negligence,  we  seek  to  make  the
person  or  persons  responsible  for  causing  a  loss  pay  for  it.  In  other
words, we “blame” the loss on the negligent party or parties because
it  was  they  who  could  have  avoided  the  loss  by  conforming  to  due
care. Conversely, in strict liability in tort we hold the manufacturer or
is
seller  of  a  defective  product  responsible,  not  because
“blameworthy,”  but  because  it  is  more  able  than  the  consumers  to
spread that loss among those who use and thereby beneﬁt from the
product.

it

We  recognize  that  strict  liability  cannot  be  absolutely  divorced
from traditional concepts of fault. In a sense we “blame” the loss on
the  manufacturer  or  seller  because  it  introduced  the  defective
product into the marketplace. However, it must be reemphasized that
strict liability is at odds with traditional notions of due care.

In sum, the public policy and goals underlying strict liability differ

in important respects from those underlying the law of negligence.

Comparative negligence or comparative fault has been applied in
products  liability  cases  by  a  number  of  courts,  both  in  states  that
have  comparative  negligence  statutes  and
in  states  where
comparative  negligence  was  judicially  adopted.  See,  e.g.,  Duncan  v.

Cessna  Aircraft  Co.  (Tex.  1984),  665  S.W.2d  414;  Mulherin  v.
Ingersoll-Rand  Co.  (Utah  1981),  628  P.2d  1301;  Daly  v.  General
Motors  Corp.,  575  P.2d  1162  (Cal.  1978).  On  the  other  hand,
numerous  courts  have  refused  to  apply  comparative  negligence
principles  to  products  liability  cases.  See,  e.g.,  Young’s  Machine  Co.
v. Long,  692  P.2d  24  (Nev.  1984);  Correia  v.  Firestone  Tire  &  Rubber
Co., 446 N.E.2d 1033 (Mass. 1983); Seay v. Chrysler Corp.,  609  P.2d
1382 (Wash. 1980); Smith v. Smith, 278 N.W.2d 155 (S.D. 1979).

We  believe  that  the  better-reasoned  decisions  are  those  that
decline  to  inject  a  plaintiff’s  negligence  into  the  law  of  products
liability. We agree with Justice Mosk of the California Supreme Court,
who stated in his dissent in Daly v. General Motors Corp.:

The defective product is comparable to a time bomb ready to explode; it maims
its  victims  indiscriminately,  the  righteous  and  the  evil,  the  careful  and  the
careless. Thus when a faulty design or otherwise defective product is involved,
the  litigation  should  not  be  diverted  to  consideration  of  the  negligence  of  the
plaintiff. The liability issues are simple: was the product or its design faulty, did
the defendant inject the defective product into the stream of commerce, and did
the defect cause the injury? The conduct of the ultimate consumer-victim who
used the product in the contemplated or foreseeable manner is wholly irrelevant
to those issues.

Id. at 1183-1184.

Therefore, when we search the decisions from other jurisdictions,
we ﬁnd no rationale which persuades us that comparative negligence
or comparative fault principles should be applied to products liability
actions.

We  therefore  reverse  the  judgment  of  the  court  of  appeals  with
respect  to  its  reduction  of  appellant’s  verdict  by  the  thirty  percent
found  by  the  jury  to  be  attributable  to  Bowling’s  contributory
negligence.

DALY v. GENERAL MOTORS CORP.

575 P.2d 1162 (Cal. 1978)

          , J.

[The  family  of  a  man  killed  in  a  one-car  accident  brought  a  strict
products liability action against the manufacturer of the car and other
companies who were sellers in the chain of distribution. The car hit a
metal  freeway  divider  at  more  than  50  miles  per  hour,  and  the
decedent had been thrown through the door and suffered fatal head
injuries.  It  was  undisputed  that  had  he  remained  inside  the  car  his
injuries  would  have  been  minor.  Plaintiffs  proved  that  an  exposed
push button on the exterior door handle, which had caused the door
to  open,  constituted  a  design  “defect.”  Over  plaintiffs’  objection,
defendants introduced evidence that the car was ﬁtted with a safety
belt and doorlock, neither of which, despite a warning in the owner’s
manual, was being used by the decedent. Defendants also introduced
evidence that the decedent was intoxicated. Defendants’ theory was
that this evidence showed either product misuse or an assumption of
the  risk  by  the  decedent,  either  of  which  was  a  complete  defense
under  the  existing  law.  The  jury  delivered  a  verdict  in  favor  of  the
defendants and judgment was entered accordingly.]

The  sole  theory  of  plaintiffs’  complaint  was  strict  liability  for
damages  allegedly  caused  by  a  defective  product,  namely,  an
improperly designed door latch claimed to have been activated by the
impact. It was further asserted that, but for the faulty latch, decedent
would  have  been  restrained  in  the  vehicle  and,  although  perhaps
injured,  would  not  have  been  killed.  Thus,  the  case  involves  a  so-
called “second collision” in which the “defect” did not contribute to the
original impact, but only to the “enhancement” of injury.

Over plaintiffs’ objections, defendants were permitted to introduce
evidence [of the decedent’s intoxication and failure to utilize either the
seat belt or the door locks].

In  response  to  plaintiffs’  assertion  that  the  “intoxication-nonuse”
evidence  was  improperly  admitted,  defendants  contend  that  the
deceased’s own conduct contributed to his death. Because plaintiffs’
case rests upon strict products liability based on improper design of
the door latch and because defendants assert a failure in decedent’s
conduct,  namely,  his  alleged  intoxication  and  nonuse  of  safety
equipment, without which the accident and ensuing death would not
have occurred, there is thereby posed the overriding issue in the case,
should  comparative  principles  apply
liability
actions?

in  strict  products

“fault,”

It  may  be  useful  to  refer  briefly  to  certain  highlights  in  the
historical development of the two principles — strict and comparative
liability. Tort law has evolved from a legal obligation initially imposed
without
to  recovery  which,  generally,  was  based  on
blameworthiness  in  a  moral  sense.  For  reasons  of  social  policy  and
because  of  the  unusual  nature  of  defendants’  acts,  liability  without
fault  continued  to  be  prescribed  in  a  certain  restricted  area,  for
example,  upon  keepers  of  wild  animals,  or  those  who  handled
explosives  or  other  dangerous  substances,  or  who  engaged  in
ultrahazardous activities.

General dissatisfaction continued with the conceptual limitations
which  traditional  tort  and  contract  doctrines  placed  upon  the
consumers and users of manufactured products, this at a time when
mass production of an almost inﬁnite variety of goods and products
was  responding  to  a  myriad  of  ever-changing  societal  demands
stimulated  by  wide-spread  commercial  advertising.  From  an  historic
combination  of  economic  and  sociological  forces  was  born  the
doctrine of strict liability in tort.

We,  ourselves,  were  perhaps  the  ﬁrst  court  to  give  the  new
principle judicial sanction. In Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc.,
377  P.2d  897  (Cal.  1963),  [w]e  rejected  both  contract  and  warranty
theories,  as  the  basis  for  liability.  Strict  liability,  we  said,  did  not  rest
on  a  consensual  foundation  but,  rather,  on  one  created  by  law.  The

liability  was  created  judicially  because  of  the  economic  and  social
need for the protection of consumers in an increasingly complex and
mechanized society, and because of the limitations in the negligence
and  warranty  remedies.  Subsequently,  the  Greenman  principle  was
incorporated  in  §402A  of  the  Restatement  Second  of  Torts,  and
adopted by a majority of American jurisdictions.

From  its  inception,  however,  strict  liability  has  never  been,  and  is
not  now, absolute  liability.  As  has  been  repeatedly  expressed,  under
strict liability the manufacturer does not thereby become the insurer
of  the  safety  of  the  product’s  user.  On  the  contrary,  the  plaintiff’s
injury must have been caused by a “defect” in the product. Thus the
manufacturer is not deemed responsible when injury results from an
unforeseeable  use  of  its  product.  Furthermore,  we  have  recognized
that though most forms of contributory negligence do not constitute
a defense to a strict products liability action, plaintiff’s negligence is a
complete defense when it comprises assumption of risk.

In Li v. Yellow Cab Co., 532 P.2d 1226 (Cal. 1975), we introduced
the  other  doctrine  with  which  we  are  concerned,  comparative
negligence.  We  examined  the  history  of  contributory  negligence,  the
massive criticism directed at it because its presence in the slightest
degree  completely  barred  plaintiff’s  recovery,  and  the  increasing
defection  from  the  doctrine.  [W]e  announced  in  Li  the  adoption  of  a
“pure” form of comparative negligence which, when present, reduced
but  did  not  prevent  plaintiff’s  recovery.  We  held  that  the  defense  of
assumption  of  risk,  insofar  as  it  is  no  more  than  a  variant  of
contributory negligence, was merged into the assessment of liability
in proportion to fault.

We stand now at the point of confluence of these two conceptual
streams,  having  been  greatly  assisted  by  the  thoughtful  analysis  of
the parties and the valuable assistance of numerous amici curiae. We
are  by  no  means  the  ﬁrst  to  consider  the  interaction  of  these  two
developing principles. As with the litigants before us, responsible and
respected  authorities  have  reached  opposing  conclusions  stressing

in  various  degrees  the  different  considerations  which  we  now
examine.

Those  counseling  against  the  recognition  of  comparative  fault
principles in strict products liability cases vigorously stress, perhaps
equally,  not  only  the  conceptual,  but  also  the  semantic  difﬁculties
incident  to  such  a  course.  The  task  of  merging  the  two  concepts  is
said to be impossible, that “apples and oranges” cannot be compared,
that  “oil  and  water”  do  not  mix,  and  that  strict  liability,  which  is  not
founded  on  negligence  or  fault,  is  inhospitable  to  comparative
principles.  The  syllogism  runs,  contributory  negligence  was  only  a
to  negligence,  comparative  negligence  only  affects
defense
contributory negligence, therefore comparative negligence cannot be
a defense to strict liability. While fully recognizing the theoretical and
semantic  distinctions  between  the  twin  principles  of  strict  products
liability  and  traditional  negligence,  we  think  they  can  be  blended  or
accommodated.

The inherent difﬁculty in the “apples and oranges” argument is its
insistence  on  ﬁxed  and  precise  deﬁnitional  treatment  of
legal
concepts.  In  the  evolving  areas  of  both  products  liability  and  tort
defenses,  however,
there  has  developed  much  conceptual
overlapping  and  interweaving  in  order  to  attain  substantial  justice.
The  concept  of  strict  liability  itself,  as  we  have  noted,  arose  from
dissatisfaction  with  the  wooden  formalisms  of  traditional  tort  and
contract principles in order to protect the consumer of manufactured
goods.  Similarly,  increasing  social  awareness  of  its  harsh  “all  or
nothing”  consequences  led  us  in  Li  to  moderate  the  impact  of
traditional contributory negligence in order to accomplish a fairer and
more  balanced  result.  We  acknowledged  an  intermixing  of  defenses
of  contributory  negligence  and  assumption  of  risk  and  formally
effected  a  type  of  merger:  “We  think  it  clear  that  the  adoption  of  a
system  of  comparative  negligence  should  entail  the  merger  of  the
defense  of  assumption  of  risk
into  the  general  scheme  of
assessment of liability in proportion to fault in those particular cases

in  which  the  form  of  assumption  of  risk  involved  is  no  more  than  a
variant of contributory negligence.”

Furthermore,  the

“apples  and  oranges”  argument  may  be
conceptually suspect. We think, accordingly, the conclusion may fairly
be  drawn  that  the  terms  “comparative  negligence,”  “contributory
negligence”  and  “assumption  of  risk”  do  not,  standing  alone,  lend
themselves to the exact measurements of a micrometer-caliper, or to
such  precise  deﬁnition  as  to  divert  us  from  otherwise  strong  and
consistent  countervailing  policy  considerations.  Fixed  semantic
consistency  at  this  point  is  less  important  than  the  attainment  of  a
interweaving  of  concept  and
just  and  equitable  result.  The
terminology  in  this  area  suggests  a  judicial  posture  that  is  flexible
rather than doctrinaire.

The  [goals  sought  to  be  achieved  by  strict  products  liability]  will
not be frustrated by the adoption of comparative principles. Plaintiffs
will  continue  to  be  relieved  of  proving  that  the  manufacturer  or
distributor  was  negligent  in  the  production,  design,  or  dissemination
of the article in question. Defendant’s liability for injuries caused by a
defective  product  remains  strict.  The  principle  of  protecting  the
defenseless  is  likewise  preserved,  for  plaintiff’s  recovery  will  be
reduced  only  to  the  extent  that  his  own  lack  of  reasonable  care
contributed  to  his  injury.  The  cost  of  compensating  the  victim  of  a
defective  product,  albeit  proportionately  reduced,  remains  on
defendant  manufacturer,  and  will,  through  him,  be  “spread  among
society.” However, we do not permit plaintiff’s own conduct relative to
the product to escape unexamined, and as to that share of plaintiff’s
damages  which  flows  from  his  own  fault  we  discern  no  reason  of
policy  why  it  should,  following  Li,  be  borne  by  others.  Such  a  result
would  directly  contravene  the  principle  announced  in  Li,  that  loss
should be assessed equitably in proportion to fault.

We  conclude,  accordingly,  that  the  expressed  purposes  which
persuaded us in the ﬁrst instance to adopt strict liability in California
would not be thwarted were we to apply comparative principles. What

would  be  forfeit  is  a  degree  of  semantic  symmetry.  However,  in  this
evolving area of tort law in which new remedies are judicially created,
and old defenses judicially merged, impelled by strong considerations
of equity and fairness we seek a larger synthesis. If a more just result
follows  from  the  expansion  of  comparative  principles,  we  have  no
hesitancy  in  seeking  it,  mindful  always  that  the  fundamental  and
underlying  purpose  of  Li  was  to  promote  the  equitable  allocation  of
loss among all parties legally responsible in proportion to their fault.

In passing, we note one important and felicitious result if we apply
comparative principles to strict products liability. This arises from the
fact that under present law when plaintiff sues in negligence his own
contributory  negligence,  however  denominated,  may  diminish  but
cannot  wholly  defeat  his  recovery.  When  he  sues  in  strict  products
liability,  however,  his  “assumption  of  risk”  completely  bars  his
recovery. Under Li, as we have noted, “assumption of risk” is merged
into  comparative  principles.  The  consequence  is  that  after  Li  in  a
negligence  action,  plaintiff’s  conduct  which  amounts  to  “negligent”
assumption  of  risk  no  longer  defeats  plaintiff’s  recovery.  Identical
conduct,  however,  in  a  strict  liability  case  acts  as  a  complete  bar
under rules heretofore applicable. Thus, strict products liability, which
was  developed  to  free  injured  consumers  from  the  constraints
imposed  by  traditional  negligence  and  warranty  theories,  places  a
consumer  plaintiff  in  a  worse  position  than  would  be  the  case  were
his claim founded on simple negligence. This, in turn, rewards adroit
pleading  and  selection  of  theories.  The  application  of  comparative
principles  to  strict  liability  obviates  this  bizarre  anomaly  by  treating
alike  the  defenses  to  both  negligence  and  strict  products  liability
actions.  In  each  instance  the  defense,  if  established,  will  reduce  but
not bar plaintiff’s claim.

We  note  that  the  majority  of  our  sister  states  which  have
addressed  the  problem,  either  by  statute  or  judicial  decree,  have
extended comparative principles to strict products liability.

Having  examined  the  principal  objections  and  ﬁnding  them  not
insurmountable,  and  persuaded  by  logic,  justice,  and  fundamental
fairness,  we  conclude  that  a  system  of  comparative  fault  should  be
and  it  is  hereby  extended  to  actions  founded  on  strict  products
liability. In such cases the separate defense of “assumption of risk,” to
the  extent  that  it  is  a  form  of  contributory  negligence,  is  abolished.
While,  as  we  have  suggested,  on  the  particular  facts  before  us,  the
term “equitable apportionment of loss” is more accurately descriptive
of the process, nonetheless, the term “comparative fault” has gained
such wide acceptance by courts and in the literature that we adopt its
use herein.

[The court ruled that the admission of evidence of the decedent’s
intoxication  and  failure  to  use  safety  equipment  was  improper
because it was not germane to showing any assumption of the risk or
product  misuse — the  only  blame-the-plaintiff  defenses  available  at
the time of trial. The court said the introduction of such evidence was
instead  a  “thinly  disguised”  attempt  to  inject  issues  of  general
contributory negligence into the case — a defense not yet available as
of the time of trial. The court believed it was this evidence that led to
the  jury’s  defense  verdict.  This  improper  admission  of  evidence,
therefore, necessitated a new trial. In the event of the new trial, such
evidence  could  be  offered  but  only  as  relevant  to  the  issue  of  the
decedent’s  comparative  fault  under  the  newly  applicable  pure
comparative fault system.]

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Apples  and  Oranges.   As  illustrated  by  the  two  cases  above,
courts  have  disagreed  over  whether  comparative  fault  principles
should  apply  to  strict  products  liability  suits.  The  traditional  rule,
preserved  by  Ohio,  is  that  contributory  negligence  is  no  defense  to
strict products liability, but secondary implied assumption of the risk

and product misuse are complete defenses. One reason these courts
refuse to apply contributory negligence to strict liability is because of
the  harsh  consequences  of  its  application.  However,  once  most
jurisdictions  abandoned  contributory  negligence  for  comparative
fault,  the  pressure  mounted  to  recognize  this  partial  defense.  In
response,  some  courts  continued  to  resist  the  argument  for
application of comparative fault due to the notion that the disparate
concepts  of  “negligence”  and  “strict  liability”  are  like  apples  and
oranges and impossible to compare to one another. Of course, some
scholars (and most courts) observe that even strict liability contains
some notion of fault:

In  the  case  of  products  liability,  the  fault  inheres  primarily  in  the
nature of the product. The product is “bad” because it is not duly
safe;  it  is  determined  to  be  defective  and  (in  most  jurisdictions)
unreasonably  dangerous.  [S]imply  maintaining  the  bad  condition
or placing the bad product on the market is enough for liability. . . .
One does not have to stigmatize conduct as negligent in order to
characterize it as fault.

Wade, Products Liability and Plaintiff’s Fault,  29  Mercer  L.  Rev.  373,
377 (1978). Do you ﬁnd the opinion of the Ohio court or the California
court more persuasive?

2. Is  Application  of  Comparative  Fault  Pro-Plaintiff?   As  you  read
the  Ohio  Supreme  Court’s  decision  adamantly  refusing  to  apply
comparative  fault  to  strict  liability,  the  impression  given  is  that  the
court’s holding is designed to protect the ability of injured consumers
to  recover — by  refusing  to  permit  their  misconduct  to  be  used  as
even  a  partial  defense.  On  the  other  hand,  retaining  the  traditional
rules also leaves intact the defense of secondary implied assumption
of the risk as a complete defense. In the California decision, the court
stressed that one advantage of applying comparative fault principles
to  strict  products  liability  cases  was  that  this  permitted  cases

involving  conduct  amounting  to  a  secondary  implied  assumption  of
the  risk  to  no  longer  raise  a  total  defense;  instead,  it  would  merely
permit  the  jury  to  apportion  any  fault  associated  with  such  an
assumption  and  to  reduce  the  damage  recovery  accordingly.  Thus,
the decision whether to retain the traditional defense rules or to apply
comparative  fault  principles  is  neither  purely  pro-consumer  nor  pro-
seller. Which set of rules is better for a plaintiff is dependent upon the
particular circumstances of the plaintiff’s case.

B. When, and How, Does Product Misuse Provide a

Defense?

In  Justice  Traynor’s  concurring  opinion  in  Escola  advocating  for  the
adoption  of  strict  products  liability,  his  ﬁnal  caveat  was  that  the
seller’s liability “should, of course, be deﬁned in terms of the safety of
the  product  in  normal  and  proper  use.”  Similarly,  in  his  majority
opinion  in  Greenman  adopting  strict  liability,  he  summarized  the
plaintiff’s burden of proof as follows: “To establish the manufacturer’s
liability it was sufﬁcient that plaintiff proved that he was injured while
using the [product] in a way it was intended to be used as a result of
a  defect  in  design  and  manufacture.”  Seizing  upon  such  language,
courts  have  refused  to  hold  product  sellers
injuries
associated with some misuses of products. On the other hand, as we
in  Dawson,  where  the  court  rejected  the
have  already  seen
manufacturer’s  argument
that  an  automobile  need  not  be
crashworthy  because  crashing  is  not  the  intended  purpose  of  a  car,
the  misuse  defense  has  its  limits.  A  product  “misuse”  technically
might entail any use of the product not intended by the manufacturer
or  seller.  The  Daniell  case  below  involves  a  particularly  notorious
misuse  of  the  allegedly  defective  product.  Observe  what  role  the
plaintiff’s misconduct plays in the court’s analysis of whether a defect
existed in the product. What is most instructive about this case is the

liable  for

court’s  determination  about  what  factor  will  determine  whether  a
consumer’s misuse provides a complete defense to the strict liability
claim. You will also observe that the defendant could potentially have
used  the  consumer’s  misuse  to  its  legal  advantage  in  two  different
ways. In the Tokai case that follows Daniell, the court considers how
to  correctly  analyze  a  claim  of  a  possible  design  defect  when  the
product hurt an unintended, yet foreseeable, user.

DANIELL v. FORD MOTOR CO.
581 F. Supp. 728 (D.N.M. 1984)

       , J.

This matter comes on for consideration of defendant’s Motion for
Summary  Judgment  pursuant  to  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  56(c).  The  court,
having  considered  the  accompanying  memoranda  submitted  by  the
parties,  the  deposition  and  afﬁdavits  relied  upon  by  the  parties,  and
the  relevant  law,  ﬁnds  that  the  motion  is  well  taken  and  should  be
granted.  Summary  judgment  is  a  severe  remedy  that  should  be
cautiously  applied.  It  should  not  be  used  for  resolution  of  factual
issues appearing on the record. Summary judgment is appropriate in
this  case,  however,  because  certain  uncontroverted  facts  bar
plaintiff’s recovery.

In  1980,  the  plaintiff  became  locked  inside  the  trunk  of  a  1973
Ford  LTD  automobile,  where  she  remained  for  some  nine  days.
Plaintiff now seeks to recover for psychological and physical injuries
arising from that occurrence. She contends that the automobile had a
design  defect  in  that  the  trunk  lock  or  latch  did  not  have  an  internal
release  or  opening  mechanism.  She  also  maintains  that  the
manufacturer  is  liable  based  on  a  failure  to  warn  of  this  condition.
Plaintiff  advances  several  theories  for  recovery:  (1)  strict  products
liability  under  §402A  of  the  Restatement  2d  of  Torts,  [and  ](2)
negligence.

[Two]  uncontroverted  facts  bar  recovery  under  any  of  these
theories. First, the plaintiff ended up in the trunk compartment of the
automobile  because  she  felt  “overburdened”  and  was  attempting  to
commit suicide. Second, the purposes of an automobile trunk are to
transport,  stow  and  protect  items  from  elements  of  the  weather.
Plaintiff  has  not  set  forth  evidence  indicating  that  these  facts  are
controverted.

The  overriding  factor  barring  plaintiff’s  recovery  is  that  she
intentionally  sought  to  end  her  life  by  crawling  into  an  automobile
trunk  from  which  she  could  not  escape.  This  is  not  a  case  where  a
person inadvertently became trapped inside an automobile trunk. The
plaintiff was aware of the natural and probable consequences of her
perilous  conduct.  Not  only  that,  the  plaintiff,  at  least  initially,  sought
those  dreadful  consequences.  Plaintiff,  not  the  manufacturer  of  the
vehicle, is responsible for this unfortunate occurrence.

Recovery  under  strict  products  liability  and  negligence  will  be
discussed  ﬁrst  because  the  concept  of  duty  owed  by  the
manufacturer  to  the  consumer  or  user  is  the  same  under  both
theories  in  this  case.  As  a  general  principle,  a  design  defect  is
actionable  only  where  the  condition  of  the  product  is  unreasonably
dangerous to the user or consumer. Under strict products liability or
negligence, a manufacturer has a duty to consider only those risks of
injury  which  are  foreseeable.  A  risk
is  not  foreseeable  by  a
manufacturer  where  a  product  is  used  in  a  manner  which  could  not
reasonably  be  anticipated  by  the  manufacturer  and  that  use  is  the
cause  of  the  plaintiff’s  injury.  The  plaintiff’s  injury  would  not  be
foreseeable by the manufacturer.

The  purposes  of  an  automobile  trunk  are  to  transport,  stow  and
secure  the  automobile  spare  tire,  luggage  and  other  goods  and  to
protect  those  items  from  elements  of  the  weather.  The  design
features of an automobile trunk make it well near impossible that an
adult  intentionally  would  enter  the  trunk  and  close  the  lid.  The
dimensions of a trunk, the height of its sill and its load floor and the

efforts  to  ﬁrst  lower  the  trunk  lid  and  then  to  engage  its  latch,  are
among the design features which encourage closing and latching the
trunk lid while standing outside the vehicle. The court holds that the
plaintiff’s  use  of  the  trunk  compartment  as  a  means  to  attempt
suicide  was  an  unforeseeable  use  as  a  matter  of  law.  Therefore,  the
manufacturer  had  no  duty  to  design  an  internal  release  or  opening
mechanism that might have prevented this occurrence.

Nor did the manufacturer have a duty to warn the plaintiff of the
danger  of  her  conduct,  given  the  plaintiff’s  unforeseeable  use  of  the
product. Another reason why the manufacturer had no duty to warn
the  plaintiff  of  the  risk  inherent  in  crawling  into  an  automobile  trunk
and closing the trunk lid is because such a risk is obvious. There is no
duty  to  warn  of  known  dangers  in  strict  products  liability  or  tort.
Moreover,  the  potential  efﬁcacy  of  any  warning,  given  the  plaintiff’s
use  of  the  automobile  trunk  compartment  for  a  deliberate  suicide
attempt, is questionable.

The court notes that the automobile trunk was not defective under
these  circumstances.  The  automobile  trunk  was  not  unreasonably
dangerous within the contemplation of the ordinary consumer or user
of such a trunk when used in the ordinary ways and for the ordinary
purposes for which such a trunk is used. Skyhook Corp. v. Jasper, 90
N.M.  143,  147,  560  P.2d  934,  938  (1977);  Restatement  2d  of  Torts
§402A, comment i.

Having  held  that  the  plaintiff’s  conception  of  the  manufacturer’s
duty  is  in  error,  the  court  need  not  reach  the  issues  of  the  effect  of
comparative negligence or other defenses such as assumption of the
risk on the products liability claim. See Scott v. Rizzo, 634 P.2d 1234
at 1240-41 (N.M. 1981) (In adopting comparative negligence, the New
Mexico  Supreme  Court  indicated  that  in  strict  products  liability  a
plaintiff’s “misconduct” would be a defense, but not a complete bar to
recovery). The court also does not reach the comparative negligence
defense on the negligence claim. . . .

IT  IS  ORDERED  that  defendant’s  Motion  for  Summary  Judgment

is granted.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Unforeseeable Misuse.  In Daniell there was no real dispute that
the plaintiff’s use of the vehicle’s trunk to attempt suicide was not the
manufacturer’s  intended  use  for  the  product.  It  was  a  clear  case  of
misuse. But in terms of whether the defendant had an obligation (or
duty) to take the risks of being trapped in the trunk into consideration
in  designing  the  car,  or  in  preparing  instructions  or  warnings  for  its
use, the key determination was whether the misuse was foreseeable
or  not.  Given  the  characteristics  of  the  car’s  trunk  and  the  rather
bizarre  nature  of  the  plaintiff’s  conduct,  the  court  concludes  as  a
matter  of  law  that  her  misuse  was  unforeseeable.  This  conclusion
alone was sufﬁcient to permit the conclusion that no product defect
existed. The duty to design or provide warnings does not encompass
risks  that  arise  only  out  of  unforeseeable  misuses  of  the  product.
Would  this  conclusion  change  if  the  manufacturer  of  the  vehicle
starts receiving numerous reports of others attempting suicide in the
same manner?

2. Problems  with  Duty  to  Warn  Claim.   The  unforeseeable  misuse
of the product meant that the defendant was under no duty to provide
a warning for the product. The court also concludes that the danger
of  being  locked  inside  the  trunk  would  have  been  obvious.  This
conclusion would remove any duty to warn because of the common
knowledge doctrine. As if those two fatal flaws were not enough, the
court  also  observes  that  any  warning  about  the  danger  of  being
locked  in  the  trunk  would  have  been  ineffective  in  preventing  this
plaintiff’s  harm  since  the  plaintiff  desired  to  kill  herself.  This  is  an
example  of  the  facts  rebutting  the  read  and  heed  presumption.  Any
one  of  these  three  rationales  would  have  been  sufﬁcient  to  warrant

the  grant  of  the  defendant’s  motion  for  summary  judgment  on  this
claim.

the  majority  of

3.  Negligent  Misuse.   The  court’s  conclusion  that  the  plaintiff’s
misuse was unforeseeable ended the necessary analysis of the strict
liability  claims.  The  court  stated,  therefore,  that  it  need  not  consider
the possible negligence by the plaintiff in her misuse of the product.
Like
jurisdictions,  New  Mexico  has  applied
comparative  fault  to  strict  liability  claims  (whether  the  misconduct
relates to negligently assuming a known risk or involves some other
general  act  of  carelessness).  Had  the  plaintiff’s  misuse  been
foreseeable, the plaintiff might have still been able to prove a defect
existed. This is true in automobile defect cases involving allegations
that  the  car  was  not  crashworthy.  As  we  have  already  seen  in  that
context,  most  courts  hold  that  such  foreseeable  misuse  does  not
relieve  the  sellers  of  potential  liability  for  defects  related  to  the  car’s
crashworthiness.  But  in  such  instances,  if  the  plaintiff’s  misuse
involves  any  negligence  on  the  plaintiff’s  part,  the  misuse  can  give
rise to demonstrating comparative fault which will serve at least as a
partial  defense  by  reducing  the  recoverable  damages.  Thus,  the  two
questions  any  defendant  must  consider  in  cases  of  product  misuse
are (1) was the misuse foreseeable to the seller, and if so, (2) did the
plaintiff’s misuse involve negligence?

4. Problems.   Consider  whether  a  product  manufacturer  or  seller
has a duty to attempt to reduce or warn about the following risks in
either their design or marketing of these products:

A.  A  teenager  uses  a  can  of  aerosol  hairspray  to  get  high  by

breathing the inhalant. He goes into a coma and dies.

B.  A  manufacturer  of  a  modeling  compound  called  “Ply-Doh”  is
sued  after  a  toddler  playing  with  the  toy  decides  to  eat  the
brightly colored substance and suffers a severe allergic reaction.
C. Some boys take their steel-tipped lawn darts and decide to use
them to play tag. One of the boys is hit in the eye with the dart. It
penetrates his brain and kills him instantly.

HERNANDEZ v. TOKAI CORP.
2 S.W.3d 251 (Tex. 1999)

     , J.

The  United  States  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Fifth  Circuit  has

certiﬁed to us the following question:

Under the Texas Products Liability Act of 1993 [Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ch.
82] can the legal representative of a minor child injured as a result of the misuse
of  a  product  by  another  minor  child  maintain  a  defective-design  products
liability  claim  against  the  product’s  manufacturer  where  the  product  was
intended  to  be  used  only  by  adults,  the  risk  that  children  might  misuse  the
product  was  obvious  to  the  product’s  manufacturer  and  to  its  intended  users,
and a safer alternative design was available?

In the context of this case, the question, more speciﬁcally, is whether
a disposable butane lighter, intended only for adult use, can be found
to  be  defectively  designed  if  it  does  not  have  a  child-resistant
mechanism  that  would  have  prevented  or  substantially  reduced  the
risk of injury from a child’s foreseeable misuse of the lighter.

The factual circumstances in which the certiﬁed question comes

to us are these.

Rita Emeterio bought disposable butane lighters for use at her bar.
Her daughter, Gloria Hernandez, took lighters from the bar from time
to time for her personal use. Emeterio and Hernandez both knew that
it  was  dangerous  for  children  to  play  with  lighters.  They  also  knew
that  some  lighters  were  made  with  child-resistant  mechanisms,  but
Emeterio  chose  not  to  buy  them.  On  April  4,  1995,  Hernandez’s  ﬁve-
year-old daughter, Daphne, took a lighter from her mother’s purse on
the top shelf of a closet in a bedroom in her grandparents’ home and
started  a  ﬁre  in  the  room  that  severely  burned  her  two-year-old
brother, Ruben.

Hernandez,  on  Ruben’s  behalf,  sued  the  manufacturers  and
lighter,  Tokai  Corporation  and  Scripto-Tokai

distributors  of  the

Corporation  (collectively,  “Tokai”),  in  the  United  States  District  Court
for  the  Western  District  of  Texas,  San  Antonio  Division.  Hernandez
alleged  that  the  lighter  was  defectively  designed  and  unreasonably
dangerous  because
it  did  not  have  a  child-resistant  safety
mechanism  that  would  have  prevented  or  substantially  reduced  the
likelihood that a child could have used it to start a ﬁre. Tokai does not
dispute  that  mechanisms  for  making  disposable  lighters  child-
resistant were available when the lighter Daphne used was designed
and  marketed,  or  that  such  mechanisms  can  be  incorporated  into
lighters at nominal cost.

Tokai  moved  for  summary  judgment  on  the  grounds  that  a
disposable  lighter  is  a  simple  household  tool  intended  for  adult  use
only,  and  a  manufacturer  has  no  duty  to  incorporate  child-resistant
features into a lighter’s design to protect unintended users — children
— from obvious and inherent dangers. Tokai also noted that adequate
warnings  against  access  by  children  were  provided  with  its  lighters,
even  though  that  danger  was  obvious  and  commonly  known.  In
response  to  Tokai’s  motion,  Hernandez  argued  that,  because  an
alternative  design  existed  at  the  time  the  lighter  at  issue  was
manufactured and distributed that would have made the lighter safer
in the hands of children, it remained for the jury to decide whether the
lighter was defective under Texas’ common-law risk-utility test.

The  federal  district  court  granted  summary  judgment  for  Tokai,

and Hernandez appealed.

A product’s utility and risk under the common-law test must both
be  measured  with  reference  to  the  product’s  intended  users.  A
product  intended  for  adults  need  not  be  designed  to  be  safe  for
children  solely  because  it  is  possible  for  the  product  to  come  into  a
child’s hands.

A  child  may  hurt  himself  or  others  with  a  hammer,  a  knife,  an
electrical appliance, a power tool, or a ladder; he may fall into a pool,
or start a car. The manufacturers and sellers of such products need

not make them childproof merely because it is possible for children to
cause harm with them and certain that some children will do so. The
risk that adults, for whose use the products were intended, will allow
children access to them, resulting in harm, must be balanced against
the products’ utility to their intended users.23

Even if an alternative design does not [overly] restrict a product’s
utility . . . it still may not be sufﬁcient for defective-design liability if it
overly  restricts  consumer  choice.  The  Restatement  (Third)  of  Torts:
Products  Liability  offers  [an  example]:  a  smaller  car  that  is  not  as
crashworthy  as  a  larger  car  merely  because  it  is  not  as  large.  A
chemistry set designed for the ordinary teenager is not unreasonably
dangerous  solely  because  it  is  possible  that  a  younger  sibling  could
get into it and harm himself or others. Products liability law does not
force  experienced  carpenters  to  use  only  nail  guns  that  are  safe  for
the garage workshop. To make such products safe for the least apt,
and  unintended,  user  would  hold  other  users  hostage  to  the  lowest
common denominator.

A  disposable  lighter  without  a  child-resistant  mechanism  is  safe
as  long  as  its  use  is  restricted  to  adults,  as  its  manufacturer  and
users  intend.  Tokai  makes  lighters  with  and  without  child-resistant
devices. Adults who want to minimize the possibility that their lighter
may be misused by a child may purchase the child-resistant models.
Adults  who  prefer  the  other  model,  as  Hernandez  and  Emeterio  did,
may  purchase  it  [though  such  products  have  since  been  banned  by
the  federal  Consumer  Product  Safety  Commission].  Whether  adult
users of lighters should [have been] deprived of this choice of product
design because of the risk that some children will obtain lighters that
are  not  child-resistant  and  cause  harm  is  the  proper  focus  of  the
common-law risk-utility test.

The utility of disposable lighters must be measured with reference
to the intended adult users. Consumer preference — that is, that users
like  Hernandez  and  Emeterio  simply  prefer  lighters  without  child-

resistant  features — is  one  consideration.  Tokai  also  argues  that
adults whose dexterity is impaired, such as by age or disease, cannot
operate child-resistant lighters, but Hernandez disputes this. If Tokai
were  shown  to  be  correct,  then  that  would  be  an  additional
consideration in assessing the utility of non-child-resistant lighters.

The relevant risk includes consideration of both the likelihood that
adults  will  allow  children  access  to  lighters  and  the  gravity  of  the
resulting  harm.  The  risk  is  not  that  a  child  who  plays  with  a  lighter
may  harm  himself.  We  assume  that  that  risk  is  substantial.  As
Hernandez and Emeterio both acknowledged in this case, they would
not allow a child to have a lighter and would discipline a child caught
playing  with  one.  Rather,  the  risk  is  that  a  lighter  will  come  into  a
child’s hands. The record before us suggests that children will almost
certainly  obtain  access  to  lighters,  that  this  will  not  happen  often  in
comparison  with  the  number  of  lighters  sold,  but  that  when  it  does
these
happen
considerations is relevant in assessing the risk of non-child-resistant
lighters.

the  harm  caused  can  be  extreme.  Each  of

In sum, a manufacturer’s intention that its product be used only by
adults  does  not  insulate  it  from  liability  for  harm  caused  by  a  child
who  gains  access  to  the  product,  but  liability  standards  must  be
applied in the context of the intended users.

■ ■ ■

Whether in the present case the issue is one of fact or law is not
for  us  to  decide.  The  Fifth  Circuit  has  asked  whether  a  defective-
design claim can be maintained under stated conditions. We respond
that it can, depending on the evidence, but there will also be cases —
the present case may or may not be one — in which a claim cannot be
maintained as a matter of law, for the reasons we have explained.

A few other arguments remain to be addressed.

Tokai  contends

that  a  defective-design  claim  cannot  be
maintained  in  the  circumstances  before  us  because  a  manufacturer
has no duty whatsoever to make products intended solely for adults
child-proof.  As  we  have  explained,  a  product  that  is  safely  designed
for its intended users is not unreasonably dangerous solely because
someone else may obtain the product. But we think the issue should
be  resolved  by  applying  the  standard  risk-utility  analysis  rather  than
as a matter of legal policy, at least in the circumstances of this case.

[this  suggested  approach

Tokai  also  contends  that  simple  tools,  like  hammers  and  knives,
whose  essential  utility  involves  intrinsic  and  obvious  dangers  to
children, should not, as a matter of law, be unreasonably dangerous.
[W]e  do  not  think
is]  helpful.  The
obviousness of the risk of harm and the inherent nature of the danger
are,  as  we  have  explained,  important  factors  to  be  considered  in
determining  whether  a  product  is  unreasonably  dangerous,  and  in  a
given case they may be conclusive of that issue. But that depends on
an  assessment  of  all  the  relevant  considerations  in  the  risk-utility
analysis, not on whether a product can be called a simple tool. Many
simple tools are not defectively designed merely because they are not
child-proof,  but  the  reason  is  because  they  are  not  unreasonably
dangerous  under  the  risk-utility  test,  not  because  they  are  simple
tools.

Tokai argues that the risk-utility analysis is ill-suited for cases like
this  when  the  utility  of  a  product  design  is  largely  satisfaction  of
consumer preference and the risk of harm, while improbable relative
to  the  number  of  products  sold,  is  often  calamitous.  We  recognize
that such circumstances make the use of the risk-utility test difﬁcult.
But we are reluctant to carve out exceptions to the risk-utility test that
we  have  employed  for  years  and  that  has  been  adopted  by  the
Restatement, especially when consumer expectation is a factor to be
considered  in  applying  the  risk-utility  test  and  may  in  some  cases
outweigh all other considerations. We believe that the risk-utility test,
properly focused, can be applied in a case like this.

Tokai argues that the weight of authority in other jurisdictions is to
reject disposable lighter design-defect claims as a matter of law. This
is  true,  but  there  is  more  to  it.  Courts  in  jurisdictions  that  employ  a
consumer-expectation  test  for  determining  defect  have  mostly  held
that  disposable
features  are  not
lighters  without  childproof
defectively  designed  because  they  function  in  the  manner  expected
by  the
jurisdictions
employing  a  risk-utility  analysis  have  mostly  concluded  that  the
determinative considerations are usually matters for the jury.

intended  adult  consumers.  But  courts

in

In  sum:  a  claimant  can  maintain  a  defective-design  claim  in  the
circumstances  posited  by  the  certiﬁed  question  if,  but  only  if,  with
reference  to  the  product’s  intended  users,  the  design  defect  makes
the  product  unreasonably  dangerous,  a  “safer  alternative  design”  as
deﬁned by statute is available, and the defect is the producing cause
of the injury.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Foreseeable  but  Unintended  Users  and  Uses.   The  Tokai  case
involves  the  misuse  (playing  with  a  lighter)  of  a  product  by  one  not
intended  to  be  using  the  product.  But  as  with  the  Daniell  case,
whether or not such unintended use creates an automatic defense to
liability depends on whether this misuse is unforeseeable. The Texas
Supreme  Court  was  unwilling  to  say  that  a  child  getting  hold  of  a
lighter is unforeseeable. In fact, the manufacturer concedes as much
with  its  own  observation  that  the  danger  of  access  by  children  to
lighters is “obvious and commonly known.” Given this concession, it is
difﬁcult for the court to rule as a matter of law that a manufacturer of
such lighters need not take into account the risk of injury to a child.

2. A Reﬁned Application of the Risk Utility Test.  The court in Tokai
is  careful  to  differentiate  how  the  court  (or  factﬁnder)  should  apply
in  the  circumstance  of  a  foreseeable  but
the  risk  utility  test

unintended  user  of  the  product.  It  states  that  the  risk  utility  test
should be applied with reference to the intended adult users with the
caveat  that  the  product  might  end  up  in  the  hands  of  a  child.  If  the
court  had  instead  indicated  that  the  test  should  be  applied  with
reference  solely  to  child  users,  do  you  see  why  the  risk  utility  test
would  obviously  declare  the  lack  of  childproof  features  to  be
defective? Given the proper focus, why is the question of a defective
design here much closer?

3. Risk Utility vs. Consumer Expectation Test.  Near the end of the
opinion,  the  court  explains  that  most  of  the  cases  ruling  in  favor  of
lighter manufacturers in this factual circumstance come from states
that  employ  the  alternative  consumer  expectation  test.  Why  under
that test is the product’s design not defective? Although as a general
rule,  plaintiff’s  lawyers  often  prefer  the  consumer  expectation  test
(due  to  its  simplicity  and  the  lower  cost  of  proving  a  defect  since
experts  may  not  be  necessary),  this  case  illustrates  that  there  are
exceptions  to  this  generalization.  Which  test  might  be  more  likely  to
lead to the conclusion that a design defect exists ultimately depends
upon  the  facts  of  the  particular  case  and  the  identity  of  the  product
involved?

4.  Problem.   An  unlicensed  14-year-old  obtains  the  key  to  the
family sedan and goes joy riding on the interstate at 90 mph. Due to
vibrations in the steering mechanism, he loses control of the car and
is injured. What role will the child’s inappropriate use of the car play in
determining  whether  the  car  was  defectively  designed  to  handle
being driven at such speeds?

Upon Further Review

Even when a product is well-built according to the original plans,
sellers may face liability either because the design rendered the
product  unreasonably  dangerous  or  because  the  product  was

unsafe  absent  some  appropriate  warnings  regarding  its  safe
use. Analysis of design defects is either done using the warranty-
like  consumer  expectation  test  or  the  negligence-like  risk-utility
test,  depending  upon
jurisdiction  and  the  circumstances.
Marketing  defect  claims  are  analyzed  in  a  manner  closest  to
to
negligence  analysis — some  would  argue
negligence  analysis.  Even  the  language  used  by  courts  in
marketing  defects  cases — duty,  breach,  constructive  or  actual
knowledge,  reasonably  adequate — all  allude  to  negligence-
based concepts.

identically

In terms of afﬁrmative defenses, general forms of negligence
were  not  permitted  to  be  used  at  all  at  common  law  in  a  strict
liability  case.  The  only  silver-bullet  defenses  were  related  to  the
consumer’s  misuse  of  the  product  or  secondary
implied
assumption  of  the  risk.  The  shift  away  from  contributory
negligence  to  forms  of  comparative  fault  has  convinced  many
jurisdictions  to  now  permit  the  plaintiff’s  negligence  to  be  a
partial  defense — something
the
tortfeasors’ conduct and which will at least reduce the claimant’s
recovery.  Some  courts  are  adamant  in  refusing  to  permit  any
ordinary  negligence  to  constitute  a  defense,  however.  In  most
jurisdictions  that  permit  comparative  fault  as  a  defense,  they
require the factﬁnder to apportion as merely another type of fault
any  conduct  amounting  to  an  unreasonable  secondary  implied
assumption  of  the  risk  or  unreasonable  misuse.  Of  course,
unforeseeable  misuses  of  the  product  need  not  be  taken  into
account when designing a product or providing warnings about
the risks associated with its foreseeable uses.

2. Third parties who wish to sell products on Amazon must create an account
and agree to the Amazon Services Business Solutions Agreement (BSA). The BSA
requires that third-party products include a product description and “comply with all
applicable  laws.”  Amazon  agrees  to  list  the  products  on  its  website,  “conduct
merchandising  and  promote”  the  products,  and  include  the  products  in  the
company’s star-based rating system.

4. The section [statutory exceptions under the innocent retailer statute] are not
material to our analysis at this stage of the case. If Amazon is correct that it is not a
seller, then it cannot be held liable under the Act regardless of whether Hu Xi Jie, the
manufacturer, is subject to the court’s jurisdiction.

11.  When  a  sale  has  occurred,  holding  and  relinquishing  title  is  a  necessary —
but  not  sufﬁcient — requirement  for  “seller”  status.  Relinquishing  title  does  not
confer  “seller”  status  when  doing  so  is  atypical  or  incidental  to  an  entity’s  regular
business  operations.  See  Centerpoint  Builders,  496  S.W.3d  at  40  (“[W]hether
Centerpoint technically sold trusses to Glenmont does not make it ‘engaged in the
business of’ commercially distributing that product.”); New Tex. Auto, 249 S.W.3d at
404-06 (holding that auctioneer was not seller because it did not normally take title
to auctioned vehicles even though it had done so in this case).

12.  Another  reason  the  two  types  of  commercial  transactions  should  be
considered mutually exclusive is that an ultimate consumer sale generally negates
the possibility that liability will arise from a non-sale commercial transaction. Unlike
ordinary  sales,  which  may  occur  several  times  in  a  single  distribution  chain,  non-
sale commercial transactions typically occur at the end of a distribution chain. For
example, a foreign manufacturer may sell a product to a domestic distributor, who
then sells to a retailer, who then sells to an ultimate consumer/user. Each sale may
trigger  Chapter  82  liability  for  the  non-manufacturing  seller  if  a  defective  product
reaches a consumer and one of the chapter’s exceptions is met. By contrast, a non-
sale  commercial  transaction  generally  occurs  only  between  a  seller  and  the
ultimate  user  of  the  defective  product.  Thus,  when  a  distribution  chain  ends  in  an
ultimate consumer sale, an injured consumer will sue on the sale, not on a non-sale
transaction.

1.  Although  not  applicable  to  the  present  case,  the  Texas  Legislature  has
codiﬁed  the  “safer  alternative”  requirement.  Tex.  Civ.  Prac.  &  Rem.  Code  §82.005
(safer  alternative  design  must  be  shown  by  preponderance  of  the  evidence  in
design defect case).

2.  By  arguing  for  liability  even  in  the  absence  of  a  reasonably  safer  alternative
design,  the  Grinnells  effectively  propose  that  we  adopt  a  system  of  categorical
liability  with  respect  to  cigarettes.  Categorical  liability  is  not  only  an  unworkable
solution, but also a position repeatedly rejected by courts. See generally Grossman,
Categorical Liability: Why the Gates Should be Kept Closed, 36 S. Tex. L. Rev. 385,
392 (1995) (noting that categorical liability has been advocated, unsuccessfully, for
alcoholic  beverages,  handguns  and  cigarettes);  Henderson  &  Twerski,  Closing  the
American Products Liability Frontier: The Rejection of Liability Without Defect, 66
N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1263, 1307 (1991) (courts should not abandon traditional risk/utility
test in favor of categorical exclusion).

5. In determining warning issues, the test is reasonableness. . . . “In all warning
cases [either negligence or strict liability] — even if the plaintiff or the court claims to
analyze failure to warn or inadequacy of warning in the context of a strict products
liability  claim — the  tests  actually  applied  condition  imposition  of  liability  on  the
defendant’s  having  actually  or  constructively  known  of  the  risk  that  triggers  the
warning.”  Johnson  v.  American  Cyanamid  Co.,  718  P.2d  1318,  1324  (Kan.  1986),
aff’d, 243 Kan. 291, 758 P.2d 206 (Kan. 1988).
7. Comment j reads, in pertinent part:

Directions  or  warning.
In  order  to  prevent  the  product  from  being
unreasonably  dangerous,  the  seller  may  be  required  to  give  directions  or
warning, on the container, as to its use. . . .

Where warning is given, the seller may reasonably assume that it will be
read and heeded; and a product bearing such a warning, which is safe for use
if it is followed, is not in defective condition, nor is it unreasonably dangerous.

Comment k reads:

Unavoidably unsafe products. There are some products which, in the present
state  of  human  knowledge,  are  quite  incapable  of  being  made  safe  for  their
intended  and  ordinary  use.  .  .  .  Such  a  product,  properly  prepared,  and
accompanied  by  proper  directions  and  warning,  is  not  defective,  nor  is  it
unreasonably  dangerous.  .  .  .  The  seller  of  such  products,  again  with  the
qualiﬁcation  that  they  are  properly  prepared  and  marketed,  and  proper
warning  is  given,  where  the  situation  calls  for  it,  is  not  to  be  held  to  strict

liability for unfortunate consequences attending their use, merely because he
has undertaken to supply the public with an apparently useful and desirable
product, attended with a known but apparently reasonable risk.

3. As we have stated, whether the risks associated with a product are common
knowledge is one factor courts consider when determining the existence of a duty
to warn. Common knowledge is referred to as a defense, see Seagram, 814 S.W.2d
at 388 n.5, because the product user has the burden to prove that the seller had a
duty warn of a product’s danger, while the product seller may assert that no such
duty existed because of the common knowledge regarding such danger.

3. Here, we discuss only the language of Comment n, which does not mention
the  defense  consisting  of  a  plaintiff’s  misuse  of  a  product  in  an  unforeseeable
manner.  In  some  sense,  such  misuse  is  an  act  of  contributory  negligence.
Nonetheless,  it  remains  a  defense  to  a  products  liability  action  based  upon  strict
liability in tort.

23.  “Texas  law  does  not  require  a  manufacturer  to  destroy  the  utility  of  his
product in order to make it safe.” Hagans v. Oliver Mach. Co., 576 F.2d 97, 101 (5th
Cir. 1978).

in  Busch,  would  there  exist  a  cognizable  claim  under  the  facts  from
the Burton case below?

A. False and Defamatory Statements

1. Early Application

BURTON v. CROWELL PUB. CO.
82 F.2d 154 (2d Cir. 1936)

 .     , J.

This  appeal  arises  upon  a  judgment  dismissing  a  complaint  for
libel  upon  the  pleadings.  The  complaint  alleged  that  the  defendant
had  published  an  advertisement  made  up  of  text  and  photographs;
that  one  of  the  photographs  was  “susceptible  of  being  regarded  as
representing  plaintiff  as  guilty  of  indecent  exposure  and  as  being  a
person physically deformed and mentally perverted”; that some of the
text,  read  with  the  offending  photograph,  was  “susceptible  of  being
regarded  as  falsely  representing  plaintiff  as  an  utterer  of  salacious
and  obscene  language”;  and  ﬁnally  that  “by  reason  of  the  premises
plaintiff  has  been  subjected  to  frequent  and  conspicuous  ridicule,
scandal,  reproach,  scorn,  and  indignity.”  The  advertisement  was  of
“Camel”  cigarettes;  the  plaintiff  was  a  widely  known  gentleman
steeple-chaser,  and  the  text  quoted  him  as  declaring  that  “Camel”
cigarettes  “restored”  him  after  “a  crowded  business  day.”  Two
photographs  were  inserted;  the  larger,  a  picture  of  the  plaintiff  in
riding shirt and breeches, seated apparently outside a paddock with a
cigarette in one hand and a cap and whip in the other. This contained

the legend, “Get a lift with a Camel”; neither it, nor the photograph, is
charged as part of the libel, except as the legend may be read upon
the  other  and  offending  photograph.  That  represented  him  coming
from a race to be weighed in; he is carrying his saddle in front of him
with  his  right  hand  under  the  pommel  and  his  left  under  the  cantle;
the  line  of  the  seat  is  about  twelve  inches  below  his  waist.  Over  the
pommel hangs a stirrup; over the seat at his middle a white girth falls
loosely in such a way that it seems to be attached to the plaintiff and
not  to  the  saddle.  So  regarded,  the  photograph  becomes  grotesque,
monstrous,  and  obscene;  and  the  legends,  which  without  undue
violence  can  be  made  to  match,  reinforce  the  ribald  interpretation.
That  is  the  libel.  The  answer  alleged  that  the  plaintiff  had  posed  for
the  photographs  and  been  paid  for  their  use  as  an  advertisement;  a
reply, that they had never been shown to the plaintiff after they were
taken. On this showing the judge held that the advertisement did not
hold the plaintiff up to the hatred, ridicule, or contempt of fair-minded
people, and that in any event he consented to its use and might not
complain.

We dismiss at once so much of the complaint as alleged that the
advertisement  might  be  read  to  say  that  the  plaintiff  was  deformed,
or  that  he  had  indecently  exposed  himself,  or  was  making  obscene
jokes by means of the legends. Nobody could be fatuous enough to
believe any of these things; everybody would at once see that it was
the  camera,  and  the  camera  alone,  that  had  made  the  unfortunate
mistake.  If  the  advertisement  is  a  libel,  it  is  such  in  spite  of  the  fact
that  it  asserts  nothing  whatever  about  the  plaintiff,  even  by  the
remotest  implications.  It  does  not  profess  to  depict  him  as  he  is;  it
does not exaggerate any part of his person so as to suggest that he
is deformed; it is patently an optical illusion, and carries its correction
on  its  face  as  much  as  though  it  were  a  verbal  utterance  which
expressly  declared  that  it  was  false.  It  would  be  hard  for  words  so
guarded  to  carry  any  sting,  but  the  same  is  not  true  of  caricatures,
and  this  is  an  example;  for,  notwithstanding  all  we  have  just  said,  it

exposed the plaintiff to overwhelming ridicule. The contrast between
the drawn and serious face and the accompanying fantastic and lewd
deformity  was  so  extravagant  that,  though  utterly  unfair,  it  in  fact
made  of  the  plaintiff  a  preposterously  ridiculous  spectacle;  and  the
obvious  mistake  only  added  to  the  amusement.  Had  such  a  picture
been  deliberately  produced,  surely  every  right-minded  person  would
agree that he would have had a genuine grievance; and the effect is
the  same  whether  it  is  deliberate  or  not.  Such  affects  a  man’s
reputation, if by that is meant his position in the minds of others; the
association  so  established  may  be  beyond  repair;  he  may  become
known  indeﬁnitely  as  the  absurd  victim  of  this  unhappy  mischance.
Literally,  therefore,  the  injury  falls  within  the  accepted  rubric;  it
exposes  the  sufferer  to  “ridicule”  and  “contempt.”  Nevertheless,  we
have not been able to ﬁnd very much in the books that is in point, for
although it has long been recognized that pictures may be libels, and
in  some  cases  they  have  been  caricatures,  in  nearly  all  they  have
impugned  the  plaintiff  at  least  by  implication,  directly  or  indirectly
uttering some falsehood about him.

The  defendant  answers  that  every  libel  must  affect  the  plaintiff’s
character; but if by “character” is meant those moral qualities which
the word ordinarily includes, the statement is certainly untrue. Thus, it
is a libel to say that a man is insane, or that he has negro blood if he
professes  to  be  white,  or  is  too  educated  to  earn  his  living,  or  is
desperately poor, or that he is a eunuch, or that he has an infectious
disease, even though not venereal, or that he is illegitimate, or that his
near  relatives  have  committed  a  crime,  or  that  he  was  mistaken  for
Jack Ketch, or that a woman was served with process in her bathtub.
It  is  indeed  not  true  that  all  ridicule  or  all  disagreeable  comment  is
actionable;  a  man  must  not  be  too  thin-skinned  or  a  self-important
prig;  but  this  advertisement  was  more  than  what  only  a  morbid
person  would  not  laugh  off;  the  mortiﬁcation,  however  ill  deserved,
was a very substantial grievance.

In all wrongs we must ﬁrst ascertain whether the interest invaded
is  one  which  the  law  will  protect  at  all;  that  is  indeed  especially
important  in  defamation,  for  the  common  law  did  not  recognize  all
injuries to reputation, especially when the utterance was oral. But the
interest  here  is  by  hypothesis  one  which  the  law  does  protect;  the
plaintiff has been substantially enough ridiculed to be in a position to
complain. The defendant must therefore ﬁnd some excuse, and truth
would  be  an  excuse  if  it  could  be  pleaded.  The  only  reason  why  the
law makes truth a defense is . . . because the utterance of truth is in
all  circumstances  an  interest  paramount  to  reputation;  it  is  like  a
privileged  communication,  which  is  privileged  only  because  the  law
prefers
is  no  such
countervailing  interest,  there  is  no  excuse;  and  that  is  the  situation
here. In conclusion therefore we hold that because the picture taken
with the legends was calculated to expose the plaintiff to more than
trivial ridicule, it was prima facie actionable.

it  conditionally  to  reputation.  When  there

Finally,  the  plaintiff’s  consent  to  the  use  of  the  photographs  for
which he posed as an advertisement was not a consent to the use of
the  offending  photograph;  he  had  no  reason  to  anticipate  that  the
lens  would  so  distort  his  appearance.  If  the  defendant  wished  to  ﬁx
him  with  responsibility  for  whatever  the  camera  might  turn  out,  the
result  should  have  been  shown  him  before  publication.  Possibly
anyone  who  chooses  to  stir  such  a  controversy  in  a  court  cannot
have been very sensitive originally, but that is a consideration for the
jury, which, if ever justiﬁed, is justiﬁed in actions for defamation.

Judgment reversed; cause remanded for trial.

2. Modern Application

BUSCH v. VIACOM INTERNATIONAL
477 F. Supp. 2d 764 (N.D. Tex. 2007)

       , J.

Before  the  court  is  Defendants’  Motion  to  Dismiss.  After  careful
consideration of the motion, response, reply, record, legal brieﬁng and
applicable authority, the court grants Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss.

This  is  an  action  for  defamation  and  misappropriation  of  image.
Pro se Plaintiff Phillip Busch (“Plaintiff” or “Busch”), a bodybuilder who
resides  in  Addison,  Dallas  County,  Texas,  brings  this  action  against
Defendants  Viacom  International  Inc.  (“Viacom”)  and  Jon  Stewart
(“Stewart”),  the  anchor  of  The  Daily  Show  with  Jon  Stewart  (“The
Daily  Show”),  a  nightly  news  satire  that  airs  on  Comedy  Central,
owned  and  operated  by  Viacom.  Plaintiff’s  allegations  arise  from  an
October  2005  broadcast  of  The  Daily  Show,  speciﬁcally  a  satiric
segment involving a “fake endorsement” of a dietary shake promoted
by television evangelist Pat Robertson (“Robertson”). At the end of the
segment, The Daily Show featured a brief replay of an episode of The
700 Club, a talk show hosted by Robertson, which included Plaintiff’s
image.  On  or  about  July  13,  2005,  Plaintiff  had  appeared  as  a  guest
on  The  700  Club,  ﬁlmed  in  Virginia  Beach,  Virginia,  to  discuss  his
weight loss and Robertson’s diet shake following his more than 200-
pound  weight  loss  over  a  15-month  period  where  he  had  used
elements  of  Robertson’s  weight-loss  program  featured  on  The  700
Club,  as  well  as  “Pat’s  Great  Tasting  Diet  Shake,”  a  diet  shake  based
on a recipe developed by Robertson.

included  a  segment
television  commercial

According  to  the  Complaint,  “On  or  about  October  15,  2005,  The
Daily Show  aired  a  fake  endorsement  by  Pat’s  Diet  Shake.  The  fake

end,  a  clip  from  The  700  Club  that  clearly  showed  Pat  Robertson
shaking hands with Mr. Busch and [Robertson] exclaiming ‘thanks for
using the shake!’”

On  February  16,  2006,  Busch  ﬁled  this  lawsuit  in  the  192nd
District  Court  of  Dallas  County,  Texas,  seeking  compensatory  and
punitive damages. Defendants removed the action to this court based
on  diversity  of  citizenship.  On  April  18,  2006,  Defendants  ﬁled  their
motion to dismiss.

[The  court  ﬁrst  granted  Jon  Stewart’s  motion  to  dismiss  for  lack
of  personal  jurisdiction.  Defendant  Viacom  had  not  challenged
jurisdiction  and  the  court  addressed  the  merits  of  its  Rule  12(b)(6)
motion to dismiss the defamation claim.]

A motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Fed. R. Civ. P.
12(b)(6)  “is  viewed  with  disfavor  and  is  rarely  granted.”  Lowrey  v.
Texas  A&M  Univ.  Sys.,  117  F.3d  242,  247  (5th  Cir.  1997).  A  district
court “may dismiss a complaint only if it is clear that no relief could
be  granted  under  any  set  of  facts  that  could  be  proved  consistent
with  the  allegations.”  Swierkiewicz  v.  Sorema,  534  U.S.  506,  514
(2002).

The elements of a cause of action for defamation under Texas law

are that:

1. the challenged broadcast contains assertions of fact about the plaintiff;
2.  the  challenged  assertions  of  fact  are  defamatory,  injuring  the  plaintiff’s

reputation;

3. the challenged assertions of fact are false; and
4. [in cases where the plaintiff is a public ﬁgure, the Constitution demands proof

of “actual malice”].

WFAA-TV,  Inc.  v.  McLemore,  978  S.W.2d  568,  571  (Tex.  1998).  See
generally New York Times v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 279-80 (1964).

In  support  of  its  motion  to  dismiss  Plaintiff’s  defamation  claim,
Viacom  contends  that  Plaintiff’s  defamation  claim  fails  as  to  each
and  every  element  of  Texas  defamation  law.  Speciﬁcally,  Viacom
argues  that:  (1)  the  challenged  broadcast  contains  no  assertions  of
fact  about  Plaintiff;  (2)  the  broadcast  contains  no  defamatory
statements  about  Plaintiff;  (3)  the  broadcast  contains  no  false
statements  about  Plaintiff;  (4)  Plaintiff  has  failed  to  allege  that
Defendants acted with negligence or actual malice regarding the truth
of the broadcast; and (5) the broadcast constitutes parody and satire
fully  protected  by  the  First  Amendment  to  the  United  States
Constitution.

Viewing  all  the  allegations  in  the  complaint  as  true,  and  after
viewing  the  DVD  of  the  challenged  segment,  the  court  determines
that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim for defamation. First, Plaintiff
has  failed  to  allege  that  Viacom  made  any  false  statements  about

image  appears

him. A review of the approximately six-second segment conﬁrms that
Plaintiff  was  never  mentioned  in  the  broadcast  segment,  and  his
appearance  in  the  clip  from  The  700  Club  was  never  identiﬁed.  As
Viacom  correctly  argues,  in  the  challenged  broadcast  it  does  not
make  any  assertions  of  fact,  false  or  otherwise,  concerning  Plaintiff
that  could  even  serve  as  the  basis  for  his  defamation  claim.  See
generally  New  Times,  Inc.  v.  Isaacks,  146  S.W.3d  144,  157  (Tex.
2004)  (publication  must  “be  reasonably  understood  as  describing
actual  facts”  about  the  plaintiff  in  order  to  state  a  claim  for
defamation).  The  court  further  determines  that,  as  a  matter  of  law,
in  a  “fake  endorsement”  of
because  Plaintiff’s
Robertson’s  diet  shake  on  The  Daily  Show,  a  satiric  program,  no
reasonable  viewer  would  have  believed  that  the  challenged  clip
contained  assertions  of  fact  about  Plaintiff.  See  generally  Hustler
Magazine  v.  Falwell,  485  U.S.  46,  53-57  (1988)  (no  liability  where
parody  could  not  reasonably  be  understood  as  describing  actual
facts  about  the  plaintiff);  cf.  Isaacks,  146  S.W.3d  at  157  (the
“appropriate inquiry is objective, not subjective. Thus, the question is
not whether some actual [viewers] were misled, as they inevitably will
be,  but  whether  the  hypothetical  reasonable  [viewer]  could  be”).  In
short, because Plaintiff has failed to allege the ﬁrst element of a claim
for  defamation,  namely,  that  the  challenged  broadcast  contains
assertions  of  fact  about  him,  and  because  no  reasonable  viewer
would  have  believed  that  the  challenged  clip  in  an  October  2005
broadcast of The Daily Show contained assertions of fact about him,
Plaintiff’s  defamation  claim  must  be  dismissed  for  failure  to  state  a
claim.  Moreover,  the  Complaint  contains  no  factual  allegations  from
which the court could reasonably infer that the challenged broadcast
contains defamatory statements about Plaintiff.

For  the  reasons  set  forth  above,  the  court  grants  Defendants’

Motion to Dismiss.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Defamatory  Statements.   In  Burton,  Judge  Learned  Hand  was
willing to recognize a claim for defamation even in the absence of any
factual  assertions  regarding  the  jockey.  The  court  believed  that
because the advertisement’s photo made a caricature of the plaintiff,
causing him to be the subject of ridicule and contempt, the publisher
was  liable  for  defamation.  Most  courts  today  would  not  share  this
view. In Busch, the court refused to recognize a defamation claim, in
part,  because  the  satirical  television  episode  made  no  factual
assertions  regarding  the  plaintiff.  The  court  further  held  that  parody
and satire were not grounds for defamation. While courts do deﬁne a
defamatory  statement  as  one  that  tends  to  expose  the  plaintiff  to
“hatred,  contempt,  or  aversion,”  to  be  actionable  this  must  be
accomplished through the utterance of factual information about the
plaintiff that is false.

2.  Concerning  the  Plaintiff.   Unless  the  defamatory  statement
would  be  understood  by  the  reasonable  listener  to  pertain  to  the
plaintiff, the plaintiff has no cause of action. This does not mean that
the defendant only faces liability, however, when he explicitly uses the
plaintiff’s name in making the defamatory statement. Under the right
circumstances,  the  reasonable  listener  might  have  no  problem
understanding  that  the  statement  is  about  the  plaintiff  despite  the
plaintiff’s name never being uttered. If someone stands in front of the
plaintiff’s house holding a placard falsely declaring that “the occupant
of  this  house  is  a  pedophile,”  anyone  seeing  the  sign  who  can  later
ﬁgure  out  who  lives  in  the  house  has  been  the  recipient  of  a
defamatory publication concerning the plaintiff.

3.  Truth  or  Falsity.   Under  the  common  law,  states  have  taken
different positions on whether the plaintiff must prove the defamatory
statement’s  falsity  as  an  element  of  her  claim  or  whether  the
defendant  is  instead  relegated  to  pleading  and  proving  truth  as  an
afﬁrmative  defense.  In  many  instances  this  may  not  be  critical

because, whether considered an element of the claim or a defense, if
the jury ﬁnds the statement to be true all modern courts agree that no
liability  can  attach  for  defamation.  Where  the  evidence  is  equivocal
on the issue of truthfulness, of course, who bears the burden of proof
might  be  critically  important.  Further,  in  jurisdictions  where  truth  is
considered an afﬁrmative defense, the defendant has an obligation to
plead truth or else waives the defense.

4.  Consent.   As  with  many  other  tort  claims,  consent  can  be  an
afﬁrmative defense to a defamation claim. This is rarely invoked as a
successful  defense,  however,  because  the  circumstances  of  the
defendant  falsely  uttering  defamatory  statements  concerning  a
plaintiff are usually not invited. In Burton, the defendant raised this as
a  defense  to  the  print  advertisement  because  the  plaintiff  had
willingly permitted his name and appearance to be used. Yet the court
held  that  consent  was  not  available  because  the  facts  did  not  show
that  the  plaintiff  was  aware  of  how  he  would  be  depicted  when  he
gave his consent.

HENDERSON v. HENDERSON
1996 LEXIS 60 (R.I. Super. 1996)

        , J.

On July 3, 1996 and July 5, 1996, an evidentiary hearing was held
before this Court regarding Brian R. Henderson’s (defendant) motion
to strike Susan R. Henderson’s (plaintiff) claim for punitive damages.

The  plaintiff  is  the  ex-wife  of  the  defendant.  The  parties  were
married in 1967 and had two children, Jill Henderson (daughter) and
Brett  Henderson  (son),  both  of  whom  are  now  adults.  The  parties
subsequently  separated  on  October  28,  1989,  and  were  ofﬁcially
divorced on May 15, 1991.

After  the  parties  were  separated  in  October  1989,  the  defendant
began to send a steady stream of correspondences to the plaintiff at
her sister Sarah Mancini’s residence, where she was living at the time,
and
later  to  a  home  she  shared  with  their  daughter.  These
correspondences  were  addressed  to  the  plaintiff,  referring  to  her  as
“wacco”  and  “Sue  T.  Whore”  on  the  envelope.  The  defendant  also
wrote numerous letters and correspondences to the parties’ daughter
referring  to  the  plaintiff  as  “wacco”  and  “the  whore.”  Additionally,  the
defendant sent copies of a letter to the plaintiff’s father and her sister
referring to the plaintiff as “Sue the whore,” and copies of other letters
to  the  plaintiff’s  father  and  stepmother  claiming  the  plaintiff  had
mental  problems.  Moreover,  the  defendant  initialized  checks  that
were sent to the plaintiff, that allegedly had obscene connotations.

On  September  22,  1992,  the  plaintiff  ﬁled  suit  against  the
defendant accusing him of defamation. On June 5, 1996, the plaintiff
made  a  motion  for  an  order  permitting  discovery  on  the  issue  of
punitive damages. The defendant responded by moving to strike the
plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages. An evidentiary hearing was held
before this court on the motion to strike.

The  standard  in  Rhode  Island  for  imposing  punitive  damages  is
rigorous and will be satisﬁed only in instances wherein a defendant’s
conduct  required  deterrence  and  punishment  over  and  above  that
provided in an award of compensatory damages. [A] showing that the
defendant  acted  with  malice  or  in  bad  faith  must  be  made  for  the
Court to award punitive damages.

In Rhode Island, an action for defamation requires proof of

(a) a false and defamatory statement concerning another;
(b) an unprivileged communication to a third party;
(c) fault amounting at least to negligence on the part of the publisher; and
(d) damages.

Lyons v. R.I. Public Employees Council 94, 516 A.2d 1339, 1342 (R.I.
1986). Restatement (Second) Torts §558 (1977). “Any words, if false

and  malicious,  imputing  conduct  which  injuriously  affects  a  man’s
reputation, or which tends to degrade him in society or bring him into
public  hatred  and  contempt  are  in  their  nature  defamatory.”  Elias  v.
Youngken, 493 A.2d 158, 161 (R.I. 1985).

On  the  evidence  before  it,  this  Court  concludes  that  the  plaintiff
has  made  a  prima  facie  showing  that  defendant’s  statements  are
defamatory.  The  plaintiff  has  shown  that  the  defendant’s  numerous
references  to  the  plaintiff  as  being  mentally  unstable  and  a  “whore”
are  false  and  defamatory  statements.  There
is  no  competent
evidence  in  the  record  that  these  statements  are  true.  This  Court  is
also  of  the  opinion  that  the  initials  the  defendant  placed  on  checks
made  out  to  the  plaintiff,  would  be  found  not  only  to  be  false  and
defamatory but possibly obscene. These statements and terms were
published  on  envelopes,  letters,  checks  and  postcards  that  were
communicated  to  third  parties,  including  the  parties’  daughter  and
the  plaintiff’s  sister  who  testiﬁed  to  this  at  the  hearing.  Additionally,
the  evidence  indicates  that  there  was  fault  amounting  at  least  to
negligence on the part of the defendant, and that the plaintiff suffered
damages. The statements made about the plaintiff clearly impute the
kind of conduct which injuriously affects a person’s reputation.

A statement is defamatory “if it
tends to expose a person to
hatred, contempt or aversion, or
to induce an evil or unsavory
opinion of him in the minds of a
substantial number of the
community.”

Mencher v. Chelsey, 297
N.Y. 94, 100 (1947).

The plaintiff argues that the
weight  of
testimonial
the
evidence  of  the  plaintiff,  the
the
parties’  daughter  and
plaintiff’s  sister,  as  well  as  the
introduced,  answers
exhibits
by  the  defendant  to  requests
for
the
and
the  deposition
portions  of
transcript  read  into  the  record,
more  than  demonstrate  facts
sufﬁcient  to  establish  a  prima
facie  showing  of  egregious

admissions,

conduct  to  warrant  the  imposition  of  punitive  damages.  This  Court
agrees.

This  Court  believes  that  a  prima  facie  showing  has  been  made
that  defendant’s  actions  arose  from  spite  or  ill  will,  with  willful  and
wanton disregard of the rights and interest of the plaintiff. This Court
is  also  of  the  opinion  that  the  competent  evidence  of  record  could
support  a  ﬁnding  that  the  defendant’s  statements  were  published
with  such  malice  and  wickedness  that  they  rise  to  the  level  of
requiring  punishment  over  and  above  that  provided  in  an  award  of
compensatory damages.

The defendant refers this Court to Johnson v. Johnson, 654 A.2d
1212 (R.I. 1995), a Rhode Island case in which punitive damages were
denied when an ex-husband called his ex-wife a “whore.” However, in
this Court’s opinion, the Johnson case is entirely different from than
the present matter. In Johnson, unlike here, the trial justice found that
the  ex-husband’s  statements  were  essentially  truthful.  Furthermore,
the  defamatory  statements  in  Johnson  consisted  of  one  incident,
while  here  the  defamatory  statements  occurred  continuously  over  a
period  of  almost  three  years,  even  after  the  plaintiff  had  initially
brought this defamation suit.

This Court concludes that there are adequate facts to support an
award  of  punitive  damages  in  this  case.  This  Court  holds  that  the
plaintiff established in the evidentiary hearing that a prima facie case
for  punitive  damages  exists.  Accordingly,  the  defendant’s  motion  to
strike is denied, and the plaintiff may conduct discovery on the issue
of punitive damages.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Elements Applied.  Using the Henderson court’s recitation of the
elements of defamation, can you explain why the court believed that
the  plaintiff  might  have  a  good  case  for  defamation  on  the  facts  of

the  case?  In  connection  with  that,  is  it  clear  that  the  defendant  was
asserting any statements of fact concerning the plaintiff?

2.  Publication.   Defamation  requires  proof  that  the  defendant
“published”  the  defamatory  statements  to  a  third  party.  Publication
should  be  understood  in  its  broadest  sense,  however,  as  any
utterance made to another or any written statement shown to a third
party constitute publications. Publication of a defamatory statement
solely  to  the  plaintiff  does  not  give  rise  to  a  defamation  claim
because it would not taint the plaintiff’s reputation. Hurt feelings, on
their own, do not give rise to a claim for defamation. Further, the self-
publication  rule  holds  that  a  plaintiff’s  own  repetition  of  the
defamatory  speech  to  third  parties  cannot  create  a  claim  for
defamation.  For  example,  if  John  tells  Paula  that  she  is  a  thief,  and
Paula then says to her friends, “Can you believe that John called me a
thief?,”  this  would  not  make  John  liable  for  defamation.  John  would
only be liable if he uttered the accusation himself to the friends. Most
courts have held that a publication to a third party has occurred if the
defendant  makes  the  statement  either  intending  for  third  parties  to
hear it or when it would be reasonably foreseeable that third parties
would hear (or see) the defamatory statement.

3. Republication.   Under  the  common  law,  someone  who  repeats
or “republishes” a defamatory statement may be just as liable to the
plaintiff  as  the  original  publisher.  Someone  hearing  as  gossip  a
defamatory statement concerning the plaintiff and deciding to share
this  gossip  with  others  is  liable  for  defamation,  in  addition  to  the
person  who  ﬁrst  started  the  gossip.  In  the  section  on  constitutional
privileges  later  in  this  chapter,  we  will  see  an  example  of  this  in
Khawar v. Globe International, Inc., where the defendant published a
included  some
written  report  of  a  book  that  had  previously
defamatory  statements  regarding  the  plaintiff.  While  the  report  was
accurate, it repeated the defamatory statements and created liability
for the paper’s publisher.

4.  Fault.   At  common  law,  defamation  was  considered  a  strict
liability tort in the sense that plaintiffs were not required to prove that
the defendant uttered the defamatory statement with any knowledge
of  its  falsity.  If  the  factﬁnder  found  the  statement  untrue  (and
defamatory) the defendant was liable no matter how much good faith
he  possessed  when  making  the  statement.  In  the  subsection  on
privileges, we will encounter courts demanding some proof of fault in
law,  statutory,  or
various  situations  where  either  common
constitutional  privileges  might  otherwise  protect  the  publisher  from
liability.  For  now,  understand  that,  historically,  no  evidence  of  fault
was necessary, but that in many modern applications of this cause of
action the law might now demand some type of fault be proven.

5. Damages.   In  Henderson,  the  court  lists  proof  of  damages  as
one  of  the  elements  of  a  claim  for  defamation.  In  cases  where  the
defamatory  speech  has  resulted  in  special  economic  losses  (e.g.,  a
loss of a job) all courts recognize a right to recover such damages. In
some  situations,  however,  courts  are  willing  to  permit  a  recovery  of
actual  “presumed”  damages  to  one’s  reputation  even  without  any
proof of such reputational injury. This issue is at the very heart of the
parties’ dispute in the Agriss case in the next subsection.

6.  Punitive  Damage  Submission.   As  we  learned  in  Chapter  8,
Damages, punitive damages require not only the commission of a tort
but  aggravating  circumstances,  such  as  the  defendant  acting  with
“malice”  or  “gross  negligence.”  Defamation  claims  often  include
claims for punitive damages when the plaintiff can demonstrate that
the defendant’s utterance of the false speech was motivated by ill will
toward  the  plaintiff  or  resulted  from  a  grossly  negligent  lack  of
concern for the truthfulness of the statement. In the Henderson case,
the  court  found  that  the  facts  warranted  permitting  the  plaintiff  to
attempt to persuade the jury that punitive damages were appropriate
in light of the evidence of the former husband’s multiple utterances of
obviously false and defamatory statements about the plaintiff to her
relatives.

7. Distinguished from Other Related Causes of Action.  Defamation,
as a tort cause of action, is a much older and well-established relative
of  another  group  of  torts  arising  under  the  concept  of  a  right  to
privacy.  These  other  legal  cousins  of  defamation  include  such  tort
claims  as  (1)  false  light,  (2)  publication  of  private  facts,  (3)  intrusion
into another’s private affairs, and (4) misappropriation of one’s name
or  likeness.  Each  of  these  four  claims  is  understood  to  arise  out  of
concern for individuals’ right of privacy — the right to be left alone. A
false  light  claim  might  exist  if  the  defendant  announced  false
information  about  the  plaintiff.  Technically,  such  a  claim  can  exist
even  if  the  false  information  does  not  rise  to  the  level  of  being
defamatory.  Not  all  jurisdictions  recognize  a  claim  for  false  light.
Publication of private facts may create liability when someone reveals
private  information  about  the  plaintiff  to  the  public.  Liability  exists
here,  even  if  the  information  is  true,  if  the  court  determines  that  the
public  did  not  have  a  legitimate  need  to  be  aware  of  such  private
facts.  A  claim  for  intruding  into  another’s  private  affairs  has  been
recognized  by  some  courts  for  conduct  such  as  spying  on  the
plaintiff. Finally, if a defendant utilizes the plaintiff’s name or likeness
for commercial exploitation, courts have recognized a cause of action
so  long  as  the  plaintiff  has  not  consented  to  the  use  and  the
defendant  was  capitalizing  on  the  name  or  likeness  rather  than
reporting  on  some  newsworthy  event  or  engaged  in  some  other
protected  use  (e.g.,  parody,  satire,  political  commentary,  etc.).
Defamation  claims,  while  conceivably  capable  of  arising  in  similar
scenarios,  can  be  distinguished  from  these  claims  as  they  involve  a
right to have one’s reputation not falsely disparaged, and not a mere
right  to  be  left  alone.  It  is  also  worth  noting  that,  in  the  business
world,  additional  related  common  law  tort  claims  that  many  courts
have  recognized
include  (a)  business  disparagement  and  (b)
commercial  defamation.  Business  disparagement  applies  when  the
defendant  makes  false  factual  assertions  regarding  the  plaintiff’s
business  products  and  this  causes  ﬁnancial  harm.  Commercial

defamation  applies  when  a  corporate  entity  is  the  subject  of  false
reports concerning either its ﬁnancial health or business ethics — but
does not arise if the statement concerns any other topic.

8.  Problems.   With  each  of  the  elements  of  defamation  in  mind,
consider  whether  a  defamation  claim  should  be  recognized  in  the
following scenarios:

A. While sitting in the staff cafeteria at work, Elaine tells co-workers

that their boss, Mr. Peterman, is a “jerk.”

B. George steals a loaf of bread from the parents of his girlfriend.
When  confronted  by  her  parents  on  the  front  steps  of  their
Manhattan  apartment,  George  points  to  a  teenager  running
down the street and shouts “He’s the one!”

C. Jerry is having dinner with his friend Kramer at a diner. In a voice
loud enough that it could be heard at the next table, Jerry says
“Chef  Poppy  at  this  restaurant  did  not  wash  his  hands  after
using  the  bathroom.”  The  nearby  diners  are  horriﬁed  and  leave
the  diner  immediately.  As  it  turns  out,  Poppy  had  only  been  in
the bathroom to comb his hair.

D.  Newman  brags  to  Kramer  about  the  beautiful  model  he  had  a
ﬁrst  date  with  the  night  before.  When  Kramer  asks  if  Newman
“got  lucky,”  Newman  just  smiles  a  very  broad  smile.  Of  course,
this only occurred in Newman’s dreams.

E. Jerry’s father, Morty, is running for election to be the president of
his  condominium  association.  When  asked  about  his  opponent
during a candidate debate, Morty says, “He’s a Republican!” The
opponent  has  never  once  voted  for  a  Republican  presidential
candidate.

B. Libel vs. Slander

As  mentioned  at  the  outset  of  this  chapter,  the  law  of  defamation
involves claims for libel and claims for slander. In many respects the

two  claims  look  almost  identical — up  until  now  we  have  made  no
distinction  between  the  two.  But
in  some  circumstances,  the
difference  between  libel  and  slander  can  be  outcome  determinative.
In  the  following  case,  the  court  gives  an  excellent  historical
recapitulation  of  the  two  tort  claims  and  clariﬁes  the  obscurity
concerning when the characterization of a defamation claim as libel
or slander makes a difference and when it does not. As you read the
following  opinion,  pay  close  attention  to  the  two  mistakes  made  by
the trial court — one involving the application of law to the facts of the
case and the other involving the purely legal distinction between libel
and slander.

AGRISS v. ROADWAY EXPRESS, INC.
483 A.2d 456 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1984)

       , J.

The  security  of  his  reputation  or  good  name  from  the  arts  of  detraction  and
slander, are rights to which every man is entitled by reason and natural justice;
since without these, it is impossible to have the perfect enjoyment of any other
advantage or right.

1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries 134.

Appellant  William  Agriss  sued  his  employer,  Roadway  Express,
Inc., for what he considered a slight to his good name. A jury trial was
held  in  the  Monroe  County  Court  of  Common  Pleas.  After  appellant
had presented his evidence the court entered a nonsuit. This appeal
followed.

Appellant had been employed by Roadway Express since 1976 as
a truck driver. In February 1979 he was elected as a shop steward for
Teamsters  Local  229,  the  union  representing  Roadway  employees
based at Roadway’s facility in Tannersville, Pennsylvania.

On  December  21,  1979,  Agriss  returned  from  a  round  trip  to
Hartford, Connecticut, and entered the Tannersville terminal. He was
scheduled to begin his vacation that day, and went to the dispatcher’s
window  to  collect  his  vacation  paycheck.  The  dispatcher  told  Agriss
to  see  the  driver  foreman,  Steve  Versuk,  before  leaving.  Versuk
handed  Agriss  a  company  “warning  letter,”  signed  by  Versuk  and
initialed by Roadway relay manager Joe Moran. The letter read:

By  reason  of  your  conduct  as  described  below,  it  is  necessary  to  issue  this
notice  of  warning.  On  12/21/79  at  Tannersville,  Pennsylvania  you  violated  our
policy  (or  contract)  by  opening  company  mail.  Subsequent  violations  of  any
company policy or contract will result in your receiving more severe disciplinary
action  up  to  and  including  discharge  in  accordance  with  Article  44  of  the
Central Pa. Over-the-road and Local Cartage Supplemental Agreement.

The accusation in the letter was false, as Agriss had never, on that or
any other day, opened company mail.

Agriss  immediately  took  the  letter  to  Joe  Moran  and  denied  the
charge.  Moran  refused  to  withdraw  the  warning.  Agriss  then  wrote
out and presented to Moran a formal protest, which Moran rejected.
Under  the  contractual  grievance  procedure  between  Roadway  and
the Teamsters, such a protest was the only remedial step open to an
employee receiving a warning letter.

Shortly  thereafter,  Agriss  flew  with  his  girlfriend  to  Hawaii  to
spend  the  holidays.  While  Agriss  was  in  Hawaii,  Roadway  driver
Joseph  Verdier  heard  stories  about  the  warning  circulating  in  the
drivers’ room at the Tannersville terminal. He heard other drivers and
a  Roadway  dispatcher  saying  that  Agriss  was  going  to  be  ﬁred  for
looking into company mail.

When Agriss returned to work on the 7th or 8th of January, 1980,
several drivers asked him about the warning letter, and he heard the
charge  against  him  bandied  over  the  CB  radio.  Aside  from  Versuk,
Moran,  and  Brophy,  Agriss  had  mentioned  the  charge  only  to  his
girlfriend.

Over  the  next  year  Agriss  continued  to  receive  comments  and
questions about the warning letter from Roadway workers and union
ofﬁcials.  Agriss  instituted  this  suit,  claiming  that  Roadway  had
defamed  him.  Trial  began  on  January  23,  1981.  After  the  plaintiff
rested  his  case,  the  court  granted  the  defendant’s  motion  for
compulsory nonsuit, ruling that the plaintiff’s evidence failed to prove
a cause of action for defamation.

The threshold question in an action for defamation is whether the
communication at issue is capable of a defamatory meaning. It is for
the  court  in  the  ﬁrst  instance  to  make  this  determination;  but  if  the
communication could be understood as defamatory then it is for the
jury to determine whether it was so understood by the recipient.

A  publication  is  defamatory  if  it  tends  to  blacken  a  person’s
reputation  or  expose  him  to  public  hatred,  contempt,  or  ridicule,  or
injure  him  in  his  business  or  profession.  The  court  should  read  an
allegedly  libelous  statement  in  context.  The  nature  of  the  audience
seeing  or  hearing  the  remarks  is  also  a  critical  factor  in  assessing
whether a communication is capable of a defamatory meaning.

With these principles in mind we turn to the parties’ arguments on

the defamatory character of the charge “opening company mail.”

to  him  at

least  dishonesty,

Appellant contends that the words could have been understood to
impute
integrity,  and
untrustworthiness,  and  at  worst  the  crime  of  illegally  opening
another’s United States mail. He argues that the charge therefore had
the  potential  to  damage  his  reputation  among  fellow  workers,
especially  in  his  capacity  as  a  union  ofﬁcial  entrusted  with  handling
employee grievances against the company.

lack  of

For its part appellee argues that, “Taken at its worst, the warning
issued in this case implies that Agriss is nosey or is eavesdropping on
company affairs. There is no accusation of crime [and that the words]
were  not  calculated  to  demean  Agriss;  they  were  intended  to
communicate to him a warning not to violate company policy.”

Appellant  proved,  for  purposes  of  overcoming  a  motion  for
nonsuit,  that  when  he  returned  from  his  vacation  speculation  was
rampant  among  his  fellow  employees  and  union  men  about  what
exactly  he  had  done  and  whether  he  would  be  discharged  for  it.
Obviously  the  charge  of  “opening  company  mail”  implied  more  to
some  people  than  that  he  had  received  a  benign  reprimand.  For  a
Roadway  employee  to  be  charged  with  opening  company  mail  was
highly  uncommon.  Appellant  testiﬁed  that  in  all  his  time  as  a  union
steward, during which he had dealt with “thousands” of grievances, he
had never heard of an employee’s being warned or cited for opening
company  mail.  Moreover,  the  speciﬁc  misconduct  alleged — opening
mail he had no right to open — reasonably could be interpreted to call
in  question  appellant’s  general  character  for  honesty,  integrity,  or
trustworthiness.  In  fact,  appellant  testiﬁed  that  the  accusation
prompted people to ask him what he was accused of stealing. Giving
appellant the beneﬁt of inferences to which he is entitled, the charge
“opening company mail”  was  capable  of  impugning  appellant’s  good
name or reputation in the popular sense, and these are the interests
that defamation law seeks to protect.

[The court agreed with appellant that the evidence was sufﬁcient
to permit a jury to ﬁnd that the Roadway employees were responsible
for  publishing  the  defamatory  statements  contained  in  the  letter  by
showing it to third parties who had no business seeing the letter.]

We have touched on the newest constitutional frontiers of the law
of defamation, and now must backtrack to its oldest shibboleths. The
trial court held that the charge “opening company mail” was not “libel
per se,” and that because it was not the plaintiff was obliged to prove
special  damages  in  order  to  recover.  Appellant  proved  no  special
damages; thus the court’s fourth ground for entering nonsuit.

Appellant  quarrels  mainly  with  the  trial  court’s  holding  that  the
words  “opening  company  mail”  were  not  “libel  per  se.”  However,  we
are  concerned  also  with  what  the  court  meant  by  “libel  per  se,”  and
with the rule it applied upon determining that the words complained

of in this case were not “libel per se.” Implicit in the court’s decision to
grant  nonsuit  is  a  distinction  between  “libel  per  se”  and  “libel  per
quod,” and between different burdens of proof which these two forms
of  libel  are  thought  to  require.  We  have  come  to  the  conclusion  that
the “per se/per quod” distinction is without validity in the modern law
of  libel,  and  should  be  abolished  as  a  means  of  allocating  the
plaintiff’s  burden  of  proof  in  a  libel  case.  We  also  conclude  that  the
trial court erred in nonsuiting appellant on the grounds of a rule based
on the “libel per se” concept. However, our task of correcting the error
is difﬁcult because the very meaning of “libel per se,” let alone its legal
signiﬁcance, is an enigma in this jurisdiction.

Principles

The history of libel and slander
illustrates “a perversion of
evolutionary processes”
resulting in “a rather
heterogeneous pile which
should normally have gone to
form a consistent body of legal
doctrine, but which on the
contrary, comprises many
disconnected fragments moving
in a confused way under the
impulse of different principles.”

It is time to exert state court control over the “per se” concept, if
only because it is primarily our responsibility, not the federal courts’,
to  say  what  a  plaintiff  in  defamation  must  plead  and  prove  under
Pennsylvania  law.  Here  the  plaintiff  was  thrown  out  of  court  on  the
ground  that  the  libel  he  complained  of  was  not  “libel  per  se.”  To
discharge our duty to pass on the propriety of the trial court’s ruling,
we must pull “libel per se” up by the roots and examine it. We cannot
dispel completely the confusion that has been accreting for decades,
but  we  can  separate  terminological  chaff  from  kernels  of  legal
principle.

The  difﬁculty  the  courts  have  had  with  “per  se”  springs  directly
from the historical distinction between libel and slander. Before going
further,  we  should  make  that  distinction.  Libel  may  be  deﬁned
conveniently as “A method of defamation expressed by print, writing,
pictures, or signs.” Black’s Law Dictionary 824 (5th ed. 1979). Slander,
broadly, is usually understood to mean oral defamation.6

“Per  se”  ﬁrst  cropped  up  in  defamation  law  in  connection  with
slander. At early common law a person generally could not recover for
slanderous  utterances  unless  they  caused  him  “special  harm,”
meaning

harm  of  a  material  and  generally  of  a  pecuniary  nature  .  .  .  result[ing]  from
conduct of a person other than the defamer or the one defamed which conduct
is  itself  the  result  of  the  publication  or  repetition  of  the  slander.  Loss  of
reputation  to  the  person  defamed  is  not  sufﬁcient  to  make  the  defamer  liable
under the rule . . . unless it is reflected in material harm.

Restatement  of  Torts  §575,  Comment  b  (1938).  The  common  law
courts’  insistence  that  a  plaintiff  in  slander  prove  “material  harm”  in
turn  “goes  back  to  the  ancient  conflict  of  jurisdiction  between  the
royal  and  ecclesiastical  courts,
in  which  the  former  acquired
jurisdiction  over  some  kinds  of  defamation  only  because  they  could
be found to have resulted in ‘temporal’ rather than ‘spiritual’ damage.”
Restatement (Second) of Torts §575, Comment b (1977).

Early exceptions to the requirement of proving special harm were
carved
loathsome  disease,
shortcomings affecting the plaintiff in his business, trade, profession,
or  calling,  or  (later)  unchastity  to  a  woman.  Prosser,  supra,  §112  at
754; 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries 123-24. These “per se” slanders
were  supposed  to  be  so  naturally  injurious  that  the  law  allowed
recovery of general or presumed damages for loss of reputation, even
without proof of actual injury.

“Per se” and its counterpart “per quod” were common law pleading
devices  used  to  indicate  whether  the  plaintiff’s  cause  of  action
depended  on  general  or  special  damages.  Francis  Murnaghan,  in
From Figment to Fiction to Philosophy — the Requirement of Proof of
Damages in Libel Actions, 22 Cath. U. L. Rev. 1, 13 (1972), explains:

In common law pleading, the right to recover general damages meant that the
portion of the writ employed for institution of the suit devoted to speciﬁcation of
damage,  and  introduced  by  the  words  “per  quod,”  became  inapplicable
whenever  damages  were  presumed.  To  ﬁll  the  void,  and  to  signify  that
something had not been overlooked, the draftsmen in such cases would simply
insert  “per  se”  where  the  allegations  of  damages,  headed  by  the  phrase  ‘per
quod’ otherwise would be expected.

We are told that the substantive
differences between the law of
libel and the law of slander are
relics of the ancient past serving
no useful purpose, but to this
day they wield dead-hand
influence over the law of
defamation.

The  per  se/per  quod  distinction  in  libel  originated  differently.  It
was  used  to  distinguish  libel  defamatory  on  its  face  (“libel  per  se”)
from libel not defamatory on its face (“libel per quod”). “Libel per quod”

imparting  defamatory  meaning,  and

“inducement”)

Originally,  the  per  se/per  quod  distinction  in  slander,  by  which
some  slanders  were  actionable  without  proof  of  special  damages
while  others  were  not,  had  no  parallel  application  to  libel.  Any  libel,
whether  libelous  on  its  face  or  libelous  only  upon  proof  of  extrinsic
circumstances,  was  actionable  with  or  without  proof  of  special
damages.  The  willingness  of  the  law  to  presume  damages  for  all
libels  as  opposed  to  all  slanders  arose  partly  from  the  greater
permanency,  dissemination,  and  credence,  and  hence  the  greater
harm, supposed naturally to attend defamations in printed or written
form.

Inevitably, use of the identical per se/per quod terminology in two
torts so similar in nature led to the distinct rules for libel and slander
being blurred and melded together in the courts. The rule of slander
per  quod,  requiring  proof  of  special  damages  for  any  slander  not
coming  under  one  of  the  four  time-honored  exceptions,  came  to  be
applied to “libel per quod” (i.e., libel not defamatory on its face). Under
this  “hybrid”  rule  of  libel  per  quod,  a  libel  not  defamatory  on  its  face
was not actionable without proof of special harm. As a further twist
to  the  hybrid  scheme,  a  libelous  imputation  of  crime,  loathsome
disease,  unﬁtness  for  business  or  calling,  or  unchastity  (the  four
imputations actionable without proof of special harm in slander) was

held to be actionable without proof of special harm in libel, even if the
libel were “per quod” (proven libelous through extrinsic facts).

The trial court en banc evidently applied this hybrid rule of libel per
quod. It found appellant’s evidence deﬁcient for failure to show either
“libel per se” or special harm. We agree that appellant’s case did not
establish  that  he  suffered  any  economic  or  material  loss  amounting
to  “special  harm.”  On  the  other  hand,  we  believe  that  the  words
“opening  company  mail”  did  not  require  such  proof  of  special
damages  under  the  hybrid  rule  because  the  charge  imputed  to
appellant  unﬁtness  for  business  or  calling  and,  arguably,  criminal
activity.  We  would,  therefore,  ﬁnd  that  the  trial  court  erroneously
applied the hybrid rule to the facts of this case. However, we would be
shirking  our  responsibility  as  an  appellate  court  if  we  did  not  decide
also whether the hybrid rule was the correct one to apply in the ﬁrst
place.

Although  Prosser  believed  the  hybrid  rule  of  libel  per  quod  to  be
the  majority  rule  in  America,  the  American  Law  Institute,  in  both  the
First and Second Restatements of Torts, consistently has adhered to
the traditional rule that all libels are actionable “per se,” irrespective of
special  harm.  Restatement  of  Torts  §569;  Restatement  (Second)  of
Torts §569. The Institute views Prosser’s hybrid rule as the “minority
position.” See Restatement (Second) of Torts §569, Comment b.

[T]here are sound policy reasons for allowing a plaintiff to recover
for any libel even where he cannot prove special harm in the form of
direct economic or pecuniary injury. As Justice Eagen said in Gætano
v. Sharon Herald Co., supra note 8, 426 Pa. at 183, 231 A.2d at 755,

The most important function of an action for defamation is to give the innocent
and injured plaintiff a public vindication of his good name. Its primary purpose
is to restore his unjustly tarnished reputation, and “reputation is the estimation
in which one’s character is held by his neighbors or associates.” Restatement,
Torts §577, comment b (1938).

By  its  very  nature,  injury  to  reputation  does  not  work  its  greatest
mischief in the form of monetary loss.

Where  an  individual  is  made  the  victim  of  a  false,  malicious,  and
defamatory  libel  published  to  third  persons,  it  is  unfair  to  hold  that
vindication of his good name in the courts depends upon proof that
the injury to his reputation has injured him economically as well. Once
reputational  damage  alone  is  proven,  the  plaintiff  in  libel  has  proven
his entitlement to recovery, and to make that recovery contingent on
whether  the  damage  was  done  by  words  “defamatory  on  their  face”
merely adds another irrelevant factor to the equation.

By its very nature, injury to
reputation does not work its
greatest mischief in the form of
monetary loss.

The  perceived  requirement
of  “special  damages”  has  been
interpreted  by  trial
narrowly
courts  in  Pennsylvania.  It  is
seen as a complete bar to relief
in  defamation  if  the  plaintiff
fails  to  prove  that  reputational
injury  has  caused  concrete
economic loss computable in dollars. These cases are disapproved to
the extent they conflict with the rule we announce today: a plaintiff in
libel in Pennsylvania need not prove special damages or harm in order
to recover; he may recover for any injury done his reputation and for
any other injury of which the libel is the legal cause. See Restatement
(Second),  supra,  §621  &  Comments.  Courts  in  libel  cases  should  be
guided  by  the  same  general  rules  regarding  damages  that  govern
other types of tort recovery.

The  order  of  the  court  en  banc  refusing  to  take  off  nonsuit  is
reversed;  appellant  to  receive  a  new  trial  in  accordance  with  this
opinion; jurisdiction relinquished.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  When  Does  the  Distinction  Matter?   According  to  the  Agriss
court  in  its  rejection  of  the  hybrid  rule,  all  claims  for  libel  permit
recovery for both general, presumed reputational injury, as well as for
special  damages  in  the  form  of  economic  losses  (if  any)  caused  by
the libelous statement. Furthermore, claims for slander per se receive
equal  treatment.  Only  claims  for  slander  per  quod — slander  that  is
defamatory but not involving any of the four most serious categories
— limit recovery to economic losses. What is the justiﬁcation for not
recognizing  slander  per  quod  claims  in  the  absence  of  economic
injury?

2.  Distinguishing  Libel  from  Slander.   The  Agriss  court  quotes
Black’s Law Dictionary’s deﬁnition for libel as “defamation expressed
by print, writing, pictures, or signs.” By contrast, slander is typically in
the form of oral utterances or bodily gestures. Because libel involves
a more permanent and arguably more damaging form of defamation
than  slander,  it  has  generally  been  considered  the  more  serious
infringement.  It  was  for  this  reason  that  historically  all  libel  claims
permitted  recovery  of  general  presumed  damages.  In  cases  where
the  libel  versus  slander  distinction  matters,  courts  have  had  to
grapple  with  applying  these  historic  categories  to  modern  forms  of
communication,  such  as  defamatory  utterances  made  on  the
Internet,  television,  and  radio  broadcasts.  While  not  unanimous,  the
trend has been to treat defamation appearing in these forms of media
as libel, which is arguably appropriate given the power, permanence,
and  ability  to  spread  the  injurious  defamation  contained  in  these
forms  of  communication.  Some  courts  have  distinguished,  however,
between utterances made on radio and television that were read from
a  written  script  and  utterances  made  without  such  a  script — only
ﬁnding  the  former  to  be  libel  and  the  latter  slander.  Yet  the
Restatement  supports  the  majority  approach:  “Broadcasting  of
defamatory matter by means of radio or television is libel, whether or
not  it  is  read  from  a  manuscript.”  Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts
§568A (1965)

3.  Special  and  General  Damages.   In  Chapter  8,  Damages,  we
explored  the  two  branches  of  actual  compensatory  damages —
general  damages  and  special  damages.  Defamation  law  recognizes
these  same  two  categories.  Every  type  of  defamation  suit  permits
recovery of special damages. These are for economic losses caused
lost  business
by  the  defamatory  statements — for
opportunities, loss of contractual relationships, and any other out-of-
pocket  losses  incurred  by  the  plaintiff.  When  general  reputational
damages  are  available,  courts  permit  the  jury  great  latitude  in
assessing the amount once it is clear that some injury to reputation
has  occurred.  Proof  of  the  publication  of  defamatory  statements
concerning  the  plaintiff  permits  a  presumption  of  the  existence  of
general  damages.  Many  other  circumstances  might  impact  the
amount  of  general  damages  a  jury  might  award  for  such  presumed
injuries, including matters such as the plaintiff’s prior reputation in the
community, the nature of the defamatory utterances, how widespread
the publication of the statements was, whether the audience for the
publication tended to believe the publication’s truth, and whether the
plaintiff  was  able  to  redeem  her  reputation  through  any  mitigating
acts or communications.

4.  Single-Publication  Rule.   Most  states  have  adopted  a  single-
publication rule  in  defamation  actions,  holding  that  the  defendant’s
singular  publication  gives  rise  to  one  defamation  claim  no  matter
how  many  people  view  the  publication  and  regardless  of  when  they
view the publication. Thus, a defendant’s publication of one edition of
a book can give rise to only one claim against that defendant rather
than a separate suit arising each time another person reads the book.
This  prevents  defendants  from  repeated  suits  over  the  same
publication,  and  it  also  permits  the  plaintiff  to  recover  all  of  her
damages in one lawsuit. Newly issued editions of the book, however,
would give rise to a new defamation claim because this is considered
a new publication. Commentators have debated whether an entry on
a  website  gives  rise  to  a  single  defamation  suit  or  a  new  count  of

defamation  every  day  that  the  publication  remains  on  the  website.
Courts have not resolved application of the single-publication rule to
the Internet.

5. Defamation-Proof Plaintiffs.  There are a small number of cases
where courts have denied any recovery of compensatory damages to
the plaintiff because the court has found that the plaintiff’s reputation
was  already  so  poor
in  the  community  that  the  defendant’s
defamatory  statements  could  not  have  caused  any  harm.  In  one
case,  the  plaintiff  had  multiple  prior  criminal  convictions.  When  the
National Enquirer falsely reported that he had an affair with Elizabeth
Taylor,  he  sued  for  libel.  Rejecting  his  claim  for  actual  damages,  the
court stated: “When . . . an individual engages in conspicuously anti-
social  or  even  criminal  behavior,  which  is  widely  reported  to  the
public, his reputation diminishes proportionately. Depending upon the
nature  of  the  conduct,  the  number  of  offenses,  and  the  degree  and
range  of  publicity  received,  there  comes  a  time  when  .  .  .  he  can
recover  only  nominal  damages
for  subsequent  defamatory
statements.” Wynberg v. National Enquirer, Inc., 564 F. Supp. 924, 928
(D.  Cal.  1982).  In  Guccione  v.  Hustler  Magazine,  Inc.,  the  plaintiff
(publisher  of  Penthouse  magazine)  was  denied  recovery  for  the
defendant’s  libel  of  him  despite  its  false  accusation  of  him  as  an
adulterer. See also, Kevorkian v. American Medical Ass’n, 602 N.W.2d
233 (Mich. Ct. App. 1999) (plaintiff, famous for his physician-assisted
suicides,  was  not  permitted  to  recover  for  defendant’s  accusations
that  he  was  a  “killer”  and  a  “criminal”).  Can  you  think  of  any  other
notorious people in our society who might have trouble recovering for
certain  types  of  false  and  defamatory  statements?  How  would  you
feel  if  a  court  held  that  you  were  defamation-proof?  For  further
discussion  of  this  doctrine,  compare  Note,  The  Libel-Proof  Plaintiff
Doctrine, 98 Harv. L. Rev. 1909 (1985) (surveying the law concerning
the  libel-proof  plaintiff  doctrine  and  arguing  that  it  “serves  the
legitimate purpose of barring — in narrowly deﬁned circumstances —
suits  that  serve  no  productive  juridical  purpose.”)  and  King,  Jr.,  The

Misbegotten Libel-Proof Doctrine and the “Gordian Knot” Syndrome,
29 Hofstra L. Rev. 343 (2000) (arguing that the issue of the plaintiff’s
reputation  should  merely  be  evaluated  by  the  jury  in  assessing
damages rather than justifying dismissal of the suit).

6.  Problems.   Would  plaintiffs  appear  to  have  viable  defamation
claims  in  the  following  scenarios?  In  each,  would  the  statement
involve  slander  or  libel,  and  per  se  or  per  quod?  And  in  which  of  the
following instances would the libel versus slander distinction appear
to make a difference?

A. After interviewing Sheldon for a job at a nuclear research facility,
Raj looks at Sheldon’s Facebook page and ﬁnds an entry written
by Howard, one of Sheldon’s prior co-workers, saying: “Sheldon,
sorry you were ﬁred for plagiarizing the results of your research.”
Howard  was  confused  about  the  real  reasons  for  Sheldon’s
termination.  Raj  decides  not  to  hire  Sheldon  for  the  new
position.

B.  Bernadette  is  jealous  over  Penny’s  career  achievements  and
writes  on  the  public  bathroom  stall  at  Penny’s  apartment
complex  that,  “Penny  is  such  a  floozy,  who  knows  what  germs
she  has?”  Penny  hears  whispers  about  these  allegations
everywhere she goes.

C.  Leonard,  an  aspiring  astronaut,  hears  that  his  former  friend
Stuart  told  a  NASA  administrator  that  Leonard  gets  motion
sickness  easily.  Leonard  loses  his  chance  to  be  selected  for  a
space  mission.  A  book  publisher  who  had  once  offered  him  a
chance  to  write  an  autobiography  about  his  potential  space
adventure loses interest in the project.

D.  A  newspaper  writes  a  headline  in  large  font — “Amy  Confesses
Guilt.”  Within  the  body  of  the  story,  it  describes  how  Amy  is
starting  her  own  ice  cream  business  and  admits  to  having  an
addiction for chocolate ice cream that she indulges in daily.

E. The local news does a story about Leslie, erroneously attributing
a quote to her that says, “I hate the outdoors; if given the chance

to  go  for  a  walk  or  sit  in  a  dentist’s  chair,  I’d  pick  the  drill  any
day.”  Leslie  is  the  head  of  the  local  parks  department  and  her
staff now ridicules her.

III  PRIVILEGES

important  role  as  afﬁrmative  defenses

Privileges  play  an
in
defamation  lawsuits.  Even  a  plaintiff  who  has  proven  that  the
defendant’s  intentional  publication  of  a  defamatory  statement  about
the  plaintiff  is  false  might  still  face  defeat  due  to  the  operation  of  a
legal  privilege.  The  common  law  has  long  recognized  that  certain
communications  are  so  highly  valued  that  speech  that  might
otherwise be actionable as defamation might be subject to particular
privileges.  Some  of  these  common  law  privileges  are  absolute —
when the privilege attaches there can be no defamation claim based
upon the communication. Other privileges are only qualiﬁed — that is,
that  the  circumstances  may  or  may  not  warrant  immunity  from  a
defamation  claim.  The  Johnson  and  Powers  cases  below  contain
examples  of  both  absolute  and  qualiﬁed  privileges.  Consider  as  you
read  them  why  the  law  would  recognize  privileges  in  their  different
contexts.

Beginning  in  the  1960s,  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court  determined  that
the First Amendment applied to certain state law defamation claims
and,  when  applicable,  necessarily  required  some  constitutional
“breathing  space”  for  the  speaker.  The  contours  and  application  of
this  First  Amendment  privilege  have  been  the  subject  of  numerous
lengthy  published  opinions.  As  you  will  see  in  the  Khawar  case,  the
level of protection varies with both the categorization of the plaintiff
and the nature of the speech involved. In certain circumstances, the
level  of  protection  also  varies  based  upon  whether  the  plaintiff  is
seeking  to  recover  actual  proven  damages,  presumed  damages,  or
punitive damages. Finally, in the Dun & Bradstreet case, the Supreme
Court  will  loosen  First  Amendment  protections  for  certain  plaintiffs
suing over certain types of communications based upon their content
and the public’s interest in hearing the communication.

A. Common Law

JOHNSON v. QUEENAN
12 Mass. L. Rptr. 461 (Mass. Super. Ct. 2000)

      , J.

Plaintiff  Johnson  [defendant-in-counterclaim]  brought  this  action
against defendant Christopher Queenan [plaintiff-in-counterclaim] for
assault and battery after defendant allegedly raped her at a party that
both  attended  on  November  29,  1996.  In  response,  Queenan  ﬁled  a
counterclaim  against  Johnson  alleging  defamation.  Plaintiff  now
moves for summary judgment on [the defamation counterclaim]. For
the reasons set forth below, Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment
is ALLOWED.

The  undisputed  material  facts  as  established  by  the  summary
judgment record are as follows. Johnson alleges that Queenan raped
and assaulted her in a bedroom at a private party that both Johnson
and  Queenan  attended  on  November  29,  1996
in  Westford,
Massachusetts.  Johnson  acknowledges  being  in  the  bedroom  and
kissing  Queenan.  Johnson,  however,  contends  that  although  she
repeatedly told Queenan that she did not want to have intercourse, he
held  her  down  on  the  bed  and  raped  her.  Queenan  denies  raping
Johnson,  but  acknowledges  that  Johnson  was  crying  when  he  left
the bedroom.

Upon  leaving  the  bedroom,  Johnson  located  her  friend  Ryan
Dadmun  (Dadmun)  who  was  also  at  the  party  and  told  him  that
Queenan  had  just  raped  her.  Johnson  asked  Dadmun  to  drive  her
home. She did not report the rape to anyone else that evening.

The next morning, Johnson telephoned Dadmun and asked him to
help her make arrangements to see a doctor. After several telephone
calls to various health care providers, Johnson realized that her only

treatment  option  was  the  emergency  room.  Reluctant  to  go  to  the
emergency room, Johnson asked Dadmun to bring her to her friend,
Staci  Scolovino’s  (Scolovino)  home.  After  Johnson  explained  to
Scolovino  that  Queenan  raped  her,  Scolovino  brought  her  to  the
Emerson  Hospital  emergency  room.  Johnson  was  not  treated
immediately and left the emergency room with Scolovino because the
rape specialist at the emergency room was not on duty and Johnson
was scheduled to work later that afternoon.

Later  that  evening,  Dadmun  again  drove  Johnson  to  Emerson
Hospital’s emergency room. Dr. Ingrid Balcolm and Nurse Heidi Crim
(Nurse  Crim)  examined  and  treated  Johnson  in  accordance  with
Massachusetts sexual assault protocol. Pursuant to G.L.c. 112 §12A
½,  Nurse  Crim  reported  the  alleged  incident  to  the  Westford  Police
Department,  however,  at  Johnson’s  request  Nurse  Crim  did  not
provide  the  police  with  Johnson’s  name.  Nurse  Crim  encouraged
Johnson  to  discuss  the  incident  with  her  parents  or  a  close  family
friend.

Based  on  Nurse  Crim’s  report,  the  Westford  Police  Department
began a criminal investigation of the alleged incident. On December 5,
1996,  as  part  of  this
investigation,  Detective  Michael  Perron
(Detective  Perron)  met  with  the  Dean  of  Students,  Carla  Scuzzarella
(Scuzzarella)  at  Johnson’s  school  and  told  her  that  he  needed  to
speak  with  Johnson.  Scuzzarella  arranged  to  have  Johnson  meet
privately  with  Detective  Perron.  During  the  meeting,  Johnson  gave
Detective  Perron  her  account  of  the  events  of  November  29,  1996.
Detective Perron also encouraged Johnson to talk to her parents and
accompanied  her  home,  where  Johnson  told  her  mother  about  the
incident involving Queenan.

As  a  result  of  the  investigation,  the  Westford  Police  charged
Queenan  with  rape  and  assault  and  battery.  While  the  criminal  case
was  pending  in  Ayer  District  Court,  the  Commonwealth  made  a
presentment  to  a  Middlesex  County  Grand  Jury.  Both  Johnson  and

Queenan testiﬁed before the Grand Jury. The Grand Jury, however, did
not issue an indictment to Queenan.

The moving party bears the burden of afﬁrmatively demonstrating
the absence of a triable issue and that the summary judgment record
entitles  it  to  judgment  as  a  matter  of  law.  Courts  favor  the  use  of
summary judgment in cases in which defamation is alleged.

The  plaintiff  bears  the  initial  burden  of  proving  prima  facie
elements  of  a  slander  claim — “the  publication  of  a  false  and
defamatory  statement  by  spoken  words  of  and  concerning  the
plaintiff.” Ellis v. Safety Ins.  Co.,  672  N.E.2d  979  (Mass.  1996),  citing
Restatement (Second) of Torts §§558 and 568 (1977).

STATEMENTS MADE TO DETECTIVE PERRON, ADA BEDROSIAN,
AND THE MIDDLESEX GRAND JURY

Johnson  asserts  that  various  statements  made  to  Detective  Perron,
ADA  Bedrosian  and  the  Middlesex  Grand  Jury  are  privileged  under
Massachusetts  law.  Once  the  plaintiff  meets  its  initial  burden,  the
defendant has the burden to show that a privilege applies. See Jones
v.  Taibbi,  512  N.E.2d  260  (Mass.  1987).  “An  absolute  privilege
provides  a  defendant  with  complete  defense  to  a  defamation  suit
even  if  the  defamatory  statement  is  uttered  maliciously  or  in  bad
faith.  A  qualiﬁed  or  conditional  privilege,  on  the  other  hand,
immunizes  a  defendant  from  liability  unless  he  or  she  acted  with
actual  malice,  or  unless  there  is  ‘unnecessary,  unreasonable  or
excessive publication,’ and the plaintiff establishes that the defendant
information  recklessly.”  Mulgrew  v.
published  the  defamatory
Taunton,  574  N.E.2d  389  (Mass.  1991)  (citations  omitted).  Johnson
contends that her statements to Detective Perron, ADA Bedrosian and
the  Middlesex  Grand  Jury  fall  under  an  absolute  privilege,  thus
immunizing her from any claim of defamation.

Statements  made  in  the  course  of  judicial  proceedings  which
pertain  to  the  proceeding  are  absolutely  privileged  and  cannot

support a claim of defamation, even if communicated with malice or
in  bad  faith.  See  Correllas  v.  Viveiros,  572  N.E.2d  7  (Mass.  1991)
(statements  made  to  investigating  police  ofﬁcers  and  prosecutor
during the course of the investigation are privileged); Hahn v. Sargent,
388 F. Supp. 445, 452 (D. Mass. 1975), affd, 523 F.2d 461 (1975), cert.
jury
denied,  425  U.S.  904  (1976)  (testimony  before  a  grand
privileged).  Therefore,  I  ﬁnd  that  all  statements  Johnson  made  to
Detective  Perron,  ADA  Bedrosian,  and  the  Middlesex  Grand  Jury  are
protected  under  an  absolute  privilege  because  they  pertain  to  the
judicial proceeding and were made in the course of that proceeding.

STATEMENTS MADE TO NURSE CRIM, DADMUN, SCOLOVINO, AND
JOHNSON’S MOTHER

Johnson also contends that her statements to Nurse Crim, Dadmun,
Scolovino  and  her  mother  are  conditionally  privileged  and  thus
protected  against  Queenan’s  defamation  claim.  Massachusetts
recognizes certain privileges that are conditioned upon the manner in
which  they  are  exercised.  See  Sheehan  v.  Tobin,  93  N.E.2d  524
(Mass.  1950).  One  type  of  conditional  privilege  protects  statements
“where  the  publisher  and  the  recipient  have  a  common  interest,  and
the  communication  is  of  a  kind  reasonably  calculated  to  protect  or
further it.” Sheehan,  326  Mass.  at  190-91.  Where  there  is  no  dispute
about the existence of the facts surrounding the publication, a judge
must determine whether or not the privilege applies.

Here,  after  Johnson  told  Dadmun  that  she  had  been  raped,  he
immediately  brought  her  home.  The  next  morning,  Dadmun  and
Scolovino  assisted  Johnson  in  seeking  medical  care.  Johnson  told
Nurse Crim about the alleged rape in order to receive the appropriate
medical  treatment.  Johnson  later  conﬁded  in  her  mother  after  both
Nurse  Crim  and  Detective  Perron  encouraged  her  to  do  so,
presumably  to  enable  her  to  get  proper  emotional  support.  Thus,
Johnson’s  publication  to  her  two  close  friends  Dadmun  and

Scolovino,  Nurse  Crim,  and  her  mother  are  protected  by  a  qualiﬁed
privilege because the communications were reasonably calculated to
further a common interest, namely Johnson’s physical and emotional
well-being.

Once  a  defendant  asserts  a  claim  of  privilege,  it  is  plaintiff’s
burden  to  prove  abuse  of  the  privilege  or  actual  malice.  Plaintiff
provides  no  evidence  to  support  a  claim  that  Johnson  abused  the
privilege through unnecessary, unreasonable or excessive publication,
nor does he indicate that he can produce any evidence to enable him
to  reach  the  jury  on  the  issue  of  malice.  Based  on  the  foregoing,
Queenan  has  failed  to  provide  sufﬁcient  evidence  for  a  jury  to  infer
that  Johnson,  without  a  privilege  to  do  so,  published  a  false  and
defamatory  statement  about  Queenan.  Thus,  Johnson  is  entitled  to
summary judgment on Queenan’s defamation counterclaim.

For  the  foregoing  reasons,  it  is  hereby  ORDERED  that  plaintiff,
defendant-in-counterclaim, Johnson’s motion for summary judgment
be ALLOWED.

LESTER v. POWERS
596 A.2d 65 (Me. 1991)

       , J.

Lewis F. Lester appeals from a summary judgment in the Superior
Court.  The  court  concluded  Lester  could  have  no  recovery  on  his
claims for libel [or] slander against his former student, Mary Jane E.
Powers. We afﬁrm.

Powers  was  a  Colby  College  undergraduate  majoring
in
psychology.  In  early  1985,  during  her  junior  year,  she  took  a  class  in
abnormal  psychology  from  Lester,  then  an  associate  professor.  One
of  the  classes  was  a  discussion  of  homosexuality — speciﬁcally,  the
appropriateness of classifying homosexuality as a disorder when the

person  is  unhappy  about  his  or  her  sexual  orientation,  but  not  when
the person is happy. [Powers had recently concluded that she was a
lesbian but was not open yet about it.]

In  the  class  discussion,  at  least  one  student  made  comments  to
the effect that “gays are sick”; Lester questioned the appropriateness
of  the  differential  classiﬁcation  of  the  two  classiﬁcations  of
homosexuality, and said that he had gay friends in the mental health
profession  who  themselves  did  not  understand  why  they  were  “that
way.” Powers understood his tone of voice to indicate disapproval.

Whether  or  not  Powers  overreacted,  however,  she  undisputedly
was  upset.  After  the  class,  she  went  immediately  to  an  assistant
dean  and  complained  that  she  had  found  Lester’s  handling  of  the
subject  offensive.  She  repeated  that  assertion  later  to  various
students,
the  college
administration.

faculty  members,  and  members  of

Lester  had  previously  been  afﬁliated  with  Colby  in  a  non-tenure-
track  position,  as  a  part-time  faculty  member  and  part-time  clinical
psychologist,  for  over  ten  years.  He  then  started  working  toward
tenure; this process culminated in a tenure review in the fall of 1986,
after  Powers  graduated  from  Colby.  As  a  part  of  the  tenure  review
process,  the  Committee  on  Promotion  and  Tenure  solicited  letters
from  former  students.  Powers  did  not  respond  to  this  invitation  to
comment before the Committee’s deadline, October 15.

Following  a  visit  to  Colby  after  the  deadline,  however,  Powers
contacted  the  Dean  of  the  Faculty  and  asked  if  it  was  too  late  to
comment.  The  Dean  invited  her  to  do  so,  even  though  the  deadline
had  passed.  Powers  then  wrote  the  letter  that  underlies  the  present
case.  The  letter  primarily  related  Powers’  version  of  the  class
discussion that upset her, together with several other minor incidents
involving Lester that she found distasteful, and concluded:

I don’t want to use this letter as a way to “get even” with Professor Lester. I have
found  him  to  be  entirely  knowledgeable  and  competent  in  his  ﬁeld,  and  I  have

received valuable assistance from him on one or two occasions in my work. But
as an ex-member of the college committee on sexual harassment, I know that a
student should not ever be made to feel uncomfortable or intimidated in her/his
learning  on  account  of  gender  or  sexual  orientation,  and  I  sadly  feel  this  was
deﬁnitely the case for me. I also know of others who still feel intimidated, much
as I have and for the same reasons, and who have not written to add their input
to this decision; I thank this Committee for the opportunity to express my (and
their) opinion that Professor Lewis Lester should not be tenured.

[After receiving the letter, the University decided to deny tenure to
Lester.  He  then  ﬁled  this  lawsuit.  Among  other  possible  defenses,
Powers  argued  that  her  comments  were  non-actionable  opinions  as
well as statements made during the tenure process and protected by
a qualiﬁed privilege.]

Following  a  hearing  [on  Powers’  motion  for  summary  judgment],
the  court  granted  summary  judgment.  With  regard  to  the  letter,  the
court  concluded  that  defendant  would  have  a  conditional  privilege
regarding  her  comments  made  in  the  tenure  consideration  process.
Frank  and  sometimes  critical  evaluations  of  a  person’s
job
performance  are  vital  to  employee  rating,  promotion  or  job  change
processes. If those who know most about one’s job performance are
deterred  from  frank  evaluations  by  fear  of  defamation  actions,  and
recommendations then come to be discounted as benign pablum, we
all lose. Job movers and seekers will be left to the gut and necessarily
arbitrary  instincts  of  employment  decisionmakers  who  act  without
conﬁdence that they have the accurate evaluation history so vital to
predicting future performance. To avoid this problem and bolster the
integrity  of  the  job  evaluation  process,  persons  who  are  expected  to
make  comments  on  employment  qualiﬁcations  and  do  so  in  the
normal  channels  of  an  employment  review  are  entitled  to  a
conditional privilege.

Examining the record, the [trial] court found no factual support for
the  suggestion  that  Powers  made  the  statements  in  the  letter
knowing  them  to  be  false  or  recklessly  disregarding  whether  they

were  true  or  false;  instead,  the  court  found  that  the  record  could
support  only  the  conclusion  that  Powers  sincerely  believed  the
statements in the letter.
Lester now appeals.
A  defamation  claim  requires  a  statement — i.e.  an  assertion  of
fact, either explicit or implied, and not merely an opinion, provided the
opinion  does  not  imply  the  existence  of  undisclosed  defamatory
facts.  The  statement  must  be  false.  It  must  also  be  “of  and
concerning”  the  plaintiff.  The  statements
letter  were
undisputedly  “of  and  concerning”  Lester  and  tended  to  injure  his
professional reputation, and thus if false were actionable at common

A  conditional  privilege  against  liability  for  defamation  arises  in
settings  where  society  has  an  interest  in  promoting  free,  but  not
absolutely unfettered, speech. If a conditional privilege exists, liability
for defamation attaches only if the person who made the defamatory
statements  loses  the  privilege  through  abusing  it.  Such  an  abuse
occurs  when  the  person  either  knows  the  statement  to  be  false  or
recklessly  disregards  its  truth  or  falsity.  [Unlike  First  Amendment
privileges,  a  plaintiff  may  create  liability  notwithstanding  a  common
law  privilege  by  showing  its  abuse  by  a  preponderance  of  the
evidence standard, rather than by clear and convincing evidence.]

Lester  argues  that  the  Superior  Court  erred  in  deciding  that
Powers’  statements  were  made  under  conditions  giving  rise  to  a
conditional  privilege.  He  asserts  that  Maine  law  recognizes  such  a
privilege  only  within  an  employment  relationship.  We  disagree.
Conditional  privilege  is  based  upon  the  circumstances  of  “the
occasion  upon  which  the  defendant  published  defamatory  matter,”
and  we  use  the  Restatement  approach  when  determining  the
existence of such circumstances.

The Restatement does not prescribe a list of particular settings to
which conditional privileges are restricted. Instead, it uses a weighing

approach  based  on  the  totality  of  the  circumstances,  in  view  of  the
interests of the publisher and the recipient. See Restatement  §§594-
598. Any situation in which an important interest of the recipient will
be  furthered  by  frank  communication  may  give  rise  to  a  conditional
privilege. See Restatement §595, comment j.

Powers  wrote  the  letter  in  connection  with  tenure  review,  an
occasion in which the need for candid speech is apparent. She did so
in  response  to  a  request  by  Colby  College  and  in  furtherance  of
Colby’s  interests  in  the  tenure  review  process.  As  a  recent  alumna,
she  had  a  close  and  ongoing  relationship  with  Colby.  Under  these
circumstances, her letter was subject to a conditional privilege.

Lester  asserts  that  even  if  Powers’  letter  would  ordinarily  have
been subject to a conditional privilege, she lost the privilege through
abuse  because  her  publication  of  it  was  outside  ordinary  channels,
excessive,  improper,  and  not  calculated  to  further  the  college’s
interests. See Restatement §599. He contends the letter was “outside
ordinary channels” because Powers submitted it after the October 15
deadline  for  comments.  We  ﬁnd  his  argument  unpersuasive.  The
college  solicited  the  letter  and  assured  Powers  that  her  comments
were  desired  even  if  they  were  late.  She  submitted  the  letter  to  the
Committee,  which  reviewed  it  in  the  course  of  its  tenure  review
deliberations.  Lester  similarly  argues  that  Powers  lost  the  privilege
through abuse because she submitted the letter out of ill will toward
him.  Contrary  to  his  assertion,  however,  a  publication  of  defamatory
matter upon an occasion giving rise to a privilege, if made solely from
spite or ill will, is an abuse and not a use of the privilege. However, if
the  publication  is  made  for  the  purpose  of  protecting  the  interest  in
question,  the  fact  that  the  publication  is  inspired  in  part  by
resentment  or  indignation  at  the  supposed  misconduct  of  the
person  defamed  does  not  constitute  an  abuse  of  the  privilege.
Because the record does not support Lester’s contention that Powers
submitted the letter solely out of spite or ill will and not to further the

tenure  review  process,  we  cannot  conclude  that  she  lost  her
conditional privilege through abuse.

Powers  [also]  argues  that  because  her  letter  expressed  only  her
opinion  and  no  statements  of  fact,  it  is  not  actionable.  Although
Maine’s  common  law  of  defamation  does  not  allow  recovery  for
statements of opinion alone, deciding whether a statement expresses
“fact”  or  “opinion”  is  not  always  an  easy  task.  Our  standard  looks  to
the totality of the circumstances: [A] comment . . . is an opinion if it is
clear  from  the  surrounding  circumstances  that  the  maker  of  the
statement did not intend to state an objective fact but intended rather
to make a personal observation on the facts. Caron, 470 A.2d at 784.
Under  the  Caron  test,  Powers’
letter  expresses  her  personal
observations, and thus is a statement of opinion rather than of fact. It
conveys  her  subjective  evaluation  that  Lester  was  homophobic,  and
that  his  manner  was  offensive,
insensitive,  and  occasionally
intimidating; these are not statements of fact but rather her personal
observations.  The  letter  itself  makes  it  clear  that  Powers  was
conveying  her  subjective  impressions;  it  states  at  the  outset  that  it
expresses “my strong opinions on this matter.” Finally, the context in
which  the  letter  was  written  indicates  that  the  kinds  of  statements
tenure  review  process  are  evaluations — i.e.,
solicited
statements  of  opinion  as  to  the  tenure  candidate’s  merit.  We  are
persuaded that the letter was an expression of opinion.

Knowledge  or  disregard  of  falsity  is  a  purely  subjective  state  of
mind.  Although  Lester  contends  numerous  statements  in  Powers’
letter  are  false,  “there  must  be  sufﬁcient  evidence  to  permit  the
conclusion that the defendant in fact entertained serious doubts as

to the truth of his publication.” Michaud, 381 A.2d at 1114. Evidence
that some of Powers’ factual premises were objectively false, or even
that no reasonable person could have believed them to be true, does
not show that she knew or disregarded their falsity.

infer  that  Powers  knew  the
statements  in  her  letter  were  false,  however,  because  after  she
learned  that  Lester  had  been  denied  tenure,  she  destroyed  or
discarded  her  notes  from  his  abnormal  psychology  class,  including
whatever  notes  she
the  class  discussion  of
homosexuality. Although Powers explained this action as her way of
turning  the  page  psychologically  on  “unﬁnished  business,”  Lester
argues a jury might fairly infer that she destroyed the notes because
they  did  not  support  the  version  of  the  class  portrayed  in  her  letter,
and therefore that she was consciously untruthful. He also suggests
a  jury  could  rationally  draw  the  same  inference  from  the  fact  that
Powers submitted the letter after the deadline.

We  disagree.  Even  though  Lester  is  entitled  to  “the  full  beneﬁt  of
all favorable inferences that may be drawn from [the] evidence,” he is
not entitled to the beneﬁt of unsupported speculation. The trial court
properly concluded that Lester failed to generate a factual issue as to
whether  Powers  abused  the  conditional  privilege  afforded  her  letter,
and  accordingly  Powers  was  entitled  to  a  summary  judgment  as  a
matter of law.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Absolute Privileges.  For speech that is so essential that courts
will  not  tolerate  the  chill  of  any  defamation  claim,  the  common  law
has  created  an  absolute  or  unconditional  privilege.
In  these
instances,  courts  have  concluded  that  the  interest  in  undeterred
speech  far  outweighs  the  interests  of  the  victim  in  vindicating  her
name  and  in  being  compensated  for  her  reputational  injury.  As  you

might guess, instances where the common law has recognized such
a  broad  privilege  to  defame  another  are  quite  limited.  Two  primary
contexts  generate  such  a  privilege:  (1)  the  operation  of  the  various
branches  of  government;  and  (2)  the  operation  of  the  institution  of
marriage. For speech that arises in the “course of” judicial, legislative,
or executive functions of government, an absolute privilege generally
attaches.  Absolute  privileges  are  quite  absolute — when  applicable,
no  amount  of  bad  faith  or  ill  will  by  the  publisher  of  the  defamatory
statements will give rise to a meritorious defamation claim. Is this too
much protection? Does it invite perjured testimony? Johnson involved
various  forms  of  speech  related  to  the  investigation  and  attempted
prosecution  of  a  criminal  case  against  the  alleged  rapist.  The  court
had  no  problem  concluding  that  each  of  the  plaintiff/counter-
defendant’s statements was so closely associated with the potential
criminal case that the absolute privilege should attach. Can you make
an argument that only some of the plaintiff’s speech protected by the
absolute  privilege  in  Johnson  should  have  been  considered  so
protected? Some states treat an alleged crime victim’s statements to
criminal  enforcement  personnel  as  not  sufﬁciently  related  to  a
criminal  lawsuit  for  the  absolute  privilege  to  attach,  instead  only
applying  a  qualiﬁed  privilege  conditioned  upon  good  faith.  Johnson
applied  a  broader  view  of  when  this  absolute  privilege  attaches,
applying  it  to  each  of  the  plaintiff’s  statements  made  to  the  police,
district attorney, and grand jury.

2. Qualiﬁed Common Interest Privilege.  The common law has also
recognized a common interest privilege according to Johnson, where
the  “publisher  and  recipient  have  a  common  interest,  and  the
communication  is  of  a  kind  reasonably  calculated  to  protect  or
further  it.”  Taken  literally,  this  broad  description  could  apply  in  any
instance  where  even  a  prurient  interest  motivated  a  conversation
between the defamer and a third party. In Powers, the court explains
that  this  privilege  only  will  apply  where  the  court  believes  the
“A
communication  has  sufﬁcient  value

justify  protection:

to

conditional privilege against liability for defamation arises in settings
where  society  has  an  interest  in  promoting  free,  but  not  absolutely
unfettered,  speech.”  What  was  so  important  in  Johnson  about  the
plaintiff/counter-defendant’s  speech  with  her  friends,  health  care
providers, and family to warrant qualiﬁed or conditional protection? In
Powers, how did the court describe the need for a qualiﬁed privilege
in the context of the tenure decision? Can you think of other areas of
communication in our society where courts might want to apply the
common interest privilege? In terms of defeating the invocation of a
conditional privilege, courts generally look for evidence of some type
of malice (stated as either ill-will or knowledge of the speech’s falsity),
or  the  overuse  or  abuse  of  the  privilege.  Can  you  think  of
circumstances  where  an  alleged  rape  victim’s  allegations  of  rape
might be considered excessive under the common interest privilege?
3. Statutory Privileges, Codiﬁcations, and Modiﬁcations of Common
Law.  Perhaps not having sufﬁcient faith that the courts will recognize
the importance of some speech and provide it with the protection of a
common
legislatures  sometimes  enact  statutory
privileges or modify the common law to limit liability. A few examples
follow. With respect to each statute, why do you think the legislators
perceived  that  the  speech  needed  protection?  How  broad  is  the
protection?

against the recovery of any damages except actual damages,
as  well  as  being  competent  and  material  in  mitigation  of

4.  Opinions  vs.  Facts.   We  have  previously  seen  in  Busch  that
statements  of  opinion  will  not  support  a  defamation  claim — which
demands
“factual
instead  publication  of  false  statements  of
information”  regarding  the  plaintiff.  In  Powers,  the  court  deals  with
one  exception  to  this  rule,  in  instances  where  the  opinion  falsely

implies  additional  facts  supporting  the  opinion  that  would  be
considered defamatory. Can you think of any such speech?

5.  Problems.   Would  any  common  law  or  statutory  privileges
preclude  defamation  claimants  from  recovering  in  the  following
circumstances?

A. Two teenagers are eating lunch in the cafeteria. Susan wants to
deter Bethany from going out with Felix, the quarterback of the
school  football  team.  Therefore,  Susan  tells  Bethany  to  “stay
away  from  Felix  for  your  own  good  because  he  has  a  venereal
disease.”

B.  One  law  student  advises  another  that,  “In  my  opinion,  I’ve
likely  a
[another

law  student]

is

concluded  that  Joshua
pedophile. Stay away from him.”

C.  Isabella  was  hurt  in  her  Chevrolet  Camaro  when  the  brakes
failed.  She  writes  a  letter  to  the  C.E.O.  of  General  Motors  (the
manufacturer) demanding that the company pay her the sum of
$1,000,000  for  her  injuries,  alleging  that  the  C.E.O.  “purposely
produced  a  defective  car.”  To  show  how  serious  she  was,  she
sent  a  copy  of  the  letter  to  her  local  television  news  station
asking them to air a story about the incident.

D.  After  Isabella’s  demand  letter  goes  unnoticed,  Isabella  hires  a
lawyer and ﬁles a lawsuit against General Motors and its C.E.O.
She personally schedules a press conference on the courthouse
steps moments after ﬁling the lawsuit in the district clerk’s ofﬁce
and  reads  from  her  complaint.  The  complaint  repeats  the
allegations of the two defendants knowingly producing defective
cars.

E. During the trial of Isabella’s product liability suit against General
Motors  and  its  C.E.O.,  Isabella  testiﬁes  about  the  accident  and
her  resulting  injuries.  After  watching  her  testimony,  the  judge
turns to the jury and says, “It’s up to you to judge the credibility
of each witness, but I found Isabella’s testimony to be bordering
on perjury.”

F.  After  losing  her  lawsuit  against  General  Motors,  Isabella  posts
comments on the Chevrolet website under “Customer Reviews.”
In  her  review  she  repeats  her  accusations  that  General  Motors
and its C.E.O. were purposefully selling defective cars and states
that their “continued conduct shows their corporate arrogance.”
G.  Alejandro  is  a  major  league  baseball  player  known  as  a  home
run  hitter.  In  the  wake  of  media  reports  of  steroid  abuse  in
baseball,  a  congressional  subcommittee  holds  an  inquiry  into
steroid  abuse  in  professional  sports  and  invites  Alejandro  to
testify. Alejandro testiﬁes before Congress that another famous
home run hitter, Peter, was a steroid abuser and claims that he
had  personally  witnessed  Peter  injecting  himself  when  they
played on the same team. It turns out that this information was
false  and  that  Alejandro  was  testifying  against  Peter  because
both were competing for a lucrative free agent contract with the
New York Yankees.

H.  Destiny  lives  in  a  small  town  and  was  recently  the  victim  of  a
burglary  while  away  on  vacation.  She  suspected  her  neighbor
Jada  might  be  the  thief.  The  next  time  she  saw  Jada  was  at
church on a Sunday morning. Destiny pointed her ﬁnger at Jada
during the middle of the service and said, “Jada it’s time for you
to confess and repent from your sins. You know you broke into
my house!”

B. Constitutional Privilege

As  if  the  state  law  of  privileges  did  not  adequately  complicate  the
traditional common law defamation claim, the U.S. Supreme Court in
1964 found that state courts imposing defamation liability for speech
implicated the First Amendment’s concern for freedom of speech. In
New York Times v. Sullivan, the Court found that public ofﬁcials had
to  prove  by  clear  and  convincing  evidence  both  the  falsity  of  the

defamatory speech (in states that made truth an afﬁrmative defense)
and that the speaker published the comments with actual malice —
that  is,  with  knowledge  of  the  falsity  of  the  speech  or  with  gross
negligence as to the truth or falsity of the speech. In this application
of  the  First  Amendment,  the  Court  was  providing  a  qualiﬁed  or
involving
conditional  constitutional  privilege  for  certain  speech
certain  victims.  Subsequent  decisions  have  further  reﬁned  this
analysis  by  deﬁning  what  actual  malice  means  under  different
circumstances,  by  clarifying  who  qualiﬁes  as  a  public  ofﬁcial,  by
broadening the rule’s application to public ﬁgures, and by coming up
with other protections for suits brought by private ﬁgures concerning
matters  of  public  importance.  The  Khawar  case  involves  a  good
discussion and application of much of this area of the law. The Dun &
Bradstreet  case  in  the  next  section  demonstrates  the  Court  placing
limits  on  the  application  of  the  First  Amendment’s  reach  into  purely
private  matters  of  speech.  As  you  read  these  two  opinions,  try  to
visualize  the  delicate  balancing  of  competing  interests  embodied  by
the case law in this ﬁeld.

1. Speech About Public Ofﬁcials, Public Figures, and

Public Matters

KHAWAR v. GLOBE INTERNATIONAL, INC.
965 P.2d 696 (Cal. 1998)

       , J.

We granted review to decide certain issues concerning the federal
Constitution’s  guarantees  of  freedom  of  speech  and  of  the  press
insofar as they restrict a state’s ability to impose tort liability for the
publication  of  defamatory  falsehoods.  More  speciﬁcally,  we  address
the  deﬁnition  of  a  “public  ﬁgure”  for  purposes  of  tort  and  First

Amendment law . . . and the showings required to support awards of
compensatory  and  punitive  damages  for  the  republication  of  a
defamatory falsehood.

In  November  1988,  Roundtable  Publishing,  Inc.,  (Roundtable)
published a book written by Robert Morrow (Morrow) and entitled The
Senator Must Die: The Murder of Robert Kennedy (the Morrow book).
The  Morrow  book  alleged  that  the  Iranian  Shah’s  secret  police
(SAVAK),  working  together  with  the  Maﬁa,  carried  out  the  1968
assassination of United States Senator Robert F. Kennedy (Kennedy)
in California and that Kennedy’s assassin was not Sirhan Sirhan, who
had  been  convicted  of  Kennedy’s  murder,  but  a  man  named  Ali
Ahmand,  whom  the  Morrow  book  described  as  a  young  Pakistani
who,  on  the  evening  of  the  Kennedy  assassination,  wore  a  gold-
colored sweater and carried what appeared to be a camera but was
actually  the  gun  with  which  Ahmand  killed  Kennedy.  The  Morrow
book contained four photographs of a young man the book identiﬁed
as Ali Ahmand standing in a group of people around Kennedy at the
Ambassador  Hotel  in  Los  Angeles  shortly  before  Kennedy  was
assassinated.

Globe  International,  Inc.,  (Globe)  publishes  a  weekly  tabloid
newspaper called Globe. Its issue of April 4, 1989, contained an article
on  page  9  under  the  headline:  Former  CIA  Agent  Claims:  Iranians
Killed  Bobby  Kennedy  for  the  Mafia  (the  Globe  article).  Another
headline,  appearing  on  the  front  page  of  the  same  issue,  stated:
Iranian secret police killed Bobby Kennedy. The Globe article, written
by  John  Blackburn  (a  freelance  reporter  and  former  Globe  staff
reporter),  gave  an  abbreviated,  uncritical  summary  of  the  Morrow
book’s allegations. The Globe article included a photograph from the
Morrow book showing a group of men standing near Kennedy; Globe
enlarged the image of these individuals and added an arrow pointing
to one of these men and identifying him as the assassin Ali Ahmand.

In August 1989, Khalid Iqbal Khawar (Khawar) brought this action
against  Globe,  Roundtable,  and  Morrow,  alleging  that  he  was  the

person depicted in the photographs and identiﬁed in the Morrow book
as Ali Ahmand, and that the book’s accusation, repeated in the Globe
article, that he had assassinated Kennedy was false and defamatory
and had caused him substantial injury.

Morrow defaulted, and Roundtable settled with both Khawar and

Ahmad before trial. A jury trial ensued on the claims against Globe.

The  evidence  at  trial  showed  that  in  June  1968,  when  Kennedy
was  assassinated,  Khawar  was  a  Pakistani  citizen  and  a  freelance
photojournalist  working  on  assignment  for  a  Pakistani  periodical.  At
the  Ambassador  Hotel’s  Embassy  Room,  he  stood  on  the  podium
near  Kennedy  so  that  a  friend  could  photograph  him  with  Kennedy,
and  so  that  he  could  photograph  Kennedy.  He  was  aware  that
television cameras and the cameras of other journalists were focused
on  the  podium  and  that  his  image  would  be  publicized.  When
Kennedy left the Embassy Room, Khawar did not follow him; Khawar
was still in the Embassy Room when Kennedy was shot in the hotel
pantry  area.  Both  the  Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation  (FBI)  and  the
Los  Angeles  Police  Department  questioned  Khawar  about  the
assassination, but neither agency ever regarded him as a suspect.

We  consider  ﬁrst  Globe’s  contention  that  the  trial  court  and  the
Court  of  Appeal  erred  in  concluding  that  Khawar  is  a  private  rather
than a public ﬁgure for purposes of this defamation action.

The  federal  Constitution’s  First  Amendment,  made  applicable  to
the  states  by  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  guarantees  freedom  of
speech  and  of  the  press.  In  New  York  Times  Co.  v.  Sullivan  (1964)
376  U.S.  254,  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  for  the  ﬁrst  time
construed these constitutional guarantees as imposing limitations on
a  state’s  authority  to  award  damages  for  libel.  Speciﬁcally,  the  court
held  that  the  First  Amendment  “prohibits  a  public  ofﬁcial  from
recovering damages for a defamatory falsehood relating to his ofﬁcial
conduct  unless  he  proves  [through  clear  and  convincing  evidence]

that  the  statement  was  made  with  ‘actual  malice’ — that  is,  with
knowledge  that  it  was  false  or  with  reckless  disregard  of  whether  it
was  false  or  not.”  The  court  later  explained  that  the  publisher  of  a
defamatory  statement  acts  with  reckless  disregard  amounting  to
actual  malice  if,  at  the  time  of  publication,  the  publisher  “in  fact
entertained  serious  doubts  as  to  the  truth  of  his  publication.”  St.
Amant  v.  Thompson  (1968)  390  U.S.  727,  731.  In  Curtis  Publishing
Co.  v.  Butts  (1967)  388  U.S.  130,  134,  the  high  court  held  that  this
“actual malice” requirement for defamation actions brought by public
ofﬁcials  applied  also  to  defamation  actions  brought  by  “public
ﬁgures.”

In  Gertz  v.  Robert  Welch,  Inc.  (1974)  418  U.S.  323,  the  court
explained  that  it  had  imposed  the  actual  malice  requirement  on
defamation  actions  by  both  public  ofﬁcials  and  public  ﬁgures
because  such  persons  “usually  enjoy  signiﬁcantly  greater  access  to
the  channels  of  effective  communication  and  hence  have  a  more
realistic  opportunity  to  counteract  false  statements  than  private
individuals  normally  enjoy”  and  because  they  “have  voluntarily
exposed  themselves  to  increased  risk  of  injury  from  defamatory
falsehood  concerning  them.”  Concerning  the  latter  justiﬁcation,  the
court  stated:  “Hypothetically,  it  may  be  possible  for  someone  to
become a public ﬁgure through no purposeful action of his own, but
the instances of truly involuntary public ﬁgures must be exceedingly
rare.”

The court then explained that there are two types of public ﬁgures:
“Some occupy positions of such persuasive power and influence that
they  are  deemed  public  ﬁgures  for  all  purposes.  More  commonly,
those  classed  as  public  ﬁgures  have  thrust  themselves  to  the
forefront  of  particular  public  controversies  in  order  to  influence  the
resolution of the issues involved. In either event, they invite attention
and  comment.”  The  court  reiterated  the  distinction  in  these  words:
“[The  public  ﬁgure]  designation  may  rest  on  either  of  two  alternative
bases.  In  some  instances  an  individual  may  achieve  such  pervasive

fame or notoriety that he becomes a public ﬁgure for all purposes and
in  all  contexts.  More  commonly,  an  individual  voluntarily  injects
himself  or  is  drawn  into  a  particular  public  controversy  and  thereby
becomes  a  public  ﬁgure  for  a  limited  range  of  issues.  In  either  case
such persons assume special prominence in the resolution of public
questions.”

At trial, whether a plaintiff in a defamation action is a public ﬁgure
is  a  question  of  law  for  the  trial  court.  On  appeal,  the  trial  court’s
resolution  .  .  .  of  the  ultimate  question  of  public  ﬁgure  status  is
subject to independent review for legal error.

Applying  the  standard  here,  we  note,  ﬁrst,  that  Globe  does  not
contend that Khawar is a public ﬁgure for all purposes but merely that
he is a public ﬁgure for limited purposes relating to particular public
controversies. Globe’s main argument appears to be that publication
of  the  Morrow  book  drew  Khawar
into  public  controversies
surrounding Kennedy’s assassination and that Khawar is therefore an
involuntary  public  ﬁgure  for  the  limited  purpose  of  a  report  on  that
book. In making this argument, Globe relies on the language in Gertz,
supra,  418  U.S.  323,  that  it  is  possible  for  a  person  “to  become  a
public  ﬁgure  through  no  purposeful  action  of  his  own”  and  that  a
person  can  become  a  public  ﬁgure  by  being  “drawn  into  a  particular
public  controversy.”  Thus,  Globe  concedes,  at  least  for  purposes  of
this  one  argument,  that  Khawar  did  not  intentionally  thrust  himself
into the vortex of any public controversy.

We  ﬁnd  Globe’s  argument  unpersuasive  because  characterizing
Khawar as an involuntary public ﬁgure would be inconsistent with the
reasons that the United States Supreme Court has given for requiring
public  ﬁgures  to  prove  actual  malice  in  defamation  actions.  As  we
have explained, the high court imposed the actual malice requirement
on  defamation  actions  by  public  ﬁgures  and  public  ofﬁcials  for  two
reasons: They have media access enabling them to effectively defend
their reputations in the public arena; and, by injecting themselves into
public controversies, they may fairly be said to have voluntarily invited

comment  and  criticism.  By  stating  that  it  is  theoretically  possible  to
become  a  public  ﬁgure  without  purposeful  action  inviting  criticism,
the  high  court  has  indicated  that  purposeful  activity  may  not  be
essential  for  public  ﬁgure  characterization.  But  the  high  court  has
never  stated  or  implied  that  it  would  be  proper  for  a  court  to
characterize an individual as a public ﬁgure in the face of proof that
the  individual  had  neither  engaged  in  purposeful  activity  inviting
criticism  nor  acquired  substantial  media  access  in  relation  to  the
controversy  at  issue.  We  read  the  court’s  decisions  as  precluding
courts  from  afﬁxing  the  public  ﬁgure  label  when  neither  of  the
reasons  for  applying  that  label  has  been  demonstrated.  Thus,
assuming  a  person  may  ever  be  accurately  characterized  as  an
involuntary public ﬁgure, we infer from the logic of Gertz that the high
court  would  reserve  this  characterization  for  an  individual  who,
despite never having voluntarily engaged the public’s attention in an
the  outcome  of  a  public  controversy,
attempt
nonetheless  has  acquired  such  public  prominence  in  relation  to  the
controversy  as  to  permit  media  access  sufﬁcient  to  effectively
counter media-published defamatory statements.

influence

to

We  ﬁnd  in  the  record  no  substantial  evidence  that  Khawar
acquired  sufﬁcient  media  access  in  relation  to  the  controversy
surrounding  the  Kennedy  assassination  or  the  Morrow  book  to
effectively  counter  the  defamatory  falsehoods  in  the  Globe  article.
After  the  assassination  and  before  publication  of  the  Morrow  book,
no  reporter  contacted  Khawar  to  request  an  interview  about  the
assassination.  Nor  was  there  any  reason  for  a  reporter  to  do  so:
Khawar  was  not  a  suspect  in  the  investigation,  he  did  not  testify  at
the  trial  of  the  perpetrator  of  the  assassination,  and,  so  far  as  the
record  shows,  his  own  views  about  the  assassination  were  never
publicized.

Nothing  in  the  record  demonstrates  that  Khawar  acquired  any
signiﬁcant  media  access  as  a  result  of  publication  of  either  the
Morrow book or the other book, RFK Must Die (1970) by Robert Blair

Kaiser,  in  which,  according  to  Globe,  questions  were  raised  about
Khawar’s  activities  in  relation  to  the  assassination.  There  is  no
evidence that either book enjoyed substantial sales or was reviewed
in  widely  circulated  publications.  Indeed,  the  evidence  showed  that
when the Globe article appeared, Roundtable had sold only 500 of the
25,000  printed  copies  of  the  Morrow  book,  and  that  although
Roundtable had sent 150 copies of the Morrow book to various media
it.  Before
entities,  only  Globe  published  a  report  concerning
publication  of  the  Globe  article,  no  reporter  contacted  Khawar  to
interview  him  about  either  book,  and  he  remained  unaware  of  their
publication.

The interview by the Bakersﬁeld television station, which was the
only  interview  in  which  Khawar  ever  participated  that  related  in  any
way  to  the  Kennedy  assassination,  the  Morrow  book,  or  the  Globe
article, occurred after and in response to the publication of the Globe
article.  Although  this  single  interview  demonstrates  that  Khawar
enjoyed  some  media  access,  it  is  only  the  media  access  that  would
likely  be  available  to  any  private  individual  who  found  himself  the
subject  of  sensational  and  defamatory  accusations  in  a  publication
with a substantial nationwide circulation (Globe distributed more than
2.7  million  copies  of  the  issue  containing  the  Globe  article).  If  such
access were sufﬁcient to support a public ﬁgure characterization, any
member of the media — any newspaper, magazine, television or radio
network or local station — could confer public ﬁgure status simply by
publishing  sensational  defamatory  accusations  against  any  private
individual.  This  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  has  consistently
declined  to  permit.  As  the  court  has  repeatedly  said,  “those  charged
with  defamation  cannot,  by  their  own  conduct,  create  their  own
defense  by  making  the  claimant  a  public  ﬁgure.”  Hutchinson  v.
Proxmire, supra, 443 U.S. 111, 135 (1979).

Although  Globe’s  primary  argument  is  that  publication  of  the
Morrow  book  made  Khawar  an  involuntary  public  ﬁgure,  Globe  may
be  understood  to  argue  further  that  Khawar’s  involvement  with  the

Kennedy  assassination  controversies  was  not  entirely  involuntary
because,  immediately  before  the  assassination,  Khawar  sought  and
obtained  a  position  close  to  Kennedy  on  the  podium  knowing  that
there would be substantial media coverage of the event. For a variety
of  reasons,  this  conduct  does  not  demonstrate  that  Khawar
voluntarily  elected  to  encounter  an  increased  risk  of  injury  from
defamatory falsehoods in publications like the Globe article.

First, Khawar’s conduct occurred before any relevant controversy
arose.  The  controversies  discussed  in  the  Globe  article  related  to
Kennedy’s assassination and the particular theory concerning it that
was  proposed  in  the  Morrow  book.  Khawar’s  conduct  in  standing
near Kennedy at the hotel was not a voluntary association with either
of  those  controversies  because  the  conduct  occurred  before  the
assassination and before the Morrow book’s publication. Khawar did
not  know,  nor  should  he  have  known,  that  Kennedy  would  be
assassinated  moments  later,  much  less  that  a  book  would  be
published  20  years  thereafter  containing  the  theory  proposed  in  the
Morrow  book.  We  do  not  disagree  with  Globe  that  Kennedy’s
campaign  for  his  party’s  nomination  to  the  presidency  may  be
described  as  a  public  issue  or  controversy,  nor  do  we  disagree  that
Khawar  voluntarily  associated  himself  with  this  public  issue  or
controversy by allowing himself to be photographed with Kennedy at
a  campaign  press  conference.  But  these  facts  have  no
legal
signiﬁcance for purposes of this libel action. The subject of the Globe
article  was  not  Kennedy’s  candidacy  as  such,  but  rather  Kennedy’s
assassination and the theory put forward in the Morrow book.

Second,  even  as  to  the  public  issues  or  controversies  relating  to
Kennedy’s  candidacy,  the  role  in  these  controversies  that  Khawar
voluntarily  assumed  by  standing  near  Kennedy  on  the  podium  was
trivial  at  best.  Khawar’s  conduct
in  standing  near  Kennedy
foreseeably  resulted  in  his  being  photographed  with  Kennedy,  but  a
journalist who is photographed with other journalists crowded around

a  political  candidate  does  not  thereby  assume  any  special
prominence in relation to the political campaign issues.

Third, appearing on the podium was not conduct by which Khawar
“engaged  the  attention  of  the  public  in  an  attempt  to  influence  the
resolution of the issues involved.” Wolston, supra, 443 U.S. 157, 168.
Khawar, who was an admirer of Kennedy, wanted to be photographed
with  Kennedy  because  the  resulting  photographs  would  have  a
strictly  personal  value  as  souvenirs.  Khawar  did  not  anticipate,  nor
did  he  have  reason  to  anticipate,  that  inclusion  of  his  image  would
make the photographs more newsworthy or would in any way affect
the  resolution  of  any  public  issue  related  to  Kennedy’s  run  for  the
presidency.  In  brief,  by  appearing  in  close  proximity  to  Kennedy,
Khawar  did  not  engage  in  conduct  that  was  “calculated  to  draw
attention to himself in order to invite public comment or influence the
public with respect to any issue.”

The  First  Amendment

Having  concluded  that  Khawar  did  not  voluntarily  elect  to
encounter  an  increased  risk  of  media  defamation  and  that  before
publication  of  the  Globe  article  he  did  not  enjoy  media  access
sufﬁcient  to  prevent  resulting  injury  to  his  reputation,  we  agree  with
the  trial  court  and  the  Court  of  Appeal  that,  for  purposes  of  this
defamation action, Khawar is a private rather than a public ﬁgure.
to

federal  Constitution,  as
authoritatively  construed  by  the  United  States  Supreme  Court,  does
not require a private ﬁgure plaintiff to prove actual malice to recover
damages  for  actual  injury  caused  by  publication  of  a  defamatory
falsehood.  Gertz,  supra,  418  U.S.  323,  347.  Rather,  in  this  situation,
the  individual  states  may  deﬁne  the  appropriate  standard  of  liability
for  defamation,  provided  they  do  not  impose  liability  without  fault.

There  is  a  different  rule,  however,  for  recovery  of  either  punitive
damages  or  damages  for  presumed  injury.  The  United  States
Supreme Court has held that to recover such damages, even a private
ﬁgure plaintiff must prove actual malice if the defamatory statement
involves  matters  of  public  concern.  We  agree  with  Globe  that  the
Kennedy assassination is a matter of public concern.

Because  in  this  defamation  action  Khawar  is  a  private  ﬁgure
plaintiff,  he  was  required  to  prove  only  negligence,  and  not  actual
malice,  to  recover  damages  for  actual  injury  to  his  reputation.  But

assassination.  Because  Khawar  sought  punitive  and  presumed
damages  as  well  as  damages  for  actual  injury,  the  issues  of  both
actual  malice  and  negligence  were  submitted  to  the  jury.  The  jury
found that in publishing the Globe article Globe acted both negligently
and with actual malice. Globe challenged both ﬁndings on appeal. In
this court, Globe contends that the Court of Appeal erred in rejecting
its challenges to these two ﬁndings.

involving

Having  independently  reviewed  the  full  record,  we  agree  with  the
Court  of  Appeal  that  clear  and  convincing  proof  supports  the  jury’s
ﬁnding of actual malice.

In  this  context,  actual  malice  means  that  the  defamatory
statement  was  made  “with  knowledge  that  it  was  false  or  with
reckless  disregard  of  whether  it  was  false  or  not.”  New  York  Times
Co. v. Sullivan, supra, 376 U.S. 254, 280. Reckless disregard, in turn,
means that the publisher “in fact entertained serious doubts as to the
truth of his publication.” St. Amant v. Thompson, supra, 390 U.S. 727,
731. To prove actual malice, therefore, a plaintiff must “demonstrate
with  clear  and  convincing  evidence  that  the  defendant  realized  that
his  statement  was  false  or  that  he  subjectively  entertained  serious

doubts  as  to  the  truth  of  his  statement.”  Bose  Corp.  v.  Consumers
Union of U.S., Inc., supra, 466 U.S. 485, 511, fn. 30.

To  prove  this  culpable  mental  state,  the  plaintiff  may  rely  on
circumstantial  evidence,  including  evidence  of  motive  and  failure  to
adhere to professional standards. When, as in this case, a ﬁnding of
actual  malice  is  based  on  the  republication  of  a  third  party’s
defamatory falsehoods, “failure to investigate before publishing, even
when  a  reasonably  prudent  person  would  have  done  so,  is  not
sufﬁcient.”  Harte-Hanks  Communications  v.  Connaughton,  supra,
491  U.S.  657.  Nonetheless,  the  actual  malice  ﬁnding  may  be  upheld
“where  there  are  obvious  reasons  to  doubt  the  veracity  of  the
informant or the accuracy of his reports” and the republisher failed to
interview obvious witnesses who could have conﬁrmed or disproved
the allegations or to consult relevant documentary sources.

There  were,  to  say  the  least,  obvious  reasons  to  doubt  the
accuracy  of  the  Morrow  book’s  accusation  that  Khawar  killed
Kennedy. The assassination of a nationally prominent politician, in the
midst  of  his  campaign  for  his  party’s  nomination  for  the  presidency,
had been painstakingly and exhaustively investigated by both the FBI
and  state  prosecutorial  agencies.  During  this  massive  investigation,
these  agencies  accumulated  a  vast  quantity  of  evidence  pointing  to
the guilt of Sirhan as the lone assassin. As a result, Sirhan alone was
charged  with  Kennedy’s  murder.  At  Sirhan’s  trial,  “it  was  undisputed
that  [Sirhan]  ﬁred  the  shot  that  killed  Senator  Kennedy”  and  “[t]he
evidence also established conclusively that he shot the victims of the
assault counts.” People v. Sirhan, supra, 7 Cal. 3d 710, 717. The jury
returned a verdict ﬁnding beyond a reasonable doubt that Sirhan was
guilty  of  ﬁrst  degree  murder.  On  Sirhan’s  appeal  from  the  resulting
judgment  of  death,  this  court  carefully  reviewed  the  evidence  and
found  it  sufﬁcient  to  sustain  the  ﬁrst  degree  murder  conviction.  In
asserting  that  Khawar,  and  not  Sirhan,  had  killed  Kennedy,  the
Morrow book was making the highly improbable claim that results of

the  ofﬁcial  investigation,  Sirhan’s  trial,  and  this  court’s  decision  on
Sirhan’s appeal, were all fundamentally mistaken.

Because there were obvious reasons to doubt the accuracy of the
Morrow  book’s  central  claim,  and  because  that  claim  was  an
inherently  defamatory  accusation  against  Khawar,  the  jury  could
properly conclude that Globe acted with actual malice in republishing
that claim if it found also, as it impliedly did, that Globe failed to use
readily  available  means  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  the  claim  by
interviewing  obvious  witnesses  who  could  have  conﬁrmed  or
disproved  the  allegations  or  by  inspecting  relevant  documents  or
other  evidence.  The  evidence  at  trial  supports  the  jury’s  implied
ﬁnding  that  neither  Blackburn  (who  wrote  the  Globe  article)  nor
Globe’s editors made any such effort.

assassination had long ceased to be an issue that urgently engaged
the public’s attention. Before publishing an article accusing a private
ﬁgure of a sensational murder, Globe could well have afforded to take
the  time  necessary  to
investigate  the  matter  with  sufﬁcient
thoroughness  to  form  an  independent  judgment  before  republishing

its  article,

Neither  Blackburn  nor  Globe’s  editors  contacted  any  of  the
eyewitnesses  to  the  assassination,  some  of  whom  were  prominent
individuals  who  could  easily  have  been  located.  At  the  trial,  for
example,  Roosevelt  Grier,  a  well-known  former  professional  football
player  and  volunteer  Kennedy  security  aide  who  was  present  in  the
pantry  area  where  Kennedy  was  shot,  testiﬁed  that  after  the
assassination he had remained active in public life and was not “real
difﬁcult to ﬁnd,” but that no one from Globe had contacted him. As the

[has  held]  “[a]lthough  failure  to
United  States  Supreme  Court
investigate  will  not  alone  support  a  ﬁnding  of  actual  malice,  the
purposeful  avoidance  of  the  truth  is  in  a  different  category.”  [Harte-
Hanks Communications v. Connaughton, 491 U.S. 657, 692.]

Globe argues generally that it had no duty to verify the claims, no
matter  how  improbable,  of  a  prominent  and  responsible  source  like
Morrow,  and  that  as  a  result  its  failure  to  conduct  any  investigation
whatsoever of Morrow’s highly improbable claims does not establish
that  it  acted  with  actual  malice  in  republishing  Morrow’s  accusation
against Khawar. We are not persuaded.

Having  independently  reviewed  the  record,  we  agree  with  the
Court  of  Appeal  that  the  evidence  at  trial  strongly  supports  an
inference that Globe purposefully avoided the truth and published the
Globe  article  despite  serious  doubts  regarding  the  truth  of  the
accusation  against  Khawar.  In  short,  we  conclude  that  clear  and
convincing  evidence  supports  the  jury’s  ﬁnding  that  in  republishing
the Morrow book’s false accusation against Khawar, Globe acted with
actual  malice — that  is,  with  reckless  disregard  of  whether  the
accusation was false or not.

Globe’s challenge to the sufﬁciency of the evidence to support the

ﬁnding of negligence merits little consideration.

Because actual malice is a higher fault standard than negligence,
a  ﬁnding  of  actual  malice  generally  includes  a  ﬁnding  of  negligence,
and evidence that is sufﬁcient to support a ﬁnding of actual malice is
usually, and perhaps invariably, sufﬁcient also to support a ﬁnding of
negligence.  In  any  event,  we  are  satisﬁed  that  the  evidence  we
previously  reviewed,  and  which  we  have  concluded  clearly  and
convincingly  establishes  actual  malice  in  the  form  of  reckless
disregard, is sufﬁcient also to sustain the ﬁnding of negligence.

The judgment of the Court of Appeal is afﬁrmed.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Public Ofﬁcials.  The U.S. Supreme Court has clearly applied the
First  Amendment  to  require  public  ofﬁcials  (and  candidates  for  the
ofﬁce  of  a  public  ofﬁcial)  to  prove  by  clear  and  convincing  evidence
the  falsity  of  the  defamatory  statement  and  the  publisher’s  actual
malice  regarding  the  issue  of  falsity.  Obviously  the  president  of  the
United  States,  any  state’s  governor,  or  other  such  prominent  ofﬁce
holders will qualify as a public ofﬁcial. But how far down the ranks of
government  bureaucrats  will  the  public  ofﬁcial  designation  apply?  In
Rosenblatt  v.  Baer,  383  U.S.  75  (1966),  the  Court  held  in  this  regard:
“[T]he  ‘public  ofﬁcial’  designation  applies  at  the  very  least  to  those
among the hierarchy of government employees who have, or appear
to the public to have, substantial responsibility for or control over the
conduct  of  governmental  affairs.”  Clarifying  further,  the  Court  stated
that  when  the  government  position  has  such  “apparent  importance
that  the  public  has  an  independent  interest  in  the  qualiﬁcations  and
performance  of  the  person  who  holds  it,  beyond  the  general  public
interest  in  the  qualiﬁcations  and  performance  of  all  government
employees”  that  the  public  interest  in  being  able  to  criticize  such
influential  persons  demands  application  of  the  actual  malice
standard.  The  Court  held  in  that  case  that  it  was  possible  that  a
former  supervisor  of  a  county  recreation  area  might  qualify  as  a
public  ofﬁcial,  whereas  the  Court  noted  in  a  footnote  that  a  night
watchman at the Pentagon would not qualify (in a hypothetical case
accusing the night watchman of stealing government secrets). Id. at
86 n.13.

2. Public  vs.  Private  Figures.   The  court  in  Khawar  discussed  the
extension  of  the  actual  malice  standard  to  plaintiffs  who  were  not
government ofﬁce holders, yet who were considered public figures —
individuals  who  generally  thrust  themselves  into  the  limelight  and
who had sufﬁcient access to the media (before being defamed). The
court  held  that  they  could  protect  their  own  reputation  through
making  their  personal  defense  to  the  media.  With  respect  to  public
ﬁgures, the courts have further determined that there are some who

are  so  famous  that  they  would  be  considered  a  public  ﬁgure
regardless  of  the  subject  matter  of  the  defamatory  statements.
figures  tend  to  be  one-name
These  general-purpose  public
household celebrities who get attention whenever they want and for
any  purpose.  Can  you  imagine  such  people?  Courts  have  also
recognized  that  some  people  are  well  known  but  only  regarding
particular issues or matters. These are often people, such as Dr. Jack
Kervorkian, who may have been well known, but only in the context of
particular  issues  of  debate  or  policy.  If  Dr.  Kervorkian  had  tried  to
schedule  a  press  conference  to  discuss  his  views  on  the  Internal
Revenue  Code,  would  anyone  have  shown  up?  With  regard  to  these
limited  purpose  public  figures,  the  actual  malice  rules  only  apply
when  the  subject  of  the  defamatory  speech  relates  to  the  issue  for
which  they  are  famous.  Otherwise,  they  would  be  considered  a
private ﬁgure.

3. Private Figures Defamed by Speech Concerning Public Matters.
Reflecting  the  delicate  balance  between  the  First  Amendment’s
concern  with  protecting  important  speech  and  the  interest  of  the
states and defamation victims in protecting reputation, the Supreme
Court in Gertz v. Robert Welch, 418 U.S. 323 (1974) and the court in
Khawar  have  held  that  with  respect  to  a  private  plaintiff’s  suit  for
defamation where the speech related to matters of legitimate public
importance,  actual  malice  would  be  required  in  order  to  justify  an
award of either punitive damages or presumed, general damages but
that any lower level of fault (i.e., ordinary negligence) could justify an
award  of  actual  damages.  Applying  these  standards  to  the  re-
publication  by  the  defendant  in  Khawar,  why  did  the  court  ﬁnd  that
the jury’s various awards were consistent with the First Amendment?

Idaho J.I. 4.82 Elements of Defamation

In order to prove a claim of defamation, the plaintiff has the

burden of proving each of the following elements:
communicated
defendant

1.  The

information

concerning the plaintiff to others; and

2.  The  information  impugned  the  honesty,  integrity,
virtue  or  reputation  of  the  plaintiff  or  exposed  the  plaintiff
to public hatred, contempt or ridicule; and
3. The information was false; and

4.  The  plaintiff  suffered  actual  injury  because  of  the

defamation; and

5. The amount of damages suffered by the plaintiff.

2. Private Matters

Until  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court’s  decision  in  Dun  &  Bradstreet,  First
Amendment  jurisprudence  regarding  defamation  suits  contained  a
blind spot in the area of suits brought by private plaintiffs on matters
that did not seem to implicate matters of signiﬁcant public interest. In
Khawar,  while  the  plaintiff  was  a  private  ﬁgure,  the  subject  of  the
defamatory speech concerned a matter of great public interest — who
shot  a  U.S.  presidential  candidate.  What  if  the  private  plaintiff  was
defamed  by  speech  that  was  not  so  noteworthy?  Did  the  First
Amendment still put limitations on a court’s ability to award damages
based upon the defendant’s speech?

DUN & BRADSTREET, INC. v. GREENMOSS
BUILDERS, INC.
472 U.S. 749 (1985)

      , J.

In  Gertz,  we  held  that  the  First  Amendment  restricted  the
damages that a private individual could obtain from a publisher for a
libel  that  involved  a  matter  of  public  concern.  More  speciﬁcally,  we
held  that  in  these  circumstances  the  First  Amendment  prohibited
awards of presumed and punitive damages for false and defamatory
statements  unless  the  plaintiff  shows  “actual  malice,”  that
is,
knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth. The question
presented in this case is whether this rule of Gertz applies when the

false  and  defamatory  statements  do  not  involve  matters  of  public
concern.

Petitioner  Dun  &  Bradstreet,  a  credit-reporting  agency,  provides
subscribers with ﬁnancial and related information about businesses.
All the information is conﬁdential; under the terms of the subscription
agreement the subscribers may not reveal it to anyone else. On July
26,  1976,  petitioner  sent  a  report  to  ﬁve  subscribers  indicating  that
respondent,  a  construction  contractor,  had  ﬁled  a  voluntary  petition
for  bankruptcy.  This  report  was  false  and  grossly  misrepresented
respondent’s  assets  and  liabilities.  That  same  day,  while  discussing
its  bank,  respondent’s
the  possibility  of  future  ﬁnancing  with
president was told that the bank had received the defamatory report.
He immediately called petitioner’s regional ofﬁce, explained the error,
and asked for a correction. In addition, he requested the names of the
ﬁrms that had received the false report in order to assure them that
the company was solvent. Petitioner promised to look into the matter
but  refused  to  divulge  the  names  of  those  who  had  received  the
report.

After  determining  that  its  report  was  indeed  false,  petitioner
issued  a  corrective  notice  on  or  about  August  3,  1976,  to  the  ﬁve
subscribers who had received the initial report. The notice stated that
one of respondent’s former employees, not respondent itself, had ﬁled
for bankruptcy and that respondent “continued in business as usual.”
Respondent told petitioner that it was dissatisﬁed with the notice, and
it again asked for a list of subscribers who had seen the initial report.
Again petitioner refused to divulge their names.

Respondent then brought this defamation action in Vermont state
court.  It  alleged  that  the  false  report  had  injured  its  reputation  and
sought  both  compensatory  and  punitive  damages.  The  trial
established that the error in petitioner’s report had been caused when
one of its employees, a 17-year-old high school student paid to review
Vermont  bankruptcy  pleadings,  had
inadvertently  attributed  to
respondent a bankruptcy petition ﬁled by one of respondent’s former

employees.  Although  petitioner’s  representative  testiﬁed  that  it  was
routine  practice  to  check  the  accuracy  of  such  reports  with  the
businesses  themselves,  it  did  not  try  to  verify  the  information  about
respondent before reporting it.

After  trial,  the  jury  returned  a  verdict  in  favor  of  respondent  and
awarded  $50,000  in  compensatory  or  presumed  damages  and
$300,000  in  punitive  damages.  Petitioner  moved  for  a  new  trial.  It
argued that in Gertz, this Court had ruled broadly that “the States may
not permit recovery of presumed or punitive damages, at least when
liability is not based on a showing of knowledge of falsity or reckless
disregard for the truth,” and it argued that the judge’s instructions in
this  case  permitted  the  jury  to  award  such  damages  on  a  lesser
showing.

[The  trial  court  granted  the  motion  for  new  trial  but  the  Vermont
Supreme Court reversed this order.] It held that the balance between a
private  plaintiff’s  right  to  recover  presumed  and  punitive  damages
without a showing of special fault and the First Amendment rights of
“nonmedia”  speakers  “must  be  struck  in  favor  of  the  private  plaintiff
defamed by a nonmedia defendant.” Accordingly, the court held “that
as  a  matter  of  federal  constitutional  law,  the  media  protections
outlined in Gertz are inapplicable to nonmedia defamation actions.”

Recognizing  disagreement  among  the  lower  courts  about  when
the protections of Gertz  apply,  we  granted  certiorari.  We  now  afﬁrm,
although for reasons different from those relied upon by the Vermont
Supreme Court.

We  have  never  considered  whether  the  Gertz  balance  obtains
when the defamatory statements involve no issue of public concern.
To make this determination, we must employ the approach approved
in  Gertz  and  balance  the  State’s  interest  in  compensating  private
individuals for injury to their reputation against the First Amendment
interest  in  protecting  this  type  of  expression.  This  state  interest  is

identical  to  the  one  weighed  in  Gertz.  There  we  found  that  it  was
“strong and legitimate.”

The  First  Amendment

interest,  on  the  other  hand,

less
important  than  the  one  weighed  in  Gertz.  We  have  long  recognized
that  not  all  speech  is  of  equal  First  Amendment  importance.  It  is
speech on “matters of public concern” that is “at the heart of the First
Amendment’s  protection.”  First  National  Bank  of  Boston  v.  Bellotti,
435 U.S. 765, 776 (1978).

is

As  a  number  of  state  courts,  including  the  court  below,  have
recognized, the role of the Constitution in regulating state libel law is
far  more  limited  when  the  concerns  that  activated  New  York  Times
and Gertz are absent. In such a case,

[there]  is  no  threat  to  the  free  and  robust  debate  of  public  issues;  there  is  no
potential  interference  with  a  meaningful  dialogue  of  ideas  concerning  self-
government;  and  there  is  no  threat  of  liability  causing  a  reaction  of  self-
censorship  by  the  press.  The  facts  of  the  present  case  are  wholly  without  the
First Amendment concerns with which the Supreme Court of the United States
has been struggling.

Harley-Davidson  Motorsports,  Inc.  v.  Markley,  568  P.2d  1359,  1363
(Ore. 1977).

While  such  speech

is  not  totally  unprotected  by  the  First
Amendment, its protections are less stringent. In Gertz, we found that
the  state  interest  in  awarding  presumed  and  punitive  damages  was
not “substantial” in view of their effect on speech at the core of First
Amendment  concern.  This  interest,  however,  is  “substantial”  relative
to  the  incidental  effect  these  remedies  may  have  on  speech  of
signiﬁcantly
interest.  The  rationale  of  the
common-law rules has been the experience and judgment of history
that “proof of actual damage will be impossible in a great many cases
where,  from  the  character  of  the  defamatory  words  and  the
circumstances  of  publication,  it  is  all  but  certain  that  serious  harm
has  resulted  in  fact.”  W.  Prosser,  Law  of  Torts  §112,  p.  765  (4th  ed.

less  constitutional

1971). As a result, courts for centuries have allowed juries to presume
that  some  damage  occurred  from  many  defamatory  utterances  and
in  providing
publications.  This  rule  furthers  the  state
remedies  for  defamation  by  ensuring  that  those  remedies  are
effective.  In  light  of  the  reduced  constitutional  value  of  speech
involving no matters of public concern, we hold that the state interest
adequately  supports  awards  of  presumed  and  punitive  damages —
even absent a showing of “actual malice.”

interest

The  only  remaining  issue  is  whether  petitioner’s  credit  report
involved a matter of public concern. In a related context, we have held
that “[whether] . . . speech addresses a matter of public concern must
be determined by [the expression’s] content, form, and context . . . as
revealed by the whole record.” These factors indicate that petitioner’s
credit  report  concerns  no  public  issue.  It  was  speech  solely  in  the
individual interest of the speaker and its speciﬁc business audience.
This  particular  interest  warrants  no  special  protection  when — as  in
this  case — the  speech  is  wholly  false  and  clearly  damaging  to  the
victim’s  business  reputation.  Moreover,  since  the  credit  report  was
made available to only ﬁve subscribers, who, under the terms of the
subscription agreement, could not disseminate it further, it cannot be
said  that  the  report  involves  any  “strong  interest  in  the  free  flow  of
commercial  information.”  There  is  simply  no  credible  argument  that
this type of credit reporting requires special protection to ensure that
“debate on public issues [will] be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open.”

In addition, the speech here, like advertising, is hardy and unlikely
to be deterred by incidental state regulation. It is solely motivated by
the desire for proﬁt, which, we have noted, is a force less likely to be
deterred  than  others.  Arguably,  the  reporting  here  was  also  more
objectively  veriﬁable  than  speech  deserving  of  greater  protection.  In
any  case,  the  market  provides  a  powerful  incentive  to  a  credit-
reporting agency to be accurate, since false credit reporting is of no
use  to  creditors.  Thus,  any  incremental  “chilling”  effect  of  libel  suits
would be of decreased signiﬁcance.

We  conclude  that  permitting  recovery  of  presumed  and  punitive
damages  in  defamation  cases  absent  a  showing  of  “actual  malice”
does  not  violate  the  First  Amendment  when  the  defamatory
statements do not involve matters of public concern. Accordingly, we
afﬁrm the judgment of the Vermont Supreme Court.

It is so ordered.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Wholly  Without  First  Amendment  Concerns.   Citing  prior  case
law that characterized purely private speech as being “wholly without
First  Amendment  concerns,”  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court  held  in  Dun  &
Bradstreet that, in such instances, the private plaintiff need not prove
actual malice even to recover presumed or punitive damages (unless
state  law  requires  it).  The  Court  did  not  address  whether  any  fault
was  required,  as  a  matter  of  constitutional  interest  balancing,  to
recover presumed or punitive damages. Some commentators believe
that an argument exists that at least a negligence standard would still
be required by the First Amendment in all defamation cases — but the
Court  has  never  reached  this  holding.  As  of  today,  whether  a  state
should always require some level of fault in a defamation suit is left to
the states themselves as a matter of their common or statutory law.
Different  states  have  reached  different  conclusions  with  some
embracing  the  traditional  common  law  view  of  strict  liability  (for
example, look at the Idaho pattern jury charge at the end of the prior
subsection)  and  others  requiring  negligence  for  any  recovery  of
damages  by  a  defamation  plaintiff.  Do  you  have  an  opinion  as  to
whether  it  is  better  policy  to  require  some  level  of  fault  in  any
defamation case or do you believe that when you intentionally publish
a defamatory statement about another that you should bear the risk
of your statement’s falsity?

2.  Problems.   Does  the  following  defamatory  speech  concern  a

public or a purely private matter?

A. Plaintiff sues a local radio station because its disc jockey falsely
stated  on  the  air  that  plaintiff,  a  janitor  in  town,  was  the  likely
culprit  in  a  series  of  robberies  that  had  been  committed  at
businesses where plaintiff had accounts.

B.  Plaintiff,  a  restaurant  owner,  sues  the  defendant,  a  former
customer  at  the  restaurant,  of  falsely  stating  on  Yelp’s  Internet
restaurant review site that the plaintiff’s restaurant had “mold in
the ice machine.”

C.  Plaintiff  is  the  former  spouse  of  the  defendant  who  stood
outside the plaintiff’s residence during their divorce proceedings,
with a hand-made sign stating “Cheater!”

Upon Further Review

Defamation  claims  demonstrate  the  full  array  of  different  tort
levels of fault. At common law, defamation required no showing
of  fault  against  the  defendant  so
long  as  she  published
defamatory  statements  concerning  the  plaintiff.  One  who
published negative statements about another took the risk that if
the information was wrong they would have to compensate the
plaintiff  for  any  recoverable  damages  to  reputation.  When  the
law has determined, however, that the nature of the speech was
important enough to deserve some protection, the common law
created  both  absolute  and  qualiﬁed  privileges  for  the  publisher.
Whether an absolute or qualiﬁed privilege would attach reflected
the  law’s  view  on  how  critical  the  nature  of  the  communication
tended  to  be  considered;  speech  necessary  for  the  effective
operation  of  the  affairs  of  government  or  a  married  couple’s
household  has  received  maximum  protection.  For  such  speech,
even  actual  malice  by  the  publisher  will  not  create  defamation

liability.  For  conditional  privileges,  both  at  common  law  and
under  the  actual  malice  standard  of  the  First  Amendment,  the
courts  have  determined  that  while  the  speech  is  deserving  of
some  protection,  that  protection  can  be  lost  and  recovery
permitted  for  defamation  when  the  circumstances  of  the

potential  chilling  effect  on  the  speech  by  imposition  of  a
monetary  judgment.  As  of  now,  whether  any  level  of  fault  is
required  for  purely  private  speech  having  no  First  Amendment
connection,  is  a  matter  left  to  the  various  state  courts  and
legislatures.

instances,

interest

6.  In  the  present  case  evidence  of  the  precise  “method”  used  to  publish  the
charge “opening company mail” was sorely lacking. The only thing clear is that the
words at one point were expressed in print in a warning letter. Perhaps in reliance
on this one certain fact, the court and parties throughout have treated this as a libel
case.  To  avoid  unwarranted  complexity,  we  will  continue  to  do  so.  The  approach
makes sense, considering the libelous form of the warning letter and the rule that
subsequent  oral  repetition  of  a  libel  does  not  change  it  to  slander  and  vice  versa.
We are told that the substantive differences between the law of libel and the law of
slander are relics of the ancient past serving no useful purpose, but to this day they
wield  dead-hand  influence  over  the  law  of  defamation.  Nowhere  is  the  pervasive,
perverse  sway  of  the  distinction  more  evident  than  where  “per  se”  enters  the
discussion.

V. Distinguishing Tort vs. Contract Claims

I  INTRODUCTION

The  claims  we  have  studied  thus  far  involve  torts  that  manifest
themselves  chiefly  in  terms  of  causing  personal  injuries  or  property
damage  rather  than  purely  economic  injuries.  Assaults,  batteries,
false imprisonments, defamation, and product liability claims typically
involve  harm  to  the  claimant’s  body  and/or  mind.  Trespass  and
conversion  involve  harm  to  the  claimant’s  property.  And  negligence
can  give  rise  to  either  type  of  physical  injury — to  one’s  body  or
property. In any of these various claims there may also be economic
injuries  (i.e.,  special  damages)  but  those  are  secondary  to  the
physical  harm  caused  by  the  tort.  For  example,  a  woman  physically
injured in a car accident may also be unable to work for some period
of time and lose income. Were we to end our coverage of tort law at
this point, we would be missing a whole branch of tort law involving
misconduct  arising  in  business  transactions  that  results  in  purely
economic harms.

A burgeoning area of tort law involves the common law’s adoption
and  application  of  tort  claims  that  tend  to  arise  in  business
transactions.  The  losses  in  these  circumstances  typically  involve
ﬁnancial injury alone. There are many such tort causes of action and,
indeed,  there  are  entire  elective  classes  in  law  schools  devoted  to
exploring  the  nuances  of  the  many  types  of  common  law  business
torts.  For  brevity’s  sake,  we  will  conﬁne  ourselves  to  an  introduction
to  some  of  the  stalwart  theories  of  recovery  in  this  ﬁeld — fraud,
negligent  misrepresentation,  and  tortious  interference  with  contract
or  prospective  business  relations.  We  will  conclude,  ﬁnally,  with
consideration  of  a  key  issue  that  can  arise  in  many  business  tort
cases — when  the  defendant’s  actionable  conduct  that  gives  rise  to
the  tort  claim  also  involves  the  breach  of  an  agreement,  should  the
court  recognize  a  tort  claim  or  limit  the  scope  of  the  action  to  a

breach  of  contract  recovery?  In  this  manner,  we  ironically  end  up
coming  full  circle  with  the  beginning  of  this  textbook.  We  will
conclude with the question, “What is a tort?”

business
right  to  recover  for  fraud  is
premised  upon  the  notion  of  a
right  to  trust  or  rely  upon
certain  statements  or  assurances  from  others.  Fraud  is  recognized
across  many  areas  of  the  law  and  can  yield  varying  remedies  and
results. In a breach of contract action, for example, a defendant might
plead  fraud  as  an  afﬁrmative  defense  to  enforcement  of  the
obligation.  In  a  federal  bankruptcy  matter,  a  creditor  might  prove  a
fraudulent transaction as a basis to avoid the extinguishment of the
debtor’s  liability.  We  saw  in  Chapter  7,  Afﬁrmative  Defenses,  that
fraudulent concealment can be pled as a way to escape the impact of
a  statute  of  limitations  or  statute  of  repose  defense.  Fraud  can  also
be used afﬁrmatively to seek a rescission of a contract. Our focus will
be upon a claimant pleading the tort claim of common law fraud in an
effort  to  recover  for  economic  losses  associated  with  a  business
transaction.

A. Misrepresentations

All fraud claims involve proof of a misrepresentation by the defendant
to the plaintiff, typically to induce the plaintiff into entering a contract.
Of  course,  many  sales  pitches  involve  nuanced  representations  that
might  be  called  into  question  long  after  the  consummation  of  a
business deal. Courts are sensitive to not allowing “buyer’s remorse”

to  give  rise  to  easy  claims  for  fraud  and,  therefore,  the  commonly
understood  elements  of  a  fraud  claim  take  this  hesitation  into
account.  There  are  volumes  of  case  reporters  ﬁlled  with  opinions
trying  to  determine  if  the  defendant’s  words  or  actions  might  be
considered  an  actionable  misrepresentation.  We  will  begin  our  foray
into fraud by examining different types of misrepresentation that can
be considered fraudulent.

TRENHOLM v.
RATCLIFF

“There are three things in the
world that deserve no mercy —
hypocrisy, fraud, and tyranny.”

Frederick W. Robertson.

646 S.W.2d 927 (Tex. 1983)

      , J.

Trenholm,  a  homebuilder,  sued  Ratcliff,  a  developer  [for  common

law fraud].

The  cause  before  us  involves  the  appeal  from  the  trial  for  fraud.
After the jury returned its answers to the special issues, both parties
moved  for  judgment  on  the  verdict,  and  Ratcliff,  in  the  alternative,
ﬁled  a  motion  for  judgment  non  obstante  veredicto.  The  trial  court
rendered judgment for Ratcliff, and rendered a take nothing judgment
against  Trenholm.  The  court  of  appeals  afﬁrmed  the  judgment,
holding  the  evidence  established,  as  a  matter  of  law,  that  Trenholm
did not rely on Ratcliff’s representations. We reverse the judgment of
the court of appeals and render judgment for plaintiff Trenholm.

George  and  Robert  Trenholm  were  the  principal  stockholders  in
Oxford  Building  Systems,  a  corporation  engaged  in  the  building  of
custom homes. Robert sold his interest to George prior to the ﬁling of
this  lawsuit.  Respondent,  Raymond  Ratcliff  is  the  principal  owner  of
Ratcliff Investments and Ramahal Development Corporation.

Ratcliff,  a  land  developer,  entered  into  a  joint  venture  agreement
with  Richardson  Savings  &  Loan  to  develop  and  sell  lots  in  the
Greenhollow  subdivision  in  West  Plano,  Texas.  In  November  1975,
Ratcliff  held  a  “draw  meeting”  to  solicit  local  builders.  The  meeting
was attended by several builders, including George Trenholm. At the
meeting Ratcliff discussed the Greenhollow development, and invited
in  the  subdivision.  During  the
the  builders  to  purchase
presentation,  Ratcliff  stated  a  mobile  home  park  located  near
Greenhollow would be a future shopping center. At the conclusion of
his presentation, Ratcliff invited questions. George Trenholm asked:

lots

Ray,  you  talked  in,  around  and  about  this  mobile  home  park  through  your
presentation, and you deﬁnitely left me with the impression that its going to be

moved, but before I buy any lots I speciﬁcally want to know what disposition is
going to be made on that property.

Ratcliff answered:

Don’t  worry  about  it,  that’s  zoned  commercial,  and  that  property  has  already
been  sold.  Those  people  have  been  notiﬁed  that  their  leases  will  not  be
renewed,  so  the  park  should  close  up  sometime  in  April  and  after  that,  why,
after they get everything moved out over there, they will come in and bulldoze it
down so by June or July it will be like there’s never been a park there, and that
will coincide actually just ﬁne with the grand opening out there.

Trenholm built eighteen houses in the Greenhollow development.
Six houses were built for his account, and twelve were built pursuant
to  a  joint  venture  with  Richardson  Savings  &  Loan.  Richardson
Savings & Loan would furnish the money, and Trenholm would build
and  sell  the  houses.  The  proﬁts  or  losses  of  the  joint  venture  would
be split 50/50 between them.

The  mobile  home  park  was  not  owned  by  Ratcliff  or  by
Richardson  Savings  &  Loan,  but  rather  by  a  third  party.  The  mobile
home  park  was  not  moved  by  the  time  the  houses  were  completed
for  sale.  The  Greenhollow  subdivision  did  poorly,  and  on  June  23,
1976,  a  meeting  was  held  by  Ratcliff  to  discuss  the  slow  sales.
Trenholm  asked  about  the  continued  presence  of  the  mobile  home
park, and he was told that the park would not be moved. The houses
were  ultimately  sold  at  a  net  loss,  and  Trenholm  settled  his  joint
venture losses with Richardson Savings & Loan.

In  the  trial  for  common  law  fraud  the  jury  found:  (1)  that  Ratcliff
made false representations to Trenholm as to material facts with the
intent  to  induce  Trenholm  to  purchase  Greenhollow  lots,  and  which
were  relied  on  by  Trenholm;  (2)  that  the  representations  concerning
the trailer park were not known by Ratcliff to be false, but were made
recklessly and with a purported special knowledge; (3) that the false
representations  were  made  with  malice;  (4)  that  Trenholm  did  not
waive  his  claim  against  Ratcliff;  (5)  that  Trenholm  could  not  have

discovered  the  falsity  of  the  false  representation  by  reasonable
investigation; (6) that Trenholm suffered $68,750 out-of-pocket losses
on the six Oxford homes, $37,500 lost net proﬁts on the twelve joint
venture homes and $37,500 lost net proﬁts on the Oxford homes; and
(7)  that  $250,000  exemplary  damages  should  be  awarded.  Both
parties  moved  for  judgment  on  the  verdict.  Ratcliff  contended  the
jury’s ﬁnding of recklessness would not support a cause of action for
fraud.  In  the  alternative,  Ratcliff  asked  for  judgment  non  obstante
veredicto.  The  trial  court  rendered  judgment  for  Ratcliff  and  that
Trenholm take nothing.

The  trial  court’s  take  nothing  judgment,  as  we  construe  it,  was
based  on  one  of  two  grounds:  that  a  ﬁnding  of  recklessness  would
not support a cause of action for fraud concerning a future prediction,
or  that  there  was  no  evidence  to  support  the  jury  ﬁndings  in
Trenholm’s favor.

Ratcliff contends the necessary elements of a common law fraud
action have not been established, and therefore, the jury verdict does
not  support  a  judgment  for  Trenholm.  The  elements  of  actionable
fraud  in  Texas  were  stated  in  Wilson  v.  Jones,  45  S.W.2d  572,  574
(Tex. Comm. App. 1932, holding app’d) as follows:

(1) that a material representation was made; (2) that it was false; (3) that, when
the  speaker  made  it,  he  knew  it  was  false  or  made  it  recklessly  without  any
knowledge of its truth and as a positive assertion; (4) that he made it with the
intention  that  it  should  be  acted  upon  by  the  party;  (5)  that  the  party  acted  in
reliance upon it; and (6) that he thereby suffered injury.

Ratcliff  argues  the  “trailer  park  representations”  are  matters  of
opinion or predictions of future events, and therefore, Trenholm must
prove that Ratcliff knew they were false at the time they were made.
The  jury,  in  answer  to  special  issue  number  two  did  not  ﬁnd  that
Ratcliff  knew  his  representations  were  false.  Ratcliff  argues,
therefore, he could not and did not make fraudulent representations.

Pure  expressions  of  opinion  are  not  actionable.  It  has  been  held
that a representation, to be actionable, must be a representation of a
material fact. Wilson v. Jones, supra at 574; W. Prosser, Law of Torts
§109  at  p.  720-724  (4th  ed.  1971).  There  are  exceptions  to  this
general  rule  that  an  expression  of  an  opinion  cannot  support  an
action  for  fraud.  An  opinion  may  constitute  fraud  if  the  speaker  has
knowledge  of  its  falsity.  An  expression  of  an  opinion  as  to  the
happening  of  a  future  event  may  also  constitute  fraud  where  the
speaker purports to have special knowledge of facts that will occur or
exist in the future. Additionally, when an opinion is based on past or
present facts, an action for fraud may be maintained. Thus, the Texas
courts have held a jury ﬁnding of recklessness or special knowledge
establishes a basis for fraud in the last two exceptions.

Ratcliff’s  representation  was  not  merely  an  expression  of  an
opinion that the trailer park would be moved in the future. He falsely
represented that the trailer park had been sold, and that notices had
been given to the tenants. These are direct representations of present
facts,  which  are  so  intertwined  with  his  future  prediction  that  the
whole statement amounts to a representation of facts. A jury ﬁnding

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Elements  of  Fraud.   Most  courts  have  long  agreed  the  basic
elements  of  a  fraud  consist  of  the  following:  (a)  a  material
misrepresentation,  (b)  falsity,  (c)  that  was  made  with  knowledge  of
the  falsity  or  in  reckless  disregard  of  the  truth,  (d)  intending  for  the
plaintiff  to  rely  upon  the  misrepresentation,  (e)  actual  and  justiﬁable
(or  reasonable)  reliance  by  the  plaintiff,  and  (f)  actual  harm  suffered
by the plaintiff in relying upon the misrepresentation. Courts adopted
this  cause  of  action  with  business  transactions  in  mind,  though

occasionally you can ﬁnd a court willing to consider its application to
claims for personal injury. See generally Jane Doe v. Elizabeth Dilling,
888 N.E.2d 24 (Ill. 2008) (discussing the possible application of fraud
to  a  ﬁancée’s  contracting  HIV).  The  primary  issues  in  the  foregoing
Trenholm  case  were  whether  an  actionable  misrepresentation  had
occurred and whether recklessness would sufﬁce as adequate mens
rea. How did the court resolve those concerns?

falsity  often

2.  Scienter  Needed  for  Fraud.   Traditionally  courts  state  that  the
scienter necessary to hold a defendant liable for damages in a fraud
case involves either knowledge of the falsity of the representation or
recklessness  regarding  the  issue  of  falsity.  As  you  may  recall  from
Chapter 12, Defamation, this is what is referred to as actual malice in
the context of the First Amendment’s application to libel and slander
involving  public  ofﬁcials  and  public  ﬁgures.  Proof  of
actions
knowledge  of
involves  circumstantial  proof  of
information, or other statements by the defendant, such that the jury
can  conclude  that  the  defendant  must  have  known  that  his
representation was untrue at the time of making it. With regard to the
alternative  standard  of  recklessness,  proof  that  the  defendant  had
sufﬁcient
the
representation to cast signiﬁcant doubt on the truth of the statement
can  be  considered  adequate  to  uphold  a  jury  verdict.  Lacking
evidence to support either form of scienter, a claimant might consider
negligent  misrepresentation,  covered  in  the  next  section  of  this
chapter, as a possible alternative claim.

3.  Availability  of  Punitive  Damages.   Because  the  common  law
requires  proof  of  the  defendant  stating  a  known  falsehood  or  being
reckless about it, courts have long allowed juries to consider punitive
damages  in  common  law  fraud  actions.  Perhaps  fearing  that  it  was
too  easy  to  allege  a  misrepresentation  and  to  engage  in  punitive
damage  discovery,  the  drafters  of  Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  9
(governing the pleading of fraud claims) have required that claims for
fraud  be  plead  with  “particularity.”  This  is  typically  considered  to

include  pleading  the  speciﬁc  misrepresentation,  the  name  and
circumstances  of  the  speaker  making  the  statement,  the  facts
demonstrating  why  the  statement  was  false,  as  well  as  the  other
elements  of  the  claim.  What  is  it  about  an  act  of  fraud  that  has  led
courts to universally permit punitive damages when it is proven?

4. Opinions vs. Facts.  As the court discusses in Trenholm, courts
have  also  been  willing  in  the  right  context  to  permit  a  fraud  claim
based  upon  a  misrepresented  opinion,  but  these  are  limited  to
speciﬁc  varieties:  (a)  false  opinion  as  to  future  events  when  the
speaker  claims  to  have  special  insight,  (b)  opinions  given  that  are
insincere,  and  (c)  opinions  that  are  premised  upon  past  or  present
facts  when  these  underlying  facts  are  false.  Which  of  these  was
involved in Trenholm?  Outside  of  these  three  exceptional  categories,
courts  reject  fraud  claims  that  are  premised  solely  upon  pure
opinions  stated  by  the  defendant.  What  is  it  about  an  opinion  that
would lead to this conclusion?

5. Puffery as a Form of Opinion.  Sometimes the defendant is sued
for  making  statements  designed  to  “puff  up”  the  perceived  value  of
the subject of the contemplated transaction. The use of adjectives in
the negotiations often leads to inquiry as to whether the statements
could  be  considered  potentially  false  statements  of  fact  or  mere
opinions that should not be actionable. Use of phrases such as “ﬁne,”
“ﬁrst-class,”  “land  of  gold,”  “a  hot  buy,”  a  “good  one,”  “excellent,”  and
“perfect”  raise  such  an  issue.  If  the  court  concludes  that  the
statement is a mere opinion, it will refer to it as “puffery” and dismiss
the fraud claim. See, e.g., Miller v. William Chevrolet, 762 N.E.2d 1 (Ill.
App. Ct. 2001) (“pufﬁng is deﬁned as a bare and naked statement as
to value of a product and is considered a nonactionable assertion of
opinion”). Frankly, a survey of cases involving this issue reveals courts
within the same jurisdictions that are often inconsistent in analyzing
such  adjectives.  Compare,  e.g.,  Pennington  v.  Singleton,  606  S.W.2d
682  (Tex.  1980)  (“excellent”  was  a  representation  of  fact),  with
Buckingham v. Thompson, 135 S.W. 652 (Tex. Civ. App. 1911, no writ)

(“good  one”  was  mere  puffery).  In  cases  where  there  is  doubt  as  to
whether  the  representation  amounted  to  a  factual  statement  or
puffery,  the  court  will  submit  the  issue  to  a  jury  with  an  instruction
along the lines that “puffery is an expression of opinion by a seller not
made as a representation of fact.” One scholar lamented the lack of a
coherent legal analysis of this issue:

We  are  constantly  exposed  to  speech  .  .  .  encouraging  us  to  buy
goods, invest in stocks, and transact for services. This speech is
often intentionally misleading, is usually vivid and memorable, and
induces  many  of  us  to  rely  upon  it.  But  the  law,  which  normally
punishes  lies  for  proﬁt,  encourages  this  speech  by  immunizing  it
as
important
defense  .  .  .  in  common  law  settings,  resulting  in  thousands  of
citations  in  cases  and  law  reviews.  However,  puffery  doctrine,  a
major  element  of  the  law  of  fraud  .  .  .  is  missing  an  explanatory
theory.

6. Problems.  Would the following circumstances seem to involve
actionable claims for common law fraud? In each, consider carefully
the  nature  of  the  alleged  misrepresentation  and  why  it  may  or  may
not  qualify  as  sufﬁcient.  What  issues  regarding  the  fairness  of
permitting a fraud claim might exist in each situation?

A. Nadine goes to a used car lot to purchase a 2005 BMW 3-Series
that has 85,000 miles. The dealer offers it to her for $15,000 and
says, “This is a better deal than you’ll ﬁnd anywhere else in the
city. I just need to clear my lot to make room for some additional
inventory.” Nadine buys the car at the requested price. Later that
day,  she  decides  to  look  online  at  used  cars  and,  much  to  her
dismay, ﬁnds similar BMWs for several thousand dollars less.

B.  Barney  agrees  to  buy  an  outline  for  a  torts  class  from  a  more
senior student who claims to have received the highest grade in
her  prior  torts  class.  After  buying  her  outline,  Barney  discovers
that  she  did  not  have  the  highest  grade  in  the  class  but  still
received an “A.”

C.  Carlos  goes  to  a  famous  chain  restaurant  and  orders  a  pork
chop dinner that has a heart symbol next to it. At the bottom of
the  menu  it  indicates  that  meals  with  a  heart  symbol  are
“carefully  prepared  with  customers’  health
in  mind.”  After
purchasing  and  eating  the  meal,  Carlos  later  is  bothered  when
he discovers that his dinner had more fat and calories than a Big
Mac.

D.  Travis  owns  a  trucking  company  and  is  negotiating  to  sell  it
because he is tired of dealing with increased federal regulations
and having to provide health insurance for his employees. These
things  make  it  difﬁcult  for  Travis  to  meet  his  payroll  many
months,  though  he  has  always  managed  to  get  by  with  some
occasional cash advances from his banker. During negotiations
the buyer, Bill, asks if there are any “cash flow problems,” which
Travis  denies.  After  the  sale  of  the  business,  Bill  decides  the
company cannot make a proﬁt and sues Travis.

2. Afﬁrmative Acts of Concealment

The  obvious  claim  for  fraud  involves  the  verbally  expressed  lie.  But
courts have also recognized circumstances where fraud arises out of
the unspoken word or action. In other words, silence can sometimes
constitute  fraud.  In  the  Lindberg Cadillac  case  below,  the  plaintiff  is
not able to point to an express misrepresentation by the defendant. At
ﬁrst  glance,  it  would  appear  that  no  claim  for  fraud  would  be
recognized. Yet the court below treats the deceitful conduct as being
another type of actionable misrepresentation.

LINDBERG CADILLAC CO. v. ARON
371 S.W.2d 651 (Mo. 1963)

     , J.

This is an action in fraud in which the defendant is charged by the
plaintiff with concealing defects in an automobile, which he traded to
plaintiff in part payment of the purchase price of a new car, which the
plaintiff  sold  to  him.  The  trial  was  to  the  court,  which  found  for  the
plaintiff in the sum of $759.00 and costs. After an unavailing motion
for a new trial, the defendant appealed.

The plaintiff company was engaged in the sale of automobiles. Its
business  was  located  in  the  City  of  St.  Louis.  The  defendant  was  in
the vending machine business in St. Louis. He had some trucks and a
Cadillac and Imperial automobiles, which he used in connection with
his business.

He  decided  to  trade  in  his  1957  Imperial  on  another  Cadillac.  In
June  of  1959  the  Imperial  was  brought  into  the  plaintiff’s  place  of
business and was appraised by the sales manager in charge of such
work.  He  examined  the  automobile  and  appraised  its  value  to  be
$2,165 at that time. No deal was made then because the parties were
unable to reach a trade-in ﬁgure that was agreeable to both.

In  the  month  of  October,  1959,  during  a  cold  spell,  the  coolant  in
the  Imperial  froze.  The  car  was  taken  to  a  ﬁlling  station  which  Aron,
the  defendant,  patronized.  According  to  the  testimony  of  the  ﬁlling
station operator, defendant told him that the motor had frozen and he
wanted it checked to see if it had cracked. The ﬁlling station operator
thawed out the motor and placed the car on a grease rack to check it
over. He testiﬁed that he found two cracks on each side of the motor
block.  He  said  that  he  told  Aron,  the  defendant,  that  the  block  was
cracked.  He  estimated  the  cost  of  a  new  block  to  be  in  the
neighborhood  of  four  or  ﬁve  hundred  dollars.  He  told  Aron  that  he
could put a “K and W sealer” in the cracks, but that it would be “strictly

temporary.” He also suggested that if the car was to be traded in, the
cracks  ﬁlled  with  the  sealer  could  be  covered  with  Permatex,  which
would conceal the ﬁlled cracks. Permatex is a gasket sealer and could
serve no purpose other than to conceal the ﬁlled cracks in the motor
block.  He  said  that  Aron  told  him  to  do  this  work,  and  that  he  did  a
“pretty smooth job” and that the Permatex concealed the cracks.

About  the  20th  of  November,  1959,  Aron  drove  the  Imperial  into
the Lindberg Cadillac Company’s service department for appraisal as
a trade-in. It was there about half an hour, and he then drove it away.
Aron had not driven the Imperial after the crack sealer was put in until
the time he drove it to the plaintiff’s place of business for the purpose
of a trade-in. Defendant Aron testiﬁed that he discussed the condition
of the Imperial in plaintiff’s ofﬁce when they were attempting to close
the deal. He said that they agreed that it needed floor mats, that the
motor was leaking oil and needed repair, and that the fenders needed
ﬁxing. He did not tell either the salesman or the sales manager about
the  cracked  block.  Thus  the  car  which  had  been  appraised  in  June
was  reappraised  on  November  20th,  and  an  agreement  was
eventually  reached  to  allow  $2,290  for  the  Imperial  on  the  purchase
price of a new Cadillac. There was testimony that the actual value of
the  Imperial  as  traded  in,  assuming  that  the  block  was  not  cracked,
was  appraised  at  $1,720.00,  and  $259.00  was  later  spent  by  the
plaintiff  on  reconditioning  it  for  sale.  There  was  also  testimony  that
the book value of the car was $1,979.00.

The  sales  manager  for  the  plaintiff  company,  who  made  the
appraisal of the car, drove it for a few minutes on November 20th. He
checked  the  heat  gauge  to  see  if  it  was  overheating.  This  would
normally disclose a cracked motor block. He also checked for water
leaks,  and  found  none.  After  the  appraisal  and  sale,  the  car  was
reconditioned in the normal course of business for sale. This usually
took about 30 days.

On  December  21st,  the  Imperial  as  reconditioned  was  sold  for
$2,476.08. The purchaser returned the next day and complained that

it was overheating. The car was taken to the plaintiff’s shop to verify
the purchaser’s complaint. It was found that the motor block had the
cracks in it, and the plaintiff refunded to the purchaser the money he
had paid for the car. The plaintiff then sold the Imperial, known to the
buyer to have a cracked motor block, for $1,200.

The  defendant,  testifying  in  his  own  behalf,  said  that  he  did  not
know  what  a  motor  block  was.  He  said  that  when  the  Imperial  was
frozen, he took it to the ﬁlling station because they were supposed to
have  put  anti-freeze  in  the  radiator.  He  testiﬁed  that  the  station
attendant said that he would take care of what was wrong, and kept
the car for about a day. The attendant said nothing to him about the
cracked  motor  block.  He  said  that  after  he  was  informed  of  the
cracked  block  by  the  plaintiff,  he  never  went  to  the  ﬁlling  station
attendant  about  the  matter  nor  had  any  communication  with  him  in
relation to it. Defendant also testiﬁed that he had been sentenced to
three and one-half years for counterfeiting cigarette tax stamps, and
at the time of trial he was on probation for a period of seven years.

As stated, the court found for the plaintiff in the sum of $759.00,

and the defendant appealed.

The  ﬁrst  point  he  raises  is  that  the  appellant  failed  to  make  a
prima  facie  showing  of  fraud,  and  that  the  court  should  have  found
for  the  defendant.  The  appellant  asserts  in  support  of  this  that  he
made no misrepresentation, and that his mere silence cannot be held
to have been fraudulent where the matter was open to investigation
by  the  party  alleged  to  have  been  defrauded.  This  constitutes  a
complete disregard of the facts. Silence can be an act of fraud. In one
of  our  earliest  cases,  McAdams  v.  Cates,  24  Mo.  223,  225,  our
Supreme Court stated:

If, in a contract of sale, the vendor knowingly allows the vendee to be deceived
as  to  the  thing  sold  in  a  material  matter,  his  silence  is  grossly  fraudulent  in  a
moral point of view, and may be safely treated accordingly in the law tribunals
of  the  country.  Although  he  is  not  required  to  give  the  purchaser  all  the
information he possesses himself, he can not be permitted to be silent when his

silence  operates  virtually  as  a  fraud.  If  he  fails  to  disclose  an  intrinsic
circumstance that is vital to the contract, knowing that the other party is acting
upon  the  presumption  that  no  such  fact  exists,  it  would  seem  to  be  quite  as
much a fraud as if he had expressly denied it, or asserted the reverse, or used
any artiﬁce to conceal it, or to call off the buyer’s attention from it.

The reason for the rule is that since matters are not what they appear
to  be  and  the  true  state  of  affairs  is  not  discoverable  by  ordinary
diligence, deceit is accomplished by suppression of the truth. 23 Am.
Jur. Fraud and Deceit, §84, p. 863.

We have in the facts before us more than a failure to speak. There
is  also  a  positive  fraudulent  concealment.  In  the  case  of  Jones  v.
West Side Buick Auto Co., 93 S.W.2d 1083, decided by this court, we
had  before  us  facts  quite  similar  in  effect  to  those  here  under
consideration. There a fraudulent seller turned back the speedometer
in the car sold to 22,400 miles, when the car had in fact been driven
48,800  miles.  There  was  no  verbal  or  written  representation  by  the
seller,  but  the  buyer,  relying  upon  the  mileage  registered  on  the
speedometer,  purchased  the  car.  We  held  that  the  buyer  had  been
defrauded by the deception, stating: “a representation is not conﬁned
to words or positive assertions; it may consist as well of deeds, acts,
or  artiﬁces  of  a  nature  calculated  to  mislead  another  and  thereby  to
allow  the  fraud-feasor  to  obtain  an  undue  advantage  over  him.”  See,
also,  Hutchings  v.  Tipsword,  363  Mo.  App.,  363  S.W.2d  40,  45.  The
acts  of  the  defendant  as  stated  above  were  designed  to,  and  did,
defraud  the  plaintiff,  and  there  is  no  merit  to  the  contention  that  a
case in fraud was not made.

In  applying  the  rule  we
must consider the nature of the fraud committed as it reflects upon
the  value  of  the  property  as  fraudulently  represented.  A  trade  was
made  here  with  the  full  knowledge  that  the  car  was  to  be
reconditioned  for  sale.  It  was  represented  as  a  car  that  could  be  so
reconditioned by certain minor repairs caused by normal use. It was
known  by  the  defendant  that  the  expenditures  that  the  plaintiff
intended  to  make  would  not  make  the  car  serviceable  for  resale,  as
the car, after such repairs, could not honestly be sold for its intended
use.  The  fact  that  the  court,  in  reaching  the  amount  of  damages,
found the cost of the block and the cost of the repairs to be the total,
was  not  erroneous,  as  both  went  to  the  value  of  the  car  as
represented and its actual value.

We ﬁnd no error present, and the judgment is afﬁrmed.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Concealment  as  a  Misrepresentation.   In  the  above  case  the
defendant tried to argue that mere silence would not support a fraud
cause  of  action.  Did  the  court  agree  that,  at  worst,  the  defendant
could  be  accused  of  the  sin  of  omission  or  failing  to  do  something

that would have placed the plaintiff in a more advantageous position?
When  did  the  court  indicate  that  silence  could  still  constitute  a
misrepresentation of the truth to justify a cause of action based upon
deceit?

2.  Other  Instances  Where  Silence  Is  Fraud.   Most  fraud  claims
permitted by courts involve afﬁrmative statements proven to be false.
The  Lindberg  Cadillac  case  involved  an  exception  to  this  norm.
Beyond  active  concealment  of  relevant  information  involved  in  the
foregoing  case,  courts  have  also  been  willing  to  permit  fraud  claims
when  a  defendant  has  been  silent  in  circumstances  where  an
afﬁrmative duty to disclose is recognized. One such situation involves
transactions  entered  into  among  those  in  a  conﬁdential  or  ﬁduciary
relationship.  For  example,  when  one  retains  an  attorney,  an
accountant,  or  a  similar  professional,  courts  typically  hold  that  the
professional  owes  a  duty  of  loyalty  to  the  client  and  is  held  to  the
utmost standard of fair dealing, including an afﬁrmative obligation to
disclose  any  material  information  before  engaging  in  a  transaction
involving the client. Many other courts have also held that when one
conveys  partial  information  that  creates  a  misleading  impression,
there is a duty triggered to supply the rest of the material information.
In  other  words,  a  half-truth  is  a  complete  falsehood.  Some  courts
have recognized a duty of the seller in the context of a real estate sale
to  afﬁrmatively  disclose  material  information  about  the  real  estate
which  the  buyer  would  not  otherwise  be  in  a  position  to  uncover.
Finally, some courts have agreed with Restatement (Second) of Torts
§551  (1965),  which  requires  a  general  duty  to  disclose  facts  in  a
commercial  setting  when  the  defendant  knows  that  the  plaintiff  is
ignorant  about  the  fact  and  does  not  have  an  equal  opportunity  to
discover  the  truth.  Many  courts  have  refused  to  accept  the
Restatement’s potentially broad exception to the normal requirement
of  an  afﬁrmative  misrepresentation.  Because  it  is  unclear  when
disclosure  is  required  outside  of  special  relationships,  litigants  and
“somewhat  nebulous  standard,
courts  are  often

left  with  a

praiseworthy  as  looking  toward  more  stringent  business  ethics,  but
possibly  difﬁcult  of  practical  application.”  Note,  Fraudulent
Concealment — Vendor & Purchaser — Duty to Disclose, 36 Wash. L.
Rev. 202, 204 (1961).

3. Damages for Fraud.  The Lindberg Cadillac court stated that the
normal  measure  of  damages  in  a  fraud  case  was  the  difference  in
value  between  the  subject  of  the  transaction  as  represented  versus
its  actual  market  value.  While  courts  often  utilize  such  measures,
they  have  been  quite  flexible  in  permitting  other  calculations  in  a
fraud  case  where  justice  demanded  it.  In  fact,  in  Lindberg  Cadillac
the  court  also  permitted  recovery  of  some  out-of-pocket  expenses
incurred by the plaintiff in getting the automobile ready for resale. In
general,  courts  have  recognized  damages  for  the  (1)  out-of-pocket
damages  incurred  by  the  victim,  the  (2)  loss  of  the  beneﬁt  of  the
bargain,  (3)  a  restitution  type  of  recovery  designed  to  remove  any
unjust enrichment gained by the defendant from the fraud, as well as
(4)  other  consequential  damages  not  otherwise  covered.  There  are
some  courts  that  have  recognized  emotional  distress  damages  in
certain fraud cases, but such recovery is not typical.

4.  Materiality  of  Information.   The  common  law  only  imposes
liability for fraud when the misrepresentation is considered “material”
to the parties’ transaction. See  Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts  §538
(1965)  (reliance  upon  fraudulent  misrepresentation  not  justiﬁable
unless the matter misrepresented is material). One issue that courts
have  had  to  consider  is  whether  the  issue  of  materiality  should  be
resolved  by  resorting  to  an  objective  or  subjective  standard.  For
example,  if  most  purchasers  of  defendant’s  widget  would  not  care
about  the  color  of  the  product  (perhaps  some  piece  of  industrial
equipment), should the defendant’s knowing falsehood that the crane
was “bright yellow” when it was actually a dull mustard color still give
rise to liability if the plaintiff attached considerable importance to the
color of the equipment being purchased? Most courts have utilized an
objective measure of materiality — whether reasonable people in the

circumstance  would  have  attached  signiﬁcance  to  the  matter —
except  when  the  defendant  has  knowledge  of  the  plaintiff’s  own
subjective  view  of  the  importance  of  the  matter.  As  one  court
described the proposition, a representation is material if:

in  determining  his  choice  of  action

A  reasonable  man  would  attach  importance  to  its  existence  or
nonexistence
in  the
transaction in question; or the maker of the representation knows
or  has  reason  to  know  that  its  recipient  regards  or  is  likely  to
regard  the  matter  as  important  in  determining  his  choice  of
action, although a reasonable man would not so regard it.

Watts v. Krebs, 962 P.2d 387, 391 (Idaho 1998).

5.  Problems.   Would  the  following  scenarios  give  rise  to  valid

claims for fraud?

A.  A  used  car  dealer  fails  to  inform  a  buyer  that  the  car  was
previously in an accident requiring cosmetic repairs to the car’s
exterior body.

B.  A  jeweler  advises  the  purchaser  of  a  diamond  ring  that  it  had
“exceptional  cut  and  clarity,”  though  on  the  jeweler’s  internal
inventory  records  the  ring  was  categorized  as  “dull  and
unimpressive.”

C.  Business  partners  for  over  20  years  decided  to  wrap  up  their
business  affairs  in  preparation  for  retirement.  The  elder  of  the
two who had more day-to-day experience with the inventory and
equipment fails to inform his partner about the actual condition
of certain equipment when they negotiate to divide up assets of
the company.

3. Promissory Fraud

Where the misrepresentation that procured the parties’ agreement is
separate  from  the  promises  within  the  agreement,  courts  have  had

no  problem  recognizing  an  actionable  fraudulent  misrepresentation.
What  if  the  defendant’s  promise  to  perform  is  the  fraudulent
misrepresentation because the defendant never plans to perform as
promised? Is this a mere broken promise — a breach of contract case
— or is it fraud? For example, if the defendant agrees upon receipt of
$10,000 to deliver an automobile to the plaintiff but instead takes the
money  (and  the  car)  and  drives  to  Canada,  has  the  defendant
committed a tort or just breached an agreement? The Smehlik case
below  explores  the  concept  of  promissory  fraud  as  a  type  of
fraudulent misrepresentation.

SMEHLIK v. ATHLETES AND ARTISTS, INC.
861 F. Supp. 1162 (W.D.N.Y. 1994)

      , J.

Plaintiff  Richard  Smehlik,  a  Czechoslovakian  hockey  player  now
under  contract  with  the  Buffalo  Sabres  hockey  club  (“the  Sabres”),
brought  this  action  against  defendant  Athletes  and  Artists  (“A&A”),  a
New York corporation retained by Smehlik to act as his representative
in negotiating professional hockey contracts with the Sabres or with
other  National  Hockey  League  (“NHL”)  teams.  Smehlik’s  [amended
complaint  alleged  common
fraudulent  misrepresentation.
law
Defendant A&A has ﬁled a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss asserting
that no claim for fraud has been adequately pled].

Smehlik  was  drafted  by  the  Sabres  in  the  1990  NHL  draft.  On
August  28,  1990,  while  still
in  Czechoslovakia,  he  signed  an
agreement  with  A&A  under  which,  inter  alia,  A&A  was  to  act  as  his
exclusive  representative  in  the  negotiation  of  professional  hockey
contracts with the Sabres, or with whichever team held his rights. The
agreement had an initial term of two years, or until such time as A&A
had completed the negotiation of Smehlik’s next professional hockey
contract, whichever was longer.

A&A  claims  that  it  commenced  contract  negotiations  with  the
Sabres on behalf of Smehlik in the summer of 1990. The negotiations,
which  were  conducted  entirely  via  telephone  and  fax,  continued
periodically until about April 1992. At that time, A&A received a letter
from  Smehlik  stating  that  he  was  terminating  his  agreement  with
invalid.
A&A,  and/or  that  he  believed  the  agreement  to  be
Subsequently,  in  August  1992,  Smehlik  entered  into  a  contract  with
the  Sabres.  That  contract  was  negotiated  by  Rich  Winter  of  The
Entertainment & Sports Corporation, Smehlik’s current agent.

Smehlik  alleges  that  in  order  to  induce  him  to  enter  into  the
contract  at  issue  in  this  case,  A&A  “misrepresented  to  plaintiff  its
abilities, capabilities and what it would do for plaintiff pursuant to the
agreement  so  as  to  induce  plaintiff  to  enter  the  agreement  with  it.”
More speciﬁcally, he alleges that on or about August 28, 1990, A&A’s
representative Carl Hron told him:

(1) that A&A could obtain a contract for him with the Sabres for the 1991/92

season;

(2) that it could “make a deal right away”;
(3)  that  it  would  arrange  for  him  to  participate  in  the  Sabres’  1991  training

camp; and

(4)  that  it  would  make  all  necessary  arrangements  to  enable  him  to  attend
the  Sabres’  1991  training  camp,  which  required,  inter  alia,  obtaining  a
release from his Czech hockey club, T.J. Vitkovice.

He  alleges  that  these  representations  were  made  with  the  intent
to deceive him, and to induce him to sign an agreement with A&A that
he would not otherwise have signed. He maintains that he reasonably
relied  on  the  representations  in  deciding  to  sign  the  agreement.  He
asserts  that  A&A  failed  to  obtain  a  contract  with  the  Sabres  for  him
for  the  1991/92  season  or  to  “make  a  deal  right  away,”  and  that  it
failed  to  follow  up  on  Hron’s  promises  relating  to  his  attendance  at
the  Sabres’  1991  training  camp.  Finally,  he  alleges  that  A&A
“misrepresented,  concealed  or  failed  to  disclose  material  facts
including  that  it  either  did  not  have  sufﬁcient  knowledge  and/or

experience  in  dealing  with  Czechoslovak  laws  and  practices  and/or
that  if  it  had  adequate  knowledge  and/or  experience  with  respect  to
same, that it would fail to utilize same.”

A&A has moved to dismiss [the fraud claim on the ground that it]
simply  alleges  that  A&A  made  a  false  promise  to  perform  under  the
contract, a promise which, it maintains, cannot, under New York law,
convert  a  breach  of  contract  claim  into  one  for  fraud.  In  response,
Smehlik  contends  that  the  speciﬁc  oral  representations  made  by
Hron,  devised  for  the  purpose  of  inducing  him  to  enter  into  the
agreement,  included  promises  that  went  beyond  A&A’s  general
obligation under the written contract to “use its best efforts to secure
offers”  from  the  Sabres  or  other  NHL  clubs.  He  argues  that  under
New York law, one who is fraudulently induced to enter into a contract
may maintain a cause of action for fraud separate from his breach of
contract cause of action, when the fraud allegations are, as he claims
they are here, distinct from the breach of contract claim.

It is well established in the New York courts that when a plaintiff
alleges  both  breach  of  contract  and  fraud,  “[the]  cause  of  action  in
fraud  may  be  maintained  where  the  allegations  of  wrongdoing  are
distinct  from  those  giving  rise  to  the  breach  of  contract  claim  and
relate  to  facts  extraneous  thereto.”  Steigerwald  v.  Dean  Witter
Reynolds,  Inc.,  107  A.D.2d  1026  (N.Y.  4th  Dept.  1985).  A  mere
“promissory statement as to what will be done in the future” may give
rise  only  to  a  breach  of  contract  claim.  See Stewart v. Jackson  and
Nash, 976 F.2d 86, 89 (2d Cir. 1992). However, a false representation
of  a  present  fact  may  give  rise  to  a  separable  claim  for  fraudulent
inducement,  and  generally  speaking,  if  a  promise  is  “made  with  a
preconceived  and  undisclosed  intention  of  not  performing  it,  it
constitutes a misrepresentation of material existing fact” upon which
an  action  for  fraudulent  inducement  may  be  predicated.  Thus,  it  is
clear  that  a  cause  of  claim  for  fraudulent  inducement  may  be
sustained  on  the  basis  of  an  allegation  that  the  defendant  made  a
promise  to  undertake  some  action  separate  and  apart  from  his

obligations  under  the  express  terms  of  the  contract,  if  it  is  also
alleged  that  he  made  the  promise  with  no  intention  of  making  good
on that commitment.

What  is  much  less  clear  is  whether  a  cause  of  action  for  fraud
may  properly  be  sustained  on  the  basis  of  an  allegation  that  the
defendant made a promise to perform under the express terms of the
contract  while  intending  not  to  abide  by  its  terms.  The  New  York
courts are split on this issue. See Kenevan v. Empire Blue Cross and
Blue Shield,  791  F.  Supp.  75,  80  (S.D.N.Y.  1992);  Bower  v.  Weisman,
650  F.  Supp.  1415,  1422-1423
(S.D.N.Y.  1986).  The  Second
Department  has  recently  stated,  for  example,  that  where  a  fraud
claim “is premised upon an alleged breach of contractual duties and
the supporting allegations do not concern representations which are
collateral  or  extraneous  to  the  terms  of  the  parties’  agreement,  a
cause  of  action  sounding  in  fraud  does  not  lie.”  McKernin  v.  Fanny
Farmer  Candy  Shops,  Inc.,  176  A.D.2d  233,  574  N.Y.S.2d  58,  59  (2d
Dept. 1991) (citing Mastropieri v. Solmar Construction Co., Inc.,  159
A.D.2d 698, 553 N.Y.S.2d 187 (2d Dept. 1990); Tuck Industries, Inc. v.
Reichhold  Chemicals,  Inc.,  151  A.D.2d  565,  542  N.Y.S.2d  701  (2d
Dept.  1989);  Manshul  Construction  Corp.  v.  City  of  New  York,  143
A.D.2d 333, 532 N.Y.S.2d 419 (2d Dept. 1988); Edwil Industries, Inc. v.
Stroba Instruments Corp., 131 A.D.2d 425, 516 N.Y.S.2d 233 (2d Dept.
1987); Spellman v. Columbia Manicure Manufacturing Co., Inc.,  111
A.D.2d 320, 489 N.Y.S.2d 304 (2d Dept. 1985)). The First Department
takes a similar approach. See Caniglia v. Chicago Tribune-New York
News  Syndicate,  Inc.,  612  N.Y.S.2d  146,  147  (1st  Dept.  1994)  (“a
cause of action does not lie where . . . the only fraud alleged merely
relates to a contracting party’s alleged intent to breach a contractual
obligation”);  Comtomark,  Inc.  v.  Satellite  Communications  Network,
Inc., 116 A.D.2d 499, 497 N.Y.S.2d 371 (1st Dept. 1986). On the other
hand,  the  Third  Department  has  recently  held  that  “a  party  who  is
fraudulently induced to enter a contract may join a cause of action for
fraud  with  one  for  breach  of  the  same  contract”  where  the

misrepresentations  alleged  are  “misstatements  of  material  fact  or
promises [to perform under the contract] made with a present, albeit
undisclosed,  intent  not  to  perform  them.”  Shlang  v.  Bear’s  Estates
Development  of  Smallwood  N.Y.,  Inc.,  194  A.D.2d  914,  599  N.Y.S.2d
141,  142-143  (3d  Dept.  1993);  Bibeau  v.  Ward,  193  A.D.2d  875,  596
N.Y.S.2d 948, 950 (3d Dept. 1992) (citing Deerfield  Communications
Corp.  v.  Chesebrough-Ponds,  Inc.,  68  N.Y.2d  954,  510  N.Y.S.2d  88,
502 N.E.2d 1003).

In  its  Rule  12(b)(6)  motion,  A&A  asks  that  I  ﬁrst  make  a
determination,  from  the  face  of  the  amended  complaint  and  the
written  agreement  between  A&A  and  Smehlik,  that  the  oral
statements allegedly made by Hron to Smehlik must be regarded as
promises  encompassed  by  the  contractual  arrangement  between
A&A and Smehlik. This I cannot do. The written contract required only
that  A&A  use  its  “best  efforts”  on  behalf  of  Smehlik.  Whether  or  not
A&A’s  “best  efforts”  would  have  encompassed  the  oral  promises
allegedly made by Hron is a matter of factual dispute.

Even if I were able to ﬁnd that Hron’s representations were nothing
more  than  promises  to  perform  under  the  contract,  I  would  not  be
able to grant A&A’s motion because Smehlik has adequately pleaded
an undisclosed intent by A&A not to perform, and there is a split in the
New  York  case  law  as  to  whether  or  not  a  cause  of  action  for  fraud
may be sustained under such circumstances. It is not “‘beyond doubt
that [Smehlik] can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which
would  entitle  him  to  relief.’”  Goldman  v.  Belden,  754  F.2d  at  1065
(quoting Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46 (1957)).

For the reasons given above, A&A’s motions are denied. It is time
now to move ahead with resolution of the substantive issues in this
action.

So ordered.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Promissory Fraud as a Tort Claim.  While some courts have been
relatively  slow  to  recognize  a  broad  form  of  promissory  fraud  as  a
viable  type  of  actionable  misrepresentation,  it  has  actually  been
around  for  quite  a  long  time.  The  claim  was  recognized  as  early  as
1885  in  the  old  English  case  of  Edgington  v.  Fitzmaurice,  29  Ch.  D.
459,  where  an  investor  was  swindled  through  a  promise  that  the
directors would use his investment for a particular business purpose
without ever so intending. The court found the directors liable based
upon their lack of an intention to ever perform as promised. The court
stated that:

The  state  of  a  man’s  mind  is  as  much  a  fact  as  the  state  of  his
digestion. It is true that it is very difﬁcult to prove what the state of
man’s mind at a particular time is, but if it can be ascertained it is
as  much  a  fact  [capable  of  being  misrepresented]  as  anything
else.  A  misrepresentation  as  to  the  state  of  a  man’s  mind  is,
therefore, a misstatement of fact.

Id.  at  461.  Similar  to  the  insincere  opinion  that  can  count  as  a
misrepresentation  of  fact,  promissory  fraud  can  be  viewed  as  an
insincere promise that misrepresents the defendant’s actual state of
mind. Most courts have now recognized a broad form of promissory
fraud — that even as to promises contained within the express terms
of the contract, a failure by the defendant to intend to perform such
promises  at  the  time  of  entering  into  the  contract  counts  as  an
actionable  misrepresentation  of  fact.  One  entering  into  a  contract
without  the  intent  to  carry  through  on  his  promises  now  subjects
himself  not  only  to  a  breach  of  contract  claim  but  a  tort  claim  for
fraud.

Fraud occurs when —

a. a party makes a material misrepresentation,
b. the misrepresentation is made with knowledge of its
falsity  or  made  recklessly  without  any  knowledge  of  the

c. the misrepresentation is made with the intention that

it should be acted on by the other party, and

d.  the  other  party  relies  on  the  misrepresentation  and

thereby suffers injury.

2. Distinctions Between Suing on Contract vs. Fraud.  Despite near
universal willingness by courts to recognize promissory fraud, courts
are  also  quite  clear  that  a  “mere  breach  of  contract”  alone  does  not
constitute fraud and does not give rise to a tort cause of action. But
where  plaintiff  can  prove  the  lack  of  present  intent  to  perform  a
promise, a tort cause of action for fraud will lie. Whether the claimant
can sue on the contract only or also in tort can impact the applicable
statute of limitations, the appropriate damages, whether a liquidated

damage  clause  will  govern,  the  scope  of  discovery  and  admissibility
of certain evidence at trial, and the recovery of punitive damages.

4.  Problem.   Jack  manufactures  rocking  chairs  for  a  living.
Normally  he  can  build  four  chairs  per  day  when  working  fairly  hard.
Jill comes to see Jack in urgent need of 50 rocking chairs for a “Rock-
A-Thon”  she  is  organizing  involving  50  senior  citizens  who  will
attempt to set a new world record by rocking for three straight days in
a fundraiser. Jill advises Jack of this and says she needs the chairs in
seven days. Jack knows this will be difﬁcult to meet, but he is inspired
to  give  it  his  best  effort.  Unfortunately,  despite  building  as  fast  as
possible he is unable to ﬁnish the 50 chairs on time. Jill has to cancel
the event. Does Jill have a good fraud claim against Jack?

B. Justifiable Reliance

Like  other  tort  claims  we  have  examined  previously,  fraud  requires
proof that the defendant’s misconduct was the cause of the plaintiff’s
harm. Despite the defendant lying to the plaintiff, if the plaintiff does
not  care  about  the  challenged  representation  or  does  not  rely  upon

that  misinformation  in  choosing  to  transact  business  with  the
defendant, is there any reason to hold the defendant liable for fraud?
Further, if the plaintiff is foolishly duped into entering the transaction
should this provide a defense to the deceitful party? The court in the
following  case  explores  the  concept  of  justifiable  reliance  as  an
additional element of a fraud cause of action and helps deﬁne when
the intentional tortfeasor can rely upon the plaintiff’s own misconduct
as a defense.

JUDD v. WALKER
215 Mo. 312 (1908)

    , J.

Judd,  the  plaintiff,  resides  in  Brookline,  Massachusetts,  but  is  in
business  at  Dwight,  Illinois.  Bourland  resides  at  Pontiac,  Illinois.  The
defendants,  Walker  and  Naxera,  reside  in  Buffalo  township,  Pike
county,  Missouri.  Naxera  owned  two  tracts  of  land  in  Pike  county,
Illinois. Walker was Naxera’s agent to sell them. Bourland was Judd’s
agent  to  buy  them.  So  acting,  at  a  certain  time  Bourland  purchased
from  Walker  said  tracts  of  Illinois  land.  Judd  and  Bourland  were
strangers  in  that  vicinity  and  unfamiliar  with  the  lands.  Walker  and
Naxera  were  familiar  with  the
lands  and  Walker  made  false
representations as to the acreage. After the deed passed from Naxera
to  Judd,  it  was  ascertained  there  was  a  serious  discrepancy  in  the
amount  of  land  conveyed  by  the  deed,  whereby  Judd  paid  over
$1,000  for  land  he  did  not  get  and  which  Naxera  did  not  own  and
knew  he  did  not  own.  Thereupon  Judd  sued  Naxera  and  Walker  for
damages [for] fraud and deceit. No question is made on the pleadings
and  the  facts  seem  to  be  of  such  sort  that  the  law  should  throw  no
mere captious obstacle on dry technicality in the road of recovery —
to  the  contrary,  should  put  its  benediction  on  the  effort  if  it  can  be
done without overturning settled principles.

The  laws  of  hospitality  seem  to  require  that  strangers  should  be
taken  in  in  a  good  sense,  but  courts  should  be  astute  to  not  permit
such a “taking in” as appears here.

At  a  trial  in  that  court  with  the  aid  of  a  jury,  at  the  close  of
plaintiff’s  evidence,  he  was  cast  by  a  peremptory
instruction.
Thereafter he appealed to the St. Louis Court of Appeals. That court,
speaking  through  Nortoni,  J.,  handed  down  a  unanimous  opinion
reversing and remanding the case, but certiﬁed it here, being of mind
that  its  opinion  was  in  conflict  with  [another  intermediate  appellate
court].

The  statement  of  facts  by  Judge  Nortoni  and  his  conclusions  of

law follow:

This is an action at law on an allegation of fraud and deceit for the sale of lands.
The evidence was to the effect that the plaintiff, Curtis J. Judd, treasurer of the
Keeley  Company  of  Dwight,  Illinois,  is  a  man  of  means  and  invests  surplus
money in lands. One Bourland, a banker of Pontiac, Illinois, and Mr. Judd have
an arrangement whereby Bourland looks around for lands out of which money
can  be  made  by  buying  and  reselling,  and  upon  locating  such  lands,  Mr.  Judd
furnishes  the  money  and  the  land  is  purchased  in  the  name  of  Judd  as  a
speculation.  The  business  is  all  done  by  Bourland,  subject  to  Judd’s  approval.
On  the  occasion  in  question,  Bourland,  as  agent  of  Judd,  came  to  Louisiana,
Missouri, in search of lands and met the defendant Walker, a real estate agent
at  that  place,  who  drove  him  across  the  Mississippi  river  into  Pike  county,
Illinois, and upon the lands of the defendant Naxera, which he then had for sale
as  agent  for  Naxera.  The  land  was  irregular  in  shape,  being  bounded  on  one
side  by  the  Sny  and  running  to  a  dull  point  on  the  north  end.  Walker,  Naxera’s
agent, informed Bourland, Judd’s agent, that the two pieces of land which were
adjacent and owned by Naxera, contained one hundred and seventy-eight acres,
one piece containing eighty acres and the other ninety-eight acres, and offered
the  tract  at  forty  dollars  per  acre.  Bourland  looked  at  the  land  and  they  then
drove  on  and  viewed  other  properties.  Returning  to  Louisiana,  both  Bourland
and  one  Sims,  a  friend  of  Bourland  who  was  accompanying  him  on  the  trip,
informed  Walker  that  Bourland  was  acting  for  Judd  and  that  he  would  wire
Judd  for  consent  to  buy  the  Naxera  lands,  which  he  did  and  received  Judd’s
permission by wire, which was communicated to Walker. On the following day,
Bourland  drove  to  and  upon  the  lands  in  order  to  locate  a  certain  slough

thereon, and that evening paid Walker $200 earnest money and entered into a
contract  in  writing,  whereby  he  agreed  to  purchase  said  lands  as  soon  as
Walker  could  procure  satisfactory  abstracts,  conveyances,  etc.  At  the  time  of
executing this contract, Walker said he was not sure of the number of acres in
excess of ninety in the irregular-shaped tract adjacent to the Sny and therefore
they had better put in the contract the round number of ninety acres and would
ascertain deﬁnitely thereafter. A month later Walker drew up a deed which was
executed by his principal, Naxera, and acknowledged before Walker as a notary
public,  which  deed  purported  to  convey  to  Judd  the  two  tracts  of  land
mentioned,  one  hundred  and  seventy-eight  acres,  for  which  a  draft  payable  to
Walker, covering the balance due at $40 per acre, was delivered to the bank in
payment therefor, and the deed was thereupon delivered to Judd.

It  was  shown  by  the  evidence  both  of  Walker  and  Naxera,  as  well  as
otherwise,  that  each  of  them  knew  there  was  not  one  hundred  and  seventy-
eight acres of the land; that Naxera claimed to own one hundred and sixty acres
only, and that he refused to execute the deed for one hundred and seventy-eight
acres  at  Walker’s  request  and  advised  with  friends  about  it  before  signing  the
same, and ﬁnally consented to do so upon the agent Walker giving him a written
obligation to hold him harmless in event the shortage of acres was discovered
and  he  would  be  called  upon  to  make  good;  that  Naxera  received  pay  for  one
hundred  and  sixty  acres  of  the  land  at  forty  dollars  per  acre,  less  Walker’s
commission, a total of $640, and that Walker appropriated to his own use, with
Naxera’s consent and approval, forty dollars per acre for the remaining eighteen
acres, besides his commission. Some time thereafter, Judd caused the land to
be  surveyed,  whereby  it  was  ascertained  that  it  contained  153.24  acres  only,
instead of one hundred and seventy-eight acres, there being a shortage of 24.76
acres. One witness also testiﬁed that between the time of the negotiation of the
land  and  the  making  of  the  deed,  Walker  told  him  in  his  (Walker’s)  ofﬁce  that
Bourland was going to take the land and that he was getting paid for a number
of acres, something like twenty-seven acres, more than there was in the tract.
Upon this state of facts, this suit for fraud and deceit was instituted to recover
this shortage at forty dollars per acre.

At  the  conclusion  of  the  evidence  for  the  plaintiff,  the  court  peremptorily
instructed  the  jury  that  the  ﬁnding  should  be  for  the  defendant.  In  obedience
thereto,  the  jury  returned  a  verdict  as  directed.  After  unsuccessful  motions  to
set the same aside and for new trial, plaintiff appeals.

1.  There  are  cases  which  hold  that  where  the  parties  go  upon  the  land
during negotiations and the seller points out the true boundaries thereof to the
purchaser,  with  the  statement  of  the  number  of  acres  contained  therein,  and

upon this statement of the acreage the purchaser relies and purchases the land,
no action of deceit can be maintained by the injured party on account thereof.
The  reason  assigned  in  these  cases  seems  to  be  two-fold:  ﬁrst,  that  parties
ought not rely on such statements; and, second, that the parties were upon the
land and the means of information were equally open to both, therefore the rule
caveat  emptor  applies,  as  the  true  number  of  acres  could  be  ascertained  by
ordinary  vigilance  on  the  part  of  the  purchaser.  .  .  .  After  much  careful  and
painstaking  investigation,  we  are  satisﬁed  that  the  law  is  quite  generally
established  throughout  those  jurisdictions  where  the  common  law  obtains,  to
the  effect  that  false  statements  and  representations  made  by  the  vendor,
positively as of his own knowledge, as to the number of acres in a certain tract
of  land  when  the  tract  is  being  negotiated  by  the  acre,  are  not  regarded  as
expressions of opinion, but on the contrary, are considered statements of fact,
and  as  such  constitute  fraud.  .  .  .  This  view  has  become  almost  universally
recognized  and  adopted  by  the  courts  throughout  the  country.  The  generally
accepted doctrine on the subject is thus announced in 14 Am. and Eng. Ency.
Law (2 Ed.), 45: “There are some cases in which it has been held or said that a
false statement as to the boundaries of a tract of land, or as to the number of
acres which it contains, will not support an action of deceit, but they base the
rule on the ground that such statements ought not to be relied upon, and not on
the ground that they are expressions of opinion. Statements as to such matters,
if made by a person positively, and as of his own knowledge, are statements of
fact, and have often been held to constitute fraud.”

In  fact,  the  rule  announced  above  is  the  same  which  applies  in  cases  of
fraud and deceit generally and is to the effect that the party owning the property
or  article,  is  presumed  to  know  the  facts.  No  one  has  prevented  him  from
knowing them and one dealing with him has the right to rely upon the positive
statements  and  representations  of  fact  pertaining  thereto,  even  though  the
means of knowledge were specially open to him, provided the representations
were  relied  upon  and  were  sufﬁcient  to  and  did  actually  induce  action,  for  the
law will not hear the guilty party say, “You were yourself guilty of negligence,” or
“You ought not to have trusted me.” Bigelow on Fraud, 523, 524; Kerr on Fraud
(2 Ed.)

2. This case reeks with fraud. The evidence shows conclusively that Walker
made  positive  representations  to  Bourland  as  to  the  number  of  acres  in  the
tract from the inception of the trade up to the time of drawing the contract, at
which time he suggested that as he was not sure of the exact number of acres
in  excess  of  ninety,  they  would  call  the  irregular  tract  ninety  acres  in  round
numbers, leaving the impression that in the interim, prior to the making of the

deed,  he  would  ascertain  the  true  acreage.  Bourland  relied  upon  what  he  said
and trusted to him to make good his representations. Walker himself drew the
deed  for  one  hundred  and  seventy-eight  acres,  and  procured  his  principal’s
signature thereto by giving to him an obligation of indemnity as mentioned, and
collected the cash for the full number of acres as represented by him in the ﬁrst
instance, knowing at the time that he was then and there perpetrating a heinous
fraud upon the purchaser. It would seem that in a case of such gross deception
a  recovery  should  be  had  without  much  difﬁculty.  The  respondent  contends,
however, that inasmuch as Bourland went upon the land twice and viewed the
same,  the  parties  were  then  upon  an  equal  footing,  and  means  of  knowledge
being open to him, the rule of caveat emptor applies; that it was the purchaser’s
duty  to  use  his  senses  and  vigilance  and  ascertain  for  himself  the  true  facts,
and  not  having  done  so,  a  recovery  is  precluded.  The  cases  of  Mires  v.
Summerville,  Mooney  v.  Miller,  Gordon  v.  Parmelee,  and  Credle  v.  Swindell,
supra, are cited and relied upon as supporting this contention.

Chancellor  Kent  says:  “The  common  law  affords  to  every  one  reasonable
protection against fraud in dealing; but it does not go to the romantic length of
giving indemnity against the consequences of indolence and folly, or a careless
indifference to the ordinary and accessible means of information. It reconciles
the  claims  of  convenience  with  the  duties  of  good  faith,  to  every  extent
compatible  with  the  interests  of  commerce.  This  it  does  by  requiring  the
purchaser  to  apply  his  attention  to  those  particulars  which  may  be  supposed
within  the  reach  of  his  observation  and  judgment;  and  the  vendor  to
communicate  those  particulars  and  defects  which  cannot  be  supposed  to  be
immediately within the reach of such attention. If the purchaser be wanting of
attention to these points, where attention would have been sufﬁcient to protect
him  from  surprise  or  imposition,  the  maxim,  caveat emptor,  ought  to  apply.”  2
Kent’s Comm. (14 Ed.), 484, 485.

The  true  test  of  the  application  of  the  rule caveat emptor,  is  the  liability  of
the  defect  complained  of  to  the  observation  and  judgment  of  one  exercising
ordinary  and  usual  business  attention,  care  and  circumspection,  that  is,  such
care  and  attention  as  is  usually  exercised  by  ordinarily  prudent  men  in  like
business  affairs.  The  law  requires  this  much  and  no  more.  It  does  not  require
nor  expect  the  purchaser  to  exercise  a  degree  of  care  and  prudence  greater
than  business  men  ordinarily  exercise  in  like  transactions.  The  rule  is  a
reasonable  one  and  its  chief  purpose  is  to  require  men  to  see  and  know  such
things  as  are  open  and  patent  to  their  senses  upon  penalty.  It  is  where  the
defect  complained  of  is  open  and  patent  to  the  senses  of  one  exercising
ordinary  business  care  and  attention  only  that  the  rule  of  caveat  emptor

applies. . . . The rule mentioned has been carried to its full extent in this State. In
Morse  v.  Rathburn,  49  Mo.  91,  the  alleged  false  representations  were  that
certain unimproved portions of the farms were well-timbered and that the soil
was  good,  whereas  most  of  the  timber  had  been  cut  off  and  the  land  was
broken  and  rocky.  The  plaintiff  having  been  over  the  land  during  negotiations,
the  court  very  properly  denied  a  recovery  by  the  application  of  the  rule
aforesaid,  on  the  ground  that  the  matters  and  things  about  which  the  alleged
false representations were made were open to the observation of the purchaser.
To  the  same  effect  is  the  case  of  McFarland  v.  Carver,  34  Mo.  195,  in  which
case  the  fraud  and  deceit  alleged  was  as  to  certain  representations  regarding
the quality of lands and it appeared that one hundred and twenty acres thereof
were  subject  to  overflow.  The  court  held  that  if  the  defect  was  patent  to
observation, no recovery could be had therefor.

Entertaining  these  views,  we  are  fully  persuaded  that  the  case  under
consideration is not one where the rule should ﬁnd application. To apply it here,
we  must  ﬁnd  that  the  alleged  shortage  of  acres  in  the  tract  was  open  and
patent to the observation of the purchaser and within the range of his senses
while  viewing  the  lands.  This  we  cannot  do  as  it  is  a  matter  of  common
knowledge that a man cannot view a tract of land and arrive at anything like an
accurate estimate of its contents. As said by the Supreme Court of Michigan: “It
cannot be generally true that a person can judge of the contents of a piece of
land by the eye.” Starkweather v. Benjamin, 32 Mich. 305.

3. Considering the next proposition, that Bourland having viewed the lands,
he  should  have  used  vigilance  to  ascertain  the  fact  of  acreage.  To  follow  out
this  suggestion,  a  survey  would  have  been  necessary.  The  rule  only  requires
that  Bourland  should  use  that  degree  of  business  circumspection  usually
exercised  by  prudent  men  in  like  transactions.  This  being  true,  he  would  be
chargeable  with  neglect  in  that  behalf  only  in  event  that  prudent  men  usually
cause  surveys  to  be  made  under  like  circumstances.  In  dealing  with  this
suggestion, we must apply a degree of common sense commensurate with the
case  in  hand  and  view  it  in  the  light  of  common  knowledge  and  every-day
experience pertaining to like affairs. From these bearings, we all know that land
in  large  tracts  is  bought  and  sold  almost  daily  by  the  acre  in  this  country
without  surveys.  This  arises  no  doubt  from  the  fact  that  the  original
Government  surveys  are  usually  accurate  and  men  rely  thereon,  together  with
the  presumption  usually  indulged  that  he  who  owns  the  land  knows  the
acreage,  and  the  negotiations  are  generally  had  on  the  faith  of  prior  surveys,
and representation of the owner. The citizens of Missouri from time immemorial
have  been  accustomed  to  deal  with  the  utmost  good  faith  in  matters  of  this

kind,  and  it  would  be  a  sad  commentary  indeed  upon  the  moral  sense  and
integrity  of  the  State  for  the  courts  to  say  even  by  inference  that  our  citizens
can no longer be trusted in this behalf. Our conclusion is that in case of positive
representation  of  a  given  number  of  acres  in  a  tract,  ordinary  business
prudence  does  not  require  a  survey  and  measurement  thereof  and  that  the
party relying upon such representations of fact is not precluded from recovery
by not causing measurements to be made in advance of the purchase.

The  words  “means  of  knowledge  easily  within  reach”  employed  in  some  of
the cases ought not to be construed to require the purchaser to seek out and
employ a survey or for the purpose of verifying a fact positively asserted by the
seller.

4. There is yet an additional reason why this case should have gone to the
jury. Respondents were in no position to avail themselves of appellant’s want of
care and lack of attention. The general rule seems to be well settled that where
the  parties  deal  fairly  or  at  arm’s  length,  the  rule  of  caveat  emptor  as  above
indicated applies, but when fair dealing is departed from by the vendor making
false  statements  of  fact  as  of  his  own  knowledge,  the  falsity  of  which  is  not
palpable  to  the  purchaser,  the  purchaser  has  the  undoubted  right  to  rely
implicitly  upon  such  statements  and  the  principle  has  no  application
(Authorities  supra),  and  in  event  the  purchaser  is  entrapped  thereby  and
afterwards calls upon the vendor in a court of justice to make compensation for
his deceit, the law will not permit him to escape by urging the folly of his dupe
nor by admitting that he, the seller, was a knave and a scoundrel, and averring
the  defrauded  party  was  negligent  and  careless  in  thus  believing  and  trusting
him, for this would be equivalent to saying, “You trusted me, therefore I have a
right to betray you.” Cottrill v. Krum, 100 Mo. 397, 13 S.W. 753.

Mr. Kerr, in his work on Fraud (2 Ed.), 40, 41, says: “If a deﬁnite or particular
statement be made as to the contents of property, and the statement be untrue,
it is not enough that the party to whom the representation was made may have
been  acquainted  with  the  property.  A  very  intimate  knowledge  with  the
premises will not necessarily imply knowledge of their exact contents, while the
particularity  of  the  statement  will  naturally  convey  the  notion  of  exact
admeasurement.  The  fact  that  he  had  the  means  of  knowing  or  of  obtaining
information  of  the  truth  which  he  did  not  use  is  not  sufﬁcient.  .  .  .  He  is  not
bound to inquire unless something has happened to excite suspicion, or unless
there is something in the case or in the terms of the representation to put him
on inquiry. . . . ”

For  the  reasons  above  given,  the  judgment  is  reversed  and  the  cause

remanded to be proceeded with as herein indicated.

We  approve  the  [foregoing]  statement  of  facts  by  the  learned
judge  and  his  conclusions  of  law.  Would  it  not  be  a  shame  to
jurisprudence  if,  on  the  facts  found,  the  conclusions  drawn  did  not
irresistibly  follow?  True,  Naxera  made  no  false  representations  of
material  facts
in  person  to  either  Judd  or  Bourland,  but  his
mouthpiece,  Walker,  did,  and  Naxera  after  notice  adopted  the
transaction and either shared in the polluted gains or aided Walker in
pocketing  them.  True,  the  written  contract  preceding  the  deed  was
signed by Bourland as a party thereto. But Walker knew at that time
that  Bourland  represented  another,  and,  if  he  did  not  know  it  at  that
time,  both  he  and  Naxera  knew  it  before  the  deed  was  made  by
Naxera  to  Judd.  True,  the  false  representations  relating  to  acreage
antedated  the  written  contract  and  the  deed,  but  the  fraud  was  not
merged in those instruments.

As  we  read  the  record,  there  is  present  here  a  typical  case  of
actionable  fraud  and  deceit.  For  instance:  False  representations  of
the  vendor  on  material  facts  leading  up  to  the  sale,  with  his
knowledge  of  their  falsity  and  a  present  intention  they  should  be
believed  and  acted  on  by  the  vendee,  coupled  with  the  vendee’s
ignorance  of  their  falsity  and  his  reliance  and  acting  on  such
representations  to  his  resulting  damage.  The  fraud,  resting  in  parol,
may be proved by parol, and the written documents were mere steps
in that proof.

It  is  elementary  that  a  grantee,  defrauded  as  was  Judd,  is  not
obliged to sue on the covenants of warranty in his deed nor need he
go  into  equity  to  rescind  the  contract,  but  he  may  hold  what  he  got
under the contract and sue at law for his damages. That is what Judd
did in this case.

The  premises  considered,  the  judgment  of  the  [trial  court]  is
reversed and the cause is remanded to be retried in accordance with

the  views  expressed  in  the  opinion  of  Nortoni,  J.,  and  in  this.  All
concur.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Plaintiff’s  Misconduct  Negating  Justiﬁable  Reliance.   Assuming
that a plaintiff actually relies upon the defendant’s misrepresentation,
another possible issue concerns whether that reliance was justifiable
under the circumstances. In the Judd case the defendant contended
that  reliance  was  not  justiﬁable  because  the  size  of  the  land  was
open  and  ascertainable,  and  the  plaintiff  should  have  paid  for  a
formal survey to ascertain the actual acreage. The court stated that
the  test  for  justiﬁable  reliance  was  whether  “one  exercising  ordinary
and  usual  business  attention,  care  and  circumspection”  would  have
relied upon the misrepresentation. In applying this somewhat general
test  of  reasonableness,  the  court  elaborated  that  when  the  “defect
was  open  and  patent  to  the  senses,”  that  reliance  could  not  be
justiﬁed  and  the  rule  of  caveat  emptor — or  buyer  beware — would
instead  apply.  While  courts  sometimes  refer  to  this  justiﬁcation  test
as  one  asking  whether  the  plaintiff’s  reliance  was  “reasonable” —
indicating an ordinary negligence standard — in application it appears
that  most  courts  are  really  applying  more  of  a  gross  negligence
in  Judd
standard  for  the
summarized:  “The  fact  that  he  had  the  means  of  knowing  or  of
obtaining  information  of  the  truth  which  he  did  not  use  is  not
sufﬁcient [to negate justiﬁed reliance]. . . . He is not bound to inquire
unless  something  has  happened  to  excite  suspicion,  or  unless  there
is something in the case or in the terms of representation to put him
on inquiry.” Ultimately, the issue of justiﬁcation turns on whether the
factﬁnder  determines  that  there  were  any  “red  flags”  to  make  the
reliance unjustiﬁed. What facts would have to have been different for
the buyer’s reliance in that case to have been unjustiﬁed?

2.  Disclaimer  of  Reliance  Clause

in  Contracts.   Recently,
enterprising  transaction  lawyers  have  tried  to  insulate  their  clients
from claims for fraud by use of inventive disclaimer language within
the terms of a written contract. Referred to as “disclaimer of reliance”
clauses,  these  are  often  worded  so  as  to  negate  any  actual  reliance
by the parties to a contract on any representation made beyond the
four corners of the agreement. Under the right circumstances, courts
have  shown  a  willingness  to  enforce  such  waivers  of  reliance,
particularly  among  parties  of  equal  bargaining  strength  and
sophistication, and when represented by counsel. Some courts have
held,  however,  that  a  mere  “merger”  clause — that  recites  that  no
representations or promises outside the terms of the written contract
have  been  made — does  not  preclude  a  claim  for  fraudulent
inducement. See Italian Cowboy Partners, Ltd. v. Prudential Ins. Co. of
America, 341 S.W.3d 323 (Tex. 2011).

3. Problems.  Would the claimants below appear to have justiﬁably

relied upon the other actor’s misrepresentations?

A. A mattress salesperson tells Rachel that the mattress on sale is
one of the softest mattresses they sell. It is actually quite ﬁrm.
Rachel  has  available  all  of  the  store’s  mattresses  on  display  to
try  out  but  trusts  the  salesperson  instead  and  buys  the
mattress.  She  later  regrets  the  purchase  after  sleeping  on  the
mattress and concluding that it was ﬁrm rather than soft.

B.  The  seller  of  a  house  tells  James  that  the  house  has  no
problems.  James  relies  upon  this  and  foregoes  an  inspection,
failing  to  notice  spots  along  the  side  of  the  house  where  the
existing bricks are crumbling.

III  NEGLIGENT MISREPRESENTATION

Given  its  name,  you  may  be  tempted  to  assume  that  a  claim  for
negligent misrepresentation is identical to a fraud claim except with a
lower  mens  rea  (i.e.,  carelessness).  If  that  were  entirely  true,  of
course,  there  would  be  no  need  for  courts  to  recognize  separately  a
fraud  claim.  If  anyone  could  recover  just  as  easily  by  proving  the
lower  mens  rea  for  negligent  misrepresentation,  it  would  make  no
sense  to  attempt  to  prove  greater  fault  than  required  to  recover.
Negligent  misrepresentation  does  have  a  degree  of  overlap  with  a
fraud  cause  of  action,  but  its  elements  reveal  a  more  limited
application  in  terms  of  the  types  of  instances  where  courts  will
recognize this cause of action.

A. Introduction

STAGGS v. SELLS
82 S.W.3d 219 (Ct. App. Tenn. 2001)

This  case  involves  a  claim  of  negligent  misrepresentation  in  the
sale of a home. The trial court found that Defendants’ statements and
actions  constituted  negligent  misrepresentation  of  the  condition  of
the property resulting in $25,000.00 in damages to Plaintiff. However,
the  trial  court  also  found,  applying  principles  of  comparative  fault,
that  Defendants  were  60%  at  fault  and  Plaintiff  was  40%  at  fault.  A
judgment  of  $15,000  was,  thus,  assessed  against  Defendants.

In  1987,  Defendants/Appellants,  William  E.  and  Betty  Jean  Sells,
purchased a home in which their daughter lived until 1995, when they
placed  this  house  up  for  sale.  Defendants  never  actually  lived  in  the
home,  but
lived  close  by  and  visited  their  daughter  regularly.
Plaintiff/Appellee,  Christell  Staggs,  viewed  the  home  on  three
occasions  and  negotiated  a  purchase  price  for  the  house  of
$71,000.00. A contract was signed with Defendants to purchase the
house  for  that  amount.  This  contract  also  provided  “that  [the]
Property has not been damaged or affected by flood or storm run-off
and that [the] Property does / does not require flood insurance.” The
box  next  to  the  phrase  “does  not”  in  this  sentence  was  checked.  No
other explanation was provided by Defendants.

Although  Defendants  accepted  the  offer,  they  never  saw  the
contract  and  authorized  their  agent  to  sign  it  for  them.  Their  agent
never  read  the  terms  of  the  contract  to  them  and  did  not  inquire
regarding any flooding which might have occurred on the property.

Plaintiff inspected the property herself. She also had the property
appraised  and  inspected  by  professionals.  The  appraisal  came  in  at
$71,000.00;  however,  the  appraiser  noted  that  the  property  was  in  a
low-lying  area  and  could  be  subject  to  minor  flooding.  He
recommended  having  a  surveyor  check  for  flooding,  but  issued  the
appraisal,  which  was  accepted  by  the  bank,  without  obtaining  a
survey  on  the  assumption  that  the  property  did  not  flood.  A  flood
certiﬁcation was obtained that established that the property, like the
majority  of  property  in  Putnam  County,  was  in  flood  zone  C.  Flood
insurance could be purchased but was not required.

At  the  closing,  Plaintiff  inquired  of  her  agent  what  “flood  zone  C”
was.  She  was  told  by  her  agent  that  “it  was  a  flood  zone,  but  it  is  a
it  wasn’t  supposed  to  flood.”  She  never  ask
low  flood  zone,
Defendants about any flooding, and Defendants, who were present at
the closing, never mentioned any flooding to her.

Over the next few years, water came up flooding the yard around
15  times.  In  some  cases  the  flooding  was  so  severe  that  the  house
was  completely  surrounded  by  water  rendering  it  a  virtual  island.
However,  water  has  never  come  into  the  house  and  has  not  yet
caused  any  structural  damage  to  the  dwelling.  Testimony  showed
that  no  residents  have  had  to  spend  signiﬁcant  time  away  from  the
house since the water usually recedes quickly, allowing access to the
house within a few hours and completely clearing the property within
a day or two.

In  his  ﬁndings  of  fact,  the  judge  determined  that  the  paragraph
regarding storm run-off and flood insurance was marked at the time
the  contract  was  signed  and  held  that,  when  Defendant’s  agent
signed  this  contract,  a  guarantee  was  made  by  Defendants  in  that
agreement. Said the court:

I don’t think there’s an intentional misrepresentation here. I don’t think that
the proof rises to that level. But I think it does rise to the level of recklessness
when that provision was in the contract when he and Mrs. Sells had authorized
the  agent  to  sign  the  contract  for  them,  you’re  guaranteeing  that  there’s  no
water problem on this property. Putting that kind of authority in the hands of the
agent  without  carefully
itself,  does  amount  to
looking  at  the  contract
recklessness, and I’m satisﬁed that there was a misrepresentation.

The  Court  ﬁnds  that  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Sells,  not  intentionally,  but  recklessly
through  their  agent,  misrepresented  that  this  property  did  not — was  not
affected by flood or storm runoff.

I ﬁnd that that representation was not true. I ﬁnd that the defendants made
that representation in this contract without exercising reasonable care. . . . And
that this did in fact have the affect (sic) of causing Mrs. Staggs to rely on it.

For the purpose of this lawsuit the comparison of fault is appropriate. I ﬁnd
that  the  defendants  were  60  percent  at  fault.  I  ﬁnd  that  the  plaintiff  was  40
percent at fault. I ﬁnd that the damages were suffered in this matter when you
consider  all  the  proof,  including  the  photographs,  the  appraisals  and  the
testimony of the plaintiff was in the amount of $25,000.

I ﬁnd that because of the fault of Mrs. Staggs and her 40 percent of the fault

that that judgment must be reduced to $15,000.

Defendants essentially presented three issues for review: (1) how
should  the  principles  of  comparative  fault  be  applied  to  negligent
misrepresentation;  (2)  whether  the  evidence  preponderates  against
the  judge’s  ﬁnding  of  negligent  misrepresentation;  and  (3)  whether
the evidence preponderates against the amount of damages found to
be suffered by Plaintiff.

The  trial  judge  found  that  Defendants  negligently  represented  in
the  contract  that  the  property  was  not  affected  by  flood  or  storm
runoff  and  that  this  representation  was  false.  Tennessee  recognizes
the  tort  of  negligent  misrepresentation,  Tartera,  224  Tenn.  262,  453
S.W.2d 780 at 784, the law of which was set out in the American law
Institute,  Restatement  of  Torts  (Second),  §552,  Tentative  Draft
Number 11, as quoted by the supreme court:

(1) One who, in the course of his business, profession or employment,
or  a  transaction  in  which  he  has  a  pecuniary  interest,  supplies  false
information  for  the  guidance  of  others  in  their  business  transactions,  is
subject  to  liability  for  pecuniary  loss  caused  to  them  by  their  justiﬁable
reliance  upon  such  information,  if  he  fails  to  exercise  reasonable  care  or
competence in obtaining or communicating the information.

(2) The liability stated in subsection (1) is limited to loss suffered

(a)  By  the  person  or  one  of  the  persons  for  whose  beneﬁt  and

guidance he knows the information to be intended; and

(b) Through reliance upon it in a transaction in which it is intended

to influence his conduct.

Id.;  See  also,  Hunt  v.  Walker,  483  S.W.2d  732,  735  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.
1971).  Thus,  to  prevail,  the  plaintiff  must  establish  that  “(1)  the
defendant  supplied  information  to  the  plaintiff;  (2)  the  information
was  false;  (3)  the  defendant  did  not  exercise  reasonable  care  in
obtaining  or  communicating  the  information;  and  (4)  the  plaintiff
justiﬁably relied on the information.” Atkins v. Kirkpatrick, 823 S.W.2d
547, 552 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1991). Further, Defendants, as principal, are
liable  for  the  negligent  misrepresentations  of  their  agent.  Haynes  v.
Cumberland Builders, Inc., 546 S.W.2d 228, 232 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1976).

Even though Defendants did not actually read or sign the contract
themselves, they are responsible for the actions and representation of
their  agent,  who  was  authorized  to  review  and  sign  the  contract  on
their  behalf.  The  court  made  a  ﬁnding  that,  at  the  time  the  contract
was  signed  by  Defendants’  agent,  it  represented  that  the  property
was not affected by flood or storm runoff. The court also weighed the
credibility  of  the  witnesses  and,  based  on  testimony  at  trial,
determined that Defendants were well aware of the flooding problems
and  the  extent  thereof  at  the  time  the  contract  was  signed  by  their
agent.  We  ﬁnd  the  testimony  in  the  record  more  than  sufﬁcient  to
support these ﬁndings.

“Before a seller makes a representation, he is required to exercise
reasonable  care  to  make  sure  that  it  is  correct.”  Akbari v. Horn,  641
S.W.2d  506,  508  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  1982).  The  statement  regarding
flooding and storm runoff was patently false. Defendants’ agent had
in  determining  that  all
an  obligation  to  use  reasonable  care
representations  made  in  the  contract  were  true  and  correct.  Such
care  was  not  used,  and  Defendants,  as  the  principal,  are  now
responsible for the negligence of their agent.

Defendants  also  argue  that  there  was  no  reasonable  reliance  on
the  information  supplied  in  the  contract  since  Plaintiff  was  free  to,
and  did,  perform  her  own  inspection  of  the  building  and  property.
However,  as  the  flooding  problem  only  occurred  during  periods  of
very heavy or prolonged rain, it was not readily discoverable by visual
inspection.  The  flood  zone  was  no  different  than  that  of  the
surrounding  houses,  and  the  inspection  revealed  no  telltale  water
damage to the house. Although the appraiser recommended a survey
due  to  the  low  lying  nature  of  the  property,  the  statement  in  the
contract  that  there  was  no  flooding  or  storm  runoff  diminished  the
necessity  for  such  survey,  and  the  appraisal  was  accepted  by  the
bank  without  question.  Plaintiff  also  testiﬁed  that  she  relied  on  the
representation  made  in  the  contract  that  the  property  was  not
affected  by  flooding  or  storm  runoff,  and  the  court  accepted  her

testimony  as  credible.  The  facts,  as  found  by  the  court,  support  the
court’s  determination
the
representations  made  by  Defendants,  and  this  evidence  certainly
does  not  preponderate  against
the  ﬁnding  of  negligent
misrepresentation.

that  Plaintiff

reasonably

relied  on

Defendants/Appellants  argued  that  Tennessee  law  does  not
provide for applying comparative fault to negligent misrepresentation
cases  since,  in  these  cases,  Plaintiff  must  show  that  she  justiﬁably
relied  on  the  misrepresentation,  and  if  Plaintiff  was  negligent  in
performing  reasonable  inspections  and  inquiries,  it  cannot  be  said
that she justiﬁably relied on the representations of Defendant. We ﬁnd
this argument unsound.

The  doctrine  of  comparative  fault  in  Tennessee  is  applied  to
negligence  cases,  and  negligent  misrepresentation  is  an  action  “in
tort  determined  by  the  general  principles  of  the  law  of  negligence.”
Tartera v. Palumbo, 224 Tenn. 262, 453 S.W.2d 780, 784 (Tenn. 1970).
“If the plaintiff meets the burden of establishing the defendant’s duty
in  a  particular  case,  as  well  as  the  other  elements  of  the  negligence
claim,  the  trier  or  fact  must  apply  the  [49  percent  comparative  fault
principles  of  McIntyre  v.  Balentine  (see  Chapter  7,  Afﬁrmative
Defenses)].

It  is  axiomatic  that  a  plaintiff  could  commit  negligence  which
might  have  contributed  to  the  amount  of  damage  suffered,  but  still
have  justiﬁably  relied  on  the  defendants’  representations.  Justiﬁable
reliance  is  one  of  the  elements  that  must  be  established  to  the
satisfaction  of  the  trial  judge  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence
before the tort of negligent misrepresentation can be established by a
plaintiff. Such a ﬁnding is not inconsistent with comparative fault on
the  part  of  the  plaintiff.  The  trial  judge  found  just  such  a  situation
here,  and  the  evidence  does  not  preponderate  against  that  ﬁnding.
judge  correctly  applied  Tennessee’s
We  further  ﬁnd  that  the
comparative fault law to these facts and properly reduced the award
of damages by the amount of fault attributable to Plaintiff.

With regard to damages, there was very little evidence introduced
other  than  Plaintiff’s  own  testimony.  She  testiﬁed,  pursuant  to  Rule
701  of  the  Tennessee  Rules  of  Evidence,  that  the  value  of  the
property  as  a  result  of  the  flooding  was  between  $32,000.00  and
$35,000.00  and  asked  the  court  for  a  judgment  of  $38,500.00
representing the difference between what she believed she could sell
the property for and the $71,000.00 she paid. The judge also viewed
the  very  telling  pictures,  which  showed  the  house  completely
surrounded  by  water  only  inches  away  from  actually  entering  the
house,  and  heard  the  testimony  of  several  real  estate  agents  who
articulated  their  belief  that  the  property  would  be  extremely  difﬁcult
sell.

The  plaintiffs  have  a  right  to  recover  for  all  losses  proximately
caused  by  [defendant’s]  tortious  conduct.  The  evidence  does  not
preponderate  against  the  ﬁnding  of  damages  in  the  amount  of  the
$25,000.00.

Based on the foregoing ﬁndings, we afﬁrm the trial court’s Ruling

in its entirety.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Negligent  Misrepresentation  Elements.   While  both  fraud  and
negligent  misrepresentation  require  a  false  representation  there  are
signiﬁcant other differences, one of which was alluded to by the court
above.  Fraud  requires  knowledge  of  the  falsity,  or  at
least
recklessness  regarding  truth.  Negligent  misrepresentation  only
requires  the  defendant  to  be  careless  regarding  the  truthfulness  of
the information shared. This tort is also narrower in that it is only to
be applied in situations where the defendant provides the information
in the course of her business or a transaction in which the defendant
has  a  pecuniary  interest.  Technically  one  can  by  liable  for  fraud  for
influencing  the  plaintiff  to  enter  into  a  transaction  with  a  third  party

even  if  the  defendant  had  no  interest  in  the  transaction.  In  this  way,
this  tort  can  be  viewed  as  somewhat  narrow  in  application.  Further,
the  defendant  in  a  negligent  misrepresentation  case  should  only  be
liable toward someone whom the defendant intended to influence in
providing  the  representation.  The  full  meaning  of  this  will  be
discussed  in  the  next  section  under  Duty  Revisited.  Finally,  many
courts hold that a plaintiff in a negligent misrepresentation case may
only recover for pecuniary harm, as opposed to lost proﬁts from the
transaction.  In  other  words,  expenses  incurred  or  sums  lost  out  of
pocket  might  be  proper  recoveries  in  a  negligent  misrepresentation
case.  In  Staggs,  what  evidence  supported  the  ﬁnding  in  favor  of
plaintiff on each of these elements?

2. Silence as Negligent Misrepresentation?  Many courts have been
reluctant to apply the tort of negligent misrepresentation to instances
of  silence — in  effect,  often  holding  that  there
is  no  duty  to
afﬁrmatively disclose information under this theory. Jurisdictions are
fairly mixed on this issue, with some courts holding that silence can
never  give  rise  to  a  negligent  misrepresentation  claim  (see  Eberts  v.
Goderstad,  569  F.3d  757  (7th  Cir.  2009)  (following  the  logic  that  the
Restatement only refers to “supply[ing] false information” rather than
to  silence)  and  others  reaching  contrary  holdings  (see  In  re
Agrobiotech, Inc., 291 F. Supp. 2d 1186 (D. Nev. 2003).

3. Justiﬁable Reliance and Comparative Fault.  The court in Staggs
found  that  there  was  no  inconsistency  between  the  ﬁnding  that
plaintiff  had  justiﬁably  relied  on  the  misrepresentations  yet  had
committed comparative fault in relying upon the misrepresentations.
To the extent that a court applies a “reasonable person” standard to
the  justiﬁable  reliance  issue  (as  was  discussed  earlier  under  the
Fraud section) do you see any inconsistency here? On the other hand,
if  courts  essentially  apply  a  gross  negligence  standard  (i.e.,  did  the
plaintiff ignore obvious red flags?) to the justiﬁable reliance issue and
an  ordinary  care  standard  to  comparative  fault,  there  would  be  no
such potential inconsistency. This is an area of the law that remains

undeveloped.  With  regard  to  express  disclaimers  of  reliance,  as  we
saw in fraud cases in the prior section, courts have been willing under
the proper circumstances to allow an express provision in the parties’
contract  disclaiming  reliance  on  any  representations  to  negate  a
cause of action for negligent misrepresentation.

B. Duty Revisited

Negligent  misrepresentation  is  a  very  particular  subspecies  of  a
negligence  cause  of  action,  applicable  in  only  particular  instances
losses.  As  with  other
and  providing  relief  only  for  pecuniary
negligence  causes  of  action,  however,  a  signiﬁcant  issue  in  many
negligent  misrepresentation  claims  is  the  fundamental  question  of
duty. Clearly when a professional represents a client there will be no
serious  question  about  any  duty  of  care.  In  fact,  when  the  client  is
hurt  by  bad  advice  or  “representations,”  courts  will  often  just  treat  it
as a “malpractice” claim. But what about someone who has not hired
representations
the  professional  but
carelessly  made  by  the  professional?  Does  the  professional  owe  a
duty  of  care  regarding  her  representations  toward  this  non-client?
Courts  around  the  country  have  taken,  and  continue  to  take,  three
different  views  regarding  this  duty  issue.  The  Bily  case  below
represents  the  majority  view  and  offers  a  very  comprehensive
discussion  of  the  matter.  As  you  read  the  court’s  description  of  the
three  competing  schools  of  thought  on  the  issue  of  duty,  which  one
do you prefer?

BILY v. ARTHUR YOUNG & CO.
834 P.2d 745 (Cal. 1992)

     , C.J.

[Investors

in  Osborne  Computer  Corporation — a  computer
manufacturing  company — brought  this
litigation  against  Arthur
Young. The business was founded in 1980 by the entrepreneur Adam
Osborne and put on the market the ﬁrst portable personal computer.

By fall of 1982, sales of the company’s Osborne I computer were
quite  good  and  the  ﬁrm  began  planning  for  initial  public  offering  in
1982.  To  assist  with  this  IPO,  the  company  hired  Arthur  Young  to
prepare  audit  reports  for  the  recent  two  years.  Arthur  Young  issued
an  unqualiﬁed  opinion  on  February  11,  1983.  However,  at  the
suggestion of underwriters, the offering was postponed.

In the meantime, in order to obtain needed ﬁnancing, the company
issued  warrants  to  investors  (individuals  and  venture  capitals)  in
exchange  for  direct  loans.  The  warrants  entitled  their  holders  to
purchase blocks of the company’s stock at favorable prices.

As  the  warrant  transactions  closed  on  April  8,  1983,  the
company’s performance began to deteriorate. Sales declined sharply,
promotion of the new “Executive” computer model turned out to be a
disaster.  Public  offering  never  materialized.  The  company  had  to  ﬁle
for bankruptcy on September 13, 1983. Plaintiffs, who ultimately lost
their investments, claimed that in their investments they relied heavily

The  negligence  instructions  stated  in  part  that  an  independent
auditor has a duty to have the degree of skill and learning possessed
by reputable certiﬁed public accountants in the same community and
to use “reasonable diligence and its best judgment in the exercise of
its professional skill.”

With  respect  to  liability  to  third  parties,  negligence  instructions
were to the effect that: “An accountant owes a further duty of care to
those third parties who reasonably and foreseeably rely on an audited
ﬁnancial statement prepared by the accountant. A failure to fulﬁll any
such duty is negligence.”

We  granted  review  to  consider  whether  and  to  what  extent  an
accountant’s duty of care in the preparation of an independent audit
of  a  client’s  ﬁnancial  statements  extends  to  persons  other  than  the
client.

Since Chief Judge Cardozo’s seminal opinion in Ultramares  Corp.
v. Touche, 174 N.E. 441 (N.Y. 1931) (Ultramares), the issue before us
has  been  frequently  considered  and  debated  by  courts  and
commentators.  Different  schools  of  thought  have  emerged.  At  the
center of the controversy are difﬁcult questions concerning the role of
the  accounting  profession  in  performing  audits,  the  conceivably
limitless  scope  of  an  accountant’s  liability  to  nonclients  who  may
come to read and rely on audit reports, and the effect of tort liability
rules on the availability, cost, and reliability of those reports.

We  will  analyze  these  questions  by  discussing  the  purpose  and
effect of audits and audit reports, the approaches taken by courts and
commentators, and the basic principles of tort liability announced in
our prior cases. We conclude that an auditor owes no general duty of

care  regarding  the  conduct  of  an  audit  to  persons  other  than  the
client.  An  auditor  may,  however,  be  held
liable  for  negligent
misrepresentations  in  an  audit  report  to  those  persons  who  act  in
reliance  upon  those  misrepresentations  in  a  transaction  which  the
auditor intended to influence, in accordance with the rule of §552 of
the Restatement (Second) of Torts, as adopted and discussed below.
Finally,  an  auditor  may  also  be  held  liable  to  reasonably  foreseeable

THE AUDIT FUNCTION IN PUBLIC ACCOUNTING

Although  certiﬁed  public  accountants  (CPA’s)  perform  a  variety  of
services for their clients, their primary function, which is the one that
most frequently generates lawsuits against them by third persons, is
ﬁnancial  auditing.  “In  an  audit  engagement,  an  accountant  reviews
ﬁnancial  statements  prepared  by  a  client  and  issues  an  opinion
stating whether such statements fairly represent the ﬁnancial status
of the audited entity.” Siliciano, supra, 86 Mich. L. Rev. at p. 1931.

In a typical audit, a CPA ﬁrm may verify the existence of tangible
assets,  observe  business  activities,  and  conﬁrm  account  balances
and  mathematical  computations.  It  might  also  examine  sample
transactions  or  records  to  ascertain  the  accuracy  of  the  client
company’s ﬁnancial and accounting systems.

For  practical  reasons  of  time  and  cost,  an  audit  rarely,  if  ever,
examines every accounting transaction in the records of a business.
The  planning  and  execution  of  an  audit  therefore  require  a  high
degree of professional skill and judgment.

The  end  product  of  an  audit  is  the  audit  report  or  opinion.  The
report  is  generally  expressed  in  a  letter  addressed  to  the  client.  The
body  of  the  report  refers  to  the  speciﬁc  client-prepared  ﬁnancial
statements  which  are  attached.  In  the  case  of  the  so-called
“unqualiﬁed report” (of which Arthur Young’s report on the company’s

1982  ﬁnancial  statements  is  an  example),  two  paragraphs  are
relatively standard.

In  a  scope  paragraph,  the  CPA  ﬁrm  asserts  that  it  has  examined
the  accompanying  ﬁnancial  statements  in  accordance  with  GAAS.
GAAS  are  promulgated  by  the  American  Institute  of  Certiﬁed  Public
Accountants  (AICPA),  a  national  professional  organization  of  CPA’s,
whose  membership  is  open  to  persons  holding  certiﬁed  public
accountant certiﬁcates issued by state boards of accountancy.

In an opinion paragraph, the audit report generally states the CPA
ﬁrm’s opinion that the audited ﬁnancial statements, taken as a whole,
are in conformity with GAAP and present fairly in all material respects
the  ﬁnancial  position,  results  of  operations,  and  changes  in  ﬁnancial
position of the client in the relevant periods.

APPROACHES TO THE PROBLEM OF AUDITOR LIABILITY TO THIRD
PERSONS

The  complex  nature  of  the  audit  function  and
its  economic
implications  has  resulted  in  different  approaches  to  the  question
whether CPA auditors should be subjected to liability to third parties
who read and rely on audit reports. Although three schools of thought
are  commonly  recognized,  there  are  some  variations  within  each
school and recent case law suggests a possible trend toward merger
of two of the three approaches.

A  substantial  number  of  jurisdictions  follow  the  lead  of  Chief
Judge  Cardozo’s  1931  opinion  for  the  New  York  Court  of  Appeals  in
Ultramares, supra, 174 N.E. 441, by denying recovery to third parties
for  auditor  negligence  in  the  absence  of  a  third  party  relationship  to
is  “akin  to  privity.”  In  contrast,  a  handful  of
the  auditor  that
jurisdictions,  spurred  by  law  review  commentary,  have  recently
allowed recovery based on auditor negligence to third parties whose
reliance on the audit report was “foreseeable.”

Most  jurisdictions,  supported  by  the  weight  of  commentary  and
the modern English common law decisions cited by the parties, have
steered  a  middle  course  based  in  varying  degrees  on  Restatement
Second of Torts §552, which generally imposes liability on suppliers
of  commercial  information  to  third  persons  who  are  intended
beneﬁciaries  of  the  information.  Finally,  the  federal  securities  laws
have  also  dealt  with  the  problem  by  imposing  auditor  liability  for
negligence-related conduct only in connection with misstatements in
publicly ﬁled and distributed offering documents.

A. Privity of Relationship

In  Ultramares,  plaintiff  made  three  unsecured
loans  totalling
$165,000  to  a  company  that  went  bankrupt.  Plaintiff  sued  the
company’s  auditors,  claiming  reliance  on  their  audit  opinion  that  the
company’s balance sheet “present[ed] a true and correct view of the
ﬁnancial  condition  of  [the  company].”  Although  the  balance  sheet
showed  a  net  worth  of  $1  million,  the  company  was  actually
insolvent.  The  company’s  management  attempted  to  mask  its
ﬁnancial condition; the auditors failed to follow paper trails to “off-the-
books”  transactions  that,  if  properly  analyzed,  would  have  revealed
the company’s impecunious situation.

The  jury,  precluded  by  the  trial  judge  from  considering  a  fraud
cause  of  action,  returned  a  verdict  in  plaintiff’s  favor  based  on  the
auditor’s  negligence  in  conducting  the  audit.  The  New  York  Court  of
Appeals, speaking through Chief Judge Cardozo, reinstated the fraud
cause of action but set aside the negligence verdict.

With respect to the negligence claim, the court found the auditor
owed no duty to the third party creditor for an “erroneous opinion.” In
an often quoted passage, it observed: “If liability for negligence exists,
a  thoughtless  slip  or  blunder,  the  failure  to  detect  a  theft  or  forgery
beneath the cover of deceptive entries, may expose accountants to a
liability  in  an  indeterminate  amount  for  an  indeterminate  time  to  an

indeterminate  class.  The  hazards  of  a  business  conducted  on  these
terms  are  so  extreme  as  to  enkindle  doubt  whether  a  flaw  may  not
these
the
in
exist
consequences.”

implication  of  a  duty

that  exposes

to

Although  acknowledging  the  demise  of  privity  of  contract  as  a
limitation on tort liability in the context of personal injury and property
damage,  the  court  distinguished  between  liability  arising  from  a
“physical force” and “the circulation of a thought or the release of the
explosive power resident in words.”

In summarizing its holding, the court emphasized that it was not
releasing auditors from liability to third parties for fraud but merely for
“honest  blunder.”  It  questioned  “whether  the  average  business  man
receiving a certiﬁcate without paying for it, and receiving it as one of a
multitude of possible investors, would look for anything more.”

From the cases cited by the parties, it appears at least nine states
purport to follow privity or near privity rules restricting the liability of
auditors  to  parties  with  whom  they  have  a  contractual  or  similar
relationship. In ﬁve states, this result has been reached by decisions
of their highest courts. In four other states, the rule has been enacted
by statute. Federal court decisions have held that the rule represents
the  law  of  three  additional  states  whose  highest  courts  have  not
expressly considered the question.

B. Foreseeability

Arguing  that  accountants  should  be  subject  to  liability  to  third
persons  on  the  same  basis  as  other  tortfeasors,  Justice  Howard
Wiener  advocated  rejection  of  the  rule  of  Ultramares  in  a  1983  law
review article. (Wiener, Common Law Liability of the Certified Public
Accountant for Negligent Misrepresentation  (1983)  20  San  Diego  L.
Rev. 233 [hereafter Wiener].) In its place, he proposed a rule based on
foreseeability of injury to third persons. Criticizing what he called the
“anachronistic  protection”  given  to  accountants  by  the  traditional

rules limiting third person liability, he concluded: “Accountant liability
based  on  foreseeable  injury  would  serve  the  dual  functions  of
injury  and  deterrence  of  negligent  conduct.
compensation  for
Moreover, it is a just and rational judicial policy that the same criteria
govern the imposition of negligence liability, regardless of the context
in which it arises. The accountant, the investor, and the general public
will  in  the  long  run  beneﬁt  when  the  liability  of  the  certiﬁed  public
accountant  for  negligent  misrepresentation  is  measured  by  the
foreseeability  standard.”  Under  the  rule  proposed  by  Justice  Wiener,
“[f]oreseeability of the risk would be a question of fact for the jury to
be  disturbed  on  appeal  only  where  there  is  insufﬁcient  evidence  to
support the ﬁnding.”

[The  supreme  courts  in  New  Jersey,  Wisconsin,  Mississippi,  and
an intermediate court of appeals in California have since adopted the
foreseeability  approach  ﬁrst  advocated  by  Justice  Wiener.
Nevertheless, in] the nearly 10 years since it was formally proposed,
the foreseeability approach has not attracted a substantial following.
And  at  least  four  state  supreme  courts  have  explicitly  rejected  the
foreseeability  approach  in  favor  of  the  Restatement’s  “intended
beneﬁciary”  approach  since  the  New  Jersey  court’s  decision  in
Rosenblum.

The  foreseeability  approach  has  also  encountered  substantial
criticism  from  commentators,  who  have  questioned,  among  other
matters, its failure to consider seriously the problem of indeterminate
liability  and  its  prediction  of  a  signiﬁcant  deterrent  effect  that  will
improve  the  quality  of  audit  reporting.  Other  commentators  have
disagreed.  The  body  of  scholarly  and  practical
is

C. The Restatement: Intent to Benefit Third Persons

Restatement (Second) of Torts §552 covers “Information Negligently
Supplied for the Guidance of Others.” It states a general principle that

one  who  negligently  supplies  false  information  “for  the  guidance  of
others  in  their  business  transactions”  is  liable  for  economic  loss
suffered  by  the  recipients  in  justiﬁable  reliance  on  the  information.
But the liability created by the general principle is expressly limited to
loss suffered: “(a) [B]y the person or one of a limited group of persons
for whose beneﬁt and guidance he intends to supply the information
or  knows  that  the  recipient  intends  to  supply  it;  and  (b)  through
reliance  upon  it  in  a  transaction  that  he  intends  the  information  to
influence or knows that the recipient so intends or in a substantially
similar transaction.” To paraphrase, a supplier of information is liable
for negligence to a third party only if he or she intends to supply the
information  for  the  beneﬁt  of  one  or  more  third  parties  in  a  speciﬁc
transaction or type of transaction identiﬁed to the supplier.

Comment (h) observes that the liability of a negligent supplier of
information is appropriately more narrowly restricted than that of an
intentionally  fraudulent  supplier.  It  also  notes  that  a  commercial
supplier of information has a legitimate concern as to the nature and
scope  of  the  client’s  transactions  that  may  expand  the  supplier’s
exposure  liability.  As  the  comment  states:  “In  many  situations  the
identity of the person for whose guidance the information is supplied
is of no moment to the person who supplies it, although the number
and  character  of  the  persons  to  be  reached  and  influenced,  and  the
nature and extent of the transaction for which guidance is furnished
may  be  vitally  important.  This is true  because the risk of  liability to
which  the  supplier  subjects  himself  by  undertaking  to  give  the
information,  while  it  may  not  be  affected  by  the  identity  of  the
person  for  whose  guidance  the  information  is  given,  is  vitally
affected  by  the  number  and  character  of  the  persons,  and
particularly  the  nature  and  the  extent  of  the  proposed  transaction.”
(Italics added.)

To offer a simple illustration of comment (h), an auditor engaged
to  perform  an  audit  and  render  a  report  to  a  third  person  whom  the
auditor  knows  is  considering  a  $10  million  investment  in  the  client’s

business is on notice of a speciﬁc potential liability. It may then act to
encounter, limit or avoid the risk. In contrast, an auditor who is simply
asked for a generic audit and report to the client has no comparable
notice.

Although the parties debate precisely how many states follow the
Restatement  rule,  a  review  of  the  cases  reveals  the  rule  has
somewhat  more  support  than  the  privity  of  relationship  rule  and
much more support than the foreseeability rule. At least 17 state and
federal decisions have endorsed the rule in this and related contexts.
Whatever  the  exact  number  of  states  that  have  endorsed  it,  the
if  not  most,  courts  a
Restatement  rule  has  been  for  many,
satisfactory  compromise  between
the
their  discomfort  with
traditional privity approach and the “specter of unlimited liability.”

In  attempting  to  ascertain  the  presence  of  an  intent  to  beneﬁt
third  parties  from  the  facts  of  particular  audit  engagements  and
inevitably
communications  with  auditors,  the  Restatement  rule
results  in  some  degree  of  uncertainty.  Dean  William  L.  Prosser,  the
Reporter  for  the  Restatement,  reflected  on  the  difﬁculty  of
formulating a comprehensive rule in this area:

The  problem  is  to  ﬁnd  language  which  will  eliminate  liability  to  the  very  large
information  may
class  of  persons  whom  almost  any  negligently  given
foreseeably reach and influence, and limit the liability, not to a particular plaintiff
deﬁned in advance, but to the comparatively small group whom the defendant
expects  and  intends  to  influence.  Neither  the  Reporter,  nor,  it  is  believed,  the
Advisers  nor  the  Council,  is  entirely  satisﬁed  with  the  language  of  Subsection
(2); and if anyone can do better, it will be most welcome.

Rest. 2d Torts, Tent. Draft No. 11 (Apr. 15, 1965) §552.

ANALYSIS OF AUDITOR’S LIABILITY TO THIRD PERSONS FOR
AUDIT OPINIONS

The  threshold  element  of  a  cause  of  action  for  negligence  is  the
existence of a duty to use due care toward an interest of another that

enjoys  legal  protection  against  unintentional  invasion.  Whether  this
essential  prerequisite  to  a  negligence  cause  of  action  has  been
satisﬁed in a particular case is a question of law to be resolved by the
court.

A judicial conclusion that a duty is present or absent is merely “a
shorthand statement . . . rather than an aid to analysis. . . . [D]uty, is
not  sacrosanct  in  itself,  but  only  an  expression  of  the  sum  total  of
those  considerations  of  policy  which  lead  the  law  to  say  that  the
particular  plaintiff  is  entitled  to  protection.”  Dillon  v.  Legg,  441  P.2d
912 (Cal. 1968).

We have employed a checklist of factors to consider in assessing
legal duty in the absence of privity of contract between a plaintiff and
a defendant:

The determination whether in a speciﬁc case the defendant will be held liable to
a third person not in privity is a matter of policy and involves the balancing of
various  factors,  among  which  are  the  extent  to  which  the  transaction  was
intended to affect the plaintiff, the foreseeability of harm to him, the degree of
certainty  that  the  plaintiff  suffered  injury,  the  closeness  of  the  connection
between  the  defendant’s  conduct  and  the  injury  suffered,  the  moral  blame
attached to the defendant’s conduct, and the policy of preventing future harm.

Biakanja v. Irving, 320 P.2d 16 (Cal. 1958).

Viewing  the  problem  before  us  in  light  of  the  factors  set  forth
above, we decline to permit all merely foreseeable third party users of
audit  reports  to  sue  the  auditor  on  a  theory  of  professional
negligence.  Our  holding  is  premised  on  three  central  concerns:  (1)
Given the secondary “watchdog” role of the auditor, the complexity of
the  professional  opinions  rendered  in  audit  reports,  and  the  difﬁcult
and  potentially  tenuous  causal  relationships  between  audit  reports
and  economic  losses  from  investment  and  credit  decisions,  the
auditor  exposed  to  negligence  claims  from  all  foreseeable  third
parties faces potential liability far out of proportion to its fault; (2) the
generally  more  sophisticated  class  of  plaintiffs  in  auditor  liability

cases (e.g., business lenders and investors) permits the effective use
of contract rather than tort liability to control and adjust the relevant
risks  through  “private  ordering”;  and  (3)  the  asserted  advantages  of
more accurate auditing and more efﬁcient loss spreading relied upon
by those who advocate a pure foreseeability approach are unlikely to
occur; indeed, dislocations of resources, including increased expense
and decreased availability of auditing services in some sectors of the
economy, are more probable consequences of expanded liability.

In a broad sense, economic injury to lenders, investors, and others
who  may  read  and  rely  on  audit  reports  is  certainly  “foreseeable.”
Foreseeability of injury, however, is but one factor to be considered in
the  imposition  of  negligence  liability.  Even  when  foreseeability  was
present,  we  have  on  several  recent  occasions  declined  to  allow
recovery on a negligence theory when damage awards threatened to
impose  liability  out  of  proportion  to  fault  or  to  promote  virtually
unlimited responsibility for intangible injury.

In  placing  explicit  limits  on  recovery  for  negligent  infliction  of
emotional  distress  by  accident  bystanders,  we  commented:
“‘[F]oreseeability’  ‘is  endless  because  [it],  like  light,  travels  indeﬁnitely
in  a  vacuum.’  [It]  proves  too  much.  .  .  .  Although  it  may  set  tolerable
limits for most types of physical harm, it provides virtually no limit on
liability  for  non-physical  harm.’  .  .  .  It  is  apparent  that  reliance  on
foreseeability  of  injury  alone  in  ﬁnding  a  duty,  and  thus  a  right  to
recover,  is  not  adequate  when  the  damages  sought  are  for  an
intangible  injury.  In  order  to  avoid  limitless  liability  out  of  all
proportion  to  the  degree  of  a  defendant’s  negligence,  and  against
which it is impossible to insure without imposing unacceptable costs
on  those  among  whom  the  risk  is  spread,  the  right  to  recover  for
negligently  caused  emotional  distress  must  be  limited.”  Thing  v.  La
Chusa, 71 P.2d 814 (Cal. 1989).

Emphasizing  the  important  role  of  policy  factors  in  determining
negligence, we observed that “there are clear judicial days on which a
court  can  foresee  forever  and  thus  determine  liability  but  none  on

judicially
which  that  foresight  alone  provides  a  socially  and
acceptable limit on recovery of damages for [an] injury.” Id. In line with
our  recent  decisions,  we  will  not  treat  the  mere  presence  of  a
foreseeable  risk  of  injury  to  third  persons  as  sufﬁcient,  standing
alone, to impose liability for negligent conduct.

In  view  of  the  factors  discussed  above,  judicial  endorsement  of
third  party  negligence  suits  against  auditors  limited  only  by  the
concept  of  foreseeability  raises  the  spectre  of  multibillion-dollar
professional liability that is distinctly out of proportion to: (1) the fault
of the auditor (which is necessarily secondary and may be based on
complex differences of professional opinion); and (2) the connection
between the auditor’s conduct and the third party’s injury (which will
often  be  attenuated  by  unrelated  business  factors  that  underlie
investment and credit decisions).

As a matter of economic and social policy, third parties should be
encouraged to rely on their own prudence, diligence, and contracting
power, as well as other informational tools. This kind of self-reliance
promotes sound investment and credit practices and discourages the
careless  use  of  monetary  resources.  If,  instead,  third  parties  are
simply  permitted  to  recover  from  the  auditor  for  mistakes  in  the
client’s ﬁnancial statements, the auditor becomes, in effect, an insurer
of  not  only  the  ﬁnancial  statements,  but  of  bad
loans  and
investments in general.

For the reasons stated above, we hold that an auditor’s liability for
general  negligence  in  the  conduct  of  an  audit  of  its  client  ﬁnancial
statements is conﬁned to the client, i.e., the person who contracts for
or  engages  the  audit  services.  Other  persons  may  not  recover  on  a
pure negligence theory.

One difﬁculty in considering the problem before us is that neither
the courts (ourselves included), the commentators, nor the authors of
the  Restatement  Second  of  Torts  have  made  clear  or  careful
distinctions  between  the  tort  of  negligence  and  the  separate  tort  of

negligent  misrepresentation.  The  distinction  is  important  not  only
because  of  the  different  statutory  bases  of  the  two  torts,  but  also
because it has practical implications for the trial of cases in complex
areas such as the one before us.

Negligent  misrepresentation  is  a  separate  and  distinct  tort,  a
species  of  the  tort  of  deceit.  “Where  the  defendant  makes  false
statements,  honestly  believing  that  they  are  true,  but  without
reasonable  ground  for  such  belief,  he  may  be  liable  for  negligent
misrepresentation,  a  form  of  deceit.”  5  Witkin,  Summary  of  Cal.  Law
(9th ed. 1988) Torts, §720 at p. 819.

Under certain circumstances, expressions of professional opinion
are treated as representations of fact. When a statement, although in
the  form  of  an  opinion,  is  “not  a  casual  expression  of  belief”  but  “a
deliberate afﬁrmation of the matters stated,” it may be regarded as a
positive assertion of fact. Moreover, when a party possesses or holds
itself out as possessing superior knowledge or special information or
expertise  regarding  the  subject  matter  and  a  plaintiff  is  so  situated
that
rely  on  such  supposed  knowledge,
information,  or  expertise,  the  defendant’s  representation  may  be
treated  as  one  of  material  fact.  There  is  no  dispute  that  Arthur
Young’s statements in audit opinions fall within these principles.

reasonably

it  may

But  the  person  or  “class  of  persons  entitled  to  rely  upon  the
representations  is  restricted  to  those  to  whom  or  for  whom  the
misrepresentations  were  made.  Even  though  the  defendant  should
have  anticipated  that  the  misinformation  might  reach  others,  he  is
not liable to them.” 5 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law, supra, Torts, §721
at p. 820.

Of  the  approaches  we  have  reviewed,  §552  of  the  Restatement
(Second)  of  Torts  subdivision  (b)  is  most  consistent  with  the
elements  and  policy
tort  of  negligent
foundations  of
misrepresentation.  The  rule  expressed  there  attempts  to  deﬁne  a
narrow  and  circumscribed  class  of  persons  to  whom  or  for  whom

the

representations  are  made.  In  this  way,  it  recognizes  commercial
realities  by  avoiding  both  unlimited  and  uncertain
liability  for
economic losses in cases of professional mistake and exoneration of
the  auditor  in  situations  where  it  clearly  intended  to  undertake  the
responsibility of influencing particular business transactions involving
third  persons.  The  Restatement  rule  thus  appears  to  be  a  sensible
and  moderate  approach  to  the  potential  consequences  of  imposing
unlimited negligence liability which we have identiﬁed.

We  recognize  the  rule  expressed  in  the  Restatement  Second  of
Torts  has  been  criticized  in  some  quarters  as  vague  and  potentially
arbitrary. In his article advocating a foreseeability rule, Justice Wiener
generally criticized the Restatement rule as resting “solely on chance
considerations”  and  “fortuitousness”  (e.g.,  the  “state  of  the  mind  of
the accountant” and the scope of his engagement) having, in his view,
nothing to do with increasing the flow of accurate information.

We respectfully disagree. In seeking to identify a speciﬁc class of
persons  and  a  transaction  that  the  supplier  of  information  “intends
the information to influence,” the authors of the Restatement Second
of  Torts  have  applied  basic  factors  of  tort  liability  recognized  in  this
state and elsewhere. By conﬁning what might otherwise be unlimited
liability  to  those  persons  whom  the  engagement  is  designed  to
beneﬁt, the Restatement rule requires that the supplier of information
receive  notice  of  potential  third  party  claims,  thereby  allowing  it  to
ascertain  the  potential  scope  of  its  liability  and  make  rational
decisions  regarding  the  undertaking.  The  receipt  of  such  notice
justiﬁes  imposition  of  auditor  liability  for  conduct  that  is  merely
negligent.

The  Restatement  Second  of  Torts  approach  is  also  the  only  one
that  achieves  consistency  in  the  law  of  negligent  misrepresentation.
Accountants  are  not  unique
in  their  position  as  suppliers  of
information  and  evaluations  for  the  use  and  beneﬁt  of  others.  Other
professionals, including attorneys, architects, engineers, title insurers
and  abstractors,  and  others  also  perform  that  function.  And,  like

auditors,  these  professionals  may  also  face  suits  by  third  persons
claiming  reliance  on
in  a
professional capacity.

information  and  opinions  generated

to  defendant’s

By allowing recovery for negligent misrepresentation (as opposed
to  mere  negligence),  we  emphasize  the  indispensability  of  justiﬁable
reliance  on  the  statements  contained  in  the  report.  As  the  jury
instructions in this case illustrate, a general negligence charge directs
level  of  care  and  compliance  with
attention
professional  standards  established  by  expert  testimony,  as  opposed
to  plaintiff’s  reliance  on  a  materially  false  statement  made  by
defendant.  The  reliance  element  in  such  an  instruction  is  only
implicit–it  must  be  argued  and  considered  by  the  jury  as  part  of  its
evaluation  of  the  causal  relationship  between  defendant’s  conduct
and plaintiff’s injury. In contrast, an instruction based on the elements
of  negligent  misrepresentation  necessarily  and  properly  focuses  the
jury’s  attention  on  the  truth  or  falsity  of  the  audit  report’s
representations and plaintiff’s actual and justiﬁable reliance on them.
Because the audit report, not the audit itself, is the foundation of the
third  person’s  claim,  negligent  misrepresentation  more  precisely
captures  the  gravamen  of  the  cause  of  action  and  more  clearly
conveys the elements essential to a recovery.

Based  on  our  decision,  the  California  standard  jury  instructions
concerning negligent misrepresentation should be amended in future
auditor liability cases to permit the jury to determine whether plaintiff
belongs  to  the  class  of  persons  to  whom  or  for  whom  the
representations in the audit report were made.

DISPOSITION

This  case  was  tried  on  the  assumption  that  the  general  negligence
rule  and  foreseeability  approach  represented  California  law.  The  jury
was  instructed  in  accordance  with  that  approach.  For  the  reasons
stated  above,  we  have  rejected  [those  rules]  in  favor  of  a  negligent

misrepresentation  rule  substantially  in  accord  with  §552  of  the
Restatement (Second) of Torts. As a result, plaintiffs’ judgment based
on  the  general  negligence  rule  must  be  set  aside.  Because  plaintiffs
were not clients of Arthur Young, they were not entitled to recover on
a general negligence theory.

intentional  fraud.  Although

The  jury  also  rejected  plaintiffs’  causes  of  action  for  negligent
misrepresentation  and
it  was  not
instructed in accordance with the rules we have announced here, the
jury was told Arthur Young could be held liable for misrepresentation
to  “plaintiff  or  a  particular  class  of  persons  to  which  plaintiff
belonged.”  If  anything,  these  general  instructions  are  more  favorable
to  plaintiffs  than  the  ones  required  by  our  decision,  which  more
narrowly  and  speciﬁcally  deﬁnes  the  “class  of  persons”  entitled  to
recover.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Negligence and Negligent Misrepresentation.  The court spends
some  time  separately  considering  the  negligence  (i.e.,  malpractice)
claim  from  the  negligent  misrepresentation  claim,  holding  that  the
former  can  only  apply  to  clients.  With  respect  to  the  duty  regarding
negligent  misrepresentation  the  court  also  applies  a  limitation,  but
expands the scope of the duty potentially beyond one’s clients.

2.  Three  Competing  Views.   The  court  separately  describes  and
assesses  three  competing  views  regarding  to  whom  a  duty  of  care
would be owed for a negligent misrepresentation cause of action: (1)
the near strict-privity rule from Ultramares limiting the duty to those
in privity of contract with the professional supplier of information; (2)
a  broader,  more  flexible  rule  of  foreseeability,  holding  that  the
professional  owes  a  duty  of  care  toward  anyone  that  might
foreseeably receive (even indirectly) the representations and rely upon
them;  and  (3)  the  intermediate,  and  majority  view,  reflected  by  the

Restatement  (Second)  that  duty  is  only  owed  toward  those  who  the
defendant knows and intends to receive and rely upon it. What are the
relative merits of each position on this issue? Do you agree with the
court  that  the  intermediate  position  makes  the  most  sense?  Which
one is the most concrete and easy for courts to apply?

3. Problems.   How  would  courts  utilizing  the  three  different  duty

tests view the liability of the potential defendants below?

A.  Recall  the  hypothetical  from  the  Fraud  section  regarding  the
builder of rocking chairs who sincerely, but incorrectly, promises
a purchaser that he can build 50 chairs within a week’s time and
fails to deliver. Would the buyer have a good claim for negligent
misrepresentation in lieu of a fraud claim?

B.  Dell,  a  farmer,  seeks  a  business  loan  to  help  his  ailing  farm
operation and the lender agrees, subject to the receipt of a letter
from  a  lawyer  stating  that  a  lien  search  has  been  done  and
representing that there are no outstanding liens on any of Dell’s
equipment that will be used to secure the loan. Dell hires Juan, a
lawyer, to do this task. Juan sends such a letter of assurance to
the creditor but fails to accomplish the lien search and thereby
misrepresents that the equipment is unencumbered.

C.  Ramses,  a  ﬁnancial  analyst,  appears  on  the  Tonight  Show  and
tells the audience that the stock market is going to plummet and
that they should buy gold. A member of the television audience
watches  this  episode,  sells  all  his  stock  and  puts  all  of  his
investment  money  into  gold.  The  gold  market  falls  while  the
stock market increases.

IV  TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH CONTRACT

Claims  for  tortious  interference  with  business  relationships  have
legal  roots.  Nevertheless,  the  multi-billion-dollar
fairly  ancient
recovery  in  Pennzoil  v.  Texaco  did  much  to  bring  this  somewhat
obscure  cause  of  action  to  the  forefront  of  the  business  and  legal
communities. Regardless of the age of this legal theory and its recent
ascendance  in  attempted  application,  there  has  been  signiﬁcant
confusion  regarding  two  different  branches  of  this  area  of  law — (a)
intentional interference with existing contracts, versus (b) intentional
interference with merely prospective contractual relations. Before we
address  that  confusion  head  on,  it  is  worth  pausing  at  the  famous
case  of  M/V  Testbank  to  see  the  court’s  rejection  of  any  claim  for
negligent interference with a contract, as well as to greet (again) the
mere  economic  harm  rule  ﬁrst  encountered  in  Chapter  6,  Special
Duty Rules.

A. Rejection of Negligent Interference

STATE OF LOUISIANA v. M/V TESTBANK
752 F.2d 1019 (5th Cir. 1985)

            , J.

We  are  asked  to  abandon  physical  damage  to  a  proprietary
interest  as  a  prerequisite  to  recovery  for  economic  loss  in  cases  of
unintentional maritime tort. We decline the invitation.

I

In the early evening of July 22, 1980, the M/V Sea Daniel, an inbound
bulk  carrier,  and  the  M/V  Testbank,  an  outbound  container  ship,
collided at approximately mile forty-one of the Mississippi River Gulf
outlet. At impact, a white haze enveloped the ships until carried away
by  prevailing  winds,  and  containers  aboard  Testbank  were  damaged
and  lost  overboard.  The  white  haze  proved  to  be  hydrobromic  acid
and  the  contents  of  the  containers  which  went  overboard  proved  to
be  approximately  twelve  tons  of  pentachlorophenol,  PCP,  assertedly
the  largest  such  spill  in  United  States  history.  The  United  States
Coast Guard closed the outlet to navigation until August 10, 1980 and
all ﬁshing, shrimping, and related activity was temporarily suspended
in the outlet and four hundred square miles of surrounding marsh and
waterways.

Forty-one  lawsuits  were  ﬁled  and  consolidated  before  the  same
judge  in  the  Eastern  District  of  Louisiana.  These  suits  presented
claims  of  shipping  interests,  marina  and  boat  rental  operators,
wholesale  and  retail  seafood  enterprises  not  actually  engaged  in
ﬁshing,  seafood  restaurants,  tackle  and  bait  shops,  and  recreational
liability  theories,
ﬁshermen.  They  proffered  an  assortment  of
including  maritime  tort,  private  actions  pursuant  to  various  sections
of the Rivers & Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899 and rights of action
under  Louisiana  law.  Jurisdiction  rested  on  the  proposition  that  the
collision  and  contamination  were  maritime  torts  and  within  the
court’s maritime jurisdiction. See 28 U.S.C. §1333.

Defendants  moved  for  summary  judgment  as  to  all  claims  for
economic loss unaccompanied by physical damage to property. The
district court granted the requested summary judgment as to all such
claims  except  those  asserted  by  commercial  oystermen,  shrimpers,
crabbers  and  ﬁshermen  who  had  been  making  a  commercial  use  of
embargoed waters. The district court found these commercial ﬁshing
interests  deserving  of  a  special  protection  akin  to  that  enjoyed  by
seamen.

On  appeal  a  panel  of  this  court  afﬁrmed,  concluding  that  claims
for  economic
loss  unaccompanied  by  physical  damage  to  a
proprietary interest were not recoverable in maritime tort. The panel,
as did the district court, pointed to the doctrine of Robins Dry Dock &
Repair  Co.  v.  Flint,  275  U.S.  303  (1927),  and  its  development  in  this
circuit. Judge Wisdom specially concurred, agreeing that the denial of
these claims was required by precedent, but urging reexamination en
banc. We then took the case en banc for that purpose. After extensive
additional  briefs  and  oral  argument,  we  are  unpersuaded  that  we
ought  to  drop  physical  damage  to  a  proprietary  interest  as  a
prerequisite  to  recovery  for  economic  loss.  To  the  contrary,  our
reexamination  of  the  history  and  central  purpose  of  this  pragmatic
restriction  on
foreseeability  heightens  our
commitment to it. Ultimately we conclude that without this limitation
foreseeability loses much of its ability to function as a rule of law.

Plaintiffs ﬁrst argue that the “rule” of Robins Dry Dock is that “a tort to
the  property  of  one  which  results  in  the  negligent  interference  with
contractual relationships of another does not state a claim,” and that
so deﬁned, Robins Dry Dock  is  here  inapplicable.  Next  and  relatedly,
plaintiffs urge that physical damage is not a prerequisite to recovery
of  economic  loss  where  the  damages  suffered  were  foreseeable.
Third, plaintiffs argue that their claims are cognizable in maritime tort
because the pollution from the collision constituted a public nuisance
and  violated  the  Rivers  and  Harbors  Appropriation  Act  of  1899,  as
well as Louisiana law.

Defendants  urge  the  opposite:  that  Robins  Dry  Dock  controls
limitation  on

the  physical  damage

[and]

that

these  cases;
foreseeability ought to be retained.

The meaning of Robins Dry Dock v. Flint is the flag all litigants here
seek to capture. We turn ﬁrst to that case and to its historical setting.
Robins broke no new ground but instead applied a principle, then
settled both in the United States and England, which refused recovery
for  negligent  interference  with  “contractual  rights.”  Stated  more
broadly,  the  prevailing  rule  denied  a  plaintiff  recovery  for  economic
loss  if  that  loss  resulted  from  physical  damage  to  property  in  which
he had no proprietary interest. See, e.g., Byrd v. English, 43 S.E. 419
(Ga. 1903); Cattle v. Stockton Waterworks Co., 10 Q.B. 453, 457 (C.A.
1875).  See  also  James,  Limitations  on  Liability  for  Economic  Loss
Caused  by  Negligence:  A  Pragmatic  Appraisal,  25  Vand.  L.  Rev.  43,
44-46  (1972)  (discussing  history  of  the  rule);  Carpenter,  Interference
with Contract Relations, 41 Harv. L. Rev. 728 (1928). Professor James
explains  this  limitation  on  recovery  of  pure  economic  loss:  “The
explanation  .  .  .  is  a  pragmatic  one:  the  physical  consequences  of
negligence  usually  have  been  limited,  but  the  indirect  economic
repercussions  of  negligence  may  be  far  wider,  indeed  virtually  open-
ended.” James, supra, at 45.

Robins broke no new ground but instead applied a principle, then settled both in
the  United  States  and  England,  which  refused  recovery  for  negligent
interference with “contractual rights.”

Decisions  such  as  Stockton  illustrate  the  application  of  this
pragmatic  limitation  on  the  doctrine  of  foreseeability.  The  defendant
negligently  caused  its  pipes  to  leak,  thereby  increasing  the  plaintiff’s
cost  in  performing  its  contract  to  dig  a  tunnel.  The  British  court,
writing ﬁfty-two years before Robins, denied the plaintiff’s claim. The
court  explained  that  if  recovery  were  not  contained,  then  in  cases
such  as  Rylands  v. Fletcher,  1  L.R. — E.X.  265  (1866),  the  defendant
would be liable not only to the owner of the mine and its workers “but
also to . . . every workman and person employed in the mine, who in
consequence  of  its  stoppage  made  less  wages  than  he  would
otherwise have done.”

In Robins, the time charterer of a steamship sued for proﬁts lost
when  the  defendant  dry  dock  negligently  damaged  the  vessel’s
propeller.  The  propeller  had  to  be  replaced,  thus  extending  by  two
weeks the time the vessel was laid up in dry dock, and it was for the
loss of use of the vessel for that period that the charterer sued. The
Supreme Court denied recovery to the charterer, noting:

no authority need be cited to show that, as a general rule, at least, a tort to the
person  or  property  of  one  man  does  not  make  the  tortfeasor  liable  to  another
merely  because  the  injured  person  was  under  a  contract  with  that  other
unknown  to  the  doer  of  the  wrong.  The  law  does  not  spread  its  protection  so
far.

275  U.S.  at  309.  Justice  Holmes  did  not  stop  with  this  Delphic
language, but with a citation to three cases added a further signal to
his meaning:

A good statement, applicable here, will be found in Elliott Steam Tug Co., Ltd. v.
The  Shipping  Controller,  1  K.B.  127,  139,  140  (1922);  Byrd  v.  English,  43  S.E.
419 (Ga.); The Federal No. 2, 21 F.2d 313 (C.C.A. 1927).

Id.

The  plaintiff  in  Elliott  Steam  Tug  was  a  charterer  of  a  tug  boat
who  lost  proﬁts  when  the  vessel  was  requisitioned  by  the  admiralty
under  wartime  legislative  powers.  In  applying  an  indemnity  statute
that authorized recovery, the court noted that the charterer could not
have recovered at common law: “the charterer in collision cases does
not  recover  proﬁts,  not because the  loss of  profits during repairs is
not the direct consequence of the wrong, but because the common
law rightly or wrongly does not recognize him as able to sue for such
an  injury  to  his  mere  contractual  rights.”  Id.  at  140.  (emphasis
supplied). In Byrd v. English, recovery of lost proﬁts was denied when
a utility’s electrical conduits were negligently damaged by defendant,
cutting off power to plaintiff’s printing plant. In The Federal No. 2, the
third  case  cited  by  Justice  Holmes,  the  defendant  tug  negligently

injured  plaintiff’s  employee  while  he  was  working  on  a  barge.  The
Second  Circuit  denied  the  employer  recovery  from  the  tug  for  sums
paid  to  the  employee  in  maintenance  and  cure.  The  court  (Manton,
Swan and Augustus Hand) explained:

It is too indirect to insist that this may be recovered, where there is neither the
natural  right  nor  legal  relationship  between  the  appellant  and  the  tug,  even
though the alleged right of action be based upon negligence.

21 F.2d at 314.

The  principle  that  there  could  be  no  recovery  for  economic  loss
absent  physical  injury  to  a  proprietary  interest  was  not  only  well
established when Robins Dry Dock was decided, but was remarkably
resilient  as  well.  Its  strength  is  demonstrated  by  the  circumstance
that  Robins  Dry  Dock  came  ten  years  after  Judge  Cardozo’s
shattering of privity in MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co., 111 N.E. 1050
(N.Y. 1916). Indeed this limit on liability stood against a sea of change
in  the  tort  law.  Retention  of  this  conspicuous  bright-line  rule  in  the
face of the reforms brought by the increased influence of the school
of legal realism is strong testament both to the rule’s utility and to the
absence of a more “conceptually pure” substitute. The push to delete
the restrictions on recovery for economic loss lost its support and by
the early 1940’s had failed. See W. Prosser, Law of Torts §129, at 938-
940 (4th ed. 1971). In sum, it is an old sword that plaintiffs have here
picked up.

Plaintiffs  would  conﬁne  Robins  to  losses  suffered  for  inability  to
perform  contracts  between  a  plaintiff  and  others,  categorizing  the
tort  as  a  species  of  interference  with  contract.  When  seen  in  the
historical  context  described  above,  however,  it  is  apparent  that
Robins  Dry  Dock  represents  more  than  a  limit  on  recovery  for
interference  with  contractual  rights.  Apart  from  what  it  represented
and certainly apart from what it became, its literal holding was not so
restricted.  If  a  time  charterer’s  relationship  to  its  negligently  injured

vessel is too remote, other claimants without even the connection of
a contract are even more remote.

In a sense, every claim of economic injury rests in some measure
on an interference with contract or prospective advantage. It was only
in  this  sense  that  proﬁts  were  lost  in  Byrd  v.  English  when  the
electrical  power  to  plaintiffs  printing  plant  was  cut  off.  The  printing
company’s contractual right to receive power was interfered with, and
in  turn,  its  ability  to  print  for  its  customers  was  impinged.  That  the
printing  company  had  a  contract  with  the  power  company  did  not
make more remote the relationship between its loss of proﬁts and the
tortious  acts.  To  the  contrary,  the  contract  reduced  this  remoteness
by deﬁning an orbit of predictable injury smaller than if there were no
contract between the power company and the printer. When the loss
is  economic  rather  than  physical,  that  the  loss  caused  a  breach  of
contract  or  denied  an  expectancy  is  of  no  moment.  If  a  plaintiff
connected  to  the  damaged  chattels  by  contract  cannot  recover,
others more remotely situated are foreclosed a fortiori.  Indisputably,
the  Robins Dry  Dock  principle  is  not  as  easily  contained  as  plaintiff
would  have  it.  We  turn  to  our  application  of  the  principle,  its
application in other circuits, and the tort law of our Gulf states before
returning to the doctrine itself.

This  circuit  has  consistently  refused  to  allow  recovery  for
economic  loss  absent  physical  damage  to  a  proprietary  interest.  In
Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corp. v. Marshland Dredging Co., Inc.,
455  F.2d  957  (5th  Cir.  1972),  the  plaintiff  lost  gas  supplies  when  the
defendant negligently broke a gas pipeline. We held that because the
interference  with  Kaiser’s  business  was  only  negligently  inflicted,
recovery  was  precluded  as  a  matter  of  law.  In  Dick  Meyers  Towing
Service, Inc. v. United States, 577 F.2d 1023 (5th Cir. 1978), we denied
recovery to a tug boat operator for damages suffered when a lock on
Alabama’s  Warrior  River  was  closed  as  a  result  of  defendant’s
negligence. We explained:

The  law  has  traditionally  been  reluctant  to  recognize  claims  based  solely  on
harm to the interest in contractual relations or business expectancy. The critical
factor  is  the  character  of  the  interest  harmed  and  not  the  number  of  parties
involved.

Id. at 1025.

In Union Oil, vast quantities of raw crude were released when the
defendant  oil  company  negligently  caused  an  oil  spill.  The  oil  was
carried  by  wind,  wave,  and  tidal  currents  over  large  stretches  of  the
California  coast  disrupting,  among  other  things,  commercial  ﬁshing
operations.  While  conceding  that  ordinarily  there  is  no  recovery  for
economic  losses  unaccompanied  by  physical  damage,  the  court
concluded  that  commercial  ﬁshermen  were  foreseeable  plaintiffs
whose  interests  the  oil  company  had  a  duty  to  protect  when
conducting  drilling  operations.  The  opinion  pointed  out  that  the
ﬁshermen’s losses were foreseeable and direct consequences of the
spill,  that  ﬁshermen  have  historically  enjoyed  a  protected  position
under  maritime  law,  and  suggested  that  economic  considerations
also supported permitting recovery.

Yet  Union  Oil’s  holding  was  carefully  limited  to  commercial
ﬁshermen,  plaintiffs  whose  economic  losses  were  characterized  as
“of  a  particular  and  special  nature.”  501  F.2d  at  570.  The  Union  Oil
panel  expressly  declined  to  “open  the  door  to  claims  that  may  be
asserted by . . . other[s] . . . whose economic or personal affairs were
discommoded by the oil spill” and noted that the general rule denying
recovery  for  pure  economic  loss  had  “a  legitimate  sphere  within
which to operate.”

A substantial argument can be made that commercial ﬁshermen
possess a proprietary interest in ﬁsh in waters they normally harvest
sufﬁcient  to  allow  recovery  for  their  loss.  Whether  the  claims  of
commercial ﬁshermen ought to be analyzed in this manner or simply
carved from the rule today announced, in the fashion of Union Oil,  or
allowed  at  all,  we  leave  for  later.  That  is,  today’s  decision  does  not

foreclose  free  consideration  by  a  court  panel  of  the  claims  of
commercial ﬁshermen.

In sum, the decisions of courts in other circuits convince us that
Robins  Dry  Dock  is  both  a  widely  used  and  necessary  limitation  on
recovery for economic losses. The holdings in Kinsman and Union Oil
are  not  to  the  contrary.  The  courts  in  both  those  cases  made  plain
that restrictions on the concept of foreseeability ought to be imposed
where recovery is sought for pure economic losses.

Jurisprudence developed in the Gulf states informs our maritime
decisions. It supports the Robins rule. Courts applying the tort law of
Texas,  Georgia,  Florida,  Alabama,  Mississippi  and  Louisiana  have
consistently denied recovery for economic losses negligently inflicted
where there was no physical damage to a proprietary interest.

IV

Plaintiffs urge that the requirement of physical injury to a proprietary
interest  is  arbitrary,  unfair,  and  illogical,  as  it  denies  recovery  for
foreseeable  injury  caused  by  negligent  acts.  At  its  bottom  the
argument is that questions of remoteness ought to be left to the trier
of  fact.  Ultimately  the  question  becomes  who  ought  to  decide —
judge or jury — and whether there will be a rule beyond the jacket of a
given  case.  The  plaintiffs  contend  that  the  “problem”  need  not  be
separately  addressed,  but  instead  should  be  handled  by  “traditional”
principles  of  tort  law.  Putting  the  problem  of  which  doctrine  is  the
traditional  one  aside,  their  rhetorical  questions  are  flawed  in  several
respects.

Those who would delete the requirement of physical damage have
no  rule  or  principle  to  substitute.  Their  approach  fails  to  recognize
limits upon the adjudicating ability of courts. We do not mean just the
ability to supply a judgment; prerequisite to this adjudicatory function
are  preexisting  rules,  whether  the  creature  of  courts  or  legislatures.
Courts can decide cases without preexisting normative guidance but

the  result  becomes
managerial, legislative or negotiated function.

less

judicial  and  more  the  product  of  a

Review  of  the  foreseeable  consequences  of  the  collision  of  the
Sea  Daniel  and  Testbank  demonstrates  the  wave  upon  wave  of
successive  economic  consequences  and  the  managerial  role
plaintiffs would have us assume. The vessel delayed in St. Louis may
be unable to fulﬁll its obligation to haul from Memphis, to the injury of
the  shipper,  to  the  injury  of  the  buyers,  to  the  injury  of  their
customers.  Plaintiffs  concede,  as  do  all  who  attack  the  requirement
of physical damage, that a line would need to be drawn — somewhere
on  the  other  side,  each  plaintiff  would  say  in  turn,  of  its  recovery.
Plaintiffs  advocate  not  only  that  the  lines  be  drawn  elsewhere  but
also that they be drawn on an ad hoc and discrete basis. The result
would be that no determinable measure of the limit of foreseeability
would  precede  the  decision  on  liability.  We  are  told  that  when  the
claim  is  too  remote,  or  too  tenuous,  recovery  will  be  denied.
Presumably  then,  as  among  all  plaintiffs  suffering  foreseeable
economic loss, recovery will turn on a judge or jury’s decision. There
will be no rationale for the differing results save the “judgment” of the
trier of fact. Concededly, it can “decide” all the claims presented, and
with  comparative  if  not  absolute  ease.  The  point  is  not  that  such  a
process cannot be administered but rather that its judgments would
be  much  less  the  products  of  a  determinable  rule  of  law.  In  this
important  sense,  the  resulting  decisions  would  be  judicial  products
only in their draw upon judicial resources.

The  bright  line  rule  of  damage  to  a  proprietary  interest,  as  most,
has  the  virtue  of  predictability  with  the  vice  of  creating  results  in
cases at its edge that are said to be “unjust” or “unfair.” Plaintiffs point
to seemingly perverse results, where claims the rule allows and those
it disallows are juxtaposed — such as vessels striking a dock, causing
minor  but  recoverable  damage,  then  lurching  athwart  a  channel
causing  great  but  unrecoverable  economic  loss.  The  answer  is  that
when  lines  are  drawn  sufﬁciently  sharp  in  their  deﬁnitional  edges  to

be reasonable and predictable, such differing results are the inevitable
result — indeed, decisions are the desired product. But there is more.
The line drawing sought by plaintiffs is no less arbitrary because the
line drawing appears only in the outcome — as one claimant is found
too  remote  and  another  is  allowed  to  recover.  The  true  difference  is
that  plaintiffs’  approach  would  mask  the  results.  The  present  rule
would  be  more  candid,  and  in  addition,  by  making  results  more
predictable, serves a normative function. It operates as a rule of law
and allows a court to adjudicate rather than manage.

VII

In  conclusion,  having  reexamined  the  history  and  central  purpose  of
the  doctrine  of  Robins  Dry  Dock  as  developed  in  this  circuit,  we
remain  committed  to
its  teaching.  Denying  recovery  for  pure
economic  losses  is  a  pragmatic  limitation  on  the  doctrine  of
foreseeability, a limitation we ﬁnd to be both workable and useful.

Accordingly,  the  decision  of  the  district  court  granting  summary
losses

judgment  to  defendants  on  all  claims  for  economic
unaccompanied by physical damage to property is AFFIRMED.

Robins  is  the  Tar  Baby  of  tort  law  in  this  circuit.  And  the  brier-
patch  is  far  away.  This  Court’s  application  of  Robins  is  out  of  step
with  contemporary  tort  doctrine,  works  substantial  injustice  on
innocent  victims,  and  is  unsupported  by  the  considerations  that
justiﬁed the Supreme Court’s 1927 decision.

Robins  was  a  tort  case  grounded  on  a  contract.  Whatever  the
justiﬁcation  for  the  original  holding,  this  Court’s  requirement  of
physical  injury  as  a  condition  to  recovery  is  an  unwarranted  step
backwards  in  torts  jurisprudence.  The  resulting  bar  for  claims  of

economic  loss  unaccompanied  by  any  physical  damage  conflicts
with  conventional  tort  principles  of  foreseeability  and  proximate
cause.  I  would  analyze  the  plaintiffs’  claims  under  these  principles,
using the “particular damage” requirement of public nuisance law as
an  additional  means  of  limiting  claims.  Although  this  approach
requires  a  case-by-case  analysis,  it  comports  with  the  fundamental
idea of fairness that innocent plaintiffs should receive compensation
and negligent defendants should bear the cost of their tortious acts.
Such  a  result  is  worth  the  additional  costs  of  adjudicating  these
claims,  and  this  rule  of  liability  appears  to  be  more  economically
efﬁcient.  Finally,  this  result  would  relieve  courts  of  the  necessity  of
manufacturing  exceptions  totally  inconsistent  with  the  expanded
Robins rule of requiring physical injury as a prerequisite to recovery.

ALTERNATE STATEMENT OF THE CASE

A. Factual Background

On  July  22,  1980,  at  8:44  p.m.,  the  inbound  bulk  carrier  M/V  Sea
Daniel  collided  with  the  outbound  container  ship  M/V  Testbank  at
Mile 41 of the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet Channel. This channel is a
66-mile,  man-made  shortcut  between  New  Orleans  and  the  Gulf  of
Mexico.  Immediately  following  the  collision,  a  cloud  of  hydrobromic
acid mist enveloped the ships from ruptured containers onboard the
Testbank. The prevailing winds carried the acid cloud to Shell Beach,
Louisiana,  a  little  town  downwind  of  the  collision.  The  collision
damaged  several  containers  on  the  Testbank,  which  were  then  lost
overboard.  One  of  these  containers  held  about  twelve  tons  of
pentachlorophenol  (PCP)  in  ﬁfty-pound  bags.  This  was  the  largest
PCP  spill  in  the  United  States  history.  [The  PCP  involved  here  is
distinct  from  “angel  dust,”  which  is  also  often  designated  by  the
initials PCP.]

The  same  day,  Civil  Defense  and  local  authorities  evacuated  all
residents  within  a  ten-mile  radius  of  the  collision.  The  Coast  Guard

closed the Outlet to vessel navigation. Health ofﬁcials suspended all
ﬁshing, shrimping, and associated activities on the Outlet and within
about  400  square  miles  of  surrounding  Louisiana  waterways  and
marshes.  They  also  embargoed  seafood  and  shellﬁsh  caught  in  the
area  and  widely  broadcast  notice  of  this  embargo.  The  closure  and
suspensions lasted through mid-August.

The  commercial  ﬁshing  industry  in  the  area  sustained  serious
losses,  primarily  from  the  depressed  market  in  that  industry  in
southern  Louisiana.  Other  businesses  suffered  losses.  Numerous
parties  ﬁled  suit  against  the  vessels  and  their  owners,  seeking
compensation for their expenses and their lost proﬁts caused by the
collision, pollution, and bans to navigation and ﬁshing. The claimants
may be classiﬁed as follows:

(1)  commercial  ﬁshermen,  crabbers,  oystermen,  and  shrimpers  who

routinely operated in and around the closed area;

(2)  ﬁshermen,  crabbers,  oystermen,  and  shrimpers  who  engaged  in  these

practices only for recreation;

(3) operators of marinas and boat rentals, and marine suppliers;
(4) tackle and bait shops;
(5) wholesale and retail seafood enterprises not actually engaged in ﬁshing,

shrimping, crabbing, or oystering in the closed area;

(6) seafood restaurants;
(7) cargo terminal operators;
(8) an operator of railroad freight cars seeking demurrage;
(9) vessel operators seeking expenses (demurrage, crew costs, tug hire) and

losses of revenues caused by the closure of the outlet.

B. Difficulties with Subsequent Extensions

It is a long step from Robins to a rule that requires physical damage
as  a  prerequisite  to  recovery  in  maritime  tort.  The  majority  believes
that the plaintiff’s lack of any contractual connection with an injured
party,  taken  with  the  Robins  rule,  forecloses  liability:  “If  a  plaintiff
connected  to  the  damaged  chattels  by  contract  cannot  recover,

others  more  remotely  situated  are  foreclosed  a  fortiori.”  This
conclusion  follows  readily  from  the  reasoning  that  if  uninjured
contracting  parties  are  barred  from  recovery,  and  if  contracting
parties  have  a  closer  legal  relationship  than  non-contracting  parties,
then  a  party  who  is  not  physically  injured  and  who  does  not  have  a
contractual relation to the damage is surely barred.

This  argument  would  be  sound  in  instances  where  the  plaintiff
suffered  no  loss  but for a contract  with  the  injured  party.  We  would
measure  a  plaintiff’s  connection  to  the  tortfeasor  by  the  only  line
connecting them, the contract, and disallow the claim under Robins.
In the instant case, however, some of the plaintiffs suffered damages
whether  or  not  they  had  a  contractual  connection  with  a  party
physically  injured  by  the  tortfeasor.  These  plaintiffs  do  not  need  to
rely  on  a  contract  to  link  them  to  the  tort:  The  collision  proximately
caused  their  losses,  and  those  losses  were  foreseeable.  These
plaintiffs  are  therefore  freed  from  the  Robins  rule  concerning  the
recovery of those who suffered economic loss because of an injury to
a party with whom they have contracted.

CONCLUSION

The Robins approach restricts liability more severely than the policies
behind  limitations  on  liability  require  and  imposes  the  cost  of  the
accident  on  the  victim,  who  is  usually  not  in  a  superior  position  to
obtain  insurance  to  cover  this  loss.  I  would  apply  a  rule  of  recovery
based  on  conventional  tort  principles  of  proximate  cause  and
foreseeability  and  limit  eligibility  only  by  the  requirement  that  a
claimant prove “particular” damages.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Overlap  Between  the  Mere  Economic  Harm  Rule  and  Failure  to
Recognize  Negligent  Interference  with  Contract.   This  case  can  be

understood in light of two parallel, but not identical, doctrines. One is
the fairly stubborn refusal by courts to recognize a cause of action for
negligent  interference  by  a  third  party  with  another’s  contractual
performance,  even  where  it  is  foreseeable  that  such  unintended
interference might cause losses to another in privity of contract. The
other  is  the  fairly  rigid  adherence  to  the  “mere  economic  loss”  rule
that  we  encountered  in  Chapter  6,  Special  Duty  Rules.  Part  of  the
Fifth  Circuit’s  discussion  in  the  foregoing  case  concerns  its  view  on
whether  the  Robins  decision  was  just  an  application  of  the  rule
rejecting  negligent  interference  with  contract  as  a  recognized  cause
of  action  or,  rather,  whether  it  involved  application  of  the  broader
mere economic loss rule. Do you see how either rule would have hurt
the  plaintiff’s  claims  in  Robins,  but  how  application  of  the  latter  rule
was necessary to dismiss most of the plaintiffs’ claims here?

2. Modern Adherence to Mere Economic Harm Rule.  Do you prefer
the bright line approach reafﬁrmed by the Fifth Circuit or the dissent’s
approach of just employing traditional tort stalwarts of foreseeability
and proximate cause to determine, on a case-by-case approach, how
far  liability  should  extend?  Is  one  approach  better  or  worse  for
commerce?

3.  Strict  Products  Liability  Application.   Another  common
manifestation  of  the  economic  loss  rule  is  in  the  area  of  strict
products  liability.  Courts  uniformly  hold  that  where  the  defect  in  a
product  only  causes  injury  to  the  product  itself — rather  than  also
causing personal injuries or harm to other property — the only cause
of  action  lies  in  contract  law  (i.e.,  warranty)  rather  than  tort  law.  As
one court surmised, after surveying holdings from many jurisdictions,
“the United States Supreme Court, the overwhelming majority of state
legal  scholars  have  recognized  the  unfairness  of
courts,  and
imposing  on  a  seller  [of  defective  goods]  tort  liability  for  economic
loss.”  Alloway  v.  General  Marine  Industries,  L.P.,  695  A.2d  264,  271
(N.J.  1997)  (plaintiff’s  attempt  to  recover  for  lost  value/repairs  to
defective boat on tort theories held invalid). The thought seems to be

that tort theories were made more for unreasonable risks of harm to
persons  and  other  property  than  for  unmet  expectations  regarding
the subject of the transaction. The draft of the Third Restatement of
Torts also concurs in this line of reasoning.

4. Policy Justiﬁcations?  We will next be turning to a discussion of
the cause of action entitled tortious interference with contract, which
is an intentional tort. Why would courts be so reluctant to recognize
as  actionable  interference  that  is  merely  negligent  as  opposed  to
intentional?

B. Intentional Interference with Contract

A  relatively  old  business  tort  exists  for  “tortious  interference  with  a
contractual  relationship.”  The  Restatement  (Second)  describes  this
tort as follows:

improperly

intentionally  and

One  who
interferes  with  the
performance  of  a  contract  (except  a  contract  to  marry)  between
another  and  a  third  person  by  inducing  or  otherwise  causing  the
third  person  not  to  perform  the  contract,  is  subject  to  liability  to
the  other  for  the  pecuniary  loss  resulting  to  the  other  from  the
failure of the third person to perform the contract.

Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts  §766  (1965).  This  is  an  interesting
concept  because  contract  law  does  not  consider  the  intentional
breach  by  a  contracting  party  as  a  tort  subject  to  tort  remedies.  On
the other hand, when one who is a stranger to the contract interferes
with  the  performance  of  the  contract,  courts  consider  this  to  be
actionable in tort. Consider the justiﬁcation for imposing such liability
as you read the facts from the famous old English case of Lumley v.
Gye below.

    , J.

The question raised upon this demurrer is, Whether an action will
lie  by  the  proprietor  of  a  theatre  against  a  person  who  maliciously
procures an entire abandonment of a contract to perform exclusively
at  that  theatre  for  a  certain  time;  whereby  damage  was  sustained?
And  it  seems  to  me  that  it  will.  The  authorities  are  numerous  and
uniform,  that  an  action  will  lie  by  a  master  against  a  person  who

procures  that  a  servant  should  unlawfully  leave  his  service.  The
principle involved in these cases comprises the present; for, there, the
right  of  action  in  the  master  arises  from  the  wrongful  act  of  the
defendant  in  procuring  that  the  person  hired  should  break  his
contract, by putting an end to the relation of employer and employed;
and  the  present  case  is  the  same.  If  it  is  objected  that  this  class  of
actions  for  procuring  a  breach  of  contract  of  hiring  rests  upon  no
principle, and ought not to be extended beyond the cases heretofore
decided, and that, as those have related to contracts respecting trade,
manufactures  or  household  service,  and  not  to  performance  at  a
theatre,  therefore  they  are  no  authority  for  an  action  in  respect  of  a
contract for such performance; the answer appears to me to be, that
the  class  of  cases  referred  to  rests  upon  the  principle  that  the
procurement of the violation of the right is a cause of action, and that,
when  this  principle  is  applied  to  a  violation  of  a  right  arising  upon  a
contract  of  hiring,  the  nature  of  the  service  contracted  for  is
immaterial. It is clear that the procurement of the violation of a right
is  a  cause  of  action  in  all  instances  where  the  violation  is  an
actionable wrong, as in violations of a right to property, whether real
or  personal,  or  to  personal  security:  he  who  procures  the  wrong  is  a
joint  wrong-doer,  and  may  be  sued,  either  alone  or  jointly  with  the
agent, in the appropriate action for the wrong complained of.

This  principle  is  supported  by  good  reason.  He  who  maliciously
procures  a  damage  to  another  by  violation  of  his  right  ought  to  be
made  to  indemnify;  and  that,  whether  he  procures  an  actionable
wrong  or  a  breach  of  contract.  He  who  procures  the  non-delivery  of
goods according to contract may inflict an injury, the same as he who
procures  the  abstraction  of  goods  after  delivery;  and  both  ought  on
the  same  ground  to  be  made  responsible.  The  remedy  on  the
contract  may  be  inadequate,  as  where  the  measures  of  damages  is
restricted; or in the ease of non-payment of a debt where the damage
may  be  bankruptcy  to  the  creditor  who  is  disappointed,  but  the
measure  of  damages  against  the  debtor  is  interest  only;  or,  in  the

case of the non-delivery of the goods, the disappointment may lead to
a heavy forfeiture under a contract to complete a work within a time,
but the measure of damages against the vendor of the goods for non-
delivery  may  be  only  the  difference  between  the  contract  price  and
the market value of the goods in question at the time of the breach. In
such cases, he who procures the damage maliciously might justly be
made responsible beyond the liability of the contractor.

The  result  is  that  there  ought  to  be,  in  my  opinion,  judgment  for

the plaintiff.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Adoption of  Lumley Tort.  The  above  decision  in  Lumley  is  the
most  famous  decision  recognizing  a  tort  cause  of  action  for
intentionally interfering with the plaintiff’s contract with a third party.
The court recognized that the third party (the opera singer) might be
liable  for  breach  of  contract  but  that  the  actor  who  instigated  the
failure  to  perform  would  be  liable  in  tort  for  the  damages  caused
through  his  intentional  act  of  interference.  This  principle  for  liability,
while  novel  in  1853,  was  fully  embraced  by  both  English  and
American  courts  over  time.  While  some  of  the  judges  in  Lumley
premised their verdict upon the showing that the defendant had acted
maliciously, others believed this was not critical to proving the claim.
This dispute has been ongoing. Most courts traditionally identify the
elements of tortious interference with contract as follows:
A. The existence of a contract subject to interference;
B. A willful and intentional act of interference by the defendant;
C.  The  intentional  act  was  a  proximate  cause  of  the  plaintiff’s

damage; and

D. Actual damages or loss occurred.
One  continuing  bone  of  contention  has  been  whether  plaintiff
must prove a form of “malice” — which is often seen as the opposite

of  being  justiﬁed  in  one’s  action  by  legitimate  business  interests  or
rights. Many courts treat this issue as an afﬁrmative defense. Rather
than  having  the  plaintiff  bear  the  burden  of  proving  “malice,”  the
defendant  must  afﬁrmatively  plead  and  prove  that  it  was  justiﬁed  in
its  act  of  interference  in  order  to  defeat  the  claim  that  otherwise
satisﬁed the foregoing elements. There are still jurisdictions, however,
that  require  the  plaintiff  to  prove  malice  as  an  element  of  the  claim
justiﬁcation  or  privilege  for  the
(and
defendant’s act of interference).

in  effect,  to  negate  any

2. Factors Utilized in Assessing the Impropriety.  The  Restatement
(Second)  §766  (1965)  offers  the  following  list  of  factors  to  consider
(whether  as  an  element  of  the  plaintiff’s  claim  or  as  relevant  to  the
defendant’s afﬁrmative defense of “privilege”) in determining if the act
of interference warrants imposition of liability:

A. The nature of the actor’s conduct,
B. The actor’s motive,
C.  The  interests  of  the  other  with  which  the  actor’s  conduct

interferes,

D. The interests sought to be advanced by the actor,
E.  The  social  interests  in  protecting  the  freedom  of  action  of  the

actor and the contractual interests of the other,

F.  The  proximity  or  remoteness  of  the  actor’s  conduct  to  the

interference, and

G. The relations between the parties.
With respect to an intentional act of interfering with the plaintiff’s
existing  contract  with  a  third  party,  however,  courts  do  not  typically
consider the mere right of “competition” to be sufﬁcient justiﬁcation.
Utilizing these factors, how might you justify the decision by the court
in Lumley to hold the defendant liable to the plaintiff?

3. Billion Dollar Cause of Action.  One of the largest tort judgments
in  history  involved  this  cause  of  action.  Pennzoil  sued  Texaco  in
Texas state court for interfering with Pennzoil’s contractual relations

with  Getty  Oil  Co.  Getty  and  Pennzoil  had  agreed  to  Pennzoil’s
takeover  of  Getty  through  a  stock  acquisition.  Subsequently,  Texaco
offered (and Getty accepted) a deal to pay a higher dollar amount per
share  to  permit  Texaco  to  take  over  Getty  instead  of  Pennzoil.
Pennzoil sued Texaco and the jury returned a verdict for Pennzoil of
$7.53  billion  in  compensatory  damages  and  $3  billion  in  punitive
damages. On appeal the punitive damages were reduced to $1 billion
but the compensatory damages were left intact. The Texas Supreme
Court  refused  to  hear  any  further  appeals  and  Texaco  ﬁled  for
bankruptcy  while  seeking  further  appellate  review  from  the  U.S.
Supreme Court. While these matters were pending, the parties settled
the case for a total of $3 billion — a pretty good day at the ofﬁce for
any attorney with a contingency fee interest.

4. Triangular Relationships Required.  Courts have held that a mere
breach of contract does not give rise to a cause of action for tortious
interference  against  the  breaching  party.  In  other  words,  one  cannot
tortiously  interfere  with  one’s  own  contract.  A  third  party,  who  is  a
stranger  to  the  contract,  is  the  only  one  capable  of  committing  this
tort.  See  In  re  James  E.  Bashaw  &  Co.,  2009  Tex.  App.  LEXIS  5745
(Tex.  App. — Houston  [1st  Dist.]  2009,  no  pet.).  In  other  words,  you
need  a  triangular  relationship  to  have  this  tort.  Merely  failing  to
perform, or somehow interfering with the performance of a contract
to which the actor is a party, subjects that party only to a breach of
contract  claim  and  not  a  tort  claim.  See,  e.g.,  Applied  Equipment
Corp. v. Litton Saudi Arabia Ltd., 869 P.2d 454 (Cal. 1994).

5. Problem.  During the summer of 2010, there were news reports
that Marist College ﬁled a lawsuit against James Madison University
for  luring  its  men’s  basketball  coach  (Matt  Brady)  away  while  the
coach was in the middle of a multi-year deal (with no buyout clause).
Brady  spent  four  years  as  the  coach  at  Marist  before  accepting  the
offer from James Madison. In the suit, Marist alleged that the coach
was  induced  to  leave  with  three  years  remaining  on  his  current
contract. James Madison did not ﬁle a timely answer in the suit and a

“tortious

interference”  with

default  judgment  was  entered  by  New  York  State  Supreme  Court
Justice Charles D. Wood, who stated that James Madison University
the  contract  of
had  committed
employment  between  Marist  and  Brady.  A  subsequent  hearing  was
scheduled  to  determine  the  damages.  (The  school  also  sued  the
coach  for  breach  of  contract,  including  violating  a  provision  in  the
contract  stating  that  if  Brady  left,  he  would  not  solicit  any  current
Marist players to leave with him.) The coach ﬁled an answer denying
any  liability  for  breach  of  contract.  Did  James  Madison  University
have a viable defense to the claim for tortious interference?

Idaho J.I. 4.70: Tortious Interference with Contract

With  respect  to  the  plaintiff’s  claim  for  tortious  interference
with  contract,  the  plaintiff  has  the  burden  of  proving  each  of
the following propositions:

(1) The plaintiff was a party to an existing contract;
(2) The defendant knew of the contract;
(3)  The  defendant  intentionally  interfered  with  the

contract, causing a breach;

(4) The plaintiff was damaged as a proximate result of

the defendant’s interference; and

(5) The nature and extent of damages, and the amount

thereof.

C. Interference with Prospective Contractual

Relations

In  a  parallel  line  of  cases,  courts  have  also  recognized  a  tort  for
intentional
interference  with  a  merely  prospective  contractual
relationship.  While  the  preceding  case  speciﬁcally  rejected  the
concept  of  a  competition  privilege  when  an  actor  intentionally
interferes  with  an  existing  contractual  relationship,  courts  and
commentators  have  long  agreed  that  when  the  actor’s  conduct
merely  interferes  with  a  claimant’s  possible  contractual  relationship
with a third party, competition should not be prohibited. For example,
consider two competing manufacturers of soft drink products. When
one  advertises  that  its  product  is  better  than  the  other  in  order  to
attract customers to its own product and away from the other, do you
see  how  this  might  appear  to  be  an  intentional  act  of  interference
with  a  prospective  contractual  relationship?  In  such  a  scenario,
in  fact  ﬁnd  such  conduct  commendable  rather  than
courts
actionable:

“Iron sharpens iron” is ancient wisdom, and the law is in accord in
favoring  free  competition,  since  ordinarily  it  is  essential  to  the
general  welfare  of  society,  notwithstanding  [that]  competition  is
not  altruistic  but  is  fundamentally  the  play  of  interest  against
interest,  and  so  involves  the  interference  of  the  successful
competitor with the interest of his unsuccessful competitor in the
matter of their common rivalry. Competition is the state in which
men  live  and  is  not  a  tort,  unless  the  nature  of  the  method
employed  is  not  justiﬁed  by  public  policy,  and  so  supplies  the
condition to constitute a legal wrong. Accordingly, we have made
clear  in  our  cases  that  acting  to  pursue  one’s  own  business
interests at the expense of others is not, in itself, tortious.

Goldman  v.  Building  Ass’n,  133  A.  843,  846  (Md.  1926).  Thus,  while
expressly embracing competition as a generally acceptable privilege,
courts have also embraced the concept that there should be limits to
this privilege and that sometimes the act of interference is actionable.

The ﬁrst and second Restatements have struggled to provide a bright
line articulating when the act of interference is privileged and when it
is not justiﬁed “by public policy” and, therefore, provides grounds for
legal redress. The following opinion provides historical perspective on
the related tort claims of interference with an existing contract versus
interference  with  a  mere  prospective  contact.  It  also  offers  an
arguably  brighter  line  for  determining  when  competition  is  justiﬁed
and when it is not.

liability — what  conduct

Texas, like most states, has long recognized a tort cause of action
for  interference  with  a  prospective  contractual  or  business  relation
even  though  the  core  concept  of
is
prohibited — has  never  been  clearly  deﬁned.  Texas  courts  have
variously  stated  that  a  defendant  may  be  liable  for  conduct  that  is
“wrongful,”  “malicious,”  “improper,”  of  “no  useful  purpose,”  “below  the
behavior of fair men similarly situated,” or done “with the purpose of
harming  the  plaintiff,”  but  not  for  conduct  that  is  “competitive,”
“privileged,”  or  “justiﬁed,”  even  if  intended  to  harm  the  plaintiff.
Repetition of these abstractions in the case law has not imbued them
with  content  or  made  them  more  useful,  and  tensions  among  them,
which exist not only in Texas law but American law generally, have for
decades been the subject of considerable critical commentary.

This case affords us the opportunity to bring a measure of clarity
to  this  body  of  law.  From  the  history  of  the  tort  in  Texas  and
elsewhere,  and  from  the  scholarly  efforts  to  analyze  its  boundaries,
interference  with  a
we  conclude  that  to  establish
prospective  contractual  or  business  relation  the  plaintiff  must  prove
that  it  was  harmed  by  the  defendant’s  conduct  that  was  either

liability  for

toward

the  customer — assault — was

independently  tortious  or  unlawful.  By  “independently  tortious”  we
mean conduct that would violate some other recognized tort duty. We
must  explain  this  at  greater  length,  but  by  way  of  example,  a
defendant  who  threatened  a  customer  with  bodily  harm  if  he  did
business with the plaintiff would be liable for interference because his
independently
conduct
tortious, while a defendant who competed legally for the customer’s
business would not be liable for interference. Thus deﬁned, an action
for  interference  with  a  prospective  contractual  or  business  relation
provides a remedy for injurious conduct that other tort actions might
not  reach  (in  the  example  above,  the  plaintiff  could  not  sue  for
assault),  but  only  for  conduct  that  is  already  recognized  to  be
wrongful under the common law or by statute.
in

this  case  was  not
independently  tortious  or  unlawful,  and  because  the  defendant  did
not  breach  its  contract,  we  reverse  the  court  of  appeals’  judgment
and render judgment for the defendant.

Because

I

Plaintiff Harry W. Sturges, III contracted for himself and plaintiffs Dick
Ford,  Bruce  Whitehead,  and  J.D.  Martin,  III  to  purchase  from  Bank
One,  Texas  a  vacant  parcel  of  commercial  property  in  Nederland,
Texas, referred to as Tract 2. The contract, dated December 29, 1989,
gave purchasers the right to terminate if within sixty days they were
unable  to  lease  the  property  and  “to  secure  the  written  approval  of
in
Wal-Mart  Corporation  to  the
accordance  with  the  right  so  given  to  Wal-Mart  pursuant  to  certain
restrictions  on  the  Property.”  The  right  referred  to  was  the  right  to
approve  modiﬁcations  in  a  site  plan  for  the  property  that  Wal-Mart
Stores,  Inc.  and  Wal-Mart  Properties,  Inc.  (collectively,  “Wal-Mart”)
held under two recorded instruments, each entitled “Easements with
Covenants and Restrictions Affecting Land” (“ECRs”), one ﬁled in 1982

intended  use  of  the  Property,

and  the  other  in  1988.  The  purpose  of  the  ECRs  was  to  assure  the
commercial  development  of  Tract  2  and  an  adjacent  tract,  Tract  1,
according to a prescribed plan.

The 1982 ECR was between Wal-Mart, which owned Tract 2 at the
time,  and  the  State  Teachers  Retirement  System  of  Ohio  (“OTR”),
which owned Tract 1, having acquired it from Wal-Mart under a sale
and leaseback agreement. OTR leased Tract 1 to Wal-Mart to use for
a store. In 1984, Wal-Mart sold Tract 2 to a joint venture that included
a partnership, Gulf Coast Investment Group. Gulf Coast later acquired
Tract  2  from  the  joint  venture.  The  1988  ECR,  made  by  Gulf  Coast,
OTR, and Wal-Mart, modiﬁed the site plan for the tracts and otherwise
incorporated the terms of the 1982 ECR.

Gulf  Coast’s  efforts  to  develop  Tract  2  failed,  and  in  1989  Bank
One  acquired  the  property  by  foreclosure.  Two  of  Gulf  Coast’s
partners,  plaintiffs  Whitehead  and  Martin,  along  with  two  other
investors, plaintiffs Sturges and Ford, continued to look for a way to
develop  the  property.  When  Sturges  learned  that  Fleming  Foods  of
Texas,  Inc.  was  interested  in  building  a  food  store  in  the  area,  he
contracted  with  Bank  One  to  purchase  Tract  2  for  the  plaintiffs  in
hopes of leasing the property to Fleming Foods.

As soon as the agreement with Bank One was executed, Sturges
contacted Wal-Mart to request a modiﬁcation of the 1982/1988 ECRs
to  permit  construction  on  Tract  2  of  a  food  store  to  Fleming’s
speciﬁcations. A modiﬁcation was necessary in part because Fleming
wanted  to  construct  a  51,000-square-foot  store,  and  the  site  plan
permitted  only  a  36,000-square-foot  structure.  A  manager  in  Wal-
Mart’s property management department, DeLee Wood, told Sturges
to submit a revised site plan, and though she did not have authority to
approve  the  modiﬁcation  herself,  she  indicated  to  Sturges  that  Wal-
Mart  would  approve  it.  About  the  same  time,  Sturges  obtained  from
Fleming  a  non-binding  memorandum  of  understanding  that  it  would
lease Tract 2.

Unbeknownst

to  Wood,  a  manager

in  another  Wal-Mart
department, Sandra Watson, had been evaluating the possibilities for
expanding stores at various locations, including the Nederland store.
If  a  store  could  not  be  expanded,  Watson’s  assignment  was  to
consider  relocating  the  store.  In  July  1989  Watson  hired  a  realtor,
Tom  Hudson,  to  help  Wal-Mart  acquire  Tract  2  for  purposes  of
expansion.  When  Hudson  learned  of  Sturges’s  contract  with  Bank
One,  he  suggested  to  Watson  that  Wal-Mart  could  thwart  Sturges’s
efforts to purchase the property by refusing to approve the requested
modiﬁcation of the 1982/1988 ECRs. At the time, neither Watson nor
Hudson knew of Wood’s conversations with Sturges.

When  Wood’s  and  Watson’s  conflicting  activities  came  to  the
the  head  of  Wal-Mart’s  property  management
attention  of
department, Tony Fuller, he agreed with Watson that Wal-Mart should
try  to  acquire  Tract  2  and  told  Wood  to  deny  Sturges’s  request  to
modify  the  ECR,  which  she  did  in  a  letter  to  Sturges  without
explanation.  Fuller  then  instructed  Hudson  to  contact  Fleming  and
communicate  Wal-Mart’s  desire  to  expand  onto  Tract  2.  Hudson
complied,  telling  L.  G.  Callaway,  Fleming’s  manager  of  store
development who had been working on the deal with Sturges, that if
Wal-Mart could not acquire Tract 2, it would close its store on Tract 1
and  relocate.  Since  Fleming  was  not  interested  in  Tract  2  without  a
Wal-Mart  store  next  door,  Callaway  took  Hudson’s  call  to  be  an
ultimatum not to move forward on the proposed lease with Sturges.
Consequently, Fleming canceled its letter of intent with Sturges, and
the  plaintiffs  opted  out  of  their  contract  with  Bank  One.  Several
months later, Wal-Mart purchased Tract 2 and expanded its store.

The  plaintiffs  sued  Wal-Mart  for  tortiously  interfering  with  their
prospective  lease  with  Fleming  and  for  breaching  the  1982/1988
ECRs  by  unreasonably  refusing  to  approve  the  requested  site  plan
modiﬁcation.  The  plaintiffs’  actual  damages  claim  under  both
theories  was  the  same — the  proﬁts  the  plaintiffs  would  have  made
on the Fleming lease. The jury found Wal-Mart liable on both theories.

Concerning  the  plaintiffs’

as follows:

interfere  with  Plaintiffs’  prospective  contractual

Wrongful interference occurred if (a) there was a reasonable probability that
Plaintiffs  would  have  entered  into  the  contractual  relation,  and  (b)  Wal-Mart
intentionally prevented the contractual relation from occurring with the purpose
of harming Plaintiffs.

Was  Wal-Mart’s  intentional  interference  with  Plaintiffs’  prospective  lease

agreement with Fleming justiﬁed?
An  interference  is  “justiﬁed”  if  a  party  possesses  an  interest  in  the  subject
matter equal or superior to that of the other party, or if it results from the good
faith exercise of a party’s rights, or the good faith exercise of a party’s mistaken
belief of its rights.

The jury answered “yes” to the ﬁrst question and “no” to the second.
Wal-Mart  offered  no  objection  to  this  part  of  the  jury  charge  that  is
relevant  to  our  consideration  of  the  case.  The  jury  assessed  $1
million actual damages on the contract claim and on the interference
claim,  assessed  $500,000  punitive  damages  on  the  interference
claim,  and  found  that  reasonable  attorney  fees  for  each  side  were
$145,000. At the plaintiffs’ election, the trial court rendered judgment
on the interference claim, awarding actual and punitive damages but
not attorney fees.

All  parties  appealed.  The  court  of  appeals  afﬁrmed  the  award  of
actual  damages  but  remanded  for  a  retrial  of  punitive  damages,
holding that the trial court had improperly excluded evidence offered
by the plaintiffs during the punitive damages phase of the trial.

II

Wal-Mart argues that there is no evidence to support the jury’s verdict
that it wrongfully interfered with the plaintiffs’ prospective lease with
Fleming or that it was not justiﬁed in acting as it did. Our analysis of

these arguments is complicated because it must be made in light of
the  jury  charge  that  the  district  court  gave  without  objection,  even
though,  as  we  conclude,  the  charge’s  statement  of  the  law  was  not
entirely correct. We will focus on Wal-Mart’s argument that there is no
evidence of wrongful interference: that is, in the language of the jury
charge,  no  evidence  that  Wal-Mart  acted  “with  the  purpose  of
harming  Plaintiffs.”  To  resolve  this  issue,  we  must  understand  what

advantage, as Wal-Mart and Sturges did over the acquisition of Tract
2,  one’s  success  over  the  other  can  almost  always  be  said  to  harm
the other. Wal-Mart’s evidentiary challenge here raises the question of
what  harm  must  be  proved  to  constitute  tortious  interference.  To
answer  this  question,  we  look  to  the  historical  development  of  the
interference torts in other jurisdictions and in Texas and survey every

The  origins  of  civil  liability  for  interference  have  been  traced  to
Roman  law  that  permitted  a  man  to  sue  for  violence  done  to
members  of  his  household.  The  common  law  also  recognized  such
liability as early as the fourteenth century and extended it to include
driving  away  a  business’s  customers  or  a  church’s  donors.  But  a
common-law  cause  of  action  was  strictly  limited  to  cases  in  which
actual  violence  or  other  such  improper  means  were  used.  For
centuries  the  common  law  continued  to  allow  civil  actions  for
interference  with  one’s  customers  or  other  prospective  business
relationships, but as the Restatement (Second) of Torts summarizes,
“in  all  of  them  the  actor’s  conduct  was  characterized  by  violence,
fraud or defamation, and was tortious in character.”

The  common  law  departed  from  this  requirement  in  1853  in  the
English  case  of  Lumley  v.  Gye,  which  held  that  liability  could  be
imposed  for  interference  with  a  contract  if  the  defendant  acted
“wrongfully and maliciously,” even if the defendant’s conduct was not

tortious or illegal. In that case, Gye induced an opera singer to sing for
him instead of Lumley, for whom she had contracted to perform, not
with  threats  of  violence  but  by  offering  her  a  higher  fee.  Forty  years
later in Temperton v. Russell, the English court reafﬁrmed its decision
in  Lumley,  holding  that  trade  union  ofﬁcials  could  be  liable  to  a
building  materials  supplier  for  threatening  his  customers  with  labor
disturbances  if  they  continued  to  purchase  supplies  from  him.  The
court  announced  that  the  rule  in  Lumley  would  apply  not  only  to
interference with all contracts, regardless of the subject matter, but to
interference with prospective or potential relations as well.

Temperton’s  treatment  of  interference  with  prospective  relations
as simply another aspect of interference with contract was a mistake.
It  is  one  thing  for  A  and  B  to  compete  for  C’s  business,  and  quite
another  for  A  to  persuade  or  force  C  to  break  his  contract  with  B.
Tortious  interference  with  contract  contemplates  that  competition
may be lawful and yet limited by promises already made. Absent any
such promises, competitors should be free to use any lawful means
to obtain advantage. As one commentator has observed:

Although one who interferes with the stability of a contractual relationship may
be  seen  as  an  interloper  and  possibly  a  tortfeasor,  one  who  interferes  merely
with a “prospective business advantage” may be essentially a competitor. In an
economic system founded upon the principle of free competition, competitors
should not be liable in tort for seeking a legitimate business advantage.

Lumley’s  holding  that  unlawful  conduct  was  not  a  prerequisite  for
liability  for  tortious  interference  with  contract  was  understandable;
Temperton’s  extension  of  the  same  rule  to  situations  involving  only
prospective relations was not.

The  use  of  “malice”  to  denote  the  touchstone  of  liability  for
tortious  interference  with  contract  was  not  well  explained  in  Lumley
and  the  cases  that  followed.  “Malice”  appeared  at  ﬁrst  to  signify
malevolence,  although  it  soon  became  apparent  that  that  deﬁnition
would  not  work.  As  we  have  explained  in  a  similar  context,  lawful

conduct  is  not  made  tortious  by  the  actor’s  ill  will  towards  another,
nor does an actor’s lack of ill will make his tortious conduct any less
so. “Malice” obviously meant that character of conduct that would not
justify  inducing  a  breach  of  contract,  but  that  was  an  obviously
circular  deﬁnition  (a  person  is  not  justiﬁed  in  inducing  a  breach  of
contract if he acts with malice, that is, if he acts in such a way that
does not justify inducing a breach of contract). Exactly what conduct
was culpable, and therefore “malicious,” went undeﬁned.

As  clumsy  as  the  idea  of  “malice”  was  in  describing  liability  for
tortious interference with contract, it made no sense at all in trying to
describe liability for tortious interference with prospective advantage.
Competitors could quite naturally be expected, well within the bounds
of  law,  to  try  to  achieve  the  best  for  themselves  and,  consequently,
harm  to  each  other.  In  a  society  built  around  business  competition,
interference  with  prospective  business  relations  has  never  been
thought to be wrongful in and of itself. That some liability factor was
essential  has  never  been  in  doubt.  If  that  factor  was  not  unlawful
conduct, discarded by Lumley for tortious interference with contract,
then it was not clear what it should be.

These  two  problems — the  misassociation  of  the  two  torts  and
the  confusion  regarding  their  standards  of  liability — may  have  been
due  to,  and  were  certainly  exacerbated  by,  the  concept  of  a  prima
facie tort that was being advanced about the same time. As explained
by  Justice  Holmes:  “It  has  been  considered  that,  prima  facie,  the
intentional infliction of temporal damages is a cause of action, which,
as a matter of substantive law, whatever may be the form of pleading,
requires a justiﬁcation if the defendant is to escape.” In other words,
intentionally  inflicting  harm  is  tortious  unless  justiﬁed.  Consistent
with this idea, and with the association of the two interference torts,
the 1939 Restatement of Torts deﬁned tortious interference as simply
this:

One who, without a privilege to do so, induces or otherwise purposely causes a
third  person  not  to  (a)  perform  a  contract  with  another,  or  (b)  enter  into  or
continue  a  business  relation  with  another  is  liable  to  the  other  for  the  harm
caused thereby.

In determining the existence of a privilege, the Restatement called for
consideration of:

(a)  the  nature  of  the  actor’s  conduct,  (b)  the  nature  of  the  expectancy  with
which  his  conduct  interferes,  (c)  the  relations  between  the  parties,  (d)  the
interest  sought  to  be  advanced  by  the  actor  and  (e)  the  social  interests  in
protecting the expectancy on the one hand and the actor’s freedom of action on
the other hand.

The  Restatement  also  stated  a  privilege  for  competition  when,
among  other  things,  “the  actor  does  not  employ  improper  means.”
The Restatement’s broad statements did almost nothing to deﬁne the
parameters  of  tortious  conduct.  What  was  it  about  the  nature  of  an
actor’s conduct, or of the expectancy at issue, or of any of the other
considerations  that  should  or  should  not  result  in  liability  in  speciﬁc
circumstances?  Were  the  considerations  the  same  for  interference
with a contract and interference with a prospective business relation?
When  were  means  of  competition  “improper”?  The  Restatement’s
provisions  gave  no  more  guidance  than  the  concept  of  prima  facie
tort.  Not  surprisingly,  when  the  second  Restatement  was  published
forty years later, it commented:

There  is  no  clear  cut  distinction  between  the  requirements  for  a  prima  facie
case  and  the  requirements  for  a  recognized  privilege.  Initial  liability  depends
upon  the  interplay  of  several  factors  and  is  not  reducible  to  a  single  rule;  and
privileges,  too,  are  not  clearly  established  but  depend  upon  a  consideration  of
much the same factors. Moreover, there is considerable disagreement on who
has  the  burden  of  pleading  and  proving  certain  matters,  such  for  example,  as
the existence and effect of competition for prospective business.

This  has  occurred  for  two  reasons.  First,  the  law  in  this  area  has  not  fully
congealed  but  is  still  in  a  formative  stage.  The  several  forms  of  the
[interference] tort . . . are often not distinguished by the courts, and cases have

been  cited  among  them  somewhat  indiscriminately.  This  has  produced  a
blurring of the signiﬁcance of the factors involved in determining liability.

The  second  reason  grows  out  of  use  of  the  term  “malicious”  in  [Lumley  v.
Gye] and other early cases. It soon came to be realized that the term was not
being  used  in  a  literal  sense,  requiring  ill  will  toward  the  plaintiff  as  a
requirement for imposing liability. Many courts came to call this “legal malice,”
and to hold that in this sense the requirement means that the infliction of the
harm must be intentional and “without justiﬁcation.” “Justiﬁcation” is a broader
and  looser  term  than  “privilege,”  and  the  consequence  has  been  that  its
meaning has not been very clear.

Having  recognized  these  problems,  the  Restatement  did  little  to
solve them. Concluding that “it has seemed desirable to make use of
a  single  word  that  will  indicate  for  this  tort  the  balancing  process
justiﬁed,’”  the
expressed  by  the  two  terms,
Restatement chose “improper” as a word “neutral enough to acquire a
specialized  meaning  of
its  own”  for  purposes  of  deﬁning  the
interference  torts.  The  Restatement  separated  interference  with
contract  and
interference  with  prospective  business  relations,
previously  combined  as  one,  but  it  used  the  same  new  standard
— “improper” — to deﬁne liability for each.

‘culpable  and  not

Thus,  the  second  Restatement  abandoned  the  confusing  and
overlapping  notions  of  “malice,”  “privilege,”  and  “justiﬁcation,”  but  it
made
little  more  than  a  formal  distinction  between  the  two
interference torts, setting the liability standard for both at “improper”
conduct,  and  it  continued  the  idea  that  the  considerations  for
determining  what  was  improper  were,  except  for  lawful  competition,
similar  for  both  torts.  Commentators  since  have  criticized  the
Restatement as overstating case law. Professor Perlman’s analysis of
the  cases  suggests  that  the  interference  tort  [with  prospective
relations] should be limited to cases in which the defendant’s acts are
independently unlawful and that if improper motivation is to give rise
to  liability,  it  should  be  based  only  on  objective  indicia  of  activity
producing  social  loss.  In  most  cases,  tort  law  will  provide  the
standard  for  judging  the  unlawfulness  of  the  means.  At  the  same

time,  those  courts  that  have  emphasized  unlawful  means  have
recognized  that  sources  other  than  traditional  tort  law  also  might
deﬁne  the  lawfulness  of  the  defendant’s  behavior.  Incorporation  of
such sources seems right.

Likewise, Professor Keeton summarized:

intimidation,  defamation,

Violence  or
injurious  falsehood  or  other  fraud,
violation of the criminal law, and the institution or threat of groundless civil suits
or criminal prosecutions in bad faith, all have been held to result in liability, and
there is some authority which limits liability to such cases.

Two  recent  cases  of  note  have  echoed  the  same  idea  after
surveying  existing  case  law.  In  Della  Penna  v.  Toyota  Motor  Sales,
Inc.,  a  car  manufacturer  required  dealers  not  to  sell  its  vehicles  for
resale  outside  the  United  States  in  order  to  protect  its  dealership
network. An exporter sued the manufacturer for tortious interference
with  his  business  prospects.  The  Supreme  Court  of  California
law,  concluding  that  the
rejected  the  claim  as  a  matter  of
manufacturer’s  conduct  was  not  actionable.  Abandoning  notions  of
“malice”  and  “justiﬁcation,”  the  court  held  that  a  plaintiff  seeking  to
recover  for  an  alleged  interference  with  prospective  contractual  or
economic relations must plead and prove as part of its case-in-chief
that  the  defendant  not  only  knowingly  interfered  with  the  plaintiff’s
expectancy, but engaged in conduct that was wrongful by some legal
measure other than the fact of interference itself.

The “legal measures” identiﬁed by the court were existing tort law

and statutes.

Similarly,  in  Speakers  of  Sport,  Inc.  v.  Proserv,  Inc.,  the  Seventh
Circuit  concluded  that  under  Illinois  law,  actionable  interference
requires  conduct  that  is  independently  tortious  by  nature.  In  that
case,  one  sports  agency  sued  another  for  interference  in  obtaining
Texas Rangers’ catcher Ivan Rodriguez as a client by promising him
more  than  it  could  deliver.  The  plaintiff  agency  sought  damages
alleging  that  the  defendant  agency’s  conduct  was  unfair,  unethical,

and  deceitful.  The  court  rejected  the  argument  that  actionable
interference  could  be  based  on  conduct  that  was  not  independently
tortious  or  otherwise  unlawful.  As  Judge  Posner  explained  in  the
court’s  opinion,  no  other  workable  basis  exists  for  distinguishing
between tortious interference and lawful competition:

It  can  be  argued  .  .  .  that  competition  can  be  tortious  even  if  it
does  not  involve  an  actionable  fraud  .  .  .  or  other  independently
trademark  or  patent
tortious  act,  such  as  defamation,  or
infringement, or a theft of a trade secret; that competitors should not
be  allowed  to  use  “unfair”  tactics;  and  that  a  promise  known  by  the
promisor  when  made  to  be  unfulﬁllable  is  such  a  tactic,  especially
when  used  on  a  relatively  unsophisticated,  albeit  very  well  to  do,
baseball  player.  Considerable  support  for  this  view  can  be  found  in
the  case  law.  But  the  Illinois  courts  have  not  as  yet  embraced  the
doctrine, and we are not alone in thinking it pernicious. Della Penna v.
Toyota  Motor  Sales,  U.S.A.,  Inc.,  902  P.2d  740,  760-763  (Cal.  1995)
(concurring opinion). We agree with Professor Perlman that the tort of
interference with business relationships should be conﬁned to cases
in  which  the  defendant  employed  unlawful  means  to  stiff  a
competitor,  and  we  are  reassured  by  the  conclusion  of  his  careful
analysis that the case law is generally consistent with this position as
a matter of outcomes as distinct from articulation.

Expressly  endorsing  the

legal  commentary  critical  of  the
development  of  the  law  of  tortious  interference,  Della  Penna  and
Speakers  of  Sport  demonstrate  the
importance  of  decoupling
interference  with  prospective
interference  with  contract  from
relations,  and  of  grounding  liability  for  the  latter  in  conduct  that  is
independently tortious by nature or otherwise unlawful.

We  therefore  hold  that  to  recover  for  tortious  interference  with  a
prospective  business  relation  a  plaintiff  must  prove  that  the
defendant’s  conduct  was  independently  tortious  or  wrongful.  By
independently tortious we do not mean that the plaintiff must be able
to prove an independent tort. Rather, we mean only that the plaintiff

must prove that the defendant’s conduct would be actionable under a
recognized tort. Thus, for example, a plaintiff may recover for tortious
interference  from  a  defendant  who  makes  fraudulent  statements
about  the  plaintiff  to  a  third  person  without  proving  that  the  third
person was actually defrauded. If, on the other hand, the defendant’s
statements are not intended to deceive, as in Speakers of Sport, then
they are not actionable. Likewise, a plaintiff may recover for tortious
interference from a defendant who threatens a person with physical
harm  if  he  does  business  with  the  plaintiff.  The  plaintiff  need  prove
only  that  the  defendant’s  conduct  toward  the  prospective  customer
would  constitute  assault.  Also,  a  plaintiff  could  recover  for  tortious
interference  by  showing  an  illegal  boycott,  although  a  plaintiff  could
not  recover  against  a  defendant  whose  persuasion  of  others  not  to
deal  with  the  plaintiff  was  lawful.  Conduct  that  is  merely  “sharp”  or
unfair  is  not  actionable  and  cannot  be  the  basis  for  an  action  for
tortious interference with prospective relations, and we disapprove of
cases that suggest the contrary. These examples are not exhaustive,
but  they  illustrate  what  conduct  can  constitute  tortious  interference
with prospective relations.

The  concepts  of  justiﬁcation  and  privilege  are  subsumed  in  the
plaintiff’s  proof,  except  insofar  as  they  may  be  defenses  to  the
wrongfulness of the alleged conduct. For example, a statement made
against  the  plaintiff,  though  defamatory,  may  be  protected  by  a
complete  or  qualiﬁed  privilege.  Justiﬁcation  and  privilege  are
defenses
interference  with  prospective
relations only to the extent that they are defenses to the independent
tortiousness of the defendant’s conduct. Otherwise, the plaintiff need
not prove that the defendant’s conduct was not justiﬁed or privileged,
nor can a defendant assert such defenses.

in  a  claim  for  tortious

In  reaching  this  conclusion  we  treat  tortious  interference  with
prospective  business  relations  differently  than  tortious  interference
with  contract.  It  makes  sense  to  require  a  defendant  who  induces  a
breach  of  contract  to  show  some  justiﬁcation  or  privilege  for

depriving  another  of  beneﬁts  to  which  the  agreement  entitled  him.
But when two parties are competing for interests to which neither is
entitled, then neither can be said to be more justiﬁed or privileged in
his pursuit. If the conduct of each is lawful, neither should be heard to
complain  that  mere  unfairness
is  actionable.  Justiﬁcation  and
privilege  are  not  useful  concepts  in  assessing  interference  with
prospective  relations,  as  they  are  in  assessing  interference  with  an
existing contract.

III

With  this  understanding  of  what  conduct  is  prohibited  by  the  tort  of
interference  with  prospective  contractual  or  business  relations  and
what conduct is not prohibited, we return to the evidence of this case.
As we have already noted, we must assess Wal-Mart’s argument that
no  evidence  supports  a  ﬁnding  of  wrongful  interference  with  the
plaintiffs’  prospective  agreement  with  Fleming  Foods  in  light  of  the
jury charge to which Wal-Mart did not object, even though the charge
does not correctly state the law. We must therefore consider whether
the plaintiffs offered any evidence from which the jury could ﬁnd, as
the trial court instructed them, that Wal-Mart acted “with the purpose
of harming Plaintiffs.” As we have shown, however, harm that results
only from lawful competition is not compensable by the interference
tort.  We  must  look  to  see  whether  there  is  evidence  of  harm  from
some independently tortious or unlawful activity by Wal-Mart.

The  plaintiffs  tell  us  that  their  interference  claim  is  based  on  the
telephone  conversation  between  Hudson,  Wal-Mart’s  relator,  and
Callaway,  Fleming’s  manager  of  store  development.  Speciﬁcally,  the
plaintiffs  complain  of  Hudson’s  “ultimatum”  to  Callaway  that  if  Wal-
Mart were not able to acquire Tract 2 for expansion, it would relocate
its  store.  The  plaintiffs  contend  that  Hudson’s  statement  was  false
and  therefore  fraudulent.  To  be  fraudulent  a  statement  must  be
material and false, the speaker must have known it was false or acted

recklessly  without  regard  to  its  falsity,  the  speaker  must  have
intended that the statement be acted on, and hearer must have relied
on  it.  The  plaintiffs  do  not  dispute  that  Wal-Mart  had  undertaken  to
identify  stores  which  could  not  be  expanded  and  to  relocate  them,
that it attempted to acquire Tract 2 as an alternative to relocating the
Nederland store, and that as Hudson told Callaway, if Wal-Mart could
not acquire Tract 2 it would relocate. The only evidence the plaintiffs
cite  in  support  of  their  contention  is  that  at  the  time  Hudson  called
Callaway  Wal-Mart  had  not  begun  efforts  to  relocate;  that  as  a
general matter Wal-Mart preferred to expand rather than relocate; and
that there was room on Tract 1 for some expansion of the store. The
fact that Wal-Mart had not begun to relocate its store when Hudson
talked with Callaway is no evidence that his statement was false. The
plaintiffs point to no evidence that Wal-Mart’s general preference for
expansion over relocation, or the possibilities for some expansion on
Tract 1, would have made it decide not to relocate. Indeed, if Tract 1
had  been  adequate  for  Wal-Mart’s  intended  expansion,  it  would  not
have needed to acquire Tract 2.

Thus,  no  evidence  supports  the  plaintiffs’  contention  that
Hudson’s  statement  to  Callaway  was  fraudulent  or  that  Hudson
intended  to  deceive  Callaway,  and  the  plaintiffs  do  not  contend  that
Wal-Mart’s  conduct  was  otherwise  illegal  or  tortious.  The  record
contains no evidence to indicate that Wal-Mart intended the plaintiffs
any  harm  other  than  what  they  would  necessarily  suffer  by  Wal-
Mart’s  successful  acquisition  of  Tract  2,  which  they  were  both
pursuing, by entirely lawful means. We therefore conclude that there
is  no  evidence  to  support  a  judgment  for  the  plaintiffs  on  their
interference claim.

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1.  Decoupling  the  Two  Interference  Torts.   The  above  court
“decouples”  these  two  related  tort  claims  in  the  opinion,  indicating
that  the  concept  of  “justiﬁcation”  makes  sense  for  a  defendant  to
attempt  to  explain  its  intentional  interference  with  an  existing
contractual relationship, but that no such burden should be placed on
interfered  with  a  prospective
a  defendant  who  has  merely
relationship.  In  the  latter  case,  to  recover,  the  plaintiff  must  also
demonstrate  that  the  means  employed  by  the  defendant  involved
conduct  that  was  independently  unlawful  or  tortious — in  other
words, one must ﬁnd a tort within the tort.

2. Breach  of  Contract  as  Wrongful  Conduct.   In  another  portion  of
the  opinion,  the  Wal-Mart  court  also  ﬁnds  (as  a  matter  of  contract
interpretation)  that  the  defendant  had  not  committed  any  breach  of
contract  through  the  alleged  “unreasonable”  failure  to  agree  to  the
modiﬁcation of the easements and covenants. Interestingly, the court
only  appeared  to  reach  this  issue  for  the  purpose  of  evaluating  the
jury’s  ﬁnding  of  a  cause  of  action  for  contract  breach,  rather  than
suggesting  that  an  intentional  act  of  interference  involving  the
defendant’s  own  breach  of  a  separate  contract  might  be  sufﬁcient
evidence  of  “wrongful”  conduct.  This  is  consistent  with  the  holdings
of  some  other  courts — the  fact  that  the  defendant  breached  a
contract  with  a  third  party  in  the  course  of  interfering  with  the
plaintiff’s  prospective
the
interference  tortious.  Breach  of  a  contract  is  not  illegal,  improper,
wrongful, or unjustiﬁed under the law of tort, but instead simply gives
rise to a claim for breach of contract. See Windsor Securities, Inc. v.
Hartford Life Ins. Co., 986 F.2d 655, 664 (3d Cir. 1993).

relationship  does  not

itself  make

3. At-Will Employment Relationships.  Most courts treat contracts
terminable  at  will  as  the  equivalent  of  a  prospective  contractual
relationship  because  there  is  no  assurance  the  relationship  would
continue. Given the Wal-Mart court’s distinction between the torts of
interference  with  an  existing  contract  versus  interference  with  a
prospective  contract,  do  you  understand  why  characterizing  the  at-

will  relationship  in  this  manner  is  so  important?  Consider  this
scenario.  Competitor  calls  at-will  Employee  and  recruits  her  to  quit
her  job  with  Employer  and  go  to  work  for  Competitor.  Analyze  the
liability of Competitor toward Employer depending upon whether the
employment relationship is considered an existing contract or merely
a prospective contractual relationship.

4. Privilege to Compete.  Under the Restatement (Second), there is
a separately recognized “competition” privilege, which can be used by
a  defendant  to  justify  interference  with  a  prospective  contractual
relationship. This privilege is set forth, in part, below:

One  who  intentionally  caused  a  third  person  not  to  enter  into  a
prospective  contractual  relation  with  another  who
is  his
competitor or not to continue an existing contract terminable at
will does not interfere improperly with the other’s relation if

A.  the  relation  concerns  a  matter

B. the actor does not employ wrongful means and
C.  his  action  does  not  create  or  continue  an  unlawful

restraint of trade and

D. his purpose is at least in part to advance his interest in

competing with the other.

Restatement  (Second)  §768  (1965).  Note  that  this  privilege  to
compete is expressly limited to interference with prospective and not
existing  contractual  relations.  The  Wal-Mart  court  found  this
articulation of a privilege unwieldy in terms of differentiating between
acceptable  and  unacceptable  conduct.  Many  courts  still  analyze
interference  with  prospective  contractual  relations,  however,  utilizing
this  foregoing  Restatement  (Second)’s  list  of  factors.  In  adhering  to
this Restatement test some courts have focused more upon a ﬁnding
of  an  improper  motive,  and  others  upon  whether  the  defendant
utilized  improper  means  in  the  act  of  interference.  The  Restatement

itself  does  not  say  which  of  the  multiple  factors  is  most  important,
much less how a court should go about considering these factors. To
that  extent,  the  Restatement  is  less  of  a  test  and  more  of  a  list  of
variables.  By  contrast,  the  modern  trend  illustrated  by  the  Wal-Mart
case  narrows  the  analysis  considerably  and  likely  creates  an  actual
test that can be more predictive of outcomes. Which analysis do you
ﬁnd more helpful — the Restatement (Second)’s list of factors, or the
Wal-Mart court’s limitation of the tort to acts of interference involving
conduct independently recognized as tortious or wrongful?

5.  Problem.   Plaintiff  is  a  company  maintaining  a  retail  sales
website  offering  discounted  prices  on  many  products.  Plaintiff  pays
considerable  sums  to  advertise  its  website.  Defendant  also  sells
identical  products  on  its  own  website.  Defendant  promotes  its
products not through independent television advertisements (like the
plaintiff),  but  instead  by  utilizing  “pop-up”  ads  that  appear  on  the
plaintiff’s  website.  If  a  consumer  clicks  on  the  pop-up  ad,  the
consumer  is  directed  away  from  the  plaintiff’s  website  and  to  the
defendant’s competing website. Should the defendant be liable to the
plaintiff  for  interfering  with  potential  sales  to  those  customers  who
click  on  the  pop-up  ad?  See  Overstock.com  v.  SmartBargains,  Inc.,
192 P.3d 858 (Utah 2008).

V  DISTINGUISHING TORT VS. CONTRACT CLAIMS

In several instances in this chapter we have briefly discussed how a
business  tort  cause  of  action  might  be  preferable  to  a  breach  of
contract  action  for  the  aggrieved  claimant.  Plaintiff  lawyers  have
recognized  this  as  well  and  have
increasingly  become  more
aggressive  in  attempting  to  plead  tort  claims  rather  than,  or  in
addition  to,  their  contract  causes  of  action.  At  some  level,  for
example,  you  might  argue  that  many  broken  promises  stem  from  a
lack of care taken by the promisor. In that event, can one argue that
the contract breach could also be considered negligent performance
of  the  contract?  Or  could  the  breach  also  involve  grossly  negligent
performance?  In  the  following  case  the  court  grappled  with  how  to
distinguish  between  a  tort  and  a  contract  action  in  instances  where
the  proof  of  the  tort  claim  necessarily  also  involved  conduct
constituting a contract breach.

SOUTHWESTERN BELL TELEPHONE v. DELANNEY
809 S.W.2d 493 (Tex. 1991)

        , J.

We consider whether a cause of action for negligence is stated by
an allegation that a telephone company negligently failed to perform
its  contract  to  publish  a  Yellow  Pages  advertisement.  The  court  of
appeals held that the company’s failure to perform its contract was a
basis  for  recovery  in  tort  as  well  as  contract,  and  that  the  clause
limiting the telephone company’s liability could not apply to limit tort
damages.  We  reverse  the  judgment  of  the  court  of  appeals  and
render judgment in favor of Bell.

Eugene  DeLanney  advertised  his  real  estate  business  in  the
Galveston  Yellow  Pages  for  several  years.  For  the  1980-1981
directory,  he  again  contracted  with  Bell  for  a  Yellow  Pages
advertisement.  At  this  time  DeLanney  had  two  business  phones,  a
rotary  line  and  a  single  line.  Prior  to  publication  of  the  1980-1981
directory, DeLanney’s wife asked Bell to cancel the single line and add
a  third  number  to  their  existing  rotary  line.  The  Yellow  Pages
advertisement  was  billed  to  DeLanney’s  single  line.  When  that  line
was  canceled,  DeLanney’s  Yellow  Pages  advertisement  was
automatically  deleted  from  the  directory  due  to  Bell’s
internal
procedures.

When  the  advertisement  was  not  published  as  promised,
DeLanney sued Bell alleging negligence. Bell answered and urged by
special  exception  that  DeLanney’s  petition  failed  to  state  a  cause  of
action for negligence. No ruling was made on this special exception,
and  DeLanney  proceeded  to  trial.  [After  plaintiff  Delanney  rested  his
case in chief, defendant Bell moved for a directed verdict, but the trial
court denied the motion as to the negligence claim and submitted the
case to the jury.]

The  jury  found  that  Bell  was  negligent  in  omitting  DeLanney’s
advertisement from the Yellow Pages and that such negligence was a
proximate  cause  of  damages  to  DeLanney.  The  jury  assessed  these
damages at $109,000 for lost proﬁts in the past and $40,000 for lost
proﬁts in the future. After ordering a partial remittitur which reduced
future  lost  proﬁts  to  $21,480,  the  trial  court  rendered  judgment  for
DeLanney. Bell appealed.

The court of appeals, with one justice concurring and one justice
dissenting,  afﬁrmed.  A  majority  of  the  court  held  that  Bell’s
cancellation of DeLanney’s Yellow Pages advertisement was correctly
submitted  as  a  negligence  claim.  The  dissenting  justice  argued  that
because  DeLanney  sought  damages  for  breach  of  a  duty  created
under  the  contract,  rather  than  a  duty  imposed  by  law,  the  claim
sounded only in contract. We agree with the dissent.

The  majority  below  relied  on  Montgomery  Ward  &  Co.  v.
Scharrenbeck,  204  S.W.2d  508,  510  (Tex.  1947),  where  we  quoted
from 38 Am. Jur. Negligence §20 (1941) as follows:

Accompanying every contract is a common-law duty to perform with care, skill,
reasonable  expedience  and  faithfulness  the  thing  agreed  to  be  done,  and  a
negligent failure to observe any of these conditions is a tort, as well as a breach
of the contract.

In  Scharrenbeck,  the  defendant  agreed  to  repair  a  water  heater  in
plaintiff’s home. A short time after repair, the heater ignited the roof,
its  contents.  Although  the  contract
destroying  the  house  and
obligated the defendant to put the water heater back in good working
order,  the  law  also  implied  a  duty  to  the  defendant  to  act  with
reasonable skill and diligence in making the repairs so as not to injure
a person or property by his performance. In failing to repair the water
heater properly, the defendant breached its contract. In burning down
plaintiff’s home, the defendant breached a common-law duty as well,
thereby providing a basis for plaintiff’s recovery in tort.

The  principle  recognized

in  Scharrenbeck  has  also  been
recognized by commentators in this area. As one prominent authority
has  explained:  “Tort  obligations  are  in  general  obligations  that  are
imposed by law — apart from and independent of promises made and
therefore  apart  from  the  manifested  intention  of  the  parties — to
avoid  injury  to  others.”  W.  Keeton,  D.  Dobbs,  R.  Keeton  &  D.  Owen,
Prosser  and  Keeton  on  The  Law  of  Torts  §92  at  655  (5th  Ed.  1984)
[hereinafter “Prosser and Keeton”]. If the defendant’s conduct — such
as  negligently  burning  down  a  house — would  give  rise  to  liability
independent of the fact that a contract exists between the parties, the
plaintiff’s claim may also sound in tort. Conversely, if the defendant’s
conduct — such  as  falling  to  publish  an  advertisement — would  give
rise  to  liability  only  because  it  breaches  the  parties’  agreement,  the
plaintiff’s claim ordinarily sounds only in contract.

In determining whether the plaintiff may recover on a tort theory, it
is also instructive to examine the nature of the plaintiff’s loss. When
the only loss or damage is to the subject matter of the contract, the
plaintiff’s action is ordinarily on the contract. See Prosser and Keeton
at 656; 1 J. Edgar, Jr. & J. Sales, Texas Torts and Remedies §1.03[4][b]
at 1-36 (1990). We applied this analysis in Jim Walter Homes, Inc. v.
Reed, 711 S.W.2d 617, 618 (Tex. 1986), where we wrote:

in  tort  or  contract  alone  or
The  acts  of  a  party  may  breach  duties
simultaneously  in  both.  The  nature  of  the  injury  most  often  determines  which
duty  or  duties  are  breached.  When  the  injury  is  only  the  economic  loss  to  the
subject of a contract itself the action sounds in contract alone.

Bell’s duty to publish DeLanney’s advertisement arose solely from the
lost  proﬁts,  were  only  for  the
contract.  DeLanney’s  damages,
economic loss caused by Bell’s failure to perform. Although DeLanney
pleaded his action as one in negligence, he clearly sought to recover
the  beneﬁt  of  his  bargain  with  Bell.  We  hold  that  Bell’s  failure  to
publish the advertisement was not a tort. Under our analysis in Reed,
DeLanney’s  claim  was  solely  in  contract.  [The  court  found  that  the
plaintiff  had  waived  any  contract  claim  by  failing  to  submit  jury
questions on that cause of action.]

For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the court of appeals is

reversed, and judgment is rendered that DeLanney take nothing.

        , J., concurring

I  agree  with  the  court  that  Bell’s  failure  to  publish  the
advertisement was not a tort and that it sounded solely in contract. I
also  agree  that  DeLanney  failed  to  discharge  his  burden  to  obtain
afﬁrmative  ﬁndings  to  jury  questions  on  the  contract.  However,  I  do
not fault the court of appeals for its confusion. We have muddled the
law of “contorts” and an all encompassing bright line demarcation of
what constitutes a tort distinct from breach of contract has proven to

be elusive. See generally W. Prosser & W. Keeton, The Law of Torts §1
(5th ed. 1984).

DeLanney and the court of appeals rely heavily on the statement
in  Montgomery  Ward  &  Co.  v.  Scharrenbeck,  146  Tex.  153,  204
S.W.2d 508, 510 (Tex. 1947), that:

Accompanying every contract is a common-law duty to perform with care, still,
reasonable  expedience  and  faithfulness  the  thing  agreed  to  be  done,  and  a
negligent failure to observe any of these conditions is a tort, as well as a breach
of the contract.

this  broad

language,  not  every  breach  of  contract
Despite
accompanied  by  negligence  creates  a  cause  of  action  in  tort.  In
International  Printing  Pressman  &  Assistants’  Union  v.  Smith,  145
Tex. 399, 198 S.W.2d 729, 735 (Tex. 1946), we acknowledged that no
single concise rule will deﬁne the rights of parties in every situation.
We nonetheless wrote:

Generally  speaking,  “actions  in  contract  and  in  tort  are  to  be  distinguished  in
that  an  action  in  contract  is  for  the  breach  of  a  duty  arising  out  of  a  contract
either express or implied, while an action in tort is for a breach of duty imposed
by law. . . . ” “If the action is not maintainable without pleading and proving the
contract,  where  the  gist  of  the  action  is  the  breach  of  the  contract,  either  by
malfeasance  or  nonfeasance,  it  is,  in  substance  an  action  on  the  contract,
whatever may be the form of the pleading.” (citations omitted).

Id.  at  735.  I  believe  that  this  formulation  comes  closer  than
Scharrenbeck  to  stating  a  general  rule  to  distinguish  contract  from
tort  and  that  the  broad  language  in  Scharrenbeck  must  be  read  in
light  of  the  particular  circumstances  of  that  case.  The  opinion  in
Scharrenbeck is correct in its observation that a contract may be the
occasion that brings the parties together, but it is the relationship or
situation of the parties that gives rise to a duty in law, the breach of
which  is  a  tort.  Had  Montgomery  Ward  repaired  the  water  heater
gratuitously, it would have owed Scharrenbecka duty not to create a

dangerous  condition.  Thus  the  duty  to  not  create  a  dangerous
condition existed independent of any contractual relationship.

In summary, when a party must prove the contents of its contract
and  must  rely  on  the  duties  created  therein,  the  action  is  “in
substance  an  action  on  the  contract,  even  though  it  is  denominated
an  action  for  negligent  performance  of  the  contract.”  Bernard
Johnson, Inc. v. Continental Constructors, Inc., 630 S.W.2d 365, 368
(Tex. App. — Austin 1982, writ ref’d n.r.e.).

NOTES AND PROBLEMS

1. Why  Contract  vs.  Tort  Matters.   In  the  Southwestern Bell  case,
why was the plaintiff attempting to pursue a tort claim rather than a
contract  claim?  Notice  the  reference  early  in  the  opinion  to  a
liquidated  damages  clause  in  the  Yellow  Pages  contract.  On  a  tort
claim this would not cap the recovery of full compensatory damages
like  it  might  in  a  contract  breach  action.  In  other  instances,  the  tort
versus  contract  issue  may  arise  because  the  claimant  might  try  to
sue on a tort theory in order to try to justify a submission of a punitive
damage question to the jury.

2.  Negligent  Performance  of  a  Contract  Duty.   Much  of  the
foregoing opinion revolves around trying to determine if this case was
distinguishable  from  the  Sharrenbeck  decision  discussed  by  the
court. How convinced are you by the majority’s distinction? How clear
is that distinction? What analysis should be employed going forward
after Southwestern Bell?

3. Acts vs. Omissions.  Do you ﬁnd it useful to distinguish between
cases  of  non-performance  of  a  contractual  duty  and  cases  of  poor
performance  of  a  contractual  duty?  Would  this  dichotomy  help  to
explain  the  difference
in  outcomes  between  Sharrenbeck  and
Southwestern Bell?

4.  Problems.   Using  the  two-part  test  from  Southwestern  Bell
(analyzing  whether  a  separate  tort  duty  existed  independent  of  the
contract  and  whether  any  separate  tort  damages  were  incurred),
analyze the following scenarios to determine if a tort claim might be
maintainable:

A.  A  defendant  water  heater  repairperson  agrees  to  ﬁx  the
plaintiff’s water heater but never shows up. By virtue of this lack
of repair, the water heater explodes and destroys the house.

B.  Southwestern  Bells  agrees

to  place  a  Yellow  Pages
advertisement  knowing  at  the  time  of  doing  so  that  it  was
already at 100 percent capacity and would not be able to include
the plaintiff’s ad within its publication.

C.  Defendant  employer  agrees  to  provide  health  insurance  to  the
plaintiff. After the plaintiff is diagnosed with cancer and begins
receiving  expensive  chronic  medical  treatment,  the  employer
decides to increase the deductible of only that sick employee to
astronomical  heights.  This  conduct  causes  great  anguish  and
emotional disturbance. The plaintiff alleges intentional infliction
of emotional anguish in addition to contract breach.

Upon Further Review

While many law students (and members of the public) perceive
torts  as  solely  related  to  personal  injury  or  property  damage
claims, in fact there are increasing numbers of tort suits ﬁled by
businesses against other businesses. For the lawyer who enjoys
having clients rich enough to pay high hourly fees, yet yearns to
represent  plaintiffs,  the  world  of  business  torts  can  be  quite
enticing, because corporations are just as likely to be claimants
as defendants in this area. Many, though not all, of the business
torts
in  the  context  of  contractual
relationships;  a  recurring  theme,  therefore,  in  business  torts

litigated  today  arise

concerns whether and when to recognize a tort claim rather than
relegating the parties to the world of contract law. Despite many
business tort causes of action being quite ancient, their modern
adaptation and interpretation had led to this area being uniquely
in  flux.  For  those  students  of  the  law  who  enjoy  grappling  with
complex  issues,  business  torts  can  be  very  enjoyable.  While
there are many business tort causes of action that we simply do
not have time to encounter here (e.g., misappropriation of trade
secrets,  business  disparagement,  breach  of  ﬁduciary  duty,
commercial  defamation),  the  claim  that  has  long  predominated
in  this  ﬁeld  concerns  a  common  law  claim  for  fraud.  Fraud
permeates the law and its study can be endless. Understanding
what
(or  conduct)  are  considered
misrepresentations is the beginning point in any fraud analysis.
Further,  fault  and  justiﬁable  reliance  are  elements  that  can  be
in  many  factual  scenarios.  And  while  negligent
daunting
misrepresentation  can  often  be  brought  in  cases  that  involve
conduct close to fraud, this cause of action has some signiﬁcant
limitations  in  its  application — most  notably,  concerning  the
issue of duty. Finally, while it is clear that only intentional and not
negligent claims of interference with contract will be considered
by  the  courts,  the  analytical  distinctions  between  interference
with  existing  contracts  and
interference  with  prospective
contracts has caused great angst for lawyers and litigants trying
to understand their rights.
