PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION

This book is designed to provide a concise analysis of the
conceptual foundations of tort liability. Although the book is de-
signed to be used mainly by first-year law students, it is also of use
to upper-class students and practitioners seeking an overview of
particular areas of tort law. Having taught courses in Tort Law for
almost forty years, I have come to recognize students’ need for
something beyond the typical casebook to help them understand
what is going on in the cases and in class. Yet the kind of books
that are traditionally available do not always satisfy this need.
Books of rules don’t explain what lies behind the rules; and
treatises are both too long and, often, not sufficiently analytical.
What first-year students need is a book that helps them to think
about “‘what the Professor was getting at’”’ without spoon-feeding it
to them. I hope that this book does exactly that.

The organization and strategy of the book are as follows. I have
found that students often are much better able to understand the
cases they study during their first few weeks in law school if they
appreciate something about the procedure that has brought the
case to the point where it can be decided on appeal. In addition,
often some part of the earliest classes is devoted to discussion of the
purposes served by the imposition of tort liability. Therefore, Chap-
ter One provides a primer on procedure and discusses the functions
of tort liability. Thereafter the book follows the pattern of most of
the major casebooks, beginning with material on intentional physi-
cal injury and then moving on to negligence, causation, defenses,
products liability, affirmative and limited duty, and damages. This
material pretty well coincides with what is taught in the typical one
semester course in Torts. There follow Chapters on subjects that
are usually taken up in a second-semester or Torts II course, on
tort reform and alternative compensation systems, defamation,
invasion of privacy, misrepresentation, and interference with con-
tract and prospective contractual advantage.

My strategy throughout the book is to provide a brief summary
of the rules that govern a particular area, but then to devote the
majority of the analysis to an examination of the purposes the rules
serve and the arguments that can be made for and against the rules
as they stand. Where some knowledge of the way the law has
developed over time can help the reader to appreciate the current

Vv
PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION

state of the law, I have tried to provide a capsule history that puts
things in context. In short, the reader will find a conceptual
analysis of virtually all the major issues in tort law. Ideally, the
student who has read the material on a particular subject before he
or she goes to class will be prepared to discuss not only what the
cases hold, but their implications as well. Although I have discussed
most of what would be covered in two semesters of tort law,
inevitably there have been a few omissions. I have barely talked
about the torts of trespass to land and conversion of property, for
example, and have entirely omitted malicious prosecution.

I have dedicated this book to two people who have meant a lot
to me, both intellectually and personally. The greatest help I have
had in writing this book has come from my friend and former
colleague, Vincent Blasi. Over the years we have had countless
discussions about torts, as we both taught first-year torts classes,
and for a decade as we co-taught a seminar on Tort Theory. He has
pushed, stimulated, and puzzled me with his questions and in-
sights, and he gave me very detailed comments on the fourth
edition of this book. I am grateful not only for his help, but for the
way he has single-handedly raised the level of my intellectual
satisfaction. Andrew Delbanco has been a great professional and
personal friend, acquainting me with ways of thinking that would
never have occurred to me, and providing me with emotional
sustenance both on and off the golf course. We have smiled at fate
together, agonized about our children together, and, most impor-
tantly, consistently laughed out loud together. Both Vince and
Andy have enriched my life.

THE NATURE AND FUNCTIONS OF TORT
Law

The law of torts (a name derived from the Latin word for
“twisted” and from the French word for injury or ‘“‘wrong”’) mainly
concerns the rights of private parties to obtain monetary compensa-
tion from those who have caused them injury or damage. Most of
tort law is ‘“common law,” that is, law made by courts rather than
legislatures. Legislatures enact statutes, whereas courts decide indi-
vidual cases. A series of judicial decisions based on the same
principle—usually at the appellate level—then comes to stand for a
rule of law. Most tort law is made by state rather than federal
courts. So although reference often is made to “‘the’’ law of torts, in
fact there are fifty separate state regimes of tort law. These
different bodies of state tort law are nonetheless sufficiently similar
in important respects to constitute one body of law with variations
within it.

It is useful to begin at a general level before addressing
particular areas of tort law and specific legal doctrines. This Chap-
ter starts with a brief discussion of the nature of tort law in order
to introduce the subject. As in many areas of the law, however, it is
impossible to obtain the fullest appreciation of substance if one
does not understand the procedural setting in which a substantive
rule has been made. The Chapter therefore turns next to the
procedural context in which tort law is made, surveying the points
of procedure that arise most frequently in tort cases. Finally, the
Chapter takes up the functions of tort law, surveying briefly the
different functions that have been attributed to tort law and that
figure prominently in the Chapters that follow this one.

I. Introduction

Courses in Torts often begin with the question, ‘“What is a
tort?’ Students give puzzled responses until the correct answer, “A
civil wrong not arising out of contract,” eventually emerges. This
answer is a good enough starting point, but it is both overinclusive
and underinclusive. Not all civil wrongs that do not arise out of
contract are torts. For example, many statutory schemes that

1
TORT LAW

create civil liability, such as Civil Rights statutes, involve neither
contract nor tort liability, although they resemble tort in an attenu-
ated way. And some torts actually do ‘‘arise’’ of out contract, at
least in a loose sense. Certain legal actions for bodily injury or
property damage caused by defective products, as well as claims for
bad-faith breach of contract, are examples. But these are, so to
speak, exceptions that prove the rule. For the most part tort law is
in fact a residual category of civil liability. Legally cognizable
wrongs that are not part of another discrete field of law tend to fall
under the rubric of tort law.

Tort law itself can be subdivided into two general categories,
based on the “‘standard of care’? whose breach may result in
liability. What might be called accident law is comprised of cases
imposing strict liability or negligence liability, usually for physical
injury—bodily injury or property damage. Strict liability is imposed
without regard to the degree of care that the defendant, or “‘tortfea-
sor,’ exercised. Negligence liability is imposed only upon proof of
some kind of carelessness—technically, the failure to exercise rea-
sonable care under the circumstances. In contrast, in what are
sometimes called the intentional torts, liability is not imposed for
negligence, but only upon proof of the defendant’s intention to
invade the legally protected interest of another. The intentional
torts involve a wide variety of non-accidental behavior. Some of this
behavior obviously merits the name “intentional” in the sense of
an intention to cause harm. A good deal of what falls in the
category of the intentional torts, however, does not necessarily
require or involve an intent to cause harm. Certain forms of
defamation and some invasions of privacy, to give just two exam-
ples, can result in liability even in the absence of intent to cause
harm, as long as the defendant intended to take the action that
caused the plaintiff harm. Nonetheless, this rough distinction be-
tween the torts that fall in the general area of accident law and
those informally classified as intentional is worth recognizing.

The distinction between tort liability for accidental and inten-
tional harm, however, goes only to the standard of care at issue.
Proof that the defendant violated the applicable standard of care is
not enough to warrant the imposition of tort liability. Breach of the
standard of care is merely one element of any ‘‘cause of action” —
basis for imposing liability—in tort. There must be proof that the
plaintiff suffered actionable harm, and that the defendant’s conduct
in breaching the applicable standard of care caused that harm.
Combining these requirements yields the four elements of any
cause of action in tort: 1) Duty (i.e., the legal duty to comply with a
particular standard of care); 2) Breach of Duty (ie., failure to

2
THE NATURE AND FUNCTIONS OF TORT LAW

comply with the applicable standard of care); 3) Causation; and 4)
Damages.

Although tort liability is imposed, under various circumstances,
for bodily injury, property damage, emotional harm, and economic
loss, liability for bodily injury and property damage dominates tort
law in practice. Consequently, it also dominates introductory
courses in tort law. The reason is that tort liability is much more
likely to be imposed when conduct causes physical harm than when
only emotional or only economic loss occurs. Bodily integrity is
central to people’s ability to benefit from all the other goods of life.
Greater obligations of safety therefore attach to conduct that risks
bodily injury, and tort law affords greater protection against such
risks. It would be much harder to justify also affording greater
protection against the risk of damage to property, except for the
fact that conduct that risks property damage typically simulta-
neously risks bodily injury. It is often a matter of serendipity
whether the conduct results in bodily injury, property damage, or
both.

Tort law in the United States has four features that are so
fundamental to its operation, even though their existence is not
logically necessary to it, that they are worth noting at the outset:

Jury Trial. In all state and federal courts there is a right to a
trial by jury in almost all tort cases. This produces a body of rules
about the allocation of authority between courts and juries. Much
of tort law emerges in decisions about this allocation of authority.
In addition, there is more potential for emotion and sympathy for
the plaintiff to influence the outcome, and less concern for consis-
tent treatment of similar cases, than there would be if ultimate
decisions were made by professional judges rather than by lay
juries. It is worth noting, however, that over ninety percent of all
tort suits are settled. Settlements typically are reached in anticipa-
tion of what would happen at trial. But many routine, small and
medium-sized claims are handled in a somewhat bureaucratic fash-
ion by lawyers and liability insurance companies, without careful
consideration of factual and legal nuances that would be relevant at
trial.

Liability Insurance.’ Beginning in the second half of the nine-
teenth century there was a significant increase in the incidence of
accidental injuries. This resulted from industrialization, the me-
chanization of transportation and a consequent increase in the risk

1. A brief, introductory primer on insurance, including liability insurance, is set
out at the beginning of Chapter Twelve. Interested readers may wish to review these
paragraphs now.
TORT LAW

of injury from railroads, trolley cars, and airplanes, and a political
and cultural shift that favored the greater socialization of risk
generally. In part to respond to the increased liability that resulted,
late in the nineteenth century liability insurance was introduced. It
has grown exponentially since then. Today, virtually all defendants
in bodily injury and property damage suits, and many defendants in
other kinds of suits, have at least some liability insurance. The
availability of liability insurance influences the decision whether to
sue and whom to sue. Moreover, over a period of more than a
century, the availability of insurance and the scope of tort liability
have influenced each other. The more tort liability expanded, the
more liability insurance became available. And often tort liability
expanded at least in part because liability insurance was, or could
be expected to become, available.”

The Contingent Fee System. Plaintiffs’ attorneys almost always
take cases on a “contingent-fee” basis. That is, the plaintiff's
attorney receives a percentage of the plaintiff’s recovery if the suit
is successful, and charges nothing if the suit is unsuccessful. The
result is that plaintiffs are not required to be able to pay their
attorneys in order to bring suit. In addition, the contingent fee
approach affects the selection of cases in which suit is brought,
because plaintiffs’ attorneys are heavily influenced by their pros-

pects of success and by the magnitude of the plaintiffs alleged
losses.

The “American Rule” for Costs. In our tort system, each party
pays its own costs, including counsel fees, win or lose. In contrast,
in many other systems, a loser-pays approach is applied. Under our
system, plaintiffs are less discouraged from bringing suit, because
they do not risk incurring a sizeable personal cost if they lose their
suits, and defendants must pay their own counsel fees and costs
even if they win. Obviously, fewer suits would be brought, whether
involving strong or weak claims, and some suits might be more
vigorously defended, under a loser-pays system.

These four features of tort law and liability have heavily
influenced its development. Together they help to account for the
great transformation of tort law that took place in the twentieth
century. From a comparatively obscure field of law with little
economic importance even in the late nineteenth century, the scope
and incidence of tort liability expanded substantially. Tort law had
become a major legal specialty of considerable economic importance
by the beginning of the twenty-first century. That is one reason

2. See Kenneth 8. Abraham, THe Liapiuity Century: INSURANCE AND Tort Law FROM
THE ProGREsSIVE Era To 9/11 (2008).
THE NATURE AND FUNCTIONS OF TORT LAW

that virtually every law school requires the study of tort law in the
first year. The other reason is that tort law is a near-perfect vehicle
for studying the legal process. And that is where we now turn.

II. Procedure in a Tort Suit: Where Tort Law
Comes From

Tort law does not simply spring spontaneously out of the
mouths of judges. Tort law is created through rulings that courts
make in lawsuits. These rulings are made when a lawyer for the
plaintiff or defendant requests that a judge do or not do something
as part of a lawsuit—e.g., when a lawyer makes a motion, objects to
the admissibility of evidence, or requests a particular instruction to
the jury. Often the substantive rules of tort law determine the
proper procedure to be followed by a court in ruling on such
requests, and the applicable rule of tort law can be inferred from a
court’s procedural ruling. Thus, to understand substance, one must
understand procedure; and to understand procedure, one must
understand substance. Turning your mind off when you encounter
a procedural issue in the course of examining a judicial opinion
usually is a big mistake, for it is in the resolution of procedural
issues that substantive law emerges.

There are five major phases of a tort suit: pleadings; pre-trial
motions; discovery; trial; and appeal. The pleadings initiate the
suit. Pre-trial motions raise legal issues that may clarify or narrow
the range of the dispute. Discovery is the process by which, prior to
trial, the parties obtain information about each side’s position and
about the facts as they will be presented at trial. At trial evidence is
introduced, the judge instructs the jury about the relevant legal
rules, the jury makes findings of fact, and the jury applies the rules
about which it has been instructed to its factual findings, yielding a
verdict from the jury and a consequent judgment issued by the trial
court either for the plaintiff or for the defendant. On appeal the
party who was unsuccessful at trial identifies what it contends were
legal errors committed by the trial judge, and the appellate court
determines whether any of these errors were committed.

A. Initial Pleadings

Tort suits proceed much like other civil actions. A lawsuit, or
action, is commenced when the injured party, or Plaintiff, files a
Complaint or Declaration, alleging facts giving rise to a cause of
action. The Complaint is said to contain ‘‘allegations’”’ because the
assertions in it do not count as facts unless and until the defendant

5
TORT LAW

admits them, or a jury finds them to be true at trial. A ‘“‘cause of
action”’ is the plaintiff's legally actionable claim, the basis upon
which he asserts a right to damages or other relief. Typically a
cause of action is the name of a particular tort, such as negligence,
battery, or defamation.

The Defendant is then served with the Complaint and a sum-
mons requiring the filing of an Answer, which admits or denies the
allegations of the Complaint. The answer also may state what are
known as Affirmative Defenses—defenses that the defendant is
required to raise specifically and prove at trial. Commonly the
defendant admits some of the plaintiff’s allegations, denies others,
and indicates that it possesses insufficient information as to still
others. By comparing the Complaint and the Answer the parties
can determine what is initially disputed and what is not. All the
documents mentioned thus far, as well as pre-trial motions filed
later, are typically referred to as the Pleadings.

B. Discovery

In the Discovery stage of the suit the parties are permitted to
seek information from each other about the nature of their posi-
tions and the evidence supporting them. Through written Interrog-
atories the parties may propound questions to be answered in
writing, and through oral Depositions witnesses (including the
plaintiff and the defendant) may be examined under oath to deter-
mine the scope and details of their possible testimony at trial. The
information sought in discovery need not be admissible in evidence
to be discoverable, as long as it has the potential to lead to
admissible evidence. For example, through discovery the defendant
may learn the precise nature of the injuries the plaintiff claims to
have suffered, and the basis for the plaintiffs claim that the
defendant was negligent. Similarly, the plaintiff may learn what
features of her claim the defendant contests and the basis for the
defendant’s contentions. Discovery reduces the element of surprise
at trial, thereby permitting the parties to prepare and focus only on
the issues actually in dispute, and promotes settlement before trial
by helping to inform the parties of the strengths and weaknesses of
each side’s position.

In the simplest of cases there is little discovery, but these days
discovery is an important part of virtually all cases. A single
deposition may take a day, two days, or even occasionally a week,
and may be preceded or followed by written interrogatories. Even
in a simple auto accident case discovery can take some time if there
are eye witnesses and medical experts who are in the possession of

6
THE NATURE AND FUNCTIONS OF TORT LAW

potentially relevant information. On the other hand, in a complicat-
ed tort suit discovery may take months or even years, if there are
large numbers of documents to be obtained and many witnesses to
be deposed. For example, think of how many people may have
information that is potentially relevant when the manufacturer of a
prescription drug is sued for negligently failing to warn of a side
effect that injured the plaintiff. Research scientists, marketing
personnel, financial analysts, and management officials all may
know something relevant to the decisions that led to the failure to
warn. The plaintiff is likely to depose many, and perhaps all, of
these individuals.

C. Pre-Trial Motions

Pre-trial motions may be made before or after discovery. This
is the first stage at which the court makes important “‘procedural”’
decisions. For our purposes the important pre-trial motions are the
Motion to Dismiss and the motion for Summary Judgment. The
former tends to be made before discovery and the latter after
discovery.

The function of a motion to dismiss the plaintiff's complaint is
to test the legal sufficiency of the plaintiff's allegations. For pur-
poses of the motion the plaintiff's allegations are accepted as true.
By making the motion the defendant asserts that, even if the
allegations are true, the plaintiff does not have a valid, legally
cognizable claim. For example, suppose that the plaintiff alleged
that he was walking down the street when the defendant frowned
at him, and that as a result he experienced emotional pain and
suffering. The defendant’s motion to dismiss for failure to state a
cause of action (or as it is described in the federal system, for
“failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted’’) would
in effect admit that the defendant frowned at the plaintiff, and
admit that the plaintiff experienced emotional pain and suffering as
a result, but would deny that this behavior is actionable—i.e., deny
that this behavior constitutes a tort.*

These motions are made prior to discovery. In contrast, after
discovery a motion for Summary Judgment by either side asserts
that 1) there is no genuine issue of material fact, and 2) based on
the undisputed facts, the party making the motion is entitled to

3. A similar motion in some states is known as a Demurrer. But demurrers can
be filed by either side, and simply test the legal sufficiency of the pleading to which
they respond. For instance, a defendant’s demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint is in
effect a motion to dismiss; a plaintiff's demurrer to a defendant’s answer is in effect
a motion to strike the answer as a legally insufficient defense.

7
TORT LAW

judgment ‘‘as a matter of law.’’ For example, if discovery reveals no
dispute between the parties that while driving blindfolded down
Main Street the defendant struck and injured the plaintiff, the
plaintiff would move for summary judgment. The only question
would be whether the defendant was negligent ‘“‘as a matter of law”
or, on the contrary, a jury could legitimately conclude on the basis
of the undisputed facts that the defendant was not negligent. In all
probability the plaintiff would be granted summary judgment under
these circumstances. Thus, whereas typically a motion to dismiss or
a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of mere allegations, a motion
for summary judgment tests the legal sufficiency of a party’s
position based on undisputed and therefore established facts. But in
other respects the two kinds of motions function in a very similar
way: they take certain facts to be established, and then assert that
on the basis of these facts (and sometimes notwithstanding these
facts) the party making the motion is entitled to prevail as a matter
of law, without the need for decision by a jury.

From these examples it should be obvious that these motions
are not ‘‘mere”’ procedure. Rather, their proper resolution depends
on the applicable substantive rule of tort law. The motion to
dismiss a suit claiming damages for injury caused by being frowned
at cannot be granted or denied without knowing whether frowning
under those circumstances constitutes a tort (which of course it
does not). And the motion for summary judgment cannot be grant-
ed or denied without identifying the applicable rule governing the
role of the jury in determining whether driving blindfolded down
Main Street is negligent. If the question whether the defendant was
negligent must always be decided by a jury, then the plaintiff's
motion for summary judgment must be denied. But if there are
cases in which it can be said ‘as a matter of law’ that the
defendant is negligent (and as we shall see in Chapter Three there
are such cases), and this is one of those cases, then summary
judgment should be granted. Much of tort law, in fact, is made and
applied through rulings on motions such as these.

D. Trial

If a ruling on a pre-trial motion has not disposed of the case
and the parties have not settled, then the case proceeds to trial. At
trial the allocation of decision-making authority between the court
(i.e., the trial judge) and the jury is of crucial significance: courts
only decide issues of law; juries only decide issues of fact. When
there is a trial without a jury—a “bench trial’’—the trial judge
wears two hats. Then the trial judge both rules on the law and
serves as the “‘trier of fact.”’
THE NATURE AND FUNCTIONS OF TORT LAW

1. Fact-Finding by the Jury

There are two different kinds of fact-finding that juries per-
form. One is making ‘“‘pure’”’ findings of fact. This requires answer-
ing empirical questions about the world, past, present, or future:
did the defendant strike the plaintiff, how long had the banana peel
been lying on the supermarket aisle before the plaintiff slipped on
it, would the plaintiff have chosen to use the defendant’s product if
he had been warned of the risks it posed, how much suffering has
the plaintiff experienced as a result of her injury, what medical
treatment will the plaintiff need in the future? I do not mean to
minimize how difficult it sometimes is to answer merely empirical
questions. Predicting how much an injured person will suffer from
her injury twenty years from now is a pure empirical question, but
that does not make it any easier to answer.

In contrast, a second kind of “finding of fact’’ that juries are
required to make involves what are sometimes called mixed ques-
tions of fact and law. In answering these questions the jury does
not make empirical findings. Rather, it evaluates or characterizes
empirical facts that it has already found, or applies the law to these
facts. To do this the jury makes such determinations as, was the
defendant negligent, did the plaintiff assume the risk of harm, was
the defendant’s product defective because of its design?

These two kinds of findings of fact are made at the close of a
trial in which evidence has been introduced directed at proving the
facts relevant to the four necessary elements of the plaintiff’s case:
1) duty (a legal issue that sometimes depends on facts); 2) breach of
duty; 3) causation; and 4) damages. Typically the plaintiff bears the
burden of proof on all factual elements of the claim. That burden in
turn consists of two parts. The ‘“‘burden of production” requires the
plaintiff to introduce evidence from which the jury ‘“‘could”’ find
that each element of the case has been proved. Introducing evi-
dence that satisfies this standard constitutes making out a prima
facie case. For instance, in an intersection collision case the plain-
tiff might testify that he was proceeding through the intersection
when the defendant’s vehicle, which was required to stop at a stop
sign, collided with his own vehicle, breaking his arm. Ordinarily
this testimony would make out a prima facie case. That is, if the
jury believed the testimony, it could find, but would not be required
to find, that the defendant had failed to yield the right of way, that
the defendant was negligent in failing to do so, and that this
negligence caused damage to the plaintiff's vehicle and a broken
arm.
TORT LAW

The second feature of the burden of proof, the “burden of
persuasion,” requires the plaintiff actually to persuade the jury by
a preponderance of the evidence, of the truth of the facts relevant to
each element of his or her claim. To satisfy this preponderance
standard, the jury must be persuaded that it is ‘“more probable
than not” that the alleged facts relevant to each element of the
claim are true. Whether the plaintiff satisfied this standard would
depend on whether the jury believed his testimony, what the
defendant and other witnesses testified, and whether the jury
believed them.’ If the evidence on any element on which a party
bears the burden of persuasion is in “‘equipoise,”’ or evenly bal-
anced, then the party bearing that burden has not satisfied it.

2. Legal Rulings by the Court

What the court does in a tort suit follows from the fundamen-
tal point that courts do not find facts, but only make decisions of
law. The legal function of the judge and the fact-finding function of
the jury operate (and interact) at trial in connection with the
court’s rulings on the admissibility of evidence, on motions such as
a motion for a directed verdict, and in the court’s instructions to
the jury. First, when oral or documentary testimony is offered into
evidence, the court rules on its admissibility. The principal rule
governing admissibility is that evidence which is irrelevant to the
issues to be decided is not admissible. This rule does not rule
evidence in, since not all relevant evidence is admissible, but it
rules evidence out. This is a simple enough, but very important
rule: nothing irrelevant is admissible. By applying the substantive
rules of tort law, the court can determine whether evidence is or is
not irrelevant and therefore whether it is automatically inadmissi-
ble. For example, if intent to cause physical harm to the plaintiff is
not a necessary element of the tort of battery, then testimony by
the defendant that he did not intend to cause the plaintiff harm
when he slapped him on the back after telling a joke would be
inadmissible, because this evidence would be irrelevant. On the
other hand, if failure to comply with a safety statute enacted by the
legislature is negligence, then evidence that the defendant violated
the statute is obviously relevant and (absent special circumstances)
will be admissible. A number of the rules of tort law are reflected
in, and can be deduced from, rulings on the admissibility of evi-
dence of this sort.

4. On certain affirmative defenses (e.g., that the plaintiff is barred from recovery
because she assumed the risk of the defendant’s negligence) and in a few unusual
situations, the defendant rather than the plaintiff bears the burden of proof.

10
THE NATURE AND FUNCTIONS OF TORT LAW

Second, the court decides a legal question when it applies the
rule that a factual contention may only be submitted to the jury for
decision if there is evidence to support it. If there is no evidence to
support a contention whose proof is essential for a party to prevail,
then that party has not met the burden of production, and the
opposing party prevails. But if there is evidence to ‘‘make out a jury
question” on all the elements of the case, then the case is submit-
ted to the jury. The significance of the decision to submit an issue
to the jury cannot be emphasized enough: submitting an issue to
the jury means that the jury may decide the issue for or against the
plaintiff, for or against the defendant. The same issue, submitted to
different juries, might be decided differently. That is why the
standard for making out a jury question is often said to be whether
“reasonable people could disagree’ about the question. If reason-
able people could disagree, the case goes to the jury; if reasonable
people could not disagree, then either the plaintiff wins as “a
matter of law’’ (having prevailed on all the elements as a matter of
law) or the defendant wins because, as matter of law, the plaintiff
failed to provide evidence sufficient to make out a jury question on
one or more of the necessary elements of his case.

The question whether an issue poses a question for the jury
may be raised at the close of either party’s evidence, when the
opposing party moves for a directed verdict (or in the federal
system, a motion for judgment as a matter of law or “JML’’). This
phrasing is a holdover from the time when, if the motion was
granted, the court literally “directed”’ the jury to bring in a verdict
for the party whose motion prevailed. But the granting of a motion
for a directed verdict today means that the court determines as a
matter of law, rather than the jury finding as a matter of fact,
which party wins. Ordinarily plaintiffs’ counsel do not move for
directed verdicts, on the theory that if their case is strong enough
to warrant a directed verdict, the jury will very likely find in the
plaintiff's favor anyway. The granting of a motion for a directed
verdict in such a situation might afford the defendant a basis for
appeal that it would not otherwise have. So typically motions for
directed verdicts are made by defendants. There is necessarily some
judgment involved when a trial court decides whether reasonable
people could disagree about a particular question of fact. Nonethe-
less, because the court rather than the jury makes that decision it
is considered a question of law, even though it requires a conclu-
sions about facts. The consequence is that this decision is subject to
legal review on appeal, as described below.

Rules of tort law are embedded in and reflected by rulings on
motions for directed verdicts, just as they are embedded in rulings

11
TORT LAW

on the admissibility of evidence. For example, there is liability in
tort for injuries caused by defective products, as the discussion of
products liability in Chapter Nine indicates. Suppose that the
plaintiff is injured when she dives into an above-ground swimming
pool with aluminum sides. She submits evidence of the dangers that
this product design poses (as well as proof of causation and dam-
ages). The defendant then moves for a directed verdict on the
ground that the plaintiff submitted no evidence that an alternative
safer design of the product was feasible. The court would grant the
motion in a state where the rule is that a product design is not
defective unless an alternative safer design was feasible. On the
other hand, the court would deny the motion in a state where the
rule is that such proof is not required in order to show that a
product’s design is defective. In effect, the motion for a directed
verdict is the trial equivalent of the pre-trial motion to dismiss for
failure to state a viable claim or cause of action. Whereas the
motion to dismiss tests the legal sufficiency of the plaintiff’s allega-
tions by assuming them to be true and contending that the plaintiff
nevertheless is not entitled to recover, a defendant’s motion for a
directed verdict tests the legal sufficiency of the plaintiff's evidence
by assuming it to be true and contending that the plaintiff never-
theless is not entitled to recover. By the same token, a plaintiff’s
motion for a directed verdict tests the legal sufficiency of the
defendant’s position by assuming the defendant’s evidence to be
true and contending that the plaintiff is nevertheless entitled to
recover as a matter of law.

Sometimes courts decline to grant directed verdicts even when
they believe that doing so would be proper, so as to obtain a record
of what the jury verdict is in the event that, contrary to what the
court expects, the case does pose a question for the jury. For
example, suppose the court concludes that the plaintiff is entitled to
a directed verdict. The court nonetheless submits the case to the
jury for decision. If the jury finds for the plaintiff, the court enters
a judgment in the plaintiff's favor. But if the jury finds for the
defendant, the court then grants the plaintiff's motion for judgment
notwithstanding the verdict—also known as a ‘‘j.n.o.v.”, which
stands for judgment non obstante veredicto (or in the federal sys-
tem, ‘judgment as a matter of law”). The court thereby has on
record the decision of the jury if it turns out on appeal that the
court was correct to submit the case to the jury—i.e., that it would
have been incorrect to grant a directed verdict for the plaintiff and
was incorrect to grant the plaintiff's motion for a j.n.o.v. In this
manner the same issue that is raised by a motion for a directed
verdict can be decided, but without the burden of a new trial if

12
THE NATURE AND FUNCTIONS OF TORT LAW

granting the motion would have been error. The appellate court
either affirms the trial court, or reverses and enters a judgment for
the party in whose favor the jury brought back its verdict, without
the need for a new trial simply to see what the jury would have
decided had it only been given the chance to decide. It was given
that chance.

The third way in which the allocation of authority between
court and jury operates is through the court’s instructions to the
jury at the close of the evidence. In its instructions the court
describes the rules of tort law to be applied by the jury. The judge
identifies the factual disputes the jury should resolve and the rules
of law the jury should apply to its factual findings, in order to
determine whether to bring back a verdict for the plaintiff or the
defendant. The substantive rules of tort law are thus expressed in
these instructions. For example, in a negligence case the judge will
explain the concept of negligence; the meaning of the requirement
that the defendant’s negligence, if any, have caused the plaintiff
injury; the rules governing the assessment of damages; and the way
in which the jury is to determine whether any defenses interposed
by the defendant should prevail. The jury then retires to deliberate
and bring back its verdict.

3. Verdicts

In most cases the jury is asked to return a general verdict,
simply indicating whether it finds for the plaintiff or defendant,
and if the former, the amount of damages awarded. In most states,
however, the court has discretion to ask the jury to return a special
verdict, answering each of the specific questions posed by the
instructions as to whether there was proof of each element of the
plaintiff's case and any defenses available. There are number of
differences between these two approaches. Since instructions typi-
cally are given orally and except in very lengthy cases jurors do not
take notes, jurors must try to remember the instructions given to
them when they are asked to return a general verdict. In contrast,
when a jury is asked to return a special verdict, the jury normally is
given a written list of the questions to be answered. The jury can
therefore use this list of questions, or “‘special verdict form,” to
guide its deliberations.

In addition—and perhaps more importantly—when the jury is
required to bring in a special verdict, the court can examine the
verdict to determine whether the jury’s answers are internally
consistent. For example, after being properly instructed, if the jury
indicates on its special verdict form that it finds that the defendant
was negligent but that the defendant’s negligence did not cause the

13
TORT LAW

plaintiff any injury, yet the jury still makes an award of damages to
the plaintiff, the court will detect this inconsistency: the jury found
that the plaintiff did not meet her burden of proving causation, but
the jury nonetheless imposed liability on the defendant. The court
will therefore grant the defendant’s motion for judgment notwith-
standing the verdict. If the jury had made a similar mistake in its
deliberations prior to returning a general verdict in favor of the
plaintiff, the mistake would not be detected. Indeed, asking the jury
to return a general verdict not only forfeits the opportunity to
detect honest mistakes, but in a sense gives the jury the power
deliberately to ignore the instructions.

The natural question to ask at this point is why special verdicts
are not used more often, or universally required, in order to
preclude the jury’s inadvertent or even deliberate circumvention of
the court’s instructions. One possible answer is that using special
verdicts more frequently would in fact be a good idea, and that the
prevalence of the general verdict procedure simply reflects the
stubborn conservatism of the law. But there is something more
going on here than the mere stubborn refusal of the law to change.
Tort law has undergone a great deal of change over the years, after
all, much of it in the hands of the very judges who continue to
employ general verdict rather than special verdict procedure. It
makes more sense to infer that there is something desirable about
the insulation of jury deliberations from judicial review that results
from asking juries only for general verdicts.

What might that be? The answer, I think, is that tort law is
ambivalent about the relationship between its rules and the func-
tion of the jury. On the one hand, the trial judge must strictly apply
the rules of tort law in making decisions about the admissibility of
evidence, in ruling on motions, and in formulating instructions to
the jury. On the other hand, rules are rigid things. We have juries
in tort cases not because we need fact-finding robots, but because
they can bring the common sense of the community into the
courtroom. Asking juries for general verdicts reflects the recogni-
tion that not everything that is relevant to the outcome of a lawsuit
can be fully captured by a judge’s oral summary of a set of legal
rules. The request for a general verdict implicitly permits jurors to
take other factors into account, not because they are told that they
are permitted to do so, but because under a general verdict ap-
proach there is no way to police such behavior. At its extreme, of
course, this approach permits jury nullification of the law. But in
its more moderate manifestations, this approach permits juries to
soften the hard edges of rules, without paying painstaking attention
to the precise verbal formulations in which the rules are embodied.

14
THE NATURE AND FUNCTIONS OF TORT LAW

Under a special verdict approach, that is much more difficult,
because the jury’s task is defined and contained by a set of specific
questions whose answers are supposed to be the jury’s only con-
cern. To oversimplify only a bit, the request for a special verdict
seeks specific answers; but the request for a general verdict seeks
justice.

E. Appeal

After a judgment is entered, the losing party may appeal. The
party appealing is referred to as the ‘“‘appellant’’ (sometimes the
“‘petitioner’’) and the opposing party is referred to as the ‘‘appel-
lee”? (sometimes the ‘‘respondent’’). The key point to understand
about appeal, whether in tort or other cases, is that the only basis
for any appeal is that the trial judge committed an ‘error.’ This
fundamental point follows from what appellate courts can and
cannot do. Like trial judges, appellate courts make decisions of law
only. Appellate courts have no authority to make factual findings.
There is no new evidence introduced on appeal, there is no jury,
and there is no fact-finding. Rather, appellate courts accept the
factual findings made by juries at trial, or accept as fact the
findings that logically must be inferred from general verdicts re-
turned by juries.®

It follows from the fact that appellate courts make only legal
decisions that they review only the decisions of the trial judge,
because only the trial judge has made legal decisions at trial. In tort
cases, this means that appellate courts review the ‘‘procedural’’
moves of the trial court, which of course reflect the substantive
rules of tort law: rulings on the admissibility of evidence, disposi-
tion of the parties’ motions, and the formulation of instructions to
the jury. Thus, the following are examples of typical issues raised
on appeal: “‘Did the trial court err in admitting evidence that the
defendant did not intend to cause the plaintiff harm?’’; “Did the

5. This latter point is worth a bit of explanation. Suppose that in a negligence
case the plaintiff testifies as follows. He was a passenger in the defendant’s car when
he said to the defendant, ‘Slow down.”’ The defendant then nodded his head up and
down. However, the defendant testifies that the plaintiff never said those words to
him. The contention that the defendant failed to heed the plaintiff's warning is the
only evidence of negligence in the case. The jury finds for the plaintiff. At this point
it is therefore established as a fact that the defendant heard and failed to heed the
plaintiffs warning and that this failure was negligent, because that failure was the
only evidence of negligence. On appeal, the appellate court is not permitted to hold
that, although the jury found that the plaintiff did warn the defendant by saying
“Slow down,” the appellate court (unlike the jury) believes the defendant’s testimo-
ny and doubts that such a warning was given. On the contrary, the appellate court
must accept it as established that, for purposes of the legal issues that the court has
authority to decide, there was such a warning.

15
TORT LAW

trial court err in denying the defendant’s motion for a directed
verdict?’”’; and ‘“‘Did the trial court err in instructing the jury that
the defendant could not be held liable for battery if he did not
intend to harm the plaintiff?’’An appellate court has three alterna-
tives available to it: affirm, reverse, or reverse and remand for
further proceedings, such as a new trial.

Just as at trial each of the court’s “procedural” moves reflects
a particular substantive rule of tort law, so too on appeal the
appellate court’s decision reviewing the correctness of the trial
court’s actions reflects a substantive rule. Suppose that in a battery
case the evidence was that the defendant intended to touch the
plaintiff without permission, but that the defendant did not intend
to cause harm in doing so. The trial court then instructed the jury
that if the defendant did not intend to cause the plaintiff harm,
liability cannot be imposed. The jury then found for the defendant.
The plaintiff appealed, arguing that this instruction was incorrect,
because a defendant can be held liable for battery if he touches the
plaintiff without permission, even without intending to cause harm.
The appellate court will then apply the correct rule governing
liability for battery to determine whether the trial court’s instruc-
tion was or was not correct.’ This ruling will be embodied in a
written opinion explaining the basis for the appellate court’s deci-
sion and indicating whether the court’s instruction was or was not
correct in light of the substantive rules of battery.

III. The Nature of Tort Law

Fields of law normally do not come labeled with a self-designat-
ed character or set of goals. As a field that is predominately
common law—law made by courts adjudicating individual disputes
over a period of centuries—the law of torts has grown and evolved,
state-by-state, without any central, self-conscious authority to make
it responsive to a clear set of express goals. Although much of
modern tort law scholarship has been concerned with analysis of
and debate about the nature and proper functions of tort law, they
remain contested. Some scholars argue that tort law is, and should
be, rights-based. On this view, tort law is about redressing, or
providing recourse for, wrongs. It is about the relationship between
a wrongdoer and a victim. Others see tort law’s function as more
instrumental: to prevent wrongs, or to compensate those who suffer
loss. For many instrumentalists, tort law is, or should be, concerned

6. For an appellate opinion addressing this issue, see Vosburg v. Putney, 80 Wis.
523, 50 N.W. 403 (1891).

16
THE NATURE AND FUNCTIONS OF TORT LAW

among other things with the effect that imposing liability will have
on others beside the plaintiff and defendant. It is about the external
effects of imposing, or not imposing, liability. And still others see
tort law as a mixed system that performs a combination of these
and other functions.

A. Corrective Justice

One important rights-based understanding of the function of
tort liability is corrective justice. When one party wrongs another,
correction of the wrong may help to restore the moral balance
between them. In tort law, when bodily injury has occurred, the
injurer cannot literally rectify the injury. Liability is therefore
imposed for monetary compensation, though it is admittedly often a
poor substitute for prior good health. In cases involving only
economic loss the correction can be more nearly adequate and
complete. The case of the intentional wrongdoer is most obviously
an occasion for corrective justice. But in many cases of negligence
and even sometimes when there has been neither intention to cause
harm nor negligence, corrective justice may have appeal as a
justification for the imposition of liability.

The way in which correction actually occurs, however, may
affect the strength of the appeal of corrective justice as a justifica-
tion for imposing tort liability. The core of the notion of corrective
justice envisions an individual injurer who directly compensates an
individual victim, with the injurer’s own money. Here the correc-
tion of the wrong by the injurer is direct and close. In contrast, as
the connection between injurer and victim becomes less direct,
corrective justice seems less relevant. For example, if the injurer is
protected by liability insurance, she does not pay her victim direct-
ly. Instead, she has paid premiums for this insurance that may or
may not bear a close relation to the degree of risk that her activities
pose. Similarly, if the injurer is a corporation, then ultimately the
shareholders, employees, or customers of the corporation may bear
the cost of compensating the victim. In these situations an injustice
still is corrected, and the injurer is the one who has undertaken to
assure correction in the first instance. But because the injurer does
not necessarily end up actually shouldering the burden of correc-
tion, these situations are at some remove from a conception of
corrective justice as the face-to-face correction of a moral imbalance
between individuals. For this reason, there is a difference of opinion
among the commentators as to the importance of corrective justice
in modern tort law settings, where defendants typically are either

17
TORT LAW

large corporations or individuals who are covered by liability insur-
ance.

B. Civil Recourse

Whereas corrective justice focuses on what and why the defen-
dant is obligated to pay the plaintiff, another group of rights-
oriented scholars have focused on what the plaintiff is entitled to
receive. These scholars argue that tort liability is better understood
not as ensuring that injustice is corrected, but as providing victims
with recourse for civil wrongs. Under this view the payment of
damages for tortiously-caused harm should not be seen as being, or
even aspiring to be, fully compensatory or fully correcting a wrong.
Instead, the imposition of liability is a complex social practice that
vindicates victims’ need for recognition that they have been
wronged, in a manner that is proportional to the seriousness of the
wrong and the seriousness of their injury. What both the corrective
justice and civil recourse views of the function of tort law have in
common, despite their differences, is that they both understand tort
law as being mainly concerned with the moral or civil rights arising
out of the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant,
rather than with affecting the behavior of future actors or with
achieving the other sorts of instrumental goals that are described
below.

C. Optimal Deterrence

The imposition of tort lability not only corrects wrongs or
provides civil recourse for wrongs that have already occurred; it
also helps to prevent future tortious actions, by threatening poten-
tial wrongdoers with liability if they cause actionable harm. That is,
tort law is not only backward looking, but may also be forward
looking. It is not only about the relationship between injurer and
victim, but also about reducing the undesirable consequences of
risky activity. Not all risky activity is worth deterring, however, or
we would be required to take endless safety precautions at unlimit-
ed cost. Rather, the function of tort liability in this respect is to
promote optimal deterrence—that is, to deter excessively risky
activity so that only those losses worth avoiding are avoided.

Two points about this notion are worth emphasizing, for they
are sometimes difficult to appreciate. First, it follows from the
principle of optimal deterrence that deterring certain losses is not
worth what it would take to deter them. That is, imposing liability
for harm caused by an activity that poses some risk but that is not

18
THE NATURE AND FUNCTIONS OF TORT LAW

excessively risky would require foregoing some of the benefit of that
activity. Virtually every activity poses some risk, and therefore
sometimes results in loss—safely driven automobiles sometimes
collide, knives sometimes cut fingers, and so forth. Up to a point
tort law threatens liability for risky activity, but beyond that point
it does not, and the law tolerates the losses that result. Put harshly,
some losses—and this includes some personal injuries—are not
worth avoiding. Otherwise we would not require proof of negligence
in a whole series of cases, but would instead always impose liability
regardless of negligence. From the optimal deterrence standpoint,
the negligence requirement implies that some losses are worth
avoiding (those caused by negligence) but that some (those caused
without negligence) are not.

Second, nothing in the principle of optimal deterrence dictates
what values should be taken into account in determining which
losses are and which losses are not worth deterring. Some support-
ers of the principle of optimal deterrence promote it as an economic
concept that compares the monetary costs of risking losses with the
monetary costs of preventing losses. And some opponents of the
principle object to it for precisely that reason, since it seems to
them to ignore important human values. But the economic ap-
proach to optimal deterrence is merely one among a number of
possible conceptions. One might reasonably take the position that
the economic conception of deterrence is unacceptable and that the
pain and suffering that results from personal injury should not be
reduced to a monetary value in comparing it to what must be done
to reduce the risk that injury will occur. But that is not the same as
saying that no effort should be made to compare the social benefits
gained by reducing the risk of injury with the social costs, economic
and otherwise, that must be incurred in order to reduce this risk.
Making such a qualitative rather than an economic or quantitative
comparison may be difficult, but being willing to make it is consis-
tent with accepting the principle of optimal deterrence, even while
rejecting an economic conception of that principle.

D. Loss Distribution

Defendants who are held liable in tort actions often do not
shoulder the burden of compensation themselves. Sometimes defen-
dants are covered by liability insurance and the insurer literally
pays the plaintiff on behalf of the policyholder/defendant. On other
occasions even an uninsured defendant may be able to include its
prospective liabilities in the price of the products it sells; or the
defendant may have shareholders whose investments decline in

19
TORT LAW

value as a result of the payment of a liability by the company whose
shares they own. In each of these situations the cost of the loss
suffered by the plaintiff is not simply transferred to the defendant,
but is distributed through the defendant to a larger number of
individuals. Promoting the broad distribution of losses is therefore
often considered one of the functions of tort liability.

Whether loss distribution in itself is a good thing, and even if it
is, whether imposing tort liability is a good way to achieve loss
distribution, are both disputed questions. Suppose you suffer a $500
loss, and the law pays you for that loss by charging $1 to each of
500 people. Unless the sum of the value that each of these individu-
als attaches to the $1 they pay is less than the value you attach to
the $500 you have lost, economically speaking nothing has been
gained by the transfer. There is still a total loss of $500. On the
other hand, when people purchase insurance they are confirming
the notion that losing a small sum for certain (the premium they
pay) is a lesser loss than the low probability of suffering a larger
loss later. This is much like saying that 500 losses of $1 suffered by
500 people do in fact entail less loss than a single loss of $500
suffered by one person. Tort law has long reflected the similar
intuition that, other things being equal, having a large number of
people bear a small loss is better than having a single person bear a
large one. Thus there has been an inclination to develop rules of
law that permit the imposition of tort liability on businesses and
institutions that can distribute their liabilities through the pur-
chase of insurance or by raising the price of their products or
services.

This rationale has some power, but it also has a weakness. The
loss distribution rationale for the imposition of tort liability con-
tains no stopping point. Like the compensation justification for
imposing liability discussed next, loss distribution cannot explain
why tort liability often is not imposed on parties who might, in fact,
be good loss distributors. Moreover, imposing tort liability through
a lawsuit is a cumbersome and expensive mechanism for achieving
loss distribution. Simpler and more broadly applicable insurance
systems (e.g., health insurance, disability insurance, social security)
can broadly distribute losses at lesser cost if that is desired.
Nonetheless, despite the objections that can be leveled at loss
distribution as a rationale for the imposition of tort liability, there
can be no denying that loss distribution has been and is likely to
continue to be one of the effects of the imposition of tort liability.

20
THE NATURE AND FUNCTIONS OF TORT LAW

E. Compensation

It is sometimes said that a function of tort law is to promote
the compensation of those who have suffered injury. For most
analysts of tort law, this is only true in a very limited sense. There
is no doubt that anytime tort liability is imposed, a plaintiff is
awarded compensation. There is also no doubt that, other things
being equal, most of us feel enough natural sympathy for the
victims of injury (especially physical, as opposed to solely economic,
injury) to view the event giving rise to the injury as an appropriate
occasion for considering whether (and how) society might assist the
victim of the injury. And it is probably true that up to a point we
are all better off—because we feel more secure and are therefore
willing to take socially productive risks that we would not other-
wise take—knowing that if we suffer certain kinds of injury, then
compensation for that injury may be forthcoming. If by a ‘‘func-
tion’”’ of tort law we mean a beneficial effect of the imposition of
tort liability, then it is accurate enough to say that providing
compensation to victims is a function of tort law.

But if by the term ‘function’ we mean a ‘‘goal” of tort law,
the notion that providing compensation is a function of tort law is
debatable. The desirability of providing compensation to a particu-
lar class of injury victims rarely explains the lines that are drawn to
distinguish those who are and those who are not entitled to prevail
in a tort claim. Rather, time after time, some other factor or factors
explain the occasion for the imposition of tort liability, or tort law’s
refusal to impose liability. As Holmes put it with characteristically
ruthless clarity over a century ago,

The general principle of our law is that loss from accident

Since the time Holmes wrote, the scope of liability in tort has
expanded substantially, but the principle he expressed still stands.
Liability is not imposed in order to provide compensation to vic-
tims. Rather, victims are provided compensation in order to serve
the other goals of tort law, such as corrective justice and deter-
rence. If it were otherwise then the basis of liability would be the

21
TORT LAW

suffering of misfortune, not the commission of a tort by another.
Since in order to justify the imposition of liability, we require
something in addition to the bare fact that the plaintiff suffered an
injury caused by another party, describing “‘compensation” as one
of the functions of tort liability cannot tell us why or when tort
liability will or will not be imposed. At best, the desirability of
providing compensation will be a factor that, when linked with
others, makes it more likely that there will be tort liability for a
particular category of conduct. And even on that view, providing
compensation under certain circumstances rather than in general is
what is really going on when tort liability is imposed. For that
reason, these ‘‘other circumstances’’—whatever they turn out to
be—are likely to reflect more clearly the actual functions, or goals
of tort liability, than the goal of compensating victims. Compensa-
tion is a good thing when the prerequisites to the imposition of
liability are satisfied, but victims go uncompensated when these
prerequisites are not satisfied.

F. Redress of Social Grievances

Even in situations in which the foregoing rationales for the
imposition of tort liability will not be served or are shown to be
inapt, people sometimes have the sense that tort liability should be
imposed anyway. Of course, one view is that such people are wrong
and that tort liability should never be imposed if it would not
effectively serve one of the functions described above. But another
view is that, even apart from these functions, the right to sue in
tort promotes the redress of social grievances, especially against
large, impersonal institutions. In this sense tort law is a populist
mechanism that permits ordinary people to put authority on trial.
Surely the lawsuits brought in the past involving the Dalkon
Shield, asbestos-related lung disease, and breast-implants exhibit
some of this quality. Future suits may do so as well. Standing
alone, this justification for the imposition of tort liability may not
be strong; but when allied with one or more of the other functions
of tort liability, the possibility that imposing liability on an imper-
sonal institution will help to redress social grievances may well help
to explain why some close cases are decided the way they are.

G. A Mixed System?

A last possibility is that tort law does not perform only a single
function or serve only a single goal, but a set of different functions
whose importance is likely to vary with the situation. Tort law

22
THE NATURE AND FUNCTIONS OF TORT LAW

might thus perform a “mixed” set of functions. In some cases
concern for corrective justice or civil recourse might dominate, but
in others deterrence or concern for loss distribution might be the
key. Or in many instances the imposition of liability might be
justified on both rights-based and instrumental grounds, because it
simultaneously rights a wrong and deters future wrongdoing, for
example. It may even be that, for a doctrine to persist and be
stable, it must serve more than one function or satisfy both rights-
based and instrumental concerns. For those who seek perfect
coherence in a body of law, this may be an unsatisfying state of
affairs. But tort law is a human institution; there is not necessarily
any reason to suppose or even to demand that it be perfectly
coherent.

INTENTIONAL PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL
Harm

It is common to begin studying tort law by considering the
intentional torts of battery and assault. Although only a small
percentage of tort litigation involves these torts, the concepts at
their core as well as the interests they protect are both important
and easy to identify. They are therefore good conceptual building
blocks. Everyone understands the difference between an injury
inflicted on purpose and a mere accident. Cases involving a deliber-
ate punch in the nose typically are therefore fairly simple. As might
be expected, however, more difficult issues often arise in some
intentional tort cases. In addition, two other torts that are close
relatives of the torts of battery and assault—false imprisonment
and intentional infliction of emotional distress—pose interesting
and challenging issues. After considering these four personal injury
torts, we turn to a brief discussion of torts involving intentional
harm to property and their defenses, including a more extended
discussion of the conditional privilege of necessity. Other torts that
are sometimes described as ‘“‘intentional,’’ such as defamation,
invasion of privacy, and fraud, are covered in Chapters 13 and 14.

I. The Personal Injury Torts
A. Battery

Battery involves actual physical contact, whereas assault is the
threat of contact. Technically, a battery is a harmful or offensive
contact with another, resulting from an intention to cause that
contact, or from an intention to put another in apprehension that a
harmful or offensive contact is imminent. Unpacking this definition
reveals each of its features.

1. The Physical Contact Requirement

There must be some physical contact with the plaintiff, or at
least something that is in contact with the plaintiff. Ordinarily this
is direct physical contact between the plaintiff and the defendant.
But the contact may be by some object set in motion by the

24
INTENTIONAL PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL HARM

defendant, such as a weapon, or by some force such as electricity.
In fact, the force need not literally be set in motion by the
defendant, as long as the contact results from the defendant’s
intention. For example, in Garratt v. Dailey,’ the defendant a pulled
chair out from under the plaintiff as she was about to sit down. The
plaintiff was injured when she fell to the ground. Literally speaking
it was the plaintiff who, by attempting to sit down, set in motion
the force that caused her injury. But the harmful contact with the
ground was intended (or at least expected) by the defendant, and
that was sufficient to satisfy this element of the tort. That was as it
should be, since what is at stake in battery is the plaintiff’s interest
in protection of his or her bodily well-being and dignity from
intentional invasion, not merely in avoiding specific methods of
invading that interest.

2. Harmful or Offensive Contact

The contact at issue in battery need not cause actual physical
injury to the plaintiff; an offensive but not harmful contact is
sufficient. What is ‘‘offensive’’ is likely to be context-dependent.
Certainly it would be a jury question, at the least, whether an
unwanted kiss was offensive even if planted politely on the cheek.
And many courts probably would grant a motion for a directed
verdict for the plaintiff on this issue if the circumstances spoke of
sexual harassment rather than romantic excess. Similarly, in most
circumstances a pat on the back is both harmless and inoffensive.
But a pat on the back of a female employee by a male supervisor
whose romantic advances the employee has rejected in the past is
likely to be offensive in context. Any contact that intentionally
interferes with a reasonable sense of personal dignity is offensive.
Of course, a certain amount of touching and jostling is to be
expected in a crowded world, but an ‘‘invasion’’ of bodily autono-
my—a touching without consent—may be offensive even if it is not
physically harmful. The tort protects not only physical security,
but also personal autonomy and dignity.

1. 46 Wash.2d 197, 279 P.2d 1091 (1955).

2. Probably the outer reaches of this concept are reflected in Fisher v. Carrousel
Motor Hotel, Inc., 424 S.W.2d 627 (Tex. 1967), in which the defendant grabbed a
plate from an individual in a buffet line, stating, ‘“a Negro could not be served in the
club.” The plaintiff sued for battery. Although the defendant’s action in that case
was offensive, one might wonder whether it was the contact that took place when
the defendant grabbed the plate that was offensive, or the defendant’s motive in
taking the plate. To put it another way, perhaps it was not the plaintiff's bodily
autonomy that was invaded in that case as much as his integrity as a human being.
That might be another tort, such as intentional infliction of emotional distress, even
if it were not a battery.

25
TORT LAW

Sometimes everything depends on whether the touching in
question is or is not ordinarily to be expected under the circum-
stances. For example, in Vosburg v. Putney,*® the defendant (age
eleven) reached his foot across the aisle of a classroom and either
touched or kicked the plaintiff's leg. The defendant did not intend
to harm the plaintiff, but the contact aggravated an earlier injury.
The court held that the plaintiff could maintain an action for
battery under these circumstances, emphasizing that the defen-
dant’s behavior was a violation of the order and decorum of the
classroom. The court even called the behavior “‘unlawful,’’ by which
it apparently meant “‘inappropriate’’ under the circumstances and
therefore not impliedly consented to by the plaintiff. In reaching
this conclusion, the court distinguished what might be expected in
a classroom—order and decorum without physical contact—from
what might be expected on a school playground, and therefore what
is impliedly consented to in other such settings, including a certain
amount of non-malicious but intentional physical contact.

3. Intent

There can be no battery without the requisite intent on the
part of the defendant. But that intent is not necessarily an intent to
harm. The defendant must intend the contact against which the
law protects the plaintiff, but need not have a malicious intent or
even any understanding that what he is doing is wrongful. Thus, in
Vosburg, the circumstances in which the parties found themselves
(a classroom) gave the plaintiff the right not to be touched by the
defendant. That the defendant intended the touching was suffi-
cient, even though the defendant did not necessarily intend the
touching to be harmful or offensive. The defendant must either
desire to bring about such contact, or act with substantial certainty
(i.e., expect) that the contact will result from his actions. In
Vosburg, for instance, it was substantially certain that the touching
would occur. And in Garrett v. Dailey, there was evidence that the
defendant knew that the plaintiff would make contact with the
ground when he pulled the chair away as she was sitting down. It is
not sufficient, however, for the defendant to know that his action
merely risks harmful or offensive contact if there is no intent to
cause such contact. There must be more than a mere awareness of
risk; awareness of near-certainty is required.

The result of this two-fold approach to intent is that, if the
defendant acts with an intent to cause a harmful or offensive
contact, it does not matter that the probability of harm or offense is
low; liability is imposed if what was intended occurs. On the other

3. 50 N.W. 403 (1891).

26
INTENTIONAL PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL HARM

hand, if the defendant does not intend contact there must be a near
certainty that it will occur. Intent to harm is sufficient, but not
necessary. This makes pretty good, straightforward sense. Acting
with the intent to cause harm or offense is so objectionable that
even when the probability of harm or offense is low the intent
standard is satisfied. But when one does not desire harm or offense
to occur, his conduct is merely risky until he knows that harm or
offense is substantially certain to result from it. Such low-risk
action might constitute some other tort, such as negligence, but it
is not battery, even when the unintended harm occurs.

The intent standard is subjective. The question is whether this
defendant had the requisite state of mind, not what people similarly
situated would have intended under the same circumstances. But it
is important to distinguish the subjective nature of the intent
standard in battery from the objective evidence that might be
employed to prove that the standard was or was not breached.
Truly “‘direct”’ evidence of a defendant’s state of mind usually is
not available, unless the defendant actually has voiced his intention
to cause harm. So the plaintiff's proof often is “external” to the
mind of the defendant and therefore is only ‘circumstantial’
evidence of intent. That is, the jury is permitted to infer that the
defendant did or did not-intend the harm at issue from the
surrounding circumstances. The jury must determine the likely
internal, subjective state of mind of the defendant based on the
objective, or at least external, facts. What facts were staring the
defendant in the face? What is his explanation for the action he
took? What was the history of relations between plaintiff and
defendant? Answers to these and similar questions are the typical
basis for the jury’s decision about the defendant’s subjective state
of mind.

Why is there liability not only when the defendant desired to
cause harm, but also when he knew that harm was substantially
certain to occur? Surely part of the answer is obvious: ordinarily,
acting in the face of knowledge that one’s act is substantially
certain to cause harm is only slightly less morally objectionable
than acting with the desire to cause harm. In addition, however,
the difficulty of proving the defendant’s state of mind directly also
helps to explain the substantial-certainty basis for battery liability.
A defendant who acted with substantial certainty that harm would
result from his act will very often have desired this harm to occur.
It is the rare, though not unheard of case in which a defendant
knows that he is very likely to cause harm but does not desire that
harm to occur. Why else act if one knows that what he is doing will
very likely harm someone? Only when the defendant had some

27
TORT LAW

other end in view, and the harm that would almost certainly occur
as a result was a mere side effect of achieving that end, will the
defendant have acted with substantial certainty yet not intended
the harm (e.g., shooting at a target with a crowd of people standing
near it). For this reason, often it will be valid to infer intent to
cause harm from evidence that the defendant knew that harm was
substantially certain to occur. However, what the defendant knew
often can be more reliably proved than what the defendant intend-
ed. So the awareness-of-substantial-certainty basis for battery lia-
bility is in this sense not merely an independent basis for liability,
but also a surrogate for proof of the intent to bring about harm.

The intent standard is double-barrelled in another way as well.
The standard is satisfied when the defendant intends to cause an
offensive contact but a harmful contact results, as well as when he
intends to cause a harmful contact but an offensive contact results.
A number of justifications can be offered for this approach. One
justification is that the underlying wrong is the intention to invade
another person’s bodily integrity, and that both harmful and offen-
sive contacts are simply different consequences of this same under-
lying wrong. A second justification is that each form of contact is
sufficiently likely to result from an intent to cause the other that
an act intended to cause one form of contact should be regarded as
intended also to cause the other. Still another justification (though
only for one-half of the approach) is that all intentionally harmful
contact is also offensive; intention to cause harm therefore is
necessarily intention to cause offense. And a final justification is
that it is sometimes difficult for the plaintiff to prove which form of
contact the defendant intended, even though the plaintiff can prove
that the defendant definitely intended one or the other. If the
defendant brings a dog to the home of a person whom he knows has
a phobia about being bitten and the dog jumps on that person, it
should not matter whether the defendant intended a harmful
contact or “‘merely” an offensive one. The consequence of requiring
proof of the kind of contact the defendant intended would be that
sometimes the defendant would avoid liability for tortious contact,
because of the difficulty of determining which form of tortious
contact he intended. It would be odd, for example, if the defendant
who intended harmful contact could avoid liability for an offensive

contact on the ground that he had intended something possibly
worse than what actually occurred.

4. Transferred Intent

A fourth feature of the definition of a battery also relates to the
intent standard. Although the defendant must intend a harmful or

28
INTENTIONAL PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL HARM

offensive contact with another person, the individual who actually
suffers the contact need not be the person whom the defendant
intended to harm or offend. This rule is known as the doctrine of
transferred intent. The core explanation for this doctrine is that the
defendant’s conduct is so blameworthy that it would be inappropri-
ate to allow him to escape liability on the ground that he did not
harm or offend the particular person he intended to harm or offend.
But practical problems of proof also play a role in supporting the
doctrine. The doctrine does not simply apply to the clear case in
which the defendant’s intentions were directed at A, but B was
injured. Rather, sometimes a plaintiff will easily be able to prove
that the defendant intended harm to someone, or acted with
knowledge that harm to someone was substantially certain to occur,
but the plaintiff will be unable to prove precisely to whom. Sup-
pose, for example, that a defendant surreptitiously disposes of
hazardous waste in a community’s water supply. If the defendant
must intend harm to a particular individual or particular group of
individuals, then there will be no liability for battery under these
circumstances. The doctrine of transferred intent solves this prob-
lem, by making the identity of the particular target of the defen-
dant’s intentions irrelevant.

B. Assault

An assault occurs when the defendant, intending either to
cause a battery, or to threaten one, puts the plaintiff in fear of an
imminent harmful or offensive contact (i.e., of suffering a battery).
In contrast to battery, the interest protected in assault is the
plaintiff's mental peace, rather than her physical well-being and
bodily autonomy. The operative word in the definition of assault is
“apprehension” of imminent harmful or offensive contact. Al-
though typically the plaintiff ‘‘fears’”’ imminent conduct, fear is not
required. Rather, only “‘anticipation’’ of such contact is required,
for even anticipation of a battery without fear of it substantially
disturbs one’s mental peace.

The elements of assault are virtually identical to those of
battery, except that there is no requirement of actual contact with
the plaintiff's person. In fact, virtually every battery is also an
assault, since normally the plaintiff is first put in apprehension of
imminent physical contact, and then suffers the contact. The con-
verse, of course, is not true. Sometimes an assault is only an
assault, either because it was intended only as an assault, or
because it was an attempted battery that missed.

29
TORT LAW

Aside from the issues that also arise in battery (such as the
meaning of intent and offensiveness), there are two key issues in
assault. The first issue is how close to consummation a threat of
contact must be in order to constitute an assault. The answer, not
entirely helpful standing alone, is that the harm threatened must
be ‘imminent.’ The cases make clear, however, that imminent
means a number of things. The threat must be immediate in terms
of time: a statement by the defendant that he is going home to get
his rifle and will return to kill the plaintiff is not an assault. The
threat also must be close in terms of space: a threat made over the
telephone is not an assault. And the threat must be actual rather
than potential. The defendant’s statement that “If I were a violent
man I would tear your eyes out”’ is not an assault.

These requirements make sense on several grounds. The idea
behind assault is to protect the mental peace that is breached when
one is about to suffer a battery. Talk is cheap; until the plaintiff
faces immediate action by the defendant his concern is about a
battery that might take place in the future, not a battery that is
about to take place now. In addition, until a battery is in fact
imminent, the defendant’s intention and therefore the amount of
blame that should be ascribed to him for contemplating invading
the plaintiff's person is uncertain. Imminence strengthens the
inference of the defendant’s intent. Finally, the courts could have
their hands full with all manner of claims if there were liability not
only for the mental suffering caused by the imminent threat of
battery, but for concern over potential future battery as well.

A second issue that arises distinctively in assault involves the
extra-sensitive plaintiff. Some people are of course more sensitive
than others. Ordinarily there is no liability for the making of
threats that would not satisfy the demands of the tort of assault if
made to a typical person, even if the extra-sensitive plaintiff did
actually regard a battery as imminent. Imposing liability for con-
duct that the defendant could not reasonably have understood to be
tortious would deter conduct that would not ordinarily be tortious.
The rationale for this limitation on liability for assault, however,
also suggests its own exception. Once the defendant knows of the
plaintiff's extra-sensitivity, the reason for declining to impose liabil-
ity for threats of battery that fall just short of imminent disappears.
Because in this situation the defendant knows the effect his threat
will have on the plaintiff, he has the requisite intent to put the
plaintiff in apprehension of imminent harm, even if the ordinary
person would not feel such apprehension.

C. False Imprisonment and Intentional Infliction of
Emotional Distress

These two torts, the first established for centuries and the
second of more recent vintage, are worth discussion not only in
their own right, but also because of what they illustrate about the
nature of legal rules more generally. These torts reveal that at
times the desirability of expanding the degree of protection afforded
by the law of torts is in tension with the need for easily administra-
ble rules governing the scope of liability. A choice must often be
made about the mix of predictability of outcome and flexibility of
application that should be combined in a particular rule.

1. False Imprisonment

Battery and assault do not protect against all intentional
interferences with physical well-being and autonomy, because they
require either physical contact or apprehension of it. Early on it
was recognized that one particular form of interference that does
not involve contact or apprehension is nonetheless sufficiently
objectionable to be made actionable in tort. The essence of this tort
of ‘false’? (in the sense of “unjustified’’?) imprisonment is the
restriction of the plaintiff's freedom of movement, not harmful or
offensive contact. To be actionable, a confinement must be total—
forcing the plaintiff to take the long way around in order to reach a
desired destination is not sufficient to constitute imprisonment. But
giving him no way out of where he is, even no way out of a large
space, constitutes the necessary confinement. Keeping an individual
in a closed room, physically barring his only way out, or detaining
an individual in a retail store by threat of force each may constitute
false imprisonment.

Note the interests that the tort of false imprisonment does and
does not protect. The tort is narrowly tailored to meet a particular
need—the failure of the torts of assault and battery to remedy a
different, discrete form of interference with bodily autonomy. The
cause of action is specifically and exclusively for false imprison-
ment, not a general claim for intentional interference with bodily
autonomy. In fashioning the cause of action to deal with this one
problem alone, the courts have been able over time to develop
rather specific rules about what does and does not satisfy the
elements of the tort. Thus, total confinement rather than partial
confinement is required; generally the plaintiff must have conscious
awareness of the confinement; and the restraint on the plaintiff's
freedom must be intentional, but physical force is not necessary if

31
TORT LAW

there is a threat of force. Although these requirements are not self-
applying and leave some room for judgment, often they enable the
courts to determine as a matter of law whether a valid claim exists.
The result is a substantial amount of predictability that can help
potential litigants sort out by themselves the cases that should and
should not be brought or defended. Instead of operating under a
rather general cause of action which is likely to send most ques-
tions to the jury, potential litigants can understand in advance the
limits of what is actionable, and make decisions about whether to
institute a claim and whether to defend against or settle it.

This predictability is achieved, however, by limiting the discre-
tion of the trial courts and juries to determine, on a case-by-case
basis, which intentional interferences with bodily autonomy should
be actionable. That decision has already been made at a “‘high level
of generality”: assaults, batteries, and false imprisonments. Any
other form of intentional interference with bodily autonomy that
does not fall within one of these categories is unlikely to be
actionable, no matter how unsavory the defendant’s conduct or how
deserving the plaintiff. Denying liability to the occasional sympa-
thetic plaintiff who has clearly been wronged, but by conduct that
is not quite assault, battery, or false imprisonment, is just the cost
of having rules, whose very purpose is to draw lines between
situations that are and are not actionable. Sometimes a case simply
falls a hair short of being within one of the actionable categories.

This bright-line approach becomes less and less tolerable, how-
ever, as the number of instances in which there is need for more
flexibility increases. Then the predictability tail seems to be wag-
ging the justice dog. This is a generic problem in the formulation of
legal rules. For this reason, the pattern of development that oc-
curred next is also common.

2. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress

A common pattern of legal development was taken by what has
now become the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress.
The courts began to be presented with a cluster of cases that fell
outside the existing three categories of actionable intentional inter-
ference with bodily autonomy, but that had certain common fea-
tures. Although in these cases there was no physical contact, no
threat of contact, and no confinement, in each case the defendant
had acted in a manner that was intended to interfere severely with
the plaintiff's peace of mind. At first the defendants were innkeep-
ers or common carriers, who it was said were under a ‘‘contractual’’
obligation not to engage in such conduct. But eventually the con-
tractual prerequisite disappeared, and defendants of all sorts were

82
INTENTIONAL PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL HARM

subjected to liability for what later came to be recognized as the
tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress.

It is no surprise that even before the tort had a name, the cases
in which the courts first felt compelled to permit the imposition of
liability involved extremely outrageous conduct by the defendant.
For example, malicious practical jokes, such as a false story that the
plaintiffs husband had been grievously injured, were typical of the
cases in which the courts felt justified in imposing liability. In such
cases the defendant had not merely intended to distress the plain-
tiff, but also had gone beyond the reasonable bounds of decency in
doing so. The courts were understandably concerned, however, that
they might be opening a Pandora’s box in authorizing a general
cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Such
a cause of action could have created a potentially unlimited expan-
sion of litigation over the kind of unmannerly conduct that, while
distressing, is only too common and therefore to be expected by
almost anyone who has social or commercial relations with other
people. An unbounded tort of intentional infliction of emotional
distress would also have risked fraudulent claims by those who had
merely been insulted or aggravated rather than truly and deeply
distressed.

The result was that the extreme outrageousness of the defen-
dant’s conduct and the severity of the plaintiff’s distress that were
characteristic of the early cases became elements of the tort itself.
These requirements help to satisfy the two concerns that would
otherwise be troubling about the tort. Because only extraordinary
instances of misbehavior satisfy this requirement, there is no
chance that liability will be radically expanded; and because this
kind of misbehavior is more likely than ordinary rudeness to cause
severe emotional distress, the requirements of extreme outrageous-
ness and severe distress tend to reduce the risk of fraudulent
claims. The cause of action has been held to apply in a variety of
circumstances, including the malicious practical jokes that gave rise
to it, but also harassment by debt collectors and child sexual abuse
by clergy. A few courts have even relaxed the requirement that the
plaintiff be present when the infliction occurs, thereby permitting
the parents of children who were the subject of such abuse to
maintain actions for intentional infliction along with their children.
But the U.S. Supreme Court has held that there are constitutional
limits, based on the First Amendment right to freedom of expres-
sion, on the scope of the cause of action in suits by public officials
and public figures.'

41 (1988).

33
TORT LAW

For the most part, however, the requirements of extreme
outrageousness and severity of distress have limited the instances
in which liability is imposed. The result has been that cases
involving spousal abuse and workplace sexual harassment, which
might otherwise have been expected to be areas of significant
increases in liability—because of seemingly greater social sensitivity
to these abuses and greater awareness of them—have not been a
proving ground for expansion of the tort.”

3. Some Observations about the
Nature of these Legal Rules

The development of the tort of intentional infliction of emo-
tional distress can tell us something more generally about the
nature of legal rules. The very concept of a rule implies a division—
a line—between the situations in which liability is imposed and
those in which it is not. When rules govern, some fact situations fall
squarely within the confines of a tort, such as battery, assault, or
false imprisonment, and some situations fall outside those confines.
When a situation falls far outside those confines, typically there is
no reason for concern. But when a sympathetic fact situation falls
just outside the confines of an established cause of action, the
courts sometimes are inclined to create an exception to the rule
that will make that fact situation actionable.

There is nothing necessarily right or wrong about this tenden-
cy. The prior rule may have been too limited, and the combination
of that rule plus the exception—in effect a new, broader rule—may
be just right. But a rule is not a rule if it does not have limits. If
any situation that falls just outside the confines of the rule may
nonetheless be made the subject of a new exception, then the rule is
infinitely malleable and infinitely expandable, and in effect is no
rule at all. That is not what happened in the development of the
tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress. Rather, a few
cases that were not quite battery, not quite assault, and not quite
false imprisonment were held to be actionable, and then a new rule
governing a new tort emerged, based on the common characteristics
of that narrow class of cases and subject to its own limits.

Things might have developed otherwise. Instead of fashioning a
new but carefully circumscribed rule to fit the new, actionable fact
situations, the courts might have decided that in actuality a whole
series of hard-to-specify wrongs ought to be actionable, including
but not limited to battery, assault, false imprisonment, and inten-

GENDER, AND Tort Law 64-87 (2010).

34
INTENTIONAL PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL HARM

tional infliction of emotional distress. The courts might then have
dispensed with the use of rules to determine which such wrongs
were actionable, and instead could have employed what have been
called standards—less specific principles that could loosely guide
decisions about what was actionable but that would have been too
indefinite to decide particular cases. For example, the standard
might have reflected the putative tort of “wrongful and intentional
interference with personal autonomy or dignity,’’ but left the courts
and juries in particular cases to decide which such intentional
interferences would be actionable. Eventually more specific guide-
lines, very much resembling rules, might have emerged; or perhaps
it simply would have been left to juries to decide what was action-
able, on a case-by-case basis. Things never developed that way,
however, and the intentional injury torts remain governed largely
by rules and not standards.

In practice, the distinction between rules and standards is
sometimes less firm than I have described it. No rule is perfectly
specific and no standard is entirely indefinite. The distinction
between the two kinds of legal ‘“‘norms”’ is a matter of degree. The
closer a legal norm comes to the rule side of the spectrum, the more
predictable the application of the norm to any particular fact
situation is likely to be. The cost of such predictability, however, is
the relative incapacity of the norm to accommodate situations that
do not qualify according to the norm’s strict limits. Conversely, the
closer a norm comes to the standard side of the spectrum, the less
predictable its application will be, but the more discretion decision-
makers will have to distinguish between situations that are and are
not actionable. At one extreme lie rules with highly predictable
applications and very little flexibility. At the other extreme lie
standards that afford enormous discretion and whose application is
very difficult to predict. In between lie most of the actual rules of
tort law.

II. Defenses

Even after the plaintiff in a tort case proves a prima facie
case—i.e., submits evidence supporting each element of his or her
case—the defendant may avoid liability by making out a defense to
liability. In connection with the four personal injury intentional
torts, most of these defenses fall into the category of ‘‘privileges’’—
that is, actions taken under circumstances that justify or excuse
what would otherwise be tortious. Although there are a number of
defenses, the main ones are consent (which technically is not a
privilege) and the privileges of self-defense and defense of others.

35
TORT LAW

Another privilege—‘‘necessity’’—is discussed later in this Chapter,
in connection with intentional injury to property.

A. Consent

If the plaintiff has consented to conduct by the defendant that
would otherwise be tortious, an essential element of the plaintiffs
case is missing, because the defendant’s conduct is not wrongful. As
the Latin phrase volenti non fit injuria indicates, ‘“‘he who consents
is not injured.’ For example, an intentional touching by the defen-
dant to which the plaintiff consented is not a wrong at all. Ordi-
narily the plaintiff can make out a prima facie case without making
reference to consent. Procedurally, therefore, consent is a defense
in the sense that the defendant is the party who typically raises the
issue and bears the burden of proving it. Naturally there are often
questions of fact regarding the existence of consent. Some questions
are purely factual—what did the defendant say, what did the
plaintiff reply? Other questions are interpretive, since consent may
be not only express but also apparent or implied—what physical
contacts does a person playing touch-football or someone taken
unconscious to an emergency room impliedly consent to? And in
other situations nominal consent has been given, but is not legally
effective because there was fraud, duress, certain forms of mistake,
or the legal incapacity of the plaintiff to give consent.

Even when consent has been given, the defense does not apply
when the scope of the consent is exceeded. For example, in Mohr v.
Williams,° the plaintiff consented to have the defendant surgeon
perform an operation on her right ear. While the plaintiff was
under anesthesia, the defendant examined both ears, and decided
that the condition of the plaintiff's right ear was less serious than
expected and that the left ear required surgery. He therefore
operated on the left ear. The plaintiff sued for battery. On appeal,
the court held that plaintiff's consent to an operation, and indeed
an operation on her right ear, did not constitute consent to an
operation on her left ear. The defendant had therefore exceeded the
scope of the plaintiff's consent and was liable for a battery.

One of the most vexing problems regarding consent involves
inter-subjectivity. Consent must be communicated, but communica-
tion sometimes misfires. An uncommunicated consent, if there
could be such a thing, probably is a defense. But what about the
situation in which the plaintiff has not consented but the defendant
incorrectly, yet honestly, believes that the plaintiff did consent?

6. 95 Minn. 261, 104 N.W. 12 (1905).

36
INTENTIONAL PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL HARM

Often cases involving sexual conduct or misconduct such as alleged
‘“‘date rape’’ raise such issues. These issues are highly charged, but
they cannot be avoided in a discussion of consent simply because
they are controversial.

The traditional rule holds that the defendant cannot escape
liability merely by honestly believing that there was consent, but
must have “‘reasonably relied’”’ on a manifestation of consent by the
plaintiff. For example, suppose that the defendant John suggests,
after a certain amount of physical intimacy with the plaintiff Jean,
that they engage in sexual intercourse. The plaintiff then says, ‘‘Oh
John, I love you but I don’t know if I want to,” after which she
simply freezes up and says nothing more. They then have sexual
intercourse. The plaintiff sues for battery, and the defendant alleg-
es consent.

Under the traditional approach it probably would be a question
of fact whether this constituted sufficient manifestation of consent
on which the defendant could reasonably rely. But even determin-
ing whether the defendant has submitted enough evidence to make
the defense of consent a jury question is highly situation-depen-
dent. Whether the defendant could reasonably have understood the
words “‘I love you but I don’t know if I want to” as consent depends
very much on how the plaintiff and defendant had communicated in
the past, and on how they had interpreted facially ambiguous
statements about their intentions, such as “I don’t know.”’ If the
plaintiff and defendant had little or no history of communication
that could help to resolve the issue, then whether the defendant
could reasonably have understood the plaintiff to be consenting
might depend on prevailing cultural norms regarding consent to
sexual contact. And if the plaintiff and the defendant came from
settings in which these norms differed, then the traditional ap-
proach might well permit a jury to find that the defendant reason-
ably believed that there was consent, even though the plaintiff was,
in effect, communicating one message (‘‘I do not consent’’) and the
defendant was hearing another (‘I do not object’). The very
formulation of the consent defense in these reasonable-reliance
terms means that sometimes there is no liability even when the
plaintiff did not in fact intend to consent, as long as some people
would reasonably have understood her to have consented. The
traditional approach might therefore be regarded as being some-
what pro-defendant, which in most sexual offense cases will trans-
late into “‘pro-male.”’

On the other hand, it would be possible for the law to take the
position that unless there has been an express, affirmative consent
by the plaintiff, the defendant can never have reasonably relied.

37
TORT LAW

Then the message ‘I do not object’’—even assuming that ‘“‘T just
don’t know’ could reasonably be understood to mean “I do not
object”—normally would not count as affirmative consent: not
objecting is not the same as consenting. This approach would
emphasize the plaintiff’s state of mind rather than the defendant’s.
The question would not be whether the defendant reasonably
relied, but whether the plaintiff actually consented. However, al-
though the ultimate issue under this formulation of the defense
would be the plaintiff's state of mind, often the only evidence of
this state of mind aside from the plaintiff's own subsequent asser-
tions would be her words and actions at the time. As a consequence,
for practical purposes the issue in such cases often still would be
whether, objectively speaking, those words and actions actually
constituted consent.

There is room for some variation under this alternative ap-
proach. On the one hand, the approach could be formulated so as to
be nearly identical to the traditional approach—directing the jury
to determine whether the plaintiff consented by asking how a
reasonable person would have understood the plaintiff's words and
actions. On the other hand, the defense could be formulated so as
to be noticeably less pro-defendant than the traditional approach,
by instructing the jury that the consent defense must be rejected
unless there was an actual, affirmative indication of consent by the
plaintiff. Under this formulation the consent defense is less likely

to prevail even when some people would have believed that there
was consent.

It is worth remembering, however, that except in the unusual
case in which the court could rule that there was no consent as a
matter of law, the legal differences between these formulations will
be reflected mainly in the language in which instructions are given
to the jury. Under any of these formulations, whether there was
consent is very likely to raise a jury question, since even under the
alternative to the traditional approach the defendant will contend
that the plaintiff's words or gestures should be interpreted as an
express affirmative consent. The outcome of claims involving un-
wanted sexual behavior will therefore still depend more on the
values and experiences of the members of the jury than on the
subtleties of the particular instructions read to them by the trial
judge. Jurors who believe that a woman who does not say ‘“‘yes” in
one way or another to a male sexual overture has not consented to
it are less likely to find consent under these circumstances than
jurors who believe that a woman who does not affirmatively object
to male sexual pressures impliedly consents to them.

INTENTIONAL PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL HARM

B. Self-Defense and Defense of Others

The defenses of self-defense and the defense of others are
known as “privileges;” that is, they afford the defendant the
privilege of causing what would otherwise be tortious harm to the
plaintiff, in order to prevent himself or others from suffering such
harm. To be entitled to engage in self-defense or the defense of
another, the defendant must reasonably believe that the use of
physical force is necessary to prevent or repel an impending attack
or imprisonment. Thus, when there would actually have been no
attack, the defendant can avoid liability for a mistaken belief that
an attack was about to occur, or was occurring, only if that mistake
was reasonable. What constitutes a reasonable belief that an attack
is likely to occur can be highly situation-sensitive. A person who
feigns a threat against someone whom he knows to be unusually
nervous because of a recent mugging risks a privileged effort at
self-defense by the person threatened, even though self-defense
might not be privileged under otherwise similar circumstances.

Although the use of reasonable force in defense of oneself or
others is privileged, if the defendant exceeds the scope of the
privilege he is liable for injury caused by the use of unreasonable
means or excessive force. Commonly the defendant has been re-
quired to make a split-second decision about the need for defense
and the amount of force to use, however, and as a consequence the
jury is likely to afford considerable leeway when the defendant or
the person he was protecting was actually at risk of serious harm
by the plaintiff. The only important limitation on the jury’s discre-
tion in this regard is the “‘equivalence”’ rule: if there is a threat of
death or serious bodily harm, then the defendant is privileged to
defend himself or another with an equivalent amount of force; but
if the threat is of lesser harm, then lesser force must be used in
defense or the privilege is lost. Sometimes it is also said that if
there is a means of escape or retreat, the use of force in defense is
not privileged, except in one’s home. Probably it is more accurate,
however, to say that on some occasions discretion is the better part
of valor, and that the jury’s decision whether the defendant used a
reasonable amount of force in defense may take into account both
whether there was an avenue of escape or retreat, and whether it
would have been reasonable under all the circumstances to have
chosen escape or retreat rather than defense.

A number of the issues relating to defense of self and others
are similar to those that arise in connection with the consent
defense. In each situation the plaintiff communicates something to

39
TORT LAW

the defendant (an alleged threat or an alleged consent, respectively)
that the defendant later claims authorizes or justifies the taking of
an action that would otherwise be tortious. In each case it is
possible that the defendant has misunderstood that communication,
mistakenly believing that there is a threat of an immediate attack
or that there has been consent. In each case the law is that a
subjectively honest but unreasonable mistake is no defense, but
that an objectively reasonable and honest mistake does excuse what
would otherwise be tortious. If the typical, reasonable person would
have believed she was under attack or that the other party had
consented to be touched, then the law permits a defense despite the
mistake, but otherwise not. Finally, even when inflicting harm that
would otherwise be tortious is authorized, the law places limits on
the amount of force that may be used, depending on the scope of
the consent or the severity of the threatened attack.

Ill. The Property Torts

There are three torts concerned with intentional injury to
property: trespass to land, trespass to personal property, and con-
version.

A. The Nature of the Torts

The two forms of trespass are just what they appear to be:
wrongs in which the defendant breaches the boundary of or touches
the plaintiff's real or personal property, or otherwise physically
interferes with the plaintiff's right of possession, which includes the
right to exclude others from occupying or using that property. The
defendant need not have intended to trespass, but only to have
intended to be present on or interfere with the possession of
property that turns out to be owned by the plaintiff. Trespass is
actionable without proof of actual damage, although in modern
times it would be highly unusual to bring a trespass action only as
a matter of principle. In contrast to trespass, in which the defen-
dant himself interferes with the plaintiffs right of possession, the
defendant in conversion typically has undertaken the unauthorized
transfer of the plaintiff's personal property to a third party’s
possession. The essence of all three of these torts is interference
with the plaintiff’s right to possess and control his or her property.
The situations to which the torts apply run all the way from
traditional trespass to land to damage to, and sometimes even
interference with, a computer or network by spam or spyware.

Although the concern with bodily autonomy that characterizes
the personal injury torts is not present here, it would be a mistake

40
INTENTIONAL PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL HARM

to suppose that the property torts are concerned only with mone-
tary loss resulting from damage to property. On the contrary, while
few such tort actions would be brought unless there were monetary
damage, often more is at stake than money alone. Property owner-
ship is not merely an economic but also a personal right. The way
people live their lives may be influenced, sometimes even protected
by, their property. Think of people who live on rural tracts of land
to obtain privacy and solitude, or derive great pleasure from unique
paintings or sculpture. Interference with the rights of possession
and ownership of such property, especially intentional interference,
is likely to engender indignation or outrage. This is true even of
inanimate property, but is even more true of household pets, which
the law also treats as property. The person whose property is
trespassed upon or whose pet is intentionally harmed typically feels
personally invaded. Sometimes there is no way to completely sepa-
rate these intangible losses from the more easily measured mone-
tary losses that may be the result of trespass or conversion. At one
level the law proceeds as if these intangible losses are irrelevant;
but there can be little doubt that in some cases both courts and
juries take these losses into consideration.

B. Defenses: Especially The Privilege of ‘‘Necessity”’

A series of related privileges may serve as defenses to actions
for trespass and, occasionally, conversion. These include public or
private necessity, defense of property, recapture of chattels, recap-
ture of land, and action in pursuance of legal process. Necessity is
by far the most important privilege for our purposes, however,
since this defense raises issues that can help us make a conceptual
transition from the intentional torts to those involving negligence
and strict liability.

In a sense, all the privileges that serve as defenses to liability
for intentional harm to persons or property are based on necessity,
broadly conceived. But the technical term necessity is reserved for
those cases in which the defendant has acted reasonably in damag-
ing or destroying the plaintiff's property in order to avoid harm to
himself or his property, but the risk of harm to the plaintiff has not
been created by the plaintiff. In contrast, when such privileges as
self-defense, defense of others, or defense of property are invoked,
the risk of harm has been created by the plaintiff.

Two forms of necessity must be distinguished. Cases of public
necessity arise when there is a risk to the property of a sufficiently
large number of people to make the risk “‘public”’ and that risk can
be reduced or eliminated by damaging or destroying the property of

41
TORT LAW

the plaintiff. For example, the plaintiff's house may be torn down
in order to prevent the spread of a fire to the remainder of a town.
In cases of public necessity the privilege is ‘‘absolute;’’ that is, the
privilege of necessity is a complete defense to liability. The defen-
dant has the right to make use of the plaintiff's property without
incurring liability for damage that results. And because the defen-
dant possesses an absolute privilege, the plaintiff does not have the
right to prevent him from using the plaintiffs property. We will
return briefly to public necessity at the end of this Chapter.

In contrast, cases of private necessity arise when there is a risk
to one party or his property only, and this party can reduce or
eliminate that risk by damaging or destroying someone else’s
property. In such cases the privilege of necessity is said to be
“qualified” or “‘conditional.”’ Because the privilege is only qualified
rather than absolute, the defendant is liable to the plaintiff for the
damage done to the latter’s property. That is, the privilege is
conditioned on the privileged party’s later compensating the other
party for using the latter’s property.

1. Ploof and Vincent: The Basics

These principles are illustrated by two celebrated cases. In
Ploof v. Putnam,' the plaintiffs were sailing on Lake Champlain
when a sudden storm forced them to tie up at the defendant’s dock.
The defendant then had his servant untie the ship, as a result of
which the boat and its contents were destroyed and the plaintiffs
were injured. The court held that the privilege of necessity had
entitled the plaintiffs to tie up at the defendant’s dock. Because
doing so therefore did not constitute a trespass, the defendant did
not have the right to exclude them from the dock. Some might say
that having the plaintiffs untied in effect “‘trespassed’’ on the
plaintiffs “property.” That is, private necessity afforded the plain-
tiffs what amounted to a limited property interest in the defen-
dant’s dock (the right to tie up for the duration of the storm), with
which the defendant had interfered. The defendant therefore was
liable to the plaintiffs for the harm that ensued when they were
untied.

Two years later, in Vincent v. Lake Erie Transportation Co.,®
the defendant’s ship had been unloading at the plaintiff's dock
when a storm arose. By the time the unloading was completed it
would have been dangerous to venture out into the storm, so the
ship remained moored to the dock. As the mooring lines parted or

42
INTENTIONAL PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL HARM

chafed they were replaced. The plaintiff sued for the damage that
resulted from the buffeting of the ship against the dock during the
storm. The defendant argued that because it would have been
negligent, perhaps even foolhardy, to untie the ship from the dock
because of the risk to life and the ship, it should not be liable for
the damage to the dock. But the court disagreed, holding that the
defendant had a conditional privilege only. Although the defendant
had done nothing wrong, it had saved the ship at the expense of the
dock and was liable for the damage that resulted.

2. The Property Rights Explanation

The notion that because the defendant in Vincent used the
plaintiff's property it should bear liability may seem appealing on
the surface, but is it persuasive? After all, the defendant behaved
responsibly, and the plaintiff should have felt a moral obligation to
make the dock available during the storm. A world in which people
do not expect compensation for helping others would be attractive.
On the other hand, to say that the defendant did nothing wrong
and that the plaintiff had a moral obligation to provide assistance is
simply another way of saying that the defendant had the privilege
of staying moored to the dock and that the plaintiff therefore had
no right to exclude the defendant in an emergency. As the court put
it, “the ordinary rules regulating property rights were suspended
by forces beyond human control * * *’’. However, the whole point
of the conditional privilege, it can be argued, is that when such
property rights are suspended and the defendant is privileged to
use the plaintiff's property, the defendant is obligated to pay for
any damage that results.

But why? It may seem self-evident that if I use someone else’s
property, I should pay for doing so. If that were the principle
underlying Vincent, however, then the defendant should be liable
only for the rental value of the dock for the period in question,
since this was what he was entitled to use without needing permis-
sion. This was not a case, that is, in which a starving man has a
privilege to enter a cabin in the woods and open canned goods for
food, as long as he pays for the food. The defendant in Vincent did
not choose to consume or to damage the dock, but only to risk
damaging it.

The explanation for the law’s refusal to credit this distinction
between intending harm and merely risking it could be that the
risk in Vincent was sufficiently high that it was so nearly tanta-
mount to intentionally damaging the dock as to bring it within the
confines of the rule governing conditional privilege. After all, we
choose to risk damaging other people’s property all the time, yet

43
TORT LAW

are usually held liable for damage that actually occurs only if it was
negligent to take the risk. For example, I create a risk of non-
negligently damaging nearby property when I drive to work, since I
may have a tire blowout that causes my car to run off the road and
damage a neighbor’s house. But the risk is very low. I am therefore
liable for such damage only if I have been negligent. In contrast, in
Vincent the risk must have been high, or the case would in fact
more closely resemble my driving to work. Moreover, the fact that
as the mooring ropes parted or chafed the defendant replaced them
highlights both the element of choice made by the defendant and
the apparently high probability of harming the dock. In fact, some
commentators understand the court’s reference to the re-mooring
as a holding that the defendant knew that it was harming the dock.

But the question why liability is imposed remains. A perfectly
respectable answer is simply that, as between two innocent parties,
the one whom nature put at risk should bear the cost of saving
himself or his property, rather than the owner of the property that

does the saving. For many people that is a sufficiently persuasive
answer to end the inquiry.

The trouble with this answer is that if both parties are inno-
cent—i.e., neither was negligent—then the conditional privilege
rule looks more like a way to break the moral tie between the
parties than a method of achieving corrective justice. It will not do
to argue that the shipowner made a choice to risk the dock, but
that the dockowner made no such choice. After all, the dockowner
chose to have a dock where ships might tie up when storms arose.
Until we know what legal rule governs the rights of ship and dock
owners, we cannot make assertions about what they did and did not
‘“‘choose”’ to risk. This is an important point, for it reflects the fact
that legal rules not only honor expectations of safety; sometimes
expectations of safety are derived from legal rules about when there
is liability. In such situations the decision about what legal rule to
have is in essence a decision about what expectations to create.

For example, if the governing rule were that the dockowner
cannot recover from the shipowner unless the shipowner was
negligent in staying moored to the dock, then the dockowner could
be said to have ‘‘chosen”’ to risk being non-negligently damaged by
ships moored to the dock during storms. We cannot deduce the
scope of the dockowner’s tort rights from the applicable property
rights, because what we are determining is the scope of the ‘“‘prop-
erty” rights a tort liability rule should or should not give the
dockowner. One of these rights, though only one, involves the
dockowner’s possible right of recovery for damage resulting from
ships moored during storms. The dockowner’s right in this regard

44
INTENTIONAL PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL HARM

might be the broad one afforded by Vincent, or it might be a
narrower one that would make the shipowner liable for damage
only when it was caused by the shipowner’s negligence.

Thus, the scope of the dockowner’s property rights does not
determine the appropriate tort liability rule; rather, the appropriate
tort liability rule determines the scope of the dockowner’s property
rights. To put it another way, the dockowner’s property rights do
not come to us already established and independent of the tort
liability issue. On the contrary, what is at issue is the scope of those
rights. One way to understand this is to imagine how things would
change if the shipowner were not liable in the Vincent situation.
Then the risk to dockowners would rise, and the risk to shipowners
would fall. Presumably docks would be worth slightly less than they
would otherwise be (since owning a dock would entail one less
“yight’’) and ships would be worth slightly more than they would
otherwise be (since owning a ship would entail one more “‘right’’).

When the issue is understood in this light, the question is
whether there is some moral or other basis for favoring dockowners
over shipowners, or vice versa. We might say that when we talk in
ordinary language about property ‘“‘ownership,”’ we include in that
notion the right not to have the safety of our property consciously
and deliberately risked by others. As Blackstone said long ago,
“There is nothing which so generally strikes the imagination and
engages the affections of mankind, as the right of property or that
sole and despotic dominion which one man claims and exercises
over the external things of the world, in total exclusion of the right
of any other individual in the universe.’”® If pressed we might
acknowledge the limitation on property rights that was recognized
in Ploof v. Putnam, but only on the condition that if our property
were damaged when another person used it in an emergency, that
person must be required to compensate us for the damage. It might
follow that unless there were some good reason for departing from
this instinctive conception of property rights, the law should reflect
that conception, in order not to upset people’s expectations and
undermine confidence in the firmness of property rights.

In my view, however, this explanation—though many people
find it congenial—is just short of being circular, since the explana-
tion rests on a pretty vague and probably not universally shared
notion of what it means in this very particular context to ‘“‘own’”’
the dock. Nonetheless, for those who still think that the proper
explanation of Vincent is that the shipowner really did ‘“‘take’’

9. 2William Blackstone, COMMENTARIES ON THE Laws oF ENGLAND 2 (Univ. of Chi. ed.
1976).

45
TORT LAW

something from the dockowner, the property rights explanation
does work.

3. The Deterrence/Resource Allocation Explanation

The question then becomes whether there could be a good
reason for departing from the ordinary conception of what it means
to ‘‘own” property and denying the dockowner a right to recover
even if the shipowner was not negligent. Up to this point we have
been talking only about compensation for damage to the dock that
has already occurred, without reference to the possibility of avoid-
ing such damage. We have been talking about doing justice between
the parties, but not about the incentive effects on others that may
be produced by whatever rule is adopted. Perhaps a concern for
reducing future losses, for example, a concern for deterrence, can
supply a justification for departing from the ordinary conception of
what it means to own property.

a. Who Should be Liable?

Suppose that dockowners were much better situated than
shipowners to determine the best way to prevent damage to their
docks when ships stayed tied to them during storms. This is a
plausible supposition, since dockowners are likely to know more
about docks than shipowners. If dockowners can nonetheless recov-
er from shipowners for non-negligently caused damage to docks
during storms, then dockowners will have less incentive to take
measures to reduce the risk of damage to their docks, since they
will have to pay for those measures themselves, whereas shipown-
ers will have to pay if the measures are not taken and damage
occurs. Denying dockowners the right to recover from shipowners
for damage done to docks during storms might therefore tend to
increase dockowners’ incentive to take additional precautions that
would protect their docks.

But this is only half the story. Sometimes it would make
economic sense for the ship to stay moored at the dock, but at other
times the total risk to both the dock and the ship might be reduced
by untying and venturing out into the storm. Denying dockowners
the right to recover from shipowners in such situations will in-
crease the tendency of shipowners to risk damaging docks, because
shipowners will not have to pay for damage to docks. Shipowners
will tend not to venture out into a storm, risking damage to the
ship, if they can stay moored at the dock without having to pay for
non-negligent damage to the dock. In contrast, under the rule in
Vincent the shipowner always has an incentive to compare the risk

46
INTENTIONAL PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL HARM

to the dock if the ship stays moored, against the risk to the ship if
the ship does not stay moored, because under Vincent the shipown-
er must pay for whatever damage occurs: he is liable to the
dockowner for damage, and as the owner of the ship he must bear
the cost of any damage that occurs if the ship ventures out into the
storm. Conversely, and importantly, the rule encourages the dock-
owner to ‘‘permit’’ the shipowner to stay tied up, and not to behave
like the dockowner in Ploof v. Putnam.

This analysis illustrates the general principle that threatening
a party with liability gives this party an incentive to compare the
cost of liability with the cost of alternatives that may avoid liability.
Sometimes the threat of liability induces more careful behavior; but
if, all things considered, it is cheaper to bear liability than to avoid
it, then the threat of liability gives the party that is threatened an
incentive to make that choice. One way to view the issue in Vincent,
therefore, is not to ask which party should be liable for the damage
to the dock, but rather, which party is in the better position to
compare the risk to the dock with the risk to the ship.’ I suspect
that this is a close question, since while dockowners are likely to
know a lot about their docks and at least something about ships
and storms, shipowners are likely to know a lot about their ships
and about storms, and at least something about docks. In other
situations, however, it may be that one party knows a whole lot
more about both sides of the comparison than the other party.
Then, on this theory, the party with both the most relevant
knowledge and the capacity to act on it should be liable. This may
or may not be the party who seems to have ‘‘used”’ the property of
another; it may instead be the party whose property was ‘‘used.”’

b. When It Matters Who Is Liable: The Coase Theorem

Since it is probably a close question which party is in a better
position to make the decision in cases like Vincent, we are likely to
get pretty good decisions whether or not the shipowner is liable for
non-negligent damage to the dock, as long as the party who is liable
has the right to choose between the two alternatives of staying
moored or venturing out. The privilege of necessity gives the
shipowner the right to make this choice, but charges him with the
cost of doing so. This approach also assures the dockowner that he
will be compensated for all the damage to the dock that results. The
converse of this approach would deny the shipowner the privilege of

10. In one of the most important books on tort law written in the twentieth
century, THE Costs or AccipENTs (1970), Guido Calabresi terms this party the
“cheapest cost avoider.”’

47
TORT LAW

tying up at the dock, but would have to make the dockowner liable
for damage to the ship if he had the right to deny use of the dock
during a storm. The Vincent approach thus makes sense if shipown-
ers know more about ships and docks than dockowners know about
docks and ships.

If we are not sure who knows more, or if the answer varies
depending on the kind of ship and kind of dock, then giving
shipowners and dockowners freedom to bargain in advance about
what will happen during storms may help to solve the problem. For
example, if there were no legal privilege of necessity, shipowners
might be willing to pay dockowners for the contractual privilege of
staying tied to docks during storms, but dockowners might grant
them this privilege only in return for higher mooring fees that
would compensate the dockowner in advance for damage that might
be done. Shipowners might look at these higher costs and decide
that they could more cheaply bear liability for damage to docks by
installing cushioning devices such as tires on the dock-sides of their
ships, and offer to bear liability in return for lower docking fees.
The point is that, when the parties themselves can identify the
most cost-effective approach and can inexpensively set aside the
otherwise-applicable tort liability rule, then the cost of the courts’
adopting the “‘wrong”’ rule, so to speak, is simply the cost of setting
the rule aside in advance by contract. The parties themselves will
contractually arrive at the best rule for them if they can. This was
one of the insights flowing from the famous theorem developed by
Nobel Laureate Ronald Coase, that in the absence of “‘transactions
costs” the rule of liability does not matter."

When the parties have no pre-existing relationship the costs of
bargaining are in effect prohibitive, however, and the teaching of
the Coase theorem is that whether liability is imposed can make a
big difference. The plaintiffs in Ploof could not contract in advance
with every dockowner on Lake Champlain about the right to tie up
in the event of a sudden storm. And because I cannot go around
bargaining with everyone who drives on the same roads as I do
about how to order our liability relationship if our vehicles collide,
it is important that tort law adopt a rule governing automobile
collisions that creates the correct incentives for reasonably safe
driving. That rule, whatever it is, must be the “‘right”’ rule, because
practically speaking contracting around the rule would not be
feasible.

Interestingly, all this leads us back to public necessity. If at
least one of the fundamental purposes of imposing liability is to

give those who risk doing injury or damage the incentive to make
the correct comparison between taking such risks and avoiding
them, then why is there an absolute privilege in cases of public
necessity? Why isn’t the party who destroys the plaintiff's property
entitled to do so, but also liable to the plaintiff for the damages that
result? For example, it would seem that when a house in the path
of a fire is torn down to save the remainder of a town, the owner
should be able to recover for his loss. Otherwise those who tear
down the house will be like a shipowner who never has to pay for
damage to the dock, tearing down houses whenever there is even a
slight risk to the remainder of the town, even if there were other,
more prudent courses of action.

A partial explanation for the seemingly anomalous rule that
there is no liability in such a situation—i.e., that there is an
absolute rather than only a conditional privilege—is that in the
vast majority of public necessity cases, the plaintiff's property
would have been destroyed anyway by the oncoming fire or other
force that threatened the public’s property. When this is true, the
plaintiff really has not lost anything, and the decision to destroy
the plaintiff's property was in fact correct. But a more satisfying
explanation, I think, is that when the public necessity rule
emerged, there would have been no feasible way to hold the
appropriate parties liable. Because towns and municipalities did not
exist as legal entities until relatively recently, there was no way for
the plaintiff to hold a “‘town’’ liable. And because the individual or
individuals who actually tore down the plaintiff's house were acting
not only for themselves but also for others and for the public good,
it would have been inappropriate to hold them liable as individuals.
Yet it would have been difficult if not impossible to identify and
recover from the large number of people whose property had
benefited enough from destruction of the plaintiffs property to
warrant imposing liability on them. By the time municipalities
gained a legal existence that would have rendered them an appro-
priate target of liability, the public necessity rule had already
crystallized.

This discussion of necessity may seem to have wandered far
from the defenses that may be raised in suits for intentional injury
to property. But the discussion illustrates the way in which any
effort to reject superficial answers and to delve further into the
reasons that tort liability is or is not imposed almost inevitably
leads to considerations of principle and policy at a deeper level. The
questions raised in considering the defense of necessity run

TORT LAW

throughout the law of torts: In fashioning the rules governing tort
liability and the defenses to it, how much stress should be placed on
the goal of doing justice between the parties and how much on
promoting optimal deterrence? When should liability be imposed
even in the absence of a wrong committed by the defendant? These
questions return, again and again, whether intentional torts, negli-
gence, or strict liability are involved.

THE NEGLIGENCE STANDARD

Even if the defendant did not intend to physically injure the
plaintiff or to invade another interest of the plaintiff that the law of
torts protects, liability may be imposed for injury or damage caused
by the defendant’s negligence. Most tort cases are negligence cases.
The vast majority involve comparatively minor or modest injuries
and are settled on a fairly routine, almost bureaucratized basis. A
few involve serious injuries or pose complex or unusual legal issues.
A higher percentage of these cases, but still only a minority, go to
trial. But although most negligence cases are settled, they are
settled in the shadow of the law of negligence and in anticipation of
what would happen at trial.

Negligence is easily defined: it is the failure to exercise reason-
able care to avoid injury or damage to another person or property.
Ordinarily one is under an obligation—that is, has a duty—to
exercise reasonable care to avoid causing foreseeable physical injury
to other people or their property. This is a duty not to be negligent.
Failure to do so constitutes a breach of duty, thus comprising the
first two of the four elements of any tort (duty, breach of duty,
damages, and causation). In most negligence cases involving bodily
injury or property damage the question of “duty” therefore stays in
the background, though it is logically present in every case. But
there are important situations in which the law holds that there is
no duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid causing foreseeable
physical harm. And there are many situations in which there is no
duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid causing foreseeable non-
physical injury, such as economic or emotional loss. This Chapter
addresses the set of cases in which the “‘duty’”’ question stays in the
background and the issue is whether the defendant was negligent.
The law governing the situations in which the nature and scope of
the duty question are actively in play is addressed later, under the
rubric of “‘proximate cause” (Chapter Six) and “affirmative and
limited duty” (Chapter Eleven).

The law of negligence tends to afford more protection against
bodily injury and property damage than pure economic or pure
emotional loss for a number of reasons, not the least of which is
that personal health and physical well-being are essential to the

51
TORT LAW

pursuit of most of other goods. The quandary is why property also
receives this protection. A plausible answer, I think, is that because
many of the same actions that risk causing bodily injury simulta-
neously risk causing property damage, imposing liability for negli-
gently-caused property damage also tends to reduce the risk that
negligence will cause bodily injury. But there are also reasons of
history—rights of property were once considered more important
than many people think they are today. And measuring property
losses is easier than measuring some other kinds of losses (e.g.,
fear) for which there is sometimes less protection.

What is ‘‘reasonable care’”’ depends on the circumstances. Neg-
ligence cases are therefore heavily fact-driven and usually are
decided by a jury. Nonetheless, a number of important rules of law
regarding negligence have developed over time. These rules affect
the admissibility of evidence, rulings on motions for summary
judgment, rulings on motions for directed verdicts and judgments
notwithstanding the verdict (in the federal system these are termed
motions for judgment as a matter of law), and the wording of jury
instructions, among other things. At the core of all of these rules is
the meaning of the concept of negligence.

This Chapter examines the meaning and application of the
concept of negligence, first looking briefly at the history of negli-
gence law, and then scrutinizing the modern negligence standard
by exploring a number of subjects within it: the reasonable person
standard; Judge Learned Hand’s negligence ‘‘calculus;’’ the role
played by evidence of compliance or non-compliance with custom;
professional negligence, or malpractice; violation of statutes; and
finally, per se rules and the role of judge and jury in negligence
cases.

I. A Page of History

When Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. said that ‘‘a page of history
is worth a volume of logic,’ he meant that understanding how a
rule of law developed over time may provide a more satisfactory
explanation for its current character than exclusively logical analy-
sis of the rule. For us as well as for Holmes, a bit about the history
of negligence law can help to place the modern law of negligence in

a more comprehensible context.
A. The Scope of Liability in Trespass

Tort law emerged out of criminal law, and was therefore
originally concerned principally with violent breaches of the peace.

52
THE NEGLIGENCE STANDARD

The early tort ‘‘forms of action’”’ were for what amounted to battery
or trespass to land. To bring a tort action one needed a writ. The
principal writs for battery and trespass to land were called ‘“‘tres-
pass ui et armis”’ (trespass by force of arms) and ‘‘trespass quare
clausum fregit’’ (trespass by breaching the plaintiff's boundary).
The allegations of the plaintiff's complaint had to conform to the
requirements of the applicable writ or the action could not be
brought. For example, trespass required that the injury to the
plaintiff be direct and forceful.

If the plaintiffs claim fell perfectly within the contours of
trespass he had a very strong chance of recovery. This was because,
early on, the defendant was liable virtually without regard to
whether he was to blame for the plaintiff’s injury, as long as he had
caused it. Thus, in The Thorns Case,' the defendant was sued for
trespassing on the plaintiffs land in order to retrieve the branches
of a hedge of thorns that had fallen while the defendant was cutting
the hedge. The court held that the defendant was liable simply by
virtue of having trespassed. There was some language in the case,
however, leaving open the possibility that if the defendant had
proved that he had done all in his power to keep the thorns off the
plaintiff's land, the result might have been otherwise. But in the
absence of such a showing, trespass was what we would today call a
strict liability tort.

Over time the courts made increasing reference to the possibili-
ty that a defendant could avoid liability in trespass by proving that
he was, as they sometimes put it, “utterly without fault,” or that
the injury to the plaintiff was an “inevitable accident.’ But for
both substantive and procedural reasons, the defense apparently
was very narrow. For example, in perhaps the most noteworthy
case on the issue, Weaver v. Ward,” the parties were both English
soldiers. The plaintiff's complaint alleged that in the course of a
military training exercise the defendant shot the plaintiff. This bare
allegation made out a prima facie case of trespass vi et armis. The
defendant could then avoid liability only by pleading and proving
that he was utterly without fault. What the defendant actually
pleaded in Weaver was that the shooting was accidental. From the
modern point of view this plea seems to come pretty close to
alleging that the defendant was “‘utterly without fault.”

The court in Weaver held, however, that the facts pleaded by
the defendant did not show him to be utterly without fault. To
avoid liability, the court said, it would have been necessary for the

defendant to plead and prove that the plaintiff had run across the
line of fire while the defendant was shooting, or otherwise to have
shown that the accident had been ‘‘inevitable, and that the defen-
dant had committed no negligence to give occasion to the hurt.”
Given this language, the best interpretation of Weaver is that there
was liability in trespass for direct and forceful injury except when
the defendant could not be said in any way to have been responsible
for what happened. Merely having exercised what today we would
regard as reasonable care was not enough to show that the defen-
dant was ‘‘utterly without fault” and therefore not enough to avoid
liability. In addition, Weaver makes it clear that, as a matter of
procedure, the defendant in trespass had the burden of proving that
he was utterly without fault. The plaintiff could recover for direct
and forceful injury unless the defendant succeeded in proving that
the circumstances fell within the substantively narrow defense of
being ‘‘utterly without fault.”

Indeed, the meaning of “‘utterly without fault” was apparently
so narrow that there are few recorded cases over a period of
centuries in which the defense prevailed. There may have been
unreported cases—trials that did not result in appeals, for exam-
ple—in which the defense prevailed. And there was often a proce-
dural explanation for the defendant’s loss that makes it difficult to
pinpoint the substantive scope of the defense ‘utterly without
fault.’’ Over time two distinct defenses emerged. One was a “‘gener-
al” defense that was raised by a general plea or denial. This plea
denied the facts alleged, or at least the critical allegation that the
defendant’s act caused the plaintiff's harm. The other was a “‘spe-
cial’’ defense or plea that admitted that the cause of the plaintiff's
harm was the defendant’s act, but further alleged that although he
had caused the harm he was otherwise was utterly without fault. In
some cases the defendant seemed to lose because he had entered a
general plea when he should have pleaded specially, and vice versa.

Consequently, it may be that some defendants even in the
recorded cases would in fact have prevailed on the defense that they
were “utterly without fault” had they employed the proper plea in
raising their defenses. That is, there may well have been more
scope for escaping liability because of the absence of fault than the
recorded cases suggest. But even if this were true, it is fair to say
that there was precious little room for avoiding liability on this
basis, although there seemed to be more and more room as the
beginning of the nineteenth century approached.

54
THE NEGLIGENCE STANDARD

B. The Rise of Trespass on the Case and the Transition
to a Negligence Standard

Plaintiffs had their problems too. For a while (centuries, per-
haps) there was no liability for bodily injury that did not fall within
the contours of trespass—i.e., that was not direct and forceful.
Eventually, however, a new form of action emerged, under which
liability sometimes was imposed when the harm was indirect, or
consequential, as long as the defendant was negligent in risking the
harm. But the plaintiff shouldered the burden of proof on the
negligence issue. Since the writ system was in full force when this
form of action emerged, it first became actionable as “‘trespass in a
similar case,”’ then as “‘trespass on the case,” and finally (more or
less for short) as ‘‘case.’”’ The question that was often raised after
this alternative approach to liability became established was wheth-
er the plaintiff should have sued in trespass or in case, since the
requirements of these two alternatives varied. Trespass would lie
(that is, was the appropriate form of action) when the harm alleged
was direct; the defendant could escape liability for trespass only in
narrow circumstances, by proving that he was utterly without fault.
On the other hand, case would lie when the harm was indirect or
consequential, and in case the defendant was only liable for negli-
gence. Trespass was obviously a more favorable form of action for
the plaintiff, because liability was imposed virtually without regard
to whether the defendant was at fault, and even the utter absence
of fault was an affirmative defense to be proved by the defendant,
whereas in case there was liability only if the defendant was
negligent, and the plaintiff had the burden of proving it. But if the
plaintiff sued in trespass (for direct harm) when he should have
sued in case (for indirect harm), he lost.

This was precisely the issue in the memorable case of Scott v.
Shepherd.’ There the defendant threw a lighted squib (a firecracker
or torch of some sort) into a marketplace, and it was tossed like a
hot potato from person to person until it injured the plaintiff, who
sued in trespass. The defendant argued that because the harm was
not direct, the plaintiff should have sued in case. The court held
that the harm was direct and that trespass therefore would lie, but
in so holding revealed how arbitrary the distinction between tres-
pass and case actually was. A plaintiff ‘lucky’ enough to be able to
sue in trespass usually recovered very easily; but a plaintiff forced
to sue in case had a harder time, since he had to prove negligence.

3. 96 Eng.Rep. 525 (K.B.1772).

55
TORT LAW

Similarly, a defendant unfortunate enough to have caused direct
injury and to be sued in trespass was almost certainly going to be
liable, whereas a defendant who was sued in case could avoid
liability if he had exercised what came to be understood as reason-
able care. And these differences depended on something that in-
creasingly seemed morally and practically irrelevant: whether the
harm had occurred in a direct or indirect manner.’

Although it took more time than one might expect to sweep
away this distinction between trespass and case, eventually it did
happen. On this side of the Atlantic the leading decision was Brown
v. Kendall,’ the dogfight case. The plaintiff and defendant owned
dogs that were fighting, and in attempting to break up the fight
with a stick, the defendant accidentally struck the plaintiff in the
eye. The plaintiff sued in trespass, alleging that the defendant was
liable for a direct and forceful injury. The opinion for the highest
court of Massachusetts was written by Chief Judge Lemuel Shaw,
who happened to be the father-in-law of Herman Melville and may

well have served as the model for Captain Vere in Melville’s novel,
Bitty Bupp.

Shaw’s opinion in Brown v. Kendall inaugurated a new era in
American tort law. The plaintiff claimed that because his action
properly was brought in trespass, he needed only to prove direct,
forcible injury, and that the defendant could only escape liability by
showing that he had exercised extraordinary care (presumably,
something like being “‘utterly without fault’’). Shaw rejected this
contention outright. He said that the statements in the cases to the
effect that trespass will lie in cases of direct injury all had been
made in reference to the question whether trespass and not case
will lie, assuming that some action would lie. But neither trespass
nor case will lie, he said, unless the defendant had intended to
injure the plaintiff or had negligently injured him. And Shaw went
on to say that the plaintiff has the burden of proving either intent
to injure or negligence, whether the action is brought in trespass or
in case. Finally, Shaw indicated that while there may be instances
in which the reasonable thing to do would be to exercise extraordi-
nary care, the standard by which the defendant is to be judged is
always one of “‘ordinary” or reasonable care. If the defendant has
exercised ordinary care then he is not liable, whether the action is
brought in trespass or in case.

56
THE NEGLIGENCE STANDARD

As legal history, probably this was inaccurate, to say the least.
The case law over the centuries certainly strongly implied that, for
practical purposes, liability in trespass was imposed even when the
defendant was not negligent. So Brown v. Kendall arguably did not
merely redescribe existing law, but changed it substantially. No
longer was there any question whether a plaintiff could recover for
a direct injury even if the defendant had acted carefully: there was
no such recovery. No longer did the defendant bear the burden of
proving that he had met the requisite standard of care: the plaintiff
now had the burden of proving breach of that standard. And the
cause of action for negligently-caused harm now had the potential
to become a general standard rather than being a series of particu-
lar duties. In short, there was no longer any substantive difference
between trespass and case; that difference was merely procedural,
affecting the kind of writ the plaintiff had to obtain, but not what
the plaintiff had to prove in order to succeed. There could be no
recovery in the absence of negligence or conduct even more blame-
worthy, such as acting with intent to cause harm.

Very quickly this approach became nearly universal. Brown v.
Kendall is only the most famous of the mid-nineteenth century
decisions out of which the new negligence regime emerged. But
although there is no doubt about the fact of this development, there
is controversy among legal scholars about the way in which the new
regime meshed with nineteenth century social and economic atti-
tudes. Certainly the idea that there could be no liability unless the
defendant had done something wrong was consistent with the
rugged individualism and industrial expansionism of the age. Some
scholars have gone further, however, asserting that the new negli-
gence regime was designed to provide a subsidy to infant industry,
by removing the threat of strict liability that might have hindered
industrial development. In the view of these scholars, the develop-
ment of contributory negligence (i.e., negligence by the plaintiff) as
a complete defense to a negligence action further subsidized poten-
tial defendants by further narrowing the scope of liability. Other
scholars have examined the facts of large samples of negligence
cases during that era, however, and concluded that the ‘“‘subsidy
thesis” is too simplistic, since the move to negligence aided all
kinds of defendants. Brown v. Kendall, after all, did not involve an
industrial or commercial defendant, but two individuals. Moreover,
although trespass may until that time have been a strict liability
action, both trespass and case had limited applicability in earlier
centuries. In a sense there was a background of no liability with a
few exceptions to it.’ But over time the occasions in which liability

6. See Robert L. Rabin, The Historical Development of the Fault Principle: A
Reinterpretation, 15 Ga. L. Rev. 925 (1981).

57
TORT LAW

might be imposed had slowly expanded, especially as the number of
accidents that could cause bodily injury increased. Although Brown
and cases like it did narrow the basis of liability, certainly the
cumulative effect of all these developments was that the incidence
of liability increased between the seventeenth and the nineteenth
centuries.

In any event, the term “subsidy’”’ is in a sense pejorative.
Defendants as a group may have been better off after Brown v.
Kendall than before, and plaintiffs worse off. But if that case
adopted the correct, or fairest, or preferable rule, then it did not
create a subsidy. It put matters right, for under the prior rule (on
this view of it) there had been a “subsidy” to plaintiffs. On the
other hand, if the correct, or fairest, or preferable rule had been
what amounted to strict liability, then the move to negligence was
indeed a subsidy, in the sense of creating an artificial advantage for
defendants. In short, rule changes may produce changes in entitle-
ments, with the advantages to plaintiffs or to defendants that come
with the change. But whether a change is a subsidy or its oppo-
site—the elimination of a subsidy—depends on what one considers
the ‘“‘correct” rule to begin with.

Regardless of the way one views the issues posed by the
subsidy thesis, it is indisputable that by the late nineteenth centu-
ry, negligence was the dominant standard. Even today, while the
areas in which strict liability is imposed have slowly expanded
somewhat, negligence remains the dominant basis for imposing
liability in cases of non-intentional bodily injury or property dam-
age. The question today, then, is what it means to be negligent.

II. The Reasonable Person Standard

Negligence is the failure to exercise the care that would have
been exercised by the reasonably prudent person under the circum-
stances. Reasonable care is sometimes referred to as due care, or
ordinary care, which might be thought, incorrectly, to mean only
average care, no matter how risky average care is. Strictly speak-
ing, reasonable care is not necessarily average care. The question is
not what average people actually do, but what they ought to do.

Standing alone the definition of negligence as ‘‘reasonable
care’ is useful only as loose guidance for the jury. It is not a
concrete rule, but a general standard that asks for a normative or
evaluative judgment, not a finding of pure empirical fact. In many
negligence cases, therefore, enormous reliance is placed on the jury
to resolve the negligence issue, which is often referred to as ‘“‘mixed

58
THE NEGLIGENCE STANDARD

question of fact and law.”’ The core of the question is, ‘should the
defendant have behaved more carefully?” Karl Llewellyn once drew
an analogy between legal rules and the game of golf. Rules, he said,
are like chipping from off the green. They can get the ball onto the
green, but you still have to putt to get the ball in the hole—i.e.,
apply the rule to the facts. What Llewellyn said of concrete rules is
even more true of general standards. In negligence cases the jury
does the putting.

A general negligence standard can work well in many negli-
gence cases. When jurors are familiar with the activity that gave
rise to the plaintiff's injury, then they can easily apply the con-
science of the community in evaluating the defendant’s conduct.
The kind of activities juries are likely to know about will vary with
the time and place. For example, in Vaughan v. Menlove,' the
defendant was sued for damage to the plaintiff’s cottages resulting
from a fire that started in one of the defendant’s hay stacks. The
question was whether the defendant had behaved negligently in
placing a hay stack so near to the plaintiff's cottages, in light of the
dry condition of the hay. I doubt that many of today’s readers
would feel competent to make that judgment without some assis-
tance from expert witnesses. But in rural England in 1837, jurors
probably would know how the community would expect the defen-
dant to behave. The issue was one on which the jurors were likely
to have had experience and a confident opinion.

The equivalent today would be an ordinary intersection acci-
dent between automobiles. Virtually everyone drives, and virtually
everyone would feel capable of judging whether the defendant drove
reasonably under the circumstances. In contrast, in cases involving
complex or technical activities with which most of us are not
automatically familiar—the provision of medical care or the design
of products, for example—the task is more difficult and the jury
must be educated by the parties before it can be expected to render
an informed verdict. As we shall see, the law has ways of helping
this process of education along, but even with this help the result
must sometimes fall short of the ideal of the well-informed decision-
maker invoking settled community norms.

The idealized picture of the jury as the informed conscience of
the community in negligence cases sometimes is unrealistic in
another way as well. In some cases there may be well-developed and
fairly uniform standards regarding the proper way to engage in a
particular activity. Farmers may know and agree on the proper way
to build hay stacks, and drivers may know and agree on the proper

7. 132 Eng.Rep. 490 (C.P.1837).

59
TORT LAW

way to change lanes on a four-lane divided highway. But often,
perhaps even usually, there are no pre-existing, sufficiently con-
crete and uniform norms that jurors can invoke in order to decide
whether the defendant was negligent. The facts of actual cases are
so varied that general norms do not definitively resolve them. For
example, in a highway accident case the jury’s sense of the proper
way to change lanes might depend on how much traffic there was
on the highway; how fast the vehicles were traveling; and how
much space between vehicles the drivers on that highway ordinarily
maintain. To the extent that this is true, there is no precise rule
that the jury can use to resolve the negligence issue. Rather, in
effect the jury must create a rule for the particular case at hand
based on the general ‘‘reasonableness’’ standard and then apply
that rule to evaluate the defendant’s behavior.

In situations such as this when no concrete, self-applying rule
applies across the board, different juries may well resolve the
negligence issue differently in cases involving the same or highly
similar facts. Nothing in negligence law requires that like cases be
decided alike by different juries. Rather, when there is no applica-
ble rule that makes the reasonableness standard more concrete,
instead of having negligence rules that resolve disputes on their
own, we have only a “process” for resolving negligence cases by
submitting them to the jury.® Nonetheless it is possible to tease out
of the general concept of negligence a number of ways in which
conduct might fall short of the reasonableness standard. Some are
simply ideas that lawyers, commentators, and juries may or may
not find attractive. Others have crystalized into actual rules.

In the former category are two notions. First, negligence is not
necessarily one single thing, one single form of falling short of a
standard, but several. Conduct might be unreasonable because it is
careless, in the sense of being inadvertently inattentive to safety.
For example, I might take my eyes off the road while driving
because I daydream. Conduct might instead be unreasonable be-
cause it is foolish. That is, a party may be aware of the risk his or
her conduct posed for others, but consciously make a poor judgment
about what to do. Or a party might be foolishly ignorant of a risk.
One or the other of these kinds of foolishness might have been
present in Vaughan v. Menlove. Finally, conduct might selfish, the
product of weighing one’s own interests too heavily and the inter-
ests of others not heavily enough. The defendant in Vaughan said
that he would ‘‘chance it’’ because he had insurance. This might be
an example of selfishness. Negligence law has no rule that subdi-

with Negligence, 54 Vanp. L. Rev. 1187 (2001).

60
THE NEGLIGENCE STANDARD

vides conduct in these ways, but thinking about negligence as
carelessness, foolishness, or selfishness may still be helpful.’

A second way in which conduct may fall short of reasonable-
ness involves the rate of compliance with the standard. Juries are
not required, but clearly are permitted, to find that parties must
behave reasonably all the time. For example, if reasonable care
requires driving no more than 30 miles per hour on a particular
road, the jury is entitled to find the defendant negligent for driving
at 40 miles per hour, even if the defendant proves that he has
driven on that road his entire life and never before exceeded the
speed limit. The option of the jury to apply a perfect compliance
requirement helps avoid trying the defendant’s character (‘‘is he
generally reasonable?’’) and avoids inquiry into conduct that oc-
curred on occasions other than the one in question.”

These two ways of thinking about negligence (as well as any
number of others) are optional. Fortunately, however, over time the
law has put a bit of meat on the bones of the reasonableness
standard by creating some more or less concrete rules that are
mandatory, and direct the jury as to the proper way to make its
negligence/no negligence decision. The most important such rules
are the objective standard, the special rules governing children and
the infirm, and the foreseeability requirement.

A. The Objective Standard

Perhaps the most important specification of the general negli-
gence standard is that it is objective, not subjective. With the few
exceptions described below, reasonable care ‘‘under the circum-
stances” does not include the incapacities or limitations of the
person whose behavior is under evaluation. That the defendant did
his best or acted in good faith is no defense. Rather, the question is
how the reasonably prudent person would have acted under the
circumstances, not whether the defendant meant well or was in
good faith. Indeed, evidence of the defendant’s benevolent state of
mind ordinarily is not even admissible, because under the objective
standard this evidence is irrelevant.

It may seem somewhat anomalous to hold that a defendant was
negligent even if she could not have done any better. In morality,
“ought” presupposes ‘‘can.’’ How can the defendant be at ‘‘fault’”’ if
she did her best? One answer is that, if the defendant is still at

TORT LAW

“fault”? when she did her best, then legal fault obviously differs
from moral fault. Perhaps some of what we call ‘‘negligence,” and
liability imposed under that rubric, has more in common with strict
liability—liability without fault—than it has with moral blamewor-
thiness. It may be, that is, that there is a pocket of strict liability
within negligence.

The question, then, is why negligence law takes this approach
and adopts an objective standard. There are a number of arguments
in favor of this standard. One set of arguments relates to the cost
and ease of adjudication and to the feasibility of fact-finding. A
subjective standard would be infinitely variable, depending on the
particular strengths, weaknesses, and experiences of the individual
in question. Applying such a standard would require much more
complicated and difficult fact-finding than applying an objective
standard. To apply a subjective standard the jury would have to
determine how careful the defendant was capable of being, and
whether she employed all her abilities. But to apply an objective
reasonableness standard the jury need only compare the actual
conduct of the defendant with that standard. The great advantage
of an objective standard is that it asks the members of the jury to
judge the defendant based on their own knowledge and experience
in the world. They need not engage in psychology or attempt to
look into the defendant’s mind. They need only decide how the
reasonable person would have behaved, and measure the defen-
dant’s behavior against that standard. In addition, a subjective
standard would encourage fraud and deception. If the negligence
determination depended on the characteristics of the defendant,
then the defendant would have an incentive to mislead the jury
about those characteristics, understating her strengths and over-
stating her weaknesses. An objective standard does not create this
problem because those strengths and weaknesses do not count.

A second set of arguments relates to incentives and deterrence.
Because the defendant’s strengths and weaknesses do not count,
the objective standard has greater potential for encouraging the
defendant to exercise all the care and skill that she can. Admittedly,
the defendant can only do as well as she is capable of doing; but
under a subjective standard she may not even do that, relying on
the vagaries of the fact-finding process for protection. In contrast,
the objective standard is unforgiving; the threat of liability under
an objective standard may therefore push potential defendants to
do their best, especially if the reasonable person standard is set (as
juries typically set it) at a level that is well within the reach of most
people. And when a defendant recognizes that he is incapable of
complying with the objective standard, he may reduce the level of

62
THE NEGLIGENCE STANDARD

his involvement in the activity in question in order to avoid
exposure to liability. If I am a very poor driver, I may tend to let
others drive or to take public transportation. The threat of liability
under the objective standard may thereby affect not only safety
levels, but activity levels as well. An objective standard also gives
the public assurance that those to whose actions they are exposed
will either act with a predictable level of care or be liable for the
consequences of failing to do so. Members of the public can there-
fore more accurately gauge the level of self-protective care that they
need to employ than would be possible if the amount of care that
could be expected from others varied with the characteristics of
each individual.

A third set of arguments concerns the fairness of the objective
standard. Although the objective standard burdens some individu-
als more than others, it treats everyone equally. If a subjective
standard were applied, some individuals would need to plead what
could amount to an excuse for not behaving as carefully as everyone
else does. They would have to stigmatize themselves in court in
order to avoid liability. The objective standard declines to stigma-
tize the disabled in this way, though at the cost of their incurring
more liability than others. This liability, however, they can usually
cover with insurance. In addition, everyone benefits from the
degree of safety that the objective standard helps to encourage. If a
subjective standard applied, then those whom this standard exoner-
ated from liability would obtain the benefit of extra safety from
others, without providing others this extra safety in return. Apply-
ing the objective standard to those who cannot comply with it
provides others with the substitute benefit of the right to recover
for their losses.

These arguments for the objective standard have considerable
weight, but they are not indisputable. For example, it would be far
from unthinkable for jurors to inquire into the state of mind of the
defendant in deciding whether she was negligent. Juries must do
exactly that in cases involving battery and assault; they could do so
in negligence cases as well, assessing the credibility of the defen-
dant in order to minimize perjury. It is also true that a benefit of
the objective standard is that it may create an incentive for defen-
dants to exercise all the care they can; but this incentive cannot be
created unless the fact that the standard is objective is communi-
cated to and understood by the below-average individuals who are
most likely to be affected by the standard but least likely to
appreciate its significance for them. And although the objective
standard may make some people’s behavior more predictably safe,
in light of the variable application of even the objective standard

63
TORT LAW

from jury to jury, the size of this effect is debatable. Finally,
although the objective standard treats everyone equally, it is not
clear that treating differently-situated individuals equally in this
situation is more consistent with fairness than treating them differ-
ently.

Despite the strength of some of these counterarguments, the
law has long adhered in conventional cases to the objective stan-
dard. There are situations, however, in which the standard is
relaxed and at least some subjectivity is permitted to find its way
into the negligence decision. The main cases involve children and
the infirm.

B. Children and the Infirm

Notwithstanding the objective standard, the law has always
made certain accommodations for children and the infirm. The
scope of these accommodations sheds some additional light on the
overall purpose of the objective standard.

1. Children

Children below about the age of five cannot be negligent at all,
presumably because they cannot be expected to exercise care. Until
about the mid-twentieth century the rule governing children above
that age was that they were expected to exercise the degree of care
that would be reasonable in a child of similar age, intelligence, and
experience. This is what might be called a semi-objective standard,
in that the reasonableness of the child’s behavior was measured
against the capacities of similar children in that age group. But a
child of unusual intelligence or experience might be expected to
exercise more care than would usually be expected of other children
of his age.

This rule was a concession to the reality that there is a limit to
the degree of care that can be expected of children. The incentive-
creating effects of an objective standard on adults whose capacities
are below average are highly unlikely to influence children. Those
who come into contact with children understand this and can
exercise additional self-protective care when necessary. Moreover,
until the middle of the twentieth century there was little point to
suing children in tort, since parents were not and are not liable for
the torts of their children (though they may be liable in their own
right for negligent supervision) and children ordinarily have no
substantial assets of their own. In any event, the younger the child
who has caused an injury to another person, the greater the

64
THE NEGLIGENCE STANDARD

likelihood that the victim will in fact have an independent claim
against the child’s parents or caretaker for negligent supervision.

The semi-objective children’s reasonableness standard has now
been qualified in many jurisdictions, however, by the proviso that
when children engage in dangerous adult activities, they are held to
an adult standard of care. The point made in the cases that have
established this proviso is that potential victims of children who
drive motor vehicles, fly airplanes, or operate motor boats, for
example, have no way to anticipate which driver or pilot is a child.
There is therefore no realistic way to exercise the additional self-
protective care that is required when one encounters children
engaged in children’s activities. Furthermore, there is no particular
social benefit to be gained by immunizing children against liability
for harm caused by engaging in adult activities; unless a child is
capable of complying with an adult standard of care he or she
should not be driving, flying, or operating a motor boat. Finally,
with the post-World War II rise of auto and homeowner’s liability
insurance, children are much more likely than in the past to be
independently insured under their parents’ liability insurance poli-
cies and thereby able to satisfy judgments rendered against them in
cases involving adult activities. Where insurance has gone, tort law
has tended to follow.

2. Infirm Adults

Pinpointing the standard that applies to physically and mental-
ly infirm adults is more complicated. Typically, physical infirmities
are taken into account in judging the reasonableness of behavior,
but mental infirmities are not. The traditional common law rule
was that even insane people are liable for their torts. What might
account for this difference? Indeed, why would there be a departure
from the objective standard at all where physical infirmities are
concerned? The answers tell us something about both the objective
standard and the exceptions to it.

The main difference between physical and mental infirmities is
that the former are typically visible, measurable, and verifiable. By
contrast—especially in the nineteenth century when these rules
developed—mental infirmities are invisible, hard to measure, and
incompletely verifiable. The whole focus of the objective standard,
in fact, is the classic example of this problem. The defendant in
Vaughan v. Menlove (the haystack case) and others like him, for
instance, may assert that he just doesn’t have the judgment or
intelligence to be as careful about avoiding risk to others that the
average or reasonable person has. The objective standard rejects
this assertion, not because it is necessarily false, but because it is

65
TORT LAW

not necessarily true and because it is difficult to know when it is
true and when it is not. One might respond that even if minor
mental deficiencies are difficult to verify or measure, those who
have serious mental illness can now be easily and reliably identified
and diagnosed. Perhaps, but even now psychiatric diagnosis is a
dicey enterprise. Moreover, people who suffer delusions often have
periods of lucidity. During such periods it may be negligent not to
take action to prevent oneself from causing harm while delusional.
This was the basis of the court’s decision, for example, in Breunig
v. American Family Ins. Co.,"' in which the defendant thought that
she and her car could fly ‘because Batman does it.’’ This was in
effect an application of the more general ‘“‘emergency”’ doctrine,
which holds that when a danger arises without warning, this
circumstance may be taken into account in assessing the reason-
ableness of the behavior of the party faced with the danger. When
there was warning of the danger, however, then the fact that there
was opportunity for deliberation rather than merely instinctive
reaction must be considered. Finally, often people who are psychot-
ic or delusional may nonetheless be capable of being careful. Just
because I think that I am Napoleon doesn’t mean that I don’t know
that I should stop at a red light. In any event, such people
commonly have guardians who have an interest in preserving their
assets and therefore an incentive to monitor and control their
behavior. This incentive would be diminished if the mentally ill
were not liable for negligence.

In contrast, physical infirmities pose measurement and verifia-
bility problems to a much lesser degree and are therefore subject to
a semi-objective standard. A blind person cannot read a sign that
says ‘‘Warning: Highly Flammable Vapors. Do Not Smoke.” If his
smoking starts a fire, the jury will be instructed in a suit by the
owner of the property damaged by fire that it may (probably must)
take into account the defendant’s blindness in determining whether
he behaved reasonably or negligently under the circumstances.
However, although usually a semi-objective standard is more le-
nient than an objective standard, there are times when the exis-
tence of the defendant’s infirmity can cut the other way. The jury is
permitted to take the defendant’s physical infirmity into account in
deciding whether his physical limitation should have led him to
take precautions different from or additional to those expected of a
reasonable person without the physical infirmity in question. Most
obviously, a blind person should not drive a motor vehicle; a person
in a wheelchair should be more hesitant about “‘jaywalking” than
others.

11. 45 Wis.2d 536, 173 N.W.2d 619 (1970).

66
THE NEGLIGENCE STANDARD

It is worth noting, however, that over time our social attitudes
toward physical and mental infirmities have evolved in favor of
greater and greater involvement of people with those infirmities in
everyday activities. At the very least, evidence of what people with
the same disability as the defendant’s are capable of doing would be
admissible in his defense. And given evolving attitudes, in making
the negligence decision at least some juries would be likely to
reflect the evolution of our attitudes in this regard. What once
would have been considered the taking of an imprudent risk by a
disabled person might not be today.

C. The Foreseeability Requirement

The logic of reasonable care depends on the connection be-
tween knowledge and behavior. A defendant is not negligent unless
he knew or reasonably should have known that his actions posed a
risk of harm. Even then, the defendant is not negligent unless a
reasonable person under the circumstances would have taken pre-
cautions that the defendant did not take in order to avoid that risk.
It would be nonsensical to say that someone was negligent for
failing to reduce or eliminate a risk about which he did not and
could not know. Consequently, a person cannot be negligent for
failing to take precautions against an unforeseeable risk of harm.

The term foreseeability can be unnecessarily confusing. In this
context, the term refers to the known or knowable possibility that
there exists a risk that will result in harm. So understood, foresee-
ability and unforeseeability are not binary concepts, but involve
degrees of probability and improbability, although some risks are
completely unforeseeable. That is, they are so improbable that a
reasonable person need not anticipate them at all.

For example, in one of the early cases on this issue, Blyth v.
Birmingham Waterworks,” a record freeze apparently caused leak-
age from one of the defendant’s underground water mains, damag-
ing the plaintiff's house. The trial court left it to the jury to decide
whether the defendant was negligent (presumably either in the
design of the system, or in failing to inspect it, or both), and the
jury found for the plaintiff. However, on appeal the court held, in
effect, that a directed verdict should have been granted for the
defendant, reasoning that it was not unreasonable to fail to take
precautions against a frost that ‘penetrated to a greater depth than
any which ordinarily occurs south of the polar regions.”’ For prac-
tical purposes the court seems to have concluded that the risk that

12. 156 Eng.Rep. 1047 (Ex.1856).

67
TORT LAW

materialized in harm to the plaintiff simply was not foreseeable.
That is, in the court’s view the risk was so improbable that as a
matter of law a reasonable person need not take it into account in
determining what precautions to take.

Today, Blyth would almost certainly pose a question of fact for
the jury. Few risks are so unforeseeable as to warrant granting a
directed verdict to the defendant on that ground alone. That is
especially true of weather. Nothing is so foreseeable as more severe
weather than is normally likely to occur. That is what is meant by
100 year floods and even 1000 year floods. But a 1000 year flood
may not be sufficiently probable to permit a jury to find that it is
reasonably foreseeable. It is foreseeable that such things will hap-
pen, though on a very infrequent basis. Depending on the context,
therefore, it might be said as a matter of law that a 1000 year flood
is not “foreseeable.” But even if the improbability of the risk that
caused harm is not, in itself, a basis for exonerating the defendant,
this factor may figure in the overall negligence calculation. To put
it another way, rarely does a defendant escape liability purely
because a risk was utterly unforeseeable. Yet how likely or unlikely
it was that a particular risk would materialize in harm is very
relevant. We turn next, therefore, to what has been called the

negligence ‘‘calculus,”’ in which the probability of harm plays an
important part.

Ill. The Negligence ‘Calculus’’

Despite the different clarifications of the reasonable person
standard that tort law has developed, the notion is still very
general. A different angle of analysis that has emerged to help
clarify what it means to be negligent has come to be called the
negligence ‘‘calculus.”” The negligence calculus affords a way of
thinking about the circumstances under which a reasonable person
would risk harm or would instead take steps to reduce that risk. A
major contribution of the calculus is that it unpacks the general
notion of reasonable behavior into three components: the probabili-
ty that a particular act or omission will cause harm; the magnitude
of that harm if it occurs; and the value of the interest that must be
foregone or sacrificed in order to reduce the risk of harm.

A. The Learned Hand Formulation

The negligence calculus received its most famous expression in
an opinion by Judge Learned Hand in United States v. Carroll

68
THE NEGLIGENCE STANDARD

Towing Co.* In that case the question was whether it was negligent
not to have personnel at all times on a barge under tow. Hand put
the issue this way:

the [barge] owner’s duty, as in other similar situations, to
provide against resulting injuries is a function of three varia-
bles: (1) The probability that she will break away; (2) the
gravity of the resulting injury, if she does; (3) the burden of
adequate precautions. Possibly it serves to bring this notion
into relief to state it in algebraic terms: if the probability be
called P; the injury, L; and the burden, B; liability depends
upon whether B is less than L multiplied by P: i.e., whether B
is less than PL.

Although Hand’s use of even simple algebra might be overly
technical for some people, the intuition behind the negligence
calculus is straightforward. To determine whether taking a particu-
lar risky action is or is not reasonable, it is useful to compare the
expected accident costs that will be incurred from taking a particu-
lar action with the costs of avoiding these costs. To do this compari-
son, these three factors can be taken into account. The first two
factors—the probability of harm and the magnitude of harm if it
occurs—measure expected accident costs. The third factor—the
interest that must be sacrificed in order to reduce the risk of
harm—measures accident avoidance costs, or the “‘cost’’ of reducing
or avoiding the risk of harm. When the first two factors are more
weighty than the last, then the cost of risking harm is greater than
the cost of avoiding or reducing it. According to the negligence
calculus, taking the risky action is unreasonable in this situation
because expected accident costs outweigh accident avoidance costs.
Conversely, if accident avoidance costs—the interest that must be
sacrificed to reduce or avoid a risk (the cost of safety precautions,
and whatever benefits are sacrificed by exercising more care)—is
more weighty than expected accident costs, then it is not unreason-
able to take the risk. This comparison between the cost of risking
accidents and the cost of avoiding them is sometimes referred to as
cost-benefit or risk-benefit analysis.

The substance of the negligence calculus has been embodied in
Section 3 of the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for Physical
and Emotional Harm,” and in many statements by appellate courts.

13. 159 F.2d 169 (2d Cir.1947).

14. “A person acts negligently if the person does not exercise reasonable care
under all the circumstances. Primary factors to consider in ascertaining whether the
person’s conduct lacks reasonable care are the foreseeable likelihood that the
person’s conduct will result in harm, the foreseeable severity of any harm that may
ensue, and the burden of precautions to eliminate or reduce the risk of harm.”

69
TORT LAW

The calculus can also be used in a number of ways at the trial level,
though its litigation usefulness should not be overestimated. Juries
could be instructed that they are permitted to take the factors
comprising the negligence calculus into account in deciding whether
the defendant (or plaintiff) was negligent. But such instructions are
rare and even when given probably should leave the jury the option
of ignoring them. Certainly the calculus can also help a court to
determine whether certain evidence (directed at one or more of the
factors comprising the calculus) is relevant. And the intuition
behind the negligence calculus, or reference to the specific factors
articulated by the calculus, may help a court to rule on motions for
summary judgment or for directed verdicts.

For example, in Eckert v. Long Island R.R.,” the plaintiff's
decedent had saved a small child from near-certain death by sweep-
ing the child off the tracks of a negligently-operated train. In the
course of the rescue, however, the rescuer was killed. At the trial of
an action by the rescuer’s estate against the defendant railroad, the
defendant moved for a ‘‘nonsuit’’—in effect, a directed verdict—on
the ground (among other things) that it was negligent as a matter
of law for the rescuer to have risked his life as he did and that such
“contributory” negligence by the plaintiff barred recovery. The
court rejected this contention, stating that ‘‘[t]he law has so high a
regard for human life that it will not impute negligence to an effort
to preserve it, unless made under such circumstances as to consti-
tute rashness in the judgment of prudent persons.” But in a
passage making it clear that something like the negligence calculus
was at the heart of its reasoning, the court went on to indicate that
if the rescuer had attempted merely to protect property from harm,
the result would have been different.

If all this seems like ordinary common sense, in a sense it is. In
these circumstances the negligence calculus is merely a way of
identifying the factors that may lead to common-sense conclusions
about which risks are worth taking and which are not, depending
on what is at stake: the probability of harm (the risk of death or
serious injury to the rescuer); the magnitude of harm if it occurs
(death or serious injury); and the interest that must be sacrificed to
avoid the harm (the chance that the child will be hit by the train).
In other, more complex cases, reference to the factors that comprise
the negligence calculus may also help to guide a judge’s or a jury’s
thinking: How many people’s safety did the defendant’s action risk?
How likely was it that harm would occur? What would have been
involved in developing safety measures that would have reduced the

15. 43 N.Y. 502 (1871).

70
THE NEGLIGENCE STANDARD

risk of harm? How much could different possible safety measures
have reduced the risk? When counsel for the parties direct some of
the evidence in the case to these factors, they will assist the judge
or jury in making sense out of the negligence question: whether one
or both of the parties’ conduct was reasonable or unreasonable
under all the circumstances. This does not necessarily even have to
take place under the rubric of the negligence calculus. Rather, the
calculus is a clarification of why it makes sense to do what, in all
probability, we would intuitively do anyway—think about the fac-
tors that might make a risk too dangerous to take.

In another sense, however, the negligence calculus is subject to
criticism. First, the negligence calculus takes a unitary concept
(reasonably prudent conduct) based on a simple prototype (the
reasonably prudent person) and turns it into something that is both
complicated and sometimes unrealistic, inappropriate, or both. A
norm such as reasonableness is not always a decision calculus, but
a settled way of behaving, or at least of evaluating behavior.
Certainly we would say this about the behavior in Eckert. If we
were simply balancing lives, the plaintiff's decedent in Eckert might
have been negligent in attempting a rescue. In any event, reason-
able driving, reasonable shoveling of snow from a sidewalk, even
reasonable use of signs to warn of danger are notions that most
people do not break down into their components. Indeed if (as I
suggested earlier) we think of one aspect of negligence as careless-
ness, the negligence calculus would not have much to tell us about
whether allegedly careless behavior is negligent. It is theoretically
possible to identify the costs of paying greater attention to one’s
behavior, but that is not the way ordinary people think about
inadvertence, and most ordinary people probably would not find it
insightful or helpful to evaluate inadvertence in that way. Thus,
although the negligence calculus may map well onto the consider-
ations that are relevant to the evaluation of considered decisions, it
does not address momentary lapses very well at all.

Second, even when applied to considered decisions, the negli-
gence calculus omits something that some people may consider
important: whether a party engaged in impartial deliberation about
a possible course of action. Some people—and therefore some
jurors—might permissibly consider the fact that the defendant tried
in good faith to reach the right decision to be relevant to the
question whether the defendant behaved reasonably. That is, the
defendant may have made the wrong decision from the standpoint
of the negligence calculus, but made the decision unselfishly. On
one view such a decision should be judged by the objective stan-
dard, and if a reasonable person would have made the decision

71
TORT LAW

correctly, the defendant was negligent. Of course, it does not follow
that defendants will always be better off engaging in impartial
consideration of the negligence calculus. The famous Pinto case, in
which a jury held the Ford Motor Company liable for $125 million
in punitive damages, illustrates the point.’* Ford designed the Pinto
after engaging in a number of cost-benefit calculations that in-
volved estimating the value of a human life. Most observers believe
that the jury was outraged by the callousness of engaging in such a
calculation. But that is exactly what the negligence calculus advis-
es. It is possible, however, that the jury was outraged by the low
value it thought Ford had placed on a human life and not by the
fact that Ford did the calculation at all.

B. Is the Calculus a Moral or an Economic Theory of
Negligence?

One view of the negligence calculus is that it adopts a certain
moral perspective on selfishness. The calculus requires that the
interests of others, represented by expected accident costs (the
probability and gravity of the injury that may result from an act) be
given equal weight when being compared with one’s own interests
(the burden of precautions, or accident avoidance cost). At the core
of this requirement is the norm of equal concern and respect for
others that is the hallmark of at least certain conceptions of
morality. On this view, the calculus provides a method of striking
an appropriate balance between the liberty of injurers and the
security of victims.

On the other hand, some academics working in the ‘‘law and
economics”’ mode have pressed the concept of the negligence calcu-
lus in a very different direction, suggesting that Hand was articu-
lating what amounts to an economic theory of negligence. Most
notably, Judge (then Professor) Richard Posner argued in a famous
article that the factors in the calculus are essentially economic.”
Posner said that multiplying the probability of loss times the
amount of loss that will be suffered if it occurs yields a measure of
the economic benefit to be derived from avoiding the loss. Similarly,
the cost of preventing the loss may be the cost of installing safety
equipment or the benefit foregone by curtailing or eliminating the
activity. If the cost of preventing the loss is greater than the benefit
to be gained by avoiding it, said Posner, then society would be
better off, in economic terms, to have the accident that results in

16. Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co., 119 Cal.App.3d 757, 174 Cal.Rptr. 348 (1981).
17. See Richard A. Posner, A Theory of Negligence, 1 J. Luca Srup. 29 (1972).

72
THE NEGLIGENCE STANDARD

the loss than to avoid it. In such a situation a defendant should not
be considered negligent for failing to take precautions that would
have been more costly than the result they would have avoided.
Conversely, if the cost of a loss is greater than the cost of prevent-
ing it, society benefits from avoiding the loss and a defendant who
fails to avoid it should be considered negligent.

Proponents of this economic theory of negligence often see it
not only as the appropriate method of determining whether a party
has been negligent, but also as a tool for deterring future accidents.
For those who believe that tort law should be concerned with doing
justice between the parties to an accident and not with affecting the
behavior of others in the future, the economic theory of negligence
is objectionable not only on the ground that it is concerned with
costs and benefits rather than with rights and justice. The theory is
also objectionable when it is employed to support an approach to
tort liability that is concerned at least as much with deterring
future misconduct as it is with remedying past wrongs. The eco-
nomic theory of negligence is therefore implicated in the ongoing
debate about whether tort law should be remedial, regulatory, or
both.

In addition, many who encounter the economic theory of negli-
gence find it repulsive because it seems to reduce the entire
accident problem, whether from a remedial or a regulatory stand-
point, to a question of money. Presumably the reasonably prudent
person takes action to avoid those accidents that are ‘‘worth”’
avoiding, and does not take action to avoid accidents that are not
“worth” avoiding. The whole question is what we should then take
into account in deciding which accidents these are. That was
Learned Hand’s point in Carroll Towing. However, the implication
of this point—that sometimes we will tolerate risking injury rather
than requiring that it be avoided—is not entirely comfortable, and
it is a fact about which many people are ambivalent.

Especially when this point is rephrased as a choice between
injury and money, many people are unwilling to go along, for a
number of reasons. These concerns, and possible responses, are as
follows. First, it is not clear that economic efficiency—understood
as maximizing resources and minimizing the waste of resources—is
necessarily a goal to be preferred over others. True enough. But
although the economic theory of negligence may err in its exclusive
focus on efficiency, it would be foolhardy to say that the law should
simply ignore the impact that its rules have on the allocation of
resources. Virtually everyone would agree that negligence law
shouldn’t encourage people to ‘‘waste’’ money on safety precau-
tions. If that is true, then the issue is when we would consider

73
TORT LAW

money wasted, not whether being efficient about the way the law
encourages people to spend money on safety is desirable. Whether
safety precautions are cost-effective might be something to take
into account—even if it were not the only thing.

Second, to be operational the economic theory of negligence
requires that we place a dollar value on human safety in order to
decide how much it is worth paying to avoid injury. It seems wrong
to value human safety only in this way. But whether we like it or
not, in tort law we are forced to place a monetary value on human
safety and physical well-being. For a jury to determine how much
compensation to award an injured plaintiff it must engage in
monetary valuation of precisely this kind. If a jury must do this in
order to make an award after it has decided that the defendant was
negligent, then it does not seem at all outrageous to imagine that
such a valuation would be made as part of the process of determin-
ing whether the defendant was negligent to begin with.

Finally, the notion that the factors that would figure in the
negligence calculus in many cases—human safety, convenience, the
value of jobs foregone, and so forth—can all be reduced to a single
currency of exchange and balanced against each other seems un-
realistic. Admittedly, it is unrealistic to suppose that all the factors
that could properly be taken into account under the negligence
calculus could very often be reduced to a monetary value and then
be accurately compared. Learned Hand himself recognized this
point early on, when he noted that his calculus required a choice
between “‘incommensurables’—things that cannot be compared.”
More than that, however, the factors that make up the negligence
calculus are likely in most cases to be difficult even to quantify, let
alone to compare with each other. Statistics about the probability of
particular kinds of injury in particular situations generally are not
available, and when such statistics are available their relevance is
debatable and their implications are complex. For example, the
probability of harm depends on the severity of the injury with
which one is concerned. Typically minor injury is a more probable
consequence of any risk than major injury. The cost of safety
precautions is likely to be easier to pinpoint on occasion, but not
always. As a consequence, the precise comparison of quantitative
values that seems to make the economic theory of negligence
unpalatable—the economic cost of avoiding injury as against the
economic benefit of doing so—will rarely be possible. Instead, as
Hand envisioned, more or less loose efforts at quantification ordi-

74
THE NEGLIGENCE STANDARD

narily can do no more than center attention on the factors that
might be determinative in a given case.

Even staunch opponents of the economic theory of negligence,
however, would do well to remember one additional point. Whether
or not tort law adopts an economic theory of negligence, the parties
that find themselves frequently involved as defendants in negli-
gence suits—most notably sizeable corporate enterprises—are likely
to behave in accordance with the theory. Even if the law were to
employ a thoroughly non-economic approach to negligence, such
defendants still would attempt in advance to compare the monetary
cost of risking liability for particular categories of injury against the
cost of taking safety precautions to reduce that risk. Such enter-
prises would attempt to avoid the accidents “‘worth”’ it to them to
avoid, but would prefer to incur liability for the accidents not
“worth” avoiding, because by taking this approach their liability
costs would be lower than their avoidance costs. They might not
always do this entirely in accordance with the negligence calculus,
however.’* For example, instead of taking optimal precautions, they
might act in a way that merely reduced their probability of losing
future suits, or decreased the amount of damages they could expect
to pay, perhaps by ensuring that they preserved the best evidence
supporting them or subjected low-income rather than high-income
people to risk.

Still, whether we like it or not, for those who are concerned
with deterrence, the economic theory of negligence is likely to be
relevant to tort law’s calculations about the best way to affect the
behavior of those whose actions risk causing accidents. In this sense
the theory is highly practical, for it predicts how defendants who
are economically motivated will behave in response to the threat of
liability for negligence, however that concept is defined.

C. A Boiled—Down Calculus: The Untaken Precaution

It is sometimes said that the plaintiff is under no obligation to
prove the particular safety measure that the defendant should have
employed; rather, the plaintiff need only prove that in acting as he
did, the defendant did not behave with reasonable care. This may
be true, but in most cases the plaintiff goes further, and actually
attempts to prove that there was a particular precaution that the
defendant should have taken, and that, more probably than not, if
this precaution had been taken the plaintiff would not have been

19. See Margo Schlanger, Second Best Damage Action Deterrence, 55 DePaut L.
Rev. 517 (2006).

75
TORT LAW

harmed.” Often the nature of the untaken precaution is obvious. If
a defendant allegedly was inattentive and collided with the plaintiff
at an intersection controlled by a traffic signal, the untaken precau-
tion is the defendant’s failure stop at the red light. Defendants who
have been momentarily inattentive should have been paying atten-
tion. This is where the possibility of requiring perfect compliance
with the reasonableness standard, referred to earlier, is implicated.
Although in theory the negligence standard could take the high cost
of achieving consistently reasonable conduct into account, that does
not necessarily occur. The law permits a jury to find that a driver
who takes his eyes off the road one time out of a hundred was
negligent for doing so, and most juries probably would find negli-
gence in this situation. In such cases, the implication is that the
reasonable person never fails to behave reasonably.

In many cases, however, the best way to show that the defen-
dant did not exercise reasonable care is to prove some less obvious
precaution or safety measure that was available, inexpensive, and
potentially effective. Disputes over the viability of an untaken
precaution are often at the core of negligence cases involving
activities with which jurors are not ordinarily familiar. Such dis-
putes often presuppose something like the negligence calculus, even
when it is not made explicit. The plaintiff points to a precaution
and proves—sometimes through expert testimony, sometimes not—
that it would have been easy enough for the defendant to have
taken the precaution, especially in light of the risk of severe injury
that the precaution would have reduced or avoided. Then the
defendant attempts to show that the precaution could not easily
have been employed, either because it would in fact be expensive, or
would interfere with the easy or safe conduct of the activity. The
dispute is formally about whether the reasonably prudent person
would have taken the precaution, but that dispute is informed by
evidence and argument about the factors that comprise the negli-
gence calculus. But of course the evidence may not be quantitative
in the way that the economic theory of negligence envisions.

IV. Custom

The rule governing “‘custom”’ is well-developed and reasonably
clear. Evidence of non-compliance with custom may be used offen-
sively (as a ‘‘sword”’) to show negligence, and evidence of compli-
ance with custom may be used defensively (as a “‘shield’’) to show
reasonable care. This evidence is relevant and admissible, but it is

20. See Mark F. Grady, Untaken Precautions, 18 J. Lecau Stup. 139 (1989).

76
THE NEGLIGENCE STANDARD

not dispositive. That is, even in the face of uncontradicted evidence
of a party’s compliance or non-compliance with custom, the jury
may find that the party’s action was or was not negligent.

Whether a particular practice is sufficiently widespread to
constitute a ‘“‘custom”’ may itself be in question. A practice need not
be universal to constitute a custom, although it must be more than
just one of a number of different practices. At the very least it must
be something done by most of those whose behavior is relevant to
the issue. If the practice in question does qualify as a custom, then
the party on whose behalf the evidence of compliance or non-
compliance was admitted is entitled to an instruction expressly
permitting the jury to consider the fact that there was compliance
or non-compliance with that custom. But even if a practice does not
qualify as a custom, evidence of non-compliance with a practice in
which some others engage may be admitted and considered by the
jury anyway. The plaintiff is certainly entitled to point to an
untaken precaution that he or she contends the reasonable person
would take. Evidence that some others take the precaution helps to
prove that it is reasonable to take it, even if it is not so widespread
as to be customary. Even if the evidence is not admissible on the
general question of negligence, it may be relevant to such questions
as the feasibility of taking the precaution or the foreseeability of
the risk that the precaution addresses. Thus, failing to prove that a
practice with which a party did not comply is a custom ordinarily
will not prevent the party from proving some of what he wishes—
that the other party failed to take a precaution that some others
take, although it probably will preclude showing how many others
take the precaution.”!

Why do we have a special rule about custom, when the effect of
the rule is simply to make custom evidence admissible? After all,
ordinarily we simply rely on the general rules of evidence, in
particular the rule that relevant evidence is admissible unless there
is a specific reason for rendering the evidence inadmissible, to
determine whether evidence that purports to prove or disprove
negligence, is admissible. Most tort law rules typically do not simply
confirm or provide for the admissibility of evidence. They actually
have some sort of binding effect. There are both historical and
substantive reasons for having a separate custom rule.

A. The History Behind the Custom Rule

21. Kenneth S. Abraham, Custom, Noncustomary Practice, and Negligence, 109
Co.um. L. Rev. 1784 (2009).

77
TORT LAW

The historical explanation for having a separate, merely evi-
dentiary rule about custom begins with the recognition that there
was a time when the now-dominant custom rule had two competi-
tors. Each of these rules addressed the significance of compliance
with custom. One competitor was the rule that compliance with
custom is conclusive on the issue of negligence. The leading case on
the subject held that business custom was the “unbending test of
negligence.” Under this rule, proof of compliance with custom
provided a safe harbor and resulted in a holding that the defendant
was free from negligence as a matter of law. The other competing
custom rule was that compliance with custom was irrelevant and
therefore that evidence of compliance was not even admissible.

The custom rule as we now know it competed with the safe-
harbor and irrelevance rules. The rule was reflected in a series of
19th century cases and was then enshrined in the canonical opinion
by Judge Hand in The T.J. Hooper.” In that case, the defendant
was an operator of tug boats towing barges that were lost in a
storm along with their cargo. The negligence alleged was the failure
to supply the tugs with radios which would have warned them of
the approaching storm. Although many tug boat captains carried
their own radios, the court concluded that it was not the custom of
tug owners to supply radios. Nonetheless, the court upheld a
finding of negligence on the part of the tug owner for failing to
supply radios: ‘Indeed in most cases reasonable prudence is in fact
common prudence; but strictly it is never its measure; a whole
calling may have unduly lagged in the adoption of new and avail-
able devices * * * [T]here are precautions so imperative that even
their universal disregard will not excuse their omission.’”’ The court
ruled that the failure to have radios was negligent as a matter of
law, but in most cases whether a whole calling is negligent would
be a jury question.

Thus, although the now-dominant custom rule is in a sense a
weak rule because it is merely evidentiary, its historical force is
stronger than appears on its face. Each of the rules that competed
with the custom rule that eventually gained dominance was a
strong rule. The safe-harbor rule was a per se no-liability rule. And
the irrelevance rule precluded the jury from even considering
custom. The modern, seemingly weak rule that merely makes
evidence of compliance with or departure from custom admissible

78
THE NEGLIGENCE STANDARD

but not conclusive is actually a strong rejection of both of the two
rules that once competed with it.

B. The Rationales for the Rule

Turning to the merits of the modern custom rule, we can
identify a number of arguments in its favor. First, custom may have
direct normative force. That is, based on experience and the author-
ity that comes with a widespread way of doing things, custom may
be probative of what constitutes reasonable care, because what is
generally done often tends to be what ought to be done. The jury is
therefore permitted, but not required, to get a reasonable care
“ought” from a customary “‘is.”” Moreover, holding somebody liable
for behaving like everyone else does (in the case of compliance with
custom) will often seem unfair. Like expert opinion, however,
evidence of custom is likely to be more persuasive when it is
explained and justified on the merits, rather than merely asserted
based on authority or general experience. The alternative to reli-
ance on custom as authority or experience, therefore, is reliance on
custom as confirmation of the proper cost-benefit determination.
Persuading a jury that a particular custom has probative weight
will therefore often require addressing the merits of the custom.
That is, the proponent of custom evidence will attempt to show that
the custom has been justifiably adopted, because the risks it poses
are outweighed by its benefits. Similarly, in order to refute the
normative force of custom evidence, the opponent of that evidence
will attempt to show that the custom is too risky—that it does not
satisfy a cost-benefit comparison.

Second, admitting evidence of compliance with custom cautions
the jury that if it finds that an actor was negligent despite compli-
ance with custom, the jury is in effect finding that an entire
industry, and not a single actor, is behaving unreasonably. On the
other hand, evidence of an actor’s departure from custom assures
the jury that in finding the conduct in question negligent it is not
finding that the conduct of an entire industry is unreasonable. Of
course, a party may be able to explain why he departed from the
custom of his industry: complying with custom may have been
dangerous under the circumstances, or he may reasonably (and
perhaps correctly) believe that his precautions are superior to
customary precautions. Third, evidence of compliance with custom
is some evidence of the lack of an opportunity to learn of other
precautions that might have been taken. And evidence of departure
from custom demonstrates a party’s opportunity to learn of a
feasible precaution that might have been taken.

79
TORT LAW

Fourth, in certain instances custom serves a coordinating func-
tion. Potential victims sometimes are aware of the customary
practices of potential injurers. On this basis potential victims can
make judgments about the necessary levels of self-protective care
they should take themselves. Non-compliance with custom may
thus tend to show negligence if the plaintiff can also show that the
defendant knew or should have known that potential victims were
relying on the defendant’s taking customary precautions. Similarly,
proof of compliance with custom may show that the defendant took
the precautions that potential victims generally anticipate, and
therefore may tend to show that the defendant’s behavior was
reasonable.

It could certainly be argued that, on average, departure from
custom is more probative than evidence of compliance. An entire
industry may well be negligent, but it would be rare indeed for an
entire industry to exercise more care than is reasonable. Self-
interested actors tend not to invest more in safety than they expect
the law requires. There is therefore a potential argument for
privileging evidence of departure from custom over evidence of
compliance with custom. Some actors who depart from custom,
however, do so not by exercising less care than is customary, but by
exercising a different form of care than is customary. Evidence of
sub-conformity is likely to be more probative than evidence of non-
conformity, because a non-conforming practice may well be just as
safe as the custom, whereas a sub-conforming practice is by defini-
tion less safe than the custom. But applying this distinction be-
tween sub-conformity to custom and non-conformity with custom
would be necessary to invoke a rule that privileged evidence of
departure from custom, and it would be administratively costly to
do that. That may be a reason why we don’t require that the two be
distinguished.

Finally, the legal system also has an interest in promoting
reliable and accurate decisions about whether conduct is or is not
negligent. A trial with no evidence about how others engage in the
same activity as the defendant would be curiously devoid of infor-
mation that would be considered to relevant to decision making in
almost any other context. Almost the first thing that most people
deciding how to do something consider is how other people do it. As
negligence cases move from simple to complex activities, from the
familiar to the unfamiliar, juries need increasing assistance in
understanding the nature of the activities under scrutiny and in
forming judgments about the way in which to evaluate the degree
of care that it is reasonable to employ in conducting these activities.
Many jurors in the nineteenth century were capable of making such

80
THE NEGLIGENCE STANDARD

judgments about farming accidents almost without assistance, just
as modern jurors are readily capable of determining whether the
defendant in a run-of-the-mill automobile collision drove reason-
ably. But modern jurors are likely to know a lot less, for example,
about the shipping industry, or about the various advantages and
disadvantages of shatterproof glass. Evidence of industry custom—
as well as of non-compliance with custom—can help to educate
jurors about these activities and thereby to put them in a position
to make more informed decisions.

V. Malpractice

In contrast to the rules that apply in ordinary negligence cases,
different rules govern the conduct of professionals, including physi-
cians, attorneys, and accountants. Most of the ‘“‘action”’ in this field
today involves medical malpractice, although in the future the
continuing growth of the American service economy may spawn
suits in a variety of fields. Medical malpractice litigation has grown
exponentially in the last several decades. In 1960 across the nation,
physicians and hospitals paid under $100 million for insurance
against liability for medical malpractice—a rough measure of the
direct cost of medical malpractice litigation. In contrast, over fifty
years later, physicians and hospitals are paying more than $10
billion annually for such insurance—an increase of about 10,000
percent. A variety of factors have contributed to this enormous
expansion in the cost of medical malpractice liability: legal changes
permitting more suits; increases in the cost of health care, which is
of course a component of the damages awarded for medical mal-
practice; the greater willingness of some people to bring suit
against physicians, some of whom are merely specialists with whom
the plaintiff has no longstanding relationship; the increased special-
ization and consequently greater ability of plaintiffs’ attorneys;
and, ironically, medical advances themselves, which create greater
opportunities for medical “‘error” than in the past.

A. The Special Standard of Care for Professionals

In ordinary negligence litigation, the failure to comply with
custom is not automatically negligent, and complying with custom
is not automatically reasonable care. In contrast, in cases involving
professionals, the majority rule is that compliance with custom
insulates the defendant from liability, and failure to comply with
professional custom is malpractice. A minority of jurisdictions seem
to follow a general reasonableness standard, which makes evidence

81
TORT LAW

of compliance or non-compliance with professional custom admissi-
ble but not dispositive. In medical malpractice, the standards of the
medical profession are the relevant ‘‘custom.”’ Thus, the plaintiff's
proof that the defendant committed malpractice consists of evi-
dence that the defendant violated a standard of the profession.
Conversely, the defendant’s case on the issue consists of evidence
that the defendant complied with the standards of the profession.
Indeed, in many jurisdictions a “‘two schools of thought’’ or “‘re-
spectable minority”’ rule obtains, under which non-compliance with
a standard rejected by much of the profession is not malpractice, as
long as the defendant complied with a school of thought or practice
followed by a respectable minority of practitioners.

What justifies so radical a departure from the treatment of
custom in ordinary negligence cases? The answer must lie in
necessity. As a general matter the activity that is the subject of
scrutiny in professional liability cases is considerably more complex,
and the jury is substantially less familiar with it, than the activities
that are the subject of ordinary negligence cases. In a medical
malpractice case, for example, to ask the jury to go beyond profes-
sional standards to determine whether it was reasonable for the
defendant to follow a particular medical course of treatment would
in effect ask for the jury’s medical judgment—something that no
member of the jury is likely to be capable of giving without relying
heavily on evidence of the relevant professional standard.

For the reader who thinks that this approach lets physicians
and other professionals off too easily, remember that the dispositive
effect of custom in medical malpractice cases cuts both ways:
although compliance with custom automatically insulates the physi-
cian from liability, deviation from custom is malpractice. One might
even argue that, to the extent that the justification for this overall
approach is the jury’s inability reliably to adjudicate cases involving
complex, technical, and scientific issues, the problem is not that
malpractice law departs from the normal treatment of custom, but
that the law ought to find a way to apply the approach to custom
taken in professional liability cases to complex cases involving non-
professional liability as well. After all, the jury is just as likely to be
at sea in making judgments about what constitutes reasonable care
in other technically complex and unfamiliar cases as it is in medical
malpractice cases. Yet largely for reasons of history and continuing
solicitude for professionals—one group of whom are appellate
judges who are former practicing lawyers—the special rule govern-
ing professional liability has not spread to other areas.

Another reason for the application of the special standard to
professionals alone is that in practice the standard may not operate

82
THE NEGLIGENCE STANDARD

so differently from ordinary cases. Like most legal issues, many
difficult medical issues cannot be resolved by reference to a defini-
tive, black-letter professional standard; medical judgment is re-
quired. Expert testimony therefore does not usually point to a
precise professional standard that governs the problem that the
defendant faced. Rather, experts for each side tend to testify about
what they would have done in the defendant’s place, and what they
believe good medical practice required. Often this kind of testimony
could be interpreted to be about medical custom and to trigger the
insulation from liability afforded by the “respectable minority”’ rule
referred to earlier. But a number of courts interpret such testimony
as being in conflict about what the prevailing medical standard
actually is, and leave that question to the jury. In addition, of
course, many malpractice cases turn heavily on disputed facts and
must therefore go the jury regardless of the prevailing standard of
care. Given the maze of facts and issues presented to it, the jury
may well give the court’s instruction on the respectable minority
rule less consideration than might otherwise be expected. This may
help to explain how it is possible that malpractice costs have risen
10,000 percent during a fifty-year period in which compliance with
custom purportedly has provided physicians with immunity from
malpractice liability.

B. The Demise of the ‘‘Locality’’ Rule

The demise of the locality rule is another factor that has
contributed to the escalating cost of medical malpractice liability.
That rule operated in the following way. Proof of the relevant
medical standards almost always is provided in the form of expert
testimony by physicians practicing in the defendant’s specialty.
Without such testimony the plaintiff could not survive the defen-
dant’s motion for a directed verdict or judgment as a matter of law,
since the jury is rarely familiar on its own with the relevant
standards. For many years this testimony had to come from a
physician competent to testify as to the medical standard prevailing
in the defendant’s own community. Often courts held that only a
physician actually practicing in that very community could provide
such testimony. This “strict locality’? rule made it extremely diffi-
cult for a potential plaintiff to secure an expert both competent and
willing to testify. In any locale where physicians knew each other
well and worked together, personal colleagues often were reluctant
to testify against each other. The result came to be called the
“conspiracy of silence,” since it often appeared to plaintiffs and
their attorneys that physicians “‘conspired”’ not to testify against

83
TORT LAW

their colleagues. When plaintiffs could not secure an expert witness
whose testimony would be admissible pursuant to the strict locality
rule and such a witness was a prerequisite to making out a prima
facie case, there was no point in going to trial, and sometimes no
point even in making a claim.

The strict locality rule may have made sense when medical
standards varied significantly from community to community, espe-
cially when the limited resources available in small communities
influenced or dictated the kind of treatment that could be provided.
As the degree of variation declined and medical standards became
increasingly uniform and national, however, the justification for the
strict locality rule diminished. At that point the rule served mainly
to place an artificial obstacle in the way of plaintiffs’ search for
experts willing to testify on their behalf. A rule that had once been
grounded in the substantive differences between localities became a
technical requirement without much substance to support it.

It is no surprise, therefore, that the rule broke down in a
variety of ways and then eventually disintegrated. For example,
some courts held that although the standard to be applied in
assessing the defendant’s conduct still was that of the locality in
which she practiced, physicians from other localities who had
familiarized themselves with the standards of the defendant’s local-
ity were competent to testify about those standards. Other courts
went further, holding that the strict locality rule was too restric-
tive, and that the appropriate test to measure the defendant’s
conduct was the standard of practice prevailing in the same locality
or localities ‘‘similar”’ to the locality where the defendant practiced.
With the increasing nationalization of medical standards, this ap-
proach is tantamount to the adoption of a national standard but
with a soft restriction on those who can testify to the standard,
perhaps with some leeway for taking into account any limitation on
resources available in smaller communities. Finally, many courts
(including some of those that first took only one of the intermediate
steps just described) have gone all the way in rejecting any form of
locality rule, holding instead that national standards govern and

that any expert familiar with such standards can testify about
them.

The result has been a much more freewheeling litigation envi-
ronment, in which some physicians have become professional wit-
nesses, spending most or even all of their time as experts in
litigation rather than practicing medicine. A number of states have
enacted rules limiting potential witnesses to those who still practice
medicine, or have other, advanced medical qualifications such as
board certification. In some states things have thus come full circle

84
THE NEGLIGENCE STANDARD

from the old days of the conspiracy of silence, and concern is
frequently voiced about excessive numbers of frivolous malpractice
suits. Although available data do not support the claim that more
than a small proportion of malpractice suits are completely ground-
less, other criticisms of the system can be made. For example, only
a fraction of those who are injured by medical malpractice actually
sue and obtain recoveries. Conversely, some of those who do obtain
recoveries appear, from a careful retrospective examination of their
records, not to have been the victims of malpractice. Apparently the
system is not terribly good at compensating deserving claimants,
and has mixed success at denying compensation to claimants whose
claims do not warrant it. In short, there is a considerable mismatch
between those who deserve compensation under the rules govern-
ing malpractice and those who receive compensation.

C. The Duty to Disclose and Informed Consent

Over time there has developed a cause of action distinct from
ordinary medical malpractice, based on the physician’s duty to
disclose relevant treatment-related information and the failure to
obtain the patient’s informed consent to treatment. The interest
protected by this cause of action is the patient’s right to determine
whether to take the risks associated with any given form of medical
treatment. A totally unconsented to treatment would of course
constitute battery. In contrast, actions for informed consent sound
in negligence or malpractice, for they involve the claim that al-
though the patient consented to treatment, consent was not suffi-
ciently informed because of the physician’s failure to provide the
patient with the requisite information about the risks and benefits
associated with the treatment.

1. Disclosure and Informed Consent Standards

Most medical treatments involve some risk. The treatment
itself may not succeed; pain, inconvenience, or disturbance of
normal bodily functions may accompany treatment; and some treat-
ments or procedures may risk serious, permanent side effects such
as incontinence or paralysis. The doctrine of informed consent
requires the physician to inform the patient of these risks, so that
the patient may decide whether to take the risks of submitting to
treatment, to seek alternative treatment, or to select no treatment
at all. Because for most people the decision whether to risk the
possible side effects of medical treatment depends on what is to be
gained from the treatment, the physician must also inform the
patient of the benefits of the treatment, including the probability

85
TORT LAW

that it will or will not be successful. Note that to prevail on a claim
sounding in informed consent the plaintiff need not show that the
treatment that was provided was malpractice. Rather, the plaintiff
may prevail even when the treatment was provided in accordance
with all relevant medical standards, if the treatment resulted in
bodily injury and if the plaintiff would have decided not to consent
to even properly provided treatment if he or she had been ade-
quately informed.

In recognizing the need to protect patients’ interests, however,
we must take care not to adopt too unrealistic a view of the process
by which informed consent is obtained. There is a difference
between an ‘‘informed” decision by the patient and an “‘indepen-
dent” decision by the patient. The doctrine of informed consent
attempts to secure the former, not the latter. Sometimes the
opinions in cases involving the doctrine speak as if the two were the
same, and that the physician’s disclosure of information transmits
to the patient everything needed for the patient to make a treat-
ment decision. This ultra-rationalistic model of patient decision-
making is unrealistic. Many patients who find that they have
serious medical problems become psychologically dependent on
others, including their physicians. This condition of dependency,
along with genuine ambivalence about what treatment to pursue, is
not compatible with the ultra-rationalistic model of patient deci-
sion. The doctrine of informed consent quite properly requires that
patients be informed of the risks and benefits of proposed treat-
ments. But patients in a condition of dependency and vulnerability
are unlikely simply to take the information and make entirely
independent decisions about treatment. They will want to talk at
length with their family and their physicians to obtain the opinion
of these other people about the right course of treatment to follow.
It may be that the most salutary function of the doctrine of
informed consent, therefore, is not simply to inform the patient,
but to help the patient’s physician, family, and friends to open an
informed dialogue with the patient about the course of treatment
that will best reflect and protect the patient’s values and concerns.

There are two different standards for determining whether the
requirements of the doctrine of informed consent have been satis-
fied. The reasonable-patient standard requires the physician to
disclose information about the risks and benefits of treatment that
a reasonable patient in what the physician knows to be the pa-
tient’s situation would wish to know.” This standard does not ask
the physician to be a mind-reader; if the patient has unusual

24. See Canterbury v. Spence, 464 F.2d 772 (D.C.Cir.1972).

86
THE NEGLIGENCE STANDARD

interests or concerns of which the physician is unaware, then
disclosure of information that a reasonable patient would not desire
but that this patient would in fact have desired is not required. If I
am a model for male earrings and therefore cannot risk scarring to
my ear under circumstances that would not trouble the ordinary
patient, then my physician is not liable for failing to disclose the
risk of scarring if she has no reason to be aware of my idiosyncratic
situation. On the other hand, once the physician knows of the
patient’s unusual interests or concerns, then the disclosure neces-
sary to satisfy those interests or concerns is required.

The reasonable-patient standard employs what amounts to an
ordinary negligence test to determine whether proper disclosure
has been made and informed consent has been obtained. Evidence
of medical standards regarding information disclosure may be rele-
vant in actions brought under this standard, but is not dispositive:
under the reasonable-patient standard, the failure to obtain in-
formed consent is not actionable as malpractice, but as negligence.
Consequently, expert testimony still is ordinarily required in order
to establish what the risks and benefits of the treatment in ques-
tion were; but there need be no expert testimony regarding the
defendant’s violation of the standard of care because the jury,
having heard this expert testimony, is then in a position to deter-
mine what a reasonable patient would have wanted to know under
the circumstances.

In contrast, under the reasonable-physician standard the fail-
ure to obtain the patient’s informed consent is actionable only as
malpractice. The plaintiff-patient must therefore meet the require-
ments of a malpractice action by proving that the defendant-
physician failed to comply with the standards of the profession
regarding disclosure of information to patients in the plaintiff's
position. Expert testimony is required not only as to the relevant
risks and benefits, but also as to the applicable medical standard
regarding disclosure of these risks and benefits.

On their face these two standards represent very different
philosophies. The reasonable-patient standard appears to put the
patient in complete control, rejecting medical determination of the
information to be disclosed. The reasonable-physician standard
seems to place the medical profession in control, permitting the
profession to determine what information the patient needs to
know. In practice, however, most contemporary physicians, simply
out of concern for their patients, tend to disclose the information
that they think their patients want, regardless of the jurisdiction in
which they practice. Consequently, the medical standard for disclo-
sure and patient desires for information are likely to converge,

87
TORT LAW

notwithstanding the logical possibility that under the reasonable-
physician standard the profession as a whole could decide to dis-
close only a little information, without fear of liability. In fact, the
courts probably would not be comfortable with the reasonable-
physician standard if that were to occur. The major differences
between the two approaches, therefore, lie in the requirement that
there be expert testimony as to the applicable standard of disclo-
sure under the reasonable-physician standard, and in the possibility
that liability will be imposed less often under that standard where
the respectable-minority rule applies.

2. Causation in Informed Consent Cases

Even after the plaintiff has proved the failure of the defendant
to make proper information disclosure, proof of a causal connection
between that failure and the plaintiff's injury is required. The
matter of causation is the subject of another Chapter, but a brief
exploration here helps to tell us a bit more about informed consent.
To prove causation, the plaintiff must show that “but for” the
defendant’s failure to disclose the requisite information, the plain-
tiff would not have suffered the harm resulting from the treatment
provided. Ordinarily this means that the plaintiff must show that
he would have declined the treatment that caused his injury if he
had been given the requisite information about the risks posed by
the treatment. Some courts also require the plaintiff to show that
the treatment he would have selected (including no treatment)
would have caused less injury.

Proving causation in an informed consent case often is difficult,
because many people—perhaps most—take the advice of their phy-
sician even after he or she has disclosed the information required
by the doctrine of informed consent. People are likely to decide to
follow a physician’s advice except in two situations: when there are
two plausible courses of treatment and the physician recommends
one but believes the other also to be reasonable; and when the
patient is sufficiently idiosyncratic that the physician’s sense of
what risks are worth taking and the individual’s sense of this are
very different. Of course, the plaintiff would not even be suing if
she did not contend that, had the requisite information been
disclosed, she would have chosen a different course of treatment.
Consequently, the plaintiff's own conclusory testimony on this
score may not be worth very much as proof for the jury.

Many courts have therefore adopted what amounts to an
objective standard governing the causation issue. There are two
views of what this standard entails. Under what might be called the
fully-objective standard, the test is what an objectively reasonable

88
THE NEGLIGENCE STANDARD

person without the plaintiff's idiosyncrasies and particular prefer-
ences would have done if she had been appropriately informed. This
approach makes it unnecessary for the jury to sift through the
plaintiff's contentions about what her idiosyncracies actually were.
But of course the price for avoiding this complexity is that some-
times the plaintiff will be unable to recover, even though she would
in fact have declined the treatment—i.e., even though the defen-
dant’s failure to obtain informed consent was in fact the cause of
the plaintiff's harm.

In contrast, under what might be called the semi-objective
view, the test is whether a reasonable person in the plaintiff's
position would have declined treatment if the requisite information
on risks and benefits had been disclosed. The plaintiff is permitted
to testify, and her idiosyncracies and preferences are relevant, but
her testimony is simply one piece of evidence for the jury about
what she would have done had her informed consent been properly
sought. With the benefit of hindsight the plaintiff may now believe
that she would have declined treatment; but the question for the
jury is what a reasonable person in the plaintiff’s position would
have done. In this regard the plaintiff's testimony can be either
almost useless or extraordinarily helpful. If the plaintiff merely
asserts that she would have disregarded her physician’s advice, but
without providing a persuasive explanation for this contention, the
jury may regard the testimony as merely self-serving. But if the
plaintiff identifies a previously documented or manifested idiosyn-
cracy or value that would have caused her to disregard her physi-
cian’s advice, such testimony can be very persuasive. The plaintiff
may have an unusual concern about scarring, or prefer a shorter
life expectancy without the rigors of chemotherapy. As the court in
Scott v. Bradford put it, ‘‘the causation question must be resolved
by examining the credibility of the plaintiff's testimony.’ If these
sorts of idiosyncracies or values asserted by the plaintiff can be
corroborated through evidence about plaintiff's past behavior or
even serious conversations with others in the past reflecting these
values or idiosyncracies, then the plaintiff's testimony will be all
the more credible. For example, suppose that the plaintiff’s close
friend testifies that they had engaged in many conversations over
the years about the pride the plaintiff took in her left profile. Under
these circumstances the plaintiff's testimony that she would have
rejected surgery on her left cheek if she had been informed of the
risk of scarring would have greater credibility than it would other-
wise.

89
TORT LAW

These considerations suggest that there are really two different
interests that may be protected by the doctrine of informed con-
sent. First, by using a semi-objective test for causation, the doctrine
can protect the interest of patients who do not share the values of
their physicians or of most patients, and who would therefore act
differently from the ordinary patient if adequately informed of the
risks and benefits of proposed treatment. Second, even if the test
for causation is fully objective, the doctrine can encourage the
dissemination of information to the great mass of ‘‘ordinary”’
patients who will take their physicians’ advice with or without the
information, but whose autonomous right to make informed deci-
sions is promoted by encouraging physicians to make fuller disclo-
sure of the risks and benefits of treatment.

D. Medical Malpractice Reform

The rising cost of malpractice insurance and the concern of
physicians about the threat of liability have led some states, over a
period of decades, to enact statutory reforms of medical malpractice
law. The statutes address a variety of doctrines and practices, some
of which are discussed generally in subsequent Chapters. Major
reforms affect the qualifications of expert witnesses, limit the
application of the doctrine res ipsa loquitur (Chapter Four), place
monetary ceilings on the amount that may be awarded as damages
for pain and suffering (Chapter Ten), reform the collateral source
rule (Chapter Ten), require the submission of cases to pre-trial
screening panels that make non-binding decisions, specify the per-
centage of a recovery that attorneys for plaintiffs may charge, and
restrict the application of joint-and-several liability (Chapter Five).

Aside from the adoption of monetary ceilings on damages in
malpractice cases, empirical studies suggest that the reforms have a
modest or no effect on the cost of insurance or on the amounts
awarded in malpractice cases. Nonetheless, medical malpractice
reform periodically finds a place in debate about tort reform that is
out of proportion to its direct economic importance, which is about
two percent of the cost of health care in the United States. One
reason is that medical malpractice liability has an indirect economic
impact. Physicians sometimes engage in ‘“‘defensive medicine’’—the
ordering of laboratory or other tests which they would not order
were it not for the threat of liability. The cost of defensive medicine
is unclear, though it may be a multiple of the amount spent on
medical malpractice insurance itself—$40 billion a year, as com-
pared to $10 billion a year for malpractice insurance. Of course,
some defensive medicine is ‘‘positive,”’ reflecting expenditures that

90
THE NEGLIGENCE STANDARD

are desirable and that the threat of liability encourages. Other
defensive medicine is “‘negative,’’ reflecting unnecessary and unde-
sirable testing that physicians think makes legal, but not medical,
sense to order.

Another explanation for the prominence of medical malpractice
reform proposals is that physicians occupy a critical place in the
health care structure. Thus, when obstetricians decide not to deliv-
er babies any more because of the high cost of malpractice insur-
ance, their decision gets considerable attention, for obvious reasons.

Finally, medical societies and other physicians’ organizations
are able to exercise political influence that individual practitioners
could not exercise. As a consequence of these and other factors, it
seems likely that medical malpractice law will continue to occupy a
place on the reform “‘agenda,”’ and that more fundamental reforms
(of the sort discussed in Chapter Twelve) that do not alter tort
liability, but create a substitute for it, will be considered and
perhaps even adopted in the future.

VI. Violation of Statutes

We live in an age of statutes. For this reason, many acts alleged
to be negligent also violate statutes. Federal statutes are sometimes
held to preempt (i.e., preclude) the imposition of state tort liability,
either expressly or by strong implication. Most preemption cases
involve products liability, a subject addressed in Chapter Nine,
where preemption is also discussed.

Conversely, from time to time statutes create civil liability for
their violation, again expressly or by implication. Most statutes say
nothing, however, expressly or impliedly, about the role their
violation is to play in tort actions. The standard approach in this
situation holds that the unexcused violation of a statute designed to
promote safety is negligence ‘‘per se’’—that is, negligence as a
matter of law. A minority of states hold that violation of a statute is
not negligent per se, but evidence of violation is admissible and
relevant. And all states hold that evidence of compliance with a
statute is admissible, although such evidence usually does not have
much weight, because statutes only prescribe minimum standards.
Reasonable care may require more than mere compliance with a
statutory requirement.

The majority, negligence per se rule was enunciated by Judge
Cardozo in the famous case of Martin v. Herzog.” If the legislature
actually provided in each statute it enacted that there shall be an

26. 126 N.E. 814 (1920).

91
TORT LAW

action in tort for injuries caused by violation of the statute, then
the reason for this standard approach would be easy to see. But as
noted above, most statutes do not contain such provisions. Occa-
sionally statutes provide for such causes of action, but more often
they provide only for criminal penalties in the event of violation.
One might even speculate—though probably inaccurately—that
since the legislature knows how to include a cause of action for
statutory violation in the laws it enacts, the absence of such
provision should be taken as an expression of legislative intent that
there be no such cause of action. Consequently, legislative intent is
not a satisfactory explanation of the rule that violation of a statute
is negligence per se.

It is more accurate to understand the negligence per se rule as
a common law creation, based on the notion that the reasonable
person does not violate statutes. The result is that in the ordinary
case, the jury is not permitted to decide whether the violation of a
statute was or was not negligent: the unexcused violation of a
statute is negligence. In some jurisdictions the rule also applies to
the violation of administrative regulations and municipal ordi-
nances, though often such violations are only considered evidence
of negligence. In any event, since sometimes the violation of a
statute can be ‘“‘excused,” technically there is only a presumption
that violation of a statute is negligence per se. Under this formula-
tion, in the absence of a competent excuse the jury is required in
the majority of states to find that violation of a statute is negligent.
In the minority that do not apply the negligence per se rule,
virtually all putative excuses are admissible and subject to consider-
ation by the jury.

A. Legally Cognizable Excuses

Under the negligence per se rule a great deal may then turn on
when a party may be ‘‘excused”’ for the violation of a statute. The
conventional categories of excuse are somewhat opaque: necessity,
incapacity, and emergency. The cases themselves, however, shed
some light on their meaning. Children are excused if they are
incapable of complying with a statute; reasonable efforts at compli-
ance by adults, even when there is a violation, are sometimes
sufficient; if an individual does not have a reasonable opportunity
to know of factual circumstances that make a statute applicable, he
may be excused; and if noncompliance is safer, then the excuse of
emergency may be available. For example, in Tedla v. Ellman,” the

27. 19 N.E.2d 987 (1939).

92
THE NEGLIGENCE STANDARD

plaintiff was struck by the defendant’s vehicle while she was
walking with her back to the traffic on her side of a road instead of
walking with her face to the traffic on the other side of the road, as
a statute required. The plaintiff argued that she was not negligent,
because on that day the traffic was much heavier on the side of the
highway where the statute seemed to require her to walk, and that
it would therefore have been much more dangerous for her to
comply with the statute than to violate it. In an opinion not
distinguished for its clarity, the court agreed, seeming at least in
part to suggest that a statute (such as the one in question) that
codifies a common law rule rather than reversing it should be read
to contain an implied exception for cases in which compliance with
the statute would involve a greater risk of harm than violation. But
it may also be sensible to think of Tedla as involving the excuse of
necessity.

The significance of these categories is not simply that they are
limited, but also that they provide the courts with a means of
ruling out some putative excuses as a matter of law. In negligence
per se states, merely because the defendant contends that his
statutory violation was excused does not mean that the excuse issue
goes to the jury. If the defendant testified that he was speeding
because he was driving his son to school and they were late, the
court would almost certainly rule that the defendant’s putative
excuse is not legally cognizable. In the absence of any factual
dispute as to violation, therefore, the defendant would be negligent
per se.

B. The Defense of Limited Statutory Purpose

A second defense permits the defendant to show that the
plaintiff was not in the class of persons, or did not suffer the type of
harm, intended to be protected by the statute that the defendant
violated. For example, in Di Caprio v. New York Central Railway
Co.,"= the defendant violated a statute requiring that fences be
erected to keep livestock off its tracks. There was no recovery when
the plaintiff's young son was killed after wandering onto the tracks,
because protection against this risk was not the object of the
statute.

Despite the theoretical availability of this defense in cases
involving violation of statute, the defense rarely prevails in prac-
tice. Statutes usually do not carry their purposes on their face.
Rather, their purpose is a matter of judgment and of judicial

28. 131 N.E. 746 (1921).

93
TORT LAW

construction. Unless the plaintiff could not by any stretch of the
imagination have been an intended beneficiary of the statute’s
protection, modern courts are likely to hold that at least a “‘second-
ary” purpose of the statute was to protect individuals in the
plaintiff's situation. There are a number of cases in which defen-
dants have violated statutes apparently designed mainly for the
protection of persons other than the plaintiff, yet the courts hold
that those in the plaintiffs’ situation do fall within the class of
those protected. For example, ‘‘dram shop”’ statutes in many states
prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages to those who appear to be
inebriated. In a number of cases the individual who has been served
in violation of the statute is shortly thereafter involved in an auto
accident in which a third party is injured. The plaintiff third party
then sues both the driver and the server, and the server’s defense is
that the statutory protection does not extend to the plaintiff. Many
courts reject this defense, construing the statutory purpose broad-
ly.” Similarly, statutes or municipal ordinances sometimes prohibit
leaving vehicles parked with keys in the ignition. When a thief
steals a vehicle parked with a key in the ignition and his negligent
driving injures the plaintiff, the courts typically hold that the
purpose of these enactments is not only to protect the vehicle’s
owner, but also to protect those who might be injured by the
negligent driving of the thief. The defense of limited statutory
purpose therefore does not protect the owner or custodian of the
vehicle in a suit by a third party injured by the thief’s negligent
driving.”

There are two ways of predicting how the courts will rule on
this scope-of-statutory-purpose issue. The first is to see whether
there is legislative history or a preamble to the statute in question,
indicating its purpose or purposes. If there is any reference at all to
those in the plaintiff’s situation, then the courts are highly likely to
find that the plaintiff is an intended beneficiary, or that the
plaintiff suffered the type of harm contemplated by the statute. The
absence of such reference, however, is not determinative: the courts
may still find one or both to be the case.

The second predictor is more complicated. If violation of the
statute does not at all increase the risk of harm to those in the
plaintiff's situation, then the courts are very unlikely to hold that
the plaintiff is an intended beneficiary. It would not be sensible to
say that a statute is intended to protect a particular class of persons
if violation of the statute does not increase the risk to those in the

29. See, e.g., Vesely v. Sager, 486 P.2d 151 (1971).
30. See, e.g., Ross v. Hartman, 139 F.2d 14 (D.C.Cir.1943).

94
THE NEGLIGENCE STANDARD

class. For instance, suppose that I borrow your car and the car is
damaged by lightning while I am exceeding the speed limit. I am
negligent per se; and if I had not been speeding, the car probably
would not have been damaged by the lightning, because it would
have been at a different place when lightning struck. Violating the
statute, however, did not increase the risk of lightning damage;
therefore you are not in the class of intended beneficiaries, at least
as to this risk. In contrast, if violating a statute does increase the
risk of harm to those in the plaintiff's situation—such as the
plaintiffs in the dram-shop and key-in-the-ignition cases—then the
courts may well hold that the plaintiff falls within the class of the
statute’s intended beneficiaries. The greater the increase of risk to
those in the plaintiff's situation resulting from a violation of the
statute, the greater the probability that the court will hold that the
statute protects the plaintiff. All this sometimes takes place under
the rubric of ‘‘proximate cause” (a subject that we take up in
Chapter Six) rather than negligence per se, but the analysis is
essentially the same.

VII. Negligence and No Negligence as a Matter
of Law: The Roles of Judge and Jury

Thus far we have been exploring the ways that the law pours
meaning into the concept of negligence, largely in order to assist
the jury in making the negligence determination. This exploration
has assumed that the jury ordinarily makes that determination.
But that is not always the case. First, there is a class of cases in
which the defendant is not liable for negligence. An example
involves a landowner’s limited duty to trespassers. A landowner is
not liable to a trespasser for injury caused by the failure of the
landowner to exercise reasonable care, but only for injury caused by
wanton and wilful misconduct. Duty and no-duty questions such as
this are typically decided by the court as a matter of law. These no-
duty cases are the subject of Chapter Eleven, which addresses
affirmative and limited duty.

Second, even when the defendant has a duty to exercise reason-
able care to persons in the plaintiff’s position, there are cases in
which, as a matter of law, the defendant did, or did not, breach that
duty. For example, as we have already seen, in the case of the
violation of statutes that decision is kept from the jury and made by
the court as a matter of law. But there is also a general rule about
whether an issue is or is not a jury question. Issues are submitted
for decision by the jury if “‘reasonable people could disagree’”’ about
the resolution of the issue. And issues are decided by the court as a

95
TORT LAW

matter of law if “reasonable people could not disagree.” This rule
applies both to pure questions of fact (ie., entirely empirical issues)
and to mixed questions of fact and law, such as whether a party
was negligent—that is, whether the party breached its duty to
exercise reasonable care.

The decision whether a particular issue poses a jury question is
made at trial through rulings on motions for a directed verdict and,
in more complicated situations, through jury instructions. For
example, if there is uncontradicted evidence that I drove blindfold-
ed down Main Street and collided with the plaintiff's vehicle, then
whether I was negligent will not be a jury question. Rather, at the
close of the evidence the court would grant the plaintiff's motion
for a directed verdict on the issue of my negligence. Reasonable
people could not disagree that I was negligent. But if the factual
question whether I drove blindfolded is in dispute, then the court
could not simply grant a directed verdict on the issue. Instead, the
jury will be instructed that, if it finds that I drove blindfolded, then

it must find that I was negligent, because driving blindfolded is
negligent as a matter of law.

This is, in effect, lawmaking by the courts about what consti-
tutes negligence. In granting a motion for a directed verdict on the
negligence issue, a court is not ruling that a jury would not find for
the defendant, but that the jury should not and therefore may not
so find, because it would be unreasonable to do so. There is of
course an element of judgment involved in the granting of directed
verdicts on mixed questions of fact and law. The judgments of
different trial courts on such questions involving the same or
similar sets of facts are therefore harmonized through the appellate
process. Whether a directed verdict should have been granted is a
question of law that can be reviewed and decided on appeal. Over
time, this process of review can give the trial courts guidance
regarding the kinds of questions that should and should not be
submitted to juries. If the rationale for ruling that particular
behavior was or was not negligent as a matter of law is broadly
applicable (e.g., that it is negligent to drive blindfolded, or to violate
statutes), then the decision in effect creates a rule of law about that
conduct. On the other hand, if the rationale for the decision is
applicable only to the unique set of facts presented in the case, then
it is more in the nature of a ruling that there was negligence (i.e.,

breach) as a matter of law in this case than it is a rule with any
generality.

There is also considerable significance in a decision to deny a
motion for a directed verdict, that is, to decline to rule that conduct
was or was not negligent as a matter of law. In holding that

96
THE NEGLIGENCE STANDARD

reasonable people could disagree about the negligence issue in a
particular case, a court is necessarily implying that a decision for
either the plaintiff or for the defendant would be acceptable. Since
the only precedent set by such a holding is that the facts of the case
pose a jury question, it follows further that if the same situation
arose again, it would be acceptable for a different jury to decide the
issue differently. This is hardly a prescription for deciding like cases
alike, notwithstanding that such treatment is a core principle in
our system. The only equal treatment that like negligence cases
receive in this respect is that they are submitted to the jury for
decision.

Over a century ago, writing in THE Common Law, Holmes
argued that this state of affairs was unacceptable:

But supposing a state of facts often repeated in practice, is
it to be imagined that the court is to go on leaving the standard
to the jury forever? Is it not manifest, on the contrary, that if
the jury is, on the whole, as fair a tribunal as it is represented
to be, the lesson which can be got from that source will be
learned? Either the court will find that the fair teaching of
experience is that the conduct complained of usually is or is not
blameworthy, and therefore, unless explained, is or is not a
ground of liability; or it will find the jury oscillating to and fro,
and will see the necessity of making up its mind for itself.

Nearly four decades later, as a Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court,
Holmes put his idea into practice in Baltimore and Ohio R.R. v.
Goodman." Goodman was killed when the truck he was driving was
struck by the defendant railroad’s train at a grade crossing. The
railroad’s defense was that Goodman was negligent as a matter of
law and that since contributory (i.e., the plaintiff's) negligence was
then a complete defense, the case could not go to the jury. The trial
court denied the railroad’s motion for a directed verdict in its favor,
and submitted the issue (plus others) to the jury, which found for
the plaintiff. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed, holding that ‘“‘noth-
ing is suggested by the evidence to relieve Goodman of responsibili-
ty for his own death” and that, if necessary, someone in Goodman’s
situation “must stop and get out of his vehicle, although obviously
he will not often be required to do more than to stop and look.”
Thus, the Supreme Court held that a directed verdict should have
been granted for the defendant because the plaintiff was negligent
as a matter of law. It is probably not entirely a coincidence that the
rule in Goodman meant that the U.S. Supreme Court, in that pre-
Erie era in which appeals of tort suits involving diversity of

31. 275 US. 66, 48 S.Ct. 24, 72 L.Ed. 167 (1927).

97
TORT LAW

citizenship came to the Court, would be presented with fewer such
suits.

Seven years later, however, Holmes’ ideal of a set of rules
about what counts as breach of the duty to exercise reasonable care
that could be applied without the need for jury decisions and their
accompanying variability was dealt what has turned out to be a
fatal blow. In Pokora v. Wabash Railway Co.,” the U.S. Supreme
Court was faced with a similar though not identical fact situation.
The trial court directed a verdict for the defendant on the authority
of Goodman. In an opinion by Justice Cardozo the Supreme Court
reversed, noting that

Standards of prudent conduct are declared at times by the
courts, but they are taken over from the facts of life. To get out
of a vehicle and reconnoitre is an uncommon precaution, as
everyday experience informs us. * * * In default of the guide of
customary conduct, what is suitable for the traveler caught in a
mesh where the ordinary safeguards fail him is for the judg-
ment of a jury.”

In effect, the Court said that the plaintiff in Goodman may
have been contributorily negligent as a matter of law given the
particular facts of his case, but that it does not follow that everyone
who has not stopped, looked, listened and (if necessary) gotten out

of his car at a railroad crossing is contributorily negligent. That
depends on the circumstances.

The move from Goodman to Pokora reflects the treatment that
Holmes’ view has received generally. There has not been a tendency
over time for rules of law to develop regarding the kind of behavior
that is and is not negligent. Rather, if anything, the courts’ inclina-
tion has been to leave juries with even greater discretion and to
grant fewer directed verdicts.

This entire issue involves the distinction between rules and
standards that was referred to in Chapter One. Rules are compara-
tively concrete, comparatively self-applying norms. Standards are
more general norms that require comparatively more judgment and
discretion for application. Each has its particular characteristics.
Rules facilitate predictability of outcome and therefore are likely to
produce more settlements. Rules more easily treat like cases alike.
Rules have a greater capacity to avoid the dangers inherent in the
exercise of discretion, including prejudice. And in negligence cases,
rules may circumvent the conundrum of when inadvertence is

32. 292 U.S. 98, 54 S.Ct. 580, 78 L.Ed. 1149 (1934).
33. 292 U.S. at 104-06, 54 S.Ct. at 582.

98
THE NEGLIGENCE STANDARD

negligent and when it is not. This is because a rule that a particular
form of conduct is or is not negligent as a matter of law makes the
reason the conduct occurred immaterial. Whether violation of a
safety statute was inadvertent or deliberate, it is negligent per se
unless excused.

In contrast to rules, standards permit greater flexibility. They
leave more room for nuanced distinctions between fact situations.
And they are more conducive to doing justice, all things considered.
Of course, these are pure types. In fact there is a continuum
running from pure rules at a high level of generality on one end, to
pure under-all-the-cireumstances standards on the other. In the
time since Holmes wrote and recommended the greater use of
directed verdicts, with the implication that there should be a
greater use of rules, the tendency has been to reject his reeommen-
dation.

There are two reasons why things have developed this way.
First, fact situations that are sufficiently similar to warrant the
development of rules of law governing them have not recurred.
Instead, the courts have usually concluded—as did Justice Cardozo
in Pokora—that reasonable people could consider the factual varia-
tions between cases such as Goodman and Pokora to be sufficiently
important to permit juries to decide them differently. Just as not
every railroad grade-crossing accident is the same, so not every
lane-changing automobile accident and not every slip-and-fall case
is the same. Second, it is both politically less dangerous and less
elitist for elected judges (and most state judges, who hear most tort
cases, must stand for re-election) to leave close decisions about
norms of behavior to juries rather than deciding these issues
themselves. In the long run such decisions probably have greater
preceived legitimacy and help to reduce the influence of politics on
the outcome of tort claims.

However, the kinds of cases in which the position Holmes took
is most satisfactory are precisely those that are constantly recur-
ring because they arise out of precisely the same facts. For example,
in Andrews v. United Airlines, Inc.,*4 the court ruled that whether
the defendant had breached its duty to maintain safe overhead bins
on its airplanes was a question for the jury. Since bins are identical
on all of the same model of aircraft, this is likely to be a recurring
question. Similarly, the modern, mass tort or class action cases in
which the same product or behavior is alleged to have injured large
numbers of people raise recurring questions. If these kinds of cases
are tried individually, then the question of the defendant’s negli-

34, 24 F.3d 39 (9th Cir. 1994).

99
TORT LAW

gence must be submitted to different juries dozens or hundreds of
times, and the same action or product design can be judged negli-
gent or not negligent by many different juries. If, for example, a
defendant failed to warn purchasers and other users of the dangers
of exposure to asbestos in 1963, many commentators would argue
that at some point that behavior should be judged either negligent
or not once-and-for-all, rather than permitting dozens of juries to
“oscillate to and fro” on the issue, as Holmes put it. The courts
have tried to find ways to give a definitive answer, but through only
partially effective modern procedural devices such as collateral
estoppel and class actions, rather than through the rules of law that
Holmes envisioned.

PRooF OF NEGLIGENCE

Ordinarily there is nothing distinctive about proving negli-
gence. The plaintiff introduces direct evidence of the defendant’s
behavior and contends that the defendant failed to take a precau-
tion that it would have been reasonable to take. This may be real
physical evidence (e.g., a misassembled tool), demonstrative evi-
dence (e.g., a video of the accident), or eyewitness testimony.
Sometimes, however, direct evidence of what the defendant did or
did not do is unavailable. In such cases negligence is not proved
directly, but by circumstantial evidence. This Chapter is about how
negligence is proved in cases such as this, and about a doctrine that
is sometimes used in aid of proving negligence—res ipsa loquitur, or
literally “‘the thing speaks for itself.’ In order to understand proof
of negligence by circumstantial evidence, as well as res ipsa, it is
necessary first to understand the allocation of the burden of proof
in negligence and other tort cases generally.

I. The Burden of Proof
A. Burdens in the Ordinary Case

The plaintiff in a tort suit bears the burden of proof on each
element of his case. That burden is composed of two parts: the
burden of production and the burden of persuasion. The burden of
production is sometimes termed the burden of ‘‘going forward with
the evidence.” After all the plaintiff's evidence is introduced, that
evidence must be capable of supporting an inference by the jury
that the defendant breached the applicable standard of care, that
the plaintiff suffered injury or loss, and that the defendant’s breach
caused this injury or loss. In negligence cases, of course, the
plaintiff must prove breach by showing that the defendant was
negligent. This means that based on the evidence an inference of
negligence must be permissible, not that such an inference is
required. Satisfying the burden of production is sometimes referred
to as making out a prima facie case.

The decision whether the plaintiff has satisfied the burden of
production is made by the court, which makes this decision by
ruling on the “‘legal sufficiency’’ of the evidence. If the evidence is

101
TORT LAW

legally sufficient on all elements—if ‘‘reasonable people could dis-
agree’’ as to each element—then a motion for a directed verdict by
the defendant at the close of the plaintiff's case is denied. If the
evidence is legally insufficient on one or more elements, then the
defendant’s motion for a directed verdict is granted. In contrast to
the legal sufficiency question, the jury actually determines the
‘“‘weight”’ of the evidence. Merely because the evidence is legally
sufficient to permit an inference of negligence does not mean that
the jury is required to draw that inference. When an inference of
negligence is merely permissible then an inference of no negligence
also is permissible.

Once the burden of production is met and the evidence goes to
the jury, the plaintiff bears the burden of persuasion. The jury is
instructed that the plaintiff has satisfied this burden only if it is
persuaded by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant
breached the applicable standard of care, that the plaintiff suffered
injury or loss, and that the defendant’s breach caused this injury or
loss. If, for example, the jury finds that it is only as probable as not
that the defendant was breached the applicable standard of care
(that the evidence as to this element is ‘‘in equipoise’’), then the
plaintiff has not satisfied the burden of persuasion. The jury must
be persuaded that the defendant ‘‘more probably than not’’ breach-
ed the applicable standard of care, or the plaintiff has not satisfied
her burden of persuading the jury by a preponderance of the
evidence.

It is sometimes observed that this approach ignores the mathe-
matical theorem that the probability that each of a series of
independent propositions is true is the product of their separate
probabilities. Thus, if the probability that 1) the defendant was
negligent, 2) the plaintiff suffered an injury, and 3) the defendant’s
negligence caused the plaintiff's injury were each 75 percent, then
the probability that the defendant was negligent and caused an
injury to the plaintiff would be roughly 42 percent (.75 x .75 x .75
= .421875) and—speaking mathematically alone—the plaintiff
would have failed to satisfy his burden of proof.

There are several possible explanations, however, for the law’s
declining to apply this product-of-the-probabilities theorem to the
burden of persuasion. First, even the simple mathematics of the
theorem may be too complicated for many jurors. Second, in most
jurisdictions the decision of the jury must be unanimous or com-
prise a super-majority (for example, 10 out of 12). The requirement
of unanimity or near unanimity helps to ensure a high degree of
confidence by the jury in its findings that offsets the product-of-the-
probabilities theorem. Third, if the theorem were applied, then the

102
PROOF OF NEGLIGENCE

defendant would have an incentive to generate a series of factual
issues for jury determination, in order to benefit from the impact of
the theorem. According to the theorem, if there were 10 separate
factual propositions at issue, the likelihood that all were true would
be substantially below 50 percent even if the independent probabili-
ty that each individual proposition was true were over 90 percent.
Finally, in the typical case, in which both sides submit evidence as
to each disputed issue, the practical issue for the jury is which
side’s contentions have a greater probability of being true. That is,
once the party bearing the burden of production has satisfied that
burden, the jury’s task is to assess the comparative persuasiveness
of the parties’ positions, not to calculate probabilities. For all these
reasons, the product-of-the probabilities theorem does not figure in
the burden of persuasion.

The next issue is how the plaintiff actually proves negligence.
Because negligence is the failure to exercise reasonable care, typi-
cally negligence is proved by showing 1) what the defendant did;
and 2) that what the defendant did or failed to do did not constitute
reasonable care. In addition, it is virtually always in the interest of
the plaintiff also to show 3) what would have constituted reason-
able care, though it is sometimes said that such proof is not
required. In nearly every case, therefore, the plaintiff attempts to
prove some untaken precaution that he or she contends would have
constituted reasonable care on the part of the defendant and that
would have avoided the injury at issue.

B. Circumstantial Evidence of Negligence

A difficulty arises, however, if the plaintiff does not have
specific evidence of what the defendant did or did not do, or of all
the potentially relevant facts associated with the cause of the
plaintiff's injury. Then there is only circumstantial evidence that
the defendant was negligent, if there is evidence at all. Sometimes
proof of the circumstances is sufficient to permit an inference of
negligence, but sometimes it is not. For example, suppose that you
are walking in the fruit and vegetable aisle of the local supermarket
when you suddenly slip and fall. Immediately after the fall you see
a fresh yellow banana peel stuck to your foot. In your negligence
suit against the supermarket you prove only these facts, plus the
scope of your injuries.

You have a problem. A jury would be permitted to infer that
you had fallen because of the presence of the banana peel on the
aisle. And a jury would be permitted to find that the defendant was
required to use reasonable care to assure that there were no

103
TORT LAW

banana peels in its aisles. But, based on these facts alone, should a
jury be permitted to find that the defendant had failed to exercise
reasonable care?

I think not. In this case the plaintiff has not introduced
evidence of what the defendant did or failed to do that was
negligent.! The defendant might be expected to conduct periodic,
perhaps even frequent inspection of its aisles to remove dangerous
material from them. But the evidence is not sufficient to permit any
inference that such inspections were not conducted. For all anyone
knows the banana peel had only been in the aisle a few seconds
before the plaintiff slipped on it. Reasonable people could not find
that the defendant should be constantly inspecting that very aisle.
A simple Learned Hand calculus confirms this—people would not
want to pay a price for fruit and vegetables that included the cost of
constant guarding of the aisles where they are shelved. Note that
this is not a conclusion that the defendant was not negligent; it is
only a conclusion that a jury would not be warranted in drawing
any inference, one way or the other, about whether the defendant
was negligent.

All of this follows from the fact that the plaintiff bears the
burden of production: the jury could not conclude based on the
evidence that, more probably than not, the defendant did not
conduct a reasonably frequent and competent inspection. There-
fore, after the plaintiff has rested his case, the defendant would
move for a directed verdict on that ground, and the court would—or
should—grant that motion, without requiring the defendant to
introduce any evidence at all. At first glance this may seem unfair,
since we do not at this point know whether or not the defendant
was negligent; we simply do not have enough evidence one way or
the other to decide. But the very idea behind the burden of
production is that the plaintiff must introduce evidence from which
the jury could conclude that the defendant was negligent; the
defendant need not prove that it was not negligent.

Now let us change the hypothetical a bit. Suppose that all the
facts are the same except that the banana peel on which the
plaintiff slipped was turning brown. Can the plaintiff now survive
the defendant’s motion for a directed verdict? This is a much closer
question. It is a matter of common knowledge, not really needing
any proof, that banana peels tend to darken after they have been
removed from bananas for a period of time. Consequently, the
plaintiff has now introduced some evidence—though admittedly not
very much—from which it could be inferred that the peel had been

1. See Goddard v. Boston & Maine Railway Co., 60 N.E. 486 (1901).

104
PROOF OF NEGLIGENCE

on the floor for more than just a moment when the plaintiff slipped
on it. And based on the permissible (though not required) inference
that the peel had been on the aisle for more than just a moment, it
might be permissible for a jury to conclude that a reasonably
frequent and competent inspection of the aisle would have discover-
ed the peel and caused it to be removed during the period when the
peel was on the floor.

Nonetheless, some courts still would grant the defendant’s
motion for a directed verdict, because the evidence of the banana
peel’s condition provides only a very slight basis for inferring that it
had been in the aisle long enough to have been discovered by a
reasonable inspection.” There are other alternatives, and the evi-
dence gives the jury only a slight basis for choosing among them:
the peel might have been removed from a brown, ripe banana and
dropped on the floor just a moment before the plaintiff slipped on
it; or someone might have carried the peel into the store and
dropped it on the floor just a moment before the plaintiff encoun-
tered it. Based on ordinary experience these seem to me to be less
probable alternatives, however, and if I were the trial judge I
probably would deny the defendant’s motion for a directed verdict.
But the point here is that, because the evidence now supports a
finding that the peel had been lying in the aisle for some time, the
facts of this revised hypothetical come much closer than do the
facts of the first hypothetical to permitting an inference that the
defendant did not conduct a reasonable inspection. Of course, the
evidence merely creates a permissible inference that the defendant
was negligent. The jury is still free to find that the defendant was
not negligent, except in those rare cases in which reasonable people
could not disagree.

Notice that this analysis proceeded without any need for the
use of the Latin phrase res ipsa loquitur, or reference to anything
speaking ‘“‘for itself.” The question was simply whether there was
enough evidence to support an inference that the defendant had not
conducted an adequate inspection of the aisle in its supermarket. In
the first hypothetical the answer clearly was that there was not
enough evidence and that the plaintiff therefore did not meet the
burden of production. In the second hypothetical the question was
closer. The great mistake that students of this subject often make is
to jump too quickly to the use of the Latin phrase res ipsa loquitur
in situations such as these, instead of engaging in hard-headed
analysis. Res ipsa loquitur is not a substitute for evidence. Rather,

2. See, e.g., Joye v. Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company, 405 F.2d 464 (4th
Cir.1968).

105
TORT LAW

as we will see, it is a doctrine about what counts as legally
sufficient circumstantial evidence of negligence.

Unfortunately, there can be no general principle to use in
determining when there is enough circumstantial evidence to war-
rant saying that a particular type of accident does or does not
ordinarily happen because of negligence. For example, in McDoug-
ald v. Perry, a 180 pound spare tire came out of its cradle
underneath the defendant’s trailer and collided with the windshield
of the plaintiff’s vehicle. The question was whether the jury could
infer negligence in this situation. The court held that the case
should go to the jury, stating that in the usual circumstantial case
the inference of negligence is drawn on the basis of ‘“‘past experi-
ence” that is ‘“common to the community.’’ Obviously, however,
the court could not have been referring to a common community
experience with this particular kind of accident. Rather, the experi-
ence in question is the common, intuitive understanding of laypeo-
ple about how the physical world usually works when things are
done right. A good deal of judicial judgment is required to make
this assessment, and in close cases a defendant may well wonder
how the court knows the teaching of experience on the issue in
question.

Sometimes the possible causes of an accident are sufficiently
technical that there is no common past experience that can resolve
the issue. In such situations many jurisdictions permit expert
testimony to supply the crucial factual predicate that the kind of
accident that occurred does ordinarily happen because of negli-
gence. Medical malpractice cases, in which neither courts nor jurors
have a common ‘“‘past experience’”’ on which to base the necessary
judgments, are a prime example.

In light of all this, one might plausibly wonder when, if ever,
there is any need for a special doctrine regarding proof of negli-
gence. Thus far, all we have seen is that in the absence of direct
evidence of negligence, sometimes circumstantial evidence is suffi-
cient to permit an inference of negligence, and that sometimes
circumstantial evidence is not sufficient to permit such an infer-
ence. The question, then, is whether (and if so, when) there is any
need for a separate ‘‘doctrine”’ in these kinds of cases.

II. Res Ipsa Loquitur

In fact there is a class of cases in which a particular form of
circumstantial evidence of negligence is introduced, and the doc-

3. 716 So.2d 783 (Fla.1998).

106
PROOF OF NEGLIGENCE

trine res ipsa loquitur is invoked. To the extent that the doctrine
does identify a particular class of cases, they involve circumstantial
evidence that the defendant was probably negligent in some way,
without supporting an inference of the particular way in which the
defendant was negligent. Thus, if a defendant’s car left a 300 foot
skid mark on a street with a 25 mile per hour speed limit, the skid
mark is circumstantial evidence that the defendant was exceeding
the speed limit. Strictly speaking, this is not a res ipsa case, because
there is evidence (though circumstantial) of what the defendant’s
negligence consisted of. On the other hand, if the defendant’s
vehicle struck the plaintiff on a sidewalk, there is circumstantial
evidence that the defendant was negligent in some way, but not of
the particular way in which the defendant was negligent. He may
have been inattentive; may have swerved to avoid an animal but
have been unable to control his vehicle because he was speeding; or
his vehicle may have malfunctioned because he had failed to have it
properly maintained and inspected. Further, the cause of harm in
such instances usually is not, but in this case nonetheless may have
been, someone else’s negligence (e.g., the manufacturer of the car)
or someone else’s non-negligent conduct (a freak breakdown of the
steering linkage not caused by any defect in design or fabrication of
the car). Because defendants who collide with people on sidewalks
ordinarily do so because of negligence of some sort on their part,
there is sufficient circumstantial evidence of negligence to permit
the plaintiff's case to go to the jury. Res ipsa loquitur is the
doctrine confirming that circumstantial evidence of this particular
sort will support a jury verdict that the defendant was negligent in
some undetermined way.

Res ipsa loquitur has long been so firmly established in tort
doctrine that black-letter prerequisites to its application have been
developed. It is always a condition of invoking the doctrine that the
event causing the plaintiff’s injury must be one that

(1) ordinarily occurs because of negligence by someone in the
defendant’s position.

The traditional approach also adopts the following require-
ments:

(2) the instrumentality causing the injury must be within the
exclusive control of the defendant; and

(3) the injury must not be due to any voluntary action or
contribution by the plaintiff.

Note that, taken together, these are bright-line prerequisites to a
finding that, all things considered, the defendant was negligent.
Requirement (2) is especially rigid, and over time caused the courts

107
TORT LAW

to balk. In contrast, the modern formulation takes a less bright-line
and less restrictive view, simply requiring that causes other than
the defendant’s negligence (the defendant’s non-negligent conduct,
the negligent conduct of someone else, and the non-negligent con-
duct of someone else or some thing) be sufficiently eliminated by
the evidence. That is, the evidence must support an inference that
the cause of the plaintiff's harm was the defendant’s negligence
rather than all other possible causes. In effect, this approach
applies requirement (1) but not requirements (2) and (3).

Both sets of requirements are ways of stating what it takes to
establish a circumstantial case of negligence on the part of the
defendant, though of course the modern approach is considerably
more flexible than the traditional one. Note also that, in most
jurisdictions, the application of res ipsa means only that there is a
permissible inference of negligence. The jury is still free to find for
the defendant, even if the defendant introduces no evidence that it
was not negligent. In a few jurisdictions, however, the application

of res ipsa creates a presumption of negligence that actually has
weight.

A. Applications

When the requirements of res ipsa are met, in most jurisdic-
tions the effect is that the jury is permitted, though not required, to
find that the defendant was negligent. This means at the least that
the plaintiff survives the defendant’s motion for a directed verdict
at the close of the plaintiff's case. Ordinarily it also means that the
case will go to the jury, although occasionally the evidence thereaf-
ter presented by the defendant shows as a matter of law that the
defendant was not negligent and the defendant is granted a direct-
ed verdict at the close of his case. For example, suppose that the
plaintiff shows that he was a passenger on the defendant’s train
when it derailed. Such accidents ordinarily do not happen in the
absence of negligence. Therefore the plaintiff has made out a prima
facie case on negligence. But then the defendant proves by undis-
puted evidence that moments before the train derailed the track
had been sabotaged, without any warning or reason to expect
sabotage. Probably the defendant would then be granted a directed
verdict.’ But in the absence of such a definitive, undisputed de-
fense, the plaintiffs res ipsa case goes to the jury.

In most jurisdictions the jury is given an instruction that states
the applicable requirements of res ipsa, though without naming the

4, See Kanter v. St. Louis, Springfield, & Peoria R.R., 218 Tll.App. 565 (1920).

108
PROOF OF NEGLIGENCE

doctrine. States applying the traditional rule instruct the jury as to
requirements (1), (2), and (3) noted in the preceding section. States
applying a more modern approach apply only requirement (1),
simply instructing the jury that it is entitled to decide that the
defendant was negligent based on the circumstantial evidence in-
troduced, if accidents such as the one in question ordinarily happen
because of the negligence of those in defendant’s position, rather
than due to other causes.

The application of res ipsa is illustrated by Byrne v. Boadle,’
one of the earliest cases to employ res ipsa loquitur expressly. The
plaintiff there was struck by a barrel of flour that fell out of a
window of the defendant’s warehouse. The plaintiff introduced no
evidence of the manner in which the barrel came to fall or that the
defendant’s employees were responsible. The court held that the
plaintiff had nonetheless made out a prima facie case, because
there are some cases in which the mere fact of the accident having
occurred is evidence of negligence. In these cases ‘‘the thing speaks
for itself,” and what it speaks of is negligence.

It is worth recognizing that, from one point of view, res ipsa
loquitur does not actually do any work in situations such as this,
other than naming a subclass of cases in which there is sufficient
circumstantial evidence of negligence. That is, on the facts of Byrne
v. Boadle the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case on the two
issues that often figure in cases in which res ipsa is invoked:
identification of the defendant as the party physically in control of
what occurred, and negligence of some sort by the defendant or its
employees. First, on those facts it would be permissible to infer that
the defendant’s employees were responsible for the barrel’s falling.
After all, the barrel fell from the defendant’s warehouse. It is of
course possible that someone other than the defendant’s employees
was responsible (a customer supervising the lowering of the barrel
out the warehouse window, for example), but in the absence of any
other evidence on the issue, proof that the barrel fell from the
defendant’s warehouse satisfies the plaintiff's burden of production
by identifying the defendant as the party who is probably responsi-
ble for the negligence in the case, if any. Second, based on this
evidence it would be permissible for the jury to find that barrels
ordinarily fall out of warehouse windows because of negligence, and
therefore that the defendant was negligent in having failed in some
way or other to take reasonable precautions to prevent the barrel
from falling.

5. 159 Eng.Rep. 299 (Ex.1863).

109
TORT LAW

On this point of view, the case is simply one in which the
evidence on both issues satisfies the plaintiff's burden of produc-
tion. What distinguishes the case from an ordinary negligence suit
is that, because there is no direct evidence of what the defendant’s
employees were or were not doing at the time the barrel fell, and no
circumstantial evidence of any particular untaken precaution, the
plaintiff cannot point to a specific act of negligence that caused the
barrel to fall. Many cases in which res ipsa loquitur is invoked
share this characteristic. They are simply cases in which there is
only circumstantial evidence on the issues of identification and
negligence, but that evidence is sufficient to satisfy the plaintiff's
burden of production. In such cases res ipsa is merely a label for
this class of cases. That is, the doctrine does not create any
inference that is not already permissible anyway on the basis of
evidentiary probabilities alone.

There is a point a view that understands res ipsa always to do
work, that is, to make a difference, when it is applicable. The
implication of this point of view, however, is that if were not for the
doctrine, the cases to which it applies would not go to the jury.
Under the traditional approach I can understand this point of view.
Under this approach there must be evidence satisfying require-
ments (1), (2), and (3) for application of res ipsa, and if there is not
such evidence, then the case does not go to the jury, even when
there is circumstantial evidence of the defendant’s negligence.
Under the modern approach, however, only requirement (1) must
be satisfied, and requirement (1) seems merely to state that if there
is circumstantial evidence of the defendant’s negligence, the case
can go to the jury. Surely this is just a statement of the ordinary
rule governing circumstantial evidence, not a basis for getting to
the jury that is added by res ipsa.

In any event, whichever requirement or requirements are
applied, an instrumentalist way to understand res ipsa, is to think
of the decision that the plaintiff has met his burden of production
as a way of minimizing the degree of error that would otherwise
result. Suppose that in cases like Byrne v. Boadle the plaintiff were
held not to have satisfied his burden of production, and that the
defendant’s motion for a directed verdict were granted at the close
of the plaintiff's case. If it is in fact true that barrels do not
ordinarily fall out of warehouse windows in the absence of negli-
gence by the warehouser, then the probability is at least 51 percent
that the defendant has been negligent when a barrel does fall. If
the defendant’s motion for a directed verdict is nonetheless granted
in such cases when there is no direct evidence of negligence, then
the defendant wins 100 percent of the time. The rate of error is

110
PROOF OF NEGLIGENCE

therefore at least 51 percent, since ordinarily a barrel does not fall
in the absence of negligence. On the other hand, if the plaintiff is
held to have satisfied his burden of production, then even if there is
no other evidence at all and even if the jury finds for the plaintiff
100 percent of the time, the error rate is 49 percent or less, because
the defendant is in fact negligent at least 51 percent of the time.
Thus, submitting the case to the jury produces a lower rate of error
than granting the defendant’s motion for a directed verdict.

B. ‘“‘Smoking Out” the Evidence from the Defendant

All of this, of course, assumes that the defendant will not
produce any evidence. If the defendant’s motion for a directed
verdict is denied, however, then unless the defendant presents some
evidence in an effort to show affirmatively that he was not negli-
gent, the case will go to the jury with only the plaintiff's evidence,
and the jury will probably draw the inference it is permitted but
not required to draw—that the defendant was in fact negligent.
Note, however, that in states where res ipsa permits an inference
but does not create a presumption of negligence, a jury is not
required to find for the plaintiff even when the defendant has not
introduced any evidence tending to show that it was not negligent.
Nonetheless, denying the defendant’s motion for a directed verdict
on the ground that the plaintiff has satisfied his burden of produc-
tion creates a strong incentive for the defendant to put on some
kind of case. In Byrne v. Boadle this might have consisted of
testimony (for example) by the defendant’s employees indicating
how careful they were being when the barrel fell, or indicating that

the pulley holding the rope being used to lower the barrel unexpect-
edly broke.

Because invoking res ipsa loquitur results in the denial of
defendant’s motion for a directed verdict at the close of the plain-
tiffs evidence, it is sometimes said that the great advantage in
cases where res ipsa is invoked is that the defendant is then forced
to present evidence—forced, that is, to defend himself rather than
hide behind the difficulty the plaintiff faces in adducing direct
evidence about the accident. Indeed, older decisions sometimes said
that cases in which the defendant had superior access to evidence
on the negligence issue were particularly appropriate for use of res
ipsa.

On this view, res ipsa is not merely a label, but actually
performs the function of ‘‘smoking out’’ evidence in the possession
of the defendant. If this were often true and the ordinary rules of
evidence would have dictated that the defendant’s motion for a

111
TORT LAW

directed verdict at the close of the plaintiff's case be granted, res
ipsa would do real work: the doctrine would create an artificial
inference of negligence, in order to give the defendant the incentive
to explain what actually happened. The inference would be “artifi-
cial” because, if the ordinary rules governing drawing an inference
of negligence from circumstantial evidence would on their own have
required that the defendant’s motion for a directed verdict be
denied, then there would be no need for res ipsa. Ironically, then, in
this situation res ipsa actually would more than merely label what
would have happened anyway, because it would be invoked in
precisely in those cases in which the thing does not speak for itself!

How often res ipsa is in fact needed in order to perform this
function, however, is open to question. In the days before modern
discovery, it may well have been true that the only way to force the
defendant to produce direct evidence about the accident was to wait
until trial and then to deny his motion for a directed verdict at the
close of the plaintiff's case. Indeed, the court in Byrne v. Boadle
seemed to think that the plaintiff could not have made out his
prima facie case by calling witnesses from the defendant’s ware-
house to prove that they were negligent. Perhaps this was because
the court believed that the witnesses would not tell the truth, but it
may also have been because in the absence of discovery the plaintiff
would not have known in advance what they would have said. But
with the aid of modern discovery procedure, today’s plaintiff could
depose under oath everyone who was involved in handling the
barrel and everyone responsible for safety at the warehouse. What-
ever the defendant’s employees know about the accident, the plain-
tiff can force them to disclose during discovery. Any evidence
generated in this manner that is favorable to the plaintiff can then
be adduced as part of the plaintiff’s prima facie case. Thus, it may
be that res ipsa came into being partly in order to help smoke-out
evidence that was not otherwise available to the plaintiff. But it
may equally be true today that because of modern discovery the
doctrine is no longer needed to perform this function.

C. The Ybarra Problem

A situation in which res ipsa still might perform the function of
smoking-out evidence involves multiple defendants. Suppose that
two or more parties have control over a possible cause or causes of
harm, but the plaintiff cannot prove which party’s negligence
caused the harm. For example, a landlord and its commercial
tenant might both have control of rooftop tiles, or a group of
physicians and nurses might have control of a patient while he is

112
PROOF OF NEGLIGENCE

unconscious. If, through discovery, the plaintiff would otherwise be
unable to obtain evidence of which party’s negligence caused harm,
the threat of liability might cause the party who has that informa-
tion to disclose it.

Should res ipsa apply in these situations, even though it cannot
be said, regarding any individual defendant, that the harm in
question ordinarily happens because of the negligence of someone
in that defendant’s position? In both the hypotheticals I have just
posed, the defendants are in a sense connected to each other. They
may not be conducting a joint enterprise, but they neither are they
strangers. This means, first, that they are more likely to have
information about the quality of each other’s conduct than strang-
ers. If a flower pot falls out of the window of a building containing
fifty apartments, there is little reason to believe that some occu-
pants will have observed the quality of care exercised by the others.
But landlords and tenants, physicians and nurses, are more likely
to have observed each others’ conduct. Second, the fact that the
defendants are connected to each other also means that there is
greater justification for imposing on them a duty either to observe
each others’ conduct or, in the absence of observation, to bear
responsibility for it. The physicians and nurses in a large hospital
may not literally know each other, but they are engaged in a
common effort within the four walls of the hospital. The possibility
that they may end up being liable for each other’s conduct often
seems more acceptable than it would be if they were not connected
in any way.

The result is that in situations of shared control, whether
simultaneous or serial, and especially in medical situations where
the plaintiff/patient was injured while he was unconscious, the
courts have sometimes been willing to apply res ipsa loquitur to
multiple defendants. Perhaps the most celebrated case in which
this occurred was Ybarra v. Spangard.‘ In that case the plaintiff, a
patient who underwent surgery in a hospital, awoke with an
injured neck after an appendectomy. He sued several different
health care providers who had treated him, one of whom more
probably than not committed malpractice while he was uncon-
scious. No single defendant was more probably than not negligent.
But absent the application of res ipsa none of the defendants would
have had an interest in telling what they knew. None of the
defendants had any financial incentive to reveal what, if anything,
he or she knew about the injury because each would automatically
be granted a directed verdict at the close of the plaintiffs case. The

6. 25 Cal.2d 486, 154 P.2d 687 (1944).

113
TORT LAW

party who had actually caused the plaintiff's injury obviously had
no incentive to do anything but stay silent, and none of the other
defendants who may or may not have witnessed the act of negli-
gence of another had any incentive to do anything but stay silent
either. Without evidence regarding which defendant was responsi-
ble for the injury, the plaintiff could not have survived the defen-
dants’ motions for a directed verdict at the close of his case,
because each individual defendant was less likely than not to have
been negligent. The Supreme Court of California held, however,
that res ipsa applied. This meant that there was an incentive for
any defendant who did have relevant evidence to testify about what
he or she knew. But on remand each of the defendants testified
that nothing untoward had occurred in handling the patient. The
trier of fact then found them all liable.

Invoking res ipsa in Ybarra created the possibility of smoking-
out evidence from one of the defendants who had witnessed anoth-
er’s malpractice, or from the particular defendant who had actually
committed the malpractice in question, who might have preferred
to admit his wrongdoing rather than see his or her colleagues held
liable for something they did not do. But in order for res ipsa
actually to be able to smoke-out the evidence, two factors must
exist in situations such as Ybarra: 1) One or more of the defendants
must actually have knowledge about the cause of the plaintiff’s
injury that would be useful as evidence. This will not necessarily be
the case, since sometimes no defendant will have any evidence of
negligence to provide. One of the defendants may simply have
mishandled the patient’s neck without anyone, including that de-
fendant, knowing it. 2) Any defendant who does have evidence that
would be useful to the plaintiff must be willing to lie under oath in
a deposition but willing to tell the truth under oath at trial.
Otherwise res ipsa is not needed, since the defendant would reveal
his evidence in a deposition and that evidence could then be used as
part of the plaintiff's case in chief at trial even if res ipsa were not
available to get the plaintiff past a motion for a directed verdict. I
suppose that sometimes both factors will exist, but how often is not
at all clear. Just as often, I suspect, either no defendant will have
any useful evidence, or the party who does have it will not be
willing to reveal it at all, preferring to have his or her malpractice
insurer pay his or her fraction of the judgment instead of ‘‘ratting”’
on a colleague. The price that must be paid in order to use res ipsa
to smoke-out evidence when it is in fact capable of being smoked-
out, therefore, is to permit the jury to impose liability on all the
defendants, even when none has any evidence and even when all
but one of them, in all probability, were not negligent.

114
PROOF OF NEGLIGENCE

This analysis reveals that the strength of the argument for res
ipsa as a means of generating otherwise unavailable evidence in
multiple-defendant cases, depends in part on two empirical ques-
tions that are not really answerable at a general level: in cases in
which there is no direct evidence of negligence and the circumstan-
tial evidence alone is legally insufficient, how often there is any
evidence to be smoked out, and how often would res ipsa smoke it
out? If there were good reason to believe that often there is
evidence to be smoked out and that res ipsa often could do the
smoking, then that would justify the doctrine’s separate existence.
In light of the limited number of situations in which res ipsa is
likely to be useful in this way, however, then what is its function in
multiple defendant situations? I think that for those who support
applying the doctrine in these situations, the risk of error that
would result from invoking res ipsa even when the thing does not
speak for itself is worth tolerating because, in their view, strict
liability is preferable to negligence as a basis for liability. On this
view, invoking res ipsa when the thing does not speak for itself and
no evidence is smoked out simply permits the jury to impose strict
liability through a verdict of negligence. Res ipsa under these
circumstances is a way of obtaining under-the-table strict liability.
Invoking the doctrine properly holds liable a set of defendants who
are connected to each other in a way that justifies holding them
responsible for the harm each other causes.

The trouble with this view is that it is unclear how to limit this
notion. Does it apply only in hospitals? Only when the plaintiff was
unconscious when he was harmed? Or does it apply whenever a set
of defendants, one or more of whom may have negligently caused
harm, are connected to each other in a way that justifies making
them legally responsible for either producing evidence or bearing
responsibility for each other? What is it about the category of cases
in which there is no direct evidence of taken or untaken precau-
tions—that is, the category of cases in which res ipsa is potentially
of value to the plaintiff—that warrants making these particular
cases special candidates for strict liability? Why set things up so
that the jury can most easily impose strict liability in the very cases
in which there is the least evidence of negligence? For possible
answers we will have to await the discussion of strict liability in
Chapter Eight.

CausE-In-FACT

In any tort suit the plaintiff must prove not only that the
defendant was negligent or otherwise breached the applicable stan-
dard of care, but also that the defendant’s act or omission caused
the injury or damage for which the plaintiff claims compensation.
This means proving that, in the absence of the tortious conduct of
the defendant, the plaintiff would not have been injured. Notice
that this seemingly simple, single issue actually may involve one or
more components: 1) what caused the harm, 2) who caused the
harm, 3) whether negligence caused the harm, and 4) what part of
the harm was caused by what or whom.!

In many cases this is an utterly straightforward matter to
prove. If the defendant fails to stop his vehicle at a red light and
collides with the plaintiff's vehicle proceeding with the green light,
there is no question that the defendant’s negligence caused the
plaintiff's harm. But in other cases the issue is more difficult. In
such cases understanding the purposes served by the causation
requirement becomes more important, because these purposes help
to inform application of the requirement to the facts. at hand. And
often in these problematic cases the complexity of the very idea of
causation becomes evident.

I. The “But For’ Test

The simplest and most widely accepted test for cause-in-fact is
the “but-for,”’ or sine qua non test. This test requires a determina-
tion whether, ‘“‘but for’’ the defendant’s negligence (or breach of
another applicable standard of care), the plaintiff would have
suffered injury or damage. If the answer is ‘‘no,’”’ then cause-in-fact
is proved. But if the answer is “yes,” then ordinarily the test is not
satisfied and the defendant is not liable, because the plaintiff would
have been injured even if the defendant had not been negligent. For
example, suppose that a person falls off a boat that negligently
carries no life buoys to throw to those in the water. That person
sinks immediately below the surface and drowns.” Although the

2. For a case whose facts are highly similar to this hypothetical, see New York
Central R.R. v. Grimstad, 264 F. 334 (2d Cir.1920).

116
CAUSE-IN-FACT

defendant was negligent, that negligence was not a but-for cause of
the drowning. Even if there had been a buoy to throw, there would
have been no way for the buoy to reach the person drowning,
because he sank beneath the surface immediately. On the other
hand, if the decedent had bobbed onto the surface several times
before drowning, it might be a jury question whether a properly
placed buoy could have been thrown to him and would have saved
him. But some courts would require testimony about the likely
placement of each omitted buoy, and the throwing ability of those
who were on board at the time, before permitting the causation
issue to go to the jury.

Note that there are many causes in fact—but-for causes—of
any event. Being a cause-in-fact is not the same as what, in
common parlance, would be called the ‘‘responsible’”’ or the main
cause of an occurrence. In an automobile collision case, if the
defendant’s parents had not met, if the defendant had not travelled
to work on the day of the collision, if the defendant had not gone to
college, bought a car, or run the red light, he would not have
collided with the plaintiff. The key is whether one of these many
but-for causes was negligent. If so, then the act or omission of the
party responsible for this negligence is ‘‘a’’ cause-in-fact. A but-for
cause, however, is not necessarily what we would call “‘the’’ cause
of the plaintiff's harm. Being a negligent but-for cause makes a
defendant eligible for liability, so to speak, but the defendant is not
liable unless his negligence was also a “proximate cause’’—a con-
cept examined in the next Chapter. To put it another way, if the
defendant’s negligence was not a cause-in-fact of the plaintiff's
harm then ordinarily there can be no liability, because the defen-
dant’s negligence was not even “‘a’’ cause of the plaintiff's harm. To
be a negligent cause-in-fact is a necessary, but not a sufficient,
condition of liability.

Unlike pure empirical questions of fact, and unlike mixed
questions of fact and law, the causation question is not factual, but
‘“‘counterfactual.”’ It does not require a finding of what actually
happened, but of what would have happened if the defendant had
not been negligent. We cannot actually rewind a hypothetical
recording of the accident, remove the defendant’s negligence, and
see what happened. Instead, the jury must rely on its own experi-
ence and knowledge of the world to make its decision about what
would have happened. The but-for test asks the jury to engage in
retrospective prophecy. And it asks the court, in ruling on whether
the evidence of causation is legally sufficient to go to the jury, to
determine whether an inference of what would have happened if
the defendant had not been negligent is permissible.

117
TORT LAW

Because of the counterfactual nature of causal proof, all we can
do is ask the jury to make a judgment, based on the evidence and
its own experience, about what would have happened if the defen-
dant had not been negligent. The counterfactual nature of causal
proof therefore requires the assumption that the jury has knowl-
edge of it own, or testimony from experts, about the way the world
typically works in the accident situation under scrutiny. This
means that jurors’ own conscious or unconscious biases about what
is normal, including what they think of the capacities of different
groups of people—young and old, men and women, etc., may affect
jury decisions.? The more strictly we require that there be a
concrete experiential basis for making that judgment before sub-
mitting the case to the jury, the more often we will say that the
plaintiff has not made out a prima facie case on the causation issue.
In this sense, cause-in-fact is a bit like res ipsa loquitur. In res ipsa
a case goes to the jury only if an inference of negligence in this
situation is permissible because of what in general happens in
situations like this. Similarly, in cause-in-fact disputes a court must
decide whether an inference about what would have happened in
this situation if the defendant had not been negligent is permissi-
ble, because of what ordinarily happens in situations like this when
the defendant has not been negligent.

There is no rule about precisely how much narrative detail a
court will require before ruling that the plaintiff's burden of
production on the causation issue has been satisfied. The courts
have a tendency, other things being equal, to prefer evidence about
the particular case at hand over generalizations about situations.
To return to the earlier drowning hypothetical, jurors know gener-
ally that people who fall into bodies of water manage to stay on the
surface for a while, and that people trying to rescue those who fall
into the water often react aggressively to such emergencies. For
some courts that would be enough evidence that the negligent
absence of a buoy was a but-for cause of the decedent’s drowning.
For other courts, however, there would not be enough evidence
about causation in “‘this”’ particular case without proof of where a
buoy would have been placed and the ability of those on the boat to
throw it. Apparently the courts want to have a comfort level that
there is evidence about the very situation being litigated rather
than merely about situations generally resembling this one. Partly
this stance is a product of the way most people think about
causation, and partly it is a legacy of distrust of statistics and

(2010).

118
CAUSE-IN-FACT

generalizations from a time when these were less reliable than they
often are now.

Instead of the but-for test, some courts occasionally ask wheth-
er the defendant’s negligence was a “‘substantial factor’ in bringing
about the plaintiff's injury or damage. The ‘‘but-for’’ test requires a
finding that, more probably than not, the defendant’s negligence
was a prerequisite to what happened, whereas the ‘substantial
factor’ test could be understood merely to require a finding that
the defendant’s negligence was influential in some way. That is not
a helpful way of thinking about the problem. It may be that, for
reasons of policy, there should be exceptions to the but-for test in
certain classes of cases. But substituting the substantial factor test
is a vague way to achieve that end. Therefore, except in cases
(described later) where multiple separate acts of negligence each
would have been a sufficient but-for cause of the plaintiff's harm,
the substantial factor test is misleading and unhelpful. As a general
alternative to the but-for test, the substantial factor test is there-
fore rejected by most courts.

A. ‘“‘Self—Proving’’ Causation: Fall-Downs, Dart—Outs,
and Zuchowitz

There is a set of cases in which the courts hold that the
plaintiff has introduced sufficient evidence of causation if the
negligence of the defendant substantially increased the chance that
the plaintiff would be injured. But negligent conduct always in-
creases the chance that someone or something will be harmed; that
is one of the defining and necessary features of negligent conduct.
Conduct that does not increase the risk of harm is not negligent.
All negligence cases involve an increased risk of harm, but not
necessarily a substantial increase and not necessarily of a single
form of harm. For example, conduct that only slightly risks harm
may still be negligent if it risks great harm. And conduct that
moderately increases the risk of a number of different forms of
harm to different categories of plaintiffs may be negligent. So the
notion that, in cases where negligence substantially increases the
risk of harm to the plaintiff, there is sufficient evidence of causa-
tion, seems to suggest that, in this set of cases, evidence of
negligence is evidence of causation, because the main thing that
makes the conduct negligent is that it substantially increases the
probability of causing the particular kind of harm that occurred.
Causation in such cases is, in this sense, “‘self-proving.”’

One such set of cases involves plaintiffs who slip and fall, often
on negligently maintained stairs. Another involves plaintiffs who

119
TORT LAW

suddently dart out into a street and are run down by a speeding
vehicle. In these cases the plaintiff might have fallen if the stairs
had been properly maintained, or been struck by the vehicle even if
it had not been speeding. For example, in a case cited in many
casebooks, Reynolds v. Texas & Pacific Ry. Co.,‘ the plaintiff
weighed 250 pounds and was warned to hurry up to catch a train.
Hastening down unlighted steps, she fell and was injured. In the
plaintiff's suit alleging negligence on the part of the railroad in
hurrying her down an unlighted stairway, the defendant railroad
contended that she might just as easily have fallen in broad
daylight while moving at a regular pace. But the court held that if
the plaintiff proves that the negligence of the defendant “greatly
multiplied’ the chances of the accident, the plaintiff has made out a
jury question on the causation issue.

Is there enough ‘“‘self-proving”’ causation in Reynolds to permit
the case to go to the jury? The court thought so.The jury knows
that more often than not people don’t fall down stairs, even if they
are overweight. It is true that factors other than the defendant’s
negligence may well have caused Mrs. Reynolds to fall. But in her
case two negligent factors—the fact that the stairs were not lighted
and that she was told to hurry—were arguably the result of the
defendant’s negligence. Since there was no evidence that Mrs.
Reynolds frequently fell on lighted stairs when she was not hurry-
ing, what the defendant did or did not do is a sufficiently plausible
explanation for what caused her to fall. In the absence of evidence
of other probable causes, the defendant’s negligence is the probable
cause (or at least so the jury is permitted to find). Thus, sometimes
the most effective way to prove that the defendant’s negligence
caused the plaintiff's harm is to eliminate a series of other possible
causes. That leaves the defendant’s negligence as a cause.

This process of proving that negligence caused harm by elimi-
nating non-negligent causes is used not only in simple fall-down
and dart-out cases, but also when expert testimony regarding
causation is required. For example, in Zuchowicz v. United States,*
the suit was for injuries and death that were allegedly caused by an
overdose of a prescription drug. The question was whether there
was sufficient evidence of causation to support the verdict in
plaintiffs favor. The first question was whether even an appropri-
ate dose could have caused the harm in question, but the second
question was whether the negligent overdose caused the harm. In
an opinion by Judge Guido Calabresi, one of the great torts scholars

4. 37 La. Ann. 694 (1885).
5. 140 F.3d 381 (2d Cir.1998).

120
CAUSE-IN-FACT

of the twentieth century, the court found the testimony of the
plaintiff's experts sufficient to support the verdict on these issues,
largely on the ground that the experts had ruled out a series of
other possible causes, which as a result made the plaintiff's conten-
tion more likely. Calabresi also noted that “‘it is often true that the
higher the dosage [of any prescription drug] the greater is the
likelihood of ... negative side effects.’’ Notice that this kind of
reasoning comes close to invoking “‘self-proving”’ causation.

It is worth noting, however, that in Zwchowitcz there appears
to have been little data about any of the causes of the very rare
disease the plaintiff contracted, and no direct evidence that the
excess dosage of the drug the plaintiff took greatly increased the
chance of harm, rather than slightly or modestly increased the
chance of great harm—in that case, death. There was only the
supposition, just quoted, that it is ‘‘often”’ true that the higher the
dosage of prescription drugs, the greater the likelihood of harm. It
is not at all clear, therefore, whether there would have been a
sufficient independent basis for invoking “self-proving”’ causation
in Zuchowicz. It may well be that proof of negligence alone was not
sufficient to prove causation, and that the plaintiff's burden of
production was satisfied only because there was also testimony
from the plaintiff's experts that ruled out other possible causes.

B. Expert Testimony: Daubert

Once causation questions start to turn on expert testimony
such as this, the rules governing the admissibility of such testimony
come into play. In recent years there have been several important
cases decided by the U.S. Supreme Court on this issue. Although
these decisions formally govern only litigation in federal courts
under the Federal Rules of Evidence, many state courts have very
similar rules of evidence and look to interpretations of the Federal
Rules for guidance. And although these cases involve expert testi-
mony regarding causation (and thus are discussed here), they
pertain to expert testimony generally. The most significant decision
is Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals,’ in which the Court
specified the standards that the trial courts should employ to
exercise their “gatekeeping role”’ in ruling on the admissibility of
scientific expert testimony. The Court directed the trial courts to
make a preliminary assessment of the reliability and applicability of
the testimony as a condition of its admissibility, taking into account
not only general acceptance of the theory underlying the testimony,

6. 509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993).

121
TORT LAW

but also whether the theory has been tested, peer reviewed, and
published, and in the case of a scientific technique, the known or
potential rate of error. In subsequent cases the Court has held that
the trial courts should exercise analogous gatekeeping authority in
cases involving non-scientific expert testimony, and that rulings by
trial courts on the admissibility of expert testimony should be
reversed only for abuse of discretion.’

It is not easy, however, to pinpoint the distinction between an
assessment of the reliability of expert testimony and an assessment
of the persuasiveness of that testimony. Yet that is precisely what
Daubert and its progeny require, allocating the former to the trial
court and the latter to the jury. Sometimes the line between the
two functions is very fine indeed. In any event, there is no doubt
that these U.S. Supreme Court decisions have given rise to a much
more extended and detailed process for determining whether and
when expert testimony is admissible. Because the decisions of trial
courts on this issue can be reversed only for abuse of discretion,
however, it is unclear how much impact there has actually been on
the frequency at which expert testimony is or is not admitted into
evidence.

II. Multiple Causes, Indeterminate Causes, and
Exceptions to the Conventional Test

The but-for test usually works in straightforward fashion in
cases involving only one defendant. On the other hand, when
multiple possible causes are involved, the causation requirement is
sometimes held to be satisfied even when the defendant’s negli-
gence is not a but-for cause of the plaintiff's harm. The exceptions
to the conventional test are a mixed bag that do not all fall into a
single category. To understand these exceptions, it is helpful first to
step back from the two conventional tests for causation to look at
the theories underlying the causation requirement.

A. Theories Underlying the Causation Requirement

Why is causation, however defined, always an element of a
cause of action in tort? At first glance the answer may seem utterly
obvious: if the defendant did not injure the plaintiff then there is
no causation, no one injured, no damages, and no plaintiff to bring

7. See, e.g., Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143
L.Ed.2d 238 (1999) (non-scientific testimony) and General Electric Co. v. Joiner, 522
USS. 136, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997) (abuse of discretion standard applied
on appeal).

122
CAUSE-IN-FACT

suit. But of course that answer is only half-right whenever the
question matters. In any case in which causation is disputed, there
is a plaintiff with an injury and damages or there would have been
no suit to begin with. So the question is, if there is an injured
plaintiff and a negligent defendant, why must there be a causal
connection between what the defendant did and what happened to
the plaintiff? This question could just as appropriately have been
asked at the outset of this Chapter in setting out the but-for test.
But it turns out that it is in cases where exceptions to the but-for
case are created or considered that theories underlying the causa-
tion requirement often bear the most weight.

1. Justice between the Parties

One justification for requiring that there be a causal connec-
tion between what the defendant did and what happened to the
plaintiff is concern for doing justice between the parties. If the
defendant did not cause the plaintiffs loss, then it seems obvious
that the defendant has not wronged the plaintiff. There is no
injustice to be corrected and no basis for giving the plaintiff civil
recourse against the defendant.

But is this conclusion always as obvious as it seems? Consider
any of the causation cases that we have discussed or that you have
studied thus far. In each of these cases the defendant was negli-
gent—that is, unreasonably risked harming the plaintiff. If the
plaintiff has proved that the defendant was negligent in risking
harm to the plaintiff, then in one sense the defendant has wronged
her. If I exceed the speed limit on Main Street I am no less
negligent toward those whose harm I risked if I am able to stop the
car without having caused harm than if I injure someone as a result
of speeding. And the person I almost harm would be understand-
ably indignant at my misbehavior—she would think I had commit-
ted a wrong, and consider herself much more involved and implicat-
ed than someone watching from a position of safety. My “‘wrong”’
consists of risking the harm that may result from what I have done.
That is, we tend to judge whether an act is blameworthy by asking
what the defendant knew or should have known at the time of the
act—by the act’s potential consequences—and not exclusively by
the consequences that actually materialize.

Many commentators would reject this analysis. They see the
causation requirement in tort law as evidence that there is no
wrong without a relation between the plaintiff and defendant that
consists of the defendant harming the plaintiff. But that is only an
accurate description of the structure of tort law if tort law insists
on causation as a matter of principle, rather than for practical

123
TORT LAW

reasons. Ultimately I think that is the case, but let us push the
analysis based on risks-as-wrongs a bit further anyway and see
where it leads.

Suppose we were to think of the wrong of the negligent
defendant, whether or not it actually caused harm, as consisting of
taking the risk of harming. What kind of damages should then be
awarded? It would seem that the measure of damages payable to
someone I do injure should not be that plaintiff's actual loss, but a
sum equal to the probability that he would suffer harm, multiplied
by the amount of harm that could be expected if harm did result.
This, after all, is the ‘‘amount” of the risk that I took, and taking
that risk was the wrong I committed. If I were held liable for that
amount to everyone I risked harming on each occasion I did so,
whether or not they were injured, then over time I would pay out
the same sum in damages (though in smaller amounts to more
people) as I would if I were only liable to those whom I injured.

Under such a system people would be compensated for the
‘“‘wrong’’ I committed in risking harm to them. Why don’t we do it
that way? One of the reasons we do not have such a system, of
course, is that the people whose harm is risked but who are not
injured have no immediate need for the money, and those who are
injured do. That problem could only be solved if risk-based damages
were always awarded, and uninjured plaintiffs who received com-
pensation saved it for the time they were injured. For practical
purposes that would be an impossible system to operate, since
everyone whose harm was risked could sue, and in every such suit
the precise degree of risk posed by the defendant’s acts toward each
possible victim would be at issue. Under this theory, therefore, we
require proof of causation for practical reasons rather than reasons
of deep principle.

What are we to make of this analysis? On the one hand, it
misses something important. We have much more indignation at a
defendant who harms a plaintiff than at a defendant who merely
risks harming the plaintiff. Treating them the same seems inappro-
priate, and requiring proof of causation makes perfect sense. On
the other hand, ignoring the fact that the underlying wrong is
risking harm doesn’t seem entirely sensible either, as a matter of
principle. Defendants who don’t injure anyone are simply lucky, but
are just as blameworthy as those who do.’

Perhaps these are just irreconcilable points of view. For those
who still think that causation should be a moral prerequisite to

8. For disagreement, see John C.P. Goldberg & Benjamin C. Zipursky, Tort Law
and Moral Luck, 92 Cornet L. Rev. 1123 (2007).

124
CAUSE-IN-FACT

liability, the analysis is not persuasive. But even for those who
think that the risks-as-wrongs analysis makes sense, or that the
two views each say something important, in most cases the issue
will be beside the point, because usually it is not practical to
dispense with the causation requirement. As we will see, however,
in occasional cases it is practical to dispense with the conventional
causation requirement, and the issue must be confronted.

2. Causation and Deterrence

An instrumental view of the causation requirement sees it from
the standpoint of deterrence rather than justice between the par-
ties. The whole point of imposing tort liability in order to deter
unreasonable behavior is to give potential injurers the incentive to
compare the amount of liability that they anticipate they will incur
from taking a particular risk with the cost of reducing that risk by
taking safety precautions. But the amount of liability they will
incur from any given risky act is utterly variable, because the
amount of damages suffered by any given victim is almost random.
Insurance companies and repeat-player defendants may be able to
predict with a fair amount of reliability how frequently they will be
held liable, but the severity of the injury that any given victim is
likely to suffer is in fact much harder to predict. Designing a truck
without extra strength in its doors risks greater injury in side-
collisions, but a collision under a particular set of circumstances
may cause no harm, a sprained ankle, or death. The best that
potential injurers (or their insurers) threatened with liability can
do is to anticipate that, if a risk they take materializes in harm,
they will incur liability equal to the average amount of damages
that a potential victim will suffer.

From a deterrence standpoint, therefore, requiring proof of
causation is not a moral imperative, but simply a way of communi-
cating to the defendant in advance the scope of the liability it will
face. If we had another way of threatening potential defendants
with liability for the cost of the risks they take without requiring
proof of causation, and charging defendants with this amount of
liability—for example, by imposing liability for average damages
rather than those actually caused in any given case—then this
alternative approach could serve the aim of deterrence just as well,
if not better. Usually there is no reliable and accurate way of
threatening liability so as to achieve optimal deterrence without
requiring proof of causation. So the but-for test is used. On the rare
occasions when alternatives to the conventional test for causation
are available, however, the law sometimes carves out exceptions to
the conventional test, discussed next.

125
TORT LAW

B. Injury Caused by Multiple Sufficient Causes

The first set of problems involves cases in which two forces
converge on the plaintiff, and either one alone would have been
sufficient to cause all of the plaintiff’s harm. In cases of ‘‘overdeter-
mined causation” of this sort,? sometimes the forces converge
simultaneously, sometimes sequentially. Sometimes only one of
these causes is negligent, sometimes both are negligent. To assure
that the differences between these situations is clear, I will use the
classic illustration of two fires reaching the plaintiff's house, either
one of which is sufficient to destroy the house. But of course the
point of the illustrations is that the fires represent forces set in
motion by different parties and that these might be defendants
causing injury not involving fires, but products, toxic substances,
drivers, trains, or other forces.

1. Two Simultaneous Causes: Both Negligent

Suppose that two independently and negligently-set fires are
burning toward the plaintiff's house. Either alone would be suffi-
cient to destroy the house, but they both reach the house at the
same time, destroying it together. In a suit against those who set
the fires, the plaintiff cannot satisfy the but-for test: but-for either
defendant’s negligence, the house would have been destroyed any-
way. Nonetheless, the courts universally hold that neither defen-
dant can escape liability on this ground. Both are held to have
caused the plaintiff’s loss.

One way to explain this result is to say that, although neither
defendant was a but-for cause of the plaintiff's harm, each was a
substantial factor. I think that a more fruitful and candid way of
explaining this result, however, is to understand that both the but-
for and substantial-factor tests are not definitions of the concept of
causation, but merely useful proxies for the concept. Here the tests
don’t really capture what we mean in ordinary language by
“cause.” Picture each fire reaching a different portion of the house
at the same time and starting to burn the walls. Everyone would
say that each fire was an actual physical cause of the harm. It
would be absurd to say that neither was a cause of the harm, when
in fact both were, and doubly absurd to deny the plaintiff recovery
because his house happened to be destroyed by two defendants
rather than one. Moreover, here the choice is between over-imposi-
tion of liability (since the harm will occur anyway even when one of

9. See Jane Stapleton, Legal Cause: Cause-in-Fact and the Scope of Liability for
Consequences, 54 Vanp. L. Rev. 941 (2001).

126
CAUSE-IN-FACT

the defendants is careful), and under-imposition of imposition of
liability. The law chooses the former, threatening ‘‘too much”’
liability rather than too little.

2. Two Simultaneous Causes: One Negligent, One Not

Next suppose the same facts, except that only one of the two
fires is negligently set. Again, the but-for test is not satisfied,
though here too one might say that the substantial-factor test is
satisfied. Whether the negligent party should be liable even though
the but-for test is not satisfied is a close question. Clearly the
negligent party’s fire was a physical cause of some of the damage; it
would be peculiar to say that it was not. On the other hand, the
house would have been destroyed even absent that party’s negli-
gence, and if that party is held liable it will be liable for the entire
amount of the loss, since the other party’s fire was not negligently
set. Imposing liability on the negligent party will give such parties
the incentive to take precautions against harms that will occasion-
ally occur anyway because of a simultaneous non-negligent cause.
And here the plaintiff has much less basis for objecting to denying
his recovery here than where both fires are negligent, because here
his house would have been destroyed regardless of what the negli-
gent party did. Many courts do not hold the negligent defendant
liable in this situation, but some courts do. And as discussion of the
following hypothetical demonstrates, it is essential to the courts
that do impose liability in such cases that the negligent fire arrive
no later than the non-negligent fire.

3. Sequential Causes: Pre-emptive Causation

Next, suppose that two fires arrive sequentially. The first
totally destroys the plaintiff's house, very shortly after which the
second arrives. Again, neither fire can be said to be a but-for cause
of the harm, but the first fire was the actual physical cause of the
harm: it was what might be called the “‘pre-emptive” cause. Proba-
bly this is enough to explain why the party responsible for the first
fire is liable if the fire was negligently set, and why the party
responsible for the second fire is not responsible, even if that fire
was negligently set. Sometimes one party is negligent but lucky
enough not to cause harm, either because no one is harmed, or (as
here) because some other earlier force has already caused harm
that one’s own negligence would have caused, but for that force.
The first fire was not a but-for cause, but physically did the
damage. The second fire risked harm, but simply was not a cause of
the harm, no matter how one defines that concept. The party

127
TORT LAW

responsible for the first fire, and only that party, can be held liable,
assuming he was negligent.

Although these rules are firmly established, they are not en-
tirely consistent with analogous rules. For example, suppose I am
on my way to the airport to catch a plane and you negligently run
into me and break my leg. As a result, I miss my plane. That plane
crashes, killing everyone aboard. You are still liable to me for my
broken leg. On the other hand, if I have terminal cancer and you
negligently break my leg, the damages you owe me will take into
account the fact that I have only a few months to live. In the first
hypothetical the damages you owe me are not affected by the fact
that I would have lived only a few hours if you had not struck me,
whereas in the second hypothetical the damages you owe me are
affected by my life expectancy. It is true that the former hypotheti-
cal is treated under the law of causation, whereas the latter is
treated under the law of damages. And in the former hypothetical
my life expectancy was determined by outside forces (the plane
crash) that had not yet materialized, whereas in the latter hypo-
thetical my life expectancy was determined by internal forces (my
cancer) that had already materialized. But it is not clear why these
distinctions should make a difference. In the former case an act of
negligence entirely pre-empts a later probable cause, whereas in the
latter case an act of negligence only partially pre-empts a later
probable cause. The treatment of the two cases thus does not seem
entirely consistent, though the differential treatment seems com-
pelled by the applicable rules.

C. Joint and Several Liability

When, for whatever reason, two or more defendants are liable
to the plaintiff for the same harm, the law typically treats them
under the doctrine of ‘‘joint and several liability.’’ This is a confus-
ing phrase that more nearly means “entire liability.” In situations
like the first fire hypothetical discussed above, for example, the
parties responsible for each negligently set fire would have been
held jointly and severally liable to the plaintiff. This means that
each is liable to the plaintiff as if he were the sole wrongdoer,
responsible for the entirety of the plaintiff's damages. The plaintiff
is therefore entitled to recover the full amount of his damages from
either defendant. However, the plaintiff cannot ever recover more
than the amount of his damages; if he has recovered the entire
amount from one defendant, he can recover nothing in addition
from the other defendant. And if he has recovered some from one

defendant, then he can recover only the remainder from the other
defendant.

128
CAUSE-IN-FACT

At common law that was the end of the matter. When one
defendant paid the plaintiff in full the second defendant who paid
nothing to the plaintiff got a windfall, and when each defendant
paid only a portion that was the way things stayed. This obviously
unfair result has long since been remedied in every state by
statutes that create rights of contribution among jointly and sever-
ally liable tortfeasors in such situations. A right of contribution is
essentially a right to be reimbursed by another defendant for a
share of the amount paid to the plaintiff. Traditionally such rights
operated on a straight fractional-share basis. Thus, if there were
two jointly and severally liable defendants, a defendant paying the
plaintiff in full was entitled to contribution from the other defen-
dant equal to one-half of the amount paid; if there were three
jointly and severally liable defendants, the defendant paying the
plaintiff in full was entitled to contribution from each of the other
defendants equal to one-third of the amount paid, and so on. That
is still the approach taken in some states.

Since the net effect of rights of contribution is to allocate a
share of responsibility to each co-defendant, one might then ask
why this complicated method of allocating responsibility among
multiple defendants is followed. Why not simply hold each defen-
dant liable to the plaintiff for its share in the first instance? The
answer is that one or more of the defendants may be insolvent or
otherwise impossible to collect from. Imposing joint and several
liability places the risk of any defendant’s insolvency on the other
defendant or defendants rather than on the plaintiff. As between an
innocent plaintiff and a group of negligent or otherwise-liable
defendants, it is preferable for the defendants to bear the risk that
one of their number cannot pay its share.

But in recent years contributory negligence has been replaced
by comparative negligence in most states, as we will see in Chapter
Seven. Now, the plaintiff is not always innocent. A negligent
plaintiff is not barred from recovery; his recovery is reduced in
proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to him. So
many states now assess contribution shares of co-defendants in
proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to each co-
defendant, rather than on a straight fractional basis. And several
dozen states have enacted statutes modifying their rules governing
joint and several liability itself. Some impose such liability, for
example, only on a defendant whose negligence consists of more
than 50 percent of the negligence attributable to all the defendants.

Joint and several liability is imposed in three main situations.
First, the defendants may be joint tortfeasors. If you and I together
engage in a joint enterprise (e.g., a business partnership) and one of

129
TORT LAW

us is negligent, then we are jointly and severally liable for harm
that results. Second, independent tortfeasors are jointly and several-
ly liable for a single, theoretically indivisible harm. For example,
suppose that one defendant speeds through an intersection and
another fails to stop at a red light. The two vehicles collide and one
runs onto the sidewalk, injuring a pedestrian. Under the but-for
test for causation each defendant is a cause-in-fact of the pedestri-
an’s injuries, because neither alone would have been sufficient to
cause the injury. But because there is no way, even theoretically, to
pinpoint the extent of either defendant’s causal responsibility for
the pedestrian’s harm, each is jointly and severally liable for that
harm.

Finally, independent tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable
for a single, theoretically divisible but practically indivisible harm.
At early common law the plaintiff could not recover because he
could not prove the amount of harm each defendant caused, but the
modern rule is that each defendant is entitled to prove how much
harm it caused. If this proof is successful, liability is apportioned
based on the amount of harm caused by each defendant. But
otherwise all defendants are held jointly and severally liable for all
the plaintiffs harm. For example, in Maddux v. Donaldson," one
defendant’s negligence caused a collision with the plaintiff’s vehicle,
and then a second defendant’s negligence caused a second collision.
In theory each defendant caused a certain portion of the plaintiff’s
harm, but for practical purposes the harm was indivisible—because
the evidence did not support an inference as to the amount of
injury caused by each defendant.

D. Indeterminate Causes

A cluster of cases that is especially troublesome under the
conventional rules governing proof of causation is comprised of
those in which a plaintiff is clearly injured by tortious conduct but
cannot prove which of several possible defendants was more proba-
bly than not the actual cause of his or her injury, or a defendant
has clearly injured some but not all plaintiffs, and they cannot
prove which of them the defendant injured. These problems have
generated a number of classic cases, and several different ap-

proaches that constitute exceptions to the conventional test for
causation.

CAUSE-IN-FACT

1. Alternative Liability: Summers v. Tice

In Summers" two different hunters negligently shot in the
direction of the plaintiff, a third hunter. One shot struck the eye of
the plaintiff, who sued both hunters. Each defendant was as
probably as not the but-for cause of injury to the plaintiff, but not
more probably than not the cause. The court held that under these
circumstances the burden shifted to each of the defendants to
disprove that he had caused the harm. But in practice Summers is
ordinarily understood to involve more than a mere shift of the
burden of proof on the causation issue. It is the classic case of
“alternative” liability, imposing liability on negligent defendants,
each of whom is equally likely to have harmed the plaintiff.

The rationale for the decision is not easy to find in the
Summers opinion. The court apparently sought to justify its deci-
sion by saying that applying the conventional but-for approach
would exonerate the defendants, even though both were negligent
and the injury resulted from the negligence of only one of them.
This is not a reason for dispensing with the but-for test, however,
but just an assertion of the obvious: that applying the but-for test
sometimes relieves a negligent defendant of liability. Making that
point does not explain or justify departing from it. Interestingly,
alternative liability is rare, and the cases in which it is applied
often involve only two defendants. This limitation suggests that an
explanation for the result in Summers and some of the other cases
in which the doctrine of alternative liability is applied is that each
defendant is so nearly ‘‘more probably than not’’ the cause of the
harm that the courts are unwilling to immunize them from liabili-
ty. Add a third defendant and this dramatically ceases to be true:
the per defendant probability drops from 50 percent to 33 and 1/8
percent. There can be little doubt that the courts’ comfort level will
be much higher in cases involving only two defendants, but this
cannot be the entire explanation, because there are decisions apply-
ing alternative liability where there are three or more defendants.

I think that another factor involved in cases invoking alterna-
tive liability is the connection between or among defendants. Pure
strangers are much less likely to be subject to this doctrine than
defendants who are in some sense acting in the same “arena.”
Notice that if the defendants in Summers had been involved in an
actual joint enterprise of the sort described in the preceding sec-
tion, then they would have been held joint and severally liable
without need for proof of which of them had caused the plaintiff’s
harm. Perhaps the plaintiff did not contend that they were part of a

11. 199 P.2d 1 (Cal. 1948).

131
TORT LAW

joint enterprise out of fear that, if they were, he would have been
considered part of the same enterprise, their negligence would have
been attributed to him, and he would have been barred from
recovery by attributed contributory negligence. But the two defen-
dants were acting in the same “‘arena’’—they were hunting togeth-
er. Defendants who had been hunting separately would have been
less likely to be subject to alternative liability. Indeed, RESTATEMENT
(THIRD) oF Torts § 28, Comment j implies that the existence of a
“close connection” between or among defendants characterizes
many alternative liability cases. So it may be that some sort of
nexus or connection among defendants tends to be a necessary
condition to the application of the doctrine, especially in cases
involving more than two defendants.

2. Industry—-Wide Liability: Hall v. E.I.
Du Pont De Nemours & Co., Inc.

In Hall,” six manufacturers of blasting caps were sued by
thirteen children injured in separate accidents. The court held that
if a child could establish that it was more likely than not that any
of the six defendants manufactured the particular cap that caused
that child’s injury, then the burden shifted to each defendant to
prove that a cap it manufactured did not cause the injury in
question. The theory behind the decision in Hall has never been
entirely clear, but it seems to rest on two factors: a) the fact that
the defendants acted consciously in parallel to produce caps in a
fashion that made their manufacturer difficult to identify after they
exploded, plus b) the comparatively small number of defendants.
The flavor of the opinion suggests that, although the defendants
may not have acted together to cause the injuries at issue, the
threat of liability in similar situations in the future might encour-
age industries with a small number of companies to act together
either to prevent injury, or at least to take steps that would enable
victims to identify the individual company responsible when a
product did cause injury.

3. Loss of a Chance to Survive

Herskovits v. Group Health Cooperative and Matsuyama v.
Birnbaum" are the best known of a series of decisions that involve
an already-injured or ill plaintiff, whose chances of recovery or
survival are reduced by the negligent actions of the defendant. Both
involve the failure of a physician to diagnose cancer, from which

12. 345 F.Supp. 353 (E.D.N.Y.1972).

14. 452 Mass. 1, 890 N.E.2d 819 (2008).

132
CAUSE-IN-FACT

the patient would have had a better chance of surviving if the
physician had not missed the diagnosis. And in both cases, the
patient died. But in both cases, the patient’s chance of surviving
even if he had been properly diagnosed was less than 50 percent.
That is, in each case it was not more probable than not that, but for
the defendant’s negligence, the death would not have occurred. So
under the conventional but-for test, there would have been no
recovery.

For example, the defendant in Herskovits failed to diagnose the
plaintiff's cancer until his chances of survival were only 25 percent.
There was testimony, however, that even absent the defendant’s
malpractice (i.e, but for the malpractice), Herskovits’ chances of
survival would have been only 39 percent and his chances of dying
therefore 61 percent. The court nonetheless held that there could
be a recovery, though not for all of the damages resulting from
Herskovits’ death. The majority opinion did not specify how dam-
ages were to be calculated, but a concurrence suggested a method
that the case has come to stand for: the plaintiff should recover 14
percent of his damages.

One way to describe what happened is to say that the defen-
dant is held liable for the loss of the opportunity to survive. That is
how the Herskovits and Matsuyama courts described it. Superficial-
ly this description can be squared with the traditional statement of
the plaintiff's burden of proving causation, since in a sense the
defendant was more probably than not the but-for cause of this loss
of or reduction in decedent’s chances. Indeed, the defendant was
100 percent responsible for this 14 percent reduction in Herskovits.

It is important for the courts to understand the claim in this
way not only because it aligns with the traditional requirement of
proving but-for causation, but because the courts would otherwise
be on a slippery slope. Describing the recovery as compensating for
loss of a chance avoids awarding damages based on the probability
that the defendant caused the harm, which might undermine the
but-for requirement more generally. To see why, suppose that,
instead of looking at the loss of a chance, we were to look at the
probability that the defendant’s negligence caused the plaintiff's
death. The defendant’s negligence in Herskovits increased the
plaintiffs risk of dying from 61 percent to 75 percent. Consequent-
ly, the probability that the defendant’s negligence caused the plain-
tiffs death was 19 percent (14/75), and implies that the plaintiff
should recover 19 percent of the value of the patient’s life, not 14
percent. This latter description not only would yield a different
measure of damages, but also would imply a different explanation
for the results in Herskovits and Matsuyama and a less confining

133
TORT LAW

rule. If that were the approach taken, it would seem to be just one
example of a more general problem: the defendant who can never
be proved more probably than not to have caused any particular
individual’s injuries, but whose behavior over time is likely to
injure 19 percent of the individuals whose harm his actions risk.
But of course damages are not awarded in such cases.

Describing recovery as loss of a chance avoids this potential
inconsistency, but it does not avoid all inconsistency. There are
many cases in which a defendant’s negligence causes the plaintiff to
lose a chance, but there is no recovery. The pest-control company
that negligently fails to find insects in a house that would have had
less than a 50 percent chance of avoiding infestation even if they
had been discovered is an example. So is the negligent failure of a
911 operator to obtain accurate information from a caller, even
when the chance of rescuing the caller would have been less than
50 percent in the absence of negligence. If chance has value, this
explanation for the lost-chance cases argues for applying the doc-
trine to any lost-chance situation.

But this is not done. There is liability for loss of a chance only
in medical cases. One possible explanation is that, in contrast to
other negligent defendants, health care providers undertake to
maximize a patient’s chances of survival, and that their failure to
do so should be actionable. Ordinary actors who negligently risk
causing harm have not undertaken such a duty, but certainly the
pest-control company and 911 service have undertaken duties to
make people or their property safer. It can also be argued that, if
physicians in situations such as Herskovits and Matsuyama were
not liable, they would have insufficient legally created incentives to
exercise care in treating patients with probably-fatal conditions.
But physicians have non-legal incentives to do so; presumably they
became physicians in part because they wanted to help cure such
patients. And in any event, this is a deterrence-based argument
that apparently is not weighty enough to persuade the courts to
apply the rule to all lost-chance cases, so it is not clear why such an
argument would be more persuasive in the medical context.

The explanation that is more persuasive to me is that there is
scientifically valid data about survival rates in many medical
cases—especially those involving cancer such as Herskovits and
Matsuyama—but there is much less often valid data in other
situations. Limiting loss of a chance cases to medical situations
avoids litigating on a case-by-case basis whether the loss of a
chance doctrine should apply across the board, and avoids litigating
the validity of data in other types of cases.

134
CAUSE-IN-FACT

Whether or not these various possible distinctions are persua-
sive, somehow the lost-chance cases appear on the surface to be
sufficiently different from the general problem of risking harm that
the courts are satisfied that this class of cases can stand on its own.
Moreover, because it is rare in any kind of case to have reliable
quantitative data on the precise probability that the defendant’s
action caused the plaintiff harm, the issue usually can simply be
sidestepped on this ground.

4. Market-Share Liability

The defendants in the seminal market-share liability case,
Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories,” were manufacturers of the drug
DES. The class of plaintiffs consisted of women whose mothers had
taken the drug while they were pregnant. The plaintiffs/daughters
alleged that they suffered injury as a result of exposure to DES in
utero. The problem was that no individual plaintiff could identify
which manufacturer or manufacturers had made the DES that her
mother had taken. The court circumvented this problem by holding
that the plaintiffs need not prove individual causation. Rather, each
plaintiff could recover from each defendant a portion of her dam-
ages equal to the defendant’s share of the market for DES.

The theory behind Sindell is that, once it is clear that each
defendant’s DES injured some of the plaintiffs, the defendants
should not escape liability merely because the plaintiffs cannot
show which defendant injured which plaintiff. Because the DES
made by the defendants was chemically identical, market share was
a very accurate surrogate for the amount of harm each defendant
caused. Consequently, imposing liability on defendants in propor-
tion to market share forces each defendant to pay compensation for
the amount of injury it caused, although not necessarily to those
particular persons harmed by any given manufacturer’s DES. In
terms of deterrence this approach is optimal in theory, because
each defendant pays what it should. Corrective justice is less well
served by market-share liability, however, because there is no
matching up of each plaintiff with the defendant whose DES
injured her. Under market-share liability the wrong done to each
plaintiff is corrected, but it is not necessarily corrected by the party
who wronged that plaintiff.

Although market-share liability might seem at first glance to
be a solution to the general problem of proving causation in toxic
exposure cases, a number of practical considerations have limited
this approach to DES cases and a very few other claims. First, in

15. 607 P.2d 924 (1980).

135
TORT LAW

the DES cases the plaintiffs alleged that their disease—vaginal
adenocarcinoma—could be caused only by exposure to DES in utero.
This was in effect a ‘“‘signature disease”: if the plaintiff had that
disease, then it was caused by DES. But there are very few
signature diseases—diseases that have only one cause. Market-
share liability will work in cases of signature disease, because 100
percent of the market caused 100 percent of the disease. But when
there are also other causes of the disease suffered by the plaintiffs,
market-share is not an accurate surrogate for the total amount of
the disease caused by any given defendant, because some people
have a disease that was not caused by any of the defendants. For
this reason, market share liability has overwhelmingly been reject-
ed in cases involving such other substances as asbestos, lead-based
paint, and other drugs.

Second, the same toxic substances produced by different defen-
dants are not always chemically identical. For example, in Skip-
worth v. Lead Industries Association,’* the court refused to apply
market-share liability to manufacturers of lead pigment that was in
the past used in house paint, in part because different pigments
had different chemical formulations. Because these pigments there-
fore resulted in different levels of bioavailability to the plaintiffs,
different manufacturers did not necessarily cause harm in propor-
tion to their market shares.

Third, even when the substances produced by different defen-
dants are chemically identical and plaintiffs do suffer from a
signature disease, the relevant market-share data is not always
available, especially when the relevant time period for determining
market share—as in the case of DES—is twenty or more years
before suit. And in any event, it is not clear which is the relevant
market: national, state, or local. This choice would not only affect
the relative shares of each defendant, but conceivably who was
liable in the first instance: would a particular defendant be permit-
ted to show, for example, that it did not market its product in the
state where the plaintiff lived when she was exposed to the risk of
harm, or would that be considered irrelevant?

Finally, usually it is not feasible to sue all possible defendants.
Some have gone out of business, others may not be subject to the
jurisdiction of the court where suit is brought. The result is that
less than 100 percent of the relevant market is before the court.
What is the scope of the liability to be shouldered by the defendants
who are before the court in such a situation? A relative-market-
share approach (which seemed to have been taken by Sindell itself,

16. 547 Pa. 224, 690 A.2d 169 (1997).

136
CAUSE-IN-FACT

and only later set aside)" is to require that a substantial share of
the market be joined as defendants in the suit, and then to hold
those defendants liable (in proportion to their market shares) for
100 percent of the plaintiff's damages. Thus, if defendants who held
80 percent of the relevant market were joined in the suit, a
defendant who had held 20 percent of the market would pay 25
percent (20/80) of the plaintiff's damages. This approach has the
obvious disadvantage of imposing ‘‘excessive”’ liability on the defen-
dants who are liable, much as does joint and several liability when
some defendants are judgment-proof. The alternative, absolute-
market-share approach, is to hold defendants liable only for their
actual market share. One disadvantage of this approach is that the
plaintiff is incompletely compensated for his or her losses. Another
is that a multiplicity of suits may result unless there is a require-
ment that a substantial share of the market be joined in any suit,
even though liability will be based on absolute rather than relative
market shares.

These concerns reflect more than merely practical problems to
be solved. Each concern suggests how market-share liability in
practice may fail to achieve the theory behind this form of liability:
there are so few signature diseases that market-share liability may
be useful only occasionally; the limitations of market-share infor-
mation may render accurate imposition of liability difficult; the
same product made by different manufacturers is not always fungi-
ble; and in most cases there will either be over-imposition of
liability or under-compensation of the plaintiff. This combination of
difficulties has prompted only about a third of the courts to apply
market-share liability to DES cases, and for many courts to reject
market-share liability outright. A few courts have applied the
concept to other products, such as lead pigment in paint and the
gasoline additive MTBE.

5. Toxic Harms and Statistical Proof of Causation

Consider now the class of non-market-share cases in which an
identified defendant has caused injury, but it is not possible to
prove which individuals the defendant has injured. For example,
suppose that exposure to a substance made by a single manufactur-
er causes some, but not all of a particular type of cancer—say, 60
percent. With respect to any given plaintiff suffering that form of
cancer, the defendant is more probably than not the but-for cause
of the plaintiff's harm. For some courts this would be enough proof
of causation. For most courts, however, this form of statistical or
epidemiological evidence might be admissible but would be insuffi-

17. See Brown v. Superior Court (Abbott Laboratories), 751 P.2d 470 (1988).

137
TORT LAW

cient, standing alone, to prove causation, because no plaintiff is able
to prove anything about causation in his or her particular situation,
but only about similarly situated plaintiffs in general.

Why is ‘“‘naked”’ statistical evidence of this sort not sufficient
proof for most courts? After all, statistical evidence is simply
quantitative proof of probability, and probability is really all that
anyone ever proves about causation. For example, suppose that a
plaintiff introduces evidence sufficient to support a jury inference
that, but for the defendant’s having exceeded the speed limit, he
would have been able to control his vehicle and would not have
struck the plaintiff's vehicle. The plaintiff really has done nothing
more than prove facts from which a jury could conclude that in
more than half of the instances in which the two drivers act as the
defendant and plaintiff did act, the defendant’s negligence will
cause the plaintiff injury. That evidence at its core is neither
different from nor superior to statistics. If anything, when there is
actual statistical data on the causation issue, the plaintiff's evi-
dence is entitled to more weight than in the collision case, because
statistical data actually quantifies the probability of causation
based on something more than casual experience. In the ordinary
case such as the collision accident there is no such data, but only
general experience on which to base a conclusion. The unwilling-
ness of some courts to rely on statistical or epidemiological proof
may therefore reflect their misconception of what goes on in the
ordinary case.

On the other hand, many courts probably understand full well
what they are doing when they hold that proof based on naked
statistical evidence alone is insufficient. They may be reluctant to
encourage litigants to gather supposedly objective data about the
probability of causation that will tend to be reflected in a battle of
experts whose data often will conflict. Or they may be content to
live with the all-or-nothing rule that imposes liability on the
defendant for 100 percent of the plaintiff's damages when the
defendant is more likely than not the cause of the plaintiff’s harm,
as long as this “discrepancy” between certainty and probability is
not too obvious. Statistics bring the discrepancy right out into the
open. Moreover, the aims of deterrence are perfectly well served in
ordinary cases by threatening the same defendants with liability for
100 percent of the plaintiff's damages in some cases and no liability
in others, even when in each case there is only a probability of
causation, higher than 50 percent when there is liability and lower
than 50 percent when there is not. Finally, permitting the parties
to rely exclusively on statistics might discourage the discovery of
particularized, non-statistical evidence.

138
CAUSE-IN-FACT

In the long run pretty much the right amount of liability
probably is threatened and imposed by this all-or-nothing approach
in ordinary cases. Potential defendants who risk injuring others
typically cannot know in advance whether they will be advantaged
or disadvantaged by the all-or-nothing approach to liability. Conse-
quently, the threat of full liability when they have more probably
than not caused the plaintiff's harm, and no liability when they
have less probably than not caused such harm, is just as likely to
create optimal incentives as a more complicated approach that
would award proportional damages, and without the higher trans-
action costs that would inevitably be associated with a more compli-
cated approach.

What is true in the ordinary case, however, often is not true in
the extraordinary case. Suppose, for example, that in the cancer
hypothetical the substance manufactured by the defendant causes
only 30 percent of all the cancers of a particular type. In that
scenario the defendant is less probably than not a but-for cause of
any given plaintiff's harm. The manufacturer therefore knows in
advance that under the conventional approach to causation it will
never be held liable for any of the harm that its product causes. The
conventional approach therefore cannot create its normal incentive
effect in this situation, because the defendant does not face the
prospect of “‘too much”’ liability in some cases and ‘‘too little’ in
others. Instead there is always too little liability (i.e., none) threat-
ened. The theoretically ideal alternative to denying liability in such
cases would be to charge the defendant with liability proportional
to every plaintiff's damages. Thus, if the defendant were proved to
have caused 30 percent of the cancers in question, it would be liable
for 30 percent of each plaintiff's damages. A number of commenta-
tors have proposed various versions of this approach.”

Yet this approach has not been adopted, for at least two
reasons. First, there are few cases in which there is reliable
quantitative data to support taking such an approach. Until there
are a sufficient number of such cases, making such a radical change
seems unwarranted. Second, if it were possible to identify the cases
in which the defendant is systematically underdeterred because of
its advance knowledge that it will never be a more-probable-than-
not cause, then imposing proportional liability in these cases alone
could make sense. But in the absence of the capacity to identify
these cases, the logic of such “‘proportional liability’? would be
difficult to contain. If we were to adopt proportional liability in
order to prevent underdeterrence in cases in which the defendant is

definitely a cause of some harm but less probably than not the
cause of any particular plaintiff's harm, then why not be consistent
and also adopt proportional liability when the defendant is more
probably than not, but only more probably than not, the cause of a
plaintiff's harm? If proportional liability is designed to remedy
underdeterrence, then why not also use it to remedy overdeter-
rence? The answer, of course, is that adopting this approach would
require so radical a shift in the way causation is determined and
damages are calculated that no one even imagines that we would do
this across-the-board. For both reasons, I think, there has been no
real move to adopt proportional liability in cases involving the
indeterminate plaintiff.

CAUSE

A defendant is not necessarily liable for all the harm that his or
her breach of the applicable standard of care has caused. This
Chapter concerns the scope of such liability. Even after it is
determined that the defendant is under a duty to exercise reason-
able care, and even after the plaintiff has proved the other elements
of his case (breach of duty, damages, and cause in fact), liability is
not imposed unless the defendant’s actions also were what is often
called a ‘‘proximate cause”’ of the plaintiff’s injury. Thus, after the
other prerequisites to liability are satisfied, the doctrine of proxi-
mate cause operates as a limitation on the scope of the defendant’s
liability. Remember, however, that in connection with negligence
suits we are still assuming the existence of a duty to exercise to
exercise reasonable care, an assumption that is relaxed when we
discuss duty in Chapter Eleven.

The proximate cause requirement also applies in strict liability
cases, which are discussed in Chapter Eight. For purposes of
analysis here, we will speak about proximate cause in negligence
cases. The strict liability analog to the proximate cause questions
discussed in this Chapter is to ask whether the plaintiff suffered a
harm, the risk of which is one of the bases for imposing strict
liability for engaging in the activity in question.

The rules governing the scope of the defendant’s liability have
long generated unnecessary confusion. In most cases the issue is
simple and straightforward. Difficulties arise because the cases in
which the issue is contestable tend to involve complex, unusual, or
even bizarre sets of facts. In addition, no single formulation of the
rules governing the scope of the defendant’s liability or the concept
of proximate cause can fully describe how these rules or the concept
is applied, because they are sometimes used as a ‘‘fudge-factor’’
that permits judges and juries to decide whether liability should be
imposed even after the other prerequisites to liability have already
been satisfied. Nonetheless, the fundamentals of the law governing
the scope of a defendant’s liability can be easily understood, espe-
cially if one takes care to distinguish the cases in which application
of the law is unremarkable from the rare, celebrated cases that

141
TORT LAW

have made proximate cause seem so perplexing. The following
Sections therefore deal first with the basics; then with the excep-
tional cases that tend to pose difficulties; and finally step back from
the details of the rules to try to understand what they are really
designed to do.

I. The Basics

Most cases posing the issue of proximate cause can be resolved
by the foreseeability test or by a closely related elaboration, the
harm-within-the-risk test. The key to both these tests is to under-
stand that proximate cause actually has as much to do with breach
of the standard of care, or the negligence issue, as with causation.

A. Foreseeability

In ordinary cases—whether they involve negligence or strict
liability—the touchstone of proximate cause is foreseeability. The
defendant’s negligence is a proximate cause of the plaintiff's harm
if causing that harm was a foreseeable result of acting as the
defendant did. In ordinary cases there is no question at all that if
the defendant was in fact negligent and this negligence was a cause
in fact of the plaintiff's harm, then the proximate cause require-
ment also is satisfied. For example, suppose that the defendant fails
to stop at a red light and collides with the plaintiff's vehicle. The
defendant is negligent, the plaintiff suffered damage, and the
defendant’s negligence caused that damage. But is the defendant’s
negligence a ‘“‘proximate’’ cause of the plaintiff's harm? Of course it
is. It was highly foreseeable that someone passing through the
intersection would be harmed if the defendant did not stop at the
red light. Indeed, the risk that this kind of harm would result from
running the red light is the principal basis for concluding that the
defendant was negligent. It is negligent to run a red light precisely
because it is foreseeable that running a red light will cause an
intersection collision. This is so indisputable that there is no
proximate cause issue to be decided as a question of fact in such a
case. If the defendant was negligent and this negligence was a cause
in fact of the plaintiffs injury, then as a matter of law the
negligence of the defendant also was a proximate cause of the
plaintiff's harm. At least in jurisdictions where jury instructions
distinguish clearly between cause in fact and proximate cause, the
jury will not even be instructed as to proximate cause; the only
question is whether the defendant was negligent.

142
THE SCOPE OF LIABILITY: PROXIMATE CAUSE

What does this have to do with causation? Not much. Use of
the term ‘‘proximate cause” in this setting is unfortunate and
misleading, which is why I have been describing proximate cause as
a ‘“‘scope of liability’ issue. The determination that is made under
the rubric of proximate cause has more to do with negligence than
with causation. The first phase of the negligence issue is whether
the defendant was negligent at all—unreasonably risked harming
someone or some thing. That issue is decided under the rubric of
negligence. The second phase of the negligence issue is whether the
harm to the particular plaintiff or class of those in his position was
a foreseeable result of the defendant’s negligence. That issue is
decided under the rubric of proximate cause. The first inquiry asks
a general, all-risks-considered question about whether the defen-
dant was negligent. The second inquiry asks a particular question
about the nature of the relation between the defendant’s negligence
and what actually happened to this plaintiff.

B. The Harm-Within-The-Risk Test

The foreseeability test for proximate cause is sometimes clari-
fied and sharpened by the harm-within-the-risk test. The run-of-
the-mill negligence case almost always automatically satisfies the
proximate cause requirement if the defendant was negligent. Con-
versely, there are occasional freak cases in which everyone would
agree that, as a matter of law, the defendant’s negligence was not a
proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury, because injury to the
plaintiff was not a harm-within-the-risk that made the defendant’s
action negligent.

For example, suppose that the defendant negligently parks his
car next to a fire hydrant. The principal risk posed by this act is
that blocked access to the hydrant will result in the destruction of
property or injury to people by fire, because firefighters cannot gain
easy access to the hydrant. Suppose now that the plaintiff, driving
by the hydrant where the defendant parked, skids on the road and
collides with the defendant’s parked vehicle. The plaintiff proves
that, but for the defendant’s negligence in being parked where he
was, the plaintiff would have been able to bring his vehicle safely to
a stop in the few extra feet of road space that would have been
available. Thus, the plaintiff has proved that the defendant was
negligent, that the plaintiff suffered injury, and that but for the
defendant’s negligence, the plaintiff would not have been injured.
But that is not enough. What about proximate cause?

The question can be answered by applying the harm-within-
the-risk test. Is the risk of the injury the plaintiff suffered one of

143
TORT LAW

the risks that makes the defendant negligent for blocking access to
the fire hydrant? Almost certainly not. This answer can be given so
confidently because the act of parking by the hydrant instead of a
dozen feet further down the street simply does not increase the risk
of the harm that materialized. A motorist passing by that spot is no
more likely to skid into a car parked negligently than into a car
parked a legal distance away from the hydrant. Negligence is
conduct that unreasonably increases the risk of harm, whereas the
act of negligence in this case did not at all increase the risk of what
happened. In this sense what happened was not foreseeable. That
is, the defendant’s negligence did not foreseeably increase the risk
that the same general type of harm that the plaintiff actually
suffered would occur. Note this use of the term “foreseeable.” Of
course what happened was ‘“‘foreseeable” in the sense of being
‘imaginable.’ But what happened was not foreseeable in the sense
that it is not one of the same set of risks we would want the
defendant to take into account in deciding whether to park by the
hydrant, because parking by the hydrant did not increase the risk
that the plaintiff would be harmed in that manner.

A number of well-known cases fall into this category. For
example, in Berry v. The Borough of Sugar Notch,' the question
was whether the negligence of operating a trolley above the speed
limit was a proximate cause of harm that resulted when a tree fell
on the speeding trolley as it passed by. Speeding did not at all
increase this risk. Rather, it was simply a coincidence that the
trolley was where it was when the tree fell, even though the trolley
would not have been at that precise point had it not been speeding.
Therefore, as a matter of law, the negligence at issue was not a
proximate cause of the damage that occurred. Similarly, in Gorris v.
Scott,?> sheep were washed overboard from a ship as a result of
negligent violation of a regulation requiring that they be kept in
pens. But the regulation was promulgated under a statute designed
to protect the sheep from contagious disease, not to keep them from
being washed overboard. In both Berry and Gorris, the harm in
question was not even arguably within the risk that had rendered
the action causing the harm negligent. Therefore, in both cases, the
courts held that the necessary element of proximate cause was
absent. In other words, the scope of the defendant’s liability for
negligence did not extend to these harms.

Thus far we have examined the ordinary cases in which there
is proximate cause as a matter of law, and the easy cases at the

2. LRQ Ex. 125 (1874).

144
THE SCOPE OF LIABILITY: PROXIMATE CAUSE

opposite extreme in which, as a matter of law, there is no proxi-
mate cause. In between lie cases that are a bit more difficult. Many
of these are difficult largely because the harm-within-the-risk test
does not easily resolve them. These are cases in which the risk that
the plaintiff would suffer the harm that actually materialized was
not the principal risk that rendered the defendant’s action negli-
gent, but that risk was nonetheless a foreseeable (one might say
“‘secondary”) and relevant risk. For example, suppose that the
defendant violates a statute requiring railroads to fence their rights
of way and as a result injures a two-year old who has wandered
onto the tracks. The legislative history of the statute reflects
concern for injury to livestock from unfenced rights of way. None-
theless, many courts would hold that a secondary purpose of such a
statute is to reduce the risk of injury to people as well as livestock.*
These courts would send the proximate cause issue to the jury.

Similar issues arise even when a statute is not involved. Then
the question is whether, although the risk that materialized in
harm was not the principal risk that made the defendant’s action
negligent, that risk was sufficiently significant to be a factor in the
negligence determination. This is simply another way of posing the
question, ‘“Was the defendant’s negligence a proximate cause of the
plaintiff's harm?’’ For example, in Wagner v. International Railway
Co.,‘ the defendant had been negligent in failing to close the door to
one of its cars, thereby permitting the plaintiff's cousin to be
thrown out as the car rounded a curve. The plaintiff was injured
while attempting, with others, to rescue his cousin. Clearly the
principal negligence of the defendant was in risking harm to
someone who might fall out through the unclosed door. The ques-
tion was whether the defendant’s negligence was also a proximate
cause of the plaintiff/rescuer’s harm. Writing for the court, Judge
Cardozo held that it was error to instruct the jury that the
defendant’s negligence was not a proximate cause of the plaintiff’s
harm unless he had been asked to assist in the rescue. Cardozo
explained this result with the famous phrase, “danger invites
rescue.”’ In effect the court held that one of the risks that makes it
negligent to risk harm to another (when it is in fact negligent to do
so) is the risk that a different individual will be injured while
attempting to rescue him from the consequences of the defendant’s
actions. That others will attempt to rescue someone whose safety
the defendant’s actions put at risk is foreseeable; therefore harm to
the rescuer is within the cluster of risks that makes the defendant’s

New York Central Railway, 231 N.Y. 94, 181 N.E. 746 (1921).

145
TORT LAW

actions negligent—or so the jury may find. And many jurisdictions
now hold that, as a matter of law, negligently-caused danger invites
rescue.

The foreseeability and harm-within-the-risk tests, then, are a
fairly straightforward way of attempting to understand the basic
scope of a defendant’s liability for negligence and thereby to under-
stand the doctrine of proximate cause. One cannot stop there,
however, for two reasons. First, when the tests are satisfied, there
is usually liability for physical harm. But even when the tests are
not satisfied, occasionally there is liability nonetheless. Second, the
cases that pose difficult scope of liability, or proximate cause issues,
come in enough varieties that further examination of the subject is
necessary to gain a complete appreciation of the way it is handled.

II. Advanced Issues

Most of the issues that are not directly and immediately
resolved by the foreseeability and harm-within-the risk tests fall
into one of three categories: (1) cases in which the harm the
plaintiff suffers is remote in time or space from the negligent
conduct of the defendant; (2) cases of intervention and enablement,
in which one party negligently enables-or increases the risk that
another party will be engage in tortious conduct; and (3) cases
involving the issue of what must be foreseeable or, to put it another
way, when liability may be imposed even when some aspect of what
occurred was unforeseeable.

A. Remoteness in Time or Space, and Directness

One of the literal meanings of “‘proximate’”’ is ‘‘close.’’ It is no
surprise, therefore, that as the proximate cause requirement devel-
oped, the courts sometimes said that there was no liability if the
defendant’s negligence was only a ‘‘remote’’ cause of harm. Usually
the courts meant that the harm the plaintiff suffered was at some
remove, in time, space, or both, from the defendant’s negligence.
For example, suppose the defendant negligently moors a boat to a
dock, the boat floats down the river, bumps into and thereby sets
another boat adrift, and three days later that second boat damages
a draw bridge. The issue is whether the defendant’s negligence was
a proximate cause of damage to the plaintiff’s bridge.

Historically, many courts would have analyzed this issue by
asking whether the harm to the bridge was too remote in time and
space from the defendant’s negligence for that negligence to consti-

146
THE SCOPE OF LIABILITY: PROXIMATE CAUSE

tute a proximate cause. Some courts asked what amounts to the
same question using a ‘‘directness” test. Under this test, the
defendant’s negligence constituted a proximate cause if that negli-
gence caused harm to the plaintiff ‘‘directly.”” Of course, in order
for harm to be caused directly, the defendant’s negligence must
almost always be close in time and space to the occurrence of harm.
Courts sometimes talked (and sometimes still talk) about a ‘‘chain”’
of causation, using the number of links in the chain as a metaphor
for proximity and/or directness.

Both remoteness and directness, however, have tended to fade
away as tests for analyzing the proximate cause issue. Certainly
very few courts now use the directness test. Instead, both remote-
ness and directness have been subsumed as considerations that are
relevant, among others, under the foreseeability and harm-within-
the-risk tests. Other things being equal, the closer the defendant’s
negligence is in time and space to the harm suffered by the
plaintiff, and the more direct that connection, the more foreseeable
the harm was to the defendant, and the stronger the arguments for
the proposition that the risk of this very sort of occurrence is a
harm within the risk that made the defendant negligent. Thus, to
return to the above hypothetical, the question for most contempo-
rary courts, in deciding whether to submit the proximate cause
issue to the jury, would not be whether the harm the boat caused to
the draw bridge was remote, or indirect, but how foreseeable a
result of the defendant’s negligence a jury could find the harm to
the draw bridge to have been. The closeness of the bridge in time
and space to the defendant’s negligence, and how directly harm
occurred, would be relevant considerations, but they would not be
determinative.

Thus, remoteness and directness are no longer accepted as
independent tests for proximate cause because there are occasions
on which harm is both remote and indirect, but still highly foresee-
able. For example, a defendant can foresee that fireworks it negli-
gently manufactures in New York and ships across the country in
January may cause harm in California on July 4th. Harm from
fireworks that then occurs to a plaintiff in California on that day is
remote in time and space, and indirect, but it is foreseeable none-
theless. The defendant’s negligence in such a case is, or at the least
may be found by a jury to be, a proximate cause of that harm.

B. Intervention and Enablement

A problem that requires some elaboration of the foreseeability
and harm-within-the risk tests involves what are sometimes called

147
TORT LAW

intervening or superseding causes. In such cases the subsequent
acts of independent third-parties or forces are the immediate cause
of harm, but the original negligence of the defendant is also a cause
in fact of that harm. Then the question is whether the “‘first actor”’
is or is not relieved of liability because of the subsequent acts of the
‘“‘second actor’? or because of the operation of a subsequent force.

The early courts considering questions like this followed the
“last wrongdoer” rule, under which only the second actor’s negli-
gence was a proximate cause of the harm to the plaintiff. One
rationale for the rule appears to have been the mechanical and
arbitrary assumption of the early common law that there could be
only one proximate cause of a harm in this context. Another part of
the rationale for the rule, however, was that the first actor should
not be responsible for the negligence of the second actor. Although
the last wrongdoer rule disappeared long ago, some residue of this
second rationale still lingers in analysis of intervention and enable-
ment cases. The issue is just how responsible the first actor should
be for the harm caused by the intentional wrongdoing, negligence,
or non-negligent conduct of the second actor. Unsurprisingly, this
varies with the situation, though it tends to depend on how foresee-
able the second actor’s conduct was to the first actor.

Sometimes this question is first addressed by the courts under
the rubric of whether the first actor owed any duty to the plaintiff,
and (sometimes confusingly) this duty question sometimes also
turns at least in part on the foreseeability of the plaintiff. First let
us identify this duty question, so that we can distinguish it from
the intervention and enablement issues addressed in this Section
under proximate cause. Then, having identified this duty question
and distinguished it from the proximate cause question, we can set
aside the duty question until Chapter Eleven.

Suppose the defendant bartender serves a visibly intoxicated
patron who then leaves the bar by car and negligently injures the
plaintiff.* Or the defendant service station negligently leaves keys
in the ignition of a car parked on its lot for servicing, and a thief
who takes the car collides with the plaintiff.’ The question in the
first instance in each of these cases is whether the defendant owes
a duty to the plaintiff. The courts consider a number of factors in
deciding this question, including how foreseeable to the defendant
injury to parties in the plaintiff's position is, which party is in the
better position to insure against the risk of harm to the plaintiff,
and the degree of moral blame that can be ascribed to the first

148
THE SCOPE OF LIABILITY: PROXIMATE CAUSE

actor. If the duty question is answered in the negative, the cases is
over, because the defendant owed no duty to the plaintiff. For
example, most courts hold that a social host has no duty to third
parties to refrain from serving a guest too much alcohol. On the
other hand, assuming that the duty question is answered in the
affirmative, and the plaintiff proves the other elements of his case
(breach of duty, damages, and cause in fact) then the proximate
cause issue arises. Most courts hold, for example, that a bartender
in a commercial bar does owe a duty to third parties not to serve a
patron too much alcohol.

Turning now to the proximate cause issue, these typically are
cases in which the first actor has ‘‘enabled”’ the commission of a
subsequent tort.’ Under the fairly straightforward proximate cause
analysis set out above, whether the first actor’s negligence is a
proximate cause of injury caused by subsequent wrongdoing turns
on the foreseeability of the subsequent wrongdoing or subsequent
causal force. Standard terminology describes these situations as
involving only an “intervening” cause when the foreseeability of
injury to the plaintiff is one of the risks that is taken into account
in deciding whether the defendant’s actions were negligent. In this
situation the defendant’s negligence is a proximate cause of the
plaintiffs injury, or at least the issue is submitted to the jury. The
intervening act does not break the “‘chain” of causation leading
from the defendant’s act to the plaintiff's injury, because the
intervention is foreseeable. Some fact situations involving subse-
quent intervention are sufficiently recurring to be the subject of
rules. A driver whose negligence injures the plaintiff is a proximate
cause of injuries caused by the malpractice of a physician who
treats the plaintiff; a party who negligently loans a car to a driver
who is known to be reckless is a proximate cause of injuries
suffered by the driver’s victim. On the other hand, when the degree
of foreseeability of the risk of injury to one in the plaintiffs
position is debatable, then the question of proximate cause is not
the subject of a rule and will go to the jury. And when the risk of
injury to the plaintiff is so unforeseeable that it is not a factor to be
taken into account at all in deciding whether the defendant’s
actions were negligent, the subsequent act of a third-party or
operation of a new force is described as a “‘superseding”’ cause, and
as a matter of law the negligence of the defendant is not a
proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury. The subsequent act of
negligence supersedes the defendant’s act, because it breaks the
“chain” of causation.

7. See Robert L. Rabin, Enabling Torts, 49 DrEPaut L. Rev. 435 (1999).

149
TORT LAW

Sometimes a second actor’s conduct that is intentionally tor-
tious, and perhaps even criminal, is sufficiently foreseeable to
render the first actor’s negligence a proximate cause of the harm
caused by the second actor. But since negligence is more common
than intentionally tortious or criminal actions, there are cases in
which subsequent negligence by a second actor is foreseeable,
whereas more blameworthy conduct is not. Then the first actor’s
negligence is held not to be a proximate cause of harm caused
immediately by the intentional misconduct of a second actor, or it is
a jury question whether there is sufficient proximity. In such
situations the courts sometimes say that subsequent intentional
misconduct breaks the “‘chain”’ of causation leading from the first
actor, because that misconduct was intentional rather than merely
negligent. Of course, there are cases in which the first actor is
negligent precisely because his action risks intentional or negligent
misconduct by a second party. A service station that leaves keys in
the ignition of a car it is servicing is negligent because of the risk of
theft—intentional wrongdoing by a second party. Under these
circumstances the chain of causation is not broken. It is worth
noting, however, that the “‘chain’’ metaphor is just that—an image
that merely states a conclusion, and not a way of reasoning to a
conclusion. It probably would be better if the courts did not use this
metaphor at all, and instead identified and articulated their reason-
ing.

Sometimes the subsequent act of a second actor which causes
injury to the plaintiff is not even negligent. For example, suppose
the thief who stole a car with the keys left in the ignition by a
servce station is driving carefully when he collides with the plain-
tiff. Then the case is a lot like Berry v. Borough of Sugar Notch.’ It
is true that the negligence of the service station did slightly
increase the risk to the plaintiff, since absent the theft there would
have been one less car on the road at that moment. This is probably
not a sufficient increase of risk to permit the proximate cause issue
to go to there jury, however, unless there is evidence that in
general thieves drive less carefully than those who are authorized
to be driving. On the other hand, sometimes injury at the hands of
a subsequent, non-negligent third party is sufficiently foreseeable
to make that risk one of the things that makes it negligent for the
defendant to act as he did. For instance, if I negligently injure you
and your injuries are aggravated by subsequent, non-negligent
medical care, there is no question that my negligence is a proximate
cause of the aggravation. Such aggravation is sufficiently common
to make it foreseeable.

150
THE SCOPE OF LIABILITY: PROXIMATE CAUSE

All this is doctrinally straightforward, if a bit complicated. But
an important non-doctrinal, practical consideration also helps to
explain the increasing tendency of the courts to hold that a jury can
find the first actor to have been a proximate cause for enabling the
second actor to harm the plaintiff. In all of the cases involving the
subsequent act of a negligent second actor, that actor is of course
liable to the plaintiff. The issue in the cases is whether first actor,
whose negligence placed the plaintiff in a position to be injured by
the second actor, also may be held liable. Holding that the first
actor’s negligence also is a proximate cause of the plaintiff's harm
(or that the jury is free to find that it is) thus renders an additional
party, the first actor, liable or potentially liable.

The economic significance of this kind of development should
be obvious: it adds a another pocket from which recovery may be
obtained. And it is no surprise that in many of the cases, the first
actor is more likely to be solvent, or insured, or both, and therefore
more able actually to pay compensation to the plaintiff, than the
second actor whose negligence was the immediate cause of the
plaintiff's injury. This does not mean that the courts decide these
cases in an ad hoc manner depending on how solvent the first actor
happens to be. But the evolution of the case law to permit the
imposition of liability on the first actor probably has been influ-
enced in a general way by the fact that in many of the cases the
party who would otherwise be the sole defendant is unlikely to be
able to pay a judgment entered against him.

C. What Must be Foreseeable: When May Liability Be
Imposed for the Unforeseeable?

Many of the more difficult and celebrated cases raising scope of
liability, or proximate cause, issues, can be analyzed by recognizing
that there are four general categories of cases in which something
unforeseeable has occurred, and the question is whether there is (or
the jury could impose) liability despite this unforeseeability. These
involve: (1) unforeseeable plaintiffs, (2) unforeseeable extent of
harm, (3) unforeseeable types of harm, and (4) unforeseeable man-
ner of harm.° It turns out that plaintiff unforeseeability matters a
lot. Unforeseeability of the extent of harm that occurs, or the
manner in which harm occurs, does not. And cases involving an
unforeseeable type of harm tend to be decided in ways that make
generalization about their results more difficult.

9. See Guido Calabresi, Concerning Cause and the Law of Torts: An Essay for
Harry Kalven, Jr., 43 U. Cut. L. Rev. 69 (1975).

151
TORT LAW

Do not assume, however, that the categories are always self-
defining, or that the courts always use these express categories in
their opinions. In many, if not most, instances, it will be fairly easy
to tell in which category a case properly belongs. When a court says
that harm of any sort to this plaintiff was unforeseeable, then the
case involves an unforeseeable plaintiff. And when a minor burn
might have been expected, but the burn that occurs is much more
severe, then the case involves an unforeseeable extent of harm. But
sometimes distinguishing between an unforeseeable extent of harm
and an unforeseeable type of harm, or between an unforeseeable
type of harm and an unforeseeable manner of harm, is more
difficult. The classification decision may then determine the out-
come of the case. In effect, the court is deciding what counts as a
harm within the risk that makes the defendant negligent, and what
does not count as such a risk. Conversely, the courts do not always
rely on categorization, but sometimes simply address the signifi-
cance of the fact that something that happened in the case was
unforeseeable. In such instances a categorization of the case is an
after the fact attempt by commentators or subsequent courts to
account for the outcome—an attempt to explain ‘‘what was really
going on.”

It is also worth noting at the outset that three of the most
prominent cases in this genre, Palsgraf, Polemis, and Wagon
Mound, corresponding to the first three categories listed above
(unforeseeable plaintiff, extent of harm, or type of harm), each
involve an assumption of unforeseeability that is an artifact of the
way they were litigated. In all three cases the foreseeability of the
harm that occurred seems plausible. But the plaintiffs chose not to
prove or argue that the harm was foreseeable, either through
apparent oversight (as seems to have been the case in Palsgraf and
Polemis) or for strategic reasons (Wagon Mound). The cases there-
fore come down to us as involving complete unforeseeability, and
the rules they stand for apply only to cases involving complete
unforeseeability, rather than to situations in which it might be a
jury question how foreseeable what occurred actually was to the
defendant. In short, these classic cases are important, but it is

crucial to keep in mind both what they do and what they do not
stand for.

1. Unforeseeable Plaintiffs

The most famous of all torts cases, Palsgraf v. Long Island
Railway,” involved an unforeseeable plaintiff. A railroad employee
helped a passenger onto a train that was pulling out of a station,

10. 248 N.Y. 339, 162 N.E. 99 (1928).

152
THE SCOPE OF LIABILITY: PROXIMATE CAUSE

dislodging a package the passenger was carrying. The package
contained fireworks, which fell on the tracks and exploded, causing
scales that were piled further down the platform where other
passengers stood, to topple onto Mrs. Palsgraf. She sued the rail-
road for negligence. But the negligence of the railroad’s employee—
if there was any at all—consisted of his failure to exercise reason-
able care toward the passenger and his package. Injury to anyone
standing down the platform from this action was so unlikely that it
was, for practical purposes, unforeseeable. It has often been ob-
served that the scales might not have been dislodged by the
concussion from the explosion, as the plaintiff contended, but by
people on the platform running away from the explosion. The risk
of injury caused by someone on the platform bumping into the
scales (and causing them to fall on someone like Mrs. Palsgraf)
probably was reasonably foreseeable, or at least might have posed a
jury question even for Judge Cardozo. But the plaintiff apparently
failed to make this much more straightforward contention, which
might have taken unforeseeability out of the case.

The issue, therefore, was whether the case could even go to the
jury under the circumstances that were proved. Injury to someone
in Mrs. Palsgraf’s position was not even remotely one of the risks
that should be taken into account by the railroad in deciding how to
conduct itself toward the passenger getting on the train, because
injury to such a person was unforeseeable—that is, highly improba-
ble. Writing for the majority, Cardozo held that the case could not
go to the jury. There is language in the opinion that can be read as
suggesting that the railroad had no duty to Mrs. Palsgraf, but that
may well be a misreading of what Cardozo was saying. Cardozo
probably believed that the railroad had such a duty—a duty to
exercise reasonable care to avoid subjecting people to foreseeable
risks of harm. Because Mrs. Palsgraf was on the railroad’s platform
there is no question that she was owed this duty of reasonable care.
Cardozo might therefore be understood to have held that the
railroad had not breached its duty to Mrs. Palsgraf, because harm
to her was not a foreseeable risk of what the defendant had done.
Thus, the railroad was not negligent in relation to her. In dissent,
Judge Andrews rejected Cardozo’s breach of duty analysis. Employ-
ing the language of proximate cause, Andrews argued that factors
in addition to foreseeability were relevant, including how remote or
close in time and space Mrs. Palsgraf was to the defendant’s
negligence. For Andrews, foreseeability was a more malleable con-
cept than Cardozo believed, and that in any event the question was
not whether the railroad was negligent in relation to Mrs. Palsgraf.
Once the railroad was negligent in some way, in Andrews’ view the

153
TORT LAW

question was whether the defendant’s negligence was a proximate
cause of the plaintiff's injury, and under these facts that question
was properly for the jury.

The opinions thus disagreed on two grounds: whether the issue
was breach of duty or proximate cause, and whether the issue
(whichever it was) should go to the jury. As to the first ground of
disagreement, Cardozo said that before the question of proximate
cause could even be reached, the defendant must have breached a
duty to exercise reasonable care toward the plaintiff, and in this
instance that the breach of duty issue was a question of law for the
court. In contrast, Andrews said that the issue did in fact concern
proximate cause. With respect to this first disagreement there
probably was less difference between the two judges than they
thought. Whether the explanation given is that there was no breach
of duty to Mrs. Palsgraf, or that the defendant’s negligence was not
a proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury, the basis for the result
the majority reached would be the same: Mrs. Palsgraf was an
unforeseeable plaintiff as a matter of law.

The second ground of disagreement between Cardozo and
Andrews—whether the breach of duty or proximate cause issue
should have gone to the jury under the circumstances of the case—
was more significant in the context of the case itself. If Cardozo had
concluded that injury to Mrs. Palsgraf was even a remotely foresee-
able result of what the defendant did, then he might have conclud-
ed that the question whether the defendant had breached a duty to
her was for the jury to decide. But Cardozo did not think that
reasonable people could disagree about that issue, because he did
not think that injury to Mrs. Palsgraf was even remotely foresee-
able. On the other hand, because Andrews did think that such
injury was remotely foreseeable, and because he thought other
factors were relevant (e.g., her closeness to defendant’s negligence
in time and space) he considered the proximate cause question to be
appropriate for the jury.

Now it is true that there is a good deal of language in Andrews’
dissent suggesting that what I have identified as the first ground of
his disagreement with Cardozo (breach of duty versus proximate
cause as the proper way to frame the issue) was important to him.
Andrews contended that negligence is not a relative concept in the
way that Cardozo analyzed it. In Andrews’ view, once a defendant
is negligent in some way toward someone, then whether that
negligence is a proximate cause of the harm that actually results is
“all a question of expediency.”’ But then Andrews recited a series of
factors to take into account in making the proximate cause deci-
sion, some of which in one way or another relate to foreseeability—

154
THE SCOPE OF LIABILITY: PROXIMATE CAUSE

the very factor that Cardozo considered dispositive. So the differ-
ence between the Cardozo and Andrews approaches in any case in
which injury to the plaintiff is not utterly unforeseeable probably is
not as great as it may seem.

On the other hand, if we were to read, or misread, Cardozo’s
opinion as being about the existence of a duty, rather than about
breach of duty, then there is a greater difference between Cardozo
and Andrews. Typically we tend to think of duty questions as
involving legal questions to be decided by the court, and ‘“‘causal”’
issues as involving factual questions to be decided by the jury. But
if we read Cardozo’s opinion as being about breach of duty, then
the Cardozo approach will not in principle lead to fewer cases going
to the jury. This first difference between the two approaches is
likely to be much less important than the second difference—
whether or not the court thinks that reasonable people could
disagree about the foreseeability of what actually happened. To put
the same point another way, Cardozo could have employed An-
drews’ proximate cause approach to support keeping the case from
the jury, just as Andrews could have employed Cardozo’s breach of
duty analysis to support sending the case to the jury.

Coming now to the core of the difference between the two, the
question is whether it should matter that injury to a plaintiff is or
is not wholly unforeseeable, if the defendant was in fact negligent
toward a different plaintiff. Why not hold, or permit the jury to
hold, the defendant liable for the injuries it caused to the unfore-
seeable plaintiff? After all, the defendant was already taking an
unreasonable risk of harm to some foreseeable plaintiff or plain-
tiffs, or it could not be said that the defendant was negligent at all.
Imposing liability for harm suffered by unforeseeable plaintiffs may
deter such risk taking toward foreseeable plaintiffs, and that would
be a good thing. In response, it could be argued that imposing
liability for harm suffered by the unforeseeable plaintiff is too much
like imposing liability without fault. The railroad was not at fault
in relation to Mrs. Palsgraf, so imposing liability on it is a bit like
imposing strict liability for being negligent to someone else. Poten-
tial defendants threatened with this kind of liability will not take
the risk of harming unforeseeable plaintiffs into account in any
precise way when they decide how much care to take, because they
do not know how their conduct risks harm to unforeseeable plain-
tiffs, and are not at fault for failing to consider the risk their
conduct poses to unforeseeable plaintiffs.

On this latter view, only if there are reasons for holding the
defendant liable that resemble reasons for imposing strict liability
would it make sense to hold the defendant liable under the rubric

155
TORT LAW

of “negligence” for harm to unforeseeable plaintiffs. And maybe
there are in this situation. Why not think of the railroad as being in
a better position than Mrs. Palsgraf to build into its decisions the
risk of being held liable to plaintiffs that it cannot foresee, and
therefore hold the railroad ‘“‘strictly’’ liable to such plaintiffs? One
answer is that this may be a step onto a slippery slope that leads to
much more strict liability generally. How do we distinguish rail-
roads in this situation from all sorts of other defendants who have
injured unforeseeable plaintiffs? This depends on the reasons strict
liability is imposed—a subject that we will address in Chapter
Eight. For now it is enough to see that imposing liability to
unforeseeable plaintiffs may implicate something resembling strict
liability.

The courts have never fully reconciled the Cardozo and An-
drews points of view. Most courts employ Cardozo’s conceptual
approach, but they are much more inclined than Cardozo seems to
have been to let the foreseeability issue, including the time and
space considerations that figure in it, go to the jury. In whatever
way the issue of the utterly unforeseeable plaintiff is resolved,
however, once some harm fo this plaintiff is even remotely foresee-
able, the analysis changes, as in the following category of cases.

2. Unforeseeable Extent of Harm

In contrast to the cases involving utterly unforeseeable plain-
tiffs are those in which the virtually universal “thin-skull’’ rule
applies. The thin-skull rule governs the rights of foreseeable plain-
tiffs who suffer an unforeseeable extent of harm. Under this rule it
is no defense that the plaintiff had an unforeseeable weakness or
infirmity that caused his or her injury, or that caused injury of
much greater severity than would have been suffered in the ab-
sence of this weakness. As the courts say repeatedly, the defendant
“takes his victim as he finds him.” Thus, whereas under Palsgraf
the defendant is not liable to a plaintiff who was unforeseeable,
under the thin-skull rule unforeseeability is irrelevant. How can
this difference between the treatment of unforeseeable plaintiffs
and an unforeseeable extent of harm be explained?

Two different kinds of explanations can be given. The first
explanation for the thin-skull rule is that rejection of the rule
would create so many practical problems that the rule is a necessi-
ty. For example, suppose that even a foreseeable plaintiff could not
recover compensation for injuries of unforeseeable severity. The
plaintiff in every case would then be required to prove that the
extent of his injuries was foreseeable. To prove that the severity of
his injuries was foreseeable, the plaintiff would have to prove what

156
THE SCOPE OF LIABILITY: PROXIMATE CAUSE

a ‘normal’? amount of injury under the circumstances would have
been. But of course in any population of individuals a substantial
percentage of them are not in perfect health; indeed, virtually
everyone probably has some weakness or other that might qualify
as analogous to a thin skull. People are born with some of these
weaknesses, they acquire others, and sometimes they are tempo-
rarily injured and have their injuries aggravated by tortious con-
duct. If the thin-skull rule were not in force, in every case the jury
would have to address which of these weaknesses, infirmities, and
injuries, physical and mental, are ‘‘normal,” or at least foreseeable.
Expert testimony might be required on the question, and certainly
would be admissible even if not required. This could turn every case
into a complicated, drawn-out affair, and might produce fewer
settlements and more trials. The thin-skull rule avoids these com-
plications entirely.

A second explanation for the thin-skull rule might be that the
rule imposes a desirable kind of strict liability. Because individuals
vary enormously in the degree to which they are weak or strong,
the defendant. who can foresee the risk of injury to a particular
plaintiff or class of plaintiffs must know that there is a distribution
of the probable severity of the injury risked by any given action,
from slight injury to severe injury. Even a light touch risks the low
probability of causing severe injury. Consequently, any potential
defendant can always foresee a thin-skulled plaintiff, at least in the
statistical sense. For this reason, the threat of liability for an
unforeseeable extent of harm can in fact promote optimal deter-
rence, because potential defendants can make at least rough calcu-
lations about the risk that they will injure a thin-skulled plaintiff.
Thus, foreseeable plaintiffs with unforeseeable vulnerability are
already ‘‘in the sights” of potential defendants, whereas all the
other people in the world are unforeseeable plaintiffs and are not
meaningfully “in the sights” of potential defendants.

The exceptions to the thin-skull rule tend to confirm this
explanation for it. There are whole classes of cases—decided under
other doctrines altogether—in which the thin-skull rule conceivably
could be applied but is not, precisely because it makes more sense
for the plaintiff to bear the risk in question than for the defendant
to be held ‘“‘strictly’’ liable for it. For example, the defendant does
not take a negligent plaintiff as he finds him; rather, the plaintiff is
either barred from recovering at all by contributory negligence, or
under comparative negligence the award is reduced in proportion to
the amount of negligence attributable to the plaintiff (for discussion
of these doctrines, see Chapter Seven). Similarly, even a non-
negligent plaintiff is obliged to take reasonable steps after injury to

157
TORT LAW

mitigate the extent of the losses he suffers. In these cases the
defendant does not have to take his victim as he finds him; rather,
some weakness of the plaintiff is taken into account in deciding
whether and for how much the defendant is liable to the plaintiff.

Of course, one might say that it is not unforeseeable that a
plaintiff will be contributorily negligent or fail to mitigate his
damages after injury. But that would be all the more reason to
apply the rule that the defendant takes his victim as he finds him
in these situations. Yet the rule is not applied to these cases. The
explanation is that it makes more sense for the negligent plaintiff
to bear these costs than for the defendant to do so. As to these
cases, the defendant’s negligence is not a proximate cause of the
losses resulting from the plaintiff's negligence or failure to miti-
gate. In each case, for substantive reasons that typically are not
even discussed under the rubric of proximate cause, tort liability
does not follow the thin-skull rule. In short, when it makes sub-
stantive sense to hold the defendant liable for an unforeseeable
extent of harm, the thin-skull rule applies. But in seemingly analo-
gous cases in which the policies underlying the thin-skull rule
would not be well-served by applying it, other tort-law doctrines do
not require that the defendant take his victim as he finds him.

3. Unforeseeable Type of Harm

Between the extremes of the utterly unforeseeable plaintiff and
the foreseeable plaintiff with an unforeseeably thin skull lie cases
involving what might be called an unforeseeable ‘‘type’’ of harm to
a foreseeable plaintiff. Cardozo himself envisioned such cases to-
ward the end of his opinion in Palsgraf:

There is room for argument that a distinction is to be drawn
according to the diversity of interests invaded by the act, as
where conduct negligent in that it threatens an insignificant
invasion of an interest in property results in an unforeseeable
invasion of an interest of another order, as e.g., one of bodily
security.”

A number of classic cases and hypotheticals fall into this category.
Suppose that the defendant negligently leaves a container of nitro-
glycerine on a shelf, and the container is accidentally knocked off
the shelf. The nitroglycerine does not explode, though it lands on
and injures the plaintiffs foot. May the jury find the defendant
liable, or is there no proximate cause as a matter of law? Commen-
tators differ, and probably courts would as well.

11. 162 N.E. 99, 101 (N.Y. 1928).

158
THE SCOPE OF LIABILITY: PROXIMATE CAUSE

At least one reason for the uncertainty of outcome in cases
such as this is that the policies that underlie the distinction
between the Palsgraf and thin-skull rules do not strongly dictate a
general result either way in this kind of case. Some cases involving
an unforeseeable type of harm to a foreseeable plaintiff resemble
Palsgraf, in that the defendant is unlikely to be able to predict the
scope of liability it may face for unforeseeable types of harm. But
other cases resemble thin-skull claims in that a somewhat calcula-
ble range of harms might result from the defendant’s negligence,
even if some types of harm, realistically, are not even remotely part
of what enters the determination of whether the defendant was
negligent in the first instance. Moreover, if there were always a
difference in the treatment of type of harm and extent of harm
cases, or in the treatment of utterly unforeseeable and only remote-
ly foreseeable type of harm, enormous pressure would be placed on
the classification decision; yet the distinction between the type and
the extent of harm, or between an utterly unforeseeable and a
remotely foreseeable type of harm, is not always obvious, to say the
least.

Thus, in In re Polemis & Furness Withy & Co. (an early
twentieth-century British Commonwealth case),” a plank fell into
the hold of a ship in which petrol was stored and caused an
explosion that destroyed the ship. There were findings of fact that
the defendant’s employees were negligent in causing the plank to
fall; that the explosion was caused by a spark resulting from the
falling of the plank; but that the spark could not reasonably have
been anticipated from the falling of the plank, though some damage
to the ship might reasonably have been anticipated. From the
modern standpoint it seems at least arguably foreseeable that a
plank might strike something in the hold that was metal, and that
this could cause metal to metal contact, a spark, and a fire. But the
plaintiff either chose not to so contend or failed to persuade the
finder of fact. The question was therefore whether the defendant’s
negligence was a proximate cause of the unforeseeable harm. The
defendant proposed a distinction between an unanticipated extent
of harm and an unanticipated type of harm, which the court
rejected. The court held instead that the defendant’s negligence
was a proximate cause of even unforeseeable harm, so long as the
harm was a “‘direct’’ consequence of the defendant’s negligence. As
we saw earlier, this directness test has largely faded away.

Years later, Polemis was overruled in the British Common-
wealth by The Wagon Mound.” In that case the defendant negli-

159
TORT LAW

gently flushed oil from its ship while in Sydney harbor. The oil
eventually caught fire and destroyed the plaintiff's dock. It was
foreseeable that the oil would foul the dock, but the plaintiff chose
not to prove that it was foreseeable that the oil would ignite and
burn the dock. Probably this was a conscious strategy—if the oil’s
catching fire was foreseeable to the defendant, it was arguably
foreseeable to the plaintiff, which would have made the plaintiff
contributorily negligent. So the unforeseeability of fire had to be
assumed. The court held that the defendant could not be held liable
for the fire damage to the dock, precisely because that damage was
not foreseeable. The court’s rationale seemed not only to overrule
Polemis, but the thin-skull rule as well, since the basis for the
decision was that there is no point in holding a defendant liable for
anything unforeseeable, even to a foreseeable plaintiff. Yet that has
not been how the case has been read by subsequent courts. Rather,
the courts have concluded that the thin-skull rule survives after
The Wagon Mound. Therefore, the case seems to stand for the
proposition that there can be no liability when a foreseeable plain-
tiff suffers an unforeseeable type of harm, even if that harm is a
direct consequence of such negligence, but that there is still liability
to a foreseeable plaintiff for an unforeseeable extent of harm.

Even under this limiting interpretation, The Wagon Mound
states a rule that is broader than most courts in the United States
accept. Faced with cases involving an unforeseeable type of harm to
a foreseeable plaintiff, most American courts make the proximate
cause determination—or decide whether to permit the jury to make
it—on a case-by-case basis. They are likely to take into account a
variety of factors, including the directness of the harm, the degree
to which it more closely resembles an unforeseeable type of harm
than an unforeseeable extent of the same type of harm that was
foreseeable, and whether the defendant’s negligence caused other
damage for which it is already being held liable and therefore not
being totally exonerated from liability.“ In short, as to unforesee-
able types of harm to foreseeable plaintiffs, no general rule can be
confidently stated other than that many such cases will be permit-
ted to go to the jury on the proximate cause issue.

4. Unforeseeable Manner of Harm

The last category of cases involving something unforeseeable
arises when injury to the plaintiff is unquestionably foreseeable,
and the type of injury that occurs is foreseeable, but that injury
occurs in a peculiar or bizarre manner. For example, in Marshall

14. For the classic statement of this point of view, see Judge Friendly’s opinion
in Petition of Kinsman Transit Company, 338 F.2d 708 (2d Cir.1964).

160
THE SCOPE OF LIABILITY: PROXIMATE CAUSE

v. Nugent,” the defendant’s driving forced a car in which the
plaintiff was a passenger to run off the road. The plaintiff was at
that point unharmed, but suffered injury after he had walked
down the road and was struck by a third vehicle as he was
attempting to warn oncoming traffic of the danger ahead. Despite
the unusual way in which the plaintiff actually was injured, this
did not preclude liability on the part of the defendant. As long as
the plaintiff was injured at roughly the same time and in roughly
the same place as was foreseeable, through the same general forces
as were foreseeable, it is not necessary that the precise manner in
which the injury took place have been foreseeable. If that were a
requirement the defendant’s negligence would rarely be a proxi-
mate cause of the plaintiff's harm, since there are an almost
infinite number of detailed variations on the manner in which a
foreseeable injury may occur. Consequently, the general rule is
that, unless in retrospect the manner in which a foreseeable plain-
tiff suffered a foreseeable type of harm appears to be so extraordi-
nary as to be completely unforeseeable, the fact that the harm
occurred in an unforeseeable manner does not bar recovery.

Ill. Judge, Jury, and the Underlying Purpose of
Proximate Cause

To round out our portrait of the scope of liability and proxi-
mate cause issue, two points must be added. The first point
concerns the significance of the relation between judge and jury in
making determinations about the issue. The second, related point
requires us to step back from the details of the cases and doctrine
in order to reflect about their underlying purpose.

A. Judge and Jury

Some of the complexity that appears to plague the law govern-
ing proximate cause can be reduced by attending to an important
feature of the cases that often goes unrecognized. Many of the cases
deal with a problem at the extreme end of the continuum: whether
the defendant’s negligence was not a proximate cause of the plain-
tiffs harm, as a matter of law. Thus, the question in these cases is
whether the proximate cause issue can even go to the jury. Such
famous cases as Palsgraf and The Wagon Mound fall into this
category (though in the Commonwealth there are no juries, so in
Wagon Mound the issue was simply whether there was a firm rule

15. 222 F.2d 604 (1st Cir.1955).

161
TORT LAW

of law that there is no liability for unforeseeable harm or no firm
rule).

It is important to recognize, however, that the second category
of proximate cause cases does not involve a situation at the opposite
end of the continuum. Rather, these cases hold that the proximate
cause issue was properly submitted to the jury, or was improperly
kept from the jury. Few cases, that is, concern the situations in
which the defendant’s negligence was a proximate cause of the
plaintiff's injury, as a matter of law. Aside from the thin-skull rule
(which does fall into this category), there are few cases that address
this problem, because it is unremarkable. If I run a red light and
collide with another vehicle at the intersection controlled by the
light, then of course my negligence is a proximate cause of the
harm that results, as a matter of law. The very reason I am
negligent in running the red light is that doing so risks causing
precisely this kind of injury. If I am negligent in this situation, it is
not a jury question whether that negligence was a proximate cause
of what happened. In finding me negligent the jury necessarily has
made that determination already.

The occasional opinions that do involve the second category of
cases—which rule that the proximate cause issue is properly one for
the jury—sometimes give the inaccurate impression that they are
holding that the defendant’s negligence was a proximate cause of
the plaintiff's harm as a matter of law. In their understandable
effort to justify rejection of the defendant’s contention that, as a
matter of law, its negligence was not a proximate cause of the
plaintiff's harm, the courts in these cases sometimes seem to be
suggesting the opposite. But of course the courts are not suggesting
that the defendant’s negligence was a proximate cause of the
plaintiff's harm, as a matter of law. These decisions merely hold
that, because reasonable people could disagree about whether the
defendant’s negligence was a proximate cause of the plaintiff's
harm, the question was properly one to be left to the jury.

Thus, cases such as Wagner v. International Railway" and
Marshall v. Nugent" are not the polar opposites of Palsgraf and
The Wagon Mound. On the contrary, these cases occupy a middle
point between the extreme cases in which as a matter of law there
is no proximate cause and those in which as a matter of law the
defendant’s negligence is a proximate cause. It turns out that (to
paraphrase Cardozo’s famous line from Wagner) danger does not
necessarily invite rescue. Rather, under Wagner, reasonable people

16. See note 4, supra.
17. See note 15, supra.

162
THE SCOPE OF LIABILITY: PROXIMATE CAUSE

could disagree about whether danger invited rescue under those
circumstances, and that the question should therefore be submitted
to the jury. Similarly, under Marshall v. Nugent, it is not true that
as a matter of law the injury the plaintiff received by being struck
by the defendant’s car “‘was not remote, either in time or place,
from the negligent conduct of defendant * * *”’. Rather (as the
court took pains elsewhere in the opinion to note explicitly), it was
for the jury to decide whether the injury to the plaintiff was or was
not “‘remote.”’

The lesson to be learned from this distinction is that occasion-
ally there are decisions holding as a matter of law on no-proximate-
cause or no breach of duty grounds that the plaintiff’s case may not
go to the jury (such as Palsgraf) or is governed by a rule applied as
a matter of law (such as The Wagon Mound). But more often the
complex proximate-cause reasoning that one encounters in the
opinions is verbal overkill, directed at explaining why the issue is
simply one for the jury.

B. The Underlying Purpose of Proximate Cause

Proximate cause is a liability-limiting doctrine. The proximate
cause requirement takes the universe of claims that are eligible for
liability and designates those in which liability should not be
imposed. Further, by distinguishing between cases that should and
should not go to the jury, the doctrine expresses what lies behind
its liability-limiting purpose in two different ways. First, decisions
withholding a case from jury decision on proximate-cause grounds
tend to do so in rule-based formulations that can never capture
everything that enters into the decision that there is no proximate
cause, as a matter of law. Indeed, in reading Judge Andrews’
dissent in Palsgraf, I always get the sense that Andrews objects
mainly to Cardozo’s unwillingness to acknowledge the relevance of
the many factors Andrews believes should be taken into account in
making the proximate cause decision. His objection to the majori-
ty’s decision to keep the case from the jury seems almost secondary.
The majority opinion in Palsgraf gives helpful, but inevitably
incomplete guidance to the courts as to the situations in which a
case should not go to the jury.

Second, and in contrast, when a proximate cause issue does go
to the jury, the very factors that are so difficult to articulate in a
formal judicial opinion are likely nonetheless to be considered by
the jury. And it is in the jury room, I think, that the most
significant and most frequently overlooked application of proximate
cause doctrine actually takes place. In the jury room, the common-

163
TORT LAW

sense principle underlying proximate cause—that negligent defen-
dants should not always bear liability to all the people or for all the
harm they have caused, because at some point liability must stop—
can be put into practice. Judgments about such matters as the
degree of remoteness of the defendant’s action from the plaintiff's
harm, and whether the amount of liability that may be imposed on
the defendant fits the tort it committed (something like what would
be called ‘‘proportionality” in the field of criminal punishment),
each of which fine-tune the negligence decision itself, can be made
by the jury without the need to quantify or explain the weight
given to each factor. The doctrine of proximate cause thus creates
the need for a jury instruction that acquaints the jury with its
responsibility not merely to make a mechanical decision applying
the rules of tort law, but also to use its judgment in deciding
whether the defendant was sufficiently blameworthy under all the
circumstances to deserve to bear liability. Far from being the
theoretical and conceptual construct that the appellate decisions
sometimes make it seem to be, in this sense proximate cause is the
most practical and realistic of doctrines, for it asks the jury to step
back after it has applied the individual pieces of the liability puzzle
and look at the whole picture before it makes its final decision.

DEFENSES BASED ON  PLAINTIFF’S
CONDUCT

The defenses based on plaintiff's conduct—contributory and
comparative negligence, as well as assumption of risk—form an
important part of many tort suits. Each is an ‘‘affirmative’’ de-
fense. That is, the defendant bears the burden of pleading and
proving the facts necessary to support one of these defenses. The
defendant must prove that the plaintiff's conduct was negligent or
consisted of assumption of risk, that such conduct was a cause in
fact of the plaintiff's injury, and that such conduct was a proximate
cause of this injury. In the typical case involving a defense based on
plaintiff's conduct, then, each party tries to prove what amounts to
a full tort claim against the other. The difference is that the
plaintiff attempts to prove that the defendant breached a duty and
caused harm to him, whereas the defendant attempts to prove that
the plaintiff breached a duty to and caused harm to himself.

I. Contributory Negligence

Contributory negligence is the failure of the plaintiff to exer-
cise reasonable care to protect himself or his property from the risk
of harm or loss. Now that comparative negligence applies in at least
some negligence cases in all but a few states, the full defense of
contributory negligence is a thing of the past. But the concept of
contributory negligence still is the reference point for the modern
reforms. Most of the discussion here involves the meaning and
application of the concepts of contributory and comparative negli-
gence. But it is important to remember that, just as the plaintiff's
prima facie case against the defendant has the separate elements of
duty, breach, causation, and damages, so the defendant’s affirma-
tive defense has analogous elements. Thus, the defendant must
prove not only that the plaintiff breached a duty to exercise
reasonable care to protect himself from harm, but also that this
breach was both a cause in fact and proximate cause of his
suffering harm.

Almost as soon as negligence emerged in the early nineteenth
century as a distinct tort, the defense of contributory negligence

165
TORT LAW

began to develop along with it. In Butterfield v. Forrester,’ for
example, the court seemed to think it self-evident that a negligent
plaintiff had no right to recover from a negligent defendant. From
the inception of the doctrine until the 1970’s, in most states of the
United States the contributory negligence of the plaintiff was a
complete bar to recovery. Even a slightly negligent plaintiff could
recover nothing from a negligent defendant, if the plaintiff’s negli-
gence was both a cause in fact and a proximate cause of his own
injuries. At that point statutes in many jurisdictions and a few
judicial decisions quickly replaced this complete bar with compara-
tive negligence, under which the negligence of the plaintiff does not
bar recovery but reduces it.

Sometimes the conduct that constitutes contributory negli-
gence also is primary negligence, so to speak. For example, almost
every act of negligent driving risks harm to the driver and to
others; whether the negligent driver or another party (or both) is
injured is often just a matter of luck. Logically one would think
that whether the plaintiff was negligent ought to depend not only
on the risk he took for his own safety, but also on the risk his
conduct posed to others. Undoubtedly some juries take both sets of
risks into account, but there is little law on the issue. On the other
hand, some acts of contributory negligence are only that—they
create an unreasonable risk of harm to oneself but not to anyone
else—using a defective chain saw unsafely when no one else is
foreseeably in the vicinity, for instance.

At the core of the defense of contributory negligence is the
notion that it would be unfair to impose liability on the defendant
when the plaintiff has negligently contributed to his own injury.
The trouble with this notion is that its opposite is also true. It is
unfair to completely relieve the defendant of liability merely be-
cause the plaintiff's negligence was also a cause of his own injury.
Nor can causal reasoning explain the defense. There is nothing in
the facts of the countless cases in which the defense of contributory
negligence has been applied to suggest that the plaintiff is the sole
cause in fact or sole proximate cause of his own harm. Rather, in
these cases the defendant’s negligence and the plaintiff’s negligence
are both causes in fact and both proximate causes of the plaintiff's
harm. Finally, deterrence cannot explain the defense either. To
whatever small extent the contributory negligence defense deters
potential plaintiffs from being negligent, it fails to deter potential
defendants at least as much. Potential plaintiffs always have an
incentive to be careful in order to avoid injury, whereas some

166
DEFENSES BASED ON PLAINTIFF’S CONDUCT

potential defendants are “‘absentees’’ whose negligence only risks
harming others. Under contributory negligence potential defen-
dants can anticipate being relieved of liability in some cases even
when they are negligent, and this undermines deterrence.

Despite considerable historical scholarship on contributory neg-
ligence, it is still not entirely clear why the defense developed in the
way it did, as a complete bar to recovery. Part of the explanation
may be that when negligence was first recognized as a separate
tort, recovery on that basis was regarded as sufficiently unusual
that it was thought appropriate to make compensation available
only to plaintiffs with completely ‘“‘clean hands.” In addition, there
has long been speculation by some commentators—though the
matter is disputed—that the defense of contributory negligence was
employed by the courts as a device to reign in the power of juries,
which nineteenth century judges sometimes distrusted. The defense
would only have been a fully effective device for achieving this aim,
however, when it was possible to hold as a matter of law that the
plaintiff had been contributorily negligent and therefore to grant a
directed verdict for the defendant notwithstanding the defendant’s
own negligence. And that would not have been common. Finally,
though today we find comparative negligence to be more compatible
with our-sense of fairness, the nineteenth century courts may
simply have been unable to see this approach as a coherent stop-
ping point between the extremes of no-liability and full-liability
when the plaintiff's negligence had contributed to his own injury.

Nevertheless, as time went on the courts recognized and be-
came increasingly concerned about the harsh effect that sometimes
resulted from the complete bar to recovery effectuated by the
contributory negligence defense. Prior to the adoption of compara-
tive negligence, a number of doctrinal exceptions and practices
emerged at least in part in order to ameliorate this harsh effect.
These are discussed in the following Sections.

A. The Safety Statute Exception

Many courts held (and still hold) that when the defendant’s
negligence consisted of the breach of a statute designed specifically
to protect a class of persons unable to protect themselves against
the defendant’s negligence, the contributory negligence of a mem-
ber of the protected class is not a bar to recovery. For example, if
the driver of a school bus negligently fails to take measures
required by statute when students exit the bus, a student’s contrib-
utory negligence may not be a defense in an action for injuries
resulting from the driver’s negligence. The safety measures are

167
TORT LAW

mandated precisely because of the risk that students will not
exercise reasonable care to protect themselves. Similarly, if a stat-
ute requires ladders furnished to certain employees to have safety
shoes, the negligence of an employee in using a ladder without
safety shoes does not bar a negligence action against the party who
was under a statutory duty to furnish the proper ladder.” The logic
behind this rule is not particularly compelling, since much negli-
gent conduct that is not a statutory violation is considered negli-
gent precisely because those whose harm the conduct risks cannot
or may not adequately protect themselves against this risk in the
first place. Otherwise the risk taken by the defendant might not be
an unreasonable risk to take. The safety statute exception seems
primarily to have reflected a reaction to the harsh effect of the
contributory negligence bar to recovery in a category of cases that
seemed on their surface to be conceptually distinct from those in
which the defense is ordinarily available, but which on deeper
analysis are difficult to distinguish from ordinary cases.

B. The Greater-Degree-of—Blame Exception

Contributory negligence was not (and still often is not) a
defense to an intentional tort, because the defendant’s conduct is so
much more blameworthy than the plaintiff's. The same reasoning
applied to situations in which the plaintiff was contributorily negli-
gent but the defendant’s conduct was more blameworthy than mere
negligence, even if it was not intentional. The defendant’s conduct
may have constituted gross negligence, recklessness, or wanton and
willful misconduct. This greater-degree-of-blame exception to the
contributory negligence defense was generally applied in any of
these situations—whenever the defendant’s conduct consisted at
least of gross negligence. Just as interesting for our purposes,
however, is the fact that the exception did not apply when the
plaintiff's conduct was as blameworthy or more blameworthy than
the defendant’s conduct. For example, even if the defendant’s
conduct showed wanton and willful disregard for the safety of
others, if the plaintiff showed wanton and willful disregard for his
own safety, then the plaintiff was barred from recovery. In effect
the same degrees of blame cancelled each other out. Thus, some-
thing like a rough comparison of the faults of the parties not only
determined when there was an exception to the contributory negli-
gence defense, but also when there was no exception.

C. Last Clear Chance

A third example of the courts’ effort to ameliorate the harsh
effect of contributory negligence was the doctrine of last clear

2. See Koenig v. Patrick Constr. Corp., 298 N.Y. 313, 83 N.E.2d 133 (1948).

168
DEFENSES BASED ON PLAINTIFF’S CONDUCT

chance. I have never been certain whether last clear chance consti-
tuted deliberate judicial obfuscation in the service of a desired
result, or just plain confusion. Either way, last clear chance was a
striking by-product of the contributory negligence defense. If the
negligent defendant had the last clear chance to avoid harming the
plaintiff, then the plaintiff's contributory negligence was not a bar
to recovery. The defendant’s last clear chance trumped the defense
of contributory negligence.

Why would that be so? Being the last in time to have an
opportunity to avoid injuring someone does not render the party
who had the first chance to do so any less a proximate cause of the
injury. The first and second negligent actors may both be proximate
causes of what happens because of their negligence. Nor is there
anything particularly more blameworthy about negligently failing
to avail oneself of the last chance to avoid injuring another person
than in negligently failing to use one’s earlier chance to do so. On
the other hand, when a defendant has a chance that is both last
and clear, the failure to take that chance may well be more
blameworthy than ordinary negligence. A clear chance is one that is
open and obvious. If that clear chance to avoid injury also is the last
chance—because at that point the plaintiff cannot extricate himself
from danger—and the defendant knows this, then the inference
that the defendant knew that he or she alone could avoid the injury
is also likely to be permissible. Under these circumstances, one
might say that the defendant was an entire order of magnitude
more blameworthy than he would have been had he simply failed to
exercise reasonable care to avoid causing injury, at the same time
that the plaintiff was also failing to exercise reasonable care. That
is surely what was going on in the case in which the last clear
chance doctrine seemed to originate, Davies v. Mann.* There the
plaintiff was apparently negligent in tying the forefeet of his
donkey together so that it could not move, and then leaving the
scene. The defendant then drove his wagon right over the donkey.
In cases such as this, last clear chance might be understood as a
another version of the greater-degree-of-blame exception to the
contributory negligence defense.

I find all this plausible as an explanation of how the courts first
came to think that last clear chance was an appropriate exception
to the contributory negligence rule. But for several reasons the
comparison of faults explanation of last clear chance tends to

3. 10M. & W. 546, 152 Eng.Rep. 588 (Exchequer 1842).

169
TORT LAW

contain the seeds of its own demise. Sometimes the doctrine applies
even when the defendant who had the last clear chance may not
have been more blameworthy than a merely negligent defendant—
in fact, he may have been merely careless as well. This is because
the case law makes it clear that in order to invoke last clear chance,
the plaintiff need not prove that the defendant actually appreciated
the position of danger in which he encountered the plaintiff.
Rather, last clear chance requires only that the defendant ‘‘had
reason”’ to appreciate that danger. Having ‘‘reason to know’’ that
one is about to injure the plaintiff is not the same as knowing. The
requirements of last clear chance therefore can be met without
proof that the defendant was any more than negligent in failing to
appreciate the facts staring him in the face, and then failing to
exercise the opportunity he would have had to avoid injuring the
plaintiff. Sometimes, of course, the defendant will have been more
than merely negligent, because he will have actually known of the
plaintiff's danger. But sometimes not. So the attractiveness of the
crude comparison of faults that helps to explain the different-
degree-of-blame exception to contributory negligence can justify
only a portion of the situations in which last clear chance may
apply. Thus, over time, the courts applied the doctrine not only
when the defendant had the last clear chance, but also when the
defendant’s chance was last but not clear, nonetheless calling this
“last clear” chance.

And the converse was also true. The doctrine was often applied
when the defendant’s chance was clear but not last, but it was still
called “last clear’? chance. This occurred when the plaintiff could
have extricated himself from his position of danger up until the
moment of injury through the exercise of reasonable care, but failed
to do so. For example, the plaintiff may simply be negligently
inattentive and just as capable as the defendant until the very
moment of injury of avoiding harm to himself, simply by paying
attention and getting out of the way. Something like a crude
comparison of faults may help to explain the application of last
clear chance to this situation, but not because the defendant’s
chance was last. The plaintiff could also have avoided injury up
until the last moment. However, if in this situation the plaintiff is
in a position of obvious peril and the defendant knows this but
nonetheless injures him, the inference that the defendant did so
intentionally or recklessly is likely to be permissible. This is surely
more blameworthy than the plaintiff's merely negligent inattentive-
ness. But since both the defendant and the plaintiff could have
avoided injury to the plaintiff up until the instant before it oc-
curred, the defendant did not have the last chance to avoid the

170
DEFENSES BASED ON PLAINTIFF’S CONDUCT

injury. The timing of the defendant’s chance, which the very name
of the doctrine ‘‘last clear chance’’ proclaims to be decisive, is
logically irrelevant to the doctrine’s application in this situation.

Admittedly, if one is in fact simply comparing the faults of the
parties, it makes sense to relieve the plaintiff of the effect of his
contributory negligence when the defendant’s chance is clear but
not last. The party whose chance to avoid the injury is clear
probably is more often more at fault than the party whose chance
was last but not clear. If this is so, however, then the distinctive-
ness of last clear chance as an exception to the contributory
negligence defense in cases involving sequential negligence has
disappeared. Once sequence is logically irrelevant to the calculus,
why purport to make sequential negligence by the parties a prereq-
uisite to engaging in what amounts to the comparison of faults?
Why not simply move to comparative negligence generally? The
answer, of course, is that eventually that is exactly what happened.
Last clear chance was a transitional doctrine that has tended to
fade away with the advent of comparative negligence, because it
was merely a means of ameliorating the harsh effect of contributory
negligence in a set of situations that, as the set expanded, could no
longer be satisfactorily distinguished from the mine-run of contrib-
utory negligence cases.

D. The Jury Question/General Verdict Approach

The last reflection of the way in which contributory negligence
eventually fell into disfavor was not a doctrine, but a practice.
Whether the plaintiff was negligent was, and is, a quintessential
jury question. Further, although the rhetoric courts used in deter-
mining whether to submit the question of defendants’ and plain-
tiffs’ negligence to the jury was highly similar, in practice the
courts sometimes were more inclined to submit the latter issue to
the jury than the former. Other things being equal, a defendant’s
conduct was more likely to be held negligent as a matter of law
than a plaintiff's conduct. Since juries themselves are known to
favor plaintiffs, other things being equal, the very practice of
submitting the contributory negligence issue to the jury itself
helped to ameliorate the harsh effect of the contributory negligence
defense.

A less obvious but just as important effect of this approach was
that it permitted the jury to apply what amounted to under-the-
table comparative negligence. Although the jury in every case in
which the contributory negligence defense was in force was in-
structed that such negligence is a complete defense, experienced

171
TORT LAW

lawyers virtually all agreed that it was common for juries to
disregard this instruction. Instead juries often returned ‘‘quotient”’
verdicts in which they reduced the plaintiff's recovery through a
rough comparison of the faults of the parties. Juries could most
easily circumvent the complete-bar rule in this way when they were
asked only for a general verdict. Typically the evidence regarding
such items of loss as future medical expenses and lost wages, if any,
and past and future pain and suffering, was sufficiently open-ended
that awarding any sum within a very wide range of values was
within the jury’s discretion. Consequently, the jury could make a
smaller award than the maximum that might have been expected
without necessarily revealing that it had ‘‘split the difference.” A
smaller award than the maximum permitted by the evidence could
just as easily reflect a finding that the plaintiff was not negligent at
all, but suffered less damage than the plaintiff contended. The
result in such cases was that everyone suspected the jury of having
invoked comparative negligence, but no one could be sure when this
had actually occurred.

II. Comparative Negligence

Over the last four decades a revolution of sorts has replaced
the contributory negligence defense with a comparative negligence
regime. All but four states (Alabama, Maryland, North Carolina,
and Virginia) and the District of Columbia have now adopted
comparative negligence, 36 by statute and 10 by judicial decision.
As I have just noted, under-the-table comparative negligence proba-
bly was at work in many jury deliberations for a long time, though
unsystematically and without control or instruction by the courts.
With the formal adoption of comparative negligence, however, an
entire system of rules implementing the basic concept had to be
developed. There are now hundreds of reported decisions address-
ing a variety of issues that arise in connection with the new
defense. It is nonetheless a measure of the time it takes for a
system of common law adjudication to do the backing and filling
necessary to produce a mature body of doctrine that, even after
several decades, many issues are still unsettled in many states.‘

A. The Basics

Although the verbal formulation setting out the comparative
negligence defense varies, the core of the defense is the same.

4, An extremely useful resource on these issues is RESTATEMENT (THIRD) oF Torts:
APPORTIONMENT OF LIABILITY, which systematically addresses not only comparative
negligence, but other issues related to the apportionment of liability.

172
DEFENSES BASED ON PLAINTIFF’S CONDUCT

Under comparative negligence, the contributory negligence of the
plaintiff does not necessarily bar recovery. Instead, the plaintiff's
recovery is reduced “‘in proportion to the amount of negligence
attributable to him,” to quote the typical operative provision.
Normally this occurs by assuming that, by definition, the total
amount of negligence contributing to the plaintiff's injury or dam-
age was 100 percent. The jury must divide (or compare) the
negligence of the parties and attribute a percentage to each. The
plaintiff's recovery is then reduced by his percentage. For example,
suppose that the plaintiff's damages are $100,000 and that the jury
finds the plaintiff to have been 40 percent negligent. Reducing the
plaintiff's recovery by 40 percent yields $60,000. He therefore
recovers $60,000, because his recovery is reduced in proportion to
the amount of negligence attributable to him.

1. Pure Versus Modified Comparative Negligence

There are two forms of comparative negligence. Under the
“pure” form, the plaintiff's negligence is never a complete bar to
recovery. Rather, comparative negligence applies regardless of how
much more negligent the plaintiff was than the defendant. Thirteen
states have adopted this approach, 7 by judicial decision and 6 by
statute. In contrast, under the “modified”? form of comparative
negligence, if the plaintiff is found to be more negligent than the
defendant (and under some versions, “‘as negligent” as the defen-
dant), comparative negligence does not apply and the plaintiff's
contributory negligence is a complete bar to recovery. Thirty-three
states have adopted this approach, 3 by judicial decision and 30 by
statute. Under modified comparative negligence, when the plaintiff
is entitled to recover anything he recovers exactly what he would
recover under pure comparative negligence. The difference is that
the plaintiff can always recover something under pure comparative
negligence except when he is 100 percent negligent, which is
tantamount to saying that the defendant was not negligent at all
and therefore not liable. In contrast, under modified comparative
negligence a plaintiff who is more negligent than the defendant
(and under some versions, as negligent as the defendant) recovers
nothing.

Under modified comparative negligence a small variation in the
amount of negligence attributed to the plaintiff can mean the
difference between a substantial recovery and none at all. Probably
the most common jury attribution of negligence is a finding that
each party was 50 percent negligent. In a jurisdiction that applies
modified comparative negligence as long as the plaintiff's negli-
gence is “not greater than” the defendant’s, the plaintiff recovers

173
TORT LAW

one-half of his damages under this scenario. In a jurisdiction that
applies comparative negligence only if the plaintiff's negligence is
“not as great as’ the defendant’s, however, the plaintiff will be
completely barred from recovery when there is a 50-50 attribution.
Juries that understand this possibility can take it into account,
making sure that they do not attribute “‘too much” negligence to
the plaintiff and thereby bar him from any recovery at all. In most
states with modified comparative negligence, the jury is instructed
regarding the way in which comparative negligence operates and
can make an “‘adjustment’’ in the amount of negligence attributed
to the parties to assure some recovery for the plaintiff, if the jury so
desires. In a few states, however, the jury is simply asked to bring
in a special verdict indicating the total amount of the plaintiff's
damages and the amounts of negligence attributable to each party.
The court then makes the calculations necessary to determine if the
plaintiff is entitled to a recovery and, if so, in what amount. In
these latter states the difference between a 50/50 and a 51/49 jury
finding can have an enormous impact.

2. The Basis for Comparison

Comparative negligence is just what its name implies—compar-
ative negligence, not comparative causation. In any individual case
it is possible for a party to be slightly negligent and cause a great
deal of harm, just as it is possible to be very negligent and yet cause
little harm. Note, however, that in comparing negligence there is an
automatic comparison of an aspect of causation, because the fore-
seeable probability of causing harm is a component of what it
means to be negligent. A jury’s decision regarding the degree of
negligence attributable to a plaintiff or defendant should therefore
take into account the probability that the conduct in question will
cause harm, even though the amount of causal contribution in this
particular case is not relevant. Thus, in a sense it is average
potential causal contribution under the circumstances rather than
the particular causal contribution in the case at hand that is taken
into account.

In any event, it would be difficult to operate a pure compara-
tive causation system. The very notion of a causal comparison apart
from the parties’ negligence is far from clear. Suppose that the
plaintiff drives 60 miles per hour in a 30 mile per hour zone and
the defendant drives 90 miles per hour in the same zone. One view
of the matter would be that the parties’ causal contributions should
be measured by the amount of their causal negligence. On this view
the defendant’s contribution is 66 and 2/3 percent and the plain-
tiff’s 33 and 1/3 percent—60 miles per hour over the speed limit

174
DEFENSES BASED ON PLAINTIFF'S CONDUCT

versus the plaintiff's 30 miles per hour over. Another view would be
that the amount of each party’s causal contribution is a matter
separate from their negligence, once it is shown that they are
negligent. On this view the defendant’s causal contribution is 60
percent (9/15ths of the total amount of speed) and the plaintiff's
was 40 percent (6/15ths). Both of these approaches, however, ignore
other factors that may have caused the damage that actually
resulted from the parties’ negligence—for example, the weight of
each vehicle.

In theory, comparing negligence alone and not causation side-
steps these issues. Of course, instructing the jury that it is to take
negligence but not causation into account in making its compara-
tive attribution is not the same as assuring that this is done.
Moreover, comparing negligence is not always a simpler task than
comparing causation, though it is admittedly a different operation.
For instance, it not at all clear in the above example that the
defendant was twice as negligent as the plaintiff. The defendant
was exceeding the speed limit by twice the amount of the plaintiff’s
exceedence. But plaintiff was driving at a speed (60 miles per hour)
at which he was undoubtedly able to control his vehicle. In con-
trast, at 90 miles per hour the defendant probably had much less
ability to control his vehicle, and much less experience doing so at
that speed as well. Perhaps, therefore, the defendant was more
than twice as negligent as the plaintiff.

Nor is the comparison always between the same ‘“‘kinds”’ of
negligence. Suppose that the defendant was speeding and that the
plaintiff failed to come to a complete halt at a stop-sign. The jury in
this case must compare ‘“‘apples and oranges,”’ so to speak. At least,
however, the comparison is between two different kinds of negli-
gent driving. Sometimes the forms of negligence the jury must
compare are even less like each other than this. Sometimes, that is,
the jury must compare apples with something that isn’t fruit at all.
For example, suppose that the plaintiff negligently failed to trim a
tree on his property and as a result the defendant, who was
negligently speeding, did not see a stop-sign obscured by the tree.
Braking at the last minute, the defendant skids and injures the
plaintiff. The negligence of the two parties adds up to 100 percent.
How much negligence should be attributed to each?

The law of comparative negligence has nothing much to say
about the problems entailed in making such comparisons. And I am
not suggesting that it should. These are simply issues for a jury
that is instructed to compare the negligence of each party. The jury,
must struggle, evaluate, and respond with a comparative attribu-
tion of the parties’ negligence. But no one should assume that a

175
TORT LAW

jury’s task under comparative negligence is as simple and straight-
forward as comparing two quantities that are already in the same
currency of exchange. The jury’s task is more complicated than
that, and sometimes far more complicated.

3. Assessment

There is considerable debate in the literature about the com-
parative effectiveness of contributory and comparative negligence
in deterring accidents. The overall implication of this literature is
that neither approach is likely to be a systematically superior
method of deterring accidents. Intuitively this seems obvious: other
things being equal, plaintiffs are likely to exercise marginally
greater care under contributory negligence and defendants are
likely to exercise marginally greater care under comparative negli-
gence. No one can say in general whether the loss of deterrence in
the one respect will or will not be more than offset in the other
respect. In any event, in practice other things usually are not equal.
To take just one of many complicating factors as an example,
whether potential victims know that a comparative negligence rule
is in force may affect the relative deterrence capacity of compara-
tive and contributory negligence rules. Yet some people will know
about the comparative negligence rule and others will not. Conse-
quently, one’s assessment of the attractiveness of comparative
negligence must depend mainly on considerations other than deter-
rence.

In addition, I am not aware of any studies of the incidence of
jury findings in modified comparative negligence states that the
plaintiff was more negligent than the defendant. This is an entire
area in which contributory negligence in theory still applies and
bars the plaintiff from any recovery. On the other hand, it may be
that the percentage of cases in these states in which juries find that
the plaintiff was more negligent than the defendant and completely
barred from recovery is small.

In any event, in my view the appeal of comparative negligence
to the ordinary individual’s sense of fairness is sufficiently great to
render this factor alone virtually dispositive on the issue. The
contributory negligence rule that completely barred recovery from a
negligent injurer because the victim also was negligent, without
regard to the degree of that negligence, was and is highly objection-
able to most people’s sense of fairness. Virtually every ordinary
person’s immediate reaction to the contributory negligence defense
is that recovery should not be barred in this situation, but that the
amount recovered should be reduced in some proportion that takes
the victim’s negligence into account. One might quibble about

176
DEFENSES BASED ON PLAINTIFF’S CONDUCT

whether the proper approach should be pure or modified compara-
tive negligence, and about the details of the scheme adopted. But
the day when the contributory negligence defense meshed with the
common sense morality of ordinary people—if it ever did—has long
since passed. The adoption of comparative negligence in all but a
handful of states is a reflection of the now-dominant moral sense
that some recovery should be permitted for negligent victims,
though not as much as for those who were not at all negligent.

B. Applications

Legislative enactment or judicial adoption of comparative negli-
gence creates the need for a whole new jurisprudence resolving the
many issues that arise under a comparative negligence regime.
Entire treatises are now devoted to these issues, few of which are
resolved in the statutes or judicial decisions that initiate the new
regime.

1. Multiple Defendants

Suppose that the plaintiff is 40 percent negligent and two
defendants each are 35 and 25 percent negligent, respectively. In a
modified comparative negligence jurisdiction, does the plaintiff re-
cover anything? That depends on the underlying logic of modified
comparative negligence. If this logic is that a plaintiff should be
entitled to recover something unless she is principally responsible
for her own harm, then recovery should be permitted. On the other
hand, if the underlying logic of a modified system is that a defen-
dant should not be held liable unless she is at least as responsible
for the plaintiff's harm as the plaintiff, then there should be no
recovery in this situation. Most courts have found the former
answer preferable. The move from contributory to comparative
negligence tends to be made more because of the unfairness of
contributory negligence to plaintiffs than because of a desire to
plug a loophole in the liability of defendants. A focus on the scope
of the plaintiff's responsibility therefore seems most appropriate in
the handling of multiple defendant cases.

2. Joint and Several Liability

Prior to the adoption of comparative negligence, multiple de-
fendants were jointly and severally liable to the plaintiff. Under
contributory negligence, as between a negligent defendant and an
innocent plaintiff (the only kind of plaintiff who could recover at all
under contributory negligence), joint and several liability properly
places the risk of one defendant’s insolvency on the other negligent

177
TORT LAW

defendant or defendants. Under comparative negligence, however,
the plaintiff is not entirely innocent, because he too was negligent.
If the plaintiff and two defendants are 40, 35, and 25 percent
negligent, respectively, should each defendant be liable only for its
share of the plaintiff’s damages, or should each of the two defen-
dants be jointly and severally liable for 60 percent of the plaintiff's
damages?

Three approaches, each of which have been adopted in whole or
in part in different states by statute or judicial decision, are
possible. The first is to hold the defendants jointly and severally
liable for the amount of the judgment (for 60 percent of the
plaintiff's losses) even though the plaintiff also was negligent. If the
defendants are merely concurrent but not joint tortfeasors, then
there is no particular logic to this approach, because the defendants
are no more responsible for each others’ negligence than the
plaintiff; this approach is simply a carryover of the prior rule. On
the other hand, if the defendants are joint tortfeasors or otherwise
acted in concert, the approach has some appeal.

Second, at the other extreme is an approach that in effect
revokes joint and several liability and holds each defendant liable
only for its own proportional share of the reduced judgment. Thus,
the first defendant in the hypothetical would pay 35/60ths of the
judgment. If the second defendant, whose proper share is 25/60ths
were unable to pay, then the plaintiff would be left without re-
course as to that share. This approach presupposes that, in effect,
not only are the defendants injurers of the plaintiff, but that the
plaintiff is an injurer of the plaintiff. Under this logic, each party is
liable to the plaintiff in proportion to the amount of its negligence,
and no party should be liable for more than its share.

The flaw in this logic leads to the third and, in my view, most
sensible approach. If each party including the plaintiff is an injurer,
then the injurers as a group should pay the injured party, and
should bear the risk that one of their number is insolvent. On this
view, the solvent defendant and the plaintiff should bear the risk of
the other defendant’s insolvency, in proportion to the amount of
negligence attributable to them. In our example, the plaintiff is 40
percent negligent and the solvent defendant is 35 percent negligent.
The insolvent defendant is 25 percent negligent and is unable to
pay its share of the defendants’ total share of 60 percent of the
plaintiff’s losses. Under the third approach, the plaintiff's and the
solvent defendant’s responsibility for the insolvent defendant’s
share would be apportioned by comparing the amount of negligence
attributed to them. The total of their negligence is 75 percent. In
addition to its own share, therefore, the solvent defendant would be

178
DEFENSES BASED ON PLAINTIFF'S CONDUCT

liable to the plaintiff for 35/75ths of the insolvent defendant’s
share. The plaintiff would have to bear the remaining 40/75ths of
the insolvent defendant’s 25 percent share himself.

3. Effect on Other Common Law Doctrines

The typical comparative negligence statute is short and makes
little or no reference to the new status, if any, of such common law
doctrines as last clear chance, assumption of risk, and the greater-
degree-of-blame exception to the contributory negligence defense.
The courts must therefore fill in what is omitted from the statutes,
by deciding the status of these doctrines under comparative negli-
gence.

As a transitional doctrine designed largely to mitigate the
harsh effect of the complete bar of the contributory negligence
defense, last clear chance should have no role as a separate doctrine
once comparative negligence is adopted. Most courts have so held.
Of course, to the extent that failing to avoid injuring the plaintiff
renders the defendant more negligent than the plaintiff, the jury is
entitled to take into account the defendant’s failure to use the last
clear chance into the negligence comparison. But the jury also is
entitled to take other factors into account. Having failed to take the
last clear chance should no longer be dispositive on the question
whether and for how much the defendant is liable, though that
failure may be relevant. Most courts have so ruled.

It is especially important for last clear chance to be abolished
entirely or not at all under a modified comparative negligence
regime. Otherwise perverse results may ensue. Suppose that last
clear chance were merely abolished when comparative negligence
applied, but continued to be in force when the plaintiff was more
negligent than the defendant. Then a plaintiff injured by a defen-
dant who failed to take the last clear chance would be better off
proving that he was more negligent than the defendant—because
last clear chance would eliminate the effect of his contributory
negligence and he would be entitled to a full recovery. In contrast,
if the plaintiff proved that he was less negligent than the defen-
dant, then (because last clear chance would not apply under com-
parative negligence) he would obtain only a partial recovery. Con-
ceivably a 51 percent negligent plaintiff could recover in full,
whereas a 49 percent negligent defendant would recover only 49
percent of his losses. To avoid this cockeyed kind.of result, last
clear chance must be entirely preserved or entirely abolished.

Treatment of the greater-degree-of-blame exception under com-
parative negligence varies. Once the jury is directed to compare the

faults of the parties, there is little need to place their actions into
categories of blame. Instead, faults can be compared directly. None-
theless, some courts have interpreted their comparative negligence
statutes to apply only to negligence actions and therefore to have
no effect on the greater-degree-of-blame exception. In effect, these
courts have held that the plaintiffs negligence is no defense at all
to an intentional or similar tort, but that neither does comparative
negligence abolish the same-degree-of-blame defenses to such torts.

Finally, under contributory negligence the defense of assump-
tion of risk (discussed in the next Section of this Chapter) complete-
ly bars the plaintiff from recovery when he knowingly assumes the
risk that the defendant will injure him. Usually this defense based
on the plaintiff's conduct is available, however, only when the
plaintiff's assumption of risk was unreasonable and therefore negli-
gent. The majority of courts have concluded, therefore, that it
would make little sense to preserve an independent assumption of
risk defense within comparative negligence, since the plaintiff's
unreasonable assumption of risk can simply be taken into account
in making the comparative negligence attribution.

4. Strict Liability

Contributory negligence is a defense to a strict liability action
in some jurisdictions and not in others..The availability of the
defense also sometimes varies depending on the type of strict
liability action at issue. How should the adoption of comparative
negligence affect strict liability actions if the statute itself does not
address the issue?

The most straightforward approach is simply to apply compara-
tive negligence wherever contributory negligence previously ap-
plied. But it could be argued that contributory negligence ought to
continue to be a complete defense to a strict liability claim wherev-
er it was a complete defense prior to the adoption of comparative
negligence, because the plaintiff is clearly more negligent than the
defendant, who is held liable without fault. A fairly persuasive
response to this argument is that when a defendant is held strictly
liable it is not found to be free from negligence; rather, the issue is
simply irrelevant. It is possible that the defendant was negligent,
and therefore possible to compare that negligence with the negli-
gence of the plaintiff, if any. Whether the defendant was negligent
and, if so, how negligent, would then become issues at the trial of

any strict liability action in which the defendant raised the defense
of the plaintiff's negligence.

180
DEFENSES BASED ON PLAINTIFF'S CONDUCT

In some strict liability situations, however, contributory negli-
gence was not a defense. Should comparative negligence be applied
in these situations? The strength of the argument opposing intro-
duction of this new defense depends on the reason contributory
negligence was not a defense. If the point of denying the defense
was that the defendant in the kinds of cases that are subject to
strict liability is the best bearer of the risk that the kinds of
accidents in question will occur, then that does not change with the
enactment of comparative negligence. On the other hand, if contrib-
utory negligence was not a defense because it was viewed as
excessively harsh, then a comparative negligence defense to strict
liability might make sense. For example, it may be that in cases
involving strict liability for abnormally dangerous activities com-
parative negligence should not be a defense for this reason, but that
in strict products liability actions comparative negligence should be
a defense. These forms of strict liability are discussed in Chapters
Hight and Nine, respectively.

A final problem, relevant in both of the contexts just discussed,
is how comparative negligence can possibly operate if the defendant
was not in fact at fault but is held strictly liable nonetheless. What
is the jury to compare with the plaintiff's negligence? One possibili-
ty is that the plaintiff's negligence should be compared with the
way he should have behaved. If he was half as careful as he should
have been, then his damages should be reduced in half. But this has
not been the answer given by the courts that have addressed the
problem. Their answers have not been entirely coherent, and some-
times they have come close to admitting it. For example, in holding
that comparative negligence does apply in strict products liability
cases, the Supreme Court of California dismissed the argument that
the jury in such cases would be required to compare “apples and
oranges,”’ and instead redescribed the jury’s function. Comparing
the fault of the parties, the Court said, was not what the jury was
really being asked to do. Rather, the jury was to engage in an
“equitable” apportionment of liability.» The Court’s ultimate con-
clusion—and that of many courts addressing the issue—was that
regardless of whether it is conceptually coherent to employ compar-
ative negligence in strict products liability cases, it will be done
because it is fair to do so.

5. Setoffs

Suppose that in an automobile accident in a pure comparative
negligence jurisdiction, both the plaintiff and the defendant/coun-

5. Daly v. General Motors Corp., 20 Cal.3d 725, 144 Cal.Rptr. 380, 575 P.2d 1162
(1978).

181
TORT LAW

terclaimant are injured. A judgment is entered in favor of each
party, specifying the amount of damages to be awarded to each. If
neither were insured there would ordinarily be a setoff of the
smaller award against the larger one, and the net amount remain-
ing would be awarded to the party who had the larger judgment.
For example, if the award to the plaintiff (in light of the amount of
negligence attributed to him) were $100,000 and the award to the
defendant/counterclaimant (again, in light of the amount of negli-
gence attributed to him) were $50,000, then the plaintiff would be
entitled to recover $50,000 from the defendant/counterclaimant,
and the defendant/counterclaimant would be entitled to recover
nothing from the plaintiff.

But suppose that both are covered by liability insurance.
Should the result be the same? If there is no setoff, then the
defendant/counterclaimant’s insurer owes the plaintiff $100,000,
and the plaintiff's insurer owes the defendant/counterclaimant
$50,000. On the other hand, if there is a setoff, then the defen-
dant/counterclaimant’s insurer owes the plaintiff $50,000, and the
plaintiff's insurer owes nothing: the parties’ insurers save $50,000
each. The argument for a setoff is that liability insurance simply
pays only what a policyholder/defendant owes the plaintiff, and only
after a setoff occurs can the amount that a policyholder actually
owes the other party be determined. The response to this argu-
ment, which has prevailed whenever the issue has arisen, is that a
major function of liability insurance, especially in the auto-accident
setting, is not merely to protect injurers against liability, but also to
assure victims a recovery from negligent parties who cannot afford
to pay judgments themselves. A setoff would further deprive vic-
tims of compensation, after they have already been awarded only
partial compensation in the first instance because of their negli-
gence. It follows that no setoff should be allowed, and that each
party’s liability insurer must pay his or her adversary’s judgment.

III. Assumption of Risk

The notion of “assumption of risk” is used in four different
contexts in tort law, often without the clarity necessary to distin-
guish these contexts from each other. It might actually be beneficial
to abolish the phrase ‘“‘assumption of risk” entirely and use differ-
ent terms for each of the four situations in which the phrase is now
used. But obviously that is not possible. Consequently, we must live
with the multi-faceted concept of assumption of risk, taking care to
recognize that the concept has different meanings, and different
legal consequences, in different situations.

182
DEFENSES BASED ON PLAINTIFF’S CONDUCT

A. Express Assumption of Risk

Sometimes an individual contractually agrees in advance to
waive his or her right to bring a tort action against a potential
injurer. This often happens, for example, in residential leases
containing exculpatory clauses or disclaimers of the landlord’s
liability to the tenant for negligence, in health club membership
contracts, or when a skier buys a lift ticket. Often these waivers are
valid when entered knowingly, voluntarily, and with appreciation of
their significance. The importance of the service or commodity
being sold and the bargaining power of the parties also are rele-
vant. Health care providers’ disclaimers of liability for malpractice,
for example, are virtually always invalid.’ This form of assumption
of risk, when valid, is simply a contractual surrender in advance of
the right to sue. The party surrendering this right is in fact
assuming a risk, in the sense that she may be tortiously injured but
uncompensated. Note that this form of assumption of risk does not
hinge in any way on the nature of the plaintiff's conduct, aside
from her express agreement to waive her tort rights.

The remaining three forms of assumption of risk are often said
to be “implied,” in order to distinguish them from an express
agreement waiving the right to sue. Because these other three
forms of assumption of risk otherwise are very different from each
other, however, they must be considered separately.

B. No Duty of Care Breached by the Defendant

Suppose you go to a baseball game and sit behind first base.
The third baseman fields a ground ball and throws high to the first
baseman. The ball flies into the stands and injures you. In your suit
against the owner of the stadium, you allege that it was negligent of
the defendant to fail to erect a net behind first base to protect fans
from the risk of this kind of injury. This theory of liability will
almost certainly be rejected on the ground that as a matter of law it
was not negligent for the defendant to have failed to erect a net
behind first base. But this is not a defense based on the particular
plaintiff's conduct, and indeed not a defense at all. Rather, the
defendant will prevail because of the failure of the plaintiff to
satisfy his or her burden of showing that the defendant was
negligent. That is, the defendant did not breach its duty of care to
the plaintiff, because the exercise of reasonable care did not require
that a net or other method of protecting the plaintiff be provided.

6. The seminal case on the issue is Tunkl v. Regents of University of California,
60 Cal.2d 92, 32 Cal.Rptr. 33, 383 P.2d 441 (1963).

183
TORT LAW

Another way of saying the same thing is to say that you
‘assumed the risk”’ that you would be injured by a high throw to
first base. But this way of putting the point is simply the logical
corollary of the holding that the defendant was not negligent.
Indeed, except in connection with activities that involve strict
liability for the injuries they cause, a victim/plaintiff always and
necessarily ‘‘assumes” the risk that he will be non-negligently
injured. ‘‘Assumption of risk’’ in this sense is simply another way
of saying that there is no liability if the defendant did not breach a
duty of care to the plaintiff. In an unfortunate turn of phrase this
form of assumption of risk is sometimes referred to as “primary”
assumption of risk, to distinguish it from what is sometimes called
“secondary” assumption of risk (discussed in the next Section).
However, there is nothing at all “primary” about this usage or the
situation to which it is applied, aside from the fact that it is a way
of talking about failure of the plaintiff's prima facie case rather
than about a defense. But the term “primary,” though far from
universal, is sometimes employed by the courts to describe this
notion.

This does not mean, however, that the name ‘assumption of
risk” is applied to such situations for no reason at all. On the
contrary, in cases involving assumption of risk of this sort, often
the holding that the defendant was not negligent turns on factors
that involve the openness of the risk and the voluntariness of
typical or ordinary people’s participation in the activity in question,
in addition to the reasonableness of the risks posed by the activity
in light of its benefits. That is why the phrase assumption of risk is
more likely to be applied to attending a baseball game than, say, to
walking down the street. How much care is owed the audience at a
baseball game depends in part on how much the audience in
general, though not any particular member of it, knows, and how
much self-protective care the audience in general is capable of
taking. Note, however, that in walking down the street I ‘‘assume
the risk” that I will be injured by non-negligent driving. The logical
structure of the law applying to these situations is the same, even if
the phrase “assumption of risk’? seems to apply more comfortably
to the baseball game.

C. A Subset of Contributory Negligence

Traditionally, the courts regarded the plaintiff's conscious,
negligent assumption of risk as a complete bar to recovery. This is
therefore the category as to which, since the adoption of compara-
tive negligence, it is rather important to understand the nature of

184
DEFENSES BASED ON PLAINTIFF’S CONDUCT

assumption of risk. If unreasonable assumption of risk is a species
of contributory negligence (as most courts now conceive of it), then
it is subject to comparative negligence and does not result in a
complete bar to recovery by the plaintiff.

There are two general ways in which a plaintiff may unreason-
ably risk suffering harm to himself. The first involves the plaintiff's
careless failure to recognize or appreciate a risk. The second is the
plaintiff's conscious taking of an unreasonable risk. Each is contrib-
utory negligence. But the second form of contributory negligence is
typically called ‘“‘assumption of risk.’ Unlike the two forms of
assumption of risk discussed above, this form of assumption of risk
is in fact a defense, and it is based on the plaintiff's conduct in
taking a risk. This defense is sometimes called “‘secondary’’ as-
sumption of risk. But of course it is secondary only in the sense
that it is a true defense, available as a way for the defendant to
avoid liability even if proved negligent.

The problem with use of the term assumption of risk to
describe this form of contributory negligence is not that the use is
inaccurate, but that it is potentially misleading to juries. Ordinarily
only the conscious taking of an unreasonable risk—negligent as-
sumption of risk—is a defense. If I am walking carefully down the
street and you injure me by driving negligently onto the sidewalk,
you do not have a defense that I assumed the risk of injury merely
because I knew that some people drive negligently. On the con-
trary, it was entirely reasonable for me to be walking on the
sidewalk, and you are liable. Referring to assumption of risk
separately in a jury instruction, however, could give the jury the
impression that non-negligent assumption of risk is a defense to a
negligence claim. A jury instruction that it is a defense (complete or
partial depending on whether contributory or comparative negli-
gence applies) if the plaintiff was contributorily negligent or as-
sumed the risk of harm would imply that assumption of risk is
something different from contributory negligence. Such an instruc-
tion would incorrectly imply (or at least could easily be understood
to imply) that non-negligent assumption of risk is a defense, sepa-
rate and apart from contributory negligence.

Now it is possible to avoid misleading the jury, by employing an
instruction indicating that assumption of risk is simply one of the
two kinds of contributory negligence that may constitute a defense
based on the plaintiff's conduct: unreasonable careless risk taking,
and unreasonable conscious risk taking. The trouble with this
approach is that we do not really have a technical term for the
former category, other than “‘negligence by the plaintiff.’ For this
reason, the very use of the technical-sounding phrase ‘‘assumption

185
TORT LAW

of risk’ to refer to the latter category still runs the risk that the
phrase will stand out in the jury’s mind and be perceived as
something separate from ordinary contributory negligence. This
does not mean that the concept should not be used by lawyers and
judges analyzing available defenses—this is in fact the one situation
in which the term “assumption of risk’? seems appropriate and
useful. But the potentially misleading character of the phrase
“assumption of risk’”’ when used in conjunction with “contributory
negligence” suggests that it may be prudent not to use the phrase
“assumption of risk’’ in jury instructions that also refer to contrib-
utory negligence.

D. Conscious, Reasonable Risk-Taking

The last situation that is sometimes described as ‘‘assumption
of risk’? involves non-negligent risk-taking. For example, in the
Eckert’ case described in Chapter Three, the plaintiff's decedent
was killed while rescuing a child from being struck by a train. The
court held (among other things) that a jury could find that this was
not contributory negligence—i.e., assumption of risk—because the
decedent’s behavior was not unreasonable under the circumstances.

There is no question that as a matter of fact in this and similar
situations the plaintiff took a risk—i.e., knew that he might be
injured and went forward despite this risk. But that does not mean
that he ‘‘assumed the risk’”’ in the legal sense. Although the case
law by no means provides a uniform answer, the decided trend,
especially in the modern cases, is to side with Eckert and to hold
that the fact that the plaintiff consciously but non-negligently took
a risk is not a defense. After all, why should the plaintiff who does
not know of a risk negligently created by the defendant be better
off than the plaintiff who is aware of the risk and decides reason-
ably to take it? In most cases it makes normative sense to treat
both plaintiffs in the same way, though perhaps room for excep-
tions ought to be preserved. There are occasional cases in which
one would want to say that the plaintiff's actions, in context,
amount to a waiver that very much resembles an express assump-
tion of risk, even in the absence of the plaintiff’s use of words to
that effect. The so-called fireman’s rule, which bars firefighters
from recovering for injuries they suffer in fighting negligently set
fires, may be based on such an assumption of risk. In other settings
such matters as the availability of a choice between alternatives
that are offered by the defendant at different prices, together with
the plaintiff's clear understanding of the risks posed by the more

7. Eckert v. Long Island R.R., 43 N.Y. 502 (1871).

186
DEFENSES BASED ON PLAINTIFF’S CONDUCT

dangerous but cheaper alternative, would be relevant in determin-
ing whether there had been an implied waiver in that situation.

In short, there are some situations in which the plaintiff is
simply in a better position than the defendant to decide whether to
risk being injured by the defendant’s negligence, or not to do so.
For example, suppose that the plaintiff suffers accidental injury on
a country road. He needs medical treatment. Along comes the
defendant, driving while visibly intoxicated. The plaintiff decides to
ride with the defendant, who then drives negligently and further
injures the plaintiff. Even if, in view of this emergency, the plaintiff
is not negligent in asking for a ride, it still may make sense to
relieve the defendant of liability to the plaintiff for driving while
intoxicated. Applying assumption of risk to situations such as these,
rare though they may be, is tantamount to holding the plaintiff
strictly liable for injury to himself, because the plaintiff should bear
the consequences of his decision. This recognition makes it easier to
understand how some courts in this situation might say that,
although the plaintiff's action was not unreasonable and there was
no explicitly verbal waiver on the plaintiffs part, the timing,
clarity, and voluntariness of the plaintiff's informed decision to
take the risk in question yield the conclusion that the plaintiff may
not recover because he had ‘‘assumed”’ the risk of the defendant’s
negligence, even though the plaintiff was not negligent.

STRICT LIABILITY AND NUISANCE

This Chapter concerns liability for what have come to be called
“abnormally dangerous” activities, for ‘‘nuisance,” and “‘vicarious”
liability. The first two forms of liability are conceptually important
but are not frequently the subject of lawsuits. However, vicarious
liability, which includes the liability of employers for the negligence
of their employees, is enormously important in practice. It is the
most frequently imposed form of strict liability. All three forms of
liability are imposed without regard to the negligence of the defen-
dant and are therefore referred to as “‘strict’’ liability. It is impor-
tant to recognize at the outset that these liabilities are strict, but
not absolute. That is, liability is imposed in the absence of negli-
gence by the defendant only when a dangerous activity is “‘abnor-
mally” so, only when an activity rises to the level of a ‘‘nuisance,”’
or (in the case of vicarious liability) only when one party is
responsible for the actions of another. The key to understanding
strict liability, therefore, is to be able to identify the criteria that
must be satisfied to render an actor strictly liable—i.e., liable
without regard to negligence. To put it another way, since strict
liability is in effect activity-based, whereas negligence liability is
act-based, the critical question is what characterizes the activities
for which the negligence requirement is dropped. To address this
question, we turn first to general theories of strict liability, and
then to the three main forms that strict liability takes.

I. Theories of Strict Liability

There is no single authoritative or canonical statement of the
theory underlying strict liability in tort. A number of judges and
scholars have developed different theories that explain or support
strict liability. Note that some of these are descriptive theories;
they seek to explain the scope and nature of strict liability as it
stands in existing law. Others are normative theories; they are
addressed to what the law of strict liability ought to be, not what it
is. It is also important to recognize that many of the arguments for
strict liability accept the notion that some, perhaps even most,
liability for accidental harm should be based on negligence. But
they contend that in certain contexts, the negligence requirement

188
STRICT LIABILITY AND NUISANCE

does not or should not apply, and that strict liability is or should be
imposed. Thus, these are not simply theories about strict liability.
They are theories about the boundary between negligence and
strict liability and about the circumstances under which each
approach is, or should be, applied. Since strict liability applies,
when it applies, even when the defendant has not been negligent,
the essence of a theory of strict liability is the identification of what
advantages are or can be gained by imposing an additional incre-
ment of liability. Different theories emphasize different advantages.

A. Reducing Information and Error Costs

Determining whether a party has been negligent is often a
highly fact-intensive process. Adducing proof of negligence may
therefore be economically costly and time-consuming. Showing how
carefully the defendant acted on a particular occasion may involve
more cost and time than showing that the defendant was involved
in a particular activity for which strict liability is imposed. For
example, expert testimony is more likely to be required or permit-
ted to prove negligence than to prove the defendant’s involvement
in such an activity. Similarly, evidence of compliance with or
violation of a customary practice is admissible because it is relevant
to negligence, but is unlikely to be relevant in a strict liability
action. And because unexcused violation of an applicable safety
statute constitutes negligence, whether a statute was violated may
be at issue in negligence but not in strict liability cases. Imposing
strict liability makes all these issues irrelevant. There is no need to
gather evidence necessary to determine at trial how the defendant
acted, whether the defendant complied with a custom or violated a
statute, or was negligent in some other way. And there is no need
to occupy a trial with these factual questions. Trials may be shorter
or may not even need to occur. Strict liability therefore may reduce
litigation costs in the classes of cases in which the cost of making
the factual findings necessary to resolve issues that negligence
make relevant would otherwise be substantial.’

Keep in mind, however, that because strict liability does not
require proof of negligence, in general it is likely that there will be
more claims when an activity is subject to strict liability than when
there is liability only for injuries that result from conducting the
activity negligently. Thus, although per case administrative costs
are likely to be lower under strict liability than under negligence,
the cost of litigating additional cases under strict liability must be

1. See, e.g., Wituiam M. Lanpes & Ricuarp A. Posner, THE EcoNoMIC STRUCTURE OF
Tort Law 65-66 (1987).

189
TORT LAW

figured in if one is making a total-cost calculation. The net effect of
the interaction between per-case and total costs depends in part on
the level of generality at which a strict liability standard is estab-
lished. The per case cost of adjudication under a strict liability
standard set at a “‘high level of generality” is very likely to be lower
than the per case cost of adjudication under a standard set at a
“low level of generality.” For example, whether an activity is
“abnormally dangerous” can be determined in accordance with a
per se rule that admits of few exceptions and is almost cost-free to
apply—a rule such as “‘all use of explosives is abnormally dangerous
and results in strict liability.” This is a rule set at a very high level
of generality. On the other hand, whether there is strict liability
might be made to depend on a series of factors that distinguish
some uses of explosives from others—for example, how common the
use of explosives is in a particular area and how useful it is in that
community. This kind of context-dependent rule that is formulated
at a lower level of generality will result in case-by-case adjudication
that is likely to be more expensive and complicated than litigation
under a rule operating at a high level of generality.

In addition to information costs, because negligence is poten-
tially more fact-intensive, there is a greater risk of error in making
the negligence determination than in determining whether the
facts necessary to support strict liability have been proved. In strict
liability, as we will see below, there may be a need only to
determine whether the defendant used explosives, or whether bod-
ies of water are common in the area in which a reservoir burst.
These factual determinations tend to be subject to less error. In
contrast, in negligence, how carefully the defendant did what it did
is at issue. Such questions are probably more subject to error in
fact-finding. The key is to identify the cases in which this is most
likely to be true. Two hypotheticals can illustrate the problem.
Suppose that in a class of cases involving one activity—call them
Class A cases—juries impose liability for negligence 40 percent of
the time, whereas in fact defendants are negligent 60 percent of the
time. The rate of error in these cases is 20 percent under-imposi-
tion of liability. But the imposition of strict liability in Class A cases
would not reduce the rate of error; strict liability would increase
error. Under strict liability defendants would be liable 100 percent
of the time, whereas they are in fact negligent only 60 percent of
the time. The strict liability rate of error would therefore be 40
percent over-imposition of liability, as compared to 20 percent
under-imposition of liability under negligence. Some readers may
still want to argue that the former is preferable to the latter (and
certain of the notions discussed later in this section may support

190
STRICT LIABILITY AND NUISANCE

them), but their argument cannot be based on a reduction in the
error rate, since strict liability increases the error rate in Class A
cases.

Consider now Class B cases, in which the defendant is negli-
gent 60 percent of the time but juries impose liability only 10
percent of the time. The error rate is 50 percent under-imposition
of liability. Under strict liability the error rate would be reduced
from 50 percent under-imposition of liability to 40 percent over-
imposition of liability. What kinds of cases might these be? The best
candidate is the class of cases in which evidence of the defendant’s
negligence is either not available or very difficult to obtain—
perhaps because the kinds of accidents that characterize these cases
tend to destroy the relevant evidence—but defendants often are in
fact negligent. The courts sometimes find the transportation of
highly flammable material that is likely to destroy evidence of
negligence when it explodes to fall into this category. This may
sound a lot like the kind of analysis that leads to res ipsa loquitur,
which of course is a negligence doctrine. Recall, however, that one
of the functions of that doctrine also is to reduce the error rate, and
that some res ipsa cases closely resemble strict liability. It should
come as no surprise, therefore, that res ipsa and strict liability have
in common their potential capacity to reduce the error rate of the
conventional negligence system.

B. Influencing Activity Level and Research Decisions

One’s initial inclination is to suppose that imposing strict
liability will promote additional safety and therefore additional
accident reduction beyond what negligence liability alone can
achieve. After all, this line of thinking goes, strict liability threatens
potential injurers with liability for a greater range of activities and
therefore ought to generate more deterrence. In fact, however, this
is unlikely to be true as a general matter. Assuming that negligence
liability is accurately imposed (a key assumption), strict liability
will not cause any particular activity to be conducted with greater
safety than negligence liability. Recall from the discussion in Chap-
ter Three that at least in theory the threat of liability for negli-
gence deters all the accidents worth deterring—those whose costs
outweigh the costs of avoiding them—because liability for negli-
gence is imposed when accident costs outweigh avoidance costs, and
is not imposed when accident costs do not outweigh avoidance
costs.

Strict liability goes farther and imposes liability even in the
latter cases, when avoidance costs outweigh accident costs. But

191
TORT LAW

imposing liability in these cases will not change the level of safety
at which potential defendants engage in the activity in question: in
these cases it is cheaper to go on having accidents than to invest in
the additional safety necessary to avoid them. Because, in these
cases, avoidance costs outweigh accident costs, and potential defen-
dants are threatened with liability only for accident costs, it is
cheaper to continue causing these accidents than to avoid them,
even though one is strictly liable for their costs.

This conclusion does not depend on accepting the Learned
Hand calculus as the basis of negligence liability, or on an economic
theory of tort liability. Indeed, the conclusion does not even depend
on any particular conception of what it means to be negligent. The
conclusion depends only on the assumption that potential defen-
dants will tend to act in their own self interest. Setting litigation
costs aside, when defendants are held liable, they pay accident costs
only—damages suffered by victims. Potential defendants will only
avoid paying accident costs by acting more safely when acting more
safely is less expensive than incurring liability. Consequently, hold-
ing defendants liable even when they have not been negligent will
not cause them to act any more safely than it is already in their
interest to act because of the threat of negligence liability.

Other things being equal, however, the more a party engages in
an activity, even if it exercises reasonable care, the more injury or
damage will result. The threat of liability for negligence thus
generates no incentive to determine whether it would be more
sensible to engage in less of the activity, because exercising reason-
able care will insulate a party from any liability for injury or
damage that results from engaging in the activity. In theory,
liability in negligence could be imposed for engaging in too much of
an activity, albeit with reasonable care.” In practice, however,
negligence liability is rarely imposed for engaging in an excessive
level of activity. A party who drives safely is not held liable in
negligence for having driven too many miles during the week in
which he is involved in an automobile accident; oil companies are
not held liable in negligence for drilling too many wells as long as
the wells are not drilled in a negligent manner.

A shift to strict liability would give such parties more reason to
consider alternative methods of conducting their activities.’ As long

proportion to the number of miles a motorist drives. See Jennifer B. Wriggins,

STRICT LIABILITY AND NUISANCE

as a shipper of goods is liable only for negligence it may be cheaper,
all things considered, to ship by truck. Once there is strict liability,
however, it may turn out that, in fact, other methods of delivery are
cheaper, because they are inherently safer—that is, they involve
fewer non-negligently-caused accidents. For this reason, shipping
by train or air may prove to be less expensive after, but not before,
the shift to strict liability. And of course it may be that a partial
rather than a complete substitution of one activity for another is
the cost-minimizing approach. Thus, strict liability may produce
activity-level effects that negligence liability cannot.

Another way of putting this point is to say that under strict
liability potential injurers are threatened with liability for the full
cost of their risky activities, whereas under negligence liability they
are not forced to fully ‘internalize’? these costs. Under strict
liability, therefore, potential injurers have the incentive not only to
consider whether to conduct their activities more safely (an incen-
tive they already have under negligence), but also a greater incen-
tive to consider whether to shift to safer activities.

As a consequence, strict liability may create additional research
incentives, because under strict liability there is more to be gained
by avoiding liability. Under negligence, injurers are not liable for
accidents that are not worth avoiding. Consequently, injurers have
no incentive to attempt to discover cost-effective methods of avoid-
ing these injuries. In contrast, under strict liability, at any given
time there is a class of accidents that produces injuries not worth
avoiding. But because injurers are liable for these injuries anyway,
discovering a cost-effective method of reducing or eliminating the
injuries they cause will redound to their benefit. This research may
run from the very formal, such as laboratory investigation of new
ingredients or designs, to the very informal, such as simple investi-
gation of alternative methods of transportation of the sort I de-
scribed earlier. Indeed, the informal end of this continuum reflects
the connection between the potential activity-level effects of strict
liability and research incentives. In a sense some of the research
incentives that strict liability may create are incentives to discover
activities or activity levels that may substitute for those that
currently generate strict liability, in order to reduce net costs.

Like the other potential benefits of strict liability, this matter
of research incentives does not admit of easy generalization. Some
parties are more likely than others to be in a position to perform
formal research; and some activities are more likely than others to
be susceptible to change through cost-effective research. Moreover,
research itself entails certain costs but uncertain benefits. The
payoff from research cannot be known in advance. Investment in

193
TORT LAW

research therefore is not investment in accident reduction, but in
potential accident reduction. How much research is worth doing
can never be known with certainty. Thus, while it is generally true
that imposing strict liability can create greater research incentives
than negligence alone, it will not necessarily produce additional
research in any given situation.

For the above-stated reasons, the reader might quickly suppose
that on this score strict liability is therefore categorically preferable
to negligence. For two reasons, however, the choice is often proble-
matic. First, there may be activities for which there are no readily
available substitutes. Imposing strict liability for injuries caused by
these activities could result in more disadvantages than advan-
tages—more claims, no greater safety, and little or no change in
activity level. Second, and more significantly, in a sense there is
always strict liability and therefore there are always activity-level
effects. In fact, the underlying inquiry really is not whether defen-
dants should be strictly liable or liable only for negligence. Rather,
the question is who should bear strict liability: potential injurers or
potential victims. To see this, focus on what happens in a system in
which there is only liability for negligence. Under such a system
there still are non-negligently-caused injuries. Because there is no
strict liability for these injuries, those who suffer the injuries have
no cause of action against those who caused the injuries. This setup
can be accurately understood as “‘no strict liability for injurers.”’
But it is just as accurate to understand a negligence regime as
“strict liability for the victims of non-negligently caused accidents.”
This kind of strict liability system is implemented not by lawsuits,
but by the absence of lawsuits—i.e., by declining to impose strict
liability on injurers. The operative effect of this denial of strict
liability recovery by victims is that victims bear the cost of their
non-negligently-caused injuries—they are “‘strictly liable’’ for them,
to themselves.

The real question, then, is whether there should be injurer
strict liability, or only injurer negligence liability plus victim strict
liability. In some cases, depending on a host of factors, including
the parties’ knowledge of and control over alternatives, superior
activity-level effects can be expected from injurer strict liability, but
in other cases such effects can be more effectively obtained from
injurer negligence liability with victim strict liability. This will
occur when the most safety can be obtained by influencing poten-
tial victims’ activity levels. Consequently, the choice often is not an
easy one. From the activity level standpoint this insight helps to

4. See Guido Calabresi and Jon T. Hirschoff, Toward A Test for Strict Liability in
Torts, 81 YALE L.J. 1055 (1972).

194
STRICT LIABILITY AND NUISANCE

explain why some activities are subject to strict liability and others
are governed by negligence. Strict liability should be imposed when
potential injurers’ activity levels are likely to have more impact on
accident rates than potential victims’ activity levels. In addition,
there is little or no need for strict liability on the part of either
potential injurers or potential victims when the exercise of reason-
able care, coupled with the defense of contributory or comparative
negligence, is sufficient to eliminate the risk of most accidents. For
example, if virtually all automobile accidents are caused by negli-
gence, then imposing liability based on negligence alone will create
sufficient incentives for accident reduction, and strict liability will
not be necessary.

C. Promoting Insurance or Broad Distribution of
Losses

A third argument for strict liability rests on loss-distributional
rather than cost-reduction or incentive-creating considerations. We
saw above that in a sense there is always either injurer strict
liability or victim strict “‘liability” for the costs of non-negligently
caused accidents. Strict liability might be imposed because a partic-
ular category of injurers, rather than a particular category of
victims, is in the best position to insure or otherwise broadly
distribute the costs of non-negligently caused accidents.

If a particular category of injurers is likely in general to be
better insurers of these costs, then their superiority in this respect
is an argument for imposing strict liability on them.’ For example,
blasters may be better situated to purchase liability insurance, or to
raise the cost of their services, than potential blasting victims are
able to purchase health and disability insurance. On the other
hand, if particular categories of victims are likely to be superior
insurers of the costs of non-negligently caused accidents, then that
is an argument against strict liability. Capacity to insure depends in
part on knowledge of the nature and probability of the risks posed
by an activity. Since such knowledge is also a factor, along with the
capacity to control risk, in an actor’s ability to influence whether
accidents occur, insuring capacity will sometimes, though not al-
ways, be congruent with activity-level considerations.

In general, injurers are more likely than victims to be large
institutions that can spread the cost of liability directly in their

5. For discussion of the positions of two early proponents of this theory, Fleming
James, Jr. and Friedrich Kessler, see George L. Priest, The Invention of Enterprise
Liability: A Critical History of the Intellectual Foundations of Modern Tort Law, 9 J.
Lecat Srup. 461 (1985).

195
TORT LAW

prices or services, or to purchase liability insurance whose cost is
included in these prices or services. And in automobile liability, the
one major area in which injurers are predominately ordinary indi-
viduals, access to liability insurance, with the broad loss distribu-
tion that such access entails, is virtually automatic. Even in the
domain of loss distribution, however, injurers are not necessarily
always superior to victims as loss bearers. For example, consider
health care costs resulting from a tortious injury—one of the
principal components of damages that bodily injury victims recover
from tortfeasors. More than three-quarters of the population is
covered by health insurance, and the federal health care reform of
2010, if it survives constitutional challenge, promises that more will
be insured in the future. To be sure, such insurance does not
always cover every dollar’s worth of health care expenses incurred
by bodily injury victims. But the insurance provides substantial
protection. The cost of the health-care component of the vast
majority of bodily injury victims’ losses is already spread in broad
channels of loss distribution. The choice, therefore, is not between
broad loss distribution through injurer strict liability or narrow
distribution by declining to adopt such strict liability. Rather, the
choice is between two different channels of broad distribution.

D. Satisfying Rights-Based Norms of Responsibility

The last group of arguments for strict liability are not instru-
mental in the manner of the arguments discussed above; they are
rights-based. They turn on the existence of some norm of responsi-
bility for harm-causing conduct. One version of this approach is the
“‘benefit”’ theory that goes back about a century. The notion at the
core of this theory is that those who benefit from engaging in an
activity should rightly bear the costs associated with the activity.
The extra cost that strict liability places on injurers burdens them
less than what results when victims must bear losses that are non-
negligently caused. The benefit theory leads its proponents to
support strict liability on the ground that the owners, employees,
and customers of enterprises benefit from their activities and
should pay, at least indirectly, for the injuries that enterprises
cause.°

A second rights-based argument for strict liability is the ‘‘reci-
procity” theory, which holds that strict liability should be imposed
when an activity poses risks for potential victims that the victims
do not also pose for others. When the defendant creates a dispro-

6. See, eg., Gregory C. Keating, The Theory of Enterprise Liability and Common
Law Strict Liability, 54 Vanp. L. Rev. 1285 (2001).

196
STRICT LIABILITY AND NUISANCE

portionate, excessive risk of harm relative to the victim’s risk-
creating activity, strict liability should be imposed. Thus, when two
airplanes collide, they should be liable to each other only for
negligence. But when an airplane causes injury to those on the
ground, it should be strictly liable.’

A third theory is libertarian, and holds that liability should be
imposed when an injurer acts in a manner that causes the invasion
of the liberty of others. This is essentially a causal theory, under
which strict liability should be imposed, but only should be im-
posed, when an actor causes harm through the use of force, by
some form of compulsion, or by creating a dangerous condition.®

Having examined the potential advantages of strict liability
over negligence at a general level, we are now prepared to look at
specific doctrines. But it is important to understand the significance
of the foregoing analysis. Our task up to now has been to under-
stand what strict liability has the potential to do that negligence
cannot. Whether and when strict liability actually attempts to do
these things is a separate question that is resolved by the specific
doctrines to which we now turn our attention.

II. Traditional Strict Liability

What the law of torts terms “traditional”’ strict liability in-
volves liability for injuries caused by activities—ordinarily uses of
land—that were first termed “‘ultrahazardous” and that are now
termed ‘‘abnormally dangerous.” This Section traces the develop-
ment of this form of liability and of the limitations on its scope.

A. The Rise of Liability for ‘Ultrahazardous”’ Activi-
ties

Aside from some pre-existing rules governing liability for es-
caping animals, the modern development of strict liability begins
with the English case of Rylands v. Fletcher.’ The defendant in
Rylands had a reservoir constructed at a point on his property that

7. See, e.g., George P. Fletcher, Fairness and Utility in Tort Theory, 85 Harv. L.
Rev. 587, 543-46 (1972)

Rabin & Stephen D. Sugarman (ed’s.), Torts Stories 207 (2003).

197
TORT LAW

he did not know lay above, or at least was contiguous with, a
former coal mine. The water in the reservoir escaped through the
mine, flooding the plaintiff's property. The plaintiff could not show
any negligence for which the defendant was responsible, although
conceivably the independent contractors whom the defendant had
hired to construct the reservoir were negligent in failing to discover
the danger in question. The case went to trial and was then
appealed through several layers of appellate courts. Ultimately the
House of Lords held that the defendant was strictly liable.

Rylands was decided against the background late nineteenth-
century rule that there was liability only upon proof that the
defendant was negligent. Consequently, the key question in the
case is under what circumstances an exception to this general rule
would be made. The court purported to answer the question by
holding that there would be strict liability for damage caused by
what it called the ‘“‘non-natural use’’ of the defendant’s land. What
exactly the court meant, however, was unclear. At the extreme this
might mean that the escape of anything brought onto land that was
“not naturally there’’ (to use the language of Justice Blackburn in
one of the intermediate appellate courts in the case) would auto-
matically result in liability for the damage caused by the escape.
But such an “‘exception”’ to the rule that in general there is liability
only for negligence would have threatened to swallow up the
negligence rule as it applied to land use, since virtually all damage
caused by land use results from activities that are not literally
“natural” to the land in this sense. A more nuanced conception
would regard any use of a particular piece of land that had to be
conducted on that site because of its essential character as ‘‘natu-
ral.”” The mining of minerals from a site would then be ‘‘natural,”’
because the minerals at a site could only be removed from that site.
The construction and maintenance of a dwelling on a site would

also be natural, since this is a traditional and therefore ‘“‘natural’’
use of land.

American courts thought that the Rylands exception should be
understood in its extreme version and that it did swallow up the
liability-only-for-negligence rule. The courts took the case to be
rejecting much of negligence law. More firmly wedded to an un-
bending negligence requirement in the late nineteenth century
than the English courts, many American courts therefore rejected
Rylands, sometimes vehemently. For example, in Brown v. Col-
lins,”” the defendant was sued for damage caused by the non-
negligent escape of his horses. The court held for the defendant,

10. 53 N.H. 442 (1873).

198
STRICT LIABILITY AND NUISANCE

stating that ‘‘[elverything that a man can bring on his land is
capable of escaping * * *.”’ The court rejected the plaintiff's claim
that the defendant should bear strict liability, stating that it is
‘“Gmpossible that legal principle can throw so serious an obstacle in
the way of progress and improvement.”

Thus the American courts at first took the opposite extreme,
rejecting virtually all strict liability. Over the next half-century on
both sides of the Atlantic, however, the courts moved away from
their seemingly extreme positions and adopted an increasingly
intermediate view of the scope of strict liability. In England the
courts clarified the meaning of a “‘non-natural use,”’ explaining that
a “natural’’ use was one that was ordinary or common to the area
in which it took place. And in the United States, although the
courts often still rejected Rylands by name, they began to create a
series of specific and at first limited exceptions to the general rule
that there was no liability in the absence of negligence. In the
beginning only the most dangerous and unusual activities, such as
the use of explosives where this was not to be expected, resulted in
strict liability. But as time went on the kinds of cases made subject
to the exception expanded to include the operation of oil wells and
even the storage of unusual quantities of water. Many American
courts also recognized the traditional strict liability of the owners of
domesticated livestock for damage to land on which these animals
intruded. Interestingly, the decision whether to include an activity
in a strict liability category came to be one for the court, not for the
jury.

Sometimes the U.S. courts called the doctrine under which
strict liability was imposed for damage caused by these and other
activities ‘“‘absolute nuisance.’ But by the 1920s there were enough
decisions following a similar pattern for them to be recognized as
involving strict liability for conducting an ‘‘ultrahazardous activi-
ty.”"! The two factors that determined whether an activity was
ultrahazardous were the degree of danger it posed and how com-
mon it was in the area. The more dangerous and the less common
the activity, the more likely it was to qualify as ultrahazardous.

These factors tend to mesh in a rough and ready way with
aspects of the theories of strict liability set out in the preceding
Section. Remember that in important respects the choice is not
between strict liability and no liability, but between strict liability
for injurers and negligence liability for injurers with victims being
“strictly liable’ to themselves for injuries not caused by another’s
negligence. The two factors that qualify an activity as ultrahazar-

11. Restatement or Torts § 520.

199
TORT LAW

dous identify the situations in which imposing liability on potential
injurers will maximize certain of strict liability’s advantages. First,
the more dangerous an activity is, the more violent it is likely to be,
and therefore the more likely it is to destroy evidence that would
enable the plaintiff the prove that the defendant conducted the
activity negligently. Imposing strict liability in such situations is
therefore likely to reduce information and error costs. Second, the
more uncommon an activity is in a particular area, the more likely
it is that the activity-level and research incentives created by the
threat of strict liability will be most effective operating on potential
injurers rather than on potential victims.

This latter point is true for several reasons. To the extent that
an activity or land use is uncommon, those who are its potential
victims are unlikely to know much about it and therefore unlikely
to be in a position to do much to protect themselves against the risk
the activity poses. In addition, land uses tend to involve capital
investments and therefore to be comparatively costly to alter. And
potential victims of an uncommon land use tend already to be
engaged in common uses when the potential injurer makes the
decision whether to engage in an uncommon use. If you are already
operating a coal mine on your land you cannot very well pick up
and go elsewhere when a reservoir is built nearby. The potential
injurer is therefore likely to be in a better position to establish
optimal activity-levels at the outset, when the cost of doing so is at
its lowest, because this does not involve the sacrifice of already-
made investments that would be required of potential victims if
strict liability were not imposed.

In contrast, when a particular activity is neither especially
dangerous nor uncommon in an area, potential injurers probably
are not superior to potential victims in their ability to control the
risk of injury through activity-level adjustments or research. In
fact, to the extent that the activity in question is characteristic in
an area—maintaining mill dams in certain New England counties
or oil wells in certain Texas counties, for example—then many
potential victims are also potential injurers, because they too en-
gage in the activity. So these kinds of activities are unlikely to be
considered ultrahazardous. Certainly a potential victim considering
locating in the area is on notice of the common risks to which he is
subjecting himself and can look to the behavior of existing land
owners for guidance as to the best mix of protections to adopt
against these risks. In short, strict liability for engaging in ultra-
hazardous activities is something like common law zoning, designed
to encourage similar land uses in a particular area and to impose
the cost of engaging in a dangerous and uncommon use on the

200
STRICT LIABILITY AND NUISANCE

party who decides not to comply with the ‘‘zoning”’ implications of
the strict liability rule.

B. The Modern Conception: Strict Liability for “‘Abnor-
mally Dangerous” Activities

By the time the Second Restatement of Torts was prepared in
the 1960’s, there had been a sufficient number of strict liability
cases that the factors comprising the test for strict liability ap-
peared to be more nuanced than the two blunt criteria figuring in
the test for ultrahazardousness. The new test included three differ-
ent factors affecting dangerousness (degree of risk, probability of
harm, and inability to eliminate the risk by the exercise of reason-
able care), two factors affecting commonness (the extent to which
the activity is uncommon and its “‘inappropriateness” to the area),
plus a new consideration: the extent to which the value of the
activity to the community is outweighed by its dangerousness. To
distinguish this new test from the one it replaced, it was termed
strict liability for damage caused by ‘‘abnormally dangerous”’ activi-
ties.” This modern test meshed with the theory of strict liability in
roughly the same way as did the earlier test, except that the last
factor—value to the community—occasionally functioned as a
trump, saving from strict liability the rare activity that warranted
protection from this regime even when it was dangerous and
unusual.

The new test both reflected the tendency of the courts in the
modern period to engage in case-by-case analysis of strict liability
claims and encouraged this practice. The advantage of this ap-
proach was that it had the capacity to draw fine distinctions
between activities in light of the weight of the six factors that
comprised the test. But the approach also had disadvantages. The
great advantage of the earlier ultrahazardous activity approach was
not only that it was simpler, but also that, for precisely this reason,
it encouraged the formulation of strict liability rules at a compara-
tively high level of generality. The fact that the question whether to
impose strict liability was typically for the court (as it still is) rather
than for the jury underscored the importance of the level-of-
generality feature of the strict liability decision. But a test that
fine-tunes through reference to a series of factors inevitably pushes
decisionmaking to a lower level of generality.

It has turned out, however, that certain of the factors specified
in the Second Restatement have been more influential than others.

12. See ResTaTEMENT (SECOND) oF Torts §§ 519-20.

201
TORT LAW

Whether the dangers posed by an activity can be eliminated
through the exercise of reasonable care and whether the activity is
a matter of common usage have been most significant. The value of
the activity to the community, while sometimes mentioned, has
been least influential. Indeed, some courts have ruled expressly
that this factor is irrelevant to strict liability in their state.

For example, in Indiana Harbor Belt R.R. Co. v. American
Cyanamid Co.," the defendant was a manufacturer that had
shipped 20,000 gallons of a toxic and flammable chemical in a
leased railroad tank car. The plaintiff was a company in the
business of switching cars from one railroad line to another. The
car leaked while in a railroad yard at which it was to be switched.
As a consequence the plaintiff was forced to undertake decontami-
nation and other measures to prevent injury and further property
damage, including evacuating nearby homes.

The court declined to impose strict liability on the defendant,
focusing heavily on two considerations. The first was the probabili-
ty that the leak could have been prevented through the exercise of
reasonable care in the inspection and maintenance of the tank car
in question. The court distinguished cases holding transporters of
gasoline strictly liable for explosions, on the ground that explosions
typically destroy evidence of negligence, whereas leaks do not. The
second consideration was the impossibility, in the court’s view, of
strict liability’s having an activity-level effect in this kind of case,
because of the difficulty of routing rail-transported material away
from the metropolitan areas that serve as railroad hubs.

The court’s reasoning may well be correct on the merits. But
note the low level of generality at which this application of the
criteria for determining whether an activity was abnormally dan-
gerous took place. The court did not ask whether, in general, the
transportation of flammable toxic material is abnormally danger-
ous. Rather, the questions the court considered were whether there
is strict liability when the particular means of escape of such
material from the railroad tank car in this case could ordinarily be
prevented through reasonable care, and whether the adoption of
particular alternative routes of railroad transportation would result
from the imposition of strict liability. These are highly fact-sensi-
tive and context-dependent questions. As a consequence, the deci-
sion in Indiana Harbor Belt provides incomplete guidance, at best,
as to the proper result when the next tank-car accident involves an
explosion rather than a leak, or a smaller quantity of the same

13. 916 F.2d 1174 (7th Cir.1990).

202
STRICT LIABILITY AND NUISANCE

substance that could have been shipped by truck or air instead of
rail.

The most recent restatement, RESTATEMENT OF Torts (THIRD):
LIABILITY FOR PHYsICAL AND EMOTIONAL Harm, makes a partial return
to the approach of the First Restatement. Section 20 of the Turrp
RESTATEMENT hinges strict liability on three black-letter factors:
whether an activity poses a foreseeable and highly significant risk
of harm, and whether the activity is a matter of common usage. But
the Comments to this Section suggest that, aside from whether the
activity has value to the community (which has dropped out entire-
ly), the same factors that were considered by Section 520 of the
SECOND RESTATEMENT still should be taken into account in making
the strict liability determination.

C. Scope of Liability and Defenses

The rules governing the scope of strict liability and defenses to
traditional strict liability confirm what this form of liability is all
about. There is strict liability only for the kind of harm whose risk
makes the activity abnormally dangerous—for risks that are ‘‘char-
acteristic” of the activity. This is a complicated way of saying that
there is only strict liability if engaging in the relevant activity is not
only the cause in fact, but also the proximate cause of the harm the
plaintiff suffered. That requirement is not remarkable, except that
of course the whole point of proximate cause—to assure that a
defendant is held liable only for those consequences of his acts
which the law wishes to be actionable—underscores that strict
liability is not absolute liability for engaging in a particular activity,
but only for those consequences that this form of liability is
designed to address.

A striking example of this limitation on the scope of liability is
Madsen v. East Jordan Irrigation Co.,“ in which the plaintiff’s
mother mink ate their young after being frightened by blasting.
The defendant was held not to be strictly liable, precisely because
the possibility that this would occur is not even one of the second-
ary risks that enters into the decision to impose strict liability for
blasting. One way to understand this point is to say that the risk
that mother mink will eat their young is not foreseeable to blasters.
On this view, if the mink owner had warned the blaster of the
sensitivity of the mink, the result might be different; conversely, if
the blaster had already known of the presence and sensitivity of the
mink, there might at the least have been a duty to warn the mink

14. 101 Utah 552, 125 P.2d 794 (1942).

203
TORT LAW

owner. But a second way to view the decision is to say that the
purposes of strict liability are best served by holding the plaintiff
strictly liable for this kind of harm, because the risk is not only
more foreseeable to mink owners, but much more controllable by
them. With respect to the risk that blasting will frighten nervous
animals, mink owners are in a better position than blasters to make
the activity-level and research calculations that strict liability in-
duces.

For the same reason, from early on it was established that the
defendant is not strictly liable if the harm in question results from
an Act of God, or the unforeseeable intervention of a third party, or
from the plaintiffs knowing and unreasonable assumption of the
risk of harm. For example, the harm at issue may result from a
flood of utterly unprecedented magnitude, or vandalism, or the
plaintiff's own negligence. In these situations the purpose behind
strict liability—creating incentives beyond those flowing from the
threat of liability for negligence—is less easily served. The cause of
the harm in such cases is only remotely foreseeable. Because the
cost saving available to the defendant from adjusting its activity
levels in anticipation of liability for that kind of harm is therefore
likely to be speculative, the threat of liability would affect the
defendant only marginally at most, and not much is to be gained
from imposing strict liability.

Ill. Nuisance

A nuisance is a substantial and unreasonable interference with
the right of an owner or occupier of land to the use and enjoyment
of the land. Nuisance is distinct from trespass, which involves
interference with the right of possession and occupancy of land.
Although there are occasional exceptions, nuisances tend to be
pollution of one sort or another—contamination of water or air,
excessive noise, or other activities that affect use of another’s
property. There is a sense, however, in which virtually any use of
land affects use of a neighboring parcel. The presence of a perfectly
tasteful building three hundred feet from my house may affect my
view, my ability to live without any noise at all, the number of birds
that fly over my land, and so forth. If every such affect were a
nuisance, compatible land ownership could never exist: thus the
requirement that a nuisance be both substantial and unreasonable
to be actionable.

There is some dispute in the commentary and treatises as to
the standard of care that applies in nuisance. In the view of some
authorities, the standard of care is said to be intention to interfere

204
STRICT LIABILITY AND NUISANCE

with the plaintiffs rights. But it turns out that this means only
that the defendant must be aware of the effect that its activities
have on the plaintiff and then continue to conduct the activities. A
nuisance also may be actionable on the basis of negligence or strict
liability. Though it is worth recognizing that in particular jurisdic-
tions certain technicalities may make all the difference, a useful
working definition is that a nuisance is an activity resulting in a
particular kind of harm—interference with the use or enjoyment of
land—and that this interference may be actionable not only on the
basis of intent, but also on a negligence or strict liability basis if the
other preconditions to liability (fault or abnormal danger, respec-
tively) are met.

There are two kinds of nuisances: public and private. A public
nuisance is not a tort, but a species of low-level quasi-criminal
offense that affects the general public in common. An activity
blocking access to a public highway, for example, might be a public
nuisance. Actions to abate a public nuisance usually are brought by
governmental authority. In recent years certain states and munici-
palities have attempted to expand the traditional scope of public
nuisance by bringing suit against the manufacturers of handguns
and of the lead-pigment that was once used in paint, seeking to
hold these parties liable for creating a public nuisance by risking
harm to the general public. These suits have met with a bit of
success but mostly rejection. The only significant overlap between
public nuisance and tort lies in the possibility that, where a public
nuisance has been committed, a private party who suffers special
injury distinct from the general public may bring a tort action
against the party who commits a public nuisance, to recover these
special damages.

In contrast, a private nuisance is simply a nuisance that affects
particular individuals or entities. Private nuisance actions do sound
in tort. What makes private nuisance both interesting and distinc-
tive is what sets it apart from ordinary torts involving intention,
negligence, or strict liability. Two things stand out: what makes an
activity a nuisance to begin with, and the remedies that are
available once an activity is determined to be a nuisance.

A. When Is an Activity a Nuisance?

The textbook definition of a nuisance as a substantial and
unreasonable interference with the use or enjoyment of land re-
flects the notion that land uses tend to affect each other. For this
reason, minor ‘‘interference”’ by one landowner with certain uses
and enjoyments of other landowners is virtually inevitable. Even on

205
TORT LAW

a peaceful suburban street I cannot expect complete quiet or a
backyard totally free of the smell of hot dogs being barbecued by
my neighbor. Nor can the owner of a business located in an
industrial area expect to avoid the smells and fumes of ordinary
manufacturing. Up to a point the rule is that modestly incompatible
uses must “‘live and let live.’”’ To constitute an actionable nuisance,
therefore, an interfering use must be both substantial and unrea-
sonable in the particular context in which it occurs.

Once a particular use is more than modestly incompatible with
another use, a judgment-call by the courts is required. The need for
such a judgment-call is expressed in the rule that in determining
whether an activity is a nuisance, the courts “‘balance the equities.”
What counts as a “‘substantial’’ interference depends on all the
circumstances, including the nature of the neighborhood or area in
which the plaintiff and defendant occupy or use their properties.
And what counts as an “unreasonable” interference (which does
not necessarily not mean an unreasonable activity) depends on the
same factors.

Nowhere is the fact that the courts balance the equities more
evident than in the ‘“‘coming-to-the-nuisance” problem. Suppose
that a particular use—for instance, a factory that emits particulate
matter from a smoke stack—has been operating in an area sur-
rounded by a woods. The plaintiff then erects a home in the woods
and contends that the factory’s emissions constitute a nuisance.
Suppose further that if the plaintiff's home had existed when the
factory began operation, the factory’s emissions would have consti-
tuted a nuisance.

On first consideration one might want to say that the plaintiff
has only himself to blame and should not be able to recover.
Certainly the plaintiff's awareness of what he was getting into is
one of the equities to be considered, but further consideration
shows why this cannot always be dispositive. First, a rule that the
first party to make an active use of property gets the right to do so
without fear of liability in nuisance would encourage a race to make
active use of land even if such use was otherwise premature. That
would cause an undesirable “development race.” Second, the
“first”? use really is not operation of the factory, but maintenance of
the nearby property in an unimproved condition. The plaintiff was
not failing to use the property at all when the factory began
operation. On the contrary, he was “‘using”’ the property as woods.
To permit the defendant automatically to insulate himself from the
law of nuisance by building a factory is in effect to give him a right
to restrict the plaintiff's potential use and enjoyment simply by
being the first in the area to do something more with his land than

206
STRICT LIABILITY AND NUISANCE

enjoy its natural condition. This is true even if the plaintiff buys
the property after the factory is in operation, since the party selling
to the plaintiff has his rights reduced by a decrease in the market
value of the property if the plaintiff cannot sue for nuisance.

Moreover, inevitably there must come a point at which, if the
factory is otherwise a nuisance, the factory must yield to its
neighbors regardless of whose active use was first. For example,
once the entire area surrounding the factory is developed with
single family homes, the emission of particulate matter is certain to
constitute a substantial and unreasonable interference with the
plaintiffs’ use and enjoyment of their land. The factory owner is not
necessarily behaving unreasonably; but his interference with the
plaintiffs’ use is nonetheless “‘unreasonable’”’ in the sense of being a

greater interference than they should have to tolerate under the
circumstances.

A finding that the factory is a nuisance, however, is only the
first step in a two-step process of decision that takes place in
nuisance actions. The second step requires determination of the

remedy that is available once a particular use is held to constitute a
nuisance.

B. The Remedial Alternatives

Most tortious activity has long since concluded by the time an
action seeking compensation for the losses the activity has caused
reaches a courtroom. As a consequence, the only practical remedy is
the payment of damages to the plaintiff. In nuisance, however,
often this is not the case. It is common for the nuisance to be
continuing at the time a suit alleging its existence comes to trial.
Therefore, two remedies are available. The defendant may be
ordered to pay the plaintiff damages for all past and future losses,
but may be permitted to continue the activity that constitutes the
nuisance. Or the defendant may be ordered to pay the plaintiff
damages for all past losses, and be enjoined (prohibited by a court-
issued injunction) from continuing the nuisance thereafter.

Traditionally the law of nuisance has been that the court
balances the equities not only at the liability stage in determining
whether the defendant has engaged in a nuisance at all, but also at
the remedial stage in determining whether to enjoin the defendant
from continuing the nuisance or to permit the nuisance to continue
and to hold the defendant liable in damages only, for the plaintiff's
future losses. In making their remedial decisions the courts take a
variety of factors into account, including the parties’ respective

207
TORT LAW

faults, if any, the hardship to the parties in respect of the continu-
ance or discontinuance of the nuisance, and the value of the activity
that constitutes the nuisance to the surrounding community. Thus,
in Boomer v. Atlantic Cement Co., Inc.,”° the court declined to enjoin
the operation of a cement plant that was important to the economy
of the area in which it was located, in part on the ground that the
cost of discontinuing the nuisance—in both dollars and loss of
employment—was grossly disproportionate to the amount of harm
the nuisance was causing. This does not mean, however, that a
strict cost-benefit analysis occurs in every case. Many courts rou-
tinely grant a request for an injunction unless the equities weigh
decidedly in the defendant’s favor.

Appreciating the nature of this kind of equity-balancing is
probably all that is necessary to understand the rudiments of
nuisance remedies. For some time now, however, commentators
have been investigating the structure of nuisance remedies by
uncovering some of the assumptions that underlie the choice among
remedies.’® The commentators’ insights reveal a side of tort liability
that often remains hidden, because only already-completed harms
figure in most tort actions. The starting point for the analysis is the
simple point that the plaintiff may be successful or fail in seeking
either of two remedies: damages or an injunction. As a conse-
quence, there are in fact four possible remedial alternatives to be
considered when a plaintiff sues for nuisance.

1. No Nuisance: Defendant ‘Enjoins’”’ Plaintiff

In the first situation the plaintiff is completely unsuccessful in
his nuisance suit. The simplest way to understand this situation is
to say that the court has held that the defendant has not engaged
in a nuisance and has therefore denied the plaintiff any remedy.
Although such a ruling means that the defendant’s activity is not a
substantial and unreasonable interference with the plaintiff's use
and enjoyment of his land, it means something else as well. In fact,
the defendant’s activity almost always does interfere in some way
with the plaintiff's use and enjoyment, even if not in a substantial
and unreasonable way. Consequently, although the legal effect of
the failure of the plaintiff's suit is merely to permit the defendant’s
activity to continue, the practical significance of this permission is
that the defendant’s activity limits the scope of the plaintiff’s use

and Damage Remedies, 32 Stan. L. Rev. 1075 (1980).

208
STRICT LIABILITY AND NUISANCE

and enjoyment of his land. In effect, then, when a plaintiff’s
nuisance suit completely fails, the defendant enjoins the plaintiff—
ie., limits the plaintiffs future use and enjoyment of his land.
Thus, suppose that you live near me and play loud rock music on
Friday evenings in the spring. If my nuisance suit against you fails,

then you have enjoined me by limiting my quiet enjoyment of my
land.

This ruling need not end the matter, however. You now have
what amounts to a property right to play rock music on Friday
evenings. But if my quiet enjoyment of my land is worth more to
me than your music is to you, after I lose my suit (or even before if
I know I will lose) I may want to try to buy your right to interfere
with my enjoyment. A contract under which I pay you to stop
playing the music would ordinarily be valid and enforceable. There-
fore, a decision that you have not committed a nuisance merely
allocates to you the right to decide whether to use that right or to
sell it to me. Of course, like the owner of any property right, you
are entitled to place whatever value you wish on it, including
deciding that you will not sell at any price.

2. Nuisance: Plaintiff Enjoins Defendant

The traditional remedy when the defendant’s interference is
substantial and unreasonable is for the court to enjoin—i.e., prohib-
it—the defendant from continuing the nuisance, and to award the
plaintiff damages for past losses resulting from the nuisance. For
example, if my neighbor’s playing of music is so loud and so
continuing that I cannot hear myself talk inside my own house, my
nuisance suit may succeed. I will then be entitled to damages for
my past losses, and perhaps to an injunction from the court

directing the neighbor to cease playing music that can be heard
outside his home.

Notice however that, like the ‘‘remedy’’ that results when
there is a finding of no nuisance at all, the issuance of an injunction
need not end the matter. Rather, a holding that the plaintiff is
entitled to enjoin the defendant means that the plaintiff has what
amounts to a property right to be free from the nuisance being
committed by the defendant. But at least in theory the plaintiff
may sell that right to the defendant and thereby permit the
defendant to continue his activity, at whatever price the plaintiff
wishes to charge and the defendant is willing to pay. If the plaintiff
sells, in effect he will have substituted his right to an injunction for
the payment in advance of future damages, but damages as meas-
ured by the plaintiff rather than by a jury.

209
TORT LAW

It may come as a surprise that an injunction issued by a court
could simply be ignored by the parties if they agreed that the right
amount of money had been transferred from the defendant to the
plaintiff. After all, didn’t the court order that the nuisance be
abated? The answer is that judgments, whether for money damages
or for injunctive relief, are just pieces of paper until the party given
rights under the judgment seeks to enforce those rights. A defen-
dant found liable for damages in an ordinary tort case is permitted
to leave the courthouse without paying the plaintiff—we no longer
have debtors’ prisons. Nor do courts telephone the parties six
months after a judgment is entered to ensure that the defendant
has payed his debt to the plaintiff or complied with an injunctive
order. If the defendant pays voluntarily, the court never hears
about the matter again. If the defendant does not pay, collecting a
judgment requires the plaintiff to come back to court to obtain an
order directing that the defendant’s property be seized and sold in
order to satisfy the judgment. But just as a party in whose favor a
judgment for money damages is entered can decide not to collect
from the defendant, so a party in whose favor an injunction was
issued can decide not to enforce it.

The matter often is not as simple as this, however, for two
reasons. First, animosity between the parties and their distaste for
cash bargaining over their property rights may preclude negotiation
subsequent to judgment. Second, sometimes hundreds of people are
affected by the nuisance and may be named as plaintiffs in the
nuisance suit. The defendant in such a situation is unlikely to be
able to succeed in a buyout of an injunction, because of the
practical difficulty of dealing with multiple plaintiffs or because the
last plaintiff to sell his right has a very valuable asset—with the
result that there are multiple ‘‘holdouts” seeking to be the last
plaintiff to sell. Therefore, whereas a single-plaintiff injunction may
well be bought-off by the defendant, a multiple-plaintiff injunction
is likely to be enforced.

This prospect leads to an important insight. In the single-
plaintiff situation the law can afford, so to speak, to make a
mistake. If a court enjoins a nuisance but the benefit to the
defendant of continuing the nuisance is wholly out of proportion to
the benefit to the plaintiff of discontinuing the nuisance, it is likely
that the plaintiff will have his price and that the plaintiffs right to
an injunction will be purchased by the defendant. The parties will
“correct” the court’s “mistake.” In contrast, in the multiple-
plaintiff situation the law cannot afford to make a mistake, because
the “‘market’’ in nuisance rights is unlikely to be able to correct
that mistake through the sale of the plaintiffs’ right to an injunc-

210
STRICT LIABILITY AND NUISANCE

tion back to the defendant. For this reason, in the multiple-plaintiff
situation a high degree of confidence that an injunction rather than
an award of damages is the proper remedy is even more desirable
than in the single-plaintiff situation.

3. Nuisance: Defendant Compensates Plaintiff

In view of the above analysis, the first two remedies—defen-
dant enjoins plaintiff and plaintiff enjoins defendant—will need to
reflect a high degree of confidence on the part of the court that the
proper solution to any particular conflict between land uses is that
one should enjoin the other. The next two remedies involve an
award of damages rather than the issuance of an injunction. The

significance of the decision to employ one of these remedies is more
complicated.

Suppose that plaintiffs sue for an injunction or, in the event
that the request for an injunction is denied, an award of future
damages resulting from the continuation of the nuisance. For either
of two reasons, the court might decline to issue the injunction and
award damages instead. On the one hand, having balanced the
equities the court might decide that the social and economic costs of
discontinuing the nuisance are greater than the cost that will result
from permitting it to continue. An award of future damages rather
an injunction would therefore be the correct solution to the conflict
between land uses reflected by the plaintiffs’ suit. This was the
solution reached in Boomer v. Atlantic Cement, discussed above. On
the other hand, the court might be uncertain as to the proper
solution. As I noted above, when there is reason to believe that the
plaintiffs and the defendant can bargain to a solution, then issuing
an injunction still permits them to do this. But if a bargained-for
solution is unlikely to result because of the large number of
plaintiffs involved, the issuance of an injunction could produce the
wrong result. But an award of damages permits the nuisance to
continue if it can pay its way—that is, if the benefit to the
defendant of continuing the nuisance is greater than the amount of
damages awarded—which is of course the harm that the jury
predicts will result from continuation of the nuisance. Otherwise
the defendant will simply discontinue the nuisance instead of
paying future damages. One critical difference, then, between issu-
ing an injunction and awarding damages only, is that the former
remedy has the potential to permit the plaintiffs to decide whether
the nuisance should be continued and, if so, at what price, whereas
the latter remedy permits the defendant to decide.

211
TORT LAW

4, Nuisance: Plaintiff Compensates Defendant

At first glance this fourth possible remedy seems nonsensical
and the result only of a desire for symmetry with the previous one.
How could a plaintiff bring suit but end up paying the defendant?
In fact, however, the remedy has both a logic of its own and a
limited basis in the case law.

The logic of the remedy starts from the premise that the
correct solution of the conflict between the plaintiffs’ and the
defendant’s land uses is uncertain. An injunction is therefore not
the preferable remedy, at least not where multiple parties are
involved and the ‘wrong’? remedy cannot be bought off. But
suppose that, after balancing the equities, the court concludes that
the plaintiffs should be entitled to cause discontinuance of the
nuisance only if doing so is worth it to them. The proper remedy
would then be to permit the plaintiffs to compensate the defendant
for the cost of discontinuing the nuisance. If the benefit to the
plaintiffs of discontinuing the nuisance is greater than the cost of
doing so—as measured by the jury—then the plaintiffs will pay.
And if that cost is not worth it, they will decline to do so and
continue to suffer the nuisance.

It is rarely better to have the plaintiffs rather than the defen-
dant decide whether continuing the nuisance is worth its costs, but
occasionally the situation does arise. For example, in Spur Indus-
tries v. Del E. Webb Development Co., Inc.," the plaintiff was a
residential developer who came to the nuisance, a cattle feed-lot.
Smells and flies emanating from the lot constituted a nuisance to
the owners of the developed properties. But the court concluded
that, because the developer had come to the nuisance, it should
bear the cost of relocating the feed-lot. In effect, the developer, as
plaintiff, was entitled to purchase an injunction by compensating
the defendant for discontinuing the nuisance.

5. A Synthesis

In each of the four possible nuisance remedies, either the
plaintiff or the defendant is found to have an entitlement to use his
or her land in the manner that is contested, and the other party
must tolerate that use. The successful party’s entitlement may be
protected strongly, in the manner of a property right by an injunc-
tion, or more weakly, in the manner of a tort right, by the payment
of damages only.

Thus, the decision that there is no nuisance protects the
defendant with a property right, or “property rule,” and he can

17. 108 Ariz. 178, 494 P.2d 700 (1972).

212
STRICT LIABILITY AND NUISANCE

decide to sell or not sell, at his price. Similarly, a decision enjoining
the defendant from continuing a nuisance protects the plaintiff
with a property rule, and she can decide to sell or not, at her price.
In contrast, an award of future damages to the plaintiff protects the
plaintiff with a liability right or ‘“‘liability rule’ only. In this
situation the value of the plaintiff’s entitlement as set by the jury,
rather than by the plaintiff, prevails. Finally, an award of future
damages to the defendant protects the defendant with a liability
rule only. And in this situation the value of the defendant’s
entitlement as set by the jury, rather than by the defendant,
prevails.

In short, when an entitlement is protected strongly, as a
property right, the party holding the entitlement cannot be forced
to sell it. But when an entitlement is protected weakly, as a liability
right, another party can force the holder of the entitlement to
“sell” it, and the price of sale is set by the jury rather than by the
holder of the entitlement. Typically a tort right can only be protect-
ed weakly, by a liability rule, because the conduct interfering with a
plaintiff's entitlement has already occurred. There is no choice but
to permit a jury to place a “‘price’”’ on the lost or damaged entitle-
ment through an award of damages. But in nuisance, because the
defendant’s conduct often is continuing, the choice between the
strong protection afforded by a property rule and the weaker
protection afforded by a liability rule must be made.

IV. Vicarious Liability

The principal example of vicarious liability—liability for injury
caused by the conduct of another party—is the doctrine known as
respondeat superior (‘‘let the superior answer’’). Under this doc-
trine an employer is liable under some circumstances for the torts
committed by an employee.

The vicarious liability of an employer for torts committed by
employees should not be confused with the liability an employer
has for his own torts. An employer whose employee commits a tort
may be liable in his own right for negligence in hiring or supervis-
ing the employee. If in my business I hire a truck driver who has a
record of drunk driving and on whom one day I detect the smell of
bourbon, I (along with my employee) may be held liable for negli-
gence if his driving causes injury. But that is not ‘‘vicarious”’
liability—I am held liable for my own negligence in hiring that
employee or letting him drive after I know he has been drinking.

It has long been settled, in addition, that employers are vicari-
ously liable even absent their own negligence, for torts committed

213
TORT LAW

by their employees ‘‘within the scope of employment.”’ The theory
behind this form of liability reflects certain of the theories behind
strict liability generally. As between the employer and the victim,
the employer probably is in a better position to make the activity
level and research decisions that can affect accident levels. More-
over, it will often be difficult to prove that a particular employee
was negligent, because identifying the employee in question is not
possible even when it is clear whose employee he is. So respondeat
superior may reduce information and error costs. Finally, note that
this form of liability does not substitute the employer’s liability for
the employee’s liability. Rather, the employee continues to be liable,
but respondeat superior adds the employer as an additional defen-
dant. Given that employees as a group are more likely to be
judgment-proof than employers, the insurance or loss-distribution
function of strict liability clearly seems to play a role in supporting
the doctrine.

Two questions then arise. First, who is an ‘‘employee?’’ Sec-
ond, when is a tort committed “within the scope of employment?”
The requirement that the agent of the defendant be an employee is
an effort to distinguish at a fairly high level of generality between
those situations in which strict liability is likely to have the desired
effects and those in which is not. The principal situation in which
the party committing a tort is an agent but not an employee
involves independent contractors. If I hire an electrician to do work
in my apartment, he contracts with me but is not my employee. I
do not and could not control the manner in which he works to any
great degree. Indeed, if I told an electrician how to perform his
work he would probably tell me to get lost. And of course electri-
cians and other independent contractors work for many parties, not
just one. The possibility of control by an individual—other than the
electrician’s own employer—is therefore minimal. Finally, the elec-
trician’s employer is just as likely to have a “deep pocket” and
therefore to be in a position to spread the cost of liability as is the
party who hires him. All this may not be true in every instance, but
it is often enough true to make it worthwhile to draw a bright-line
distinction (ie., a rule at a high level of generality) between
employees and independent contractors in applying respondeat su-
perior.

The second requirement of respondeat superior is that the tort
at issue be committed within the scope of employment. The idea
behind this requirement is that the effects of strict liability can
operate through employers only so far. At some point the employ-
er’s capacity to control the conduct of employees, and consequently
the strength of the argument for imposing strict liability, both

214
STRICT LIABILITY AND NUISANCE

diminish. The phrase that captures this point is the distinction
between a “detour” and a “‘frolic.”” The employer is liable for torts
committed on a ‘‘mere”’ detour by the employee, but not for torts
committed while the employee is on a frolic of his own. This is an
easy enough point to see in the simplest of cases. If I tell my truck
driver to deliver a package across town and instead he drives a
thousand miles west, I am not liable for the accidents he causes
while on that frolic. But if he goes three blocks out of his way to
visit his girlfriend, I am liable for accidents that result while he is
on that detour. Obviously, it is not always possible to draw a bright
line between mere detours and frolics.

In addition, a number of hard cases arise when the employee
clearly is on a frolic, but it happens that the employer actually is in
a pretty good position to influence the conduct in question. The
classic case on this point is Ira S. Bushey & Sons, Inc. v. United
States,’* in which a drunken seaman returning from shore leave
opened the valve on a drydock and thereby caused severe damage to
the ship then in the dock for service. There is no way to describe
this as a “‘mere’’ detour. But drunken sailors are not only predicta-
ble; at least in the case of employees in the military, such conduct is
also somewhat subject to control by the employer. And of course the
employer -in that case—the U.S. government—had the deepest
pocket of all. Strict liability could therefore serve loss distribution
purposes as well. So perhaps it is not surprising that the court
pushed out the envelope of liability a bit farther than it had been in
the past and held that the tort was committed within the scope of
employment. The decision in Bushey is not typical, but its overall
flavor is not wholly extraordinary either. What counts as conduct
‘“‘within the scope of employment”’ will depend on how effectively
imposing liability on the employer for injuries caused by that
conduct will serve the purposes of strict liability.

Propucts LIABILITY

This Chapter concerns liability for injury and damage caused
by defective products. A substantial portion of products liability law
employs rules governing negligence and strict liability that closely
resemble the standards of care that have been covered in earlier
Chapters. This area of the law is nonetheless distinctive for two
reasons. First, applying the concepts of negligence and strict liabili-
ty to products liability has proved more difficult than might be
supposed. Second, unlike most of the other areas of tort liability
covered in earlier Chapters, the parties in a product liability lawsuit
often are in an indirect (or sometimes even direct) contractual
relationship with each other. The law of products liability is there-
fore in a position to take the actual and potential terms of this
relationship into account in fashioning the tort law rules that apply
to product-related injuries.

Most products today are sold in a chain of distribution that
begins with the manufacturer, and sometimes even before, with the
maker of component parts that are supplied to the manufacturer.
The manufacturer sells to an intermediary such as a wholesaler,
distributor, or dealer. There may be more than one such intermedi-
ary before the product finally reaches a retailer, who eventually
sells it to a purchaser. The product may then injure the purchaser,
another user of the product, or a bystander. Early on in the history
of products liability there was very little basis for recovery against
anyone other than the retailer—the “‘immediate’”’ seller of the
product. The right to recover from a “remote’’ seller such as a
wholesaler or manufacturer who sold to the retailer was largely
unknown. The “‘privity of contract’ rule—providing that the plain-
tiff had to have contracted directly with the defendant in order to
sue it—made such recoveries impossible.

The history of products liability, however, is the story of the
progressive creation and addition of causes of action for injuries
caused by defective products. Each new cause of cause of action has
complemented rather than replaced a previous basis for liability.
Consequently, in a very real sense any study of the history and
development of products liability law is at the same time the study
of products liability law as it now stands. That history is comprised

216
PRODUCTS LIABILITY

of four eras: the era of contract privity; the era of negligence; the
era of warranty, in which the courts made the transition from
negligence to a modern regime that combines negligence and strict
liability features; and the modern era of products liability. The
expansion of products liability was most rapid between 1960 and
1985, when the courts implemented a new vision of liability that
reflected a more general transformation of accident law during this
period. Products liability went from being an obscure field doing
individual justice to an active and important field in which the
imposition of liability became what amounted to an instrument of
regulatory and compensation policy. Although any division of an
important field of law into four such simple categories automatical-
ly oversimplifies, this categorization is a useful way to clarify and
organize one’s understanding of the field.

I. The Era of Contract Privity

Prior to the twentieth century there was no general law of
products liability, and certainly no tort law of products liability.
Rather, what liability there was for injuries caused by products
arose within the law of contracts. It was therefore accurate to say
that there was no products liability in the absence of privity of
contract—i.e., unless the person injured was a party to a contract
that was breached. And even if there was privity of contract and
the product sold pursuant to the contract caused injury, there
might not be liability. That depended on what the contract provid-
ed, or was interpreted to provide. And in the nineteenth century
era of caveat emptor—‘‘let the buyer beware’’—the courts were
unlikely to be sympathetic to the injured purchaser whose contract
provided nothing about his rights in the event that he was injured
by the product in question.

The leading case reflecting the privity rule is Winterbottom v.
Wright,! an English decision involving a plaintiff who was injured
by a defective stagecoach that had been supplied to his employer. In
his suit against the maker of the stagecoach, with whom he had no
contract, the plaintiff was denied recovery because of the absence of
privity. Some commentators say that the case has been misinter-
preted and that Winterbottom neither stated nor reflected a general
rule that a product maker was immune from tort liability in the
absence of privity. Be that as it may, Winterbottom certainly came
to stand for such a rule.

To the modern mind the privity requirement seems unfair. It
does not seem sensible to insulate a negligent manufacturer from

1. 10M. & W. 109, 152 Eng.Rep. 402 (1842).

217
TORT LAW

liability to the very people whom its product is most likely to injure
if the product is unsafe, on the ground that there is no contract
between the manufacturer and the victim. Nonetheless, it is useful
to try to imagine what a liability regime based on the privity
limitation could have come to look like over time. The privity
limitation may still be rejected as inappropriate in the modern
context, but the assumptions that lie behind the limitation may not
seem nearly so absurd as the modern view of Winterbottom makes
them appear to be.

Suppose that even today the purchaser injured by a product
had no cause of action in tort against any seller, but was limited to
a contract suit against the party who had sold him the product. It is
nonetheless plausible to suppose that there would have developed a
series of contractual undertakings creating some indirect liability
on the part of remote sellers such as manufacturers. For example,
immediate sellers of certain products probably would find it in their
interest to compete for business by offering to compensate purchas-
ers and members of their families injured by unsafe features of the
products sold. Intermediate sellers such as wholesalers probably
would then find it in their interest to compete for the business of
retailers by offering to reimburse them for some or all of the injury-
liability costs that the retailers had undertaken by contract. In
turn, manufacturers probably would find it in their interest to
compete with each other for the business of wholesalers by offering
to reimburse them for the costs of reimbursing retailers. In this
way the cost of injuries suffered by product purchasers and their
families could ultimately be passed up the chain of distribution.
The cost of providing this protection would be shouldered first by
manufacturers. But in one way or another this cost could be passed
down the chain of distribution, since the price of the product at
each stage would include either the cost of compensation or the cost

of making the product safer so as to avoid the need for compensa-
tion, whichever were less.

It is difficult to say exactly what the scope of these various
contractual undertakings would be in the absence of any tort
liability. Some products might carry no contractual right to com-
pensation; some might carry a right to full compensation on the
model of tort damages regardless of the fault of anyone in the chain
of distribution; and others might come with a more limited right to
compensation—for example, only in the event that the injury
resulted from the manufacturer’s negligence and only for medical
expenses and lost wages resulting from the injury. The difficulty of
predicting the precise contours of a privity-of-contract liability
regime is not a weakness, however, but part of the argument in

218
PRODUCTS LIABILITY

favor of such a regime. The reason it is difficult to predict the
particular liability rule or rules that would have developed is that
different people probably would want to contract for different
packages of product price and safety, and compensation for product-
related injuries. Similarly, different products might come with
different combinations of these features because of differences
between the products. Of course, in an age of mass produced
products not everyone could have her own liability contract custom-
ized with each purchase. But just as today’s purchasers of motor
vehicles are offered the choice between regular and extended war-
ranties covering their vehicles, so there might have developed a
series of different liability packages available at different prices. If
it is plausible to suppose that, even in the absence of tort liability
for product injuries, consumer preferences operating in product
markets could have caused contract-based product liability to devel-
op with at least some of this diversity, then there is also some
plausibility to the argument that the uniform tort-based product
liability law that has actually developed is sub-optimal.

That this argument is plausible, however, does not necessarily
make it correct. First, totally missing from the analysis is any
treatment of product injuries suffered by bystanders. Under mod-
ern tort-based product liability law a pedestrian (for example)
injured by a bus that goes out of control because of defective brakes
has a cause of action against the manufacturer of the bus (and
possibly the manufacturer of the brakes). A contract-based liability
regime could never have developed in a way that would have
adequately protected such bystanders, because by definition a by-
stander has no contract with any party in the chain of product
distribution. Tort law rules would have been required to provide
such bystanders with a cause of action that Winterbottom denied
them. Second, just because a contract-based liability regime of some
sort probably would have developed if Winterbottom had not even-
tually been overruled, it does not follow that such a regime would
have been more suitable than the tort law regime that now pre-
vails. Various imperfections in the product markets might have
generated a sub-optimal body of contract-based product liability
law. For example, product safety information is not always avail-
able to, or understandable by, consumers. And the cost of transac-
tions that would provide consumers liability and compensation
options might limit the range of options that could be made
available. In short, markets that afford consumers choice, and legal
rules that do not afford choice, both tend to be imperfect. The real
question is not which approach could operate with high effective-

219
TORT LAW

ness, but which approach or combination of approaches has the
potential to be less imperfect than the other.

All this has simply been a mental exercise designed to help us
see what might have been. The contract-based approach embodied
in Winterbottom v. Wright was long ago rejected, and the tort-based
approach has been dominant for nearly a century. But even today
the differences between the contract and tort-based approaches are
not entirely academic. At many points in the law of product liability
the preferences of consumers for a particular mix of product price,
safety, and compensation for product-related injuries can help to
inform the choice among possible tort-based rules of liability. For
this reason, although the 19th-century contract privity rule has
been long been dead, the idea behind that approach—consumer
choice—may still aid in the evaluation of modern tort-based rules
governing product liability.

II. The Era of Negligence

As so often happens in the development of the law, almost from
the very moment that the contract privity rule became firmly
established the courts began to create exceptions to it. Perhaps the
most prominent exception was the rule in Thomas v. Winchester,”
which eliminated the privity requirement when the plaintiff’s inju-
ry was caused by an “imminently” or “inherently”? dangerous
product. In such cases the plaintiff could sue the manufacturer of
the product for negligence, despite the absence of privity. In the
beginning the number of products found to be inherently dangerous
was small, and included only such obviously hazardous things as
poison. But slowly the products in this category expanded to
include coffee urns, scaffolds, and bottles of aerated water. For all

practical purposes at this point the exceptions had swallowed up
the rule.

The demise of the privity requirement was not formally recog-
nized, however, until Judge Cardozo’s opinion in MacPherson v.
Buick Motor Co.* in 1916. The defendant there had manufactured
an automobile that was sold by a dealer to the plaintiff, who was
injured when a wheel made of defective wood collapsed. The plain-
tiff sued for negligence, and the defendant relied on the privity rule,
arguing that the rule of Thomas v. Winchester did not apply. The
court rejected the defendant’s argument, holding in effect that the
manufacturer of anything that could foreseeably harm a third party

220
PRODUCTS LIABILITY

if negligently made was subject to liability under Thomas. This
holding of course totally eviscerated the limitations contained in
the Thomas rule and functionally overruled the contract privity
requirement. Many other states followed MacPherson in the years
that followed, although for a while some purported still to require
that a product be imminently dangerous in order to avoid the
privity rule.

Clearly the decision in MacPherson was very significant. But it
is important to see both what MacPherson did and what it did not
do for plaintiffs in product liability actions. By eliminating the
privity requirement the case obviously made it possible for plain-
tiffs to sue manufacturers with whom they had no direct contractu-
al relationship for negligence. This was important not only because
immediate sellers sometimes had few assets. In addition, with the
rise of pre-packaged, mass-produced goods, often the retail seller
was a mere conduit for the transfer of the product. As such, the
retailer had not been negligent in any way. In such cases MacPher-
son did not create the right to sue an additional defendant; in the
typical case MacPherson created the right to sue the only party who
could possibly be found liable for negligence.

Although this was a necessary step for plaintiffs, it was far
from sufficient to make recovery automatic, because the plaintiff
still had to prove negligence. As a result of MacPherson manufac-
turers could be held liable to ultimate purchasers or users of their
products, but only for negligence. Proving negligence was often far
from a simple task. Consider the broken wheel in MacPherson,
which the defendant had purchased from a maker of component
parts. The plaintiff had to show not only that it had been defective,
but that it had been defective when it left the manufacturer’s
possession. The car in MacPherson, for example, had been driven
on rough country roads for a year, and might have been damaged
through heavy use.’ The plaintiff might be able to adduce the
necessary proof of negligence, although that would be difficult if the
wheel was destroyed in the accident that injured him. But unless
the standard to which manufacturers are held is perfection rather
than reasonable care, merely showing that there was something
wrong with the wheel does not prove that the manufacturer was
negligent in placing it on the vehicle. One way to prove negligence
would be to attempt to show that a reasonable manufacturer would
inspect component parts such as wheels, and that the defendant’s
inspection in this case was negligent. That approach could require

Facts While Reshaping the Law, in Robert L. Rabin & Stephen D. Sugarman (ed’s.),

TORT LAW

evidence regarding the defendant’s methods of training inspectors,
inspection standards, the rate at which defects went undetected
given these inspection standards, and so forth. All this might have
been available in discovery, but only at a cost. And even then the
plaintiff had to hope that what he discovered would help to prove
negligence rather than show how careful the defendant had been.

Without such evidence, the defendant could contend, whether
the defendant was negligent in failing to discover the defect in the
wheel of the plaintiff's automobile is speculative, and it would be
improper to submit the case to the jury. In some cases res ipsa
loquitur could solve this problem for the plaintiff. As products and
manufacturing techniques become increasingly complex, however,
typically it becomes less appropriate to invoke res ipsa because of
uncertainty as to whether the type of accident in question does or
does not ordinarily happen because of the defendant’s negligence.
In short, because products are not perfect, sometimes they caused
injuries even in the absence of the manufacturer’s negligence. And
even when the manufacturer was negligent, plaintiffs could not
always prove it. Thus, MacPherson ushered in a new era in prod-
ucts liability, but created new problems for plaintiffs at the same
time that it solved old ones.

Ill. The Era of Transition and the Rise of War-
ranty Rules

At about the same time that the cause of action against
manufacturers for negligence emerged, several other bases of recov-
ery under certain limited circumstances began developing. Each
arises out of the notion of ‘‘warranty.” A warranty is a promise or
guarantee. When a warranty about the safety or quality of a
product is breached, that breach may give rise to a cause of action,
not only for the contract losses flowing from the breach (e.g., the
difference between the value of the product as warranted and the
value as it actually was), but also for such consequential losses as
bodily injury or property damage. During a period that overlapped
with the era of negligence, several causes of action based on breach
of warranty were slowly recognized.

A. Express Warranty

Warranties may be either express or implied. An express war-
ranty is simply that—a promise or guarantee, for the breach of
which liability may ensue. Sometimes the warranty is contractual,
sometimes less formal and part of an advertising campaign. By the

222
PRODUCTS LIABILITY

1930’s some courts began to hold immediate sellers and sometimes
even manufacturers liable for breach of express warranties.’ This
development was not unimportant, especially when liability was
extended to manufacturers. But proving that claims of product
quality amounted to an express warranty was difficult, and this
form of liability was never an important basis for the imposition for
liability for product injuries. Over a period of decades the real
action took place in the field of implied warranties, the forms of
which are discussed next.

B. Liability of the Immediate Seller

The first form of implied-warranty liability arose out of a
provision of the Uniform Sales Act enacted in many states after the
turn of the twentieth century. The Act provided that a warranty of
“merchantability”? was implied in every contract for the sale of
goods. To be merchantable the goods had to be of fair average
quality. If they were not, the seller was liable for bodily injuries
resulting from breach of the warranty regardless of negligence or
its absence. But the liability ran only from the immediate seller,
and typically only to the purchaser and not to other users or
bystanders: And, being a creature of the Sales Acts, the implied
warranty of merchantability was implied but not mandatory. That
is, it was what contract-law theorists today call a ‘‘default”’ rule: an
implied warranty could be disclaimed by contract. Nonetheless,
limited though it was, this was the first instance of strict liability
for injuries caused by product defects.

If one stops and thinks about it, there is nothing at all
extraordinary or even counterfactual about the implied warranty of
merchantability, especially if it is disclaimable. In the case of mass
produced, homogeneous goods, to a very great extent the warranty
of merchantability was implied not only by law but also in fact. The
Sales Acts simply reversed the old common law rule of caveat
emptor—‘‘let the buyer beware’’—under circumstances in which
the reasonable assumption of a buyer would be that what he was
purchasing met minimal standards of quality and safety. The legal
implication simply followed the factual assumptions of the parties.
And because the warranty was implied wherever there was privity,
in the absence of a disclaimer the seller held liable for bodily
injuries itself had a claim for indemnification from its wholesaler
(with whom it was in privity), which in turn had a claim against the
manufacturer. In this way liability ultimately would be shouldered
by the manufacturer, with a consequent incentive created for the

5. See, e.g., Baxter v. Ford Motor Co., 168 Wash. 456, 12 P.2d 409 (1932).

223
TORT LAW

manufacturer to provide an optimal mix of quality, safety, and price
in its products. But the manufacturer was still insulated from the
ultimate user by several layers of litigation.

C. Impure Food: Liability of the Manufacturer

Shortly after the Uniform Sales Act was promulgated and
began to make its way through the state legislatures, a few courts
went one step further. They held that the manufacturer of food
could be held directly liable to the consumer for bodily injuries
resulting from the consumption of impure food, on a theory of
breach of implied warranty.

This was perhaps the greatest conceptual leap that was made
during the period of transition from negligence to strict liability. As
I have just argued, the idea that a contractual sale of a product by
an immediate seller to a purchaser contains an implied warranty of
merchantability is factually and legally unremarkable, though this
approach does reverse the ingrained rule of caveat emptor. The
theory behind the immediate seller’s liability is still largely contrac-
tual, both because it is reasonable to suppose that the warranty is
implied in fact as well as in law, and because this implied warranty
remains disclaimable—i.e., subject to express contractual modifica-
tion.

In contrast, ordinarily there is no contract of sale between a
manufacturer (of food or anything else) and a purchaser. To hold
that there is nonetheless an implied warranty—which some called a
‘jumping’ warranty—running from the manufacturer to the pur-
chaser which, if breached, gives rise to liability, is to create some-
thing out of very little. It is not necessarily wrong to do this; but
what is created has little to do with any contract. The cause of
action for breach of the manufacturer’s implied warranty therefore
much more closely resembles tort than contract. And because the
cause of action requires no showing of negligence, the tort it
resembles is strict liability. The focus is on the product’s quality (its
“‘merchantability’’), not on the manufacturer’s conduct. Admitted-
ly, certain aspects of the cause of action contained residue of the
contractual soil out of which warranty law grew: often a contract
statute of limitations and the notice requirements of contract law
applied, for example. And this form of implied warranty also
remained disclaimable, though the only available place to disclaim
it was in the contract between the retailer and the purchaser. But
the fact remains that the core of the cause of action was largely
indistinguishable from strict liability in tort for injuries caused by
an unmerchantable product.

D. The Fall of the Citadel: Liability of Manufacturers
Generally

The rise of the food manufacturer’s liability for breach of
implied warranty was important conceptually, but for practical
purposes the first half of the twentieth century remained mainly an
era of negligence liability. The key player—the manufacturer of
durable consumer and commercial goods—was liable only for negli-
gence, and only when the plaintiff could prove negligence. Over
time there was a slight erosion of this liability limitation, as some
courts began to apply the implied warranty theory to manufactur-
ers of products that were not food but were intended for intimate
bodily consumption—such as perfume and hair dye. But the argu-
ments for strict liability were growing. Perhaps the most famous
came in a concurrence by Justice Traynor of the Supreme Court of
California in Escola v. Coca Cola Bottling Co. of Fresno,’ in which
he argued that the manufacturer of consumer goods should be
strictly liable in tort for product defects, on three grounds. First,
the manufacturer is better situated to determine whether to make
the product safer. Second, the manufacturer is better able to insure
against the risk of injuries caused by the product. And third, the
victim will necessarily have difficulty gaining access to evidence of,
and proving, negligence, even when there was negligence. These
are, of course, some of the potential benefits of imposing strict
liability that were discussed in Chapter Hight.

But the first real fall of the “‘citadel,’’ as Dean Prosser once
called it, occurred when a manufacturer of an ordinary product was
held liable for breach of an implied warranty of merchantability.
That occurred in 1960 in Henningsen v. Bloomfield Motors, Inc."
The plaintiff there was the injured wife of the purchaser of a new
Plymouth, which mysteriously left the road after its steering failed.
The decision was double-barreled. The court first held that an
implied warranty of merchantability ran not only from the immedi-
ate seller, but also from the manufacturer, even if the product was
not food.

The problem for the plaintiff, however, was that her husband’s
contract of sale contained some fine-print labeled ‘‘warranty”’ that
was actually a disclaimer of liability for bodily injury. The court’s
second move was to invalidate this disclaimer, on grounds that did
not make it entirely clear whether some disclaimers—if clearly

6. 24 Cal.2d 453, 150 P.2d 436 (1944).

225
TORT LAW

labeled and pointed out to the purchaser—would be binding. But
the opinion soon came to be understood to hold that the manufac-
turer’s implied warranty of merchantability could never be dis-
claimed in connection with bodily injury, no matter how clear and
conspicuous the disclaimer. Once this step was taken, there could
no longer be any doubt as to what the cause of action really was. A
cause of action for breach of an implied warranty that cannot be
disclaimed, running from a manufacturer to a party who suffers
injury but is not in privity with the manufacturer, is simply strict
liability in tort masquerading under another name. The transition
from negligence to strict liability was now virtually complete; it
only remained for the courts of other states to follow Henningsen
and to acknowledge what they were really doing.

IV. The Modern Era: “Strict” Liability for Defec-
tive Products

Those acknowledgments followed quickly. The first case to
make what had happened absolutely clear was the Supreme Court
of California’s decision in Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc.,*
in which now Chief Justice Traynor wrote the opinion, holding that
there was strict liability in tort caused by a defective product. After
that the courts were moved very quickly—so quickly, in fact, that
by 1965 the RestaTEMENT (SECOND) oF Torts § 402A, only slightly
ahead of its time, indicated that the majority rule was that any
seller of a product in a “defective condition unreasonably danger-
ous to the user” was strictly liable in tort for bodily injury or
property damage resulting from that defective condition. Soon that
was in fact the law in most states. And nominally it remains the
law today, although a few states still cling to warranty terminology
in holding manufacturers and other sellers strictly liable. The
language of the § 402A was a bit confusing. Could a product be
defective without being unreasonably dangerous, or unreasonably
dangerous without being defective?

Probably not, and the authors of the THirp REsTaTEMENT have
read the subsequent case law and chosen to drop the phrase
“unreasonably dangerous” from their formulation, employing only
the adjective ‘‘defective.”® Some commentators believe that the
authors of § 402A were thinking mainly about what we now call
“manufacturing”? defects—departures of an individual unit from
the manufacturer’s intended design. Others think that the authors

8. 59 Cal.2d 57, 27 Cal.Rptr. 697, 377 P.2d 897 (1963).
9. See ResTaTEMENT (THIRD) oF Torts: Propucts LiaBILiTy, § 1.

226
PRODUCTS LIABILITY

were also thinking of what we now call ‘“‘design’”’ defects, which
afflict every unit that comes off the assembly line. If the authors
were also thinking of design defects, they probably had in mind
wholly substandard products—those whose designs would have
breached the minimal standard of safety that had been captured by
the notion of an implied warranty of merchantability. There cer-
tainly is little evidence that the authors of § 402A consciously
anticipated the litigation over marginal potential design changes
that characterizes much contemporary design defect litigation.

The key to understanding modern products liability is the
recognition that, by the 1970s, the courts and commentators had
actually developed three categories of defect, and that the starting
point for any conceptualization of the field and for any claim of
liability is to identify the category of defect at issue. In fact, the
THIRD RESTATEMENT does not even use the phrase “‘strict liability’ to
describe products liability generally. Rather, the forms of liability
for injuries caused by defective products are set out separately,
using categories that the case law came to employ in the more than
three decades following the adoption of § 402A. These categories—
manufacturing defects, design defects, and warning defects—shape
virtually all current thinking about products liability.”

A. Manufacturing Defects

A product contains a manufacturing defect when, as produced,
it does not conform to the manufacturer’s own design. Sometimes
called a “‘construction”’ defect, a product with a manufacturing
defect is different from others coming off the assembly line. Pre-
sumably the wheels on most of the Buicks made by the defendant
in MacPherson and the steering mechanisms on the most of the
Plymouths made by the defendant in Henningsen did not contain
the defects that made the plaintiffs’ particular cars dangerous. A
manufacturing defect thus results when something goes wrong in
the manufacturing process and a product departs from its intended
design.

Strict liability for injuries caused by manufacturing defects
circumvents the difficulties of proof posed for plaintiffs after Mac-
Pherson made it possible to sue the manufacturer for negligence.
There is no need for the plaintiff to show that the manufacturer
used inadequate materials, failed to conduct a proper inspection, or
otherwise took a risk whose potential costs were greater than its
potential benefits. On the contrary, once the plaintiff shows that

10. See id., § 2.

227
TORT LAW

the product departed from its intended design and that this depar-
ture caused the plaintiff’s injury, the plaintiff has proven a manu-
facturing defect. The manufacturer is then liable even if it has
exercised reasonable care in every aspect of the manufacturing
process.

The arguments in favor of this form of strict liability are the
arguments in favor of strict liability generally. First, many manu-
facturing defects probably are the result of some hard-to-pinpoint
negligence. Strict liability may therefore produce more accurate
results, from the negligence standpoint, than liability for negligence
itself. Second, as between the manufacturer and the victim, the
manufacturer is in the superior position to conduct research or
otherwise discover cost-effective methods of reducing the risk of
harm resulting from manufacturing defects, ordinarily by reducing
the incidence of those defects. And in general the manufacturer
probably is in a better position to spread the cost of the defects that
it is not cost-effective to eliminate.

B. Design Defects

In contrast to a manufacturing defect, which occurs in only a
(usually small) portion of any particular mass-produced product
line, a design defect is one that occurs in an entire product line. For
example, a car model with a gas tank in a place that makes it
vulnerable to explosions in rear-end collisions is designed to have
the gas tank in that position. If the placement of the tank in that
position makes the car defective, that is a design defect that afflicts

every vehicle coming off the assembly line in the condition it was
intended to be.

In the case of alleged manufacturing defects there is a readily
available standard against which to measure whether there was a
defect in the product that injured the plaintiff—departure of the
product from the manufacturer’s own design. But in the case of
design defects that standard obviously is not appropriate, because it
is never breached. Of course, a product design can never be risk-
free. Perfectly safe products are impossible and in any event would
result in products too expensive for most people to purchase.
Consequently, it was never expected that “‘strict’’ products liability
would mean that every injury caused by a product’s design would
be compensable. Knives are made to cut; if I cut myself with a
perfectly good knife the manufacturer is not liable, because the
knife was not defective. The courts have therefore had to develop
standards for use in determining whether a product design is
defective. In effect there has been a search for a middle ground that

228
PRODUCTS LIABILITY

defines defect in a manner that extends beyond negligence but lies
short of liability merely for injuries caused by a product design.
Two such standards occupy the field.

The risk-utility test acknowledges that deciding whether a
design is defective is very much like deciding whether the design is
negligent. This test asks whether the risks posed by the design
outweigh its utility, understood essentially as the product’s bene-
fits. This is little more than a negligence test that focuses on the
product rather than the manufacturer’s conduct, either with or
without a foreseeability requirement, depending on the approach
taken. Over time the courts have tended increasingly to adopt this
now-dominant test, recognizing that design defect liability is not
really strict liability, or at least is a lot less ‘‘strict’’ than manufac-
turing defect liability. A product design is not defective unless its
risks outweigh its utility, whereas that balance does not matter in
manufacturing defect cases. Admittedly, if there is no foreseeability
requirement much of the blameworthiness that inheres in a true
negligence standard is removed, but most courts require foresee-
ability, or at least make lack of foreseeability a defense. In any
event, except in the case of truly unpredictable harms such as rare
long-latency diseases, few products whose risks in retrospect out-
weigh their utility do so in ways that would have been unforesee-
able at the time they were manufactured. So in most design defect
cases the plaintiff can prove the foreseeability of these risks if that
is required. The crux of the issue in design defect cases is how to
compare a product’s risks to its utility.

An alternative, but less favored test measures the safety of the
design against consumer expectations. Under this test, if the design
is not as safe as consumers expect it to be, it is defective. Unfortu-
nately, in many cases this test is either unworkable or circular. If
the consumer expectations test were empirical, then it would re-
quire statistical evidence of consumer expectations to prove design
defect. This is not required and would hardly be practical if it were.
On the other hand, if the consumer expectations test is not rigor-
ously empirical but is instead to be applied through some form of
reasoning by the jury, what is it? The ordinary juror would proba-
bly think that what the typical consumer expects from a design is a
reasonable amount of safety—i.e., all the safety that it is cost-
effective to provide. A motor vehicle is expected to be ‘‘crashwor-
thy,” ie., to be reasonably safe in a collision. But no consumer
expects that if he does not emerge completely uninjured from a
crash, the design of his car is automatically ‘‘defective.” Only

229
TORT LAW

“reasonable” crashworthiness is expected.” Yet that looks curiously
like a negligence test without any of the rigor of the risk-utility
approach. Moreover, some versions of the consumer expectations
test sidestep the cause-in-fact requirement by asking the jury to
determine whether a reasonable consumer would have expected to
be harmed in the manner in which the plaintiff was actually
harmed. Under the risk-utility test, in contrast, proof of cause-in-
fact is a separate element of the plaintiffs action. In any event,
most courts that have adopted the consumer expectations test apply
it only to simple product designs, about which consumers could
reasonably have expectations of safety. Complex designs are subject
to the risk-utility test.

Given the dominance of the risk-utility test, much of the
controversy surrounding design defect liability involves the difficul-
ty of applying the risk-utility test in practice. Two problems are
especially acute. First, in cases involving technical design choices
for complex products such as motor vehicles, the design defect test
in effect asks jurors to engage in a task for which they do not have
the relevant expertise. As in medical malpractice cases, expert
testimony is virtually always necessary to provide the jury with the
basis for making a decision. Yet unlike medical malpractice cases,
in design defect litigation there is no “respectable minority” rule to
guide the jury’s task. It is not enough that a respectable minority of
designers would conclude that the defendant’s design was not
defective. On the contrary, if the risks of the design outweigh its
utility, the design is defective. In effect, the jury is asked to choose

the best design or, as some have put it, the jury is asked to redesign
the product.

Second, any complex product is a combination of many design
choices regarding safety, cost, attractiveness, and functionality. An
entire product design, however, does not cause injury. One feature
of the design does that. If I am injured in a collision because of the
angle and hardness of my steering wheel, the design of my Ford has
not injured me; rather, the design of the steering wheel is responsi-
ble. The focus of the product liability action I bring will therefore
be whether the design of the steering wheel was defective. The
jury’s tendency will be to evaluate the risks and benefits of that
design in isolation from the other elements of the overall design. Of
course the steering wheel could have been made more safely, for a
price. So could many other features of the design. But at some point
what that requires is a Mercedes, not a Ford. Since I purchased a
Ford and not a Mercedes, the real question ought to be how safely a

11. See Volkswagen of America, Inc. v. Young, 272 Md. 201, 321 A.2d 737 (1974).

230
PRODUCTS LIABILITY

Ford must be designed as a whole. But that is the very kind of
question that jurors are not terribly well-suited to answer, even
with the help of experts. Many courts, as well as the THIRD
RESTATEMENT, have addressed this problem by requiring that the
plaintiff prove not only that the risks of a particular design out-
weigh its benefits, but also that there was a reasonable alternative
design that would have reduced the risks in question.” Yet that
requirement asks the jury to make a second design decision for
which it is also not terribly well-suited—whether the alternative
design proposed by the plaintiff is reasonable and feasible. More-
over, when and if there can be liability even when there is no
alternative feasible design, a finding of liability is in effect a finding
that the product should not be sold at all—a dubious decision to
leave to individual juries.

All this is far from ideal. The dilemma posed by these weak-
nesses in design defect liability, however, is that there is no
approach that is obviously superior to the current approach.
Stronger safety regulation by government is one such alternative,
but that does not seem either likely to happen or likely to be
effective. Another alternative is to allow the market to decide how
much safety it wants, on the model of the Winterbottom approach.
Just as there is a market for attractiveness and functionality, there
is a market for safety. Some people want more safety than others
and are willing to pay for it. But the complexity of product designs
and the latency of design dangers make it very difficult for the
ordinary consumer to assess the safety of complex product designs
in anything but a very general way. This is true even in connection
with cars, where shopping based partly on safety considerations is
common. If I want the most safety money can buy, I may choose a
Mercedes. If I want considerable safety but not the most money can
buy, I may choose a Ford or a Chevrolet. Because I can never be
fully informed about design safety, however, my choice will not
necessarily result in Fords or Chevrolets having an overall level of
design safety that is optimal for their purchasers. And in connec-
tion with other products—lawn mowers, chain saws, etc.—it is
unclear how much information about safety the typical consumer
can or does take into account. There is therefore a considerable role
to be played by the threat of liability for design defects, especially
those defects that are latent rather than obvious.

As a consequence, we face a choice between the imperfections
of the regime of tort liability for design defects, the imperfections of
governmental safety regulation, and the imperfections of the model

12. ResTaTeMENT (TuiRD) or Torts: Propucts Liasiiity, § 2(b).

231
TORT LAW

of consumer sovereignty that MacPherson long ago rejected in
overruling Winterbottom. Tort law’s design defect approach now
dominates, but not without considerable dissatisfaction on the part
of many observers of this field.

C. Warning Defects

If it were possible to provide product purchasers with complete
information about product risks and utility, there would be less
need for the other bases for imposing product liability. Complete
risk-utility information could be transmitted and consumers often
could be left to make their own choices about the desirable mix of
safety, price, attractiveness, and functionality in the products they
purchase. But of course that is an impossible ideal, and in any
event there are some product designs that remain defective even
after the consumer has been fully warned about them. For both
reasons, complete consumer choice cannot totally displace mandato-
ry product liability.

Warning law occupies the area in which it is both feasible and
normatively desirable to transfer risk-utility information to the
purchaser and thereby to put the purchaser in a position to decide
for himself whether the risks posed by a product design are worth
its utility. When these criteria are satisfied, the product seller
generally is relieved of liability for harm caused by the risk about
which an adequate warning or instructions were provided. In this
setting the theory underlying liability for the failure to warn is
that, once an adequate warning has been given, the purchaser
rather than the product seller is the superior bearer of the risk of
injury.

The duty to warn users of pharmaceuticals about side effects
illustrates the point. Suppose that I buy a bottle of aspirin warning
me about the risk that a small percentage of the users of aspirin
will develop ulcers as result of prolonged use. Since there are
aspirin substitutes, I can use the aspirin once or twice and then
compare its effectiveness with that of a substitute. I can then make
an informed decision whether to risk the side effects of aspirin. On
the other hand, if the drug in question has no adequate substitutes,
then the provision of a warning at least puts me in a position to
decide whether to risk the drug’s side effects or, instead, to tolerate
the medical condition that causes me to seek treatment. Once I
have the necessary information—or if the drug requires a prescrip-
tion, once a learned intermediary such as my physician has the
information and consults with me about it—then I am in at least as
good a position as the manufacturer of the drug to decide whether

232
PRODUCTS LIABILITY

its risks are worth its utility. The THirp RESTATEMENT and much of
the case law refer to this kind of product as involving an ‘“‘unavoid-
able risk” and decline to impose liability for the injuries that result
after an adequate warning of the risk of these injuries is given.”

Two areas of controversy dominate warning law: the adequacy-
of-warning issue and the connection between warnings and design
defect liability.

1. Adequacy of Warning

If complete risk-utility information could be transmitted in
warnings or instructions, it would be easy to determine whether the
warning or instructions given were sufficient to insulate the manu-
facturer or seller from liability. But of course providing complete
information is never possible. What is required is an ‘‘adequate”’
warning or instruction, typically of foreseeable risks. Warning
liability is therefore not truly “‘strict’’ liability, since adequacy
determinations inevitably take into account the feasibility and cost

of providing a warning, as well as the kind of information that
purchasers want and need.

One problem here is that there are diminishing returns from
providing additional information. The more risks a warning dis-
closes and the more detailed the instructions for safe use that are
given, the less likely the user actually is to digest and heed the
warning or to follow the instructions. The term ‘‘label clutter’ is
often used to describe the problem. Since the adequacy issue
ordinarily is for the jury, however, it is possible for the jury to find
in favor of liability in cases in which fairly low probability risks
were not disclosed, or the particular phraseology used in the
warning is alleged not to have conveyed the nature of the risk in
question with an adequate degree of specificity. In MacDonald v.
Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp.,"“ for example, the warning on birth
control pills manufactured by the defendant referred to the risk of
blood clots that could lodge in the brain and could be fatal, but did
not use the word “stroke.” The plaintiff suffered a stroke, and in
the plaintiff's suit the court held that her contention that the
warning was inadequate raised a jury question. Given the number
of different risks that might be disclosed about any given product,
the issue is somewhat analogous to asking a jury in a design defect
case to decide whether the risks posed by a particular design
feature were worth that feature’s utility, without looking at the
entire product design. A jury may well conclude that the particular

13. See RESTATEMENT (THIRD) oF Torts: Propucts Liapitity, § 6 Comment d.
14. 394 Mass. 131, 475 N.E.2d 65 (1985).

233
TORT LAW

risk that was not disclosed to the plaintiff is the one additional risk
about which there should have been a warning, or a differently
phrased warning. That is an unfortunate effect of the current
approach. But like design defect liability, there does not seem to be
any more suitable alternative approach to dealing with the adequa-
cy-of-warning issue. If there is to be a requirement that an ade-
quate warning be given, at some point we must rely on juries—as
well as on courts granting directed verdicts—to decide when a
warning was or was not adequate.

A second problem is that the plaintiff must prove causation. In
warnings cases this means proving that the plaintiff would not have
used the product, or would not have used it in the way he or she
did, if an adequate warning had been given. The problem is
analogous to proving causation in informed consent cases, as dis-
cussed in Chapter Three. It may be difficult for the plaintiff to
adduce actual evidence of what he or she would have done in the
face of a warning, especially in cases involving highly beneficial
drugs. Some courts, often but by no means only in vaccination
cases, therefore, have created what amounts to a presumption that
the plaintiff (or the plaintiff's parent) would have heeded an
adequate warning if it had been given. I am skeptical of the factual
basis for this “heeding presumption,” both because most people
think that taking drugs their physicians prescribe make sense, and
because certain vaccinations are required for enrollment in school
and participation in organized recreational sports. One of two
things is going on. The courts may be concerned that without the
heeding presumption, few plaintiffs would be able to prove that
they would have read a proper warning and decided not to take the
drug, and that manufacturers would therefore usually escape liabil-
ity. Alternatively, the courts may recognize that in certain settings
most people would have taken the drug even if they had read a
proper warning, but the courts may in effect be creating insurance
protection for the unlucky few people who suffer the side effect in
question, even if they would have taken the drug after being
adequately warned or not. Whether creating insurance through tort
liability is a sensible way to create such insurance is, of course, a
separate question.

2. The Warning/Design Defect Connection

The risks posed by some products outweigh their utility when
there is no warning or instructions, but are outweighed by their
utility when the product does carry an adequate warning or in-
structions. There is no dispute that in such cases there is a duty to
warn, and that if that duty is satisfied there is no liability for a risk

234
PRODUCTS LIABILITY

that is the subject of an adequate warning or instruction. When a
reasonable alternative design can eliminate a product defect, how-
ever, then merely warning about these risks does not insulate the
defendant from liability.

But what about a product that has no reasonable alternative
design and whose risks still might outweigh its benefits after an
otherwise adequate warning or instruction is given? Can such a
product be found to have a design defect, or does the provision of
the warning or instruction insulate the seller from liability? Out-
side the field of prescription drugs, which are subject to the rule
governing ‘“‘unavoidably unsafe” products permitting a warning
alone, the answer is not entirely clear. The ‘“‘patent danger’ rule
that once prevailed in many states implied that an adequate warn-
ing was always sufficient, since this rule provided that when the
defects in a product’s design were obvious (‘‘patent”’ rather than
“atent’’) the manufacturer could not be held liable for injuries that
resulted. Because many risks are even more obvious when a prod-
uct carries an express warning about them than when the risks are
merely visible, it would seem that under the patent danger rule
there should be no design defect liability once an adequate warning
has been given.

But the patent danger rule has been overruled in many juris-
dictions. And a few prominent decisions have implied that a jury
may find that certain products are too dangerous to be on the
market at all, even when their risks are known and understood. For
example, in O’Brien v. Muskin Corp.,"* the court held that it was for
a jury to decide whether an above-ground swimming pool that was
3 and 1/2 feet deep was defectively designed because of the risk of
injury from diving into it, even when the risk was obvious. Yet
above-ground swimming pools inherently pose a risk to those who
dive into them.

It is therefore difficult to see O’Brien as anything other than a
rejection of consumer sovereignty even in the face of adequate
information, although the case was quickly overruled by statute. If
consumers are permitted to choose Buicks lacking rear-seat airbags
without General Motors’ incurring liability for injuries to passen-
gers that would have been prevented by such devices, then why
must the makers of above-ground swimming pools pay for injuries
that result because their pools have obviously shallow depths and
hard bottoms? Nor is the problem solved by saying that the issue is

15. See Micallef v. Miehle Co., 39 N.Y.2d 376, 384 N.Y.S.2d 115, 348 N.E.2d 571
(1976).

235
TORT LAW

one for the jury and that the obviousness of the risk can be taken
into account, since the issue is whether there should ever be
liability under these circumstances. Rather, in this area involving
the intersection between design defect and warnings law, the ten-
sion between consumer sovereignty and the protective goals of tort
law that has been present at least since Winterbottom v. Wright will
not go away. As long as we simultaneously trust and distrust the
consumer, trust and distrust the market for safety, trust and
distrust design defect liability, the law governing liability for inju-
ries caused by obviously dangerous products will be unsettled.

V. Products Liability Defenses

Most of the defenses to products liability actions are the same
defenses available in other negligence and strict liability cases.
Contributory or comparative negligence is always a defense when
the essence of the action is negligence, and in many states is also a
defense even when the action is in essence based on strict liability.
And assumption of risk is typically available as a defense whether
the action is regarded as sounding in negligence or in strict liabili-
ty, although in comparative negligence jurisdictions usually it is not
a complete defense, but is subsumed within comparative negligence.

One defense that is distinctive to products liability, however, is
product misuse. Suppose that I use a garden rake to boost myself
up to a high window sill outside my house, the rake breaks while I
am in midair, and I am injured in the fall. In my suit against the
rake manufacturer for designing a rake too weak to bear my
weight, the manufacturer has a misuse defense, even assuming that
I can prove that the rake was defectively manufactured or designed.
This misuse defense has become complicated, however, by the
development of an exception for injuries caused by a ‘‘foreseeable”’
misuse. The manufacturer remains liable for these misuses. For
instance, if I try to use a kitchen knife as a screwdriver and this use
causes the knife to splinter into shards that put out my eye, it may
be a jury question whether this is a foreseeable misuse. This
exception to the misuse defense can be trumped, however, by the
plaintiff's assumption of risk. That is, if the plaintiff knowingly and
negligently takes the risk entailed by a foreseeable misuse, the
manufacturer is not liable.

Whether all this is described as a matter of available versus
unavailable defenses or as proximate versus remote cause does not
much matter, as long as what is really at stake remains clear. The
question is which party under the circumstances at issue is the best
bearer of the risk of injury, the plaintiff or the defendant, and

236
PRODUCTS LIABILITY

whether that issue should be decided by the court or by juries.
Liability for foreseeable misuses is best shouldered by the manufac-
turer or seller; liability for unforeseeable misuses, and for knowing
and negligently encountered foreseeable misuses, is best shouldered
by the plaintiff.

VI. Disclaimers, Bystanders, and Consumer Sov-
ereignty

In exploring modern products liability law I have tried to
suggest that although it may not be appropriate for consumer
sovereignty to be the dominant principle in the field, consumer
sovereignty might play a greater role than it does. For example, it is
virtually never possible to disclaim liability for injury caused by a
defective product—i.e., to contract out of that liability in advance.
That possibility died after Henningsen, as warranty was displaced
by pure liability in tort as the principal basis of liability. The law in
this field, however, need not be a slave to conceptualism. Why not
permit disclaimers of products liability under circumstances in
which the market for safety appears to be functioning properly?

One of the reasons, I think, is judicial and legislative distrust of
the market’s ability to regulate safely effectively. But of course this
would not necessarily preclude permitting disclaimers when the
market was working effectively. Some products pose one major,
salient, danger. Chain saws, for instance, pose such a risk. Some
potential purchasers are adept and experienced in the use of chain
saws and are therefore willing to bear the risk of cutting off their
fingers in return for a lower price. Others are not. It is certainly
possible to imagine a regime in which all the major risks posed by
chain saws were disclosed, and purchasers then chose between tort
and no-tort options, or between full-compensation and partial-
compensation options, for different prices.

The reason such regimes have not developed, however, is that
the courts probably do not consider themselves to be in a very good
position to decide under what circumstances the market for safety
could and could not function with sufficient effectiveness to war-
rant validating disclaimers of or limitations on tort liability. On this
view the near-blanket prohibition on disclaimers in products liabili-
ty can be seen as a rule fashioned at a very high level of generality.
Although the rule is not perfectly accurate in that there are some
situations in which disclaimers ought to be permitted, the blanket
rule generates considerable savings on transactions costs and yields
acceptable accuracy in the majority of cases. The critical question
would then be whether there may eventually be enough situations

237
TORT LAW

in which permitting disclaimers would be desirable, so that relaxing
the blanket prohibition and fashioning an effective method of
identifying these situations would make sense.

As we saw from the outset in imagining what a modern regime
premised on the Winterbottom rule might look like, however, miss-
ing from this equation is a factor that makes the whole problem
somewhat more complex: the role of bystanders. The argument that
consumer sovereignty should play a greater role in determining the
scope of products liability is premised on the notion that individual
consumers know best for themselves what is the optimal combina-
tion of product safety, price, attractiveness and functionality. But
by definition a bystander is a party who is not in the chain of
product distribution, and therefore has no means of contractually
waiving or otherwise limiting her tort rights by agreement with
potential defendants in return for a better priced or more attractive
product. Even if consumer sovereignty were made dominant and
full disclaimers were permitted, it can hardly be imagined that
bystanders injured by defective products would be left without a
cause of action. Rather, two parallel legal regimes would have to
develop—one for those purchasers whose liabilities were governed
by a contractual disclaimer or limitation of liability, and another for
others, including bystanders. For this reason, manufacturers of
products who effectively disclaimed liability to their purchasers
would still face liability to bystanders. It may be that this would in
fact be the best arrangement—choice for purchasers, automatic tort
protection for bystanders. But perhaps the prospect that moving
toward greater consumer sovereignty could never entirely substi-
tute contract for tort, but instead would result in the development
of two separate products liability regimes, has also served to pre-
clude more serious consideration of this alternative.

Some confirmation of the accuracy of these explanations is
afforded by the state of the law governing liability for “‘commer-
cial” losses resulting from product defects. Such losses occur when
a product defect causes no bodily injury or property damage but
does cause such economic loss as a decline in the value of the
product itself, or lost profits. The courts in such cases generally
hold that the plaintiff's claim is governed not by tort but by
contract law, including the law of sales.” Thus, although the very
sale of the product in question may carry an implied warranty of
merchantability, under the law of sales the disclaimer of such a
warranty is virtually always valid if the disclaimer does not pertain
to liability for bodily injury or property damage.

17. See, e.g., Hast River Steamship Corp. v. Transamerica Delaval Inc., 476 U.S.
858, 106 S.Ct. 2295, 90 L.Ed.2d 865 (1986).

238
PRODUCTS LIABILITY

Why are such disclaimers permitted? The answer is that, when
only commercial—that is, purely economic—losses are at stake, the
factors that discourage the courts from permitting contract law to
govern are absent: distrust of the market is much less pronounced,
people’s safety is not at stake, and there is hardly any threat to
bystanders. Moreover, as in the tort arena, the rule governing the
issue also is set at a very high level of generality, although the rule
is precisely the opposite of the tort law rule. The courts rarely
inquire into the circumstances surrounding the disclaimer of liabili-
ty for pure economic loss. Rather, disclaimers of liability for pure
economic losses are virtually always valid. Given this structure, it is
no surprise that the one area where the courts have had trouble
developing an entirely consistent set of rules is the case in which a

physically-dangerous defect has (luckily) resulted in only economic
loss.

Because this kind of case falls right on the borderline between
contract and tort, the principles of contract and tort law each
exercise sufficient gravitational pull to make the problem difficult
for the courts to resolve, and the rule governing the issue has
remained uncertain.

VII. Federal Preemption

Federal laws regulating product safety or products liability, and
state products liability law, may sometimes conflict. For example, a
federal law might mandate that a product carry a particular warn-
ing, but the plaintiff in a state products liability suit might allege
that the warning was inadequate. When federal and state law are in
fact in conflict, federal law governs, because Article IV of the
United States Constitution, containing the Supremacy Clause, pro-
vides that federal law is the ‘‘supreme law of the land” by which
“the judges in every state shall be bound.” In such a situation
federal law is said to ‘“‘preempt’’ state law. In practice the issue
here is whether, through preemption, the federal law creates a
ceiling on the degree of safety that state products liability law can
require. In the absence of preemption, federal law creates no
ceiling, but only a floor or minimum standard, and products liabili-
ty law can demand more safety than federal law requires.

Preemption, based on a federal statute or regulation, can be
either express or implied. Both bases for preemption depend on
interpretation of the particular federal statute or regulation whose
meaning is at issue. For example, in Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc.,"* the

18. 552 U.S. 312, 128 S.Ct. 999, 169 L.Ed.2d 892 (2008).

239
TORT LAW

Supreme Court upheld a ruling that an express preemption clause
in the federal Medical Device Amendments to the Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act preempted a state products liability claim against a
medical device manufacturer. But in Altria Group, Inc. v. Good,"
the Court held that the Federal Cigarette Labeling Act did not
expressly preempt cigarette smokers’ suit against a tobacco manu-
facturer for misrepresenting that its cigarettes had ‘lowered tar
and nicotine.”

When the argument is that there is implied rather than express
federal preemption, the result tends to depend on whether permit-
ting state claims would be consistent with the purpose of the
applicable federal statutory or regulatory regime, which may be a
less determinate, or at least a more contestable question, than
whether there is express preemption. For example, in PLIVA, Inc.
v. Mensing,” the Court held that federal drug regulations, as
interpreted by the FDA, preempted state laws imposing a duty
upon generic drug manufacturers to change a drug’s label. On the
other hand, perhaps the most important case for our purposes
because of its application to standard products liability duty-to-
warn cases involving brand name prescription drugs is Wyeth v.
Levine.” There the Court held that FDA labeling requirements did
not preempt a state failure-to-warn claim, rejecting the manufac-
turer’s arguments that it could not have modified its warning once
the warning had been approved by the FDA and that a state law
duty to provide a stronger warning would interfere with the pur-
poses of federal drug labeling regulation.

In short, whether a state products liability cause of action is
preempted is a question of federal statutory or regulatory interpre-
tation, and therefore depends on which federal statute or regulation
is being interpreted. Of course, interpretation is not a mechanical
process, especially in cases involving claims of implied preemption.
The substantive issue at stake in preemption cases is how much
national uniformity in product liability standards there should be.
Under preemption, federal law creates a uniform ceiling, and gives
manufacturers a safe harbor that can be occupied by compliance
with the federal standard. Without preemption, manufacturers may
be subject to different state liability standards. Judicial attitudes
toward the value of nationally uniform standards, federal power,
and state products liability law may therefore affect decisions about
implied preemption. But statutory context and factual particulars
are still the place to start in considering preemption issues.

DAMAGES

When lawyers litigate tort cases, their concern is at least as
much with the magnitude of the damages that may be awarded as
with the imposition of liability itself. Awarding damages in tort
cases performs at least three functions: 1) achieving corrective
justice or providing civil recourse by compensating the plaintiff for
losses resulting from the defendant’s tortious act; 2) promoting
deterrence by threatening defendants with liability for the costs
resulting from their tortious acts; and 3) recognizing the social and
individual significance of the plaintiffs loss and confirming the
weight of the defendant’s responsibility for that loss. Consequently,
the law governing damages in tort cases is unavoidably linked with
the purposes underlying the imposition of tort liability itself. With
that linkage in mind, this Chapter examines the basic rules regard-
ing compensatory damage awards; the “‘collateral source’”’ rule,
which affords the plaintiff the right to recover damages even for
benefits that have been paid to the plaintiff from her own sources
of insurance; damages in cases involving “‘wrongful death;’ and
punitive damages.

I. Compensatory Damages

The general rule is that the successful plaintiff is entitled to be
made ‘“‘whole,” by recovering damages to compensate her for the
losses proximately resulting from the defendant’s tortious act or
omission. In a case involving injury to property, those damages are
measured by the loss in value of the property or the cost to repair
(or replace), whichever is less. In addition, the plaintiff may recover
damages for consequential loss, such as diminished profits.

The successful plaintiff in a bodily injury case is entitled to
recover damages for 1) the “‘special,’’ or out-of-pocket, losses proxi-
mately resulting from the defendant’s tortious action and 2) “‘gen-
eral” damages for non-economic losses, often referred to as ‘‘pain
and suffering,” although these include all intangible losses. Out-of-
pocket, or tangible monetary losses, in bodily injury cases typically
consist mainly of health-care expenses and lost earning or lost
earning capacity. In contrast, pain and suffering damages for intan-

241
TORT LAW

gible losses may be awarded to compensate the plaintiff for physical
and emotional suffering, disfigurement, loss of life’s enjoyments,
and other similar losses.

The ordinary rules governing the burden of proving the ele-
ments of the plaintiffs claim apply to proof of damages. The
plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she
has suffered, or will in the future suffer, the losses for which she
claims damages. Interestingly, compensatory damage awards for
bodily injury are not subject to the federal income tax—probably
because only the wage-recovery component of such awards should
be taxed even in theory, and determining the portion of an award
or settlement that was made for wage loss often would be difficult.
Yet juries usually are not instructed that awards are not taxable.

Three significant features of this setup are worth exploring in
more detail: 1) the principle of a single recovery; 2) the absence of
an independent cause of action for inchoate or future loss; and 3)
the function of awards for pain and suffering.

A. The Principle of a Single Recovery: Compensation
for Both Past and Future Loss

Perhaps the most salient feature of the law governing damages
in tort cases is that in the ordinary case the plaintiff gets only a
single recovery, providing compensation not only for past but also
for future losses, if any. Naturally, this principle of a single recov-
ery has both advantages and disadvantages.

1. Advantages

The great advantage of the principle of a single recovery is that
the case does not go on forever. Once there has been a trial and
appeals have concluded, there is legal closure. For the plaintiff in a
bodily injury case, the benefit of closure is that she can get on with
her life, both psychologically and physically. The more injured and
hurting the plaintiff appears to be at trial, the more damages the
jury is likely to award. Under the principle of a single recovery,
once that recovery is obtained, the legal incentive for the plaintiff
to stay sick or injured disappears. The defendant derives enormous
benefits from closure as well. The defendant gets repose that is very
similar to the effect of the running of a statute of limitations. Once
a case has concluded and the defendant has paid the plaintiff, the
defendant’s financial exposure and vulnerability to the plaintiff
have ended. Economic planning can proceed without uncertainty
about whether there will be further liability to the plaintiff in the

242
DAMAGES

future. Finally, for the legal system, the advantage of a single
recovery is the avoidance of multiple judicial proceedings and their
consequent administrative cost.

2. Disadvantages

There can be no doubt, however, that there are disadvantages
to the principle of a single recovery. One is that there is almost
certainly less accuracy in estimating future damages than there
would be if determinations were made periodically as losses were
incurred. Predicting how injured (if at all) the plaintiff will be in
the future, and then calculating the amount of medical expenses,
lost earnings, and pain and suffering that will continue to result
from the plaintiff's injuries is bound to be an exercise in informed
estimation at best. If awards were made periodically as losses were
incurred, surely greater accuracy could be achieved. A second
disadvantage is that the plaintiff must be a good investor or she
will not have the award when she needs it in the future. This need
for investment of awards for future losses is underscored by the
practice of discounting awards to present value.

3. Discounting Awards to Present Value

The principle of a single recovery requires the jury to ‘“‘discount
to present value’? awards made for future losses by awarding less
than the projected dollar amount of those losses. The reason for
this requirement is the ‘‘time’’ value of money that is invested
today for future needs. For example, if the plaintiff is injured today
and will continue for the next ten years to incur medical expenses
and suffer physical pain from that injury, making an accurate
award for her future losses requires two steps. First, the jury must
determine what medical expenses the plaintiff will incur and how
much physical pain she will suffer in each future year, and place a
dollar value on those losses. One way to do this is to assume that
there will be no inflation in the future. Another approach, which
requires even more speculation about what the future will bring, is
to estimate what effect future inflation will have on such items of
loss as medical expenses and wages, and then to take this inflation
into account in predicting the dollar value of the plaintiff's future
losses.

Either way, a second step is required. Because the function of
an award of damages is to compensate the plaintiff for her losses
and no more, an award today of the full amount that the plaintiff
will lose in the future would constitute overcompensation. If invest-
ed today that sum would earn interest or otherwise appreciate in
value. By the time the losses for which the damages intended to

243
TORT LAW

compensate the plaintiff were actually incurred, the plaintiff would
have a sum greater than the amount of those losses. The amount of
a future loss must therefore be discounted to present value—i.e.,
reduced to a sum which, if invested, will equal the amount of the
future loss at the time it occurs.

This is a mathematical exercise which can easily be accom-
plished using ‘“‘present value’ tables. But to use a present-value
table one must determine what “‘discount” rate to use. The dis-
count rate is simply the reverse of an assumption about what rate
of interest the plaintiff's damages award will earn while it is
invested by the plaintiff. If the amount of the award was arrived at
on the supposition that there will be no inflation in the future, then
a “pure” rate of interest (one which ignores the possibility of
inflation) will be used to determine the appropriate discount rate.
But if the award assumed that there would be inflation, then an
inflation-adjusted interest rate will have to be used to determine
the discount rate.

These seeming technicalities have two important implications.
First, unless a jurisdiction has adopted uniform rules regarding the
appropriate discount rate to be employed in determining the pres-
ent value of an award, then any case involving potentially substan-
tial future losses is likely to involve testimony by experts about
future inflation and the appropriate discount rate. This has always
seemed to me to be an unnecessary as well as an unfortunate
exercise, since the result is that different juries will make different
findings about how much inflation there will be in the future or
what the market rate of interest would be in the future if there
were no inflation. Both are highly speculative questions. It would
make a lot more sense to have a uniform discount rate, promulgat-
ed annually by rule of court or otherwise arrived at.

Second, as I noted in discussing the disadvantages of the
principle of a single recovery, for the theory underlying the princi-
ple of a single recovery to work in practice, the plaintiff must be at
least an average investor. The discounting of damage awards to
present value assumes that the portion of a single recovery awarded
for future losses will appreciate over time through investment. If
that appreciation does not occur as assumed by the discount rate
used, then the plaintiff will ultimately find herself without suffi-
cient funds to compensate her for future losses when they are

incurred, and a major purpose of the law of tort damages will not
be served.

244
DAMAGES

B. Inchoate and Future Loss

A corollary of the principle of a single recovery is the rule that
there is no independent cause of action for losses that have not yet
occurred. Once tangible physical loss has taken place, then compen-
sation for all future losses that will more probably than not result
from that loss is also recoverable. But if no physical loss has yet
occurred, the fact that the plaintiff will more probably than not
suffer physical loss in the future ordinarily is not actionable. The
very limited inroad made into this firm limitation has been the
occasional award of the costs of medical monitoring when a defen-
dant has tortiously exposed the plaintiff or a group of plaintiffs to
the risk of suffering future injury such as cancer. Otherwise,
recovery is virtually never permitted today for damages resulting
from even a reasonable fear that one will suffer harm in the future.
Aside from medical monitoring costs, under the principle of a single
recovery, liability for future loss must await the actual occurrence
of present physical injury.

C. Pain and Suffering Awards

1. The Functions of the Award

Awards for pain and suffering perform a number of functions.
First, in the case of serious injuries, few people would think that
providing compensation for out-of-pocket loss alone could ever
make the plaintiff ‘‘whole.”” Money paid for pain and suffering may
not remove that loss, but it does further acknowledge the wrong
done to the plaintiff and the fact that the plaintiff has experienced
intangible losses.’ And the very fact that the plaintiff has received
an award of money compensating for more than out-of-pocket
expenses may provide some “consolation” that is itself a value.
Second, even if the plaintiff's pain and suffering cannot ever be
fully compensated for with money, the plaintiff may be able to use
an award to provide activities or enjoyments that substitute for
those lost as a result of the injury in question. For instance, if the
plaintiff no longer can play soccer because of paralysis, he might
use the money from an award of general damages to purchase a
satellite dish that will bring televised soccer from around the world
into his home, or the plaintiff might use the award to take up an
entirely new hobby.

Third, regardless of whether money can compensate in any way
at all for pain and suffering, there can be little question that pain

TORT LAW

and suffering is one of the consequences with respect to which the
law aims to achieve optimal deterrence when it threatens potential
defendants with tort liability. That is, even if there were no benefit
obtained from paying pain and suffering awards to victims, it would
make sense to hold injurers liable for these damages. From the
standpoint of optimal deterrence it really does not matter whether
the defendant pays these damages to the plaintiff, or to a charitable
foundation instead, or the dollar amount of pain and suffering
damages the defendant is required to pay is placed in a metal
bucket and burned in the courtroom. What matters is that the
defendant has to pay the money. The requirement of payment
assures that other potential injurers are threatened with liability
not only for out-of-pocket loss, but also for pain and suffering. And
this threat promotes optimal deterrence by encouraging potential
defendants to take into account the cost of the pain and suffering
that their activities may cause in deciding what safety precautions
are worth taking.

Admittedly, in certain contexts this deterrence argument is less
persuasive than in others. For example, whenever potential plain-
tiffs are in a direct or indirect contractual relationship with poten-
tial injurers—in fields such as medical malpractice or products
liability—the right to bring a tort action can be understood as
insurance for which potential plaintiffs pay in advance through
increased medical expenses or product costs. Strong arguments
have been made and contested in the literature about whether
rational purchasers of medical services and products would want to
pay for insurance against pain and suffering. If they would not,
some commentators argue, then pain and suffering awards should
not be made at all.? Other commentators have suggested that it is
rational to want to purchase pain and suffering insurance.’ This
issue remains contested. But as long as we have a general law of
damages rather than damages rules applying separately to malprac-
tice and products liability—and as long as tort law is conceived as
more than a mere “insurance”? system—the non-insurance argu-
ments for awarding pain and suffering damages seem highly likely
to prevail.

The last argument in favor of awarding pain and suffering
damages is practical in the extreme. Attorneys representing plain-
tiffs in bodily injury cases virtually always work on a contingent-fee
basis: if the plaintiff loses, she owes the attorney nothing except

cal Synthesis, 97 Yate L.J. 353 (1988).

Accidents: Pain-and-Suffering Damages in Tort Law, 108 Harv. L. Rev. 1785 (1995).

246
DAMAGES

expenses, and sometimes not even that; but if the plaintiff succeeds,
the attorney receives a percentage of the plaintiff's award, some-
times as much as 40 percent. Given the prevalence of this type of
contingent-fee arrangement, even a plaintiff fully compensated by a
jury for her out-of-pocket expenses would receive less than full
compensation after she paid a percentage of this award to her
attorney. Among other things, therefore, the award of damages for
pain and suffering provides the plaintiff a sum out of which to
compensate her attorney. It might be a lot more sensible to treat
the plaintiff's counsel fees as another item of compensable out-of-
pocket expenses rather than using pain and suffering awards as an
under-the-table method of paying counsel fees. But as things now
stand, juries almost universally understand how counsel fees really
are paid and take this into account in making pain and suffering
awards.

2. Limitations on Awards

Notwithstanding these justifications for awarding pain and
suffering damages, it does not necessarily follow that awards of
such damages should always be unlimited. One major criticism
sometimes made of pain and suffering awards is that they can be
too high. Another is that, because assessment of the value of pain
and suffering is so subjective, valuations vary enormously from jury
to jury. Predicting the amount of an award is therefore difficult.
Critics argue that the occasional high award and their general
unpredictability create uncertainty on the part of potential defen-
dants that results in overdeterrence and in the consequent reluc-
tance of certain enterprises, such as pharmaceutical companies, to
develop legally risky product lines at all.

In theory, most of the functions of pain and suffering awards
can be well served even when subject to certain kinds of limits on
what can be awarded for pain and suffering. The traditional ap-
proach to the problem of size and variability in award levels
(whether for pain and suffering alone or for all damages awarded
by a jury) has been to permit courts to restrict awards through the
practice of remittitur. Under this practice, when a jury award is in
excess of what a reasonable jury could award in light of all the
evidence, the trial court affords the plaintiff a choice between a new
trial and acceptance of a specified reduction in the award. A similar
practice known as additur is available when the award is unduly
low. But these are ad hoc approaches that many courts are in any
event reluctant to apply except in the most egregious cases of jury
error.

247
TORT LAW

The problem posed for those who would favor a more systemat-
ic effort to control pain and suffering awards, however, is to develop
standards of limitation that are both fair and workable. It is easy
enough to satisfy one of these criteria at a time, but very hard to
fashion an approach that can satisfy both simultaneously. For
example, about half the states have placed absolute dollar ceilings
on the amount that may be awarded for pain and suffering—
typically in the neighborhood of $250,000. Some of these ceilings
apply across the board, whereas others apply only to particular
types of cases, such as medical malpractice. Ceilings make the
average size of awards much more predictable, since no award can
exceed the ceiling. But ceilings accomplish this aim at the cost of
possible unfairness to the most seriously injured victims—those
whose pain and suffering a jury would value at more than the
ceiling if this were permissible. Disproportionately these are young,
seriously injured victims, since these victims have life expectancies
and injuries that are most likely to involve long-term, severe pain
and suffering. Ceilings therefore exact much of the sacrifice neces-
sary to achieve predictability of pain and suffering awards from
those who are young and seriously injured. Conversely, anyone
whose pain and suffering the jury values at less than the ceiling
makes no sacrifice at all and receives compensation for 100 percent
of his or her pain and suffering.

The alternative would be to exact some sacrifice from all
categories of victim, regardless of how modest their pain and
suffering, through a ‘“‘schedule” of pain and suffering awards.’ This
approach would be more fair than dollar ceilings, but less workable.
To make this approach work, it would be necessary to construct a
schedule of permissible pain and suffering damages calibrated to
the age and severity of injury suffered by each victim: a certain
amount for death at a given age, a certain amount for paralysis at a
given age, a certain amount for loss of an arm at a given age, and so
forth. Then the jury in every case would be required to determine
in what category in the schedule the plaintiffs injuries fell. The
damages awardable by category might be mandatory, or they could
serve merely as guidance for the jury. This approach would be
cumbersome, though it might eventually work effectively. Workers
compensation awards for specified permanent disabilities work in
roughly this way. But certainly the creation of a pain and suffering
damages schedule of this sort cannot be accomplished through
judicial action. Legislative action would be required. This approach,
however, has seemed much less attractive to legislatures than the

248
DAMAGES

enactment of absolute ceilings on pain and suffering recoveries that
ignore the problem of equity among victims. Consequently, many
states still operate with only remittitur and additur to control
damage awards, while others have absolute ceilings on the sums
that can be awarded for pain and suffering.

3. Pain and Suffering for Property Damage?

It is black-letter law that pain and suffering damages are not
recoverable in cases involving property damage. Despite the fact
that I am emotionally attached to a family heirloom that is dam-
aged by the defendant’s negligence, I cannot recover for my result-
ing emotional suffering. I expect, however, that in the years to
come this rule will be tested in a series of especially appealing
cases. Some states have enacted statutes authorizing the recovery
of limited damages for pain and suffering (e.g., $5000) in specified
cases, such as those involving the death of pets as a result of
defective pet food. Other states may well consider creating limited
exceptions to the general rule in the pet food cases. And one can
think of other cases—negligent destruction of wedding photos, for
example—in which creating an exception may have its attractions.
Consequently, the black-letter limitation on recovery of pain and
suffering damages for property damage may well start to give way a
bit as time goes on.

II. Collateral Sources and Benefits

The modern economy is replete with insurance, both private
and public. Plaintiffs are often insured for all or part of their losses,
by health, disability, life, fire, and other forms of insurance. Wheth-
er the payment of collateral benefits such as insurance to the
plaintiff is taken into account in setting damage awards can make a
substantial difference in the amount of an award. The treatment of
the benefits paid to plaintiffs by these and similar sources of
compensation that are collateral to any tort recovery is therefore of
considerable importance in any tort case. The traditional ‘‘collateral
source,” or ‘collateral benefits,’ rule provides that evidence of
payments made or to be made to the plaintiff in the future by
collateral sources such as insurance is not admissible in the plain-
tiffs tort action against the defendant. The result is that the
plaintiff is entitled to prove losses, and to recover damages from the
defendant, that have already been paid by the plaintiff's own
insurer. The arguments for and against this rule are analyzed
below.

249
TORT LAW

A. The ‘Rewarding Prudence” Argument for the Rule

The traditional argument for the collateral source rule is that
the plaintiff who has invested in insurance coverage should not be
penalized for his prudence in doing so. There is something to this
argument, but less than there seems to be at first glance. The
plaintiff who has purchased insurance would not be ‘‘penalized”’ if
insurance benefits were taken into account in setting damages, any
more than a plaintiff who invested in a sprinkler system is ‘‘penal-
ized’’ when his recovery for a negligently-started fire is lower than
it would be if the sprinkler system had not prevented some of the
damage to his property. Rather, the plaintiff's own action has
mitigated the amount of the loss he actually has suffered. After all,
the defendant must suffer the disadvantage of injuring an unusual-
ly vulnerable plaintiff and must ‘‘take his victim as he finds him”
when the victim has a thin skull. Why not also permit the defen-
dant an advantage when he injures an economically ‘‘strong”’
victim—i.e., one who has insurance? If there were a need to avoid
“‘penalizing”’ the plaintiff for his prudence in purchasing insurance,
the way to do that would be to reimburse the plaintiff for the
insurance premium he had spent unnecessarily, rather than permit-
ting him a recovery for a monetary loss he did not suffer.

Moreover, health, disability, life, and fire insurance cover losses
no matter how they are caused, and therefore insure against far
more than losses caused by a third-party’s tortious act. The plain-
tiff in a tort action has received the insurance he paid for—broad
insurance protection against medical expenses, lost wages, or fire
losses, whether tortiously caused or not. Offsetting a damage award
by the amount of benefits paid to the plaintiff by any of these
sources of insurance would therefore ‘“‘deprive” him of only a small
portion of the insurance he had purchased. Finally, vast amounts of
insurance covering potential victims is not purchased voluntarily
through individual prudence, but is provided automatically as a
fringe benefit of employment or by government entitlement pro-
grams such as veteran’s benefits or Medicaid. It is much harder to
see how the “reward for prudence” argument has any bearing on
whether the plaintiff should get the benefit of payments made by
this very large category of collateral sources.

250
DAMAGES

B. The ‘Preventing Double Recovery’ Argument
against the Rule

One of the most common arguments made against the collater-
al source rule is that it permits the plaintiff to recover twice—once
from his insurer and then a second time from the defendant. Such
duplication of payment, the argument goes, violates the principle
underlying all of damages law—that compensation should as nearly
as possible make the plaintiff whole, but that the plaintiff should
not obtain a net financial gain as a result of a tort recovery. Like
the “reward for prudence” argument in favor of the collateral
source rule, this argument against the rule also is less strong than
it first appears to be. First, the desirability of promoting deterrence
supports the collateral source rule. The expenses incurred as a
result of the plaintiff's injury are real costs even if they are
incurred, for example, by his health insurer rather than by the
plaintiff himself. If the collateral source rule did not permit recov-
ery of these expenses, then defendants would no longer be threat-
ened with liability for them, and deterrence would be sub-optimal.
So there is a tension between the desirability of avoiding overcom-
pensation and the desirability of optimally deterring potential injur-
ers. The_collateral source rule resolves that tension in favor of
optimal deterrence, even if this means occasional overcompensa-
tion.

A second reason that the double recovery argument is less
strong than it may appear to be involves the contingent-fee system.
Since the plaintiff must pay his attorney out of his award, even if
the collateral source rule did permit ‘“‘gross’’ overcompensation,
probably it does not often result in “‘net’’ overcompensation after
payment of a percentage of the total award to the plaintiff's
attorney. This may not be the most sensible way to help to assure
the plaintiff a means of paying counsel fees, but because the
collateral source rule is already in place, the contingent-fee system
that has grown up around it should influence the decision whether
to retain the rule.

C. The Subrogation Solution

Both the prudence and double recovery arguments regarding
the collateral source rule presuppose that the plaintiff keeps what-
ever “‘excess” payment results from the rule. Proponents of the
rule therefore attempt to justify double recovery and opponents
attack double recovery. But in fact the double-recovery issue is
largely, though not entirely, a red herring. There is a third alterna-

251
TORT LAW

tive that much more accurately describes what actually happens in
practice: The plaintiff gets a judgment that includes a double
recovery of that portion of his losses that are already insured, but
then reimburses his insurance company out of the judgment, for
the amount of the benefits paid by the company. Under this
approach, which is applied to all forms of insurance except life
insurance,’ both of the purposes of the law of damages are achieved.
The plaintiff is fully compensated (setting aside his obligation to
pay his own attorney out of his recovery) but not overcompensated,
yet the defendant is held liable for the full amount of the costs
resulting from his tortious act.

This all takes place through the legal device known as ‘‘subro-
gation.”” Subrogation occurs under the terms of the insurance
contract between the plaintiff and his insurer. Except for life
insurance, virtually all insurance policies contain clauses giving the
insurer rights of subrogation. The insurer with a right of subroga-
tion steps into the shoes of the plaintiff (is ‘subrogated to’’ the
plaintiff's rights) to the extent of payment made by the insurer to
the plaintiff. Thus, whatever rights the plaintiff has against the
defendant the plaintiff’s insurer also has, though only to the extent
of the insurer’s payments to the plaintiff. The plaintiff's insurer
therefore has the right to sue the defendant for negligence and to
recover the amount of payments the insurer has made to the
plaintiff. But this suit is usually unnecessary, since the plaintiff is
already suing the defendant. So the insurer’s rights of subrogation
are translated into a right to be reimbursed (in insurance language,
““indemnified”’) for the amount of its prior payments to the plaintiff
out of the plaintiff’s tort recovery. And by virtue of the collateral
source rule, that tort recovery will be for all the losses incurred as
result of the defendant’s act, including those paid by the insurer.
After reimbursing the insurer, the plaintiff keeps what he lost, the
insurer receives what it had paid, and the defendant ends up paying
the full amount of the losses he caused.

The fact that subrogation is available in this way certainly
adds strength to the case for retaining the collateral source rule.
However, subrogation reimbursements paid to plaintiffs’ insurance
companies do not always occur. One reason is that it may take con-
siderable effort to secure such reimbursement. Insurance benefits
typically are paid long before any tort recovery is obtained. For
example, a health insurer normally pays hospitals and physicians

5. An exception is made for life insurance, which is never subject to subrogation
or reimbursement and therefore may be involved in “duplicate” recovery, for
reasons analyzed in Kenneth 8S. Abraham, Tue Liapiuity Century: INSURANCE AND TorT
Law FROM THE PRoGRESSIVE Era To 9/11 207-11 (2008).

252
DAMAGES

treating injuries within months of billing. But the patient may not
obtain a tort recovery or settlement until years later. To secure re-
imbursement out of that subsequent tort recovery, the insurer
must first have identified the subset of its many thousands of claim
payments that are potentially reimbursable—i.e., those in which
the patient’s injury may have been caused by tortious action. The
insurer must then determine whether the plaintiff later brought
suit to recover these losses from a third party. Next the insurer
must either file a lien that will result in automatic reimbursement
in the few situations where this is permitted, or monitor the course
of the plaintiff/insured’s tort suit. Finally, the insurer must make
known to the parties to the suit its putative right to reimburse-
ment and then seek to vindicate that right before a judgment or
settlement is paid, or at least before the plaintiff disburses or
sequesters the award. Making this effort is likely to be worthwhile
for insurers only in cases involving payment of very substantial
health or disability insurance benefits.

A second reason that subrogation reimbursements are less
than systematic results from the fact that most tort payments are
the product of settlements, not judgments. Almost by definition,
settlements are for less than the full amount of the plaintiff's
damages. As a consequence, the portion of any settlement that
should be paid to an insurer in reimbursement of already-paid
benefits is contestable. Paying the insurer the full amount of these
prior payments off the top of any settlement would deprive the
plaintiff of compensation; yet computing what fraction of prior
payments should be reimbursed requires some formula that would
specify the portion of the plaintiffs’ total losses that the amount
paid in settlement constituted. For example, if we knew that the
plaintiff's total losses were $100,000 and he settled for $60,000,
then the settlement would be for 60 percent of his losses. It would
therefore make sense to reimburse the plaintiffs health insurer for
60 percent of its prior benefit payments. But this $100,000 valua-
tion of the plaintiffs total losses is not available when there has
been a settlement: litigating the total amount of the plaintiffs
losses is precisely what the settlement was designed to avoid. So
there is a dilemma about how to divide the settlement. In some
states fairly firm rules have emerged to guide the division of
settlements in order resolve this dilemma. But in many states the
rules are underdeveloped and the entire process is more a matter of
lore than law. The result is unsystematic reimbursement of collat-
eral sources. Thus, whereas in theory subrogation reimbursement
can prevent double recovery by the plaintiff even while the defen-
dant pays the full amount of the losses it caused, in practice

253
TORT LAW

sometimes such reimbursement of past payments occurs and some-
times it does not.

As to future payments of insurance benefits the issue is even
more cloudy. Suppose that the plaintiff secures a large judgment
under a general verdict for both past and future losses, and then
reimburses his health insurer in full for prior payments. But then
the plaintiff continues to incur medical expenses resulting from his
earlier, tortiously-caused injuries, and these expenses are covered
by his health insurance. Presumably part of the judgment has
compensated him for these losses. In theory his insurer health
insurer should not have to pay these medical expenses or should
pay and then be simultaneously reimbursed for them by the in-
sured. But in practice the insurance often does pay, because ordi-
narily the plaintiff has secured a general verdict that does not
indicate what sum has been paid for future medical expenses. The
result is a double recovery of these expenses. The special exception
is Medicare, which by statute takes the position that it may not pay
when a tort judgment or settlement has been for future medical
expenses that it would otherwise cover. In short, as to both past
and future benefits paid by collateral sources, the collateral source
rule achieves only mixed success at simultaneously securing the
proper level of compensation for plaintiffs while optimally deterring
potential defendants.

As a result of pressure from defendants’ interest groups, over
the past few decades a number of state legislatures have reexam-
ined the collateral source rule. Finding the rule unsatisfactory, over
a dozen have enacted statutes that either partially or completely
eliminate the rule. The operation of these statutes varies. Some
direct that there be a reduction in the plaintiff's award equal to
collateral benefits paid in the past or payable to the plaintiff in the
future; others merely make evidence of such payments admissible.
Some make exceptions in cases in which the insurer paying prior
benefits to the plaintiff has a right of subrogation—thus acknowl-
edging that in some sense the purpose of the statutes is to prevent
double recovery only when that is a real threat. But other statutes
draw no such distinction and apply more generally.

The great problem that is faced in implementing these statutes
arises in cases involving substantial future losses. To be faithful to
the purpose behind the statutes, the plaintiff's recovery of damages
for future losses should be reduced by the amount of the collateral
benefits that more probably than not will be paid to the plaintiff in
the future. But determining the amount of such future benefit
payments to the plaintiff requires predicting what sources of insur-
ance, public and private, the plaintiff will have in the future,

254
DAMAGES

sometimes the distant future. The more serious and long-term the
plaintiff's injuries are, the more speculative the entire exercise is
likely to be, and the less likely it is that there will be any
substantial offset of future losses by the amount of estimated
future collateral benefits.

Ill, Damages in Wrongful Death, Survival and
Consortium Actions

At common law a plaintiff's cause of action died with him. But
in the nineteenth century, statutes enacted in both England and
the United States altered this rule. In virtually all states, therefore,
the law governing recovery in death cases is in the first instance a
creature of statute, though with an overlay of many decades of
common law interpretation and elaboration. There are two general
classes of statutes, with variations within each. By far the most
important are wrongful death statutes, which create a new cause of
action on the part of those who survive the decedent. In contrast,
survival statutes preserve the deceased’s cause of action. Some
states have enacted only a wrongful death statute, some have
enacted only a survival statute, and some have enacted both.

A. Wrongful Death Actions

Typically a wrongful death statute provides that upon the
death of an individual caused by the wrongful act of another, the
person or entity “that would have been liable had death not
ensued”’ continues to be liable. Although this phrasing implies that
the statute preserves the decedent’s cause of action, in fact that is
not exactly what happens. Statutory treatment of three issues
makes this clear: who are the beneficiaries of a wrongful death
action; what damages are recoverable by these beneficiaries; and
what defenses to this action are available.

1. Beneficiaries

Wrongful death statutes provide that recovery is for the benefit
of designated individuals. Typically these are the ‘“‘heirs at law’’ of
the decedent—those who would, by the terms of another statute,
inherit his estate if he died “intestate,” that is, without a Will.
These other statutes—known as statutes of ‘‘descent and distribu-
tion’’—direct, for example, that the estate of an intestate go to a
surviving spouse, or half to the spouse and half to surviving
children, or if there is no surviving spouse in equal shares to
surviving children, and so forth. The exact terms of the statutes of

255
TORT LAW

descent and distribution vary from state to state. But whatever the
terms of these statutes of descent and distribution, under wrongful
death statutes the statutorily designated “heirs at law’ are the
beneficiaries of the wrongful death cause of action, even if the
decedent did have a Will leaving his estate to others.

2. The Measure of Damages

A beneficiary’s recovery is measured by the losses she suffers
as a result of the decedent’s death. In the past these were limited to
out-of-pocket, economic losses that would have been paid by the
decedent in support of the beneficiary, and there were often statu-
tory ceilings on the dollar amount that could be recovered in a
wrongful death action. Both these limitations are a thing of the
past in most states. Damages for both economic and emotional loss
are recoverable, usually in unlimited amounts. Thus, if the benefi-
ciaries are the parents of a deceased ten year old their recovery is
likely to be substantial, whereas when the beneficiary is an adult
child of an aged parent the recovery will probably be much smaller.
Regardless, the principle that what is recovered is measured by the
beneficiary’s losses makes clear that, for all practical purposes, the
cause of action is the beneficiary’s and not the decedent’s.

3. Defenses

Because a cause of action exists only if the deceased would have
had one had death not ensued, the defendant can invoke any
defense it would have had against the decedent. But most courts
also hold that defenses that would be available against the benefi-
ciary in an ordinary action also are available in wrongful death
action. Thus, if the decedent was negligent then the beneficiaries’
recovery is reduced in accord with the applicable comparative
negligence statute. But even if the deceased was not negligent, if a
beneficiary was negligent, then the contributory or comparative
negligence of the beneficiary is available as a defense to that
beneficiary’s action. Once again, this setup makes it clear that for
most practical purposes, even if not for all, the cause of action is
the beneficiary’s.

B. Survival Actions

All states have enacted statutes that preserve a cause of action
for losses suffered by a decedent before he died. Thus, if before he
died the decedent incurred medical expenses or experienced pain
and suffering as a result of the defendant’s tort, by statute damages
for these losses are recoverable in an action by his estate, and pass

256
DAMAGES

through his estate to those entitled to inherit it. These are one form
of “survival” statute.

A number of states have gone further, however, and have
provided by statute for a cause of action to recover economic losses
that are incurred as a result of the decedent’s death. Typically the
measure of these losses is the amount that would have been in the
decedent’s estate had he or she lived a full life expectancy. To make
this computation a jury must predict the decedent’s gross future
earnings, and then subtract all payments and expenditures that he
would have made in his lifetime, including support that he would
have provided to his family, but also any money he would have
spent on himself or non-family members. This cause of action is for
the benefit of the decedent’s estate and any recovery passes
through the estate, to whomever is entitled to inherit. Entirely
depending on the decedent’s Will if he has one, this may be a
surviving spouse, children, or anyone else. In the absence of a Will,
this recovery will pass with the rest of his estate to his heirs at law
under the applicable statute of descent and distribution.

C. Loss of Consortium

The phrase loss of consortium refers to the deprivation of the
benefits of a family relationship because of tortious conduct that
causes injury but not death. At common law a husband had a cause
of action for loss of consortium against a tortfeasor who injured his
wife, for both economic and non-economic loss. Many decades ago
this common law discrimination against women was remedied by
giving wives the same cause of action for injuries to their husbands.
A minority of states has extended the cause of action to parents
whose children are injured, and/or to children whose parent or
parents are injured.

D. The Underdeterrence Problem

Any state that has enacted only a wrongful death, only a
survival statute, or has limited rights of recovery for loss of consor-
tium, has a potential underdeterrence problem, at least in theory,
because of the under-compensation that these approaches entail.
For example, a wrongful death statute imposes liability only for
losses suffered by those who survive and suffer losses resulting
from the decedent’s death; there is no liability imposed for sums
that would have been in the decedent’s estate when he died a
natural death. Conversely, a survival statute imposes liability only
for sums that would have been in the decedent’s estate when he

257
TORT LAW

died a natural death; there is no liability for losses suffered by
those who survive a decedent. Some states, partly for this reason
and partly out of solicitude for survivors, have enacted both types

of statutes.

Notice, however, that even states that have enacted both types
of statutes still face a potential deterrence gap, though a smaller
one. Even both statutes together impose liability on the defendant
only for the losses of the decedent’s heirs at law and for what would
have remained in the decedent’s estate had he lived a full life
expectancy. Neither statute imposes liability for the losses of any
other person for whom the defendant would have provided support,
or for the sums the decedent would have earned and spent on
himself during his lifetime. Partly for this reason, the grotesque
adage that a defendant is better off killing than badly maiming a
victim tends to remain true, even in states that have enacted both
types of statutes. Since dangerous behavior is just as likely to result
in serious injury as in death, however, this apparent gap in the
amount of deterrence created by the law governing recovery of
damages in death cases may be more theoretical than real. None-
theless, it is worth noting that despite all the apparent concern of
modern tort theory with deterrence in personal injury cases, the
law governing the damages that are recoverable in the most serious
of all such cases—those involving death—is at least theoretically
flawed as a means of deterring wrongful conduct.

IV. Punitive Damages

In exceptional cases the plaintiff is entitled not only to recover
compensatory damages, but also to an award of damages designed
to punish the defendant. These are known as “‘punitive’’ or ‘‘exem-
plary’’ damages. Punitive damages are awarded in only a small
percentage of all cases, but the threat that they may be awarded
probably has more impact than the small percentage of awards
reflects.

The states vary in their descriptions of the behavior that
warrants an award of punitive damages, but almost always behav-
ior more blameworthy even than gross negligence is often neces-
sary. In addition to punishment, punitive damages often are said to
be designed to deter extremely blameworthy behavior. Presumably
the defendant who has acted with something approaching knowl-
edge that his behavior was highly likely to cause harm has been
insufficiently deterred by the threat of liability for compensatory
damages. This might be because the defendant knows that potential
plaintiffs face difficulty in proving causation and therefore does not

258
DAMAGES

expect them to sue, because the defendant wishes to harm the
plaintiff and is willing to pay compensatory damages to be able to
do so, or simply because the defendant has been paying insufficient
attention to the threat of liability for compensatory damages. The
threat of liability for punitive damages in such cases puts a thumb
on the scale, so to speak, in an effort to alter the defendant’s cost-
benefit calculations and get his attention.

The controversy over the size and unpredictability of pain and
suffering awards has been paralleled in recent years by criticism of
punitive damage awards on the same ground. In an effort to
respond to this criticism, a number of the state statutes that have
placed ceilings on awards of pain and suffering damages apply to
punitive damages as well. In addition, over the past two decades the
U.S. Supreme Court has reviewed punitive damages awards in a
variety of cases in response to defendants’ claims that excessive
awards violate the Constitutional requirement of due process of
law. In a series of decisions the Court has articulated three factors
to be used in evaluating the constitutionality of a punitive damages
award: 1) the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant’s conduct;
2) the disparity or proportion between the harm or potential harm
resulting from the defendant’s conduct and the amount of compen-
satory damages awarded; and 3) the difference between this remedy
and the civil or criminal penalties authorized to punish defendants
in comparable cases.® The first and third factors are something of a
matter of judgment. But in State Farm Insurance Company v.
Campbell,’ the Court quantified the second factor, holding that few
awards in which there was more than a single-digit ratio between
punitive and compensatory damages would satisfy due process.
Thus, punitive damages awards that are more than nine times
greater than compensatory damages are, in effect, presumptively
unconstitutional. Whether and to what extent this test will limit
punitive damages awards in cases where the defendant’s act was
highly reprehensible and subject to substantial criminal penalties,
but resulted in comparatively little loss to the plaintiff, remains to
be seen.

AFFIRMATIVE AND LIMITED DUTIES

According to the textbooks, including this one, the four ele-
ments of a cause of action in tort are duty, breach of duty, damages
and causation. The “duty” this statement contemplates is the
obligation to take some action or to refrain from taking some
action. Without such an obligation, or ‘‘duty,’’ there could never be
tort liability. Duty is a question of law; it is for the court, not the
jury, to decide whether there is or is not a duty. Juries, in contrast,
decide whether there has been a breach of duty when a duty exists.
In many instances, however, asking separately whether the defen-
dant was under a duty, although logically required, is for practical
purposes unnecessary. In the ordinary negligence case involving
conduct by the defendant that risks foreseeable physical harm to
the plaintiff or his property, the defendant is alleged to have had
and to have breached the duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid
injuring the plaintiff. Asking whether the defendant had a duty to
the plaintiff and whether that duty was breached is therefore just
another way of asking whether the defendant was negligent, and
whether that negligence was a proximate cause of the plaintiff's
harm.

In such cases, analyzing the problem in terms of duty adds
nothing, and could lead to the mistaken conclusion that even after
the negligence and proximate cause questions have been answered,
there is still no liability unless the defendant owed the plaintiff a
duty independent of the obligation to exercise reasonable care not
to risk foreseeable physical injury to the plaintiff. In the ordinary
case this conclusion is mistaken, because the defendant’s negligence
is precisely the breach of duty that is alleged. In such cases “‘duty”’
is a largely question-begging concept that can be safely used only if
one is not misled by it. Moreover, in most strict liability cases use of
duty language to describe what is going on would be peculiar. We
would not say that actors are under a duty not to engage in
abnormally dangerous activities. On the contrary, the whole point
of this form of liability is that engaging in such activities is
acceptable but that they must pay their own way. The essential
“‘duty’’ in such cases is simply to compensate those who are injured
by the activity.

260
AFFIRMATIVE AND LIMITED DUTIES

There are important classes of cases, however, in which the
existence or non-existence of a duty on the part of the defendant to
take or refrain from taking some action is precisely the issue. Here
use of duty language is not tautological or redundant, but absolute-
ly essential. These are the classes of cases addressed in this Chap-
ter. Situating these cases within a conceptual framework is not
easy, because the duty issue arises in a variety of contexts and is
influenced by a variety of factors.

Most conceptual frameworks in this area begin with the dis-
tinction between affirmative and limited duties. The first set of
cases involves possible affirmative duty. Here the defendant’s con-
duct does not negligently create a risk of physical harm to the
plaintiff. Therefore the defendant has not breached any duty in this
respect. As is sometimes said, the defendant is not guilty of ‘‘mis-
feasance.”’ But the plaintiff is independently at risk of suffering
physical harm and the defendant might, through the exercise
reasonable care, eliminate or reduce this risk of harm to the
plaintiff. The question is whether the defendant has an affirmative
duty to do so—whether the defendant is liable for ‘‘nonfeasance.”’
Tort law’s default rule is that in general there are no such affirma-
tive duties, but there are exceptions to this rule. All the cases in the
affirmative duty category are, in a sense, about the duty to rescue.
But the term rescue tends to be reserved for cases involving
emergency. The remainder of the cases involve the question wheth-
er there is an affirmative duty to exercise reasonable care to protect
the plaintiff from the risk of physical harm or to reduce that risk
even when there is no imminent emergency. These typically involve
special relationships between plaintiff and defendant, or subse-
quent wrongdoing by a third party that the defendant might have
prevented. This Chapter addresses the cases in these categories and
the policies underlying the extension of, and limits on, affirmative
duty.

In the second set of cases the defendant’s conduct foreseeably
creates an unreasonable risk of harming the plaintiff. The defen-
dant has committed misfeasance rather than mere nonfeasance.
But in several categories of cases negligence law places limits on
the duty to exercise reasonable care not to risk such harm. These
are cases of limited duty. These include premises liability involving
the manner in which a landowner maintained his property, “‘pure”’
emotional harm, and “‘pure’”’ economic harm. These are cases in
which, as a matter of law, there is no liability or only limited
liability for negligently causing harm. In these cases there is no
duty or only a limited duty, so to speak, not to be negligent. As with
affirmative duty, this Chapter addresses the cases in these catego-

261
TORT LAW

ries, examining the situations in which there is and is not a duty to
exercise reasonable care, and the policies underlying these limits.

It is natural to seek some general formula to use in predicting
when the courts hold, or will hold, that there is an affirmative duty,
or that there are limits on duty, or that there is no duty. But there
is no such formula, at least not one that is operationally useful. The
best that can be done is to provide a list of factors that the courts
tend to take into account, but whose weight may vary enormously
in a particular context. These include (1) the foreseeability of harm;
(2) the closeness of the connection between the defendant’s conduct
and the harm suffered by the plaintiff; (3) the moral blame at-
tached to the defendant’s conduct; (4) the extent of the burden on
the defendant and the consequences for the community if a duty is
imposed; (5) the policy of preventing future harm; and (6) the
availability and prevalence of insurance that is or would be avail-
able if a duty is imposed.’

The main lesson of this Chapter, however, goes beyond these
particulars. The lesson is that there is no general duty not to be
negligent, no general duty to exercise reasonable care. There are
only particular duties to exercise reasonable care, and however
broad some of these duties are, there must always be a duty before
the question of negligence—breach of duty—arises.

I. Rescue

The traditional rule, still almost universally in force, is that in
the absence of special circumstances or a special relationship, one
person has no affirmative duty to rescue another person from a
position of danger, either by action or by warning. The distinction
here is between the defendant who negligently created a risk of
harm (misfeasance) and the defendant who did not remove a risk of
harm created by someone or something else (nonfeasance). Tort law
classically has been willing to impose liability for misfeasance,
whether through act or omission, but not for nonfeasance. This rule
holds even if the cost or risk to the defendant of rescuing the
plaintiff is small or non-existent, and the danger to the plaintiff is
great. I have no duty to rescue a drowning person, even if I need
not enter the water to do so, but could easily throw him a life
preserver or extend a nearby pole to help him.

It is easy enough to explain the principle underlying this rule,
though often it is very hard to stomach the rule itself. As a matter

1. See W. Page Keeton et al., ProssrR AND KEETON ON THE Law oF Torts, § 358 (5th
ed. 1984) (‘‘ ‘Duty’ is simply an expression of the sum total of those considerations of
policy which lead the law to say that a particular plaintiff is entitled to protection.’’).

262
AFFIRMATIVE AND LIMITED DUTIES

of principle, the common law cares enough about individual liberty
that typically it does not ask people to do more than mind their
own business. If I have done nothing to put someone in a position
of danger, I have no duty to rescue him from that position. And as a
practical matter, it would not be easy to develop rules about who
would be liable when more than one individual could have accom-
plished a rescue but no one did. These considerations have led the
law of torts to bite the bullet, so to speak, and to continue to
decline to impose a duty to rescue even in the pure one-person to
one-person rescue situation in which there would be no question as
to which party might have accomplished a rescue. The courts seem
to see tort law’s adherence to this no-duty stance in one-person to
one-person cases as a defense against stepping onto a slippery slope
of permitting liability for the failure to rescue that would be
imposed under a reasonable behavior under-all-the-circumstances
standard. Thus, although permitting recovery in the one-to-one,
low-cost, low-risk rescue kind of case alone would be very appeal-

ing, they abide by the bright-line no-duty rule that has long been
drawn.

Importantly, this is a rule that there is no ‘‘affirmative’’ duty
to rescue, not a rule that there is never a duty to rescue. Sometimes
a defendant who does have a duty to exercise reasonable care can
best do so by rescuing. For example, a defendant who has negligent-
ly placed the plaintiff in a position of danger may be held liable for
negligently failing to rescue him from that danger. Here the distinc-
tion is drawn between mere failure to rescue the plaintiff—nonfea-
sance—for which liability ordinarily is not imposed, and negligently
placing the plaintiff in danger to begin with—misfeasance—which
may give rise to liability for negligent failure to rescue. Further,
even when I am under no duty to rescue, if I decide to undertake a
rescue nevertheless, I am liable for conducting the rescue itself
negligently. Having waived my right to be left alone by attempting
a rescue, and possibly having prevented rescue by others, my
liberty is not unduly infringed by the rule that I have a duty to
rescue carefully if I rescue at all.

Finally, under certain circumstances one who non-negligently
creates a danger to another person may have a duty to warn the
other person of that danger, and perhaps even to undertake a more
active rescue. In Montgomery v. National Convoy & Trucking
Company,” for instance, the defendant’s truck stalled on an icy
highway. This was not the result of any negligence by the defen-
dant. A hill then prevented the plaintiff from seeing the stalled

2. 1865.C. 167, 195 S.E. 247 (1938).

263
TORT LAW

truck until it was too late, and the plaintiff collided with the truck.
The defendant was held liable for injury to the plaintiff resulting
from the negligent failure to warn approaching drivers of the
danger created by the stalled truck on the other side of the hill.

Exactly how to distinguish cases like this from those in which
there is no duty to rescue is unclear. It is true that the defendant in
Montgomery was guilty of more than nonfeasance, since its opera-
tion of the truck affirmatively created the danger to the plaintiff.
But because this was non-negligent operation, it was what might be
called “‘feasance’’ rather than misfeasance. Morally it can be argued
that the defendant is no more blameworthy, and no more waived or
surrendered its liberty to be left alone merely by non-negligently
driving, than the potential rescuer who simply happens along and
encounters the plaintiff in a position of danger that the potential
rescuer did not create. Holding that non-negligently creating a
danger supports the imposition of a duty to rescue, whereas non-
negligently merely happening to be present when a rescue could be
made does not, requires the fact that there was commission of a
non-negligent act to do a lot of work, especially since modern law
has been skeptical of the distinction between commission and
omission.

Nonetheless, the fact that there are a number of cases like
Montgomery suggests the willingness of the courts to impose a duty
to rescue when they can find what they believe to be a principled
basis for doing so. One such principle may be that there is a duty to
rescue when one’s activity non-negligently creates a risk ‘‘charac-
teristic’ of the activity. It is a characteristic risk of driving, for
example, that one’s vehicle may break down. If this were under-
stood to mean not only that this sort of thing can happen, but that
the risk of its happening is substantially increased by engaging in
the activity, then the principle may be consistent with the protec-
tion of liberty at the heart of the no-duty-to-rescue rule. If I mind
my own business, I have no such duty. But once I engage in an
activity that substantially raises the level of risk to which others
are subjected, even if non-negligently, arguably I am no longer
minding my own business in the sense that the no-duty rule
contemplates.

II. Special Relationships

There is an exception to the general rule that there is no
affirmative duty to rescue or to protect the plaintiff from harm
more generally, when the plaintiff and defendant are in a ‘“‘special
relationship.”” Common carriers and innkeepers traditionally had

264
AFFIRMATIVE AND LIMITED DUTIES

such a relationship with their customers. Parents and those who
fall into the category of custodians, such as child-care professionals
and probably babysitters, also fall into this category. The idea
behind this rule seems to be that, by entering into a special
relationship, which ordinarily involves dependence by the plaintiff
on the defendant, the defendant has waived its right to mind its
own business and has undertaken a duty to protect the plaintiff
from harm, the risk of which the defendant did not create.

At the outer reaches of this rationale are the cases in which
mental health professionals such as psychiatrists have been held to
have a duty to warn persons endangered by their patients after the
patient has communicated to the psychiatrist an intention to cause
harm to the third person. The seminal case on the issue is Tarasoff
v. Regents of University of California.* Tarasoff has come in for
much criticism, not only for the obvious reason that the psychia-
trist there (and in most similar cases) had no relationship whatso-
ever with the victim, but also because the threat of liability in such
cases forces the therapist to choose between his professional obli-
gation to keep his patients’ confidences and the legally-created duty
to the third party. The defendant in Tarasoff did have a special
relationship with his patient, but it is hard to see how that can be
the basis of a duty to the third party, at least if dependence is the
basis of the duty to the third party, who had no relationship at all
with the defendant.

But the rule in Tarasoff appears to be otherwise limited. The
rule is applied only when a patient has expressed an intention to
injure a third party. And it is applied only to cases involving a
specifically identified person whose safety is at risk. The duty could,
of course, extend further. There is nothing about the concept of a
duty in these circumstances that requires it to be so limited. But
the courts are cautious about its reach. The duty, in short, is
carefully and narrowly circumscribed.

Ill. Other Affirmative Duties and Policy-Based
Limits on Them

An entirely different but analogous category of liability in-
volves landlords, universities, shopping centers and other such
proprietors of property, which have sometimes been held liable in
negligence for harm foreseeably suffered by tenants, students, or
customers because of the misconduct of third parties. This is a

3. 17 Cal.3d 425, 131 Cal.Rptr. 14, 551 P.2d 334 (1976).

265
TORT LAW

subset of what have been called ‘‘enabling torts.’"* The classic case
on this issue is Kline v. 1500 Massachusetts Avenue Apartment
Corp.,° in which the defendant landlord was held liable in negli-
gence for injuries suffered by a tenant who was assaulted in the
hallway of the defendant’s apartment house. The defendant was
alleged to have been negligent in failing to properly maintain locks
on the exterior doors of the building, and the court held that the
defendant had a duty to the plaintiff to exercise reasonable care to
protect the tenant from assault by a third party.

It is not entirely clear whether cases such as this properly are
understood as involving affirmative duty. In these cases the defen-
dants did not negligently create the risk of harm to the plaintiff—in
Kline, for example, that risk was created by the third party who
committed the assault. But the defendants in Kline and similar
cases engaged in activities without which the particular risks in
question would not have arisen. If the defendant in Kline had not
operated an apartment house, the risk in question would not have
existed. This issue seems not to have expressly arisen in the cases,
however. The courts struggle with the question whether the defen-
dants owed the plaintiffs a duty in such cases, but they do not seem
to be troubled by the fact that this could be characterized as an
affirmative duty and that the defendant is being asked, in effect, to
rescue a plaintiff with whom it has an ordinary relationship.
Instead, some courts and commentators think of these as special
relationship cases, in which (as noted above) a duty to rescue is well
established, and others as cases involving premises liability (see
Section IV below) to invitees, where a duty is also not controversial.

In these cases several factors usually are present when the
courts hold that the property owner or proprietor has a duty to the
victim of a third party who commits a tort on the premises. First,
although it may not be a “special” relationship involving depen-
dence, there is a pre-existing relationship of some sort between the
plaintiff and the defendant proprietor. The relationship may arise
out of contract or through an invitation, express or implied, that
the plaintiff be on the property. Second, there are circumstances
that put the defendant proprietor on notice of the risk of harm to
the plaintiff from third parties. There may have been assaults in
the hallways in the past, broken locks reported to the landlord, or
similar circumstances. If these prerequisites are met, then the
defendant may have a ‘“‘duty”’ to the plaintiff. Then the question is
whether the defendant breached that duty: whether the risk was

5. 439 F.2d 477 (D.C.Cir.1970).

266
AFFIRMATIVE AND LIMITED DUTIES

sufficiently probable, the potential harm sufficiently great, and the
cost of reducing that risk sufficiently small, to render the defendant
negligent for having enabled the third party to injure the plaintiff
by failing to take precautions that would have avoided the harm.
These precautions may involve installing better locks, providing
emergency telephones, using better lighting, etc. Third, the defen-
dants in these cases are strategically placed to take precautions
reducing the risk that third parties will injure victims in the
plaintiff's position. Finally, the primary wrongdoer is likely to be
judgment proof or at least have limited assets, whereas the en-
abling defendant is likely to have a deep, or at least a deeper,
pocket, or to be covered by substantial amounts of liability insur-
ance.

But these factors certainly are not always determinative. There
is also a series of decisions in which the courts have placed limits
on the scope of a defendant’s duty, despite the obvious foreseeabil-
ity of harm, seemingly for reasons of policy that sometimes resem-
ble those that operate in proximate cause. For example, a manufac-
turer of firearms has no duty to the victim of a shooting even when
the manufacturer knowingly permits distribution of the firearms
under circumstances that promote their illegal sale to third parties
who are likely to misuse them.® Virtually all courts rule that a
social host is not liable in tort for serving alcohol to an obviously
drunk guest, even when the host knows that the guest intends to
drive shortly thereafter. The social host is said to have no duty to
the victim of the guest’s subsequent negligent driving. And an
electric utility has no duty to the tenant of an apartment building
when the tenant is injured in the dark because of the allegedly
negligent failure of the utility to provide the building electricity.’ In
short, the evolution of negligence law from the pre-19th century
world described in Chapter Three, in which there were few duties,
to a pure world in which there is a general duty not to negligently
risk foreseeable physical harm, has not completely occurred and
probably never will.

IV. Premises Liability

We now turn to cases in which the defendant has created a risk
of harm to the plaintiff. These involve limited duty, or no duty, to
exercise reasonable care to avoid harming the plaintiff. Our first

267
TORT LAW

example of limited duty involves the liability of the owners or
occupiers of property for injuries suffered by those who have
entered the property. Any statement of the traditional common law
rules governing premises liability must begin with the tripartite
classification of entrants onto the land of others: invitees, licensees,
and trespassers. Owners and occupiers of land (simply called ‘‘own-
ers” hereafter) owe a duty to exercise reasonable care to those
whom they invite onto their property. Such invitees include anyone
on the property for business purposes, i.e., for the benefit of the
owner. Somewhat surprisingly, not everyone who is “invited” qual-
ifies as an invitee to whom a duty of reasonable care is owed.
Rather, in most states people who are social guests, though of
course they have been invited onto the property, are classified as
“licensees.” Owners and occupiers owe such licensees a lesser duty
of care. The courts say that for a licensee the owner must make the
premises as safe as he makes them for himself. What this boils
down to is that the owner must warn the licensee of hidden
dangerous conditions, but need not eliminate these conditions.
Finally, to trespassers—those who enter property without express
or implied permission—the owner owes only a duty to refrain from
wantonly and wilfully injuring them, e.g., by setting hidden traps
that will injure trespassers.

Over time some exceptions to these rules developed. For in-
stance, in many states owners owe “discovered trespassers’’ reason-
able care. And the doctrine of ‘‘attractive nuisance”’ has created a
qualified but well-recognized exception for actually foreseen (as
opposed to merely foreseeable) child trespassers who trespass be-
cause of some particularly ‘attractive’? dangerous condition main-
tained by the owner, such as a railroad turntable or ferris wheel,
especially when the danger the condition poses can be eliminated at
a comparatively low cost. To these children the owner owes a duty
of reasonable care. But these are limited exceptions to what are
otherwise fairly rigid, categorical rules.

Notice the effect of this rigidness. The traditional rules govern-
ing the duties of owners and the correlative rights of entrants are
established at a high level of generality. Whenever it is clear which
category an entry falls into—and often that will not be in dispute—
the scope of the duty owed to that entrant is also clear. This makes
for comparatively high predictability of outcome and comparatively
low adjudication costs. This efficiency is tolerable, indeed desirable,
as long as the tripartite set of duties to the different entrants onto
land reflects widespread agreement about the proper rights of these
entrants and the proper obligations of owners. Under such circum-
stances commonly-held norms and the rigid categories coincide. But

268
AFFIRMATIVE AND LIMITED DUTIES

as that social and moral consensus breaks down, then rules about
these rights and duties set at a high level of generality are seen
often to produce inaccurate or undesirable outcomes.

Until a little more than thirty years ago, the tripartite categori-
zation of entrants onto land, and the distinctions among duties
owed to them, remained largely intact. But then some courts began
to find this categorization unacceptable. The first and still one of
the most far-reaching decisions was the Supreme Court of Califor-
nia’s wholesale rejection of the categories in Rowland v. Christian?
In place of the categories, the court determined that a series of
factors should be taken into account in determining the scope of the
defendant’s duty, including the foreseeability of harm, the closeness
of the connection between the defendant’s conduct and the plain-
tiff's harm, and the moral blame attached to the plaintiff's conduct.
The court reasoned that because there is not necessarily a connec-
tion between these and other relevant factors and the classifica-
tions of trespasser, licensee, and invitee, the classifications should
be rejected in favor of a reasonable-conduct-under-all-the-circum-
stances test. The entrant’s status could still be taken into account
in applying this test, but that status could no longer be determina-
tive. In the decades that have followed, about half the states
changed their rules. Nine followed Rowland, completely abolishing
the categories and the bright-line limitations of duty that go with
them. An additional fifteen declined to abolish the separate treat-
ment of trespassers, but did abolish the distinction between invitees
and licenses. Thus twenty-four states have engaged in substantial
reform.

But a wholesale revolution has not occurred. About half the
states still adhere to the traditional approach entirely, and over
forty still adhere to the trespasser category. The main reason, I
think, is not that the courts in half the states still consider the old
categories to be entirely satisfactory. On the contrary, I believe that
most courts understand the inaccuracy and unfairness that can
result in occasional cases from rigid reliance on the categories.
These flaws can be mitigated to some extent, though certainly not
entirely eliminated, by flexible application of the exceptions to the
categories that already exist, such as the duty of reasonable care
owed to discovered trespassers and the attractive nuisance doctrine.
But most courts also seem to have recognized that an across the
board, total shift to a duty of reasonable care under all the
circumstances would make results in premises liability cases much
less certain. The amount of care expected would vary radically from

8. 69 Cal.2d 108, 70 Cal.Rptr. 97, 443 P.2d 561 (1968).

269
TORT LAW

jury to jury, and prediction of outcomes would be much more
difficult. These courts have chosen not to incur these consequences.

The ideal solution might well be a set of rules at an ‘“‘interme-
diate” level of generality that are less rigid than the tripartite
categorization, but still draw sufficiently bright lines to render
duties clear and outcomes reasonably predictable. The Tuirp Re-
STATEMENT attempts to develop such an approach, though it has
little basis in existing law, by distinguishing between ‘‘flagrant”’
trespassers (e.g., burglars) and “non-flagrant’’ trespassers (e.g.,
someone who enters a well-marked construction area in a shopping
mall in order to find a bathroom). To the former only limited duty
is owned, but the latter are subject to an ‘“‘under all the circum-
stances” standard.’ The RESTATEMENT thus attempts to capture the
moral disapproval of certain forms of trespassing that inhered in
the traditional rule, while accommodating modern attitudes to less
blameworthy trespassing. It remains to be seen whether any courts
will adopt this approach.

But apart from this, no such intermediate approach seems
available. So most courts still take the bright-line approach to
trespassers. And for half the courts, the bright-line approach has
seemed suitable across the board. As a consequence, the courts
have had to choose between retaining the tripartite categorization
largely intact, and rejecting classification, at least for licensees.
Since neither approach is wholly satisfactory, it is no surprise that
the states differ as to the proper choice, and that the law is now
divided in this field between the states that still wholly accept the
traditional approach and those that do not.

V. Negligently Inflicted Emotional Distress:
“Pure” Emotional Loss

There is only a limited duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid
causing emotional distress. To understand what is and is not at
stake here, remember that there is a separate cause of action for
intentional infliction of emotional distress (see Chapter Two), and
that the right to recover damages for emotional distress that results
from negligently-caused physical injury—which tort law terms
“pain and suffering’’—is of course well-established (see Chapter
Ten). In contrast, the issue here is whether there is a cause of
action for negligently inflicted emotional distress (NIED) that is not
the result of negligently-caused physical injury suffered by the
plaintiff. This is sometimes called ‘“‘pure’’ emotional loss or distress.

9. ResTATEMENT (THIRD) OF Torts: PHysicaL AND EMOTIONAL Harm § 52.

270
AFFIRMATIVE AND LIMITED DUTIES

There are two general categories of cases in which such liabili-
ty might be imposed. The first involves what might be called an
independent duty. In this category are the instances in which the
failure to exercise reasonable care (whatever that might mean in
this context) simply causes another person emotional distress. The
second category involves derivative duty. In this category are the
instances in which the failure to exercise reasonable care to avoid
causing physical injury does not result in physical injury to the
plaintiff, but does result in emotional distress, either because the
person whose physical safety was risked by the defendant suffers
emotional distress, or some third party suffers such distress.

Note that there is often real suffering resulting in real losses in
these cases, but that not all such losses result in liability. If
deterrence of negligence or doing justice between the parties were
the only things at stake, the argument for imposing broader liabili-
ty would be stronger. But other matters are at stake, as we will see.

A. Independent Duty

Liability in negligence is only rarely imposed for independently
causing another person emotional distress. For example, I might
negligently forget that a close relative of yours has just died a
painful death, but nonetheless pose a gruesome hypothetical that I
ask you to address in torts class. This upsets you. Liability could
only be imposed in this situation if there were some sort of
freestanding duty to exercise reasonable care not to cause others
emotional distress, or some specific duty applicable to classrooms.
But there is neither. In general there is no independent duty to
exercise reasonable care to avoid causing another person emotional
distress. The two rather circumscribed traditional exceptions are
for emotional loss suffered when the defendant negligently mishan-
dles the corpse of a loved one, and for emotional loss suffered when
the defendant negligently sends a telegram to the plaintiff that
incorrectly announces the death of a loved one.

There has been very little expansion in the independent duty
category. The major addition to the set of exceptions extends the
inaccurate telegram exception (which is essentially empty after the
disappearance of telegrams) to a limited number of other situations
in which the defendant negligently conveys important information,
such as the case of the physician who misinforms the plaintiff, and
in rare cases the spouse of the plaintiff, that he has a sexually
transmitted disease. And it is possible that where the defendant is
in a position of power or authority over the plaintiff such a duty
also exists—as in the case of a hospital with custody of a newborn

271
TORT LAW

infant that allows it to be kidnaped. But beyond these very limited
cases, there is no independent duty to exercise reasonable care not
to cause others emotional distress.

The reasons given for this general no-duty rule when it was
articulated over a century ago were that there was too great an
opportunity for fraud in the typical case in which a plaintiff claimed
that he or she was frightened or upset by the defendant, and that
in any event the ‘‘floodgates’’ of litigation would be opened if a
cause of action for negligently-caused pure emotional loss were
recognized. These are not exactly unpersuasive reasons, but some-
how they don’t seem completely convincing. After all, juries often
assess the credibility of allegations of emotional suffering when
they have to without our being overly concerned about fraud, and
the modern view of law is that courts exist in order to enforce
rights that are worth acknowledging.

Another possible reason for the general no-duty rule, not often
recognized, is that imposing liability for negligently inflicting emo-
tional distress would require the development of standards of
reasonable care that do not now exist except in a vague way. There
are accepted standards of reasonable care in connection with physi-
cal risk—how to drive, shovel snow on a sidewalk, manufacture a
product, practice medicine. But to continue the hypothetical from
above, we do not have accepted standards regarding the amount of
care teachers should use to remember their students’ personal
problems. These standards could be developed, in jury trials, over
time, but they do not exist ‘‘out there” in the world in a condition
that would make them automatically available, as a matter of
common knowledge, to apply in negligence cases.

But I think that the fundamental reason for the very limited
duties that have been recognized in this field—and this includes not
only independent duty, but the derivative duties discussed in the
following Section—is that remedying NIED in tort suits is just
beyond what we want the law to devote its limited energies and
resources to. This is not just a “‘floodgates’’ of litigation argument,
though it is partly that. In addition, for practical purposes there is a
limited amount of money, however large it may seem, that we are
willing to devote to compensating the victims of tortious conduct.
The rules governing NIED seem to imply that we are better off
devoting that finite sum of money to compensation of those who
suffer physical injury than diluting our efforts with a general cause
of action for NIED.

AFFIRMATIVE AND LIMITED DUTIES

B. Derivative Duty: Emotional Distress Resulting from
Fear of Injury to Oneself or Another

There is a separate and substantial set of cases in which the
defendant negligently risks physically injuring someone, and the
question is whether the defendant has a duty to that person, or to
another person, for emotional distress that results from their
awareness of the danger of physical injury. These cases are deriva-
tive in the sense that the precondition for considering whether
there is a duty not to cause emotional distress is that the defendant
have a duty not to risk causing physical injury. This negligence is
the basis for considering whether the defendant also has a duty not
to risk causing emotional distress.

Interestingly, many of the older cases stating the scope and
limits on recovery involved women who suffered emotional loss
because of fear for the personal safety of their husbands or chil-
dren. It is hard to know whether this is because women were
thought to be more prone to suffer these kinds of losses than men,
women were more likely to be exposed to the risk of seeing their
children placed in danger because they were more often with their
children, women were simply more prone to bring suit for emotion-
al loss due to the greater sympathy they expected to receive from
juries, or there is some other explanation for the seemingly dispro-
portionate number of female plaintiffs in these cases. In any event,
many commentators understandably have viewed this early body of
law as being anti-feminist, since the rules long placed significant
limits on the right to recover for pure emotional loss.’” On the other
hand, it might be argued that over time this body of law relaxed the
limits on liability precisely in order to benefit the women who were
so typically the plaintiffs in emotional loss cases. Certainly the law
today is very different from what it was a century ago, and that
change has been for the benefit of the many female plaintiffs in
these cases.

The original rule was that there is no duty to exercise reason-
able care not to cause emotional distress—no cause of action for
pure emotional loss of any sort. This is of course a rule set at a very
high level of generality. As I noted earlier, the stated basis for this
limitation in the early cases was concern about fraudulent claims
and about encouraging large numbers of claims. These concerns
gave way little by little, but as we will see, the concerns have
nonetheless motivated the courts to fashion rules that take the

10. See, e.g., Martha Chamallas with Linda A. Kerber, Women, Mothers, and the
Law of Fright: A History, 88 Micu. L. Rev. 814 (1990).

273
TORT LAW

concerns into account, even as the courts have recognized, and then
expanded, the cause of action for NIED. There has thus been an
expansionist tendency, limited not only by these instrumental con-
cerns, but also by the kinds of normative considerations I men-
tioned above, since in a sense every dollar spent to compensate
emotional loss is a dollar that might not be available to compensate
physical injury.”

1. The Impact Rule

The first major qualification of the general no-duty rule was
the impact rule, which permitted recovery in negligence for pure
emotional loss only if the defendant’s conduct resulted in some
physical impact on the plaintiff's body. Some especially cautious
courts required that the emotional loss resulting from the impact
also manifest itself in physical symptoms (e.g., nausea, inability to
sleep, stomach trouble, etc.). But there was no requirement that the
plaintiff be physically injured by this impact. This rule is a pretty
crude way of distinguishing the claims that are likely to be valid
from those that are not, as well as limiting the number of cases
that may be brought. But that is precisely what the rule was
designed to do. The impact rule was anything but a “‘reasonable-
under-all-the-circumstances”’ test. Either there was an impact and
a cause of action was permitted, or there was no impact and no
cause of action.

The impact rule could generate very arbitrary results. If you
lose control of a car going at a speed of ninety miles per hour and
almost collide with my two year-old son on the sidewalk, neither I
nor my son have a cause of action, no matter how much fright and
emotional suffering we experience, no matter how long that suffer-
ing persists. But if you carelessly back out of your driveway and
brush me at two miles per hour, then there has been impact and I
can sue for my emotional suffering. How much I will recover
depends on how much suffering I can prove, and I may not be able
to prove that I suffered much, but the law recognizes the possibility
in the latter case only. One of the funniest opinions in the history
of tort law, Justice Mussmano’s concurrence in Bosley v. Andrews,”
pokes fun at this all-or-nothing feature of the impact rule.

2. The Zone of Danger Rule

Over time the courts became increasingly dissatisfied with the
arbitrariness of the impact rule and replaced it with a zone of
danger rule. But just as the complete bar to recovery was replaced

11. See Robert L. Rabin, Emotional Distress in Tort Law: Themes of Constraint,
44 Wake Forest L. Rev. 1149 (2009).

12. 393 Pa. 161, 142 A.2d 263 (1958).

274
AFFIRMATIVE AND LIMITED DUTIES

with the impact rule permitting some recoveries even while rigidly
excluding other claims, so the impact rule was replaced with a rule
that was also couched at an intermediate level of generality, albeit
one that permitted more recovery. Under the zone of danger rule
the plaintiff could recover for NIED even if there was no impact, if
the plaintiff was in the ‘“‘zone’”’ in which physical injury was
threatened, and feared for his or her own safety. A number of
courts adopting the rule also required that the resulting emotional
loss manifest itself in physical symptoms as well. On the other
hand, over time some courts relaxed the zone of danger rule a bit,
permitting recovery by those in the zone of danger even when their
emotional loss resulted partly from fear that another person in the
zone (such as one’s small child) would be physically injured.

Like the impact rule, the zone of danger rule attempts to
reduce the risk of both fraudulent claims and an excessive number
of claims, by identifying a limited class of cases in which it is
plausible that there will be emotional loss even in the absence of
physical injury to the plaintiff. Having to adjudicate any claim by a
plaintiff within the zone of danger was something the courts were
willing to do under the new rule, in order to circumvent the
arbitrariness of the impact rule. By the same token, undoubtedly
the courts adopting the zone of danger rule recognized that there
would be cases in which a plaintiff who was outside the zone of
danger nonetheless suffered emotional loss. But denying recovery
in those admittedly “‘legitimate’’ cases was the price these courts
were willing to pay in order to avoid the prospect of being forced to
adjudicate an unlimited number of potentially plausible claims.

3. The Dillon Rule

Then the same sort of thing happened again. Like so many of
the cases that had preceded it, Dillon v. Legg" involved a claim by a
mother who had witnessed her daughter’s injury. In Dillon the
Supreme Court of California, which in the years between about
1960 and 1985 was a leader in the expansion of tort liability
generally, discarded the zone of danger rule. The court held that
the plaintiff in an NIED case need not have been in the zone of
danger and therefore need not have feared for her own safety in
order to recover for her emotional loss. But like the rule it replaced,
the new rule did not employ an “‘under all the circumstances’’ test.
Rather, the court indicated that three factors would have to be
taken into account in deciding whether the claim was one that
warranted recovery—presumably not only in jury deliberations, but
also in the judicial determination of whether a claim could even go
to the jury.

13. 68 Cal.2d 728, 69 Cal.Rptr. 72, 441 P.2d 912 (1968).

275
TORT LAW

The three factors were proximity, visibility, and relationship.
The court indicated that the closer the plaintiff was to the accident,
the more visible the accident was to the plaintiff, and the closer the
relationship between the plaintiff and the party within the zone of
danger, the greater the foreseeability of emotional harm to the
plaintiff and the stronger the argument was for recovery of the
plaintiff's emotional loss. It would have been possible for these
factors to evolve into mere guidelines surrounding what would
amount to an ‘under all the circumstances” test. But that is not
what has happened. The courts that have adopted a Dillon test—
and many have not, preferring to retain the zone of danger ap-
proach—have been adamant about drawing bright lines between
the kinds of cases that do and do not warrant recovery. Thus, in
Thing v. La Chusa," the plaintiff was a mother whose child had
been injured in an automobile accident. She was told of the acci-
dent, rushed to the scene, and saw the child lying on the ground,
bloody and unconscious, believing him to be dead. The Supreme
Court of California held that there could be no recovery, choosing
instead a “bright line’ rule requiring that the plaintiff actually be
present and witness the accident. For most other courts as well,
merely hearing but not seeing an accident typically is insufficient;
and a close friend or lover is apparently not in a close enough
relationship with the plaintiff to warrant recovery even when the
plaintiff witnesses the injury.

In summary, over a period of almost a century there has been a
progressive relaxation of the rule that there can be no recovery in
negligence for pure emotional loss. But at each stage of that
relaxation, one bright-line rule after another was substituted for its
predecessor. This evolution contrasts with what happened, for
example, in the field of premises liability. There, as we saw above,
the courts never were able to identify satisfactory bright-line alter-
natives to the traditional approach based on the status of entrants
onto land. But in the field of pure emotional loss, the courts
fashioned a series of such “intermediate” rules that permitted
more recovery than in the past and were serviceable for decades at
a time, but were couched at a level of generality that prevented
their degenerating into an “under all the circumstances” approach
to liability.

4. Fear of Future Injury

In a different category of cases, the defendant has negligently
exposed the plaintiff to the risk of suffering future injury, such as

14, 48 Cal.3d 644, 257 Cal.Rptr. 865, 771 P.2d 814 (1989).

276
AFFIRMATIVE AND LIMITED DUTIES

cancer. Some courts permit the plaintiff, under limited circum-
stances, to recover damages resulting from fearing future injury. In
most of these cases there is actual impact between a force set in
motion by the defendant, such as asbestos fibers or contaminated
drinking water, thus satisfying the impact requirement that used to
be applied in derivative cases. In others there is no actual impact,
but exposure to x-rays or a similar source of energy. This is
something like impact. In virtually all the cases the defendant
would be, or at least could be, held liable for the actual injury that
the plaintiff fears will occur in the future, when and if it occurs. So
in a sense these cases also are derivative of the defendant’s duty to
exercise reasonable care not to risk causing the plaintiff physical
injury.”

But many courts simply do not permit recovery for fear of
future injury. Formally this stance is not entirely consistent with
the NIED cases just discussed, since these cases permit recovery for
fear of injury that might have, but did not, occur. Both sets of cases
involve emotional distress, yet fear that occurred in the past is
more actionable than present fear about the future. One basis for
the distinction is likely the general concern that adjudication about
the future, even if it is directed at present fears about the future, is
inherently speculative. Allegations of past fear about imminent
injury may seem more easy to assess than allegations of present
fear about the more distant future. The old but continuing concerns
about fraudulent claims thus seem operative here. In addition,
many potential cases involving fear of future injury arise out of
mass exposure, and therefore implicate concerns about preserving
scarce dollars for the priority of compensating for actual physical
injury, when and if it does occur, that I discussed above. The result
may be a reluctance of courts before whom the physical injury cases
are being litigated to recognize a duty regarding fear of future
injury, because that might consume resources that would otherwise
be available for the physical injury claimants.

VI. ‘Pure’? Economic Loss

The last example of a limited duty involves cases of negligently-
caused economic harm, occurring in the absence of bodily injury or
property damage suffered by the plaintiff. Again it is important to
understand what is and is not at stake here. There is a cause of
action in tort for intentional infliction of economic loss, known as
interference with contract rights or prospective advantage (see

15. See, e.g., Potter v. Firestone Tire and Rubber Co., 6 Cal.4th 965, 25 Cal.
Rptr.2d 550, 863 P.2d 795 (1993).

277
TORT LAW

Chapter Fourteen). In addition, there is of course a right to recover
for economic loss that is the consequence of, or as is sometimes
said, is “‘parasitic’’ on one’s own bodily injury or property damage.
The out-of-pocket medical expenses and lost wages that injured
plaintiffs recover in ordinary negligence cases are economic losses,
as are lost profits resulting from property damage. Finally, there is
a separate body of rules governing the duty to exercise reasonable
care to avoid causing economic loss in cases where the defendant
has undertaken to provide a service or supply information and does
so negligently. Much of the law of professional malpractice by
lawyer and accountants, and the law of negligent misrepresenta-
tion, discussed in Chapter Fourteen, falls into this category.

In contrast, in the cases with which we are concerned here,
physical injury to the person or property of one party also results in
purely economic harm to another party. That is, this latter party’s
losses are not parasitic on any bodily injury or property damage
that he suffered. For example, suppose that the defendant’s negli-
gent driving causes a collision on a bridge that necessitates the
closing of the bridge for half a day. A party whose business is
located on the far side of the bridge is deprived of an essential
source of supply because the bridge is closed, and suffers economic
loss as a result; or a general contractor is prevented from hand-
delivering a construction bid to an office on the other side of the
bridge by the 12:00 noon deadline, and would have submitted the
low bid. Can either of these parties recover from the defendant for
the economic losses that they have suffered as a result of the
defendant’s negligence?

The traditional answer, given by what is often termed the
“economic loss rule,” has been to deny such recovery outright."
Like the traditional prohibition of recovery in negligence for pure
emotional loss, this is a rule at a high level of generality. Unlike the
law governing recovery for pure emotional loss, however, in this
field there has been only very modest evolution away from the
bright-line rule denying recovery. Although a few exceptions have
been created, the rule as it now stands is very similar to the rule as
it stood a century ago.

The reason is that the considerations that supported the rule a
century ago still largely support it today. First, notwithstanding
that pure economic loss is often a highly foreseeable result of
negligent conduct, the amount of liability that could result if there
were a cause of action for pure economic loss could be enormous,

16. Robins Dry Dock & Repair Co. v. Flint, 275 U.S. 303, 48 S.Ct. 1384, 72 L.Ed.
290 (1927).

278
AFFIRMATIVE AND LIMITED DUTIES

but its scope would be very difficult to predict. This unpredictability
would render the sale of insurance against such liability a very
risky undertaking. Such liability might therefore be uninsured. The
threat of wholly uninsured liability would probably discourage
many potential defendants from engaging in valuable activities
that, nonetheless, entail a risk of enormous consequential economic
loss if the activities are conducted negligently. For example, think
of the size of the economic losses that would be suffered by third
parties as a result of the negligent repair of an electric line on a
busy urban street, or negligently colliding with a utility pole. And
in event, for individuals and small businesses, threatening liability
whose potential scope far exceeds their assets is pointless. A party
whose net worth is $1 million is just as deterred by the threat of
liability for $1 million as by the threat of liability for $100 million.
Second, although in theory a deterrence shortfall results from the
denial of recovery for pure economic loss, the defendant in all such
cases is already threatened with substantial liability for the bodily
injury or property damage that may result from its negligence. So
the defendant ordinarily is not immunized from all liability as a
result of the rule. Third, and conversely, often the third-party
economic losses that result from negligently-caused bodily injury or
property damage, even when sizeable, are distributed among large
numbers of people. Given such already-existing broad loss distribu-
tion, the loss-distribution rationale for imposing liability on the
injurer is weak, especially since many of these losses can be insured
by victims through business-interruption insurance.

Finally, the economic losses resulting from an act of negligence
could spread far and wide. A pure economic loss suffered by one
party may then result in a pure economic loss suffered by someone
with whom he deals, and so on ad infinitum. If there were to be
some recovery for pure economic loss, a workable and fair distinc-
tion between the cases in which recovery would and would not be
permitted would have to be developed. But no logical ‘‘intermedi-
ate” rule seems available. If no such rule can be developed, then
permitting recovery would require a general foreseeability or un-
der-all-the-circumstances standard that in every case would threat-
en unlimited liability, even if that were not always the result. For
practical purposes, therefore, the law has chosen to draw the line at
no liability rather than to venture into an arena where there would
be few if any guidelines for adjudication.

The courts have, however, occasionally created exceptions to
the rule. Perhaps the most noteworthy involve cases in which there
has been natural-resource damage for which no party seems to have
a cause of action. In such cases, liability for economic loss serves as

279
TORT LAW

a kind of substitute for a cause of action for physical damage to
natural resources. For example, in Union Oil Co. v. Oppen," the
defendant’s negligence caused oil pollution in the Santa Barbara
Channel off California. Among other things, this pollution killed
fish and resulted in economic loss to the plaintiffs, who were
commercial fishermen. Conceivably the State of California could
have sued for the overall environmental damage that resulted from
the defendant’s negligence, but the State made no such effort. The
court allowed the plaintiffs to recover, adopting a test which it said
was based mainly on foreseeability. But the absence of a proper
plaintiff to sue for the physical damage in question, together with
the fact that the defendant was a sufficiently large enterprise (a
major oil company) to be capable of bearing that liability, probably
influenced the result. In a few similar cases recovery has also been
permitted by commercial fishermen, but denied to seafood sellers."
For the most part, however, common law recovery has been denied
even in cases closely analogous to Union Oil. Most of the courts
faced with the question have subscribed to the traditional rule and
have declined to venture onto the potentially slippery slope of
permitting some recoveries. Instead, in connection with oils spills,
such liability is governed by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990,” which
creates a cause of action for a variety of those who suffer economic
loss, among other things, as a result of damage to natural resources
caused by oil spills.

Importantly, even the cases that have permitted common law
recovery tend to share one characteristic. In most cases the defen-
dant’s negligence is determined by reference to the reasonableness
of the defendant’s also having risked some other kind of harm—
usually physical harm—either to the plaintiff or to a third party.”
As in liability for negligent infliction of emotional distress, then,
this form of liability employs a negligence standard that is anchored
in and derivative of the standard that would be applied to the same
set of facts if the suit were for physical harm. The cause of action is
not for negligently risking economic loss at large, but for negligent-
ly risking physical harm to one party or parties that results
economic loss to someone else.

INSURANCE, TORT REFORM, AND No-
FAULT SYSTEMS

In most tort suits for bodily injury or property damage, a
variety of forms of insurance are involved. Any reform of tort
implicates insurance, either directly or indirectly. To understand
tort reform it is therefore useful to understand the rudiments of
insurance. But of course more is required. Most tort law is common
law, made by the courts over a period of centuries. In the past
several decades, however, the state legislatures have entered the
tort law arena, modifying a number of traditional rules of tort law.
This Chapter first provides a primer on insurance and a conceptual
framework for analyzing any reform. The Chapter then surveys
three major tort reforms: statutory modification of tort doctrine,
workers compensation, and auto no-fault. The Chapter concludes
by examining several targeted no-fault reforms that apply to other
areas of liability—including the 9/11 Compensation Fund and the
BP Oil Spill Fund—as well as the possibility of extending the no-
fault model to medical and product-related injuries. Our purpose
here is not to examine every detail of these approaches, but to gain
the perspective that an understanding of their structure and func-
tion can shed on the nature of tort law itself.

I. A Brief Primer on Insurance and a Conceptual
Framework

A. <A Primer on Insurance

The starting point for any understanding of insurance is the
distinction between first-party and third-party insurance. First-
party insurance is victim’s insurance. It protects the policyholder or
other covered parties against a loss that he or she may suffer.
These are the forms of insurance that figure in the collateral source
rule discussed in Chapter Ten: health insurance, disability insur-
ance, life insurance, automobile property damage insurance, and
fire insurance, among others. We spend nearly a trillion dollars a
year in this country for private, first-party insurance, the majority
of this sum for health insurance. We spend roughly an additional

281
TORT LAW

$500 billion (half a trillion) on public sources of what amount to
first-party insurance: Medicare (health insurance for the elderly),
Medicaid (health insurance for the poor),Veteran’s benefits, and
Social Security Disability insurance, for example.

In contrast, third-party insurance is injurer’s insurance, or
“liability” insurance. It protects the policyholder or other covered
parties against liability, usually tort liability, to others. The defen-
dant has at least some liability insurance in most tort suits alleging
bodily injury or property damage. In these suits the typical liability
insurance policy not only insures the policyholder against liability,
but also provides the right to a defense against such suits. The
insurer pays for a defense, and decides whether and when to agree
to settle the suit or proceed to trial. Auto liability insurance is by
far the most common form of liability insurance, premiums for
which exceed $100 billion per year. Homeowners insurance policies
also provide some basic liability insurance, the total cost of which is
not separately reported, but which is at least several billion dollars
per year. Most physicians and hospitals have medical malpractice
liability insurance, whose cost is more than $10 billion per year.
And most businesses buy Commercial General Liability (CGL)
insurance, covering them against liability for bodily injury and
property damage, including products liability, at a cost of roughly
$40 billion per year.

To be realistic, any discussion of tort reform should take these
sources of insurance into account. All told, damages paid in tort
suits for bodily injury and property damage in this country are on
the order of magnitude of about $150-$200 billion per year, much
of which is covered by liability insurance. Most of the deterrent
effects of tort liability are not direct, but are likely to be felt
indirectly through the threat of changes in premiums paid for
liability insurance. Expanding tort liability will tend to raise the
cost of liability insurance; reducing tort liability will tend to de-
crease the cost of liability insurance. On the other hand, tort
liability, whether covered by liability insurance or not, is not the
only source of compensation for the victims of bodily injury and
property damage. In fact, given the very substantial forms of first-
party insurance described above, there would be considerable first-
party insurance against the medical expenses and lost wages that
are now subject to tort liability even if there were no tort liability.
In short, tort is part of a larger insurance and compensation
system, and depending on how we characterize that system, tort is
not necessarily even the major part of that system. This does not
mean that we should or should not retain tort liability as we know
it, but it does suggest that the above perspective on where tort fits

282
TORT REFORM

in the overall system may be worthwhile background to the discus-
sions that follow.

B. Conceptualizing Reform

Any injury liability-and-compensation system, including tort
law, workers compensation, and no-fault, has three major compo-
nents: 1) the compensable event; 2) the measure of recovery; and 3)
the payment mechanism.

The compensable event is the occurrence or injury that acti-
vates a right to compensation. This may be an injury resulting from
fault, as in most suits for accidentally-caused injury; an injury
resulting from a specified type of cause regardless of fault, as in
strict liability for abnormally dangerous activities or (as we will see
momentarily) any on-the-job injury as in workers compensation; or
it may simply be a certain kind of loss, such as a medical expense as
in health insurance, or the loss of wages as in disability insurance.

The measure of recovery consists of the amount and categories
of loss that are compensated when a compensable event has oc-
curred. This may be payment in a lump sum of all losses proximate-
ly caused by a tort; periodic payment of all such losses; payment of
only out-of-pocket losses, either in a lump sum or periodically;
payment of out-of-pocket losses plus pre-specified dollar amounts
depending on the severity of injury; or some other measure.

The payment mechanism is the method that is used to finance
the payment of compensation. This may consist of liability insur-
ance for most liable parties with self-insurance for others; first-
party insurance purchased by potential victims; government-provid-
ed compensation paid out of general revenues or out of a fund that
is raised by taxing potentially responsible parties; or some other
arrangement.

Thus, in tort the prevailing compensable event is an injury
caused by negligence; the measure of compensation is lump sum,
full payment of both tangible and intangible losses; and the pay-
ment mechanism is the injurer’s liability insurance or (so to speak)
self-insurance. But it is obvious from the foregoing paragraphs that
tort as we know it is not the only possible arrangement of the three
components that comprise and liability-and-compensation system.
Indeed, in a sense the modification of one or more features of this
arrangement is what tort reform consists of.

283
TORT LAW

II. Statutory Reform of Tort Doctrine

First in the mid-1970s and then again in the mid—1980’s, there
were tort liability “‘crises” across the country, involving escalating
rates of suit and increasing liability insurance costs. There is still
controversy over the causes of these crises, but at least one long-
term cause is indisputable. Over time, with the expansion of the
scope of tort liability, there were more suits, more settlements and
judgments, and more money was paid by liability insurers and their
defendant-policyholders. In response to these crises, nearly every
state legislature modified its state’s tort law in one way or another.
It is not possible to capture all the nuances of this legislation with a
single sweeping generalization. More than anything else, however,
the legislation modified various aspects of the law governing dam-
ages in tort cases. A reasonably accurate sense of this common
theme can be gleaned simply by noting the three reforms that were
most frequently enacted: absolute dollar ceilings on the amount of
awards for pain and suffering and punitive damages; limitations on
or complete elimination of joint and several liability; and abolition
of the collateral source rule.’ Each of the reforms has been referred
to in earlier Chapters.

Interestingly, none of these legislative reforms touches the core
of tort liability for bodily injury and property damage. They do not
affect the compensable event or the payment mechanism. None
affects the standard of care or rules governing proof of causation,
for example. And none precludes any plaintiff who could have
obtained a judgment against a defendant prior to its enactment
from obtaining a judgment thereafter. Those defendants who were
liable before the enactment of tort reform continued to be liable
after enactment, but often for less. The reform legislation accepted
the incidence of tort liability as it stood, but restricted the measure
of damages a successful plaintiff is entitled to recover. It modifies,
directly or indirectly, the measure of recovery.

This legislation can be viewed in two different ways. One view
is that as the frequency of tort suits and the size of average awards
increased, the need of potential defendants to be able to predict the
scope of their tort liability exposure increased as well. When liabili-
ty insurance and tort liability were only a tiny percentage of the
costs of conducting a business or profession, predictability was less
necessary. But as liability insurance and tort costs increased, pre-

TORT REFORM

dicting their magnitude came to be more important, because the
effect of an unexpected increase in costs would be more substantial.
State legislatures responded to this need by enacting legislation
that would make awards more predictable, without changing the
core rules of tort liability in any way. A more cynical view, however,
is that as liability insurance and tort costs increased, potential
defendants wanted relief from these costs. And what defendants
care about most is the amount of their liability, not whether they
are held liable. Consequently, defendants sought and received the
relief they wanted in the form of legislation that would decrease—
or at least slow the increase in—their liability insurance and tort
costs. Moreover, this reasoning goes, if the amount of damages that
can be recovered in a tort suit is limited, then potential plaintiffs’
incentives to sue will be reduced, and the incidence of tort liability
will decline even without any formal change in liability standards.

Whether one takes the former or the latter view, there can be
no disputing the fact that the tort reform legislation of the past
several decades has been limited and incremental. This legislation
has left the basic structure of tort liability untouched, even while
tinkering around the edges by modifying the measure of recovery in
a variety of ways. To gain an understanding of the possibilities for
more fundamental reform, we must look to other developments.

III. Workers Compensation

The nineteenth century was a period of enormous industriali-
zation and urbanization in the United States. It is only a slight
exaggeration to say that we went from being a nation of rural
farmers to being a nation of city-dwelling factory workers. With all
this industrialization came a whole series of problems, one of which
was industrial injuries. At the dawn of the twentieth century there
was growing recognition that workplace injuries were not merely a
legal, but also a social problem. The tort system itself was not
providing compensation for such injuries in an adequate way. Legal
doctrines restricted workers’ rights of recovery on grounds of
assumption of risk, contributory negligence, and the “‘fellow-serv-
ant” rule that precluded recovery from an employer for injuries
caused by another employee’s negligence. In addition, many work-
place injuries were not the result of anyone’s negligence and
therefore were not subject to tort liability, because employers were
liable only for negligence. After some years of controversy and, at
first, the enactment of partial or optional systems in the years
between 1910 and 1920 a new system of ‘‘workers compensation”
replaced tort liability for workplace injuries in virtually every state.

285
TORT LAW

Today, all states have substituted workers compensation for tort.
Workers compensation modified the first two components of any
liability-and-compensation system: the compensable event and the
measure of recovery. It left the third component, the payment
mechanism, in place.

A. The Compensable Event

The compensable event in tort was an injury caused by an
employer’s negligence. In contrast, in workers compensation the
compensable event is any non-negligently-caused work-related inju-
ry. Workers compensation abolishes the tort liability of the employ-
er and provides compensation to employees through an exclusive
remedy within an administrative system for injuries ‘‘arising out of
or in the course of employment.”’ And the only defense available is
that the employee intended to cause his own injury or acted with
wanton disregard for his own safety. This is strict liability of a very
broad sort. ‘‘Fault’’ has been replaced by ‘“‘cause’’ as the basis of
liability.

B. The Measure of Recovery

Workers compensation also modifies the measure of recovery.
Because of the expansion of the compensable event and the elimina-
tion of defenses, vastly greater numbers of workers are entitled to
receive compensation than in tort. Vastly increased costs could
therefore be expected. Some administrative cost savings could be
anticipated because of the greatly reduced cost of determining
eligibility for compensation. In tort it typically would have taken
litigation to determine whether an employer was negligent. But
most employees who enter the job uninjured and at the end of the
day are injured have incontestably suffered a compensable event—a
work-related injury. Indeed, what dispute resolution there is takes
place out of court, before an administrative board. Despite these
administrative cost savings, if the measure of compensation had not
been changed, the new workers compensation system would have
cost many times what the tort system did.

Consequently, the amount that an employee could recover was
limited. At first, recovery was limited to medical expenses and a
portion of several weeks’ wages. There was no recovery for pain
and suffering at all. Over time the number of weeks’ wages that
were recoverable has increased to the point where there is no limit
in some states and the limit is several years in others. Both wage
losses and medical expenses are paid periodically as they are

286
TORT REFORM

incurred. And there has also developed a rough but restricted
substitute for pain and suffering—lump-sum awards for partial and
total permanent disability have been enacted. For example, the
statutes specify particular recoveries to be awarded for loss of a
hand, loss of an eye, paralysis of both legs, and so forth. Often these
are specified as a multiple of a particular number of weeks’ wages.
Loss of an arm may be worth 300 weeks wages and loss of an eye
150 weeks wages, for example. Typically these sums are therefore
considerably more limited than the pain and suffering awards that
might be obtained in a tort suit for the same loss.

C. The Payment Mechanism

The changes that workers compensation made in the compen-
sable event and the measure of compensation are important, but
what was not changed also matters. The payment mechanism did
not change—that is, the employer remained liable, though on a new
basis. The employer might purchase third-party insurance—work-
ers compensation insurance, as it is called—to cover its liability for
benefits, or might self-insure. But regardless, because it remained
liable, the employer’s incentive to compare the cost of workplace
accidents (the amount of workers compensation benefits) with the
cost of reducing workplace accidents was preserved. Indeed, in a
sense that incentive was strengthened, because the employer was
now liable for many more claims than in tort, though for a much
lower average amount per claim. To put it another way, from the
deterrence standpoint workers compensation constituted a shift
from negligence to very strict liability, and therefore had the
potential to capture many of the advantages of strict liability
described in Chapter Hight.

And what the theory of strict liability suggests, the facts
confirm. Studies show that despite eliminating the threat of tort
liability, workers compensation has generated substantial safety
incentive effects. Indeed, no definitive study has shown that work-
places are less safe than they would have been had tort liability
been preserved, and many show otherwise. That is not to say that
workers compensation is without its critics. Benefit levels are
criticized as too low, periodic payment encourages some malinger-
ing, and with the rise of claims for work-related stress, for back
injuries, and for diseases that may be caused by long-term exposure
to hazardous substances, determining whether a workers’ loss is or
is not work-related has become more complicated and more expen-
sive. But over many decades, workers compensation has remained

287
TORT LAW

an effective approach that has achieved its goals by providing swift
compensation to injured workers on a no-fault basis.

IV. Auto No-Fault

In the period after World War Two the automobile became an
essential feature of American life. As more vehicles and miles were
driven, however, there inevitably came more auto accidents. Just as
there was a point at which workplace injuries went from being
perceived merely as a legal problem to being a social problem, so by
the 1960’s uncompensated auto-related injuries had become suffi-
ciently frequent and serious to be recognized as a social problem.

One approach to this ‘‘compensation gap”’ was the enactment
of legislation in many states requiring all drivers to be covered by
liability insurance. Such a requirement was meant to assure that
no one who was the victim of negligent driving would be left
without a solvent source of recovery. In addition, the insurance
industry developed a number of other devices that addressed the
problem outside of tort law. ‘Uninsured motorist insurance’ pur-
chased by car owners covers them and their family members in the
event that a negligent defendant who injures them is uninsured;
and ‘‘medical payments coverage’’ affords small amounts of insur-
ance for the medical costs resulting from auto accidents, whether
there was negligence involved or not. But these devices still leave
gaps in the fabric of compensation for auto-related injuries: not all
drivers comply with the requirement that they purchase liability
insurance; uninsured motorists insurance only covers losses caused
by the negligence of another driver; and medical payments insur-
ance usually has very low limits of coverage. In short, these devices
supplement rather than replace tort law as the principal avenue of
recovery for those who suffer auto-related injuries.

Naturally the workers compensation model came under consid-
eration as a possible substitute for tort law’s approach to the
provision of compensation for auto injuries. But it had been recog-
nized for some time that the auto accident problem did not fit
neatly into this model. In the employment situation there are two
differently-situated parties, the employer and the employee. It was
reasonable to conceive of the employer as the injurer and the
employee as the victim, because the employer is generally in the
superior position to manage the risk of workplace injuries. Placing
liability on the employer on a strict liability, or causal, basis
therefore made sense in the workplace context. In the typical auto-
accident situation, however, the two parties are similarly situated
in a number of respects. Both parties tend to be ordinary individu-

288
TORT REFORM

als who cannot be identified in advance as injurer and victim; both
parties may be injured; and sometimes there is only a single victim
without any other party involved as an “‘injurer’’ at all. Moreover,
even when there are two parties involved in an auto accident and
only one suffers injury, it does not follow at all that the uninjured
party is an injurer. If am carefully stopped at a red light when
another driver runs into my car from behind and is hurt, no one
would say that I injured him. In the absence of an inquiry into the
negligence of the parties, it is not terribly meaningful to ask
whether the party who did not suffer an injury was a cause, or
merely was involved in an accident that happened to injure some-
one else.

For these reasons, the workers compensation model of injurer-
based causal liability did not (and still does not) transfer comfort-
ably to the auto-accident situation. It took two law professors,
Robert Keeton and Jeffrey O’Connell, to think their way through to
a solution of this problem. Where workers compensation had left
essentially untouched the third element of any compensation sys-

tem—the payment mechanism—Keeton and O’Connell proposed a
wholesale change.

Keeton and O’Connell’s idea was to replace the third-party
insurance approach with a first-party approach. Auto injuries would
not trigger automatic injurer liability on the model of workers
compensation, but automatic victim liability. Instead of imposing
liability in tort on those who negligently caused auto-related inju-
ries, victims would bear their own injury costs by purchasing first-
party insurance against their losses.” Thus, auto no-fault consists of
two prongs: the abolition of tort liability and the mandatory pur-
chase of insurance directly protecting victims. While this may seem
at first to reject the strict liability approach of workers compensa-
tion, in a sense this approach does not reject strict liability. Rather,
auto no-fault adopts strict liability on the part of the victim, not the
injurer, even when there is an injurer. To put it another way, once
the element of negligence is removed from the equation, it is just as
accurate to think of the victim as causing his own injuries as it is to
think of the other party involved in the accident (who may also be a
victim) as the cause.

Soon after this idea emerged, it began to be debated in the
state legislatures. In the 1970s a somewhat modified version of the
idea was enacted in more than a dozen states, and a number of
other states have borrowed selected features of the no-fault idea

2. See Robert E. Keeton & Jeffrey O’Connell, Basic Prorection For THE AUTO
Victim (1965).

289
TORT LAW

and enacted them into law. For purposes of exposition, I will refer
to the theoretical idea of abolishing tort and replacing it with first-
party insurance as pure no-fault, the modified version that Keeton
and O’Connell proposed and that was adopted by statute as real no-
fault, a third version that operates in a number of states and
contains only the first-party insurance prong as add-on no-fault,
and a version that leaves drivers the option of selecting fault or no-
fault and that has been enacted in three states as choice no-fault.

A. ‘Pure’ No-Fault

Pure no-fault—though not enacted in any state—is an ideal
type that is worth analyzing as a baseline against which actual auto
no-fault can be compared. Pure auto no-fault would modify all three
elements of the tort system. First, tort liability for auto-related
injuries would be abolished. Instead, no-fault compensation would
be provided to the those who suffered auto-related injuries. The
compensable event under this system would be cause-based—an
injury “arising out of or in the course of” the operation, mainte-
nance, or use of a motor vehicle,

Second, as under workers compensation, the measure of recov-
ery would be reduced. Compensation for pain and suffering dam-
ages would be eliminated. Compensation for a percentage of wage
loss and medical expenses would be afforded, however, at least up
to a comparatively high (e.g., $50,000) automatic minimum, but
drivers would be entitled at their option to purchase coverage in
excess of this minimum.

Third, the payment mechanism would be insurance purchased
by potential victims rather than by potential injurers. In the
language of insurance, compensation would be paid by first-party
rather than by third-party (i.e., liability) insurance. To make this
insurance automatically available to victims, no motor vehicle could
be registered or legally driven in a state adopting this regime unless
the owner had purchased insurance covering any driver of or

passenger in the vehicle, or pedestrian in an accident involving the
vehicle.

One of the principal reasons this system would never be
enacted in any state is deep disagreement about whether it would
be sensible and fair to eliminate all recovery of damages for pain
and suffering. As in workers compensation, a system that afforded
compensation for pain and suffering on a no-fault basis would be
enormously expensive, and therefore impossible to enact as a prac-
tical matter. Consequently, whether to preclude no-fault compensa-

290
TORT REFORM

tion for pain and suffering is not merely a question about one
feature of the system, but goes to the heart of the auto no-fault
idea. Critics of no-fault, including pure no-fault, argue that elimi-
nating or restricting tort liability, especially for pain and suffering
damages, will cause an increase in the accident rate, because
drivers will no longer face the threat of tort liability for negligent
driving. In addition, the critics argue, in cases involving serious
injury resulting from negligent driving, justice between the parties
requires that the injurer be made to compensate the victim. No-
fault would relieve injurers of this obligation. In recent years there
have been some empirical studies confirming this effect in states
that have adopted auto no-fault, although there are other studies
suggesting otherwise.

Proponents of no-fault respond to these generic criticisms as
follows. First, as to the possible loss of deterrence resulting from
the abolition of tort liability for negligent driving, any driver who is
not already sufficiently concerned for his own safety to drive
carefully will not drive any less carefully once the threat of tort
liability is eliminated. As for the justice argument, most acts of
negligent driving are momentary lapses of attention. Typical driv-
ers commonly commit acts of negligence, and whether their negli-
gence causes serious injury or none at all depends more on luck
than on the degree of blame that can be ascribed to them. More-
over, liability insurance protecting drivers from the financial conse-
quences of their own negligence is very prevalent, and in virtually
all states is required. Victims and injurers both pay into the same
liability insurance pool, and premiums are only very roughly cali-
brated to the individual driver’s accident record. Justice between
injurer and victim in this situation is therefore attenuated at best.
Finally, because of the administrative cost savings it would achieve
and the reduced need for attorneys, pure no-fault would put more
money into the pockets of accident victims and less into the pockets
of attorneys and insurance companies.

Whether an impartial observer would assess these arguments
to weigh more heavily in favor of or against no-fault, pure no-fault
turns out to be just an idea that has no prospect of being enacted in
a single state.

B. ‘Real’? No—-Fault

In about a dozen states a system modeled on the Keeton and
O’Connell proposal that includes only a partial abolition of tort
liability was fashioned. This alternative, which I shall call ‘‘real”’
no-fault, garnered enough support to be enacted in some states and

291
TORT LAW

to remain in force today in most of the states that enacted it. Like
pure no-fault, real no-fault also has both tort-abolition and victim-
insurance prong. Under the first prong, drivers buy first-party
insurance, often termed Personal Injury Protection (PIP) protect-
ing themselves, their passengers, and pedestrians whom they in-
jure, insuring these parties for medical expenses and lost wages
“arising out of’ the operation of a motor vehicle. But under the
second prong of real no-fault, tort liability is abolished only for less
serious injuries. Thus, the obstacle that stands firmly in the way of
the enactment of pure no-fault on both political and principled
grounds—concern over abolition of tort liability for injuries involv-
ing substantial pain and suffering—is partly removed.

The reasons even this compromise has had only limited success
vary to a degree from state to state, but certainly one major factor
has been the opposition of attorneys who regularly represent plain-
tiffs in auto cases, who have lobbied strenuously against no-fault. A
second major factor has been the principled concern of many
legislators, who have proved reluctant to support even a limited
abolition of tort liability for auto-related injuries, because of their
concern for victims’ recovery of pain and suffering damages.

In real no-fault the distinction between injuries that are com-
pensable only on a no-fault basis and injuries for which a cause of
action in tort is preserved is drawn through the use of a “‘thresh-
old.”’ Claimants whose injuries surpass the threshold may bring
tort actions; claimants whose injuries do not surpass the threshold
have no cause of action in tort. There are two types of thresholds. A
monetary threshold specifies the dollar amount of medical expenses
that a claimant must incur in order to preserve her cause of action
in tort. A verbal threshold lists the various “‘serious’’ injuries that
qualify for recovery in tort regardless of the medical expenses
incurred to treat them. Other than soft tissue injuries and simple
fractures, most injuries of any seriousness typically qualify. But
since the vast majority of auto-related injuries are not ‘‘serious”’ in
this sense, the size of the monetary threshold is critically impor-
tant. There is considerable variation. These thresholds are as low
as a few hundred dollars in some states and as high as several
thousand dollars in others.

The result is that in low-threshold states only the most modest
tort claims are precluded, while in other states only the most
serious are permitted. The effect of this difference, however, de-
pends in part on how the second, mandatory-insurance prong of no-
fault is handled. If the minimal level of insurance is high (e.g.,
$50,000) then most victims are automatically entitled to recover
most of their out-of-pocket losses from their own insurance compa-

292
TORT REFORM

ny and typically do so. Since no-fault statutes normally offset tort
recoveries by the amount of prior insurance payments (i.e, reverse
the collateral source rule with respect to no-fault benefits), for
these victims the major effect of preserving their cause of action is
that they may recover damages for pain and suffering. In contrast,
in states with low minimum levels of mandatory no-fault insurance
(e.g., $2000), many victims do not have enough of their own
insurance to cover all of their out-of-pocket losses. The preservation
of a cause of action permits full recovery of out-of-pocket losses by
these victims.

Beyond these general differences lie more subtle, though signif-
icant, choices embodied by the distinctions between approaches.
The states adopting low thresholds have removed ‘‘nuisance’’
claims from the tort system and assured all victims quick, automat-
ic compensation for their losses. But since the bulk of tort actions
are preserved in these states, this form of no-fault looks a lot more
like mandatory first-party insurance than like tort reform. By
contrast, high thresholds that are difficult to surpass have the
potential to shrink the tort system in a significant way. In these
states the two prongs of no-fault—mandatory insurance and partial
abolition of tort liability—bear an important relation to each other.
The higher the insurance-benefit levels that a particular state’s no-
fault statute mandates, the higher the threshold can comfortably
be, for a high threshold will tend to assure full or near-full payment
of victims’ out-of-pocket losses without the need for tort recoveries.

The shape of the system adopted also affects one of the key
questions about no-fault: how much it costs. The disappointingly
high cost of no-fault actually has caused several states that original-
ly adopted the approach to repeal it. Critics often charge that no-
fault is not cheaper than the tort system, and point to changes in
insurance costs after the adoption of no-fault to prove their point.
But the comparison of before-and-after costs can be simplistic and
misleading. When there is tort liability alone, then drivers must
purchase liability insurance only. After no-fault with only partial
abolition of tort liability is enacted, however, drivers must purchase
both liability insurance protecting them against the liability for
“‘serious” injuries that has been preserved, and first-party insur-
ance covering themselves and their passengers for all out-of-pocket
injury costs up to the mandated benefit level. If that benefit level is
high, then of course the total cost of real no-fault (tort plus no-
fault) will exceed the former cost of tort liability alone. Under the
new system the most expensive part of the old system (liability for
serious injuries) has been preserved, while another system (manda-
tory first-party insurance) has been added onto it. The only appro-

293
TORT LAW

priate cost comparison would be between tort liability and pure no-
fault. But that is a comparison that cannot be made in practice,
because pure no-fault has never been enacted.*

Nonetheless, one feature of auto no-fault seems to have been
responsible for a considerable portion of the increasing cost of auto
no-fault: medical expense payments. The reason is that, in contrast
to modern health insurance, the medical expense component of
auto no-fault insurance typically is not subject to deductibles or co-
insurance and is not controlled by managed care guidelines. Physi-
cians and hospitals treating accident victims in no-fault states
therefore have an incentive to ignore typical health insurance
managed care guidelines and bill auto insurers for their charges. In
the absence of statutory standards that either prevent this strata-
gem or impose managed care guidelines for auto insurance, this
‘“‘hole in the dyke” is another reason that auto no-fault is likely to
continue to be more expensive than it might otherwise be expected
to be.

C. ‘“Add-on’’ No-Fault

The third version of no-fault is the most prevalent but least
significant. This version has one prong only. Under this version no-
fault insurance is an ‘‘add-on”’ to the tort system. Tort liability
remains untouched, but there is mandatory purchase of no-fault
medical-expense and lost-wage insurance.

Formally, this add-on form of no-fault is merely auto-insurance
reform without any tort reform whatsoever. But informally, even
add-on no-fault may have some impact on the incidence of tort
liability. By providing an automatic source of recovery for at least a
portion of every victim’s out-of-pocket losses, add-on no-fault elimi-
nates the need to sue for these losses. Some victims still will wish to
bring suit, especially in cases of severe pain and suffering. But for
victims with comparatively small claims and modest injuries, suit is
not necessary in order to obtain compensation, and some may
decline to sue because their out-of-pocket losses have been paid. In
this way even a reform that has no direct control of the incidence of
tort suits may have an indirect effect on them. It may be that over
time, as the scope of add-on benefits increases, the attractiveness of
retaining the right to sue in tort will decline. But at present in
most states the legislatures show no particular inclination to move
beyond the add-on approach by abolishing any portion of tort

Insurance, 78 S. Cat. L. Rev. 611 (2000).

294
TORT REFORM

liability for auto injuries. Instead, tort liability and add-on no-fault
peacefully co-exist.

D. ‘Choice’’ No-Fault

A final model allows drivers to choose whether to participate in
no-fault. Those who choose not to participate retain all their tort
rights and all their tort liabilities to other drivers who have chosen
tort. Those who choose to participate in no-fault partially lose the
right to sue in tort (for injuries below the applicable threshold) but
receive the same immunity from tort liability. Allowing this choice
neutralizes some of the objections to mandatory no-fault, since
potential victims are allowed to decide for themselves how valuable
their right to sue is to them. Kentucky, New Jersey, and Pennsylva-
nia have enacted versions of this choice approach.

The knotty problem for choice states is how to deal with
accidents between those who have chosen different options. In
theory the way to handle this issue would be to deny the plaintiff
who has chosen no-fault a tort cause of action (in below-threshold
situations) against a driver who has chosen fault, and to permit a
plaintiff who has chosen fault a full cause of action against a driver
who has chosen no-fault. Drivers’ liability insurance and no-fault
insurance would then make adequate provision for these possibili-
ties. In practice, however, the solutions the states that have enacted
vary from these theoretically optimal approaches. Interested read-
ers are directed to the laws governing choice no-fault in these states
for details.

V. Targeted No-Fault in Other Fields

A few no-fault approaches have been adopted in other fields,
either by legislation or unilateral establishment. In addition, there
continues to be consideration of the adoption of no-fault in the
medical and product areas. This Section considers both topics.

A. Actually Enacted or Adopted Approaches

At the federal level the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act
provides no-fault benefits to children who suffer specified side
effects of childhood vaccinations.’ And the September 11 Victim
Compensation Fund provided no-fault benefits to the victims of

4, 42 U.S.C. 8§ 300aa—1 to 300aa—34.

295
TORT LAW

9/11 and their families.> At the state level, Florida’ and Virginia’
provide no-fault compensation for birth-related neurological injury.
And in the wake of the 2010 explosion of its drilling rig in the Gulf
of Mexico and the massive oil spill that resulted, BP voluntarily
established the Gulf Coast Claims Facility to provide victims with a
no-fault alternative to bringing suit to obtain compensation for
their losses.

These targeted approaches define and apply to only a narrow
compensable event or set of compensable events. Whether a target-
ed compensable event has occurred is for the most part easy and
inexpensive to determine. And these schemes are elective for the
victim. That is, they give victims the option of receiving no-fault
compensation, or rejecting it and suing in tort instead. Although
targeted schemes have not proliferated, there are enough of them
to raise significant questions of horizontal equity. Why do those
who are beneficiaries of these targeted schemes receive the benefits
of access to no-fault compensation, while other victims are left to
whatever tort rights they are able to vindicate in lawsuits? The
answer, of course, is at least partly political: childhood vaccine
litigation was inhibiting the development and manufacture of these
vaccines; the airlines sought to avoid tort liability resulting from
9/11, and so forth. But even in the face of these political consider-
ations, targeted no-fault could not be automatically adopted. Rath-
er, the losses in question had to be susceptible to workable no-fault
definitions, or (in the case of the 9/11 and BP Funds) the discretion
of a Special Master administering them according to guidelines he
promulgated. And that may be at least part of the explanation for
the limited number of such schemes that exist at present. It takes
not only substantial political support for a targeted no-fault scheme
before it can be enacted. In addition, a targeted approach is
unlikely to be enacted unless it is technically feasible to define a
workable compensable event that targets losses on a no-fault basis.

B. The Future of No—Fault

The no-fault revolution is largely at a standstill. No state has
enacted real auto no-fault in two decades, although California
voters came within a percentage point of doing so in 1996. Nonethe-
less, long after workers compensation had been put in place it
inspired auto no-fault. Is it possible that these two no-fault systems

296
TORT REFORM

could now serve as models for reform of other aspects of the tort
system?

The prospects are not rosy, but it is highly instructive to
understand why. The central problem is how to define the compen-
sable event in a suitable way. In the employment and auto settings,
defining the compensable event is straightforward and simple: an
injury ‘‘arising out of or in the course of’’ employment or motoring.
Such a definition works because people virtually always go to work
or get into a car uninjured. If they emerge from work or driving
injured, it is highly likely that they have suffered a work-related or
auto-related injury. Using so straightforward a compensable event,
however, is not feasible in such other settings as medical or
product-related injuries.

By analogy to workers compensation and auto no-fault, could
no-fault benefits easily be made available to anyone suffering an
injury “arising out of or in the course of medical treatment?”
Unfortunately, determining whether the claimant had suffered a
compensable event would require complex fact-finding in a large
percentage of such claims. Many people seek medical treatment
because they are already ill or injured. In such cases there would
have to be a fact-finder who could distinguish injuries or illnesses
that were caused by medical treatment from conditions associated
with the patient’s underlying injury or illness. Whether the physi-
cian had committed malpractice would no longer be at issue. But
the causation question under medical no-fault—‘‘did the patient
suffer an injury arising out of medical treatment?’”’—would still be
at issue in many cases. The swift and certain compensation of
victims that is so characteristic of and so much an important part
of workers compensation and auto no-fault would therefore often be
unavailable. Nonetheless, some research has been undertaken in an
effort to assess the feasibility of making medical no-fault determi-
nations, and the results are mildly encouraging.’ Although these
efforts have as yet not gone beyond the research stage, limited
experiments in medical no-fault compensation may eventually be
undertaken.

A somewhat different problem, also involving the compensable
event, would plague efforts to develop product no-fault. No one
would want a system of insurance against all product-related inju-
ries. If you fall off a perfectly suitable ladder or cut yourself with a
high quality steak knife, I do not want to pay into an insurance

these products doing exactly what they are supposed to do. I would
rather take care of myself and not pay for your careless climbing or
cutting. Consequently, the product no-fault compensable event
would have to be limited to something like injuries “arising out of
the use of defective products.”” But of course the difficulty of
determining whether a product is ‘‘defective”’ is precisely what so
troubles current product liability law, and precisely what makes
finding some alternative outside of tort attractive. There would be
little point in adopting a no-fault system that replicated the prob-
lems it was designed to avoid.

One approach that might avoid some of these problems would
be to authorize elective, contractual no-fault for medical and/or
product injuries. If legal theorists cannot collectively define a com-
pensable event that is suitable for general use in product no-fault,
it may still be possible for individual companies or industry groups
to develop more focused alternatives that will work in more limited
settings. For example, chain saw manufacturers might want to
fashion their own no-fault system for their purchasers. Standing in
the way of this alternative, however, is the courts’ extreme reluc-
tance to permit contractual disclaimers of tort liability. Potential
defendants are therefore reluctant to invest in the development of
no-fault alternatives when they know that their investment may be
lost when the courts invalidate the approach they have tried to use.
Without advance validation there is not much incentive to develop a
no-fault alternative to tort liability.

Thus, ideally, legislation would authorize the adoption of such
alternatives in advance. Ironically, however, authorizing legislation
is unlikely to be enacted until a particular scheme has been
developed. The result is a chicken-and-egg problem in which a
particular scheme is unlikely to be developed in the absence of
authorizing legislation, and authorizing legislation is unlikely to be
enacted before a particular scheme is developed. Partly for this
reason elective no-fault has not yet gotten off the ground, although
at least in theory it is an attractive approach.

REPUTATIONAL AND DIGNITARY HARMs:

DEFAMATION AND INVASION OF PRIVACY

Virtually everything in the first twelve chapters of this book
has been concerned with liability for bodily injury and property
damage, or for the consequences of risking such harm. In this
Chapter and the next one we take up very different forms of
liability involving intangible rather than physical harms. This
Chapter concerns causes of action that protect reputation and
personal dignity: defamation and invasion of privacy.

I. Defamation

For most of tort law over the past one hundred years, progres-
sive expansion of liability has been the principal story. This is not
true, however, of liability for defamation, which is the only major
field of tort law that has undergone a major reduction in its scope
during the modern era. Until 1964 the law of defamation had
remained largely unchanged for a very long time. Beginning in that
year the U.S. Supreme Court entered the field and began a still-
continuing effort to define and elaborate the limitations on the
scope of the law of defamation required by the First Amendment to
the U.S. Constitution. Since those limitations are only partial,
however, the challenge in this field is both to understand the
common law of defamation and to identify the features of this body
of law that have been modified by constitutional dictate.

A. The Core Principles of the Common Law of Defama-
tion

Defamation is the making of a statement to a third party
(‘Spublication’’) that injures a person’s reputation. Reputation itself
is not one thing, but a cluster of values. Sometimes reputation is
much like property—one’s creditworthiness, for example, has mon-
etary value. On the other hand, sometimes reputation is a form of
honor, built up over time through accomplishment or good behav-
ior. Finally, sometimes reputation is more closely akin to dignity,
which can be lost through ridicule or satire. The law of defamation
is designed to protect each of these forms of reputation.

299
TORT LAW

A defamatory statement may be oral, in which case it is
slander, or it may be made in writing or otherwise more “‘perma-
nent” form in which case it is libel. In a leading case, the Supreme
Court of California has held that defamation on the internet
constitutes libel.! Because libelous statements are permanent and
therefore often are capable of doing more damage than slander, the
common law of defamation made them more easily actionable, in
the ways noted below.

The common law of defamation reflected a particular set of
values, placing much more emphasis on the protection of reputation
than on freedom of speech. There was strict liability for making a
defamatory statement—or for republishing someone else’s state-
ment with knowledge that it was defamatory. There are two major
exceptions to the rule that republishing a defamatory statement is
actionable. First, a federal law protects internet service providers
from liability for republication. Second, in some states there is
“neutral reporting privilege” that protects media against liability
for republication of a defamatory statement made by a “responsi-
ble, prominent organization”? against a ‘‘public figure’ if the re-
porting is “‘accurate and disinterested.”

At common law there also was no requirement that the defen-
dant intend to harm the plaintiff, have been negligent, or that the
defendant know that the statement was false. This amounted to
strict liability. Indeed, technically speaking, falsity was not even a
prima facie element of the tort. To be defamatory the statement
merely had to injure the plaintiff's reputation. The truth of the
statement could in fact be relevant, because truth was a defense.
But it was just that—a defense that the defendant had to plead and
prove in order to avoid liability.

1. The Prima Facie Case

In general a libel was actionable without proof of special
damages—i.e., out-of-pocket loss resulting from damage to the
plaintiff's reputation. Some states applied this rule only to libel
“per se,”’ defined as a statement that was defamatory on its face
and therefore required no extrinsic evidence to explain its defama-
tory character. The great advantage to the plaintiff in a libel per se
action was that he could recover compensation for ‘‘presumed”’
damage to his reputation and for consequent emotional loss without

internet service provider, with respect both to its ‘‘publisher’ and ‘distributor’
roles, see Blumenthal v. Drudge, 992 F.Supp. 44 (D. D.C. 1998).

300
REPUTATIONAL AND DIGNITARY HARMS

proving that damage. In contrast, slander was not actionable per
se—i.e., there could be no presumption of damage—unless it was
defamatory in one of four ways: by accusing the plaintiff of commit-
ting a major crime, having a sexually transmitted or other “‘loath-
some’ disease, conducting himself in a way that made him unsuited
for his business or profession, or engaging in infidelity or other
serious sexual misconduct.

Thus, simply by showing that the defendant had made a
statement to a third party that was damaging to the plaintiff’s
reputation, a plaintiff could prove a prima facie case of defamation.
In a broad variety of libel and slander per se cases, this showing
would trigger a presumption that the defamation had caused com-
pensable damage. Among other things this meant that the plaintiff
could survive the defendant’s motion for a directed verdict by
making this simple showing, and that unless the defendant could
make out a defense as a matter of law, the plaintiff's case would go
to the jury. The message sent by this structure was clear. Any
person who considered making a statement damaging to someone
else’s reputation was putting himself at risk of liability. As between
the interest in one’s reputation and the right to speak freely, the
common law seemed clearly to favor the former at the expense of
the latter.

2. Defenses

When the available defenses are added to this mix, the picture
becomes somewhat cloudier, but the overall emphasis remains the
same. As I noted above, truth was an absolute defense. There was
also a series of privileges, some absolute and some conditional.
Aside from consent, there was an absolute privilege to make defam-
atory statements in legal proceedings of one sort or another—
legislative, judicial, or administrative. And high officials of govern-
ment had an absolute privilege for any statement made as part of
their conduct of office, whether or not the statement was made in a
formal proceeding. A conditional privilege was one that protected
the maker of a defamatory statement from liability unless the
statement was made with knowledge that the statement was false
or with reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of the statement.
This standard was sometimes referred to as ‘‘actual malice,”’ a term
that the Supreme Court was later to employ.

The conditional privileges to make defamatory statements ap-
plied in a variety of contexts. What linked them together was they
applied to the kind of statements that had to be made in order for
ordinary business and important family matters to be conducted.
For example, there were conditional privileges for making defama-

301
TORT LAW

tory statements in letters of recommendation, in reports to proper
authorities about the commission of crimes, and in communications
to family members about the character of people with whom they
were dealing or had personal relationships—such as prospective
spouses. And lower governmental officials enjoyed a conditional
privilege to make defamatory statements as part of the conduct of
their office. Finally, there was a conditional privilege to engage in
“fair comment” on artistic, literary, and other public matters,
including public officials. But in the majority of states the fair
comment privilege applied only to the expression of opinions, not to
assertions of fact.

The effect of the privileges was to give those who held them
some room for making false statements that reflected negatively on
another person’s reputation without facing liability for defamation.
If only the defense of truth were available, then any false statement
could result in liability. Armed with a conditional privilege, howev-
er, the maker of a statement who had an honest belief that it was
true would be protected against liability. And if the maker hap-
pened to enjoy an absolute privilege, even an honest belief in the
truth of a defamatory statement was not necessary. So the common
law privileges created some “‘breathing space” for speech under
circumstances where the fear of liability for making a false state-
ment might otherwise have discouraged—‘‘chilled”—the making of
valuable true statements.

Since it was the defendant’s burden to prove-defenses and
privileges, however, the law of defamation encouraged even a
defendant who believed he was privileged to make a defamatory
statement to think twice before he made it. Nonetheless, at least on
paper, potential defendants had protection against liability for a
wide variety of negative statements about other people that they
might make in the ordinary course of business or personal life. For
making volunteered, gratuitous, wholly optional statements, howev-
er, there was less likely to be a conditional privilege and much more
likely to be liability. Two such non-privileged categories of state-
ments stand out especially. Ordinary gossip was unprotected at
common law and is unprotected now. The private individual, news-
paper, or television station that makes or repeats a defamatory
statement about an ordinary individual who is uninvolved in public
issues faces strict liability and has only the defense of truth as
protection. Similarly unprotected at common law was political
speech, broadly conceived, with the exception of the assertion of
opinions subject to the fair comment privilege. Those who made
false factual statements about government officials, candidates for
office, or people involved in public issues enjoyed no privileges and

302
REPUTATIONAL AND DIGNITARY HARMS

had only the defense of truth to protect them. In contrast to

ordinary gossip, however, political speech was about to receive
powerful constitutional protection.

B. Defamation Law and the Constitution

Beginning in 1964, the U.S. Supreme Court entered the field.
There can be no doubt that the Supreme Court’s rulings regarding
the constitutional limits on the scope of liability for defamation
have had great significance. Once utterly untouched by constitu-
tional limitations, defamation law today cannot be properly under-
stood without appreciating these limitations. On the other hand,
important as the so-called “constitutionalization” of defamation
law is, what has actually happened should not be exaggerated. After
a half-century of constitutional elaboration, it is only a modest
oversimplification to say that the major development has merely
been the establishment of new constitutional conditional privileges
for political speech and speech about public issues.

1. New York Times v. Sullivan

The most important of the Supreme Court’s decisions in this
field was its first, New York Times Co. v. Sullivan.’ The plaintiff in
that case, Sullivan, was one of three elected City Commissioners of
Montgomery, Alabama in 1960. The individual defendants signed a
political advertisement published in the New York Times contain-
ing a series of accusations regarding the City of Montgomery’s
conduct toward civil rights demonstrators, some of which were
false. The plaintiff was not mentioned by name, but he sued the
Times and those who signed the ad for libel. Under Alabama law, if
the jury found the statement to be “of and concerning” the
plaintiff, the statements were actionable without proof of special
damages because the statements were libelous per se and not
privileged. Punitive damages also could be awarded if malice were

proved, because a retraction the defendant had demanded was not
published.

The jury awarded Sullivan $500,000 in compensatory and
punitive damages. But the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the
verdict, holding that the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of
speech (applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment)
requires that the makers of statements about public officials be
afforded a conditional privilege to make those statements. To defeat
the privilege, the Court held, a public official suing for defamation

303
TORT LAW

had to prove with ‘convincing clarity” that the statement was
made with ‘“‘actual malice’’—i.e., with knowledge that the state-
ment was false or with reckless disregard for its truth or falsity. In
addition, to be actionable there had to be sufficient proof that the
statements were “of and concerning”’ the plaintiff to assure the
required constitutional freedom to criticize the government.

In one sense the decision in New York Times v. Sullivan is
unremarkable. If the existing common-law privileges were designed
to afford “breathing space’’ for speech necessary to the ordinary
functioning of business and family affairs, then surely the function-
ing of a democracy requires that there be at least a similar amount
of breathing space for political speech. For example, all that Su/li-
van did substantively was to create a conditional privilege to make
defamatory statements about public officials equivalent to the privi-
lege that employers and teachers have when writing letters of
recommendation. That can hardly be controversial.

On the other hand, for nearly two hundred years the state
courts had operated without any federally-set limits on the scope of
defamation law. Now, suddenly, there was a potential federal
“presence” in every defamation suit brought by a public official.
The context in which Sullivan was decided helps to explain how the
Supreme Court could have made a decision with the potential to so
intrude on the traditional province of the state courts. A civil rights
dispute gave rise to Sullivan’s lawsuit. The defamatory statements
made in a northern newspaper—the New York Times—were techni-
cally false in certain respects but were not misleading overall. The
plaintiff's suit was then tried in the still-segregated south. And the
Alabama jury awarded Sullivan one-half a million dollars without

proof that the statements had caused Sullivan any monetary loss at
all.

Moreover, the record before the Supreme Court showed that
the trial judge in the case had insisted on segregated seating in the
courtroom, and had introduced the case with the statement that
the Fourteenth Amendment (which guarantees due process of law)
is a “pariah and an outcast,” indicating also his belief that “‘the
white man’s justice * * * will give the parties * * * equal justice
under law.’ Add to this inflammatory setting the fact that the civil
rights movement, which by 1964 was at a fever pitch, drew much of
its political support from the North, through the mechanism of
media coverage. It was therefore understandable for the Supreme
Court to be concerned that the threat of large judgments imposing
strict liability for defamatory statements made in the course of the

4. See Rodney A. Smolla, Suinc THE Press 32-33 (1986).

304
REPUTATIONAL AND DIGNITARY HARMS

public controversy over civil rights would be used as a segregation-
ist weapon against those who favored civil rights. Viewed in this
light, the Supreme Court’s willingness to begin creating a whole
new constitutional jurisprudence of defamation is somewhat more
understandable, especially since the 1960s were a period of venture-
some lawmaking by the Supreme Court in other areas as well.

2. Beyond Sullivan

Once established, however, the new regime automatically had a
life of its own beyond civil rights disputes. In short order the rule in
Sullivan was applied to not only to public officials, but also to what
the Court called public ‘‘figures”—individuals who were not elected
or appointed officials, but whose prominence in politics, entertain-
ment, sports, or other pursuits made them a subject of public
interest. Eventually it also became clear that the Constitution
required the plaintiff to prove falsity, rather than putting the
burden of proving truth on the defendant. And in Gertz v. Robert
Welch, Inc.,° the Court was confronted with the inevitable question
of how the law of defamation could be squared with constitutional
requirements when the plaintiff was neither a public official nor
figure, but the defamatory-statement about the plaintiff concerned
a matter of public interest.

The Court responded with two rules. First, Gertz held that the
Constitution does not permit the imposition of strict liability for
defamation in cases involving matters of public interest, but that
the states were free to adopt any other standard as long as the
plaintiff was required to show at least negligence on the part of the
defendant. In effect, in cases involving matters of public interest
where the plaintiff was not a public official or public figure, the
states could adopt a conditional privilege that would be defeated
either by a showing of negligence, or, if a state so chose, only by
showing actual malice. Second, the Court ruled that in any of these
cases now subject to constitutional limits, “presumed” damages
were not permissible in the absence of a showing of actual malice.
Thus, when the plaintiff had shown only that the defendant was
negligent but still was permitted to recover, there could be no
recovery without proof of actual loss, though this could be emotion-
al loss rather than out-of-pocket economic loss.

For a time it was unclear whether Gertz had constitutionalized
all or only that part of the law of defamation dealing with matters
of public interest, since some of its language was very broad. But in

5. 418 U.S. 323, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789 (1974).

305
TORT LAW

Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc.,° the Court
ruled that the states were permitted to continue imposing strict
liability in cases that do not involve matters of public interest, and
apparently free to continue the practice of awarding “‘presumed”’
damages in such cases as well. Clearly this rule applies in cases
involving private plaintiffs suing non-media defendants. To what
extent the rule can coherently apply when a private plaintiff sues a
media defendant is unclear, however, since defamatory statements
published by the media are likely almost by definition to have
somewhat more public ‘‘interest’’ than utterly private statements.
Over a period of decades a series of other rules governing important
but ‘‘subsidiary”’ issues also has evolved.

The upshot of all this is that there is now a whole set of
constitutional limits on the scope of defamation liability. There are
now two separate constitutionally-required standards (actual malice
and negligence) in cases involving public officials and figures and
matters of public interest, respectively. But the states are still free
to apply the old strict liability standard in other cases. There is a
set of cases in which damages cannot be presumed (when proof of
at least negligence is required but actual malice has not been
proved). There is a new allocation of the burden of proof regarding
falsity. There is a heightened scope of review in cases where the “‘of
and concerning”’ the plaintiff issue is raised. And there is residual
uncertainty about whether different standards apply in some of the
cases involving media as distinguished from non-media defendants.

This legal framework is not only complicated, but has produced
unanticipated side effects. For example, the actual malice require-
ment in public official and public figure cases has obviously made it
harder for plaintiffs to recover; but because so much blame on the
part of the defendant is required for a recovery in such cases,
defendants have a tendency to fight defamation suits more strongly
than they did in the past, when a finding of liability did not
necessarily imply fault or professional misconduct on the part of a
newspaper, magazine, or T.V. program. Moreover, what had once
been a simple strict liability issue is often transformed into a
complicated and costly inquiry into the nature of the defendant’s
publication and fact-verification process, because constitutional
malice or fault must be proved. And if the plaintiff does succeed in
proving actual malice, the judgment awarded is likely to be much
larger than in the past, because the defendant has been proved to
have been highly blameworthy. For this reason also, defendants
have an increased incentive to invest whatever it takes to defeat a

306
REPUTATIONAL AND DIGNITARY HARMS

defamation suit. The result is that litigation is more complicated
than in the past. Finally, studies have shown that for many
plaintiffs, merely bringing suit and proving falsity constitutes vindi-
cation, even if they lose because they cannot show actual malice.
Many plaintiffs win by suing, even if they do not win by winning.

3. Assessment

At this point the Supreme Court cannot turn back the clock,
and might not wish to do so even if it could. But in retrospect it
appears that some of the concerns with which the Court began—the
threat of liability for large sums in cases involving minor factual
inaccuracies, for example—might have been addressed in another
way. Conceivably the Court might have focused on the threat of
““‘presumed”” damages to the constitutional guarantee of free
speech, and limited its intervention in state defamation law to the
regulation of presumed damages. Strict liability might then have
been permitted to continue in cases in which the plaintiff—typically
a public official or figure—wished to vindicate his or her reputation
but was not seeking to bankrupt or intimidate the plaintiff.’ A few
states now have enacted statutes permitting such name-clearing
actions through proof of falsity alone, but the statutes might not
have been necessary had the Court chosen to pursue the damages
route in order to assure that the necessary constitutional protec-
tions were available.

Nor is the increased protection that media enterprises have
come to enjoy entirely consonant with the other legal and economic
developments of the past thirty years. At the same time that the
rest of tort law was moving closer to enterprise-based forms of
liability, such as strict products liability and relaxed rules govern-
ing proof of causation in toxic harm cases, defamation law moved in
the other direction. One of the principal changes in the world of
print and electronic media during this period has been the recogni-
tion that “news” is a ‘‘product.”’ Yet whereas other product defects
now result in more liability, the media’s main product results in
less liability than in the past, not more.

Finally, although at some level New York Times v. Sullivan
was intended to take at least some of defamation law out of politics,
many of the most noteworthy defamation trials of the post-Sullivan
period carried into the courtroom the very political struggles that
were the subject of the defendant’s reporting. A widely-publicized
suit against the television program ‘Sixty Minutes’ by the com-

7. See Pierre Leval, The No—Money, No-Fault Libel Suit: Keeping Sullivan in its
Proper Place, 101 Harv. L. Rev. 1287 (1988).

307
TORT LAW

mander of the United States forces during much of the Vietnam
War, General William Westmoreland, was only the most celebrated
example of many.’ Ironically, then, not only does the constitutional-
ization of defamation law run somewhat against the grain of the
rest of modern tort law; in addition, much of what that constitu-
tionalization has brought probably has not been anything like what
the Supreme Court may have expected. Unanticipated side effects
that make litigation more complicated and costly rather than
simply creating additional breathing space for political speech now
figure in virtually every major defamation suit.

II. Invasion of Privacy

The first principle of the tort of invasion of privacy has been
repeated so often that it is almost a cliche. Invasion of privacy is
not one tort, but four: 1) appropriation of the plaintiff's name or
likeness; 2) unreasonable public disclosure of private facts; 3)
intrusion on the plaintiff’s solitude or privacy; and 4) portrayal of
the plaintiff in a false light. Although these categories are now well-
established, all four causes of action emerged clearly only in the
twentieth century.

Each privacy tort is concerned with a different form of invasion
and, to some extent, a different form of loss. What links the four
torts together is not simply the umbrella term ‘‘privacy,”’ but their
general concern for the protection of personal dignity. In keeping
with this concern, none of the four torts requires proof of out-of-
pocket damages in order to be actionable. Rather, although (unlike
common law libel and slander per se) damages are not ‘‘presumed”’
in invasion of privacy actions, the plaintiff is entitled to recover for
the rather abstract non-monetary harm to dignity suffered from the
invasion, as well as for resulting mental distress suffered. Given the
requirements of the privacy torts described below, the conduct that
gives rise to the invasion very often also warrants imposition of
liability on the defendant for punitive damages.

As the four privacy causes of action emerged, the courts had
not only to decide whether an invasion ever was actionable, but
(when it was actionable) under what conditions. Because the priva-
cy torts are of comparatively recent vintage and are not the
frequent subject of litigation, their contours still are not clear in
every detail. The need for continued clarification of the interests
they protect, the basis upon which liability for each form of intru-
sion may be imposed, and the countervailing concerns that limit the

8. See Westmoreland v. CBS Inc., 596 F.Supp. 1170 (S.D.N.Y.1984).

308
REPUTATIONAL AND DIGNITARY HARMS

scope of liability, make the privacy torts open-ended and subject to
evolving modification.

A. Appropriation

A person’s name and the way he or she looks are a central part
of his or her identity. For this reason it is tortious for the defendant
to appropriate the plaintiff's name or likeness for commercial
purposes, and in many states for non-commercial purposes. When
the benefit the defendant obtains from appropriation is commercial,
the main interest the tort of appropriation protects is the economic
value of one’s name or likeness. In this sense the interest is much
like property, and the defendant’s wrong is much like taking
property without consent. But even if the plaintiff's name or
likeness is not used for commercial purposes the appropriation is a
wrong. For example, using the plaintiff's name without permission
to publicize a charity ball would also be actionable in many states.

The limits on the tort of appropriation derive from what in a
very rough sense can be understood as waiver assumption of risk by
the plaintiff. Anyone who attends a public gathering or even goes
out onto the street ought to recognize that her photograph may be
taken and used as an exemplar by the news media or even by a
private person. Thus a fan cheering at a sporting event has no
claim against the magazine that publishes his picture, and a person
passing by a gruesome accident is not protected against publication
of his picture in the background of a newspaper photograph of the
scene. The First Amendment probably also exercises some gravita-
tional pull in this field, though there are few decisions actually
applying it. Because for the news and entertainment media com-
mercial profit and free speech are inextricably linked, it is not
always possible to distinguish a purely commercial appropriation of
the plaintiff's likeness from legitimate reporting of matters of
public interest. Thus the tort of appropriation may provide less
protection for plaintiffs who are public figures and especially enter-
tainers, who must tolerate use of their names and likenesses when
publicity is given to their exploits. Nonetheless, simply employing a
celebrity's image for commercial purposes is an appropriation,
except when the defendant subjects the image to artistic or expres-
sive “‘transformation,”’ in which case the expression may have First
Amendment protection.’ It is worth noting, however, that since
celebrities are the very people whose names and likenesses will help
to sell products, the damages they recover when they are successful
in an appropriation suit may be substantial.

B. Disclosure

In general people have a right to be left alone. It is an intrusion
on my privacy—on my right to be left alone—if you disclose private
facts about me to a third person or persons and under the circum-
stances your disclosure is ‘‘offensive.’’ But because some people
have voluntarily placed themselves in the public eye, they have a
right to expect less protection against the disclosure of private facts
about them than do private individuals. And occasionally the rights
of someone who has involuntarily become a subject of publicity
must be balanced against the public’s legitimate, though not neces-
sarily admirable, interest in them.

One of the leading cases on this score is Sidis v. F-R Publish-
ing Corp.,° in which the New Yorker magazine profiled a reclusive
genius who had received publicity as a child prodigy many years
before. The plaintiff had become an ‘‘insignificant clerk,’’ was living
in a rooming house, and had gone to some lengths to avoid public
attention. Nonetheless, the court held that he had no cause of
action, on the ground that the facts about the plaintiff, though
embarrassing to him, were in an attenuated sense “newsworthy.”
Apparently the newsworthiness of the facts about the plaintiff
influenced the determination that the disclosure was not offensive.
Other courts have let the issue whether the plaintiff's fame (or
infamy)" has faded sufficiently to render the disclosure offensive go
to the jury. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the First
Amendment precludes the imposition of liability for the disclosure
of the name of a rape victim obtained from public records,” though
subsequent decisions have left unclear exactly how “public” a
record must be in order to afford the defendant this protection. But
some state courts have permitted the imposition of liability for
disclosure in certain cases involving breach of confidence—for ex-
ample, by a physician who discloses the name of a birth mother to
an adopted child.”

The lesson of these decisions is that, regardless of the precise
point at which the line is drawn, the right to be free from offensive
public disclosures of private facts must at some point yield to the

public’s right to know about matters of public interest. Whether a
disclosure is actionable will tend to be a highly context-dependent
decision, taking into account the extent to which the plaintiff has or
has not voluntarily subjected himself to publicity in the past, the
character of the information disclosed, the manner in which the
defendant came into possession of the information, and the legiti-
macy of the public interest in the information disclosed.

C. Intrusion

Nothing comes closer to invading the core of what we think of
as “‘privacy”’ than physical or electronic invasion of a place or space
from which the plaintiff has a right to exclude others. The bedroom
is the classic venue, but a physician’s examination room, and even a
cell phone conversation or one’s mail or email also qualify. The
intrusion need not literally be physical—visual or auditory surveil-
lance from afar may also be actionable. The only requirements are
that the invasion be highly offensive to a reasonable person and
that it be into a place or space in which the plaintiff has a
reasonable expectation of privacy. Even an ambulance may be a
private space for some purposes." In contrast to the other privacy
torts, there is usually no countervailing interest that the defendant
can point to in order to justify intrusive conduct. The invasion must
be sufficiently offensive, however, to warrant the law’s interven-
tion. Most allegedly actionable invasions can be resolved with an “‘T
know it when I see it’ test that takes the entire context into
account. After all, although one can articulate why an intrusion
does or does not seem “‘offensive,’’ ultimately offensiveness is more
a matter of common indignation than logic.

One difficult problem involves “‘stalking’’ and other persistent
intrusions that take place in public spaces rather than on private
property. Even on the street, in a park, or at a museum, one’s
personal space may be offensively invaded by the repeated, harass-
ing presence of the defendant. The plaintiff may not be entitled to
maintain that space against intrusion by multiple, nameless indi-
viduals; but a single individual day after day may be said to invade
the ‘“‘moving circle” of privacy that follows everyone around, even
in public spaces. Celebrities as well as private individuals have a
right to protection against this kind of invasion, once it becomes
harassment. Unfortunately, however, although the threat of civil
liability and even punitive damages may deter business enterprises

from becoming involved in such harassment,” a mentally disturbed
individual is less easily deterred by conventional means. Here tort
law reaches the limits of its capacities, and injunctions or statutori-
ly prescribed criminal penalties become necessary to curtail the
ongoing invasion of the plaintiff’s privacy."

D. False Light

Finally, it is an invasion of the plaintiff's privacy to portray
him in a false light if that is done with actual malice (in the
constitutional sense)” and the portrayal is highly offensive. Often a
portrayal in a false light will also constitute defamation, but con-
ceivably a portrayal can be in a false light without injuring the
plaintiff's reputation or otherwise defaming him. The interests
protected by false light and defamation are extremely close if not
identical, however, and indeed in some cases only a narrow defini-
tion of the interest in ‘“‘reputation”’ protected by the tort of defama-
tion seems to qualify as a portrayal in a false light without its also
being defamatory.

Economic Harms: MISREPRESENTA-
TION AND INTERFERENCE WITH Con-
TRACT OR PROSPECTIVE CONTRACTUAL

ADVANTAGE

This last Chapter concerns torts that typically arise out of
contractual or commercial relations and result mainly in economic
losses rather than physical harm. These torts reflect business
customs and ethics, and therefore have evolved over time in re-
sponse both to economic change and new business practices.

I. Misrepresentation

The classic form of misrepresentation is intentional: fraud. But
under limited circumstances liability may also be imposed for
economic losses caused by negligent misrepresentation, and some-
times even for innocent misrepresentation. Although there is liabili-
ty for fraud outside of business and commercial settings, most of
the litigation involving this cause of action arises out of economic
dealings rather than personal relations. For this reason, and before
we address the elements of a cause of action for misrepresentation,
it is useful to begin by considering what the tort is all about.

A misrepresentation is a false statement of fact. The tort of
misrepresentation is therefore intended to redress harm caused by
the communication of false information, mainly in the course of
business and commercial relations. Not all false statements are
actionable, however, because the degree of care that is expected of
the party making a statement of fact varies. In virtually every
setting—though even here there are a few exceptions—it is expect-
ed that one party will not lie to another. On the other hand, there
probably is no firm expectation among business people that they
will exercise reasonable care that the statements they make to each
other in the course of transacting business are true. Only in
settings where information is transferred as part of a service
purchased—such as legal or accounting advice—is such an expecta-
tion commonly held. And still less is there an expectation that the

313
TORT LAW

accuracy of statements made in commercial relations is guaranteed
to be true, in the absence of an express guarantee of accuracy.

The law governing liability for misrepresentation pretty well
coincides with these expectations. There is liability for fraud almost
without regard to the business setting in which a lie causes eco-
nomic harm to its recipient. But liability for merely negligent
misrepresentation is not imposed in ordinary commercial settings,
being reserved mainly for professional and fiduciary relationships
where the parties expect that reasonable care to ensure that
statements are accurate will be exercised. And although the scope
of liability for innocent misrepresentation varies somewhat between
jurisdictions, in general tort liability for innocent misrepresentation
(as distinguished from the right to rescind a contract based on it) is
imposed only when the defendant has warranted the truth of his
statement.

A. Fraud

There are five elements to a cause of action for fraud. 1) The
defendant must have made a false statement of fact; 2) with
knowledge that the statement is false or with reckless disregard of
the truth or falsity of the statement (“‘scienter’’); 3) intending the
plaintiff to rely on the statement; 4) the plaintiff must have
justifiably relied; and 5) the plaintiff must have suffered damage as
a result. In addition, something like a proximate cause requirement
limits the scope of liability for fraud.

1. False Statement of Fact: Misrepresentation
and Nondisclosure

There can be no false statements of fact about the future, and
there are no false opinions. Typically, therefore, fraud consists of a
false statement about a present (or occasionally a past) state of
affairs. On the other hand, a person’s present state of mind is as
much a present fact as anything else. It is therefore possible to
make a false statement about one’s intention regarding the future
or about one’s opinion, if the statement misrepresents the defen-
dant’s present state of mind. For example, if I say that I intend to
pay your way through college if you give up smoking, never intend-
ing to do so, my statement is a false representation of my state of
mind. Similarly, if I say that I believe that John Doe is to be trusted
when I have no such belief, I have misrepresented my opinion.

The failure to disclose a material fact may also constitute
fraud. But the law’s longstanding reluctance to impose tort liability
for nonfeasance, and the norm of caveat emptor that animated

314
ECONOMIC HARMS

much of the common law of contract, together meant that tradi-
tionally there was little such liability. The general attitude of the
law still is that it is incumbent on the interested party to ask about
material information. A false answer to a question about a material
matter would result in liability for fraud, and a party’s expressed
unwillingness to give any answer at all would tell the inquirer a lot
about the subject of the question. There are some exceptions in
which the law imposes an affirmative duty to disclose information
not asked for, but most involve unusual situations rather than
straightforward withholding of information: for example, for incom-
plete statements that are half-truths; and for statements that are
not knowingly false when made but which the defendant later
learns were false. In recent years, however, there has been some-
thing of a move toward imposing liability for fraud when the
defendant has failed to disclose facts that are ‘‘basic’’ to the
transaction. Partly such liability reflects changing norms regarding
proper business behavior. But some decisions are an effort to lead
rather than follow business ethics.

One of the problems associated with liability for nondisclosure
is that neither the case law nor ordinary norms are clear about the
situations in which affirmative disclosure is and is not expected. A
failure by the seller of a home to disclose that it is infested with
termites is often actionable;' but a buyer’s failure to disclose his
belief to the seller of land that it contains deposits of oil is not.
Some of this difference in treatment reflects the differences be-
tween buyers and sellers, since buyers are often uninformed con-
sumers, whereas sellers are at least sometimes sophisticated and
informed repeat players in the market. But that is not always the
case, and in any event much of the case law cannot be explained on
this basis.

One interesting effort to explain the scope of liability for
nondisclosure argues that there is no duty to disclose when the
information in question was obtained through a costly search,
whether by the buyer or seller. On the other hand, when the
information was not the result of a costly investment or search and
is basic to the transaction, liability for fraudulent failure to disclose
is more likely to be imposed. Thus, the seller of a house infested
with termites has come into possession of that information without
making a costly effort to do so, whereas the buyer of land under
which there may be oil often has invested in geological research.
Imposing liability for the former’s failure to disclose will create

2. See Anthony T. Kronman, Mistake, Disclosure, Information, and the Law of
Contracts, 7 J. Lecau Stun. 1 (1978).

315
TORT LAW

little if any disincentive to acquire useful information, whereas
liability for the latter’s failure to disclose would do exactly that.

2. Scienter

The defendant must make the false statement of fact with
actual knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard of its truth
or falsity. This state-of-mind requirement is termed “‘scienter.’’ The
ordinary expectation in business is that statements of fact will be
made with an honest belief that they are true. A statement that is
knowingly false or made with disregard of its truth or falsity
contains a false implication that the maker believes it to be true,
when in fact he does not, or has no belief one way or the other. The
requirement that disregard be ‘‘reckless” adds an element of blame
that would be absent from merely casual or inadvertent disregard
for the truth or falsity of what one is said.

3. Intent That the Plaintiff Rely

The defendant has not committed fraud unless he intends that
the plaintiff rely on his false statement. This requirement is some-
times called an “‘intent to deceive,”’ but this latter way of describing
the requirement can be misleading. A defendant who knowingly
makes a false statement and intends the plaintiff to rely on it
automatically intends to deceive. On the other hand, a defendant
who acts only with reckless disregard may intend the plaintiff to
rely, but does not necessarily intend to deceive the plaintiff. It could
be argued that if such a defendant intends the plaintiff to rely on
the statement, he must also intend to give the plaintiff the mistak-
en impression that he (the defendant) has an honest belief that the
statement is true. But it seems just as possible that a defendant
who disregards whether what he says is true or false is at the same
time simply disregarding whether the plaintiff will suppose that the
defendant believes the statement to be true. Admittedly, however,
the two situations are very close, and any defendant who has an
actual intent that the plaintiff rely normally also has an actual
intent to deceive the plaintiff about his (the defendant’s) state of
mind.

4. Justifiable Reliance

This element adds the necessary causation requirement to a
claim for fraud. If the plaintiff did not rely on the defendant’s false
statement, then the statement did not cause the plaintiff’s loss and
there can be no recovery. That reliance also must be justifiable,
however, which means both that a) the statement must be materi-
al—i.e., would be of substantial importance to a person involved in

316
ECONOMIC HARMS

the transaction in question—and b) is not so preposterous or

otherwise lacking in credibility that the plaintiff should not have
relied on it.

The materiality and credibility criteria thus require weighing
the importance and character of the statement, in context. A false
statement that a house being sold is not infested with termites will
virtually always be material, whereas a statement that the house
has a dry basement when in fact small puddles appear twice per
year probably is not material in the absence of special circum-
stances. As to credibility, the plaintiff is not justified in relying on
the defendant’s statement that his fifty-year old house is in “‘per-
fect condition” and “‘is strong enough to stand up in a tornado.”’ An
exaggerated statement of high quality is the kind of “‘puffing’’ that
so often takes place in the course of negotiation that people must
learn to discount it. It may be justifiable, however, to rely on more
precise assertions made under circumstances in which exaggeration
is not to be expected. For instance, it is not mere puffing for a
defendant who has applied for credit to exaggerate the amount of
money he has in a bank account.

5. Damages

This element raises more complicated issues than might be
supposed in the first instance. Ordinarily the measure of damages
in tort is designed to make the plaintiff ‘“whole’—that is, to put
him in the same position he would have been in had his loss not
occurred. In fraud, compensation for the plaintiff's owt-of-pocket
losses would accomplish this goal. For example, suppose that defen-
dant represents his house to have copper plumbing and new wiring
when in fact it has neither. If these statements were true, the
house would be worth $100,000, but in fact it is worth only $85,000
in its actual condition. The plaintiff buys the house for $90,000. His
out-of-pocket loss is $5000—the difference between what he paid
and what the house is actually worth. Note that if the plaintiff had
paid only $85,000 for the house then he would have no out-of-
pocket damages and would recover nothing.

However, the defendant’s statement caused another form of
harm that the out-of-pocket measure does not capture: it deprived
the plaintiff of the benefit-of-the-bargain he had made. Had the
property been in the condition represented by the defendant, the
plaintiff would have purchased a $100,000 house for $90,000. His
loss in this respect was $10,000. In fact, therefore, the plaintiff has
lost a $10,000 bargain and has suffered a $5000 ‘‘out-of-pocket’’
loss. Courts and commentators occasionally also describe this total
($15,000) loss as the benefit-of-the-bargain, on the theory that what

317
TORT LAW

the plaintiff should recover is the difference between the value of
what he bargained for ($100,000) and the value of what he received
($85,000). This measure of damages puts the plaintiff in a better
position than he would have been in had the misrepresentation
never occurred—something tort law does not typically do. But that
is precisely what contract law does when it awards expectation
damages for breach of contract, measured by the difference between
the value of what was promised and what was delivered. The
benefit-of-the-bargain measure simply recognizes that even in an
action that is brought in tort (perhaps because the plaintiff is also
seeking punitive damages), fraudulent misrepresentations made in
the course of contractual negotiations may have a promissory
character that warrants an award of damages for loss of the
promisee’s benefit of the bargain.

Many courts permit the plaintiff to choose his preferred meas-
ure of damages, because there are times when the benefit-of-the-
bargain measure does not maximize the plaintiff's recovery.* Of
course, where there was no contract between the plaintiff and the
defendant, the plaintiff's out-of-pocket or consequential loss is the
only measure of damages available. But suppose that the values
stated in the earlier hypothetical case were that the same except
that the plaintiff paid $110,000 for the house. The plaintiff’s out-of-
pocket loss would be $25,000. Of course, one might question wheth-
er the plaintiff should receive such an award, since in effect it
disregards the fact that he would have lost money had the defen-
dant’s statement been true. But the courts permitting such a
recovery have subscribed to the principle that the defendant who
commits fraud should not be heard to complain that part of the
plaintiff's loss results from his poor bargain. In effect this is simply
a rejection of contributory negligence as a defense to fraud.

6. The Scope of Liability

Something like a proximate cause requirement applies in fraud,
and serves to limit the right of recovery to those persons whom the
defendant actually knows will rely on his false statement or whose
reliance is highly foreseeable. When the fraud occurs in the course
of contractual dealings, of course, the other party is known. But
sometimes third parties can be expected to rely either on represen-
tations made to a contracting party or otherwise. For example,
potential investors can be expected to rely on statements made by
auditors, future creditors can be expected to rely bank references,
etc. There is naturally a concern that the threat of liability to a
large number of unidentified parties will deter desirable involve-

8. See, e.g., Selman v. Shirley, 161 Or. 582, 91 P.2d 312 (1939).

318
ECONOMIC HARMS

ment in these activities. The law has therefore tended to draw the
line short of liability to all foreseeable plaintiffs, though there is

liability to plaintiffs who are actually foreseen and to those who are
“highly” foreseeable.

B. Negligent Misrepresentation

There may of course be liability for negligent misrepresenta-
tion that foreseeably causes bodily injury or property damage. If
you ask me whether it is safe to stand on a ladder that I have
carelessly inspected and I answer the ladder is safe, I am liable for
any injuries that you suffer when the ladder collapses. This is
ordinary negligence. In Chapter Eleven, however, we saw that in
general there is no liability in negligence for pure economic loss.
That rule applies to negligent misrepresentation as well, for in
business and personal relationships there is no generally estab-
lished expectation that people will exercise reasonable care that
their statements are true before they speak. Rather, people are
expected only to be honest—i.e., not to make knowingly false
statements. In certain settings, however, reasonable care is expect-
ed, and in these settings there is liability for economic loss caused
by negligent misrepresentation.

With the obvious exception of knowledge of falsity, proof of the
other elements of a cause of action for fraud (falsity, intent that the
plaintiff rely, justifiable reliance, and damages) is also required for
negligent misrepresentation. Two other important issues do arise in
connection with negligent misrepresentation: 1) the incidence of
liability—when there can be any such liability at all; and 2) the
scope of liability, or duty, issue—when there can be such liability,
to whom the defendant may be held liable.

1. The Incidence of Liability

The principal example of liability for negligent misrepresenta-
tion involves what amounts to malpractice by professionals and
other providers of expert or fiduciary services. Accountants, attor-
neys, weighers, surveyors, real estate agents, and other similarly
situated experts are liable for negligently inflicted economic loss
because they are expected to exercise reasonable care in accordance
with the standards of their callings. And most often that negligence
is memorialized in the form of some advice, information, opinion or
conclusion that is negligently inaccurate. Holding these parties
liable to their clients or customers for negligent misrepresentation
is unremarkable. Such liability also is sometimes imposed on cer-
tain non-professional fiduciaries who stand in a ‘“‘special relation-

319
TORT LAW

ship”’ of trust and confidence to those whom a negligent misrepre-
sentation harms, such as the directors of a corporation to investors,
or a bailee to a bailor.

Liability for pure economic loss resulting from negligent mis-
representation is rare, though not unheard of, in situations that do
not fall into one of these two categories. For example, if a non-
professional, non-fiduciary defendant supplies information to the
plaintiff and reasonably appears to invite the plaintiff to rely on the
information, then there may be liability. Thus, a health insurer
who inaccurately certifies to a hospital that a patient has coverage
may be liable to the hospital for negligent misrepresentation. In
addition, of course, if the parties to an ordinary business relation-
ship actually expect each other to exercise reasonable care in the
transmission of information, then they are always free to provide
by contract that one or both parties promise that they have
exercised or will exercise reasonable care that their statements are
accurate and that they will be liable for the harm that results if
they were negligent. In the absence of such agreement, however,
the law assumes that they expect to be held liable only for fraud.

In fact, in practice, contractual provisions requiring the exer-
cise of reasonable care are rare, for two reasons. First, when parties
in a commercial transaction want more than honesty, they tend to
want guaranteed accuracy, not just reasonable care. As a conse-
quence, the typical contract provision representing a fact to be true
is a warranty whose breach results in liability automatically—i.e.,
on a strict liability basis. Second, outside the professional services
context, what constitutes a “‘reasonable’’ degree of care to assure
the accuracy of representations is difficult to inform by reference to
independent norms. Professionals and other ‘experts’? tend to
follow common practices and to comply with common standards.
They impliedly hold themselves out as following these practices and
complying with these standards. The failure to do so is at least
some evidence of their negligence. In contrast, non-professional and
non-expert pursuits tend not to be governed or even ‘‘ordered”’ by
common practices or standards regarding the transmission of accu-
rate information. For example, it is unclear how meaningful it
would be even to talk about whether a clerk in a movie-supply
business had exercised ‘‘reasonable” care to assure that the de-
scriptions of the movies in its catalogue were accurately matched-
up with the movie titles. For this reason, neither the law of
misrepresentation nor the parties acting for themselves by contract
tend to find a negligence standard appealing in such settings.

320
ECONOMIC HARMS

2. The Scope of Liability: Duty

Supposing that the defendant has made an actionable negligent
misrepresentation, to whom may he be held liable? Here, what
amounts to duty or proximate cause becomes central. The courts
have long been concerned about the scope of various forms of
liability for negligence that does not cause bodily injury or property
damage, because of the unpredictable and potentially unlimited
extent of pure economic losses. As a consequence, although the
defendant may be held liable in appropriate cases to his client or
customer for negligent misrepresentation, liability has reached only
a little beyond those with whom the defendant is in privity of
contract.

In the paradigm case in this field, Ultramares Corporation v.
Touche, then Chief Judge Cardozo expressed in often-repeated
terms this concern about the dangers of “liability in an indetermi-
nate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class.’
Although the law may have all three of these concerns, in practice
the focus has been on the last. Ultramares and other similar cases
involve the common situation in which independent auditors are
paid to inspect and then to certify the financial condition of a
business. The owner or manager of the business misleads the
auditors by overstating assets or understating liabilities in some
way that the auditors do not detect. The auditors know that third
parties will see and rely on their certification—that is its purpose.
Of course, the primary wrong is committed by the party being
audited, who committed fraud. But typically he or his business is
completely or partly judgment-proof. The auditors are likely to be
certified public accountants covered by malpractice liability insur-
ance and with assets of their own.

The plaintiffs seeking a deep-pocketed defendant are third
parties such as investors or creditors who have lost money by
relying on the certification provided by the auditors. So they sue
the auditors for negligent misrepresentation. This is in effect an-
other of the “‘enabling torts’’ that were discussed in prior chapters.
Fairly early it was settled that if a defendant such as the auditor
had actual knowledge of the specific identity of a party who would
rely on its statement, then that party could recover even in the
absence of privity of contract. Since then the scope of liability has
expanded, but not very much. In most jurisdictions there can be
liability to more than one person who is not in privity with the
defendant, but only if that person is a member of a “‘limited group”’
of ‘‘actually foreseen’? individuals, though their specific identities

4. 255 N.Y. 170, 174 N.E. 441, 444 (1931).

321
TORT LAW

ordinarily need not be known by the defendant. In some jurisdic-
tions that group may in theory be larger, if only one individual in
the group (such a future owner in the chain of title to real
property) is ultimately likely to rely on and be injured by the
misrepresentation. This state of affairs is to be contrasted with
claims for actual fraud, in which liability extends further: to anyone
whose reliance was highly foreseeable.

There is no deep explanation for this limitation on liability for
negligent misrepresentation, any more than there is a deep expla-
nation for the limitations on liability for negligently-caused emo-
tional distress discussed in Chapter Eleven. The explanation is
largely practical. The courts’ objective is to permit the imposition of
liability to those beyond the boundary of privity, but to contain the
scope of that liability within manageable proportions under a rule
with sufficient texture to make results predictable. The rule extend-
ing liability to a “limited number of actually foreseen” individuals
does this. But if history is any guide, if over time the limits of this
rule erode it will have to be replaced with another more expansive
rule that also has sufficient texture to make results predictable.

C. Innocent Misrepresentation

Typically there is no liability for innocent misrepresentation
outside the contracting context. However, when one contracting
party has expressly or impliedly warranted to the other the truth of
a fact material to the transaction, then liability for breach of
warranty amounts to strict liability for innocent misrepresentation.
Benefit-of-the-bargain damages sometimes are awarded in such
cases. In contrast, when an innocent misrepresentation does not
amount to a warranty, the law is far less clear. Suppose that in
negotiations for the sale of my house I innocently misrepresent it to
be free of termites. In some jurisdictions the statement is not
actionable at all. In others the statement is actionable, but only the
equitable remedy of rescission or its legal equivalent, liability for
out-of-pocket loss, is available. Indeed, under some circumstances
the plaintiff in such a transaction may not obtain rescission but
may only recover the cost of repair.

These rules are unsettled largely because the expectations on
which they must be based if they are to work effectively also are
unsettled. We simply do not have uniform and firm standards about
responsibility for innocent misrepresentations. What is perceived as
a “‘warranty”’ or a guarantee will vary from individual to individual,
as will moral intuitions about what an innocent misrepresenter
ought to be required to do, if anything, to make things right. As

322
ECONOMIC HARMS

long as these intuitions vary so much from setting to setting, the
tort law rules governing liability for innocent misrepresentation
will remain unsettled, and will have to be specified by contract or
litigated on a case by case basis.

II. Intentional Interference with Contract

It is a tort to interfere intentionally with a contract between
two other parties or to induce breach of such a contract. On the
other hand, negligent interference with contract rights ordinarily is
not actionable, as we saw in the Chapter Eleven’s discussion of
negligent infliction of pure economic loss. Of course, other torts—
such as fraud, or false imprisonment, or others—may be committed
with the intent of causing a breach of contract. But the cause of
action for intentional interference exists even if the means of
interference is not itself an independent tort.

The modern tort of intentional interference derives from the
English case of Lumley v. Gye,’ in which the defendant induced an
opera singer to breach her contract to sing at the Queens Theater.
The complaint in Lumley alleged that the interference was done
with malice, and for some time it was unclear whether malicious-
ness was an element of the tort. It is now well-established that
maliciousness is not required. On the other hand, not every inter-
ference is tortious. To be tortious, the interference must be for an
‘“mproper’’ purpose. However, most interferences—including those
intended merely for the defendant’s economic benefit—are held to
be improper. Indeed, it would be more accurate to say that there is
liability unless the defendant had an especially “proper’”’ purpose,
except that this way of putting the matter inaccurately suggests
that defendant always bears the burden of proof on this issue. Some
of the purposes that are “‘proper’’ and that therefore exempt an
interfering defendant from liability have included preventing im-
moral behavior, and influencing a child not to marry the “‘wrong”
person. On the other hand, a boycott in service of the desire to
pressure a contracting party to take some collateral action—such as
settling a labor dispute—ordinarily is not a ‘“‘proper’’ purpose.

In recent years the commentators have disagreed about wheth-
er the tort of intentional interference should exist at all. On the one
hand, the theory of “efficient breach of contract’’ suggests that
sometimes it is value-enhancing for a contract to be breached and
for the breaching party to pay damages. On this view the tort
should not exist, since it inhibits efficient breach, for which the

5. 2El. & Bl. 216, 118 Eng Rep. 749 (Q.B.1853).

823
TORT LAW

plaintiff will be compensated by the breaching party anyway.’ On
the other hand, the kinds of on-going “‘relational’’ contracts (em-
ployment, commercial requirements or supply arrangements, etc.)
that are involved in the typical intentional interference action may
be best served by promoting cooperation rather than efficient
breach.’ Neither view has clearly prevailed or exercised much
influence on the courts.

III. Intentional Interference with Prospective
Advantage

It is not only a tort to interfere with contract, but also to
interfere intentionally with prospective economic advantage. Typi-
cally, though not always, such economic advantage is a possible but
not executed contract. In fact, prospective contractual advantage
(as distinguished, for example, from advantage that could be gained
from an inheritance or gift) is the typical interest protected by this
tort.

The major difference between this tort and intentional interfer-
ence with contract is that it is emphatically not a tort to engage in
‘fair’? economic competition that is designed to deprive a competi-
tor of a prospective contract and garner that advantage for oneself.
Thus, as in intentional interference with contract, whether the
interference is done for a “‘proper”’ purpose is key, but ordinary
competition is proper in the absence of an existing contract that
will be interfered with. As the Supreme Court of California put it,
the test is whether the defendant’s action was ‘“‘wrongful by some
measure beyond the fact of interference itself.’ Some forms of
