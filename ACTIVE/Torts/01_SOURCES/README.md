## De-duplication / Archiving Notes

- Duplicate import folders were moved out of `ACTIVE/Torts/01_SOURCES` into:
  - `Archive/law-school-torts/01_SOURCES_imports_2026-01-21/`
- A known duplicate outline file was removed from the active set:
  - `ACTIVE/Torts/01_SOURCES/past_outlines/Huang/Torts - Spring 2015 - Huang_MARY.docx` was archived because its extracted text matches `ACTIVE/Torts/01_SOURCES/past_outlines/Huang/Torts - Fall 2013 - Huang.docx` (minor whitespace-only differences).
