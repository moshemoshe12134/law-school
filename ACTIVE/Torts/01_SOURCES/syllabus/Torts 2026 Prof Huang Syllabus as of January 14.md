TORTS

Spring 2026

Professor Bert I. Huang

When  an  accident  occurs,  how  will  a  court  decide  who  should  pay,  and  how
much?  How does the common law assign liability for injuries, and why?   Which legal
principles  apply  broadly—say,  to  pharmaceuticals  as  well  as  massive  oil  spills—and
which are tailored for specific settings?  How do judges tend to analyze such cases, and
how can you convince one to rule in your favor?

These  are  questions  of  the  law  of  Torts.    In  our  course,  you  will  be  invited  to
consider not only these central  issues, but also the broader  perspective:  How do legal
conceptions of fault, compensation, and punishment differ from our moral intuitions or
social norms?  Who made up these legal rules and forms of reasoning, and why?  You
will  also  be  asked  to  think  critically  about  the  sources  of  legal  authority:    How  do
lawyers and judges read (and write) the different genres of legal texts?  What counts as
persuasive argument among legal audiences?

Welcome  to  the  course!    What  follows  are  notes  on  logistics  and  ground  rules.

Please read this carefully and refer to it during the semester.

Course  texts  and  assignments:    Instead  of  a  casebook,  we  will  use  a  series  of
reading  packets  that  are  designed  specifically  for  this  course  (and also less  expensive).
The only other required text is The Forms and Functions of Tort Law by Kenneth Abraham
(6th  ed.  2022)—be  sure  to  have  the  printed  copy,  not  an  e-book.    I  will  tell  you  the
reading assignments week by week,  via email.  A survey of  our topics is attached, but
your actual assignments will likely vary from this list.  The better approach is not to try
to read ahead, but rather to engage keenly with the topic of the moment.

Official  notes,  outlines, and recordings:    You  will  all  be  given  a  comprehensive
set  of  official  notes  for  our  course,  in  the  form  of  detailed  slides  from  our  Teaching
Fellows’ review sessions.  I review and approve each of these slides, word for word, and
you  can  consider  them  authoritative  for  purposes  of  our  course.    All  our  digital
chalkboards  from  class  will  also  be  shared  with  you.    In  addition,  near  the  end  of  the
semester, all our class recordings will be made available as you prepare for the exam.

Laptops and devices:  No laptops, tablets, or other devices are to be used in the
classroom, except for accommodations assigned by the Disability Services office.  In my
experience, many students have come to appreciate the focused and immersive learning
that  this  creates  for everyone.   Again,  all  our  official  course  notes,  digital  chalkboards,
and recordings will be shared with you.

Interactive discussion:  Our time in the classroom will be focused on developing
your skills in applying law to facts and in debating questions of legal design.  Every day,
you and your classmates will be making arguments and counterarguments—just as you
will be doing on the exam and in the practice of law.  To emphasize, our classes will not
be lectures.  By design, they will feel more like coaching sessions or music lessons.

Panels:    Each  of  you  will  be  on  call  one  day  per  week.    I  will  call  on  you  in  a
randomized  way  in  large  panels.    If  you  are  ever  not  feeling  up  for  being  called  on,
please  email  me  at  least  one  hour  before  class,  and  I  will  not  call  on  you  that  day.
Otherwise, you are expected to be prepared, just as you would be for a court appearance
or  for  a  meeting  with  a  client.    Please  treat  everyone  in  our  class  with  the  credit  and
courtesy you would show (and expect) in your future careers.

Absences:  The Teaching Fellows will  take attendance at the start of class every
day.  If you must miss class due to illness or a religious holiday, please email me.  Please
stay home if you may be contagious, and please do take good care of your health!

Grading:  Your grade will be based on the exam.  Thoughtful engagement in the
course, including  when on call, may help if  your exam score is on the border between
grades.  A pattern of showing up late or unexcused absences may lower your grade.

Practice  exam:    There  will  be  a  mid-semester  practice  exam.    This  exercise  is
required but will not affect your grade.  If you submit your answers on time, you will
receive individual feedback from our Teaching Fellows.

Office  hours:    Please  bring  your  questions  to  my  office  hours  (times  to  be
announced).  My office hours will be “open,” meaning there is no need to sign up—you
and  your  classmates  may  join  the  discussion  at  any  time,  and  you  should  feel  free  to
come and go.  You are welcome to attend even if you do not have any questions.

Teaching  Fellows:   Our superb  Teaching  Fellows  are  Theron  Herd,  Mark  Kava,
Bradley  Lockett,  Ryan  Ogasawara,  Feiyang  Peng,  and  Renata  Shammo.    The  TFs  will
hold regular review sessions as well as office hours.  In addition, please always feel free
to email any questions to me or the TFs.

Please let us know:  If you ever face challenges relating to health, mental health,
or  other  such  needs,  please  do  not  hesitate  to  reach  out  to  me,  our  TFs,  your  other
teachers, our Student Services team, the Disability Services office, or other resources for
support.    A  list  of  the  school’s  wellness  services  can  be  found  here.    My  email  is
bhuang@law.columbia.edu.  My faculty coordinator is  Sydney Stoller, and her email is
sbs2232@columbia.edu.  We all look forward to getting to know you!
