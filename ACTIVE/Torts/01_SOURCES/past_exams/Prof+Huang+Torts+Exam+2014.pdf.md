                                       Instructions

       This is a 3-hour in-class exam. The exam mode is “open.”

        You may use any course materials we assigned or distributed, plus any outlines or
notes that you or your classmates have prepared. You may not do outside research. You
may not consult with anyone during the exam. If a question seems unclear or if a key
fact seems to be missing, then please state your best reading of the question or your
sensible assumption about the key fact, and continue with your answer.

        The exam is designed to take slightly over 2 hours, thus allowing you extra time
to organize, review, rethink, and edit. Planning your answers before you start writing is
likely to be a very good use of time.

       Space is very limited and you will need to be concise. Please write in complete
sentences. You will be rewarded for clear organization, brevity, precise thinking, and
good writing. Using headings and signposts may help. Cite cases or other sources when
it makes your answer clearer. Do not use footnotes.

        Please supply a word count for each question. Please use the “Answer Separator”
function on Exam4. Include headings and signposts in the count. You must stay within
the limits: 1200 words for Question 1 and 900 words for Question 2.

       You should answer both questions. Each question will be worth 1/2 of the grade.
Please do budget your time carefully.

        Remember that your aim is to demonstrate how thoughtful and nuanced you can
be in using what we covered in class, along with any “facts” given by the exam, to craft
your arguments—and counter-arguments.

       I wish you the best of luck!

                                        Question I

                                    Limit: 1200 words


       The Griswold Center is world-renowned for pioneering research on infectious
diseases. It is located on a large medical campus near a university, along with other
research facilities and several teaching hospitals.

        One of the Center’s current projects focuses on antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This
team of scientists, the Daphne lab, has been testing methods for speeding up and slowing
down bacterial mutation rates. (The faster the mutation rate, the faster a population of
bacteria can develop resistance to antibiotics.) Among other scientific advances, this lab
is credited with creating the A3S1 strain of bacteria, whose unusually fast mutation rate
makes it very useful for experiments.

        The Center requires anyone or anything that may have come into contact with any
research-related microbial samples to be disinfected before leaving the premises. To this
end, it has developed disinfection protocols that well surpass federal regulatory standards.
Not wanting to take their work home with them, so to speak, the personnel at the Center
have always followed these protocols religiously. Among the protocols is the
requirement that all personnel take a shower as they exit the “red zones” (where the
biological samples are kept and the experiments are done); at the same time, their clothes
are disinfected in a separate chamber using ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Although the
other infectious-diseases labs on the medical campus use chemical sprays for disinfecting
clothing, the Center uses the more expensive UV system instead because its research
involves bacteria that may be resistant to antibiotics.

        Many of the Center’s scientists also conduct clinical research involving actual
patients. Much of this clinical research is done through partnerships with the teaching
hospitals on the medical campus, including Mercy Hospital.

        An outbreak of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections has recently spread among
the patients at Mercy Hospital—and the pathogen has been identified as a variant of the
fast-mutating A3S1 bacteria created by the Daphne lab. Moreover, internal investigation
by the Center has discovered colonies of this variant on the clothes of those scientists
from the Daphne lab who also do research at Mercy. To much surprise among the
investigators, further testing has shown that this variant readily survives the UV
irradiation the Center uses for disinfecting clothing—making it the first and only variant
of the A3S1 strain (and indeed the first known type of bacteria) to show such hardiness.

       Over a hundred patients at Mercy Hospital have shown signs of infection so far.
Because the infections were initially responsive to standard antibiotics, by the time the
hospital staff noticed the growing antibiotic-resistance, at least two hundred patients had
been exposed; all have been properly isolated and are being monitored. Making matters

worse, however, is the fact that many doctors at Mercy have tended to acquiesce to a
patient’s request for antibiotics even when the patient is told that the drugs will do no
good, such as for viral infections; one predictable and perverse result of such
overprescribing (which runs against the hospital’s official policies) is the suppression of
other types of bacteria in those patients—making this new antibiotic-resistant strain even
more likely to thrive.

        The impact of this infection on any given patient varies depending on a number of
individual risk factors, such as age or preexisting health conditions. Most badly affected
are those patients whose immune systems were already in a weakened state; many of
these patients have a measurably worse prognosis for survival, although so far none have
died. More generally, virtually all of the infected patients are now in a worse health
condition relative to the hospital’s usual benchmarks for recovery from the patients’
original ailments.

                                           ***

        You are an attorney for the Griswold Center. Knowing of your expertise in tort
law, the general counsel assigns you to the legal team that is monitoring the crisis,
saying: “Word has gotten out about the link between our Daphne lab and the infections
at Mercy. Several infected patients have now hired a well-known plaintiff’s lawyer.
Although our internal investigation continues, and some facts have yet to be sorted out,
we must begin to assess our possible exposure to tort liability.”

         He continues: “I need you to prepare a rough-and-ready, preliminary analysis.
How might these or other patients pursue tort claims against us? What theories or
approaches might they use? And what arguments could we use in response, to minimize
our potential liability? As there have not yet been any cases in this state about the
liability of a research lab for harm caused by wayward microbes, we may be dealing with
issues of first impression—so please do point out any good arguments that either we or
the potential plaintiffs could make about how this state’s tort law should treat the present
situation.”

         Prepare this short memo. If you need to make any assumptions about the
facts or the law, please do so and state them clearly. (You may assume what you
wish about where your state stands, on any issues of law about which jurisdictions
differ.)

                                       Limit: 900 words


       You are a law clerk for the chief justice of the state supreme court. During the
summer break in arguments, she calls you into her office and says: “One of our longer-
term projects here at the Court is to catalog possible problems in the common law as well
as possible solutions. I’d like for you to help with this project, in the following way.”

        She continues: “One thing that has been troubling me for some time, about the
law of tort liability and tort remedies, is that it often seems haphazard, neglectful, or
confused about whether and how to take third parties into account—that is, members of
society beyond the parties in a given dispute. (The Philip Morris decision is perhaps a
well-known example.)”

        She then specifies: “Will you please identify two other existing tort doctrines,
theories, or approaches that (one might argue) do not properly take third parties into
account—either in determining liability or in assigning a remedy? For example, can you
think of instances where tort law or theory should—but doesn’t—take into account the
interests of third parties, the role of third parties, or the law’s effects on third parties? (Or
where third parties are considered, but are given too little or too much weight?)”

        She emphasizes: “For each of the two doctrines, theories, or approaches you
identify, please do propose a possible alternative or solution. (Your proposals may be
novel, or may already be in use in some contexts.) Please then point out the good
arguments for and against your proposals. No research is needed, for now. Just be
imaginative!”

       Prepare this short memo. Please remember to address two topics (though
you do not need to give equal space to each).
