                                         Instructions

       This is a 4-hour in-class exam.

        You may use any course materials we assigned or distributed, plus any outlines or
notes that you or your classmates have prepared. You may not do outside research. You
may not consult with anyone during the exam. If a question seems unclear or if a key
fact seems to be missing, then please state your best reading of the question or your
sensible assumption about the key fact, and continue with your answer.

       The exam is designed to take 3 hours, thus allowing you extra time to organize,
review, rethink, and edit. Planning your answers before you start writing is likely to be a
very good use of time.

       Space is very limited and you will need to be concise. Please write in complete
sentences. You will be rewarded for clear organization, brevity, precise thinking, and
good writing. Using headings and signposts may help. Cite cases or other sources when
it makes your answer clearer. Do not use footnotes.

       Please supply a word count for each question. Include headings and signposts in
the count. You must stay within the limits: 1400 words for Question 1 and 1200 words
for Question 2.

       You should answer both questions. Each question will be worth 1/2 of the grade.
Please do budget your time carefully.

        Remember that your aim is to demonstrate how thoughtful and nuanced you can
be in using what we covered in class, along with any “facts” given by the exam, to craft
your arguments—and counter-arguments.

       I wish you the best of luck!

                                         Question 1

                                     Limit: 1400 words

        Horizons Hospital is a leading innovator in the use of “smart” implantable
medical devices. More than 1,000 of the hospital’s patients now live at home with such
an implantable medical device (IMD). These devices fall into two broad categories: heart
defibrillators (to counteract abnormal heart rhythms); and neurostimulators placed in the
cranium (to control seizures) or else along the spinal cord (to control chronic pain).

         The IMDs are supplied by various manufacturers, but the hospital installs its own
proprietary software onto each device. This software is among the hospital’s most notable
innovations. It syncs the devices with the hospital’s central databases. This allows each
physician to be alerted to her patients’ health changes (as detected by the device) while
they are at home; and she can remotely send new commands to their devices as needed.
The syncing also allows the hospital to monitor device status, such as battery life, and to
install software upgrades. From a patient’s point of view, these communications are
effortless and invisible: his device can function offline, but it syncs automatically with
the hospital whenever he is within the range of his home Wi-Fi network.

        Cybersecurity is a top priority for the hospital. Earlier this year, after a string of
hacking incidents at other medical facilities, the management at Horizons Hospital
directed its software team to assess the security of the communications between the IMDs
and the hospital. After a thorough analysis of the competing risks and costs, the software
team easily concluded in a confidential report that the IMD software should be updated
with better encryption. The good news was that the team could remotely install the
upgrade on all devices with only a two-minute interruption in the syncing of other data;
nobody would notice, and there would be virtually no chance of any health impact. The
management approved the plan, and the software upgrade was remotely installed onto all
patients’ devices without notifying the patients or their physicians.

        In the week after the upgrade, a number of patients using IMDs at home checked
into the hospital: eleven patients with the cardiac devices (all complaining of irregular
heartbeat); and nineteen with the neurostimulators (seven having suffered seizures, and
twelve noticing a surge in chronic pain). These numbers were slightly higher than in a
typical week. The treating physicians began to notice that the central databases had not
logged any recent data from these patients’ devices. Suspecting that the devices were not
syncing, or were otherwise failing, the physicians promptly reported these cases and put
the patients on alternative plans for monitoring and care. Meanwhile, the management
sought answers from the software team.

       After a week of investigation, the software team discovered a bug—a coding
error—in the upgraded software they had installed. This bug prevented any IMD from
uploading any data to the hospital, whether about health status or about device status. The
software team, badly embarrassed, scrambled to fix this bug. In order to avoid alarm (and

                                                                        Prof. Huang, Fall 2015


because patients and physicians had not been told about the software upgrade to begin
with), the hospital’s top management instructed the software team not to tell anyone
about this error until after they had found a fix.

        The error was hard to fix; it took two more weeks. Meanwhile, more patients who
were using IMDs at home had been checking into the hospital—and at increasing rates.
Among them were three patients with the cardiac devices who had each suffered a stroke,
which can occur when untreated heart arrhythmia allows blood to clot abnormally; these
patients were placed in intensive care. Over time, word had also spread among the
hospital’s physicians about the syncing problem, and they all began to check on their
outpatients by phone, to get health updates the old-fashioned way.

        Finally, four weeks after the original upgrade, the fixed software was installed
remotely on all patients’ devices. At that point, the hospital proudly announced to its
patients that their devices were now all protected with the latest encryption—noting in
passing that a syncing problem during the upgrade process had also been resolved.

        You are an attorney for Horizons Hospital. A few days after the announcement,
the general counsel steps into your office with a worried look on her face. She closes the
door and says: “We’ve been hearing that about a dozen of our patients so far, with a
variety of IMDs, have been in touch with a well-known plaintiff’s lawyer in town. It
sounds like this has to do with those syncing problems in the past month or so.”

        She continues: “Many facts about that episode have yet to be sorted out, but we
must begin to assess our possible exposure to tort liability. I need you to prepare a
preliminary analysis. How might these or other patients pursue tort claims against us?
How might we respond? No need to do any research yet. Just sketch for me the potential
arguments and strategies on both sides. And if there are any crucial facts we should be
sure to find out, this is a darn good time to say so.”

         She adds: “There haven’t been any cases yet about the liability of a hospital for
software glitches like this, so please don’t be shy in suggesting arguments about how our
state’s tort law should treat these facts. We’re probably dealing with some issues of first
impression here.”

        Prepare this memo. If you need to make any assumptions, please do so and
state them clearly. (You may assume what you wish about where your state stands,
on any issues of tort law on which the states differ.)

                                         Question 2

                                     Limit: 1200 words

        You are a law clerk for the chief justice of the state supreme court. One day, just
before the court’s winter break, he calls you into his office and says: “Among the
virtues—and joys—of working with law clerks is that they bring in such a fresh
perspective every year. And this year I’ve noticed that you are especially willing to
challenge and think creatively about even the most familiar legal doctrines. So I’d like for
you to help with one of our longer-term research projects, looking afresh at our tort
system today.”

        He explains: “As you’ve surely noticed, sometimes our tort system aims for
proportionality or tailoring or accuracy (i.e., not too much, not too little, but just right).
By contrast, at other times it simply takes a binary (i.e., on/off, all-or-nothing) approach,
without even trying to calibrate. The most obvious examples of each approach,
respectively, might be comparative negligence and contributory negligence.”

       He then specifies: “Please identify two other examples—one that takes the former
approach and one that takes latter approach. You may draw your examples from the law
or procedure of tort liability and torts remedies; from underlying legal concepts; or from
your observations about how the tort system operates. (And your two examples don’t
need to be related to each other.)”

       He continues: “For each of your two examples, please give the best arguments for
why the current approach makes sense. Then give the best arguments you can imagine for
why an opposite approach might make sense.”

        He adds a final word: “If multiple examples come to mind, just choose the ones
that you think are the most subtle, least obvious, or most interesting to analyze. Be
imaginative!”

       Prepare this memo. Remember to address two examples (one of each).
