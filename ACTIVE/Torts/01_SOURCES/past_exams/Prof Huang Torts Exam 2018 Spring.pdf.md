                                           Instructions

       This is a 4-hour in-class exam.

        You may use any course materials we assigned or distributed, plus any outlines or notes
that you or your classmates have prepared. You may not do outside research. You may not
consult with anyone during the exam. If a question seems unclear or if a key fact seems to be
missing, then please state your best reading of the question or your sensible assumption about the
key fact, and continue with your answer.

        The exam is designed to take 3 hours, thus allowing you extra time to organize, review,
rethink, and edit. Planning your answers before you start writing is likely to be a very good use
of time.

       Space is very limited and you will need to be concise. Please write in complete sentences.
You will be rewarded for clear organization, brevity, precise thinking, and good writing. Using
headings and signposts may help. Cite cases or other sources when it makes your answer clearer.
Do not use footnotes.

       Please supply a word count for each question. Include headings and signposts in the
count. You must stay within the limits: 1400 words for Question 1; 1200 words for Question 2.

       You should answer both questions. Each question will be worth 1/2 of the grade. Please
do budget your time carefully.

       Remember that your aim is to demonstrate how thoughtful and nuanced you can be in
using what we covered in class, along with any “facts” given by the exam, to craft your
arguments—and counter-arguments.

       I wish you the best of luck!

                                           Question 1

                                       Limit: 1400 words

        For generations, the fishing families of Arden Bay have relied on the bounty of the
Atlantic Ocean for their livelihoods. Hundreds of these families still operate commercial fishing
boats in the bay and surrounding waters. The most valuable harvests are of greenfish and of
stripefish, both unique to this region. Because these two species behave differently and grow to
different sizes at maturity, most families have traditionally specialized in catching one or the
other species; in a few cases, different families have merged operations and thus can handle both
kinds of fish.

        This fishing community prides itself on resilience in the face of hurricanes, wrecked
boats, and other misfortunes at sea. A new danger has emerged, however, that is confounding the
community: an invasive species called the leopardfish. How they arrived here is a mystery, but
the damage that leopardfish can do is all too clear. Because they have no natural predators in
these waters, and because they avidly feed on the eggs and the young of other species,
leopardfish pose an existential threat to entire populations of native fish—including greenfish
and stripefish—and thus to the fishing community as well. Since the first sightings of leopardfish
a decade ago, there has already been a sharp decline in the catch volume of both greenfish and
stripefish in the area.

       It was welcome news, then, for the fishing community to hear that the Arden Bay
Conservancy (ABC), an independent non-profit in the region and a pioneer in conservation
science, would be putting its resources into minimizing the leopardfish threat. Although the ABC
and the commercial fishing community are not on cooperative terms, having long opposed each
other on most policy issues, this decision by the ABC seemed to generate a touch of goodwill.

        The ABC’s strategy was to deploy an artificial intelligence and robotics system called
Navigators for Ecology and Marine Life, or NEML: a fleet of small self-navigating submarines,
each the size of a penguin, that not only can monitor marine biology and ocean conditions, but
can also track schools of leopardfish—and chase them away from the reefs that protect the eggs
and the young of other species. The submarines’ activities are guided by a central artificial
intelligence system that crunches vast amounts of data about marine ecosystems like this one and
also internalizes all the relevant scientific literature. Remarkably, neither monitoring nor other
inputs are needed from human operators. The ABC’s scientists simply instructed the NEML
system to pursue a mission of “protecting the marine health and biodiversity of the Arden Bay
ecosystem against the invasive leopardfish,” and let it run autonomously.

        Three years into the NEML system’s deployment, both the ABC and the fishing
community started to notice something odd. Populations have been bouncing back for many of
the threatened species, including the greenfish—and yet, the stripefish population seems to have
collapsed. Worried that there may be a glitch in the system, the ABC has halted all NEML
operations and retrieved all the small submarines.

                                                                              Prof. Huang, Spring 2018




        Figuring out exactly what the central artificial intelligence program was “thinking” is
infeasible because it was processing far more information than human investigators can sort
through in any reasonable amount of time. Still, the investigators have established that the
NEML system was actually operating smoothly, in executing a specific conservation plan that its
central artificial intelligence had decided upon: Recognizing that the invasive leopardfish were
here to stay, it calculated that the best possible outcome for overall marine health and
biodiversity in this altered ecosystem was one in which most species recovered, but a few others
(including the stripefish) fell to low levels or died off. Thus the NEML system had been
directing its submarines to focus on protecting the eggs and the young of most other species—
but to do nothing for the stripefish.

                                                ***

        You are an attorney for the ABC. The director calls you to her office and says: “As you
know, Arden Bay’s commercial fishing community is pretty upset about the collapse of the
stripefish population—and they’re saying it’s our fault. I’ve now heard that many of them have
been in touch with a plaintiff’s lawyer in town.”

        She continues: “Many facts have yet to be sorted out, but it’s not too early to try to assess
our possible exposure to tort liability. I’d like for you to do a very preliminary analysis. How
might they pursue tort claims against us? How might we respond? No need to do any research
yet. Just sketch for me the potential arguments and strategies on both sides. And if there are any
crucial facts we should find out, including about how the NEML system works, please say so.”

        She adds: “We’re really in uncharted waters, so to speak, as there haven’t been any torts
cases involving artificial intelligence systems. But as you know, we’re in a jurisdiction where the
high court is not shy about developing new common law. So please also feel free to suggest
arguments about how current tort principles might be stretched or adapted to this situation (and
please make it clear when you’re doing so).”

       Prepare this memo. If you need to make any assumptions, please do so and state
them clearly. You may assume what you wish about where your state stands, on any issues
of law about which the states differ.

                                            Question 2

                                        Limit: 1200 words

        You are a law clerk for the chief justice of the state supreme court. One fine day in May,
she stops by your office and says: “As the summer will be a quiet season for the court, I’d like
for you to help with one of our longer-term research projects. I’m hoping you’ll bring a fresh eye
to it; my colleagues and I have been judges for too long to do this on our own. You’ll see why.”

        She explains: “One curious thing about tort law is that so much of it seems to rely on
people’s common sense or on their moral intuitions—and yet, so many of its specific features
also seem to have evolved in ways that diverge from common sense or moral intuitions. The duty
to warn or rescue may be the most familiar case of the latter.”

         She then specifies: “Will you please identify two other examples—from the law of torts
or torts remedies—of doctrines, concepts, procedures, principles, or theories that differ from
what many people (who are not lawyers) would likely hold as common sense or as a moral
intuition?”

        She continues: “For each of your two examples, would you also address these questions:
First, what are some possible reasons that it could actually be a good thing for there to be such a
gap or tension between the law and what many people would ordinarily think? And what are
some possible reasons that this gap or tension could be a bad thing? Second, would you predict
that for some people, their common sense or moral intuitions might shift to align more closely
with the law’s perspective, if they knew more about what the law says or how the law works?
Why or why not?”

        She suggests: “If many examples come to mind, please choose the two that you think are
the least obvious or the most interesting to discuss. Whenever possible, please try to use specific
scenarios or hypotheticals to illustrate your points.”

       Prepare this memo. Remember to address two topics.
