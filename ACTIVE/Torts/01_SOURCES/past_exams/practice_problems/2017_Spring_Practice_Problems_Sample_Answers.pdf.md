Question 1 – Sample Answer 1

(Number of words: 1195)



Negligence claim

Before the accident

LH will argue that LDC was negligent even before the accident, failing to take reasonable
care of its building under the circumstances. From 1996 until the date of the accident in
2015, LDC didn’t inspect relatively inaccessible plaster ceiling above the drop ceiling
and made no repairs to it. Given that the building was old (1968) and that LDC
reconfigured the building for use as a casino in 1990, it was foreseeable—LH would
argue—that the original 1968 plaster ceiling might fall off. And but for the fragments of
the original 1968 plaster ceiling which had fallen through the new drop ceiling, LH
would not have been badly cut even after the fall.

LDC will contend that it put reasonable care, pointing out that it hired John LePore (JL)
first in 1991 to do the repairs and in 1996 to install a new drop ceiling on the first floor to
improve the efficiency of heating and cooling the premises. In both of the instances, JL
did not notice any signs of damage of weakness in the plaster ceiling. Yet, regarding
1996 installment, LH will point out that the purpose was mainly to improve the heating
and cooling issue and that it was not LDC’s effort to resolve the safety issue.

LDC will also argue that the whole chain of events (original ceiling falling off and LH
happening to fall down at the very place with the fragments, cutting himself badly) are
too remote. LDC will try to frame this whole accident as one of those freakish accidents
that are just not foreseeable and unpredictable. To support this argument, LDC will use
Gary Nies’ (GN) reports that there was not any indication of weakness in the original
ceiling in the remainder of the original plaster ceiling. Yet, LH will contest this evidence
as GN came up with the conclusion only by using spotlight and poking his head through
the opening into the space between the original and the drop ceiling. LH would argue for
more rigorous examination.

Under BPL analysis, the probability of original ceiling falling off was quite likely and
foreseeable (building was old and it was reconfigured) and magnitude of harm resulting
from the fall off was substantial (there was “heavy traffic on the adjoining street”). Yet,
the burden of additional precaution was not that high; it could have put more careful
attention on the original ceiling or it could have made a new drop ceiling more safely in
order to prevent possible fall off from the original ceiling, since it was installing it
anyway for other purposes. Thus, the burden seems lower than PL, suggesting LDC was
negligent.

In sum, LH’s argument seems more persuasive.



During the accident

LDC will argue that LH was contributory negligent in failing to carry his cane on his way
to washroom. Had LH brought his cane, he presumably would have noticed the makeshift
chain in front of him, which made him fall down. LDC will also point out that in this
case, LH was in a better position to know the risks involved with blind man walking
without his cane and by doing so, he assumed the risks. LDC will also add that by
surrounding the place with a chain, it took a preventive measure. To come up with
alternative measures that can protect a blind man without his cane would be prohibitively
expensive.

LH will argue that the casino was open to the public “but not particularly heavily
trafficked.” Thus, LH’s decision to go to washroom without his cane was not
unreasonable. He also proceeded at a measured pace and with one arm extended in front
of his chest as a precaution. Thus, LH will contend that he took reasonable care and was
not negligent. LH will further argue that since LDC was aware, or should have known,
that it had a blind contractor in its premise, LDC should have provided adequate warning,
not just mere a makeshift chain.

As the courts are moving toward from all or nothing contributory regime (Maryland) to
pure comparative (California) or modified comparative (Wisconsin) regime, LH will
likely to be able to recover form LDC, even if LH is partly negligent. In this case, LH’s
negligence does not seem to account for more than 50% of the total fault, so LH will
recover under both pure comparative or modified comparative regime.



After the accident

LH will strongly argue that LDC was negligent in failing to have intubation kits and
personnel trained to use them. While no evidence relating to its industry practice (first-aid
practices and resources of mid-size casinos) is presented, LH will point out that the
medical stations of large hotels all have those kits and personnel. LH will also note the
particular nature of casino (gambling and its possible harmful effect on people) makes the
place arguably more necessary to have those medical kits and personnel. LDC will argue
that the fact that its employee on-duty at the medical station promptly responded to the
situation shows LDC took reasonable care, and that having intubation kit is not one of the
industry practices. Even if it was, industry practice is only used as supporting evidence
and not determinative.



Duty to rescue / special relationship

In general, there is no general duty to rescue. The fact that David Turner was a nurse or
Jane Goul (JG) was a doctor is not really relevant because LH was not their patient. If he
was, they would have a special relationship and there would have been a duty. But when
JG started to perform CPR, inducing reliance, she started the process of rescuing,
possibly preventing others from helping. Thus, she had a duty to rescue non-negligently.
The possible claim that she did not call an ambulance immediately can be made, but it
won’t be deemed negligent as performing CPR was presumably more important at the
time.

Marilyn Swanson (MS), the employee who was on-duty at the medical station at the time,
will also be immune from any liability as it was LDC’s policy not to have an intubation
kit on the premise.



Damage

Considering three phases of negligence claim, LDC is likely to be held liable for its
negligence and LH will be able to recover. Compensatory damages may be awarded for
LH’s loss of present or future earnings and medical expenses. Punitive damages may be
awarded depending upon the degree of malice involved, but in this case, there seems to
be no malice involved in LDC’s part. LH’s future earnings can be reasonably computed
based on past income stream of the candy stand he operated and life expectancy of LH.
Even if LDC was negligent only in failing to have intubation kit and personnel required
to perform the task, LDC would be still liable under the lost chance doctrine (JG asserts
that there is a small chance that LH might have survived had such equipment been
available). Even if this is the case, LH would still recover the amount that corresponds to
the value of the decreased chance of survival resulting from the LDC’s negligence.
Question 1 – Sample Answer 2

(1196 Words)

       The casino had a duty to Hale for two reasons. First of all, the casino has a duty to
take reasonable care not to injure others. Second, the casino also has a duty to prevent
harm from happening where it has created a risk. By having a pile of tiles on the floor,
especially because the defendant kept the tiles there for a number of hours in order to
photograph them for insurance, the defendant created a risk to others. Therefore, the
defendant has a duty to prevent harm form coming to others due to this risk.

       The next question is whether the casino was negligent. Plaintiff will argue that the
casino was negligent for failing to have the ceiling checked. Reasonable management
would have checked on the upkeep of the building. However, Defendant will argue that it
reasonably upkeeps its building, and that checking a ceiling that has demonstrated no
problems is more careful than is reasonable. Plaintiff will argue that the burden was low,
since Nies was easily able to check the plaster after the accident. The casino will argue
that this this burden is significant. There were no issues with the ceiling at the time of the
remodel, so it is a high burden for the casino to have to check the ceiling ongoing – the
casino cannot continually check every piece of the architecture of the building that
doesn’t show any risk of failure. Plaintiff will argue that there was a high probability that
the ceiling would eventually have a problem because as buildings age, the infrastructure
deteriorates. While in year one without a check the probability might be low, by year 20
without a check, the probability is substantial. The casino will argue in return that it was a
low probability that the ceiling would collapse. No other areas of the ceiling were weak
or sagging, and there was no water damage. This collapse was a freak occurrence.
Plaintiff will argue that the potential harm of the ceiling falling in was significant –
serious bodily injury and even death. The casino will argue that the only foreseeable
harm was a few falling tiles, which were unlikely to hurt anyone seriously. No other harm
was foreseeable, especially once the casino roped off that area. The court should look to
see if there are any statues or regulations requiring the casino to check the roof or
maintain it. If there is such a statute, the casino is per se negligent. Even without a statute,
I think that the casino was negligent because the burden of checking the ceiling at least
once in 20 years is low, and the potential harm from a weak ceiling is great.

       Plaintiff will argue that the casino was negligent for not removing the tiles from
the floor. The burden of removing the tiles was low –a few hours of work by maintenance
staff. The casino could also make an announcement that there was a hazard, which is a
very low burden. The probability of someone tripping on the tiles was significant and the
potential harm was great. The defendant will argue that the burden also includes giving
up its insurance claim. If businesses cannot preserve evidence of damage for the few
hours they require for an insurance claim to be filed, they cannot benefit from insurance
and are significantly burdened. The casino will argue that the probability of someone
tripping was low, because the tiles were roped off and people would steer clear of them.
Furthermore, a trip and fall should not lead to any significant harm. I don’t think the
casino is negligent for having the tiles on the floor, given that they roped off the tiles.
However, their failure to warn was negligent because that burden is negligible and could
have avoided harm.

       Finally, the casino might be negligent for not having an intubation kit. It is a low
burden, and seems to be the custom for similar business in the area. However, the
probability of needing such a kit is very low. The harm from not having a kit seems great,
however the court must consider that the harm is only relevant where there is a medical
professional that could use the intubation kit. Therefore, the probability that the harm
from not having a kit would happen is actually low, because there is almost never a
qualified professional available to use the kit. If the casino is found to be negligent on
this point, the court might consider only making it liable for the loss of chance that the
plaintiff suffered, because the doctor stated that the plaintiff would only have had a small
chance to live if there had been a kit. Because no reliable statistics about the plaintiff’s
survival chances with and without the intubation kit, so the court should probably adhere
to the general rule in which the defendant would be responsible for the full damages from
the plaintiff’s injury, if all the other requirements for liability are met.

       If the court finds the casino negligent, the defendant will argue that the plaintiff’s
death was beyond the scope of liability. The tiles falling and hitting someone is the
foreseeable risk from having a faulty, unchecked ceiling. If the plaintiff had been hit in
the head by a falling tile, this would be foreseeable. However, tripping on the safety
barrier and falling on the tiles is not a foreseeable harm. The plaintiff will argue that one
of the harms that is most likely presented by tiles falling onto the floor is the danger
presented by debris on the floor. The tiles fall onto the floor, foreseeably creating a
tripping hazard. I that the risk of people tripping and injuring themselves was a
foreseeable harm within the risk and therefore the defendant should be liable for
plaintiff’s injuries.

       The defendant will try to bar the plaintiff from recovering some or all damages by
asserting that the plaintiff was negligent as well. While the plaintiff’s contributory or
comparative negligence is considered under a reasonable person standard, that standard is
tailored to take into account the fact that the plaintiff had a disability. The plaintiff did
not use his cane on his walk to the bathroom, which the casino will argue made him
negligent. He should have known that he needed the cane to avoid obstacles. The plaintiff
will rebut that he knew the way to the bathroom and he acted in a reasonably safe way.
The risk posed by the situation was very unlikely, and generally any tumbles the plaintiff
took because he didn’t have his cane would be minor. He could not have expected debris
to be on the floor in the middle of a building. However, the defendant will argue that the
burden of bringing the cane was so low, that the slight risks of not having the cane still
would have been avoided by a reasonable person. I think that the plaintiff was negligent,
but only slightly. If this jurisdiction uses pure or modified comparative negligence, the
plaintiff should still be able to recover, but not for the full amount. If this jurisdiction uses
contributory negligence, the plaintiff will not be able to recover.
Question 2 – Sample Answer 1

(753 words)

       One advantage of allowing plaintiffs to recover twice from multiple sufficient
tortfeasors is that this is optimal deterrence in that it forces tortfeasors to internalize the
cost of their negligence. They cannot discount the cost of their externality via the other
tortfeasor’s own liability. This only applies where both defendants were negligent. Where
one of the actors was negligent and the other was not, it makes sense to force the
negligent defendant to pay and let off the non-negligent one, because only the negligent
one needs to be deterred. However, if the negligent defendant’s tort came second, perhaps
it seems unjust to force him to pay, because he did not actually cause the harm. I think in
such cases, the court should use a standard, and look at how certain we are that the
negligent act would have been sufficient to cause the damage, how much time elapsed
between the non-negligent and negligent sufficient causes occurring, and the degree of
negligence and how much it needs to be deterred.

However, this reform may disincentivize plaintiffs from taking due precautions to prevent
damage from coming to their property. Plaintiffs may be more reckless with their own
property because their chances of recovery, or even a windfall are higher. Furthermore,
from a civil recourse perspective, this reform overcompensates the plaintiff. Why should
the plaintiff get twice his due, simply because two people were negligent?

This analysis would need to significantly change if the plaintiff or an “act of Gd” was one
of the sufficient causes. If the plaintiff was negligent, the only normative goal for
penalizing the defendant is deterrence. In such a case, the defendant could be made liable,
but the damages could go into a fund to pay plaintiffs in situations where the defendant is
not held liable despite his negligent conduct. For instance, in situations where children or
animals cause harm to a plaintiff but are not held liable because we evaluate them using a
different standard. The plaintiff should not recover, because the court also has an interest
in deterring the plaintiff’s negligence. Assigning liability to both the negligent defendant
(by having him pay into a fund to address other torts) and the negligent plaintiff (by not
compensating him for the defendant’s negligence) would accomplish the desired
deterrence and also address the court’s interest in loss distribution. This type of fund
made out of the windfall from holding both defendants liable would accomplish
deterrence, maintain the plaintiff’s incentive to protect him or herself from harm, and also
allow the court (or another government body) to compensate victims where the
government excuses negligent defendants for policy reasons.

One critique of holding defendants liable even when they are not the but-for cause of the
plaintiff’s harm is that it may lead to a feeling of injustice. Defendants may feel like they
are being made to subsidize payments to victims to whom they have no relationship.
Therefore, to force tortfeasors of mutually sufficient causes to both pay full amounts of
damages, we will have to modify the way we think about tort law. It will become more
focused on retribution than remuneration for the victim. Therefore, perhaps the court
should assign liability to the defendants only in terms of how much harm their tortious
actions could have been expected to cause. Because the philosophical underpinning for
holding both tortfeasors liable is largely deterrence, we only need to deter the risks that
the defendant could have foreseen. Therefore, if a small fire (“fire one”) which was
negligently set got unexpectedly out of hand and burned the house down at the same time
that a huge, negligently set bonfire (“fire two”) burned down that same house, perhaps
the person who set fire one should be held liable only for the damage that the small fire
could have been expected to create. In contrast, the person who set fire two should be
liable for the whole cost of the damage, because the damage was a foreseeable result of
that fire. This model is plagued by information costs and the impossibility of determining
how much damage was foreseeable. Furthermore, it leaves open the question of whether
the defendants’ liability should be so limited even when neither fire was large, and by
paying only for foreseeable damage the plaintiff would not have his damages fully
compensated. Because of these difficulties, I think the court should still force each
defendant to pay for the full amount of the damage the tort actually caused, even though
this may result in over-deterrence.
Question 2 – Sample Answer 2

(671 words)




The court is being asked to consider whether to apply a new damages standard for harm
caused by multiple parties, each of who’s action is sufficient to cause the entirety of the
harm. While there may be merits to allowing Plaintiff to recover in full from each
tortfeasor, on the whole, this policy seems misguided.




The primary argument for implementing the proposed standard is likely to be deterrence
based. The thinking goes that if each Defendant ends up being responsible for less risk
than they created, then they are not sufficiently deterred from engaging in the same type
of behavior in the future. While it is true that harsher penalties can lead to more
deterrence, there are several reasons why the current rule sufficiently deters actors from
engaging in harmful behavior.



First, the rule of joint and several liability acts as a way of ensuring that each Defendant
alone is responsible for the entirety of the harm which they caused. If a co-defendant
cannot afford to pay for their share of damage caused, the defendant is liable for the
entirety of the damages. It is unlikely that defendants will rely on their codefendant’s
liquidity in considering whether to engage in tortious conduct when there is a chance that
the entire burden of payment will fall on their shoulders. This argument is weekend in the
case where there is a plethora of actors. If forty tortfeasors light fires that burn down a
barn, each might be secure in the knowledge that they will likely have to pay only a
fraction of the damage that was caused to plaintiff. This will mean that there could be
little economic deterrence in cases where many tortfeasors are involved.
Another consideration that a purely economic deterrence argument fails to take into
account is that there are other deterring factors that keep potential tortfeasors from
engaging in harmful conduct. The American court system is public, and the stigma of
having been found liable for tortious conduct and the social repercussions that come from
such a condemnation might have a deterring effect regardless of the economic burden
imposed on a defendant. Secondly, litigation is often expensive, and the cost of having to
defend oneself is also a deterrent. So while each defendant under the current rule may not
end up paying for the total damage done to plaintiff, there are other important deterrent
forces in play.



From a corrective justice perspective, the proposed rule might be more favorable. If a
focus is placed on restoring the balance between plaintiff and the tortfeasors which
harmed him or her, then a partial recovery from each defendant might not be enough to
restore such a balance. However, this assumed that a plaintiff will hold each tortfeasor in
a multiple-sufficient-causes scenario responsible for the entirety of the harm done to
them. It is unlikely that this is psychologically true. More likely is that a plaintiff adjusts
the level to which her or she holds each tortfeasor accountable in proportion to the
number of participants that engaged in activity that caused the harm. If that is the case,
then holding each tortfeasor accountable in whole overcorrects the balance in the
plaintiff’s direction and does not bring the balance in line with corrective justice’s goals.




From a compensatory and distributional standpoint, it also makes little sense to enforce
the proposed rule. Plaintiff has suffered a discreet harm, and there is little reason from a
compensatory view that they should recover for more than that harm. The fact that
multiple fires might have caused the harm independently does not increase the amount of
harm done from an economic perspective. Distributional questions answer how damages
should be spread out, and therefore are less helpful in deciding the proper level of
damages to award. As stated above, even in the more “limited” recovery rule, there are
ways to design the distribution of damages, such as the joint and several rule, which
distribute liability evenly in most cases yet still ensure that plaintiff can obtain a full
recovery.
