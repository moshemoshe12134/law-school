Negligence

L potentially breached a duty of care in three instances: failing to properly update the
ceiling to prevent the plaster from falling, failing to quickly remove the ceiling fragments
from the hallway before H tripped on them, and failing to maintain an intubation kit on
the premises. In all of these instances, L likely did not act negligently.



Maintenance of ceiling

       Plaintiff’s strongest argument is that L acted negligently because it did not inspect
the ceiling for 19 years (1986-2005). Given the fact that a collapse of the casino ceiling
could cause a significant loss of life and property, H would argue that L breached its duty
of care. Furthermore, the installation of the drop ceiling did not make it unreasonably
difficult to inspect the plaster ceiling, as evidenced by straightforward process conducted
by Gary Nies. Had L maintained the ceiling, it would not have fallen in the first place.

       Several factors cut strongly against the plainttiff’s argument. First, in the 28 year
period between construction and the final inspection (1958-1986), the ceiling showed no
signs of damage whatsoever. Deterioration does not occur in an instant, but slowly over
time. Therefore, L had no reason to assume that the plaster would deteriorate in a faster
period than 28 years after 1986. Second, the burden of checking the ceiling became
significant, once the drop ceiling was installed. Though Nies demonstrated that he could
check the rest of the ceiling, it is unclear that his inspection, which consisted of shining a
spotlight around the ceiling and examining from afar, was sufficient. A sufficient
examination would likely be much more burdensome. Given the fact that the rest of the
ceiling showed no signs of deterioration, the evidence indicates that L did not act
negligently in relying upon the sturdiness of its ceiling, rather than hiring an expensive
examiner on a more frequent basis. Granted, if industry practice or custom indicated that
ceilings in public establishments should be examined more frequently, L might have been
negligent.



Care of debris

Plaintiff would also argue that the L acted negligently because it failed to clear or
adequately secure the fallen debris that H fell over. The strongest factor pointing in H’s
favor on this claim is the fact that the casino and its staff knew that H was blind. They
also likely knew the H used that particular corridor to go to the bathroom. As such, H
tripping over the unexpected object was a highly foreseeable event.

However, several factor cut against the plaintiff’s argument in this case as well. Here, the
expected harm of leaving the debris is particularly low. The debris was marked off by a
chain, which would adequately prevent most people from being hurt by the debris. Only a
blind person or a child would potentially be injured despite the chain being there.
Children do not enter casinos, therefore the only harm that could foreseeably come from
the debris would happen to a blind person. Additionally, the burden on the casino to
remove or further secure the debris is particularly high in this case. In addition to the
physical cost of removing the debris, moving the debris would disturb the site as
evidence, increasing the administrative costs of insurance claims. Given that the injury
was inflicted upon a blind person, additional signage would have had no effect. Perhaps a
higher chain would have been a helpful. However, such a precaution could equally raise
the chance that a stray child in the casino would run under the chain and injure herself.
Contributory or Comparative Negligence of H

H himself acted negligently by walking down the hallway without the use of a cane or
other type of assistance for a blind person. The fact that such an action was his “habit”
does not excuse his negligence. Just because a person drives at 90 mph every day, does
not excuse his actions on the day that he collides with another car. In fact, had H used his
cane instead of his arm, he would have avoided the injury altogether. Assuming this state
follows a contributory negligence standard, H’s relative negligence in this case is
particularly high. This is particularly true given the fact that he is in the best position to
prevent the injury to himself. He has the most information about his own abilities and can
mitigate harm to himself at the cheapest cost.



Treatment of Hale after the accident

H also would argue that L’s failure to maintain an intubation kit on the premises was
negligent. As an initial matter, there is some force to L’s counterargument that it owed no
duty to provide medical assistance to H. However, because H was injured on L’s
premises, L acquired the duty to mitigate the harm caused. The question is how far that
duty extends. It likely does not reach the duty to maintain an intubation kit on the
premises.

L clearly met its duty to mitigate the harm caused with its quick response. Within three
minutes of being notified, casino medical personnel responded in a competent manner
and phoned an ambulance. Personnel even brought an airbag and oxygen mask.
Furthermore, L’s policy of not having an intubation kit in the casino because emergency
workers were not trained to use the kit is completely justifiable. To hold L negligent for
not maintaining an intubation kit despite not having personnel able to use the kit would
encourage venues to keep equipment on hand that could potentially be dangerous when
used Contributory negligence
In sum, plaintiff’s claim that L negligently maintained the ceiling is strongest. It’s claim
that L negligently managed the debris is weaker and its claim that L negligently
maintained a policy of prohibiting intubation kits is virtually without merit. All of these
negligence claims would likely fail because there was no breach of duty.



Causation

Arguendo, assuming these duties were breached, proximate cause would likely cut off
liability regarding the first claim, but not the second two.

But for the correct maintenance of the ceiling, the debris would not have fallen and H
would not have tripped, gone into shock and died. L’s action is the cause-in-fact,
however H’s death was not a foreseeable harm within the risk of the negligent action. The
potential harm that can result from an unmaintained ceiling would be that debris could
fall on a patron or employee. The harms that would affect a blind employee would be an
unforeseeable consequence of negligently maintaining the ceiling. Granted, the fact that
an employee worked in the casino could indicate otherwise.

The fact that L failed to take care in disposing of the debris clearly caused the injury to H.
Even if the shock and death was not a foreseeable extent of harm, it would likely fall
within the scope of liability because it was a direct effect of the initial injury.

Though the chance was “small,” the third claim would likely come within the scope of
liability, assuming that the harm was a loss of chance of survival and that such a claim
was cognizable in our state.

Negligence

Determining whether the Lucky Day Casino acted negligently requires evaluating
whether the company employees exercised the level of care that a reasonably prudent
person would. There are several actions taken by the Casino that may, separately or
collectively, constitute negligence.

   1) Failure to remove plaster

One issue is whether the Casino’s decision to put up the chain fence around the plaster,
rather than remove it, constituted negligence. This is a question of whether the Casino
took the level of care that a reasonable person(s) would have taken under the
circumstances.

The Learned Hand negligence calculus, which weighs the burden of the untaken
precaution—simply removing the plaster chunks and thus eliminating the need for the
fence—against the foreseeable probability of the injury multiplied by the size of the loss.
This untaken precaution does not appear particularly burdensome—it would have
required the employees to take the photographs and measurements for insurance purposes
between 5 am and 9 am. This seems particularly reasonable when compared to the
gravity of the loss—Mr. Hale’s life. However, the probability of this particular injury
occurring was low—it required the perfect confluence of factors and sequence of
events—particularly given the sparse human traffic in that particular area of the Casino.

Conversely, the foreseeability of injury may be much higher when Mr. Hale’s blindness
is taken into consideration. Knowing that there was a blind man who operated a shop less
than 75 steps away would amplify the foreseeability probability of an injury occurring.
Proximate Cause

If the jury determines that the Casino was negligent in failing to remove the plaster, this
action also likely satisfies the proximate cause requirement. The danger that someone
may fall and hurt themselves is precisely why this activity would be considered negligent
in the first place, and thus is a harm within the risk. Although the extent of the harm—
death—may not be entirely foreseeable, courts typically are guided by the egg-shell
doctrine, and hold that the extent of the harm does not need to be foreseeable.

Public Policy

The Court should consider whether holding the Casino liable would deter individuals
from allowing disabled people to use their facilities. Though it may be illegal to explicitly
exclude disabled individuals from the premises, companies may be find making
charitable offers to the disabled, like the Corporation’s willingness to allow Mr. Hale to
use the shop almost free of charge, less attractive when the threat of liability is attached.



   2) Failure to Inspect the Ceiling

An additional theory could be that the Casino’s failure to inspect the plaster ceiling for
nearly 20 years constituted negligence. Mr. Nies’ testimony would suggest that an
inspection may not have prevented the accident, since he reported that there was no
indication of weakness or damage to the ceiling upon his inspection. The relative
inaccessibility of this older ceiling would add to the burden of inspecting or replacing it,
shifting the negligence calculus toward reasonableness. Failure to inspect the ceiling is
not a cause in fact, since even if the Casino had inspected, they probably would not have
repaired it since it showed no visible signs of damage.

Failure to Repair
A stronger case can be made that the Casino was negligent in not replacing an old ceiling.
Indeed, Mr. LePore’s testimony indicates that the accident likely was caused by the wear
and tear over time. The Casino knew that the ceiling had not been replaced for decades,
since it bought the building in 1980, and could have replaced the old ceiling when new
drop ceiling was installed. Additionally, a reasonably prudent business owner would
recognize that heavy traffic on the adjoining street could cause damage to the structure of
the building that would warrant repair.

Proximate Cause

Whether failure to repair the ceiling was a proximate cause depends on how narrowly we
define the accident that took place. Presumably one of the risks of not repairing a ceiling
is that it will fall and lead to injury to the public. However, the risk that someone would
trip on the remnants from the ceiling and go into shock is less foreseeable. If we look at
the specific chain of events that occurred to Mr. Hale, rather than the general potential for
injury to the public, it is unlikely to be within the scope of liability for this act.



   3) Intubation Kit
   a) Breach:

Another issue is whether the Casino’s failure to have the intubation kit constituted failure
to exercise reasonable care. The fact that medical stations of large hotels typically have
intubation kits available and employees trained to operate them is not dispositive of
Casino’s unreasonableness, but it may indicate that it is reasonable to expect hospitality
businesses to have this equipment. Additionally, the fact that the casino had a medical
station may point to the foreseeability of accidents occurring on the grounds.

Alternatively, the Casino may have acted reasonably in not supplying the kit, given that it
did not have medical staff trained to use them. Given that tort law does not impose an
affirmative duty to rescue but does require someone who begins a rescue to exercise
reasonable care, having untrained personnel using the kits may be riskier and invite
liability. Unqualified rescuers may exacerbate a medical emergency, or may deter others
from calling 911 because the situation appears to be under control.

While the Casino could have elected to train individuals to properly use the kits, this
seems to be a high burden to place on the Casino. Particularly given that guests do not
typically spend the night at the Casino, it seems unreasonable to expect the business to
prepare for any possible emergency. However, one could argue that having a medical
station at all may create unjustified reliance on their ability to save patrons. It may be
safer for the casino to simply call 911 rather than a medical station that is ill-equipped to
deal with many emergencies.

   b) Cause-in-fact:

Failure to have the intubation kit on-site cannot properly be categorized as a but-for cause
of Mr. Hale’s death, considering it would have only slightly increased the chances of Mr.
Hale’s survival according to Dr. Goul’s testimony. While perhaps a case could be made
for loss of chance, this seems a poor fit for that doctrine, given the difficulty in
determining how much this factor could have affected Mr. Hale’s chances of survival,
and the short time frame.



Contributory Negligence

The defendant may argue that Mr. Hale was contributorily negligent because he did not
take sufficient precautions given his disability. He may have been the cheapest cost
avoider of the accident, since he knows his disability and is in the best position to take
steps to prevent injury. However, Mr. Hale’s slow pace and extended arm represented
reasonable steps for a similarly situated blind person. Particularly given that he had
walked this route many times and never before encountered the plaster or fence, it is not
reasonable to expect him to be aware of the risk.
Practice problem 2 – sample answer 1

       Because of the significant benefits - namely deterrence and justice - that would
arise out of a new system under which each tortfeasor in a case of multiple sufficient
causes is held fully liable for the damages caused to the plaintiff, this is a positive
development in the law that the highest court of this state should adopt.

       Under either system, one party will receive either a “lucky break” or a “windfall”
if there are multiple sufficient causes stemming from the actions of multiple tortfeasors.
Under the current system, a defendant whose tortious conduct happens to constitute only
one of several multiple sufficient causes will be lucky enough to only have to pay her pro
rata share of the damage, though she might just as easily have been responsible for the
entire share had the other tortfeasors not come into play. The plaintiff, meanwhile, is still
compensated fully (but not excessively) for the damage caused to him, regardless of how
many multiple sufficient causes were responsible.

       Under the proposed new system, a plaintiff would benefit from multiple
tortfeasors. If a plaintiff were able to recover fully for her damages from each of the
individual tortfeasors responsible for a factual cause, plaintiff might receive a windfall
from the accident. Yet each tortfeasor is no longer let off the hook because they had the
good fortune to be one of several equally as negligent persons.

       Deterrence, a core aim of imposing torts liability, would be better served by
adopting the new system. Under the current system, a potential tortfeasor may take into
account the number of other careless parties that could harm each potential victim in the
vicinity. This could significantly lower the “L” in the BPL equation, thereby lowering the
maximum costs, or “B” that the individual tortfeasor is willing to shoulder in order to
prevent possible harm. This “strength in numbers” approach simply allows tortfeasors to
benefit from the creation or encouragement of additional tortfeasors, rather than
incentivizing him to invest in precautions that will reduce the risk or devastation of
tortious conduct.
        The new approach will also simplify cases in which one of the factual causes in a
set of multiple sufficient causes is not negligent or tortious. Instead of grappling with the
inconsistency of only holding a single tortfeasor in a multiple sufficient causes case
responsible for the full damage when other sufficient causes were not negligent or
tortious, yet allowing him to reduce his liability when the other sufficient causes were
negligent or tortious, each tortfeasor is held to the full liability, no matter the nature of the
other sufficient causes.

        The new system should not conflict with a comparative negligence system. The
result would be the same as if there was only one tortfeasor - if plaintiff was responsible
for 45% of the damage, then each tortfeasor would individually be liable for 55% of the
damage. Although this does seem to provide more of an inequitable windfall for plaintiff
than if plaintiff bore no responsibility (why should plaintiff potentially recover more than
100% of the damages if she herself was responsible for a portion of it?), it really is no
different than if plaintiff bore no responsibility. Either way, plaintiff is entitled to recover
for each tortfeasor’s liability - preventing each tortfeasor from getting a “lucky break”
when there are multiple sufficient causes. The deterrence effect is even more pronounced
in such comparative negligence cases, since the old regime would have held one of
several joint tortfeasors liable for only a small fraction of the total damages if plaintiff
bore some responsibility, causing the “L” in each tortfeasor’s equation to shrink even
more.

        Although each system will allow for one party to receive or keep more than their
“fair share” of liability in cases of multiple sufficient causes, it seems that plaintiffs are
the more appropriate party to receive such a benefit. The harmed party, who in many
cases did nothing wrong, was damaged, and had to bring a tort claim through the entire
judicial process should be the “lucky” party if they are so unlucky as to be a victim of
tortious conduct. Defendants, whom the law should discourage from being negligent,
deserve no such treatment. (701 words)

The proposed reform would not properly serve the aims of tort law, and thus should be
rejected in favor of the status quo, in which a plaintiff can recover fully only once. This
conclusion does not turn on the possibility of the plaintiff’s own negligent conduct or the
non-tortious nature of a cause. Under the principle that recovery should always be
apportioned according to fault amongst joint tortfeasors, plaintiff negligence or non-
tortious causes would not impact defendant liability.




Corrective Justice and Compensation

One of the primary aims of tort law is to provide corrective justice and compensation.
Thus courts aim to render the plaintiff whole after a wrong has been committed against
them. But in rendering a plaintiff whole, the point of corrective justice and compensation
is not to unnecessarily penalize a defendant. The justice of tort law is at its heart
corrective, rather than punitive. Thus, to allow a plaintiff to recover multiple times would
not only be unduly harsh to the defendant, but also fail to provide corrective justice.



Deterrence and Incentives

Such a policy would provide negative consequences for the tort aims of providing the
appropriate amount of incentives and deterrence in society. By apportioning recovery
amongst the defendants tort law provides crucial information to defendants about the
implications and response of society to their actions. A defendant becomes aware of the
level of risk that their conduct poses to society by the amount of damages that are set
against them.
However, should damages be posed in full against a defendant who was only partially
responsible injury, the defendant is deterred disproportionately against resuming that
activity in the future. Yet, a fundamental concept in tort law is that some risks are worth
taking, which is captured in Learned Hand’s formula of B>PL. Tort law does not aim to
deter all harmful or risky behavior. Rather, it accepts that some injury or risk is necessary
in society. But to maintain this principle, the level of deterrence must be proportional to
the risk created. Imposing the full recovery against each defendant, regardless of their
particular degree of fault, would likely cause society to be overly cautious, and deter
behaviors that are necessary to society.

Similarly, a disproportionate recovery scheme would provide adverse incentives to
plaintiffs. The windfall possible in such cases could potentially cause a floodgate of
litigation for plaintiffs who have potential claims against multiple defendants. Thus, such
a policy would cause society to not only be overly cautious, but also overly litigious.



Moral Judgment

Nevertheless, an aim of tort law that could arguably benefit from such a reform is moral
judgment. Certainly, there is tortious conduct that is so morally reprehensible, or the
consequences of which are so dire, that imposing a disproportionate burden on
defendants seems perfectly acceptable. For instance, Hymowitz v. Eli Lilly, where the
defendant pharmaceutical companies negligently caused cancer in hundreds of plaintiffs,
conduct which can universally be condemned. Or Summers v. Tice, where two defendants
simultaneously shot at the plaintiff, causing injury. Yet, the court in Hymowitz made sure
to state that even in a case as deplorable that, the liability of a defendant should not
exceed that of their fair market share. And in Summers v. Tice, the defendants were not
held to be each liable for the full amount of damages, but rather that the burden fell on
them to prove that the other was at fault. Thus, even in the extreme cases, the morality
aim does not, and should not, trump the correct justice or deterrence aims of tort law.
And indeed, the morality aim itself isn't well served by allowing a windfall for a plaintiff
and disproportionate liability for a defendant.



Risk Spreading

A final aim of tort law is to spread the risk of negligent conduct. The proposed reform
likely would aim to act like strict liability by incentivizing defendants to take further
precautions and cost spread due to the higher burden potentially imposed on them. But
it’s not clear that such a reform would have strict liability effects in this area. It could
possibly dissuade any risky conduct in the future, forcing some defendants out of an
industry, concentrating risk, rather than encouraging others to internalize the costs. Thus,
a change defendant liability could have no effect in this area, or even concentrate risk
further.
