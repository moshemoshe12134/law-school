                                      Instructions

        This required but ungraded exercise is meant to give you some practice at writing
out answers to both a fact-pattern question and a policy question like ones you might find
on the exam. Based on the answers you submit, you will each receive individual
feedback from one of our TAs about your exam-writing approach and style.

        Please send your answers (in a single document) by 11 PM on Friday, March 10,
to torts2017huang@gmail.com with the subject line “Practice Problems.”

       The word limits for each question are listed below. The two questions together
correspond to roughly 2.5 hours of exam time, but you are welcome to take as long as
you would like for this practice exercise.

       You should answer these questions focusing on the ideas, concepts, doctrines, and
modes of analysis that we have covered in class. You are welcome to bring in fresh
thinking that reaches beyond our class discussions. But you should not spend time on
any cases, doctrines, or other legal materials that we have not covered.

      (The original fact pattern comes courtesy of Prof. Blasi, and I have modified it to
match what we have covered so far in our course.)

                                     Word limit: 1200


        LeRoy Hale, a blind man and an independent contractor, operated a candy stand
on the premises of the Lucky Day Casino in Sparks, Nevada from June 2012 until
November 2015. As a gesture of support for persons with disabilities, the Lucky Day
Corporation charged Mr. Hale a nominal rental fee of one dollar per year to set up his
candy stand in a part of its Sparks casino that was open to the public but not particularly
heavily trafficked. On November 16, 2015, shortly after 9 a.m., the hour when the casino
opened, Mr. Hale left his work station to go to the men’s room, which was located some
seventy-five steps down a corridor from his candy stand. As was his habit for this short
trip, which he took several times each day, Hale left his white tapping cane in his stand
and relied on his familiarity with the area to navigate the walk to the bathroom. As he
always did when walking without his cane, Mr. Hale proceeded at a measured pace and
with one arm extended in front of his chest so as to give himself early warning of any
object in his path.

        On this particular trip, however, that precaution was to no avail. While walking
down the corridor, Hale stumbled over a pile of plaster chunks which had fallen from the
casino ceiling at 5 a.m. that morning and were lying in the center of the corridor
surrounded by a makeshift chain. The chain had been put in place by casino employees
in order to preserve the site so that photographs and measurements of the fallen ceiling
could be taken for purposes of insurance claims and potential lawsuits. This chain
tripped Mr. Hale, causing him to fall into the pile of jagged debris. In this fall, Mr. Hale
was badly cut in his right leg and began bleeding profusely.

        Passersby shouted for someone to summon first-aid for Mr. Hale, who appeared
to be going into shock. Several patrons of the casino ran to Hale and began to assist him.
Among the first to reach him was David Turner, a critical care nurse, who quickly made a
tourniquet of his undershirt and placed it around Hale’s leg to reduce the loss of blood.
Mr. Turner was soon joined by his wife, Dr. Jane Goul, a pulmonary specialist. When she
arrived on the scene, she found that Hale was exceedingly pale, unresponsive, with a very
faint pulse. Without delay, she began to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (“CPR”)
on Hale in order to counteract the effect of shock on his circulation.

        Soon thereafter, Laird Schaefer, a security guard employed by Lucky Day Casino,
appeared. He immediately called the casino medical station. Marilyn Swanson, the
employee who was on-duty at the medical station at the time, rushed to the aid of Mr.
Hale within three minutes of being summoned. As soon as Swanson arrived, she
instructed the security guards to call for an ambulance. She brought with her an airbag,
oxygen, and an airway to connect the airbag with the oxygen source. She did not,
however, bring an intubation kit to the scene. When Ms. Swanson first arrived, Dr. Goul
asked her for an intubation kit but was told by Swanson that it was Lucky Day’s policy
not to have an intubation kit on the premises because the emergency workers on duty at
the casino medical station, none of whom were registered nurses or licensed paramedics,
were not trained to insert tubes into patients as a means of facilitating their breathing.
Swanson proceeded to help Dr. Goul in performing CPR on Hale while the airbag was
employed to assist his breathing. Specifically, Swanson placed the airbag, connected to
an oxygen source, over Hale’s face while Dr. Goul and Nurse Turner took turns doing
chest compressions.

       These first-aid efforts were unsuccessful. Hale stopped breathing and died.

        Hale’s wife and children, who were not present at the casino that day, sued the
Lucky Day Casino. At trial, the plaintiffs introduce evidence which establishes that the
building that houses the Lucky Day Casino was built in 1968 and was purchased by the
Lucky Day Corporation in 1990, at which time it was reconfigured for use as a casino.
The defendant stipulates that prior to opening for business in 1991 it contracted with John
LePore to repair portions of the plaster ceiling of the first floor after the removal of some
partition walls. At trial, LePore testifies that at the time he did the repairs in 1991 he did
not notice any signs of damage or weakness in the plaster ceiling. In 1996, the plaintiffs’
evidence shows, the defendant installed a new drop ceiling on the first floor of the
building to improve the efficiency of heating and cooling the premises, again hiring Mr.
LePore to do the work. (The original plaster ceiling remained in place above this new
drop ceiling.) While carrying out this job, Mr. LePore testifies at trial, he did not notice
any problems with the plaster ceiling. Several employees of the defendant testify, and
company records confirm, that from 1996 until the date of Mr. Hale’s tragic accident in
2015 the management of the casino did not inspect the relatively inaccessible plaster
ceiling above the drop ceiling, was unaware of any problems with the plaster ceiling, and
made no repairs to it.

        The evidence introduced at trial establishes that the jagged debris on which Mr.
Hale fell and badly cut himself were fragments of the original 1968 plaster ceiling which
had fallen through the new drop ceiling, creating the pile over which Hale stumbled.
LePore estimates in his testimony that the piece of the original plaster ceiling that fell
through the drop ceiling and shattered upon striking the floor measured two feet by five
feet. The section of the ceiling from which this piece fell was not near the areas he had
repaired in 1991, Mr. LePore testifies. He speculates that the ceiling collapsed due to its
age and the effect over time of vibrations caused by heavy traffic on the adjoining street.

        Gary Nies, the contractor who repaired the casino ceiling shortly after the
accident that led to Mr. Hale’s death, also testifies at the trial. He reports that before he
patched the ceiling at the point where the piece of plaster broke loose, he inspected the
remainder of the original plaster ceiling. He accomplished this by removing selected tiles
of the new drop ceiling and poking his head through the opening into the space between
the original and the drop ceiling. With the use of a spotlight he was able to examine the
full expanse of the original ceiling. He determined that the plaster was not sagging in any
other area of the ceiling. Nor was there any indication of water damage or other
weakness in the original ceiling, Nies testifies.
        Dr. Goul testifies that while administering first-aid to Mr. Hale she requested an
intubation kit because she believed that endotracheal intubation (inserting a tube down
the patient’s throat into his upper airway leading to the lungs) would be the best way to
restore his breathing capacity. She asserts that there is a “small” chance that Mr. Hale
might have survived had such equipment been available. Plaintiff’s evidence establishes
that the medical stations of large hotels have intubation kits available and personnel
trained to use them. Plaintiffs submit no evidence relating to the first-aid practices and
resources of mid-size casinos like Lucky Day that are operated independently of a hotel.

        After the submission of all the evidence introduced by the parties, the jury returns
a verdict for the plaintiffs. The defendant appeals.

        You are a judge on the panel of the appeals court assigned to this case.
Please draft a brief memo to your fellow judges sketching your analysis of the key
issues that arise in this case. Be sure to present any good arguments on all sides.
You may assume what you wish about where your state stands on any questions of
tort law on which the states differ; and you may assume that your court is willing to
modify tort law doctrines when there is such a need. If you must make any other
assumptions about the facts or the law, please do so and state them clearly.
                                   Practice Question 2

                                 Word limit: 800 words


        You are a law clerk for a justice of the high court in your state. In a case before
the court, multiple fires converged to burn down the plaintiff’s house, reminding you of a
classic story from 1L Torts class. The justice seeks your counsel on an issue being
pressed in this case:

        In a case of multiple sufficient causes, should each tortfeasor be individually
liable for the full amount of the harm to the plaintiff?

       Under current state law, as you know, a plaintiff can recover the full amount of
harm only once; this amount is then apportioned among the tortfeasors. But under the
proposed reform, the plaintiff would be able to recover multiple times, once in full from
each tortfeasor.

        The justice asks you to explain the pros and cons of the proposed reform, in light
of the aims of tort law. She further instructs that if your views turn on whether any of the
multiple sufficient causes is non-tortious, or on whether one of the causes is the
plaintiff’s own negligent conduct, you should explain why.

        Prepare a memorandum for her. You are welcome to discuss how this
reform might intersect with other areas of tort law. Assume that your state follows
the Restatement Third on questions of causation-in-fact. For your convenience,
several relevant sections are appended below. (If your analysis depends on your
state’s scheme for apportioning damages, you may assume one of your choice, or
you may assess the reform under different schemes.)
                                        Appendix


From the Restatement Third:

§ 26 Factual Cause

       Tortious conduct must be a factual cause of harm for liability to be imposed.
       Conduct is a factual cause of harm when the harm would not have occurred absent
       the conduct. Tortious conduct may also be a factual cause of harm under § 27.

§ 27. Multiple Sufficient Causes

       If multiple acts occur, each of which under § 26 alone would have been a factual
       cause of the physical harm at the same time in the absence of the other act(s),
       each act is regarded as a factual cause of the harm.

Comment d. One cause tortious, the other innocent.

       This section [§ 27] applies in a case of multiple sufficient causes, regardless of
       whether the competing cause involves tortious conduct or consists only of
       innocent conduct...
