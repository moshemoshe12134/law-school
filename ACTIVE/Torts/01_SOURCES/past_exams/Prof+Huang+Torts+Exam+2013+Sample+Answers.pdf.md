Torts Exam Fall 2013 – Prof. Huang

Question 1 – Sample Answer 1


                                      Exploding Server

The Ariels will seek to show that Rocky Mountain Edison (RME) was negligent in for
failing to inspect their server over four years: the industry standard was to inspect
annually. Custom is not dispositive (Carroll Towing) but the fact that something is
customary is strong evidence indicating the foreseeability of harm resulting from not
taking that precaution. Further, in general the fact that it is customary to inspect
connections every year indicates that the majority of the industry believed that the burden
of doing so was less than the potential harm that could result from not doing so. RME
may try to argue a specific reason why inspecting every year was extremely
burdensome - perhaps this particular connection was in a particularly hard to reach area -
but because there is evidence showing that similar events have caused both people and
animals to be electrocuted, a jury is likely to find RME negligent.

That the failure to inspect connection was the cause-in-fact of the injuries to the Ariels
property is straightforward in this instance. Four years passed between the installation of
the wire and the fallen wire: RME likely would have noticed the improper connection
during one of those inspections. RME may argue, however, that the Ariels comparative
negligence should significantly reduce the amount of possible liability. The Ariels
operated an electronic business, yet it does not seem from the facts presented that they
had installed any type of protection to prevent just this type of damage in the event of an
electrical problem. We should collect further evidence about the kind of precautions the
Ariels took to prevent this and similar accidents: surge protectors protect against surges
from electrical storms as well as surges based on power company problems.If there was
no protection, a jury is likely to find significant contributory negligence on the part of the
Ariels.

Finally, was the failure to inspect proximate cause under the Restatement? There is
evidence that similar accidents have caused the failure of hospital equipment, so it seems
reasonable to assert that RME should have been able to foresee harm to other types of
sensitive electronic equipment if similar accidents occurred.

The Ariel family might seek damages for cost of replacing their server, as well as
damages for the economic harm they assert they faced as a result of the server failure. It
is not unprecedented for plaintiffs to recover for economic harms that are suffered
simultaneously and as a result of physical harms (532 Madison Avenue). If plaintiff's can
prove economic harms (perhaps by showing the number of clients they had before and
after the incident, and the usual amount of profits they make during a week) they may be
able to recover for them.
                                       Satellite Dish

The Ariels may seek to recover against RME for the damages to their satellite dish. The
Ariels must show that RME was negligent in allowing the "leak" of low levels of voltage
onto the property of the Rosalinds. A court is unlikely to find any negligence here: even
properly functioning power transmission towers (FPTT) sometimes leak, and the RME
tower does seem to have been properly functioning and well-maintained. The burden of
further precautions is probably high, because almost all FPTT leak voltage, thus
preventing this could require a redesign of the system. The Ariels might be able to show
that the power company owed them an affirmative duty to warn that the voltage was
leaking in their property. The leaking is not an uncommon thing, and it has been known
to affect the behavior of animals, so farmers with more aggressive animals, like bulls,
could be in a substantial amount of danger created by RME. If an affirmative duty to
warn were imposed on RME, the Ariels would have a much stronger claim.

RME may assert that the Ariels were comparatively negligent. They bought property next
to a yak farm, and never constructed a fence between their property and the Rosalinds.
The Ariels might argue that 'reasonable care' did not require this because Yaks are not
aggressive, chewing the satellite was highly unusual behavior for a yak, and the families
close friends. The cost of building a fence is quite low, however, and the potential
damage of allowing a large animal to wander through one's property is quite high and
quite likely, because animals do not have to be aggressive to unintentionally cause
damage. This would be a close question, but I think a jury is likely to find some
negligence on the part of the Ariels.

Further, there is significant doubt about whether the voltage leak was either the but-for or
proximate cause of the damage to the satellite dish. A court could potentially hold that the
Rosalinds - in not warning their neighbors, whose property was not protected by a fence -
of the increasingly odd behavior of their yaks were a superseding cause. This would turn
largely on the issue of whether the behavior of the Rosalinds, and their yaks, were so
unforeseeable to RME that the chain of causation is broken.

Overall, the Ariels are unlikely to recover for the damage to the satellite dish.


                                    Nuisance/ Injunction

To get an injunction against the power companies emission of low-level voltage leak, the
Ariels must show that the leak represents a substantial and unreasonable interference with
the use and enjoyment of their land. A court is unlikely to find the interference to be
substantial unless further research can show additional consequences of the leakage than
its mild affect on animals. For instance, if the leakage changes human behavior, or causes
discomfort. As it stands, a fast and cheaper solution would be to have a fence erected
between the property of the Rosalinds and the Ariels, so that the yaks cannot cause
damage on the Ariels property. The Rosalinds might be more successful in a nuisance
action, as they are experience a direct interference with their use of the land as a yak farm.
Further, a court is unlikely to find that the interference is unreasonable. RME has kept the
power transmission tower (PTT) well-functioning ever since the collapsing line incident.
The interference is not such that a reasonable person cannot be expected to endure it.
Further, the Ariels moved to town because of the power company service: this is
evidence that the power company was making use of the land before the Ariels. Although
coming-to-the nuisance is not dispositive, it is a factor to consider.

If the court does decide to grant relief, it is unlikely they will issue an injunction. The
value of the company in providing electrical service to the community, and the cost of
moving their PTT or preventing the leakage, far outweigh the minor inconvenience that
the voltage leak causes the Ariels. Any relief granted will likely be in the from of
payments from the power company to the Ariels, in order to compensate them for the
interference. Another option is to have the Ariels pay the power company the costs of
preventing the voltage leak, such that they could stop the leak if it was worth it to them.
Question 1 – Sample Answer 2

A. Incident 1

Because of a lack of intent to enter, Ariel-fam will hit us on negligence. They have a
strong case. (Strict liability is unlikely; power lines are very common usage and these
risks can be reduced to a reasonable level with due care.)

We might first argue that RME is a quasi-public service (like ConEd) that merits
protection. Really, this goes to a limit on liability after negligence is proven, and we
would have to prove that crippling liability will ensure. I doubt we can. We might argue
that this would set a precedent that would allow too many website owners to recover
against us for gaps in power. But Ariel-fam is not arguing some sort of freak power
outage that affected a whole resort. Rather, they focus on a limited act of negligence that
affected only two plots of property.

We have little ground to suggest we took due care. Not only was it probably us who
attached the power line improperly, but we did not inspect it for four years. Considering
the potential for a power line to cause significant damage (and the high chance a
negligently attached wire would detach), not taking this low burden seems unreasonable.
Custom weighs against us as well, suggesting that annual inspections would be far more
reasonable. And since this is the "main route" for power, it seems even more important
that we inspect it. We will not win on this.

An improperly-attached power line falling off is a highly foreseeable harm-within-the-
risk of negligent attachment and inspection. The exploding server seems to have been a
direct result of the stray voltage (a result the reasonable power company would have
expected). Indeed, similar accidents are "known" to have similar outcomes. We will be
liable for the server, but we can likely argue that a downed website is, proximately,
unforeseeable. First, Ariel-fam is a family in a resort town. Not the kind of group, nor the
place, to host an always-on website. They live next to yak farmers; not exactly a high-
tech locale. But Ariel-fam might argue that the website is not a type of harm, but rather a
larger extent of harm, that is, an eggshell server. But this seems tenuous. We could
foresee electric items exploding; not servers in particular. Eggshell server implies we had
at least some foresight that the website might go down. We did not. Though website hosts
have to say "99.9%" uptime so that they avoid liability, we do not have that kind of link
with the website here.

We will pay for the server, likely not for the outage.

B. Incident 2

Now our equipment is maintained and checked properly. Ariel-fam will likely move to
trespass and nuisance. Trespass is a much weaker argument, relying on a very significant
extension of "physical entry" (akin to Martin) that I doubt the court will buy. They would
have to accept radio waves from cell towers, too. Ariel-fam might argue that the power
leaves a physical "residue" like metal particles, but as declaring this a trespass would
allow a preventative injunction, I doubt a court wishes to dim the lights on a whole town.
They should not extend trespass to these situations.

Nuisance, though, is stronger. Ariel-fam will argue that stray voltage is a foreseeable
result of power lines, as is the effect on yaks (fuzzy cattle). We may be able to suggest
yaks are a superseding cause, entirely unforeseeable. But they are likely not unusual for
the resort town, and yaks chewing on things seems exactly like what a shocked yak does.
Our better argument is that the utility outweighs the gravity of the harm, and so the stray
voltage is reasonable. There is huge social value from power lines (including many jobs
in the small town), power is highly suitable even for a resort town, and it is unclear what
could be done to avert the problem. (If there is a quick fix that does not require taking the
lines down, that would be relevant.) On the other hand, the harm is minor, is easily abated
with a fence, and website hosting is not typical for a resort village. Ariel-fam might argue
826(b) regardless. But, if yaks are common, this may raise the crippling liability issue
(our power lines are around a lot of farms). And we can suggest the harm is very minor,
only causing some odd behavior in odd yaks. As well, Ariel-fam came to the nuisance,
not only knowing the power lines were there, but because of the power availability. Not
only is the utility significant, but the "affected" family benefits from it as well. The
balance of equities is tipped significantly in our favour. Ariel-fam might yet argue that
the website is their livelihood, and that tips the scales back. However, it is only a minor
inconvenience, the loss of customers is nebulous, and either a fence or off-site hosting
could solve the problem. So even under 829A, I doubt a court will belief Ariel-fam
should not have to deal with the stray voltage. Or, alternatively, they might suggest the
yaks were present first, and so we need to accommodate the yaks. Again, though gnawing
on a satellite dish is unusual behavior, no further harm has been shown. If they come
back with other proof, this might change. But until then, the odds are ever in our favor.

C. Remedies

In the first incident, we will pay monetary damages for the server. I believe a court will
find the website outage to be outside the scope of liability. Alternatively, they may feel
that there is too much potential for "lost customers" and downtime to lead to the crushing
liability they were worried about. Both of these are strong arguments on our side. If
Ariel-fam could somehow prove their case, they would likely get money damages from
us, but we would still be able to argue that the lost business is too speculative and
unproven, and that the frustration of their customers and the week of downtime is
actually not very significant in terms of pain and suffering.

I think no remedy is possible in the second incident; but failing that, we may have to pay
to abate the nuisance. Though the families are close, erecting a fence to stop yak attacks
is not an unreasonable burden, and they can still talk over it (yaks will still be dissuaded
by a short fence). Alternatively, they could get an off-site server (with near-100%
uptime!). They probably have a strong argument that even though our nuisance is
reasonable, we are the better actor to bear the cost of abating the nuisance because we can
spread across our customers.

For that reason, an injunction is extremely unlikely. One, it is unclear you can ever get rid
of the stray voltage, and presumably this city (and Ariel-fam) needs power despite the
slight nuisance. Two, it is not clear whether that would involve moving the power line, or
the whole main power route, or something else. None of that seems like a reasonable
response for a court to take. And again, the above remedies are possible.
Question 1 – Sample Answer 3

 Power line falling

 Plaintiffs' claims:

 The Ariels could bring a claim for trespass of the "stray voltage" onto their property.
Trespass has been found to lie for fluoride particles coming onto a plaintiff's property,
and so it is likely that stray voltage could constitute trespass as well. The Ariels might
also bring a claim for nuisance, as the stray voltage arguably interfered with the use and
enjoyment of plaintiffs' property by messing up their servers. Lastly, the Ariels might
bring a claim for breach of duty to take reasonable care in maintaining the power lines, or
simply argue this is the sort of incident that should be covered by strict liability. They
will likely ask for compensatory damage for both server damage and lost business, as
well as an injunction to ordering our client to do regular checks.

  For the trespass claim, the Ariels would need to show intent. This intent need not be an
intent to trespass, but merely the intent to be present on the Ariels' property. The Ariels
might have a difficult time showing this, as the stray voltage was on their property by
accident, not because our client intended it to be there. To show nuisance, the Ariels
would also have to show intent, or to show negligence if the nuisance was created
unintentionally. For similar reasons, the Ariels would have a difficult time showing that
the nuisance was intentional. They could try and show an unintentional nuisance through
negligence, but it would be easier just to show a breach of duty of care. For this reason, it
is likely plaintiffs will focus on breach of duty claims, or strict liability claims.

  The Ariels would have a case for breach of duty of care, as inspectors showed the line
was improperly attached and had not been inspected for some time. In showing
negligence, plaintiffs would likely use the Learned Hand BPL formula to demonstrate
that there is a low burden of properly attaching a line and regularly inspecting it
compared with the probability that the line could fall and the potential loss resulting from
a fall (injury to person and property, death). That the industry custom is to inspect power
lines annually would help to show that the burden of inspection was low, though this
would not be dispositive in plaintiffs' favor.

 Causation and defenses:

 In order to recoup damages for damage to their servers and lost business, plaintiffs must
show causation. They would likely have an easy time showing that the line falling was
the cause in fact of the server damage, as this damage would not have happened but for
the stray voltage. It will be harder for plaintiffs to show that the line falling was cause in
fact of their lost business. Even if they can show they lost business, there are many ways
this could have happened even in the absence of the website going down, such as a new
news website with better content. We could try and show that the line falling was not the
proximate cause of plaintiffs' losses. It is likely that a judge or jury would find that
property damage was a foreseeable harm within the risk, though we could try and cut this
off by showing that the line did not fall on plaintiffs' property. This likely would not work,
since it is known that voltage can be conducted away from where the line fell. As for lost
business, this was arguably not a foreseeable harm within the risk since it is a different
type of harm than one would normally expect to result from such an injury. Plaintiffs
might counter that it is really a different extent of harm and should be compensated for
based on the thin-skull rule that a defendant must take a plaintiff as he finds him.

 Defenses:

 In defense of our client, we could argue that plaintiffs assumed the risk of lines might
falling and causing damage to their property. Under the pure comparative negligence
standard this jurisdiction uses, any damages plaintiffs might recover from our client
would be reduced by the percentage of negligence plaintiffs demonstrated by assuming
this risk. In addition, we might argue that liability for our client should be cut off since
our client is the only power company in the area and opening our client to litigation of
this sort could be costly to the community. It is unlikely that another power supplier
could quickly replace our client. In Strauss v. Belle Realty, a court declined to find
ConEd liable for policy reasons like these.

 Yak gnawing and leaked voltage:

 Trespass and nuisance claims:

 As for the claim of leaked voltage affecting animal behavior, plaintiffs would likely
raise similar claims of trespass, nuisance, breach of duty of care, and strict liability.
Plaintiffs might have an easier time showing trespass because our client, as a power
company, presumably knows of this common problem from towers. Thus, plaintiffs could
show our client intended the voltage to trespass on their property simply by having a
tower near the property and knowing some voltage would leak. The same intent argument
would also work for nuisance, but plaintiffs would have to show that the intrusion was
unreasonable by weighing the gravity of harm compared with the utility of the conduct.
For this reason, the Ariels are likely to stick with trespass as their argument for the leaked
voltage.

 Negligence claims and defenses:

 Our client could argue that it only had a duty to maintain equipment in good repair,
which it has proof of doing, and so was not in breach. Our client could also show that
burden on itself and on society of further minimizing leaked voltage would be too heavy
compared with potential loss resulting from leakage (probability of leakage is high).
Minimizing leakage could be shown to be prohibitively expensive to the company and its
customers, compared with the somewhat insignificant harm of strange animal behavior
and a remote harm of animals chomping on satellite dishes.

 Our client could argue that the harm to plaintiffs' dish and business was not proximately
caused by leaked voltage. The yak was an intervening cause that caused the harm. Our
client could able to argue that a yak was not a foreseeable intervening third party
(assuming our client indeed did not know of the yaks) and liability should be cut off
based on this.

 Remedies:

 If our client is found liable, the court might grant compensatory damages for property
damage and/or lost business, and potentially an injunction against our client. In lieu of an
injunction, the court might instead grant permanent damages. Granting an injunction
would allow plaintiffs to decide whether our clients' activity in the area gets to continue,
and a court may find this would affect too many people to be put in the hands of one
family.
Question 2 – Sample Answer 1

Excerpt I.

This statement does not pose a persuasive critique of the lost chance doctrine both in
general and with regards to the plaintiffs at case. First, the lost chance theory of recovery
is not fundamentally at odds with the common law standard of causation, but is in fact in
sync with it. This excerpt's argument improperly conflates the probability of an injury
ocurring and the probability that the defendant caused the injury that did occur. Under
lost chance, the lost chance of survival is the injury, and the doctrine is not applied unless
the defendant's negligent act or omission was the but-for cause of the loss of chance.
Under Matsuyama the court held that injury does not necessarily mean death (and one
can extrapolate, from that, as in the case at bar, a recurrence of cancer), and lost chance is
meant to be a theory of injury not causation. Therefore, the common-law standard of
causation is satisfied. In the case at bar, the defendant is not being held liable for the
recurrence of cancer, as the excerpt would presume, as in the case of Plaintiff B the
cancer did not recur at all, but the defendant was being held responsible for the 30% lost
chance.

Excerpt II

While the premise of this argument, that the loss-of chance doctrine permits an injured
plaintiff to recover for the loss of a less than 50% chance of survival is true, the ensuing
analysis is not persuasive. In a similar vein to excerpt 1, this argument improperly
conflates the increased risk of death/lost chance with the probability that the defendant's
actions led to a loss of chance. There is still the requirement that the doctor's negligence
be more than 50% probable of causing the lost chance, thus satisfying causation. In
Matsuyama, for example, the deceased only had a 37.5% chance of survival without the
defendant's negligence, and therefore if one were to assume that the causation of death
was the injury, there could be no recovery. However, the lost chance of 37.5% was itself
the injury, and defendant was not responsible for his death, but in essence, the portion of
it for which he was more than 50% responsible. In the case at bar with patient A, the
defendant is not being held liable for the probability of death from the recurrence of the
cancer, merely the percentage of the chance of recurrence that he was responsible for. In
this way, it is in conformity with the doctrine of comparative negligence, the doctor is
responsible for the percentage of the lost chance that he is responsible for, whereas the
victim is responsbile for "their" part, i.e., the naturally occurring part.

Excerpt III

This argument is only persuasive if it is assumed that "realized harm" is death, rather than
the harm being the increased risk of death. However, the courts have recognized that
increased risks are in fact a harm of themselves. In a similar situation, in Ayers, the court
permitted recovery for emotional harm of contracting cancer due to an increased risk of
getting cancer as a result of the plaintiffs getting asbestosis. In effect, the court held that
having a heightened risk of cancer, i.e., an increased risk of death/lost chance, is in itself,
an injury for which damages for emotional pain and suffering can be compensated.
Additionally, while this statement may be true for the lower courts of the district at hand,
in other cases, lost chance is only recoverable when the lost chance does lead to death, as
held in Matsuyama. It should be noted, that even taking this argument to be true under the
conditions of the current case, one of the fundamental aims of tort law - deterrence - is
achieved. When lost chance is only permitted (as in Matusuyama) when the injury results
in death, there is under deterrence, and every harm is not compensated.
Question 2 – Sample Answer 2

1.
It is true that the lost chance doctrine can be seen as a departure from tort law's adherence
to causation. For example, C had a 70% chance of cancer recurrence with the drug but a
100% chance of cancer recurrence without the drug. But-for the defendant's negligence in
failing to prescribe the drug, C still would have been likely to get cancer again; but-for
causation fails. However, in B's case, but-for causation was met. B had a 40% chance of
recurrence with the drug and a 60% chance of recurrence without the drug. But-for the
failure to prescribe the drug, B's cancer would probably not have returned. The benefit of
the lost chance doctrine is precisely the fact that plaintiffs like C can still recover.
Without the possibility of recovery based on loss of chance, there would be no incentive
for doctors to exercise reasonable care in treating patients who come in with a less than
even chance of recovery. It is important for our society for doctors to exercise reasonable
care in treating all patients. If we do not adopt the lost chance doctrine, a patient with a
49% chance of recovery would be at a severe disadvantage in comparison to a patient
with a 51% chance of recovery.The lost chance doctrine is therefore important not only to
provide the correct incentives and deterrence, but also to promote fairness.

Furthermore, it is not true that the lost chance doctrine completely displaces establishing
a causal link between the injury and the tortious conduct. Causation still exists, just in a
slightly different form. The relevant question is not whether, but-for the defendant's
negligence, the plaintiff would have survived (or not gotten the disease, as the case may
be), but rather, whether, but-for the defendant's negligence, the plaintiff's chance of
survival would have been higher. In this way, causation is still relevant. But-for the
defendant's negligence, A would have had a 90% chance of avoiding recurrence instead
of a 60% chance; but-for the defendant's negligence, B would have had a 60% chance of
avoiding recurrence instead of a 30% chance; and but-for the defendant's negligence, C
would have had a 30% chance of recurrence instead of a 0% chance. Accordingly,
although this quote is correct in noting that the lost chance doctrine departs from
traditional ideas of causation, it does not depart from them altogether, and it does so in a
way that furthers the goals of deterrence and fairness.

2.
This quote reveals a mistaken understanding of the lost chance doctrine. A plaintiff
recovering under a loss of chance theory must still prove his case (including causation)
by a preponderance of the evidence. As discussed above, the causation that the plaintiff is
proving will look slightly different than it does traditionally. For example, instead of
proving that but-for the defendant's negligence C would not have gotten cancer again, C
must prove that but-for the defendant's negligence he would have had a 30% chance of
recurrence, not a 0% chance. He must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the
defendant caused his 30% loss of chance.

3.
The first part of the quote presents the strongest criticism of the lost chance doctrine. The
lost chance doctrine takes into account everyone who suffered a loss of chance, including
those who suffered a loss of chance and survived (or, in this case, did not get cancer
again). On the one hand, this approach makes sense. In the example before us, B suffered
a 30% loss of chance, even though his cancer has not recurred. Because he suffered harm,
he should be able to recover. On the other hand, the lost chance doctrine only adequately
deters defendants if everyone who suffered the loss of chance, even those who survived
like B, actually sue. Because the lost chance doctrine takes into account everyone's lost
chance, even that of those who survive, the amount that each individual can recover is
slightly reduced. In contrast, under a proportional liability regime, defendants pay
damages in proportion to their fault. Each individual may recover slightly more, but there
is no room for individuals who survived to also recover. Although the lost chance
doctrine may under-deter defendants if individuals who survived do not sue, the benefits
of the doctrine (discussed more fully in regards to excerpt 1) outweigh this potential
downside.

Furthermore, the last sentence of the quote is somewhat inaccurate. The quote
distinguishes between recovery based on increased risks and recovery based on realized
harm, but it is possible to conceptualize the loss of chance as realized harm. This is
particularly true in the realm of medical care where harm is often calculated as risk--the
risk of getting a disease, the risk of recurrence, etc. These risks generally last a person's
lifetime and can be fatal if realized. Thus, in the medical sphere, where the lost chance
doctrine is most often used, equating harm and risk makes sense. In other environments it
may not--a pedestrian who is almost hit by a car may have suffered an increased risk of
death in that moment, but he does not have an increased likelihood of being hit by a car
for the rest of his life. In contrast, a patient who has an increased risk of cancer will carry
that irreversible risk with him forever.
Question 2 – Sample Answer 3

None of these excerpts pose persuasive criticisms to the adoption of the loss of chance
doctrine in this jurisdiction generally, but it may not be appropriate for the instant case.

The first excerpt inaccurately discusses the "injury" as being the recurrance of cancer or
perhaps the eventual death of a misdiagnosed patient. In fact, the doctrine attempts to
isolate the injury as specifically the lost opportunity to avoid the recurrance. In that sense,
the causal link between the misdiagnosis and the injury is maintained, because had the
doctor not misdiagnosed the patients, they would have gotten on the drug and had better
odds of avoiding recurrence. Even if Patient B didn't actually need the drug at that time to
eventually prevent the recurrance of cancer, the idea of lost chance is that he was still
subject to this injury. If this injury seems too abstract to a court, consider the cases of
Herskovits and Matsuyama, in which the injury was the loss of chance to survive cancer.
In not knowing that they had the cancer when it could have initially been diagnosed, they
may have been subjected to more agressive treatments and more hospital visits later on
than they would have been otherwise. Thus, the injury of lost chance results in tangible
costs and suffering and is calcuable for a given plaintiff. Although in the current case, the
injury was the loss of chance to avoid the recurrance of cancer such that, if a plaintiff
never again gets the cancer, they will not likley have countable damages resulting from
the injury, the injury itself still occurred as a direct and foreseeable result of the doctor's
misdiagnosis, and thus the causal link element is not dismissed with the adoption of lost
chance doctrine.

I have a similar response to the second excerpt, which finds that the burden of proof is
lower in lost chance doctrine because it mistakenly labels the injury as the death or
recurrance of cancer itself. Although in cases such as the one here - perhaps especially for
Patients C and A, where the misdiagnoses indeed may not have been more probably than
not the factual cause of the recurrance of cancer because the patient was already more
likely than not to get the disease or because the patient had a more than 50% chance of
not contracting the disease even after the diagnosis, respectively - it is true that there isn't
a preponderance of evidence to support the fact that the misdiagnoses were more
probably than not responsible for the recurrance, that isn't what lost chance doctrine is
about. The injury is the loss of chance itself, and as jurisdictions have determined in the
past, the doctors that misdiagnosed the patients are completely responsible for the loss of
chance (unless the patients were contributorily or comparatively negligent by not
showing up for subsequent doctors appointments that may have corrected the diagnosis
sooner). Although it may feel strange to compensate victims for the same injury when
their ultimate results were so different, the idea is that they actually sustained the same
injury, and it was caused by the misdiagnosis.

Excerpt three brings up an important counterargument to lost chance cases. In this case,
the drug only sometimes prevents the recurrence of cancer, and so even if the injury was
the loss of chance to try the drug, it is really just the creation of a risk because we can't
predict what the drug's impact on a patient's chances of avoiding the recurrance of cancer
will be. However I would argue that while it is true that this increased risk is the actual
result of the negligence, loss chance cases are a unique subset of these "risk creation"
situations, in that the lost chance itself is a countable injury, if not a predictable one.
Indeed, one of the reasons why loss of chance was implemented in Herskovits and
Matsuyama is that the patients' chances of survival were calcuable at various phases
during the disease's progression. The courts maintained this rationale despite the fact that
the patients' true losses were the reduced options for treating the cancer which at that
point could have had unpredictable impacts on their chances of survival. Thus even
though it seems like the injury is merely an increased risk, and that because the drug that
wasn't prescribed has uncertain impact, the risk can't be calculated; the mere fact that a
patient's actual chances of avoiding or dying from cancer can be calculated at different
points, such that a decrease in chance can be calculated, sets these cases apart from other
situations of risk creation. Because of the calculability of this injury, courts have found
that plaintiffs can recover for it. However, in this case, the fact that the jury found that
each plaintiff lost the same amount of chance and that the loss was a round number for all
of them doesn't instill confidence that the numbers were rigorously or precisely
calculated. In this case either such data wasn't used or, in cases dealing with the
recurrance of cancer, the medical field doesn't yet have the capacity to make such specific
calculations. If the later is the case, employing lost chance doctrine in the current case
may be inappropriate because the injury does seem a more abstract, indefinite case of risk
creation, rather than a countable loss of opportunity to avoid cancer.

         The common criticism of market-share liability is that it asymmetrically favors
plaintiffs. The real problem is that it's insufficiently favorable to plaintiffs. Consider the
stringent requirements for its application, especially equal product harmfulness. I propose
the 'equal harmfulness' requirement should be relaxed, so that market-share liability is
proper when products are unequally harmful if the relative toxicity of the products vis-a-
vis one another can be established with reliable, compelling statistics, so that a plaintiff's
recovery from a defendant should be proportional to the share of total harm attributable to
a defedant; ie, to both to the defendant's market-share and relative toxicity of its product.
To illustrate: the asbestos market consists of A and B, with equal market-shares, but A's
asbestos is empirically twice as harmful as B's, so two-thirds of total harm is attributable
to A. victims should recover 2/3 from A and 1/3 from B, rather than 1/2 from each or,
more likely, 0 due to the heterogeneity of asbestos harmfulness.
         Arguments for this rule are similar to those for market-share liability, which is
imposed where we cannot relate a negligent actor's specific acts to specific victims, even
where we know he was negligent and that his negligence caused harm. It justifies
loosening the strict causation requirement because actors still fully compensate for the
magnitude of injury they caused and victims recover the full amount of their loss, no
more or less. Reliable statistics on market shares and equal product harmfulness both
ensure a tight relationship between liability and extent of harm actually caused. The
assumption is that heterogenuously-toxic products prevent the calculation of how much
harm a defendant has caused. However, where reliable statistics can be obtained on how
relatively toxic products are compared to each other, this complication can be overcome;
the calculation is still manageable.
         The usual criticisms of market-share liability apply here with equal vigor; which
market to use (state/national), inherent unfairness of permitting recovery where causation
isn't established, etc. In response, this reform doesn't particularly aggrevate these faults
compared to ordinary market-share liability; a jurisdiction that uses market-share liability
has already accepted these shortcomings. A stronger criticism is that reliable statistical
information on how relatively harmful similar products are, compared to one another,
will be exceedingly difficult to produce. It is often hard enough to calculate companies'
market-shares decades ago; calculating how many times more toxic A's product was than
B's, thirty years ago, may be impossible. In response, Unequal-Harm Market-Share
liability would simply be inapplicable when such data cannot be obtained, just as
ordinary market-share liability doesn't apply when market-shares cannot be determined.
That a reform may seldom be relevant shouldn't stop us from using it when it is.

                             Modified Eggshell-Plaintiff Rule

       Second, I propose replacing the existing Eggshell-Plaintiff rule with one that
places unexpected degrees of harm outside the scope of liability where ex ante the victim
could have signaled his latent infirmity more cheaply than the tortfeasor could've
detected it. Suppose a tortfeasor injures a victim in a way that ordinarily causes damage
of 10. Due to this particular victim's latent weakness, however, he suffers injury of 50.
Under the Eggshell-Plaintiff rule, he'll recover 50. If his weakness was of a nature that
could be easily broadcast, however, he should recover only 10. This reform would more
effectively serve the deterrence aim of tort law by imposing accident costs on the party
best-positioned to avoid the accident ex ante.
         Proximate cause can be understood in light of tort law's goal of minimizing
accident costs by placing liability on the 'cheapest cost avoider', who can best deter
accidents ex ante. The proposal would align 'unexpected extent of harm' with other
proximate cause defenses that common law does recognize, such as 'unexpected type' and
'unexpected victim', which both relieve tortfeasors who aren't "cheapest cost avoiders." A
tortfeasor cannot be expected to be most capable of preventing harm to someone whose
presence wasn't reasonably foreseeable; the victim herself, who does have awareness of
her position, is better-positioned to avoid accidents by signaling her presence. Likewise,
tortfeasors may not be best-positioned to avoid a harm if they lack awarness that the type
of harm in question would occur. Tort law's refusal to acknowledge the 'unexpected
manner' defense is consistent with this deterrence aim. The manner in which harm occurs
is irrelevant to the extent of harm caused; where type and extent of harm are foreseeable,
an actor has warning what harm his acts will cause, even if not the precise manner in
which they'll occur.
         One objection is that the administrative cost of this rule would outweigh any
utility it saves, because ex post determinations at trials of whether individual victims'
latent weaknesses were of a nature that could easily be broadcast to potential tortfeasors
would involve extensive individualized medical evidence and expert testimony, which
would be expensive financially and in term of judicial economy, eating courts' time. One
solution would be to only impose the rule where a reasonable person would conclude that
the weakness could be easily broadcast, but this determination itself would be costly to
reach, plus inherently subjective. However, once a determination is reached in a case, it
could be applied as precedent, reducing some need for individualized assessments in
future case. Another criticism is that this reform ignores psychic costs to potential victims
of broadcasting their weaknesses to the public in terms of dignity, privacy and
embarrassment.
Question 3 – Sample Answer 2

Injunction for Nuisance

         Courts balance the equities to determine appropriate remedies for nuisance cases.
The current considerations courts take into account in deciding remedies are biased in
favor of DF. Courts are reluctant to grant injunction if DF's activity is valuable to the
surrounding community. It also considers parties' respective faults and hardship to the
parties with or without the injunction. I propose changing these standards in two ways.
First, the value from the activity that constitues nuisance should be constrained to the
communities within 50 miles of the DF. Second, hardship to the parties should be
determined in proportion to their economic wealth. The problem with relying on the
current standards is that a PL might have zero fault and endure hardships upon
continuance of nuisance, but an injunction will not be granted because DF's activity is
valuable to other communities far away. PL could receive none of the benefits benefits
but shoulder all of the harm. This is not fair. Furthermore, the hardship a farmer suffers
when harmful chemicals damage his crops might be minimal in absolute value to losses a
factory might incur upon closing it down. But famer could entirely depend on the crops
for his livelihood, whereas the corporation operates numerous other factories around the
country. The current bias in granting injunction towards DF does not protect these little
plaintiffs. The proposed changes would better distribute the harm and losses. If
constrained within 50 miles, the court would look at how those who bear the harm are
benefitted to ensure those considerations are distributed more evenly. Looking at
hardships in proportion of economic wealth promotes proper compensation and fairness
for the little plaintiffs facing megacorporations. Making injunctions easier gives plaintiffs
the bargaining power because they get to enjoin DF or let DF off the hook at the price the
plaintiffs set. This levels the asymmetry.
         Of course, setting more rigid rules produces problems. Perhaps a factory provides
resources and employment to a community 51 miles away. Under the proposed regime,
benefits to such communities would not be considered in determining whether to grant
the injunction. This presents a countervailing fairness concern for these folks. Moreover,
the second change could create perverse incentives. Corporations would now build their
factories in places where the potential plaintiffs are relatively wealthier. They do not want
their factories in places where the same harm would be felt to a greater extent. But a
counter-argument would be these wealthier plaintiffs would be better able to protect
themselves and reduce the harm. Factories would also have more incentive to reduce the
nuisance if injunctions are easier. I believe the concerns of protecting plaintiffs who
disproportionately bear the harm justify implementing these changes.

Joint and Several Liability Under Comparative Negligence

        When two or more defendants are liable to the plaintiff for the same harm as a
result of concerted action, each defendant is responsible to plaintiff as if he were the sole
injurer. The plaintiff can recover for full amount against the defendant of his choice.
Defendants divide up the liability among them. Solvent defendants must cover for
insolvent ones. This scheme of covering insolvent defendants under the comparative
negligence regime is biased in favor of the plaintiff. I propose that states make the
plaintiff and the solvent defendants bear the risk of the insolvent defendants' amount in
proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to each one. It is not fair that a
defendant, whose portion of liability may be less than the plaintiff's, cover the insolvent
defendant. Of course, there are countervailing arguments against the proposed change.
The current joint and several liability would allow plaintiffs to recover the entire
judgment amount for harm done minus their own liability. Solvent defendants would
cover for insolvent ones and pay the plaintiff in their place. It fully compensates the
plaintiff because he receives all the damages for insolvent defendants, too. Compensation
is one of the fundamental goals of tort law. It also distributes losses to those with the
deepest pockets. However, the proposed regime would address the deterrence and
fairness problems of the original scheme. When defendants pay more than their share of
liability, we are creating overdeterrence effects and decreasing the societal value the
defendants create. It is also not fair to impose a burden on each defendant larger than its
liability. Burden should be proportional to liability.
         One could make a counter-argument that the proposed change would have less
deterrence effects on the defendants because they no longer have to cover for insolvent
defendants. There is a greater chance they do not have to pay as much. But I would argue
that the possibility of having to cover for insolvent tortfeasors is not a significant factor in
determining defendants' behavior ex ante. What primarily controls their decisions is the
potential for liability and having to compensate for that. Therefore, I would argue we
would not lose much deterrence. Furthermore, the proposed change would have more
deterrence effects on the plaintiff's behavior. The plaintiff's behavior would determine not
only his share of liability but how much has to cover for insolvent defendants. If his share
of liability is less, he would not have to cover for as much and receive larger amounts
from solvent defendants. I would therefore argue that the proposed system would overall
benefit the deterrence goals of torts law.
