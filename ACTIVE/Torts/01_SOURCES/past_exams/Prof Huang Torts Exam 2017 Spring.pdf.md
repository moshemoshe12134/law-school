                                          Instructions

       This is a 4-hour in-class exam.

        You may use any course materials we assigned or distributed, plus any outlines or notes
that you or your classmates have prepared. You may not do outside research. You may not
consult with anyone during the exam. If a question seems unclear or if a key fact seems to be
missing, then please state your best reading of the question or your sensible assumption about the
key fact, and continue with your answer.

        The exam is designed to take 3 hours, thus allowing you extra time to organize, review,
rethink, and edit. Planning your answers before you start writing is likely to be a very good use
of time.

       Space is very limited and you will need to be concise. Please write in complete
sentences. You will be rewarded for clear organization, brevity, precise thinking, and good
writing. Using headings and signposts may help. Cite cases or other sources when it makes your
answer clearer. Do not use footnotes.

       Please supply a word count for each question. Include headings and signposts in the
count. You must stay within the limits: 1400 words for Question 1; 1200 words for Question 2.

       You should answer both questions. Each question will be worth 1/2 of the grade. Please
do budget your time carefully.

       Remember that your aim is to demonstrate how thoughtful and nuanced you can be in
using what we covered in class, along with any “facts” given by the exam, to craft your
arguments—and counter-arguments.

       I wish you the best of luck!

                                            Question 1

                                        Limit: 1400 words


       Elsington is the sort of sprawling city where every house has a large front lawn, a wide
driveway, and at least a couple cars—the sort of city that guzzles energy, and knows it.

        The leading art museum and science museum in the city have teamed up to form the Arts
and Sciences Project, a non-profit organization for promoting science awareness through public
art displays. The Project’s most recent and high-profile effort is its “Power of Beauty” program,
which seeks to draw attention to a new technology for making solar panels out of materials that
can be extracted from old, toxic car batteries. The program offers Elsington residents the chance
to transform their used cars into solar power generators for their homes, free of charge.

        Here’s how the program works: The car owner brings in her old vehicle; the Project’s
engineers replace the engine with solar power machinery and install solar panels on the car’s
hood and roof; and a well-known contemporary artist is commissioned to repaint the car’s
exterior. This vividly decorated solar unit—essentially, a car-like sculpture that generates
electricity from sunlight—is then towed back to the owner’s house and wired up to her home
electrical system. And there it sits, on her driveway, for all to see.

       At first, the Project’s leaders were delighted by the program’s popularity. Over 500
residents took part, drawn by the appeal of free electricity and a bold, stylish house ornament.
Meanwhile, the publicity that these residents provided (both for solar power in general and for
the new technology in particular) reached well beyond their neighborhoods, as the local and
national news loved to feature these colorful—some might even say beautiful—solar units.

        But then summer arrived. Along with summer came the region’s infamous daily
thunderstorms. And soon, the Project’s staff began to hear reports about the solar units being
struck by lightning. Because these solar units were wired to their owners’ home electrical
systems, these direct hits by lightning would not only wreck the solar unit itself but also cause a
severe power surge, destroying household electronics and at times even melting some home
electrical wiring.

        These frequent reports—at roughly the rate of 5 per month—at first baffled the Project’s
engineers. They had considered the possibility of lightning, but in their original computer
simulations, such direct hits seemed nearly impossible because the car-sized solar units sit low to
the ground, relative to the height of the houses; therefore, any lightning that came close to the
solar units should be absorbed by the lightning rods on the adjacent houses. (A lightning rod
catches the lightning above the roof and then redirects that electrical current down through wires
that are grounded deep in the soil, circumventing the house.)

                                                                              Prof. Huang, Spring 2017


        When they went to see some of the destroyed solar units, the Project’s engineers soon
realized what the problem was: Many houses simply didn’t have lightning rods. For every solar
unit that was hit by lightning, in fact, at least one of the houses adjacent to it—sometimes the
house attached to the solar unit, sometimes the neighbor’s house across the driveway, and
sometimes both—had no lightning rod.

        Re-running their simulations, the Project’s engineers found that the lack of a lightning
rod on an adjacent house meant that the solar unit could itself become a lightning rod of sorts,
but a bad one: Quite often, in the simulations, a lightning strike that would otherwise have hit an
adjacent house with no lightning rod would instead be absorbed by the solar unit sitting nearby;
however, rather than sending all that electrical current into the soil like a real lightning rod, the
solar unit would send the surge straight into its owner’s house.

                                                ***

        You are an attorney for the Project. One day late in the summer, the director steps into
your office to update you on the situation: “So far, we’ve heard reports from about 15
homeowners whose solar units have been hit by lightning. We’re also starting to get some
inquiries from local news stations—and I bet plaintiffs’ attorneys won’t be far behind. It’s time
we begin to assess our possible exposure to tort liability.”

        She instructs: “I need you to prepare a quick, preliminary analysis. How might these
homeowners pursue tort claims against us? And how might we respond? How can we minimize
our potential liability? No need to do any research yet—just sketch for me the potential
arguments and strategies on both sides. If there are any crucial facts we should find out, please
say so. And as there haven’t been any cases yet in this state about lightning strikes on this kind
of solar unit, please feel free to suggest arguments about how the law should treat these facts.”

        Prepare this memo. If you need to make any assumptions, please do so and state
them clearly. (You may assume what you wish about where your state stands, on any
issues of law about which the states differ.)

                                            Question 2

                                        Limit: 1200 words


         You are a legal policy analyst at the American Law Institute who specializes in tort law
and tort remedies. One fine day in May, the director approaches you with an intriguing request.
“Throughout its evolution,” he says, “tort law has been a deeply human enterprise: after all, it’s a
set of ideas designed to deal with the consequences of human choices and human behavior, based
on human values.”

       He continues: “But now we are fast entering an age of artificial intelligence (A.I.). How
we think, how we make decisions, how we interact, what we do—all this is becoming more and
more enmeshed with various forms of A.I. In some cases, they complement or enhance our
capabilities; in others, they actually do things we once thought only people could do.”

        He observes: “Some are already part of our lives, and countless more are just on the
horizon. Think of self-driving cars and Amazon delivery drones. Think of surgical robots; or
think of medical software that can spot cancerous cells, or predict the impact of a drug on a given
individual. Think of programs and machines that can ‘learn’ from voluminous data—and thus
identify people’s faces, or choose news feeds for you, or find the best search results, or give you
driving directions. Think of Siri in your iPhone, or the computer that can beat us all in Jeopardy.
Many such examples are possible, and just think of all the future variations of these things…”

        He then instructs: “As part of a longer-term project here, I’d like for you to start
brainstorming about potential implications for the law. Will you please identify for me two
aspects of our current torts or remedies thinking that may be likely to evolve, or should evolve,
as our reliance on A.I. continues to grow in the near future? You should feel free to choose your
topics not only from the doctrines of tort law and remedies law, but also from their underlying
concepts, theories, limitations, and aims. Be imaginative!”

         He further specifies: “For each topic please explain why a change may become necessary
or useful, in a given context, and what form it might take. Then, please also suggest opposing
arguments—reasons why the change won’t be needed or useful. And please do try to use
specific scenarios or hypotheticals (involving any kind of A.I. you wish, present or future) to
illustrate your points.”

       Prepare this memo. Remember to address two topics.
