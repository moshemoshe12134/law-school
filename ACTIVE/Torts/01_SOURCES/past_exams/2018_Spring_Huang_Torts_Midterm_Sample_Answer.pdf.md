Practice Problem, Sample Answer 1



Negligence

Maintenance of ceiling

        Plaintiffs may argue that Defendant’s failure to properly inspect and maintain the plaster
ceiling for 19 years (1996-2015) constituted negligence. The probability of the plaster ceiling
falling off was high and foreseeable (the plaster ceiling was installed 47 years ago) and the
potential harm to people walking in the corridor was also significant (serious bodily injury). Yet,
the cost of inspecting and repairing the ceiling once in a couple of years is not unreasonably
burdensome.

        Defendants can contend that they have already exercised reasonable care, pointing out
that during the 28 years (1968-1996) between installation and the final inspection, the plaster
ceiling showed no signs of damages whatsoever. Nies who repaired the ceiling shortly after the
accident also confirmed that the plaster was not sagging in any other area of the ceiling.
Therefore, Defendant had no reason to foresee the harm and take corresponding precautions. In
addition, after installing the new drop ceiling in 1996, the cost and burden of inspecting the
plaster ceiling became significantly higher, because one cannot inspect the plaster ceiling
without damaging part of the new drop ceiling underneath it.

        Plaintiffs’ arguments are more convincing. LePore’s testimony indicates that the accident
was likely caused by the gradual aging of the plaster ceiling. Defendant probably could have
detected the risk and prevented the harm by conducting regular inspections in the 19 years. Nies’
testimony can at most prove other parts of the plaster ceiling had no signs of damage, but not the
fallen part at issue here. Defendant’s own choice of installing another layer of ceiling below
should not exempt itself from exercising reasonable care to prevent potential injuries caused by
the original plaster ceiling.



Care of Debris

        Plaintiffs would also argue that Defendant’s failure to take reasonable care of the jagged
debris to prevent injuries constitute negligence. Plaintiffs would stress that Defendant knew Hale


                                                 1
was blind and the debris were on the corridor which Hale had to walk through to go to the
restroom. The risk of Hale tripping over the makeshift chain and falling into the debris was
foreseeable to Defendant, therefore Defendant should have used more precautions, such as
removing the debris sooner or having an employee standing on guard.

       Defendant can contend it already exercised reasonable care by circling the debris by a
chain, which would adequately prevent most people (including reasonably prudent blind people
walking with a cane) from being injured by the debris. Removing the debris immediately and
before photographs were taken for evidence would be highly burdensome for Defendant, since it
reduces Defendant’s chance of getting issuance compensation. Having an employee standing on
guard was also costly and unnecessary given that there was little traffic in the area at the time.

       Plaintiffs have better arguments because Defendant was aware of the increased
probability of accident caused by Hale’s blindness and having an employee on guard for several
hours at most (from 9 am when casino opened till photographs were taken) is not unreasonably
burdensome given the seriousness of bodily harms that could be caused by the jagged debris.



Intubation Kit

       Plaintiffs may also claim that Defendant was negligent in failing to equip the casino with
intubation kits. Equipping intubation kits is not unreasonably costly or burdensome while it
could be of vital importance during a medical emergency. The custom that large hotels have
intubation kits available is also evidence in favor of finding negligence on Defendant’s part.

       Defendant can make three counter-arguments. First, intubation kits are of limited use and
may even cause further harm without medical professionals who are trained to use it properly.
Requesting casinos to also have medical professionals available all the time could be costly and
burdensome. Here, Dr. Goul’s presence on sight was a mere coincidence. Second, the custom of
large hotels having intubation kits available cannot apply to mid-size casinos because hotels are
susceptible to higher risk of medical emergencies (customers stay overnight) and large hotels
have stronger financial capabilities to bear the costs of keeping medical professionals. Third,
even if similar custom could apply to Defendant, it is not dispositive evidence of negligence.




                                                  2
          Defendants have better arguments here because there is no evidence supporting the
existence of custom in casino industry and BPL analysis here favors Defendant.



Contributory or Comparative Negligence

          Although the standard of care for Hale may be lowered considering his blindness,
Defendant can argue that a reasonable blind person would have taken more precautions under the
circumstance, since the cost of using a cane is low while the probabilities and potential damages
for tripping over without a cane are both high. Hale could have avoided this accident had he used
a cane.

          Plaintiffs may counter that Hale had already exercised reasonable care considering that
the accident happened at a time and place with presumably little traffic and Hale was very
familiar with this short route. The risk of falling over jagged debris was unforeseeable to Hale.

          Defendant has better argument because Hale was the cheapest cost avoider of the
accident. Assuming this state adopts pure comparative negligence, the damages for Plaintiffs
would be reduced in proportion to Hale’s own negligence.



Causation

          Assuming breach of duties was established, cause-in-fact would likely cut off liability
regarding Plaintiffs’ intubation kits claim. But for Defendant’s failure to equip intubation kits,
Hale’s chance of survival was still small. Plaintiffs cannot avail themselves of the lost chance
doctrine, which only applies in medical malpractice cases where measurable statistics regarding
patient’s chance of survival are usually available.

          Defendant may contend that proximate cause cuts off liability regarding Plaintiffs’
maintenance of ceiling claim because, unlike a passerby being hit by falling plaster, a blind
person falling into debris is not the harm within the increased risk foreseeable to Defendant for
failing to properly maintain the ceiling. But this argument cannot help Defendant in Plaintiffs’
care of debris claim, where the harm obviously falls within the foreseeable increased risk.




                                                   3
         Defendant may also argue that Hale’s blindness exacerbated the harm to an unforeseeable
extent. However, Plaintiffs can rely on the egg-shell plaintiff doctrine and more convincingly
contend that unforeseeable extent of harm does not matter in proximate cause analysis.

         In sum, Plaintiffs probably can establish causation at least in regard to their care of debris
claim.



Policy Consideration

         Assuming that Plaintiffs can establish both negligence and causation, this Court may also
consider the fact that Defendant rented its premises to Hale at a nominal fee of only one dollar
per year to support disabled persons. Imposing too stringent liabilities on Defendant may deter
business-owners from helping disable persons when they have no obligations to do so and hence
make disabled persons even worse off. When balancing the interest of Plaintiffs and the public
policy of encouraging business-owners to help disabled persons, this Court may consider to
change the law by limiting the scope of liabilities for such “good Samaritan” business-owners,
especially when the victim’s own negligence contributed partly to the injury.

Practice Problem, Sample Answer 2



       This case requires us to consider the potential tort liability of not only the defendant-
appellant, Lucky Day Casino, but of plaintiffs’ decedent, Leroy Hale, and of third parties whose
actions were connected to the accident. Below, I provide an overview of the issues attached to
each party, assuming for present purposes that this Court will review the trial court’s conclusions
of fact and law de novo.



I. Lucky Day Casino

       Several of Lucky Day’s actions appear relevant to Hale’s accident, including (1) the
casino’s failure to inspect the plaster ceiling, (2) its failure to keep an intubation kit on the
premises, and (3) its failure to warn Hale of the danger.

   1. Failure to inspect the ceiling.

       Plaintiffs may argue that Lucky Day breached its duty of reasonable care by failing to
inspect the plaster ceiling for nearly two decades, and that this failure was a cause-in-fact of
Hale’s accident. Under the Hand formula, it would be a low burden to periodically inspect the
ceiling, considering that Nies was able to do so simply by removing a few tiles of the drop
ceiling to look around with a flashlight. If such inspections had occurred regularly, it would have
been apparent that a portion of the plaster ceiling was likely to collapse, and Lucky Day could
have taken steps to repair it. Plaintiffs will argue that Hale’s death was a harm within the risk
that made Lucky Day’s failure to inspect the ceiling negligent in the first place — i.e., it is
negligent not to inspect old plaster ceilings because debris from a collapsed ceiling may seriously
injure someone.

       Defendant may respond that there is a low probability that inspecting the ceiling would
have prevented the accident. Lepore believed the ceiling collapsed because of its age — but age
would in theory affect the entire ceiling, and Nies’s post-accident inspection indicated that no
other parts of the ceiling appeared damaged. It is thus not clear that regular inspection would
have revealed a defect that Lucky Day could have repaired to prevent the accident. Additionally,


                                                 5
defendant could argue that Hale’s death was not a “harm within the risk,” because the type of
harm Hale suffered (falling on the debris and bleeding to death) is not the foreseeable harm that
makes a failure to inspect the ceiling negligent (being hit by falling debris).

   2. Failure to maintain an intubation kit.

       Plaintiffs may argue that, by not making an intubation kit available, Lucky Day
negligently deprived Hale of a chance to survive. Evidence suggests it was a custom in the
hospitality industry to maintain intubation kits, and Lucky Day’s failure to do so represents a
risky flouting of an established precaution that a reasonably prudent company would take. Hale’s
loss of chance to survive was a foreseeable harm within that risk; even a “small” chance of
survival has value, and loss of that chance is a real injury.

       Defendant will argue, likely successfully, that the lost-chance doctrine should not apply
outside of the context of medical malpractice, since other scenarios don’t support the kind of
reliable data found in the medical context. Even if the lost-chance doctrine were applicable, the
above-cited evidence of custom is observed only in large hotels and has little relevance to the
negligence determination for a mid-sized, independent casino.

   3. Failure to warn Hale of the danger.

       Plaintiffs may argue that Lucky Day had an affirmative duty to warn Hale, its contract
employee, of the fallen debris. Lucky Day was clearly aware of Hale’s blindness and should
have foreseen that the debris would pose a special danger to him. Plaintiffs may claim that the
relationship between an independent contractor and his employer is a special one that supports an
affirmative duty to warn the contractor of workplace hazards known to the employer, and that
Lucky Day’s breach of that duty was both a cause-in-fact and a proximate cause of Hale’s death.
Defendant will counter that there is no such affirmative duty, because a special relationship is
typically one of custody or dependence and probably does not exist between parties contracting
in an ordinary business context.



II. Leroy Hale

       Assuming that our state applies pure comparative negligence, defendant will argue that
any damages should be reduced proportionately to the amount of the total negligence attributable


                                                  6
to Hale’s own negligence. Defendant will argue that Hale was substantially negligent, because a
reasonable person in Hale’s situation would have used a cane to check for obstacles in his path.
The burden of using a cane was extremely low (Hale had one immediately at hand), and the
probability of encountering an unfamiliar and potentially hazardous object is always present in a
public place.

       Plaintiffs will respond that Hale’s blindness was a physical infirmity which should be
taken into account in evaluating his reasonableness and the negligence standard that should
apply. Under the Hand formula, the probability of harm would have seemed very low to Hale,
since the trip was short and one he had made many times, it was an early hour, and that area of
the casino did not see much traffic. Under these apparently low-risk circumstances, he did take
reasonable care by proceeding slowly and with one arm outstretched to detect unfamiliar objects.
As a result, plaintiffs will argue their damages should not be reduced because Hale was not
negligent.



III. Third Parties

       Lucky Day could have impleaded John Lepore, the contractor who performed the original
repairs on the casino ceiling, if he may be liable to Lucky Day for some of its damages. This
would be the case if Hale’s accident might have been caused by Lepore’s negligence in
improperly repairing the ceiling in 1991 or failing to check the plaster when he installed the drop
ceiling. Lepore did not perform repairs on the area of the ceiling that collapsed; if he chose not to
repair that part of the ceiling despite the fact that it needed repair at the time, and if any
reasonably prudent person with his construction expertise would have repaired that area, his
failure to do so would be negligent. Serious injury due to debris from a collapsed ceiling is
within the risk that would make the failure to perform needed repairs negligent, so Lepore could
be liable on those facts. However, even if a reasonable person would have recognized that the
ceiling needed repair on the occasions he was hired (which is not clear from the evidence),
Lepore may have a plausible defense that Lucky Day’s allowing 20 years to pass without
inspecting the ceiling was a superseding cause of the accident.

       Plaintiffs did not sue Dr. Jane Goul, who attempted to provide medical assistance to Hale.
In many cases, rescuers have a duty to rescue carefully if they attempt rescue at all; thus,


                                                 7
plaintiffs might have investigated whether Dr. Goul committed malpractice by breaching the
standards of care required by the medical profession, and thereby deprived Hale of a chance to
survive. But assuming that our state has a Good Samaritan statute shielding doctors who provide
emergency care on the scene of an accident from liability, any claim against Dr. Goul is likely to
fail even if she was negligent in administering emergency care.

Practice Problem, Sample Answer 3



Breach of duty

       LDC failed to inspect the plaster ceiling for 19 years prior to the accident. An inspection
could have identified the damaged portion of the ceiling and prompted repair. LDC may argue
that inspecting the entire ceiling would have been costly. However, they have likely now
incurred greater costs in having to repair the portion that collapsed. Thus, the burden on LDC of
inspection was low, given the costs saved on future repairs. The foreseeable harm of a ceiling
collapse, which the inspection may have prevented was high. Given that LDC had previously had
to repair the ceiling, they were aware of the possibility of damage. And because they planned to
photograph the site in case of future lawsuits, they were aware of the possible injuries and
liability that may arise from the collapse. The ceiling covered a casino that is likely crowded
during business hours, so a collapse could have led to more than the single death that occurred in
this instance. The foreseeable probability of harm was also high, given the age of the building,
the crowded nature of the casino and the past history of damage to the plaster ceiling. Because
LDC’s burden of inspecting was low, and the foreseeable harm and likelihood of harm were
high, the casino was negligent in not conducting an inspection. The jury did not find whether an
inspection would have shown an impending collapse and led to repair, so it is unclear whether
this negligence was a ‘but for’ cause of Hale’s death.

       LDC failed to clear the floor of rubble after the collapse, a low burden. A small team of
employees could have cleared the area in the four hours between the collapse and Hale’s
accident. The casino may argue that they needed to photograph for insurance purposes, however,
this could have been accomplished quickly after the collapse. The foreseeable harms associated
with a pile of rubble on the floor of a casino are high. Given that the pile remained on the floor
during business hours, the pile could have also risked obstructing the pathway of patrons exiting
the casino in the event of an emergency. The casino may claim that the accident occurred in a
low-traffic area, so the foreseeable risk of harm was low. However, LDC was aware that Hale, a
blind person who had been there for three years, worked in this area. They were also likely aware
that he travelled without his cane in familiar portions of the casino. Therefore, the foreseeable
probability of harm to this plaintiff was high. The casino may also argue that the foreseeable


                                                 9
harm was low because they had cordoned off the area to prevent people from getting too close to
the rubble. However, given their knowledge of Hale’s proximity and their awareness that he
regularly walks without his cane, it was foreseeable that he would not be alerted to the presence
of the rubble until he encountered the cordon, at which point, he would foreseeably have enough
momentum to trip. The casino’s failure to clear the rubble quickly was a ‘but for’ cause of Hale’s
death and was negligent given the low burden and the high likelihood and extent of harm that
were foreseeable to this plaintiff.

       LDC failed to warn Hale of the presence of the rubble. This would have been an
extremely low burden, since few other employees would need to be warned. Warning Hale
would have greatly reduced the likelihood of his accident, since he could have taken an alternate
route or used his cane to avoid the pile. The foreseeable harm, as discussed in the previous
paragraph, was high. Because the foreseeable risk and harm were high, and the burden was very
low, LDC was negligent in not warning Hale of the rubble. The jury did not make a finding of
whether Hale would have avoided the rubble had he been warned, so it is unclear whether this
negligence was a ‘but for’ cause of his death.

       LDC failed to provide an intubation kit and trained staff to use it. It may be customary for
large hotels to provide kits, but no evidence suggests that the casino deviated from the custom of
mid-size casinos by not providing one. The burden of providing the kit would have been high,
assuming that the medical equipment is expensive. Personnel would also need to be trained to
use the device, which would significantly increase the cost. While the foreseeable harm of not
having the kit is high (death), the untaken precaution would only create a slight difference in the
probability of harm, since it would only prevent a small number of deaths: those who are in dire
enough straits to not be breathing, but who are well enough to be sustained by the use of the
device. As Goul noted, the device would have only provided a small increase in Hale’s odds of
survival. Because the burden of providing the kit is high and the probability of harm is low, the
casino was not negligent in failing to provide the kit.



Contributory negligence

       The casino may claim that Hale was contributorily negligent in walking without his cane,
reducing their liability. However, Hale’s actions were not negligent under the circumstances.


                                                 10
Although Hale could not see obstacles in his path, he was very familiar with the route and
proceeded cautiously to reduce the risk of accidents. It is reasonable for a person with Hale’s
disability to expect that the casino management, which had known him for three years, would
alert him in the event that a low-lying, hazardous obstacle had appeared on the floor in the area
of the casino where he worked. Given that he received no such warning, Hale was reasonable in
using his hands instead of his cane to feel for obstacles on his short, familiar walk to the
restroom, and was therefore not contributorily negligent.



Proximate cause

       LDC may argue that Hale’s death was not a harm within the risk associated with their
negligence because the harm expected from a ceiling collapse is that people will be injured by
falling pieces of the ceiling. However, Hale’s death was a harm within the risk of not clearing the
site quickly.

       LDC may also argue that Hale’s death was an unforeseeable type of harm when they left
the rubble on the floor, since most people are able to avoid obstacles in their path and usually
suffer minor cuts and bruises when they trip. However, many old people spend time at casinos.
Not only do the elderly have worse eyesight, but they also have limited mobility and balance,
and are much more likely to suffer serious injury or death from a fall. Given that many of the
casino’s clientele are likely elderly, it was foreseeable that someone may trip and die as a result
of the rubble being left on the floor during the casino’s business hours.



Conclusion

       The lower court’s findings should be affirmed on the grounds that LDC breached its duty
to Hale by not clearing the pile of rubble quickly. This negligence was a ‘but for’ and a
proximate cause of Hale’s death.
