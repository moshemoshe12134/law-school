                                         Instructions

       This is a 4-hour in-class exam.

        You may use any course materials we assigned or distributed, plus any outlines or
notes that you or your classmates have prepared. You may not do outside research. You
may not consult with anyone during the exam. If a question seems unclear or if a key
fact seems to be missing, then please state your best reading of the question or your
sensible assumption about the key fact, and continue with your answer.

       The exam is designed to take 3 hours, thus allowing you extra time to organize,
review, rethink, and edit. Planning your answers before you start writing is likely to be a
very good use of time.

       Space is very limited and you will need to be concise. Please write in complete
sentences. You will be rewarded for clear organization, brevity, precise thinking, and
good writing. Using headings and signposts may help. Cite cases or other sources when
it makes your answer clearer. Do not use footnotes.

       Please supply a word count for each question. Include headings and signposts in
the count. You must stay within the limits: 1400 words for Question 1 and 1200 words
for Question 2.

       You should answer both questions. Each question will be worth 1/2 of the grade.
Please do budget your time carefully.

        Remember that your aim is to demonstrate how thoughtful and nuanced you can
be in using what we covered in class, along with any “facts” given by the exam, to craft
your arguments—and counter-arguments.

       I wish you the best of luck!

                                        Question 1

                                     Limit: 1400 words


        Wildfires have scarred the forests of your state for over two years now, searing
the land, leaving behind tons of toxic ash, and sending plumes of smoke into the air. A
long drought more severe than anyone can remember continues to elevate both the risk
and the intensity of the fires. In a cruel twist, the drought is also drying up the state’s
rivers and lakes—which firefighting airplanes and helicopters often draw upon as ready
sources of freshwater, a superb natural extinguisher.

       Aerial firefighters do have a special technique, however, for making freshwater
even more efficient as an extinguisher. Chemicals called “foams,” which work like the
detergents that allow shampoos to lather up, can be added to the water before it is
unloaded onto a fire. The type of foams commonly used for wildfires lowers the water’s
surface tension, in effect allowing the water molecules to spread out and better saturate
the burning vegetation.

        For years, your state’s forestry agency has depended on a private contractor,
WildFair, for all its firefighting needs. WildFair is widely seen as a leader in the
industry, with a strong research staff known for its savvy in testing and adopting new
technologies. For the extreme conditions of this year’s fires, WildFair is pioneering the
use of a new-to-market foam additive called H-5, which has tested safe for human and
animal contact and is also more effective than pre-existing foams. WildFair has also
decided that this year’s unusually bad combination of strong fires and low water supplies
requires the use of H-5 in a concentration 10 times higher than instructed by the foam’s
manufacturer.

        WildFair’s innovative use of H-5 has been successful—from the firefighting
perspective. But not everyone is pleased. Some farms and fisheries near the fires that
WildFair has recently fought have started to notice that their animal stocks are falling ill
or even dying off at surprising rates. A handful of farmers and fishery owners have now
formed a loose coalition, sending a letter to WildFair demanding answers and threatening
to sue.

        The coalition’s letter includes a copy of several leaked internal documents
showing WildFair’s deliberations about how to use H-5. The documents show that
WildFair did satisfy the state’s regulatory standards for using H-5 at ultra-high
concentrations: according to the cost-benefit calculations required by the regulations, the
benefits of using H-5 in this way are worth the risks. Those regulations, however, only
require accounting for the risks to human safety—but not for risks to livestock or to local
businesses. What infuriates the farmers and fishery owners is that in its internal
deliberations, WildFair chose not to evaluate those further risks.

                                                                       Prof. Huang, Spring 2015




        As it turns out, WildFair’s chief scientist did express internally her suspicion that
dumping water mixed with H-5 at such unusually high concentrations might cause more
of the toxic ash created by wildfires to seep through the surface layers of the land and
into the groundwater, potentially affecting downstream uses of the water. But WildFair’s
top management directed her not to waste any time pursuing such tangents—and instead
to focus on just the calculations that the regulations specified.

        The coalition’s letter also includes a map of the roughly two dozen farms and
fisheries suffering the worst losses of livestock; the map shows that although they are
scattered geographically, these farms and fisheries do share one feature: the streams and
rivers running through them are fed by groundwater collecting under the various sites of
fires where WildFair had recently used H-5. And although different kinds of livestock
have suffered in different ways, the various ailments are all related to excessive contact
with wildfire-generated toxic ash.

        Ever since receiving this letter, WildFair has stopped using H-5 and returned to
using standard foams at standard concentrations. It is something of an irony that the
current effectiveness of this back-to-basics approach is due largely to WildFair’s earlier
successes in using H-5 to control the worst sites of wildfire.

                                            ***

        You are an attorney at a firm that represents WildFair. The top litigation partner
emails you a copy of the letter from the coalition. He then stops by your office, saying:
“Please write me a short memo analyzing any potential tort liability that our client might
face—and how we might respond. No need to do any research yet. For each issue, just
sketch for me the better potential arguments and strategies on both sides. I do realize that
many facts have yet to be discovered. If there are any crucial facts we should be sure to
find out while preparing our defense, please do say so.”

       He adds: “There have not yet been any tort cases in this state about the use of
foams or about aerial firefighting. So you should not be shy in suggesting arguments
about how the state’s tort law should treat these facts, given that the courts will likely be
dealing with some issues of first impression here.”

         Prepare this short memo. If you need to make any assumptions about the
facts or about state law, please do so and state them clearly. (You may assume what
you wish about where your state stands, on any issues of tort law on which the states
differ.)

                                       Question 2

                                   Limit: 1200 words

        You are a legal policy analyst at the American Law Institute who specializes in
torts remedies. One day the research director comes to you with a pensive look—and a
request. “As you know,” she says, “one of the reasons for torts damages is to give an
actor incentives to take into account any potential harmful effects on others, when
choosing how to act. For example, if your action might injure me, the threat of
compensatory damages gets you to internalize the risk of harm to me that your action
creates. You break, you pay.”

        She continues: “But now consider these two broad categories of situations. First,
suppose that my injury also hurts you in some way (even before you have to pay any
damages). For example, maybe you care a lot about me and so you ‘feel my pain.’ Or
maybe you have a financial stake in my economic success. Or maybe there’s some other
way in which your well-being is linked to mine. In cases like these, shouldn’t you get a
discount on the damages you have to pay—given that you’ll already be ‘paying’ in some
sense if I get hurt?”

        “Second,” she says, “there’s the opposite category, where you enjoy some extra
benefit if I get hurt. Maybe you just hate me. Or maybe you have a financial stake in my
loss or failure. (And so forth.) In cases like these, shouldn’t you have to pay extra
damages—given that you also ‘profit’ in some sense if I get hurt?”

       She then specifies: “For each of those two broad categories, please brainstorm for
me: In what kinds of torts cases would such an adjustment to damages make lots of
sense? And when might it make less sense? What factors should the law consider in
deciding whether—and how much—to adjust damages in these ways, if at all?”

        She instructs: “Please use specific scenarios or hypotheticals to illustrate your
points. Be imaginative! No research is needed, but of course you’re welcome to bring up
any existing examples (from torts or any other area of law) where adjustments like these
are already in use.”

       Prepare this memo. Remember to address both categories.
