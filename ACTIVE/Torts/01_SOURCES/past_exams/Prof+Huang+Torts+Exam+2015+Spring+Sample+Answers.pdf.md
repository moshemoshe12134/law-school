Prof. Huang – Torts – Spring 2015


Question 1, Sample Answer 1


Negligence

          The farmers will likely argue that WF’s failure to adequately consider the risks to their
farms and stock, and to take additional precautions before administering an ultra-high dose of H5
to their land, was negligent. They can argue that, in conducting the cost/benefit analysis
mandated by the statute, WF failed to account for the risks they were posing to animals and
wildlife, thus underestimating the magnitude of the loss that could occur. The farmers will
emphasize several precautions our client did not take before administering the heightened dose
of H5: they did not call the manufacturer to clarify how 10 times the recommended dose would
affect animals, and they did not conduct a test themselves. These precautions would have
presented a relatively small burden, they will argue, as compared with the significant damage
that could foreseeably result. The farmers can also point to WF’s failure to follow the
instructions of the foam manufacturer. (It might be useful to know whether the manufacturer
provided adequate warning about what could result from exceeding the recommended dose; if it
did not, we might be able to implead them for their failure to warn our client of the risks
associated with overuse of their product.) Multiplying the recommended usage by ten did likely
carry some foreseeable consequences, with or without explicit warning.

        The farmers will also use our client’s position as industry leader in an effort to increase
the standard of care to which they will be held, and a jury will be allowed to consider that
expertise to our detriment. Finally, the fact that WF explicitly engaged in cost/benefit analysis
and quantified the value of human life at all, although natural in its industry and others (indeed
encouraged by tort law itself) will be seen as cold and calculative by a jury, and the farmers will
use that against us.

         Our client’s having met the state’s regulatory requirements for ultra-high H5 levels might
help our cause, but it will not insulate them from liability entirely. Though it will be difficult to
counter the farmer’s reasoning that the risk of substantial harm to animals from spraying
chemicals from the sky was foreseeable, we can re-scope the burden that taking additional
precautions would have presented. The potential benefits of increasing the dose were not only
considerable but immediately necessary. The burden of taking further precautions not only
encompassed the financial burden to WF, but also the burden of additional time wasted, both to
the environment and to these farmers themselves, exposed to the threat of unprecedented wildfire
without WF’s immediate assistance. We might further argue that, for a pioneer of new treatments
for wild fires, there are by definition no customary standards to follow; any innovator must take
risks if advances are going to be achieved.
         It would be difficult to argue that the farmers and fishermen were comparatively
negligent: they did nothing except allow their stock to feed and drink the way they normally do,
and it is unclear whether they even knew or could have foreseen the increased concentration of
H5 or its effects on their animals.


Nuisance

        The farmers might also bring a claim for nuisance, arguing that WF’s overuse of H5 was
a substantial, unreasonable and intentional invasion of their use of their land. That the invasion
was substantial and intentional will be hard to counter, and they might be able to prove
unreasonable for the same reasons addressed in their negligence argument. Yet WF’s conduct is
clearly beneficial to society, which would typically offer an out at least in the form of payment of
damages rather than the enjoining of the activity. Since WF has already reduced H5 levels
(making damages the appropriate remedy to start with), we might try to convince a court that our
client’s liability should be further reduced because of the value of its activity to society.


Causation

         We might argue that WF’s increased use of H5 was not a but-for cause of the animals’
illnesses. Their ailments were a result of excessive contact with the ash created by wildfires; it is
possible that the animals would have become ill even without the increased use of H5, which
may or may not have enabled the ash to contaminate the water. Yet even WF’s scientist
suspected that the H5 would negatively impact the solubility of the ash into the water, and it is
likely that our client’s increased use of H5 was necessary in order for the ash to poison the water.
Therefore, the farmers can convincingly argue that the presence of the toxic ash alone would not
have killed their stock, and that when there are mutiple necessary causes and one is non-tortious,
liability should be imposed on the tortious cause.

        Once causation-in-fact is established, it will be difficult to argue that WF was not a
proximate cause of the harm. We might be able to argue that the ash was an intervening cause,
and that the foam alone would not have poisoned the water to such a degree. But the farmers can
argue that unforeseeability of the manner of harm will not cut off WF’s liability (Smith).
Poisoning land and water, thus harming livestock, is likely a foreseeable type of harm within the
risk of spraying land with chemicals. Perhaps more importantly, the farmers can argue that WF
was the cheapest cost avoider of the accident: the victims likely did not know about the increased
H5 use, and could not have foreseen its consequences even if they did.


Damages

        Each with damage too small to sue individually, the farmers are likely to seek
certification as a class. Because WF has already returned to previous H5 levels, an injunction
will not be necessary, so they are likely to seek a damages class under FRCP 23(b)(3).
Depending on the number of members in the coalition of farmers, they will likely meet the
numerosity requirement. Yet we can argue that they do not meet the heightened commonality
and predominance requirements as articulated by Wal-Mart. These farmers do not have the same
injury for which there will be a common answer: some are fishermen, some herd cattle and
sheep, others likely focus on agriculture. Furthermore, their farms are scattered geographically
and likely were sprayed with different levels of H5, some perhaps not sprayed at all. Just as the
Wal-Mart plaintiffs’ heterogenous makeup and distinct injuries barred their certification, so
should these plaintiffs be barred. If we succeed in blocking their certification, it will be easier
and cheaper for our counsel to defend against or settle individual suits.

         However, the farmers will counter that a certifying court could get around the small
breaks in commonality by focusing on our client’s conduct rather than on the plaintiffs’
individual harms (BP II). WF’s distrubution of increased levels of H5 was the “single source” of
all of their slightly different injuries (Met-Coil). Furthermore, the most crucial difference among
these plaintiffs is probably their relative extent of harm. We can argue that Wal-Mart and
Comcast suggest that a class needs common damages to be certified, but this argument has been
rejected by at least two federal cours of appeals. The farmers can argue that our jurisdiction
should follow the lead of the 7th Circuit by interpreting Comcast not to require identical
damages (Sears). They will suggest that their common issues (whether WF was negligent in
administering 10x the standard H5, whether the H5 caused the ash to poison the water, etc.) can
be addressed as a class, after which they can be divided into subclasses based on their location or
type of stock.

        If certification seems likely, we might encourage the farmers to create a settlement class.
Because the farmers have already sent WF a letter and their staff has already reacted by limiting
the use of H5 back to normal levels, it seems like effective bargaining is possible. Our client also
wants the state and its citizens to continue using them for their fire-fighting needs. If further
investigation into causation reveals that liability is also likely, this method would save us both
time and resources.
Question 1, Sample Answer 2


Negligence: Use of Higher Concentration

The coalition will argue that WildFair was negligent in its decision to use 10x the manufacturer’s
instructed concentration. WildFair may counter that they met the state regulatory standards. This
means that they are not negligent per se and provides evidence in their favor, but is not
dispositive on the issue of negligence. The state regulatory standards did not take into account
the risks to livestock or to local businesses, and WildFair was aware of this fact; the coalition can
argue that the state standard therefore pertained only to the negligence of actions that resulted in
harm to human safety, and therefore harm to their livestock and businesses that resulted from
WildFair’s conduct should not be governed by the state regulatory duty of care.

Looking past the state standard, the coalition will argue that WildFair was negligent because,
rather than deciding that their actions outweighed the risk to the coalition, they completed
disregarded the coalition in their calculus. In a BPL analysis, it is clear that the L would be great,
as the livelihoods of the coalition are at stake. The P is unclear, and there need to be additional
facts to determine how probable this harm was, as the only evidence we have is the suspicion
that it was possible from the chief scientist. The B here is potentially huge, if using the higher
concentration of the H-5 was the only way to safely prevent the fires from consuming the state,
then the burden of not doing would be catastrophic. If this is the case, then the coalition would
have a very difficult time arguing that WildFair was negligent, but if there was an alternative
solution that would have simply cost WildFair more money, but would have significantly
decreased the risk of harm to the coalition, then the coalition can argue that the BPL analysis
weighs in favor of negligence, provided that B is ultimately less than PL.

The coalition may argue that the fact that WildFair has reverted back to normal concentrations is
evidence that they recognize that they were negligent, but this is a weak argument, as it seems
that WildFair reverted because the effectiveness of the prior concentrations made it so normal
concentrations are now all that is necessary.

The coalition has maps that link the use of H-5 to their businesses, and the ailments of their
livestock are all related to excessive contact with wildfire-generate toxic ash. WildFair seems to
be the but-for cause of their harm. One argument that WildFair can bring here, if they can
establish that the animals would have been injured by the ash regardless of the concentration of
the H-5 and the use of the higher concentrations did not increase the risk, is that the harm would
have been realized even in the absence of their allegedly negligent actions. WildFair’s chief
scientist’s statements seem to suggest that the downstream water effects would be an unusual
occurrence, linked only to higher concentrations of the H-5, so this argument likely has little
merit. WildFair’s can also argue that if they had not acted at all, the fires would have burned
down the coalitions farms, making their actions not the but-for cause. But this argument would
likely fail, because WildFair is still the preemptive cause, and would be held liable as the cause
of the actual harm.
The harm to the animals is a proximate cause of WildFair’s actions. The statement from the chief
scientist demonstrates that they foresaw this risk. A foreseeable risk is a risk within the harm,
and within the scope of liability.

If it is proven that the higher concentrations of H-5 were necessary to save the state from being
consumed in fire, then the court would likely find that WildFair was not negligent in using the
higher concentrations, because of the aforementioned negligence calculus, as well as for reasons
of public policy. Deincentivizing WildFair from fighting fires would result in great harm to the
public.

Negligence: Duty to Warn

The coalition can argue that because WildFair was aware of the risk to the coalition, they should
have warned them of the potentially toxic groundwater. Normally, there are no affirmative
duties, but because WildFair is creating the risk, their misfeasance imports upon them a duty to
mitigate the damage. Under this BPL analysis, the P and the L stay the same as before, but the B
shrinks considerably. All they needed to do was send out a bulletin, and then the coalition could
have taken steps to guard their livestock by using water from other sources away from the danger
zones of the H-5. The coalition could argue that because of the drought in the state, the coalition
could not have acquired alternative sources of water and therefore the warning would not have
prevented the harm, and therefore is not the but-for cause of their harm. This argument depends
on additional facts, most importantly if the coalition had access to alternative sources of water.

If the coalition had access to alternative sources of water, which they would have no reason to
use unless warned of the risk of toxic groundwater (therefore not contributorily negligent), then
WildFair likely would be found negligent in failing to warn the coalition of the risk. If there were
no alternative sources of water and no other solutions that the coalition could have taken had
they been warned, then WildFair would not be found negligent for failing to warn, as their
omission was not the but-for cause of the coalition’s harm.

Nuisance

The coalition can argue that WildFair committed an intentional nuisance by using the higher
concentration of the H-5. Although they have returned to using the standard concentrations, they
were aware of the risks at the time of the nuisance. The coalition would likely not win this claim,
because WildFair’s actions would likely not be found to be unreasonable, unless there were
alternatives to fighting the fire. WildFair is a leader in the fire-fighting industry, using what they
saw necessary to fight the fires. If using higher concentrations of H-5 was the only way to fight
the fires, then the utility of their conduct (saving the entire state), far outweighs the gravity of
harm to the coalition (their individual livelihoods), seeing as how their farms would have been
destroyed anyway if the fires could not have been put out.

Class Action

If the coalition succeeds on any of its claims, then they have the potential to be certified as a
class. In order to be certified, the coalition needs to meet the four elements of FRCP 23.
It is unclear how many individuals would have a valid claim, but the court determined in Parko
v. Shell that how many members have a valid claim is an issue to be determined after, this does
not defeat numerosity.

The biggest hurdle for the coalition is that of commonality. This case can be distinguished from
Henry v. Dow, where the court determined that dioxin in the flood plain gives rise to different
injures that require different remediation, because the groundwater toxicity resulted in injury to
the coalition’s livestock. The injuries are different and the livestock have suffered in different
ways, but injured livestock in most situations is worthless livestock, making the exact type of
injury a less important question. WildFair can also argue that the coalition requires different
damages but like Butler v. Sears, this case is to determine liability, not damages, so the fact that
people are at different stages or levels of injuries is irrelevant. The court can create sub-classes.

Remedies

If WildFair is found to be negligent, seeing as how they have already reverted back to the
original concentration, the court would likely not issue an injunction. Even if they were still
using the same higher level of concentration, if that concentration was necessary to fight fires,
for reasons of public safety, the court would not issue an injunction. The likely form of remedies
would be compensatory damages for the coalition’s livestock and perhaps consequential business
damages, as these risks were clearly foreseeable and foreseen by WildFair.
Question 1, Sample Answer 3



Negligence

Plaintiffs will likely allege that WildFair (WF) was negligent in using H-5 in much higher
concentrations than instructed by the foam’s manufacturer. Plaintiffs might argue that, although
H-5 was tested safe in much lower concentrations, WF failed to take ordinary care by
disregarding the manufacturer’s instructions re: concentration and by using large amounts of
concentrated H-5 without testing its effects on livestock. Although WF met the state’s regulatory
standards for using concentrated H-5, this will not dispositively exculpate them, and plaintiffs
will probably point out that these regulatory standards were enacted only for the purpose of
protecting humans, so complying with them does not mean that WF was not negligent in regards
to the risk to livestock health and safety.

In defending itself against negligence claims, WF should emphasize that using H-5 in a way
most likely to mitigate fire devastation did not deviate from an ordinary standard of care under
the circumstances. Applying the Hand formula, the burden of not using concentrated H-5 could
have been very high. If WF had used only the recommended concentration, the fires might not
have subsided, leading to even greater probable damage to the
environment/people/infrastructure/livestock. If they had waited to use H-5 in high concentrations
until after testing it on livestock, the fires might have spread quickly and caused even greater
devastation. Compared to the loss of a few livestock and fish - even if the probability of such
loss was high - the burdens associated with not immediately using concentrated H-5 seemed to
far outweigh the loss that could have - and did - occur due to its use. Because juries tend to react
negatively to such analyses - especially when, as WF did, a company explicitly did a cost-benefit
caluclation (Ford), WF should emphasize the human cost that would likely have been incurred
had WF not used the H-5 as it did. This was more than just an economic cost-benefit analysis -
this was a careful balancing of devastating harms from the fire compared with relatively low
harms to some livestock from using concentrated H-5.

Second, WF could argue that the farmers and fishery owners were unforeseeable plaintiffs, and
that they therefore were owed no duty of care (Palsgraff). This is a weaker argument than the
first, as it seems hard to believe that anyone whose property was near the site of H-5 application
would not foreseeably be affected by its use. Plus, at least one person in WF management (chief
scientist) expressly foresaw livestock owners as possibly affected by H-5. Perhaps more
compelling would be to argue that the damage to livestock was an unforeseeable type of harm,
and that - particularly since the regulatory standards did not take into account harm to livestock
and fish - this was not within the scope of liability (Wagon Mound). However, again due to the
express concerns of the chief scientist, a court might not be convinced that harm to groundwater
and livestock were truly unforeseeable - particularly given WF’s strong research staff known for
its extensive testing.
Trespass

Plaintiffs might also bring a claim for trespass. Because 1) WF intentionally applied H-5 to
neighboring areas (where the fires were), 2) particles can constitute physical invasion (Martin),
and 3) there might have been causation between the H-5 in the groundwater and the resulting
harm to livestock and fish (although perhaps not - see below for discussion on causation),
plaintiffs might be able to show that H-5 application constituted trespass. Even under the more
modern versions of trespass that sometimes require a showing of actual harm, plaintiffs could
argue that the illness and death to their livestock and fish amounted to actual harm.

WF should bring two defenses against a claim of trespass (in addition to challenging causation;
again, see below). First and foremost, WF should argue for a defense of public necessity.
Because 1) risk of the fires continuing to burn/spread would have severely affected a potentially
catastrophic number of people (due to the fires themselves, terrible air quality, and drying up of
natural water sources), and 2) WF’s actions in abating the fires through the use of high levels of
H-5 reduced/eliminated that risk, WF should be entitled to the absolute privilege provided by the
defense of public necessity. Second, although this is a much weaker argument, WF should argue
that it did not intend for the H-5 to enter onto plaintiffs’ land -- it only intentionally applied the
H-5 to surrounding areas. This is not as compelling as the public necessity argument, especially
since it was probably foreseeable that large amounts of concentrated H-5 sprayed from an
airplane or helicopter could travel through air or water to nearby land.

Causation

Plaintiffs will need to argue that the application of concentrated H-5 was both the cause-in-fact
and the proximate cause of the injury to the animals. Because it appears that the animals might
not have been exposed to such high levels of the toxic ash in the groundwater if not for the use of
concentrated H-5, plaintiffs may be able to demonstrate causation-in-fact. Additionally, they
have a compelling argument that damage to livestock was not only a foreseeable consequence of
concentrated H-5 (in fact, WF’s chief scientist did foresee it), but that it was a harm within the
risk of high levels of H-5, particularly since these foams had been specifically tested for their
effects on animals.

WF’s best defense to the causation argument is that there was a strong superceding cause - the
fire - and that the H-5 was therefore not a true but-for cause. Had WF not used H-5 at the levels
it did, not only would the livestock potentially have still been exposed to high levels of toxic ash
(as they had been for two years prior - perhaps it was just build-up from those two years that
coincided with the use of H-5!), they might have even burned to death from uncontrolled fires or
otherwise suffered/died due to the drying up of rivers and lakes. WF should therefore try to
characterize the toxic ash from the previous two years as a pre-emptive or superceding cause to
show that its use of concentrated H-5 was neither a cause in fact nor a proximate cause of the
damage to livestock.
Class Certification

Plaintiffs might also try to certify a class of farmers and fishery owners affected by WF’s
conduct. If plaintiffs can prove that there are enough of them to constitute a class (the two dozen
who signed onto the letter plus others might be enough), that they all suffered a common injury
(this is where WF might have the strongest defense - see below), and that they could adequately
represent the typical claims of a class of others similarly situated, a court might find a class
action appropriate (FRCP 23).

WF may be able to defeat class certification if it can show that plaintiffs did not suffer the same
injury and therefore did not meet the commonality requirement of FRCP 23(a)(2) (Dukes, Dow).
However, because the injuries to each plaintiff, although different, arose out of the same conduct
and may be addressed by a common answer (e.g. enjoining WF from using H-5 in such high
concentrations), plaintiffs may be able to successfully argue that there is more “glue” holding
their claims together than in Dow or Dukes, and that there is less need for individualized factual
inquiries so long as they can show that all of their groundwater was affected by H-5 and that this
was the cause for all of their livestock damage. If plaintiffs argue that the common injury was
contamination of the groundwater - rather than the different kinds of harm to the livestock - they
will be even more likely to win on class certification. Additionally, a court might be willing to
certify subclasses if there are only a few distinct categories of harm to each kind of livestock.

WF might not, however, be best served by strongly opposing a litigation class action. It might be
in WF’s best interest to allow a class to be certified - especially given its strong public necessity
defense - since a court’s decision would then be binding on all farmers and fishery owners in the
area. Additionally, if WF does believe it might be subject to some liability, a settlement class
action might be more efficient and less costly than litigating these claims individually.
Question 2, Sample Answer 1


Discount

       Three types of cases in which the discount may be applicable are considered:

Institutions and Corporations: BP

        The damage caused by the BP oil spill caused a significant drop in the firm’s stock price
and profits. People likely either lost their jobs or were internally reprimanded. And the damage
to BP’s goodwill was significant; it will take years and millions of dollars to rehabilitate their
brand. So, from the perspective of redressing social grievances, in addition to the right to sue,
those affected have been partially vindicated by the media backlash, BP’s losses, and community
investments. Further, affected communities have arguably been compensated by investments that
go beyond cleaning up the spill (e.g. new jobs, new renewable energy projects). From a
deterrence perspective, the bad PR alone may well ensure that BP and other oil companies, at
least for a few years, are more careful with respect to oil well operations. Thus, a discount on
damages has some support.

       But, the reasons for denying BP a discount are stronger, even if BP wasn’t reckless.
Notions of corrective justice and civil recourse go beyond the monetary damages a defendant
pays. For corporate entities whose acts cause harm, there is arguably no “pain” felt beyond the
monetary impact. If damages are a way to restore a moral balance in society, then a discount is
properly withheld unless the institution’s moral wrong is demonstrably offset. The problem is,
while individuals can be remorseful, a corporation arguably cannot. Thus, in the BP case, a
discount on monetary damages would be a windfall, as “BP the company” is incapable of moral
atonement.

        Moreover, even if investments or decreases in profit are showings of remorse, corporate
entities always face a discount in damages. Insurance and the existence of stockholders create
loss distribution effects and a reduction in total actual damages. Corporate entities are well
represented in courts, and may face reduced liability due to effective argumentation. So, where
victims are individuals or communities and the plaintiff is a large tortious institution or
corporation, discounted damages should not be allowed.

Professionals

        If there is a professional relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant, there is a
stronger case that real pain has been felt by the plaintiff. For example, if a therapist has a violent
patient who threatens to and does kill another of the therapist’s regular patients, the therapist may
be liable for failure to report. If his reason for not reporting was a good faith belief in his ability
to prevent such an outcome and help his violent patient, he likely feels a great deal of pain and
guilt. Moreover, liability also impacts his future business. Similarly, where a doctor’s negligent
diagnosis kills a patient, it is plausible that there is real pain felt on an economic and emotional
level by that doctor. Finally, a discount in damages arguably doesn’t result in a corresponding
decrease in deterrence effects. Individual actors are seldom purely rational agents, and some
discount may well have the desired deterrence.

        However, professionals often have liability reducing mechanisms such as insurance, both
personally and through their company. Moreover, unlike with corporations, professionals don’t
have the financial capacity to make investments or compensatory expenditures beyond the legal
system, so, from a corrective justice and compensatory standpoint, a victim may well be left
undercompensated. This is true even in a moral sense - a doctor that negligently reduces his
patient’s chances of survival feels some moral pain, but surely not at a level experienced by the
decedent’s family and friends.

Neighbors

        The strongest case for a discount is between two individual parties with pre-existing
relationships. If a plaintiff, by digging a well, accidentally floods his neighbor’s land, his liability
may not account for the genuine remorse he feels. Or, if two friends are at a bar, and one, due to
voluntary intoxication, assaults another, the pain he suffers, e.g. by way of a lost friendship, is
demonstrable. Here, there is little probability that a defendant can reduce his liability through
existing means, and under-compensation of the plaintiff may be balanced by the non-monetary
moral correction of remorse. The primary goals of tort law go beyond just the individual actors
and hope to encourage socially optimal behavior. Some reduction in damages, possibly upon a
showing of “feeling the pain” seems to achieve this by promoting more than a purely economic
view to human relationships.

       Still, the presence of extra-legal norms furnishes ways for such discounts to exist. Not
every aggrieved individual litigates, and even those who hire a lawyer can change their mind
based on reconciliation. Moreover, from an optimal behavior perspective, a discount damages
rule may intrude on important social norms by reducing the incentives that people otherwise
have to show compassion and remorse upon potentially harmful acts.


Extra Damages

        First, if any enjoyment of extra benefit resulting from harm caused is based on
recklessness or intentional conduct, punitive damages serve as the appropriate alternative. As in
State Farm, a showing of harm motivated by financial gain can result in juries awarding
astronomical punitive damages. And, even subject to Constitutional limits, such extra damages
are arguably the tool through which society should express its moral outrage or deterrence
valuation. Further, State Farm shows the practical challenges associated with managing “extra
damages.” Lastly, criminal law is perhaps the best avenue through which “extra damages” for
evil purposes should be sought. From a fairness perspective, prosecutors in criminal cases face a
higher burden of proof. And, from an optimal deterrence perspective, if a signal of moral
condemnation motivates the desire for “extra damages,” the penalties of the criminal law system
are better suited to effectuating such messages.
        A stronger case for extra damages arises where recklessness or culpability are not
provable, and where statutory damages don’t otherwise apply. For instance, if a firm negligently
evaluates risks, and this negligence causes both its economic benefit and some combination of
economic, emotional, and physical harm to defendants, extra damages not covered by existing
tort categories might be warranted. The firm would be immune from punitive damages if it
introduces enough evidence to show ordinary negligence, and states may not have statutory
damages laws for the particular risk evaluation. Because such a firm is likely to have liability
shifting and reducing methods like insurance some sort of extra damages seems fair. Moreover,
full compensation of a victim of both economic and physical harm is unlikely. For example, per
Spamhaus, courts are free to evaluate the reasonableness of estimated damages, and a
sophisticated firm with top attorneys would likely poke holes in any estimates presented by a
defendant.

         However, from a practical perspective, extra damages should not be adopted even in such
cases. First, for emotional harm, pain and suffering damages and IIED / NIED represent recent
innovations designed to allow one form of “extra damages” for emotional harm. Standards for
these torts could be altered rather than introducing a new damages category. Second, there are
fair notice questions associated with the concept of “extra damages,” particularly if the concept
is so broadly defined as to cover “profits” from the negligent act. Finally, extra damages might
result in over deterrence of future actors.
Question 2, Sample Answer 2


The law should not “discount” damages in the case of a DF “paying” for a PL’s loss for two
reasons. First, attempting to calculate how much a defendant “feels an individual’s pain” would
be impracticable. Without a more concrete harm suffered or standard to measure against, any
discount on damages would be purely speculative. Tort law does not recognize “pure” emotional
or economic loss, which is what a DF would be suffering in this scenario. Moreover, those losses
would be a direct result of the DF’s own N. Allowing discounted damages would be tantamount
to excusing a DF’s negligence simply becasue they happened to be hurt too. Part of the calculus
that we want DF’s to make should include all reasonably foreseeable harms, including those to
themselves. If DFs could discount damages to PLs based on their own harms, this would result in
DFs making BPL calculations that do not sufficiently account for potential losses, or that do not
sufficiently value PLs harms.

Second, if we believe in compensation and civil recourse as aims of tort law, allowing DF’s to
discount their own damages would mean that PLs would be systematically under-compensated
for the injuries that they suffer as a result of DF’s N when a DF happens to be harmed as well.
That a DF has suffered too in no way diminishes the harm that a PL has suffered and should be
compensated for. Underpaying PLs in this manner may undercut the purpose of tort law as a
means of vindicating a victim’s need for recognition that they were wronged by this DF in a
manner proportional to the seriousness of the injury. A DF may argue that the imposition of
“full” damages in these situations may over deter DFs from taking socially productive risks by
punishing them out of proportion to the harm inflicted (as they must pay fully damages plus feel
their own pain). However, this seems a weak argument to me. As discussed above, it is more
likely that a DF would be under-deterred by such a system than over-deterred. The one case
where this may be true would be an instance of a socially valuable business whose own losses
coupled with the damages owed to PLs would shutter them. Perhaps in that case, the benefit of
the business remaining viable is more important than fully compensating the PL. However, this
would seem to be the exception and not the rule.

Consider a doctor who has committed malpractice. That doctor (we hope) cares that their patient
has been injured due to their negligence, and also likely has their own, independent stake in the
patient’s wellbeing. A doctor’s reputation may suffer from a malpractice claim, or their
insurance premiums may increase--they may literally pay for their negligence. However, all of
this is foreseeable to a doctor already, and should be part of the calculus that they make when
making decisions about their actions. If we were to “discount” the damage to a doctor’s
reputation or the increase to their insurance premiums, we would likely be disincentivizing
doctors from taking some of the precautions they would otherwise take, and that we want them
to take.

There is a strong argument to be made that the effectiveness of tort law depends on these “extra-
legal” incentives to take reasonable care. We both want and need that doctor to consider their
reputation and the other personal ramifications of committing malpractice. That an injury may
hurt a DF too (because they have a conscience and feel bad about harming another human being
or because their actions impact them as well as others) is actually what we hope for in tort law.
These extra-legal incentives can be seen as “closing the gap” between the limits of monetary
damages and the aims of tort law (optimal deterrence and corrective justice most prominently).
Indeed, it is possible to see punitive damages as being inflicted in those cases where these extra-
legal incentives do not exist (primarily for large corporations that cannot feel as an individual DF
does, or those actors who are so grossly negligent that we believe they may not have the same
moral compass), suggesting that tort law relies on DFs feeling their own kind of pain, and seeks
to impose it (through punitive damages) where it does not exist naturally.

Under this second category of cases--where a DF benefits in some fashion from the PL’s harm--
tort law often does impose extra damages in form of punitive damages. In the BP case, BP’s
cost-benefit analysis showed them that they would profit from not taking the care that might
have prevented the oil spill. They did profitted from cutting corners and harming PLs in this
manner. Likewise in the State Farm case, the company instituted its policy of pushing PLs to go
to trial rather than settling because it was cheaper for them even when it harmed the PLs (by
unfavorable trial outcomes). In both instances the court awared punitive damages to mitigate the
profits that the companies gained from the harm suffered by PLs. In these cases where a DF
makes some sort of cost calculation wherein their profits rely on their gross negligence or even
harm to PLs, the law imposes punitive damages to incentivize and deter behavior where an
ordinary damages award would not. Corporations are perhaps the most “rational” of actors from
an economic standpoint and the most likely to conduct clear cost-benefit analyses. In these cases
it makes the most sense to award extra damages where the DF benefits in some sense from the
PL’s losses, because corporations are most likely to be responsive. Additionally, these damages
can be readily calculated by DFs allowing them to make ex ante decisions regarding their
behavior, and to be deterred from acting in that way in the first place.

However, in the case of an actor who simply hates another person and wishes to see them hurt or
suffer in some fashion, the argument for extra damages becomes harder. Much like the argument
for not discounting DF’s damages based on their emotional pain--attempting to calculate
damages based on how much a DF hates the PL would be purely speculative. Punitive damages
may still serve a sense of corrective justice or civil recourse for both the PL (a sense that they
have been appropriately compensated for the level of harm done) and a broader society (a sense
of satisfaction that a DF has been appropriately punished), but it is harder to justify them from a
compensatory or deterrence standpoint. How can you calculate what hatred is “worth”? If an
individual is acting purely out of spite or malice, they may not even be a rational actor such that
they would be responsive to the imposition of extra damages. Or even if they are, how can a jury
determine the appropriate level of damages to deter their spite? In this case, deterrence may be
beyond the scope of tort law, and may be best left to the realm of criminal law.
Question 2, Sample Answer 3


Courts should consider extra-legal (dis)incentives when imposing damages. However, there are
many administrative and theoretical problems with doing so. Courts, thus, should consider
factors to determine if and how to discount or upgrade damages based on them.


1. It makes more sense in the following cases:


A. Discrimination (Upgrade). One aim of tort law is to impose moral judgement. With that in
mind, let’s say everyone’s (least) favorite neighborhood bigot is known for trash-talking the
LGBT community. Mr. Bigot, additionally, just inherited a pizza-shop outside of the everyone’s
favorite gay bar. One night, a group of LGBT law students go from the bar to the pizza shop.
Unfortunately, Mr. Bigot accidentally forgot to get rid of some bad cheese and uses it for our law
students’ pizza. In that case, Mr. Bigot should be liable for extra damages because he is not
sufficiently deterred thanks due his discriminatory beliefs. While society does not like to
punished thought crimes (here “thought torts”?), we are more willing to do so when it results in
an act. Under this approach, Mr. Bigot would be deterred from being discriminatory.
Additionally, the law students are being compensated for the added indignities of of the side of
discriminatory negligence that came with their pizza.


B. Business partnership/Common Damages (Downgrade). Luis and Diana just finished med
school and their residency. Not wanting to continue the grueling work of emergency-room care,
they decide go back to their hometown and start a practice, focusing on underserved families.
Thus, their financial lives are intertwined. Unfortunately, one day while golfing together, Luis
forgets to yell “fore,” and hits Diana unconscious, delaying their business plan a couple months.
In this case, some of the damages Diana seeks are the same damages Luis is suffering. In this
case, then, Luis would have been adequately deterred because he would have suffered similarly
if he hit himself with a golf ball.


2. It makes less sense in the following cases:


A. Compensation (Upgrade or Downgrade). One problem with this approach is that it focuses
solely on ex-ante deterrence. Another traditional aim of tort law is to compensate a victim ex-
post. For example, if my sister (who ostensibly loves me very much) crashes into my car, I am
not going to be able to fix my care with either the discounted sum or her positive feelings toward
me. The same is true for my brother (who I suspect does not like me). If he crashes into my car, I
would love to receive some extra money (and for a jury to declare as a matter of fact that he does
not like me!) to pay for my spring break trip. In that case, I will be over-compensate. I will be
over-compensated. But, there’s a solution: If there is ever over-compensation under this theory, it
should go into a state fund that is used to pay victims whenever there is under-compensation.
B. Relationship between care and act (Upgrade or Downgrade). Take my sister again, the one
who negligently crashed into my car when I was not in it. Like I said, she loves me very much
and would not want me to get hurt, but she does not love my car very much. She, of course, does
not want me to have to deal with a damaged car, but my life is not materially altered and she can
go about her merry day still loving me all the same. In this example, there was not much
relationship between the care and the negligent care, so discounting seems inappropriate as a
limit to deterrence. Of course, you could take these factors into consideration and discount the
discount.


C. Underlying motive (Upgrade). Imagine two businesses are in a partnership: take Apple and
Google, for example. They form an agreement for Google to be the default search provider on
Apple’s phone. On one account, Apple has extra incentive not to be negligent toward Google
because of this partnership. But then again, both Apple and Google make phone software, and if
Apple can hurt Google’s reputation, that might help Apple. In this example, there was an
underlying motive or at last multiple motives that would be hard for a court to discern.


D. Risks to other people (Downgrade). In tort law, there is no compensation without harm. So,
my best friend and I go to a bar known for playing darts. We drink a bit and become a little loose
with our dart-throwing behavior. At one point, I throw the dart, drunkenly thinking it’s going
straight for the bulls eye, when the dart is heading straight for someone with a shirt that has a
picture of a dart board. My friend, then, jumps in the way but ends up being injured. This
demonstrates the relationship between the care and act point, above, but it also tells us something
else: My act not only created a risk toward the person I care about, but it also created a risk to
innocents. The point is, the court should not discount my harm for that risk, especially in this
case, because the dart was headed toward someone else.


3. Courts should, thus, consider whether: there are common damages between the tortfeasor and
victim; there are innocents at risk; there are underlying or mixed motives; there is a substantial
relationship between the care/disdain/financial interest and act; and there will be over- or under-
compensation. Because of the probably speculative nature of the inquiry, unless firm evidence of
how much the actor took the others’ circumstances into account, the courts should use a set-
percentage (like 10%). Additionally, courts should consider the following factors:


A. Punitive Damages. If the court is already imposing punitive damages, the court should be less
likely to impose an upgrade. Because punitive damages already deter (for missing plaintiffs,
future plaintiffs, gross negligence, and/or bad faith), the judge should not consider upgrading
compensatory damages when they are imposed. Instead, the judge could just increase punitive
damages if she feels additional deterrence is appropriate.
B. Strict Liability. When a strict liability tort is at issue, the court should not impose upgrades.
Strict liability affects activity levels more so than care levels, and this approach is geared to the
BPL negligence analysis. On the other hand, perhaps courts want to discourage an activity even
more when it is motivated by a financial or negative interest.


C. Evidence. When evidence of upgrade or downgrade might bias the jury on the merits, this
method should not be used unless there is a phased trial. A jury is likely to be swayed by
additional (before possibly inadmissible) evidence about my sister’s love or brother’s disdain in
determining negligence. Likewise, if the evidence is unclear, speculative, tenuous, or private, a
judge should as a matter of law preclude it. The legitimacy of an upgraded/downgraded damages
approach depends on a sense of fairness. If I have the ability to get extra compensation, I am
going to try to recall every time my brother looked at me funny. This seems overly personal and
tenuous to be admitted into evidence, and a jury might have a hard time weighing this evidence.
