                                       Instructions

        This required but ungraded exercise is meant to give you some practice at writing
out an answer to a fact-pattern question, while staying within a typical word limit. Based
on your submitted answers, you will each receive individual feedback from one of our
TAs about your exam-writing approach and style.

        Please send your answer by 5 pm on Sunday, March 11, at the latest to
torts2018huang@gmail.com with the subject line “Practice Problems.” The word limit
for the question is listed below. Please be sure to give a word count at the end of your
answer.

        You are welcome to take as long as you would like for this practice exercise. It
may be more useful for you to spend longer than you would on a similar question on an
actual exam, as you learn how to organize and edit an answer that stays within the word
limit. The length of this practice question is meant to approximate one of two questions
on a 4-hour exam (the other being a policy question).

        You should answer the question by focusing on the concepts, doctrines, and
modes of analysis that we have examined in class so far. You are welcome to bring in
fresh thinking, but you should not spend any time on cases or other legal materials that
we have not covered. The fact pattern originally comes courtesy of Prof. Blasi, and I
have modified it to match what we have covered so far in our course.

                                     Word limit: 1200

         Leroy Hale, who is blind, operated a candy stand as an independent contractor on
the premises of the Lucky Day Casino in Sparks, Nevada, from June 2012 until
November 2015. As a gesture of support for persons with disabilities, the Lucky Day
Corporation charged Hale a nominal rental fee of one dollar per year to set up his candy
stand in a part of its casino that was open to the public but without much traffic. On
November 16, 2015, shortly after 9 a.m., the hour when the casino opened, Hale left his
stand to go to the men’s room, which was located some seventy-five steps down a
corridor. As was his habit for this short trip, which he took several times each day, Hale
left his white tapping cane in his stand and relied on his familiarity with the area to
navigate the walk to the bathroom. As he always did when walking without his cane,
Hale proceeded at a measured pace and with one arm extended forward to give himself
early warning of any object in his path.

        On this particular trip, however, that precaution was to no avail. While walking
down the corridor, Hale stumbled over a pile of plaster chunks which had fallen from the
casino ceiling at 5 a.m. that morning and were lying in the center of the corridor
surrounded by a makeshift chain. The chain had been put in place by casino employees
in order to preserve the site so that photographs and measurements of the fallen ceiling
could be taken for purposes of insurance claims and potential lawsuits. This chain
tripped Hale, causing him to fall into the pile of jagged debris. In this fall, Hale was
badly cut in his right leg and began bleeding profusely.

        After several minutes, passersby entering the corridor noticed Hale, who appeared
to be going into shock. They yelled for help, and one of them called 911. Several
patrons of the casino ran to Hale and began to assist him. Among the first to reach him
was Dr. Jane Goul, a pulmonary specialist. She found that Hale was pale and
unresponsive, with a very faint pulse. Without delay, she made a tourniquet to reduce
blood loss, and began to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on Hale to
counteract the effect of shock on his circulation.

        Marilyn Swanson, the casino employee who was on-duty at the medical station at
the time, rushed to the aid of Hale within minutes of being summoned. Goul asked her
for an intubation kit, but Swanson told her that it was the casino’s policy not to have an
intubation kit on the premises because the casino’s emergency staff, none of whom were
nurses or paramedics, were not trained in intubation (i.e., inserting a tube into a patient to
aid breathing). Swanson then helped Goul perform CPR on Hale.

       These efforts were unsuccessful, and Hale died before the ambulance arrived.

       Hale’s wife and children are suing the Lucky Day Casino. At trial, the plaintiffs’
evidence shows that the building that houses the Lucky Day Casino was built in 1968 and
was purchased by the Lucky Day Corporation in 1990, at which time it was reconfigured
for use as a casino. Prior to opening for business in 1991, the casino contracted with
John Lepore to repair portions of the plaster ceiling in the same corridor where the
accident occurred; then, in 1996, the casino installed a new drop ceiling there, again
hiring Lepore to do the work. (The original plaster ceiling remained in place above this
new drop ceiling.) Lepore testifies that he did not notice any problems with the original
plaster ceiling, on either occasion. Company records confirm that from 1996 until Hale’s
tragic accident in 2015, the casino did not inspect the plaster ceiling above the drop
ceiling, was unaware of any problems with the plaster ceiling, and made no repairs to it.

        The trial evidence establishes that the jagged debris on which Hale fell and cut
himself were fragments of the original 1968 plaster ceiling which had fallen through the
new drop ceiling. Lepore testifies that the section of the ceiling from which these pieces
fell was not near the areas he had repaired; he also speculates that the ceiling collapsed
due to its age. Gary Nies, the contractor who repaired the casino ceiling shortly after the
accident that led to Hale’s death, also testifies. He reports that before he patched the
ceiling at the point where the piece of plaster broke loose, he inspected the remainder of
the original plaster ceiling by removing selected tiles of the new drop ceiling and poking
his head through the opening into the space between the original and the drop ceiling.
With a flashlight he was able to examine the full expanse of the original ceiling. He
determined that the plaster was not sagging in any other area of the ceiling. Nor was
there any indication of water damage or other weakness in the original ceiling.

        Goul testifies that while administering first aid to Hale she requested an intubation
kit because she believed that endotracheal intubation (inserting a tube down the patient’s
throat into his upper airway leading to the lungs) would be the best way to restore his
breathing capacity. She asserts that there is a “small” chance that Hale might have
survived had such equipment been available. Plaintiff’s evidence shows that the medical
stations of large hotels have intubation kits available and personnel trained to use them,
but there is no evidence about the first-aid resources of mid-size casinos like Lucky Day
that are operated independently of a hotel.

       The jury returns a verdict for the plaintiffs. The defendant appeals.

        You are a judge on the panel of the appeals court assigned to this case.
Please draft a brief memo to your fellow judges sketching your analysis of the key
issues that arise in this case. Be sure to present any good arguments on all sides.
You may assume what you wish about where your state stands on any questions of
tort law on which the states differ; and you may assume that your court is willing to
modify tort law doctrines when there is such a need. If you must make any other
assumptions about the facts or the law, please do so and state them clearly.
