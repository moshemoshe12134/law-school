Prof. Huang – Torts – Fall 2015


Question 1, Sample Answer 1


NEGLIGENCE

The patients will claim the hospital was negligent for updating with erroneous code. It may have
been unreasonable to upload the new software without sufficiently testing it for bugs. The BPL
analysis weighs in their favor here: it would have been relatively uncostly to conduct more
thorough testing of the software, and even taking into account the cost of a potential hacking
during the extra testing time, the probable costs of not doing so (substantial medical events) are
very high. After all, it took only one week for the software team to discover their bug through
testing. Though it's not totally clear from the facts, it seems the internal BPL analysis assumed
the code would be accurate, and conducted the analysis based on that premise, which may also
have been negligent.

The hospital had an affirmative duty to its patients to undertake their care and maintain the
devices non-negligently; the doctors relied on the expectation that the proprietary software
worked properly, and based on that expectation, did not engage in more traditional techniques of
disease monitoring and management.

This last point highlights another untaken precaution: the hospital's failure to use traditional
monitoring during the transition to updated software. This would have been very uncostly (an
occasional phone call to each patient), the potential harms of a software failure would be great,
and the probility of a bug was non-negligible and fairly foreseeable. The fact that the doctors
immediately suspected a software failure supports the cotention that the bug was foreseeable.

The fact that this software is a relatively new innovation underscores the heightened risk. Given
the inherently risky nature of new medical procedures and devices, the hospital should have been
especially careful during any adjustments.

We could respond with a number of counterarguments. First, updating the software was an
appropriate (and, according to internal cost/benefit analysis, prudent) measure to protect the
patients from serious privacy breaches. Further, the BPL analysis should only incorporate the
risk of imperfect monitoring; not the risk of device malfunctions (since it was the syncing
software, rather than the device itself, that was compromised). Given that hackers were an
imminent threat to this function of the device anyways (as evidenced by previous hackings) this
was a reasonable decision. It may be unwise to speak in cost/benefit terms if we go to trial,
since juries tend to look unfavorably on such cynical calculations.

Lastly, we need to investigate what the professional standards for IMD software updates are.
Failure to adhere to those standards will be dispositive evidence of malpractice. We also should
investigate that these claims are not preempted by federal regulations since medical devices are
often regulated by federal law.

FAILURE TO WARN

The patients will argue that the hospital had a duty to warn them of the risk it was creating by
updating the software. We could respond that Horizon's internal considerations revealed no risks
warranting warning, since the hospital did not believe it would interrupt service or have an effect
on patients' health. The court should not hold the hospital responsible to warn about
unforeseeable risks.

More problematic was the hospital's instruction to the software team to conceal the error until it
was fixed. The hospital knew that the bug may have slightly increased the frequency of its
patients' episodes, and yet it failed to warn the patients or their physicians of the risk of
continued reliance on the software. A jury will find this decision especially offensive.

INFORMED CONSENT

The patients may bring an informed consent action. To assess the merit of this claim, we need to
know if the hospital, at the time of implantation, warned patients of the risk of buggy software
updates. The patients would also need to prove that they would not have chosen to receive the
software had they known of this risk, or that they would have chosen an alternative treatment.

They may claim that by updating the software-- essentially "changing" the device implanted
within them-- the hospital performed a procedure without their consent, which would be battery.
There are policy reasons for this extension of traditional tort doctrine; as the medical profession
innovates towards automated, high-tech disease management, more "procedures" will occur
remotely, or by the changing of some software or microscopic implant. However, we can
counter that the patients knew about and consented to occasional software updates.

CAUSATION

The patients would claim that the increased rate of hosptial admittance and health events among
patients during the period in question demonstrates that the bug and subsequent failure to warn
was the but-for cause of their harms. The case for causation would be particularly strong for
those patients who suffered strokes, since their medical events were directly related to an
untreated condition that likely would have been noticed had the devices been syncing properly.

However, disease management is extremely individualistic. Further, once word spread, the
doctors began checking in by phone, an adequate substitute for syncing. The correlation between
the bug and increased hospital admittance might also be explained by the fact that had the
software been working properly, the doctors would have called and assuaged patients' concerns
preemptively; the patients might have still experienced the same symptoms but simply not have
checked into the hospital had the devices been working.
PROXIMATE CAUSE

The patients will argue that software malfunction (and the attendant health monitoring effects)
are precisely the harm-within-the-risk that makes buggy health monitoring software (and a
failure to warn about it) tortious. The plantiffs type of harm (adverse health effects related to
insufficient monitoring), and manner/extent of harm are all quite foreseeable, since they were the
realization of those health risks the software was intended to address.

We could counter by saying that the type of harm was unforeseeable, since the software wasn't
intended for the actual medical functions of the device, but rather for the syncing of medical data
(the devices work when they're offline). However, the doctors' reliance on the software makes
this risk quite foreseeable.

STRICT LIABILITY

Plaintiffs could argue for strictly liability for use of IMDs with proprietary software. Since the
software was proprietary it is, by definition, not a matter of common usage. Further, the nature
of the implant, its software, and health conditions generally make evidence about causation
relatively difficult to obtain with respect to these kind of torts; strict liability may be an effective
way to decrease the attendant error costs. Lastly the harm that can result (disease
mismanagement) is very great. The Hospital is the CCA of these types of harms, since the
updates happen invisibly and the patients do not have control over the code used.

We could counter by noting the high social value of IMDs and our software and that the risks are
adequately mitigated by the exercise of reasonable care.

CLASS ACTION

If plaintiffs seek class certification, we may not want to oppose, since it would allow us to
address all claims at once and provide "global peace."

They could seek to enjoin the Hospital from updating the software without notice in the future,
but they're more likely to seek damages as a 23(b)(3) class. They will meet the numerosity,
typicality and adequacy requirements. On commonality and predominance, they would argue
that the harms stem from the same injurious acts of the Hospital: negligently uploading a buggy
code without informing the patients that it was being done, and subsequently failing to alert them
to the error. Any significant differences among the patients (those who had neurostimulators vs.
those who had defibrillators; recipients IMDs from different manufacturers; the nature of their
conditions; whether or not their doctors knew about the error through word-of-mouth and called
them) can be adequately dealt with by subclasses. Any difference in the extent of their resulting
harms is a question not for the certification stage but rather for the damages stage.

We may respond by pointing out that the distinguishing characteristics noted above, in addition
to the highly individualistic nature of medical conditions, predominate over the common
questions and make certification inappropriate.
DAMAGES

The patients will pursue compensatory damages for increased medical costs and attendant
emotional harm. They may pursue damages for "lost chance." It's unclear whether there's the
requisite statistical data required to support a lost chance action. Lastly, the hospital may be
vulnerable to punitive damages. The "culpable state of mind" when it intentionally concealed the
error could vastly increase the punitive damage award.
Question 1, Sample Answer 2




Negligence
 The software update itself is unlikely to be negligent. The engineers approximated a BPL
analysis at the frontend and determined that an update was a proper precaution. Assuming that
they correctly weighed the risks and burdens, the hospital will likely have exercised reasonable
care.
 However, if the hospital was not negligent in its initial decision to update the software, it may
be negligent in its execution of the update. The burden of additional precaution is likely low;
additional checks to the software may have found it. However, it is unclear how many checks
and other precautions the engineers had already taken. If they took many, then we may argue that
there is a decreasing marginal gain in safety from each additional check or precaution. While the
burden of each check is low, the foreseeable risk that is avoided is increasingly low as well.
 The hospital may also be negligent for not informing patients and physicians, irrespective of
other liability these actions may entail. If the hospital had told either of its plans, then they could
have taken precautions. The burden of a such a warning for the hospital would be low. However,
given the engineers conclusion, after extensive study, that the chances of a health impact were
low, we may argue that the foreseeable risk and harm were also low. The question would be
determined by how accurate a court felt the engineers assessment of these odds were.
 Even if the hospital was not initially negligent for its failure, once the harm began to eventuate,
the hospital may be held negligent for further harm caused by failing to tell either patients or
physicians. The burden here too was low, and the foreseeable risk of further harm would have
become extremely high.


Strict liability
 It is possible that the hospital will be held strictly liable for software updates. Our unique IMD's
are likely not a common usage. Furthermore, they may entail a serious risk of harm which cannot
be eliminated by the utmost care by all parties is more difficult. To determine the level of risk, a
court would likely want a broad sampling of similar software updates to determine the likelihood
of such a harm occuring. Unfortunately, given the hospitals unique position, this may be
unavailable, so a court would need to rely on a more intuitive assessment of the risk.
 Ironically, attempts to argue that the risk of harm was unavoidable may run counter to our
negligence arguments. It will be difficult to argue that serious harm did not occur; some patients
are in intensive care possibly caused by the update.
 The question is whether we might have eliminated these risks by reasonable care, but our
arguments above try to show that they could not. To win both, we would need to convince a
court that this was 'freak' accident which was neither likely to happen nor could have been
avoided by greater care.


Trespass to chattels
 The hospital may also be held liable for trespass to chattels, based our intentional interference
with the patient's medical devices. In Hamidi the court held that such intentional electronic
"interference" was not trespass, so long as there was no harm. Unfortunately, there may have
been harm caused by the trespass here, and the court may find medical devices more "personal"
than servers.


Failure to warn
 Fourth, the hospital may have had an affirmative duty to warn patients of the potential harm,
even if we did not negligently create it. In Montgomery, the court held a truck driver liable for
failing to warn other drivers when the truck non-negligently broke down. Like there, while the
court may find that the hospital exercised reasonable care in updating the software, once the risk
of harm became apparent, the hospital may have had an affirmative duty to warn patients of the
dangers.


Informed consent
 Given the medical context, the plaintiffs may argue that they had a right to informed consent
before any updates were made to their devices. There are two difficulties with this claim; first, it
requires a court to draw an analogy between a medical procedure and a device update, and
second, informed consent generally only applies to doctors, not a hospital's engineers. It is
possible that a court may find this convincing, but we may have strong arguments based on the
dissimilarities.


Cause-in-fact
  We may be able to argue that the software update was not the "but for" cause of the patients
injuries. The software bug only stopped reporting of patient health-stautus; it did not cause the
devices themselves to malfunction. The hospital is only the 'but for cause' of injuries resulting
from the physician's lack of information about their client's status, not for the underlying medical
condition.
Proximate cause
  However, proximate cause is unlikely to be availing. The plaintiffs were all being treated with
our devices, and so are all likely foreseeable plaintiffs. The type of harm caused by the update is
itself likely foreseeable for most plaintiffs, since all so far are claiming medically related harms.
We may have an argument if any plaintiffs claim injuries which are of a wholly different type
from their underlying illness. Similary, unforeseeable manner will be unavailing unless the injury
occurs in a strange and extraordinary way unlinked to the underlying illness.
 Harm within the risk analysis is unlikely to help either. The reason negligence or strict liability
would be imposed is that an uninformed update could interere with the functioning of the device
and cause health hazards. That was the case here.


Harm
 The harm that the hospital is liable for is likely limited to injuries caused by the failure of
updates for physicians. This will be far more limited then liability for all plaintiff injuries during
the period, but may still be high. The three patients whose untreated heart arrhythmia led to their
being placed in intensive care may have a particularly large claim.
 Compensatory damages will be claimed for 'out of pocket' expenses caused, but also any pain
and suffering that the patients suffered due to their untreated conditions.
 Punitive damages may be imposed. We may have a strong argument that the hospital's behavior
was not particularly reprehensible, since we were attempting to protect our patients from
hacking. A jury may regard our failure to warn our patients and hospitals as extremely
problematic though, and wish to punish us to ensure that we and others inform patients in the
future.


Pre-emption
 We may be able to defeat the state tort claim by arguing that it is pre-empted by federal law.
The Medical Device Act expressly pre-empts state tort claims, so unless the state claims parallel
the federral requirements and do not deal with an explicitly federal issue, we may be protected so
long as we complied with federal guidelines. It is unclear, however, if the act applies for
potentially negligent updates, such as this, or simply for dangerously manufactured devices.


Class action
 It is possible that the plaintiffs will attempt a class action. While it does not appear that most of
the hospitals 1000 patients were harmed, the court is unlikely to set a high threshold on the
numerosity issue (see Parko). If the plaintiffs seek damages (which is very likely, though they
may want an injunction to stop the hospital from making unauthorized updates in the future) we
can attack certification based on commonality, adequacy, and predominance.
 It is unclear that there will be sufficient 'common answers,' to use the term in Walmart, to
justify certification. There are at least three different types of devices at work here, and the
nature of the alleged negligence means that the injuries suffered are likely to be very dependent
on the particular conditions of the patient. This makes it difficult to argue that there are enough
commonality to the plaintiffs injuries to ensure that the class issues predominate over others,
even though there is a single defendant as in Metcoil. This will particularly be the case if the
plaintiffs seek to make the class very wide.
  Some of the problems may be fixed by partitioning the patients into sub-classes, possibly based
on device type and the nature of injuries. The court may also have class proceedings on the
issues of negligence and strict liability and other sources of liability but adjudicate precise
injuries on an individual basis.
Question 1, Sample Answer 3



Negligence: Buggy Update

The patients could claim negligence in the decision to install the buggy update. There is no
evidence of statutory violations indicating negligence per se, nor is there any evidence of how
others in the industry would handle such a situation-indeed, Horizons is a leader in this new
medical technology. If there are other hospitals with similar innovations, however, we would
want to see evidence of how they handle similar situations as persuasive (but not dispositive)
indications of custom.

Setting aside custom and statute, there are two questions: whether remotely installing the update
was negligent, and whether Horizons' method of reviewing the update was negligent. There is a
strong argument against negligence in the decision to install. After thorough cost-benefit
analysis, Horizons concluded there was virtually no chance of health impacts from installing the
update (though the magnitude of loss, if realized, would be large). Moreover, the burden of not
installing the update meant elevated risk of hacking-potentially violating confidential data and
risking bodily harm from hijacked devices. The BPL calculus weighs against negligence in this
instance.

There are possible grounds for negligence in the process Horizons used to review the update for
potential bugs. We see after the fact that the untaken precaution was a week's investigation and
two weeks' coding-how long it took to identify and fix the bug-which must be weighed against
the risk of cybersecurity incidents in the interim. Given the time it likely took to develop the
update in the first place, a couple extra weeks to roll out a less buggy update seems like a
reasonable burden for the decreased risk of malfunctioning. We would argue that the burden
would have been far greater, and maybe Horizons was only able to fix the bug so quickly
because it knew what it was looking for-a defense we would certainly want to raise-and the
probability of a bug occurring was so low as to be utterly unforeseeable.

There appears to be no evidence of any comparative negligence on the part of potential plaintiffs.

Negligence: Failure to Warn

The patients have a stronger negligence claim for Horizons' failure to warn once it knew of the
bug. The decision to update without notifying patients may not have been negligence in itself,
but a party has an affirmative duty to warn of non-negligently created risks once it is aware, as in
the case of a car stalled out of sight over a hill. Horizons may thus not have had a duty to warn at
the time it released the update, assuming the bug was truly unforeseeable, but it probably did
once the bug was discovered. Instead of notifying, Horizons kept its customers and their doctors
in the dark for two additional weeks, a time during which doctors could have reverted to
traditional methods to check in on their patients-which some already began to do. Moreover, the
fact that Horizons actively concealed information-likely in the face of explicit inquiries from
worried doctors and despite clearly foreseeable harm-might even point to gross negligence. The
bad-intent standard for willful misconduct established in BP is less likely, but there is evidence
to suggest that Horizons tried to minimize knowledge of the bug in full knowledge of the risk of
doing so.

We should look at whether the Medical Devices Amendments preempt a state tort claim here-
assuming that Horizons IMDs are FDA-regulated. However, a court would probably find, as in
Stengel v. Medtronic, that the duties are parallel, and state law imposes only extra deterrence, not
a heightened standard of care. Horizons can also argue that warning patients would not have
made any difference: that doctors were already checking in by the time a warning would have
made any difference, and other doctors would not have changed their behavior in time. On
balance, though, the burden of warning is low, and the probability of loss from failing to do so-
cardiac events and other health impacts-is extremely high.

Policy weighs in favor of liability. It is a cheapest cost avoider in that it is aware of potential
failure-to-warn liability, has superior knowledge of the risk, and can decrease the risk by warning
doctors. Moreover, there is a strong deterrence argument: society should want makers of medical
devices to be proactive about informing doctors of the risks their devices pose.

Strict Liability

A strict liability claim is possible but unlikely. Although the Restatement factors weigh both
ways-Horizons can guard against the risk through the exercise of due care, but it is engaged in an
inherently risky business-there is a strong policy argument against imposing SL on innovative
medical device makers. SL creates incentives for Horizons to reduce its activity or even leave the
market-an outcome that benefits no one-and it probably already has the proper research
incentives to develop safer devices. Society has a strong interest in healthcare innovations, and
state tort law should reflect this interest.

Causation

Increased hospital check-ins suggest the bug was probably a cause-in-fact of some but not all of
the patients' health issues. These are sick people, and some would check into the hospital
regardless of their devices' conditions. We should learn about check-in statistics before the
update; elevated rates might not be statistically significant, which would suggest the bug was not
a but-for cause. Assuming the bug is a cause-in-fact, though, we can assume negligence was a
proximate cause of the harms. The patients are eminently foreseeable plaintiffs, and the type of
harm-devices malfunctioning, leading to manifestation of underlying health conditions-is
foreseeable as well. Whether Horizons was negligent in releasing the update or in failing to warn
would determine whether elevated check-ins during the first week are at issue.

The plaintiffs also have a strong but not unshakeable claim that but for Horizons' failure to warn,
the three strokes would not have occurred. Horizons should look for evidence on the incidence of
cardiac patients' strokes in the absence of bugs to question cause-in-fact, but for purposes of
assessing liability I'll assume causation. In this case, the harms most likely fall within the scope
of liability. As above, these are highly foreseeable plaintiffs. We could argue strokes are not a
foreseeable type of harm (Wagon Mound), but given Horizons' medical expertise and the known
risk of stroke, this argument seems weak. Moreover, possible predisposition to strokes would not
help us; the eggshell plaintiff rule means we must take our plaintiffs as they come.

Class Action

The patients might seek certification as a 23(b)(3) damages class, given that only a few have
suffered major harms like strokes that merit individual suits. They easily satisfy the 23(a)
numerosity requirement, and it sounds as though they have adequate representation as well.
However, we can argue that they do not meet the common question requirements of 23(a)(2):
they use difference devices for difference problems, and have suffered different injuries (and
many perhaps no injuries at all) (Wal-Mart). Thus, damages are likely to differ substantially.
However, patients can invoke Posner's "single source of injury" argument (Met-Coil) to sidestep
Wal-Mart's elevated commonality requirements. They can also argue that a certifying court
should dispatch the damages issue later by creating sub-classes after addressing common
questions (Sears). If certification is likely, we might encourage forming a 23(e) settlement class
in view of likely liability for negligent failure to warn. This would have the benefit of
preempting high litigation costs and possible punitive damages, and binding future plaintiffs to
assure global peace (assuming few opt out after receiving mandatory notice).

Damages

Assuming claims are not settled and plaintiffs prevail, a jury would award compensatory
pecuniary damages for out-of-pocket costs and other economic harm like lost wages, as well as
pain-and-suffering for injured patients. Moreover, it is possible that punitive damages would be
awarded if a jury finds that Horizons' failure to warn is grossly negligent or otherwise
reprehensible and wants to strongly deter future misconduct. Gore and State Farm limit punitive
damages on due process grounds to 9x compensatory unless conduct is utterly reprehensible
(unlikely in this case), but even so liability could be extremely high-another reason to settle.

Plaintiffs could also sue for lost chance of survival, but there are strong policy grounds to limit
this doctrine to pure medical malpractice given the difficulty of quantifying risks in medical
device malfunctions, particularly given the wide range of underlying conditions without the
accurate survival statistics of diseases like cancer for which lost chance is more routinely
imposed.
Question 2, Sample Answer 1


Tailor: Punitive Damages
  Recently, courts have been attempting to determine whether Punitive Damages (PD) should be
limited, how to limit them, and whether they should bear any relation to Compensatory Damages
(CD). Courts have gone with verbal instructions (BMW) and ratios with CD (State Farm, Exxon),
but have not come down decisively on how much PD is too much, how much is too little, and
how we are to set the right amount.
  While there are benefits to having a set and certain amount of PD ($X, for example) that are
either awarded or are not, the current approach of flexible PD has numerous benefits. For one,
cases vary vastly, and having $X be the PD for each and every case seems arbitrary. The worst
oil spill case probably deserves a lot more in PD than the worst intentional nuisance case. By
pegging PD to CD, PDs will have some flexibility, and be higher for higher-damage and higher-
impact cases. Further, leaving open verbal instructions allows juries to consider softer factors,
like reprehensibility (and therefore intent). In a sense, PD must vary as much as cases vary--as
each remedy must match its fact pattern (and the harm therein).
  Additionally, flexible PD amounts will deter defendants more if they are risk-averse (on the
flip-side, flexible PDs encourage defendants that are risk-seeking. These defendants might be
more deterred by a high $X). Flexible PD also give more bargaining power to plaintiffs at the
settlement-negotiating table. What flexible PD lack in notice, they make up for in fairness. While
letting both parties know exactly what they could face at trial is fair, plaintiffs usually have less
bargaining power than defendants, and when plaintiffs can hold the flexible PD axe over
defendants' heads, the balance of power might be more even. Finally, flexible PD amounts
promote fairness in that they give society a measure of representation in terms of deciding
punishment. Unlike $X (which is set in stone), flexible PDs are jury-set, and as members of
society, jurors represent society's values. By allowing jurors to decide PDs, society can decide
how much to punish and deter defendants' behaviors, thus acknowledging the harm done to
society as a whole and offering more of a sense of justice.
 While it makes sense that PD should be flexible, there are benefits to have PD be simply "all"
or "nothing"--one set PD amount, or none at all.
 Having a certain amount of PD ($X) for all cases has the benefit of clarity for everyone
involved. Plaintiffs know that, should they refuse settlement and proceed to trial, that they will
either get $X as PD or $0 as PD. Defendants know exactly how much their reprehensible actions
could case them to lose. $X is far more likely to deter a potential tortfeasor than "some amount,
decided by jury, depending on how reprehensible the jurors believe your actions are and possibly
pegged to CD which is also unknown." $X therefore serves to promote judicial efficiency, by
encouraging plaintiffs to settle early and not tempting them with potentially absurdly high
awards (like in the Pinto case). $X also promotes deterrence, by informing defendants exactly
what they're in for if they act in a way that deserves PD. In effect, the only question will be
whether PDs should be awarded or not--a much simpler calculation than it would be if
defendants also needed to estimate what the jury might award.
 $X is also fair to both defendants and plaintiffs. By providing notice, both plaintiffs and
defendants have much more information about what could happen at trial. $X will also have the
benefit of not violating Due Process, as defendants will have notice of $X. However, in terms of
fairness, the evening of bargaining power accomplished by flexible PD seems to outweigh the
fairness $X provides by way of notice.




Binary
 One of the most binary examples I've encountered is the comparison of Beck v. FMC Corp. and
Dunlop Tire v. FMC Corp. The juxtaposition illustrates the limit on compensatory damages;
specifically, pure economic harm is not compensated, whereas economic harm in conjunction
with physical harm is. The line is drawn to protect defendants from crushing liability.
  In many ways, the current binary line-drawing argument used by Courts to limit crushing
liability is the most practical and clear-cut way to do so. It informs potential plaintiffs of the lines
of liability, and discourages them from suing if they clearly fall beyond the line. It also makes
clear to defendants what they're liable for. The pure economic harm line also cuts off potential
defendants. For example, a factory explodes, taking out the nearby electric station (which
negligently failed to stay the regulation-mandated distance away from the factory), which causes
a blackout. Since the electric station is liable only for the blackout, which causes only pure
economic harm, the electric station has no liability. This simplifies the judicial process, since
plaintiffs should know not to sue the electric company because pure economic harm is not
compensable.
  However, there are benefits to more tailored alternatives--decreasing compensatory awards, for
example. Courts limit crushing liability in a number of ways, but those ways involve cutting
liability off abruptly after some line--whether it be a police-drawn line, the line of no-physical-
harm, or a monetary cap on damages. Why not, instead of providing a line, providing a
downward-sloping plane? Instead of compensating everyone up to the line fully, compensate
everyone, but marginally less as you get farther away from the accident.
  This is best illustrated, perhaps, by the fact-pattern of 532 Madison Ave. Instead of using the
line between pure economic harm and physical harm with economic harm, if there is a police-
drawn line, why not award compensatory damages to everyone, but marginally decrease the
damages as plaintiffs are located farther and farther beyond the line? Unfortunately, decreasing
compensation is less clear in cases of pure economic harm without police lines, like in Beck and
Dunlop. The line there is between physical damage (even just a rock hitting the wall and causing
a dent might work) and no physical damage. However, instead of that line, why not compensate
fully for physical damage, and only 50% for economic harm? Or, if there are many, many other
potential plaintiffs (as in Strauss) and crushing liability is indeed a problem, why not 1%?
 While incomplete monetary compensation is not ideal (and something in tort liability might
revolt at acknowledging full fault without full compensation), this approach acknowledges the
need to limit defendants' liability. However, it also vindicates plaintiffs' dignitary interest, by
acknowledging the wrong done to them.
 Unfortunately, the decreasing compensatory damages model falls to essentially the same
criticism as line-drawing. Marginally decreasing damages in cases like 532 Madison Ave. still
require cutting off liability somewhere--it just might end up being farther away. Decreased
compensatory damages in cases like Strauss don't limit liability enough, as the number of
plaintiffs could be endless. Further, is it really fairer to acknowledge full fault and then let the
defendant get away with paying incomplete compensation? Probably not; fairness might require
us to simply draw a line and say, you're not at fault for certain things--like pure economic harm.
Question 2, Sample Answer 2




Tailoring Approach: eBay Injunction Test
The courts in Boomer and eBay both rejected a bright-line rule for awarding an injunction
automatically based on findings of nuisance and patent infringement respectively. eBay
implored the lower courts to use a four-part test in order to decide between damages and an
injunction; and indeed four justices concurred with Justice Kennedy, who seemed to prefer
damages in the eBay case over the traditional injunction.


Why it Works:
There is a strong argument that such a test works better with changing times and changing
technology. Take, for example, the recent case brought by the Author's Guild against Google
Books. An automatic injunction against Google upon a finding of copyright infringement could
have detrimental effects. Despite the Coasean ideal that parties will contract around the law and
find a way to the most efficient solution no matter what the court decides, this becomes
exponentially more difficult when there are multiple parties involved and when there is a large
disparity in bargaining power. Knowing Google's resources and power, individual authors could
hold out for huge penalties that could cause negotiations to fall apart and allow the injunction to
stand. The public interest factor, which the Court of Appeals in eBay cites as a factor that can
usually be ignored in granting an automatic injunction, is significant here. Google Books'
compilation would make books much more widely available to the public, and thus constitutes a
significant societal interest. Damages, on the other hand (or an injuction with a condition that
you can pay to lift the injunction), will allow the Coase Theorem to work better in this case.
Google is Calabresi's "best bargainer," and by putting the decision on Google, the court can
ensure that the most efficient solution is reached - Google continues with its project, and the
author's are fairly compensated for their loss.


Why it Doesn't Work:
The problem with a more flexible approach and appeal to efficiency is that it undermines tort law
aims of fairness and corrective justice. Traditionally, we think that if you interfere with
someone's property (nuisance) or use it as your own (infringement), you should have to stop
doing so. In the Google Books example, awarding damages in the interest of efficiency or to
promote bargaining monetizes an author's claim to his work and likely ignores intangible harm
often taken into consideration in other areas of tort law concerning property. For example, under
the modern conception of trespass, we consider things like harm to dignity (Martin v. Reynolds).
It is possible that authors in this case would be able to recover for "pain and suffering" along
with compensatory damages, but Google would still be paying to continue perpetrating the same
harm. Especially in the copyright and patent industries, such a practice could chill creativity and
innovation. Further, for companies with seemingly unlimited resources like Google, it could
throw off the effect of optimal deterrence. If large companies know an injunction will often be
impracticeable due to these bargaining issues, they may feel free to infringe as they please,
knowing they can pay for it. One solution to this would be to look at it from a complete
deterrence perspective, and impose "extra" damages to take away profits. This, however, leads
back to some of the same problems that come with granting an automatic injunction, namely that
it is in the public's interest for the company to stay afloat and not be bankrupted by astronomical
damages.


No Tailoring: Market Share Liability
As employed by the court in Sindell, relative market share liability calls for defendants to
compensate the plaintif for 100% of the loss despite the fact that defendants may be absent,
whose share of the market the present defendants must make up for by paying more. As used in
Eli Lilly, absolute market share calls for defendants to compensate the plaintiff for only their
exact share of the market, even if that results in an incomplete recovery for the plaintiff. Both
approaches have a short-coming (i.e. over assigning liability or under-compensating the
plaintiff), and neither makes an effort to tailor by actual harm caused to the plaintiff.


Why it Works: Market share liability was created to overcome the proof problem that arises
when a plaintiff cannot prove which specific defendant harmed her. Therefore, it is no surprise
that it is not tailored according to harm caused, but rather calculated purely based on market
share. Since market share liability is used largely in DES cases, relative market share liability is
an attractive option because it fully compensates plaintiffs who are rarely, if ever, responsible for
any portion of the harm. Some sense of corrective justice is already lost in the fact that the
plaintiff is not necessarily being compensated by the manufacturer responsible for her individual
harm. Therefore, regardless of their lack of control over absent defendants' situations, it feels
most fair to have the defendants bear the risk of other defendants' insolvency, having gone out of
business, being unfindable, etc. Absolute market share is an attempt to combat the problem of
over-assigning liability to present defendants. Perhaps absolute market share is a way to give
drug companies more accurate incentives, without requiring them to take into account the
behavior and status of other companies.


Why it Doesn't Work: With no tailoring based on harm caused, market share liability comes
close to punishing for risk creation, a concept that is generally avoided in tort law for deterrence
and incentive reasons. One way to tailor this concept to harm, with the problem of individual
proof as it stands, could be as follows: use the absolute market share concept and incorporate
punitive damages to make the plaintiff's recovery complete. Take, for example, a group of
asbestos manufacturers whose products have caused mesothelioma. The plaintiff cannot prove
which manufacturer caused his harm, so each manufacturer that can be haled into court pays his
exact share (absolute market share). However, some manufacturers have gone out of business
and are not joined as defendants. Instead of having each manufacturer who is present make up
the difference in fixed amounts as in relative market share, or instead of having the plaintiff not
recover the full amount as in absolute market share, you could instruct a jury to consider the
reprehensibility of the defendants and distribute a fixed "pool" of punitive damages according to
their decision. One obvious issue with this system is the difficulty in separating reprehensibility
from harm caused to others, as evidenced by the confusion in the wake of Philip Morris.
Therefore, juries might just decide on reprehensibilty based on market share, which would lead
us back to relative market share. However, especially in the case of asbestos manufacturers, there
may be ways around this. For example, certain defendants may have taken better precautions
than others after finding out the harmful effects of their products. If such a distinction were
possible, this would help tailor the system to harm and bring it more within the bounds of
traditional tort law, to promote corrective justice, and to avoid moral luck (i.e. a defendant who
intentionally caused asbestos poisoning but whose products only reached a small group of
people).
Question 2, Sample Answer 3


One example taking the former, or a standard-like/tailoring approach, is custom. Another
example taking the latter, rule-like/binary approach, is malpractice.

Custom

Tort law views custom as admissible, perhaps even persausive, evidence of reasonable care- but
not dispositive. This approach makes sense because it fairly respects the past while enabling the
future. However, it also creates uncertainty and harms development.

This approach makes sense because it respects and secures the benefits of tradition.

First, this approach is grounded in experience. As such, practices that are customs may be
indicative of cost-benefit determinations. Furthermore, as an authority, custom may be indicative
of best practices and sets a standard. By setting a standard, custom and tradition facilitate the
smooth functioning of society, as it signals to actors expectations of care from others and
corresponding levels of self-care.

However, this may not always be true. Sometimes actors--especially in industry--seek to cut
corners to save money. As a result, widespread practice might not reflect best practices. Thus,
custom would be faciliating a sub-optimal state of affairs and may even be endangering society.

By permitting discretion, the current law allows courts/juries to evaluate customs on their merits.
This way, courts can reinforce practices that are truly reasonable and deter poor practices. By
prohibiting poor actors--those whose standard of care falls short--from resting on custom, this
approach also ensures that the law is fair and facilitates justice for wronged parties.

Second, this approach is progressive. By allowing the courts flexibility with custom, courts are
able to tailor the standard of care to the times. Most critically, this approach allows the court to
call out an entire industry's subpar standards and stagnation. (TJ Hooper) By prohibiting
universal disregard as an excuse, the court highlights the moral agency of each actor in the
industry and stimulates the search for and adoption of best practices. It is also, in this sense, a
mechanism for the popular redress of greivance against institutionalized norms. This avenue for
progress and communal participation in setting society's standards would not be available if the
law was not so flexible.

However, in not being more concrete, this approach risks unfairly hurting the first-sued. Actors
reasonably relying on traditional norms may not expect to be held liable for conforming to what
appears to be the standard. When they are, the others may or may not heed the warning, but at his
expense. These first-sued actors may even be bankrupted--if the suit is large enough.

This uncertainty also harms development by adding other costs. Some actors may seek to tackle
the risk of liability by constantly innovating. However, this is costly and may bar newer entrants
from succeeding. Thus the rule may end up hurting innovation and competition in the long-run.
This approach, then, reflects the reality that custom cuts both ways. In formulating a standard
rather than a rule, courts look past compliance and non-compliance to judge the issues on their
merits. It is not conformity that is dispositive, but sub-conformity and due care. The approach
encourages a holistic and fair appraisal of custom. It highlights the blameworthiness of the party,
it deters poor practices, and it incentivizes due care and innovation. However, in leaving some
uncertainty, it may unfairly single out one of many offenders and discourage development.

Perhaps the rule should be more dispositive in suits of first instance. Specifically, first-sued
actors should be allowed to claim custom as a defense and PLs granted only nominal damages to
acknowledge the wrong done in these suits. Thereafter, any other defendants could not defend by
the discredited custom. This would secure the benefits of the tailoring approach without unfairly
harming "unlucky" defendants adhering to industry standards. Yet, this suggestion then leaves
the plaintiffs of first instance without compensatory damages and effecitvely strictly liable for
their own injuries. Ultimately we must decide if the benefits to society (i.e. development) are
worth the costs to victims.

Malpractice

Professionals are governed by a custom which is dispositive in malpractice suits. That is,
compliance with custom or the professional standard of care is an absolute defense, while
violation of this custom constitutes negligence.

This approach makes sense since it recognizes the expertise of the professions and the
institutional incompetence of the courts/juries. The professions are granted privileges and
licensed in our society reasonably; they require certain expert knowledge that is not available to
those not so trained. Thus, courts grant professional custom deference in determining matters of
professional negligence. This insulates such decisions from the unqualified evaluations of non-
expert juries and judges, whose decision could at best be made with sincere extrapolation and at
worst with bias or emotions. This deference reduces risk since professionals will not have to
worry how their justified actions will look to a jury.This approach, then, secures professional
standards and in turn the safety and quality of care provided to the public.

This approach also encourages cost-savings and judicial efficiency. By ensuring that suits will be
subject to professional custom, frivolous suits are discouraged. This is no small matter as
professionals may be particularly targeted otherwise as a more affluent group with "elite" status
that may be alienating to jurors. Further, using a binary rule saves time by clairfying the law.
While expert witness add costs per case, the total case-load costs may be a net positive.

This approach fails, however, by effectively discouraging innovation and stifling progress. If
professionals can always fall back on custom, they have less incentive to seek new and better
ways of providing services. Indeed, professionals may actively avoid departing from custom for
fear of liability. As a result, this binary rule does not allow for much creativity and leads to the
binary practice of our professions. Current trends in the medical professions--where electronic
health records may soon make the standard of care even clearer and more rigid--may eventually
lead to greater automation and stagnation among professionals. This may seems to run counter to
the essense of professionalism-- excellence!
Furthermore, lay people have greater access to knowledge today with the advent of the internet.
Indeed, website like WebMd and online lay legal handbooks make professional knowledge more
accessible then ever. Thus, maybe this standard is not as relevant anymore. Perhaps instead,
professional expert evidence should be treated like other customs: admissible, though still
slightly more persuasive, evidence. Indeed, such an approach would reflect the change in the
competence of lay jurors and also give more flexibility for professionals to provide personalized
services.

The approach could be slightly more tailored without sacrificing the professional standards
secured by the rule. For example, flexibility could be given to professionals who take concious
and reasonable deviations from protocol with the client's consent in order to seek better
treatment. What is reasonable may differ, but it is a category a jury may be able to decide by
looking at factors like track record of success, reliance on scientific/professional journals, and
evaluating the size of the deviation. By ensuring that the deviation is both concious and
consented to, we can decrease the risk of blatant negligence. Yet, by providing an avenue for
such tailor-made decisions we secure more personalized professional services and unleash the
innovative potential of the "line workers."
