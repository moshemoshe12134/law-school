                                         Instructions

       This is a 4-hour in-class exam.

        You may use any course materials we assigned or distributed, plus any outlines or
notes that you or your classmates have prepared. You may not do outside research. You
may not consult with anyone during the exam. If a question seems unclear or if a key
fact seems to be missing, then please state your best reading of the question or your
sensible assumption about the key fact, and continue with your answer.

       The exam is designed to take 3 hours, thus allowing you extra time to organize,
review, rethink, and edit. Planning your answers before you start writing is likely to be a
very good use of time.

       Space is very limited and you will need to be concise. Please write in complete
sentences. You will be rewarded for clear organization, brevity, precise thinking, and
good writing. Using headings and signposts may help. Cite cases or other sources when
it makes your answer clearer. Do not use footnotes.

       Please supply a word count for each question. Include headings and signposts in
the count. You must stay within the limits: 1200 words for Question 1, 900 words for
Question 2, and 900 words for Question 3.

       You should answer all questions. Each question will be worth 1/3 of the grade.
Please do budget your time carefully.

        Remember that your aim is to demonstrate how thoughtful and nuanced you can
be in using what we covered in class, along with any “facts” given by the exam, to craft
your arguments—and counter-arguments.

       I wish you the best of luck!

                                        Question I

                                     Limit: 1200 words

        The website Prospero.com, run by the Ariel family, is hosted from a set of servers
located inside their home at the edge of a mountain resort town. The website is a small
financial news service that runs all day and night, reporting real-time, original analysis of
news from various stock exchanges around the world. The Ariels chose to locate their
servers in this resort town after the electric company, Rocky Mountains Edison, began to
provide more consistent service in the area. As it happens, the home they bought is
located next to the main route for the power transmission lines bringing electricity into
the town proper. Those power lines run along the property divide between the Ariels and
their neighbors, the Rosalind family.

        On that neighboring property, the Rosalinds raise domesticated yaks. From the
yak hair, they produce yarn which in turn they weave into gloves and hats—among the
most popular souvenir items sold in the resort town. The family has raised yaks on this
land for generations, since well before the area became a popular resort (and in fact,
before electricity came to the town). Because the yaks are not aggressive, and because
the families have become close friends, the Ariels have never sought to raise a fence
between their properties.

        The Ariels’ online financial news business has not run entirely smoothly,
however. On two occasions, their website has gone down—causing frustration among
their paying customers and causing them to lose business (so the Ariels believe). On the
first occasion, one of the power lines broke from its tower and landed on the Rosalinds’
property. Upon contact with the ground, the end of the wire generated “stray voltage.”
Stray voltage on the ground can cause unexpected electric currents to flow through land,
water, people, or other conductive objects. (Similar accidents are known to have caused
the failures of electrical equipment in hospitals and other facilities, and to have shocked
or electrocuted people and animals.) The stray voltage from this fallen wire caused a
surge in the Ariel home’s electrical system, which in turn caused one of their servers to
explode. Luckily, nobody was hurt. But the Prospero.com website was down for over a
week as a result. Town inspectors later found that the power line had been improperly
attached to the tower, and that the electric company had also failed to inspect that
connection for four years—although the industry standard was to inspect annually.

        The website went down a second time, due to one of the yaks gnawing on the
Ariels’ satellite dish. This is highly unusual behavior for a yak. Conferring with their
neighbors, the Ariels learned that the Rosalind family had actually been quite concerned
for some time about increasingly odd behaviors among some yaks in their herd. Further
research revealed that similar odd behaviors are common in cattle on ranches with a
“stray voltage” problem. It turns out that even properly functioning power transmission
towers may at times “leak” low levels of stray voltage that can affect animal behavior.

Electricians hired by the two families confirmed that there were regular fluctuations of
such low-level stray voltage on both properties. After the families complained, the
electric company sent them documents showing that all its equipment was well-
maintained (and moreover, has been regularly checked by the town’s inspectors ever
since the first incident); the company denied any further obligation.

        At this point, the Ariels decided it was time to make the electric company pay for
the losses they suffered from the two website failures, and also to try to prevent any
further risk of damage. They sent a letter to Rocky Mountains Edison, explaining the
facts above and threatening to sue.

                                            ***

        You are an attorney at a firm that represents the electric company, Rocky
Mountains Edison. The top litigation partner emails you a copy of the letter from the
Ariel family. She then stops by your office, saying: “Please write me a short memo
analyzing the types of tort liability that our client might face (plus any good lines of
defense) and the remedies that the Ariel family might obtain. No need to do any research
yet. Just sketch out the arguments for and against each type of liability and each type of
remedy that you raise. Give more attention to the stronger possibilities. And be sure to
address both incidents. If there are any crucial facts we should be sure to find out while
preparing our defense, please do say so.”

        She adds: “There have not yet been any tort cases in this state about either stray
voltage, or yaks, or website failures. So you should not be shy in suggesting arguments
about how the state’s tort law should treat the present situations, given that the courts will
likely be dealing with issues of first impression here.”

         Prepare this short memo. If you need to make any assumptions about the
facts or about state law, please do so and state them clearly. (You may assume what
you wish about where your state stands, on any issues of tort law on which the states
differ.)

                                        Question II

                                     Limit: 900 words

         You are a law clerk for a justice of your state’s Supreme Court. A case involving
liability based on “lost chance” is now pending before the Court. Its brief history is as
follows: The claims of three plaintiffs against the same hospital were consolidated by the
trial court. (For privacy’s sake, the plaintiffs are known as Patients A, B, and C.)
Negligence was admitted by the defendant, as to all plaintiffs, for failure to prescribe a
drug that can sometimes prevent the recurrence of cancer. The cancer did recur for
Patients A and C. Patient A died from the cancer. Patient B’s cancer has not recurred.

        After hearing ample expert testimony, and after receiving a “lost chance” jury
instruction and special verdict form, the jury found that the hospital’s negligence caused
these outcomes for the plaintiffs: Patient A’s chances of avoiding the recurrence of
cancer fell from 90% to 60%. Patient B’s chances fell from 60% to 30%. Patient C’s
chances fell from 30% to 0%. (For each, the jury also returned an estimated damages
amount for the underlying harm of cancer recurrence; these estimates are not in dispute.)

        The judge then awarded damages to all three plaintiffs, in each case based on a
30% loss of chance of avoiding the recurrence of cancer. The appeals court affirmed.
The state’s Supreme Court granted certiorari on the question of whether the lost chance
doctrine should be adopted in this state, and if so, whether it was properly applied in the
case of these plaintiffs.

        The justice asks for your advice. She has compiled a list of excerpts from various
sources, including cases in other states. As she hands you the list, she says, “At first
glance, it seems these statements all counsel against adopting the lost chance doctrine in
any form. But I’d like your help in thinking through them more carefully. No research is
needed yet—just your clear-eyed analysis.”

       She specifies your task: “Please take each of these statements in turn, and tell me:
Does the statement pose a persuasive criticism of the lost chance doctrine—either in
general, or in its application to any of these plaintiffs, specifically?”

       Excerpt 1.

       The loss-of-chance theory of recovery is fundamentally at odds with the settled
       common-law standard… for establishing a causal link between the plaintiff’s
       injury and the defendant’s tortious conduct. Where the plaintiff must prove that
       as a result of the defendant’s conduct the injuries “would not otherwise have been
       incurred,” an act or omission of the defendant cannot be considered a cause of
       the plaintiff’s injury if the injury would probably have occurred without it.…
       Thus, although some of the arguments in favor of the loss-of-chance doctrine are

                                                                               Torts L6118-3
                                                                       Prof. Huang, Fall 2013



      appealing, we are mindful that it represents a significant departure from the
      traditional meaning of causation in tort law.

      Excerpt 2.

      The loss-of-chance doctrine permits an injured plaintiff to recover for the loss of
      a less than 50-percent chance of recovery or survival resulting from medical
      malpractice. As such, the loss-of-chance doctrine provides an exception to the
      traditionally strict standard requiring proof of causation by more than a 50-
      percent probability (that is, by a preponderance of the evidence).

      Excerpt 3.

      We should not award damages if there is no injury, of course. Yet the logical
      extension of the loss-of-chance damages theory is arguably to allow damages
      even when the patient miraculously recovers. In essence, this theory creates
      liability based merely on increased risks (what is a lost chance at survival, after
      all, but an increased risk of death?), rather than on realized harm.

       Prepare a short memo for the justice. If you need to make any assumptions
about the facts or about state law, please do so and state them clearly.

                                      Question III

                                    Limit: 900 words

       You are a staff attorney at the American Law Institute. In addition to drafting the
Restatements, the ALI also develops ideas for law reform. One day the director, having
been impressed by the depth of your thinking about tort law, comes to you with a specific
request. He says: “I think one of the triumphs in the evolution of tort law over the past
half-century has been the rise of comparative negligence and its displacement of
contributory negligence. This shift corrected a troubling asymmetry in the law—one that
many people believed favored defendants over plaintiffs in an irrational or unfair way.”

       He continues: “We should brainstorm about other such asymmetries in the law
that may need to be reexamined or fixed. So please do this for me: Think of two existing
doctrines, rules, or approaches—in the law of torts or torts remedies—that seem to be
lopsided in favor of either the plaintiff or the defendant. (If many come to mind, please
choose two that you think are less obvious, more subtle, or more interesting to analyze.)”

        He then specifies: “For each of your two choices, please suggest an alternative
doctrine, rule, or approach. (Your alternative may be novel, or it may already be in use in
some contexts. It may be one that levels the asymmetry, or one that creates the opposite
bias. Any of these would be fine.) Then, please briefly point out any good arguments
both in favor of the current asymmetry, and in favor of your alternative. No research
needed for now. Just be imaginative!”

        Prepare this short memo. Remember to address two topics within the law of
torts or torts remedies (though you do not need to give equal space to each).
