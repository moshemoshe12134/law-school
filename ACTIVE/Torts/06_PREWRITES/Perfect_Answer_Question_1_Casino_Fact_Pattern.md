## MEMORANDUM TO FELLOW JUDGES

This case requires analysis of Lucky Day Casino's (LDC) potential tort liability for the death of Leroy Hale, a blind candy stand operator. The key issues involve negligence claims regarding ceiling maintenance, debris management, and medical equipment availability, along with questions of contributory negligence, causation, and policy considerations.

### I. NEGLIGENCE CLAIMS AGAINST LUCKY DAY CASINO

#### A. Failure to Inspect and Maintain the Ceiling (1996-2015)

**Plaintiffs' Arguments:** LDC breached its duty of reasonable care by failing to inspect the plaster ceiling for 19 years. Under the Hand formula, the burden of periodic inspections was low—as demonstrated by Nies' post-accident inspection using merely a flashlight and removal of drop ceiling tiles. The probability of harm was high given the building's age (47 years old) and LePore's testimony suggesting gradual aging caused the collapse. The magnitude of potential harm—serious injury or death from falling debris—was substantial. Regular inspections would likely have revealed the deteriorating plaster, allowing LDC to prevent the collapse.

**Defendant's Arguments:** LDC exercised reasonable care by hiring LePore for repairs in both 1991 and 1996, with LePore finding no signs of damage on either occasion. The 28-year period before 1996 showed no ceiling problems, giving LDC no reason to foresee harm. Installing the drop ceiling in 1996 significantly increased the burden and cost of inspecting the original plaster ceiling above it. Nies' testimony that no other areas showed damage suggests the collapse was an unforeseeable isolated event, not systematic deterioration that inspections would have detected.

**Analysis:** Plaintiffs have the stronger argument. LePore's testimony that age caused the collapse indicates gradual deterioration that regular inspections could have detected over 19 years. While Nies found other areas intact, this doesn't prove the collapsed section showed no warning signs. LDC's choice to install a drop ceiling shouldn't exempt it from maintaining the original ceiling. The burden of occasional inspections is relatively low compared to the serious risk of ceiling collapse in a public space.

#### B. Failure to Remove or Adequately Secure Debris

**Plaintiffs' Arguments:** LDC breached its duty by leaving jagged debris on the floor for four hours during business hours. The burden of removing debris or providing adequate warnings was extremely low—a maintenance team could have cleared it quickly, or LDC could have verbally warned Hale. LDC knew Hale was blind, worked nearby, and regularly walked this corridor without his cane. The probability of Hale encountering and tripping over the debris was highly foreseeable. The magnitude of harm—serious injury from jagged debris—was substantial. A makeshift chain was grossly inadequate to warn a blind person.

**Defendant's Arguments:** The chain adequately warned sighted individuals. The burden of immediate removal was high because LDC needed to photograph the site for insurance claims and potential lawsuits. The area had little traffic. The probability of harm was low given that most people would see and avoid the cordoned area. Expecting businesses to provide special accommodations for every potential scenario involving disabled individuals is unreasonably burdensome.

**Analysis:** Plaintiffs' arguments are substantially stronger. LDC created the risk by maintaining the debris during business hours and had actual knowledge of Hale's blindness and proximity. The burden of warning Hale specifically was negligible—a brief verbal warning or temporarily stationing an employee. While photographing for insurance was important, it didn't require four hours, and the burden of accelerating this process is minimal compared to the foreseeable risk of serious injury to Hale. LDC's own decision to preserve evidence shouldn't trump basic safety obligations, especially when it knew of Hale's particular vulnerability.

#### C. Failure to Provide Intubation Kit

**Plaintiffs' Arguments:** LDC was negligent in not maintaining intubation equipment. The custom in large hotels of having intubation kits and trained personnel suggests this is a reasonable precaution in the hospitality industry. The burden of maintaining such equipment is relatively low. The potential benefit—possibly saving a life—is significant, even if Dr. Goul testified the chance was "small."

**Defendant's Arguments:** There's no evidence of custom among mid-size independent casinos specifically. The burden is substantial because it requires not just equipment but trained medical personnel on staff at all times. Without qualified personnel, having the equipment could create liability if untrained staff misuse it. Custom in large hotels is distinguishable—hotels have guests overnight and greater financial resources. Dr. Goul's presence was coincidental. Industry custom isn't dispositive of negligence.

**Analysis:** Defendants have the better argument. Without evidence of custom in the casino industry specifically, and given the need for trained personnel (not just equipment), this burden is substantial. The "small" chance of survival, combined with the requirement for a qualified medical professional to be present, makes this an unreasonable precaution to require of mid-size casinos.

### II. HALE'S CONTRIBUTORY/COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE

**Defendant's Arguments:** Hale was negligent in walking without his cane. The burden of using his cane was minimal—it was immediately available at his stand. The probability of encountering unexpected obstacles in a public space always exists. A reasonable blind person would have used the cane. Hale was the cheapest cost-avoider of this accident.

**Plaintiffs' Arguments:** The relevant standard is a reasonable blind person under the circumstances. Given Hale's familiarity with the short, frequently-traveled route, the early hour, the low-traffic area, and his precautions (measured pace, extended arm), his conduct was reasonable. He could reasonably rely on LDC, which knew of his blindness and habits over three years, to warn him of hazardous obstacles.

**Analysis:** Both arguments have merit. While Hale could have eliminated the risk by using his cane, his reliance on familiarity and his precautionary measures were reasonable under the circumstances. Assuming this state applies pure or modified comparative negligence, Hale's fault appears less than 50% of total fault, allowing recovery with proportional reduction.

### III. CAUSATION

#### Cause-in-Fact

The debris claim clearly satisfies but-for causation—but for the debris on the floor, Hale would not have tripped and died. The ceiling maintenance claim also satisfies but-for causation—but for the failure to inspect and maintain, the ceiling would not have collapsed. The intubation kit claim likely fails but-for causation given the "small" chance of survival. The lost-chance doctrine should not apply outside medical malpractice contexts where reliable statistical data exists.

#### Proximate Cause/Scope of Liability

**Ceiling Maintenance:** Defendant may argue Hale's death falls outside the scope of liability because the foreseeable harm from failing to maintain ceilings is people being struck by falling debris, not tripping over debris afterward. However, this argument is too narrow. Falling ceiling debris creates foreseeable hazards on the floor, including tripping risks, especially in areas where people walk.

**Debris Management:** Hale's death clearly falls within the scope of liability. The risk that made leaving jagged debris negligent—people tripping and suffering serious injury—is precisely what occurred. Critically, LDC knew Hale was blind and worked nearby, making harm to him specifically foreseeable. The fact that a chain would adequately protect sighted individuals doesn't defeat foreseeability when the defendant had actual knowledge of this particular plaintiff's vulnerability.

### IV. DUTY TO RESCUE AND THIRD PARTIES

Dr. Goul and David Turner had no initial duty to rescue but assumed a duty by undertaking rescue efforts. Good Samaritan statutes likely shield them from liability absent gross negligence. Swanson, as LDC's employee, acted pursuant to company policy and wouldn't be individually liable. LDC could have impleaded LePore for his 1991 or 1996 work, but superseding cause defenses and the 20-year gap would likely absolve him.

### V. POLICY CONSIDERATIONS

The court should consider that LDC charged Hale only $1/year as a gesture supporting persons with disabilities. Imposing stringent liability might deter businesses from offering such charitable arrangements. However, this policy concern shouldn't override basic safety obligations. A middle ground approach—reducing damages proportionate to Hale's comparative negligence while maintaining liability for clear safety violations—balances encouraging charitable acts with maintaining adequate safety standards.

### CONCLUSION

The trial court's verdict should be affirmed based on LDC's negligence in failing to adequately manage the debris and warn Hale, which was both a but-for cause and proximate cause of his death. The ceiling maintenance claim also has merit. Damages should be reduced proportionately if Hale is found comparatively negligent. The intubation kit claim should fail.
