## How Prewrites Work

**Before exam:**
1. Identify frequently tested topics (from past exams)
2. Create doctrinal prewrites for major torts
3. Create policy prewrites for major themes

**During exam:**
1. Issue-spot → Identify relevant prewrites
2. Copy-paste relevant sections
3. Customize to facts
4. Save time on rule statements and frameworks

**After exam:**
1. Note which prewrites were useful
2. Update based on what was actually tested
3. Refine for next iteration

---

## Building Prewrites

**Source material:**
- Outline sections (black letter law)
- Review documents (professor signals)
- Past exams (what gets tested)
- Case briefs (holdings and reasoning)

**Process:**
1. Start with template from `law-school-common/03_TEMPLATES/`
2. Fill in rule statement from outline
3. Create application framework
4. Test on 2-3 hypotheticals
5. Refine based on practice

## Tracking

**In MASTER_LOG.md:**

- `Policy?` column - ✅ if policy prewrite exists for topic

**Update as prewrites are created:**
- Mark column as ✅ when prewrite complete
- Note which topics have prewrites
