## MEMORANDUM TO THE JUSTICE

You seek counsel on whether, in cases of multiple sufficient causes, each tortfeasor should be individually liable for the full amount of harm to the plaintiff. While there are arguments on both sides, I recommend against adopting this reform because it would undermine core aims of tort law—corrective justice, optimal deterrence, and proper compensation—while creating perverse incentives.

### I. CORRECTIVE JUSTICE AND COMPENSATION

**Against the Reform:** Tort law's primary aim is corrective justice—restoring the plaintiff to their pre-injury position and providing fair compensation. The proposed rule would overcompensate plaintiffs by allowing recovery multiple times for the same harm, transforming tort law from corrective to punitive. This creates a windfall for plaintiffs beyond what's necessary to make them whole. When the plaintiff has suffered a discrete harm valued at $X, recovering $2X or $3X doesn't serve corrective justice—it creates unjust enrichment.

**For the Reform:** Under the current system, defendants receive a "lucky break" when their tortious conduct happens to be one of several sufficient causes, paying only pro rata shares despite each being fully responsible for causing the entire harm. From a corrective justice perspective, if a plaintiff psychologically holds each tortfeasor fully accountable for the harm (rather than adjusting blame proportionally), then full recovery from each may be necessary to restore the moral balance between plaintiff and each wrongdoer.

**Analysis:** The argument against reform is stronger. Corrective justice focuses on the plaintiff's actual loss, not the number of wrongdoers. Allowing multiple full recoveries transforms tort law into a punitive system focused on penalizing defendants rather than compensating plaintiffs. This philosophical shift would fundamentally alter tort law's character.

### II. DETERRENCE AND OPTIMAL INCENTIVES

**For the Reform:** The most compelling argument for reform is optimal deterrence. Under the current system, potential tortfeasors may discount the expected cost of their conduct by the number of other possible tortfeasors, creating a "strength in numbers" problem. This lowers "L" in the Hand formula, reducing the burden "B" that tortfeasors are willing to bear to prevent harm. The reform forces each tortfeasor to fully internalize the costs of their negligence without benefiting from others' wrongdoing. This prevents tortfeasors from free-riding on each other's liability and provides proper incentives for precaution-taking.

**Against the Reform:** The reform would create overdeterrence, causing society to be excessively cautious. Tort law recognizes through the Hand formula that some risky activities are socially valuable when B<PL. Holding defendants liable beyond their proportional fault distorts the information signals that tort liability sends about the social costs of their conduct. A defendant learning they must pay full damages despite being only partially responsible cannot accurately calibrate future precautions. The reform would deter beneficial activities that carry reasonable risks.

Additionally, joint and several liability already addresses deterrence concerns. Each defendant faces potential liability for the entire harm if co-defendants cannot pay, eliminating the free-rider problem in most cases. Defendants cannot reliably count on co-defendants' solvency when deciding whether to engage in risky conduct.

**Analysis:** Both arguments have merit, but the overdeterrence concern is decisive. While the "strength in numbers" problem is real, joint and several liability substantially addresses it without requiring the dramatic step of allowing multiple full recoveries. The reform would also create perverse incentives for plaintiffs to be less careful with their property, knowing that multiple tortfeasors increase recovery potential beyond actual losses.

### III. INTERACTION WITH COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE

**For the Reform:** The system should function the same as with a single tortfeasor. If the plaintiff was 45% responsible, each tortfeasor remains liable for their 55% share. This maintains deterrence for defendants while properly accounting for plaintiff negligence.

**Against the Reform:** This creates an especially troubling inequity—a partially negligent plaintiff recovering more than 100% of total damages. If plaintiff bears some responsibility for the harm, why should multiple tortfeasors enable the plaintiff to profit from their own negligence? This perversely incentivizes plaintiff negligence when multiple potential tortfeasors exist.

### IV. PRACTICAL AND EQUITY CONSIDERATIONS

**For the Reform:** If one party must receive a windfall or lucky break, plaintiffs are more deserving. The harmed party who did nothing wrong, suffered damages, and navigated the judicial process shouldn't be disadvantaged by the happenstance of multiple wrongdoers. Defendants engaged in negligent conduct deserve no favor.

**Against the Reform:** This reasoning conflates corrective and punitive justice. Moreover, the reform would trigger a flood of litigation, with plaintiffs aggressively pursuing multiple defendants to maximize recoveries beyond actual losses. This strains judicial resources and makes society overly litigious.

Non-tortious sufficient causes also create problems. Under the current rule, when only one sufficient cause is tortious, that defendant pays full damages. The reform would maintain this while reducing liability when multiple tortfeasors exist—creating bizarre incentives where defendants benefit from the presence of other tortfeasors but not from non-tortious causes.

### V. RISK SPREADING

The reform's impact on risk spreading is unclear and potentially negative. Rather than encouraging defendants to internalize costs and spread risk, the reform might force some defendants out of industries entirely, concentrating rather than spreading risk. The current system better facilitates risk spreading through insurance and pricing mechanisms calibrated to proportional fault.

### RECOMMENDATION

The Court should maintain the current rule allowing plaintiffs one full recovery, apportioned among multiple sufficient cause tortfeasors. This approach:
- Properly compensates plaintiffs without unjust enrichment
- Provides adequate deterrence through joint and several liability
- Avoids overdeterrence of socially beneficial activities  
- Maintains principled distinction between corrective and punitive justice
- Prevents perverse incentives for plaintiff negligence and excessive litigation

While the "strength in numbers" concern has some force, joint and several liability adequately addresses it without the reform's significant downsides.
