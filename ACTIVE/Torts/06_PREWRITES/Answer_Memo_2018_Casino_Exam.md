## MEMORANDUM TO APPEALS PANEL

**RE:** Key Issues on Appeal - Hale v. Lucky Day Casino

This memo addresses the central tort issues arising from the jury's verdict for plaintiffs. The defendant casino appeals, challenging liability for Leroy Hale's death following injuries sustained when he tripped over ceiling debris. I recommend affirming the verdict with respect to defendant's failure to manage the debris, but identifying potential issues regarding causation and contributory negligence.

## I. NEGLIGENCE CLAIMS AGAINST LUCKY DAY CASINO

### A. Failure to Inspect/Maintain Ceiling (1996-2015)

**Plaintiffs' Position:**  
Lucky Day breached its duty of reasonable care by failing to inspect the plaster ceiling for 19 years. Under Hand formula analysis: (1) **Burden (B)** was low—Nies demonstrated post-accident that inspection required only removing drop ceiling tiles and using a flashlight; (2) **Probability (P)** was significant—the ceiling was 47 years old when it collapsed, and Lepore had previously repaired portions, indicating known vulnerability; (3) **Loss (L)** was severe—serious injury or death to casino patrons. The B < PL calculus favors finding negligence.

**Defendant's Counterarguments:**  
- Lepore inspected the ceiling twice (1991, 1996) without detecting problems
- Nies's post-accident inspection showed no other areas of concern, suggesting an unforeseeable isolated failure
- The 1996 drop ceiling installation significantly increased inspection costs by requiring destruction of that new ceiling to access the plaster
- No prior collapses or warnings indicated a need for inspection

**Analysis:**  
The defendant has the stronger argument here. While 47 years is a long time, the two professional inspections and post-accident findings support that this was an isolated, unforeseeable failure rather than systemic deterioration. The probability of detecting this specific section's weakness was low, and the burden increased substantially after 1996. **However**, this claim is weakened by the fact that the casino chose to install a covering rather than replace or more thoroughly inspect the aging ceiling.

**Causation Issues:**  
Even if breach exists, but-for causation is uncertain—no evidence shows regular inspection would have revealed the specific defect that caused collapse.

### B. Failure to Clear Debris/Warn Hale ⭐ **STRONGEST CLAIM**

**Plaintiffs' Position:**  
This presents the clearest negligence. After the 5 AM collapse:
- **Four hours** elapsed before Hale's 9 AM accident
- **Low Burden:** Casino could have removed debris immediately or assigned an employee to warn/guard the area. Photography for insurance could be completed quickly
- **High Probability:** Casino knew (a) Hale was blind, (b) worked nearby, (c) routinely walked this corridor, and (d) sometimes walked without his cane. The makeshift chain would not alert a blind person before creating a tripping hazard
- **High Loss:** Severe injury or death from falling into jagged plaster

The casino had actual knowledge of a specific dangerous condition and failed to protect a known vulnerable person on the premises. This is distinguishable from the inspection claim—here, the danger was known and readily addressable.

**Defendant's Counterarguments:**  
- The chain provided reasonable precaution for most people
- Low-traffic area reduced probability
- Preserving the scene was necessary for insurance/litigation
- Hale should have used his cane

**Analysis:**  
Plaintiffs prevail. The casino's knowledge of Hale's blindness and routine created a special duty to warn him specifically. The burden of warning Hale directly or posting a guard for a few hours is minimal compared to the foreseeable risk. The chain was inadequate given the casino's knowledge of Hale's disability and habits.

**Causation:**  
Strong but-for causation—Hale would not have tripped if debris was removed or he was warned. **Proximate cause** is clear: injury from tripping on uncleared debris is precisely the harm within the risk of leaving jagged debris in a walkway.

### C. Failure to Provide Intubation Kit

**Plaintiffs' Position:**  
- Large hotels maintain intubation kits (custom evidence)
- Equipment could save lives in emergencies
- Burden is reasonable for a casino operation
- Dr. Goul testified there was a "small chance" of survival with intubation

**Defendant's Counterarguments:**  
- No evidence of custom among **mid-size casinos** (distinguishable from large hotels)
- Intubation requires trained medical professionals; kit alone is insufficient
- Dr. Goul's presence was fortuitous, not foreseeable
- Custom evidence from a different industry (large hotels vs. independent mid-size casinos) is not controlling
- Even if custom applied, it's not dispositive of negligence

**Analysis:**  
Defendant prevails. The evidentiary gap regarding casino industry custom is fatal to this claim. Under Learned Hand, the burden of maintaining 24/7 trained medical staff is substantial for a mid-size casino, while the probability of benefit is speculative. Large hotels face different risks (guests staying overnight, larger facilities) and have different resources.

**Causation Issues:**  
**But-for causation fails** under traditional standard—even with equipment, survival was only a "small chance." The **lost chance doctrine** is typically limited to medical malpractice cases where statistical survival data exists. Extending it here would be problematic without clear evidence of the percentage chance lost.

## II. CONTRIBUTORY/COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE

**Defendant's Position:**  
Hale was negligent in walking without his cane. Under Hand: burden of carrying/using cane was minimal; probability of encountering obstacles in public space is always present; potential loss (serious injury) was high. A reasonable blind person would use a cane even on familiar routes.

**Plaintiffs' Counterarguments:**  
- Must apply **disability-adjusted standard**: What would a reasonably prudent blind person do under these circumstances?
- Hale took precautions: walked slowly, arm outstretched, in familiar territory
- Short trip (75 steps) in low-traffic area at 9 AM opening
- Reasonable reliance on casino to maintain safe premises and warn of known hazards
- Casino's knowledge of his habits makes his conduct more reasonable

**Analysis:**  
This is the closest call. Both sides have merit. A reasonably prudent blind person might indeed use a cane even on familiar routes, especially in a commercial establishment. **However**, Hale did take some precautions (slow pace, extended arm), and his reliance on the casino's knowledge of his routine has some force.

**Recommended Approach:**  
Assuming pure comparative negligence, I would assign **20-30% fault to Hale**. While his decision not to use the cane contributed to the accident, the casino's failure to manage a known dangerous condition with knowledge of a vulnerable plaintiff is more culpable.

## III. PROXIMATE CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Harm Within the Risk

**Ceiling Inspection Claim:**  
Defendant argues Hale's manner of injury (tripping on fallen debris while blind, then bleeding to death) is not the harm within the risk of failing to inspect ceilings. The foreseeable harm is being struck by falling debris.

**Response:** This argument has some technical merit but is ultimately unpersuasive. The reason to inspect ceilings is to prevent debris from falling where people are present. Whether injury comes from being struck during the fall or encountering debris afterward is a distinction without meaningful difference—both are foreseeable consequences of ceiling collapse in a public space.

### Debris Management Claim

Proximate cause is clearly satisfied. Tripping and being injured by debris left in a walkway is precisely the risk that makes failure to clear it negligent.

### Eggshell Plaintiff

Defendant may argue Hale's blindness was an unforeseeable condition that exacerbated harm. **Plaintiffs correctly invoke eggshell plaintiff doctrine:** defendant takes plaintiff as found. Moreover, the casino **knew** of Hale's blindness, making this condition foreseeable, not unforeseeable.

---

## IV. AFFIRMATIVE DUTY TO WARN

**Special Relationship Analysis:**  
Plaintiffs may argue the casino owed an affirmative duty to warn Hale based on:
- Three-year business relationship as independent contractor
- Casino's knowledge of Hale's disability
- Defendant's control of premises

**Analysis:**  
While independent contractors don't typically create custodial relationships, the casino's knowledge of Hale's vulnerability and regular presence, combined with premises control, may create a duty to warn of known hazards. This strengthens the debris management claim.

---

## V. THIRD-PARTY LIABILITY CONSIDERATIONS

### John Lepore (Contractor)

Defendant could have impleaded Lepore for:
- Negligent 1991/1996 repairs
- Failure to identify ceiling weakness

**Issues:**  
- Lepore testified he didn't work on the collapsed section
- No evidence of improper repairs
- Casino's 19-year failure to inspect may constitute superseding cause

### Dr. Jane Goul

**Good Samaritan Protection:**  
Assuming our state has Good Samaritan statute, Dr. Goul is likely immune from liability for emergency assistance. Plaintiffs correctly did not sue her.

---

## VI. POLICY CONSIDERATIONS

**Defendant's Position:**  
The casino charged Hale only $1/year as "a gesture of support for persons with disabilities." Imposing liability may chill charitable behavior toward disabled persons.

**Response:**  
While sympathetic, this argument is problematic. Tort law cannot create special immunity for "good Samaritans" in ongoing business relationships without legislative action. The casino benefited from Hale's presence (even at nominal rent, he provided a service and drew customers). Moreover, the duty here is not onerous—merely to warn of a known hazard. If anything, taking on a vulnerable person creates heightened responsibility.

---

## VII. RECOMMENDED DISPOSITION

**AFFIRM** the jury verdict, but with modification:

1. **Liability:** Casino is liable for negligent management of debris and failure to warn
2. **Comparative Negligence:** Reduce damages by 20-30% for Hale's contributory negligence in not using cane
3. **Rejected Claims:** No liability for failure to inspect ceiling (no causation) or failure to provide intubation kit (no custom, no causation)

**Rationale:**  
The casino's failure to warn Hale or clear debris after the collapse, with full knowledge of his blindness and routines, was unreasonable and directly caused his death. The minimal burden of warning compared to the high probability and severity of harm clearly establishes breach. Causation is straightforward on this theory. However, Hale's decision not to use his cane on this trip contributed to the accident and warrants reduction under comparative negligence principles.
