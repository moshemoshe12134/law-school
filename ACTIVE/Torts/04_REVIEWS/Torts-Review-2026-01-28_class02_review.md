# Review — Class #2 — 2026-01-28 — Reasonable Person as a Dial — Precautions, Children, and Plaintiff Fault (Core; Goss v. Allen)

---

## 1. What Professor Emphasized (3-5 main points)

1. Negligence is an **objective** “reasonable person under the circumstances” inquiry; you’re not trying to “get inside the head.” #EXAM_SIGNAL
2. **The jury makes the law (in the case)**: the instruction leaves the “how careful is careful enough?” line to aunt-and-uncle. #EXAM_SIGNAL
3. Your job in negligence is to **argue concrete, alternative precautions** (warnings, design, closures, staffing) and debate (i) feasibility/cost and (ii) whether the precaution would actually *do any good*. #EXAM_SIGNAL
4. The law deliberately **structures what facts the jury may consider** (e.g., children’s age/mental capacity/experience; adult-activity exception) — and the categories are often arbitrary. #EXAM_SIGNAL
5. “It takes two to tort”: plaintiff carelessness matters; understand **contributory vs (pure/modified) comparative negligence** and the incentives they create (including jury “fudging” under harsh regimes). #EXAM_SIGNAL

---

## 2. Exam Signals #EXAM_SIGNAL

**Explicit signals:**
- [ ] “The law does not say how a reasonably careful person would act… that is for you to decide.” (jury sets the bar) #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] “Identify precautions” → always propose specific alternatives, not abstractions. #EXAM_SIGNAL

**Implicit signals:**
- [ ] **Precaution arguments must include effectiveness** (warning/closure may not change behavior; perverse incentive / enforceability issues). #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] **Custom arguments** (“everyone else does it”) are a recurring proof move for reasonableness (to be developed later). #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] When doctrine gives you an extra variable (age/experience), **flip it both ways** (cuts for D and against D). #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] Plaintiff-fault regimes are a recurring lever: raising plaintiff negligence can be defense “off-ramp” or damages reducer. #EXAM_SIGNAL

## 3. Corrections to Prep

**My prep emphasized:** reasonable-person baseline + children/infirm + contributory/comparative structures.
**Prof emphasized more strongly:** the *mechanics* of arguing breach: pick a “dial” position (how much care is enough) and fight about concrete precaution sets, costs, and effectiveness.

**My prep framed Core mostly as “warning about shallow water.”**
**In class:** Core became a full negligence-argument lab: multiple plausible precautions (depth markers, placement, changing kiosk language, “use ladder,” closure, staffing) and why each is (un)reasonable.

---

## 4. Doctrinal Insights

### A. Reasonable person = objective, but fact-saturated
- “Objective” ≠ no facts. It means **not subjective intent**; you still use circumstances + evidence + inferences (e.g., “they were sued 10 times” → foreseeability without “internal emails”).

### B. “Dial of carefulness” picture (breach = where is the bar?)
- Jury selects the minimum amount of care on a 0 → ∞ scale; parties argue to move the bar up/down.

### C. Core v. N.C. Parks & Recreation: negligence as precautions
**Core facts (in-class):** long pier (~375 ft) into lake; water deceptively dark; shallow at end (~18 inches); Core dives headfirst → severe spinal injury; friend jumps feetfirst → tailbone injury; suit against state park for failure to warn / misleading messaging.
**Professor move:** keep translating arguments into: “what would a reasonably careful Park Service do here?”

### D. Children: categories + adult-activity exception
- Some jurisdictions treat very young children as **incapable of negligence** (class example: NY under 4; IPI suggests different treatment under 7 in IL).
- For older minors: reasonable child of **same age, mental capacity, and experience**.
- Adult-activity exception: for certain dangerous adult activities (e.g., driving) minor held to **adult standard**; prof floated visibility/other-party-precautions as part of the story.

### E. Plaintiff fault: what changes if plaintiff was careless?
- Contributory negligence: any plaintiff negligence = complete bar (harsh; juries may “fudge”).
- Comparative negligence: plaintiff negligence reduces recovery; modified adds a 50% bar.

---

## 5. Policy Arguments

**Why immunity for very young children?**
- Moral blameworthiness/agency + conceptual mismatch (“reasonable 3-year-old?”) + channeling liability to supervisors instead.

**Why adult-activity exception?**
- Safety: if you can’t do it like a reasonable adult, don’t do it.
- Reliance/visibility story: others can’t always tell it’s a child (so they can’t self-protect by adjusting their precautions).

**Why move from contributory to comparative?**
- Contributory is all-or-nothing; juries resist harshness (practical “fudging”).
- Comparative better matches intuitive responsibility allocation but creates percentage line-drawing fights.

## 6. Outline Inserts (copy-ready)

> Paste-ready blocks to add into `05_OUTLINE/` without rewriting.

### Insert: Breach as a “Dial” (Jury Sets the Standard of Care)

```markdown
**Breach (core move):** The jury picks “how careful is careful enough” under generic instructions (reasonable person under the circumstances).

**Argument structure (move the dial):**
- Plaintiff: push the bar **up** (more care was required) by emphasizing low-cost/high-impact precautions, prior incidents, and defendant’s ability to prevent harm.
- Defense: push the bar **down** by emphasizing burdens, rarity, feasibility, autonomy of users, and limits of prevention.

#EXAM_SIGNAL
```

### Insert: Precaution Set Checklist (Core Method)

```markdown
For each proposed precaution (warning / design change / staffing / closure):
1) **Specify it concretely** (where placed, wording, frequency, enforcement).
2) **Feasibility & burden (B):** cost, admin burden, enforcement, public access tradeoffs.
3) **Effectiveness:** would it *actually do any good*? (behavioral response; perverse incentives).
4) **Custom evidence:** what do comparable actors do (pools/parks)? (later topic)

#EXAM_SIGNAL
```

### Insert: Children + Adult-Activity Exception (Semi-Objective)

```markdown
**Very young children:** some jurisdictions treat young minors as incapable of negligence (bright-line age cutoff).

**Older minors:** standard is a reasonably careful child of same **age, mental capacity, and experience** under similar circumstances.

**Adult activities:** for certain dangerous adult activities (e.g., driving), minors are held to the **adult** standard of care.

#EXAM_SIGNAL
```

### Insert: Plaintiff Fault Regimes (Defense Lever)

```markdown
**Contributory negligence:** any plaintiff negligence bars recovery (rare today; harsh; juries may resist).

**Pure comparative negligence:** damages reduced by plaintiff’s percentage of fault (to 0 at 100%).

**Modified comparative negligence:** plaintiff barred if ≥50% or >50% at fault (varies by jurisdiction).
