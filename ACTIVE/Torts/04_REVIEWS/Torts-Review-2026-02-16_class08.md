# Post-Class Review — Class #8 — Proximate Cause / Scope of Liability

**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Course:** Torts
**Topic:** Proximate Cause (Traditional) vs. Scope of Liability (Restatement Third)

---

## 1. PREP VS. REALITY COMPARISON

- **Prep Accuracy:** High. The prep successfully anticipated the core distinction between Traditional "Proximate Cause" and Restatement "Scope of Liability".
- **Class Flow:** Professor Huang spent significant time building *intuitions* before introducing the black-letter rule. The "3 Intuitions" framework (Coincidence, Other Guy, Statutory Purpose) was the organizing principle for the entire class.
- **Cold Call (Moshe):** **YOU WERE ON CALL** for the Designated Driver hypo.
    -   **Topic:** Defining the scope of liability for a designated driver who fails to drive, leading to a drunk driver crashing.
    -   **Performance:** Started slightly off (focusing on the drunk driver's duty first), but quickly self-corrected when prompted. Strong on the second part of the hypo regarding the intervening cause (blue car).
    -   **Key Takeaway:** The professor used this to illustrate how "intervening cause" (the "other guy" intuition) fits into the Restatement's "harm-within-the-risk" analysis (foreseeability).

## 2. EXAM SIGNALS (#EXAM_SIGNAL)

-   **#EXAM_SIGNAL (Terminology):** We are using **Restatement Third § 29 "Scope of Liability"** as our primary framework. Avoid "proximate cause" word salad unless discussing traditional jurisdictions, but know that "foreseeability" is the engine driving both.
-   **#EXAM_SIGNAL (The 3 Intuitions):** Huang explicitly framed the analysis around three common-sense intuitions that you should be able to argue:
    1.  **Coincidence / Freak Accident:** "This is just bad luck/random, not what we want to deter." (e.g., Tree falling on speeder).
    2.  **"Really The Other Guy":** "The other actor's negligence was the *real* cause." (Intervening/Superseding cause).
    3.  **"Not What This Is About":** "The rule wasn't designed to prevent *this* kind of harm." (e.g., Serving pasta late -> speeding -> crash).
-   **#EXAM_SIGNAL (Thin Skull Exception):** Even under Scope of Liability, the **Thin Skull / Eggshell Plaintiff** rule survives. You are liable for the full extent of the harm even if the *extent* was unforeseeable, provided the *type* of harm was within the scope.

## 3. CORRECTIONS TO PREP

-   **Refinement on "Foreseeability":** The prep treated "Foreseeability" and "Harm-Within-The-Risk" as slightly distinct. Huang clarified that **foreseeability is implicit** in the definition of "tortious conduct."
    -   *Logic:* Conduct is negligent *because* it creates foreseeable risks. Therefore, "harm resulting from risks that made conduct tortious" IS "harm that was foreseeable."
-   **Intervening Causes:** The prep separated these. Huang emphasized that under Restatement Third, "intervening cause" is just another way of asking "was this specific weird chain of events foreseeable?"

## 4. DOCTRINAL INSIGHTS & SYNTHESIS

### The Restatement Third Test (§ 29)
> "An actor's liability is limited to those harms that result from the risks that made the actor's conduct tortious."

**Step-by-Step Analysis (The "Huang Method"):**
1.  **Identify the Negligence:** What exactly did the defendant do wrong? (e.g., Speeding, Serving bad clams).
2.  **Identify the Risks:** Why is that conduct negligent? What are the *foreseeable risks* that make it wrong? (e.g., Speeding -> Collision, Loss of control; Bad clams -> Food poisoning).
3.  **Compare to Harm:** Is the actual harm that occurred one of *those* specific risks?
    -   **Berry v. Sugar Notch:**
        -   *Negligence:* Speeding.
        -   *Risks:* Collision, inability to stop.
        -   *Harm:* Tree falling.
        -   *Result:* **No Liability.** Tree falling is NOT a risk that makes speeding negligent. It's a coincidence.
    -   **The "Pasta" Hypo (Aaliyah):**
        -   *Negligence:* Serving pasta left out too long (health code violation).
        -   *Risks:* Food poisoning, sickness.
        -   *Harm:* Customer is late, speeds, crashes.
        -   *Result:* **No Liability.** Speeding because of delay is NOT a risk that makes serving old pasta "tortious."

### The "Word Salad" of Traditional Proximate Cause
Huang listed these terms but dismissed them as confusing "word salad" to be avoided in favor of the Restatement test, *unless* specifically asked for traditional analysis:
-   "Remote"
-   "Direct / Indirect"
-   "Natural and probable consequences"
-   "Intervening / Superseding cause" (The "Other Guy" intuition)

## 5. POLICY ARGUMENTS ("Aunt & Uncle")

**Argument 1: The "Coincidence" Argument**
-   *Intuition:* "It's just a freak accident. Holding me liable won't deter this because it was random."
-   *Doctrinal Hook:* Unforeseeable; Not a harm within the risk.

**Argument 2: The "Other Guy" Argument (Intervening Cause)**
-   *Intuition:* "Yeah I messed up, but *he* (the other driver, the superseding actor) is the one who really caused the wreck."
-   *Doctrinal Hook:* The third party's action was unforeseeable and broke the causal chain (Traditional) OR The third party's action was not a risk that made my conduct negligent (Restatement).

**Argument 3: The "Statutory Purpose" Argument**
-   *Intuition:* "This rule/duty wasn't meant to stop *that*."
-   *Doctrinal Hook:* Harm not within the scope of the risk. (e.g., The pasta serving rule is for health, not for punctuality).

## 6. OUTLINE INSERTS

```markdown
### Scope of Liability (Proximate Cause)

**The Rule (Restatement Third § 29):**
"An actor's liability is limited to those harms that result from the risks that made the actor's conduct tortious."

**The Test (Foreseeability explicit):**
1.  **Define the Risk:** What are the foreseeable risks that make the conduct negligent in the first place?
2.  **Match the Harm:** Is the harm that occurred one of *those* risks?

**Key Cases & Hypos:**
-   *Berry v. Sugar Notch* (Speeding car hit by falling tree): **No Liability**.
    -   Speeding increases risk of collision, not risk of tree-fall.
    -   Calculated risk: Speeding does not increase probability of being at that specific spot at that specific time (could have missed it by speeding *more*).
-   *Designated Driver* (Moshe's Hypo):
    -   If drunk driver crashes into tree -> **Liability** (Exactly the risk of failing to drive).
    -   If drunk driver is hit by aggressive speeder -> **No Liability?** (Arguable. Is being hit by a speeder a risk of drunk driving? Or a risk of driving period?)

**Exceptions:**
-   **Thin Skull / Eggshell Plaintiff:** If the *type* of harm is within the scope, the defendant is liable for the full *extent* of the harm, even if unforeseeable. (e.g., *Jones v. Roth* discussion).

## 7. SOURCE EXTRACTION

-   **Restatement (Third) of Torts § 29:** The governing rule for this course.
-   **Berry v. Sugar Notch:** The paradigmatic "Coincidence" case.
-   **Jones v. Roth:** Discussed briefly for "Thin Skull" implication (if surgeon made leg fragile beforehand, defendant takes plaintiff as they find them).

---

## 8. PREWRITE OPPORTUNITIES

**The "Risk Definition" Prewrite:**
Practice defining the risks of negligent conduct *before* looking at the harm. This avoids hindsight bias.
-   *Example:* Negligence = Leaving keys in ignition.
-   *Risks:* Car theft, joyriding crash.
-   *Harm:* Car bomb detonates? (Probably not within scope).

**The "Intervening Act" Prewrite:**
Standard language for when a third party does something bad:
"Defendant will argue the third party's act was a superseding cause. Under Restatement § 29, the issue is whether the third party's intervention was a foreseeable risk that made Defendant's conduct negligent."

## 9. TRANSCRIPT QC FLAGS

-   **Discussion of "Jones v. Roth" Hypothetical (Hypo #2):** Prof. Huang left this as an exercise ("I'll leave you to do that on your own").
    -   *Action Item:* Review the hypo about the *second* accident in Jones v. Roth and apply the § 29 test.
