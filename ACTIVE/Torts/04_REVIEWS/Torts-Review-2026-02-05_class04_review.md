# Review — Class #4 — 2026-02-05 — The Learned Hand Formula (BPL) & Carroll Towing

---

## 1. What Professor Emphasized (5 main points)

1. **BPL is a STRUCTURED way of making the same cost-benefit arguments you've been making all along under reasonable-person analysis—it's NOT a new test.** Professor repeatedly framed BPL as "another way to think about reasonableness," not a replacement for reasonable-person analysis. The weighing of burden vs. foreseeable benefit has been implicit in aunt-and-uncle arguments since Day 1 (e.g., "put up a sign—it's cheap and would have prevented this"). BPL just makes it explicit. #EXAM_SIGNAL

2. **Do NOT multiply P × L. Think of PL as ONE BOX = "foreseeable good the precaution would do."** Professor explicitly warned: "Don't do that in your brain. It'll just tire you out. You'll probably get it wrong. Learned Hand kind of gets it wrong a little bit." There are no numbers, no dollar signs, no algebra. B = burden of precaution. PL = how much good the precaution would do (all foreseeable good, not just this accident). #EXAM_SIGNAL

3. **PL includes ALL foreseeable benefits, not just the specific accident that happened.** This was a major emphasis. When evaluating whether bargee should show up for work, you don't ask "would showing up prevent THIS specific freaky accident?" You ask "what are ALL the foreseeable good things that could come from showing up?" This includes preventing collisions, saving cargo from various risks, preventing explosions, etc.—the whole range of foreseeable good. #EXAM_SIGNAL

4. **The BPL analysis is done at the MOMENT of the precaution decision, looking FORWARD—not in hindsight.** Professor emphasized the temporal dimension repeatedly: "At 8 a.m., Bargee doesn't know about the caterpillar of boats. What should a reasonable bargee be thinking at that point?" The analysis is prospective and from the perspective of a reasonable actor in that position. #EXAM_SIGNAL

5. **BPL embeds a deep MORAL assumption: equal weighting of everyone's interests.** Burden is on the actor (bargee/company). Benefits are to EVERYONE—government, other companies, war effort, traffic. This is NOT "burden to me vs. benefit to me." It's "burden to me vs. benefit to all." Professor called this "a pretty powerful assumption" embedded in this "little IV formula." #EXAM_SIGNAL

---

## 2. Exam Signals #EXAM_SIGNAL

**Explicit signals:**

- [ ] **Name the precaution precisely**: Every BPL analysis must zero in on ONE specific untaken precaution. "Especially using the BPL formula, you want to be very precise about what exact precaution we're talking about." #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] **Run it BOTH WAYS**: Always argue B is low/PL is high (negligent) AND B is high/PL is low (not negligent). This is the standard argumentative structure. #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] **Foreseeability is the gatekeeper**: Professor explicitly added "foreseeable" to the PL side of the formula on the board. Only foreseeable consequences count. Unforeseeable chains (flour → losing battle → losing war → world tyranny) get argued through foreseeability, not through the formula itself. #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] **BPL doesn't work well for children**: Class exercise applying BPL to Little Leo showed it "kind of works" but feels forced. "Is that how we're gonna argue it?" Professor suggested it's really designed for sophisticated actors (companies, adults). #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] **Don't argue BPL to juries**: "Aunt and uncle do not like cost-benefit analysis." A company defendant presenting a cost-benefit calculation to a jury = "you're toast." BPL is for judges' reasoning, not jury persuasion. #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] **BPL is embedded in the Restatement**: Restatement (Third) of Torts lists the three BPL factors: (1) foreseeable likelihood of harm, (2) foreseeable severity of harm, and (3) burden of precautions to eliminate or reduce risk. Professor read this aloud. #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] **BPL was already in Adams (Little Leo case)**: Cardozo: "Chance of harm, though remote, may betoken negligence if needless. Facility of protection may impose a duty to protect." = early BPL reasoning before Hand formalized it. #EXAM_SIGNAL

**Implicit signals:**

- [ ] **Freak accident ≠ unforeseeable**: Professor's hypos showed that even extremely unlikely chains of events can be foreseeable. The argument against is about probability (tiny chance), but the counter is that if consequences are catastrophic (world tyranny), even tiny probability makes the precaution worthwhile. #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] **Secret info defeats foreseeability**: The "decoding machine hidden in flour" hypo = if bargee can't know about it, it's not foreseeable, period. "There's no reasonable bargee who would have foreseen" secret military equipment in his cargo. #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] **Other people's precautions cut both ways**: You can argue (a) other people would take care → less need for your precaution (reduces PL); OR (b) lack of other precautions → more need for yours (increases PL). Professor noted this is "always available as an argument." #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] **Information costs are a new theme**: How do you know what the risks are? How do you know what a bargee should reasonably foresee? Information costs make BPL hard to apply precisely, which feeds into critiques. #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] **Non-commensurability critique**: How do you weigh lost sleep vs. lost flour vs. world tyranny? "Classic question in cost-benefit analysis of any kind." Will recur in LegReg. #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] **Next class = duty**: Friday will introduce duty vs. breach distinction for the first time. BPL is about breach; duty is coming. #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] **Review session slides are the OFFICIAL notes**: Professor said to download them—they are authoritative and distilled. Office hours Tuesdays 8:30-9:30 in 908. #EXAM_SIGNAL

## 3. Prep vs. Reality Comparison

**What prep predicted correctly:**
- ✅ Core structure: identify untaken precaution → argue B vs. PL → run both ways
- ✅ Foreseeability as key dimension
- ✅ Critiques: information costs, incommensurability, jury/policy discomfort
- ✅ Cold-call template (facts/actors → precaution → BPL both ways → critiques)
- ✅ Carroll Towing facts and doctrinal takeaway

**What prep missed / professor emphasized more:**
- ❌ **Do NOT think of P × L as multiplication**—prep framed it as `B < P × L` with P and L as separate variables; professor said to treat PL as one box = "all foreseeable good"
- ❌ **Moral assumptions embedded in BPL**: equal weighting of everyone's interests; burden on actor, benefits to society. Prep didn't flag this.
- ❌ **BPL applied to Little Leo**: Extensive class exercise showing BPL doesn't map well onto children's negligence. Prep didn't anticipate this application.
- ❌ **The Carroll Towing facts were taught via Gilles reading-aloud exercise**, not the opinion itself. Professor had students literally read aloud from Gilles because the opinion "is confusingly written."
- ❌ **Historical photo of lower Manhattan harbor** and vivid physical description of harbor conditions—professor cares deeply about students understanding the physical reality.
- ❌ **"4000 Little Leos" of flour**: Professor's deliberate callback to prior classes to show continuity.

## 4. Doctrinal Insights

### A. The Learned Hand Formula (BPL) — What It Actually Is

**Hand Formula (as taught, NOT as shorthand):**
- **B** = Burden of the untaken precaution (what it would cost/take the actor to do it)
- **PL** = Foreseeable good the precaution would do (all foreseeable benefits, not just this accident)
- If B < PL → precaution was worth taking → actor is negligent for not taking it
- If B > PL → precaution was NOT worth taking → actor is NOT negligent

**Critical clarifications from class:**
1. **No multiplication**: Don't separate P and L. Think of PL as "how much good would this precaution foreseeably do?"
2. **No numbers**: No dollar amounts, no percentages. Directional claims only: "low B, high PL" or "high B, low PL."
3. **Prospective analysis**: Evaluate at the moment of the precaution decision, looking forward.
4. **One precaution at a time**: Always analyze a specific, named untaken precaution.
5. **All foreseeable good**: PL includes every foreseeable benefit of the precaution, not just preventing this specific accident.

### B. Carroll Towing Facts (From Gilles Reading)

**Setup**: WWII-era New York Harbor. Extreme congestion—barges, tugboats, tankers everywhere. Government shipping flour (400,000 lbs / ~4000 bags) to troops via barge **Anna C**, owned by Connors Marine, leased by Pennsylvania Railroad.

**Sequence of events:**
1. Anna C moored at Pier 52 with two lines (couldn't reach Pier 58, her destination).
2. Unknown tug crew moored 5 additional barges to Anna C = "caterpillar" of 6 barges extending into Hudson River.
3. Cross-line tied between Anna C's tier and adjacent tier at public pier for stability.
4. Tug **Carroll** (owned by Carroll Towing) arrives to extract barge **Camden** from public pier tier.
5. Carroll's crew checks Anna C's lines, adjusts them, removes cross-line, Carroll holds caterpillar by nosing against outermost barge.
6. Carroll backs away to get Camden → Anna C's lines break → caterpillar drifts downstream.
7. Anna C collides with tanker at Pier 51; tanker's propeller punches hole in Anna C's hull.
8. Anna C takes on water; **bargee is absent** → no one notices leak → tugs don't pump → Anna C capsizes, flour lost.

**The untaken precaution**: Bargee showing up for work that day.

**Causal link**: If bargee present → notices leak → calls for help → tugs pump water → flour (some/most/all) saved.

**The legal context:**
- This is a **limitation action** (maritime—no jury, judge decides).
- Multiple parties suing each other; contributory negligence regime; damages divided equally among negligent parties.
- **Judge Learned Hand** writing for 2nd Circuit (appeal from EDNY).
- Sometimes called "Hand Formula" or "Hand Test."
- Not actually the first case to propose cost-benefit analysis (earlier opinion by Judge Swan), but became the famous one.

### C. How to Argue BPL (Structure from Class)

**Arguing negligent (B < PL):**
- Drive B LOW: "Just show up for work. It's the least you can do."
- Drive PL HIGH: "It's wartime, harbor is chaotic, collisions common, cargo is critical for war effort—enormous foreseeable good from being present."
- Pack on facts: wartime, congestion, valuable cargo, kids of danger everywhere.

**Arguing not negligent (B > PL):**
- Drive B HIGH: "Bargee responsible for 9 other boats; manpower shortage; wartime; it's a huge burden to be on this one barge all day."
- Drive PL LOW: "This specific accident was a freak occurrence; even if he were there, he might not have saved the flour; other boats with pumps could have checked."
- Pack on facts: bargee had other obligations, Anna C seemed secure when he left, cross-lines were in place.

### D. Foreseeability as Gatekeeper for PL

**Rule from class**: Only FORESEEABLE consequences count in PL.

**Professor's hypo sequence (flour → war → world tyranny):**
1. **Flour lost** → clearly foreseeable (you're carrying flour on a barge in a busy harbor)
2. **Flour goes to troops → losing battle** → arguably foreseeable (wartime, everyone knows cargo matters)
3. **Losing battle → losing war → world tyranny** → Professor showed this is ARGUABLY foreseeable ("everyone's doing their part, the whole country is at war") but counter-argument is the PROBABILITY is infinitesimal
4. **Even infinitesimal probability can justify precaution**: If consequences are basically infinite (world tyranny), even 0.000001% chance makes precaution worthwhile → "Would I show up for work to avert a 0.0000001% chance of world tyranny? Yes, absolutely."

**Secret decoding machine hypo**: Machine hidden in flour, no one knows. Losing machine → losing war.
- **Result**: NOT foreseeable because bargee has no information about it. "There's no reasonable bargee who would have foreseen" secret cargo.
- **Lesson**: Foreseeability requires that the actor could reasonably have KNOWN about the risk.

### E. BPL Applied to Little Leo (Children)

**Exercise**: Class tried applying BPL to 12-year-old Leo swinging wire near trolley tracks.

**Precaution**: Not swinging the wire.

**B (burden to Leo):**
- Low: Nobody told him to do it; no peer pressure; alternative entertainment exists.
- High: This is all he's got (poverty, scrap yard is his playground); "life fulfillment" for a 12-year-old boy.
- His economic circumstances matter (why is he in a scrap yard?).

**PL (foreseeable good of not swinging wire, from reasonable 12-year-old's perspective):**
- Electrocution (does he understand electricity? Trolleys are new technology).
- Poking someone's eye out (reasonable 12-year-old should foresee this).
- But: other people would stop him (reduces PL—other precautions available).
- Whose foresight? A reasonable child of Leo's age, mental capacity, and experience (objective but calibrated to child characteristics).

**Professor's takeaway**: BPL "kind of works" for kids but feels forced. "Is that really how we're gonna argue it?" Suggests BPL is most useful for sophisticated actors (companies, professionals). For children, the reasonable-child standard may be more natural.

### F. Critiques of BPL

1. **Children/unsophisticated actors**: Doesn't map well onto how children make decisions.
2. **Information costs**: How do you know what the real risks are? How do you estimate B and PL accurately? Getting reliable information is expensive and error-prone.
3. **Incommensurability**: How do you weigh lost sleep vs. lost flour vs. world tyranny? Non-comparable values.
4. **Don't argue it to juries**: Jurors hate cost-benefit analysis from defendants. "If you have a company defendant and you're like 'we did the calculations'... you're toast."
5. **Judges' tool**: BPL is really for judges to structure their own reasoning, override juries, or provide explanations. Judges feel they "need to reason it out" more than juries, who "make it up all the time."

### G. What's Left of BPL?

1. **Embedded in Restatement (Third)**: Three factors listed as "primary factors" for negligence analysis (foreseeable likelihood, foreseeable severity, burden of precautions). No multiplication, no inequality—just "think about these things."
2. **Embedded in prior case law**: Cardozo in Adams (Little Leo): "Chance of harm, though remote, may betoken negligence if needless. Facility of protection may impose a duty to protect."
3. **Useful for judges**: Maritime cases, bench trials, jury-waived cases. Next appearance will be a maritime case on gross negligence (BP case).
4. **Common sense heuristic**: A structured way to think about whether a precaution was worthwhile. "Maybe it's kind of embedded in common sense reasoning and has been there all along."

---

## 5. Policy Arguments

### BPL as a Negligence Framework

**For BPL:**
- Adds structure to otherwise "loosey-goosey" reasonableness standard.
- Makes foreseeability analysis explicit (not buried in vague "reasonable person" language).
- Reminds decision-makers to weigh costs AND benefits systematically.
- Embedded in Restatement—authoritative.
- Useful for judges who need to explain their reasoning (appellate review, overriding jury, bench trials).

**Against BPL:**
- Information costs: rarely have good data on B, P, or L; risk of systematic errors.
- Incommensurability: comparing unlike values is inherently subjective, not mathematical.
- Smuggles in policy choices: whose costs count? How do you value life/limb? Distributional and moral questions hidden behind pseudo-objectivity.
- Doesn't work for children or unsophisticated actors.
- Juries hate it—"you're toast" if you present it as a company defendant.
- May reduce tort law to cold efficiency calculus, undermining corrective justice aims.

### Competing Aims of Tort Law (Refreshed This Class)

**Corrective justice / righting wrongs**: Making someone pay to restore moral balance. "Torts means wrongs."
**Deterrence / incentives**: Making people pay for things they break so they'll be more careful. "You break, you pay."

BPL serves **deterrence** aim best (cost-justified precautions → efficient level of care). Its relationship to **corrective justice** is more complicated—is cold cost-benefit analysis really about "righting wrongs"?

## 6. Outline Inserts (copy-ready)

### Insert: BPL / Learned Hand Formula

```markdown
**BPL / Learned Hand Formula (Carroll Towing, 2d Cir. 1947):**

**Structure:**
- **B** = Burden of the untaken precaution (cost/inconvenience to actor)
- **PL** = All FORESEEABLE good the precaution would do (NOT just this accident)
- If B < PL → negligent (precaution was worth taking)
- If B > PL → not negligent (precaution was not worth taking)

**How to use (exam):**
1. Name ONE specific untaken precaution.
2. Argue B is low/high with FACTS.
3. Argue foreseeable PL is high/low with FACTS.
4. RUN IT BOTH WAYS.
5. Do NOT use numbers or multiply. Directional claims only.

**Critical rules:**
- Evaluate at MOMENT OF DECISION, looking forward (not hindsight).
- PL = all foreseeable benefits (not just this accident's outcome).
- Only FORESEEABLE consequences count (secret info = not foreseeable).
- Burden is on the ACTOR; benefits are to EVERYONE (moral assumption of equal weighting).
- Do NOT argue BPL to juries—they hate cost-benefit analysis from defendants.

**What BPL really is:** A structured spin on reasonable-person analysis. Not a replacement—a way to organize the same cost-benefit intuitions that are already embedded in "would a reasonable person have taken this precaution?"

**Where BPL lives now:**
- Restatement (Third) of Torts § 3: three "primary factors" = foreseeable likelihood, foreseeable severity, burden of precautions.
- Cardozo in Adams: "Chance of harm, though remote, may betoken negligence if needless. Facility of protection may impose a duty to protect."
- Judges' reasoning tool (maritime cases, bench trials, appellate review).

### Insert: Carroll Towing — Key Facts

```markdown
**U.S. v. Carroll Towing Co. (2d Cir. 1947) — Learned Hand:**

**Facts:** WWII-era NYC harbor, extreme congestion. Barge Anna C (carrying 400,000 lbs flour for troops) moored at Pier 52. Unknown tug crew attached 5 more barges = "caterpillar" of 6. Tug Carroll removed stabilizing cross-line to extract another barge; Anna C broke loose, drifted, hit tanker's propeller, took on water. **Bargee was absent**—no one noticed leak—Anna C sank, flour lost.

**Untaken precaution:** Bargee showing up for work that day.

**Holding:** Absence of bargee was negligent under cost-benefit analysis (B < PL).

**Maritime context:** No jury (judge decides); contributory negligence; damages divided equally among negligent parties; limitation action with multiple parties suing each other.

**Why famous:** Learned Hand articulated B < PL formula. Called "Hand Formula" or "Hand Test." THE classic negligence calculus case—every lawyer knows it.

#EXAM_SIGNAL
```

### Insert: Foreseeability in BPL

```markdown
**Foreseeability as gatekeeper for PL:**

- Only FORESEEABLE consequences count toward PL.
- Foreseeability = what a reasonable person in actor's position could anticipate at moment of decision.
- NOT hindsight; NOT perfect information; NOT secret information.

**How to argue foreseeability:**
- **For foreseeability:** Context makes risk obvious (wartime → cargo matters; busy harbor → collisions likely; scrap yard + kids → danger).
- **Against foreseeability:** "Freak accident"—specific chain of events was unforeseeable even if general risk category was foreseeable.
- **Even tiny probability can justify precaution** if consequences are catastrophic (world tyranny hypo).
- **Secret information defeats foreseeability** entirely (decoding machine hypo).

**Where foreseeability sits:** It's BOTH a threshold screen (does this risk belong in the analysis at all?) AND embedded in PL (how likely is this foreseeable risk?).

#EXAM_SIGNAL
```

### Insert: Themes Refreshed This Class

```markdown
**Themes (running list, refreshed Class 4):**

1. **Competing aims of tort law**: Corrective justice (righting wrongs) vs. deterrence (incentives to be careful). BPL serves deterrence best.
2. **Rules vs. standards**: BPL adds structure to the standard but remains flexible—no bright-line rule, no fixed numbers.
3. **Who decides (judge vs. jury)**: BPL is primarily a JUDGES' tool. Don't argue it to juries—they hate cost-benefit from defendants.
4. **Objective vs. subjective**: BPL evaluates from reasonable person's perspective (objective) but calibrates to actor's characteristics (child's age/mental capacity).
5. **Information costs** (NEW): How do you know what B and PL really are? Getting reliable estimates is expensive and error-prone.
6. **Institutional competence**: Juries use common sense; judges use structured reasoning; maybe BPL is about judges needing structure that juries don't need.
7. **What more facts?**: Always ask what additional facts would strengthen each side of the BPL argument.

## 9. Hypo Bank (from Class)

### Hypo 1: Irreversible Damage to Barge
- Change: Barge damage is so severe no pumping could save it.
- Effect: PL goes DOWN (bargee's presence couldn't have saved boat/flour).
- But: Still might have done other good (alert others, prevent further damage, save other cargo).

### Hypo 2: Half the Flour Unsaveable
- Change: Water soaks half the flour immediately; bargee could only save half.
- Effect: PL goes DOWN relative to saving all flour.
- B stays the SAME (still just "show up for work").
- Still negligent? Professor says yes—even half the flour is enormous foreseeable benefit.

### Hypo 3: Flour → Battle → War → World Tyranny
- Change: Lost flour causes troops to lose battle → lose theater → lose war → world tyranny.
- Effect: PL goes WAY UP (catastrophic consequences).
- Foreseeability argument: Wartime, everyone knows cargo matters → arguably foreseeable.
- Counter: Probability of exact chain = infinitesimal → but even tiny P × catastrophic L = worth it.
- Key lesson: "Would I show up for work to avert 0.000001% chance of world tyranny? Yes."

### Hypo 4: Secret Decoding Machine in Flour
- Change: One bag contains secret war-winning machine, nobody knows except top officials.
- Effect: NOT foreseeable to bargee → does NOT count in PL.
- Key lesson: Foreseeability requires the actor could reasonably have known about the risk.

### Hypo 5: Little Leo — BPL Analysis
- Precaution: Don't swing wire.
- B (low): Nobody told him to; no peer pressure; alternative play exists.
- B (high): Only toy he has; poverty; "life fulfillment."
- PL (high): Electrocution, poking eyes, general danger.
- PL (low): Other people would stop him; electricity is new technology; 12-year-old can't foresee.
- Takeaway: BPL "kind of works" but feels forced for children.

### Hypo 6: Trolley Company Insulation — BPL
- Precaution: More insulation on trolley wire.
- B (low): Easy, cheap to add a little more insulation.
- B (high): Can't insulate fully (trolley won't run); can't bury wire underground for trolley.
- PL (high): Kids in scrap yard, metal everywhere, birds, system failures, all foreseeable.
- PL (low): Freak accident for a kid to do this; other precautions exist (signs, fences).
- Cross-cutting: No other precautions exist (no signs, no fences) → insulation does MORE good precisely because nothing else is protecting anyone.

---

## 10. Connections to Prior & Future Classes

### Connections Back
- **Reasonable person standard** (Classes 1-3): BPL is a structured version of the same inquiry; not a replacement.
- **Rules vs. standards** (Class 3): BPL adds structure but remains a standard (no bright-line numbers). Professor on the spectrum: "the reasonable person analysis... is a little slippery, whereas here you have a way to think about it."
- **Custom / TJ Hooper** (Class 3): Same Judge Learned Hand, same Second Circuit, same type of case (barges). TJ Hooper had an even earlier BPL-like analysis. Professor: "these guys know a lot about barges."
- **Adams / Little Leo** (Class 1): Cardozo's reasoning in Adams = early BPL. Professor read the Cardozo quote aloud. BPL applied to Leo's facts as exercise.
- **Children's standard** (Class 2): Reasonable child of same age/mental capacity/experience. BPL calibrated to this but feels forced.

### Looking Ahead
- **Friday = Duty**: First time separating duty from breach. BPL is about breach; duty is a different question.
- **BP case (future)**: Another maritime case using BPL-like analysis for gross negligence.
- **Causation (starting next week)**: The causal link here (bargee present → notices leak → gets help → saves flour) is assumed but will be formally analyzed soon.

---

## 11. Administrative Notes

- **Review sessions**: Every 2 Tuesdays at lunchtime. Slides = official notes. Recorded (will be on Echo). Download slides from Courseworks.
- **Office hours**: Tuesdays 8:30-9:30 a.m. in Room 908. Snacks provided. Come even without specific questions.
- **One more class this week**: Friday (Bluebirds on call). Will cover duty.
- **Snow day catch-up**: Today's class gets them caught up to schedule.
- **A former student poured flour into the Hudson River** in honor of Carroll Towing. Professor approves.

## 12. Study Tips / Exam Preparation

✅ **Memorize the BPL structure**: B = burden of precaution; PL = all foreseeable good. B < PL = negligent. B > PL = not negligent.

✅ **Always name the precaution**: "The untaken precaution was ___." Then analyze B and PL for THAT specific precaution.

✅ **Run it both ways**: Every BPL argument must include plaintiff-side (low B, high PL) AND defense-side (high B, low PL).

✅ **Use facts aggressively**: Pack facts into both B and PL arguments. "Any reasonable bargee under THESE CIRCUMSTANCES..."

✅ **Foreseeability = gatekeeper**: Only foreseeable consequences count. Argue foreseeability explicitly.

✅ **Don't multiply, don't use numbers**: Directional claims only. "The burden was modest; the foreseeable benefit was enormous."

✅ **Know the critiques**: Information costs, incommensurability, doesn't work for kids, juries hate it, smuggles policy choices.

✅ **BPL ≠ new test**: It's a structured way of making the same reasonable-person arguments. Restatement embeds it. Cardozo used it in Adams before Hand formalized it.

✅ **Know Carroll Towing facts cold**: Bargee absent → barge breaks loose → hits tanker → sinks → flour lost. Precaution = show up for work.

---

**BOTTOM LINE FOR EXAM**: BPL is a structured way to argue about whether a precaution was worth taking. Name the precaution. Argue B low/PL high (negligent) and B high/PL low (not negligent). Pack in facts. Foreseeability is the gatekeeper—only foreseeable consequences count. Don't multiply P × L. Don't argue it to juries. Know Carroll Towing facts. Know the critiques. It's embedded in the Restatement and in Cardozo's earlier reasoning.
