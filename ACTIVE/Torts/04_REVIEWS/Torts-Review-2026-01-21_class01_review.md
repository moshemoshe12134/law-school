# Review — Class #1 — 2026-01-21 — “Walk-In Blind” — Tort Theory + Negligence Preview (Adams v. Bullock)

---

## 1. What Professor Emphasized (3-5 main points)

1. The classroom method is adversarial role-play: argue both sides, with and without doctrine, to a jury. #EXAM_SIGNAL
2. Torts is fact-driven; “add facts” and use imagination to test how liability arguments swing. #EXAM_SIGNAL
3. Negligence is the starting point: liability turns on whether someone should have been “more careful” (reasonableness as a jury question). #EXAM_SIGNAL
4. Tort theory is an argument engine (corrective justice vs deterrence/incentives) for “who should pay?” #EXAM_SIGNAL
5. *Adams v. Bullock* is used as the first sandbox for foreseeability, precautions, and Cardozo’s rhetoric. #EXAM_SIGNAL

---

## 2. Exam Signals #EXAM_SIGNAL

**Explicit signals:**
- [ ] “Put more facts… This is a question that is going to come up all the time in torts class.” #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] Negligence = “reasonable person” standard; jury decides reasonableness; doctrine structures argument. #EXAM_SIGNAL

**Implicit signals:**
- [ ] Every negligence analysis must articulate a plausible precaution set (what could have been done; at what cost; with what effect). #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] Tort theory labels (corrective justice; deterrence) are expected as explicit argumentative moves, not as afterthought policy. #EXAM_SIGNAL

---

## 3. Corrections to Prep

**My prep said:** Day 1 is KA + *Adams v. Bullock* as a fact pattern, with emphasis on “who should pay and why?” and translating ordinary arguments into tort-theory categories.
**Prof clarified:** Exactly that, but he front-loaded method training (Hamlet exercise) to make explicit how he wants you to read, infer facts, and role-play arguments.
**Fix:** Treat “role assignment” as part of the skill: always be able to flip positions and still sound principled.

**My prediction:** We’d start with case facts and then layer theory on top.
**Actually emphasized:** Start with interpretive uncertainty and missing facts; then build to negligence as a law-of-accidents framework.
**Lesson:** In prep, write “missing facts that change outcome” for each case and practice adding them.

---

## 4. Doctrinal Insights

**New understanding:**
- Negligence is not a dense rule; it’s a structured argument about reasonableness, causation, and available precautions.
- “Legal design” choices (rules vs standards; age cutoffs; child standard of care) determine who decides (judge vs jury) and what arguments are available.

**Statutory/professor moves:**
- Cardozo’s rhetorical move: withhold concrete facts to make an accident feel “unimaginable,” then label it unforeseeable.
- Reinsert concrete facts to re-open foreseeability and make low-cost precautions visible (e.g., shielding the wire under the bridge).

---

## 5. Policy Arguments

**Strong arguments prof rewarded:**
- **Corrective justice:** liability as moral responsibility for causing injury (who “wronged” whom).
- **Deterrence/incentives:** liability as a tool to induce cost-justified precautions (change future behavior of firms/parents/kids).

**Strong critiques prof anticipated:**
- Precautions can backfire (a warning sign might attract kids).
- Assignment of responsibility depends on capacity and agency (does “being 12” change what we can demand?).

**Exam-ready policy paragraphs:**
- **Deterrence framing:** Put costs on the least-cost avoider to shift incentives toward safer systems; interrogate what precautions were feasible.
- **Corrective justice framing:** Liability tracks responsibility for creating a wrongful risk; identify whose conduct is most blameworthy given context.

## 6. Outline Inserts (copy-ready)

> Paste-ready blocks to add into `05_OUTLINE/` without rewriting.

### Insert: Negligence = Structured Argument (Not a Single Rule)

```markdown
**Negligence (core move):** Defendant is liable for accidental injury if defendant failed to act as a reasonable person would under the circumstances.

**Exam approach:**
1) Identify who should have taken precautions.
2) Specify concrete precautions (fencing/shielding/warnings/design change).
3) Argue foreseeability + effect (would the precaution actually reduce risk?).
4) Argue costs (cheap vs burdensome) and countereffects (perverse incentives).
5) Tie the story to a theory: corrective justice vs deterrence.

#EXAM_SIGNAL
```

### Insert: “Add Facts” Toolkit (Huang Method)

```markdown
When a case feels “unforeseeable,” ask what facts are missing:
- How common was the behavior?
- What alternative precautions existed?
- What did defendant know (or should have known)?
- What were relative costs of prevention vs injury?
- Who was best positioned to reduce risk?

#EXAM_SIGNAL
```

### Insert: Adams v. Bullock — First-Day Fact Pattern

```markdown
Child on bridge swings wire → wire contacts trolley power line below → electrocution injury.
Liability dispute turns on foreseeability + reasonable precautions (e.g., shielding the line under the bridge; warning signs; redesign).

#EXAM_SIGNAL
```

### Cases

| ☐ | Case Name | Rule/Holding | Exam Point | New/Update |
|---|-----------|--------------|------------|------------|
| ☐ | *Adams v. Bullock* (Cardozo, N.Y.) | Reasonableness/foreseeability limits negligence | Cardozo rhetoric; “unforeseeable” framing vs added facts | New |

### Statutes/Rules

| ☐ | Citation | Key Provision | Prof's Interpretation |
|---|----------|---------------|----------------------|
| ☐ | (None) | — | — |

### Readings/Scholars

| ☐ | Source | Main Point | Prof's Use |
|---|--------|------------|-----------|
| ☐ | Abraham, *The Forms and Functions of Tort Law* (Intro/Functions) | Competing aims of tort law | Used as vocabulary for argument (“who should pay?”) |
| ☐ | Shakespeare, *Hamlet* (excerpt) | Interpretive ambiguity; role-play | Classroom method primer |

## 8. Prewrite Opportunities

> Potential exam questions arising from this lecture. Flag for `06_PREWRITES/`.

### Doctrinal Prewrites Identified

| ☐ | Doctrine | Question Type | Prof's Framework | Priority |
|---|----------|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| ☐ | Negligence (reasonable care; foreseeability; precautions) | Issue-spotter | “Add facts” + precaution set | High |
| ☐ | Child standard of care | Application | Rules vs standards; capacity | Medium |

### Policy Prewrites Identified

| ☐ | Topic | Question Type | Prof's Angle | Priority |
|---|-------|---------------|-------------|----------|
| ☐ | Corrective justice vs deterrence | Comparative | Translate “who pays” into theory | High |

### Prewrite Fragment (if ready to extract now)

**Doctrine:** Negligence (foreseeability + precautions)
**Trigger:** Unintentional injury with multiple possible defendants
**IRAC Starter:**
> **Issue** Whether D breached the duty of reasonable care by failing to take reasonable precautions against foreseeable injury.
> **Rule** Negligence turns on reasonableness under the circumstances; argue concrete precaution set, foreseeability, and cost/benefit (including countereffects).
> **Application template** Identify what D knew/should know, what precautions were feasible, and how different theories (corrective justice/deterrence) support competing allocations of loss.

## 9. Transcript QC

> Flag any transcript accuracy issues for correction.

**Verification status:** ⚠️ Issues Found

### Errors Detected

| Flag | Section | Issue | Suggested Correction |
|------|---------|-------|---------------------|
| #TRANSCRIPT_VERIFY | Judge name | “Cardoso” | Cardozo |
| #TRANSCRIPT_VERIFY | Case facts | “Leo Adams” | Case caption is *Adams v. Bullock*; verify child’s name (likely not “Leo”) |

**Common legal term corrections applied:**
- “Hamlett” → Hamlet

## 10. Spaced Reinforcement (10–15 minutes later)

**Self-quiz prompts (closed-book):**

1. State Huang’s classroom method in one sentence (role-play + generosity + fact work).
2. Define negligence as a jury question using the “precaution set” approach.
3. In *Adams v. Bullock*, list three possible precautions and one counterargument for each.
4. Explain how adding one fact can flip foreseeability.
5. Translate “who should pay?” into corrective justice and deterrence frames.

## METRICS

**Prediction accuracy:** {metrics.prediction_accuracy} (0=missed, 1=partial, 2=accurate)
**Time spent:** {metrics.time_spent_minutes} minutes
**Exam signals found:** {metrics.signal_count}
**Sources extracted:** {metrics.sources_count}
**Prewrite opportunities:** {metrics.prewrite_count}

**What to prep differently next time:**
- Always write a “missing facts” list and a “precaution set” list before class.
- Practice flipping sides without changing the analytic framework.
