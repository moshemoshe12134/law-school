# Review — Class #3 — 2026-02-02 — Rules vs. Standards & External Standards (Custom, Professional, Statutory)

---

## 1. What Professor Emphasized (3-5 main points)

1. **The Holmes-Cardozo debate is THE classic rules vs. standards debate in tort law**: Holmes wanted bright-line rules set by judges (predictability, no "oscillation"); Cardozo wanted fact-saturated standards decided by juries (flexibility, "everyday experience"). Cardozo won—tort law is overwhelmingly standards-based. #EXAM_SIGNAL

2. **Rules vs. standards has implications for WHO DECIDES (judge vs. jury)**: Rules = few facts matter → judge decides as matter of law (summary judgment/JMOL). Standards = all circumstances matter → jury decides. #EXAM_SIGNAL

3. **External sources of information (custom, statutes, professional standards) are NOT all created equal**: Custom is informative but NOT dispositive (TJ Hooper); professional standards (malpractice) ARE dispositive; statutes create negligence per se but only if within the statute's safety purpose. #EXAM_SIGNAL

4. **Custom can never SET the test in tort law** (TJ Hooper: "a whole calling may have unduly lagged... it never may set its own tests"). Industry practice is useful evidence but juries must still do the full negligence analysis. #EXAM_SIGNAL

5. **Malpractice is the major exception**: For professions (doctors, lawyers, accountants), juries MUST rely on expert testimony about professional standards and CANNOT use their own common sense—this makes professional standards effectively dispositive. #EXAM_SIGNAL

## 2. Exam Signals #EXAM_SIGNAL

**Explicit signals:**
- [ ] Holmes-Cardozo debate = canonical understanding of rules vs. standards in American tort law. #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] "Courts must in the end say what is required" (TJ Hooper) = custom is never dispositive. #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] Professional negligence jury instructions: juries "MUST rely on expert testimony" and "MUST NOT use personal knowledge." #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] Negligence per se (statutory negligence) = automatic negligence IF statute's purpose covers this type of harm. #EXAM_SIGNAL

**Implicit signals:**
- [ ] **Precedent can function like a rule**: Lower court in Parks & Rec treated *Davies* case as setting a rule (Holmes-style); appellate court rejected this (Cardozo-style—do full fact analysis). #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] **Institutional competence is everywhere**: Who has the knowledge/experience to decide? Juries (driving), experts (surgery), judges (law), legislatures (regulations). #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] **Compliance with statute/custom does NOT automatically = no negligence**: Jury can still find you negligent even if you followed industry practice or met regulatory minimum. #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] **Lopsidedness of external standards**: Violating statute/professional standard = automatic negligence; complying = helpful but not dispositive. #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] **Professor repeatedly connects legal design to first-year pedagogy purpose**: Tort law teaches civil liability design principles that apply across all legal fields (regulation, discrimination law, tax, even criminal/con law). #EXAM_SIGNAL

## 3. Corrections to Prep

**My prep (if any) likely focused on:** doctrinal rules about custom, malpractice, negligence per se as standalone topics.

**Prof emphasized more strongly:** 
- The **Holmes-Cardozo debate as THE foundational story** about how tort law evolved to be standards-based (not just historical trivia—it explains why tort practice is fact-intensive).
- **Institutional competence as the organizing principle** for understanding why different external sources get different weight.
- The **lopsidedness** of how external standards work (violating = per se negligent; complying = not dispositive).
- **Legal design as first-year pedagogy goal**: tort law is the vehicle for learning civil liability design applicable to all law.

## 4. Doctrinal Insights

### A. Rules vs. Standards (Holmes-Cardozo)

**Goodman v. Baltimore & Ohio R.R. (1927, Holmes):**
- Facts: Driver approaching railroad crossing couldn't see beyond obstruction; slowed to 5-6 mph but didn't stop and get out to look; hit by train and killed.
- Holmes: Bright-line rule = if you can't see, you MUST get out of car and go look. "When the standard is clear, it should be laid down once for all by the courts."
- Holmes's vision: Judges should create specific rules for recurring situations to prevent jury "oscillation to and fro"; promotes predictability and efficiency.

**Pokora v. Wabash Ry. Co. (1934, Cardozo):**
- Facts: Ice truck driver crossing multiple railroad tracks; view obstructed by boxcars; listened for bell/whistle (as required by regulation), heard none, proceeded; hit by train at 30 mph.
- Cardozo: Holmes's rule is sometimes dangerous, sometimes futile (by time you get back in car, train may arrive). "Standards of prudent conduct... are taken over from the facts of life." Courts should not crystallize standards into rules "artificially developed and imposed from without."
- Cardozo's vision: Juries have "everyday experience" and know how to drive; judges (Holmes never drove) don't. Tort law should evolve from common practice, not judicial fiat.
- **Result: Cardozo wins**—tort law is overwhelmingly standards-based, fact-intensive, jury-decided.

**Connection to Parks & Rec (*Core* case):**
- Lower court (commission) treated *Davies* case (14-year-old dives into 12 inches of water, breaks neck) as precedent = same facts, same outcome (Holmes-style).
- Appellate court: No—must do full fact analysis for *Core* (Cardozo-style). Each case gets fresh negligence analysis.

### B. Custom (TJ Hooper)

**Facts:** Tugboats towing barges in storm; barges sink; tugboat companies didn't provide radios to receive storm warnings (though 90% of tugs had radios, mostly crew-provided). Other tugs with radios got warning and avoided storm.

**Learned Hand opinion (Second Circuit):**
1. **Narrow the custom**: Lower court said "everyone has radios" = custom. Hand: custom must be among **similar parties** doing **same thing**. Here, custom of *crews* having radios ≠ custom of *companies providing* radios. No custom here.
2. **Custom is not dispositive anyway**: Even if nobody provides radios (no custom), companies can still be negligent for not providing them. "A whole calling may have unduly lagged in the adoption of new and available devices. It never may set its own tests, however persuasive be its usages. Courts must in the end say what is required. There are precautions so imperative that even their universal disregard will not excuse their omission."

**Custom in tort analysis:**
- Custom is **useful evidence** (what reasonable people/companies do) but jury still does full reasonableness analysis.
- **Lopsided**: Following custom doesn't automatically = no negligence; violating custom doesn't automatically = negligence.
- Custom matters more in products liability (later topic).

### C. Professional Negligence (Malpractice)

**Key sources:** doctors, lawyers, accountants, therapists, healthcare providers = "professions" (not just industries).

**Illinois Pattern Jury Instructions (Malpractice):**
- Doctor "must possess and use the knowledge, skill, and care ordinarily used by a reasonably careful [profession] practicing in the same or similar localities."
- "The law does not say how a reasonably careful [profession] would act... that is for you to decide."
- **BUT**: "In reaching your decision, you MUST rely upon opinion testimony from qualified witnesses and evidence of professional standards... You MUST NOT attempt to determine how a reasonably careful [profession] would act from any personal knowledge you may have."

**Malpractice = opposite of custom:**
- Jury MUST defer to expert testimony about professional standards.
- Expert testimony is effectively **dispositive**: If doctor didn't meet standard testified to by credible expert, that's malpractice. If doctor did meet that standard, that's NOT malpractice.
- Jury picks which expert to believe but cannot use own common sense.

**Why professions are different:**
- Expertise is too technical/specialized for lay juries (cumulative scientific knowledge).
- Professions have internal regulation, ethics, disciplinary systems—maybe more trustworthy about setting standards.
- Institutional competence: juries lack medical/legal expertise.

**Exceptions:**
1. **Common knowledge**: If error is obvious to layperson (amputated wrong leg, left sponge inside), jury can use common sense.
2. **Two schools of thought**: If multiple respected approaches exist within profession, jury can pick among expert testimony representing different schools.

### D. Statutory Negligence (Negligence Per Se)

**Core principle:** Violating a statute/regulation = automatic negligence ("negligence per se") IF the statute's purpose covers this type of harm.

**Booze Cruise case (*White* v. ?):**
- Facts: Cruise ship had "all you can drink" policy (ticket includes unlimited alcohol). Sabatino got drunk, drove, killed Bornole in crash. Plaintiff sues cruise operator.
- Maui County liquor rule prohibited advertising or serving "all the liquor you can drink for a fixed price."
- Court: Violating this ordinance = negligence per se because "this was precisely the kind of accident that this law was designed to prevent."

**Statutory negligence rules:**
1. **Violating statute = per se negligent** (automatic) IF:
   - Statute's purpose is safety-related AND
   - Covers this type of harm/plaintiff
2. **Complying with statute ≠ automatically not negligent**: Statute sets **minimum**; jury can still find you negligent for not taking additional precautions.
3. **Lopsided** (like custom, but more extreme): Violating = automatic negligence; complying = not dispositive.

**Exceptions:**
1. **Safer to violate**: If complying would be less safe in circumstances, jury can excuse violation.
2. **Statute's purpose doesn't cover this harm**: E.g., tax regulation about alcohol service wouldn't create negligence per se for drunk driving accident (not about safety).

## 5. Policy Arguments

### Rules vs. Standards

**Holmes's case for rules:**
- Predictability: people know how to behave ex ante.
- Efficiency: recurring situations get resolved quickly (summary judgment); reduces litigation costs.
- Consistency: no "oscillation to and fro" based on which jury you get.
- Rule of law: judge-made law is more legitimate than jury-made law.

**Cardozo's case for standards:**
- Flexibility: can't anticipate all circumstances; bright-line rules will be under- or over-inclusive.
- Institutional competence: juries have "everyday experience" that judges lack (Holmes never drove a car).
- Evolution: tort law evolves from "facts of life" and common practice, not "artificially developed" judicial rules.
- Fairness: each case gets individualized analysis based on actual circumstances.

**Result: Standards won in American tort law** (but rules persist in pockets like children's categories, adult-activity exception, statutory negligence).

### Custom vs. Professions vs. Statutes

**Why custom is NOT dispositive:**
- Industries may "unduly lag" in safety (financial incentives to cut corners).
- No guarantee industry optimizes for public safety vs. profit.
- Juries (representing public) should set standards, not private industries.

**Why professions ARE different:**
- Expertise gap is too large for juries (unlike driving/boat operation).
- Professions have internal ethics/regulation systems (self-policing).
- Public policy: don't want juries second-guessing doctors based on Google searches.

**Why statutes create per se negligence:**
- Legislature has democratic legitimacy to set behavior standards.
- Statutes represent collective judgment about minimum safety.
- BUT: legislatures don't set tort law directly; tort law "borrows" statutes where relevant.

### Institutional Competence (Meta-Theme)

Who decides what?
- **Juries**: Everyday activities (driving, diving, parenting) where common sense applies; fact-finding.
- **Experts**: Technical/scientific questions (surgery, engineering) beyond lay knowledge.
- **Judges**: Legal questions; summary judgment when facts are undisputed and law is clear (rare in tort).
- **Legislatures**: General behavioral standards (speed limits, licensing) that tort law can borrow.
- **Industries/Professions**: Useful information but not final authority (except professions via expert testimony).

## 6. Outline Inserts (copy-ready)

> Paste-ready blocks to add into `05_OUTLINE/` without rewriting.

### Insert: Rules vs. Standards (Holmes-Cardozo)

```markdown
**Rules vs. Standards = foundational tort law design question:**

**Rules (Holmes vision):**
- Bright-line cutoffs based on small number of facts.
- Judges decide as matter of law (summary judgment/JMOL).
- Benefits: predictability, efficiency, consistency.
- Costs: rigidity, under/over-inclusive, divorced from experience.

**Standards (Cardozo vision — WINNER):**
- Flexible, fact-saturated, "totality of circumstances."
- Juries decide using common sense and everyday experience.
- Benefits: tailored justice, evolution from practice, legitimacy.
- Costs: unpredictability, inconsistency ("oscillation to and fro").

**Canon:** *Goodman* (Holmes: must get out and look) overruled by *Pokora* (Cardozo: depends on circumstances).

**Result:** American tort law is overwhelmingly **standards-based**. Pockets of rules remain (age cutoffs for children, statutory negligence, etc.).

#EXAM_SIGNAL
```

### Insert: Custom in Tort Law (TJ Hooper Rule)

```markdown
**Custom = useful evidence but NEVER dispositive.**

**TJ Hooper principle:** "A whole calling may have unduly lagged in the adoption of new and available devices. It never may set its own tests, however persuasive be its usages. Courts must in the end say what is required."

**How custom works:**
1. **Violating custom** → strong evidence of negligence (but jury can find no negligence).
2. **Following custom** → strong evidence of reasonableness (but jury can still find negligence).
3. Jury does full reasonableness analysis; custom is one factor among many.

**Why custom isn't dispositive:** Industries may prioritize profit over safety; public (via jury) should set standards.

**Exam move:** Bring in custom evidence if available, but always argue full precaution analysis (cost, effectiveness, foreseeability).

#EXAM_SIGNAL
```

### Insert: Professional Negligence (Malpractice)

```markdown
**Professions (doctors, lawyers, accountants, therapists) get special treatment:**

**Standard:** "Knowledge, skill, and care ordinarily used by a reasonably careful [profession] practicing in the same or similar localities."

**Jury instructions (key difference from regular negligence):**
- Jury MUST rely on expert testimony about professional standards.
- Jury MUST NOT use own knowledge/common sense.

**Effect:** Expert testimony is **dispositive** (unlike custom):
- If defendant didn't meet expert's standard → malpractice.
- If defendant met expert's standard → NOT malpractice.

**Exceptions:**
1. **Common knowledge:** Error obvious to layperson (wrong limb, left sponge inside).
2. **Two schools of thought:** Jury picks among competing respected expert approaches.

**Why different:** Expertise gap too large; professions self-regulate; institutional competence.

#EXAM_SIGNAL
```

### Insert: Statutory Negligence (Negligence Per Se)

```markdown
**Negligence per se = automatic negligence for violating statute/regulation IF statute's purpose covers this harm.**

**Rule:**
1. **Violating statute** → negligence per se (no jury question on breach) IF:
   - Statute is safety-related, AND
   - Harm is within class of risks statute designed to prevent.
2. **Complying with statute** → NOT automatically non-negligent (statute is minimum; jury can require more).

**Lopsidedness:** Violation = per se negligence; compliance = not dispositive.

**Exceptions:**
1. **Safer to violate:** Compliance would be more dangerous in circumstances.
2. **Statute's purpose doesn't cover this harm:** E.g., tax regulation not about safety.

**Example:** *Booze Cruise* case—violating "no all-you-can-drink" ordinance = per se negligence for drunk driving accident because ordinance designed to prevent exactly this harm.

## 9. Connections to First-Year Pedagogy (Prof's Meta-Point)

Professor repeatedly emphasized tort law as vehicle for teaching **legal design principles** applicable across all law:

- **Civil liability structure:** How to allocate responsibility when things go wrong (products, discrimination, tax, regulation, criminal).
- **Institutional competence:** Who decides (juries, judges, experts, legislatures, agencies)—central to Admin, LegReg, Con Law.
- **Rules vs. standards:** Recurring design choice in all legal fields.
- **External standards:** How different legal regimes interact (torts "borrowing" from statutes, regulations, professional codes).

**Exam implication:** Professor cares about **design reasoning** (why this structure? what are tradeoffs? who has competence?) not just doctrinal rules.
