# Torts Class #7 Review — Alternative & Market Share Liability

## 1. Prep vs. Reality Comparison

The class followed the prep document very closely, focusing entirely on the two main cases: *Summers v. Tice* and *Hymowitz v. Eli Lilly*.

**Matched Expectations:**
-   **Summers v. Tice**: Covered in depth as the classic "Alternative Liability" case. The discussion hit all the prepped points: burden shifting, information forcing, and fairness/compensation.
-   **Hymowitz v. Eli Lilly**: Covered as the "Market Share Liability" case. Key elements like the "signature disease," fungible product, and long latency were central. The distinction between absolute and relative market share was discussed, with the court choosing absolute (national) share.
-   **Rationale**: The shift from proving causation to charging for "risk creation" was a major theme, exactly as expected.

**Surprises/Additions:**
-   **Multiple Fires Wrap-up**: The class started with a significant wrap-up of the "multiple fires" scenarios (likely from *Anderson* or *Kingston*), specifically discussing how to apportion damages (comparative negligence vs. causation).
-   **"Hail" Hypo**: A specific hypo involving one hunter and a hailstorm (natural cause) was used to test intuitions about alternative liability when one cause is non-tortious/natural.
-   **Risk Creation as Harm**: Huang explicitly linked *Hymowitz* to *Matsuyama* (Loss of Chance) as frontier cases where tort law effectively charges for "risk creation" rather than traditional factual causation.

## 2. Exam Signals #EXAM_SIGNAL

-   **"Edge of what we know"**: Huang explicitly stated, "A lot of what we're doing in this class... is getting to the edge of what we know... Here, we're really going to be asking about what the law should be." #EXAM_SIGNAL — usage of policy arguments to resolve edge cases is expected.
-   **"Aunt and Uncle"**: Huang referenced "aunt and uncle" (likely the jury/fact-finder) deciding how to split damages based on "negliginess" (comparative negligence).
-   **"Frontiers of tort law"**: *Hymowitz* and *Matsuyama* are explicitly framed as "frontiers" where the law charges for risk creation. This is a likely exam theme: pushing the boundaries of causation.
-   **"Signature Disease"**: The concept of a "signature disease" (vaginal adenocarcinoma from DES) was highlighted as a critical fact that makes the *Hymowitz* logic work.

## 3. Corrections to Prep

-   **Relative vs. Absolute Market Share**: The prep mentioned "No Exculpation" as a feature. The class discussion clarified this further by contrasting "relative" market share (inflating shares of present defendants to cover absent ones) with "absolute" market share (plaintiff only recovers the % represented by defendants in court). *Hymowitz* uses the latter (national) share, meaning the plaintiff might not be fully compensated.
-   **Information Forcing**: The class discussion questioned the "information forcing" rationale in *Summers*, noting that defendants (like 6 newbies) might genuinely not know who shot, just like the plaintiff. The doctrine applies regardless.

## 4. Doctrinal Insights

-   **Alternative Liability (*Summers*)**:
    -   **Requirements**: Small group (2-3), all negligent, one caused harm, plaintiff can't identify which.
    -   **Effect**: Shifts burden of proof to defendants to exonerate themselves. If they can't, they are jointly and severally liable.
    -   **Rationales**:
        1.  **Information Forcing**: "Smoke out" evidence from defendants who might know more.
        2.  **Fairness**: Better to hold a negligent defendant liable (even if they didn't cause *this* specific harm) than to leave an innocent plaintiff uncompensated.
        3.  **Moral Luck**: Both defendants were equally negligent; one just got "lucky." The law effectively wipes out this luck.

-   **Market Share Liability (*Hymowitz*)**:
    -   **Requirements**: Fungible product (identical), signature disease, long latency, many manufacturers (making identification impossible).
    -   **Effect**: Liability based on **National Market Share**.
    -   **Nature of Liability**: Several only (not joint). Each pays only their % share of the damages.
    -   **No Exculpation**: A defendant *cannot* avoid liability by proving they didn't cause the specific plaintiff's harm (unless they weren't in the market at all). Liability is based on overall risk contribution to the national market.

-   **Apportionment**:
    -   Tort law typically apportions damages based on **comparative negligence** ("negliginess") rather than "causal contribution" (e.g., number of fires set).
    -   *Exception*: In *Hymowitz*, liability *is* based on causal contribution (market share = risk contribution).

## 5. Policy Arguments

-   **Deterrence**:
    -   In *Summers*: Holding both liable deters negligent hunting, even if we catch a non-causal actor. "We really don't want people to shoot guns that they're not sure where it's gonna go."
    -   In *Hymowitz*: Charging for market share accurately internalizes the cost of the risk created by each manufacturer.

-   **Corrective Justice / Fairness**:
    -   **Plaintiff-centric**: The "strong intuition" that the innocent plaintiff should be compensated.
    -   **Defendant-centric**: "Why should we let him off the hook? In the way we would if it was just one person... They didn't do anything." Counter-argument: It's unfair to hold someone liable when they didn't cause the injury (conflicts with the "but-for" principle).

-   **Information Access**:
    -   Argument *for* *Summers*: Defendants are in a better position to know what happened.
    -   Argument *against*: "They're both terrible shots... They don't know where they're shooting... How are they gonna know?"

-   **Risk Creation as Harm**:
    -   The move in *Hymowitz* (and *Matsuyama*) redefines the "harm" as the **creation of risk**. Once you accept that risk creation is the harm, the causation problem disappears.

## 6. Outline Inserts

### Alternative Liability (*Summers v. Tice*)
> **Rule**: When two or more defendants act negligently, but only one caused the injury, and the plaintiff cannot identify which one, the **burden of proof shifts** to the defendants to exonerate themselves. #EXAM_SIGNAL
> *   **Result**: If they cannot disprove causation, they are **jointly and severally liable**.
> *   **Rationale**: Information forcing ("smoke out" evidence); preventing innocent plaintiff from bearing cost; erasing "moral luck" of the defendant who missed.
> *   **Key Constraint**: Must be a small group where *all* are negligent and *one* is the cause.

### Market Share Liability (*Hymowitz v. Eli Lilly*)
> **Rule**: In cases involving a fungible product causing a signature disease with long latency (making identification impossible), liability is apportioned based on **national market share**. #EXAM_SIGNAL
> *   **Type of Liability**: **Several likelihood** (not joint). Defendant pays only their share.
> *   **No Exculpation**: Defendant cannot escape by proving they didn't cause the specific plaintiff's harm (unless they weren't in the market at all).
> *   **Theory**: Liability is based on **risk creation** (the amount of risk injected into the market) rather than factual causation in the individual case.

## 7. Source Extraction

-   **Cases**:
    -   *Summers v. Tice* (The classic "two hunters" case).
    -   *Hymowitz v. Eli Lilly* (The DES market share case).
    -   *Matsuyama* (referenced again as a parallel "risk creation" case).
    -   *Carroll Towing* (referenced briefly regarding liability splitting in maritime law).
    -   *Cindy* (mentioned as another DES case).

-   **Concepts**:
    -   **"Signature Disease"**: A disease exclusively linked to a specific cause (e.g., DES).
    -   **"Fungible Product"**: Identical products made by different manufacturers (e.g., generic DES).

## 8. Prewrite Opportunities

-   **Risk Creation vs. Causation**: A prewrite comparing *Matsuyama* (Loss of Chance) and *Hymowitz* (Market Share Liability) as instances where tort law abandons "but-for" causation in favor of "risk creation" liability.
    -   *Theme*: "Tort law moving towards regulatory/deterrence goals over corrective justice in complex cases."

-   **The "Natural Cause" Problem**: A prewrite on how to handle *Summers*-type situations where one potential cause is natural (e.g., the "Hail" hypo).
    -   *Argument*: Can we shift the burden if one "shooter" is nature? (Likely not, as seen in the class discussion).

## 9. Transcript QC Flags

-   **Speaker IDs**: Generally good.
-   **Content**: The transcript seems complete, capturing the full discussion of both cases and the hypothetical variations.
-   **Clarity**: Some student responses were a bit fragmented, but Huang's summaries clarified the points effectively.
