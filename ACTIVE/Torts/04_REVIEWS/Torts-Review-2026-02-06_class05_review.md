# Review — Class #5 — 2026-02-06 — Duty: No Duty Doctrine & Affirmative Duties

---

## 1. What Professor Emphasized (5 main points)

1. **DUTY is about judges deciding "is this even your problem?" — it's about whether you're INVOLVED enough in the situation for tort law to care.** Professor repeatedly emphasized that duty is distinct from breach/negligence. Even if you acted completely unreasonably (negligent), if you had no duty, you're off the hook. Duty = judge decides whether tort law applies at all. No duty = judge takes case away from jury entirely, matter of law. This is about WHO DECIDES and controlling the jury. #EXAM_SIGNAL

2. **The core distinction is NOT act vs. omission — it's CREATING RISK vs. WITHHOLDING A BENEFIT (harming vs. not helping).** Cardozo's Moch language sets this up: "launching a force or instrument of harm" vs. "refusal to become an instrument for good." Every tort can be framed as both act and omission (you did X without precaution Y), so that's not the real line. The real line: Did you CREATE the dangerous situation in the first place? If yes → potential duty. If no → generally no duty (you're just a bystander who didn't help). #EXAM_SIGNAL

3. **Affirmative duties exist in TWO situations: (1) UNDERTAKING to help, and (2) SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP.** Even if you didn't create the risk, you can still have a duty if: (1) you voluntarily undertook to help (then you must do it carefully — "hand set to the task"), or (2) you have a special relationship with the victim (parent-child, doctor-patient, caregiver-dependent). If you undertake and do it negligently, you're liable. The undertaking creates the duty. Special relationships are narrow: caretaking, dependency, pre-existing relationship. #EXAM_SIGNAL

4. **Baselines matter — where you put the baseline determines whether someone is "harming" or just "not helping."** Professor emphasized this explicitly as a new theme. If baseline = person is safe, then not helping = harming them. If baseline = person is in danger already, then not helping = just leaving them where they are. This is a MORAL/DESIGN choice embedded in tort law. Tort law traditionally chooses baseline = status quo (person already in danger), so not helping ≠ harming. But you can argue for different baselines in edge cases. #EXAM_SIGNAL

5. **No duty cases are POLICY-HEAVY and require both (A) applying traditional principles AND (B) pure policy arguments for what the law SHOULD be.** Sabatino designated-driver case shows this: Hawaii Supreme Court has to decide whether to recognize a new category of duty. Arguments include: traditional tort principles (did they undertake? create risk?), but ALSO pure policy (administrability, incentive effects, floodgates, encouraging helpful behavior, corrective justice, deterrence). Professor said we're doing "appellate lawyering" — asking courts to MAKE law, not just apply it. #EXAM_SIGNAL

---

## 2. Exam Signals #EXAM_SIGNAL

**Explicit signals:**

- [ ] **Always ask "Did they CREATE the risk or just fail to help?"**: This is the foundational duty question. If they created the risk → red zone → potential duty. If they didn't create the risk → green zone → generally no duty unless affirmative duty applies. #EXAM_SIGNAL

- [ ] **Undertaking analysis requires precision about WHAT they undertook**: If arguing someone undertook to help, be specific: Did they say they'd help? Did they start to help? Did they touch the thing? The more involvement, the stronger the undertaking argument. "Hand set to the task" = you started, now you have to finish carefully. #EXAM_SIGNAL

- [ ] **Argue BOTH WAYS in gray areas**: Professor explicitly said these are "blurry boundaries," "edge cases," "toss-ups." In gray areas, make arguments both directions using facts. Example: designated driver — argue they undertook (said "don't worry, we'll take care of her") AND argue they didn't (never used words "designated driver," could mean many things). #EXAM_SIGNAL

- [ ] **Special relationships are NARROW and require actual relationship with the VICTIM**: Parent-child, doctor-patient, caregiver-dependent. Must be caretaking/dependency relationship. Must be with the injured party (not just someone else). Tarasoff is an OUTLIER exception (psychiatrist-patient relationship extending to third-party victim). Don't assume special relationship exists. #EXAM_SIGNAL

- [ ] **Policy arguments matter in duty questions**: Unlike breach (where you're applying reasonableness standard), duty questions often require policy arguments: administrability, floodgates, incentive effects (will this discourage helping?), corrective justice (is it a wrong not to help?), line-drawing manageability. Cite these explicitly when arguing for/against recognizing a duty. #EXAM_SIGNAL

**Implicit signals:**

- When duty is established, revert to standard negligence analysis (reasonable person, BPL, industry custom, etc.)
- Statutory negligence (negligence per se) ONLY works if underlying statute is not a tort statute itself — use standard from statute, but still need common law duty
- Warning adequacy = negligence analysis once duty to warn is established (reasonable warnings, not exhaustive; avoid "warning clutter")

---

## 3. Key Rules & Doctrines

### A. Duty — No Duty Framework

**General Rule**: Duty is a threshold question decided by judges (matter of law) about whether defendant was "involved enough" in the situation for tort law to apply.

**Three Zones**:

1. **RED ZONE (Duty exists)**: Defendant CREATED THE RISK
   - If you created the dangerous situation → potential duty
   - Standard negligence analysis applies (reasonable care, BPL, etc.)
   - Most torts fall here (Little Leo, trolley company, Carroll Towing bargee)

2. **GREEN ZONE (No duty)**: Defendant DID NOT CREATE RISK and DID NOT GET INVOLVED
   - If you didn't create risk AND didn't try to help → no duty
   - Even if completely unreasonable not to help → still no liability
   - Tort law doesn't impose duty to rescue/help strangers
   - Example: Seeing neighbor's flower pot about to fall, doing nothing

3. **RED BUBBLE (Affirmative Duty)**: Defendant DID NOT CREATE RISK but HAS DUTY due to:
   - **(1) UNDERTAKING**: Voluntarily began to help → must do it carefully
     - "Hand set to the task" — if you start helping, don't be negligent
     - Example: Surgeon operating without pay (Moch); moving flower pot to "safe" spot
     - Creates duty even though didn't create original risk
   - **(2) SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP**: Pre-existing relationship with victim
     - Parent-child, doctor-patient, caregiver-dependent
     - Narrow category, requires caretaking/dependency relationship
     - Must be with the VICTIM (not just someone else)
     - Exception: Tarasoff (psychiatrist's duty to warn third-party victim — outlier)

### B. Cardozo's Moch Principles

**Classic formulations** (from H.R. Moch Co. v. Rensselaer Water Co.):

1. **"Misfeasance vs. nonfeasance is incomplete and misleading"** — not about act vs. omission
   - Every tort can be described as both act and omission
   - Not the right framework for duty analysis

2. **Real distinction**: 
   - **Creating harm** = "launched a force or instrument of harm" → potential duty
   - **Withholding benefit** = "refusal to become an instrument for good" → no duty
   - "Inaction would commonly result not negatively, merely in withholding a benefit, but positively or actively in working an injury" → duty exists

3. **Undertaking principle**: "One who assumes to act even though gratuitously may thereby become subject to the duty of acting carefully if he acts at all"
   - Surgeon who operates without pay liable for negligent sterilization
   - If you voluntarily help → must do it carefully

### C. Statutory Negligence & Duty

**When statute is NOT a tort statute** (just regulatory requirement):
- Still need common law duty analysis first
- Can use statutory standard for breach IF duty exists
- But statute doesn't create duty by itself

**Example — Kuyler case**:
- ANCAA Act (Illinois) = reporting statute (call hotline if suspect abuse)
- NOT a tort statute → doesn't create tort liability
- Still need common law duty → hospital had no duty to Kuyler family
- No special relationship (Kuyler baby not their patient)
- No undertaking (didn't try to help Kuyler family)
- Not a Tarasoff situation (Higgs not their patient, didn't threaten anyone to them)

### D. Warning Adequacy (Once Duty to Warn Exists)

**General rule**: Manufacturer with dangerous product has duty to warn

**Adequacy analysis** = standard negligence:
- Reasonable person standard
- Consider: industry custom, incident rates, effectiveness of warnings
- **Warning clutter doctrine**: Too many warnings → counterproductive (nobody reads)
- Must be SPECIFIC enough about the actual danger
- Must be effective for the probable user

**Ryobi case**:
- 7+ warnings about blade guard
- But warnings suggested danger = hand injury (expected)
- Actual danger = blade flying off (unexpected, rare)
- Court held warnings adequate (policy: warning clutter)
- Counterargument: warnings not specific to THIS danger; 4 words would suffice ("blade may fly off")

---

## 4. Case Law Summary

### H.R. Moch Co. v. Rensselaer Water Co. (Cardozo)

**Facts**: Water company contracted with city to provide water. Didn't provide adequate water during fire. Plaintiff's warehouse burned down.

**Holding**: No duty. Water company merely withheld a benefit (water), didn't create the risk (fire). Contract claim might exist, but tort law doesn't impose duty.

**Significance**: 
- Established "withholding benefit" vs. "working injury" framework
- Set up principles for duty analysis (quoted extensively in later cases)
- Oddly may have come out "wrong" on facts (they DID undertake by contracting)

**Key language**:
- "Launched a force or instrument of harm" vs. "refusal to become an instrument for good"
- "One who assumes to act...may thereby become subject to the duty of acting carefully"
- Misfeasance vs. nonfeasance distinction is "incomplete and misleading"

### Sabatino v. 390 Inc. (Hawaii Supreme Court — designated driver case)

**Facts**: Booze cruise, all-you-can-drink. Welch allegedly said "don't worry, we'll take care of her" about intoxicated Sabatino. Sabatino drove drunk, killed herself and passenger Sabatino (different person).

**Issue**: Does designated driver who fails to perform have duty to VICTIMS of drunk driver (not just to driver herself)?

**Hawaii law context**:
- Bartenders/restaurants: duty to victims for overserving
- Social hosts: NO duty to victims
- Designated driver to victims: UNANSWERED QUESTION

**Arguments FOR duty** (Sabatino victims):
- Undertaking: Welch said he'd "take care of her" → undertook duty
- Saying you'll help may prevent others from helping (classic undertaking rationale)
- Created the risk: By offering to be designated driver, enabled her to drink more
- Policy: Corrective justice (it's a wrong not to help); incentivize helping
- Line-drawing: Can create clear standard (must actually try to help, but off-hook if they resist)

**Arguments AGAINST duty** (Welch):
- No clear undertaking: Never said "designated driver"; "take care of her" ambiguous (could mean: give food, sit with her, catch vomit)
- Didn't create risk: Driver created risk by drinking; Welch was bystander
- Withholding benefit, not working injury (Moch framework)
- Policy: Will discourage people from EVER offering to be designated driver (floodgates of liability)
- Administrability: He-said-she-said; too many gradations (did they try hard enough?)
- Degrees of separation: Where does liability end?

**Professor's teaching points**:
- This is "appellate lawyering" — asking court to MAKE law, not apply it
- Requires BOTH traditional principles (undertaking, risk creation) AND pure policy
- Shows gray area where principles don't give clear answer
- Example of line-drawing in legal design

### Kuyler v. United States (Naval Hospital failure to report)

**Facts**: Higgs (babysitter) abused Norman family baby. Naval hospital suspected abuse but didn't report to Illinois DCFS hotline (required by ANCAA Act). Higgs went on to abuse and kill Kuyler family baby (different child). Kuyler family sued hospital.

**Holding**: No duty. Hospital didn't create risk. No special relationship with Kuyler family. Not Tarasoff situation.

**Duty analysis**:
- Hospital didn't create risk (Higgs created risk)
- No undertaking (didn't try to help Kuyler family)
- No special relationship (Kuyler baby not their patient; Norman baby WAS their patient, but that's different)
- Not Tarasoff: Higgs not their patient; Higgs didn't threaten anyone to them

**Statute analysis**:
- ANCAA Act = reporting statute (regulatory), NOT tort statute
- Doesn't create tort liability by itself
- Still need common law duty for tort claim
- Could use statutory standard for breach IF duty existed, but no duty here

**Tarasoff exception** (mentioned but doesn't apply):
- Psychiatrist/healthcare provider hears patient threaten specific victim
- Duty to warn/protect that victim (even though victim not provider's patient)
- OUTLIER — hasn't been extended beyond this narrow situation
- Requirements: (1) provider-patient relationship, (2) specific threat, (3) imminent harm
- Codified in many state statutes
- This case: Higgs not patient, no threat communicated

**Causation issue** (flagged for next week):
- Would reporting actually have saved Kuyler baby?
- Only one month between incidents
- Would hotline have investigated/stopped Higgs that quickly?

**Teaching points**:
- Shows statutory negligence requires BOTH statute AND common law duty
- Illustrates special relationship must be with the VICTIM
- Example of Tarasoff as outlier exception

### Ryobi Industries v. Hood (warning adequacy)

**Facts**: Hood bought Ryobi saw. Removed blade guard. Blade flew off saw and injured him (thumb, leg). Sued for inadequate warning.

**Warnings on saw/manual** (7+ warnings):
- "Keep guards in place"
- "Always use the saw blade guard"
- "Never operate with guard removed"
- "Use of saw without this guard will result in serious injury"
- Multiple locations (manual, stickers on saw itself)
- All caps, "WARNING," "DANGER"

**Holding**: Warnings adequate. No liability.

**Arguments FOR adequacy** (Ryobi):
- 7+ clear warnings in multiple locations
- All caps, prominent
- Industry custom: all saws have these warnings
- Low incident rate: thousands of saws sold, only ~2 incidents
- Warning clutter: listing every possible injury would make warnings useless
- **Policy**: Nobody reads fine print; too many warnings → ineffective

**Arguments AGAINST adequacy** (Hood):
- Warnings too generic: suggest danger = hand injury (expected danger)
- Actual danger = blade flying off (unexpected, unique to this saw design)
- Other saws don't have this danger (blade guard is structural component here)
- Short, specific warning would work: "blade may fly off" (4 words)
- Not asking for exhaustive list, just THIS specific danger
- Industry custom not enough if this saw uniquely dangerous

**Court's reasoning**:
- Warnings were adequate as-is
- Warning clutter is real concern
- Reasonable manufacturer did what Ryobi did

**Teaching point**:
- Once duty exists (manufacturer has duty to warn), standard negligence analysis
- Reasonable person standard, industry custom, BPL reasoning
- Warning effectiveness matters (thinking about user's brain)
- Sets up causation discussion (would specific warning have changed behavior?)

## 5. Flower Pot Hypos (Duty Analysis Practice)

### Framework: Where are you on the diagram?

- **Created risk** → RED (potential duty) → negligence analysis applies
- **Didn't create risk + didn't get involved** → GREEN (no duty) → no liability even if careless
- **Didn't create risk + undertook to help** → RED BUBBLE (affirmative duty) → must do it carefully
- **Didn't create risk + special relationship** → RED BUBBLE (affirmative duty)

### Hypo 1: Your pot, edge of window ledge, falls
- **You placed it there** → created risk → RED → duty exists
- Negligence analysis: was it reasonable to place it there?

### Hypo 2: Your pot, "safe" spot, months later falls
- **You placed it there** → created risk → RED → duty exists
- Negligence analysis: was the "safe" spot actually safe? Foreseeability?
- Could argue overlap between duty and breach (was it foreseeable?)

### Hypo 3: Your pot, slides over time, you watch it, it falls
- **You placed it initially** → created risk → RED
- **You watched it slide** → arguably creating NEW risk? Or failing to remove risk?
- Gray area: are you "involved" by watching and not acting?
- Professor: baseline shift? (knowing = involved?)

### Hypo 4: Neighbor's pot, edge, you see it, you do nothing
- **Neighbor placed it** → you didn't create risk → GREEN (if you don't act)
- No duty to move it
- Would be reasonable to move it (breach analysis if duty existed), but no duty

### Hypo 5: Neighbor's pot, edge, you move it to safe spot
- **You touched it** → created NEW risk? Or undertook to help?
- Could be RED (created new risk by moving it) OR RED BUBBLE (undertaking)
- If it falls later: did you create risk? Or did you undertake and fail?

### Hypo 6: Neighbor's pot, edge, you move it to SAME spot (edge)
- **You touched it** → RED (created new risky situation) AND/OR RED BUBBLE (bad undertaking)
- Even though it's same location, it's a new action
- You either created the risk OR undertook badly

### Hypo 7: You reach to catch falling pot (superpower: can catch with one finger), you use one finger, it falls
- **Undertaking** → RED BUBBLE
- But also: touching it at all = involved enough to be "creating" a situation?
- Blurry line between undertaking and active risk creation once you touch it

### Hypo 8: You reach to catch falling pot (two hands), then see bird, you stop, it falls
- **Did you undertake?** Maybe — you reached out
- **Or did you not complete the undertaking?** Didn't touch it
- **What more facts?** Did you see a person below? (Baseline shift: knowing = involved?)
- Gray area: motion to rescue vs. doing nothing

**Key teaching point**: Once you START to help (touch the thing, reach for it, say you'll help), it becomes much easier to characterize as undertaking → duty → potential liability. The line between "I was gonna help" and "I did help badly" is blurry.

## 6. Policy Arguments in Duty Cases

**(Use these when arguing for/against recognizing a new category of duty)**

### Arguments FOR liability (duty exists):

1. **Corrective justice**: Not helping when you easily could is a moral wrong → tort law should address
2. **Deterrence**: Holding people liable incentivizes helpful behavior
3. **Undertaking rationale**: If you say you'll help, others won't → you prevented alternative help
4. **Baseline shift**: Once you know someone's in danger, baseline should be "they're safe" → your inaction harms them
5. **Risk creation**: In some cases, offering to help actually CAUSED the dangerous situation (e.g., designated driver offer → person drinks more)
6. **Administrability**: Can craft clear, workable rule (e.g., must actually try to help, but off-hook if victim refuses)

### Arguments AGAINST liability (no duty):

1. **Floodgates**: Where does it end? Too many potential defendants (everyone who could have helped)
2. **Incentive effects**: Will discourage people from helping at all (fear of liability)
3. **Administrability**: Hard to prove, he-said-she-said, too many gradations
4. **Not manageable**: Can't find clear line for when duty kicks in
5. **Traditional principles**: Tort law has always drawn line at risk creation; don't extend
6. **Degrees of separation**: Liability too remote (many steps from defendant's action to victim's harm)
7. **Other mechanisms**: Criminal law, regulatory law, social norms handle this; don't need tort law
8. **Liberty/autonomy**: Tort law shouldn't force people to be Good Samaritans

### Professor's framing:
- "What's good for Hawaii?" — think about jurisdiction-specific policy
- Compare to what other states have done
- Think about who this helps/hurts, what incentives it creates
- Consider whether line is administrable, workable, clear

---

## 7. Connections & Themes

### A. Who Decides (Judge vs. Jury)

**Duty** = JUDGE decides (matter of law)
- Takes case away from jury entirely
- "No duty" = case dismissed before jury sees it

**Breach** = JURY decides (question of fact) [usually]
- Jury applies reasonable person standard to facts
- Judge can sometimes take this away too (JMOL)

**Proximate cause/scope of liability** = Can be EITHER
- Jury often makes this call (cutting off liability)
- Professor flagged: we'll see later that proximate cause looks a LOT like duty (both cut off liability for policy reasons)
- Question: is this redundant? Why judges sometimes, jury other times?

### B. Baselines (New Theme)

**Baseline = the reference point for whether action helps or harms**

- If baseline = person is safe → not helping = harming
- If baseline = person is in danger → not helping = just leaving them there

**Tort law's traditional baseline**: Status quo (person already in danger)
- Therefore: not helping ≠ harming → no duty

**But**: Baseline can shift based on:
- Knowledge (if you know they're in danger, does that shift baseline?)
- Relationships (if you're parent/caregiver, baseline = you'll protect them)
- Undertaking (if you said you'd help, baseline = you'll help)

**Professor**: "Baselines are a deep moral assumption embedded in tort law"
- Equal weighting of everyone's interests (BPL context)
- Here: choosing not to require helping = choosing a baseline

### C. Legal Design

**Duty questions are line-drawing exercises**:
- Where do you draw the line between duty and no duty?
- Can move the line, change the framework
- Requires thinking about: workability, administrability, clarity, incentive effects

**Judges making common law**:
- These are OPEN questions → judges MAKE law, not just apply it
- Appellate lawyering = asking court to make law in your favor
- Use both: (1) traditional principles, (2) pure policy arguments

### D. Rules vs. Standards

**Duty** = more RULE-like (categorical)
- Judge creates categories: "designated drivers have duty" or "designated drivers don't have duty"
- Applies to everyone in that category

**Breach** = STANDARD (reasonable person)
- Flexible, context-dependent
- Jury applies to specific facts

**Gray area**: Can build standards into duty analysis (e.g., "duty exists IF defendant actually tried to help but victim refused")

---

## 8. Exam Strategies & Checklists

### Duty Analysis Checklist:

1. **Identify the parties**: Who's the defendant? Who's the victim?

2. **Did defendant CREATE THE RISK?**
   - YES → go to negligence analysis (duty exists)
   - NO → go to #3

3. **Did defendant UNDERTAKE to help?**
   - Did they say they'd help?
   - Did they start to help?
   - Did they touch the thing?
   - "Hand set to the task"?
   - If YES → affirmative duty (must do it carefully)
   - If NO → go to #4

4. **Is there a SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP?**
   - Parent-child, doctor-patient, caregiver-dependent?
   - Must be with the VICTIM (not someone else)
   - Narrow category
   - If YES → affirmative duty
   - If NO → likely no duty

5. **Is this a STATUTE case?**
   - Is the statute a TORT statute (creates tort liability)? → use it
   - Or just regulatory (like reporting requirement)? → still need common law duty first

6. **ARGUE BOTH WAYS in gray areas**:
   - Use facts to argue they did/didn't create risk
   - Use facts to argue they did/didn't undertake
   - Baseline arguments (knowing = involved?)
   - Policy arguments (both directions)

### Writing the Duty Analysis:

**If arguing DUTY EXISTS**:
1. "Defendant had a duty because [created risk / undertook / special relationship]"
2. Facts supporting: [be specific]
3. Traditional principle: [cite Moch language if helpful]
4. Policy: [corrective justice, deterrence, undertaking rationale]
5. Address counterarguments: [floodgates, administrability] → respond

**If arguing NO DUTY**:
1. "Defendant had no duty because [didn't create risk, didn't undertake, no special relationship]"
2. Facts supporting: [be specific]
3. Traditional principle: "merely withheld a benefit" / "refusal to become instrument for good"
4. Policy: [floodgates, incentive effects, degrees of separation]
5. Address counterarguments: [corrective justice, could have easily helped] → respond

**Once duty is established**: Revert to standard negligence analysis (reasonable person, BPL, industry custom, facts-based aunt-and-uncle arguments)

---

## 9. Open Questions & Follow-Up

1. **Causation in Kuyler**: Would reporting have actually saved the baby? (Only one month between incidents — would investigation have stopped Higgs in time?)

2. **Proximate cause vs. Duty**: Professor flagged that we'll see proximate cause later, and it does similar work (cutting off liability for policy reasons). Why the redundancy? When does judge do it (duty) vs. jury do it (proximate cause)?

3. **Moch outcome**: Why did Cardozo say no duty when water company clearly undertook (contract) and clearly failed? Does this make sense? Or is Moch just wrong on its own facts?

4. **Tarasoff boundaries**: How far does Tarasoff extend? What counts as "specific threat"? "Imminent harm"? Which healthcare providers does it apply to?

5. **Sabatino outcome**: How did Hawaii Supreme Court actually rule? (We didn't get the holding in class)

6. **Warning causation**: In Ryobi, even if warning was inadequate, would a better warning have changed Hood's behavior? (Sets up causation discussion next week)

7. **Baselines in practice**: How do we actually apply baseline arguments in real cases? Is this just a framing device, or does it have doctrinal teeth?

---

## 10. Vocabulary & Key Phrases

- **Duty**: Threshold question (judge decides) about whether defendant involved enough for tort law to apply
- **No duty**: Judge's determination that tort law doesn't apply; case dismissed as matter of law
- **Misfeasance vs. nonfeasance**: Act vs. omission (Cardozo says this is misleading distinction)
- **Launching a force or instrument of harm**: Creating risk (Cardozo language) → potential duty
- **Withholding a benefit** / "refusal to become an instrument for good": Not helping (Cardozo language) → no duty
- **Working an injury vs. withholding a benefit**: Core distinction in duty analysis
- **Affirmative duty**: Duty that exists even though defendant didn't create risk (undertaking or special relationship)
- **Undertaking**: Voluntarily beginning to help → creates duty to do it carefully
- **"Hand set to the task"**: If you start helping, you must finish carefully (can't stop negligently)
- **Special relationship**: Pre-existing caretaking/dependency relationship → creates duty (parent-child, doctor-patient)
- **Tarasoff duty**: Outlier exception — psychiatrist's duty to warn third-party victim of patient's threats
- **Baseline**: Reference point for determining whether action helps or harms
- **Warning clutter**: Too many warnings → counterproductive (nobody reads)
- **Appellate lawyering**: Asking appeals court to MAKE law (not just apply existing law)
- **Legal design**: Thinking about how to structure rules/doctrines (line-drawing, administrability, incentive effects)
- **Floodgates argument**: Recognizing duty here would open up too much liability
- **Degrees of separation**: Liability too remote from defendant's action
- **Administrability**: Whether a legal rule is workable, manageable, clear in practice

---

## 11. Takeaways for Exam

1. **Duty is a GATE**: Always start with duty. If no duty, doesn't matter how negligent they were. Judge takes it away before jury sees it.

2. **Duty analysis is BINARY**: Either duty exists (→ go to negligence analysis) or it doesn't (→ done, no liability). But getting to that binary answer requires nuanced argument in gray areas.

3. **The RED/GREEN/RED BUBBLE diagram is your friend**: 
   - Created risk? → RED → duty → negligence analysis
   - Didn't create risk, didn't help? → GREEN → no duty
   - Didn't create risk, but undertook or special relationship? → RED BUBBLE → duty

4. **Always argue both ways in gray areas**: Exam will likely give you edge cases. Use facts to argue both directions. Make it about the facts.

5. **Traditional principles + Policy arguments**: Duty questions need BOTH. Use Cardozo language ("launching force or instrument of harm" vs. "withholding benefit"), but ALSO make policy arguments (floodgates, incentives, administrability, corrective justice).

6. **Undertaking = started helping**: Once you touch it, say you'll do it, reach for it → much easier to characterize as undertaking → duty. The line is blurry, but "starting" is key.

7. **Special relationships are NARROW**: Parent-child, doctor-patient, caregiver-dependent. Must be caretaking/dependency. Must be with VICTIM. Don't assume it exists.

8. **Statutes need common law duty**: Unless statute is a tort statute (creates tort liability itself), you still need common law duty first. Statute can provide standard for breach, but only if duty exists.

9. **Once duty exists, back to negligence**: Reasonable person, BPL, industry custom, facts-based aunt-and-uncle arguments. All the tools from Classes 1-4 apply.

10. **Baselines are powerful but slippery**: Use carefully. Argument = "once you know X, baseline shifts, so not acting = harming." But be ready to defend where you put the baseline.

---

## 12. Questions to Think About

1. If undertaking creates duty, and duty means potential liability, why would anyone ever help? How does tort law deal with this perverse incentive?

2. Is there a meaningful difference between "creating a risk" and "failing to remove a risk you're aware of"? Where's the line?

3. Should tort law recognize a general duty to rescue in easy cases (minimal burden, great benefit)? Why or why not?

4. Is the duty/proximate-cause redundancy a feature or a bug? Does it make sense to have both judge (duty) and jury (proximate cause) potentially cutting off liability for similar reasons?

5. How would you craft a "designated driver" rule for Hawaii? What would the standard be? What facts would trigger duty?

6. Is Moch correctly decided? Should water company have duty given they contracted and undertook to provide water?

7. How far should Tarasoff extend? Should it apply beyond psychiatrists? Beyond specific threats?

---

## 13. Connections to Other Classes

- **Contracts** (Deals): Moch has contract claim alongside tort claim; different duties/remedies
- **Constitutional Law**: Liberty arguments against forced helping (autonomy, state coercion)
- **Criminal Law**: Act vs. omission (more important there than in torts); duty to rescue in some criminal contexts
