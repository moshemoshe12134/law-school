OK, welcome back.

SPEAKER 0
OK, yeah, yeah, you, you'd you like it.

SPEAKER 1
Nice to see you. Good morning. Good morning. Let's settle in with a few breaths like usual. Relaxing your eyes or closing your eyes. Letting yourself be still. Breathing in. Taking your time Breathing out just as slowly. Again, Settling into your chair. Leaving the outside out. Being here, breathe out. Once more at your own place. Taking it gently. When you're ready. Open your eyes. work up here All right. As you know, where are we in this course we're starting a new section of the course. This is a section called causation. I'll explain what all fits into that category within tort law in just a second. But For the Change of scene as we get into this section. And then the change is seen as we get out of this mini section, the first part of causation. Let me just preface by saying that there is going to be a sudden shift from the common sense aunt and uncle fact-based style argumentation that we've been doing all until now, even with the structure and the kids and BPL and everything, a shift towards something that's really kind of more of a logics puzzle. Not to bring that back, but It will seem more analytical. And what I want you to be thinking about as we get into this more, you know, analytical bit just for a couple of days here. Is to recognize that really what's happening is that tort law is still trying to approximate our intuitions. We kind of all know what it means for something to cause something. We may mean different things by that in different contexts. We may say this causes that or this causes that and mean completely different things, but we have our own gut intuition about what that is. And what we'll see in the next couple of weeks, but especially starting today with this stuff, the causation in fact section, mini section. Is that tort law is trying to approximate our intuitions but not doing great at it. Because it's really hard. I mean philosophers have puzzled about this for a long time, it's really hard to, Just crystallize what it means to have something cause something else, and every discipline in the social sciences has a slightly different view. So there's a lot of contestation here and what we see is tort law trying to make it practical, trying to make it work in a judicial setting. So that's what I'm hoping you'll think about, not that these are somehow deep philosophical truths, but just a way of tort law structuring itself. To more or less get at what we think of when we say A has caused B and in particular, remember what we're doing with tort law we're saying that someone's responsible, someone needs to pay, we're moving money around, so what we're working with is tort law trying to approximate our intuitions somehow for saying that your misbehavior, your carelessness caused the injury in a close enough sense you caused it enough really. To have to pay for part of it or all of it, and that's what we're really doing here. So. Just to make that a little bit more. In the language, the tort law. It's a lot of introduction today just to set the scene for us, but remember how we've been talking about, well, there, you know, people say there's 44 components of tort. One is duty and then breach. You breach the duty, and we've talked about that as breaching the duty of not being negligent. We talked a little bit about when you don't have a duty, when judges are gonna say it's not your problem, remember that. So up until now we've been dealing with 1 and 2, and now we're moving to 3 and 4. We're going to dwell on 3. We're not going to worry too much about 4 for now. We'll get to that when we get to remedies, but you already see 4 showing up in Matsuyama. The idea that the harm that is caused is really what we're talking about when we're talking about causation, and maybe there's even a way to merge those ideas. OK, so we'll get to that very, very shortly, but just to give you a sense of where we're coming from. This idea of causing harm then is broken down in common law torts into two buckets really. One is the causation of fact or factual causation bucket. There's other words for it, but don't get confused. Judges are using all kinds of words to describe these things. We will just call it causation in fact or factual causation. That's today and a little bit on Wednesday. And then next week. We'll get to the other component which is the more mysterious, arbitrary argument-based component, less analytical, more mushy component called proximate cause traditionally, or in modern language scope of liability. That's gonna look very, very different. I separate these not just because doctrine separates them, but because the type of analysis we'll be using in each of these sections, causation and fact, and then proximate cause scope of liability is going to be very, very different infield. The logic puzzles part is today and a little bit of Wednesday, and then once we get to proximate cause and scope of liability, we're back to mush. It'll feel a lot like the duty conversation we already had, where judges are saying it's not your problem. For whatever reason, Except that with proximate cause and scope of liability, the jury, aunt and uncle are the ones who will make that call, saying, eh, it's not your problem, we'll let you off the hook. OK, so you can already imagine how wide open policy-based, mushy, discretionary that's gonna be. That's next week. This week will be causation in facts, a little more chop chop, here's the analytics, here's where the logic fails, here's how we deal with it, and so on. All right. One way to think about the function of each of these, just again to set the backdrop for this. Is to think about you have a tort like remember the bar G. Wasn't there that day, boat sinks, but then there's all these other people involved who are maybe doing negligent things too. Right, tying up the boat and not tying it and then pushing it around and so on. There's all kinds of parties potentially who could be liable because they were all At fault in some way, and up until now we've been talking about negligence. Let's say they're all negligent. Well, OK. The next step is to decide who among these negligent parties, or just anyone who's involved really. Did something that can meaningfully be said to have caused or contributed to the cause of the accident. In a real way And so the causation in fact. Analysis that we'll be doing today and. Partly on Wednesday. You can think of us sweeping in all the potentially viable fish, RG, the Graceline people, the railroad people, the whoever, the whoever, people at the next pier, whoever, sweep them all in. And the idea is that if they did something. That mattered for the outcome, it affected the outcome, we're going to just sweep them in. The idea here is if you made a difference to the outcome, we're sweeping you in, you're potentially liable if you were negligent or breached some other duty. And then next week's topic, this idea of proximate cause scope of liability is asking the jury, aunt and uncle to say, who do you kick out? Who do you let off the hook, let out of the fishing net, I guess, in this case. You're throwing out the potential liable parties and then whoever you're left with, they're the ones who will have to pay something. It could be the barge himself, it could be his company themselves, it could be the other people, but We're sweeping in right now as many people as we can using this chronological idea of making a difference and then next week we're gonna throw them out just based on like common sense, arbitrariness, policy reasons, whatever. So if it helps you think of this week's topic, causation in fact, as being a little bit overinclusive in a way. We'll also see how it's under-inclusive, but we'll get to that. But it's really trying to get people rounded up who could potentially have to pay, potential liable parties and then. The fish are released by the jury under proximate cause scope of liability. So one way the tort law will talk about it is to say there's two stages in the analysis. First, you ask if a potentially liable party was a cause in fact, or more precisely, was there negligent behavior? Was there tortious conduct, let's call it tortious conduct. Which up until now is just negligence for us. Was our tortious conduct a factual cause of the injury? And then we ask, yeah, but it was an approximate cause slash within the scope of liability. That's how the tort language is gonna work for our course. In your materials again the verbs are gonna be kind of fluid. Different judges use different phrases. Different jurisdictions have a tradition of using different phrases. You will see other things at work, but we're gonna stick with these particular phrases cause in fact or factual cause, proximate cause, or scope of liability. OK. And so what are we doing today? We're taking the left side, we're just doing the left side. And today we're going to cover two primary. Doctrinal analytical tools that tort law. At least in the restatement, emphasizes as ways to say that someone is a cause in fact. And as you know, of course already they are but-for causation, right? Did you make a difference? And then multiple sufficient causes, which is a way of catching a particular configuration of facts where The first part, part 4 causation, fails, just logically. It doesn't cover it. It's just underinclusive. So really the bulk of what we'll be doing is but for causation, but then there will be. Some attention to the stopgap doctrine called multiple sufficient causes, and we'll practice with both of these. To just give you a sense again where we are, we're working on the two doctrinal ways of finding someone to be a cause in fact for our purposes, and that's gonna be the first part in a large two-stage. causation analysis. OK, I know there's a lot of outlining just now, but we will get into each of these pieces and we'll practice with them and they'll become all much more clear as we get into it. So let's get our heads around the basic concept that we're gonna start with the restatement rather than Matsuyama. We'll get to Matsuyama probably in the 2nd half. But let's start with the restatement. Laura Wernick Henry Leea Hi Is that right, Leera? Yeah, that's right. Great. Will you just look at the restatement. Definition of but for cause we're looking at section 26, Section 27. Do you have that in front of you. Great, just read it for us. Just read 26, read 27, and then we're not gonna read the other part. All right, 20 Section 26 factual cause torturous conduct must be a factual cause of harm for liability to be imposed. Conduct is a factual cause of harm when the harm would not have occurred absent the conduct. Torturous. OK, go ahead, keep going. Go ahead, keep going. Yep. All right. Torturous conduct may also be factual cause of harm under Section 27. OK, great. Here we're talking about the statement section 26. Mhm. And you want to read section 27 for us now? Yeah, sure. If multiple acts occur, each of which under section 26 alone would have been a factual cause of physical harm, at the same time, in the absence of the other acts, each act is regarded as a factual cause of the harm. OK. We'll come back to what section 27 is all about later on today, but we're gonna primarily work with Section 26's definition of what it means to have a but-for cause, OK. Before we get to that, I want to point out the thing that's in italics which we're not going to use, which is the substantial factor language. You'll see this in opinions sometimes it's kind of older language for how to do factual causation. Some jurisdictions maybe still talk about it, but we're not gonna worry about it. We're not really sure what it means, as you saw in Abraham, nobody knows what it means. So instead we're gonna work with. The third restatement and disregard the old second restatement language that I've put in italics on this page. We're gonna use 26 and 27 and not the italics stuff. So, Henry, so, um, in your own words, how do we understand section 26? But for causation here. It doesn't actually use the phrase but for causation, but how, how, um, how's it linked up? What, how would you explain it in your own words?

SPEAKER 2
Yeah, I guess it's kind of asking, you know, if the action hadn't occurred, would the damage still have happened, um.

SPEAKER 1
Say again, if, if.

SPEAKER 2
If the act, the torturous act, tortious conduct, yes, a

SPEAKER 1
negligent behavior, right? Yeah, if it had not happened, right, would the damage have happened or occurred? And what turns on that, yes or no? If the answer is yes, then then what, what would we say? And if the answer is no, then what would we say? If it's yes, then there's no liability. If yes, there's no liability. So if the conduct had not happened and yet the injury would still have happened. There's no liability, is that what you're, that's how you interpret it? Yeah, yeah. So if you think of it as a way of letting someone out of the net. Look, if the injury would have happened anyway, if your conduct, your tortious conduct. Right, you can think of it as a negligent part of your overall behavior, your failure to take a certain precaution is how we talked about it. Didn't make a difference to the outcome because it would have happened anyway. Then it doesn't matter that you were negligent. OK. Think about how powerful that is as a way of letting someone off the hook. What they have to show is that the conduct would have the conduct didn't matter for the outcome. The the injury would have happened. The barge would have sunk anyway. Little Leo would have electrocuted himself anyway. The swimmer would have hit his head anyway, even if there were a sign, even if. The barg were there even if like Henry, is that how you understand it? Yeah, OK. And so what if the answer is no? The answer is no. The answer is, well, actually no, if it weren't for your tors conduct or negligent behavior, then there wouldn't have been. An injury or as severe of an injury or. Yeah, I think then that's when we would move on to the proximate cause analysis, yeah. That's when we say you are still potentially on the hook, right? First step in showing that you are potentially on the hook is that you are breached some duty, you were negligent in some way, and you know it's not one of these no duty situations where it's not your problem, right, where those are kind of exceptional cases. That's the first part we've been doing that for the first few days. Now we're talking about first mini step causation is causation in fact. The idea is, did whatever you did over there make a difference to the outcome, in particular to the injury. If no, then it doesn't matter, you were careless. It didn't matter for the outcome. If yes, then you're potentially on the hook. And as Henry says, then we move on to throwing the fish out of the net analysis from next week, OK? So right now we're just working with this simple device, the simple device with tort law called but-for causation, and the reason it's called but-for causation is because in old-timey language you would say, but for your tortious conduct, the behavior, the result would have happened or would not have happened. Right, so but for da da da da, if you're not, if it weren't for the blah blah blah that you did. That's what the but for phrase means. OK, great. So, um, In a way, what we're talking about here is If these pictures help, You can think of causation in fact as a part of the tort doctrine analysis, making a tort case analysis that is asking. Are you responsible for some of that gap between being safe and being injured? One way of thinking about it, OK, I drew it up there like that. It doesn't really help you think of it that way, that's OK, but remember the question is, what difference did it make? Did you make a difference? And Henry, just again, we've been already been talking about this, but in the case of the flower pots, right? How will we, how do we talk about it in the case of the flower pots? If you hadn't put the flower pot on the edge, would it still have fallen down and, you know, hurt someone? Yeah, that's it. If you hadn't put the flower pot there, wherever you put it, right. It could be a negligent place, it could be a safe place, it could be, you know, would it still have Blown over and hit someone on the head, that's the analysis. That's it. That's all we're asking. Are you responsible for the difference between safe and injured? It's that gap that we're talking about. So let's practice, of course, let's practice a little bit. Joshua Y Will you take the example of little Leo remember little Leo? And we're gonna think about Just making arguments. For and against causation in fact based on but-for causation based on section 26 of the restatement third. How would you make an argument saying that? The failure to take a particular precaution here we can talk about the fence being the precaution, OK, let's say there was not a fence, but maybe there could have been a fence. Remember how you make the negligence argument, you take a precaution, you say you should have done it because it was really easy to do, it would have done a lot of good. We've already been thinking about that, right? We've already been thinking about it would do a lot of good, right? So that's, that's kind of embedded in the negligence argumentation. So we're using the same ideas, same facts, same everything, and just now moving on to the second doctrinal component which is to say. Oh, and in this case it actually would have made a difference, or in this case it would not have made a difference. How would you make that argument?

SPEAKER 2
Yeah, so I'll start off by saying that it would have made a difference by saying that by omitting the fence or by omitting any other type of protection. Um, let's stick with the fence for now, but we

SPEAKER 1
can do in a 2nd. 01 other time.

SPEAKER 2
So by omitting the fence, uh, it caused harm that would not have occurred if. The railroad company didn't omit the fence. Therefore, it falls under but for causation under Section 26.

SPEAKER 1
OK. And what kind of facts would you want to know? How would you convince aunt and uncle that this is true?

SPEAKER 2
Um, I would say, well, I think some facts that I would look for are whether or not The company internally discussed the fence, um, and how much offense would cost and how often kids. I guess Play around that area. OK, let's take each of those.

SPEAKER 1
Did they talk about it? How much would it cost? Do kids play around here? How would any of these facts be used to make the case that, first of all, which side are you arguing for right now?

SPEAKER 2
I'm arguing that, um, the company is negligent.

SPEAKER 1
OK, so let's say that we have already worked out our arguments on negligence. We're not just arguing about causation in fact. OK. Oh yes. So let's say we're arguing about causation in fact. We're saying the company should have taken offense, put up an offense. They should have taken that precaution. Not only because it was a reasonable thing to do, but also because it would have Cause Lela Rio not to be injured. The absence of the fence is what caused him to be injured. You can think of it the other way. And this part saying that it made a difference not to have a fence there. How would you make that argument and what kinds of facts would you wanna use?

SPEAKER 2
Hmm For me, it's kind of difficult just because it's about a mission rather than commission. I think, um, in terms of facts that I would want, no offense there. I mean, I think I would look to similar. Other locations within the area where there are fences and then look to the injury rate of people there.

SPEAKER 1
Sure, this is how we figure out if a drug works. You take the drug, a bunch of people take the drug, a bunch of people don't take the drug. Let's see if there's any difference in results. That's how we know if a drug causes good benefits or causes side effects or whatever. You look at other places and you say, hey, look, no kids electrocute themselves over there where there are fences. OK, that's one fact you could probably bring in again, you're trying to convince aunt and uncle that it makes sense to say that having a fence or not having a fence would have made a difference in this case. What other facts?

SPEAKER 2
Hm Um. I think I would try and see if uh. Whether or not building a fence in that area is possible, maybe there's like some. Circumstance specifically surrounding. I guess The bridge that just wouldn't allow a fence to be built. I don't know, it's OK, so let's talk about that

SPEAKER 1
for a second. This is a little bit like how much would it cost? Yeah, we've worked with that before in a negligence analysis. Look, BPO has to do with costs, also just the reasonableness of it has to do with costs. Cardozo's original, you know, rhetorical argument in Little Leo cases, so you can't bury the wire, that's impossible, that's too costly, right? Implicitly. Does it come into the causation of fact analysis? How would you use that set of arguments saying, oh it's really hard to do this? I think part of showing that it would have made a difference or not, can you not to, I mean,

SPEAKER 2
I think that's more so for the company's defense because I think the company would probably invoke the same argument that Cardozo made in.

SPEAKER 1
Sure they would use that to argue against their own negligence. They're saying like no reasonable trolley company would do that. Too expensive, crazy, not useful, blah blah. But, what? What are we arguing here? We're arguing if you were arguing against causation of fact for the company, your trolley company's side now, you're their lawyers saying I need to make the case that the fence would not have made a difference. They're saying we should have put up a fence. Maybe we should have, but it didn't matter. It wouldn't have made a difference, so we're not responsible for his injury just because we didn't put up a fence. How would you make that argument on behalf of the trolley company saying it didn't make a difference? It would not have made a difference.

SPEAKER 2
I would say on behalf of the company that. They did not cause the injury and it would not have made a difference because. It kind of seems like little Leo was determined whether or not there was a fence to hit the wire.

SPEAKER 1
Something like that, and what kind of facts would you want to know about little Leo?

SPEAKER 2
Um, how often does he go to the junkyard and look for Dangerous items.

SPEAKER 1
He's walking around with a wire all day long. Every day he's got a new wire. Sometimes they're Uh, no, 6 ft long. OK, the wire in this particular case was 8 ft long. Sometimes he has one that's the maximum here is like 10 ft long. Yeah 15 ft long. That's what little Leo does. Remember this is his reason to be. This is a raison d'etre. This is the whole meaning of his life comes from. Throwing wires around and sometimes they're long enough where like if he had a fence and he climbs to the top of the fence, what happens?

SPEAKER 2
He can just whip the wire around anyways.

SPEAKER 1
He could still reach the electrified wire if that's what he wanted to do. He knows how to get a wire that's long enough you can't stop this kid he's unstoppable. The determination of a 12 year old with a wire. Come on, a fence? Have you never been 12, aunt and uncle? You know how to get around a fence. Right, that's the kind of argumentation you would want to make, right? So what are you doing exactly Joshua, when you're, when you're arguing that this is what would have happened in that alternate universe where there were offense. This is what you've been doing it, right? On one side you're saying, hey, look, if there were offense then he would not have hurt himself and the other side you're saying if there were offense, he still would have hurt himself. Are you talking about what a reality? Are you talking about an alternate universe, some counterfactual that we don't know, or something that we can prove, or what is it?

SPEAKER 2
I think it's more so just like And intuitive. Uh, not fairy tale, an intuitive hypothetical. Yes, yeah, you're inventing a hypothetical.

SPEAKER 1
You might call it a counterfactual. You're inventing a counterfactual for aunt and uncle. You're trying to get the jury to imagine what would have happened with the fence. And if you're on the side of little Leo where you're trying to show causation in fact from not having a fence, then you're trying to make that universe, the alternate universe, the counterfactual universe which we don't know, no one has access to that possible universe. OK It's not a Marvel movie. Then you're trying to make that alternate universe look better or worse than what actually happened to little Leo. If you're If you're trying to argue that there was causation of fact, that it did make a difference, you're saying that the alternate universe is better or worse or the same.

SPEAKER 2
Um, I guess it would depend on which side. So if I was arguing that, uh, the fence would have made a difference, I would be arguing that the alternate universe would have been better just because obviously he would not have been electrocuted and then the opposite for the other side.

SPEAKER 1
Sure. Of course, this is what you're going for. You're trying to show that gap. Alternate universe is that he would have been safe and look at the reality, reality is that he's injured, causation in fact. Based on that fence, OK? And then on the other side, Joshua, you're trying to argue what, that the alternate universe looks good, looks bad.

SPEAKER 2
I think I would say that it's either equal or worse just to show that the fence would not have made a difference and that there's therefore no causation.

SPEAKER 1
Sure, you're trying to show that in the alternate universe there's no difference. He would have been injured anyway. Just remember, it may be a little counterintuitive, I mean it makes sense as we say it, but it may be a little counterintuitive that you're trying to convince aunt and uncle, if you're trying to show liability, that that alternate universe is great. Trying to show that this harm is not in that alternate universe. And then the opposite if you're arguing against causation in fact, injured, injured anyway. Still injured, you would still have been injured. That's what you're doing. There's no difference here. Made no difference. Made no difference. OK. Let's try this with a different precaution. Charlie Ma. And picking other precaution, you know, we know the little Leo story very well. Any number of precautions may have been helpful. Again, we're talking about. Having established negligence here. But we can talk about anybody's behavior here. We can talk about little Leo's own negligent behavior. We can talk about trolley company's negligent behavior. Pick anybody who could have been more careful. Pick a specific precaution, and let's just practice a little bit more with this logic. Um, Maybe like the trolley company could have like insulated the wire. Great. All right, so a little more insulation on the wire, yeah, right? We know there was some insulation. You could have just extended the insulation. Let's say that would have been easy to do. Any reasonable company would do it. All kinds of other companies do it, plenty of custom, however you want to make the negligence argument. Let's say that the aunt and uncle are pretty convinced that this was negligent, not to extend the insulation just a little bit past the bridge. Like why wouldn't you extend it past the bridge? Like it costs you nothing. Totally helpful. As part of the negligence analysis, again, remember you're saying that this is a useful precaution and now we actually have to convince aunt and uncle that this precaution would in fact in this case have made a difference. So what are we talking about here? What kinds of facts would you want to know? To make the case for or against this precaution, making a difference or not making a difference, being a cause in fact or not being a cause in fact, um. I guess like you probably have to know if the insulation is guaranteed to to like not have the electricity pass through if the wire came in contact with it but if it did, sure. You need to know something about the electrical properties of that insulation. That insulation is just to keep the rain off, but it doesn't keep the electricity from arcing and jumping over to, you know, little Leo's wire. Well, what's the point? Why is that a precaution we need to talk about? Why is it negligent to have not put that precaution there? If literally he's dangling this thing over and doesn't quite touch the wire, but the electricity can jump over and get him anyway, the insulation wasn't there to deal with this. What, that's a useless insulation, sure, right. Again, you see how the same kind of facts, same kind of argumentation that this thing is useless, plays into both the negligence analysis because what's the point of a negligent. Analysis that doesn't consider that this is useless, right? It's not reasonable to put in a useless precaution, but it also comes into play. In here in the causation of fact analysis, sure, so just put it in tort law language. You can use the restatement language, you can say but for, you know, the lack of extra insulation, here's what would have happened. Just to practice using the language. OK, um. But for the trolley company not insulating the wires under the bridge, little Leo would not have been injured. Sure. And whose argument is that, Leo's or theirs? Uh, Leo, Leo's, sure, you're trying to show causation in fact from not taking this precaution, great. And then on their side, but for what? Uh, Uh. Sorry, on, on, on, on, uh, on the side, but for our own failure to take this precaution, what? Uh, it's a weird syntax, but work it out, you know, let's let's walk through the talks about it. Leo would still have been injured, yes. It's really weird to say it this way, but that's exactly right. But for our failure to take this precaution, guess what, he still would have been injured, doesn't matter. We didn't do anything that mattered to this, yeah, we, you know, made stupid decisions but didn't matter for him. Now what's interesting is think about I've been saying look we're using the same idea he would still have been injured or the precaution would have not been useful in both the negligence analysis and in the causation of fact analysis, but they work a little bit differently. Right. Charlie, so. In the negligence analysis. We're talking about a reasonable trolley company, we know that. Imagining what good a precaution would do, which is taking that extra. Insulation as you described it. And as they imagine this. Are we saying to aunt and Knuckle they should have imagined exactly little Leo and little Leo's brain and how he operates, or are we talking about something more generic than that? Uh, something more generic, generic, right? And it's not like we're imagining a reasonable little Leo, that's not the analysis here. We're saying trolley company, as you think about all the possible things that might happen if you don't put up some insulation. Think about all the things. It could be this kid, it could be that kid, it could be, you know, we don't know the exact kids, but there's kids running around. They're not reasonable kids. It's not a reasonable child you're imagining here in this analysis for the trolley company. You're just saying, hey, look, as you look out at the reality and you make your decisions in a reasonable way, imagine what might happen. OK. But then when we get to the causation analysis, What are we saying? We're saying something more precise, right? What are we, what are we actually saying? The trolley company is saying. If we had not taken, if we had taken this precaution. Some generic kid might show up and still electrocute himself or what? Something different than that. Like only the, only the plaintiff himself. Yes. Little Leo, we're talking about little Leo would have done it. And what kinds of facts we want to know about little Leo. Like if he has a history of just being a bit uh reckless, like even for a kid his age, like not listening to the teacher at school or liking to get into trouble and stuff, yeah, all kinds of stuff that's all like about little Leo, we haven't gotten into anyone's subjective brain yet until just now. When you're doing the causation of fact analysis, you're asking about what this little particular kid would have done, and you're bringing in the facts like Joseph brought in Joshua, sorry, Joshua brought in about like there's wires all around, he loves playing with wires, you're bringing in facts about oh he's super reckless, he just loves trying to like electrocute himself, stuff like that. And then if you're on the other side of your little Leo's side, you would say, you, what kind of facts would you want to have? Um, I guess for little Leo you could show that he's like a pretty, he's like just averagely well behaved and he's just kind of like, or you can even show that he's actually like quite like a careful kid, yeah, he's super careful around electricity. He does science experiments with electricity. He's super careful. He knows how it works. He's gotten shocked before. He doesn't like it. No way he would go and like try to climb over a fence or like get around the insulation and so he knows that it could arc from the wire to his wire like he knows, right, all these things he wouldn't have. OK. And it sounds like we're evaluating his behavior, his carefulness, his character, and so on. But are these arguments we're making with respect to. His negligence right now or what are we using these facts for that you and Joshua have brought up? What are we using these facts for evaluating what precisely? A causasian for whom? For whose behavior? For, for, for Leo's behavior. 00, for the trolleys, trolley company's behavior, exactly. Think about how much argumentation about little Leo, this particular kid, which is not the reasonable little kid, but little Leo himself in his brain subjectively, think about how that matters for making the argument about causation in fact for the trolley company's negligence. Not for little Leo's negligence, not for the trolley company's negligence, but for their argumentation about causalization in fact. OK, so just keeping that clear. Right. Let's practice, um, a little bit more now that we have a little, you know, this particular framework in mind, keeping track of what arguments are being made for negligence, what arguments are being made for causation in fact, how they're a little bit same, a little bit different, and let's try a few. So let's all try out the swimmer case, remember the swimmer case? Why don't you discuss with your neighbors for a few minutes? We'll think about the swimmer case, pick any precaution you want by any of the parties involved, and then we're gonna make causation of fact arguments. And of course we're gonna be asking what kinds of facts would you want to know because we don't have necessarily lots of facts. So think about that for a couple of minutes and then I'll call on more goldfinches.

SPEAKER 0
There. Yeah. Like. OK, one minute, one minute. Yeah OK, let's start to wrap up.

SPEAKER 1
Let's wrap up.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah OK, let's see what you've come up with.

SPEAKER 1
Camille Nera, is that right? Is an error, uh, yeah, era, it's either way it's good. OK. All right, your team, what have you come up with?

SPEAKER 3
OK, so we talked about there being a sign there, um, so we said. Like if there was a sign there, then he wouldn't have potentially gotten hurt on the dock. So like, yeah, right where they were jumping off.

SPEAKER 1
OK, warning sign. And You know how to make arguments about the negligence of who whose negligence are we assuming here?

SPEAKER 3
We're assuming the park's negligence. Parks should have put up a sign.

SPEAKER 1
Negligent not to do so. Next piece of analysis is, would the sign have made a difference, causation and fact? How would you make those arguments and what kind of facts would you want on either side? So that one, I think the the park has a

SPEAKER 3
weaker argument for sure because obviously we knew that the. They were cautious about it in the first place, so they probably would have really considered a sign. Um, maybe we talked about like what kind of, how

SPEAKER 1
does that factor into it would have made a difference or it wouldn't have made a difference if they would

SPEAKER 3
have stopped and considered the sign, it would have made a difference, so that would be good for the plaintiff side. OK, so you're saying that they were negligent for not

SPEAKER 1
having considered putting up a sign because then they would have put up a sign. OK, but how would the sign have made a difference? How would considering a sign, therefore having a sign, how would all of that as a precaution have made a difference? What kinds of facts would you wanna know?

SPEAKER 3
Um, So we would want to know if the sign would have stopped them from diving in and hurting themselves. So, um, I guess maybe you'd want to know like if in the past, the frat boys have red signs and it prevented them from jumping in, maybe even if, maybe on the defense side, even if there was a no diving sign, um, It's still. Couldn't like uh consistently tell you the depth of the water, um, so maybe that actually wouldn't have prevented someone from still jumping in and potentially getting hurt.

SPEAKER 1
OK, so two things here, one on each side of the argument. On the argument saying that this would have made a difference, you want to show again like we're getting into little Leo's brain. Whose brain do you want to get into here?

SPEAKER 3
I think the people who are jumping, sure, James Core,

SPEAKER 1
Middleton, his friend, the other friends who are there. And you want to know what about their responsiveness to science love this kind. So just to fill out that a little bit if you had to get more facts in this case, what kind of facts would you want to have to show yes or no one way or the other that. Yeah, they would have responded to the sign or no, they wouldn't have responded to the sign. would have been like little Leo, even more perverse. He would have even been more encouraged to dive in. Um, I think we already knew that he had experience

SPEAKER 3
in lakes or was a lifeguard or something if I remember. So I think that would have been sure, OK, we

SPEAKER 1
actually have a fact that he's a lifeguard. So, how would that play into the argument?

SPEAKER 3
So then that means he's like been trained in terms of like warnings like this, so that would. Probably indicated that he would have considered the sign seriously.

SPEAKER 1
He's Mr. Safety. What are you talking about? He's a lifeguard. What do you mean he wouldn't have paid attention to a no diving sign? He's the one who puts up no diving signs to save other people. How could he not respond to a no diving sign? Are you, of course, any other fat boy, OK, but not this, not Mr. Life's, you know, not Mr. Safety, Mr. Lifeguard over here. Yeah, OK, something like that.

SPEAKER 3
I mean, Will just said, but what if he was a bad lifeguard, so maybe he would have ignored the signs.

SPEAKER 1
He was a bad lifeguard. He was a lifeguard, but he got fired. Why? Because like people were diving in into the shallow end and he didn't stop them. Yeah, he has absolutely no regard for safety of this particular kind, right? Something, something, you gotta get something, right? Yeah. You gotta try to convince aunt and uncle that this is how this person is. Again, we haven't done this before, getting inside the person's head and saying this is how they are, right? OK. We've only talked about the reasonable version or sort of generic version out in the public like the sign's for the public, but not this guy or these guys. OK, great. Remind me the second thing you said. What was the second thing you were, you had a second line of argument?

SPEAKER 3
Oh, we had also talked about on for the defense side, um, I think we read in the case that it's kind of hard to tell a lake's depth at any given, the depth, uh, part of the season. So even if there was a sign, it couldn't maybe consistently. Give the proper warning for the area because maybe at some points in the year you can dive, um, but maybe at this specific time it was extra shallow because of the season.

SPEAKER 1
OK, so here we have a number of possible argument paths you could go. You're saying the sign wouldn't have been effective, right? You're arguing for the Park Service saying it wouldn't have made a difference. And wouldn't have made a difference because it's hard to get the right information across on a sign. Why? Because the water level is always changing, the depth perception is always changing because of the stuff in the water and like. The sign, right, notice what this is pushing us towards is actually getting onto and uncle. Imagine the exact sign. That's the precaution at stake. Both sides want to do this, but once the plaintiff's side proposes, here's the precaution, no diving, let's say the sign says no diving, defense side can come back and say actually that wouldn't have done much good. And then what kinds of facts, you know, you wanna pack on to that, you can suggest that that's one size fits all sign doesn't work for actually informing people about the depth or about whatever they need to be aware of. Sometimes it is OK to dive actually, so it's overinclusive or whatever, something like that. That's not a good sign. Not a good sign to put up is an argument you can make under the negligence analysis but also here under causation in fact saying suppose that we were to do what they said we should have done, wouldn't have made a difference. Let's work with that. How, what, how spell that out just a little bit more, like, so far you've kind of convinced aunt and uncle maybe the science is not that great of an idea if it's so simple and doesn't have the diving depth and stuff like that on there. But how would you actually translate that into an argument that Wouldn't have made a difference. Suppose we had put up a sign like they say saying no diving, wouldn't have made a difference. Not because these guys are any particular way about signs, but just because a sign inherently it's not gonna make a good, not gonna, not gonna do the good that you think it's gonna do.

SPEAKER 3
Uh, I think we had from the case also an example of another one of the frat brothers, um, jumping in and not diving, and he hurt his tailbone. So even if it said no diving, they still would have maybe tried to jump in. Um, because I guess in some cases, maybe when you jump in, like not a dive, it's a little safer because it's not your head first. But again, that guy still got hurt. Um, even though he didn't dive, so that's like an example of, Oh, it's so shallow here that not diving

SPEAKER 1
is not the point. You just shouldn't be in the water at all, because even if you jump in headfirst, you'll injure yourself. Yeah. Sorry, even if you jump in feet first, you still injure yourself, something like that. Yeah. Interesting move. OK, it's a little tricky. The other side will be like, yeah, but this is a spinal cord injury involving his head. It's not the same, but you see that, you see how it goes. You see, you can say in a weird way. You can say it's actually so dangerous that the warning would not have made a difference because even if they had done the safer thing, it still would have hurt them. The premise being that they still would have dived in and then you have to show that these guys are a certain way about that, OK, something like that. So some combination of these guys are this way and also the situation is such that their response to that particular precaution you're telling us about would not have helped them. They still would have got injured, maybe in a different way, but still would have got injured, something like that, OK. Right? Interesting. Let's work with one more, and this one's gonna lead to a particular point. It's gonna sharpen up a little bit of what I was just saying earlier, and it's gonna take off from what this team is saying about warnings. Notice again how much with warnings we're talking about the other side's responsiveness to the warning. Just as much as the insulation we're talking about little Leo's response to the insulation, but here with warnings we really are talking about many different ways, at least 3 different ways of thinking about the person's response, a potential warne's response, and we just want to be a little more precise about that. So to do that, let's do our exercise again, talk to your neighbors for just another couple of minutes about the flying blade of death saw case. Remember the Saw case, blade guard comes off and the blade actually flies off and no one's expecting that, even though there's warnings all over the thing saying don't take it off. None of the warnings say blade will fly off. Remember that one? OK, from last time. Talk to your neighbors for just a couple of minutes, we'll come back and call on a goldfinch.

SPEAKER 0
One minute, one minute.

SPEAKER 1
OK, let's come back to the large group. Let's wrap up. OK, let's see what you've come up with. Let's see what your teams have come up with. Mr. Reeback. What's the Reebok team come up with?

SPEAKER 4
So it's a question of, is he the type of guy in his getting into his own mindset, um, if the sign had been much more descriptive and much more graphic, um, the warning, right, the warning, if the warning

SPEAKER 1
had said, let's do what we this we use example we got last time, which is blade may fly off, right, but blade will fly off, blade will fly off

SPEAKER 4
and chop off your arm. Uh, fly off and chop off your arm.

SPEAKER 1
OK, it's kind of long, but all right, right, OK,

SPEAKER 4
so if he had had that, the, the questions that you might ask, um, is he the guy who really pays attention to warnings? Um, is he someone who is very maybe skeptical and kind of assumes that the warning is because it will cause the machine to maybe malfunction a little bit, maybe it will fall foul of a regulation. Um, maybe he just doesn't take it seriously and maybe he has priors, Joseph, would your team want to know

SPEAKER 1
about him in order to establish some of this stuff and which side are you arguing for at this point?

SPEAKER 4
I would let, let's say I'll, I'll take the side first that he wouldn't have had to. be impacted by that warning. Um, In order for him wouldn't have made a difference.

SPEAKER 1
Let's say you're arguing that. Yeah, what kind of facts would you want to have?

SPEAKER 4
So if he was very experienced and he knew from prior experience with similar machines that these warnings are, you know, very overblown, um, that these warnings are really created for different ulterior motives, um, and he's done this type of thing before and he's been fine, um, so then maybe he has more of a almost a right to look at this warning as overblown.

SPEAKER 1
He has a right. OK, so now we're getting into something about rights or something, but what are we trying to show? We're trying to show that he would have, or he would have, he would have regarded the warning, disregarded the warning, disregarded the warning. He would have disregarded the warning. No matter how you want to evaluate the reasonableness of his disregarding warnings because he knows from experience or whatever, you're trying to show that he would have disregarded the warning. Here's a guy who knows a lot about SARS. He basically doesn't pay attention to the warnings because most of the time he shouldn't anyway, or most of the time it's he's safe, or most of the time, whatever the reason you're trying to show that he would have disregarded this particular warning, even if it were. As graphic as even if, yeah, like you'll lose your

SPEAKER 4
hand.

SPEAKER 1
OK, blade may fly off, you may lose your hand. You're gonna try to show that he would have disregarded this warning. Yeah, alright, because he's so good at this, or that's the, that's the theory. The theory is that he's so experienced with saws that he would have just taken safety into his own hands, so to speak. OK, that's one possible line of argument. Arguing the other way.

SPEAKER 4
Um, arguing the other way would be that he If the warning was more graphic, he would have heeded it. Um, he didn't heed the warning because specifically it didn't include that much information. He kind of assumed that it was for whatever reason it was that it would reduce its efficacy. Um, it wouldn't, you know, be good for the environment, um, had he known that the warning involved him, you know, losing limbs, maybe he's lost limbs before. He's lost his other hand and he really doesn't want to lose his second hand.

SPEAKER 1
And so he's really paying additional warnings these days. Yeah, OK, because of the last accident. All right.

SPEAKER 4
Then yeah, he would have been much more sort of

SPEAKER 1
how the same premise kind of works a little bit both ways like he knows a lot about this. You can use he really works with these electric salts all the time. You kind of see how the Reebok team is kind of, you know, showing you how to use that fact to argue maybe both ways on causation of fact. It probably works better on this side than the other side to say that look, he, he really knows how these warnings work and he knows they're overblown. He doesn't read the generic warnings because they're all, they don't tell you anything and they're overblown and. Anyway, so he disregards those, but if you had just put something like a bloody hand on a sticker or just blade may fly off, then he would have paid attention. Because he would have recognized that this is different from the usual warnings and so on, right? You can use the idea of this experience to argue both sides, probably a little bit better on this side, yeah, but whose brain are we inside right now? This is the point I would like to make with this example. Whose brain are we in as we talk about. Would have made a difference, would not have made a difference. We're inside his brain, his particular brain, subjective or objective? Subjective, reasonable version of him or him actually. I think him actually. Again, we haven't done this before, but here we are talking about him actually, this particular guy, this particular fact pattern. Alternate universe would have been different because of him and how he would have responded to the warnings or little Leo or whoever. Notice how this is different from two other analyses of a potential warning that we've already done so far. If we're talking about his own contributory negligence or comparative negligence, who are we asking the jury to imagine, right? Here in causation in fact, we're asking the jury to imagine inside this guy's brain. Mr. Hood's brain, what's happening? But for. Mr. Hood's negligence analysis, negligence, the reasonable man, the reasonable version of Mr. Hood, who maybe is an expert and so on, OK. But a reasonable version of him And then for the blade companies, the saw company Robbi's negligence, who are we asking them to imagine being the warnee? Mr. Hood himself, a reasonable version of Mr. Hood or something else? The reasonable Mr.

SPEAKER 4
Hood.

SPEAKER 1
Oh. Right, if you're to I saw a company. And we're now evaluating your behavior. We're saying a reasonable saw company would have looked out there into the world and imagined selling the saw to only reasonable people or everyone? Everyone, everyone, everyone. Who are we asking the jury in that way indirectly really to say that this company, a reasonable version of this company would have put down a certain kind of warning that would have been enough to. Inform just this guy or just a reasonable guy or everyone, everyone, everyone, the general public. So just keep this straight in your heads. The argumentation might not be that different in the end, but keep it straight in your heads. You're talking about the actual behavior as negligent or not, his own behavior as negligent or not, of course you're talking about the reasonable version of Mr. Hood. If you're talking about the company's behavior and being reasonable or not and putting out a certain type of warning, you're talking about their imagination, a reasonable company's imagination of who out there might be reading the warnings. It could be anyone, right? It could be a child, could be a reasonable person, could be a non-reasonable person, it could be Mr. Hood, it could be somebody else. Everyone out there, OK, that's the warning you're asking the jury to imagine and then for causation in fact you're asking them to imagine this particular dude, what would he have done if he had seen that particular sticker. Based on subjective facts about himself, right? Let's just keep these three straight. A little review, bringing stuff together from the last few days and today.

SPEAKER 0
OK, let's take a break.

SPEAKER 1
Sorry for the late break, and I'll see you in 5 minutes.

SPEAKER 0
I. Yeah That's good. And I think he's in Florida. I. I I He doesn't, uh, he's not really proud a lot. That I And then. Uh Yeah, yeah, no, there's doctors. I Yeah, no, it's it's good. make sure there's a lot. I I uh. Yeah, actually both of my It was so crushing. No, I was like I I I. Oh, so that was really good. Well, go on. Oh yeah, yeah. I'm just dreaming. I don't understand listening to this twinkle. You were scared of scared. I you guys are having a debate. I. It's really funny I OK. But the Benburg had a lot of like. Give you a minute. I. I OK. I Oh, I'm sure. OK Yeah, yeah. No. Oh. I feel like. It lasts. I don't work. Yeah. I. I. Yeah, the curtain is. I, no. So. yeah. She cooks No. I don't I don't. I. I wasn't on that. Yeah. And I. It's crazy. That. Oh Yeah. Did you I like. stunning. You're not that. I They're like the I don't know, it's like I was. Yeah Oh, I was thinking. It's not. This Yeah. Yeah That It was like it was. I. OK. I Yeah. Oh. Oh. Yeah I always. the classic. OK, welcome back.

SPEAKER 1
Any announcements?

SPEAKER 0
Any announcements? Yes, tomorrow, um, the TF will be having office hours from 12:20 to 1:10 in Big Warren 3:10.

SPEAKER 1
OK, thank you very much. Remember that last week the teaching fellows had a review session. Remember that. The slides from the review session which are posted on courseworks under files are our official notes for this class. I've gone through every slide, check them out. They really are authoritative as like, here's what you need to know from those particular days in class. So be sure to get last week's review session TF review session slides as your notes and then again next Tuesday, not tomorrow but next Tuesday when they do another review session. Those notes will be again the authoritative notes from all the subjects that we covered until then, OK, so be sure to get those resources. These things are also on PDFs, remember, be sure to get those as well. As you already know, we're on our 2nd course packet, OK, and the print office here didn't do the strike throughs, so there's a lot of extraneous text that I'm going to try to steer you away from in the reading. So the reading assignments may just be more detailed, more of a pain to get figure out exactly what you're supposed to read, but it's to save you from reading extraneous stuff. So pay attention when I say. This star page to that start page or this paragraph to that paragraph. That's really meant to save you from reading really um too much stuff. OK, so keep your eye out for that. Sorry that uh the printing for this course packet and we'll try to fix it for the third course packet coming later. OK, my office hours again tomorrow, Tuesdays 8:30 to 9:30 and 9:08. 908, just go right up the elevator. It's that glassy seminar room. There'll be snacks. Come and go as you please. You don't have to have questions. Feel free to just chit chat or sit and listen to other people's questions or whatever. We can all sit there and just do our email if you want a nice, nice place to hang out on a Tuesday morning. Totally fine too. So whatever you like, OK? 9:08, 8:30 to 9:30 tomorrow, and then a little bit later in the semester, I'll do some on Zoom so that those who can't make it can still join. Virtually. Again, you can always ask me questions right after class as well. So I'll be here. OK, we have now done some practice. With Causation in fact, using the but for analysis, the idea of what did it make a difference? And the reason we're spending a lot of time on this is not only because again it's shows up a lot in tort law, as we'll see it shows up in pretty intense ways in tort law, but also because this idea of causation in fact using the but-for analysis like flipping the counterfactual and saying it would have happened anyway, it wouldn't have happened anyway, shows up a lot in other areas of law. A lot of law uses that mechanism. And um keep your eyes out for it. You'll see the justices of the Supreme Court currently are really kind of high on this idea and they they try to use it quite a lot so it shows up there even in interpretations of federal statutes and that kind of thing. Um, but more generally in any kind of regulatory design, in design that looks like civil liability, maybe other kinds of liability, regulatory or crim, you may also see it appear. So keep your eyes out for it. It is such a basic structure in how to set up a legal system of attributing responsibility that you'll see it in lots of places. In tort law, maybe the height of seeing this logic at work. is going to be something like the Matsuyama case. And what we're gonna see here, we'll walk through it in a second, but what we see here is certain things coming together that we've been talking about. First, this idea of making a difference as kind of the key. That's really the key to saying that you're responsible. Without that, tort law is just not gonna say that you're responsible, except for maybe a few edge scenarios we'll talk about on Wednesday. But for the most part, tort law is gonna lean very hard on this idea of like you're responsible if you made a difference. And to the extent that you made a difference. To the extent that you made a difference. Right. How much good would it have done to have taken that precaution in our negligence analysis? Remember that shows up in BPL and just how we think about arguing that precautions worth taking, how much good it would have done. Really is essential. So it shows up in negligence, it shows up here, and it shows up here in ever more precise ways, not just on and off, did it make a difference what you did, but how much of a difference did it make. We didn't talk about this last time, but remember in the Carroll Towing case, the Barge case. Remember what damages were at stake in that particular dispute over the barge's negligence. The way that Learned Hand wrote that opinion was to say that we're not interested in the collision harm, the collision damages he called it. Because that would have happened anyway, even if he were there. There's no way one bargy sitting on a barge could have prevented this thing from crashing into the propeller. There still would have been the damage from the collision. All we're talking about is the stuff he could have prevented, which was the sinking of the boat and the loss of the flower. Right, so already in that opinion, we didn't talk about it, but already there you saw judges and lawyers being quite precise about what it is that we're talking about you're being responsible for. It's only what you could have made a difference for. The other stuff, it would have happened anyway, it would have happened anyway, not your problem, you might say, OK. Matsuyama is a way of taking that even to the next level. And so let's talk about that. This is really at the frontiers of where tort law has pushed out the idea. But it's worth getting into because we can see where tort law has stopped, why it seems reluctant to go further. And now we're starting to get a little bit into tort responsibility. For causing risk as opposed to causing an actual injury. Getting close to that idea. So let's remind ourselves of the story. Alex Worrell, will you please remind us of the story of Matsuyama?

SPEAKER 5
Yeah, um, I believe, I'm sorry, I forgot my like booklet with me, so I'm doing this off of my memory, but I believe that it's, um, oh thank you, um, that a guy went to the doctor, um, because he, uh, thought that there was something wrong with like his gut, his uh, his colon, and the doctor, uh, I believe just sort of like he didn't really do anything. About it and it ended up getting worse and uh the guy ended up dying because the doctor didn't intervene in time to save him.

SPEAKER 1
And what would the intervention have been? What would the right intervention have been? What was the untaken precaution, so to speak?

SPEAKER 5
Oh goodness, sorry, I'm trying to remember. Give me one sec. Mhm. An endoscopy.

SPEAKER 1
OK, he didn't do an endoscopy. What would that have been for? What would that do?

SPEAKER 5
Uh, the endoscopy would let him see, uh, the guy's stomach, right?

SPEAKER 1
And that would have helped him do what?

SPEAKER 5
To diagnose what was wrong with him and then treat it. Uh, he had cancer.

SPEAKER 1
He had cancer. He had stomach cancer. Right? And so there's all these signs, all that we need to get into the medical stuff here. I know we get into the facts a lot, but here we're gonna get into other facts that are gonna be more useful for making the point. Basically this is a medical malpractice case we know how to do that. Some expert shows up. You read about all those experts who showed up on each side making debate, debating the odds and debating what was supposed to be done and when and so on. But basically what you had is you had a medical malpractice case where the doctor didn't diagnose you soon enough. Years and years went by. Each time it was like, take this or take that or, you know, whatever, but not testing for stomach cancer. Even though, as the experts were testifying, that's probably what you should have tested for given the person's age and ethnicity and profile and so on and symptoms like, yeah, test for stomach cancer, like who doesn't check for that any doctor would check for that, but Doctor Birnbaum did not and so of course this is just a case of Uh, failed early diagnosis, OK. Alex, was it diagnosed eventually that he had stomach cancer?

SPEAKER 5
Yes, but not in time for anything to, not in time for it to be like meaningfully treated.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, he was diagnosed at stage 4. It was too late. And you know there's different, this is a different era, maybe there's better treatments now, but in the story at least that we have. What difference would it have made, let's put it that way, for this doctor to have done the right thing and diagnosed it earlier or done the tests to get the diagnosis earlier.

SPEAKER 5
Yeah, they could have, uh, he could have done, um, like surgery, uh, before it spread or chemotherapy before it, it got to the level of stage 4.

SPEAKER 1
All right, so the idea is that you could have gotten some treatment if you had been diagnosed earlier, but because you were diagnosed so late, there was no real useful treatment at that point, OK. Do we have some sense of how likely it is that he would have survived had he been diagnosed earlier as opposed to late when he was actually diagnosed?

SPEAKER 5
Yeah, they give a couple of different statistics that um if it was. Uh, found at stage one, the survival rate would have been like between 60 and 80, stage 2, 30 to 50, stage 3, 10 and 20, and then at stage four when it was actually caught, it's less than a 4% chance of survival. OK, so these are the points, these are the facts

SPEAKER 1
that we're interested in, right? This is what aunt and uncle are hearing. In a case like this, you have, you have these experts, they come in and they say, well, you know, it's not precise, but we have this range for survival, and by survival we mean a chance of 5 year survival, which is a pretty good sort of standard indicator for what it means to survive a cancer is that you live for 5 more years. OK, that's what we're gonna use. Here's the numbers. Aunt and uncle then have to like take that evidence and figure out what they think that evidence means for this guy. Chances of survival at the moment that he was. Not diagnosed, and then also at the moment that he was diagnosed. Why are we interested in both of these things? Why are we asking the jury in a case like this to work out, actually pick a number. For here's what we expect. Here's the survival chances at that, at that, you know, 4 years ago or whenever, and here's the survival chances when he finally got diagnosed. Why do we want these numbers here?

SPEAKER 5
Um, because it shows that, well, because you can make the argument and I guess the jury to come to the conclusion that but for the doctor's inaction, the guy would have survived, would have survived, or had a a much higher chance of survival, higher chance of survival.

SPEAKER 1
Remember what we're doing here all day we've been talking about what difference would it have made? Would it have made a difference? And now we're getting not just to like would he have lived or died, but actually saying that the difference it would have made is some extra chance of survival. In other words, the difference that it made not to do the diagnosis was to increase his chances of death. Is equivalent to saying that. And really now what we're starting to sound like we're talking about is saying that tort law in some cases really is just this context medical malpractice, loss of chance or lost chance cases that you see this where tort law is willing to go this far and say hey look we're gonna hold you accountable for what you caused and what you caused is an increased risk of death. A decreased chance of survival. Not that you died, not that you didn't die, and had some other illness, that's, we can deal with that separately. But we can actually hold you accountable, charge you, so to speak. Right, for the damages. That relate to a some amount, let's say here in this case, 37.5% chance. Of lost Extra survivalliness. OK, these numbers are a little bit fudged relative to the details, but it gives you an idea. Of how to think through this. Let's say the jury picked out this number based on this range of like, I don't know, something in in the middle, 37.5. Jury says he had a 37.5% chance of survival had he been diagnosed, right, had there not been the malpractice of misdiagnosing or non-diagnosing him. Relative to the survival chances of when he finally did get. Diagnosed, which was, let's call it 0. And so Alex, what's the difference we're talking about here? What difference did it make? Oh, I say, right?

SPEAKER 5
Oh yeah, it made in this like hypothetical 37.5%. Difference, um, in his chance of survival.

SPEAKER 1
That's the difference that the malpractice made. Now the question for this court, what court are we in, by the way?

SPEAKER 5
Uh, we are in the, uh, Massachusetts, uh, Supreme, uh, Supreme Court, yeah, Massachusetts, Mass SJC.

SPEAKER 1
It's the Massachusetts Supreme Court. It's the High Court of Massachusetts. It is the court that makes up tort law for Massachusetts, right? It's a common law court, high court. We have Chief Justice Margie Marshall here. Well-known judge. Quite a few historic rulings, you can look her up, Margaret Marshall, Margie Marshall. And she's pushing out tort law in this case, saying, We're gonna take this idea that this malpractice increases guy's chances of death or reduces his chances of survival by 37.5%, assuming those are the facts as found by the jury. We're saying what we're saying that has to do with like something about proof of his survival or not survival or what are we gonna do with that number? What does that number actually become in tort law in Massachusetts thanks to her opinion?

SPEAKER 5
Yeah, it's um like for loss of chance, so it's about, I believe like proportion of recovery. So proportion of recovery.

SPEAKER 1
And so what are we characterizing here? We're saying that 37.5% is literally what that like that's

SPEAKER 5
his liability essentially liability that um and in terms of

SPEAKER 1
Mr. Matsuyama, we're saying that oh that he could that his

SPEAKER 5
estate could recover then like 37.5% of what it would be had he been a had the doctor been 100% liable.

SPEAKER 1
That's right. And so we can call that what in relation to Mr. Matsuyama. What is he collecting his money for?

SPEAKER 5
Oh, it's, well, it's wrongful death. Sorry, I'm confused about what you're asking.

SPEAKER 1
So far we've talked about the idea of harm or injury in tort law as like a concrete binary thing that can happen to you. You get electrocuted, you don't electrocute it, get executed. We don't say little Leo had an extra 45% chance of being electrocuted. As the harm, but what's happening here?

SPEAKER 5
Oh, that it's like it's 37.5% of like what his, what his income would have been had he not died.

SPEAKER 1
Right, but we're conceptualizing that as In this case, oh,

SPEAKER 5
as. The damages, like, I'm sorry, I'm very confused about before

SPEAKER 1
we get the damages, before we talk about the money, what is the 35.7.5% representing now?

SPEAKER 5
Well, it's representing, uh, like the fault of the doctor. I, I'm so sorry. I'm very confused. It's the injury, OK.

SPEAKER 1
This case for the first time in Massachusetts says that you can take an increased chance of something that we might think of as an injury like death and take the risk itself, the risk creation itself as the injury. It's this We know how to think about an injury if your arm gets lopped off. That's eerie. Remember his arm gets chopped off. You know how to think about that as an injury. You know how to think about an injury if it. Is like a cancer that spreads all over your body and hurts you in various places. We know how to think about that But the question for a lost chance court trying to figure out is this the tort law we want for our state. Is can we think about just the creation of risk really. Reducing someone's chances of survival, increasing their chances of death, can we think of that? As the injury. Even though in some other sense the injury that he suffered is death, can we reconceptualize. The injury as this risk. This is where we're at the frontiers of tort law. Tort law, except for a couple of more examples on Wednesday, tries not to do this. It tries really hard to say that. Only if there's something that we can really call injury are we interested in this case. OK. If you're a drunk driver, you're going around, you're spinning off risk into the world. And you happen not to hit anyone, there's no tort. Tort law would say But if you're the same person and on a bad, unlucky day you happen to hit someone, now that is a tort. Alex, is, is the thing that you're doing any different between you're driving, drunk driving, and then you happen not to hit anyone and then you're drunk driving, you're drunk driving and for whatever. Random reason someone actually gets hit, is your faultiness any different?

SPEAKER 5
No, it's kind of just luck, honestly.

SPEAKER 1
Philosophers call it moral luck. Tort theorists also use the phrase moral luck. We'll come back to this phrase, this idea of moral luck. Why is it? That tort law is set up so that it's not like regulation, it's not like crime. Where If you just act badly, somehow you may potentially be liable. If you're just speeding, you have to pay the fine whether you hit somebody or not. If you're speeding, you have to hit the pay the fine whether you hit somebody or not. But if you're in tort land, tort law is not gonna recognize that you're responsible for anything unless you actually do hit someone. But the faultiness is the same. You're just the same bad driver, you're the same negligent person doing the same negligent thing in both situations. Why is luck a part of whether or not you should be held responsible? How does that fit with the aims of tort law? Wronging us. Deterrence, right? Shouldn't we be deterring the drunk driver who happens not to hit someone just as much as the person who happens to hit someone? Isn't it just as wrong to be a drunk driver here as it is to be a drunk driver here? Wait a second, why is tort law so hung up on this? That's something we can puzzle over, but here's an example where tort law gets a little bit beyond that, saying. Actually, you know what, this thing that you did that kind of gave him a better chance of dying like that, that itself. Is now the harm. And this is why as Alex is telling you, eventually what they have to pay is that share of wrongful death damages. It's a 37.5% share of like the total amount. That we normally would think of as wrongful death damages. OK. So that's what's happening here. And Alex, just one more hypo just to get this in our heads. Suppose that The evidence showed. To aunt and uncle's satisfaction that These were the chances instead, the chances were that. He Had been, had he been diagnosed at the right time, he would have had a 40% chance of survival, but he was diagnosed too late, so he had only a 10% chance. Still some chance of survival. He's not a dead man, but he still has some chance of survival. What are we talking about here as the injury?

SPEAKER 5
The injury then is 30% because it's the difference, still

SPEAKER 1
the difference. It doesn't matter that he has some chance of survival still, it's not about wiping out his chances of survival, it's about the difference. Really taking seriously this idea. OK. So let's turn to the relationship of this logic with what we've been talking about with causation in fact. And there's sort of two points of connection. One is the one we've just been talking about, the other is going to be a little bit more doctrinal. Cecilia, Sebastian. Hello. Hi. What is the Supreme Court here, well, Massachusetts Supreme Court, what is Justice? Marshall Margie Marshall say about. What happens when we take this idea of harm. And reconceptualize it as the change in a chance of survival or increasing the risk of death. When we do that, does anything change about how we use but-for causation? Or you can explain in your own words how would we show to aunt and uncle that but for this doctor's. Misdiagnosis, medical malpractice, some different outcome would have happened. What happens to that logic? When we make the switch from harm as something like death to harm as something like increased risk of death.

SPEAKER 6
Um. Are you asking specifically like what she says in the opinion or or just conceptually because I, I, either one, OK, I'm, I'm inclined to repeat what you were saying is that we move from a binary world in which it's like, um, the defendant's negligence either causes like a concrete injury that we can see or not to a world in which um. Like we're looking to statistics and data to determine, um, Sort of, yeah, how, how do I wanna say this? Like, um. Yeah, in this case, like chance of survival, yeah, um,

SPEAKER 1
as the harm, as the harm, right, this is her opinion. Her opinion says what I'm doing here, she says it flat out is I'm reconceptualizing harm to include this thing. And she says that when we do this in our law of torts, this has some relation to the but for causation idea. How would you explain that in your own words?

SPEAKER 6
Um, I mean, I would say but for, and, and Alex was saying this already, but like, but for the doctor's inaction, but for the doctor's failure to, um, diagnose based on sympt um symptoms or signs that were, were like very, very visible, um, at the early stage this plaintiff would have had, um. A greater chance of surviving and caring for his family and all of these other things.

SPEAKER 1
Right? That's how the buffer causation works. He would have had this greater chance. He would have had this better outcome. The way you just did that logic, is it any different from saying, had there been a sign, the swimmer wouldn't have thrown his head into the water and been fine? Is there any difference in the logic?

SPEAKER 6
I mean, I think that I, I, there, there's no difference in the logic. I think the difference is that except, you know, with 20/20 hindsight we know, um, we likely know that he, he would have had a, a greater chance of survival, but I, I mean maybe there's like some small chance that he still would have died within 4 years, um, or 5 years, um, where are you going with this. I'm just saying that the chance of survival, like something like a percentage, is like it still means there's a chance he doesn't survive.

SPEAKER 1
Yes, sure. I mean there's a big chance that he doesn't survive even if he were properly diagnosed.

SPEAKER 6
Yes, that's what I'm trying to say. Yes, but the logic, like the but for logic is the same.

SPEAKER 1
Here's what Celia's telling us, the logic is the same. What Justice Marshall says about the reason we're doing this in medical malpractice cases like this is in order to preserve the but-for causation logic. We know how to do that in tort law. We're gonna preserve it. By reconceptualizing the harm, the reason we want to is because other courts have gotten confused when they see these numbers and they think, oh look, 37.5% chance he's gonna die anyway. But that's not the point. The point is not to say he would have died anyway. The point is to say what difference did it make? Right. Other courts might take the 37.5% chance, right? As Cecilia's saying, he still has some chance he's gonna die, a pretty big chance, more than half chance that he's gonna die, and take that and misunderstand that to say that that means there's no but-for causation. But that's not what we mean by but-for causation. But-for causation, we can do better than that with this concept, and to do better with that, with this concept and preserve it the way we know, we can just reconceptualize the harm. Once we reconceptualize the harm, it's exactly the same as before. We don't get thrown off. No courts are gonna be confused by this idea that, oh, because he still might die, or likely to die than somehow. It doesn't count as but-for causation. Yes, it does still count, because we can say that it but for caused the difference that it actually did make. Great. So now we get to the tricky part, which is Let's suppose that we're dealing with the lower half numbers here, 40% to 10%. If we really take this seriously, this idea that we've reconceptualized the harm as this risk. And this, let's say this doctor has gone out and misdiagnosed all kinds of people, lots of people. And they're all caught too late. Some live, some die, because there's still a 10% chance, even though. They got misdiagnosed, right? Because by the point they were diagnosed they still had a 10% chance of living. They lost 30% but they still have 10%. So some of them live, a small number, a lot of them die. Unnecessarily we would say due to the doctor's malpractice and negligence. We know how the but-for causation works exactly as you said and as Alex said, which is look, he but-for caused a 30% loss to each of them. Right. Should all of them be able to sue and recover what they lost? After all, they lost it. Every single one of these people lost 30% chance of living. From this doctor. Should they all, in theory, should they all be able to recover? I mean, is there harm, right?

SPEAKER 6
Um, we're, we're assuming that because the doctor failed to, um, correctly diagnose based on signs that were legible to other doctors, then I would say yes, they should all get to recover.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, sure, let's say we've established everything the way it's established here. Experts come in, they say, look, it's 40%, 10%, aunt and uncle say 40% and 10%, and yes, he should have done it. Everybody else would have done it. Great. Let's say it's malpractice, it's negligent. That's the actual difference. All these facts are found. Should they all be able to recover?

SPEAKER 6
I think so, yes, right.

SPEAKER 1
That's the harm, right? They all suffer 30% loss of life. Chance, right? But 10% of them lived. Should the people who lived also be able to recover from this doctor even though They lived.

SPEAKER 6
Um, I think that if they suffered additional like pain and suffering because of the late diagnosis, meaning a more invasive surgery, Um, then potentially you might have a case for saying I was caused like a specific kind of injury, um, given that I was not diagnosed quickly enough. Yeah, and that has nothing to do with loss of

SPEAKER 1
chance. You also caused me this other thing. Yeah, you took away 30% of my chance of living, but then I also like had to go through this other surgery and stuff. Sure, you can count that in. Let's say that it doesn't exist. Let's say they just don't even know. They don't even know one day they read the paper. They're like, oh my, my doctor's being sued. He did the same thing to me. I'm only realizing it just now. I'm totally fine. This is, maybe I should sue. Mr. Matsuyama lost 30%. I lost 30%. They're suing. I can sue. Yes, no, um, I don't think you can sue for

SPEAKER 6
loss of chance of survival because you survived.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, why do you think that?

SPEAKER 6
Um, This is like conceptually hard to articulate, but I,

SPEAKER 1
it's tricky, right?

SPEAKER 6
Yeah tricky, but there, there's no, there's no injury. But this goes back to the like do you mean

SPEAKER 1
there's no injury. There's loss of 30%. That is the harm we've reconceptualized harm now. That is the injury you suffered it too. You just happen to live, but that doesn't mean you don't lose 30% chance of if somebody took away, you know, a lottery ticket from you.

SPEAKER 6
Mm, um, Somebody steals your lottery ticket.

SPEAKER 1
That's a loss. That's value, right, but it's like only value if it

SPEAKER 6
was a winning lottery ticket, OK.

SPEAKER 1
How does that relate to this argument?

SPEAKER 6
Um, I guess you have like at the very bottom of the slope 0.0000 something percent that, um, oh wait,

SPEAKER 1
no, no, we're talking about 10%, yeah, OK, let's say 100 people, 60 of them died anyway, even if they hadn't been properly diagnosed, they would have died. 30% died because of this doctor's malpractice. 10% live despite the doctor's malpractice. Yes, does that characterization help you in some way help you say suggest that there shouldn't be recovery in those 10% cases? What's changed and how I just characterized the story.

SPEAKER 6
Um, that they didn't lose their lives.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, I've, I've redefined the harm back to death. Yeah, but the minute you really take seriously the idea that the harm is the lost 30% chance of living. The people who survived suffered it too. Anyway, you're right that the court does not go that far. The court stops short of that, as you may have come across in the footnote, or don't worry about it, but the court does not go that far to say that we're taking it that seriously, so seriously, this idea that 30% loss is a harm that even those who lived can sue for it, even though conceptually that is what seems to be required. And here maybe we get back to our intuitions about moral luck again. You might think, oh, moral luck is weird. Why does a drunk driver only Liable when they happen to hit someone. Well, why is this doctor only liable for loss of chance in the cases where Someone actually dies. Same thing. Doctor spinning off risk into the world, doctor spinning off risk into the world happens to kill somebody over here, doesn't happen to kill somebody over there, but like isn't that what we want to think of as the wrong? Is the spinning off of risk into the world. If your intuitions have changed in thinking about this case. And taking Cecilia's argument that oh I don't think it should, well, what would you do about the drunk driver case? Anyway, these are unsolved problems in tort law. Our intuitions about moral luck are so powerful and yet also our intuitions about, well, it's not really a harm, it's not really a harm. Yeah, we're kind of saying it's a harm, but it's not really a harm. Why don't we say that about the drunk driver who's spinning off risk into the world and happens not to hit anyone. That's a harm, isn't it? Is it not? I don't know. You can see the tension at work and you can see why this court has kind of stopped at that stage. This is about as far as courts have gone in using this idea of loss of chance of some good outcome as the harm itself. It tends to show up, as you see in Abraham, only in these medical malpractice cases because we have really good statistics, because it's visualizable, it's contained with medicine. Courts have been very reluctant to push it out to other contexts. You might, as an exercise, imagine for yourself, how would it work for a drunk driver. Let's say that we can sue any drunk driver that happens to be in our neighborhood for loss of chance. He didn't hit me, but I lost a 2% chance, right, of survival because I could have been there. Can I sue for that? How do, what do we do with that? Should the person who actually got hit only be able to sue for 2% also? How do we do, how do we do that? Why are intuitions so different between here and a drunk driving case? All right, we'll come back to some of these ideas about moral luck a little bit later in the course. Let's now shift gears, so to speak, and talk about Restatement 27 multiple sufficient causes. This is gonna set us up for a conversation on Wednesday, but it's useful for us to sort of get a handle on what's happening here with the logic of but for causation. Jeffrey Zhou Hi, will you just read for us restatement number 27. Again, we're now focusing on this way of showing causation in fact. Remember, we have our two ways of showing causation in fact here. We've just been working through but for causation, and now we're gonna work through the other one, multiple sufficient causes. Um, yeah, so, uh, restatement section 27, uh, multiple sufficient causes. If multiple acts occur, each of which under Section 26 alone would have been a factual cause of the physical harm at the same time in the absence of the other act, each act is regarded as a factual cause of the harm. OK. All right, so let's figure out what that means in practice and let's do some examples. Here's a starting example for us. Let's say that you're driving. In kind of dangerous conditions at night, I'm driving also in kind of dangerous conditions at night. Neither of us have our lights on. We've negligently both left our lights off. It's dangerous conditions. We should have our lights on. We both failed to have our lights on. We're both negligent. But that doesn't mean we're cause in fact. So let's talk about each of two possible fact patterns. One fact pattern has it so that the conditions, let's say the experts come in and they say under these conditions, there's only an accident if both of you have your lights off, right? We had an accident and then the experts come in and say, well, yeah, this is the kind of conditions where it really took both of you having your lights off in order for the cars to crash. Is your negligently having your light off a but-for cause of the accident and is my negligently having my lights off a but-for cause of the accident? Um, no, because neither were alone sufficient. Wait, say again? Uh. It, it seems like we have to both do it

SPEAKER 2
for it to happen, so like neither of us alone were like suspicious.

SPEAKER 1
But how does the but for causation logic work? Let's work through your negligence. But for your having your lights off, what would have happened? Would we have had a car crash? Uh, yeah, why? It takes both of us having our lights off. Once you have your lights on.

SPEAKER 2
I Uh I guess, guess what? No, you're right, um, I know I'm right, but like

SPEAKER 1
explain why.

SPEAKER 2
No, yeah, so like if I, if I turn my

SPEAKER 1
lights, lights on, it wouldn't have happened. Yes, if you had your lights on, it wouldn't have happened. What about me? If I had not negligently had my lights off, in other words, if I had properly had my lights on, what accident or no accident? Given what you were doing, no accident, no accident. Given that your lights were off, the minute I have my lights on, there's no accident. Given that I have my lights off, the minute your lights are on, no accident. It takes both of us. We're multiple necessary causes. We're both but for causes. Necessary cause means the same thing as but-for cause. OK, so I'll write here multiple necessary causes. Both are but for. OK, we haven't had this phrase show up yet, multiple necessary causes, but it will set us up to talk about multiple sufficient causes. And you see the logic, the but for logic works perfectly fine here. Because his negligence is a cause, my negligence is a cause. All you have to do is you just flip the switch, you do the counterfactual, lights on, no accident, lights on, no accident. OK, now you know where we're going, right? The second one is a scenario where it's actually so dangerous of a situation. That the only way to prevent the accident is for both of us to have our lights on. So now we're in a situation where the reality is we both had our lights off, and now we evaluate each of our negligences for but-for causation. We say, but for your negligence and having your lights off. In other words, if you had your lights on, would that have prevented the accident given that my lights were off? Uh, no, no, it would have made no difference. But what about me? Uh, also no. Same by symmetry and also just you work through it, the same. The consistent conditions are such that just him having his lights on, flipping that switch doesn't make a difference. Just me having my lights on, flipping that switch doesn't make a difference. Neither of us are but-for causes. We're both off the hook under tort law. If all we have to use is this idea of the but-for causation counterfactual, it's just this weird little logical anomaly here, where if you have multiple causes and each is sufficient, right, the reason that his lights don't matter is because my lights being off is sufficient to cause the accident. The reason I don't matter is his behavior is sufficient to cause the accident. You can see how, like, in a way it's a riskier situation. Both of us are sufficient. Either one of us is sufficient to cause the accident through our negligent behavior, and as a result, neither of us is a necessary cause, neither of us is a but-for cause, precisely because the other is sufficient. Once you have a sufficient cause, nothing else is necessary. Kind of a perverse logical result, where both of us in a way are doing something worse, you might say, and yet somehow we're both off the hook under the old but-for causation logic. Well-known anomaly. Everybody talks about it all the time because it's so funky, and the restatement addresses it by saying, how does the rape statement address it, Jeffrey? Uh, if like, am I supposed to read the comments or no, no, just read the, just read the 27 again, oh, like. Each of which under Section 26 alone would have been a factual cause of the physical harm. At the same time in the absence of the other act, each act is regarded as a factual cause of the harm. Each is considered right just by fiat of the restatement writers. Each is still considered a cause in fact. Here's where these statement writers are saying we know about this logical puzzle. Tort professors have talked about this for hundreds of years. We're just gonna fix it. We're just gonna plug it in. So are we in this scenario considered causes in fact under the restatement? Even though we're not but for causes. Excuse me, can you repeat the question? In version two, under what you just described from the restatement, are we considered, are you considered a cause of fact? Am I considered a cause of fact? No. Well, we're not buffer causes, but what does the restatement 27 say? Um, it says that, um. Each of which alone has to be sufficient, so I, I don't think that falls in that category. I'm confused. Sorry, wait, say that again. Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm just confused. Like, doesn't the Section 2027 say that it only counts

SPEAKER 2
if it's like a loan sufficient and like inversion to.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, aren't you sufficient? In the story You're having your lights off is sufficient to cause the accident here, right, in scenario two. Oh sorry, my, yeah, right, so we're both, what, uh, we're both negative, we're both causes in fact by the restatement. OK, this is called the multiple sufficient causes sort of gap-filling provision that tort law has invented to take care of this particular situation. Which otherwise might seem a little perverse, OK. So, if you want to practice for yourself, you can work through a couple of other possibilities here. Different factual scenarios where different people having their lights on or off would or would not. Relate to the accident, can play with that on your own. But what we're gonna do is just get started on one particular. Favorite example which you've seen in Abraham. Jasmine Lorenzo? This is the two fires story from Abraham. This is another typical way, this is not the typical way. This is the typical way towards people talk about multiple sufficient causes is sort of two fires converging on a house. So let's set this up. Let's say that you're out here setting a fire. OK. You're doing so negligently. OK. The fire is. Going to spread. To the house. And the fire is sufficient to burn down the house. Oh, but guess what, the house is already on fire. And that fire too would have been sufficient to burn down the house. And that fire is natural fire, just electrical. Something happened, nobody's fault, nobody's negligent behavior. How would we think through but for causation here? Is the negligent setting of the fire a but-for cause of The fire burning down the house. Um, I think a natural like if the house was already on fire, then the negligent fire didn't cause the burning of the house was already because it was already in effect. Yeah, and so therefore, but for the negligently caused fire was already happened because it it was burning before you started the negligent fire. Oh, so let's say that it's not before, but it's, it's burning, OK. At the time that the negligently set fire arrives to the house, the house is already on fire, and so you say, but for this negligently caused, negligengently set fire reaching the house, but for that, what the house would or would not have burned down anyway. It would have burned down anyway. It would have burned down anyway, right? It's just a natural course of things. You're not a but-for cause, because you would have made no difference. You might think of it as a case where lightning has hit the house, right? Any different here if it's lightning touching the house, lightning has hit the house, put it on fire, roof set is negligently set fire, your fire reaches the house, but for your negligently set fire, what? It would have already been on fire. The house would burn out anyway. OK. Classic no but for causation scenario. You got really lucky here because that house was already gonna burn down, so you made no difference to your negligent act. Then what about this? You're negligently setting a fire. I'm negligently setting a fire. Both our fires are sufficient to burn down the house. Both reached the house at the same time, and Abraham, this is the two simultaneous fires. What now? Are you a but for cause of, is your negligently setting this fire a but for cause of the house burning down? Is my negligently. Setting a fire, a but-for cause of this house burning down. Yes. Wait, we're but for causes? No, no, we're not but for causes. Why? Because if I didn't, you still would have done it. Yes, and if you didn't, and I, it would have been on fire already. That's right. It's like me and Jeffrey having our lights off, OK? If we just had it on, well, here it wouldn't have made a difference if you hadn't negligently set the fire because my fire would have burned the house down. And would it have made a difference if I said a negligently fire or not, because your fire would have burned the house down when neither of us are but-for causes, and yet what, what would torts say about this under Restatement 27? Um, We're multiple sufficient, multiple sufficient, yes, exactly right. They're saying, hey, look, we understand the scenario. This is a classic setup of how multiple sufficient causes story tends to look. And it's exactly the same as we were talking about with Jeffrey. Neither of us is a but for cause. Each of us is sufficient tort law is still gonna hold us as causes in fact because of that, even though but for causation logically fails. So one thing you might start thinking about, and we'll practice this a little bit next time again we'll do more of this is what if there's lots of people setting these fires? Right? Does that make any difference? In how we think about this, doesn't make sense to hold everybody as a multiple sufficient cause, factually causal here. And of course there's a question of again of what if one of us is not negligent? What happens then to causation and to liability? All right, so we'll pick up here on Wednesday, come to office hours, and I'm up here for questions.

Hi it's really not. Probably the same one you drew. How do you know. I was thinking, I wonder if the way I'm thinking about this is my wife. a second example. What if the doctor reduced the chance of surviving 3%. Yeah.
