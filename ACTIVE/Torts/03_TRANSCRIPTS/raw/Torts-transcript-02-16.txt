I, I just I like. Yeah. OK. Yes. Yeah. I I. I OK, welcome back.

SPEAKER 1
Nice to see you. Hope you had a good weekend. Let's shake it out a little bit and then settle into our chairs into this room. Relaxing your eyes if you like. Closing your eyes. Breathing in. Really taking your time. Breathing out just as slowly.

SPEAKER 0
Again, Feeling your weight settling into the chair, being supported

SPEAKER 1
by it. Being held up by the ground. Breathing out One more time On your own. Taking your time Being in this room OK, when you're ready, gently open your eyes. Look up here. Here's where we are in the course, we are in the section of. The course and also in the section of making a torts case. We're trying to argue that whatever somebody did that was negligent or tortious, we'll see there's other ways to be tortured us next week. There's strict liability, gross negligence, recklessness, trespass, all these things that we will deal with. But so far we've used negligence as just our set up. But every tort case is gonna have to show the connection between what somebody did that's tortious, blameworthy in that sense that you might be liable. That to show that that's connected to the outcome, to the harm, to the injury, to the damage. In some way that we want to recognize in the law as making you have to pay for it potentially. Why are you legally responsible for what happened? Well, you did something, but then that thing is also related to the result in some way that's close enough. There's enough of a tie between what you did and the result and. We, in a way we have some intuitions about this. It'll turn out that there's a lot of this is intuition. And a lot of it is tort law trying to come up with ways to capture the intuition in words in a framework. Last time we talked about how there's two parts to this. Last week we dealt with causation in fact, factual causation. Which is the more analytical bit about. Did it make a difference? Did it matter? Are you a necessary cause? Maybe you're a sufficient cause. What do we do about that, right? That's also meant to capture at least part of our intuition, but we know that's not complete. We know it's overinclusive, under-inclusive in some weird ways. Tort law tries to adjust for that. Proving it is sometimes kind of hard, but yet we know kind of something happened and maybe we should hold somebody liable and what do we do? And then we have alternative liability and multiple sufficient causes and. Market share liability even. This time, this week we're talking about a further part of that analysis which we'll call proximate cause or scope of liability. Which completes the intuition in a way, just by like being a catch-all method. For the jury, for aunt and uncle. To let someone off the hook The idea is that causation in fact is sweeping too many people in and so now proximate cost slash liability needs to let people out. Some of the people who are swept in by just the logic of causation in fact should not be held liable, and there's really not much rhyme or reason to this. There's a whole bunch of doctrine floating around. We'll get to some of that. We'll see the restatement writers try to clean it all up because it's just a giant mess historically. So we'll get to that. That's what we're working on today is seeing how tort law has tried to crystallize basically what is common sense and basically what you're gonna argue to aunt and uncle and the jury. Try to crystallize that in some kind of doctrinal format using words that maybe you can help instruct a jury, maybe. So that's what we're getting to today, and we'll practice using that framework, the restatement framework at least, with a few hypos, just so you get a feel for it. At the very end of class, I'm going to talk a little bit about just looking ahead for what's coming up in the course, so that's what that means, and that sounds a little mysterious looking ahead. We'll look ahead in the course. But the first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna pick up something left over from last time. And that's this question. Of how to divide up responsibility. Among multiple parties, this is gonna be a repeating theme for us now coming up, how do you deal with multiple liable parties? The earliest version, remember we talked about this was like the plaintiffs being liable for their own injuries. Little Leo, he's kind of maybe he should be liable partly for his own injuries, right? Or the swimmer throwing his head into the water without looking, uh, maybe he should be, so we've talked about this already in the form of plaintiff versus defendant, the injured party versus the person being sued, but we can also talk about it, as we've already started to last week, with multiple parties who might be liable for causing the injury. Multiple fires, multiple cars, and not having their lights on, and so on. And what we saw is that as you already know in tort law, and we'll come back to this again and again, in tort law, The way that it's usually divided up if there is a negligence involved in a case. Is that aunt and uncle are asked to just divide up the money. They pick a percentage. They're like you 30%, you 70%, or you 10%, you 30%, you. 60. Remember market share liability, it's a little bit like that, you know, the jury's just making it up. Based on whatever intuitions they have about who's more responsible. The way they're instructed is the judge is going to tell them, think about all the negligence that's involved in this accident. All these parties are here before you. They've all been negligent in some way, or at least 2 out of the 3 or whoever. Think about all the parties who are negligent and think about how much of the total negligence is responsible can be allocated to each. negligent party. In a way you're comparing negligences, right? This is what we call comparative negligence if it's plaintiff versus defendant, but we can call it more generally comparative negligence even when it's across defendants. So tort law does that almost all the time, at least that's how juries are instructed. Juries, of course, can do anything they want, but that's how they're instructed. The thing that we got to last time though is that, wait a second, maybe there's other ways to divide it up. What about this possibility of dividing up who pays based on their causal contribution rather than their negligence or carelessness? How do you compare little Leo's negligence in trying to tap that wire that's electric versus the trolley company's negligence not having a sign? How do you even compare that? How do you even divide it up? How do you say that one's 90 and one's 10? Maybe you can do a better job if you say he caused it more in some sense, rather than he was more careless. You see the distinction. This is the first two parts of our course, showing that someone's careless versus showing that they caused it. Which one might be more useful for. Dividing up The damages in the end Dividing up who has to pay how much, who's responsible for how much. So that's what we'll play with. I'm sorry we didn't get to it last time, but it's a good setup for this week coming ahead as well. So let's do this. Let's just play with some hypos and just remind ourselves a little bit of how it normally works. Hannah Agar, is that right, Agar? Agar Agar. AR. Let's look at this, you know, fires, houses, right? Remember that. So let us look at the first one. You're setting a fire You're a little negligent in setting it. Maybe you're not paying attention to the wind or something. I'm setting a fire. I'm really negligent. I'm throwing on all kinds of lighter fluid. There's all kinds of dry brush nearby. I don't care. I'm just fire, OK. You're a fire. Goes to the house. Burns down the house. My fire goes to the outside garage or shack or something near the house. Burns down that thing. OK. What are you responsible for? Paying for, let's say you prove everything. Everybody, the plaintiff proves everything. Um, I mean I guess if we're dividing by the

SPEAKER 2
amount of negligence then I would be responsible.

SPEAKER 1
I mean, we'll get there. Oh, OK, but just normal torts case. What's happening here?

SPEAKER 2
Um, I mean, I, I think logically just I would be responsible for the house because that's what I burned down. You would be responsible for the, this is two torts.

SPEAKER 1
You torted, I torted. You pay for yours. I, I pay for mine, right? You burned down a house, great, you pay for it. I burned down a shack. Great, I pay for it. Doesn't matter that, because this is your point, right? Doesn't matter that. I was so wildly negligent and you were only a little bit. How much are you paying? You're paying for in this case, no, it wouldn't matter if they're not. You were negligent. That's enough to make you pay and you pay for the whole darn thing. I was negligent. That makes enough for me to pay. I paid the whole darn thing. My whole darn thing is just a lot smaller than your whole darn thing. Fine, that's how Tort works. They don't even have to be close to each other, the house and the shack. Of course, this is not where we're going, all right, so now they are actually connected to each other. Oops, let's do that. Our two fires converge. Let's say that we are multiple necessary causes. Let's say we are multiple sufficient causes. Let's start with that, OK? Multiple sufficient causes. The house and the shack are connected. Our fires each are large enough to burn down the whole thing, house and shack. It's, it's just one big building, right? Just like last time. Two fires converge on the house, each simultaneously are, uh, sufficient to burn down the house. You can't really parse out who did what here, OK. How we tort law treat this? First of all, are we causes in fact? And let's suppose that we're going to be held liable if we are. Yeah, so both would be causes in fact, and then

SPEAKER 2
because you were more negligent, you would be responsible for more of the fire, yeah.

SPEAKER 1
Remember last time we said, OK, both are cause and fact because multiple sufficient causes. We know that's a logical anomaly. Why are we not but for causes, just remind us from last time.

SPEAKER 2
Because if even if I had not set the fire, it still would have happened because you set your fire and vice versa and vice versa, sure, OK, so neither

SPEAKER 1
of us are necessary causes or but for causes, but we're both sufficient. Tort law understands this strange anomaly. This situation plugs it in with for statement 27 says these are called multiple sufficient causes. That's the traditional name, and we're both considered causes in fact. And let's say we have to pay. If we have to pay, we're both being held liable for burning down the house together in some sense. And in that situation where you have two liable parties, are you negligent? Yes, am I? Yes, yeah, so we don't have this one person is not negligent problem that we had fled before. We're both negligent. Tort law deals with this in its normal easy way, which is, as you were gonna say.

SPEAKER 2
The, yeah, comparative negligence, yeah, and who decides? The jury, yeah, aunt and uncle look at this and

SPEAKER 1
they say you were super not negligent. Well, you were only a little negligent. I was super negligent. Um, I'm 90, you're 10, or I am 70, you're 30. Aunt and uncle just pick the number. Recognizing that we both have to pay something. Together the value adds up to what? To 100%, 100% of what of the, the house and the shed, yeah, the whole building, all, all, all the whole, the whole complex, yeah. The plaintiff gets paid the whole thing, you pay some smaller amount, I pay some larger amount, presumably based on our negligence. That's how the jury will be instructed. All right, you know where this is going. What if Back to Elliot. Elliott said, no, I'm just kidding, you're not getting called on again. All right. Now you said More fires, you're still only a little negligent. It's just you, you just, you just didn't account for the wind. Yeah, uh, not that careless, just a little bit. OK. All those fires, every single one of your 4 fires is sufficient to burn down the house. Me over here, I'm piling on this one giant ridiculous fire. It's super dangerous. It's also sufficient to burn down the house. All 5 fires reach the house at the same time, of course. The house is attached to a shed. How would tort law treat this? As it is, as it stands today.

SPEAKER 2
I think that it would still just be treated based on the negligence amount and the fact that I set 4 fires wouldn't matter, yeah.

SPEAKER 1
It wouldn't. Tort law says, what we have is two liable parties. One of them did some stuff, the other did some stuff. Both are negligent, both are negligent to different degrees. Aunt and uncle, you decide how negligent they were relative to each other. Does that seem OK to you? Does that seem like a good, what's, what's the difference between this and, I mean, maybe there's no difference between this and this. Intuitively, um, I mean, I would guess that if I

SPEAKER 2
set 4 fires, I probably am. I caused more of the fire. I'm kind of more responsible for it than you are, so there's some sense in which you're more cozy, right?

SPEAKER 1
Yeah. Why?

SPEAKER 2
Just because I've set 4 times as many fires. So if, if those were 4 separate people, it would probably be treated. Sure, that's the intuition.

SPEAKER 1
The intuition is, wait a second, tort law may be getting this wrong because like in a way you're more responsible. There's some common sense way in which you're more responsible for this whole thing, even though you were only a little negligent, and I was, why is that what we're charging people for? Why is that what you have to pay? That's the question we're, we're playing with here, OK? So let's twist it up just a tiny bit. Riham Abdulnabi. Let's say that with Hannah we were doing a version I'll let you finish eating. Uh, With Hannah, we were doing a version where we were multiple sufficient fires. Each fire was sufficient to burn down the house. Let's go back to this picture on the right and let's say that we're not multiple sufficient fires but multiple necessary fires. And what would that mean? That would mean that without your fire, my fire would not have burned down the whole thing. Without my fire also joining your fire, your fire would not have burned down the whole thing. Each of our fires in a way was like maybe enough to burn down some part of this whole thing, but we don't know which part it actually burned down. What we do know because of the arson sort of, you know, investigation is that somehow our two fires converged, overpowered the sprinkler system together or something like that, and then that's why the whole darn thing burned down. We're but for causes, right? Because but for yours. The whole thing would not have burned down. We don't know how much would have. So in some sense you're a necessary cause for the whole thing burning down, the same with me. And again you're setting it with just a little bit of like inattention to the wind. Me, I'm setting it with this ridiculous amount of fuel and fire and lighter fluid. OK, so same setup except now we're necessary causes. Does that change your intuition any for how tort law does or should treat. The situation on the right, I think no because we're

SPEAKER 3
focused on negligence because that's the thing that we can prevent.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, nothing changes. Same thing you got two liable parties we can't really divide it up, not like it's like I mean it's distinct from that. OK? Here, even though we're not sufficient, each of us to burn down the whole thing. I mean if you had to try to make a case that intuitively this is somehow different, what would you try to suggest that, you know what, maybe tort law should treat this differently. Um, or maybe this is just a different situation in some deep way from. This one where each of us is sufficient to burn down the whole thing.

SPEAKER 3
Maybe that we should just look at the damages and what happened and if one fire just burned more that means you should be held more.

SPEAKER 1
Look harder look harder, investigate more. There's gotta be some way you can figure out that my fire burned down some part, your fire burned down the other part. We know that each fire would not have burned down the whole thing, so it's not maybe quite as sensible to like suggest that we're each potentially on the hook for the whole thing when that's not really what we're talking about. Maybe it's more divisible in some way when each of us is insufficient, right? OK, OK. Now we're getting more at this intuition of like, well, maybe we should um. Divide up the responsibility also in that way, right? We're trying to make this look more like the left. Left scenario See if you can break it up. See if you can break it up, right? That's the kind of something feels a little bit more off about it if it's multiple. But as Riham's telling us, tort law is gonna treat this the same as, same as before. What about this one? Multiple necessary causes now. You're only a little bit negligent. You set 4 fires again, the arson investigators can't figure out what the facts are about. How much house would have burned, but we know that it really took all fires, 5 fires. What it took was 5 fires that was needed to burn the whole thing down, overcome the water pipes, whatever it is that would have saved the house a little bit. Anything different here? We've already moved a little bit as you were arguing towards. Maybe we should try to establish or divide up liability based on who did how much to the house rather than who is more negligent in doing their thing, right? What about here?

SPEAKER 3
I think you would get the same conclusion. I think also when a party's less negligent, there's like less foreseeability, which is maybe something that tort law is trying to get at if you. Yeah, I feel like it's, it's still the same. You're just less negligent, so you don't.

SPEAKER 1
Where would that come into play? How would you use that? Suppose you're arguing to a judge or a judge, you know, we have a new scenario. This is a really weird new scenario in tort law. Let's make some new law on this. Instead of using negligence, asking the jury to use negligence to divide things up, we wanna do what?

SPEAKER 3
Um, using the fact that there's less foreseeability that the less like negligent party was gonna not cause that many fires, um, I mean they're less negligent for a reason,

SPEAKER 1
right? Like it's just a little bit of inattention to win. How foreseeable is it that like, you know. 4 fires though, I mean. But still, right, you can bring in the, say you bring in some kind of argument using what we know and ignoring scope of liability or proximate cause for now, where would that come into play? It would come into play in thinking about how negligent the behavior was. Remember, when we're thinking about negligence, we're thinking about preventing foreseeable harms through the use of precautions, being more careful about risks that you can foresee, and if it's just less foreseeable, maybe it's less negligent. So it's already showing up in less negligent. OK. And I try to argue to the judge one way or the other, saying, you know what, Judge, let's just do this the same old way tort law does. It's basically these two scenarios, there's no difference, and then arguing the other way, suggesting, no, no, Judge, we have a whole new thing on our hands. This is a situation where really what we need to start thinking about is dividing up liability in a new way. Could be something other than causation, but just something different than negligence.

SPEAKER 3
Um So the question is like how else we would divide it if not negligence, um try to convince the

SPEAKER 1
judge to make it up from scratch.

SPEAKER 3
I was trying to think about like thinking about the like the parties that did it, but I think that might get back at negligence and like their level of education maybe with how they know fires work.

SPEAKER 1
OK, so that let's say that's uh let's say that somehow that gets captured by negligence or something like that. Knowing how their fires work, right, that one person is an experienced fire setter, the other is you're. You know, although one of them is a kid, a kid who, right, you start taking these things into account, sure. But what we're trying to get at is this intuition that wait, one of them set 4 fires though shouldn't that factor in somehow and we're looking for arguments for and against that factoring in.

SPEAKER 3
Yeah, I think if you look at it, if they're setting like a lot more fires, they should just be held just liable just based on that, just more liable

SPEAKER 1
or entirely liable.

SPEAKER 3
I think more liable, not liable entirely.

SPEAKER 1
Why and why? What's the intuition that you're drawing on at least they

SPEAKER 2
cause more damage.

SPEAKER 1
They cause more damage. We don't know, OK, we don't really know because each fire was sufficient in some abstract sense, like each fire did the whole thing, burned down the whole thing because, oh wait, we're talking about necessary causes now, so we are pretty sure that each fire would not have burned down the whole thing. So that's switched over. That helps the intuition that now maybe. We, as you were saying about the right side scenario, we want to think about how much of it they did. Suppose we can't have good information about how much they did, well, what's a proxy for how much they did? Let us say we cannot actually sort out how much of the fire, how much of the big house fire was caused by your 4 fires and how much is caused by my 1 fire. We cannot really actually get the evidence on that. What's a proxy, what might be, what's your intuition for how would we try to. Still take into account that You set 4 fires or why would we want to take that into account?

SPEAKER 3
I think It, it just comes back to the point that you're just causing more damage. Maybe if you just set one fire, we don't know

SPEAKER 1
that you're causing more damage, but what? Mm. Because if we know, if we know that you cause more damage, then we're just on the left again. If the arson investigators can truly split up what you burnt down and what I burnt down, then you just pay for your part, I pay for my part. But here the scenario is we don't really know. At the same time, we also know that each of us could not have burned down the whole house. So, And we can't go back to negligence. You could go back to negligence. We're gonna argue both ways, but. You got really close to arguing for something different. What was something different? Something about how much you caused. And supposing we don't know how much it cost, we don't know how much I caused, and yet we know this. What might be a straightforward way to divide it up.

SPEAKER 3
The foreseeability thing, let's go, let's put that aside.

SPEAKER 1
That goes to negligence. Where were you going with this? You, you're about, I, I'm just asking you to say again what you said.

SPEAKER 3
Oh, the. You just the whole like part about you just causing more damage, yeah, how much more? I mean 4 more fires, yeah, so how much would

SPEAKER 1
you pay and how much would I pay?

SPEAKER 3
I think. Like I think 80%, yeah.

SPEAKER 1
We've done this before. It's not a new idea. Think back to market share liability and think about At any point in our discussion last time, did we talk at all about the relative negligence, relative carelessness of each of those companies that made the pills? Not at all, 0 mention. And yet we came up with a way to divide things up among all these parties. We didn't really know how much each one cost, yet we know they all cause some part of it. Back to this. Maybe it's not so strange for tort law to try to use some kind of different division based on approximations of causal contribution even when we can't really be sure. Maybe. Again, you can think through philosophical differences between what's happening here and what's happening here, or what might be happening here, whoops. But why not? Why not think about. Using causation, causal contribution, again, not as an on-off, but as a relative amount. OK. That was where we were headed after market share liability was to say bring it back to the rest of tort law. All right. Let's move on. For today's stuff, Here we are Remember where we've been going all this time, we have this idea that we're trying to approximate causation, we're trying to say who should be held liable based on the connection of what they did and the results, and we have intuitions about it and tort laws trying to cobble together some set of tests in order to make that intuition more or less what the jury comes up with. Remember, jury is a fact finder. They're finding cause and fact. They're finding this other thing that we're gonna talk about today that's proximate cause or scope of liability. You don't have to think of it this way, but One way to think of it is that causation of fact sweeps in all the parties who have some analytical physical connection between what they did and what happened. And then it's too many people, it's too many actors, there's too many things that could actually have. Be traceable, really. To the injury and at some point somebody is going to have to say, you're off the hook, you're off the hook, you're off the hook. We throw you back into the sea. You're free to go. So to speak, OK. Just a refresher again we've just been talking about all these things last time and today we talked about but for causation as the primary analytical vehicle for sweeping in potentially liable parties. Than for The anomaly of buffer causation failing because of sufficient actors, multiple sufficient actors, we have this other plug-in called multiple sufficient causes. We have some problems of proof we dealt with last time about alternative liability and market share liability. And now we're moving on to a separate whole part of the analysis. So all that stuff last time was one thing. This week we're doing something different called proximate cause or scope of liability. The way we're going to think about it in this course. we're gonna think about two frameworks, a traditional framework and a modern framework. This is a little artificial. There are ways you might try to reconcile the two. Abraham tries this. It's a total mess if you aren't already really familiar with both of these to try to understand how they fit together. It's not clear they entirely fit together. The restatement writers are trying to do something a little bit different than you here. But it's useful for us to have at least some of the vocabulary up. I will say already and as you already know, their vocabulary on the old traditional proximate cause side of things is a complete mess. Judges say different words, they mean different things by it. Sometimes, as you saw in the Jones case, proximate cause means the whole darn thing, including causation of fact. Some judges say it that way. Others don't. Sometimes they use legal cause for what we're calling proximate cause. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it's just know that it's out there, that there's all kinds of vocabulary every jurisdiction has accumulated over time to kind of encrusted all these words that eventually formed this giant word salad. By contrast, what we'll see is that the restatement third writers have tried to like get rid of all of that to the point of renaming the whole thing. They don't even want to use the word proximate cause, as you'll see in next week's, uh, sorry, in Wednesday's readings. They're gonna rename the whole thing scope of liability. And then they're going to come up with a one sentence way. To do all the giant word salad. So that's what we're gonna get into today. One of the most important things for us to think about, and this is actually where we're gonna start our conversation, is the question of, OK, no matter what framework you use, whatever doctrinal blah blah you put together, who actually makes the call in the end, whether to let someone off the hook. Aunt and uncle in the jury, it's still a jury argument. It's still common sense in the end, and the way we're gonna get there is we're gonna start with common sense. So we'll walk through both of these frameworks in a second, but first we're gonna set up our. Intuition Both for why this kind of analysis is needed, this extra part, why isn't causation in fact, that isn't that causation, aren't we done? Why do we need some more doctrine beyond that? And then, We're gonna try to motivate the nature of the doctrine that we're gonna use here. What is this extra add-on that in the end is an escape hatch lets people off the hook, even after they're already a cause in fact, found to be a cause in fact? Why do we even need that? And that will help us then understand how to make arguments on and uncle based on those very familiar common sense reasons using the doctrine. So it's gonna be a little bit roundabout, but remember what we're doing is we're trying to say, here's how you're actually gonna argue it, and then we're going to try to plug it into doctrinal terms, just like we did with negligence. You know, we started the first day with just intuition and then we plugged it in. So that's what we're doing here again because it is ultimately argued to aunt and uncle. OK. All right, so let's go to our, um, our classic old-timey case. It's another trolley case, although we're gonna pretend it's a car here. Maddie Flood Will you just remind, remind us of the story of. There's a berry. Versus Sugarnoch.

SPEAKER 4
Yeah, um, so somebody was driving a car, um, and there was a limit to how fast he was able to drive, um, on these roads, and it was 8 MPH. He was driving faster than that. Um, OK, wait, so what's the speed limit and what

SPEAKER 1
year are we in roughly?

SPEAKER 4
the speed limit is, is 8 miles an hour.

SPEAKER 1
OK, 8 MPH. What year are we in for that to make sense?

SPEAKER 0
It is 1899.

SPEAKER 1
1899. OK, so this is not an actual automobile. It is another trolley. There's tracks and so on, but we're gonna pretend it's a car, OK, for our purposes. So the motorman, as he's called in this case, is cruising along at 8 MPH, 6, or faster? Faster, faster. He's blowing past the speed limit at like, let's say 9. Maybe 10 MPH. That's just totally negligent behavior. It's also statutorily negligent, remember, because he's going past the what?

SPEAKER 4
This like statutory statutory speed limit, sure, ordinance speed limit,

SPEAKER 1
right? There's some other regulatory body that set a standard of care. He's already fallen short of that standard of care by going too fast, OK, so if he, right, if he has a duty, remember that, OK, so anyway, let's say that he is, um, acting negligently in the sense of going past the speed limit. What happens to him? Does he just spin out and crash into a tree? Does he?

SPEAKER 4
What happens? There's a windstorm and a tree branch falls on the car and injures him.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah. So let's walk through how to make a tort case. Let's say he's negligent. All right, Matty's already told us he's negligent. Um, is he a cause in fact? Is his negligent behavior of driving at 10 MPH over the speed limit at 8 MPH, is that a cause in fact of this injury? Remember, it's his own injury. We're talking about. Yes, how would you argue that? How would you make the case? Just spell it out. Bill at 4, blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah

SPEAKER 4
blah, or his speeding the tree wouldn't have fallen on the car.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, but for his driving at what?

SPEAKER 4
Whatever, you know, 10 MPH, yeah, whatever, whatever speed above the limit, um, right?

SPEAKER 1
And how would you come in his aunt and uncle? You would say aunt and uncle if he were driving slower, if he's driving at 7, what it wouldn't have

SPEAKER 4
fallen on him.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, he wouldn't have been there at the wrong time. But wait a second, what if he were driving at like 14? It also wouldn't have fallen, also wouldn't have fallen on him. But technically, but for his driving at 10. Over the speed limit, his negligent behavior here is driving at 10, but for that. Accident wouldn't have happened. So here's the cause in fact. So we have negligent behavior. The negligent behavior is the cause in fact of his own injury. Now we gotta argue our way like, does that sound right to you, Maddie? Is that, is that how this tort, is that how tort law should work? Is this what aunt and uncle should do is aunt and uncle should say, therefore, yeah, you have to bear your own injuries or whatever it is that, you know, you have to be paying here.

SPEAKER 4
Not really, I guess something seems weird about it. Say again. I think something seems kind of off about it, yeah,

SPEAKER 1
OK, what seems off if you guys, right, so we're just gonna work with intuitions, avoiding the language of the doctrine and all that for now. Just saying aunt and uncle, look, you know what, like, let's say that you're not talking to a jury, you're just talking to like aunt and literal aunt and uncle. That's goofy to hold him liable for that. Why? He's negligent and he's a cause in fact. Why?

SPEAKER 4
I think if we're talking about like incentives or maybe ex ante incentives, to your point that he could have been going even faster than he was and would have still been fine, um, there's not really anything in holding him negligible negligent here, um, that would. You know, encourage like road safety or or like compliance with the statute.

SPEAKER 1
Let's see what we're trying to do by holding someone not liable under tort law. One of the things we're trying to do is give them incentives to behave better. Is this gonna give anybody incentives to behave better to say that, oh, just because you happen to be there at the wrong time because you were driving too fast, somehow now you would. Change your behavior to be slower and better and within the speed limit. No, because like he could have been driving faster and that would have solved the problem. That's a little bizarre to say, oh, you're liable for driving not fast enough, OK? Something like that. Something feels off about it. Matty, just to help us think through like a little bit more of intuition about what fuels off, let's say that it was a case where because he's driving at this ridiculous speed of so fast at 10 MPH, he loses control, spins out, and just crashes into the tree. Let's say that's what happens instead.

SPEAKER 4
Yeah, I think that's a different.

SPEAKER 1
That's pretty different. Why? Oh, aunt and uncle, this is totally different. The difference is what we're talking about. What aunt, uncle, here's what I think that's maybe you

SPEAKER 4
could say it's, it's less of a coincidence, I guess. I think that, that, you know, I, I think they talked about in the case and I found kind of compelling that. The tree falling on the car was just kind of pure coincidence when it was gonna happen, what the circumstances were kind of from his actions that that allowed it to happen.

SPEAKER 1
Pure coincidence. We don't, yeah, it doesn't make any sense to hold someone responsible for pure coincidence, whether you're thinking about it from deterrence or you're thinking about it like we talk about other aims of tort law if you wanna talk about tort law with your aunt and uncle, OK, but here, but here you're about to say, but here it's

SPEAKER 4
not a coincidence, it's not a coincidence.

SPEAKER 1
It's precisely what speeding is bad. This is why it's bad. This is what we're worried about. This is what happens when you speed. Of course he's liable. This is why we would want to hold him liable. So people don't do this. And now you can start thinking a little bit more in terms of like oh because it's foreseeable you can try to throw on that label to it or because you know this is the whole point of the liability you know start thinking of those intuitions, right? OK. One more, Mattie. So this is going to change things a little bit for us. Again, what we're trying to do is uncover some underlying intuitions, common sense that aunt and uncle might respond to. Let's say that what happens is that. He's driving over the speed limit, 10 MPH, it's 8 MPH, but still too slow for this car that's behind him. This car is getting really impatient, OK? Really impatient. This car aggressively passes him. At the whopping speed of 14 MPH. OK, he gets confused. Disoriented by The road rage driver. And spins out and crashes into the. 3 Aunt and uncle, ah, this is the same or different from Um, I guess it would depend on if

SPEAKER 4
the blue car is, if, if the driver of the blue car's actions is deemed negligent or not.

SPEAKER 1
OK, let's say that, oh, look, this is a terribly negligent thing to do. Not only is he driving at 10 and being impatient and honking and irritating this pink car driver, he then goes even faster. A 14 passes someone illegally, let's say, or something like that. Let's say that. Blame totally blameworthy behavior. OK, then you say aunt and uncle, blue car, totally blameworthy. What does that mean for the pink car's own responsibility?

SPEAKER 4
Well, I guess we could talk about like relative negligence that that the pink car might still be negligent on some level but kind of splitting up liability between the the plaintiff and the defendant. Yeah, you take some of it off of him.

SPEAKER 1
You say, well, he's still maybe, you know, look, he's still speeding, right? and. You know that's not good and he didn't get into an accident. It is like speeding and then spinning out and then hitting, right? We could say but-for causation, we can make up a but-for causation story. If he weren't going that fast, he would have been able to control his car despite the aggressive passer, something like that. So it's still kind of his fault, but what we're doing is we're taking off a load from him. We're saying, oh no, no, actually a lot of this is really the responsibility of that even worse driver, the blue car. See that intuition of like putting it on somebody else. It's really about the other driver. It's really their fault. Maybe it's a little bit my fault, but it's really their fault, OK. Now we've done this before with comparative negligence, but hold on to this intuition because it's gonna come back for our section here because it's such a common sense situation to like shift it to someone else. You might say that the other person is really the cause, like they're really, they're really the one who who caused this whole thing. Something like that. Now do you want to argue the other way? You had a good argument that could apply here for why. You should not be held responsible at all.

SPEAKER 4
Yeah, the blue car, no, the pink car, the pink car. If you want to do with a blue car, you

SPEAKER 1
can. That's hard.

SPEAKER 4
Um, yeah, I think, I guess with the pink car again, it's, it's sort of coincidence that, that this other car happened to, you know, negligently pass them in a, in a dangerous way, um, and then, you know, leading them to kind of. Go out of control, um, and, you know, the speeding wasn't necessarily even a Inherent factor in that, um, given that it was just really like you said, kind of caused by this other car.

SPEAKER 1
OK, so there's two things going on here. One is the coincidence thing again, you know, this is the freak accident intuition which we've kind of touched on before. It's a coincidence. You don't wanna hold somebody liable for a coincidence or for a freak accident. You could maybe come up with some story like that. He smiled out of control and the tree happened to be there, you know, something like that, um. But the other thing you were saying about how fast they're going, let's play with that. Was he going too fast or too slow in some sense, or both, both, I guess. Yeah. So spell that out for us and what does that mean for like whether we want to like make him pay for it? Well, you can talk about maybe the, the kind of

SPEAKER 4
fear of driving on a road and having somebody behind you who's honking at you and trying to go faster than you are and, and sort of, um, maybe making you feel that you're not going fast enough, um, and so maybe you're trying to honor this. Speed limit, but at the same time trying not to cause more danger. I mean, you know, obviously there's, there's just as much danger, I guess, on the road for going too slow is going too fast. So, um, you know, if, if you're worried about that and trying to kind of find a happy medium and then, you know, this ends up being kind of the result of it, you could say. That there's no liability there because the driver of the pink car was just really trying to do what he thought was kind of safest, um, in those circumstances at the time.

SPEAKER 1
OK, great. So you're going, Mattie's going all the way back to negligence and saying, aunt and uncle, he's not even really blameworthy. This is actually not careless or unsafe. Remember, even with statutory negligence we allow people off the hook for doing something that's safer than the statute and look, if people are really like aggressively tailgating you like this, it might actually be safer for you to go a little bit over the speed limit just to like take that pressure off, make the road safer or something so you could do that. But Matty, go back, let's go back to your ideas about like, what have, what, what if he had gone faster? Remember this one? What if he, what if he had gone faster when in that top picture? And what about, what if he had gone faster here?

SPEAKER 4
Yeah, you could say if he had gone faster then the blue car wouldn't have passed and then this wouldn't have happened. We don't know.

SPEAKER 1
We don't know, right? What effect the incentives would have if you put liability on aunt and uncle if you make him like liable for going too fast, that's the exactly the opposite thing you wanna do. If anything, he's not going fast enough. Or you could say something similar to this, like, well, we don't know if he should have gone faster or slower, so well, how do we put liability on him? Something like that. So you see the intuitions being scrambled here a little bit, and some of the intuitions you can see happening are things about it's a coincidence, it's a freak accident, shouldn't be liable, it shouldn't have to pay for that. Something about it's really the other person, something about, well, I don't know, like do we know enough about the situation to put the incentives in the right place or say who was wrong or doing something wrong that goes maybe back to negligence, all these things are swirling around. Let's change the hypo. And see if you can squeeze out a few more intuitions. Navia Gupta Hi.

SPEAKER 0
OK.

SPEAKER 1
You're a bartender I'm at your bar You serve me a drink, OK? And you serve me another one. Serve me another one. Serve me another. Serve me another.

SPEAKER 0
OK, fair enough, all right. OK.

SPEAKER 1
Now I'm pretty drunk. I'm drunk after like half of the first one, but alright, let's say that, let's say I'm really drunk, really, really drunk now, OK? And I look at my watch and I'm like, oh I gotta get to torts. Like this is happening at like 7:30 in the morning. OK, so I get out of the car, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, I'm drunk driving. I crashed into a tree. OK. Or I, I hit, I hit another car. Aunt and uncle, if you're saying aunt and uncle, yeah. Should you be liable for what happened here? Over serving me, not cutting me off. How would you make the case that over serving, let's say we're in a jurisdiction where there is this kind of liability like Hawaii where you know a bartender serves too much, drunk driver injures herself or somebody else, now is the bartender liable? Let's say the law says yes, potentially you do have that duty, let's call it. Let's say it is negligent because you really should have cut me off at some point or taken my keys or something. Aunt and uncle, should this bartender be held liable? Yes or no? In that scenario, um, I think the argument for yes,

SPEAKER 5
I should be held liable is that it is like very reasonable to assume that if you drank a lot, there's no one with you, you're not seeming to like cause a taxi or something when you leave if you are driving back. It's basically like foreseeable that you will cause an accident, you will get hurt. Um, is it a cause of fact?

SPEAKER 1
Let's walk through the causation in fact. Alright, let's say it is negligent as you're saying, foreseeable is negligent. Obviously any reasonable bartender would have taken the keys or. Stop them, cut them off at a certain point. Yeah, cause in fact is the overserving a cause in fact of my accident? Yeah, I think so because you probably won't, wouldn't have

SPEAKER 5
had that accident if you hadn't drank that wouldn't have

SPEAKER 1
been drunk driving. Maybe you can't spike that, but yeah, let's say that is here, yeah, and probably you should be held liable. There's no real counterargument here that's obvious to aunt and uncle for why this is not exactly why, yeah, you should be held liable. Yeah, OK. Let's say the scenario is a little different, OK. Serve me one drink. Serve me another at 7:30 in the morning. Another one, another one, another one, OK. And I get to a certain point I'm like, oh. I gotta get to Torts Um, but. I can't go drunk driving. And I can't teach torch drunk. I, I probably, well, well, I can't, I can't teach torch drunk. I'm gonna wait it out. I'm gonna have to just sober up and then get the torch late, but you know, it's better for everybody this way. Sit there for like an hour and a half. Let's suppose that's not enough, but let's suppose that, you know, I sober up. And then now I need to get to Swartz drive, drive, drive, drive, drive. I'm driving really fast because I need to get to torts. I'm already late. And then I spin out and crash, yeah. What about this bartender? Anything different about the bartender's responsibility here to aunt and uncle?

SPEAKER 5
Yeah, I think that. I would say that I wouldn't be liable then because it's not foreseeable to me that you drinking so much would make you late for an appointment that you would then speed for to get to basically. So why should I be held liable for that? Your speeding is the cause of the accident, not the fact that you were drunk. OK, you see different things going on here.

SPEAKER 1
This is not really, it's not foreseeable. It's kind of a freakish thing that you just did, um. It's not my fault you did that. You did it. You're the one who then like proposed you didn't have to drive super fast. You drove super fast. Maybe everything you did before that was responsible, but that was irresponsible. It's all really you at that point. It's you. Am I still drunk at that point? No, no, right? Did the bartender have anything with to meet? No, it's as if the bartender weren't there. Why? Why aunt and uncle? Should the bartender even play a role in this? He's sober. He's a sober person driving too fast. Done. End of story. His fault. Something like that. Yeah, OK. You wanna argue the other way?

SPEAKER 5
Oh, that it is my. Um, I don't know, maybe that. Uh. Is it 7:30 in the morning? Is it like, OK, let's if it's a weekday, if it's a weekday at 7:30 in the morning, I would be like, oh, it's reasonable to assume that. A normal person is probably trying to get to work and then I should have known better. Yeah, I should have known better. You should have known better.

SPEAKER 1
OK, how does this overcome your point about wait a second, he's the one who who's did it speeding?

SPEAKER 5
Is that maybe by if I had cut you off at your 3rd drink, you would probably have gotten sober faster and then you probably wouldn't have to speed as much to get to. OK, so that's causation in fact, right?

SPEAKER 1
At the very least that's not a causation in fact argument saying that, hey, why does it matter that you overserved me? Well, actually if you had not served me that much, I would have sobered up faster. That's a good argument for causation, and I would not have had the speed. You would have to prove all that, but sure, that's a way to get out of that. OK. Any other intuitions coming into play here saying, you know, it's still, it's still your, it's really. You know, yeah, he's the one who like sped while driving sober, so he's not even drunk, but it's still on me, the bartender, um.

SPEAKER 5
I'm not sure. I think a foreseeability.

SPEAKER 1
Let's say, you know, you're arguing like, oh it's not foreseeable. How are you make a case that it is foreseeable? Obviously it's foreseeable that this exact thing would happen. Or something like this would happen.

SPEAKER 5
Maybe that. Ah, like you've drank so much, so even I don't know, you're sober at this point, right? I have no idea. I have no other idea. It's such a wild thing. I don't, you could try to argue something like.

SPEAKER 1
It is foreseeable that if you get someone drunk they're going to wait to sober up.

SPEAKER 5
Yeah, but and then that ties in with your 7:30

SPEAKER 1
thing, something like that. I know you're fighting it. It's not an easy argument to make. That's how that would work, right? Something like this is foreseeable. You're saying, no, this is a freak accident. This is weird. This is just not how can anybody have anticipated this? Well, a bartender maybe has seen lots of cases like this. Bartenders sometimes make people wait. Bartenders sometimes there's sometimes a, a waiting pen or whatever, you know, sober up area like something. I don't know. I don't know. Student came up with that last year. I don't know. It's true. Don't know, but. It could be something where if the facts could show it.

SPEAKER 5
I think I would then argue the history thing that that you mentioned that if um the bartenders like seen frequently a situation like this happen um then probably there's

SPEAKER 1
like lots of yeah there's bartender has seen lots of people like sit around and try to sober up and

SPEAKER 5
exactly so there's like an increased expectation of risk because the same situation happens again and again so it's foreseeable that it would happen.

SPEAKER 1
That's the kind of factor you wanna have, sure, OK, great. Again, you start to see the intuitions that are popping up again. OK, one more different. Maybe similar but different. Aaliyah, Kirkpatrick. Hi hi. OK, let's say that I'm at your restaurant, OK, and um you are uh. Serving me pasta And here's what happens. I order my pasta. This, I need a carbo load before torts, OK? It's 7:30 in the morning. Um, I order a big pasta. And I waited around and it's not showing up. It's not showing up. It's not showing up. And I imagine like, where's my pasta and you're like, oh, it's been sitting here for like half an hour, 45 minutes, OK? It's a seafood pasta, it's a clam pasta. OK, so it's been sitting out for all this time. Here's the pasta, OK. There's, it's not super sanitary now. There's flies around, OK? The clams have been sitting out getting cold and gross. I do have clam pasta every day before the tourists. I just want you to know. OK, and I'm like, oh, that's not good. Also, there's a health provision, a health food code thing saying that um you can't have seafood lying around for more than 15 minutes, all right, so already you're past that. Let's say that's statutorily negligent. And let's say that what happens is I eat the pasta. I'm like I gotta eat before torts. I eat, OK, and then. I drive my car. I feel my tummy and feeling like, oh, that's not good, and not because of teaching, but because of the pasta. And then I get sick while I'm driving and I kind of I just lose control of my car. I crash my car. OK. The restaurant's liability here. How would you start thinking our arguments like entreago, yes, yes, this is, let's say it's negligent. We don't have to show that because it's already, you know, leaving the pasta out for too long without the right heating or whatever is negligent. Let's just say that's negligent because of this health code. And Causation in fact. Seems like, yes, right, because had you not served me bad pasta, like, you know, kind of already rotten pasta, I wouldn't have gotten sick crash. OK, pretty straightforward. But aunt and uncle, how would you argue, yes, no, this is the restaurants with liability here, it's not the restaurant's liability.

SPEAKER 6
Um, I think to argue, yeah, to argue that it is the restaurant's liability, you can say that like it's kind of foreseeable that if someone gets sick and they like can't drive their car properly, that they, that would, that might cause them harm in the sense that like they might crash or I don't know, die of food poisoning or something.

SPEAKER 1
It could be more obvious somebody's gonna get sick and then all kinds of bad things can happen when they're sick. They're driving a car, they're flying a plane, they, you know, they're standing and teaching tourists and they fall over like any kind, right? Of course this is exactly foreseeable. This is exactly why you don't serve pasta. Sitting around for 45 minutes, half an hour, that has seafood in it. It's some I mean it's so obvious this is exactly the thing that we're worried about. This is exactly the reason we want to have liability. This is exactly foreseeable. This is exactly right. Try to argue against. How would you argue against, um, maybe we're against like.

SPEAKER 6
It's not as foreseeable that the effect of being sick would be so immediate or something like that, like while you're driving away, like after, OK, sure, right, you could

SPEAKER 1
use the fact somehow and say, actually, no, people get sick like 48 hours later. It's this is, this was a weird situation again, coincidence that he had a bad tummy already or something like that, OK, or he's super sensitive and that, OK, something like that. Couldn't foresee that. Sure, that plays in. We'll talk about that later, um. What about this intuition that It's actually my fault. In some sense, is there a way to argue that here, or is that just a little bit hard to work with?

SPEAKER 6
Yeah, I mean, you can argue that a reasonable like person wouldn't eat food that had like flies flying around it. Maybe I shouldn't have eaten it, right?

SPEAKER 1
It's like little Leo. Maybe he shouldn't have been like trying to electrocute himself. Maybe I shouldn't have been trying to get my, OK, so sure, you can always bring in the other side to it too. Alright, but again, the intuition here, it's a little bit different. It's like, can that take some of the responsibility off of you, the fact that I ate this? Well, you're, you know, you're still, you're still the one who's, right? It's a little bit different. Let's change the facts just a little bit, OK? You know where this is going, um. I'm sitting around waiting for my pasta. Where's my pasta? I gotta get the torch. Where's my pasta? Where's my pasta? You bring it out. It's been sitting here this whole time. You bring it out. It's got flies all over it. It's been sitting there. It's not looking, not smelling the best, but I gotta eat. I eat it anyway. Thankfully I don't get sick. But I'm really late for torts at this point because I'm sitting around waiting for a pasta for this whole time. So I drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive really fast, spin out, crash into a tree or something like that, or a car. Are you somehow responsible for this accident, this injury? What's different here in the intuitions that you might use in persuading aunt and uncle yes or no?

SPEAKER 6
Um, to argue no, I would say that like the waiter doesn't, can't like necessarily foresee like what the person has to do after they're eating, like, you know. You're not responsible for their plans.

SPEAKER 1
Who would have anticipated this? What a weird thing to have happened. Like this person like eats a pasta like probably shouldn't have eaten anyway and then like has to speed. Really? That's what we think of when we think about serving pasta slowly or over time is that somehow somebody's gonna have to drive fast? No, no, that's not what we think about, that's not foreseeable, it's not in our minds, it's not what we want to. Create incentives about that's such a weird freakish thing like. It's not gonna help to deter. It's not really wrong, right, in some sense, OK. I'm gonna argue yes. How would you argue yes in this one?

SPEAKER 6
Um, is it still like the morning at like 7:30? Yeah, sure. I mean, I guess using the other argument you could maybe say like. They had to go to work or something like that or you can easily foresee that like they had to get to some other obligation right you bring in Nadia's

SPEAKER 1
arguments about, well, look, you know this person's got a car and has gotta go somewhere, and how hard is it to imagine that if you're really, if you delay somebody and they're like I need it right now, I'm in a hurry that. You know, this is. Going to cause them to rush. But there's still some like something. Is there anything different between this one and. A drunk driving story of like making somebody wait around for a long time.

SPEAKER 6
Yeah, I mean, similarly, like you can't necessarily, well, so you're not sick in this situation I'm not sick, yeah, exactly, right, yeah, so you're just like serving food like there's. Am I arguing that you are liable or not?

SPEAKER 1
Either way, either way, um, yeah, so like you're just

SPEAKER 6
serving food, so there's not necessarily like a foreseeable like thing that there will be some effect from just serving food versus if you're serving alcohol, then it is reasonable to assume that someone will be like intoxicated. Yeah, it's not, you don't, there isn't that your foreseeability

SPEAKER 1
doesn't reach the delay part of like causing them delay, then they need to rush. Maybe your foreseeability has something to do with like I. I held him up for half an hour and then, but the other part is is kind of shifted the facts are a little bit different. And there's less connection, right? There's less connection between the nature of what you did, which is serve bad pasta. Right? Do I get sick from the bad pasta at all? Did that, would that affect me at all? No. Did it, is that responsible for the delay? No. Whereas getting drunk is responsible for the delay. That connection seems to be a little bit thinner, maybe broken here. This intuition that actually it's not the reason that serving the pasta bad pasta is wrong or we wanna like put liability on someone. Does it have, could it possibly have anything to do with what happened here? Right? You can go back to why it's negligent. It's negligent because of the health code. You think the health code is concerned about people having to like be delayed from teaching tours and then driving and then no. The whole point, the whole point is just not to get somebody sick and he didn't get sick. This is some other weird thing that happened. Is it a cause and effect? Yes. Were you negligent? Yes, OK, but. It's not connected in some further sense to what actually happened. And then one last thing, do you want to add on maybe something about, oh, it's really his fault? Bring that back, um, like it's your fault, yeah, um, why in this story might it be a useful thing to suggest, or maybe it's not useful here because it wasn't that useful to the other one.

SPEAKER 6
Um. I mean you didn't have to drive fast. I don't know, like you could have just drove at the speed limit and just been late. You still chose.

SPEAKER 1
There's nothing wrong with you. You weren't drunk. You weren't sick with pasta, food poisoning, nothing wrong. You just chose. You were late. You just chose. That's you. Again, whatever I did violating the health code truly had nothing to do with that. Yes, it's negligent. Yes, there is factual causation because factual causation is overinclusive, but here's a situation where aunt and uncle, it just doesn't make sense, even though the other things that link up the behavior and say it's blameworthy might be there, but they're just not related to this. So if you think through all our hypos, you see the intuitions that are naturally emerging on what kinds of arguments you might want to make at this stage, saying it's still just not the right form of Correcting wrongs or deterrence or whatever to impose liability in this case. Things about it's kind of a coincidence or a freak accident, unforeseeable you might think of it as it's actually somebody else's fault, really they're the ones who really, really caused it, not just they are also responsible, but it's really kind of their thing, that intuition is there as well. And then the third is maybe the one that's underlying it all, which is, that's not what this is about. That's just not what this is about. Saying that someone did something wrong here like serving too much or serving bad pasta or whatever it is, driving too fast, that's about a certain kind of wrongs, wrong behavior. It's a reason it's blameworthy, it's a reason we want to deter it, there's a reason it's something. And whatever happened here is just not that. That intuition we want to hold on to above all. So when we come back, we'll take these intuitions and then we'll start plugging them into these doctrines.

SPEAKER 0
what They I Yeah I. OK, nice meal. I thought this is not a story. Yeah. you. Right off the bat real yeah. I think the park. I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna go board at that park ever again. you Oh There's a. I OK. It's not where. I. Yeah. I I That's. Yeah. I. Thank you. I told you we call each other. Yeah Yeah The like. And that surrender my apartment. Any I OK. I. I don't know why That's great. out. She put it on and she was like, this bitch have you been talking to? Yeah, it was not good, bro. Hey OK, welcome back.

SPEAKER 1
Any announcements? Any announcements? Nope, nope. OK. My announcement is the usual office hours. My office hours will be on, um. Tomorrow, Tuesday 8:30, 9:30, and 9:08. OK, hang on, you have a, you have a review,

SPEAKER 3
uh, just a reminder that TA sessions are tomorrow during the lunch hour in Big Warren 3:10. We're gonna be doing a review session tomorrow.

SPEAKER 1
Review session tomorrow, not office hours. So remember, review sessions are when they go over the last stretch of two weeks of stuff. The notes our official notes are the slides that they create and I go through. And check and fix for the review session. So make sure you watch the review session in person or on video and then be sure you download those slides because those are the official notes along with these things. All right. One more thing I forgot to mention is market share liability. Do you know where this idea for market share liability came from? It came in a way from the California Supreme Court in a case called Sendel, but where did Sendel get it from? It turns out one of the judges on the California Supreme Court had read a student note by Naomi Shiiner, a 2L at Fordham at the time. Naomi Shiiner wrote a note saying, Hey, why don't we do market share liability? A justice on the California Supreme Court read it. Maybe it was sent to them, or maybe it was, uh, it came from, um. The, uh, briefs or something like that, I decided, you know what, that's a good idea. Let's try it out and California became the first to put into place thanks to a twol note. So think about writing a note, no pressure to change all of tort law, uh, like Naomi Shiiner did. But in a way this is really about why we do all this legal design talk that we do in this class and maybe in your other classes. You know, in your 2nd year you're starting to start writing, maybe even you're elected, you're gonna start writing things where you're arguing for a particular position, you're arguing for a change in the law, maybe you're doing this in your LPW briefs, right? Any kind of appellate argument you do will be like this, and you can be in some cases quite creative in coming up with something brand new in an ancient area of law and potentially have a court adopt it. So part of it is just, just to train us to think in that way, to argue for a legal position that may not be already pre-existing. But also maybe someday your note can be picked up in this way. So I just wanted to point out the story of Naomi Scheiner. Back to our two frameworks. Remember this is what we're talking about today is there's a traditional language of proximate cause and the scope of liability is the new language from the restatement, and we're gonna walk through our intuitions and how they show up in these. Rhetorical formats, it's really most useful maybe to think of this at least as a rhetorical format. The restatement maybe has a little bit more analytical structure, but remember the intuitions we're working with intuitions about how this is a coincidence, it's a freak accident, it's unforeseeable, something like that. We shouldn't hold somebody liable for that. Also something like, no, it's really the other guy, it was the other driver. It's I mean, yeah, I, I did something, but like, you know. I should actually be let off of liability because this is so much about the other person's behavior, what they did, OK, that intuition is strong in this area of law. And then the third intuition, which is maybe the overarching intuition is like what happened here just isn't why this thing is wrong. Like we say the behavior is wrong, OK, careless in some sense, but it's not really about that. It's not about somebody having to like. Drive fast because the pasta was that's just not what the health code is about. In a way we've already played with this intuition when we talked about statutory purpose in statutory negligence, OK, so that's coming back here too. So let's see where these things show up. I'm just gonna walk us through the traditional materials. As you already know from the New Jersey jury instructions and from the Jones v. Roth case, there's all kinds of different language that's used to talk about all kinds of different phrases. This is a word salad, this is only a partial word salad of the kinds of words that courts have come up with. You can see how it's trying to transform the intuitions that we have into words that can be used to instruct a jury or a judge can use to like make a call as a matter of law. Foreseeable of course shows up everywhere. The idea that something is remote or like the causal chain doesn't reach that far or the causal chain should be broken, even though technically there is a causal chain. The bar G wasn't there that day, didn't stop the boat from sinking, lost the flour. The flower, therefore, you know, didn't get to the troops. The troops got hungry. They lost the battle. They lost the battle, lost the war, lost the war, lost the whole theater, lost, uh, world tyranny. Yes, technically a but for causation link all the way down, but at some point we break that causal chain. Right, that intuition is quite strong in old timey ways of talking about this. Something's not connected enough, it's not direct from the bar G to world tyranny, something like that. There's also a whole language here that is. Really in a way about Something else happened, and this is where it captures the idea of like, it's really the other guy who did it. Right. The intervening or superseding cause is the blue car that really caused this by aggressively passing somebody. It's not really about. The pink car going at this particular speed over the speed limit. It's really about the other guy. So that intuition shows up here a little bit. You'll notice that Whatever words you really end up giving to a jury out of this word salad. It still ends up being your argumentation using the same common sense that we've been talking about that fills in what does it mean for something not to be direct enough, for something to be an independent cause or a superseding intervene. These words don't have any actual. Meaning themselves. They just show up in jury instructions like you saw in New Jersey. And these can be really confusing for the jury. They end up using their common sense anyway, the argumentation you will make if you were to use a traditional method, you wanna use phrases like these, but in the end it really still has to make sense to the jury. Juries are very easily confused by all this terminology. You saw it in the New Jersey, I don't know if you read the first paragraph that says note to judge, and there's this wonderful passage where it says, hey, look, we recognize there's some problems with what this whole area is called because sometimes when juries hear proximate cause they think of a proximate cause, like approximately a cause, and they're just thrown off by that. So the terminology of the word salad can be a real mess and we'll see that this is why. The restatement writers tried to clean it up with a much crisper analytical structure. Before we move on to the Restatement approach, I want to point out there's one more thing that we want to add. Which Can be thought of. As part of the proximate cause analysis, it is a very old rule. And it's basically unshakeable. And this is a role that cuts against the foreseeability intuition. This is the one as you saw in Abraham where if. You cause more damage. Then you might have reasonably foreseen. Because the person's skull happens to be very thin and you hit him with a stick and you think maybe you get a bump but actually it breaks his head. Thin skull or eggshell, right? Then, sorry, you have to pay for all of it. An unforeseeable extent of harm, sometimes it's called, as you see in Abraham in doctrine, it's called unforeseeable extent of harm. Doesn't get you off the hook for it. As long as the harm, the type of harm, the thing that you did, the breaking of the head is within the liability, then the fact that it was an extremely bad case of that because the person happened to be extra fragile. Doesn't count. You don't get out. That's within the liability as well, OK. The unforeseeability of that doesn't count, so the damage does count. So We're gonna move pretty quickly through this. Mainly I want you to have heard of it. We are actually not going to use this in our class going forward, the traditional method. What we want to do is move to the restatement third modern view and see what they're doing there, see what they're trying to do, see what they do to this in some sense, cleaning it up, but also seeing how is it that the restatement writers one sentence. Can try to capture all these intuitions that we've been talking about and whether it does a good enough job and how are you gonna make an argument based on that, OK. This word salad. I want you to know you're gonna see these words flying around. You'll see it again on Wednesday quite a lot. So it's important to have these words and sort of know that oh these are proximate cause words in the old timey way of doing things. But for our purposes in this class, we're only going to use the restatement. So let's get right to that. OK. Here I think it's useful just to read the restatement language. Scarlett Bach. Do you have a recent statement 29 in front of you? Let's just read it. It seems like It's like one sentence Oh, thanks.

SPEAKER 7
Um, OK, an actor's liability is limited to those harms that result from the risks that made the actor's conduct tortious.

SPEAKER 1
OK. That's it. All the stuff we've been talking about today, all those intuitions, everything is supposed to somehow. Get funneled through this one sentence, all this word salad, all these words that common law judges have come up with over hundreds of years to figure out how well, how does the intuition work here? It's all supposed to show up through this one sentence. So Scarlett, why don't you tell us how would you interpret it in your own words if you had to explain it any more than it's it's already I guess crystallized here.

SPEAKER 7
Um, yeah, so I guess you know it has to be, um. The risk or the harm that occurs must have been directly related to the um tortious conduct. So, it can't just be like a byproduct of um other conduct conduct the defendant engaged in that wasn't actually. Um, tortious, OK, you see how much, how much the

SPEAKER 1
old words have some intuitive pull in the way Scarlett described it, direct byproduct, this idea that's the causal chain is broken. Yes, there's all these old timey words that start to like maybe show up in this sentence, but where are you getting this stuff from? Where are you getting directness and byproduct and all that?

SPEAKER 7
Um, just, I guess like the language that result from the risks, um, from that result from the risks, yeah,

SPEAKER 1
what does that mean? That's a key phrase here. What does that mean?

SPEAKER 7
Um, that the harm or injury must have directly arisen from the particular tortious action.

SPEAKER 1
OK, so what you're saying, how is that different from what causation in fact does? Causation in fact says that this thing has to have arisen from that. What, what that's already taken care of. What are you talking about here when you say results from the risks? What risks? Which ones? And why is that important?

SPEAKER 7
The, uh, foreseeable risks of that particular criminal conduct, um, or not criminal, sorry, tortious conduct, um, and, um. And not just, you know, a sort of an offshoot or an unforeseeable harm that occurred as a result of different conduct.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, but is it just risks that arose from the behavior, or what is it? What does the phrase actually say? Results from the risks that what that made the conduct

SPEAKER 7
tortious?

SPEAKER 1
What does that mean? Made it conduct tortious.

SPEAKER 7
That made it particularly risky or likely to result in harm in this tortious?

SPEAKER 1
What does it mean? What does it mean here? You gotta say, hey, look, let's say this is a negligence case. How would you characterize the harms arise resulting from the risks that made this conduct negligent. What would the, what would be, let's say, let's say, um, let's say we go back to, let's use our examples, let's go back to, um, speeding. Um, well, is this or is this not under what you just read?

SPEAKER 7
Sorry, what was the beginning of what you said? Is this? Oh, well, in this case, it would be, um, It, it would have to be the actual, the speeding, um, the, the foreseeable risks of speeding that caused the particular harm. So in this case, like a tree falling could not have been caused by speeding because that's a completely happenstance occurrence.

SPEAKER 1
Right. But that's how this thing works. Whatever it is that made your behavior negligent, it's because we foresaw some risks that would result from it, reasonably foresaw a reasonable person, right? We're talking about a reasonable person standard. Foresees some risks. And it's the for those foreseen risks that are what make the behavior tortious. When we say someone is negligent, it's because they are not taking precautions against those foreseeable risks. There's some universe of foreseeable risks we're already imagining, say the restatement writers, when we say that someone's acting negligently. Trolley company, if you don't insulate the wire, all kinds of things can happen. It can short out and stop traffic for like hours. A kid can electrocute himself. All these risks, these are all foreseeable risks. Those are the reasons you need to have insulated the wire. That's what made your conduct in not insulating the wire negligent in the first place. And so Scarlett, connect that to the, to the ultimate finding here. So when is something in or outside of the scope of liability here?

SPEAKER 7
Um, so the negligent action, uh, directly has to result in, in the harm and had to still causation in

SPEAKER 1
fact using this word direct, using this word, let's do let's work what what we were doing before. We're talking about what are the risks that are foreseeable, where does that show up? How does that. Where does foreseeability show up first? Scarlett points out that it shows up here. Harm within the foreseeable risks, OK. And if it is one of the harms in the foreseeable risk universe, then you are liable or you're not liable.

SPEAKER 7
Then you are, yeah, and if it's not, then, then you're not, you're not.

SPEAKER 1
That's these two stories. So let's just put this in the language to in order to practice using this language for just a tiny bit. You say this is within the scope of liability, which one is within the scope of liability and which one is not, and just fill in the blanks here.

SPEAKER 7
So, um, it's not within the scope of liability to, uh, the first one is not within the scope of liability, because, um, speeding, uh, or the tree falling was not a foreseeable, uh, Risk in speeding.

SPEAKER 1
In speeding, right? What speeding is trying to take care of is you going too fast and losing control or hitting someone or not that a tree might coincidentally fall on you, OK. What about the second scenario?

SPEAKER 7
Um, in this case, it would be, um, within, uh, it would be a foreseeable risk because You know, driving haphazardly and, and crashing into a tree, um, is, is a foreseeable risk and the crashing into the tree is a foreseeable risk based on driving in that way.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, if you drive too fast, you might spin out and crash into a tree. It's pretty foreseeable. You can argue against it, but like that, it kind of seems to be part of the point of saying you shouldn't speed. Right, so you see what the restatement writers are doing. First of all, we see two parts of our intuition being absorbed here. First, foreseeability shows up implicitly because of tortious, the word tortious. Something is tortious when you're not taking precautions, at least we're talking about negligence, when you're dealing with foreseeable risks and you don't take precautions against it. Or when we talk about strict liability, you're still doing the activity anyway, OK. There are some foreseeable risks. The foreseeable risks are what makes your behavior contortious. Therefore, we're thinking about is the thing that resulted, the harm within the universe of those foreseeable risks which are why we say you shouldn't be speeding or why we say you should insulate the wire or why we say you should have a warning sign in the first place. It is possible for even a directly connected injury. Like a tree falling on you, that's still a cause and fact. Of your speeding, your speeding is still a cause and effect of that injury. It's possible for that, however direct the chain of causation, to not fall within the universe of things that we were worried about when we said that speeding is tortious in the first place. That thing that happened is not what we were worried about. So that's capturing both of these intuitions. Foreseeability shows up, but also our intuition like that's just not what's wrong with serving pasta too late. That's just not what's wrong with speeding. It's not why it's tortious. This thing that happens, it's just not what, yeah, it's late and then you're more negligent and meh, but it doesn't count because it's not why we say that it's blameworthy in the first place. So that's what really the restatement writers are trying to get at here. The one more thing again that I'll add. That we will use because it is so unshakeable. Is the thin skull eggshell plaintiff rule we're still going to just throw that in. The modern restatement does not include it, but maybe it's kind of sitting around in the law of damages somewhere. Regardless, we're gonna use it because it is so ingrained in tort law you can't get away from it. So even if, against what we were just saying with Scarlett about foreseeability, even if the extent of the injury is not foreseeable, it still counts. You have to pay for the whole injury. OK. Again, you can think of this as something outside of this whole framework, just an add-on when we get to damages, but we are going to include it. So here's what we're going to do. We're going to practice just a tiny bit with this intuition. And in particular what we're going to try to do now is we're going to try to get at the 3rd intuition which has not shown up yet. Which is the intuition that oh this is really the other guy. Remember that? Oh, it's really the other guy. We haven't done that yet, so let's see if we can. Here we can think about our designated driver hypo, OK. Moshe Klein Let's think about designated driver liability. Let's say there is potentially designated driver liability. Let's say this is, you know, we had this debate with Hawaii, Hawaii Supreme Court, and the, the question here is designated driver says they're gonna be a designated driver. They don't do it. They totally dropped the ball. Drunk driver goes out there and then has an accident. So let's just say that straightforwardly what happens is that. The drunk driver. Goes out there Crashes into a tree directly. OK. No other car involved. How would we just. Articulate That this is within the scope of liability for the designated driver. That Their negligence and not actually doing the designated driving and dropping the ball, letting the person drive drunk. They should be held liable for this particular accident. Drunk driver goes off, their friend goes off, crashes into a tree. How, how, how do we make that case, uh, using the restatement language.

SPEAKER 8
So I, I think we begin by thinking about the duty that a driver has a duty not to be drunk while driving. They breached that duty and a harm resulted because of this duty that they breached and to get to the final point.

SPEAKER 1
So which driver are we talking? Who, who are we talking about? Who's liability? We're talking about designated driver, right, not the drunk driver. So the designated driver is the person who did not take the keys away from the drunk driver. So let's say you're drunk, you're gonna drive home. I say no, no, no, no, no, don't drive home, I'll drive you, but then I'll let you drive home anyway, that person, let's say there is a duty, so let's assume that duty. And we're going to say my liability for your accident. Has to come from what's wrong with what I did in letting you drive drunk.

SPEAKER 8
So I'm, I'm, I'm trying to assess what is the, uh, foreseeable risk that the designated driver driver is incurring by, by offering to be the designated driver and they're not doing it and they're, they're not doing it. What, um, the, the reason. The reason why, um, why it's not allowed, why is there a duty that exists, it's because the the there's a risk that by you not giving that ride, uh, that the driver will get into exactly the sort of accident that did occur, uh, and that's the reason why it is a proximate cause. It is, uh, it is a harm within the risk that you created.

SPEAKER 1
This is exactly what we're worried about. This is exactly why Hawaii ends up putting in a designated driver duty, saying you need to. Do your designated drivers responsibilities properly because if you don't, this will happen. This is exactly what we're worried about. The drunk driver goes off, drives drunk, gets in an accident. That's exactly what we're worried about, OK. So in the scope of liability language on the restatement, you're saying yes this is exactly the harm that's core to the foreseeable risks which made the conduct tortious in the first place. It's exactly what we're talking about. So now let's say what actually happens though is that something we talked about before, what happens is that Drunk drivers driving kind of wobbly, kind of wobbly, right, a little bit like this. Blue car comes along. They're really frustrated. They don't wanna be near this car. It's going too slow also they aggressively pass the drunk driver. Drunk driver now like loses control, spins out, and crashes into a tree. What do we, how do we, what do we do with this?

SPEAKER 8
I, I, I think pattern, I, I think that the, the core question that we're gonna ask is whether the, the fact that pink car was a driver was drunk caused the blue car to get frustrated, go around, and ultimately result in this accident of driving into the tree to the extent that this is not true what I just said, to the extent that, uh, that was essentially. Independent, there was a third actor an intervening act. Um, it's no longer the designated, uh, the designated driver. They were not, uh, it was not foreseeable to them that this intervening cause would happen. Therefore, the fact that they did not show up and drive, uh, the pink car, um, is not, is not, uh, tortious with regard to this blue car coming in. Um, to use the language of, of, uh, the restatement, right, it's beyond the harm that, uh, of the risk that made the conduct tortious.

SPEAKER 1
Yes, you see what Marshall is doing. Marshall is taking all the intuitions about like, is the other guy trying to fit it in here somewhere into the, well, is it within the scope of liability or not using this very basic framework. And he finds that it fits into the foreseeability question. This idea like it really is about the other guy. Look, this whole first thing, the first scenario is completely foreseeable, that's completely a harm within the risk that is the squarely the risk that we're concerned with, foreseeable. That you're gonna lose control and hit a tree or something. But now it's less foreseeable. The facts have changed the fact that somebody's gonna come along and then like be frustrated and then pass you and then that's what's gonna cause the drunk driver to spin out and then lose control and hit a tree, that's, that's too weird. It's kind of a freak accident. It's a little bit outside the bounds of imagination, unforeseeable. And then what you want to be arguing is that the thing that happened, this configuration of events is not within the things that a reasonable drunk driver would have foreseen being the risks of failing to drunk, sorry, to designate driver would have foreseen to be one of the risks of failing to properly designate drive for the drunk driver is to say. You can't foresee that we don't expect a reasonable designated driver to have expected to have foreseen this configuration, but

SPEAKER 8
I, I suppose that another way to formulate this would be if the only risk that was possible when this designated driver took on the duty to be the driver, if the only risk would have been. That you have a duty to really drive this person home because guess what, this blue car might show up and so on and so forth. That actually was never a duty that imposed, uh, any sort of, uh, conduct upon this designated driver. It would be completely, uh, out of, out of, uh, you know, point of speculation. The only reason why there's a duty to begin with is because of the risk of pink car driving into a tree on his own because he's drunk, yes.

SPEAKER 1
Hold that thought, this relationship of what's happening here with this intuition that it counts within the scope of liability or doesn't count within the scope of liability. Hold on to the thought about how does this relate to the duty question to begin with, right? If it's not wrong to begin with, if it's not even a tort to begin with, right, we're talking about what makes something wrong to begin with. Isn't that also a duty question? Where's the overlap between scope liability analysis and the duty question is exactly our topic for Wednesday. But you see how the intuition works, you can see how you might try to argue the other way. You say, well, of course it's still within the foreseeable range of harms that. Could possibly happen if you don't drive for somebody who's drunk and you're the designated driver? Of course they're gonna lose control on the roads. This is losing control on the roads. How is this not foreseeable? Doesn't matter. The blue car showed up, whatever, any number of accidents can happen. It could be hitting people. He could be hitting, uh, driving off a cliff. He could hit 5 cars. Like it doesn't matter what else is going on. What's mattering is that the risks that you can foresee are exactly that a drunk driver is gonna lose control on the roads. That's exactly what happened here, well within the scope of liability. So you see how the argumentation could work either way, but you see now also where our intuition about the third party shows up, it shows up kind of crammed into the analysis of whether something's foreseeable or not. That's maybe not as satisfactory as the old timey language known as Moshe also use the words intervening, superseding something like that. There's something intuitive about highlighting that possibility and yet as you saw in the restatement illustrations, the way they do it is they cram this into the word foreseeability, which weirdly doesn't even show up in that sentence and yet is implicit. So here's how we're gonna work with scope of liability is basically this framework, OK. One more tidbit for us to emphasize, I'll let you try out #2 for yourself at home, but for #1. Let's go through this one. Moshe, while you're up, let's think through this. This is the Jones case. Remember what happened in the Jones case was that there was basically a car accident. Somebody's leg got hurt. We're not gonna worry too much about the facts about there's two accidents and so on. In the particular way that it happened there with the. Um, mobility device and so on. But let's just take this very stylized scenario up here. Can you read that? I'll read it aloud. Before the accident with Roth, Jones's surgeon made a bad mistake. The leg is more fragile. Jones's leg, her leg is more fragile, and therefore the accident with Roth results in an extra bad injury. So now we're just talking about the very 1st accident. Never mind the 2nd accident, which is what the 2nd hypo is about, you can play with that later. But the 1st injury, the very first car crash between Jones and Roth. Jones already has a bad knee because the surgeon screwed up. And so the injury to the leg is much, much worse than might normally have been expected to happen in the car accident. How will we think through this using our framework here? Well, it sounds like we're, we're, we're touching on the

SPEAKER 8
eggshell, uh, plaintiff, and when thinking in, in, in terms of foreseeability. Um, it seems like what we're getting at is that, uh, once we, once we decide that something was foreseeable, we don't care about the extent of, of the, the type of injury. We're gonna say you have to foresee that this particular person might have a very particular sort of leg that could become very injured beyond what's typical for the type of injury that might happen to a leg.

SPEAKER 1
We're kind of saying you, you need to be able to, well. There's two ways to look at it. The way the thin skull eggshell plaintiff rule works is that even if it's unforeseeable, let's say it's completely unforeseeable to Roth that hitting Jones with a car in a car accident is gonna cause that bad of a leg injury, for somehow let's say that's unforeseeable. It doesn't matter under our framework because of the thin skull eggshell plaintiff rule. And what Bush is saying is that you can sort of think of that as implying that you really need to be able to foresee a reasonable person would foresee the full range of severities of injuries. That's another way of thinking about what's happening here. But this illustration is just to highlight the use of the thin skull. External plaintiff rule OK. Number 2, I'll leave you to do that on your own, that is much more connected with the actual story from Jones and Roth. 2 accidents now. Remember in the first story. Roth was not said to be liable for the 2nd accident because it was so. Unrelated, you might say our intuitions are that it doesn't quite extend to. That kind of later injury happening, whatever reasonable foresight. You might expect that makes somebody torches in the first place in that first car accident it doesn't extend or maybe you can argue that it does extend to them needing a mobility device later and then falling off a bus because of that mobility device something that's how that structure of the argument would work, right? You could take the original Jones case and play with it using the restatement structure rather than what Jones does, which is use the traditional structure. But you can also play with this hypo and see why this hypo may or may not be different from what happened in the actual Jones versus Roth accident. Here is that, The Roth accident makes Jones's leg more fragile. Then the second accident, which happens later, causes an extra bad injury. The question there is going to be, well, does Dan Roth have some liability for the severity of the injury of the second. Accident. For Jones. And then you can work through it with. The restatement framework, keeping in mind the thin skull eggshell plaintiff rule thinking about whether that is actually a case where thin skull eggshell plaintiff rule. Is working or something else is going on. So you can work with that on your own. OK. I'm gonna pause here for a second. I'm gonna turn to talking about a few things coming up looking ahead in our course, OK? Which just to review very briefly because we're gonna pick up from here on Wednesday what we've been doing so far today is talking through this other part of the analysis of what it means for the injury to be related enough to the negligent or tortious behavior. We saw that we need something more than causation in fact because there's these powerful intuitions at work. Doctrine over time has tried to capture these intuitions in a word salad, and then the restatement writers try to crystallize it in a new way, and that's what we're going to use. And we'll do more of that on Wednesday. Here's what I would like to talk about, about looking ahead. All right, we're a little bit past 1/3 of the way through the course. We're gonna be coming up on the midpoint of the course pretty soon, in a couple of weeks. At that point, there will be a practice exam for you. We see it, me and the TFs, we see our job as helping you to prepare for the exam as much as possible. I mean, so much of what we do in class is exactly the kind of stuff you will want to do on the exam, arguing back and forth, arguing legal design, change the law this way, change the law that way, that's the policy question, right? So we will already be warmed up to do both the practice exam and your real exam just from class time, but we will also have these things, these exercises in place, these review classes in place to help with that. So the first thing that's gonna happen is that we're gonna have a review class next week it's gonna be next Monday. So I want to give you some time to start thinking about that. The way the review class works is that I take your questions, you email me questions, say review class questions, this will all be in an email to you. You come up with questions for our review class to cover and for that it's really useful to say here's a new hypo, here's a strange configuration of facts, or here's where two doctrines seem to clash. How do we think through this that helps set up a good review class. Questions that are not useful are like I missed a day on, you know, approximate cause. Uh, can you go over that? That's not useful. I mean, but. Generally if I get enough good questions with sort of a careful design then I can cover a lot of topics including the topics that you may have missed, OK? So that's our review class at that time I will also show you what an exam looks like. I will walk through it. I'll talk about how it's structured and so on. I'll show you some sample answers just to get a glance at it just so you have a feel for what you're getting into with the practice exam. Practice exam will happen. At the end of next week we'll just distribute it to you. You have a week and a half to do it, 2 weekends and a whole week in between. It's gonna be due the Monday before spring break so that the TFs will have time over spring break to work, work on your, um, submissions for the practice exam. The way it works is that it is mandatory, um, but you get out of it as much as you put in. If you put in very little, that's what you'll get back from the TFs, um, but you do have to do it. If you submit it by the deadline so that TFs have enough time to work on it, they will give you individual feedback. They will give you individual feedback not about to doctrine but about how to do exam writing, right? So they will give you tips on actual exam writing, exam strategy, that kind of thing, OK. So it seemed pretty, pretty valuable. I think past students have found it pretty valuable. That's why the TFs wanted to do it again, so we thank them for taking the time to give you all individualized feedback. Later in the course, here's what we're gonna do, OK? I will actually then release all my past exams and sample answers. There will be no mystery, you'll know exactly what they look like. It's gonna look kind of like the last few years. Um, and then at the very end of the semester, we will have another review class of the same structure. So we're gonna have first review class next Monday, which is gonna cover everything up until then, almost halfway point, and then we'll have a later review class covering a bunch of the stuff that remains. And by that point, you will have taken a practice exam. You have seen all the sample answers and so on. So everything will be not mysterious. You'll feel familiar, you know what you're doing, and we'll have practice at all in class. So I just want to give you a little bit of advance notice. The most immediate thing for you to think about is to think about the review questions that you would like for me to cover in our review class on Monday, OK. Always feel free to also come to office hours, ask me questions there, ask me questions after class, and so on. You don't have to save it for the review class, but I welcome your suggestions for review class questions. The other thing I wanted to talk about in looking ahead is this. We're gonna hand out Blank pieces of paper for you, OK? If you don't mind passing these back. Along here, passing this back. Along here, you know, you want to help pass this back. OK, here's what we're gonna do. You're gonna take the piece of paper, OK? If you want, take a piece of paper, fold it in half this way. There's gonna be a top half. There's gonna be a bottom half. On the top half, say anything you would like about this class, right? In a way I'm just collecting your feedback about how this is going, anything that's going well, anything that you want more of, anything that helps you, anything that you think is unhelpful, OK, anything that's annoying you, OK, about this class, definitely. On the bottom half, if you're willing, I wanna hear how you're doing. I wanna hear how you're doing just like in school generally, whatever you wanna talk on and touch on like school life in general. I know the job scene has been bonkers this year. Whatever it is you wanna talk about, about, it's like, here's, here's what law school turned out to be for me. Here's how I'm doing, um, you know, life wise, whatever it is you want to share. I'm open to hearing it. Please keep this anonymous, um, and I will read every one of these. I will read everything you write. So here's your chance to just vent, OK, basically, um, about everything and also to, uh, give some feedback about this course. When you're done with it, um, I will leave the room now, but when you, you're done with it, um, look for this basket up here in the back, drop it in, and then Feon will bring it all to me. When you're done. The basket's gonna be here by the door. OK, OK, cool. When you're done, fold it in half, OK, so that people can't read it, keep it anonymous and just drop it in a basket. Thank you for taking the time to do this. Uh, I know it's a little unusual, but it really quite, I think, valuable for, for me at least, yeah.

SPEAKER 5
Sorry, I have a question. Um, I know that the syllabus, I think mentioned that you will probably make class recordings available to us. Um, will you, OK, will you be making the recordings for classes before the midterm available to us before the midterm? Yes. OK, great. Thank you so much.

SPEAKER 1
Thank you for bringing that up. Yes, of course. I will send out an email when they are ready. Very, very useful to know. Thanks. I'll be standing outside, um, kind of by the stairs there if anybody has questions about today's class or anything else, OK?
