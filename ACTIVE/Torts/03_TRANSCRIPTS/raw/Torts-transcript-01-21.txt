SPEAKER 0
No I But then when they were like, oh OK, welcome. Welcome, welcome. Can you hear me OK? Make sure the mic is on. We'll be using the mics. Remember to use your mic as well for the recording. Welcome to Torts and welcome back to school. Let's start off with a couple of introductions. Bradley Fei Yon, will you introduce yourselves? It's a tort. Well I'm Bradley. I'm also with 2L. I'm also. Great, thank you. Welcome. Um, we have a team of 6 teaching fellows. They'll rotate in class and you'll see others as we come along, but we're very glad to have Bradley and Fay Yang here today. Did you guys take torts at some point? Yes, last spring and which class did you have? I had Monday, Wednesday. No, no, which professor did you have? I'm fishing here. And Fei Yong, who did you have? And how was it? 00, excellent. Bradley. Oh, even better. OK, this is just to say Oliver, thank you very, very much, um. This is just to say that our teaching fellows, all 6 of them, have taken my course. There are 3 2Ls and 3 3Ls. The 3 Ls have already taught it once before, so you have a very, very experienced team. They know everything about how this course works. They know everything about how I operate. They can answer all your questions about one year. About the law school experience. They also understand this is part of their job in a way is not just to be teaching particular subject matter for you, but being a support for you as well throughout this one spring. So please absolutely feel free to call on them for advice, for help, um, any questions that you have. You can also ask me and your other teachers. It is a hard time. This is a hard time during one year. OK, I know 10 year has been pretty grueling so far, and January, February always sucks. It just does. Um, you're not alone, and so this is a time to ask for help when you need it. It's a time to be compassionate about each other and to be generous with each other. It's a time to look out for each other, so I hope you'll keep that spirit in mind and certainly our teaching fellows will, um, as they support you in our class. One thing I like to do at the beginning of every class is just to take 30 seconds. To settle in. And just by taking a few deep breaths. If you'd like to join, I'm gonna do it now, so you might, you might as well join. You don't have to, just don't make any noise. But what we'll do is we'll just, if you like, you can close your eyes or just relax your eyes. And just breathe in more slowly than you usually do, just a little more slowly. Taking your time breathing in. Breathing out also a little more slowly than you usually do. Taking your time Again, I'm breathing in. You can count if that helps you. Right, hold your breath for just a moment at the top of the breath before letting it out. Breathing out As you do, you feel your body settling into your chair. You're here in this room. You feel the weight of the ground beneath you. Living outside things outside. You're present here in this room. One more breath just on your own time. Take the time that you need. Hey When you're ready, you can open your eyes, look up here. I hope that was all right. It's very helpful for me, so we'll just do that at the top of class every day. Should we get started? Not torts. Elizabeth Betts, can you see it from where you are? I know it's kind of small, but yeah, can you see it? Yes, yeah, would you mind turning your mic and just reading it for us?

SPEAKER 1
OK, since it's here.

SPEAKER 0
I am your readings. Don't worry.

SPEAKER 1
All right, I am satisfied in nature whose motive in this case should stir me most, to my revenge, but in terms of honor, I stand aloof and will know reconcilement till by some elder masters of known honor I have a voice and precedent of peace to keep my name ungored. But till that time I do receive your offered love like love and will not wrong it. Thank you.

SPEAKER 0
All right. Makes perfect sense, right? What's happening here?

SPEAKER 1
Um, honestly, to read it.

SPEAKER 0
Are they speaking to someone? Are they speaking to themselves? What's going on in their head? Any idea?

SPEAKER 1
I don't, I feel like the first clause is kind of like I am satisfied in nature is to myself, but then. The last two sentences, it sounds like they're speaking to someone else, but I'm not a poet, you know, I'm not a poet, so I don't know.

SPEAKER 0
I am satisfied in nature whose motive in this case to stir me most to my revenge, but in terms of honor, I stand aloof and will no reconcilement till by some elder masters of known honor, I have a voice and precedent of peace to keep my name on guard. But till that time, I do receive your offered love like love and will not wrong it. Any idea what they think, what they, what does this person care about? Yeah, I mean it's you, so.

SPEAKER 1
What do I care about? Um, What do they care about? Peace, serenity, um, being true to other people, like they won't wrong. They're offered love, like love.

SPEAKER 0
Peace, being true will not wrong it. I will treat your offered love like love. I'll take it in good faith. Serenity, right? But it takes some work, right? For this person to want that. Why? What else are they speaking about?

SPEAKER 1
Um, I mean, they wanna, uh, preserve themselves. They wanna keep their name on gored. They wanna keep their name on Gore. Um, there's something with revenge. Revenge, honor. Yeah, they care about their honor. They care about their honor.

SPEAKER 0
They say twice.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, they can't reconcile with anyone. Will no reconcile will not reconcile, and yet, and yet,

SPEAKER 0
oh. And yet, I will receive your offered love like love. But till that time, right, there's a twist in here, something's happening, something's changing. For this person. As you're talking Some kind of conflict maybe. Going on inside them. Let me give you all a little more context for this. Fayon Bradley, will you help me hand out. One of our handouts. Thank you. Awesome. Thanks. Elizabeth, will you read the part of Laertes when you get it? Anna buy him. Oh Anna, will you take the part of Hamlet when you get it? That's what didn't I say that?

SPEAKER 1
I said that I said I said it was, I didn't say Hamlet. I said Shakespeare. Should I wait on everybody to get it? I should wait?

SPEAKER 0
All right, while it's going around, let's hear from Anna as Hamlet and from Elizabeth as Laertes Laertes.

SPEAKER 2
Right. Hamlet. Give me your pardon, sir. I've done you wrong, but pardoned as you are a gentleman. This presence knows, and you must needs have heard how I am punished with sore distraction. What I have done that might your nature, honor, and exception roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness. Was it Hamlet wronged Laertes? Never Hamlet. If Hamlet from himself be taken away, and when he's not himself does wrong Laertes, then Hamlet does it not. Hamlet denies it. Who does it then? His madness, if it be so. Hamlet is of the faction that is wronged. His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy. Sir, in this audience, let my disclaiming from a purposed evil free me so far from your most generous thoughts that I have shot mine arrow o'er the house and hurt my brother.

SPEAKER 1
I am satisfied in nature, whose motive in this case should stir me most to my revenge, but in terms of honor, I stand aloof and will know reconcilement till by some elder masters of known honor I have a voice and precedent of peace to keep my name ungored, but till that time I do receive your offered love like love and will not wrong it.

SPEAKER 0
Thank you. Well read, both of you. OK, what more do we know now? Ana, do you wanna start us off? What more do we know than before?

SPEAKER 2
Um, we now know who he's speaking to.

SPEAKER 0
OK, who's he speaking to? Hamlet. It's Hamlet. It was Larry Ortiz speaking to Hamlet. What does Hamlet have to say? What's the setup? What's the backstory here? As far as we know, we have just a little more context, not much, but just a little more.

SPEAKER 2
So Hamlet has is doing something, um, wronged Laertes from like what we have here, we don't really know exactly what he has done, but he kind of blames it on his madness.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah, Hamlet says, yes, I wronged you, but uh, did I really, did I? It wasn't me, it was my madness. If it was my madness, it's not me. If anything, I'm wrong by my madness. Right? Hamlet's conflicted as well. If you know the story of Hamlet, you don't have to. If you know the story of Hamlet, you know, big question in the play, is he actually mad or is he not mad? We don't know. But here he's trying to figure it out, or at least he's calling on that possibility to excuse himself. And what does Laertes have to say? Elizabeth, at this point, what is, how do you understand what you just read for all of us in this context, there's a little more backstory.

SPEAKER 1
Yes, well, now I'm thinking that Laertes is like lowkey mad at Hamlet, but he's like, OK, I'm going to accept, uh, what you're saying and I'm, I'm gonna treat you with, with kindness.

SPEAKER 0
Emma says, I've hurt you, my brother, and Laertes says, OK. OK, I will receive that love like love. But my honor, my honor is still, my name is still gored. I'm gonna, I'm gonna have to wait until my name is Ungored. Before I can have this reconcilement at the level of my honor. Here in this conversation, OK, OK. But there's something else at stake. Not ready for that yet. And whatever it is Hamlet's just said isn't enough. Anna, what else do we infer about the relationship between these two? Anything you picked up as you were thinking through it? Mm Um, Hamlet calls him his brother, whether that's not

SPEAKER 2
necessarily like it probably isn't like familial, but it is, it, there's some sort of deeper connection there.

SPEAKER 0
There may be a deeper connection. Right? We're puzzling over the word brother, we're puzzling over the word honor and name and gourd, all these words that we think we know what they mean, but in this context, maybe they mean something else, maybe not literal brother. Ungore, no one knows what that word means. If you had to guess, what would you guess ungored means?

SPEAKER 1
Uh, if I had to guess, like, he doesn't want his name tainted in any way, I guess. Yeah.

SPEAKER 0
Gored sounds bad and ungored means less bad and he wants his name less bad in some way, right? Untainted in some way, something about his honor, his name has been tainted, you can gather from trying to piece that together. So whatever it is that Hamlet did, Anna, what do you think might have been that wronged Laertes? I mean, he's saying I wronged you. What could it be? I mean, we don't know what it is, but. What might it be?

SPEAKER 2
Um, could it have something to do with his sister Ophelia.

SPEAKER 0
Who's Ophelia? What's going on? Who's sister?

SPEAKER 2
Laertes, but they're brothers, right?

SPEAKER 0
So Ophelia's Hamlet's sister as well. No, oh, they're not. They're not, no, definitely not Hamlet and Ophelia. Definitely not brother and sister. What do, do you remember any? You don't have to, right? But bring, bring, bring what you know. Um, to be honest, not really.

SPEAKER 2
Oh wait, is it also his father? I think like he kills his father. There's some father involved.

SPEAKER 0
Wait, who kills who?

SPEAKER 2
Like, I don't remember that much.

SPEAKER 0
All right, but you were suggesting that someone's there's a sister involved. There's a father involved. All right, let's, let's map this out. This may be helpful for our understanding. There's Hamlet. There's Laertes. Laertes has a sister named Ophelia and somebody who has a father.

SPEAKER 2
Laertes and Ophelia have a father, father, but who has,

SPEAKER 0
who, whose father are you talking about?

SPEAKER 2
Um, Laertes and Ophelia's father.

SPEAKER 0
Laertes and Ophelia's father, OK, and. There's a father involved. We'll just call that person P for no particular reason. His name may or may not be Polonius. OK. And then wait, somebody's, somebody's father is killed. Yeah, whose father was killed? Polonius. Polonius. Everyone's father was killed, by the way, in this play, as you may or may not know, but Polonius, Polonius is killed. Who might have killed Polonius, the father of Laertes and Ophelia. Hamlet. Hamlet might have killed Polonius. Wait, if that's the wrong, what's going on here? What's going on here? Andre Fernandez, can you make any sense of what Laertes is saying? If Hamlet has killed. Laertes's father. What is this? Does some of it make more sense? Does some of it make less sense? I think it makes more sense to me. Uh, makes sense. Well, it sounds like, um, that is the wrong that they're talking about, and it seems like the honors, his honor is somehow tied to the fact that, uh, Hamlet killed a family member, specifically his father. That's certainly a front to his honor, OK. Does that help us understand what? What whoever wrote this may be saying with to keep my name ungored. How does Hamlet kill Polonius? Hamlet stabs him. Is Gore's the father. Of Laertes and Laertes it says until my name could be ungod. Right? That's a slap in the face to Hamlet. But what about the rest of it, Andre, how can this make sense? You killed my father, but I received your love like love. I would not run it Yeah, it seems pretty nice. Is he out of his mind? I mean, really? I guess this is some sort of form of forgiveness, um, in an extreme sense, um. Partial, right? Partial, there's the whole honor thing, the family name thing, that you killed my father thing, but you know, given what Hamlet just said, oh, it's not me, it was my madness, uh. OK, a receiver, really? I mean it does, it does sound extreme. We have to decide whether we believe it or not. We have to decide whether we believe Handler or not. We have to decide whether we believe Laertes or not. We have to decide whether we believe the storyteller here or not, whoever that might be. Whoever wrote this. OK. There is some question about Ophelia. Anna was there more you wanted to say about Ophelia? Anything some sister involved?

SPEAKER 2
Um, Yeah, I mean that kind of like doubles the wrong, I guess if it's not just his father but also his sister.

SPEAKER 0
Wait, Hamlet kills Ophelia too.

SPEAKER 2
No, well, indirectly, maybe, maybe unfair, but Ophelia has died.

SPEAKER 0
Yes, so this part of Laertes is grief. This guy's in a bad, bad, bad place and a lot of it has to do with Hamlet. We're not super sure what exactly hypothesis now is that Laertes's father was killed by Hamlet. We're trying to make sense of this. Let me give you a little more context. All Bradley, Fong, will you do another round? Getting your steps in today. Thank you. All right. While these are going around, I'm gonna assign some parts. Elizabeth, you're still Laertes. Anna, you're still Hamlet. Andre, will you take the role of Andre Fernandez? Will you take the role of Osric? There's only one line and then Horatio at the end, which are truly the best lines. Sarah Lee, will you take the role of Claudius? And where's Sarah? Oh, there you are. Hi. And uh William Bay, will you take the role of Gertrude, William, Gertrude. And I'll, I'll read the stage directions. And let me explain what you have now. You have 2 handouts. The first handout is page 1. The remaining handout is 4 pages, pages 2 through 5, OK? So it's continuous, page 1 and then page 2345. All right, shall we get started? I know not everybody has it yet, but we're just gonna start off with page one, which you've already heard. So Hamlet and then Laertes. Starting on page one.

SPEAKER 2
Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong, but pardon, as you are a gentleman. This presence knows, and you must needs have heard how I am punished with sore distraction. What I have done that might your nature honor an exception roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness. Was it Hamlet wronged Laertes? Never Hamlet. If Hamlet from himself beta away, and when he's not himself does wrong Laertes, then Hamlet does it not. Hamlet denies it. Who does it then? His madness, if it, if it be so, Hamlet is of the faction that is wronged. His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy. Sir, in this audience, let my disclaiming from a purposed evil free me so far in your most generous thoughts that I have shot mine arrow o'er the house and hurt my brother.

SPEAKER 1
I am satisfied in nature, whose motive in this case should stir me most to my revenge, but in terms of my honor, I stand aloof and will no reconcilement till till by some elder masters of known honor, I have a voice and precedent of peace to keep my name ungored, but till that time, I do receive your offered love like love and will not wrong it.

SPEAKER 2
I embrace it freely, and will this brother's wager frankly play? Give us the foils. Come on.

SPEAKER 1
Come, one for me.

SPEAKER 0
OK, pause for a second. What is happening? Fencing begins. This whole conversation is like at the gym. And they're gonna, they're gonna start fencing. This was all to clear the air before a little bit of fencing, or so it seems. Fencing begins. And then there's somebody named Claudius, King Claudius.

SPEAKER 3
Set me the stoops of wine upon that table. The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath, and in the cup and union shall he throw, richer than that which 4 successive kings in Denmark's crown have worn.

SPEAKER 2
Come on, sir, come, my lord.

SPEAKER 0
More fencing. Hamlet scores a point. A hit, a very palpable hit. Well done, Osric.

SPEAKER 3
Stay in in the movie, by the way, the Kenneth

SPEAKER 0
Branag version, Osric is played by Robin Williams. Robin Williams has just like two lines, and that's one of them, so. High standards, Andre.

SPEAKER 3
Stay, give me drink. Hamlet. This pearl is thine. Here's to thy health. Give him the cup.

SPEAKER 2
I'll play this bout first. Set it by a while.

SPEAKER 0
Come, more fencing. Hamlet scores another point.

SPEAKER 3
Our sun shall win.

SPEAKER 4
He's fat and scant of breath. Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows. The queen carouss to thy fortune, Hamlet.

SPEAKER 2
Good madam. All right, pause for a second.

SPEAKER 0
What is happening? All right, they're at the gym there's fencing going on. They just had this little thing about like, oh, you killed my father but it's OK or something like that. Suddenly there's a king and queen in their presence. It turns out they're fencing for an audience, the king and queen, there's some betting going on, there's a party, there's a drink. King put something in the drink. The king refers to our son. Who's our son? Andre, any ideas? What's the king referring to? Who's our son shall win? Is it Laertes, or Hamlet? Since we've determined that Laerte's father has died, I would guess that that's Hamlet. OK, you're guessing it's Hamlet. You're correct. Although the reasoning applies to Hamlet too. Turns out Hamlet's father has died. So who's Claudius? And how's Claudius related to Hamlet and why are they all betting on these two fencing it out whatever, you know, issues they had, they're fencing it out. And the queen Queen says he's fat and scant of breath. Here, Hamlet, take my napkin. OK, so she's, it's clear that she's referring to Hamlet when Claudius says, our sun shall win. She's like, Here, Hamlet, take my napkin because you're sweaty. OK. Anna, did you want to pitch in something about what, who, who, who your parents are, why people are referring to you as their son?

SPEAKER 2
Um, this is particularly interesting because Gertrude is Hamlet's mother biologically. Claudius is his uncle, but has married his mother after his father died. OK, all right, Hamlet's father is actually dead.

SPEAKER 0
So, OK, so adopted, all right, all right, now it makes sense. Cle Claudius is like, our son shall win, and Gertrude's like, Here, take a napkin because you're sweaty. Our son Hamlet, and she's talking to her actual son, OK, or biological son. Hamlet says, good madam. OK, all right, so it sort of makes sense. Pink Claudius, now.

SPEAKER 3
Gertrude, do not drink.

SPEAKER 4
I will, my lord, I pray you pardon me.

SPEAKER 3
It is a poisoned cup. It is too late! Whoa.

SPEAKER 0
OK, so whatever Claudius put in, he says union, it's pearl. The pearl dissolves, it's poisoned. The cup is poisoned. Claudius, who are you offering the cup to? Originally.

SPEAKER 3
I was giving it to Hamlet as a toast to his health. You were giving it to Hamlet.

SPEAKER 0
You put in the thing you were about to give it to Hamlet to toast him for his health, to wish him luck in this fencing duel with this, this other guy. Why would you give Hamlet a poisoned cup? He's your son. You're like, our sun shall win. Here's a poison cup. Does Hamlet know it's poisoned?

SPEAKER 3
Probably not.

SPEAKER 0
I don't know. Does Gertrude, she's about to drink it. He's like, don't drink it, Gertrude, don't drink it, queen. It's not for you.

SPEAKER 3
Uh, she says, I pray you pardon me. So I'm guessing she does know that it is.

SPEAKER 0
She may or may not know. tainted. One of the great ambiguities in the play. Does Gertrude know that? The king she married after her own husband died, who was the king. is about to poison her own son. Is that why she drinks it instead? Does she suspect? Does she not know? Maybe she's just having a great time. Hamlet, wipe your brow here. Oh, wine. Great, I'll drink it. I'll drink to your health. Don't know, right? We don't know. Does she know? How much does she know? But the big question is what is Claudius doing trying to kill Hamlet? What is happening there? All right, let's see what else goes on. Let's see if Hamlet drinks it. King Claudius says, it is the poison cup, it is too late because she's just drunk it. Hamlet says, I dare not drink yet, madam, by and

SPEAKER 2
by. Not yet, not yet, not for me.

SPEAKER 0
More fencing. Laertes wounds Hamlet. Then in the scuffling they change Rapier and Hamlet wounds Laertes. OK, I don't know how fencing is supposed to work in wherever this is, let's say Denmark, uh, rotten state of Denmark in whatever century, but fencing is not supposed to wound you. Because those are not supposed to be real swords with pointy points, right? They're supposed to be like spoons. And yet Laertes has wounded Hamlet. Hamlet has in the scuffle, gotten the sword that Laertes was using. And wounded Laertes. Something's, something's wrong here. Lots of things are very, very wrong here. This is not just a friendly match with people betting and drinking to their health. Osric How is it, Laertes?

SPEAKER 1
Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric, I'm justly killed with mine own treachery.

SPEAKER 0
OK, what is going on there? Osric checks in on Laertes. Laertes says, I'm a dead man. I just got caught in my own trap. What do you think you're referring to, Laertes? What's the trap?

SPEAKER 1
Um, I guess to your point of like if it's a fence, if you're fencing, you're not supposed to have a point, and so he had a point on his.

SPEAKER 0
He's like, I had an actual sword. Maybe I was gonna kill Hamlet with it. But he got me. Queen Gertrude falls. Why? Because she drank from that cup. Queen Gertrude falls, Hamlet.

SPEAKER 2
How does the queen She swoons to see them bleed.

SPEAKER 4
No, no, the drink, the drink. Oh, my dear Hamlet, the drink, the drink, I am poisoned.

SPEAKER 0
OK. Once more with feeling.

SPEAKER 4
No, no, the drink, the drink, oh, my dear Hamlet, the drink, the drink, I am poisoned.

SPEAKER 0
Wow. I sort of regret I asked. Queen Gertrude dies from the poisoned cup. Hamlet realizes what's happening. Hamlet, oh villainy, ho, let the door be locked.

SPEAKER 2
Treachery, seek it out.

SPEAKER 1
It is here, Hamlet, Hamlet, thou art slain. No medicine in the world can do thee good. In thee there is not half an hour of life. The treacherous instrument is in thy hand, united and envenomed. The foul practice hath turned itself on me low. Here I lie, never to rise again. Thy thy mother's poisoned. I can no more. The king, the king's to blame.

SPEAKER 2
The point and Venom too. Then Venom, do thy work.

SPEAKER 0
And now Hamlet stabs King Claudius with the poisoned sword. It's not just an unabated sword that can wound you, it's actually poisoned, and now Hamlet has. Poison the king with the same sword. All.

SPEAKER 3
Oh, yet defend me, friends, I am but hurt.

SPEAKER 2
Here thou incestuous murderous damned Dane, drink off this potion. Is thy union here? Follow my mother.

SPEAKER 0
So Hamlet is forcing the drink on Claudius as well as having stabbed him with a poisoned knife. There's two poison.

SPEAKER 1
Oh, I died. He is justly served. It is a poison tempered by himself. Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet. Mine and my father's death come not upon thee, nor thine on me.

SPEAKER 0
And Laertes dies.

SPEAKER 2
Heaven make thee free of it. I follow thee. I am dead, Horatio, wretched queen, adieu. You that look pale and tremble at this chance, that are but mutes or audience to this act. Had I but time, as this fell sergeant, death is strict in his arrest. Oh, I could tell you, but let it be, Horatio. I am dead. Thou livest. Report me and my cause aright to the unsatisfied. The rest is silence.

SPEAKER 0
Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince, and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest. Wow, well read all of you. Thank you very, very much. Thanks for playing. incredibly touching scene at the end always gets me. What more do we know now? What more do we know now? Sarah, if you had to piece together the story a little bit more for us. What changes in our understanding of what has happened and what changes in our understanding of this original passage that we were reading.

SPEAKER 3
Sure. So, in this original passage, it appears that Laertes is saying that the situation at hand should drive him to revenge, but that based on his personality and the historical precedent he set of peace, he wasn't going to pursue revenge. Um, in the fencing, we see that. That wasn't the case.

SPEAKER 0
It wasn't true at all. I will receive your offered love like love and will not wrong it. And he's saying this as he's about to kill Hamlet with a poisoned sword. I shall be satisfied in nature when like someone else restores the honor when some institutions, some elders. Through some process delivers me that remedy is that really what he's waiting for? Is that really what he wants?

SPEAKER 3
Seems like it was to have Hamlet be off guard while he was planning his next steps.

SPEAKER 0
Maybe this is just a head fake. The whole thing was like, oh, don't worry, it's all good, all good. We'll, there will be some like tribal elders, you know, kingdom elders who will like say their thing, and then my honor will be back. Meanwhile, love like love, all good. And he's about to kill him. He's not waiting for. An institution to step in. He's taking it into his own hands very literally. William. What more do we know? What would we wanna know. But mysteries remain.

SPEAKER 4
Um, I guess I'm curious why, or like if Claudius and Laertes were like, they were both trying to kill Hamlet, I guess, but it seemed like separately. So were they working together together were they not?

SPEAKER 0
Claudia certainly knows what happens to Laertes. He may be suspecting or maybe he may maybe he's in on it, on the poisoning of the swords, it's at the royal gym after all. The referees they're checking things out and somebody let something slide like a pointed tip maybe with some poison on it. Is this a whole setup? Did they double up? Let's get to the original question, why are we so, why is Claudia so keen on killing Hamlet? What could be going on there that we still don't know. William, if you have to imagine what could it be? I mean, what he's, he's married the mother. There's a kid, calls him his son. Yeah, maybe he's teaming up with Laertes to take revenge or to kill him for what other other reason.

SPEAKER 4
Um, totally guessing, but maybe he could see Hamlet as like a threat.

SPEAKER 0
Maybe Hamlet's a threat. Amy Hamlett's after him. We don't know. Let's run through some of the words we were puzzling over. And let's think about what happens if we just add in one more fact. Let's take son and brother. Claudius calls Hamlet. Our son That sort of makes sense because according to Anna we've Some backstory about how he married Gertrude, who is Hamlet's mother. Hamlet's father is dead. She's an adopted son. But what if I tell you that Claudius killed Hamlet's father? But I tell you that Hamlet. The father Hamlet, also named Hamlet, was killed by his own brother Claudius, who usurped his throne, married his wife, and now is dealing with his kid. Does that make more sense as a threat, does that make more sense? As wondering whether Hamlet knows, whether wondering whether Hamlet is. After Claudius? What if I told you that whole chunk of the play is about Hamlet trying to prove it, trying to prove that Claudius killed his father, his own brother, right, Claudius's own brother to take the throne. He does it with the play within the play and all that, you might remember from what you might know of Hamlet. And Claudius knows that Hamlet has been trying to show that he killed. The former King, Hamlet's father, the whole time. That's somebody you want to get rid of. Maybe it starts to make more sense. What about the word brother? We heard that there's a sister, Ophelia. Hamlet calls Laertes' brother. There's a sister named Ophelia who is the actual sister of Laertes. Hamlet is not related to Laertes or Ophelia as far as we know. Oh, but Hamlet was going to marry Ophelia. That shed some light. On that use of the word brother. Son in the deepest, darkest, most ironic way, brother in the most aspiringly hopeful way. See me as a brother. I was going to marry your sister. Even though I killed your father, you know. Bye. They are endless mysteries to Hamlet, far beyond, even if you saw the whole play, even if you knew the whole story, even if you saw all different versions of it, it's, you know, performed in all kinds of different ways with all kinds of different interpretations, there will continue to be questions. Including just a fundamental question here is Hamlet suffering from madness? Is that responsible for what he's done? Is he not responsible himself? That remains the mystery, but there's many, many other mysteries, and so we can puzzle through these forever. We can always add on more story, more context, make more guesses, see things that make more sense, see things that make less sense. But we won't Because that's the point of the play, to leave some of these things open. There is one last question though that we really have to address. Which is why on earth did we just do this? Why don't we just spend the first part of the first day. Of to class. Doing this little reading exercise. You may already have been wondering. You may have reasons in your mind, but I have 5 reasons for why we chose to do this, why we spent this time. Instead of talking about torts. And they have to do with how I hope we'll be in this classroom. The first, of course, as you probably already guessed, is that class will often feel like this. It will often feel like a theater exercise, collaborative theater is one way of thinking about it. I'll be asking you to take on roles. I'll be asking you to use your imaginations, step into the role, you know, commit to the bit, as the kids say, right? And just take it on, argue this, and then I'll ask you to argue exactly the opposite. I'll ask you to be Laertes and then Hamlet. I'll ask you to be the Claudius and then Hamlet. And I hope you'll bring a spirit of openness to that, to playing that role, to be part of the theater. Why do we do that? It's skills building. The kind of roles I'll ask you to be taking on will almost all be lawyerly roles. Argue it this way, argue it that way, argue it this way with doctrine, argue it that way with doctrine, argue it this way without doctrine to a jury, argue it this way without doctrine to a jury. Just skills building. In order to Do that well. I hope you'll bring yourself to it. The flip side of that, of course, is to be generous. That's Professor Manand. To be generous as others are playing these roles, we have these amazing readers today. And they were puzzling through their lines for the first time and we were generous about it. We wanted to understand, we wanted to help them, we saw them get better and better with each reading. Let's be generous in the same way as we go through our classroom exercises. Put more facts. This is a question that is going to come up all the time in torts class. Torts is heavily, heavily fact driven. It is a lot about applying facts to the law. It's using the facts that you have. It's about inferring facts that you can reasonably infer from what facts you have, but you aren't told. It's about using your imagination to figure out what could be going on. Why is Claudius trying to kill Hamlet? What is going on with Laertes and Hamlet? Trying to infer, trying to use your imagination, bringing that to the argumentation is going to be one of the things that we do. Quite often we will have this exercise in our heads of what fact could change everything, what extra fact in a case changes everything. Or changes things just enough or shades our understanding. Think about what we learned along the way here from some of you, but also some backstory that I pitched in about. The king being killed, about Polonius being killed. Here's one more About the word brother again, what if I told you that Ophelia, whom. Hamlet was supposed to marry. died By suicide. After seeing Hamlet go through this whole thing, whether it's the madness or just the revenge or whatever it is. Let's say there is a link between Hamlet's behavior and his own fiance's Laertes's sister's death. What more does that add to the context for Laertes? A double reason, as Anna put it, a double tragedy. Double revenge. Knowing just a little bit more. Can change how you think about what words mean, what a case means, how a case should come out, it can affect the arguments that you're able to make. Fourth thing Is that I hope our exercise today just encapsulates this idea of being patient with your own learning. It will become more clear up to a point, and then some things will still be unclear. But you can't piece things together until you have all the pieces. And just like in your other classes, it really takes some time for all the pieces to start to show up in a way where you can put it together. Just like today, we saw a little bit more here, a little bit more here, you can start piecing it together. Some things are still mysterious, but you can still See how over time. Something that's completely gibberish, nonsensical. You may think you know what's happening, but you don't. will become clear over time. And that's a metaphor for how class works or synecdochy or whatever it is for how class works. You can think back to CIVPro. CIPro was like this. I've heard a lot about you from Professor Johnson, by the way. But SIPRs like this, I teach CIPros sometimes. You know what pleadings, standards are about until you get to discovery. You're like, oh, this is why we have, uh, complaints that have to be dismissed. You don't understand discovery until you get to summary judgment. Like, oh yeah, discovery is the pile of stuff that shows them a summary judgment and somebody's got to use it. This is why you don't understand summary judgment until you think about trial. Summary judgments prevent you from getting to trial. So you don't need trial. Well, what do you mean you don't need trial? I don't know. Well, you don't know that until you get to trial. It's a little bit like that. The pieces will come together only as you get other pieces. Some things will always remain mysterious like football, no one understands, but you know, sorry to bring that back. But be patient with your own learning in each class, but also across time. The final thing I Something that You've all been doing right this moment. We've all been doing it together, which is that I hope in every class, for every reading, for everything that you do in torts, you ask. Why are we doing? This Question mark, question mark, question mark, question mark, question mark. Why? Everything has a reason in this class. Every reading that you get, every page of every reading, every minute of class time, there's a plan for it, there's a reason we're doing it just like this, and it is to help someone's learning. And it may not be you, it may not have worked for you. Some of the things we will do in class relating to torts, not this, will also not work for you, but it may be there for somebody else. Just remember that there's a reason for it. Also keep in mind that as you read, I know your classes haven't all been like this, but sometimes you get a law school class where every case is like it stands for something like a proposition of law and if you brief the case and you write down the proposition of law, you're done. That's not how this class is going to work. Most of our readings are not like that. A lot of our readings, including the story of little Leo Adams in the trolley today, we're using purely for the fact pattern. We're not gonna think about Cardozo's legal reasoning whatsoever, 0, thinking about that. Right, so just keep in mind that for each of the things that we do, at least in this class, you do want to ask yourself, wait, why are we reading this? What are we gonna try to get out of it? How are we gonna use this in class? And then it will become clear in class how we're doing it. I will try to give you a little bit of advanced warning, you know, in the reading suggestions, like please read it for the facts, not for the legal analysis, or we're gonna use this to argue against, or we're going to ask these questions about it so that you have a little bit of advance notice. But I hope it'll be just a habit for you to be always asking, wait, why, why are we doing this? Or what's going on in the class exercise today? Ask this in the second half of class also when we get to the trolley case, wait, what are we doing here? What's the point? There is a plan for all of these things. And that's the same for every reading and for everything we do in class. The plan for today Is this? Every day when we walk in you're gonna see this on the board on this side will be the agenda on this side will be the themes. The themes might not make a whole lot of sense until you actually work with them a few times or we do a few things in class over time, the agenda will help you map out what to expect during the day. Theater exercise, we just did that. Introduction to the course that's next. I'm gonna walk through the syllabus and sort of norms, ground rules, how this class works, a little bit more of that. And then we'll turn to our case. We'll talk about. Adams versus Bullock, using it as a fact pattern, we're gonna start making arguments just like I said, we're gonna be playing the role of arguing one side versus arguing the other. We're gonna be using the facts, we're focusing on the facts today, not at the law. And we'll be trying to use your imagination. In applying facts to your arguments, not necessarily legal arguments, but just your arguments about who should have to pay for little Leo's injury. After we do that, then we're going to turn to some of the principles that we think. We don't know, but we think motivates a lot of the structure and doctrines of tort law, which we call the aims of tort law, and that's where the Abraham reading will come in. You know how Abraham walks through these major aims, corrective justice, deterrence, and so on. We will use that and link it up to the argumentation that we will be doing together using the facts of the trolley case. So that's the agenda. OK. And that'll be there on the board every day, so you know what to expect. So the first thing on the agenda we've already done. The next thing is to give you a little survey of the course. Um, I hope you have your syllabus, but if not, I will just walk through um some of the major components. Today is quite unusual in that I'm talking for a long time. It almost never will be like this, but just to get us started, um, let's walk through some of the syllabus, the ground rules, and I will walk through the topics of the course as well so that you get a sense of where we're headed. So you should have uh all your readings available at the bookstore. You have them by now. I see the, the course packets. There's the Abraham book as well. These things are available now. If you have a used copy, it's OK. No taking in the class. Is really up to you. Um, as you already know from our syllabus and the welcome note, the teaching fellows and I will be providing you with a comprehensive set of official notes. Those will be in the form of slides from the review sessions. The review sessions will start in a couple of weeks, and as each review session happens, you'll get a full set of slides that capture all the doctrine, all the things that we are supposed to know for this class. I go through those slides word for word myself before they go out, before the teaching fellows use them in their review sessions, and so you can think of them as authoritative for our purposes. Remember that we're talking about a common law area, um, just like your property class. Just like contracts and so every jurisdiction is a little bit different, but we're going to have a stylized law for this class and that will be what's captured in those slides. So what that means that you don't have to write that stuff down, you're gonna get that. You're welcome to, as we go along. Take notes on whatever you would like. I would probably suggest taking notes in a way that um highlights what special insight just occurred to you. Something you notice about. A form of argument, something that you're noticing from the way the class runs, rather than. Here's this thing about tort law. Feel free to write that down, but you're gonna get that. So your notes you can think of as a supplement to having the basic doctrine on a page in text. These slides will also be posted on courseworks in PDF shortly after class. Every day I'll just upload it. It will be dropped into the courseworks, and so you'll have these as well. You don't have to write this down. Sometimes it's helpful for you if you are trying to keep up with the class or trying to figure out what's going on to maybe jot down some stuff for yourself, but again, don't feel like you need to write down everything on the board. As you know, we're gonna have these interactive discussions. As you also know, um, thanks to the bluebirds for being on the panel today, we're going to alternate between the bluebirds and the goldfinches. It's alphabetical, as you saw in my note, and somewhere along the way, I'll switch the order so that bluebirds aren't always stuck with Wednesdays and goldfinches aren't always Mondays, so I'll switch it up. So just keep an eye out in the weekly email assignment emails that Um, that I send you because I will tell you which panel is on for which day. It may be a little confusing when I switch it up, but it's so that you're not just stuck with always Wednesdays or always Mondays. Absences, email me if you're sick, if you have a religious holiday, and, uh, my faculty coordinator Sydney will be able to get you access to that day's recording if you have to be absent for excused reasons. There will be a practice exam later in the course, um, about halfway through. It is mandatory, um, it is not graded, so it's purely an exercise for you to just get the hang of what an exam looks like in this class, typing it out, trying it out for yourself. You don't, you don't have to time it. We're not gonna sign you proctored or anything. It's just send you home with it, have you actually try it out. And if you return your answers on time by the due date, then the teaching fellows will give each of you individualized feedback about the writing style, about exam writing in this class, about how to deal with the word limits, you know, all the practical tips. Um, that's what you'll get from the teaching fellows. They won't be grading it. It also won't affect your final grade. Office hours. My office hours will be this time on Tuesdays, the day we don't have class, 8:30 to 9:30. Not 10:30, 8:30 to 9:30 on Tuesdays. I'll send you an email about it. Um, right now we have room 908 reserved for it. Office hours is the time to ask me questions about the substance of the course. Feel free to ask me anytime or email me about um procedural stuff or, you know, I didn't get an email from you about next week's assignments. Logistical stuff, always feel free to check in. But for substantive questions, I urge you to bring your questions to office hours. I really won't have um time in class to address it. I'll get thrown off too much if, you know, we take on an interesting question and then I'm just off to, on some tangent. Um, so instead, let's do that in office hours. Bring any questions you have that's torch related or even not torch related to office hours. Office hours are open, meaning that you don't have to sign up, meaning that you can come and go as you wish. Typically there's a handful of people there, 10 people there or so coming and going. There's gonna be snacks. You don't have to have a question. It's just like an extra seminar about Tort stuff with some. Students asking questions. So absolutely feel free to come to that, stop by, come and go as you wish. Um, it's meant to be very, very relaxed, and it's the place where I can really answer your questions. You can also email your questions to me and the teaching fellows, and we'll find some way, if it's something that's important to share with the class, we'll find some way to share it. Certainly, corrections about anything, we will tell you that we said something wrong before. As you know, we have our teaching fellows, you should feel free to email them. We'll try to set up a shared email where if you send it, it'll go to all the teaching fellows. And to me, so stay tuned for that. And one more thing is, of course, again, this is a tough time in one all year, it's a tough time maybe just in the world. If you need any support of any kind that the teaching fellows and I can provide or point you towards, please let us know. We have a great student services team, um, there's a disability services office, there's wellness offerings at the university, um, so please feel free to come to us and we can direct you to those resources. OK Let's do this. Every day we're, we're gonna take a break. Kind of like right now, 9:30, OK, half hour, sorry, not half hour, after about an hour into class, so halfway through the class. Let's go ahead and take a break now and then after the break, I'll walk through the syllabus, I'll walk through the topics, OK? Break is 5 minutes, please be back in 5 minutes. it. OK. I was like. I Oh It's like a. You I know the lady's gonna call you. And After sun is You. Yeah That. Yeah I my heart I I like 6 months. That I. No OK, welcome back. I Any announcements? Fey, go ahead.

SPEAKER 5
OK, um, we're going to be doing TF office hours and we're gonna be alternating TF office hours and review sessions, and they're going to start the first week of February. That's, and they're going to be always Tuesdays during the lunch hour, so February 3rd lunch hour, and it's going to be in room Big Warren, room 310. We're pretty sure there will be lunch, um, we're pretty sure about that. And then I think the first session is going to be a review session, but we'll get back to you on that and all of this will also be in an email. But for now, just note that every Tuesday at lunch hour in Bighorn 310, come see your TAs.

SPEAKER 0
Thank you, thank you for doing that. And you will get all this information in an email, so don't worry about writing it down, but keep in mind Tuesday lunches towards teaching fellows. That's great. Thank you very much. Again, as you know, my office hours are Tuesdays in the morning, 8:30 to 9:30, and I'll email you about that as well. As I said, I'll take just a few minutes to walk us through the syllabus. None of this will have to make any sense to you right now, but it can at least give you a sense of the overall arc of what we will do in this course, and it'll just give you a very, very quick sense of what these topics, um, are about. So really what we're talking about when we talk about torts in this class is we're gonna be talking about accidents, the law of accidents. And the underlying question is, well, what can the law do about it? It can make somebody pay for the costs of the accident, pay for the injury, whatever that means, we'll talk about that as well, but what we're talking about is primarily the law of accidents. And the foundation for the law of accidents and Anglo-American systems and in our course is going to be the idea of negligence, the idea that you might be liable for someone else's injury if you were careless in a way that relates to the injury. And we'll talk about all of what that means. What does it mean to be careless? What does it mean that your behavior had some causal effect on the injury? We'll get through all of that. But we're gonna start off with the idea of negligence, the standard of care. And this is an area of law where we're going to do a lot of what I just sort of suggested we'll be doing today, which is using lots of facts to make arguments. There is almost no law in this section. Negligence is just this idea that you're supposed to act reasonably, carefully. What does that mean? Well, that's up to the jury. That's up to the aunt and uncle in the jury to figure out how careful was somebody supposed to be. We'll see that judges, courts, over time, common law has created a bunch of doctrines here and there to tweak things or to structure things, and we'll get through that. But the foundation of this is going to be just common sense argumentation to your aunt and uncle on the jury or your cousin who didn't go to law school about was this a reasonable thing to have done. Or were they too careless and therefore should be responsible, liable in law. So that's how we're gonna get started. It's just talking about the idea of the reasonable person acting like a reasonable person would. Very quickly we'll start to see that there are questions of legal design that come up and common, this is what I meant by common law tweaking things. Common common law has structured certain things, for example, like a kid. How are you supposed to think about a kid acting reasonably? Can a kid even act reasonably? Can little Leo with his wire, can we judge him in a sense that Relates to this idea of being careful enough, being reasonably careful. Can a 12 year old kid be reasonably careful? What about a 2-year-old kid? Right, so these questions come up and then judges figure out, well, OK, maybe we have to adjust the doctrine somehow. And then we see how they do that, and that changes the nature of argumentation that you can use in front of aunt and uncle because the judge gives the jury the jury instructions, you're pitching the story to them based on those jury instructions, which we call tort law and How judges structure things then structures the way that you tell your story about the kid who was negligent or not. Other aspects of legal design, a lot of our course will be talking about this idea of legal design, how do you put together a doctrinal system. Or even statutory system that can capture all these different kinds of facts. In this class we'll be talking about accidents that range from like a little kid in a trolley to car accidents to massive oil spills to pharmaceuticals that injure millions of people. Get millions of people addicted and then harm them, kill them. Right, the whole range of stuff. How are we going to design one system of law called torts to deal with all these different things. And so a lot of what we'll be talking about in debating class is how to design doctrine and then later how to design a torts system as a whole. So one of the first things of course that we'll be thinking about in legal design is this ancient tension you've seen in your other courses for sure between rules versus standards. A bright-line rule versus a flexible standard that takes all kinds of facts into account. Do you have a rule that's triggered just by one fact, or do you like certain age cutoff, or do you have a standard that takes like totality of circumstances into account? You're familiar with that design choice and we'll be doing it in the context of torts and then we'll see also how that relates. To who actually ends up deciding the case, is it really the jury who decides the case if all the judge has to do is apply a bright line rule like the person's 17 and not 18, so we're done, we treat them like a child, like, is there any role for the jury in that decision or are rule-like structures almost all of taking the decision away from the jury to the judge? Something we'll talk about there. External sources, OK, I've been saying that look, we're just gonna ask aunt and uncle and the jury to come up with a decision of whether this person was careful enough, were they reasonable in what they did? Well, yeah, but you can sometimes in the law bring in outside experts to say that was not a reasonable thing for a surgeon to have done. Aunt and uncle are not gonna know what a reasonable surgeon would have done, but the surgical expert can come in, the doctor can come in, testify, and then what do aunt and uncle do with that? What do we do with that kind of expertise? In a way, this is an extension of the question of who decides. Do we actually have aunt and uncle decide, do we have the judge decide? Or do we have the industry itself decide? Do we have the profession itself decide? If the doctor comes in and says, here's the gold standard for surgical operations in this particular field. That's the profession talking. Do we just defer to them? Do we not? What if it's the tech industry saying here's how AI does stuff and it's safe, it's totally safe, we defer to them? What's the difference between the industry and the profession? So we'll be talking about some of that. One other body that can come in and decide some of these things for us is legislatures. Legislatures can of course pass things like speed limits. And if you're driving over the speed limit, does that mean you're automatically driving unreasonably fast? Should it? So we'll talk about that interplay as well. Final thing about thinking about negligence. I in a way thinking about. The relationship between what tort law is trying to do. In regulating people's behavior in a sense. And what regulation tries to do, and one of the things that regulation tries to do, you may have come across some regulations in your other courses, is that it tries to do things that look rational, things that do a cost-benefit analysis. Can some of that regulatory thinking be brought into tort law in a way, and if so, where? Do we ask aunt and uncle to do cost-benefit analysis? Maybe, maybe not. We're gonna ask judges to do it. And what we'll see is that for a period of time some judges thought that was a good idea, and so we'll talk about this idea of judges coming in and creating in a way a cost benefit analysis way of thinking about what it means to be negligent, to be liable, that looks a little bit more like regulation, and we'll talk about what happened to that. Duty is a section of the course where we are starting to talk about Wait, is it even your problem to begin with? When do you even have the obligation to be careful? Always? Do you always have the obligation to be careful in everything that you do? Or maybe sometimes you don't. And what we'll see in particular is that tort law has evolved to make a distinction between. Being careless in a way that creates risk for people versus being careless in a way where you're failing to help someone. With another risk that's created somewhere else. So the idea of creating a risk, causing the harm because you created that risk versus failing to help. That's gonna become important and just how, it doesn't have to be this way, but this is the way tort law has evolved to draw this distinction of saying like, this is your problem, you created the situation. This is not your problem. You didn't create the situation and you're not obligated to reasonably be reasonably helpful. We'll talk about how our moral intuitions maybe clash with that. There are gonna be some cases that are quite tough where it looks like tort law is just letting somebody completely off the hook for failing to help in a way that they really should have helped. And that'll be useful for us to sort of tease out where does common sense slash our general moral intuitions come into play in tort law and when does the law take it out of the law. So that's gonna be our discussion of duty. The next section will be what's generally called causation. The idea of causation here is that the thing that you did, the behavior, the carelessness, has to be linked up to the actual injury in some way. You could be drunk driving and not hit anybody and then someone else over there has a car crash. Yeah, you were totally careless on the roads, but why should you be liable for that? You're unrelated. Your behavior, as bad as it was, was unrelated to any injury. You got lucky. We'll talk about ideas of moral luck, this idea that you can act badly and yet get away with it because you'd happen not to have harmed someone versus tort law saying that once you have harmed someone, now you're on the hook. Now what does it mean to have causal harm that's going to be a little bit more of an analytical section for us? A lot of the stuff beforehand will sound like mush. It will just be like words, a word salad. You're just making arguments, and causation, for causation in fact, this idea that you factually caused some injury, there will be more of like a logic games kind of aspect to that particular section of torts. There then is another section though, which traditionally has been called proximate cause, but now we're gonna call it scope of liability following the third restatement, we're gonna the modern view of this is that we're gonna call it scope of liability, which says that OK, even if you actually caused the injury in some technical sense, uh, we'll let you off the hook. We just don't think that you should need to be responsible for that. One of the key levers here is gonna be the idea of foreseeability. Yeah, you technically caused this injury, but like it was completely unforeseeable, it's really not your fault. That's gonna affect both the negligence analysis and also this step here called scope of liability, where the jury basically just let's get lets people off the hook, gets to let people off the hook for whatever common sense reason. And at this point we're gonna complete the circle by saying, wait, how is that any different from the very question we began with, which is asking aunt and uncle whether these people should have behaved differently or not? How's letting them off the hook here any different from letting them off the hook here? Is there any actual conceptual difference? Is there anything that's just kind of circular about how tort law is structured? And so that's how we're gonna complete that circle. After that, then we're going to step back and just say, OK, we've been talking this whole time about accidents caused by carelessness. But what about accidents that are caused by someone creating a risky behavior, risky situation, but they weren't really careless. Like you couldn't be any more careful, it's just a risky situation that you created. Well, yes, it turns out tort law does sometimes then step in and say, well, you're liable. If you create this kind of really wildly abnormal risk, like explosives going off. OK, like you could be doing your explosives carefully, but you're still liable because you created this super risky situation, and we're gonna call that strict liability. There's another component of strict liability that has to do with products. Sometimes products liability is described as strict liability, but we're actually going to see how products liability doesn't look so strict. It really looks more like a form of negligence. It looks more like a form of being careless in how you made the product or designed it or failed to warn people about the risks. We're also going to then inch our way towards what we call intentional torts. We're not going to really do intentional torts here. Intentional torts are gonna be things like assault, like fraud, like defamation. These things are also crimes. And so I'm just gonna leave that to Professor Harcourt to work with you through all those components of what it means to have an intent, mens rea, mental states, attempts, conspiracy, all these interesting questions. Which are really better handled within a criminal law class, we're going to leave out of this course. But we will get kind of close by talking about a couple of topics that are intent, kind of intent-ish, right? So this idea that you could be so careless that you're reckless, you're grossly negligent, and then even worse than that, you're reckless. At that point, it's not really you're intending the harm, but man, you're getting close to intending the harm. And what can tort law do about that? And that'll set us up for talking about punitive damages later. The other areas that we're gonna overlap a little bit with property, OK? And here we're gonna talk about trespass and nuisance in a very, very minimal and stylized way. Whatever Professor Lee says goes, OK, but for our class we're gonna do a super baby version of trespass and nuisance just to give you a sense of here's a way you could actually tort someone. In what we call a property tort where again you didn't intend to harm, but you intended to do the thing that's causing the harm like releasing a bunch of smoke into the air and then it affects your neighborhood, OK. That is going to set us up. Not only to think a little bit about intense sort of, but also to think about continuing harms. Up until that point, we'll have these accidents where like someone got injured because they dove into a lake without looking first and then there wasn't any signs saying that it's really shallow and they broke their neck. Like that happened, it's done. What can law do about it? At this point we're gonna start talking about things like nuisance or trespass that can be continuing harms. They can, these things can just keep going. That smoke can keep coming onto your property, affecting your interests. What can the law do about that? Now that opens up the possibility that the law can look forward and say the law can stop it with an injunction. Rather than just have somebody pay damages for whatever happened in the past, and here we'll start talking about forward-looking versus backward-looking approaches to tort law. OK, that's what that will set us up for us. Of course, naturally the next subject will in fact be Torch remedies injunctions versus damages. When is it that a court is going to say You have to stop emitting that smoke, and when is the court going to say, yeah, you have to pay for all the times you emitted smoke in the past and also pay for the times you'll do it in the future. And as long as you pay your way, it's fine, you can keep doing it. That choice we'll talk about through a conversation about injunctions and damages. And with damages we're gonna primarily focus on compensatory damages almost all the time in torts that we're gonna be talking about making someone pay for the injury. That's what we're talking about. The idea is to make them whole. Of course you truly cannot make someone whole after they lose an arm or break their neck, but the jury is supposed to come up with some amount of money that's kind of equivalent to making them whole. And that's what we'll be talking about is compensatory damages. It's gonna involve things like you lost earnings because you can't work anymore, but also you broke your neck and that hurt a lot, so some pain and suffering damages. Also you broke your neck and like have hospital bills, and also you broke your neck and that's just worth something on its own. All of that added up together will be the idea of compensatory damages. A jury is going to come up with that number and say, here's what it takes to put you more or less back in the same, whatever that means, situation that you were before the accident. So keep that in mind, that's mostly what we'll be talking about. Later in the course though, we will get to Punitive damages which look beyond, look beyond just compensating somebody for the harm. We're now not just interested in what this injured party needs to be made whole in some metaphysical sense. We're now thinking about what would it take to punish and deter the defendant, the oil company in our particular case, or the pharmaceutical company or whoever it is. It could be just somebody acting badly. What does it take, not just to like have them pay for the injuries, but actually have them feel it. In the sense that they're feeling punished by the law or that they feel it in the sense that they're being fully deterred from ever doing that again. What does it mean to do that? How much is enough? How much is too much? For both punitive damages and for compensatory damages, we'll talk about all kinds of interesting limits that the law has placed on liability, on how much someone has to pay. We'll see some of the artificial limits created by common law. We'll talk about a supplemental topic. Really we're getting into our advanced topics here. We're talking about supplemental advanced topic called federal preemption. There's a case of the Supreme Court right now involving Bayer and Monsanto about Roundup, which is a weed killer. It's a, it's a herbicide, and people say that it's caused them all kinds of illnesses over time. The company says no, and they're fighting it out, and the question is, wait a second, there's some federal regulations about this stuff. Doesn't that take care of it? Why should there still be tort law regulating it when there's also federal Congress has already decided to regulate it. Federal law, supreme law of the land, isn't that beat out state law? Why is there still state law getting involved? Should there be still some state law? Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The Supreme Court will tell us this term in this case, so we'll talk about that. That'll be a supplemental topic. It's a bit too advanced for us to make it truly a part of the course, but it'll be useful for you to have heard of. Qualified immunity is the same way, again, a little bit too advanced for our class. It's a lot of criminal procedure that I don't know honestly. And it's not really torts, but it is important limitation that I want you to have heard of on the potential tort liability, in particular of state actors, governmental actors. You may have heard of it already, we'll talk a little bit about its evolution and where it's headed. Why is there such a thing as protection from liability from people acting on behalf of the states, like police officers. Our final section will be Our next advanced topic, which is mass torts, and what we're gonna be talking about is this big question of like can the law that we've designed, we've talked about For like one little kid getting electrocuted, getting electric shock, or a car accident or a swimmer diving into a lake, can that law thing, those tools, those legal designs, can that actually be used to handle the kinds of injuries that affect thousands of people, hundreds of thousands, millions of people at a time, oil spills, pharmaceutical products. Can we, like, why? Why are we taking this area of law and saying that it actually works for this? Can it work for this? And more importantly, how can the tort system handle it? How can the court system handle it? Are you're gonna have truly 5 million people with individual lawsuits? Having to do with some pharmaceutical products, really? That's how you're gonna do it. You're gonna treat them like 5000, 5 million individual little cases, or is there another way to try to do this? And here we'll talk about all forms, all these forms of aggregation that you talked about in SIFR already, class actions, of course, multi-district litigation, even things beyond that. And this will lead us to our capstone case, which is where everything comes together, all the stuff, basically all the stuff in the course comes together in this moment when we talk about the BP oil spill. The BP oil spill disaffected a huge variety of interests, landowners, fishermen, oystering communities, um. Businesses, restaurants, homeowners, people's health. All through the Gulf. And can the torch system handle it? It's one thing that happened. We're gonna go in excruciating detail to figure out exactly what went wrong on that BP oil rig to cause this like massive blowout and oil spill, biggest worst environmental disaster on US property, US territory. Right? What, what happened there? And we'll see it was just a few bad calls by a handful of people that caused this accident and yet then it affects all these people. What can the tort system do about that? Can a class action handle it? Do we, can an MDL handle it? How are we gonna do with all of this together? Can we deal with it all at once? Can we deal with a lot of it all at once? Or is it just gonna be a bunch of individual lawsuits? So that will be our capstone case and we'll see all kinds of things coming into play from prior parts of the course. OK. Alright, that was a whirlwind tour. If none of that sank in, don't worry. I hope you didn't write any of that down. I hope you didn't write anything down from the first part of the class either. You don't have to take notes on everything if you remember, you just don't have to take notes unless it really strikes you as like, oh this is important for me to try to think about on my own a little bit later. OK. So back to here We have now done our introduction to the course. You'll have this in your notes. This is in a way a very schematic map of some of the stuff we were just talking about. With torts we're gonna be focusing on unintentional torts, law of accidents, talking about negligence and strict liability as the foundations. We'll touch on intentional torts only in the slightest way. And then another way to think about the structuring of torts is like what are the components that you have to show in the case. You have to show, of course that there is the careless behavior which we call the breach. Right, of the duty, the duty is to be careful. And then that it causes harm. And all these words will be fully fleshed out as we go along. So we'll return to this schematic, um, at various points in the course just to reorient ourselves, but we're gonna start off with unintentional torts, negligence, and the idea of breach. What does it mean to have been too careless? What could you have done more to be careful? That's where we're starting. And for that, we'll go to the little Leo Adams case. Carl Hirsch. Will you just remind us about the facts? Remember we're talking about the facts here every case we're asking why are we doing this case? What are we reading it for? This one I told you we're reading it just for the facts. So what do we know? We don't know much, but what do we know? Uh, the plaintiff is playing on the defendant's railroad tracks or trolley tracks with, uh, a long. Not a wire, like a metal, metal wire, I think, um, he hits the trail, uh, the trolley wire, uh, causing him shock, and he sues for a negligent tort. All right, let's try to draw this. All right, so. Here's some kind of tracks or something. Whoops. This little Leo Adams, you don't know his name, but his name is Leo Cardozo doesn't tell you his name is Leo. He's a grown up. He's a kid. What do we know? Uh, he's a child. He's a child. He's 12 years old. What year are we in roughly? Uh, era 1919, 1919 is the case. The events are happening a few years ahead of that, OK. And something about some wire. What is this? What's the deal with the wire? What's he doing? Why does this kid have a wire? Can you describe a wire? What's this? I'm already confused. Uh, he's just playing with it, whipping it around on the whipping it around. How long is this wire? Uh, it's, was it 9 ft 9 ft, is it? 8, let's say it's 8 ft 88 9 ft. OK, how long is that? Longer, longer, longer, I think it's past your wingspan, past my wingspan. All right, All this. 6 ft 7 ft, let's say it's 8 ft 8 ft. Yeah, that's definitely not my, yeah, that's beyond my wingspan. All right, you can let go now. This is the wire that little Leo's got in his hand. He's a 12 year old with his wire like this. It's like taller than him. And what's he doing? He's just whipping it around, whipping it around. Um, I think of a tort happening right here too. He's just whipping it around. Why is he just ripping it around? Uh, cause he's just a 12 year old, 12 year old boy. That's the right answer. Of course he is. How many of you have ever been a 12 year old? Yeah, right, you are naturally you're like, woo. Let's do it. OK, and then something happens to him as he's whipping this. Newfound toy around, so the trolley is connected to an electrified wire, uh, up top and the metal wire he's swinging around hits the trolley wire and shocks him. He hits the trolley wire and it shocks him. OK, the way trolleys work. Even today, some of them. I think in Boston they still have these maybe other places you have kind of like a bus and it's powered by electricity. Electricity comes in through a wire. I don't know how electricity works, but there's a wire involved and there's a thing that hooks up from the trolley to the wire. And it, because it's in constant contact, it's like a wire from the trolley to the big wire, not this wire, but like the electrical wire, and because it has that contact, current flows through and it powers the car, OK? And sometimes the hook comes off. I've seen this in Boston actually, hook comes off and then like you have to wait 45 minutes for somebody to come and like, uh, put it back on. OK, it's a really silly way to run a thing, but it was very, very, very common in lots of places to have electrified trains basically or buses run in this way. So that means that you have an exposed wire, right? The wire has to be exposed in some sense, we'll talk more about this. It has to be exposed in some sense with electrical stuff going through it, like, electricity going through it, in order for that hook to be able to hold onto it so that the car can run, the bus can run. So it's an exposed electrical wire, as far as we know here. And what happens is literally you'll somehow like you're flinging the wire around. And comes in contact with this trolley, OK. What you don't know And here it'll be helpful for me to just draw some stuff out for you. You said he's standing on some kind of railroad tracks, OK. The railroad tracks are on a bridge, right? I mentioned something about a bridge, right? And the bridge runs like this. The bridge runs across. It's kind of valley. Where there's kind of two hills on each side. OK. And so the bridge is running across this valley. It's a pretty sturdy bridge, OK. So these are little bricks, so you can see it's kind of made of bricks. OK. So it's a solid bridge that is solid enough to carry train tracks across the top. I fix the train tracks. And is it just train tracks up there or are there people walking around or? Um, it is that people like to use it as like a shortcut in the community. People are using this whole bridge apparatus as a shortcut to walk from one side to the other. All kinds of people are on here, including little kids like. little Leo This is 8 ft long wires just swinging it around. So he's standing on top of this bridge. Basically where everybody's walking. To get from one side to the other. So you imagine this is a pretty serious bridge. It's got a train running on it, but it's also got kind of a sidewalk, basically. OK, can you hear me? So this is the setup. And Little Leo is swinging this wire around. And where's the trolley in relation to him? Charlie's not above him. Where is it? It's on the it goes through the tracks. It goes through the tracks, but it's not on the train tracks. It's on a separate run of tracks that goes this way. Underneath the bridge. So you're wondering how is this kid able to get the wire to get in contact with the thing, it's not because he's swinging it up, it's because he's swinging it down. OK. He's dangling that wire over the, he's on the bridge dangling it down, the trolley is running through the bottom. I don't know how to draw a trolley, but we'll make it a box, OK? The trolley. And remember there's an electrical wire that the trolley needs. And the electrical wires running along the trolley tracks, of course. There's the wire. There's the electricity on it. OK. And little Leo dangles his wire, right, this thing over the edge of the bridge. You think he's just accidentally like, oh, there's an electrical wire, whoops. What do you think he's doing? Uh, trying to hit the wire. You're trying to hit the wire, right? It's like electricity, awesome. Right? Because he's 12 years old. And sure enough, he makes contact with the wire. He achieves his objective. And then he gets this terrible, terrible shock. Cardoso doesn't tell you what happened to little Leo. He lives, he's badly burnt. This is a serious shock. He's badly burnt. He has some potentially neurological damage that affects him a little bit later in life, unclear. The science is not great on this. Evidence is not great on this. It takes about 6 months to heal from his burns, so it's pretty serious, but he lives. But that's what that's what's happening to little Leo. Strange situation, he's standing up there dangling his wire and then happens to be able to hit it because he found a long enough wire. OK. All the kids are doing this. Cardoso doesn't tell you, but there's a junkyard nearby. This is 1916. There's not a lot of money in this place. Kids don't have tons of toys. They go to this junkyard. They find whatever they want, play with it. He finds the wire. He's like, Electricity, let's do it. Other kids are swinging other stuff around, probably. That's what's actually happening here. Again, Cardozo is not telling you much. Cardozo has this habit of not telling you much in order for things to seem mysterious when he wants the things to seem mysterious. Right, kind of like that. It's like, I'll just give you a few words, you won't have any idea what's happening, and then it'll be so weird looking to you that you'll think that this was a complete unforeseeable situation. That's his trick. We'll see it again later. You want something to look unforeseeable, give people a pile of gibberish and they're like, I can't even imagine. I don't even know where the trolley is, it's just, uh, if you can't imagine it, it's can't imagine that it's foreseeable, right? So that's Cardozo's trick here. But I can fill in some backstory based on research that other people have done about the actual story here. That's where I'm getting my facts from for the. Extra details. OK, so that's the basic story. Little Leo is now injured, and of course the question that we want to be dealing with is, Who should pay for that? Who should pay for that injury? Should little Leo and his family bear the cost of the injury? Should he bear the pain and suffering of it and the burn of it himself? Or is there something that someone else should be doing to pay him? Or his family to help make up in whatever sense, make up for. What happened to him. Ben Kaiser. Let's start making arguments. If you were arguing to aunt uncle, you're not in a legal setting, you're not in law school, you're just a dinner table, you're with your aunt and uncle, they're not lawyers, and you read the story in a newspaper. It's 1916 and you're like, Oh, that's a terrible story. I think he should have to pay for it. This is, you know, it's his own darn fault. He, or like, no, somebody else needs to be responsible for this and pay. He shouldn't have to cover if you just had to make arguments based on just common sense, based on what little facts we have here. Try making arguments. Pick one side and then we'll do the other side.

SPEAKER 6
Well, so, I think, um, I mean, it's definitely not on the kid himself, as we sort of said, you know, the, you know, he's 12 years old, this is sort of a behavior that other kids were sort of doing. Um, so there's an influenced by his peers, so the kid himself shouldn't be liable. I, I think there's potentially, if his parents had were sort of knowing about that he was engaging in this behavior, the parents should know better and should encouraged him against this kind of behavior. So there's an argument that the parents themselves should be liable for the injury to their child, but there's also. Uh, you know, the facts.

SPEAKER 0
Alright, let's work with that for a second, OK, so the idea is that somehow he and his family may be as a unit, or are you saying his parents should be separate from him? As like they should really should be the responsible ones.

SPEAKER 6
I'm saying the parents should be separate. OK, parents should be R's.

SPEAKER 0
OK, you're saying parent argument is for parents should be responsible, right?

SPEAKER 6
And also, I mean, I, I don't know from the facts if he was with his parents. I don't remember.

SPEAKER 0
We don't know if he was with his parents, right, what kind of facts would you wanna know? This is a question we will always be asking besides what more facts is what more facts would you wanna know?

SPEAKER 6
Yeah, if he was with his parents at the time with his parents or who was he with?

SPEAKER 0
Were they supervising him? Yeah, Next week we'll see a little kid riding a bike, runs into somebody on the Manhattan sidewalk. Parents are there. What do we do about that situation? Here, OK, let me tell you that the parents were not there, but they live pretty close by. They're at the first house overlooking this bridge and probably from the window you can watch the kids play. That seems to be where the house was, his family was. Does that affect your argument in some way? Can you use that in some way? Is it not that helpful, given that his parents weren't there? On the argument that aunt and uncle, I think the parents should pay, they're the responsible ones.

SPEAKER 6
I think it's, it's difficult. I mean, it comes down to a question of knowledge. Um, should the parents be expected to sort of know that behavior of their child? Are they watching their child from the window? Are they communicating with their child when he comes home? Hey, what have you been up to? So it's a question really sort of, you know, what is going on in the household.

SPEAKER 0
Again, what more facts we wanna know? We wanna know, do the parents know that he has a habit of like doing stuff like this? Do his parents know how reckless he is? Do they know that he he's, you know, he's just a boy and he's gonna hang out with his friends and they're gonna do something. You know, really unreasonable stuff, um, or is this the first time he's ever done something like this? Is this the first time that he ever went to the junkyard and found a wire? Is this right, these kinds of facts maybe if you can get them, could be useful, sure, OK. You're about to make an argument for somebody else paying. Who, who else could it be? Little Leo himself, Somebody else?

SPEAKER 6
Yeah, I wouldn't say, um, little Leo himself, I would say. I mean, you could say potentially I, I went to the bridge manufacturer, um, mainly because they said, I mean, you can make an argument, they said that they had sort of, I mean, that was Cardoso's reasoning that they had taken some sort of reasonable care because they installed these parapets in the side of the bridge. Again, it's kind of questionable like if that's sufficient.

SPEAKER 0
Um, all right, so you're picking up on one tiny thing we know, one of the few things we know about this bridge is that besides that, it's big enough to carry a train. That it actually has a parapet. We don't know the dimensions or anything. Cardozo says something about 18 inches wide. I'm not sure why that's helpful to know. Like, we need to know how high it is, right? If it's up here and little Leo climbs on top and like, like, 0 8 ft wire, that's very different than if it's down here. And he's just like, OK Right? So there's some precaution, we don't know if there's enough precaution. This is the question we'll always be asking is, was there enough precaution? Was someone careful enough? What more could they have done? What precautions were not taken? We'll be talking about untaking precautions all the time because it helps you make arguments, right? If you're trying to say, look, they didn't do enough, what would you try to suggest?

SPEAKER 6
They should have, um, you know, maybe put more guard rails on the side or had built a bridge higher above, um, this, this wire, um.

SPEAKER 0
Here are all the things they could have done. They could have been more careful in this way. They could have had a higher fence. They could have had let's draw a fence. It's not that hard. How much does it take to put up a fence? We see fences all the time. On highway overpasses where people walk, of course we have them, this is a ludicrous situation to have left a bridge like that. They could have had the bridge also just not be so close to the wire, right? Now we do happen to know that it was far enough where probably somebody couldn't like just reach down and touch it, you know, someone was like reaching down this way, they probably couldn't get to the wire. The electrical wire, but hey, look, Leo found a way. It wasn't that hard, OK? So you're looking for these untaken precautions. How would you argue against these unaken precautions as like we didn't have to do that. Why would you ask us to do that?

SPEAKER 6
I mean, I guess there's potentially a policy argument you can make here, um, in the sense that I mean this was occurring in sort of the 1910s, it's kind of like uh an industrializing time within America and so you want to kind of incentivize people to build things, um, and so for them to take all these like additional safety precautions might, um. You know, de-incentivize that kind of development of society, um,

SPEAKER 0
it costs stuff to build these things. You needed to make that bridge like another 5 ft taller so that the trolley can run underneath. You know what it costs to build like extra 5 ft of big concrete brick, whatever wooden bridge that carries a train? Really? You want us to do that? Even a fence, fencing cost stuff. Oh, guess what? Who's gonna end up paying for that? Aunt and uncle, oh, the, the builder, the, uh, company's

SPEAKER 6
building it.

SPEAKER 0
The builder, OK, yeah, but the, the society itself, so somebody's gonna pay for it. Like their customers are gonna pay for it, right? If it's a train company, aunt and uncle, you ride that train, you're gonna pay a little bit more. For your train ride to have that fence, to have the extra 5 ft of whatever, OK, so you can make those arguments, right? You can always argue about the costs. How can you expect us to take on all these costs? We don't even know if this is gonna happen. Like that's Cardozo's moves, the unforeseeability. It's so freakish. Like we don't know where it's gonna happen. Like, you don't build this everywhere. You, you're saying we should build fences on all our bridges, and you know you can make it sound worse. Cardozo's common sense slash rhetorical argument, of course, is like, oh, the only way to protect kids for sure is to bury the wire underground. Ha ha ha. I can't do that because electricity doesn't work that way, ha ha ha. That's his move, right? The move is to say. You're asking the impossible. It's so unreasonable to think that that's a precaution that someone has to take. That's not a reasonable precaution. That's the game we're always playing, is taking the facts and saying this is a totally reasonable precaution, you should have taken it, versus no, there's no reason to really expect you to have done that. OK. Now let's start taking these arguments and translating them into. The language of the motivations we think of as being. Underlying tort law. And here we're gonna talk about the aims of tort law, as Abraham calls them. We're gonna talk about corrective justice, we're gonna talk about deterrence primarily. It'll be really those two things. There's a few more other aims that you saw in Abraham, things like civil recourse, things like lost distribution, things like social grievance expression. But most of the time when we talk about the aims of tort law, competing aims of tort law, because they don't always come up with the same answer, we'll talk about these two corrective justice, the idea that someone was wronged. Right? Hamlet says I wronged you. I owe you something now. That idea of setting that moral balance of right, that's the idea underlying corrective justice in some of its formulations, the idea there was a wrong, it needs to be righted. What does it mean to right the wrong in the law that could be one way to explain why we make somebody pay for somebody else's injury. The other idea is going to be this idea of deterrence, which you can also think of it as incentives. OK, you make the rich company pay a whole lot in the future they're gonna put up fences because they realize that, oh man, it costs a lot to pay for every kid who gets electrocuted in this way. Maybe fences is a better idea. If we did defenses, we wouldn't have to pay also. Isn't that nice? There wouldn't be accidents and also the law wouldn't hold us liable because we put up fences. Let's just do fences. That's what we mean by deterrence or incentives, the idea that making someone pay for an injury changes their behavior, changes other parties' behaviors in useful ways. And that could apply to the bridge company, it could apply to the trolley company who's actually being sued here. It could apply to little Leo himself, right? If he doesn't get paid, if nobody covers his losses, he has to bear it all. He's gonna be more careful next time. Other kids will be more careful next time, knowing that no one's ever gonna pay them for their injuries because they're the careless one. And we're gonna always turn it back on the injured party themselves. The injured parties also have a liability potential. They also have a responsibility to be careful with respect to themselves and to others, but since they're the injured one, they may be responsible for their own injury. And that's certainly very intuitive here with little Leo. He's kind of the one who did it, right? But what does that mean for whether he should bear the cost or not? Whether or not his being 12 years old matters for that sense of responsibility or not. So let's play with this a little bit. Noella Chai. Let's think about the kinds of arguments you might make about so and so should pay based on the idea of corrective justice or based on the idea of deterrence or incentives. Pick any of them, pick anybody you think should pay and just make the argument, and then we'll argue against that.

SPEAKER 7
Yeah, I mean, so one argument for making um Leo Adams or his family pay is that um You know, it would to some extent help to deter kids from this kind of carelessness or it would encourage parents to supervise their children more closely.

SPEAKER 0
OK, so either little Leo pays or his parents pay equivalent kind of because it's always really the parents paying, right? Either way. Well, guess what that does? That gives those parents, other parents, a lot of insight. They read about it in the news, they're like, oh man, he didn't get a dime out of the trolley company. We really should be more careful, right? That's the, that's the logic. The logic is something like that, that if we ourselves have to bear the costs and our kid has to bear the injury without any recompense, then we just have to be more careful in the future in supervising the kid, something like that, OK. That's pretty straightforward incentives deterrence argument. How would you argue against?

SPEAKER 7
Um I mean, I don't know if this is a counter argument, but similarly, one argument for making like the bridge manufacturer pay or um I guess the, I don't know, the whoever does the wiring is that Yeah, um, you know, it would encourage them to not have systems that create these kinds of risks.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah And what might they do, right? The idea is that it will do some good. What might they do if you tell the trolley companies now you're responsible for any injury that looks like this.

SPEAKER 7
I mean it would push them to maybe move the electricity underground, move the electricity underground, find some other way

to like shield the wire, right? Maybe you can't move it underground. That's Cardozo's rhetorical thing. They can't move it underground, so too bad. But what if I told you, right? What more facts? What if I told you that you can actually shield this thing and in fact there was a board covering this wire right under the bridge that shielded it. It just didn't extend far enough. What if I told you it was actually possible, despite Cardozo's rhetoric, to build a shield so that the wire can be semi-housed where it's going under the bridge, right? That's something they could have done. If you have that fact, you know that that's possible. It's like just extend it like another foot. That would have saved him. You wouldn't have even tried if you saw that. And so cheap, so cheap just to put another little bit of aluminum for whatever wood or something over there, right? OK, that's the kind of thing you might expect them to do. What else might they do? What other precautions might they do? Both as an argument about it's useful to deter them but also as an argument for saying that they're responsible because they didn't take the most basic precaution. Um, What about something like this? Put up a sign. Put a warning sign, warn someone. Now, again, how many of you have been 12 year old kids? And if you were a 12 year old coyote and you saw that warning sign, you're like, give me another wire. There's electricity here. Let's do it. All right. So again, using your imagination to think about what, what really is that precaution worth it because it might actually attract more danger. You can play with those facts in that way if you had them. All right, so you see what we've been trying to do here. Here's what we've done today. I'll try to recap every day if I can. We had a little exercise that set the stage, so to speak, for this class in this classroom, seeing as collaborative theater. We had an introduction to the course, some of the ground rules, walking through the syllabus, and then we started playing with. The very foundational types of arguments that you might make in a negligence case, we've gotten started on unintentional torts, law of accidents, the area called negligence liability, and we see that it's all about arguing about how someone should have been more careful, could have been more careful, it would have done some good, it wouldn't have done some good, and the idea that you can try to give people incentives to do it by making them pay for injuries, someone else's or their own. This is what we'll pick up on Monday. See you Monday. out. Yeah, I really like I, I was like shocked. I They I So. One where it's like realistic. You kind of gotta have like some.
