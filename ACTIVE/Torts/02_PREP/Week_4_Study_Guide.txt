====================
KEY CONCEPTS
====================

I. CAUSATION-IN-FACT (FACTUAL CAUSATION)

Definition: Set of analytical tools for determining which parties can be said to have CAUSED harm

Distinguished from:
- Proximate cause (legal cause/scope of liability)
- Breach of duty (what defendant did wrong)
- Damages (harm suffered)

Purpose:
- Links defendant's conduct to plaintiff's injury
- Required element for tort liability
- Must be proven by preponderance of evidence

====================
II. "BUT-FOR" CAUSATION
====================

The Standard Test:
"But for defendant's negligence, would plaintiff's harm have occurred?"
- If answer is NO → causation established
- If answer is YES (would have happened anyway) → no causation

Formula:
Plaintiff must prove: More likely than not (>50%) that defendant's conduct caused the harm

Example:
- Doctor fails to diagnose cancer in timely manner
- Patient had 51% chance of survival with timely diagnosis
- Patient dies
- Analysis: But for doctor's failure, would patient have lived?
- If evidence shows YES (>50% chance) → causation proven
- If evidence shows NO (<50% chance) → no causation

====================
III. THE "ALL OR NOTHING" PROBLEM
====================

Traditional Rule:
- Patient with >50% chance of survival → full recovery if negligence caused death
- Patient with <50% chance of survival → NO recovery even if negligence reduced chance to 0%

Problems:
1. Arbitrary 50% threshold
2. Immunizes whole areas of medical practice
3. Fails to deter negligence when patient already seriously ill
4. Denies compensation for real loss (the chance itself)
5. Unjust when defendant's negligence makes outcome unknowable

====================
IV. LOSS OF CHANCE DOCTRINE
(Matsuyama v. Birnbaum)
====================

Revolutionary Concept:
- Loss of chance is an INJURY, not a causation theory
- The injury = diminished likelihood of favorable outcome
- Chance of survival has VALUE even if <50%

Requirements:
1. Medical malpractice context (limited to this area)
2. Physician's negligence reduced patient's prospects
3. Plaintiff must prove by preponderance that negligence CAUSED the diminished likelihood
4. Expert testimony required (survival statistics, staging, etc.)

Damages Calculation - Proportional Damages Approach:

Step 1: Calculate full wrongful death damages (as if not loss of chance)
Step 2: Determine chance of survival BEFORE malpractice
Step 3: Determine chance of survival AFTER/result of malpractice  
Step 4: Subtract Step 3 from Step 2 = % loss
Step 5: Multiply Step 1 × Step 4 = Award

Example from Matsuyama:
- Full wrongful death damages: $875,000
- Chance before negligence: 37.5% (Stage 2 cancer)
- Chance after negligence: 0% (Stage 4, terminal)
- Loss: 37.5%
- Award: $875,000 × 0.375 = $328,125

Why This Makes Sense:
- Defendant only liable for harm actually caused
- Fair apportionment based on degree of fault
- Recognizes value of medical chance/opportunity
- Doesn't overcompensate plaintiff
- Maintains preponderance of evidence standard

Policy Justifications:
1. Deterrence: Incentivizes proper medical care even for seriously ill
2. Fairness: Compensates for real loss (the chance)
3. Justice: Doesn't give "free pass" when patient <50%
4. Practical: Medical science can now quantify chances reliably

Limited Application:
- Currently limited to medical malpractice
- Requires reliable statistical evidence
- May expand to other areas in future

====================
V. MULTIPLE SUFFICIENT CAUSES
====================

The Problem:
What if TWO independent causes, each alone sufficient to cause the entire harm?

Example:
- Two fires, each large enough to burn down house
- Both reach house simultaneously
- House burns down
- But for Fire A, would house have burned? YES (Fire B would have done it)
- But for Fire B, would house have burned? YES (Fire A would have done it)
- Traditional but-for test FAILS

Solution - Substantial Factor Test:
- Each cause is a "substantial factor" in bringing about harm
- Both defendants liable
- Not limited to but-for causation
- Recognizes overdetermined causation

Restatement Approach:
• Restatement Third § 27: Multiple sufficient causes
• Restatement Second: Different approach (older)
• Compare comment d to § 27

Question to Consider:
What if ONE of the multiple sufficient causes is NON-TORTIOUS (e.g., natural event)?
- Should defendant still be liable?
- Defendant's fire + lightning strike both sufficient
- Is defendant off the hook?

====================
VI. ALTERNATIVE LIABILITY
(Summers v. Tice)
====================

The Scenario:
- Two hunters shoot negligently
- One bullet hits plaintiff
- Impossible to tell which hunter's bullet
- Both hunters equally at fault
- Small, identifiable group

Traditional Problem:
- Plaintiff can't prove which defendant caused injury
- Neither defendant can be held liable under but-for test
- Plaintiff goes uncompensated despite clear negligence

Solution - Burden Shifting:
When:
1. Small group of defendants (typically 2-3)
2. All acted negligently toward plaintiff
3. One of them caused the harm
4. Plaintiff cannot determine which one
5. Defendants in better position to know

Then:
- Burden shifts to EACH defendant
- Each must prove he DIDN'T cause injury
- If neither can prove it → BOTH liable
- Joint and several liability

Rationale:
- Both wrongdoers
- Created the dangerous situation
- Unfair to let both escape when one clearly caused harm
- Defendants know whether they caused it
- "Let them be the ones to apportion it among themselves"

Requirements for Application:
✓ Small group (not 300 companies)
✓ Single incident (not 24-year period)
✓ All defendants negligent
✓ All before court (or realistic possibility)
✓ Plaintiff genuinely can't identify tortfeasor

Distinguished From:
- Market share liability (too many defendants, long period)
- Concert of action (no agreement/common plan required)
- Res ipsa loquitur (burden shifts on negligence, not causation)

====================
VII. MARKET SHARE LIABILITY
(Hymowitz v. Eli Lilly)
====================

The DES Problem:
- 300 manufacturers over 24 years
- Chemically identical drug
- Long latency (15-30 years)
- Impossible to identify manufacturer
- Mothers never knew/recorded which brand

Why Traditional Doctrines Fail:
✗ Alternative Liability: Too many defendants, can't join all
✗ Concert of Action: No agreement/common plan
✗ But-for Causation: Genuinely unknowable who caused harm

Revolutionary Solution:
Each manufacturer liable for its proportion of national DES market for pregnancy use

Formula:
Plaintiff's Damages × Defendant's Market Share = Defendant's Liability

Key Features:
1. NATIONAL MARKET (not local/regional)
   - Fair reflection of overall culpability
   - Administrable across all cases
   - Avoids case-by-case market fights

2. SEVERAL LIABILITY (not joint)
   - Each pays only its percentage
   - Plaintiff may not recover 100%
   - Bears risk of not suing all manufacturers

3. NO EXCULPATION
   - Can't escape by proving "not me"
   - Based on risk created to public
   - Overall culpability, not individual causation

4. WHO'S LIABLE
   - Only those who marketed for pregnancy use
   - During relevant time period
   - If never in pregnancy market → not liable

Rationale:
- Based on RISK CONTRIBUTION, not causation
- Manufacturers created the risk
- Should bear cost of uncertainty they created
- More fair than leaving victims without remedy
- Spreads loss through enterprise

Limited Application:
- Unique circumstances of DES
- Requires:
  * Fungible product (identical)
  * Many manufacturers
  * Long time period
  * Genuine impossibility of identification
  * Mass tort context
- Not extended to most other products

====================
VIII. FAILURE TO WARN CASES
====================

But-For Analysis in Warning Cases:
Question: Would adequate warning have prevented the harm?

Factors to Consider:
1. Would warning have reached the person at risk?
2. Would person have read/understood warning?
3. Would person have heeded warning?
4. Would heeding warning have prevented harm?

Examples from Readings:
- Leo with wire (Adams): Would warning on wire have mattered?
- Swimmer (Parks & Rec): Would "No Swimming" sign have prevented?
- Hospital (Cuyler): Would warning to patient have changed outcome?
- Flying saw blade (Ryobi): Would warning on saw have prevented injury?

Burden:
- Plaintiff must show warning would have made a difference
- More likely than not that warning would have been heeded
- Causation still required

====================
IX. COMPARING THE DOCTRINES
====================

When to Use Which:

BUT-FOR CAUSATION:
→ Standard case
→ Can identify defendant
→ Normal causal chain
→ >50% probability standard

LOSS OF CHANCE:
→ Medical malpractice
→ Patient had <50% chance
→ Negligence reduced that chance
→ Statistical evidence available

ALTERNATIVE LIABILITY (Summers):
→ 2-3 defendants
→ Single incident
→ All negligent
→ Can't tell which caused harm
→ All before court

MARKET SHARE LIABILITY (Hymowitz):
→ Many defendants (100s)
→ Extended time period
→ Impossible to identify
→ Fungible product
→ Mass tort

MULTIPLE SUFFICIENT CAUSES:
→ Two independent causes
→ Each alone sufficient
→ Both actually contributed
→ Overdetermined causation

====================
X. COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE VS. COMPARATIVE CAUSATION
====================

Traditional: Comparative Negligence
- Reduce plaintiff's recovery based on plaintiff's fault
- Example: Plaintiff 30% at fault → recovery reduced 30%

Alternative: Comparative Causation
- Reduce recovery based on relative causation
- Example: Defendant's conduct 40% of causal factors → liable for 40%

Question for Discussion:
Which better serves tort law goals?
- Compensation
- Deterrence
- Corrective justice
- Fairness

====================
XI. RESTATEMENT PROVISIONS
====================

Key Sections to Know:

Restatement Third § 26:
- General rule on factual cause
- But-for causation
- Comment n: Loss of chance (takes no position)

Restatement Third § 27:
- Multiple sufficient causes
- Compare to Restatement Second approach

Restatement Third § 36:
- [Check specific provision]

Compare:
- Restatement Second vs. Restatement Third
- Different approaches to causation issues
- Evolution of tort doctrine

====================
XII. PRACTICAL EXAM TIPS
====================

Analyzing Causation Issues:

Step 1: Identify the Type of Causation Problem
- Standard but-for?
- Multiple sufficient causes?
- Indeterminate defendant?
- Loss of chance?

Step 2: Apply Appropriate Test
- But-for: Would harm have occurred anyway?
- Loss of chance: Was there diminished likelihood?
- Alternative liability: Small group, all negligent?
- Market share: Many defendants, impossible to identify?

Step 3: Consider Policy Arguments
- Which rule achieves fairness?
- Deterrence implications?
- Administrative feasibility?
- Compensating victims vs. protecting defendants

Step 4: Don't Forget Limitations
- Loss of chance: Limited to medical malpractice
- Alternative liability: Small group only
- Market share: Rarely applied outside DES
- But-for: Requires >50% probability

Common Mistakes to Avoid:
✗ Confusing causation-in-fact with proximate cause
✗ Applying market share to small group (use alternative liability)
✗ Applying alternative liability when many possible defendants
✗ Forgetting proportional damages in loss of chance
✗ Assuming joint liability in market share (it's several)
✗ Missing that loss of chance is injury, not causation theory

====================
XIII. HYPOTHETICALS TO PRACTICE
====================

Hypo 1: Multiple Sufficient Causes
Factory A and Factory B both discharge toxins into river. Either discharge alone sufficient to kill plaintiff's fish. Both actually discharge. Fish die. Liability?

Hypo 2: Medical Malpractice - Loss of Chance
Patient has 35% chance of survival. Doctor negligently fails to diagnose cancer. Patient dies. Full damages would be $1M. What can plaintiff recover?

Hypo 3: Product Identification
Three companies make identical brake pads. Plaintiff's brakes fail due to defect. Cannot identify which company made plaintiff's brake pads. All three companies in local market with 30%, 25%, and 45% shares. Plaintiff sues all three. Damages: $500,000. What can plaintiff recover?

Hypo 4: Hunting Accident Variation
Three hunters shoot at duck. All shoot negligently toward plaintiff. One pellet hits plaintiff causing injury. Cannot tell whose pellet. What result?

====================
XIV. POLICY THEMES TO EMPHASIZE
====================

Throughout Week 4, Consider:

1. FAIRNESS
- Between plaintiffs and defendants
- Among defendants
- Allocating risk of uncertainty

2. DETERRENCE
- Incentivizing careful conduct
- Especially in medical context
- Product safety

3. COMPENSATION
- Providing remedy for real injuries
- Even when causation uncertain
- Tort law's compensatory function

4. ADMINISTRABILITY
- Courts need workable rules
- Mass tort contexts
- Avoiding impossible proof burdens

5. EVOLUTION OF LAW
- Common law adapts to modern problems
- Medical advances create new issues
- Complex products and multiple actors
- Mass torts require new solutions

====================
XV. CONNECTIONS TO OTHER TOPICS
====================

Links to Earlier Material:
- Duty (must have duty before causation matters)
- Breach (must have negligence before causation)
- Proximate cause (next topic after causation-in-fact)

Links to Future Topics:
- Joint and several liability
- Contribution and indemnity
