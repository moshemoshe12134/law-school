## THE FAMOUS FACTS (Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad)

**What actually happened:**

- Railroad station platform
- Train pulling away from station
- Two men running to catch train
- One man (with package) helped aboard by conductor
- Package contained **fireworks** (unknown to anyone)
- Package dislodged, fell on tracks
- Fireworks exploded
- Scales at other end of platform knocked over
- Scales hit **Palsgraf** (plaintiff)
- Palsgraf injured, sued railroad

**Key spatial relationships:**
```
[Train] → [Conductor helping man] → [Package falls/explodes]
                                              ↓
                                     [~15-20 feet away]
                                              ↓
                                      [Scales fall] → [Palsgraf injured]
```

**Critical question:**
- Was the railroad negligent toward Palsgraf?
- Or was the railroad's negligence only toward the man with the package?

---

## CORE DOCTRINE

### THE CENTRAL ISSUE: RELATIONSHIP

**Palsgraf is about RELATIONSHIP between defendant and plaintiff**

- Defendant owes duty to SOME people
- Not ALL people
- Who is included? Who is excluded?

**Cardozo's formulation:**
- "The risk reasonably to be perceived defines the duty to be obeyed"
- Duty is limited to foreseeable plaintiffs
- Palsgraf was NOT a foreseeable plaintiff

**Andrews's formulation:**
- Everyone is owed a duty by everyone
- Question is scope of liability, not duty
- Negligence is a general duty to the world

---

## DEFINITIONS TO HAVE READY

**Foreseeable Plaintiff**
- A person who is within the zone of danger created by defendant's conduct
- Someone whose injury is a foreseeable result of defendant's negligence
- Cardozo's approach to limiting liability

**Unforeseeable Plaintiff**
- Someone injured by defendant's negligence but outside the foreseeable zone
- Palsgraf (under Cardozo's view)
- No duty owed to this person

**Duty (Cardozo's usage - confusing!)**
- Used to LIMIT liability based on foreseeability
- Not about general obligation of conduct
- About relationship to specific plaintiff
- Restatement Third criticizes this usage

**Scope of Liability**
- The range of harms for which defendant is responsible
- Modern terminology for what Cardozo called "duty"
- Restatement Third prefers this term

**Legal Cause**
- Sometimes used synonymously with proximate cause
- Sometimes used to mean both cause-in-fact AND scope of liability

**Negligence (as used by Andrews)**
- General duty to all the world
- Scope of liability is the limiting factor, not duty

---

## CASE BRIEFS

### Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad (NY Court of Appeals, 1928)

**Facts:** (see above)

**Procedural History:**
- Trial court verdict for Palsgraf
- Appellate Division affirmed
- Court of Appeals reversed (Cardozo, majority)
- Andrews dissent

**Issue:**
- Does railroad owe duty to Palsgraf?
- Or was Palsgraf an unforeseeable plaintiff?

**Holding (Cardozo, Majority - 4-3):**
- Judgment for defendant (railroad) affirmed
- Railroad owed NO duty to Palsgraf
- Palsgraf was not a foreseeable plaintiff

**Cardozo's Reasoning:**

1. **Negligence is relational:**
   - "The negligence of the defendant is not the wrongful act of the defendant without more"
   - Negligence = duty owed to THIS plaintiff
   - No duty to unforeseeable plaintiffs

2. **Duty defined by risk:**
   - "The risk reasonably to be perceived defines the duty to be obeyed"
   - Duty only to those within foreseeable zone of danger

3. **Palsgraf was unforeseeable:**
   - Package falling ≠ foreseeable to hurt someone 20 feet away
   - Explosion of scales not foreseeable
   - Palsgraf outside the "orbit of the danger"

4. **No duty, no negligence:**
   - If no duty owed, then no negligence toward Palsgraf
   - Case ends at duty element

**Key Cardozo Quotes:**
- "The orbit of the danger as disclosed to the eyes of reasonable vigilance would be the orbit of the duty"
- "If the harm was not willful, it must have been accidental"
- "What the defendant did was wrongful, but it was wrongful only with respect to those within the forecast of harm"

**Andrews's Dissenting Reasoning:**

1. **Duty is universal:**
   - Everyone owes duty to everyone
   - "Everyone owes to the world at large the duty of refraining from those acts that may unreasonably threaten the safety of others"
   - Duty is NOT limited to foreseeable plaintiffs

2. **Negligence is general:**
   - Railroad WAS negligent (to the man with package)
   - Negligence doesn't change based on who is hurt
   - The wrongful act is the same regardless of plaintiff

3. **Scope of liability is the limit:**
   - Question is not duty
   - Question is how far liability extends
   - This is a "proximate cause" question, not duty

4. **Palsgraf was foreseeable enough:**
   - Package could explode
- Explosions can affect people nearby
- Not too remote

5. **Limiting factors:**
   - Time, space, directness
   - But not "unforeseeable plaintiff"

**Key Andrews Quotes:**
- "Because of convenience, of expediency, of policy, our courts have held that liability does not follow... from the cause to the effect"
- "I deny that the plaintiff's status of defendant as a tortfeasor depends upon whether he is liable to the plaintiff or to someone else"

---

### Quisenberry v. Huntington Ingalls (Virginia Supreme Court, modern)

**Facts:**
- Worker injured at shipyard
- Claims employer's negligence caused injury
- Trial court granted summary judgment to employer
- Issue: Was duty owed?

**Holding:**
- Reversed and remanded
- Trial court confused "duty" and "scope of liability" concepts

**Why This Case Matters:**
- Shows modern courts STILL confused about these concepts
- Court trying to clarify "duty" terminology
- Restatement Third commentary would say: Just use "scope of liability"

---

## THE TWO OPINIONS COMPARED

### Cardozo (Majority)

| Aspect | Cardozo's View |
|--------|----------------|
| **Duty** | Limited to foreseeable plaintiffs |
| **Negligence** | Relational - depends on who is plaintiff |
| **Key Question** | Was plaintiff within orbit of danger? |
| **Limiting Device** | Duty (via foreseeability) |
| **Palsgraf** | No duty owed, case ends |

### Andrews (Dissent)

| Aspect | Andrews's View |
|--------|----------------|
| **Duty** | Universal - owed to everyone |
| **Negligence** | General - doesn't depend on plaintiff |
| **Key Question** | Is harm too remote? |
| **Limiting Device** | Scope of liability / proximate cause |
| **Palsgraf** | Duty exists, but scope may limit recovery |

---

## THE DUTY VS. SCOPE DEBATE

### The Confusion: Cardozo's Use of "Duty"

**Cardozo says:**
- No duty to unforeseeable plaintiffs
- Duty ends where foreseeability ends

**Restatement Third says:**
- Cardozo confusingly used "duty" terminology
- Should have said "scope of liability"
- Duty is a general obligation
- Scope is the limitation

**Is there a REAL distinction?**

**Conceptual distinction:**
- Duty = obligation to act/not act in certain way
- Scope = range of consequences for breach

**Practical distinction:**
- If duty = general, everyone passes duty element
- Then scope/proximate cause becomes key
- If duty = limited, many plaintiffs lose at duty stage

**Why Cardozo's approach might matter:**
- Jury instruction differences
- Summary judgment timing
- Legal analysis structure

**Why it might NOT matter:**
- Same outcome (Palsgraf loses) either way
- Just label difference

---

## EXPECTED HUANG QUESTIONS

**Opening Framing:**
1. "Why is Palsgraf the most famous torts case?"
2. "What's the disagreement between Cardozo and Andrews really about?"
3. "Is it a substantive disagreement or just semantics?"

**On Cardozo's Opinion:**
1. "What does Cardozo mean by 'negligence is relational'?"
2. "Why does Cardozo focus on duty rather than proximate cause?"
3. "What is 'the orbit of the danger'?"
4. "Was Palsgraf really unforeseeable?"
5. "What if the package was labeled 'fireworks'?"

**On Andrews's Dissent:**
1. "What does Andrews mean by 'universal duty'?"
2. "Why does Andrews think Cardozo's approach is wrong?"
3. "What's Andrews's limiting principle then?"
4. "Would Andrews reach the same result in some cases?"

**Comparison Questions:**
1. "Do Cardozo and Andrews actually disagree on the outcome?"
2. "What's the REAL difference between their approaches?"
3. "Is it just labels ('duty' vs 'scope of liability')?"
4. "Does it matter which framework we use?"

**Modern Application (Quisenberry):**
1. "What is the Quisenberry court confused about?"
2. "How would Restatement Third clarify this?"
3. "Is 'duty' the right word for what the court is trying to figure out?"

**Restatement Third Questions:**
1. "What does Restatement Third say about Cardozo's 'duty' usage?"
2. "Is there a distinction between 'scope of liability' and 'duty'?"
3. "As a conceptual matter? As a practical matter?"

**Posner's Critique:**
1. "What facts did Cardozo leave out?"
2. "Why does that matter for our analysis?"
3. "Does Posner think Cardozo got it wrong?"

---

## QUICK HYPOS

### Hypo 1: The Known Fireworks
- Same facts, but package clearly labeled "DANGEROUS FIREWORKS"
- Is Palsgraf foreseeable now?

**Cardozo:** Still probably no - too far away
**Andrews:** More likely yes - danger known

### Hypo 2: The Closer Plaintiff
- Palsgraf standing 3 feet from man with package
- Still hit by falling scales

**Cardozo:** Probably yes - within orbit of danger
**Andrews:** Yes - clearly within scope

### Hypo 3: The Different Harm
- Man drops package, it explodes, burns man's foot
- Palsgraf (standing far away) not hurt

**Man sues railroad:**
- **Cardozo:** Yes - foreseeable plaintiff
- **Andrews:** Yes - duty exists, scope includes

### Hypo 4: The Intervening Criminal
- D leaves car running (negligent)
- Thief steals car (intervening crime)
- Thief crashes into P

**Cardozo approach:** Thief unforeseeable? No duty to P?
**Andrews approach:** Duty exists, scope may exclude due to superseding cause
**Modern approach:** Car theft creates risk of reckless driving - likely within scope

### Hypo 5: The Rescuer
- D negligently starts fire in building
- Firefighter P injured fighting fire
- Firefighter Q injured when arsonist (unrelated) sets second fire nearby

**P (injured by D's fire):**
- Cardozo: Firefighter foreseeable → duty
- Andrews: Duty exists, scope includes

**Q (injured by arsonist's fire):**
- Cardozo: No foreseeability to D's act → no duty
- Andrews: Duty exists, but scope may exclude (intervening arson?)

---

## POLICY/THEORY

**Why Cardozo's approach?**

1. **Clarity** - Draw line at duty stage
2. **Jury control** - Judges decide duty, juries decide facts
3. **Limiting liability** - Prevents infinite liability
4. **Fairness** - Only responsible for foreseeable risks

**Why Andrews's approach?**

1. **Honesty** - We all owe duty to each other
2. **Transparency** - Put limiting issues on table
3. **Flexibility** - Scope analysis is fact-specific
4. **Policy** - Courts can draw lines where appropriate

**Why modern preference for "scope of liability"?**

1. **Avoids confusion** - Duty is general, scope is the limit
2. **Clearer analysis** - Don't hide the ball at duty stage
3. **Consistent** - Duty = general obligation

For finding relevant materials:
- "Palsgraf v Long Island Railroad"
- "unforeseeable plaintiff"
- "Cardozo Andrews dissent Palsgraf"
- "duty versus proximate cause"
- "scope of liability duty"

## EXAM SIGNALS

**When you see these facts, think Palsgraf/duty/scope:**

1. **Plaintiff far removed** from defendant's conduct
2. **Unusual plaintiff** - not the typical victim
3. **Chain of events** - multiple steps from act to injury
4. "Was the plaintiff foreseeable?"
5. "Was the plaintiff within the zone of danger?"
6. "What duty was owed?"
7. **Multiple potential plaintiffs** - some close, some far

**Issue-spotting checklist:**
- [ ] Who is the plaintiff?
- [ ] Was plaintiff within the foreseeable zone of danger?
- [ ] What "orbit of danger" did defendant create?
- [ ] Does duty exist (Cardozo) or is this a scope question (Andrews)?
- [ ] How would Cardozo analyze? Andrews? Restatement Third?
- [ ] Is there any modern confusion (like Quisenberry)?

**Palsgraf on exams:**
- Cite both Cardozo and Andrews
- Distinguish their approaches
- Apply both and show you understand the difference
- Note that Restatement Third criticizes Cardozo's "duty" terminology
- If asked for your view: Modern "scope of liability" is clearer

---

## NOTES FOR CLASS DISCUSSION

1. **Read both opinions carefully** - We'll start with Andrews
2. **Think about the labels** - Duty vs. scope vs. proximate cause
3. **Cardozo's facts were selective** - Posner points this out
4. **Quisenberry shows confusion persists** - Modern courts still struggle
5. **Restatement Third has a view** - Read comments e, f, g closely
