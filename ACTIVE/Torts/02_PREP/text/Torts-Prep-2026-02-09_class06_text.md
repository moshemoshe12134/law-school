## CORE DOCTRINE

### I. CAUSATION-IN-FACT ("BUT-FOR" CAUSATION)

**Definition**: Set of analytical tools for determining which parties can be said to have caused harm - a required element for tort liability.

**The But-For Test (Standard Rule):**

> "But for the defendant's negligence, would the plaintiff's harm have occurred?"

**Application:**
- If answer is **NO** (harm would NOT have occurred but for defendant's conduct) → **causation established**
- If answer is **YES** (harm would have occurred anyway) → **no causation**

**Burden of Proof:**
- Plaintiff must prove causation by **preponderance of evidence** (>50%)
- More likely than not that defendant's conduct caused the harm

**Example:**
- Doctor fails to diagnose cancer
- Patient had 51% chance of survival with timely diagnosis
- Patient dies
- But for doctor's failure, would patient have lived? → YES (>50% chance)
- Causation proven

**When But-For Test Fails:**
- Patient had <50% chance of survival
- Traditional rule: NO recovery even if negligence reduced chance to 0%
- Problem: "all or nothing" rule creates arbitrary threshold

---

### II. LOSS OF CHANCE DOCTRINE (Matsuyama v. Birnbaum)

**Revolutionary Concept:**
- **Loss of chance is a THEORY OF INJURY, not a theory of causation**
- The injury = **diminished likelihood of achieving a more favorable medical outcome**
- The chance of survival has VALUE even if <50%

**Requirements:**
1. **Medical malpractice context** (doctrine limited to this area)
2. Physician's negligence reduced patient's prospects
3. Plaintiff proves by preponderance that negligence CAUSED the diminished likelihood
4. Expert testimony required (survival statistics, staging, etc.)

**Key Distinction:**
- NOT: "Doctor caused death" (traditional causation - fails if <50%)
- IS: "Doctor caused loss of 37.5% chance of survival" (injury theory)

**Damages Calculation - Proportional Approach:**

| Step | Question |
|------|----------|
| 1 | Calculate FULL wrongful death damages (as if not loss of chance case) |
| 2 | Determine chance of survival BEFORE malpractice |
| 3 | Determine chance of survival AFTER/AS RESULT OF malpractice |
| 4 | Subtract Step 3 from Step 2 = percentage loss |
| 5 | Multiply Step 1 × Step 4 = award |

**Matsuyama Example:**
- Full wrongful death damages: $875,000
- Chance before negligence: 37.5% (Stage 2 cancer)
- Chance after negligence: 0% (Stage 4, terminal)
- Loss: 37.5%
- Award: $875,000 × 0.375 = $328,125

**Policy Justifications:**
1. **Deterrence**: Incentivizes proper medical care even for seriously ill
2. **Fairness**: Compensates for real loss (the chance itself)
3. **Justice**: Doesn't give "free pass" when patient <50%
4. **Medical science**: Can now quantify chances reliably

**Limitations:**
- Currently limited to medical malpractice
- Requires reliable statistical evidence
- May expand to other areas in future

---

### III. MULTIPLE SUFFICIENT CAUSES

**The Problem:**
What if TWO independent causes, each alone sufficient to cause the entire harm?

**Example (The Two Fires):**
- Fire A (negligently set) + Fire B (lightning strike)
- Each fire alone sufficient to burn house
- Both reach house simultaneously
- House burns down
- But for Fire A, would house have burned? **YES** (Fire B would have done it)
- But for Fire B, would house have burned? **YES** (Fire A would have done it)
- **Traditional but-for test FAILS**

**Solution: Substantial Factor Test**
- Each cause is a "substantial factor" in bringing about harm
- Both defendants liable
- Not limited to but-for causation
- Recognizes overdetermined causation

**Restatement Third § 27:**
- When multiple sufficient causes, each is a cause-in-fact if it was a substantial factor
- Applies even if harm would have occurred anyway

**Key Question:**
What if ONE of the multiple sufficient causes is **NON-TORTIOUS** (e.g., natural event, non-negligent act)?
- Example: Defendant's fire + lightning strike both sufficient
- Is defendant off the hook?
- **Answer**: No - defendant's conduct was still a substantial factor

---

### IV. FAILURE TO WARN CAUSATION

**But-For Analysis in Warning Cases:**
Question: Would adequate warning have prevented the harm?

**Factors to Consider:**
1. Would warning have reached the person at risk?
2. Would person have read/understood warning?
3. Would person have **heeded** warning?
4. Would heeding warning have prevented harm?

**Burden:**
- Plaintiff must show warning would have made a difference
- More likely than not that warning would have been heeded
- Causation still required (warning defects don't automatically = liability)

---

## DEFINITIONS TO HAVE READY

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Causation-in-Fact** | Factual causation - did defendant's conduct actually cause plaintiff's harm? |
| **But-For Test** | "But for defendant's conduct, would harm have occurred?" If no, causation exists |
| **Loss of Chance** | Diminished likelihood of favorable outcome - recognized as INJURY, not modified causation |
| **Multiple Sufficient Causes** | Two+ independent causes, each alone sufficient to cause entire harm |
| **Substantial Factor** | Alternative to but-for test when multiple sufficient causes exist |
| **Overdetermined Causation** | Harm would have occurred anyway due to other cause(s) |
| **Preponderance of Evidence** | >50% probability standard |
| **Proportional Damages** | Damages reduced by percentage of chance lost |

---

## EXPECTED HUANG QUESTIONS

### Q: "What is causation-in-fact and why do we require it?"

**A:** Causation-in-fact is the factual link between defendant's conduct and plaintiff's harm - the requirement that defendant's action actually caused the injury. We require it because:
1. **Fairness**: Don't hold people liable for harms they didn't cause
2. **Deterrence**: Want to deter risky behavior, not all behavior
3. **Corrective justice**: Liability should track actual responsibility
4. **Limits**: Prevents infinite liability for distant events

### Q: "How does the but-for test work?"

**A:** The but-for test asks: "But for defendant's negligence, would plaintiff's harm have occurred?"
- If **NO** → causation established (defendant's action was necessary for harm)
- If **YES** → no causation (harm would have happened anyway)
- Plaintiff proves by preponderance (>50% probability)

### Q: "When does the but-for test fail?"

**A:** The but-for test fails when:
1. **Multiple sufficient causes**: Two independent causes, each alone sufficient to cause harm (e.g., two fires)
2. **Indeterminate defendant**: Can't identify which of multiple defendants caused harm (e.g., Summers v. Tice - next class)
3. **Loss of chance situations**: Patient had <50% chance, so harm (death) would have occurred anyway (but loss of chance doctrine solves this)

### Q: "Is loss of chance a causation theory or an injury theory?"

**A:** **Injury theory** - this is the key move in Matsuyama. The injury is NOT death (which would have occurred anyway given <50% chance). The injury IS the **diminished likelihood of survival** - the loss of the chance itself. Plaintiff must still prove by preponderance that doctor's negligence CAUSED this diminished likelihood. But once that's shown, the chance has value and damages are proportional.

### Q: "Why limit loss of chance to medical malpractice?"

**A:** Court's reasons:
1. **Reliable evidence**: Medical science can quantify chances (survival rates, staging)
2. **Professional relationship**: Special trust in doctor-patient relationship
3. **Common context**: Not unusual for patients to have <50% chance at presentation
4. **Responsibility**: Doctor who makes outcome unknowable should bear consequences

### Q: "What's the difference between multiple sufficient causes and alternative liability?"

**A:**
- **Multiple sufficient causes**: Two+ causes EACH contribute to harm, each alone sufficient (e.g., two fires burning house simultaneously)
- **Alternative liability**: Multiple defendants acted negligently, but only ONE caused harm and we can't tell which (e.g., Summers v. Tice - two hunters, one bullet)

### Q: "What if one of the multiple sufficient causes is non-tortious?"

**A:** The tortious cause is still liable. Example: Negligent fire + lightning strike (natural) both sufficient to burn house. The negligent actor's fire was still a substantial factor in causing the harm. The existence of a non-tortious sufficient cause doesn't absolve the tortfeasor.

## CASE BRIEFS

### Matsuyama v. Birnbaum, 452 Mass. 1 (2008)

#### Rule of Law
Massachusetts law permits recovery for "loss of chance" in medical malpractice wrongful death actions, where a physician's negligence reduces or eliminates a patient's prospects for achieving a more favorable medical outcome, even if the possibility of recovery was less than even prior to the physician's tortious conduct.

#### Facts
1. Kimiyoshi Matsuyama (age 42 in 1995) became patient of Dr. Birnbaum
2. Matsuyama had multiple risk factors for gastric cancer: Asian ancestry, smoking history, persistent gastric complaints since 1988
3. Dr. Birnbaum treated symptoms with OTC medications from 1995-1999 without ordering definitive testing (upper GI series or endoscopy)
4. May 1999: Finally ordered GI series, discovered 2cm mass
5. Diagnosis: Infiltrative gastric adenoid carcinoma, signet ring cell type
6. October 1999: Matsuyama died from gastric cancer
7. **Key evidence**: If diagnosed in 1995 (Stage 2), Matsuyama had 37.5% chance of 5-year survival

#### Procedural History
- June 2000: Plaintiff filed suit
- July 2004: Trial (6 days)
- Jury found: (1) Dr. Birnbaum negligent; (2) negligence was "substantial contributing factor" to death; (3) Matsuyama had stage 2 cancer at time of initial negligence; (4) 37.5% chance of survival at that time
- Jury awarded: $875,000 full wrongful death damages × 0.375 = $328,125 loss of chance damages + $160,000 pain and suffering
- Defendants appealed

#### Issue
Does Massachusetts law permit recovery for "loss of chance" in medical malpractice wrongful death actions when the patient had less than 50% chance of survival?

#### Holding & Reasoning
#### (Marshall, C.J.)
**Yes.** Massachusetts adopts loss of chance doctrine in medical malpractice actions.

1. **"All or Nothing" Rule Problems**: Traditional rule requires >50% chance for recovery. This creates illogical results: patient with 51% chance gets full recovery; patient with 49% chance gets NOTHING even if negligence reduced chance to 0%. This:
   - Fails to fairly allocate costs and risks
   - Fails to deter medical negligence (immunizes whole areas of practice)
   - Fails to provide proper incentives for standard of care
   - Fails to compensate victims for real harm

2. **Loss of Chance as Theory of INJURY, Not Causation**:
   - The injury is: diminished likelihood of achieving more favorable outcome
   - Patient's probability of survival is part of patient's condition
   - "No one can say that the chance of prolonging one's life...is valueless"
   - Statistical likelihood is NOT "mere speculation" - based on accepted medical data

3. **Maintains Preponderance Standard**: Plaintiff must still prove by >50% that physician's negligence CAUSED the diminished likelihood. This doesn't lower burden of proof.

4. **Limited to Medical Malpractice**:
   - Reliable expert evidence more available in medical cases
   - Contravenes doctor-patient relationship expectations
   - Not uncommon for patients to have <50% chance at presentation
   - Forces least capable party to bear consequences of uncertainty

5. **Proportional Damages Approach**:
   - Full wrongful death damages × percentage chance lost
   - Ensures defendant liable only for portion of prospects destroyed
   - Fairly apportions damages consistent with degree of fault
   - Doesn't overcompensate plaintiff

6. **Compatible with Wrongful Death Statute**: Wrongful death has common law origins; statute imposes procedural requirements but doesn't limit common law evolution.

#### Disposition
**AFFIRMED**. Judgment for plaintiff upheld.

## RESTATEMENT PROVISIONS

### Restatement (Third) of Torts: Apportionment of Liability

**§ 26. Factual Cause**
An actor's tortious conduct is a factual cause of harm when the harm would not have occurred without the conduct - the traditional but-for test.

### Restatement (Third) of Torts: Apportionment of Liability

**§ 27. Multiple Sufficient Causes**
When two or more acts exist, each of which alone would have been a factual cause under § 26, the harm is treated as caused by each act.

**Key Points:**
- Abandons strict but-for test for multiple sufficient causes
- Each substantial factor = factual cause
- Applies even if harm would have occurred anyway
- Comment d: Explains application and limits

**Comparison to Restatement (Second):**
- Second Restatement: Different approach to multiple sufficient causes
- Third Restatement: clearer articulation of substantial factor test
- Huang wants us to compare the two approaches

### Restatement (Third) of Torts: Apportionment of Liability

**§ 36. Burden of Proof as to Factual Cause**
(Read for comparison to other burden-shifting doctrines)

**Key Questions:**
- When does plaintiff's burden shift to defendant?
- How does this differ from alternative liability (Summers)?
- How does this differ from market share liability (Hymowitz)?

## POLICY/THEORY

### Why Require Causation?

1. **Fairness**: Don't hold liable for things you didn't cause
2. **Deterrence**: Want to deter risky behavior, not all behavior
3. **Corrective Justice**: Liability should track actual responsibility
4. **Limits**: Prevents infinite backward-looking liability

### The "All or Nothing" Problem

**Traditional Rule Critique:**
| Scenario | Chance Before | Chance After | Recovery |
|----------|---------------|--------------|----------|
| Patient A | 51% | 0% | Full damages |
| Patient B | 49% | 0% | NOTHING |

**Why This is Unjust:**
- Arbitrary 50% threshold
- Immunizes negligence when patient already seriously ill
- Denies compensation for real loss (the chance itself)
- Perverse incentive: doctors less careful with sicker patients

### Loss of Chance Policy Arguments

**FOR Adoption:**
1. **Real harm exists**: Chance of survival has value
2. **Deterrence**: Doctors careful even with <50% patients
3. **Fairness**: Defendant who makes outcome unknowable should bear consequences
4. **Medical science**: Can now quantify chances reliably
5. **No overcompensation**: Proportional damages

**AGAINST Adoption:**
1. **Not traditional causation**: Changes fundamental element
2. **Jury confusion**: Hard to explain "injury" isn't death
3. **Floodgates**: Opens door to other non-traditional causation theories
4. **Expert testimony battles**: Turns cases into battle of statisticians

### Multiple Sufficient Causes Policy

**Why Substantial Factor Test:**
- But-for test would fail in overdetermined cases
- Fairness: each tortfeasor should be liable for their contribution
- Deterrence: doesn't let people escape because others also caused harm
- Practical: workable rule for juries

**Key Policy Question:**
Should non-tortious sufficient cause absolve tortfeasor?
- **Majority view**: No - tortfeasor still liable
- **Rationale**: Tortious conduct was still substantial factor

---

## QUICK HYPOS

### Hypo 1: Standard But-For Causation

**Facts**: Driver runs red light and hits Pedestrian. Pedestrian suffers broken leg.

**Analysis**:
- But for driver running red light, would Pedestrian have broken leg? **NO**
- Causation established
- Proceed to breach/damages analysis

---

### Hypo 2: But-For Test Fails - Preexisting Condition

**Facts**: Driver negligently hits Pedestrian who has brittle bone disease. Pedestrian's leg breaks from impact that wouldn't break normal bone. Evidence shows leg would have broken within week from normal walking due to disease.

**Issue**: Does causation exist?

**Arguments**:
- **Plaintiff**: But for driver's negligence, break wouldn't have happened TODAY (tortious act accelerated harm)
- **Defense**: Harm would have occurred anyway within week; no causation for permanent injury

**Huang Push**: What if evidence shows break would have occurred in 1 year? 1 month? 1 day? Where's the line?

---

### Hypo 3: Loss of Chance - Medical Malpractice

**Facts**: Patient has 40% chance of survival with timely cancer diagnosis. Doctor fails to diagnose, delays treatment by 6 months. Patient's cancer progresses to Stage 4 (0% chance). Patient dies. Full wrongful death damages = $1,000,000.

**Analysis**:
- Traditional but-for test: Would patient have died anyway? **YES** (60% chance of death) → no recovery
- Loss of chance doctrine:
  - Injury = loss of 40% chance of survival
  - Damages = $1,000,000 × 0.40 = $400,000

**Huang Push**: Is this fair? Why proportional damages instead of full? Why limited to medical cases?

---

### Hypo 4: Multiple Sufficient Causes - Two Fires

**Facts**: Fire A set negligently by Arsonist. Fire B caused by lightning strike (act of God). Each fire alone sufficient to burn House. Both fires reach House simultaneously. House burns down.

**Analysis**:
- But-for Fire A: Would House have burned? **YES** (lightning would have done it)
- But-for Fire B: Would House have burned? **YES** (arson fire would have done it)
- Traditional but-for test: FAILS
- Substantial factor test: Fire A was substantial factor → Arsonist liable

**Huang Push**: Does it matter that lightning was non-tortious? What if both fires were negligently set by different people?

---

### Hypo 5: Multiple Sufficient Causes - Two Polluters

**Facts**: Factory A and Factory B both discharge toxins into River. Either discharge alone sufficient to kill all Fish in River. Both actually discharge simultaneously. Fish die.

**Analysis**:
- Each discharge alone sufficient → but-for test fails for each
- Substantial factor test: Both factories liable
- Each liable for full damages (joint and several)

**Huang Push**: What if Factory B was complying with all regulations (non-negligent)? Is Factory A still liable? (Yes - substantial factor, not fault-based)

---

### Hypo 6: Failure to Warn Causation

**Facts**: Pharmaceutical company fails to warn that Drug causes drowsiness. Driver takes Drug, falls asleep at wheel, crashes. Evidence shows Driver never reads warnings anyway. Counter-evidence: Driver's Wife always reads warnings and would have stopped him.

**Analysis**:
- Duty exists (manufacturer must warn)
- Breach exists ( inadequate warning)
- **Causation question**: Would adequate warning have prevented crash?
- **Huang's focus**: Heeding/causation - would warning have been read, understood, followed?

**Arguments**:
- Plaintiff: Wife would have read, would have stopped him → causation
- Defense: Driver never reads warnings → no causation

---

### Hypo 7: Loss of Chance Calculation

**Facts**: Patient has 25% chance of survival with timely diagnosis. Doctor negligently fails to diagnose. By time of discovery, chance drops to 10%. Patient dies. Full wrongful death damages = $500,000.

**Calculation**:
- Step 1: Full damages = $500,000
- Step 2: Chance before = 25%
- Step 3: Chance after = 10%
- Step 4: Loss = 25% - 10% = 15%
- Step 5: Award = $500,000 × 0.15 = $75,000

**Huang Push**: Is this fair? Why not $125,000 (25% of $500,000)? What's the difference?

---

### Hypo 8: Multiple Sufficient Causes with Timing

**Facts**: Fire A starts at 10:00 AM, will reach House at 11:00 AM. Fire B starts at 10:30 AM, will reach House at 10:45 AM. Fire B burns House at 10:45 AM. Fire A would have burned House at 11:00 AM.

**Analysis**:
- Fire B alone sufficient? **YES** (burned House first)
- Fire A alone sufficient? **MAYBE** - would have burned House but didn't get there first
- But-for test: But for Fire A, would House have burned? **YES** (Fire B did it first)
- Is Fire A liable?

**Huang Push**: Does timing matter? What if fires started simultaneously? What if Fire A was faster but started later?

## EXAM SIGNALS

#EXAM_SIGNAL

**Huang's Emphasis:**

1. **Distinguish causation-in-fact from proximate cause**: Causation-in-fact = factual link; proximate cause = legal limits on liability (scope). Don't confuse them!

2. **Loss of chance is INJURY not causation**: This is the key move in Matsuyama. Plaintiff must still prove negligence CAUSED the lost chance. But the injury is the lost chance, not death.

3. **When but-for test fails, look for:**
   - Multiple sufficient causes → use substantial factor test
   - Indeterminate defendant → look for alternative liability (Summers - next class)
   - Loss of chance situation → use loss of chance doctrine (medical only)

4. **Causation in failure to warn cases**: Always ask: would adequate warning have made a difference? Plaintiff must prove heeding/causation, not just inadequate warning.

5. **Non-tortious sufficient causes don't absolve**: If your negligent fire + lightning both sufficient, you're still liable. Your conduct was a substantial factor.

6. **Damages calculation matters**: In loss of chance, know how to calculate proportional damages. It's likely to be tested.

**Exam Checklist:**
- [ ] Start with but-for test
- [ ] Identify when but-for test fails
- [ ] Apply appropriate alternative test (substantial factor, loss of chance, alternative liability, market share)
- [ ] Don't confuse causation-in-fact with proximate cause
- [ ] For failure to warn: analyze heeding/causation
- [ ] For loss of chance: calculate proportional damages correctly
- [ ] For multiple sufficient causes: identify all causes and their tortious status
