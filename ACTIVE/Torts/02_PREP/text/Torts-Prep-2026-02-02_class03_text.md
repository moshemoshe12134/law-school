# Text Prep — Class #3 — Implementing Negligence

**Monday, February 2, 2026 | Panel: Bluebird (I'm ON CALL)**

---

## CORE QUESTIONS

**How should courts implement the negligence standard?**

1. **Rules vs. Standards:** Rigid rules ("stop at railroad crossings") or flexible standards ("reasonable care")?
2. **Judge vs. Jury:** Who decides if conduct was negligent?
3. **External Sources:** Import structure from custom, professional standards, statutes?

---

## JUDGE VS. JURY (KA 103-108)

**Judge decides (law):** Duty, standard of care, directed verdict if reasonable minds couldn't differ

**Jury decides (fact):** Breach, causation, damages

**In practice:** Negligence almost always jury question. Judges rarely take it away.

---

## RULES VS. STANDARDS: RAILROAD CASES

### *B&O RR v. Goodman* (1927) — Rule Approach

**Facts:** Driver crossed tracks without stopping, hit by train, killed.  
**Holmes holding:** Must stop, get out, look. Failure = negligent as matter of law.  
**Rationale:** Bright-line rule provides certainty.  
**Problem:** Doesn't account for variation (view blocked, stopping more dangerous).

### *Pokora v. Wabash Railway* (1934) — Standard Approach

**Facts:** Similar. View blocked by boxcars.  
**Cardozo holding:** Overrules Goodman. No rigid rule. Jury question based on circumstances.  
**Quote:** "Conduct is not to be judged by a rule of thumb."  
**Rationale:** Sometimes stopping useless or dangerous. Flexible standard adapts.

**Tension:** Rules = certainty vs. over/under-inclusive | Standards = flexibility vs. unpredictability

---

## CUSTOM (KA 85-89)

**General Rule:** Custom is evidence, NOT conclusive.

- Complying with custom = some evidence of reasonableness (not defense)
- Departing from custom = strong evidence of negligence (not automatic)

### *The T.J. Hooper* (1932)

**Facts:** Tugboat towing barges. No radio (not yet standard). Barges sank in storm.  
**Hand holding:** Negligent despite following industry custom.  
**Quote:** "A whole calling may have unduly lagged in the adoption of new and available devices."  
**Takeaway:** Whole industry can be negligent. Courts impose independent duty.

---

## MALPRACTICE (KA 89-93, sections A and B)

**Special rule:** Professionals held to standard of their profession, not lay reasonable person.

**Rule:** Negligent if fail to exercise "skill and learning commonly possessed by members of the profession in good standing."

**Features:**
- Profession sets standard (unlike general custom)
- Requires expert testimony
- Locality rule mostly abolished (now national standard)

**Why defer?**  
1. Juries can't judge medical decisions  
2. Complexity of medical trade-offs  
3. Professional norms best suited to balance risks/benefits

**Problem:** Profession-protective? Courts increasingly find "common knowledge" exceptions.

**Illinois Jury Instructions:**
- **IPI 105.01 (Malpractice):** "...ordinarily possessed and used by other [specialty] practicing in the community"
- **IPI 105.03.01 (Informed Consent):** Uses "reasonable practitioner" standard—closer to general negligence

---

## NEGLIGENCE PER SE (KA 99-103)

**Doctrine:** Statutory violation = negligent as matter of law

**Requirements:**
1. Defendant violated statute
2. Statute designed to prevent this type of harm
3. Plaintiff in protected class
4. Violation proximately caused injury

**Why?**  
1. Legislative judgment  
2. Clarity (more concrete than "reasonable care")  
3. Deterrence

**Defenses (Legally Cognizable Excuses):**
- Compliance impossible or more dangerous
- Violation reasonable under circumstances
- Statute's purpose wouldn't be served

**Limited Statutory Purpose:** Was this harm the kind statute meant to prevent?
- Example: Brake light statute—meant to prevent collisions while moving, not while stopped at red light

---

## KEY CASES

**Baltimore & Ohio RR v. Goodman** (1927) — Rule approach (overruled by Pokora)

**Pokora v. Wabash Railway** (1934) — Standard approach ("not judged by rule of thumb")

**The T.J. Hooper** (1932) — Custom not conclusive ("whole calling may lag")

**Core v. N.C. Parks & Recreation** (pp. 19-23) — Rules vs. standards contrast [SOURCE NEEDED]

**White v. Sabatino** (pp. 6-11, 42-48) — Negligence per se illustration [SOURCE NEEDED]

---

## COLD-CALL PREP

**Rules vs. Standards:** Goodman rigid rule → Pokora overruled → jury question. Tension: certainty vs. flexibility.

**Custom:** Evidence, not conclusive. T.J. Hooper: Whole industry can lag. Courts impose independent duty.

**Malpractice:** Profession sets standard. Expert testimony required. Informed consent = reasonable practitioner standard.

**Negligence Per Se:** Statutory violation = negligent if statute meant to prevent this harm, plaintiff in protected class, violation caused injury. Defenses: compliance impossible/dangerous/unreasonable.

---

## QUICK HYPOS

**Hypo 1 (Rules vs. Standards):** Driver slows to 5 mph at railroad crossing (view blocked), listens, proceeds. Hit by train.
- Goodman: Negligent (didn't stop/get out)
- Pokora: Jury question (slowing/listening maybe reasonable)

**Hypo 2 (Custom):** Plant uses industry-standard tanks. Tanks leak. Defendant says "everyone uses these."
- Not conclusive. T.J. Hooper: Jury can find better technology should've been used.

**Hypo 3 (Malpractice):** Doctor uses standard technique. 2% complication occurs.
- No negligence. Met professional standard. Bad outcome ≠ negligence.

**Hypo 4 (Informed Consent):** Doctor doesn't warn of 2% risk. Complication occurs.
- Informed consent claim. Did doctor disclose material risks reasonable practitioner would?

**Hypo 5 (Negligence Per Se):** Broken brake light. Stopped at red light. Plaintiff rear-ends defendant.
- Limited statutory purpose: Statute meant to prevent collisions while moving, not while stopped.

**Hypo 6 (Neg. Per Se + Excuse):** Crosses double-yellow line to avoid child. Collides with plaintiff.
- Excuse: Compliance more dangerous (would've hit child). Violation reasonable under circumstances.
