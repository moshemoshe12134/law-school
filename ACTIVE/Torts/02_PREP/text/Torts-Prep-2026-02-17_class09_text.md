## CORE DOCTRINE

### THE PROBLEM: UNLIMITED LIABILITY

**Why we need this doctrine:**
- But-for causation creates an infinite chain of causes
- Every event has infinite causes going back to the Big Bang
- We need a way to LIMIT liability to those causes that "matter"

**Example chain:**
- Driver runs red light → hits car → car hits pedestrian → pedestrian drops phone → phone breaks
- But-for the red light: phone intact
- But-for the driver's birth: phone intact
- But-for the invention of cars: phone intact
- We need to stop the chain somewhere!

## TWO FRAMEWORKS (KEEP DISTINCT!)

### 1. TRADITIONAL APPROACH: "PROXIMATE CAUSE"

**Language:**
- "Proximate cause"
- "Direct cause"
- "Intervening cause"
- "Superseding cause"

**Key Questions:**
- Was the defendant's conduct a "proximate" cause of plaintiff's harm?
- Was there an "intervening cause" that breaks the chain?
- Was the harm "foreseeable"?

**NJ Jury Instruction 6.10 Summary:**
- Proximate cause is a cause that is a substantial factor in bringing about the harm
- Not necessarily the closest in time or space
- Must be reasonably foreseeable

**NJ Jury Instruction 6.14 Summary:**
- Superseding/intervening cause may break the chain of liability
- Independent wrongful act of third person may be superseding
- Criminal acts of others often superseding (but not always)

---

### 2. MODERN APPROACH: "SCOPE OF LIABILITY" (Restatement Third)

**Language:**
- "Scope of the risk" created by defendant's conduct
- "Harm within the risk"
- No "proximate" or "intervening" terminology

**Key Question (Restatement Third § 29):**
> "Is the harm within the scope of the risk created by the defendant's tortious conduct?"

**Restatement Third § 29 Comment d Framework:**

When defendant's conduct creates a risk, defendant is liable for:
1. **Harms that result** from the force/situation created by defendant's conduct
2. **Even if harms occur through:**
   - Innocent, negligent, even reckless acts of others
   - Extraordinary natural events
   - Animal behavior

**Key insight from new approach:**
- Most what traditional approach calls "intervening causes"
- Are simply "harms within the risk" under new approach
- The question is not WHO intervened, but WHAT harm occurred

---

## DEFINITIONS TO HAVE READY

**Proximate Cause** (traditional)
- A cause that is sufficiently related to defendant's conduct to hold them liable
- Not about physical proximity - about legal responsibility
- Often tied to foreseeability

**Scope of Liability** (modern, Restatement Third)
- The range of harms for which defendant should be held responsible
- Based on the risks created by defendant's conduct
- Uses "harm within the risk" analysis

**Intervening Cause** (traditional)
- An event that occurs after defendant's conduct
- May "break the chain" of causation
- Can be superseding (relieves liability) or not (liability remains)

**Harm Within the Risk** (modern)
- Harm that is of the same general nature as the harm made likely by defendant's conduct
- The TYPE of harm matters, not the specific MECHANISM

**Foreseeability**
- Traditional approach: central concept
- Modern approach: still relevant but different role
- Refers to whether the type of harm was foreseeable, not the exact sequence

---

## CASE BRIEFS

### Berry v. Sugar Notch (Pennsylvania, 1899)

**Facts:**
- Berry driving wagon through Sugar Notch borough
- Windstorm blew down a decaying tree
- Tree fell on Berry, killing him
- Tree was on borough land, near road
- Borough knew tree was decayed but didn't remove it
- Wind speed at time: about 40 mph
- Borough ordinance set speed limit at 8 mph for "rapid driving"
- Berry was going maybe 8-10 mph (evidence disputed)

**Procedural History:**
- Jury found for Berry (plaintiff)
- Borough appealed

**Issue:**
- Was Berry's speed (if over 8 mph) an "intervening/superseding cause" that broke the chain?
- Or was the tree the proximate cause regardless?

**Holding:**
- Judgment for plaintiff AFFIRMED
- Berry's speed did NOT break the chain of causation
- Borough's negligence in maintaining the tree was the proximate cause

**Reasoning:**
- The tree was ready to fall
- It would have fallen "on anything"
- Berry's speed was coincidental, not causative
- The wind + tree defect = accident, not Berry's speed

**Key Quote (paraphrased):**
- "The tree would have fallen on a dog, a pedestrian, or a carriage traveling at any speed"
- The defendant's negligence (failing to remove tree) was the operating cause

**Why This Case Matters:**
- Tests our intuitions about what "really caused" the harm
- Shows how courts reject intervening cause when defendant's negligence set everything in motion
- Demonstrates the "but for" vs. "proximate cause" distinction

---

### Jones v. Roth (Practice Fact Pattern)

**Facts (from pp. 1-7, 12-16):**
- Review the fact pattern carefully before class
- This will be used for practice applying both frameworks

**Questions to Consider:**
- What risks did defendant's conduct create?
- What harm actually occurred?
- Was the harm "within the risk"?
- Would traditional analysis find an "intervening cause"?

---

## EXPECTED HUANG QUESTIONS

**Opening Framing Questions:**
1. "Why don't we hold liable everyone who was a 'but-for' cause?"
2. "What's the difference between cause-in-fact and proximate cause?"
3. "Berry's wagon hits the tree - did the tree 'cause' the accident, or did Berry?"

**Berry v. Sugar Notch Questions:**
1. "What was the borough's negligent act?"
2. "What was the immediate physical cause of Berry's death?"
3. "If Berry was speeding, does that matter? Why or why not?"
4. "Would it matter if Berry was driving 20 mph instead of 8-10?"
5. "What if Berry had swerved intentionally and then the tree fell?"
6. "Is the wind an intervening cause? A superseding cause?"

**Framework Comparison Questions:**
1. "Under traditional proximate cause analysis, what's the test?"
2. "Under Restatement Third 'scope of liability,' what's the test?"
3. "Do these lead to different outcomes in Berry?"
4. "Why does KA try to merge the vocabularies? Why does Huang want to keep them distinct?"

**Application to Jones v. Roth:**
1. "What risk did the defendant create?"
2. "What harm occurred?"
3. "Is the harm within that risk?"
4. "How would traditional analysis handle this?"

**Intervening Cause Questions:**
1. "What makes something a 'superseding' intervening cause?"
2. "Are intentional acts by third persons always superseding?"
3. "Are criminal acts by third persons always superseding?"
4. "What about rescuers who get injured helping the plaintiff?"

**The Sabatino Recall:**
1. "In Sabatino, would the designated driver have been liable to passengers?"
2. "Was the injury to passengers 'within the risk' created by DD's negligence?"
3. "What about the driver who caused the accident - any intervening cause analysis?"

## RESTATEMENT PROVISIONS

### Restatement Third § 29 - Scope of Liability

**Text:**
> "An actor is liable for harm when the risk of that harm is within the scope of the risk created by the actor's tortious conduct."

**Comment d - Acts, Events, and Omissions Intervening:**
- Defendant liable for harms resulting from force/situation created
- Even if harm occurs through:
  - Innocent acts of others
  - Negligent acts of others
  - Reckless acts of others
  - Extraordinary natural events
  - Animal behavior

**Key Insight:**
- The MODERN approach largely ELIMINATES the "intervening cause" inquiry
- Instead asks: Was the harm type within the risk created?
- Most "intervening causes" don't matter under this analysis

**Comment f - Relationship with Duty Limitations:**
- Discusses overlap between "scope of liability" and "duty"
- Notes that sometimes "duty" is used confusingly (like Cardozo in Palsgraf)
- Restatement Third prefers clear "scope of liability" language

## TRADITIONAL VS. NEW APPROACH

### Key Differences

| Aspect | Traditional (Proximate Cause) | Modern (Scope of Liability) |
|--------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Core Question** | Was harm proximate? | Is harm within the risk? |
| **Intervening Causes** | Central concept | Largely irrelevant |
| **Foreseeability** | Key requirement | Implicit in risk analysis |
| **Focus** | Chain of causation | Type of harm vs. type of risk |
| **Terminology** | Direct, proximate, intervening | Scope, risk, harm type |

### When They Reach Same Result:
- Most ordinary negligence cases
- Clear causal chains
- No unusual intervening events

### When They Might Differ:
- Complex causal chains
- Multiple intervening actors
- Unusual but related harms
- Third-party criminal acts

---

## POLICY/THEORY

**Why limit liability?**

1. **Fairness** - Infinite liability is infinitely unfair
2. **Predictability** - Actors need to know potential consequences
3. **Incentive alignment** - Liability should attach where it can change behavior
4. **Administrative** - Courts can't handle infinite causation chains

**Why "scope of liability" approach?**

1. **Conceptual clarity** - Avoids confusing "proximate" language
2. **Focus on risk creation** - Aligns with negligence as risk-creation
3. **Reduces gamesmanship** - Less fighting over "intervening" classifications
4. **Better matches moral intuitions** - Liability follows risk creation

**Why traditional approach persists?**

1. **Historical precedent** - Centuries of case law
2. **Jury comprehension** - "Proximate cause" may be more intuitive
3. **Line-drawing** - Sometimes we DO want to cut off liability

---

## QUICK HYPOS

### Hypo 1: The Fire Case
- D negligently starts small fire in building
- Firefighter P is injured while fighting fire
- Is D liable to P?

**Analysis:**
- Traditional: Rescue doctrine - foreseeable that firefighters will respond
- Modern: Injury to rescuers is "within the risk" of creating a fire
- Result: Liable

### Hypo 2: The Fleeing Criminal
- D negligently leaves car unlocked with keys inside
- Thief steals car and flees police
- Thief crashes into pedestrian P
- Is D liable to P?

**Analysis:**
- Traditional: Theft may be superseding intentional act
- Modern: Car theft creates risk of reckless driving
- Courts split on this!

### Hypo 3: The Medical Malpractice After Accident
- D negligently injures P in car accident
- P goes to hospital
- Doctor commits malpractice, making injury worse
- Is D liable for the worsened injury?

**Analysis:**
- Traditional: Medical malpractice usually NOT superseding
- Modern: Medical complications are "within the risk" of creating injury
- Result: D liable for original + worsened injury

### Hypo 4: The Unforeseeable Plaintiff
- D negligently drives truck into store
- Injures customer P inside
- Also injures pedestrian Q on sidewalk who sees crash and has heart attack
- Who can recover?

**Analysis:**
- P: Clearly foreseeable, within risk
- Q: Heart attack from seeing crash? May be outside risk
- Traditional: "Unforeseeable plaintiff" doctrine (Palsgraf!)

### Hypo 5: The Building Collapse
- D negligently constructs building
- Years later, earthquake (rare for area) causes collapse
- Injures tenant P
- Is D liable?

**Analysis:**
- Traditional: Earthquake may be superseding act of God
- Modern: Was collapse risk within risk of negligent construction?
- Likely yes if construction was very poor

## EXAM SIGNALS

**When you see these facts, think proximate cause/scope of liability:**

1. **Long causal chains** - D does X, then Y happens, then Z happens, then P is injured
2. **Third-party acts** - Criminal, intentional, or negligent acts by others
3. **Unusual harms** - Not the "typical" injury from defendant's conduct
4. **Time/space distance** - Harm far removed in time or place from defendant's act
5. "But for anyone..." arguments
6. "Superseding cause" allegations
7. "Unforeseeable" claims
8. "Acts of God"

**Issue-spotting checklist:**
- [ ] Is there but-for causation? (If no, stop here)
- [ ] Is there a good argument that chain should be cut off?
- [ ] What RISK did defendant's conduct create?
- [ ] What HARM actually occurred?
- [ ] Is the harm "within the risk"?
- [ ] Are there any intervening acts?
- [ ] If so, are they superseding under traditional approach?
- [ ] How would modern approach handle it?

## NOTES FOR CLASS DISCUSSION

1. **Keep frameworks DISTINCT** - Don't merge "proximate cause" and "scope of liability" terminology
2. **Practice both approaches** - Be ready to analyze same facts under each
3. **Berry is the anchor** - Use this case to test your intuitions
4. **Jones v. Roth** is for practice - work through it before class
5. **Recall Sabatino** - The designated driver case will come up
