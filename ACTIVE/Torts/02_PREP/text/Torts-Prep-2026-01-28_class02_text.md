## 1. CORE QUESTION FOR TODAY

**"How careful is careful enough?"**

From Adams v. Bullock (Class 1), we know negligence requires unreasonable risk-taking. But what counts as "reasonable"? Today explores the standard itself:
- What's the baseline? (Reasonable person standard)
- Does it vary for different people? (Children, people with disabilities)
- What if plaintiff was also careless? (Contributory vs. comparative negligence)

**Key tension:** Objective standard (everyone held to same bar) vs. Subjective capacity (accommodating differences).

---

## 2. THE REASONABLE PERSON STANDARD (KA 68-73)

### Rule Statement

**"Negligence is conduct that falls below the standard of care expected of a reasonably prudent person under similar circumstances."**

- **Objective standard:** Not based on defendant's actual capacity/judgment
- Measured against **hypothetical reasonable person** (not actual defendant)
- Focuses on **external conduct**, not internal mental state

### Key Principles

**1. Objective, not subjective**
- Defendant can't argue "I'm less intelligent/careful than average"
- *Vaughan v. Menlove* (the haystack case): Defendant's claimed lack of "highest order of intelligence" = irrelevant
- Why objective? (a) Incentive effects—encourages people to meet minimum standard; (b) Victims shouldn't bear cost of injurer's inadequacies; (c) Verification problem—hard to measure subjective capacity

**2. But still contextual**
- "Under similar circumstances" = takes into account:
  - Time available to react
  - Emergency situations
  - What defendant knew or should have known
  - Social utility of defendant's conduct vs. risk created

**3. Foreseeability matters**
- Can't be negligent for failing to guard against **unforeseeable** risks
- *Blyth v. Birmingham Waterworks*: Record freeze—risk "so improbable reasonable person need not anticipate it"
- Today: Most weather-related risks ARE foreseeable (100-year floods happen)

---

## 3. EXCEPTIONS: CHILDREN & THE INFIRM (KA 73-76)

### Children

**Rule: Semi-objective standard**
- **Under age 5:** Cannot be negligent at all
- **Above age 5:** Held to standard of child of **similar age, intelligence, experience**
- **Exception—"Adult activities":** When child engages in dangerous adult activities (driving, flying plane, motor boat), held to **adult standard**

**Why the exception for adult activities?**
1. Victims can't tell driver is a child—can't exercise extra self-protective care
2. No social benefit to immunizing children for adult activities
3. Post-WWII: Liability insurance makes children more likely judgment-proof satisfied (parents' homeowner/auto policies)

**Cold-call hypo:** 12-year-old drives car, causes accident. Adult standard applies (dangerous adult activity).

### Infirm Adults

**Physical infirmities:** Semi-objective standard
- *Blind person can't read "No Smoking" sign*
- Jury **may/must** consider the disability
- But cuts both ways: Blind person shouldn't drive; wheelchair user should be extra cautious jaywalking

**Mental infirmities:** Objective standard (even insane people liable)
- **Why different from physical?**
  - Mental conditions harder to verify/measure (invisible)
  - During lucid periods, may be negligent not to prevent harm while delusional
  - *Breunig v. American Family Ins. Co.*: Woman thought she could fly "because Batman does it"—liable because she had prior episodes (should have taken precautions during lucidity)

**Modern trend:** Evolving attitudes—disability accommodations mean juries might be more lenient

---

## 4. CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE (KA 173-175)

**Old rule (pre-1970s in most states):**
**Contributory negligence = COMPLETE BAR to recovery**

**Definition:** Plaintiff's failure to exercise reasonable care for own safety

**Elements (analogous to negligence):**
1. Plaintiff breached duty of self-care
2. Breach was cause-in-fact of plaintiff's injuries
3. Breach was proximate cause of injuries

**Key case:** *Butterfield v. Forrester* (19th century)—court thought "self-evident" that negligent plaintiff can't recover from negligent defendant

**Problem:** Unfair—even slightly negligent plaintiff gets NOTHING, even if defendant much more at fault

**Modern status:** Only 4 states + DC still use pure contributory negligence (Alabama, Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia)

---

## 5. COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE (KA 180-182)

**Modern rule (adopted since 1970s):**
**Plaintiff's negligence REDUCES recovery proportionally, doesn't bar it**

### Two Forms

**1. Pure Comparative Negligence (13 states)**
- Plaintiff always recovers something (unless 100% at fault)
- Example: Plaintiff 40% at fault, damages $100k → recovers $60k
- Even if plaintiff 90% at fault → recovers 10%

**2. Modified Comparative Negligence (33 states)**
- Plaintiff barred from recovery if **more negligent** than defendant
- Two versions:
  - **"Not greater than":** Plaintiff recovers even at 50/50 split
  - **"Not as great as":** Plaintiff barred at 50/50 split
- Example: Plaintiff 51% at fault → gets NOTHING
- Makes jury attributions critical—1% difference huge

### How It Works

1. Jury assumes total negligence = 100%
2. Jury divides percentage between parties (e.g., 40% plaintiff, 60% defendant)
3. Plaintiff's recovery reduced by their percentage
4. Under modified, check if plaintiff exceeded threshold

**What's being compared?**
- **Negligence**, not causation
- Takes into account **probability** of causing harm (part of what makes conduct negligent)
- But NOT the actual causal contribution in this specific case

**Practical problem:** How to compare "apples and oranges"?
- Speeding vs. failure to stop at stop sign
- Driving fast vs. failing to trim tree that obscured sign
- No clear answer—jury's job

## 6. CASES TO KNOW (FACTS ONLY FOR NOW)

**Goss v. Allen**
- Facts: 17-year-old Steven Allen, a beginner skier, visited Mad River Glen ski resort in Vermont for the first time. He was sent to the beginner's slope. Instead of using the T-bar lift, he walked about a quarter of the way up the hill, then attempted to ski down a short 30-foot run. He successfully made it down but lost control when he tried to make an abrupt left turn at the bottom of the hill. He collided with Jaqueline Goss, an experienced skier and first aid advisor, who was standing in a flat area beyond the slope. The accident occurred in Vermont, but suit was brought in New Jersey (defendant's residence). Vermont law applied, but counsel agreed it was the same as New Jersey law.
- Issue: Application of reasonable person standard to children/infirm
- Professor said: "Focus on facts; notice the confused reasoning"

**Core v. N.C. Parks & Recreation**
- Facts: James D. Core, a college student, went camping at Lake Waccamaw State Park with his fraternity on the weekend of October 3-4, 2014. The North Carolina Division of Parks and Recreation owned and maintained the park, including the shoreline. Core was injured while shallow water diving in the lake. He claimed the park was negligent, but the North Carolina Industrial Commission denied his negligence claim, finding that his contributory negligence barred recovery.
- Like Adams v. Bullock Class 1—practice making arguments with what we know so far

## 7. RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS § 3

**§ 3. Negligence**

> "A person acts negligently if the person does not exercise reasonable care under all the circumstances. Primary factors to consider in ascertaining whether the person's conduct lacks reasonable care are the foreseeable likelihood that the person's conduct will result in harm, the foreseeable severity of any harm that may ensue, and the burden of precautions to eliminate or reduce the risk of harm."

**Key points:**
- Codifies the **negligence calculus** (more on Wednesday)
- "All circumstances" = contextual
- Factors: (1) Likelihood of harm (P); (2) Severity of harm (L); (3) Burden of precautions (B)
- If B < PL, then negligent

---

## 8. ILLINOIS JURY INSTRUCTIONS

### On Negligence (IPI 10.01)

> "When I use the expression 'negligence,' I mean the failure to do something which a reasonably careful person would do or the doing of something which a reasonably careful person would not do under circumstances similar to those shown by the evidence. The law does not say how a reasonably careful person would act under those circumstances. That is for you to decide."

**Takeaway:** Leaves it to jury—no rigid rule

### On Comparative Negligence (IPI 30.04)

> "If you decide that [plaintiff] and [defendant] are both negligent, you must then determine the percentage of the total negligence of all persons that is attributable to each of them. The percentages you find must total 100%."

### On Ordinary Care by Minors (IPI 10.03)

> "When I use the expression 'ordinary care' [for a minor], I mean the degree of care which a reasonably careful [child/person] of the same age, mental capacity, and experience as [minor's name] would use under circumstances similar to those shown by the evidence."

**Takeaway:** Age, mental capacity, experience all relevant for children

## 9. POLICY HOOK

**If professor asks "What's the policy tension here?":**

**Objective vs. Subjective standard:**
- Objective = promotes safety, clear line, avoids verification problems
- But may be unfair to those with lower capacity (though insurance/loss-spreading may mitigate)

**Contributory vs. Comparative:**
- Contributory = bright line, easy to apply, but harsh (all-or-nothing)
- Comparative = fairer, more nuanced, but creates line-drawing problems (especially modified at 50/50)

**Children exception:**
- Recognizes developmental limits, avoids unfairness
- But adult activity exception shows limits—when victims can't protect themselves, objective standard returns

---

## 10. COLD-CALL PREP

**If called on about reasonable person standard:**
- "It's an objective standard—defendant held to what reasonably prudent person would do, not their actual capacity"
- Example: Can't argue "I'm bad at judging risks" (Vaughan v. Menlove)

**If called on children:**
- "Generally semi-objective—child of similar age/intelligence/experience"
- "But adult activities = adult standard" (can't tell driver is a child; no social benefit)

**If called on contributory vs. comparative:**
- "Contributory was complete bar—even slightly negligent plaintiff got nothing"
- "Comparative reduces recovery proportionally—pure (13 states) always allows some recovery; modified (33 states) bars if plaintiff more negligent"

**If professor pushes: "What about someone who's just bad at driving?"**
- "Objective standard still applies—if you can't meet reasonable person standard, shouldn't be doing the activity"
- "Like blind person shouldn't drive—disability considered, but cuts both ways"

**If professor asks about Goss v. Allen facts:**
- [Need to read case—course packet]

## 11. CONNECTIONS

**From last class (Adams v. Bullock):**
- Adams gave us negligence framework: duty, breach, causation, damages
- Today zooms in on **breach**—what's the standard?

**To Wednesday:**
- Wednesday asks: Should standard be rule or flexible standard? Who decides—judge or jury?
- Also: Can we import external standards (custom, statutes) to give more structure?

---

## 12. QUICK HYPOS

**Hypo 1:** Driver has epilepsy, hasn't had seizure in 5 years, doctor said "probably safe to drive." Has unexpected seizure, kills pedestrian. Negligent?
- Narrow frame: Seizure = involuntary → no actus reus
- Broad frame: Driving with any seizure risk = voluntary → negligent
- **This is the hard case** where time-framing matters (unlike *Decina* where driver KNEW he had frequent seizures)

**Hypo 2:** 8-year-old on skateboard hits pedestrian. What standard?
- Child standard—skateboarding is kids' activity
- Held to standard of reasonably careful 8-year-old skateboarder

**Hypo 3:** 15-year-old drives car, crashes. What standard?
- Adult standard—driving is adult activity
- Even though only 15

**Hypo 4:** Plaintiff 40% negligent, defendant 60%. Damages = $100k.
- Pure comparative: Plaintiff recovers $60k
- Modified (not greater): Plaintiff recovers $60k
- Modified (not as great): Plaintiff recovers $60k
- All same result because plaintiff < 50%

**Hypo 5:** Plaintiff 51% negligent, defendant 49%. Damages = $100k.
- Pure comparative: Plaintiff recovers $49k
- Modified (either version): Plaintiff recovers NOTHING (barred)

## 14. EXAM SIGNALS

**From past Huang exams** [SOURCE NEEDED—will add after reviewing INDEX]:
- Issue-spotting: Identify whether defendant's conduct meets reasonable person standard
- Children: Likely to test adult activity exception
- Comparative negligence: Fact patterns with multiple negligent parties—allocate percentages
- Policy: Sometimes one essay question requires discussion of fairness vs. efficiency

---

## 15. PROFESSOR'S SPECIAL PROMPTS

From Professor Huang's email:
1. **"How careful is careful enough?"** → Core question for reasonable person standard
2. **"What about kids? People with lesser/greater abilities? Depend on activity?"** → Children/infirm exceptions
3. Use **Goss v. Allen** as fact pattern to sort out doctrinal concerns
4. Use **Parks & Recreation** as fact pattern for **practice making arguments** (like we did with Adams)

**Key:** Professor wants us to **practice argumentation**, not just recite doctrine. Be ready to argue both sides.
