# Text Prep — Class #5 — “Affirmative Duties” (Rescue / Warn / Undertakings) + Duty to Warn (Products)

**Friday, February 6, 2026 | Panel: Bluebird (I’m ON CALL)**

---

## CORE QUESTIONS (WHAT HUANG IS AIMING AT)

1. **Why is the default rule “no duty to rescue / no duty to help”?** (even when rescue is cheap and harm is huge)
2. **How do courts police the line between “causing harm” and “failing to help”?** (*misfeasance* vs. *nonfeasance*)
3. **When do “affirmative duties” arise anyway?**
   - **Special relationship** (dependence/custody/control)
   - **Undertaking** (you started helping / promised to help / induced reliance)
   - **Statute** (does it merely set a standard of care, or also create a duty actionable in tort?)
4. **How do courts cap liability once they open the door?** (indeterminate plaintiff class, causation problems, autonomy, “label clutter”)

---

## 1) DOCTRINE MAP (ONE PAGE YOU CAN TALK FROM)

### A. Baseline: negligence is “don’t create unreasonable risks”

- Normal negligence is mostly about **misfeasance**: you **did something** that created or increased risk.
- “Affirmative duty” problems are mostly **nonfeasance**: you **didn’t do something** that might have reduced a risk you didn’t create.

### B. The key rhetorical fork: “instrument of harm” vs “instrument for good”

This is the Cardozo move in *Moch*:

- **Misfeasance:** defendant has **launched a force or instrument of harm** → duty is easier to recognize.
- **Nonfeasance:** defendant is at most **refusing to become an instrument for good** → default “no duty.”

### C. Exception hooks (how plaintiffs try to turn nonfeasance into duty)

1. **Special relationship (KA 265-66)**
   - Idea: if P is dependent on D (custody/control/entrustment), D has **waived the “mind my own business” baseline** and can owe duties to protect/warn.
   - Tarasoff is the iconic “special relationship with dangerous person → duty to warn/protect identifiable victims.”

2. **Undertaking / voluntary assumption of responsibility (KA 261-65; 266-68)**
   - **Once you undertake to help, you must do it with reasonable care.**
   - Liability theories usually turn on: **(a) increased risk**, **(b) assumed someone else’s duty**, or **(c) reliance** (by the person helped or by third parties).
   - Huang loves: “What counts as an undertaking? How big? To whom?”

3. **Statute**
   - Key warning from *Cuyler*: **a statutory violation doesn’t automatically create a tort duty.**
   - Even with “negligence per se,” you still need a **duty** (common law or statutorily created) to get tort liability.

## 2) MOCH v. RENSSELAER WATER CO. (CARDOZO): WHY “NO DUTY” CAN WIN EVEN WHEN HARM IS FORESEEABLE

### Minimal facts (enough for cold call)

- Water company contracts with city to supply water (including hydrants).
- Fire starts; allegedly insufficient water pressure/flow to fight it.
- Plaintiff’s property burns; plaintiff sues water company for failing to supply enough water.

### The doctrinal move

Frame plaintiff’s theory and then slot it:

- Plaintiff: “You had notice and capacity; you **failed to help**, and that failure caused loss.”
- Court: this is **nonfeasance**, not “launching a force of harm.”

### Why Cardozo is doing this (policy + limits)

- **Line-drawing:** we can’t treat every “failure to confer a benefit” as tortious.
- **Floodgates / indeterminate liability:** if water supplier owes tort duties broadly for service failures, the plaintiff class can explode.
- **Institutional choice:** contract/regulation might be a better tool than tort for utility-performance disputes.

### Cold-call answer structure

1. What is the **untaken act** (the “rescue”/benefit) P demands?
2. Did D **create** the risk? If not, why should D bear the loss anyway?
3. If we impose liability here, **who else** is now owed a duty (and how big)?

## 3) CUYLER v. UNITED STATES (POSNER): STATUTE + NONFEASANCE + THIRD-PARTY VICTIM

### Minimal facts

- Hospital staff allegedly suspect/observe child abuse (re: another child) but **do not report**, despite a mandatory reporting statute.
- Abuser later harms/kills a different child; that family sues.

### The Posner move (the “flowerpot” intuition)

- If you **don’t warn** someone about danger you didn’t create (flowerpot falling), common law usually says **no duty**.
- If you **created** the danger (you threw the pot), duty is easy.
- So the question becomes: did the statute **create** a tort duty to this later victim, or only create a reporting obligation enforceable some other way?

### What to say if asked “why not negligence per se?”

Negligence per se helps with **breach/standard of care** *once you already have a duty*. It doesn’t magically supply duty.

### Two extra exam angles Huang may press

- **Causation is harder in nonfeasance:** What would have happened if the report was made (would child services have intervened, would the later harm have been prevented)?
- **Tarasoff contrast:** In Tarasoff, the therapist’s relationship with the dangerous person + identifiable victim story makes duty feel more “bounded.” In *Cuyler*, the chain to later third parties looks broader and more speculative.

## 4) WHITE v. SABATINO (DESIGNATED DRIVER ISSUE): WHEN DOES A “PROMISE TO HELP” BECOME A DUTY?

Professor’s framing: *Can there be liability for someone who offers to be a designated driver?*

### The key move: “undertaking” as the duty hook

If D undertakes to provide a designated-driver service for an intoxicated person, the argument is that D should recognize the undertaking is **for the protection of third parties** (other drivers/pedestrians).

To argue it cleanly, always ask:

1. **Was there an undertaking at all?** (words/actions)
2. **Who relied?** (the intoxicated person? the alcohol provider? the victim/others?)
3. **Did D’s failure increase risk or displace other protections?** (e.g., others stop intervening because “D has it handled”)

### Quick arguments (run it both ways)

- **Plaintiff-side:** This is exactly why “undertaking” exists—once you step in and others rely, you can’t walk away carelessly; it’s a narrow, reliance-based duty, not a general good-Samaritan rule.
- **Defense-side:** This invites expansive liability for casual social speech (“I’ll get you home”), makes people less likely to offer help, and causation is still hard (the drunk’s choice to drive is a major intervening actor).

## 5) HOOD v. RYOBI: DUTY TO WARN AND “LABEL CLUTTER”

### Minimal facts

- Product (saw) had multiple warnings not to operate without safety guards.
- Plaintiff removed guards anyway; injury occurs; plaintiff claims warning should have been more specific about the exact consequence.

### The idea to have ready

**A warning must be reasonable under the circumstances, not encyclopedic.**

Why courts resist “warn about every bad outcome”:

- More detail can reduce effectiveness (people tune out) → **label clutter**.
- Adequacy analysis implicitly weighs: marginal safety gain from added detail vs. costs (including reduced salience).
- Separate but related: plaintiff still has to show **heeding/causation** (would the extra words have changed behavior?).

## 6) 60-SECOND “IF I GET CALLED” SCRIPT

“Today is about when tort law imposes affirmative duties. Default is no duty to rescue—courts distinguish misfeasance from nonfeasance. *Moch* is Cardozo drawing the line: the water company didn’t launch a force of harm; at most it failed to confer a benefit, and imposing duty would create unbounded liability. *Cuyler* shows the same baseline plus a statute: even if there’s a reporting obligation, you still need a tort duty—negligence per se doesn’t create duty by itself—and causation is hard in nonfeasance. Then *White v. Sabatino* explores a narrow way to create duty anyway: an undertaking, like promising to be a designated driver, especially if it induces reliance and is for the protection of third parties. Finally *Hood v. Ryobi* is duty to warn in products: warnings must be reasonable, and courts worry that forcing manufacturers to list every consequence creates label clutter and undermines safety.”
