# Text Prep — Class #4 — The Negligence Calculus (B < P×L)

**Wednesday, February 4, 2026 | Panel: Goldfinch (I'm ON CALL)**

---

## CORE QUESTIONS (WHAT HUANG IS AIMING AT)

1. **How is the Learned Hand Formula supposed to work, if we take it seriously?**
2. **Where does foreseeability fit?** (Is it inside `P`? A threshold screen before `BPL`? Both?)
3. **Which “aim(s) of tort law” does BPL serve best?** (Deterrence / corrective justice / civil recourse / loss spreading)
4. **What are the major critiques of using BPL as a negligence test?** (Information + error costs; incommensurability; jury/policy discomfort)

---

## 1) THE LEARNED HAND FORMULA (KA 78-85): WHAT IT IS

**Basic idea:** A party is negligent if it **fails to take a precaution** whose **burden** is less than the **expected accident loss** that the precaution would avert.

**Hand Formula (shorthand):** `B < P × L` → breach (unreasonable conduct)

- `B` = **Burden** (cost/inconvenience) of the precaution
- `P` = **Probability** of harm (foreseeable likelihood, given the actor’s conduct/omission)
- `L` = **Loss** (foreseeable severity of harm)

**How to use it in class:** It’s usually an “**untaken precaution**” argument dressed in a structured way.

---

## 2) WHERE FORESEEABILITY FITS (DON’T LOSE THIS THREAD)

Two clean ways to talk about it:

1. **Foreseeability as a screen:** We only count risks that are **known or knowable** ex ante; wildly freakish “anything is possible” chains are out.
2. **Foreseeability inside `P` and `L`:** Even when a type of harm is foreseeable, its likelihood can be tiny (`P`), and that fact drives the result.

**Useful sentence:** “Foreseeability tells you what risks belong in the BPL ledger; `P` and `L` tell you how heavy those risks are.”

---

## 3) HOW TO RUN A BPL ARGUMENT (COLD-CALL TEMPLATE)

1. **Name the harm:** “Barge breaks loose → collision → sinking → cargo loss.”
2. **Identify the untaken precaution:** “Keep a bargee aboard during [X] hours / when shifts are happening.”
3. **Argue `B`:** What does the precaution cost (money/time/operational burden), and to whom?
4. **Argue `P`:** How likely was this harm (given the context), and what evidence supports that estimate?
5. **Argue `L`:** How bad is the foreseeable harm (property loss, bodily injury, systemic risk)?
6. **Compare:** Even if you can’t quantify, make a **directional** claim: “Low `B`, meaningful `P`, high `L`.”
7. **Sanity check:** Does this result make tort law look like an insurer? Or does it induce cost-justified precautions?

---

## 4) U.S. v. CARROLL TOWING (2d Cir. 1947): THE POINT OF THE CASE

**What you must have ready:** a crisp facts/actors map + the “untaken precaution” + why `B` is low / `P×L` is high (or vice versa).

### Minimal facts (sufficient for cold call)

- A barge (**Anna C**) broke loose during harbor operations, collided, and sank (cargo loss).
- A key issue becomes whether it was unreasonable that the **bargee was absent** at the relevant time.
- Judge Learned Hand uses a cost-benefit style analysis: if the burden of having a bargee present is less than the expected accident loss, absence can be negligence.

### Doctrinal takeaway

**Rule framing:** Duty/breach can be assessed by comparing **burden of precautions** against **probability and magnitude of harm**.

**Practical takeaway:** When courts talk “formula,” they often mean: *What was the concrete precaution, and was it worth it?*

---

## 5) ARGUMENT BANK (RUN IT BOTH WAYS)

### Plaintiff-side (absence = negligent)

- **Low `B`:** Having someone aboard during active shifting/working hours is modest burden.
- **Nontrivial `P`:** In a busy harbor, breakaways/collisions are a known risk (shifting barges, lines, currents, traffic).
- **High `L`:** Sinking/cargo loss is huge (and potentially life-threatening in other settings).
- **Administrability:** “Be aboard during working hours” is a workable rule-of-thumb derived from BPL.

### Defense-side (absence = not negligent / `B` not really low)

- **`B` is not free:** Staffing/keeping someone aboard has real costs (labor, scheduling, safety, opportunity cost).
- **`P` is low on these facts:** If the event required multiple unusual mistakes, the likelihood may be low.
- **Causal skepticism:** Even if someone had been aboard, would they realistically have prevented the loss?
- **Institutional critique:** Courts will not (and should not) try to do “math” with fake numbers; juries will decide based on vibe anyway.

### Facts to demand (good Huang-style move)

- How long was the bargee absent, and at what time (working hours vs. not)?
- What exactly was happening in the harbor (tug shifting? weather? traffic? currents)?
- How often do barges break loose in comparable conditions (evidence for `P`)?
- What could the bargee actually have done in time (causation + effectiveness of precaution)?
- Any feasible alternative precautions (better lines, inspections, procedures) and their burdens?

## 6) GILLES (CARROLL TOWING ARTICLE): MAIN CRITIQUES TO HAVE ON DECK

Use these as “attacks” on BPL *as a decision rule* (not necessarily as a heuristic):

1. **Information + error costs:** Getting reliable `B`, `P`, and `L` is expensive; courts approximate and can get it wrong, creating systematic errors.
2. **Incommensurability:** Some harms and burdens don’t compare cleanly (e.g., bodily injury vs. cheap safety devices) without controversial valuation assumptions.
3. **Hidden assumptions:** BPL can smuggle in policy choices about whose costs count and how to value life/limb (distributional and moral questions).

**Counter-move if Huang pushes:** “Even if BPL is imperfect, it’s still a disciplined way to argue about precautions and tradeoffs, especially when the alternative is intuition with no structure.”

---

## 7) 60-SECOND COLD-CALL SCRIPT

“Carroll Towing is the Learned Hand negligence calculus case. A barge broke loose during harbor operations, caused serious loss, and the question is whether it was negligent that the bargee wasn’t aboard. Hand frames breach as `B < P×L`: if the burden of the precaution—keeping someone aboard at the relevant time—is less than the expected accident loss, then failing to take it is unreasonable. Foreseeability matters because it tells you what risks belong in the `P` and `L` analysis, and we can argue both ways depending on how big `B` is and how likely/effective the precaution is. Then we assess critiques: information costs, incommensurability, and policy discomfort with ‘pricing’ accidents.”
