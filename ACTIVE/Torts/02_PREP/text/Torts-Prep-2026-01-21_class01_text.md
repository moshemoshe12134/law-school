# Torts — Class 1 (Wed 1/21): “Walk-In Blind” Prep

## Quick Navigation

- What to do before class
- What Huang is trying to train you to do
- KA: the “aims/functions” (summary you can speak from)
- Adams v. Bullock: facts, holding, and the full argument tree (both sides)
- Cold-call scripts (30 seconds / 2 minutes / 5 minutes)
- Likely Huang questions + prepared answers
- Five fast hypos (with analysis)

## Before Class (Do This)

- Seating chart sign-up opens **Thu 1/15 at 8:00 AM**
- Buy **Course Packet 1** (bookstore)
- Buy **Kenneth S. Abraham, _The Forms and Functions of Tort Law_ (6th ed. 2022)** — **paperback** (not e-book)
- Record pronunciation of your **full name** on **Lawnet** (not Courseworks)
- Plan for **no laptops/tablets/devices** in class (unless an approved accommodation)

## What Huang Is Going To Do In This Course (So You Don’t Misread The Room)

From the syllabus:

- This is not lecture. It’s interactive argument: you will practice making arguments and counterarguments about who should pay and why.
- You’ll be “on call” about once per week (panel system; randomized calling). If you’re not up for it on a given day, email at least 1 hour before class.
- Grade is exam-based; engagement can matter at the margins; repeated lateness/unexcused absences can hurt.

This matters because, on day 1, the “right” move is not to recite doctrine. The right move is to show:

- you have the facts;
- you can generate multiple plausible allocations of responsibility;
- you can justify each allocation with a recognizable theory of what tort law is for.

## Readings For Class 1 (And What They’re For)

1. Abraham (“KA”) **Introduction, pp. 1–5**
2. Abraham (“KA”) **Nature of Tort Law, pp. 16–24**
3. **Adams v. Bullock** (Course Packet; backup: `ACTIVE/Torts/01_SOURCES/core/cases/adams_v_bullock.docx`)

Professor’s instruction (from the email assignment note):

- Use **Adams** mainly as a fact pattern.
- Focus on: “Who should pay, and why?” and “Whose fault is it, and why?”
- First: make arguments in normal-person language.
- Then: reframe those same arguments using the “aims of tort law” from KA pp. 16–24.

## KA: “Nature and Functions of Tort Law” (Speakable Summary)

You are not being tested on memorizing a list. You are being tested on using *a function/aim* as an engine for argument.

What KA is doing (high-level):

- Tort law is largely common-law; it developed case-by-case without a single “mission statement.”
- So scholars and judges disagree about what tort law *is for*; different cases implicitly pick different answers.
- A clean way to organize those answers is to separate:
  - **rights-based** views (tort as a response to a wrong between two parties), and
  - **instrumental** views (tort as a tool to shape behavior and distribute costs in society),
  - plus **mixed** views (it does more than one thing).

Below is a “use-in-class” menu of functions/aims that commonly appear in KA’s discussion of tort theory (paraphrased). When you have your KA book open, map your professor’s preferred labels to these concepts.

### 1) Corrective Justice (rights-based)

- Core idea: when A wrongs B, A owes B a kind of correction/repair.
- In bodily injury cases you can’t truly “undo” harm, so the system substitutes money.
- Why it’s attractive: it feels like moral accounting; it links liability to wrongdoing.
- Pressure points / objections (useful in debate):
  - In real life, insurers and organizations pay; it’s not literally “A pays B.”
  - Many harms happen without a clear moral “wrong”; the fit can be awkward.

### 2) Civil Recourse (rights-based)

- Core idea: tort law empowers the victim to demand redress; it’s about the victim’s right to call the wrongdoer to account in court.
- Why it’s attractive: explains why tort is a lawsuit system (party-driven, adversarial), not a universal compensation program.
- Pressure points: if the real goal is recourse, why do we care about efficiency/deterrence at all?

### 3) Deterrence / Optimal Deterrence (instrumental)

- Core idea: liability creates incentives to take cost-justified precautions; reduce avoidable accidents.
- “Optimal” means: you don’t try to prevent every injury; you prevent injuries when prevention is worth it.
- Pressure points:
  - Deterrence depends on actors perceiving/controlling risk; not all accidents are controllable.
  - It can sound like you’re pricing human life; that moral discomfort is itself a debate point.

### 4) Loss Distribution (instrumental)

- Core idea: spreading the cost of accidents through insurance/prices can be socially preferable to one victim bearing the full loss.
- Often points toward imposing liability on parties who can spread losses cheaply (institutions, businesses).
- Pressure points:
  - If “spreading loss” is always good, liability has no stopping point.
  - Lawsuits are an expensive way to spread loss compared to insurance/social programs.

### 5) Compensation (instrumental, but limited)

- Core idea: the system delivers money to injured plaintiffs when they win.
- Important nuance: “we want injured people paid” rarely explains the line between who wins and who loses; tort is not a general victim-compensation scheme.

Use these as *argument tags* in class:

- “If tort is about corrective justice, then…”
- “If tort is about deterrence, then…”
- “If tort is about loss distribution, then…”

## Adams v. Bullock — Everything You Need For Day 1

### Fast, Accurate Case Brief

**Court / Judge:** NY Court of Appeals (Cardozo, J.)  
**Date:** Nov. 18, 1919  
**Citation:** 227 N.Y. 208 (125 N.E. 93)

**Posture:** Plaintiff won at trial; Appellate Division affirmed (divided); NY high court reverses and grants new trial.

**Holding (functional):** No liability on these facts; the defendant’s precautions were reasonable because the accident was outside ordinary foreseeability (“ordinary prevision”), and treating this as negligence would effectively make the defendant an insurer.

### The Facts You Must Be Able To Say Without Looking Down

- Defendant runs a trolley line with overhead wires.
- There is a bridge/culvert carrying railroad tracks above; pedestrians use it; children play on it.
- Plaintiff is a 12-year-old boy.
- He is swinging a wire about 8 feet long.
- The bridge has a parapet 18 inches wide.
- The trolley wire runs 4 feet 7 3/4 inches below the top of the parapet.
- His wire contacts the trolley wire; he is shocked and burned.

### What The Case Is Really About (Day 1 Version)

This is a “first principles” negligence/accident-allocation problem:

- Is the trolley company at fault for not foreseeing and preventing this?
- Or is this a freak accident that tort law should leave where it falls?

### The Best Plaintiff Argument (Liability)

You want to sound like this:

1. **Duty / baseline:** Electricity is dangerous; if you run a high-risk instrumentality in a public space, you have to take strong precautions.
2. **Foreseeability (key):** The bridge is a known pedestrian route and a known child-play area. Kids do kid things. “Kids + objects + swinging” is not fantasy.
3. **Low-cost precautions exist:** The defendant could have added targeted safeguards at this specific bridge (not everywhere):
   - barrier/guarding/shielding near the bridge line,
   - physical modifications to make contact harder at this spot,
   - warnings and/or making the bridge harder to use as a playground shortcut (depending on who controls it),
   - coordination with whoever controls the bridge structure.
4. **Why the jury should decide:** The jury already decided this was unreasonable. Torts often uses the reasonable person standard, and this is precisely the kind of reasonableness question that belongs to a factfinder.
5. **Policy frames you can attach:**
   - **Deterrence:** Put costs on the party best able to reduce the risk at lowest cost (the trolley company operating the wires).
   - **Loss distribution:** The trolley company can insure/spread costs; the child cannot.
   - **Compensation:** If someone must bear this loss, it is better that it not be a seriously injured child.

If Huang presses “but would this imply liability everywhere on the line?” you answer:

- No. Liability can be location-specific when the risk is location-specific (here: bridge used by pedestrians/children; a place where an object can more easily be dropped/lowered into the wire corridor).

### The Best Defendant Argument (No Liability) — Cardozo’s Core

You want to sound like this:

1. **Lawful activity:** Using overhead trolley wires is lawful; negligence is not “you used the overhead system.”
2. **Reasonable precautions already taken:** The wire is positioned so that someone standing on the bridge (even bending over the parapet) can’t reach it with their hands/body.
3. **Ordinary foreseeability vs. extraordinary mishap:** This accident requires a very particular chain: a long wire, swung just so, contacting an inaccessible wire below. That’s not “ordinary prevision.”
4. **No special warning signs (facts supporting):** No prior similar accidents; no custom disregarded; nothing about this bridge singled it out as uniquely hazardous compared to other points along the route.
5. **Feasibility / burden:** To guarantee prevention of all such contact incidents, you’d have to eliminate overhead wires entirely (underground). The record doesn’t show the defendant had the duty or power to do that.
6. **Administrability / stopping point:** If this is negligence, the trolley company becomes an insurer against every creative act of contact a child could engineer at any point along the line.
7. **Policy frames you can attach:**
   - **Optimal deterrence:** Don’t impose extreme costs to prevent extremely low-probability, hard-to-predict accidents.
   - **Corrective justice:** This does not look like a wrong committed by the trolley company; it looks like a tragic accident.
   - **Civil recourse boundaries:** Tort suits are not general social insurance; the system draws lines.

### The “Hardest” Questions (And How To Answer Them)

#### Q1: “Is this a duty case, a breach case, or something else?”

- In practice it’s a reasonableness/foreseeability question that functions like breach (did they take reasonable precautions?), but appellate language about foreseeability often sounds like duty because it’s used to decide whether the case should even go to the jury.
- Safe way to say it in class: “The court treats foreseeability/ordinary prevision as the constraint on what reasonable care requires here.”

#### Q2: “What fact does the most work?”

Pick one and defend it:

- **Height/distance facts** (wire below parapet): supports the idea the system was placed out of ordinary reach.
- **Kids play on bridge**: supports foreseeability on plaintiff’s side.
- **No prior accidents / no ignored custom**: supports defendant’s claim that this wasn’t a known hazard.

#### Q3: “What precaution would you actually require, specifically?”

Have one concrete “plaintiff-side” answer and one “defendant-side” answer:

- Plaintiff-side: “At this specific bridge, the operator should have added a localized protective measure (some physical barrier/guarding) if feasible at reasonable cost.”
- Defendant-side: “Any meaningful guard is either ineffective (kids find ways) or practically requires redesigning the system; requiring that is too much for a once-in-a-generation hazard.”

#### Q4: “So who *should* pay?”

You must be able to argue both ways with conviction. Here are prepared positions:

- **Trolley company should pay:** best risk-reducer + best loss-spreader + took on the enterprise; accident cost should be internalized.
- **Plaintiff/family should bear loss:** tragic but non-negligent; tort is not a general compensation system; otherwise defendants become insurers.
- **A third party should pay (if you want to be creative but defensible):**
  - If the bridge owner/municipality controls access and knew kids played there, maybe they are the better party to fix “kids playing on bridge” (but you’ll need a theory and a reason it’s not just “someone else with money”).

## Cold-Call Scripts (Memorize One)

### 30 seconds (survive the first question)

“A 12-year-old boy on a bridge swung an eight-foot wire that contacted an overhead trolley wire under the bridge and shocked him. The trolley wire was positioned several feet below the parapet so it wasn’t reachable by ordinary use of the bridge. The jury found for the plaintiff, but the NY Court of Appeals reversed, basically saying the accident was outside ordinary foreseeability and the defendant had taken reasonable precautions; otherwise the trolley company would be treated like an insurer.”

### 2 minutes (sound prepared)

Add:

- “Plaintiff says: kids play there; electricity is dangerous; the company should have taken targeted precautions at that bridge; the company can insure and spread losses.”
- “Defendant says: you can imagine a kid touching the wire anywhere with some object; there was no special reason to predict this bridge in particular; preventing all such contact would require extraordinary measures like putting wires underground; tort shouldn’t impose insurer-level liability.”

### 5 minutes (control the discussion)

Add:

- “This is a fight about how we set the stopping point for reasonable care: what risks are ‘ordinary’ enough that the enterprise must spend to prevent them.”
- “If we emphasize deterrence/loss-spreading, liability looks attractive; if we emphasize corrective justice/optimal deterrence/administrability, no-liability looks attractive.”

## Likely Huang Questions + Prepared Answers

### “Why does tort law draw lines instead of compensating every injury?”

Because tort is not designed as a universal compensation system. It typically requires a reason to shift loss from victim to defendant (wrongdoing, unreasonable risk, responsibility that tort recognizes). Otherwise liability becomes social insurance by lawsuit, which is expensive and has no limiting principle.

### “What’s the difference between ‘fault’ and ‘who should pay’?”

They can overlap but aren’t identical:

- “Fault” sounds like moral blame and unreasonable conduct.
- “Who should pay” can be answered instrumentally (who can prevent, who can spread loss, who benefits from the activity) even when no one is morally blameworthy.

### “Is Cardozo doing economics here?”

He is not writing in formal equations, but the structure is compatible with cost/benefit reasoning: reasonable care does not require expensive redesign for a highly unusual accident; otherwise the defendant becomes an insurer. That’s a form of “stopping point” reasoning.

### “Is the child at fault?”

On these facts the opinion does not present the case as “the child is at fault,” but you can argue:

- Plaintiff-side: child behavior is foreseeable; law often protects children; the enterprise should anticipate child behavior in public spaces.
- Defendant-side: the child’s conduct is exactly what makes the accident extraordinary and hard to predict; tort cannot demand perfect protection against every creative misuse.

### “What would change the result?”

Candidate changes (each pushes toward liability):

- Prior similar accidents or explicit warnings to the company.
- The trolley wire positioned closer/easier to contact from the bridge.
- Evidence of a cheap, standard safety measure widely used (custom) that defendant didn’t adopt.
- Defendant controls the bridge and could cheaply prevent access/playing.

## Five Quick Hypos (With Analysis You Can Say Out Loud)

Use these if Huang asks you to vary facts or push your stopping-point reasoning.

### Hypo 1: Prior accident at the same bridge

- If there was a similar prior incident, foreseeability strengthens; “ordinary prevision” shifts.
- Defendant’s “no special warning signs” argument collapses; a targeted fix now looks required.

### Hypo 2: Wire is only 1 foot below the parapet

- Much easier for ordinary bridge use to create contact.
- This becomes less “extraordinary casualty” and more “known risk created by placement.”

### Hypo 3: A cheap guard exists that doesn’t impair trolley function

- Plaintiff-side: once a feasible, low-burden precaution exists, failure to adopt looks unreasonable.
- Defendant-side: fight will move to whether the guard really works and whether it creates new risks/costs.

### Hypo 4: The bridge is a school route with heavy child traffic, known to defendant

- Increases foreseeability and the expectation of child-like behavior.
- Supports “special measures at special places” rather than “insure the whole line.”

### Hypo 5: Underground conversion is easy and already being done on nearby streets

- Weakens defendant’s feasibility argument.
- Makes “why didn’t you do the safer alternative?” more plausible as a negligence claim.
