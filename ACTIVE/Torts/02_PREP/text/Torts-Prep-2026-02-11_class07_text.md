## CONTINUITY FROM LAST CLASS

**From Class 6 (Monday):**
- Covered but-for causation test and when it fails
- Introduced loss of chance doctrine (Matsuyama)
- Covered multiple sufficient causes and substantial factor test

**Connecting to Today:**
Today we cover two MORE situations where but-for test fails:
1. **Alternative liability** (Summers): We know one of the defendants caused harm, but can't tell which one
2. **Market share liability** (Hymowitz): Too many defendants to identify, can't tell which one caused harm

**Key Distinction from Monday:**
- Monday's loss of chance: We know WHO caused harm, but probability of harm was <50%
- Today's doctrines: We DON'T know which defendant caused harm (identification problem)

---

## CORE DOCTRINE

### I. ALTERNATIVE LIABILITY (Summers v. Tice)

**The Problem:**
- Multiple defendants act negligently toward plaintiff
- ONE of them caused plaintiff's harm
- Plaintiff CANNOT determine which defendant caused the harm
- Traditional but-for test: FAILS (for each defendant: but for my conduct, would harm have occurred? YES — the other defendant would have done it)

**The Solution: Burden Shifting**
When:
1. **Small group of defendants** (typically 2-3, not hundreds)
2. **All acted negligently** toward plaintiff
3. **One of them caused the harm** (we know someone in the group did it)
4. **Plaintiff cannot determine which one**
5. **Defendants in better position to know** (each knows whether they caused harm)

**Then:**
- Burden of proof SHIFTS to EACH defendant
- Each defendant must prove they did NOT cause the injury
- If neither can prove non-causation → BOTH liable
- **Joint and several liability** (plaintiff can recover 100% from either defendant)

**Rationale:**
1. **Both wrongdoers**: All defendants were negligent toward plaintiff
2. **Practical unfairness**: Plaintiff placed in impossible position of pointing to specific defendant
3. **Better position**: Defendants know whether they caused harm; plaintiff doesn't
4. **Policy**: "Let them be the ones to apportion it among themselves" (Dean Wigmore)

**Key Requirements:**
- Small, identifiable group (not 300 companies)
- All defendants before court (or realistic possibility to join them)
- Single incident (not extended time period)
- All defendants negligent
- Plaintiff genuinely cannot identify tortfeasor

---

### II. MARKET SHARE LIABILITY (Hymowitz v. Eli Lilly)

**The DES Problem:**
- Approximately 300 manufacturers produced DES over 24 years
- DES chemically identical (fungible product)
- Long latency period (15-30 years before injury appears)
- Mothers never recorded which brand of DES they took
- **Genuinely impossible** to identify which manufacturer caused specific injury

**Why Traditional Doctrines Fail:**

| Doctrine | Why It Fails for DES |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Alternative liability (Summers)** | Too many defendants (300 vs. 2-3); 24-year period (not single incident); impossible to join all manufacturers |
| **Concert of action** | No common plan or agreement among manufacturers |
| **But-for causation** | Genuinely unknowable who caused harm |

**The Solution: Market Share Liability**

Each manufacturer liable for proportion of plaintiff's damages equal to its share of the NATIONAL market for DES used during pregnancy.

**Key Features:**

1. **NATIONAL MARKET** (not local/regional):
   - Fair reflection of overall culpability
   - Practical: same calculation for all plaintiffs
   - Avoids case-by-case market assessment

2. **SEVERAL LIABILITY** (not joint):
   - Each defendant pays only ITS percentage
   - Plaintiff's recovery NOT increased if some defendants missing
   - Plaintiff may NOT recover 100% if all manufacturers not sued
   - **Contrast with Summers** (joint and several liability)

3. **NO EXCULPATION**:
   - Defendant CANNOT escape by proving it didn't cause THIS plaintiff's injury
   - Liability based on OVERALL RISK CREATED to public
   - Even if manufacturer can prove plaintiff's mother couldn't have taken their pills → still liable

4. **WHO IS LIABLE**:
   - Only manufacturers who marketed DES for pregnancy use
   - Must have been in pregnancy market during relevant period
   - If never marketed for pregnancy → not liable

**Formula:**
Plaintiff's Total Damages × Defendant's Market Share = Defendant's Liability

**Example:**
- Plaintiff's damages: $1,000,000
- Manufacturer A's market share: 20%
- Manufacturer B's market share: 15%
- Plaintiff sues only A and B
- A pays: $200,000 (20% of $1M)
- B pays: $150,000 (15% of $1M)
- Total recovery: $350,000 (35% of damages)

**Rationale:**
- Based on RISK CONTRIBUTION, not specific causation
- "Liability is based on the over-all risk produced, and not causation in a single case"
- Manufacturers created risk; should bear cost of uncertainty

**Limitations:**
- Limited to DES or similarly unique circumstances
- Requires: fungible product, many manufacturers, long time period, genuine impossibility of identification
- Most courts refuse to extend beyond DES

---

### III. COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE VS. COMPARATIVE CAUSATION

**Traditional: Comparative Negligence**
- Reduce plaintiff's recovery based on plaintiff's FAULT
- Example: Plaintiff 30% at fault → recovery reduced 30%
- Focus: plaintiff's blameworthiness

**Alternative: Comparative Causation**
- Reduce recovery based on plaintiff's CONTRIBUTION to causation
- Example: Plaintiff's conduct 40% of causal factors → liable for 40%
- Focus: causal contribution, not fault

**The Question for Discussion:**
Which better serves tort law goals?
- Compensation
- Deterrence
- Corrective justice
- Fairness

**Huang's Angle:**
In Summers and Hymowitz, we're already doing something like comparative causation — apportioning liability based on relative causal contribution rather than all-or-nothing fault. Should this approach extend more broadly?

## DEFINITIONS TO HAVE READY

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Alternative Liability** | Burden-shifting doctrine when small group of negligent defendants, one caused harm, can't tell which |
| **Market Share Liability** | Each manufacturer liable for its proportion of national market share |
| **Burden Shifting** | Burden of proof moves from plaintiff to defendant |
| **Several Liability** | Each defendant pays only its share; not jointly responsible for full amount |
| **Joint and Several Liability** | Each defendant fully liable; plaintiff can recover 100% from any defendant |
| **No Exculpation** | Defendant cannot escape liability by proving it didn't cause THIS plaintiff's harm |
| **Fungible Product** | Chemically identical regardless of manufacturer |
| **Risk Contribution** | Liability based on overall risk created to market, not specific causation |
| **Indeterminate Plaintiff** | Can't identify which plaintiff was affected (opposite of indeterminate defendant) |
| **Comparative Causation** | Apportion liability based on causal contribution, not fault |

---

## EXPECTED HUANG QUESTIONS

### Q: "What's the difference between alternative liability and market share liability?"

**A:**
| Factor | Alternative Liability (Summers) | Market Share Liability (Hymowitz) |
|--------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Number of defendants** | Small (2-3) | Large (100s) |
| **Time period** | Single incident | Extended (24 years) |
| **All defendants before court?** | Yes (or realistic possibility) | No, impossible to join all |
| **Burden shifting?** | Yes, to defendants | No burden shift on causation |
| **Liability type** | Joint and several | Several only |
| **Can plaintiff recover 100%?** | Yes | No (only sues portion of market) |
| **Based on** | Presumed causation | Risk contribution/market share |
| **Defendant can exculpate?** | Yes, by proving non-causation | No (generally) |

### Q: "Why does Summers use joint and several liability but Hymowitz uses several liability?"

**A:**
- **Summers**: Small group, all before court, all negligent. It's fair to make each fully liable because (1) they're all wrongdoers, (2) they can sort it out among themselves, (3) plaintiff should be fully compensated. Joint and several encourages settlement and protects plaintiff.
- **Hymowitz**: 300 manufacturers, impossible to join all. If joint and several, any manufacturer sued could be on hook for 100% despite tiny market share. That's unfair. Several liability limits each to its actual culpability (market share). Plaintiff bears risk of not suing everyone.

### Q: "What is the 'no exculpation' rule in market share liability and why does it exist?"

**A:** No exculpation means a defendant cannot escape liability by proving it didn't cause THIS plaintiff's injury. Even if Manufacturer A can prove plaintiff's mother never bought their brand, Manufacturer A is still liable for its market share. Rationale: (1) Based on overall risk created to public, not individual causation; (2) Would be impossible/too burdensome for plaintiffs to prove negative; (3) Would defeat administrability of market share approach; (4) Liability is for market participation, not specific harm.

### Q: "When should alternative liability apply versus traditional rules?"

**A:** Alternative liability applies when ALL of these are true:
1. Small, identifiable group (typically 2-3 defendants)
2. All acted negligently toward plaintiff
3. Harm clearly came from one of them
4. Impossible to tell which one
5. Single incident/occurrence
6. Defendants in better position to know

If many defendants, long time period, can't join all → market share (if fungible product) or no recovery.

### Q: "Why is market share liability limited to DES (or similar cases)?"

**A:**
1. **Fungible product**: DES chemically identical regardless of manufacturer — rare
2. **Many manufacturers**: Usually product liability can identify manufacturer
3. **Long latency**: Identification impossible due to time delay
4. **No records**: Mothers never knew/recorded brand
5. **Mass tort**: Many similar cases need uniform solution

Most products don't meet these criteria. Asbestos, lead paint, vaccines all have differences that allow identification or don't justify market share.

### Q: "How do you calculate market share liability?"

**A:**
1. Determine plaintiff's total damages (as if full recovery)
2. Determine defendant's percentage of NATIONAL market for DES used during pregnancy
3. Multiply damages × market share percentage
4. That's defendant's liability (several only, not joint)

Example: $1M damages × 15% market share = $150,000 liability

### Q: "What's the policy justification for alternative liability?"

**A:**
1. **Fairness**: Both wrongdoers, both created risk
2. **Practical**: Defendants in better position to prove causation
3. **Justice**: Don't let wrongdoers escape because plaintiff can't prove the unprovable
4. **Deterrence**: Encourages defendants to monitor their own conduct
5. **Administrable**: Workable rule for small groups

## CASE BRIEFS

### Summers v. Tice, 33 Cal. 2d 80 (1948)

#### Rule of Law
When two or more defendants act negligently and only one caused plaintiff's injury, but plaintiff cannot determine which defendant caused the harm, the burden of proof shifts to defendants to absolve themselves. If neither can prove they didn't cause the injury, both are liable.

#### Facts
1. November 20, 1945: Summers and two defendants (Tice and Simonson) went quail hunting
2. Before hunting, plaintiff discussed safety: "exercise care," "keep in line"
3. During hunt, plaintiff proceeded up hill; defendants had unobstructed view, knew plaintiff's location (75 yards away)
4. Defendant Tice flushed quail; quail flew BETWEEN plaintiff and defendants
5. **BOTH defendants shot at quail**; both shot in plaintiff's direction
6. One shot struck plaintiff in right eye; another shot struck plaintiff in upper lip
7. Plaintiff could NOT determine which defendant's shot caused which injury

#### Procedural History
- Trial court (without jury): Found BOTH defendants negligent; found plaintiff NOT contributorily negligent; entered judgment against BOTH
- Defendants appealed
- California Supreme Court: AFFIRMED

#### Issue
Can judgment against both defendants stand when only one actually caused the injury and plaintiff cannot prove which one?

#### Holding & Reasoning
#### (Gibson, C.J.)
**Yes.** When defendants are all negligent toward plaintiff, and only one caused harm but plaintiff can't identify which, burden shifts to each defendant to prove they didn't cause injury.

1. **Finding of Negligence Proper**: Both shot toward plaintiff who was uphill; reasonable persons would not shoot toward another hunter. Issue of fact for trial court; finding supported by evidence.

2. **No Contributory Negligence/Assumption of Risk**: Plaintiff suggested safety procedures, acted cautiously. No automatic assumption of risk from joining hunting party.

3. **Burden Shifting Justified**:
   - Both defendants were negligent toward plaintiff
   - Plaintiff in "unfair position" of identifying which defendant caused harm
   - If one can escape, other may also → plaintiff remediless
   - Defendants "in far better position to offer evidence" determining who caused injury
   - "It should rest with them each to absolve himself if he can"

4. **Policy**: Dean Wigmore quoted: "The practical unfairness of denying the injured person redress simply because he cannot prove how much damage each did, when it is certain that between them they did all; let them be the ones to apportion it among themselves."

5. **Comparison to Ybarra**: Operating table case where patient injured while unconscious; all connected with operation liable because "chief evidence of true cause...practically accessible to [defendant] but inaccessible to injured person."

#### Disposition
**AFFIRMED**. Judgment against both defendants upheld.

### Hymowitz v. Eli Lilly & Co., 73 N.Y.2d 487 (1989)

#### Rule of Law
New York adopts market share liability theory using national market for DES cases where plaintiff cannot identify specific manufacturer. Each defendant held severally (not jointly) liable for proportion of damages equal to its share of national DES market for pregnancy use. No exculpation by proving non-causation in individual case.

#### Facts

**Background - What is DES?**
- Diethylstilbestrol = synthetic estrogen
- NEVER PATENTED (any manufacturer could produce)
- Chemically IDENTICAL regardless of manufacturer

**Regulatory History:**
- 1941: FDA approved 12 manufacturers to market DES for non-pregnancy ailments
- 1947: FDA began approving DES for miscarriage prevention
- 1951: FDA concluded DES "generally safe" for pregnancy; stopped requiring NDAs for pregnancy use
- 1971: FDA BANNED DES for pregnancy use (caused cancer in daughters)

**Market Characteristics:**
- ~300 manufacturers produced DES
- Companies constantly entering/leaving market
- 24-year period (1947-1971) of pregnancy use
- All DES chemically identical
- Druggists filled from whatever available; no brand loyalty

**Plaintiffs' Predicament:**
- DES "daughters" injured by DES mothers took during pregnancy
- Injuries appeared 15-30 years later (cancer, reproductive issues)
- **Cannot identify which manufacturer** produced pills mothers took
- Reasons: identical product, 300 manufacturers, 24-year period, no records, long latency

**Procedural History:**
- Nearly 500 similar cases pending in New York
- Trial courts divided on recovery without identification
- Court of Appeals granted review to resolve statewide issue
- Attorney General intervened supporting plaintiffs

#### Issue
Can plaintiffs recover for DES injuries without identifying specific manufacturer? If so, how is liability apportioned?

#### Holding & Reasoning
#### (Hancock, Jr., J.)
**Yes.** New York adopts market share liability using national market.

1. **Traditional Doctrines Don't Work**:
   - **Alternative liability (Summers)**: Too many defendants (300), 24-year period, impossible to join all
   - **Concert of action**: No common plan or agreement; each acted independently
   - **But-for causation**: Genuinely unknowable who caused harm

2. **Market Share Liability Adopted**:
   - Each manufacturer liable for proportion of plaintiff's damages equal to its share of NATIONAL DES market for pregnancy use
   - Based on OVERALL CULPABILITY, not specific causation
   - "Liability is based on the over-all risk produced, and not causation in a single case"

3. **NATIONAL MARKET (Not Regional/Local)**:
   - Fair reflection of total culpability
   - Practical: same calculation for all cases
   - Avoids case-by-case market assessment
   - Administrable given 500+ pending cases

4. **SEVERAL LIABILITY (Not Joint)**:
   - Each defendant pays only ITS percentage
   - Plaintiff's recovery NOT increased if some defendants missing
   - Plaintiff may NOT recover 100% if all manufacturers not sued
   - Protects defendants from over-exposure

5. **NO EXCULPATION**:
   - Defendant CANNOT escape by proving it didn't cause THIS plaintiff's injury
   - Liability based on market participation and overall risk
   - "No exculpation of a defendant who, although a member of the market producing DES for pregnancy use, appears not to have caused a particular plaintiff's injury"
   - Exculpation would undermine administrability

6. **Policy Justifications**:
   - **Justice**: Real injuries suffered; deserve relief
   - **Fairness**: Manufacturers created risk; should bear burden of uncertainty
   - **Deterrence**: Encourages product safety
   - **Risk spreading**: Manufacturers can spread loss through insurance/pricing

7. **Limited to DES**:
   - Rule limited to DES cases (at least for now)
   - Unique circumstances: fungible product, many manufacturers, long latency, genuine impossibility of identification
   - Not automatic extension to other products

8. **Statute of Limitations**:
   - Legislature revived time-barred DES claims (changed accrual from exposure to discovery)
   - Constitutional challenge REJECTED
   - Shows legislative intent to provide relief

#### Disposition (Partial)
**Cases REMANDED** for determination of market shares. Majority and one concurring; one justice dissented in part on exculpation issue.

#### Dissent in Part (Mollen, J.)
**Mollen would allow exculpation**: Should permit defendants to prove they couldn't have caused injury (e.g., entered market after mother's pregnancy). Shift burden to defendants on causation; those who can't prove non-causation remain liable with joint and several liability. Majority rejected this as too difficult/impossible.

## COMPARING THE DOCTRINES

### When to Use Which Causation Doctrine

| Doctrine | When to Apply | Key Requirements | Liability Type |
|----------|---------------|------------------|----------------|
| **But-for causation** | Standard case | Can identify defendant; normal causal chain | Individual liability |
| **Loss of chance** | Medical malpractice; patient had <50% chance | Negligence reduced chance; expert testimony | Proportional damages |
| **Alternative liability** | Small group; can't identify which defendant | 2-3 defendants; all negligent; single incident | Joint and several |
| **Market share liability** | Many manufacturers; fungible product; impossible identification | 100s of defendants; extended period; fungible | Several only |
| **Multiple sufficient causes** | Two+ causes, each alone sufficient | Each actually contributed; overdetermined | Varies |

### Key Distinctions

**Alternative Liability vs. Market Share Liability:**

| Factor | Alternative (Summers) | Market Share (Hymowitz) |
|--------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Number of defendants | 2-3 | Hundreds |
| Time period | Single incident | 24 years |
| All defendants joinable? | Yes | No, impossible |
| Burden shifting? | Yes, to defendants | No |
| Liability type | Joint and several | Several |
| Plaintiff recovers | 100% | % of market sued |
| Based on | Presumed causation | Risk contribution |
| Can exculpate? | Yes | No |
| Limited to? | Small group situations | DES (mostly) |

**Market Share vs. Other Doctrines:**

- **Concert of action**: Requires common plan/agreement; DES manufacturers acted independently
- **Enterprise liability**: Requires industry-wide collaboration; not present in DES
- **Risk contribution (Wisconsin)**: Similar to market share but allows exculpation; burden shifts to defendants

---

## POLICY/THEORY

### Alternative Liability Policy Arguments

**FOR:**
1. **Fairness**: All defendants wrongdoers; none should escape
2. **Practical**: Defendants know what they did; plaintiff doesn't
3. **Justice**: Don't let formal causation requirement deny recovery
4. **Deterrence**: Encourages defendants to be careful; can't hide in group
5. **Administrable**: Workable rule for small groups

**AGAINST:**
1. **Unfair to innocent defendant**: One defendant might not have caused harm but still liable
2. **Against traditional causation**: Relaxes but-for requirement
3. **Expandability**: Where does it stop? Could apply to larger groups

### Market Share Liability Policy Arguments

**FOR:**
1. **Justice**: Real injuries deserve remedy despite identification problems
2. **Fairness**: Manufacturers created risk; should bear cost
3. **Deterrence**: Encourages careful testing and marketing
4. **Risk spreading**: Manufacturers better risk bearers than victims
5. **Administrability**: Uniform rule for mass tort
6. **Legislative intent**: Statute of limitations revival shows intent to provide relief

**AGAINST:**
1. **Not traditional causation**: Based on risk, not actual causation
2. **Unfair to small market share**: Tiny manufacturer could be liable despite minimal role
3. **No exculpation**: Unfair to manufacturers who didn't cause THIS injury
4. **Floodgates**: Could extend to other products (though courts limit)
5. **Several liability**: Plaintiff may not recover fully

### Comparative Negligence vs. Comparative Causation

**Comparative Negligence (Traditional):**
- Reduces recovery based on plaintiff's FAULT
- Example: Plaintiff 30% at fault → loses 30%
- Focus: Blameworthiness

**Comparative Causation (Alternative):**
- Reduces recovery based on causal CONTRIBUTION
- Example: Plaintiff's conduct 40% of cause → liable for 40%
- Focus: Causal role, not fault

**The Question:**
Which better serves tort law goals?
- **Compensation**: Comparative causation might be more accurate
- **Deterrence**: Both provide similar incentives
- **Corrective justice**: Comparative negligence focuses on wrongdoing; comparative causation focuses on causal contribution
- **Fairness**: Depends on perspective — fault-based or cause-based?

---

## QUICK HYPOS

### Hypo 1: Alternative Liability - Hunting Variation

**Facts**: Three hunters (A, B, C) shoot negligently toward plaintiff. All three act negligently. One pellet hits plaintiff, causing injury. Plaintiff cannot tell which hunter fired the hit.

**Analysis**:
- Alternative liability applies
- Small group (3); all negligent; single incident; plaintiff can't identify
- Burden shifts to EACH hunter to prove they didn't cause injury
- If none can prove non-causation → ALL THREE liable
- Joint and several liability

**Huang Push**: Does it matter that there are THREE instead of TWO? What if there were FIVE hunters?

---

### Hypo 2: Alternative Liability Does NOT Apply

**Facts**: Three companies operated factory near plaintiff's home over 20 years. All dumped chemicals. Plaintiff develops cancer. Cannot determine which company's chemicals caused cancer.

**Analysis**:
- Alternative liability does NOT apply
- Extended time period (20 years) not single incident
- May not be able to join all relevant parties
- Courts would likely require plaintiff to identify which defendant caused harm
- No recovery without identification

**Contrast with Summers**: Single shooting incident vs. 20 years of dumping

---

### Hypo 3: Market Share Calculation

**Facts**: DES plaintiff sues three manufacturers for $2,000,000 in damages.
- Manufacturer A: 25% national market share
- Manufacturer B: 15% national market share
- Manufacturer C: 10% national market share
- Other manufacturers: 50% (not sued)

**Calculation**:
- A pays: $2,000,000 × 0.25 = $500,000
- B pays: $2,000,000 × 0.15 = $300,000
- C pays: $2,000,000 × 0.10 = $200,000
- Total recovery: $1,000,000 (50% of damages)

**Huang Push**: Is this fair to plaintiff who bears risk of unsued manufacturers? Is it fair to manufacturers who pay despite not causing THIS injury?

---

### Hypo 4: Market Share - No Exculpation

**Facts**: Manufacturer A entered DES market in 1965. Plaintiff's mother took DES in 1960. Plaintiff sues Manufacturer A for DES injuries. Manufacturer A proves plaintiff's mother couldn't have taken their DES.

**Analysis**:
- Under Hymowitz rule: Manufacturer A STILL LIABLE for its market share
- No exculpation allowed
- Liability based on market participation and overall risk
- Even though Manufacturer A didn't cause THIS injury

**Huang Push**: Is this fair? Why does court reject exculpation?

---

### Hypo 5: Market Share Does NOT Apply

**Facts**: Plaintiff injured by defective tire. Multiple tire manufacturers over 10 years. Tires not fungible (different designs, brands identifiable). Cannot identify which manufacturer made plaintiff's tire.

**Analysis**:
- Market share liability does NOT apply
- Product not fungible (tires differ by manufacturer)
- Identification possible with more investigation
- Most courts reject market share outside DES context

**Contrast with Hymowitz**: DES identical across manufacturers; tires not identical

---

### Hypo 6: Multiple Sufficient Causes vs. Alternative Liability

**Facts**: Two fires (A and B) burn House simultaneously. Each alone sufficient. Fire A set negligently by Arsonist. Fire B started negligently by Neighbor. House burns.

**Analysis**:
- This is MULTIPLE SUFFICIENT CAUSES, not alternative liability
- Both fires actually contributed (both substantial factors)
- Both liable
- But-for test fails but substantial factor applies

**Contrast with Summers**: In Summers, only ONE bullet caused injury (we don't know which). Here, BOTH fires caused harm.

---

### Hypo 7: Comparative Causation

**Facts**: Plaintiff injured in car accident. Defendant ran red light. Plaintiff was speeding (not illegal). Evidence shows plaintiff's speeding contributed 30% to severity of injuries; defendant's red-light running contributed 70%.

**Question**: Should plaintiff's recovery be reduced by 30% (comparative negligence) or is 30% the appropriate apportionment based on causal contribution?

**Analysis**:
- **Comparative negligence**: Was plaintiff "at fault"? Speeding might be negligent
- **Comparative causation**: Plaintiff's conduct contributed 30% causally regardless of fault
- Huang's question: Which approach better serves tort law goals?

---

### Hypo 8: Product Identification - Brake Pads

**Facts**: Three companies make brake pads for specific car model. Plaintiff's brakes fail due to defect, causing accident. Cannot identify which company made plaintiff's brake pads. All three companies sell in local market with different shares.

**Analysis**:
- Alternative liability might apply (small group)
- Market share probably does NOT apply (not DES-like)
- Key questions: Are brake pads fungible? Can we identify manufacturer with more investigation? How many total manufacturers?

**Huang Push**: How does this compare to Summers? How does it compare to Hymowitz?

## EXAM SIGNALS

#EXAM_SIGNAL

**Huang's Emphasis:**

1. **Distinguish the doctrines cold**: Alternative liability (Summers) vs. market share (Hymowitz) vs. multiple sufficient causes vs. loss of chance. Exam will test ability to spot which doctrine applies.

2. **Key requirements for alternative liability**:
   - Small group (2-3, not hundreds)
   - All negligent
   - Single incident
   - All before court (or realistic possibility)
   - Plaintiff genuinely can't identify

3. **Key requirements for market share**:
   - Many manufacturers (100s)
   - Extended time period
   - Fungible product
   - Genuinely impossible to identify
   - National market (not local)
   - Several liability (not joint)
   - No exculpation

4. **Joint and several vs. several liability**: This is CRITICAL. Summers = joint and several (plaintiff gets 100%). Hymowitz = several (plaintiff gets % sued). Know the difference and why.

5. **No exculpation in market share**: Defendant can't prove they didn't cause THIS plaintiff's injury. Based on overall risk, not specific causation. Most courts adopt this rule (Hymowitz majority).

6. **Comparative causation question**: Should liability be apportioned by causal contribution rather than fault? This is a policy discussion Huang will likely explore.

**Exam Checklist:**
- [ ] Identify causation problem type
- [ ] Apply but-for test first
- [ ] If but-for fails, identify WHY:
  - [ ] Loss of chance (<50%) → Matsuyama
  - [ ] Multiple sufficient causes → substantial factor
  - [ ] Small group, can't identify which → alternative liability
  - [ ] Many manufacturers, fungible, impossible ID → market share
- [ ] For alternative liability: verify small group, all negligent, single incident
- [ ] For market share: verify fungible, many defendants, extended period, impossible ID
- [ ] Remember: Summers = joint and several; Hymowitz = several only
- [ ] For market share: no exculpation (usually)
- [ ] Calculate damages correctly (proportional)

## BEING ON CALL: BLUEBIRD PANEL

If you're called on today, here's your 60-second opening:

"Today we're covering two special causation doctrines for when plaintiff can't identify which defendant caused harm. Alternative liability from Summers v. Tice applies when a small group of defendants all act negligently, one of them causes harm, but plaintiff can't tell which one. The burden shifts to each defendant to prove they didn't cause it, and if neither can, both are jointly and severally liable. Market share liability from Hymowitz v. Eli Lilly applies to DES cases where hundreds of manufacturers made identical product over decades, making identification genuinely impossible. Each manufacturer is severally liable for its share of the national market, with no exculpation. The key differences: Summers is small group, joint and several, burden shifts; Hymowitz is many defendants, several liability, no burden shift, based on risk contribution not causation."

Then be ready for:
- Applying Summers to hypotheticals (hunting, construction, medical)
- Applying Hymowitz to hypotheticals (other products? courts say no)
- Calculating market share damages
- Explaining no exculpation rule
- Comparing the doctrines
- Policy arguments for/against each
