## CONTINUITY FROM LAST WEEK

**Week 4 Causation-in-Fact Summary:**
- **Class 6 (Mon 2/9)**: But-for causation, loss of chance (Matsuyama), multiple sufficient causes
- **Class 7 (Wed 2/11)**: Alternative liability (Summers), market share liability (Hymowitz)

**Bridge to Today:**
Last week covered **causation-in-fact** = Which parties CAN be said to have caused harm?

Today begins **proximate cause/scope of liability** = Which causes-in-fact SHOULD be held liable?

**Key Distinction:**
- **Cause-in-fact** (but-for test): Did defendant's conduct cause plaintiff's harm? (Yes/no factual determination)
- **Proximate cause** (foreseeability test): Should defendant be liable for that harm? (Policy/scope limitation)

**The Setup:**
- Defendant was negligent ✓
- Defendant's negligence was cause-in-fact of harm ✓
- BUT: Not all causes-in-fact are "proximate causes" subject to liability
- **This class**: When do we narrow down the list of liable parties?

---

## CORE DOCTRINE

### I. WHY PROXIMATE CAUSE EXISTS (The Problem)

**Foundational Principle:**
> Even after proving duty + breach + causation-in-fact + damages, liability is NOT automatic. Defendant's negligence must also be a **"proximate cause"** of plaintiff's injury.

**The Issue:**
- Every event has infinite but-for causes
- If parents hadn't met → no collision
- If defendant hadn't gone to college → no collision  
- If defendant hadn't run red light → no collision

**All are causes-in-fact, but only negligent causes matter for liability.**

**The Question:**
Which negligent but-for causes should be held liable?

**Answer:**
Only those causes that are "proximate" (using foreseeability/harm-within-the-risk tests).

---

### II. THE TERMINOLOGY PROBLEM (Critical for Huang)

**WARNING:** Courts use different terms for the same concept:

**Traditional Vocabulary:**
- "Proximate cause"
- "Legal cause"
- "Remoteness"
- "Directness"

**Modern Vocabulary (Restatement Third):**
- "Scope of liability"
- "Harm within the risk"
- "Risk standard"

**Huang's Teaching Point:**
> The Restatement Third REJECTS the term "proximate cause" and uses "scope of liability" instead. We will learn BOTH frameworks and keep them conceptually distinct.

**Why This Matters:**
Different courts use different frameworks. You must:
1. Recognize which framework a court is using
2. Make persuasive arguments under either rubric
3. Understand how the frameworks relate (or don't relate)

---

### III. BERRY V. SUGAR NOTCH - THE CLASSIC ILLUSTRATION

**Why This Case Exists:**
Tests intuitions about when causation is "too remote" or "coincidental" to impose liability.

**Facts:**
- Plaintiff (motorman) driving trolley in violent windstorm
- Driving in excess of 8 mph speed limit (violation of ordinance)
- Large chestnut tree blown down by wind
- Tree crushes trolley roof exactly as trolley passes underneath
- Plaintiff injured

**Defendant's Argument:**
Speeding WAS cause-in-fact because:
- But for speeding, trolley wouldn't have been at that exact spot at that exact moment
- Therefore speeding brought plaintiff to place of accident at moment of accident

**Court's Holding:**
Speeding was NOT proximate cause of injury.

**Reasoning:**
1. **Foreseeability**: Speeding didn't increase the risk that tree would fall on trolley
2. **Harm-within-the-risk**: The harm (tree falling) was NOT one of the risks that makes speeding negligent
3. **Coincidence**: "Merest chance" that speed brought him there at that moment
4. **Could go either way**: High speed might have carried him BEYOND tree to safety, or slow speed might have put him there instead

**The Principle:**
> Being a but-for cause is NOT enough. The injury must be a **foreseeable result** of the defendant's negligence.

**Application:**
- Risks of speeding: collision, inability to stop, loss of control
- NOT a risk of speeding: happening to be at spot X at time Y when unrelated force strikes

---

### IV. THE TRADITIONAL APPROACH - "PROXIMATE CAUSE"

**A. Foreseeability Test (Primary Test)**

**Rule:**
> Defendant's negligence is a proximate cause of plaintiff's harm if **causing that harm was a foreseeable result** of acting as defendant did.

**Application to Ordinary Cases:**
- Defendant runs red light → collision foreseeable
- If negligent + cause-in-fact → proximate cause AS A MATTER OF LAW
- Jury won't even get proximate cause instruction in ordinary cases

**Why "Proximate" is Misleading:**
- Has more to do with negligence than causation
- Really asking: Was harm to THIS plaintiff foreseeable given defendant's negligence?

**Two-Phase Negligence Analysis:**
1. **Phase 1 (Breach)**: Was defendant negligent at all? (Unreasonably risked harming someone/something)
2. **Phase 2 (Proximate Cause)**: Was harm to THIS PARTICULAR PLAINTIFF foreseeable?

**B. Harm-Within-the-Risk Test (Clarification/Sharpening)**

**Rule:**
> Liability only if injury to plaintiff was a **harm-within-the-risk** that made defendant's action negligent.

**The Question:**
Did defendant's negligence increase the risk of the type of harm that occurred?

**If YES → Proximate cause (usually)**
**If NO → NO proximate cause (freak accident/coincidence)**

**Examples:**
- **Berry**: Speeding doesn't increase risk of tree falling → NO proximate cause
- **Running red light**: DOES increase risk of intersection collision → proximate cause
- **Rescuer cases**: Negligently endangering someone DOES increase risk that rescuers will be harmed attempting rescue → proximate cause

**C. Traditional Vocabulary: Remoteness and Intervening Causes**

**Remoteness in Time or Space:**
- Historically: No liability if harm was "remote" from negligence
- Today: Subsumed into foreseeability test
- More remote = less foreseeable (but not automatically no liability)

**Intervening Causes:**
- Another force acts between defendant's negligence and plaintiff's harm
- Question: Does intervening cause break the chain of causation?

**Superseding Cause:**
- An intervening cause that IS unforeseeable
- BREAKS the causal chain
- Relieves original defendant of liability

**Non-Superseding Intervening Cause:**
- An intervening cause that IS foreseeable
- Does NOT break causal chain
- Original defendant still liable

**NJ Pattern Jury Instruction 6.14 (Traditional Approach):**
- "Superseding cause" = intervening cause that was NOT reasonably foreseeable
- If superseding, defendant NOT liable
- Burden on defendant to prove superseding cause

---

### V. THE RESTATEMENT (THIRD) APPROACH - "SCOPE OF LIABILITY"

**A. The Conceptual Shift**

**Restatement Third REJECTS "proximate cause" terminology.**

**Why?**
- "Proximate cause" suggests causation analysis
- Actually about limiting scope of liability for policy reasons
- Better term: "Scope of liability"

**Restatement Third § 29: Limitations on Liability for Tortious Conduct**

> An actor's liability is limited to those harms that result from the risks that made the actor's conduct tortious.

**Translation:**
Only liable for harms within the scope of the risk that made conduct negligent in the first place.

**B. The "Harm-Within-the-Risk" Approach**

**Core Test:**
Was the harm that occurred within the SCOPE OF THE RISK that made defendant's conduct tortious?

**Step-by-Step:**
1. Identify the negligent conduct
2. Identify what RISKS made that conduct negligent
3. Ask: Is the harm that occurred one of those risks?
4. If YES → within scope of liability
5. If NO → outside scope of liability

**Application to Berry:**
1. Negligent conduct: Speeding
2. Risks that make speeding negligent: collision, loss of control, can't stop in time
3. Harm that occurred: Tree fell on trolley
4. Is tree-falling one of the risks of speeding? **NO**
5. Therefore: Outside scope of liability

**C. How Restatement Third Handles "Intervening" Causes**

**Traditional Approach:**
- Focuses on whether intervening cause was "foreseeable" or "superseding"
- Uses causal language

**Restatement Third Approach:**
- Asks: Was the intervening force within the scope of the original risk?
- Uses risk language, not causal language

**Restatement Third § 29, Comment d - Illustrations:**

The comment d illustrations show:
- Sometimes an intervening act IS within scope of original risk → liability
- Sometimes an intervening act is NOT within scope of original risk → no liability
- Focuses on the NATURE OF THE RISK created, not on causal chains

---

### VI. JUDGE VS. JURY ON PROXIMATE CAUSE

**General Rule (KA pp. 170-172):**

**Judge decides (as matter of law) when:**
- No reasonable jury could find proximate cause
- OR no reasonable jury could fail to find proximate cause
- Classic cases at extremes: Berry (no proximate cause as matter of law)

**Jury decides (as question of fact) when:**
- Reasonable minds could differ
- Foreseeability is genuinely disputed
- Falls in the middle ground

**Strategic Note:**
Huang will test whether you understand:
- Which issues are for judge
- Which issues are for jury
- How to argue that issue should go one way or the other

---

## DEFINITIONS TO HAVE READY

**Proximate Cause (Traditional):**
A cause-in-fact that was a foreseeable result of defendant's negligence, such that defendant should be held liable.

**Scope of Liability (Restatement Third):**
The limitation on liability to harms that result from the risks that made actor's conduct tortious.

**Harm-Within-the-Risk:**
A harm that falls within the scope of the risks that made defendant's conduct negligent.

**Intervening Cause:**
A force that acts between defendant's negligence and plaintiff's harm.

**Superseding Cause (Traditional):**
An unforeseeable intervening cause that breaks the causal chain and relieves defendant of liability.

**Cause-in-Fact vs. Proximate Cause:**
- Cause-in-fact = factual causation (but-for test)
- Proximate cause = legal causation (foreseeability/scope limitation)

**Remoteness:**
Distance in time, space, or causal connection between negligence and harm; relevant to foreseeability.

**Foreseeability:**
Whether harm was a predictable or reasonably anticipated result of defendant's conduct.

---

## EXPECTED HUANG QUESTIONS

### Panel Questions (YOU'RE ON CALL - BLUEBIRD)

**Q1: "Why shouldn't we hold the motorman in Berry liable? He was speeding, wasn't he?"**

**A:** Yes, he was negligent by speeding. But proximate cause requires more than just being a cause-in-fact. The harm that occurred—a tree falling on the trolley—was not a foreseeable result of speeding. Speeding increases risks like collision or inability to stop, but not the risk that a tree would fall at that exact moment. It was pure coincidence that his speed brought him to that spot when the tree fell.

**Q2: "But isn't everything foreseeable in hindsight? How do we draw the line?"**

**A:** We use the harm-within-the-risk test: Did the defendant's negligence increase the risk of the type of harm that occurred? If speeding doesn't make tree-falling more likely, then the tree falling is outside the scope of liability. The test focuses on ex ante risks, not ex post results.

**Q3: "What if the motorman had been going slowly and avoided the tree? Doesn't that show his speed mattered?"**

**A:** The court addressed this: high speed might have carried him beyond the tree to safety, OR slow speed might have put him there instead. Because speed could have helped or hurt unpredictably, it didn't create or increase the risk. It's simply not one of the reasons speeding is negligent.

**Q4: "Walk me through the two frameworks. How are they different?"**

**A:** 
- **Traditional "Proximate Cause"**: Asks if harm was a "foreseeable result" of negligence; uses causal language; analyzes "intervening" and "superseding" causes
- **Restatement Third "Scope of Liability"**: Asks if harm falls "within the risks" that made conduct tortious; uses risk language; focuses on scope of risk, not causal chains
- **Key difference**: Same basic test (foreseeability/harm-within-risk) but different vocabulary and framing

**Q5: "Give me an example of an intervening cause under each framework."**

**A:** 
**Fact pattern:** D negligently crashes into P's car. P goes to hospital. Hospital negligently infects P with MRSA. P sues D.

- **Traditional**: Hospital's negligence is an intervening cause. Question: Was it foreseeable? If medical negligence is a foreseeable risk when someone is injured and needs treatment, it's not superseding, and D remains liable.
  
- **Restatement Third**: Was risk of negligent medical treatment within the scope of risks that made D's driving negligent? If yes, D liable. Focuses on whether medical complications are part of the risk of injuring someone.

**Q6: "Is proximate cause ever a jury question, or is it always for the judge?"**

**A:** It depends. When reasonable minds cannot differ (like Berry—clearly not proximate), it's decided by judge as matter of law. But in close cases where foreseeability is genuinely disputed, it goes to the jury as a question of fact.

**Q7: "Let's go back to Sabatino—the designated driver case from Week 3. How does proximate cause apply there?"**

**A:** Sabatino offered to be designated driver but got drunk anyway. Under proximate cause:
1. Was it foreseeable that offering to drive then drinking would lead to accident? YES
2. Is drunk-driving accident within the risks of promising to be DD then drinking? YES
3. Therefore: Proximate cause satisfied

Traditional approach: No superseding cause; very foreseeable chain of events.
Restatement Third: Harm (drunk driving crash) is within scope of risk created by undertaking duty then breaching it.

---

### Variation Questions (Expect These)

**"What if two different trees fell?"**
Still no proximate cause if neither tree-falling is within risks of speeding.

**"What if the motorman was speeding AND the tree was rotted?"**
If both were causes-in-fact, need to analyze each separately:
- Speeding: Still not proximate cause (same Berry reasoning)
- Rotted tree: If borough maintained trees, negligent maintenance could be proximate cause

**"In Jones v. Roth, how long is too long for proximate cause?"**
Nearly a year passed between car accident and bus accident. Court said too remote. We'll discuss this as fact pattern today.

## CASE BRIEFS

### Berry v. Sugar Notch Borough, 191 Pa. 845 (1899)

**Rule of Law:**
Defendant's negligence is not a proximate cause of plaintiff's injury if the harm was not a foreseeable result of the negligent conduct, even if the negligence was a but-for cause.

**Facts:**
1. Plaintiff (motorman) employed by traction company
2. Sugar Notch ordinance: 8 mph speed limit on borough streets
3. Plaintiff drove trolley "considerably in excess" of 8 mph
4. Violent windstorm occurring
5. Large chestnut tree blown down as trolley passed underneath
6. Tree crushed roof and injured plaintiff

**Issue:**
Does the fact that plaintiff was speeding (violating ordinance) affect his right to recover damages for injuries?

**Holding (Fell, J.):**
No; the speeding neither caused nor contributed to the accident.

**Reasoning:**
1. **But-for causation**: Speed WAS a but-for cause (brought him to that spot at that moment)
2. **Mere chance**: "The merest chance, and a thing which no foresight could have predicted"
3. **Could have gone either way**: High speed might have carried him beyond danger; slow speed might have put him there too
4. **Not the risk**: The risks that make speeding negligent (collision, loss of control) did not include tree-falling
5. **Possible severity argument rejected**: Even if speed increased damage severity, jury had no basis to quantify this

**Disposition:**
Judgment for plaintiff affirmed.

**Exam Trigger Facts:**
- Negligent defendant (speeding)
- But-for causation satisfied (timing)
- But harm not within foreseeable risks
- "Freak accident" / coincidence fact pattern

---

### Jones v. Roth, 2019 IL App (1st) 171284 (Illustrative Fact Pattern)

**Purpose:** Illustration of intervening cause / remoteness analysis

**Facts (Paragraphs 1-7, 12-16):**
1. September 2013: Jones and Roth in car accident at intersection in Chicago
2. Roth allegedly negligent in causing collision
3. Jones injured, saw doctor, went to physical therapy
4. August 2014 (nearly a year later): Jones on bus with mobility scooter
5. Bus driver negligently failed to properly harness scooter
6. Jones fell and was injured again
7. Jones sued Roth for injuries from BOTH accidents

**Issue:**
Is Roth liable for injuries Jones suffered in the subsequent bus accident nearly a year later?

**Holding:**
No; bus accident injuries too remote and not reasonably foreseeable result of Roth's negligence.

**Reasoning:**
1. **Intervening negligence**: Bus driver's negligence intervened
2. **Remoteness in time**: Nearly a year elapsed
3. **Attenuation**: Connection "too remote and attenuated"
4. **Not foreseeable**: That Jones would be injured by unrelated third party's negligence nearly a year later was not reasonably foreseeable
5. **Traditional language**: Bus driver's negligence was "superseding cause"

**Key Quote:**
"That Jones would be injured nearly a year after her car accident with Roth by the intervening negligence of a bus driver failing to properly harness her scooter was not a reasonably foreseeable result of Roth's negligence."

**Use in Class:**
Huang will use this as practice fact pattern for applying proximate cause / scope of liability tests.

**Questions to Anticipate:**
- Is the bus accident within the scope of risks created by the car accident?
- Does time/space remoteness matter?
- Is there a superseding cause?
- Would Restatement Third approach lead to different result?

---

## TWO FRAMEWORKS COMPARISON

| Element | Traditional "Proximate Cause" | Restatement Third "Scope of Liability" |
|---------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Core Term** | Proximate cause | Scope of liability |
| **Primary Test** | Foreseeability | Harm-within-the-risk |
| **Framing** | Was harm foreseeable result? | Was harm within scope of risks? |
| **Language** | Causal language | Risk language |
| **Intervening Causes** | "Superseding" if unforeseeable | Within/outside scope of original risk |
| **Focus** | Chain of causation | Scope of risk created |
| **Vocabulary** | Proximate, remote, direct, intervening, superseding | Scope, risk, harm-within-the-risk |

**The Key Similarity:**
Both ask fundamentally the same question: Should defendant be liable for this harm?

**The Key Difference:**
Different vocabulary and conceptual framing for answering that question.

**Huang's Point:**
Courts are confused about these concepts. Your job: Recognize confusion and make persuasive arguments under ANY framework the court prefers.

---

## POLICY/THEORY

### Why Limit Liability to Proximate Causes?

**1. Corrective Justice / Fairness:**
- Defendant shouldn't be liable for coincidental harms
- Moral blameworthiness tied to foreseeable harms
- Unfair to hold someone liable for truly unforeseeable consequences

**2. Deterrence / Efficiency:**
- Can only deter foreseeable harms
- Threatening liability for unforeseeable harms doesn't change behavior
- Optimal deterrence: liability = expected harm from foreseeable risks

**3. Practical Administration:**
- Infinite but-for causes of any harm
- Need workable stopping point
- Foreseeability provides principled boundary

**4. Jury Sympathy / Proximate Cause as "Fudge Factor":**
- Sometimes used to limit liability where other elements are met but result feels wrong
- Allows flexibility in extreme cases
- Can be abused to reach desired results

### Comparative Negligence vs. Comparative Causation (Carryover from Wednesday)

**Comparative Negligence (Standard):**
- Divide liability based on relative FAULT
- P 30% negligent, D 70% negligent → P recovers 70% of damages

**Comparative Causation (Alternative):**
- Divide liability based on relative CAUSATION
- D1 caused 30% of harm, D2 caused 70% → liable accordingly

**Why Comparative Causation Matters Here:**
Proximate cause determines WHO is liable; comparative causation would determine HOW MUCH each liable party pays.

**Policy Debate:**
- Which better serves corrective justice?
- Which better serves deterrence?
- Which is more administrable?

---

## QUICK HYPOS

### Hypo 1: The Lightning Strike

**Facts:**
- D speeding on highway during thunderstorm
- Lightning strikes tree beside road
- Tree falls on D's car just as it passes
- D's passenger (P) injured

**Questions:**
1. Is D's speeding a but-for cause of P's injuries?
2. Is D's speeding a proximate cause of P's injuries?
3. Traditional framework analysis?
4. Restatement Third analysis?

**Answers:**
1. **But-for**: YES (if D not speeding, wouldn't have been at that spot at that moment)
2. **Proximate cause**: NO (same as Berry—pure coincidence)
3. **Traditional**: Lightning strike not foreseeable result of speeding; harm not within risks that make speeding negligent
4. **Restatement Third**: Lightning strike not within scope of risks created by speeding; outside scope of liability

---

### Hypo 2: The Rescuer

**Facts:**
- D negligently starts fire
- P sees person trapped in burning building
- P rushes in to rescue, is injured

**Questions:**
1. Is D's negligence a but-for cause of P's injuries?
2. Is D's negligence a proximate cause of P's injuries?
3. Why might this be different from Berry?

**Answers:**
1. **But-for**: YES (no fire → no rescue → no injury)
2. **Proximate cause**: LIKELY YES ("danger invites rescue" doctrine)
3. **Different from Berry**: Rescuers attempting rescue IS a foreseeable risk of negligently endangering someone; it IS harm-within-the-risk

**Policy**: Negligently creating danger foreseeably leads to rescue attempts. This IS within the scope of risks created.

---

### Hypo 3: The Domino Effect

**Facts:**
- D negligently rear-ends P1's car
- P1's car pushed forward into P2's car
- P2's car pushed forward into P3's car
- All three cars damaged

**Questions:**
1. Is D's negligence a proximate cause of damage to P1's car?
2. Is D's negligence a proximate cause of damage to P2's car?
3. Is D's negligence a proximate cause of damage to P3's car?
4. Where do we draw the line?

**Answers:**
1. **P1**: YES (direct, foreseeable)
2. **P2**: YES (chain reaction foreseeable in rear-end collision)
3. **P3**: LIKELY YES (still foreseeable part of chain reaction)
4. **Line**: Depends on foreseeability; multiple-car pileups ARE foreseeable risks of rear-end collisions

---

### Hypo 4: The Medical Malpractice Follow-Up

**Facts:**
- D negligently injures P in car accident
- P goes to hospital
- Hospital negligently treats P, causing additional injury
- P sues D for both injuries

**Questions:**
1. Is D liable for injuries from the car accident? (Easy)
2. Is D liable for injuries from the medical malpractice?
3. Traditional analysis?
4. Restatement Third analysis?

**Answers:**
1. **Car accident injuries**: YES (straightforward proximate cause)
2. **Medical malpractice injuries**: LIKELY YES
3. **Traditional**: Medical negligence is intervening cause, but IS foreseeable (people seek medical treatment when injured); NOT superseding
4. **Restatement Third**: Risk of negligent medical treatment IS within scope of risks when you injure someone requiring medical care

---

### Hypo 5: Jones v. Roth Variation - What if 1 Month?

**Facts:**
- Same as Jones v. Roth, but only 1 month passes instead of nearly a year

**Questions:**
1. Does time matter?
2. Is 1 month more foreseeable than 11 months?
3. How do you argue each side?

**Plaintiff's Argument:**
- P still recovering from D's negligence
- P's need to use bus/scooter is DIRECT RESULT of D's injury
- P wouldn't have been on bus but for D's negligence
- Medical complications/continued treatment foreseeable

**Defendant's Argument:**
- Bus driver's negligence is superseding cause
- Independent third party's negligence
- Too attenuated even at 1 month

**Likely Result:**
Closer question than at 11 months; might go to jury on foreseeability.

---

## UNTAKEN PRECAUTIONS

### For Berry v. Sugar Notch:

**Precautions NOT Taken:**
1. Motorman didn't slow to comply with 8 mph ordinance
2. Borough may not have trimmed/removed dangerous tree
3. Company may not have enforced speed limits
4. No protective covering on trolley for storm conditions

**Analysis:**
- Slowing down: Would NOT have prevented harm (could have put him there at moment of tree-fall)
- Tree trimming: WOULD have prevented harm if tree was hazard
- Speed enforcement: Same as slowing down
- Storm protection: Possibly, but tree falling not foreseeable risk

**Huang Focus:**
Which untaken precautions are legally required vs. not required based on foreseeability of risks?

---

### For Proximate Cause Generally:

**The Core Question:**
What precautions would have prevented the harm, AND were those precautions required to guard against foreseeable risks?

**If precaution would prevent harm BUT harm was unforeseeable:**
→ Precaution not legally required → No proximate cause

**If precaution would prevent harm AND harm was foreseeable:**
→ Precaution legally required → Proximate cause established

---

## HUANG QUESTION PATTERNS

### Comprehensive Issue-Spotting
**"Is there proximate cause here?"**
→ Check: (1) cause-in-fact first; (2) then foreseeability; (3) then harm-within-the-risk

### Element Focus
**"What's the test for proximate cause?"**
→ Know both: Foreseeability test (traditional) and harm-within-the-risk (both frameworks)

### Variations
**"But what if [change one fact]..."**
→ Analyze how that changes foreseeability or scope of risk

### Frameworks
**"How would the Restatement Third analyze this?"**
→ Use risk language, not causal language; focus on scope of risk created

### Judge vs. Jury
**"Is this a question for the judge or jury?"**
→ Extremes = judge (matter of law); close cases = jury (question of fact)

### Both Sides
**"Argue for the plaintiff. Now argue for the defendant."**
→ Plaintiff emphasizes foreseeability; Defendant emphasizes coincidence, intervening causes

## EXAM SIGNALS

### #EXAM_SIGNAL 1: Two Frameworks Must Be Distinguished
Huang emphasized: Keep traditional "proximate cause" and Restatement Third "scope of liability" **conceptually distinct**. Don't merge vocabularies. On exam, recognize which framework court is using.

### #EXAM_SIGNAL 2: Harm-Within-the-Risk is Key Test
Most important question: Did defendant's negligence increase the risk of the type of harm that occurred? If NO → no proximate cause (like Berry).

### #EXAM_SIGNAL 3: Proximate Cause Is About Negligence, Not Causation
Proximate cause really asks: Was harm to THIS plaintiff foreseeable? It's the "second phase" of negligence analysis, not truly about causation.

### #EXAM_SIGNAL 4: Intervening Causes Analysis
Traditional: Was intervening cause foreseeable? If NO → superseding → no liability.
Restatement Third: Was intervening event within scope of original risk? If NO → outside scope → no liability.

### #EXAM_SIGNAL 5: Judge vs. Jury Distinction
