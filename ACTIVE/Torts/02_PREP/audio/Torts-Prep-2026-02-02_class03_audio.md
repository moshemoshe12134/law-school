# Audio Prep — Class #3 — Implementing Negligence

**Monday, February 2, 2026 | Panel: Bluebird (YOU'RE ON CALL TODAY)**

---

## INTRODUCTION (2 MIN)

You're on Panel Bluebird today for a big implementation class. Monday was about "how careful is careful enough" — the reasonable person standard and its exceptions. Today shifts to "how do courts actually apply that standard?" Three big moves: first, do we use rigid rules or flexible standards? Second, who decides—judge or jury? Third, can courts import structure from outside sources like custom, professional standards, or statutes?

This is one of the most important classes of the semester because it shows how abstract doctrine becomes concrete. Professor Huang will likely push on tensions: rules give certainty but can be over-inclusive or under-inclusive. Standards are flexible but unpredictable. Custom provides community wisdom but whole industries can lag behind best practices. Negligence per se uses legislative judgment but statutes weren't written for tort cases.

The reading covers the classic railroad crossing cases (Goodman and Pokora), Hand's opinion in The T.J. Hooper on custom, malpractice's deference to professional standards, and negligence per se. Expect cold calls on those cases and how they fit together.

## PART 1: RULES VS. STANDARDS (7 MIN)

Let's start with the railroad crossing cases. These are famous because they show the Supreme Court reversing itself in seven years on a fundamental question: should negligence law use bright-line rules or case-by-case standards?

First case: *Baltimore & Ohio Railroad v. Goodman* in 1927. Justice Holmes wrote the opinion. Facts are straightforward: a driver crosses railroad tracks and gets hit by a train. Driver killed. Estate sues railroad for negligence. At trial, there's a question about whether the driver was contributorily negligent—remember from Monday, that's the old rule where any plaintiff negligence bars recovery entirely.

Holmes says the driver absolutely was contributorily negligent. Why? Because the driver didn't stop before the tracks, get out of the car, and look both ways. Holmes announces this as a rule: if a driver can't see clearly whether a train is coming, the driver must stop, get out, and look. Failure to do so is negligent as a matter of law. That means the judge takes the question away from the jury. No reasonable jury could find otherwise.

Holmes's reasoning is that we need certainty in the law. Railroads cross roads all the time. Accidents happen constantly. If every case goes to a jury to decide whether the driver was "reasonably careful," you get inconsistent results and no guidance for future drivers. Better to have a clear rule: stop, get out, look. Everyone knows what they have to do.

But there's an obvious problem with rigid rules: they can't account for variation in circumstances. What if stopping makes you more vulnerable? What if getting out puts you directly in the path of a train? What if you can see better from inside the car? What if the view is blocked by other obstacles, so getting out won't help?

Seven years later, these problems explode the rule. *Pokora v. Wabash Railway* in 1934, Cardozo writing. Very similar facts: driver crosses tracks, gets hit by train. But this time, the view was blocked by a line of boxcars on an adjacent track. Plaintiff drove slowly, looked, listened. Didn't see or hear the train. Crossed and got hit.

Cardozo overrules Goodman. He says—this is the famous line—"Conduct is not to be judged by a rule of thumb." Standards of prudence can't be reduced to a formula. Sometimes stopping and getting out is the right thing to do. Sometimes it's useless or even dangerous. It depends on the specific circumstances: the width of the road, the position of the tracks, the presence of other hazards, the driver's ability to see and hear.

Cardozo says this has to be a jury question. The jury hears all the specific facts and decides whether the plaintiff acted as a reasonable person would have in those exact circumstances. That's what juries are for: applying the community standard to particular situations.

So now we have the tension. Rules provide certainty—everyone knows what to do, you get consistent results, easier to plan behavior. But rules are over-inclusive (catching reasonable behavior) or under-inclusive (missing unreasonable behavior that doesn't fit the formula). Standards are flexible—they adapt to circumstances, they feel fairer in individual cases. But they're unpredictable. You don't know in advance what a jury will say. And different juries reach different results on similar facts.

Professor Huang will almost certainly ask: which approach is better? The answer is "it depends." For behavior that's genuinely invariant—where the same rule makes sense in every case—rules are more efficient. But for fact-specific assessments like negligence, where context matters hugely, standards make more sense. Pokora wins because driving behavior is too varied for a single rule.

## PART 2: CUSTOM (8 MIN)

Next big implementation question: can courts just defer to custom? If an industry has a standard way of doing things, is that automatically reasonable?

The general rule is that custom is evidence of reasonableness, but not conclusive. If you comply with custom, that's some evidence you were reasonable. If you depart from custom, that's evidence you might have been negligent. But juries aren't bound by custom in either direction.

Why not just make custom the rule? Efficiency: the industry has worked out what's cost-effective. Democratic legitimacy: customs emerge from community practice, not judicial imposition. Knowledge: industry insiders know more than judges about their field.

But there are powerful counterarguments. Custom can lag behind best practices—industries resist costly safety improvements. Custom can reflect industry self-interest rather than public safety. And custom doesn't account for unrepresented interests (like accident victims who aren't part of the industry's decision-making).

The most famous case on this is *The T.J. Hooper* from 1932, Learned Hand writing for the Second Circuit. Facts: tugboats are towing barges up the coast. A storm hits. The barges sink. The cargo owners sue the tugboat company for negligence.

Plaintiffs' argument: the tugs should have had radios. With radios, they would have received storm warnings and put into port. The cargo would have been saved.

Defendant's argument: tugboats in 1932 didn't yet carry radios as a matter of industry custom. Most didn't have them. We were following standard practice. How can that be negligent?

Hand says: custom doesn't control. The question is whether the precaution was reasonable, not whether the industry had adopted it yet. Radios existed. They were available. The technology was proven. Storm warnings were being broadcast. The cost of a radio was modest compared to the value of the cargo being towed.

Here's the key line: "A whole calling may have unduly lagged in the adoption of new and available devices." Translation: an entire industry can be negligent. Courts impose an independent duty of reasonable care. They won't let industries set their own standards when those standards are inadequate to protect the public.

This is a huge deal. It means juries can find an entire industry negligent even when everyone in the industry is doing the same thing. You can't defend by saying "everybody does it this way."

But notice the limit: Hand's not saying custom is irrelevant. If radios were experimental or unreliable or wildly expensive, the case would come out differently. The point is that custom isn't a ceiling—it's just a data point. If better precautions are feasible, the defendant should take them even if custom doesn't require it.

In practice, plaintiffs use The T.J. Hooper to argue that custom shouldn't protect defendants. Defense lawyers push back: "This isn't T.J. Hooper—the industry standard here actually is reasonable." It becomes a fight about whether the custom itself meets the negligence standard.

Expect Professor Huang to probe the limits. Is custom ever conclusive? (Maybe for professional malpractice, which we're about to discuss.) What if new technology is only slightly better but much more expensive—does the industry have to adopt it? (Cost-benefit analysis.) What if there are multiple customs—which one counts? (That's evidence that the standard is unsettled, so jury question.)

## PART 3: MALPRACTICE AND NEGLIGENCE PER SE (9 MIN)

Now we get two special contexts where courts do import external standards: professional malpractice and negligence per se.

**Malpractice** is the big exception to the T.J. Hooper principle. For professionals—doctors, lawyers, engineers—courts do defer to professional custom. The rule is that professionals are held to the standard of care "ordinarily possessed and used by members of the profession in good standing."

This is different from general negligence. For ordinary negligence, the jury decides what a reasonable person would do. For malpractice, the profession decides what's reasonable, and the jury just decides whether the defendant met that standard.

Why the deference? Three reasons. First, complexity: juries can't evaluate medical decisions. Was the surgery technique appropriate? Juries don't have the knowledge. Second, professional training: doctors go through rigorous education precisely to learn standards of care. Third, trade-offs: medical decisions involve balancing risks and benefits in ways that aren't obvious to lay people.

In practice, this means expert testimony is required. Plaintiff must present a medical expert who says "the defendant departed from accepted professional standards." Without expert testimony, plaintiff can't survive summary judgment.

There are limits. First, the "locality rule" used to require experts from the same geographic area. That's mostly gone—now it's a national standard. Second, courts increasingly find "common knowledge" exceptions where lay juries can judge without experts (like leaving a sponge in a patient—obviously negligent). Third, informed consent is moving toward a "reasonable practitioner" standard rather than pure professional custom.

Look at the Illinois jury instructions. IPI 105.01 for malpractice says the doctor must exercise the skill "ordinarily possessed" by the profession. But IPI 105.03.01 for informed consent asks whether the doctor disclosed what a "reasonable practitioner" would disclose. That's closer to the general reasonable person standard—it opens the door to jury judgment rather than pure professional deference.

**Negligence per se** is the other big import. Here courts adopt statutory violations as the standard of care. If a statute says "don't do X," and you do X, you're negligent as a matter of law.

Requirements: the defendant violated the statute, the statute was designed to prevent this type of harm, the plaintiff was in the class the statute was meant to protect, and the violation proximately caused the injury.

Why do this? Three reasons. First, legislative judgment: the legislature already balanced costs and benefits when it passed the statute. Courts should defer. Second, clarity: statutes are usually more specific than "reasonable care," so they give better guidance. Third, deterrence: linking tort liability to statutory violations strengthens compliance incentives.

But there are important limits. First, the statute has to be meant to prevent this kind of harm. Classic example from the reading: brake light statute. If your brake light is out and you're stopped at a red light and someone rear-ends you, that's not negligence per se. The statute was meant to prevent collisions while the car is moving, not while it's stopped. Limited statutory purpose defense.

Second, legally cognizable excuses. If compliance was impossible, or if compliance would have been more dangerous, or if the violation was reasonable under the circumstances, the defendant isn't negligent per se. Classic example: crossing a double yellow line to avoid hitting a child. The statute is violated, but the violation was reasonable.

Third, negligence per se is usually a presumption, not an absolute rule. Some jurisdictions say it's just evidence of negligence, and the jury can still decide reasonableness.

In practice, plaintiffs love negligence per se because it shifts the burden to defendant to explain why violating the statute was reasonable. Defendants push back with excuses or argue the statute wasn't meant to cover this situation.

Professor Huang will likely ask about the tension between legislative judgment and tort policy. Should tort law be parasitic on statutes? Legislatures aren't thinking about tort liability when they pass statutes—they're thinking about criminal penalties or regulatory enforcement. Is it fair to use those statutes as tort standards of care?

## PART 4: PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER (4 MIN)

Let's step back and see how these pieces fit.

The core question is: how do we implement the reasonable person standard? That standard is radically flexible—it adapts to circumstances, accounts for context, lets juries make fact-specific judgments.

But radical flexibility creates problems. Unpredictability: people don't know in advance what juries will say. Inconsistency: different juries reach different results. Cost: every case goes to trial because there's no clear rule.

So courts look for ways to add structure. Rules (Goodman) provide certainty but can be over or under-inclusive. Custom (T.J. Hooper) provides industry wisdom but industries can lag. Professional standards (malpractice) defer to expert knowledge but risk being profession-protective. Statutes (negligence per se) import legislative judgment but statutes weren't designed for tort cases.

Each of these is a compromise. Each trades off flexibility for certainty, judicial judgment for external authority, individualized fairness for predictability.

The best answer is probably that we need all of them. For recurring situations with low variance, rules make sense. For professional decisions requiring expertise, deference makes sense. For legislative judgments about dangerous behavior, negligence per se makes sense. And for the residual category—ordinary people doing ordinary things—the flexible reasonable person standard makes sense.

Expect Professor Huang to push on which approach is best in specific contexts. No single answer is right—it's about trade-offs.

## COLD-CALL PREP (4 MIN)

Let me walk through likely cold-call questions.

**On Goodman/Pokora:** "What was the rule in Goodman?" Answer: Stop, get out, look. Negligent as matter of law if you don't. "Why did Cardozo overrule it?" Answer: Rigid rule can't account for circumstances. Sometimes stopping useless or dangerous. "Which approach is better?" Answer: Depends on trade-off. Rules give certainty, standards give flexibility. For driving, context matters too much for a single rule.

**On The T.J. Hooper:** "What was the custom?" Answer: Tugboats didn't yet carry radios in 1932. "Why wasn't that a defense?" Answer: Whole industry can lag. Courts impose independent duty. Custom is evidence, not conclusive. "When might custom be more important?" Answer: For professional standards (malpractice) courts do defer. Difference is jury can't evaluate medical decisions.

**On malpractice:** "Why do courts defer to professional standards?" Answer: Complexity, training, trade-offs. Juries can't judge medical decisions. "What's the difference between IPI 105.01 and 105.03.01?" Answer: 105.01 for malpractice uses "ordinarily possessed" by profession—pure custom. 105.03.01 for informed consent uses "reasonable practitioner"—more like general negligence.

**On negligence per se:** "What are the elements?" Answer: Statute violated, meant to prevent this type of harm, plaintiff in protected class, violation caused injury. "What's the brake light example?" Answer: Statute meant to prevent collisions while moving, not while stopped at red light. Limited statutory purpose. "What are the excuses?" Answer: Compliance impossible, compliance more dangerous, violation reasonable under circumstances.

**On judge vs. jury:** "Who decides if conduct was negligent?" Answer: Usually jury. Judge only takes it away if reasonable minds couldn't differ. "Why did Holmes take it away in Goodman?" Answer: Created a bright-line rule. Failure to stop/get out/look = automatic negligence. "Why did Cardozo give it back in Pokora?" Answer: Context matters. Jury should decide if conduct was reasonable in these specific circumstances.
