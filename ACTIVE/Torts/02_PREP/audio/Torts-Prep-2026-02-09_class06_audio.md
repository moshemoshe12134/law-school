# Audio Prep — Class #6 — Causation-in-Fact: But-For Test, Loss of Chance, and Multiple Sufficient Causes

**Monday, February 9, 2026 | Panel: Goldfinch**

## GETTING ORIENTED

Welcome to Week 4 of Torts. This is a big shift — we're starting a brand new section of the course: CAUSATION. So far we've covered duty, breach, and some warnings. Now we're asking: okay, assuming someone was negligent, did their negligence actually cause the harm? This is causation-in-fact, sometimes called "factual cause." We'll get to proximate cause later, which is different. Don't mix them up.

This week is actually split into two classes. Today (Monday) we're covering the but-for test, the Matsuyama loss of chance doctrine, and multiple sufficient causes. Wednesday (when Bluebirds are on call) will be alternative liability and market share liability — Summers and Hymowitz.

The panel structure flipped this week, by the way. Goldfinches first, then Bluebirds. So if you're a Goldfinch, you're up today.

## THE BIG PICTURE: WHAT IS CAUSATION-IN-FACT?

Causation-in-fact is a set of analytical tools for figuring out which parties can be said to have caused harm. It's a required element for tort liability. The default tool is the but-for test: "But for the defendant's negligence, would the plaintiff's harm have occurred?"

If the answer is no — the harm wouldn't have happened without the defendant's conduct — then causation exists. If the answer is yes — the harm would have happened anyway — then no causation. Simple enough, right?

But here's the thing: the but-for test fails in some situations. And when it fails, courts have developed alternative approaches. That's what today's class is really about: when does but-for fail, and what do we do instead?

Let's go through the three main situations we're covering today.

---

## SITUATION 1: THE BUT-FOR TEST WORKS FINE (MOST CASES)

In standard cases, but-for works perfectly. Driver runs red light, hits pedestrian. But for the driver running the light, would the pedestrian have been injured? No. Causation established. Move on.

The plaintiff has to prove causation by a preponderance of the evidence — more likely than not, greater than 50% probability. This matters in medical cases. If the patient had a 51% chance of survival with timely diagnosis and dies because the doctor missed it, causation exists. But if the patient had a 49% chance? Traditional rule: no recovery. The patient would have probably died anyway. This is the "all or nothing" problem, and it leads us directly to Matsuyama.

---

## SITUATION 2: LOSS OF CHANCE (MATSUYAMA V. BIRNBAUM)

Matsuyama is the marquee case for today. Here's what happened: Mr. Matsuyama had gastric cancer. His doctor, Dr. Birnbaum, treated him for years with over-the-counter medications without ordering proper tests. By the time the cancer was discovered, it was terminal. The evidence showed that if diagnosed earlier, Matsuyama would have had a 37.5% chance of five-year survival at Stage 2.

Traditional but-for test: Would Matsuyama have died anyway? Yes, there was a 62.5% chance he would have died even with timely diagnosis. So under traditional rules, no recovery. The doctor's negligence causes no liability. That seems unjust — the doctor missed a 37.5% chance of survival. That's a real loss.

Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court said: we're going to recognize loss of chance as an INJURY, not a modified causation theory. This is the key move. The injury isn't death — death probably would have happened anyway. The injury is the lost 37.5% chance of survival. That chance has value. The doctor's negligence caused the loss of that chance. The plaintiff still proves causation by a preponderance — she proves that the doctor's negligence more likely than not caused the diminished likelihood.

Once you accept that loss of chance is the injury, damages work proportionally. Full wrongful death damages multiplied by the percentage of chance lost. In Matsuyama, that was $875,000 times 37.5%, equals about $328,000.

A few key points Huang will likely emphasize:

First, this is limited to medical malpractice. The court gave reasons: reliable statistical evidence is available in medicine, there's a special doctor-patient relationship, and it's not unusual for patients to present with less than 50% chance.

Second, this doesn't lower the burden of proof. Plaintiff still must prove by preponderance that the doctor's negligence caused the lost chance.

Third, the policy justifications: fairness (compensating for real loss), deterrence (doctors have incentive to be careful even with sick patients), and avoiding the arbitrary 50% cliff.

Now, you might be thinking: why limit this to medical cases? Could loss of chance apply to other areas? Courts have been cautious, but the reasoning could extend. But for now, it's a medical malpractice doctrine.

## SITUATION 3: MULTIPLE SUFFICIENT CAUSES

Here's the but-for test's other big failure mode. What if two independent causes, each alone sufficient to cause the entire harm, both occur? Classic law school hypo: two fires start near a house. Fire A is negligently set by an arsonist. Fire B is caused by lightning — an act of God, completely non-tortious. Each fire alone would have been sufficient to burn the house. Both fires reach the house simultaneously. The house burns down.

Apply but-for test: But for Fire A, would the house have burned? Yes — Fire B would have done it. So no causation? But for Fire B, would the house have burned? Yes — Fire A would have done it. So neither is a cause? That can't be right.

The solution is the substantial factor test. Each cause that was a substantial factor in bringing about the harm is treated as a factual cause. The arsonist's fire was a substantial factor, so the arsonist is liable. The lightning doesn't create liability because it's non-tortious, but that's a different question — we're asking about the arsonist's liability, not the lightning's.

This is Restatement Third of Torts Section 27. When multiple acts exist, each of which alone would have been a factual cause under the ordinary but-for rule, the harm is treated as caused by each act. The comment explains how this works.

Huang will probably push on a question: what if both fires were negligently set? Two different arsonists, neither knowing about the other. Each fire alone sufficient. Both are substantial factors. Both liable. What about damages? Joint and several liability — each fully liable, plaintiff can collect from either.

Another variation: What if one tortious cause and one non-tortious cause, but the non-tortious one "gets there first"? Fire A would burn the house at 11 AM. Fire B would burn it at 10:30 AM. Fire B actually burns it at 10:30. Fire A never gets there. Is Fire A still liable? This gets trickier. The but-for test still fails — the house would have burned anyway. But was Fire A a substantial factor? Maybe yes, maybe no. This is where Huang might go with hypotheticals.

## FAILURE TO WARN CASES: CAUSATION WITHIN CAUSATION

The readings also mention applying but-for causation to failure to warn cases. This is worth flagging because it comes up a lot. Even if you prove that a warning was inadequate (breach of duty to warn), you still have to prove that an adequate warning would have prevented the harm.

The factors: Would the warning have reached the person at risk? Would they have read it? Would they have understood it? Would they have heeded it — actually changed their behavior? And would that change have prevented the harm?

This is the "heeding" causation inquiry. It's not enough to show inadequate warning. You have to show that a better warning would have made a difference.

## EXPECTED HUANG QUESTIONS

If you're on the Goldfinch panel, here's what Huang might ask:

"What is causation-in-fact and why do we require it?" Have a concise answer: it's the factual link between conduct and harm, required for fairness and corrective justice — we don't hold people liable for things they didn't actually cause.

"How does the but-for test work?" Simple: but for defendant's conduct, would harm have occurred? If no, causation; if yes, no causation.

"When does the but-for test fail?" Three situations: (1) multiple sufficient causes, (2) indeterminate defendant (we know someone in the group caused harm but not who — that's Wednesday's material), and (3) loss of chance when patient had less than 50% chance.

"Is loss of chance a causation theory or an injury theory?" INJURY theory — emphasize this. The injury is the lost chance, not death. Causation still applies, but it's causation of the lost chance.

"Why limit loss of chance to medical malpractice?" Because that's where reliable statistical evidence exists, there's a special professional relationship, and it's common for patients to present with poor prognoses.

"What if one of the multiple sufficient causes is non-tortious?" The tortfeasor is still liable. Their conduct was a substantial factor. The existence of a non-tortious alternative cause doesn't absolve them.

## THINGS TO WATCH FOR

A few cautions based on how Huang teaches:

First, don't confuse causation-in-fact with proximate cause. We're doing causation-in-fact now. Proximate cause comes later — it's about legal limits on liability, not factual causation. Huang will be annoyed if you mix these up.

Second, the loss of chance doctrine is subtle. It's not "we're relaxing causation." It's "we're recognizing a different injury." Make sure you frame it correctly.

Third, pay attention to the Restatement comparisons. Huang wants us to compare Restatement Third Sections 26 and 27 with the Restatement Second approach. The Third Restatement is clearer on substantial factor test for multiple sufficient causes.

Fourth, be ready for hypotheticals about timing in multiple sufficient causes. What if one cause would have happened first? Does that matter? Does "substantial factor" do any work in that case?

## CONNECTING TO LAST CLASS

Last class was about duty — when tort law even applies to a situation. We covered affirmative duties, special relationships, and the baseline question. Today we're assuming duty and breach exist, and asking: did the defendant's negligence actually cause the harm?

But here's a connection: the Kuyler case from last class flagged a causation issue. Even if the hospital had a duty to report (which it didn't, but even if it did), would reporting actually have saved the baby? There was only one month between incidents — would the hotline have investigated that quickly? That's a but-for causation question in a failure-to-warn/failure-to-act context.

## WHAT'S COMING WEDNESDAY

Wednesday is when causation gets really interesting. We'll cover alternative liability (Summers v. Tice) where two hunters shoot and only one bullet hits the plaintiff, but we don't know which hunter fired which bullet. And market share liability (Hymowitz v. Eli Lilly) where DES daughters can't identify which manufacturer produced the DES their mothers took. These are causation problems where but-for fails because we can't identify the actual tortfeasor.

Bluebirds are on call Wednesday. If that's you, you'll want to focus on the burden-shifting mechanics in Summers and the market share calculation in Hymowitz.

## FINAL CHECK-IN

To wrap up, here's what you need to have ready for today:

- The but-for test formula: "But for defendant's negligence, would harm have occurred?"
- Why but-for fails in loss of chance and multiple sufficient causes situations
- Matsuyama holding: loss of chance is injury, not modified causation; damages proportional to chance lost
- Substantial factor test for multiple sufficient causes
- Restatement Third §§ 26, 27, and 36 — at least know what they cover
- Failure to warn causation analysis: heeding, would warning have made a difference?

And remember: causation-in-fact is the factual question. We'll get to proximate cause later. Don't jump ahead.

Good luck today, Goldfinches.
