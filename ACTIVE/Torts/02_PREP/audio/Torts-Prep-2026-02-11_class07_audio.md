# Audio Prep — Class #7 — Alternative Liability and Market Share Liability (Summers, Hymowitz)

**Wednesday, February 11, 2026 | Panel: Bluebird (YOU'RE ON CALL)**

## GETTING ORIENTED

If you're a Bluebird, you're on call today. This is the second causation class, and we're covering two really interesting doctrines that solve the problem when plaintiff can't identify which defendant caused the harm.

Monday we covered but-for causation, loss of chance in Matsuyama, and multiple sufficient causes. Today we go deeper into the identification problem: when we know someone in a group caused harm, but we can't tell who.

Two main doctrines today:
1. **Alternative liability** from Summers v. Tice — small group, burden shifts
2. **Market share liability** from Hymowitz v. Eli Lilly — DES cases, many manufacturers

These look similar at first glance — both deal with unidentified tortfeasors — but they're actually quite different. Knowing the differences is going to be key for today's discussion.

## ALTERNATIVE LIABILITY: SUMMERS V. TICE

Summers is the classic hunting case. Two hunters — Tice and Simonson — go quail hunting with the plaintiff. They all know the basic safety rules. During the hunt, both defendants shoot negligently toward the plaintiff. One pellet hits the plaintiff in the eye, causing serious injury. But here's the problem: the plaintiff can't tell which hunter's pellet hit him.

Under traditional but-for causation, each defendant would say: "But for my conduct, would the plaintiff have been injured? Yes — the other guy would have hit him anyway." So neither is liable, and the plaintiff gets nothing despite clear negligence. That's absurd.

The California Supreme Court said: when two or more defendants act negligently toward plaintiff, only one caused harm, and plaintiff can't tell which one, the burden shifts to EACH defendant to prove they didn't cause the injury. If neither can prove non-causation, both are liable.

**Key Requirements for Alternative Liability:**
One: Small group of defendants — typically 2-3, not hundreds
Two: All acted negligently toward plaintiff
Three: One of them caused the harm (we know it's someone in the group)
Four: Plaintiff cannot determine which one
Five: Defendants are in better position to know (each knows whether they fired the shot that hit)

If these requirements are met, burden shifts. And here's the important part: this is **joint and several liability**. The plaintiff can recover 100% from either defendant. The defendants can sort it out among themselves.

The policy justifications: Both are wrongdoers, both created the risk. Plaintiff is in an impossible position — how can he prove which pellet hit him? Defendants, on the other hand, know whether they caused the injury. It's only fair to shift the burden.

This doctrine comes from Dean Wigmore's idea: "The practical unfairness of denying the injured person redress simply because he cannot prove how much damage each did, when it is certain that between them they did all; let them be the ones to apportion it among themselves."

## MARKET SHARE LIABILITY: HYMOWITZ V. ELI LILLY

Hymowitz is the DES case, and it's a very different problem. DES was a drug given to pregnant women to prevent miscarriages. Turns out it causes cancer in daughters decades later. Here's the problem: about 300 manufacturers produced DES over 24 years. DES was chemically identical — fungible — regardless of manufacturer. Mothers never knew or recorded which brand they took. Fifteen to thirty years later, daughters develop cancer and have no way to identify which manufacturer caused their injury.

Alternative liability doesn't work here. Why? Too many defendants — 300 companies, not 2-3. Twenty-four-year time period, not a single incident. Impossible to join all manufacturers before court. Courts need a different solution.

New York's solution: **market share liability**. Each manufacturer is liable for a proportion of plaintiff's damages equal to its share of the NATIONAL market for DES used during pregnancy.

**Key Features of Market Share Liability:**

First: **National market** — not local or regional. This is administrable; the same calculation works for all plaintiffs. It avoids case-by-case market assessment battles.

Second: **Several liability only** — not joint and several. Each manufacturer pays only ITS percentage. If plaintiff sues manufacturers representing 45% of the market, plaintiff recovers 45% of damages. Plaintiff bears the risk of not suing everyone. This is a HUGE difference from Summers.

Third: **No exculpation** — a manufacturer cannot escape liability by proving it didn't cause THIS plaintiff's injury. Even if a manufacturer proves plaintiff's mother couldn't have taken their brand, they're still liable for their market share. Liability is based on overall risk created to the public, not specific causation.

Fourth: Limited to manufacturers who marketed DES for pregnancy use. If you never marketed for pregnancy, you're not liable.

The formula is simple: Plaintiff's total damages multiplied by defendant's market share percentage equals defendant's liability. For example, million dollars in damages times 20% market share equals two hundred thousand dollars liability.

The rationale: Based on risk contribution, not causation in a single case. "Liability is based on the over-all risk produced, and not causation in a single case." Manufacturers created the risk; they should bear the cost of the uncertainty they created.

## COMPARING THE DOCTRINES

This is where Huang will probably push you. The differences matter:

**Number of defendants**: Summers has 2-3 defendants; Hymowitz has hundreds.

**Time period**: Summers is a single incident; Hymowitz spans 24 years.

**All defendants before court**: In Summers, yes (or realistically possible to join them); in Hymowitz, no — impossible to join all 300 manufacturers.

**Burden shifting**: In Summers, yes — burden shifts to defendants to prove non-causation. In Hymowitz, no — there's no burden shift on causation; liability is based on market share.

**Liability type**: Summers is joint and several — plaintiff recovers 100%. Hymowitz is several only — plaintiff recovers percentage of market sued.

**Can plaintiff recover 100%?**: In Summers, yes. In Hymowitz, no — only the percentage of market actually sued.

**Based on**: Summers is based on presumed causation (one of them did it). Hymowitz is based on risk contribution or overall culpability.

**Can exculpate?**: In Summers, yes — a defendant can prove they didn't cause the injury. In Hymowitz, no — even proving you didn't cause THIS injury doesn't escape liability.

These differences are exam-worthy. You need to be able to spot which doctrine applies based on the facts.

## WHEN DOCTRINES APPLY AND DON'T APPLY

**Alternative Liability Applies When:**
Small group (typically 2-3), all acted negligently toward plaintiff, single incident, plaintiff genuinely cannot identify which defendant caused harm, all defendants before court or realistically joinable.

**Alternative Liability Does NOT Apply When:**
Many defendants, extended time period, defendants not all before court, plaintiff can identify the tortfeasor, defendants not all negligent.

**Market Share Liability Applies When:**
Many manufacturers (hundreds), fungible product (chemically identical), extended time period, genuinely impossible to identify manufacturer, mass tort context requiring uniform solution.

**Market Share Liability Does NOT Apply When:**
Product not fungible (different by manufacturer), identification possible with investigation, can identify specific manufacturer, small number of defendants.

Most courts refuse to extend market share beyond DES. Asbestos, lead paint, vaccines — courts say no. The DES situation is unique: fungible product, many manufacturers, long latency, no records, mass tort.

## COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE VS. COMPARATIVE CAUSATION

The readings also ask us to think about comparative negligence versus comparative causation. This is more theoretical, but Huang might explore it.

Traditional comparative negligence: Reduce plaintiff's recovery based on plaintiff's FAULT. Example: plaintiff 30% at fault, recovery reduced 30%. Focus is on blameworthiness.

Comparative causation: Reduce recovery based on plaintiff's CONTRIBUTION to causation, regardless of fault. Example: plaintiff's conduct 40% of causal factors, liable for 40%. Focus is on causal role.

The question: Which better serves tort law goals? Compensation? Deterrence? Corrective justice? Fairness?

Summers and Hymowitz already do something like comparative causation — they apportion liability based on causal contribution or market share rather than all-or-nothing fault. Should this approach extend more broadly? That's the policy question Huang might ask.

## EXPECTED HUANG QUESTIONS

If you're on the Bluebird panel and get called, here's what Huang might ask:

"What's the difference between alternative liability and market share liability?" Have that comparison ready. It's all about the differences: small group vs. many defendants, joint and several vs. several only, burden shifting vs. no burden shift.

"Why does Summers use joint and several liability but Hymowitz uses several liability?" Because in Summers, small group, all before court, all negligent — fair to make each fully liable, they can sort it out. In Hymowitz, 300 manufacturers, if joint and several, any tiny manufacturer could be on hook for 100% despite small role — that's unfair.

"What is the 'no exculpation' rule in market share liability?" Defendant cannot escape liability by proving it didn't cause THIS plaintiff's injury. Liability based on overall risk and market participation, not specific causation. Rationale: would be impossible for plaintiffs to prove negatives; would undermine administrability.

"When should alternative liability apply versus traditional rules?" Check the requirements: small group, all negligent, single incident, plaintiff can't identify, all before court. If these are met, alternative liability. If not, traditional rules or no recovery.

"Why is market share liability limited to DES?" Fungible product is rare. Most products differ by manufacturer. Identification usually possible with investigation. DES created unique mass tort problem requiring uniform solution.

## THINGS TO WATCH FOR

A few cautions:

First, don't confuse alternative liability with multiple sufficient causes from Monday. In multiple sufficient causes, BOTH fires actually contributed to burning the house. In alternative liability, only ONE defendant caused harm — we just don't know which one. Different factual pattern, different doctrine.

Second, remember that no exculpation in market share is controversial. There was a partial dissent in Hymowitz on this point. But the majority rule is no exculpation, and most courts follow this approach.

Third, be ready for hypotheticals about whether market share should extend to other products. Courts almost always say no — brake pads, vaccines, asbestos, lead paint. The DES situation is uniquely suited to market share.

Fourth, the comparative causation discussion is more theoretical. If Huang asks about it, think about whether liability should track fault or causal contribution. Both approaches have arguments.

## CONNECTING TO PREVIOUS CLASSES

We've been building causation piece by piece. Monday: but-for test, loss of chance, multiple sufficient causes. Today: alternative liability, market share liability. All of these address situations where traditional but-for causation fails.

The common theme: courts want to avoid unfair outcomes where plaintiff is clearly injured by someone's negligence but formal causation rules deny recovery. Each doctrine solves a different type of causation problem.

Also note the connection to duty from last week. Before we even get to causation, we need duty. These doctrines assume duty and breach exist — they're just solving the causation puzzle.

---

## WHAT'S COMING NEXT

After causation-in-fact, we'll move to proximate cause — the legal limits on liability. That's a different question. Causation-in-fact asks: did defendant's conduct actually cause the harm? Proximate cause asks: even if defendant caused the harm, is liability limited for policy reasons? We'll see that proximate cause does some similar work to duty — cutting off liability for fairness reasons — but juries often decide proximate cause rather than judges.

## FINAL CHECK-IN

To wrap up, here's what you need to have ready for today:

- The requirements for alternative liability (Summers): small group, all negligent, single incident, can't identify which, all before court
- The mechanics of burden shifting in Summers: each defendant must prove they didn't cause injury
- Joint and several liability in Summers: plaintiff recovers 100% from any defendant
- The requirements for market share liability (Hymowitz): many manufacturers, fungible product, extended period, impossible identification
- National market, several liability only, no exculpation in Hymowitz
- Market share calculation formula: damages times market share percentage
- The key differences between Summers and Hymowitz
- Policy arguments for and against each doctrine
- Comparative negligence vs. comparative causation (at least the concept)

And if you're called on, start with the 60-second framing, then be ready to apply the doctrines to hypotheticals and explain the policy reasoning.

Good luck today, Bluebirds.
