# Audio Prep — Class #2 — The Reasonable Person Standard

**Audio length: ~28 minutes | Listen before class on Wednesday, January 28, 2026**

**Panel: Bluebird (YOU'RE ON CALL TODAY)**

---

## INTRO (2 minutes)

Welcome to class prep for Monday's Torts class. You're on call today with Panel Bluebird, so let's make sure you're ready. Last week Professor Huang introduced negligence through Adams v. Bullock—that case with the boy swinging a wire into the trolley's electrical system. We learned that negligence has four elements: duty, breach, causation, and damages. The big question was whether the trolley company breached its duty by not better insulating its wires.

Today we're diving deeper into that second element—breach. Specifically: **how careful is careful enough?** What's the standard we use to judge whether someone's conduct was negligent? This is the **reasonable person standard**, and it's the backbone of all negligence law.

By the end of this prep, you'll understand three big things:
1. **What the reasonable person standard actually means** and why it's objective, not subjective
2. **When the law makes exceptions** for children and people with disabilities
3. **What happens when the plaintiff was also careless**—the move from contributory to comparative negligence

This is foundational stuff. Every negligence case you see will turn on whether someone met the reasonable person standard. Let's dig in.

---

## PART 1: The Reasonable Person Standard (7 minutes)

### The Core Idea

The reasonable person standard says: You're negligent if you fail to exercise the care that a reasonably prudent person would exercise under similar circumstances.

Note what this **doesn't** say. It doesn't ask, "Did YOU do your best given your abilities?" It doesn't ask, "Did you act with good intentions?" It asks: "Would a reasonable person have acted differently?"

This is an **objective standard**. You're not measured against your own capacity. You're measured against a hypothetical person—the reasonable person—who represents the minimum level of care society expects.

### Why Objective?

Why not ask what this specific defendant was capable of? Three reasons.

First, **incentive effects**. If we let people off the hook by saying "I'm just not that smart" or "I'm not good at judging risks," there's no pressure to improve. The objective standard pushes everyone to meet a minimum threshold.

Second, **fairness to victims**. Why should an injury victim bear the cost just because the person who hurt them happens to be less careful or less intelligent than average? The victim didn't choose the injurer.

Third, **verification problems**. How would we ever measure someone's subjective capacity? People would claim they lack judgment, they're impulsive, they can't help it. Courts can't reliably distinguish genuine incapacity from convenient excuses. The objective standard sidesteps this mess.

### The Famous Haystack Case

The classic illustration is *Vaughan v. Menlove* from the 19th century. Menlove built a hayrick near his neighbor's property. Neighbors warned him it might spontaneously combust—hay does that when stacked wrong. Menlove basically said "eh, I'll take my chances." It caught fire and burned down the neighbor's cottages.

At trial, Menlove's lawyers argued he shouldn't be held negligent because he didn't have "the highest order of intelligence." The court said: Irrelevant. The question isn't whether you personally have good judgment. It's whether you acted as a reasonable person would.

### But Still Contextual

Now, "objective" doesn't mean "rigid." The standard is the reasonable person **under similar circumstances**. So context matters:

- **Time to react:** A reasonable person surprised by a suddenly darting child has less time to react than someone watching kids play near a street.
- **Emergency:** If you're facing a sudden crisis—a car swerves toward you—courts apply the "emergency doctrine." You're judged against how a reasonable person would react in that split second, not with the luxury of hindsight.
- **Information:** What did you know or should you have known? The reasonable person is expected to know what's generally knowable, but not to predict the unpredictable.

This is where **foreseeability** comes in. You can't be negligent for failing to guard against risks you couldn't have foreseen. The old case *Blyth v. Birmingham Waterworks* involved a record-breaking freeze that burst underground pipes. The court said the risk was so improbable—"penetrated to a greater depth than any which ordinarily occurs south of the polar regions"—that a reasonable person needn't have anticipated it.

But be careful: Today, almost nothing related to weather is truly unforeseeable. We talk about 100-year floods, even 1000-year floods. They're rare, but we know they happen. The key is whether the risk was probable enough that a reasonable person should account for it.

### Quick Hypo

Here's one you might get called on. Defendant has epilepsy, but hasn't had a seizure in five years. Doctor said "probably safe to drive, but there's always some risk." Defendant drives, has an unexpected seizure, kills a pedestrian. Negligent?

This is tricky. You could frame it narrowly: the seizure itself was involuntary and unforeseeable—no negligence. Or broadly: driving with *any* seizure history is a knowing risk—negligent. Unlike a case where the driver knows they have frequent, uncontrolled seizures (clear negligence), this is a genuine judgment call. Reasonable minds could disagree. That's where the standard gets slippery, and Huang might push you on it.

## PART 2: Exceptions for Children and the Infirm (8 minutes)

### Why Have Exceptions?

If the reasonable person standard is objective, why make exceptions? Because taken to an extreme, the objective standard would be absurd. You can't hold a five-year-old to the same standard as an adult. A blind person literally can't see a warning sign. The law recognizes that pure objectivity has limits.

But notice: The exceptions are **narrow** and **carefully tailored**. The law doesn't abandon objectivity; it adjusts it where necessary.

### Children: A Semi-Objective Standard

Children below about age five can't be negligent at all. They're presumed incapable of exercising care.

Above age five, the rule is: A child is held to the standard of a **child of similar age, intelligence, and experience**. This is "semi-objective"—you're not measuring the child against adults, but you're also not letting them off because "this particular kid is reckless." You're asking: What would a reasonably careful child of this age group do?

So if an eight-year-old on a skateboard hits a pedestrian, you ask: Did this kid exercise the care of a reasonably careful eight-year-old? Not an adult, not a toddler—an eight-year-old.

### The Adult Activity Exception

But here's the kicker: **When a child engages in a dangerous adult activity, they're held to an adult standard.**

Dangerous adult activities include driving, flying airplanes, operating motorboats. If a 15-year-old drives a car and crashes, they don't get the child standard. They're judged as an adult driver.

Why? Three reasons:

First, **victims can't tell**. If you're crossing the street and a car is coming, you have no way to know whether the driver is 16 or 40. You can't exercise extra self-protective care. When a kid is on a skateboard, you can see they're a kid and give them wider berth. Not so with drivers.

Second, **no social benefit**. There's a social benefit to letting kids play, ride bikes, learn by doing. There's no benefit to letting kids drive if they can't meet adult standards. If you can't drive as well as a reasonably careful adult, you shouldn't be driving.

Third, **insurance**. Post-World War II, homeowner's and auto insurance became widespread. Kids are often covered under their parents' policies. That makes them judgment-proof-collectible, so imposing liability isn't pointless.

Quick hypo: A 12-year-old takes their parent's car for a joyride and crashes into another vehicle. What standard? Adult. Driving is a dangerous adult activity. The 12-year-old is held to the standard of a reasonably prudent adult driver.

### Infirm Adults: Physical vs. Mental

Now, what about adults with disabilities? The law draws a sharp line between **physical** and **mental** infirmities.

**Physical disabilities:** Semi-objective standard, like children. A blind person is judged against a reasonably careful blind person. The jury considers the disability. If a blind person can't read a "No Smoking" sign and starts a fire, the jury takes that into account.

But—and this is critical—it cuts both ways. A blind person shouldn't be driving. A person in a wheelchair should be more cautious crossing streets. The reasonable blind person or wheelchair user takes extra precautions *because* of their limitations.

**Mental disabilities:** Objective standard. Even insane people are held liable for their torts.

Why the difference? Mental infirmities are **invisible, hard to measure, and difficult to verify**. In the 19th century when these rules developed, psychiatric diagnosis was a mess. Even today, it's dicey. How do you distinguish genuine delusion from someone just claiming "I wasn't thinking straight"?

Moreover, people with serious mental illness often have lucid periods. During those periods, it may be negligent not to take steps to prevent harm during future episodes. The famous case is *Breunig v. American Family Insurance Co.* The defendant sometimes thought she could fly "because Batman does it." She had prior episodes, so she should have known to avoid driving. During a lucid period, failing to take that precaution was negligent.

Finally, many people with mental illness are capable of being careful. Just because I think I'm Napoleon doesn't mean I don't know to stop at red lights. And they often have guardians with an incentive to monitor their behavior—an incentive that disappears if the mentally ill aren't liable.

This distinction can feel uncomfortable, especially as attitudes toward disability have evolved. Courts today might be more sympathetic. But the doctrinal rule remains: physical disabilities are considered, mental ones aren't.

## PART 3: Contributory vs. Comparative Negligence (9 minutes)

### The Old Rule: Contributory Negligence

For most of American legal history, the rule was brutal: **If the plaintiff was also negligent—even slightly—they recovered nothing.** This is **contributory negligence as a complete bar**.

The logic seemed obvious to 19th-century courts. If both parties were at fault, why should the defendant bear all the loss? *Butterfield v. Forrester*, an old English case, just took it as self-evident that a negligent plaintiff couldn't recover from a negligent defendant.

But think about how harsh that is. Plaintiff is 10% at fault, defendant 90%. Plaintiff suffers $100,000 in injuries. Under contributory negligence, plaintiff gets **zero**. Even though the defendant was much more at fault, the plaintiff's slight carelessness wipes out the entire claim.

This led to predictable results. Juries hated the rule. They'd often find the plaintiff wasn't negligent at all, even when they clearly were, just to avoid the unfair outcome. Or they'd "compromise"—find the defendant wasn't negligent, splitting the difference informally.

By the 1970s, the system was unsustainable.

### The Revolution: Comparative Negligence

Starting in the 1970s, state after state abandoned contributory negligence and adopted **comparative negligence**. Now, the plaintiff's negligence doesn't bar recovery—it **reduces** recovery proportionally.

Here's how it works. The jury finds the plaintiff suffered $100,000 in damages. The jury also decides: Who was more at fault? Say the plaintiff was 40% negligent, the defendant 60%. Under comparative negligence, the plaintiff recovers 60% of their damages—$60,000. The plaintiff's recovery is reduced by their share of fault.

Comparative negligence comes in two flavors: **pure** and **modified**.

### Pure Comparative Negligence

Under **pure** comparative negligence, the plaintiff recovers something **no matter how negligent they were**, as long as they're not 100% at fault. Thirteen states use this approach.

So even if the plaintiff was 90% at fault and the defendant only 10%, the plaintiff still recovers 10%. Seems weird, right? But the logic is: The defendant *was* negligent. The defendant *did* cause part of the harm. Why should the defendant get a windfall just because the plaintiff was even more careless?

### Modified Comparative Negligence

Most states—33 of them—use **modified** comparative negligence. Under this version, if the plaintiff is **more negligent than the defendant**, the plaintiff is completely barred from recovery.

There are two versions of modified:

1. **"Not greater than":** Plaintiff can recover as long as they're not MORE negligent than defendant. So at a 50/50 split, plaintiff still recovers (50% of damages).

2. **"Not as great as":** Plaintiff can recover only if LESS negligent than defendant. At 50/50, plaintiff is barred.

This makes the jury's percentage findings incredibly high-stakes. If the jury finds the plaintiff 51% at fault and defendant 49%, the plaintiff gets nothing under modified comparative negligence. Change that to 49% plaintiff, 51% defendant, and suddenly the plaintiff recovers $49,000 (on $100,000 in damages).

Huang might ask: Does the jury know about this? In most states, yes—the jury is instructed on how comparative negligence works. So juries can "adjust" their findings to avoid unfairness. But in a few states, the jury is "blindfolded"—they just return percentage findings, and the judge applies the rule. In those states, a 1% difference can mean everything.

### What's Being Compared?

Here's a conceptual wrinkle: We're comparing **negligence**, not causation.

Negligence is about **probability of harm** and **degree of unreasonableness**. Causation is about what actually happened in this case. The law says: Compare how unreasonable each party's conduct was, considering the foreseeable likelihood and severity of harm.

But this gets messy fast. How do you compare a speeding driver (going 90 in a 30 zone) with a pedestrian who jaywalked across that same road? They're different kinds of negligence. How do you allocate percentages?

Or what if the plaintiff negligently failed to trim a tree on their property, and the defendant negligently sped past the tree, didn't see the stop sign it obscured, and crashed into the plaintiff? You're comparing a property maintenance failure with a traffic violation. Apples and oranges.

The law doesn't give clear guidance. It just says: Jury, you figure it out. Allocate 100% between the parties.

### Quick Hypos

**Hypo 1:** Plaintiff 40% at fault, defendant 60%. Damages $100k.
- Pure comparative: Plaintiff recovers $60k.
- Modified (either version): Plaintiff recovers $60k. (Plaintiff is less than 50%, so not barred.)

**Hypo 2:** Plaintiff 51% at fault, defendant 49%. Damages $100k.
- Pure comparative: Plaintiff recovers $49k.
- Modified (either version): Plaintiff barred, recovers nothing.

See the stakes? One percentage point decides whether you get $49,000 or zero.

### Where Are We Now?

Only four states—Alabama, Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia—plus DC still use pure contributory negligence. Everywhere else has moved to comparative negligence in some form.

This shift happened mostly by statute, though some states did it by judicial decision. It's one of the most dramatic reforms in modern tort law, and it fundamentally changed how negligence cases are tried. Juries now have to make fine-grained percentage allocations. Lawyers argue over single percentage points.

## PART 4: Restatement (Third) and Jury Instructions (3 minutes)

### Restatement (Third) § 3

The Restatement Third of Torts codifies the negligence standard in Section 3:

> "A person acts negligently if the person does not exercise reasonable care under all the circumstances. Primary factors to consider in ascertaining whether the person's conduct lacks reasonable care are the foreseeable likelihood that the person's conduct will result in harm, the foreseeable severity of any harm that may ensue, and the burden of precautions to eliminate or reduce the risk of harm."

This is basically the **negligence calculus**, which we'll talk more about on Wednesday. But the key point: Negligence is a balancing test. You weigh the likelihood of harm (P), the severity of harm (L), and the burden of taking precautions (B). If the burden of precautions is less than the expected harm (B < PL), you were negligent for not taking them.

### Illinois Jury Instructions

Huang gave you the Illinois jury instructions. Let's look at the key one on negligence:

> "When I use the expression 'negligence,' I mean the failure to do something which a reasonably careful person would do or the doing of something which a reasonably careful person would not do under circumstances similar to those shown by the evidence. **The law does not say how a reasonably careful person would act under those circumstances. That is for you to decide.**"

See that last sentence? The judge doesn't tell the jury what the reasonable person would do. The jury decides. This gives juries enormous discretion. It also means lawyers can't just cite a rule and win. You have to persuade the jury that your client acted reasonably (or the other side didn't).

On comparative negligence, the instruction says:

> "If you decide that [plaintiff] and [defendant] are both negligent, you must then determine the percentage of the total negligence of all persons that is attributable to each of them. The percentages you find must total 100%."

Short and sweet. You're dividing a pie. It has to add up to 100.

For minors:

> "When I use the expression 'ordinary care' [for a minor], I mean the degree of care which a reasonably careful [child/person] of the same age, mental capacity, and experience as [minor's name] would use under circumstances similar to those shown by the evidence."

So for kids, age, mental capacity, and experience are explicitly part of the standard.

## COLD CALL PREP (5 minutes)

Huang likes to ask: "What's the rule? What's the reason? What about this hypo?" Let's prep for that.

### If Called On: Reasonable Person Standard

**Question:** "What's the standard for negligence?"

**Answer:** "The reasonable person standard. Conduct is negligent if it falls below what a reasonably prudent person would do under similar circumstances. It's an objective standard—defendant's measured against a hypothetical reasonable person, not their own subjective capacity."

**Likely Follow-Up:** "Why not ask what THIS defendant was capable of?"

**Answer:** "Three reasons: First, incentive effects—objective standard encourages people to meet a minimum threshold. Second, fairness to victims—they didn't choose a careless injurer. Third, verification problems—hard to measure someone's actual capacity, risk of false claims."

**Curveball:** "What about someone who's just terrible at making decisions?"

**Answer:** "Still the objective standard. If you can't meet the reasonable person standard, you probably shouldn't be engaging in that activity. Like a blind person shouldn't drive—the disability is considered, but it cuts both ways."

### If Called On: Children

**Question:** "How do we judge children?"

**Answer:** "Generally, semi-objective. A child is held to the standard of a child of similar age, intelligence, and experience. So an eight-year-old is measured against other reasonably careful eight-year-olds."

**Follow-Up:** "What if the child is driving?"

**Answer:** "Adult standard. When a child engages in a dangerous adult activity—driving, flying a plane—they're held to an adult standard. Victims can't tell the driver is a child, so no extra self-protective care is possible. Also, no social benefit to letting kids drive if they can't meet adult standards."

### If Called On: Contributory vs. Comparative

**Question:** "What if the plaintiff was also careless?"

**Answer:** "Under the old rule—contributory negligence—plaintiff was completely barred from recovery, even if only slightly at fault. Now most states use comparative negligence, where plaintiff's recovery is reduced by their percentage of fault."

**Follow-Up:** "What's the difference between pure and modified?"

**Answer:** "Pure comparative negligence: plaintiff can always recover something, even if 90% at fault. Modified: plaintiff barred if more negligent than defendant. Thirteen states have pure, 33 have modified."

**Curveball:** "Plaintiff 51% at fault, defendant 49%. What happens?"

**Answer:** "Under pure comparative, plaintiff recovers 49% of damages. Under modified, plaintiff gets nothing—barred because more negligent than defendant. That's why jury percentage findings are so high-stakes in modified states."

### If Huang Asks About Goss v. Allen or Parks & Recreation

These are cases from the packet. He said to focus on the facts and use them as fact patterns for argumentation practice. If you haven't read them yet, be honest: "I focused on the doctrinal materials first, but I can work through the facts now if you'd like." Then be ready to apply the reasonable person standard to whatever facts he gives you.

The key is: **Don't just recite rules. Make arguments.** If he gives you facts, argue both sides. Plaintiff: "Defendant fell below reasonable person standard because X." Defendant: "No, reasonable person would have acted the same way because Y." That's what Huang wants to see—lawyering skills, not memorization.

---

## 60-SECOND RECAP (1 minute)

If you remember nothing else, remember this:

1. **Reasonable person standard is objective:** You're judged against a hypothetical reasonable person, not your own capacity. Exceptions: children (semi-objective) and physical infirmities (considered by jury), but **not** mental infirmities.

2. **Children get child standard UNLESS engaging in dangerous adult activities** like driving—then adult standard applies.

3. **Contributory vs. comparative negligence:** Contributory (old rule) = complete bar if plaintiff at all negligent. Comparative (modern rule) = plaintiff's recovery reduced by their percentage of fault. Pure comparative (13 states) = always some recovery. Modified (33 states) = barred if plaintiff more negligent than defendant.

4. **The core question:** How careful is careful enough? It depends on all the circumstances—likelihood of harm, severity, burden of precautions. The jury decides.

---

## CLOSING (1 minute)

You're ready for class. You know the reasonable person standard, the exceptions, and the shift from contributory to comparative negligence. When Huang asks you to apply this to Goss v. Allen or Parks & Recreation, you'll frame it: "A reasonable person in these circumstances would have done X. Defendant didn't. That's negligence." Or: "Defendant acted as a reasonable person would—there was no safer alternative given the circumstances."

Practice both sides. That's the skill Huang is teaching—not just knowing the doctrine, but wielding it in argument.

You're on call with Bluebird today, but you've got this. Go make strong arguments, and remember: every negligence case turns on whether someone met this standard. This is the foundation.

Good luck.
