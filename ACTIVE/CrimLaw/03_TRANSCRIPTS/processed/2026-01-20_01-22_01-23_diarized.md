**Conversation**
- Professor: It’s very full; I could only reserve three seats because every other seat was taken.
- Charles: Hi, I’m Charles; I have an interview at noon and may need to step out a few minutes early.
- Professor: That’s fine; good to see you all; I could only reserve three seats given 125 students; we’ll figure out meeting times.
- Professor: Welcome to criminal law; I’m Bernard Harcourt, your professor; we have four TAs—Dana, Maher, Courtney, Amitov.
- Professor: Criminal law is the most consequential foundational course because politics and morality are hidden yet influential.
- Professor: Property law structures inequality; contract law often serves those with power; those are visible effects.
- Professor: We overlook how criminal law shapes social order; we naturalize it as merely responding to crime.
- Professor: There’s a disjuncture between crime and punishment; punishment structures power relations—race, gender, class.
- Professor: Black Lives Matter highlighted that criminal law does more than respond to crime; discussions on abolition emerged but faded.
- Professor: To see how criminal law entrenches power, look to Reconstruction; W.E.B. Du Bois shows criminal law replaced property law to impose racial hierarchy.
- Professor: Example—1866 advertisement selling Richard Harris’s labor after conviction; criminal law reconstituted racial order when property law couldn’t.
- Professor: Thirteenth Amendment permits involuntary servitude as punishment; exception enables convict leasing.
- Professor: Alabama 1905 convention used felon disenfranchisement to secure white supremacy; chose crimes to target Black voters.
- Professor: Convict leasing recreated plantations; Angola prison today remains a plantation prison of 28 square miles.
- Professor: Du Bois wrote that the criminal system kept Black people working; patterns continue today (e.g., Plata overcrowding photos).
- Professor: U.S. incarceration exploded from 1973 to 2008 to 2.3 million; about 2 million currently incarcerated; 6–7 million under supervision.
- Professor: Including family networks, 65+ million people are affected; U.S. is exceptional and racialized (mostly young Black or Hispanic men).
- Professor: Prison population shifted from two-thirds white in 1920s to two-thirds non-white today; disparities stark.
- Professor: Incarceration rates per 100,000: overall ~229; African American ~1,200; disparities worsen for young men with no HS diploma (69% risk by age 30–34).
- Professor: Criminal law is the mechanism that innocently creates social order; think how cases produce disparities.
- Professor: Be ready to answer criminal law questions; learn cases and context; watch arraignments to see parade of poor, mostly young Black men.
- Professor: Encourages students to visit prisons or arraignments; asks who has been inside a prison.
- Student A: Worked at DA’s office; arraignments are fast-paced in criminal court; most defendants young Black men.
- Professor: That matches what you see—poor, often homeless young Black men shuffling through.
- Student B: Visited uncle who served 35 years at Green Haven Correctional Facility.
- Professor: Thanks; asks other students to share prison experiences; notes facilities can be harrowing (suicide watch cells, cages, therapy in cages).
- Student C: Worked in jails (Rikers, Broome County); ran jail visitation; worked at Bronx Defenders; visited incarcerated people and got property.
- Professor: Notes conditions; shows suicide watch cells, therapy cages; even California’s better-funded system is harsh; other states worse.
- Professor: Criminal law consequences are harrowing; must see how pieces fit—language, arguments, reading cases—to grasp reality.
- Professor: Building blocks are simple: mens rea and actus reus; we’ll start fast with these this week.
- Professor: Justice lens—asked students to read *Just Mercy* to think about justice; today discuss book and define justice.
- Professor: Calls on Sylvie to share most unjust moment in *Just Mercy*.
- Isabelle: Botched execution in prologue felt unjust; putting Walter McMillan on death row pre-conviction felt unjust.
- Professor: Notes pretrial death row placement unimaginable; execution method must meet Eighth Amendment; justice applies even after conviction.
- Aaliyah: Thinks about dehumanization of incarcerated people; even executions should avoid barbarity.
- Professor: Dehumanization as core injustice echoes Kant—treat people as ends, not means; mentions nitrogen gas executions case (David Wilson).
- Professor: Argues execution method must be instantaneous; historical methods aimed at instant death; nitrogen gas causes air hunger.
- Professor: Justice debate: is death penalty just; even if so, method must avoid torture.
- Nicole: References Stevenson’s line “opposite of poverty is justice”; measure society by treatment of poor, disfavored, incarcerated.
- Professor: That mirrors idea of weakest link revealing society; asks if tied to specific unjust moment.
- Nicole: Ignoring alibi and coercing conviction in McMillan case was unjust; mercy belongs to undeserving to break victimization cycle; give second chances.
- Professor: Asks who are “undeserving”; Nicole: those needing second chance; justice can’t be pure retribution.
- Ming Ziang: Prosecutors leveraged death-row inmates for false testimony; used McMillan to enforce racial hierarchy; raises question about insulating prosecution from community pressure.
- Professor: Raises justice vs democracy tension; heinous crimes may distort community demands.
- Professor: Asks students to write one-sentence justice definition; will revisit in cases.
- Maddie: Justice involves equal treatment despite uncertainty; mercy should look same even when guilt unknown.
- Charles: Justice is ability to be heard; Ian (sentenced at 13, 23 years in solitary) wanted his story heard.
- Professor: Ian will visit; urges students to keep justice sentence; views justice as resisting arbitrary power.
- Professor: Quick roadmap of criminal process (arraignment, grand jury, motions, trial, sentencing, appeals) using Walter McMillan case as example.
- Professor: Explains Alabama judicial override (judge overrode unanimous life verdict to death) now abolished.
- Professor: Notes academic freedom; trigger warning—cases involve violence; class debates openly; no AI use for case digestion.
- Professor: Syllabus notes 3 Friday makeups for longer spring break; AI not helpful; class continues Thursday.
- Student question: Office hours conflict with Property class (Thu 2:50–4:40); professor acknowledges.

## 2026-01-22 (Criminal Law-transcript-01-22.txt)

**Speaker map**
- Professor = Bernard Harcourt (SPEAKER 0)
- TA/Tech helper (SPEAKER 1)

**Conversation**
- TA: Greets class; notes technical difficulty with PC; system now working.
- Professor: Confirms system works; jokes it’s too warm; starts class.
- Professor: Today covers elements of criminal law; syllabus frames course—read it.
- Professor: Notes U.S. criminal law is largely codified (civil-law-like) even though U.S. is common law; states use penal codes influenced by Model Penal Code (MPC).
- Professor: Explains Napoleonic Code longevity; Louisiana influenced by French code; most U.S. states follow British common law roots but codified statutes; bar exam still teaches “common law murder/manslaughter” though mostly fiction.
- Professor: Criminal law has no common law crimes (98% true); must violate statute.
- Professor: MPC created by ALI as model; many states adopted with tweaks; class will compare statutes to MPC as foil.
- Professor: Elements of crime matter because prosecution must prove each beyond reasonable doubt; analogous to tort elements.
- Professor: Crimes may have act requirement (actus reus), mental state (mens rea), and attendant circumstances (e.g., victim under 18).
- Professor: Act must be voluntary; traces to Blackstone and Roman law: “actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea.”
- Professor: Blackstone: need both act and vicious will; no punishment for mere bad thoughts; involuntary acts (reflexes, etc.) not blameworthy.
- Professor: Introduces first case Martin v. State (Alabama public intoxication statute requiring appearing in public and manifesting drunkenness by boisterous/indecent conduct or loud/profane discourse).
- Professor: Statute demands act (appear in public, manifest boisterousness) plus mental state; Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals held appearance was involuntary because police dragged Martin from home.
- Student (Eli): Identified verbs “appears” and “manifests” as acts.
- Student (Dang J): Voluntariness lacking because appearance was involuntary arrest; conviction fails.
- Professor: Maps appellate path (trial conviction → Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals → possible Alabama Supreme Court on cert).
- Defense hypothetical (Rabia): Appearance involuntary; drunkenness made boisterousness involuntary.
- Prosecution (Maya): Expand timeframe—drinking voluntarily led to public drunkenness; causation argument.
- Prosecution (Joshua): Plain reading—statute doesn’t require voluntary appearance; act is boisterousness.
- Professor: Notes intoxication generally not a defense; levels of intoxication matter but voluntary boisterous conduct could satisfy act.
- Prosecution (Benjamin): Intoxication not defense; focus on voluntary speech acts.
- Professor: Defense could claim alcoholism or unforeseen arrest; prosecution counters foreseeability.
- Professor: Introduces MPC 2.01: liability must include a voluntary act or omission capable of performance; one voluntary act suffices.
- Professor: Conduct defined as action/omission and accompanying state of mind (MPC 1.13); elements can be conduct, attendant circumstances, or result of conduct (MPC 1.13(9)).
- Professor: In Martin, “drunk” is attendant circumstance; “boisterous” is conduct; “public” may be attendant circumstance; result element absent.
- Defense (Una): Argues every act element must be voluntary, not just one.
- Prosecution (Philip): Text only requires inclusion of *a* voluntary act; not all elements must be voluntary.
- Defense (Anna): Spirit of statute aims at voluntarily going into public and causing nuisance; coercive removal shouldn’t trigger liability.
- Prosecution (Andre): Spirit also aligns with text—goal is to prevent public boisterousness; was satisfied.
- Professor: Uses Escher fish/frog illusion to show time-framing bias; outcome hinges on framing of voluntariness.
- Professor: Notes similar framing in Decina (epileptic seizure while driving), homelessness cases, Huey Newton case; framing determines voluntariness perception.
- Professor: Ends class; will cover mens rea next session.

## 2026-01-23 (Criminal Law-transcript-01-23.txt)

**Speaker map**
- Professor = Bernard Harcourt (SPEAKER 1)
- Student (SPEAKER 0) = brief unclear interjection before class
- Various students labeled by order of appearance: Student A (SPEAKER 2), Student B (SPEAKER 3), Student C (SPEAKER 4), Student D (SPEAKER 5), Student E (SPEAKER 6), Student F (SPEAKER 7), Student G (SPEAKER 8), Student H (SPEAKER 9). Names referenced in dialogue: Serena, Anu, Sydney, Noella, Angela, Julia, Elizabeth, Irene, Yingying (aligned roughly with speakers used when called on).

**Conversation**
- Professor: Opens class; today covers omissions (dialectical opposite of actus reus).
- Professor: Reviews Jones case—child dies of malnutrition; omissions create liability only when duty exists (statute, status, contract, assumption/seclusion).
- Professor: MPC 2.01(3) codifies omission liability; duty must be imposed by law.
- Professor: Notes voluntary act defined negatively in MPC (reflex, unconsciousness, hypnosis, movements not product of actor); Decina case hinges on time framing of voluntary act (driving vs seizure).
- Professor: Shifts to mens rea (mental state requirement); Blackstone requires vicious will plus unlawful act.
- Professor: Common-law mens rea terms (specific intent, malice, general intent, strict liability) mostly bar-exam relics; modern focus is MPC’s purpose, knowledge, recklessness, negligence.
- Professor: Elements of offense can be conduct, attendant circumstance, or result of conduct (MPC 1.13); mens rea meaning can vary by element type.
- Professor: In Martin case, conduct = boisterousness/appearance; attendant circumstance = intoxication; result element absent.
- Professor: Purpose applies differently to conduct/result (conscious object) vs attendant circumstances (aware/hope they exist); similar distinctions for knowledge (aware that conduct is of that nature or practically certain result).
- Professor: Recklessness = conscious disregard of substantial unjustifiable risk; negligence = should be aware (reasonable person standard).
- Professor: Works through New York Penal Law §125.20 (manslaughter 1st): attendant circumstances (defendant 18+, victim <11); mens rea intent to cause physical injury; reckless conduct creating grave risk; result = death.
- Professor: Jury instructions hinge on how many elements and associated mens rea; prosecution prefers fewer elements; defense prefers more/stricter mens rea.
- Professor: Discusses Regina v. Cunningham (gas meter theft causing gas leak harming mother-in-law). Statute: unlawfully and maliciously administer poison or noxious thing endangering life.
- Student (Serena): Facts—Cunningham stole gas meter for shillings, didn’t shut off gas, leak asphyxiated Sarah Wade.
- Professor: “Unlawfully” carves out lawful uses (e.g., anesthesia); focus on “maliciously.”
- Judge Oliver (trial): Defined malicious as “wicked”—no business doing it and knows it.
- Scholar Kenny: Malice = intent to do the particular harm *or* recklessness as to whether such harm occurs.
- Professor: MPC hierarchy—purpose > knowledge > recklessness > negligence; if statute says intent *or* recklessness, recklessness suffices.
- Judge Byrne (appeal): Malicious satisfied if defendant foresaw removal might cause injury yet acted—foreseeability standard akin to recklessness.
- Negligence would be easier for prosecution because no need to prove defendant’s actual awareness; just what reasonable person would foresee.
- Professor: Moves to Faulkner (Malicious Damage Act—maliciously setting fire to a ship).
- Student (Angela): Faulkner stealing rum punctured cask; lamp ignited vapors; ship burned.
- Trial judge: Told jury no need to find intent to burn ship; if stealing rum and fire happened, guilty—strict-liability-like.
- Professor: Notes similarity to felony murder rule (offense during felony elevates homicide).
- Judge Barry (appeal): Started with intent/willful, then equated to knowledge + recklessness (probable injury known, acted anyway).
- Judge Fitzgerald (dissent): Wanted probable consequence/reasonable foreseeability; more like recklessness or negligence hybrid.
- Professor: For Faulkner statute “causes a fire to result,” prosecution could argue strict liability (no mens rea stated); defense can invoke MPC 2.02(3) default mens rea (recklessness) or 2.02(4) to import mens rea across elements.
- Professor: If no mens rea on attendant circumstances (e.g., victim age), could be strict liability unless court imports mens rea via statutory history or MPC default.
- Professor: Class ends with note to start from this point next session; fire alarm message interrupted; brief post-class Q&A about strict liability vs attendant circumstances.
