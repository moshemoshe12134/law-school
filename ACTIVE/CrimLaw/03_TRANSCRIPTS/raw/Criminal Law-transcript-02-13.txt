SPEAKER 0
I. Right Worried because mine is. No, it's Yeah. Oh, perfect. Oh, I can go. Yeah and I think. Yeah. It was like it's like. but Yeah. All right. Yeah Oh I I don't think moment You know, I Uh. I one. Bye. It's probably That was good. crazy product I'm.

SPEAKER 1
I got in this car times and I realized.

SPEAKER 0
Oh, I'll tell you what. No. Yeah.

SPEAKER 2
All right, everyone. Welcome back. Let's get started. Some people are gonna be strolling in, I think, but let's get going. Uh, there's too much to cover today. All right. So we are, we are going to, well, let me just remind where we are. Remind everyone where we are. Um, So we were looking at the purposes of punishment. In the Model Penal code, you will recall, right? And what we saw was that the purposes of punishment actually cover everything, every possibility. You can, what you have to do is you have to pay attention to the harms done to crime victims and the blameworthiness of offenders, but we know that actually the harm done to the victims of crime can be very radically different than the questions of blameworthiness, right? Because In the case of the Moretti case, for instance, there's huge harm. 41 persons are dead, and yet there's a question about blameworthiness, right? So these things are completely at odds. Uh, rehabilitation, general deterrence, incapacitation, restitution to crime victims. I mean, everything is thrown in here as if, as if we have to pursue all of these goals of punishment when in fact, They are mutually exclusive in points. The whole idea of the utilitarians was to limit punishment. From a Kantian perspective, the whole idea of the Kantian was to Exclude the possibility of any kind of utilitarian calculus, right? Right? Uh, look at, look at, look at the, look at the con for a second. Look at the conk for a second. Right. What is he saying? What is he saying? Whoa, woe to him who creeps through the serpent windings of utilitarianism. To discover some advantage that may discharge him from the justice of punishment. Right? That is the problem. Is utilitarianism. Right? It's a serpentine path to hell. How on earth could you have a theory of punishment that includes both blameworthiness in a Kantian sense and all of these utilitarian purposes? It makes no sense. Right, Unless you realize that just all these purposes are kind of made up. They're made up and they're imposed. That's ultimately what they are, purposes and utilities in law. Are just signs that a will to power has become master of something less powerful and imposed upon it the character of a function. All right, so What happens then if you try to evacuate the purposes? Well, uh, you could go towards theories of randomization. You could go towards abolition. Let's come back to abolition. And randomization after going through today's cases and readings, um, so we'll come back to that. Let's jump into kind of the functions of punishment as I've tried to set them out here and we're gonna start by looking at the case of the state versus Clarissa. OK. All right, so, uh, very quickly, Benjamin. Can you tell me, um, What happens in the Clarissa case?

SPEAKER 1
Uh, yes, the defendants, who is, what year are we in here? 1847, 1847, and we're in Alabama. We're in Alabama antebellum, Alabama, um, and there is slavery.

SPEAKER 2
Yes, go ahead.

SPEAKER 1
So the defendant who's a slave, um, was, yeah, Clarissa was indicted for attempting to poison, um, allegedly trying to poison her overseer. And I believe someone else who is also um working in the plantation.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah, actually, so, um, so the enslaved person Clarissa is accused of, of poisoning both the person who is the overseer of the plantation and the person who actually owns the plantation. OK, OK, Bussy owns the plantation. OK, go ahead.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, and it was, um. Like, I believe Clarissa was like the cook and like one morning when they were having breakfast she put like this Jamestown weed um into the coffee and she's accused

SPEAKER 2
of putting some kind of poisonous thing in the coffee, yeah, um.

SPEAKER 1
And so I think, I believe it was like her mother, um, like who also came forth and sort of testified about this that like, um, like she denied like the poisoning at first. All right, so her mother was interrogated first, yes, under

SPEAKER 2
what circumstances?

SPEAKER 1
I believe it was during the trial.

SPEAKER 2
Was it? No, no, no, no, it was just brutal torture, OK, brutal torture. Um, the mother was, um, tortured and Gave a, what did she say?

SPEAKER 1
uh yeah, she confessed that, um, I believe she confessed that like Clarissa had like, you know, tried to poison her, her like it was like under like extreme duress, um, yes, yes, indeed, uh, so she, she, she, uh.

SPEAKER 2
She kind of, she turned her daughter in. Uh, she was being whipped by Bussie, and she disclosed, she disclosed that her daughter. Uh, she confessed that her daughter had tried to poison him, right, and I believe, um, I believe Crystal was

SPEAKER 1
also whipped pretty severely, and she had kind of denied confessing at first, but when she was informed that her mother had confessed, she, um, she then afterwards admitted it, I believe, um, right, so she was whipped with great

SPEAKER 2
severity, right? And then she confesses to having tried to poison them. All right.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, and, um, then afterwards, uh, Clarissa was moved like away from the house and the overseer like asked Clarissa like why she tried to poison him and Clarissa said

SPEAKER 2
that she, so moved out of the house, meaning that she was. Her job was in the kitchen, she was working as a cook, and she was forced to become a field laborer, yes, right, which was a form of punishment in itself. OK, all right.

SPEAKER 1
And the overseer asked her why, um, why Clarissa poisoned him, and she said she didn't know, but that was kind of like the court kind of said that that was like kind of like a leading question because like it, it kind of assumed the confession, the previous confession to be legitimate, and because Clarissa was in such like a powerless position. Like she didn't feel like she could rebut that assertion, so she just said that she didn't know, um, OK,

SPEAKER 2
and effectively she confessed a second time, yeah, right, so there are essentially two confessions that Clarissa gave in this case. Uh, the first one was given. Clearly under torture. OK. And the second one was given, you're suggesting in a kind of. Tricky way Right, right, assuming it was an assumption that

SPEAKER 1
the first confession or torture, like was legitimate, and because, because Claris had experienced this torture, and she was kind of looking to, like she didn't, you know, she was, you know, in this position where she just wanted to be able to try to save herself, like rebutting that confession a second time, um, it kind of carried over the implications of the first, OK, the first interaction.

SPEAKER 2
So we've got two confessions, and did you get a sense of, um, whether the first confession. Uh, was admitted at trial.

SPEAKER 1
Um One second. Well, I just got to pull up the case again.

SPEAKER 2
You've all got the, the, uh, the, uh, the case in front of you, right? Right? Yeah, OK. A co-counsel Yasir, do, do, do you, do you, do you recall what happened to the first confession? Um, I believe it was admitted. Yes, it was excluded. It was excluded. OK. So, um, this confession was on motion of the prisoner excluded. OK. Right. So at trial, Clarissa. Clarissa's attorney at trial moved to exclude the first confession, which was given under torture. And that was excluded. That never went in front of the jury. OK. Um, and then the question becomes, then what of the second. Confession. Now, you'll notice a few things. First of all, uh, Clarissa is represented by counsel at trial, and Clarissa is represented by counsel on this appeal to the, uh, where are we at this point? Counsel.

SPEAKER 1
I believe we're at the Alabama Supreme Court. We're at the Alabama Supreme Court.

SPEAKER 2
So Clarissa is represented by an attorney who's arguing the case at the Alabama Supreme Court. And um the attorney is raising a number of claims. Did you get a sense of all of the different claims uh that were being raised? Uh, I'm gonna come back to your row in a minute. Um, but, uh, let's, let's add another row here as well. Serena, did you get a sense of how, what kind of claims were being raised here?

SPEAKER 3
Um, I will admit I did not off the top of my head, but I'm happy to look or call upon co-counsel.

SPEAKER 2
OK, co-counsel, co-counsel. Uh, Ava, co-counsel. What are the claims? Did you get a sense of what the claims are? Um, One sec. How many claims are being raised here in this, in this case?

SPEAKER 0
I think there were 2.

SPEAKER 4
I can't remember exactly what they were.

SPEAKER 2
There were more than 1 for sure. Did you get a sense of what, what they were, what some of them were? I'm not sure off the top. All right, let's add another road. Joseph, did you get a sense? Not so much Jeremy Um, OK, I'm not sure exactly

SPEAKER 3
how many, but I know that one of them, right, was that like the poison had to be calculated to cause death, and they were saying that, um, Clarissa didn't actually put enough in so that it was likely, um,

SPEAKER 2
that, so actually, so it's a tricky claim, the first claim, it's not a, it's not so it's, there is something about the Jason weed. There's something about the Jason weed that is tricky here and that the, that the, that the, uh. That the attorney is raising as a problem here. Uh, who's got this case under control? Anybody? No. Addison What's the first, what's the, what's the, what is the, what is the first claim about?

SPEAKER 5
I thought the first claim was about whether or not there was actually an attempt to poison the, um, the overseers.

SPEAKER 2
So it's, it, it's almost that the first claim is that the indictment is defective. The indictment is defective. She was indicted by a grand jury, and the claim is that it was defective. Yes sir, why, why was it defective? Did you get a sense of that? Sure. Go ahead. Why was it defective?

SPEAKER 5
I think it was defective because it's, it's sort of assumed as a matter of law that the, uh, weed was, or the Jamestown seed was, um, poisonous.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah, well, it didn't state as a matter of law that Jamestown weed is poisonous. Right? It failed to stay. That Jamestown weed is poisonous. Uh, if you look at the opinion, all right, this is on page 61. This is page 61 of the Alabama reports from 1847. It says Every allegation in this indictment may be proved, and the life of the persons against whom the supposed attempt to poison was made never have been in jeopardy, as it cannot be known as a matter of law that the seed of the Jamestown weed is a deadly poison. So nobody, so there's, so it wasn't in the indictment, it didn't state. That Jamestown weed. is poisonous. OK. It's said that they tried to poison, that she tried to poison the master and the overseer with Jamestown weed, but it doesn't specifically say. Jamestown weed is a poison. Right? So the indictment in the case was defective because it was missing an element. Which was that it was poison that was being administered. They said it was Jamestown weed that was being administered, but no one said Jamestown weed is a poison. Right? Right? OK. And actually, that's what the case gets reversed on. OK. That's the basis for the reversal. Now there's another claim in there about something about purging the grand jury. Um, did you get a sense of that, Elliott? What is purging the grand jury, what does that mean?

SPEAKER 3
Um, my understanding is that they tried to get rid of the jury because they couldn't, it says the grand jury could not be asked before they were sworn whether they had not formed and expressed an opinion as to the guilt or innocence. Um, But they were not asked.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah, like they were not asked about whether they had a bias or whether they had formed an opinion, right. And so the attorney says, wait, we wanted to have that opportunity to purge the jury. And You didn't give it to us. That's uh an error. And the court says, no, you don't have a right. You don't have the right to that, OK? And of course you all, in, in terms, on the indictment itself, you all saw the indictment, right? It's the first thing in the opinion, right? The indictment itself, right? The grand jurors of the state of Alabama and paneled sworn and charged upon their oath present that Clarissa, the property of such and so, right? Did, uh, being, uh, a large quantity of certain noxious, destructive thing, but it wasn't said it was poison called Jason weed. Um, 2 ounces with intent then and there, thereby feloniously and willfully in her malice aforethought, said Nelson Parsons and Hezeki Abbassi to poison, kill, murder against the peace and dignity of the state. That's the indictment, right? That's the charging indictment. Right. OK. Um, and so the attorney challenges that indictment after the conviction. She's been sentenced to death. She's been sentenced to death under a Separate code for persons who are enslaved, right? Uh, a separate code that That punishes you to death if you are an unsafe person trying to poison. Uh, a white person Right. And, uh, and, and she's raising these claims to her lawyers. The purging doesn't work, the indictment, but the, the question then becomes, the court decides it's going to look at the question of the confession and the torture, right? And it's doing this, it's dicta, OK? In other words, you know the difference between dicta and holdings. The, in Clarissa actually, It's not a reversal because of the confessions. It's a reversal because of the indictment. So, so what they say about the confessions is just dicta, right? OK. And um And so What do they say about the Admission of the second confession. In Clarissa. Charles, did you get a sense of it?

SPEAKER 6
Yes, I did, um, they said that. The second confession likely should not have been admitted because it was given under the threat of torture, um, given the fact that the dynamics between the Clarissa, who was a slave, as well, and the, the overseer as well as the person who owns the plantation that inherently created, uh, uh, I guess a dynamic where. The the confession was made either under threat or if they were to do it on their like benefit by not being um harmed in that sense as right and

SPEAKER 2
so in a way it wasn't, it wasn't fully voluntary there's a, there's a problem with the confession because it was kind of it was assumed it was because of that trickery. There's, there's some form of trickery and some form of coercion that's going on with the second confession, right? And so the court writes, and this is, this is on the bottom of page 61, right? The court writes, That Um, On the bottom of 61, actually it's not this passage, it's the passage on the bottom. Although the confessions of slaves freely and voluntarily made, uninfluenced by threats or promises, must, as in the case of white persons, be received in evidence, it must be admitted their condition in the scale of society. Their condition in the scale of society throws a certain degree of discredit over any confession of guilt they may make and renders it unsafe, if not improper, to act upon such evidence alone without other corroborating proof. OK. Now, the condition of the slaves. Now it turns out that there was a long history. In law of torturing slaves. Uh, in order to obtain, uh, torturing enslaved persons in order to obtain confessions. And this goes back, this goes back to the Romans, it goes back to the Greeks. In fact, um, if you look at Uh, Justinian's Digest, OK, which is, uh, Justinian's Digest was the Roman equivalent to The Blackstone's commentaries, all right. Justinian's Digest. Uh, they didn't have, they had what they, Justinian was a magistrate. In the Roman Empire, who created a compilation of the law of the Roman law, OK? Just in the same way in which um, Blackstone. Here you can look through this and pass it around. That's volume one. This is volume two. In the same way as Blackstone was, in the same way in which we codify the law today, right? This was the Model Penal Code. All right. It was also the contracts and civil procedure and everything, right? And in the Justinian, they, in the Justinian's Digest, they have a whole thing on investigations. Section 18 of book 48 on investigations. It's customary for torture to be applied to unearth crimes, but let us see when and how far it should be done, right? And then it lists all these rules about, you know, the torturing of a single slave has to be examined by proofs that that the enslaver has to give permission for the torture of the slave, that under certain circumstances, you can't admit the testimony of a of an enslaved person unless they are tortured, right? And in the same way in which trial by battle, Made a lot of sense because trial by battle is divine intervention. In the same way, uh, torturing an enslaved person. Was totally rationalized during all of this period because, When you were interrogating An enslaved person. Who is going to testify against the enslaving person. That enslaved person was under a coercive threat. An inherent coercive threat that they were going to be tortured by their enslaving person. Right? So the only way to overcome that fear and that threat was to torture them now. Right? If you're, if you have some, if someone is worried that they are going to be tortured, depending on what they say in the future. The only way to neutralize that is to torture them right now. It made total sense. They were going to be tortured by their enslaver for testifying against the enslaver. That was going to happen in the future in order to kind of neutralize that future fear and threat. They needed to be tortured. At the moment Of their confession. And so there were all these rules. The same emperor wrote in a rescript to Mumia Loanus that the slaves of a condemned man, because they have ceased to be his property, can be tortured to give evidence against him, and then it gives all these rules, OK. This is from the Roman Empire, rules about the torture of enslaved persons, rules about torturing people. And in this case, In Alabama It's, there's continuity here. There's continuity with all of that history. Right? There's continuity with all that history. And what the court is trying to elaborate are rules about tortured confessions. Right? A tortured confession, clearly is itself not immediately acceptable, admittable, admissible into court, right? However, and then the question becomes, is any further Tortured confession ever admissible, or is any further confession ever admissible after the first one? Right? OK And what does the court say? Well, the court says, OK, later confessions could be acceptable, but this one isn't. Again, because Addison.

SPEAKER 5
Uh, because it was done under torture initially, and so,

SPEAKER 2
well, not only because it was done under torture initially, but because it was tortured or the confession was, was

SPEAKER 5
gotten out of torture and after her because it was

SPEAKER 2
gotten out of a trick. It was gotten out of a trick after the torture. Who's got my, who's got the book? Who's got the Justinian book right now? OK. Uh, open it up to that red tab. Open it up to that red tab at ET. OK. Yeah, yeah. Is there anything about the Clarissa case in the Justinian Digest? Um, no, wait, oh. Does this work? Sorry, yeah, um, is there anything about the Clarissa case in the Justinian Digest?

SPEAKER 4
No, because this is from the Roman Empire, right?

SPEAKER 2
Right. OK, so, well, so there isn't a ruling on the Clarissa case. However, Is there anything in the Justinian Digest that would represent precedent for the Clarissa case?

SPEAKER 4
Um, Sorry, the text is really dense, but I'm looking.

SPEAKER 2
Um, what do you think? Is there any Roman precedent for the just from the Justinian's Digest for the Clarissa case?

SPEAKER 4
OK, this is like high level just that what I'm getting out of this, but there is a law on like, isn't there a law right here?

SPEAKER 2
What does it say? What does it say?

SPEAKER 4
OK, it says the person who is going to conduct the torture should not ask specifically whether. Lucius Tus committed a homicide, but in general terms who did it for the firmer seems rather the action of someone suggesting an answer than seeking the truth. Oh, and so the deified Trojan wrote in a re-script.

SPEAKER 2
So, so, so how does that rule apply here?

SPEAKER 4
Um, Oh, like, OK, I don't know if this is right, but like, It says it shouldn't be asking about a specific person, so maybe just like keeping it general.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah, or how about the former seems rather the actual, someone suggesting an answer than seeking the truth. should not ask specifically whether he committed a homicide, but in general terms, who did it.

SPEAKER 4
Yeah, so kind of not like, isn't that exactly Clarissa

SPEAKER 2
case?

SPEAKER 4
Well, this is like I understand this as like not asking a leading question, yeah.

SPEAKER 2
You shouldn't be suggesting. The answer, which was exactly what the overseer or did in this particular case, right? What did they do? Um, The question was asked. Then why she had continued to give him poison when she saw him so near dying from the effect of it. That's, that's a leading question under torture, suggesting that the person did it for sure. She replied that she did not know unless it was the devil that put it into her head. Right? Why she had continued to give him poison. So you're, he was, he was affirming that she had committed the crime. And then saying, Why did you do that crime? Right? And actually, so actually, under Roman law, that would have been a violation of the Acceptable torture of an enslaved person. Who's? Tortured confession would norm would possibly be admitted, but not if it was done in this kind of leading way. Right? OK. So there's a, there's a long history of this kind of regulation of um Of torture. And we're seeing here the Alabama Supreme Court deciding very, in a very refined way, kind of when torture would be admissible, when it wouldn't be admissible. And of course, it's not admissible in this case. The court says Because The human policy of our law would exclude such evidence coming from a white person. And the reason is much stronger for excluding it in the case of a slave. And why is the reason greater? Well, it's that earlier passage, right? Because of their condition in the scale of society. Their condition in the scale of society throws a certain degree of discredit on any confession of guilt they may make and renders it unsafe, if not improper to act upon such evidence alone without other corroborating proof. OK, and then, uh, the second case we have is the Wyatt case. Um Uh, Wyatt versus the state. Uh. Did we, did you get a sense of, uh, what happened in Wyatt, Addison? Yeah, I mean, I think at a sort of a,

SPEAKER 5
at a high level that it was a similar, not a similar situation, but he, there's a, an enslaved person who had Wyatt, who had, uh, been alleged of setting fire to, uh, the gin house and, um. In, in that or in that sort of confession or trying to get out information from him, they said, boy, these denials are only going to make the matter worse. And the court basically held that those, that, that was, um, uh, holding him under duress basically or under some form of, of pressure to, uh, you know, confess and, and, and, and, you know, it's not necessarily. The veracity of that confession is unclear.

SPEAKER 2
OK, so we've got a first confession in that case, and that first confession is not only under the threat of harm, right, but also under, um. He's being, he's being tortured. I mean he's, he's tied to a post. He's spent the whole night on the post. I mean he is being tortured. And basically he obtains a first confession from the enslaved person under torture. And the question in the case then becomes, well, is there And, and then the que and then what happens, what happens afterwards? Did you get a sense of this? Did you get a sense of this, um, Philip?

SPEAKER 7
Yeah, so he, he gives the first confession, uh, to his master, and, um, then the master brings around, um, Someone called the justice, I guess some kind of like

SPEAKER 2
he legal official of the peace, he takes, he takes the enslaved person to kind of like a justice of the peace who is the functional, you know, a judge, let's just say. OK.

SPEAKER 7
Yeah, and then he, he repeats the same confession that he had burned the gin house, uh, in the presence of both the master and the justice of the peace.

SPEAKER 2
OK. And the question in that case again is the admission of the second confession. OK. The first one was tortured. Clear torture. We're not gonna debate it. But the question is whether In a, you can have a non-tortured kind of subsequent confession that would be admissible and not tainted by the original torture. OK? And that second one was given in front of a judge. Right? And what does the court, what does the court hold basically?

SPEAKER 7
Um, well, it ends up, uh, reversing and remanding the conviction, and it says, um, so it reverses his conviction

SPEAKER 2
and sentence. So he, as well, like Clarissa is going to have a new trial. Yes, go ahead.

SPEAKER 7
And it basically says you need to take the utmost precaution, uh, when considering that second confession to make sure that there was. Um, that it was like, you know, given voluntarily and, uh, and what was, and what was wrong with that

SPEAKER 2
confession I mean, it's given in front of a judge for crying out loud.

SPEAKER 7
Um, I think it's the same issue of the, the fear of punishment, um, but it's almost in the reverse because, uh, This enslaved person is giving a confession with a intend to to better his situation rather than out of a fear of further punishment. So he's trying to like alleviate. The, the, the, the torture that he's experiencing through that confession, I think that it's a similar kind of like in the reverse idea. What did he do?

SPEAKER 2
What, what was, what was wrong with that second confession?

SPEAKER 7
Um, well, he's still on the, he's still tied up to the post, so like, no, not for the second wife. Oh, he's not, OK, um, he's taken, he's like, it's

SPEAKER 2
like this is kind of like later he like takes him to a judge. He's in front of a magistrate, he's like in a courtroom. What more do you want? That's a lot of process, no?

SPEAKER 7
Yeah, I'm not 100% sure, um, other than the continued fear of, of punishment and, and, and coercion and torture.

SPEAKER 2
And, your, your, your, you, you and you and your co-counsel are talking about this, uh. Uh, Shakina. What do you guys think? Oh, was it because the master was also present during the confession? Yeah, it's because the master is present, and what does the master do? What does the master say? Shakina, did you see what the master actually says?

SPEAKER 0
Um, I was thinking the same thing, but let me

SPEAKER 2
see. OK, can, um, oh, go ahead. Oh no, that was right, go ahead. Anu, did you see what the master actually said?

SPEAKER 4
Um, when he first got there, he, he told the judge, um, he's burnt my gin house, question him yourself.

SPEAKER 2
Exactly. So he goes in and he brings his enslaved person with him and he says, he burnt my gin house. Uh Examine him yourself. But then he lets the judge examine him. Right? I mean, He's in front of a neutral judge. Why would that second, what's so wrong with that second provision? Well, what the court says is, you know, again, you have to be particularly solicitous in these cases. The humane policy of our law requires that you be particularly solicitous here because, you know, he, he was kind of under the coercive, there was this coercive umbrella of the enslaving person being right there. Right? Uh, and so ultimately they say, no, that's not admissible. Uh, they actually come up with a list of things that wouldn't be admissible. Where the prosecutor said to the prisoner, if you will tell me where my goods are, I will be favorable to you. That's inadmissible. He's, they've got a whole list. If you will not, of course, we can do nothing. inadmissible. All of those things being somewhat kind of tricky or tainted or suggestive, right, that there might be punishment. All right. And so the rule here is that it was not, that it was improperly received. He gets a new trial, um, And you'll notice that it relies in part on Clarissa, so it's kind of like building some precedent here. OK. All right. Now you may be asking yourselves. Why? On earth did Harcourt give us these cases to read? And what the hell do they have to do with anything that we've been studying? And why are we reading cases from Slavery So first of all, And I'll come back to this. It should feel strange. That we're treating cases, legal cases in a Socratic way. In this law school setting. That are cases that existed during a regime of slavery. Right? And yet we can do it exactly the same way as we do Martin versus State. Or Wilansky. Right? We can, we can do the same. What are the facts, what is the law? How does the precedent work and all that, we can learn the law. From a Completely different period of history that was marked by the most heinous. The most heinous. Social conditions. Right? We could do the same thing with Nazi law. Right? We could be reading the cases. There were, there was a very well developed jurisprudence. Under the Third Reich. There was a very well developed jurisprudence of slavery. In the antebellum period. It's no Different than today. We could be doing confession cases from the 1960s. We could do confession cases today. You're gonna do confession cases when you take criminal procedure. And you'll be doing exactly what we were doing. 5 minutes ago, but with contemporary cases. And yet the social conditions were very different back then. Right? And there's a way in which Something about the The the morality of it isn't even in question. We didn't, we didn't talk about whether slavery was good or bad. We were just doing the law. Right? Right, so hold on to that thought. We'll come back to it, OK? It's kind of puzzling, isn't it? But we'll come back to it. The second reason is because I think something was going on in these cases. What was going on in these cases? Did you know that the enslaved person had a right to counsel? Did you know that the enslaved person would have their case reversed, their sentence of death reversed. Because the indictment didn't say that Jason weed is a poison. That's kind of odd. It's not what you'd think. It was a lot of process. They got more process than people today. You wouldn't get, you wouldn't get your death sentence flipped because the indictment doesn't, the indictment says that the indictment was good enough. Look at the indictment. Wait a minute, like, really? Look at the indictment. What? A noxious and destructive thing called the seed of jimsonweed. That's not good enough. You would never get an indictment quashed for like, oh, you said it's noxious, but you didn't say it's poisonous. Clarissa got more due process than David Wilson's getting. Right now, my client. Why? I that's surprising. Uh, how about this? It turns out that The enslaving person had to pay the attorney's fees. For their enslaved person. In Alabama There was and it cost approximately $10 at the time. And you have to understand $10 was a lot of money. At the time, The kind of the average. Cost of a field hand in, at this time was about $450. So $10 would have been uh a significant sum of money. And it was the enslaving person who actually had to pay that fee. And it turned out that If the enslaved person was executed. The state of Alabama would pay 50% of the person's value to the enslaver. So, basically, if Clarissa had been executed. Bussie would have gotten 50% of the value that he, of the, of the money he had used to, to buy a human being, 50%. And it turns out that actually the Alabama legislature in 4342 43 proposed a statute. That would have made it 100% reimbursement. And the governor vetoed it. The governor vetoed it because the governor said. Humanity alone. As the statute now stands, is the only inducement to the master to take that interest which is essential to ensure his slave a fair and impartial trial when implicated. In other words, If you make it 100%. Well then the enslaving person is gonna have absolutely no interest whatsoever in ensuring that there's a fair trial and that the person was properly, was guilty and should have been punished. Right? Why? Because they're just gonna be reimbursed fully. Right, there's no loss on their part. So, what you're gonna have is a system where enslavers are going to be kind of throwing their Enslaved persons who might not be doing as much work or might be problematic in some way, saying, OK, look, we'll just charge you with trying to, you know, Poison us. And then we'll get your value back. Right? And what the governor was saying was, That's not gonna work. The incentives aren't going to be structured properly. We're not gonna be able to maintain this social order. If we make those kind of changes. We're not going to be able to maintain the social order. We're not going to be able to maintain slavery. If we make those kind of changes. And these cases. About the torture of enslaved persons are about achieving some kind of equilibrium. Some kind of stability in the social order. Such that slavery can persist. OK. If you didn't have these kind of cases like this, you'd be having too much torture of enslaved persons. Too much and there wouldn't be er, there wouldn't be a proper regulatory system that would keep things under control. That would make it that the system is kind of OK, we got some kind of, we got some, there's some restraints, there's some constraints. We want the system of slavery to go on, says the governor. But you gotta realize, right? If you go with like 100% reimbursement, this is gonna be, this is gonna, this is gonna, this is gonna blow up. OK. And all of these cases, these cases we just read, Clarissa, Wyatt. Are cases that effectively try to negotiate the space of slavery so that it can continue to survive. The judges are trying to negotiate the space of this social order so that it doesn't kind of explode or implode. Right? Now Let's come back to that in a second. Let's just, let's just hold on to that. Um, I asked you to take this, take a look at this passage. This is. The introduction to justice accused. Uh, by Robert Cover. It's perhaps, I think, one of my favorite pieces of literature. In the world, this little introduction here. It's about um Billy Budd, you know, the Melville novel. And um Billy Budd, as you know, is sentenced to death and he's executed. Uh, he was, uh, in the story, he was this magnificently innocent. And um Who, who, who couldn't speak. He was innocence personified, an angel, as Captain Vere said. Who struck and killed out of a fit of anger and. Uh, He'd been accused basically of treason, and he struck and killed the person who accused him. And that was tried and by Captain Ver and he was sentenced to death. And Captain Vere is saying like, well, the law, we have to abide by the law, even if our conscience is telling us that we shouldn't. We have to abide by the law. And he sentences him to death, and he says, and as you recall, he says, uh, He says, you know, an angel, he's, he refers to Billy Bud as an angel, and he says, Struck dead by an angel of God, yet the angel must hang, right? And it turns out that Melville. was writing about Captain Vere. He was thinking about his uncle, who was Emmanuel Shaw, who was a justice on the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. who had upheld The Fugitive Slave Laws and who had, who was himself adamantly opposed to slavery was an abolitionist to the core. And yet upheld the Fugitive Slave Laws. And what cover is trying to suggest here is that He was able to do that in a way, to kind of like put aside his moral opposition to the death penalty, to the, to, to slavery, put aside his consciousness. By saying the law requires this of me. Right. And um And the idea there is that the law then can serve as a legitimating tool. That allows us often to simply put aside what we think. And enforce a system, a social order that we might object to. The law allows us in a way to have these conversations about the Clarissa case, about the Wyatt case. Without asking ourselves. What's the morality of this social system we live in? Right? It allowed Emmanuel Shah to simply put aside all of his abolitionism. And simply follow the law. And the question then becomes is what are we doing when we do that? What are we doing when we When we Kind of treat law distinct from the social order that it promotes and supports and holds up, right? All right, I gave you also this reading from Homer. You must be wondering, how does that fit in? OK. How does it fit in? Um, Uh, Elizabeth, did you get it, did you get to the Homer reading? Sorry, yes, have I got it right? Yes, no, yes, yeah. Sorry. Say what?

SPEAKER 3
Oh, I said there's 3, Elizabeth.

SPEAKER 2
I know there are.

SPEAKER 3
Um, how does it relate?

SPEAKER 2
Did you get to the, did you get to the home, to the Homer piece? Yeah, OK, so tell me quickly what happens there.

SPEAKER 3
So there was like a chariot race. I can't pronounce like most of these people's names.

SPEAKER 2
That's OK. We'll go, we'll go for it, uh, and. Antilochus Antilochus, um, was like the son of Nestor and

SPEAKER 3
he was like younger but not the fastest, and then Menelaus Menelaus, um, is like of higher status, and what

SPEAKER 2
do you mean by higher status, yeah, like he was

SPEAKER 3
older, he was supposed to win.

SPEAKER 2
He's older, yeah, yeah, yeah, he was supposed to he's a more senior hero, yeah, and then during the race

SPEAKER 3
Antilochus cut in front of.

SPEAKER 2
Menelaus Menelaus, yeah and then kind of like, yeah, cut in front. Well, they were kind of like they were like side to side, right? They were side to side. So you've got, so you've got, so you've got, you've got about 5 people racing. You've got a couple of gods, demigods, put them aside for a second, and then you've got Minillas, who's a really well respected, I mean he's fought. You know, Trojan War, everything. He's, you know, really senior. And then you've got Antilochus, who's very young, all right? Antilochus is the young. Hero here. But they're side to side, right, right, and they're on the cherry, and what happens at that point? You got to go around a post and what happens right there?

SPEAKER 3
Anilicus kind of cut in front of, yeah, well, and

SPEAKER 2
no, Menelaos says. Hold your, hold, hold your horses back.

SPEAKER 3
Yeah, I got to get around the post, right?

SPEAKER 2
And Antilochus says.

SPEAKER 3
No, you gotta be joking, right?

SPEAKER 2
Andilus is like, no way, I'm not doing that, right? And then Tillous go and so Menelaus holds his horses because one of them is gonna crash, right? So Menelaus holds his horses and Tillius gets around the post and gets back in front of Millas, right? OK. And, and then at that point then they start giving out the prizes, right? It's Achilles who's actually giving out the prizes, right? So this is a This is a, this is a, a, this is a, an event to um Kind of, uh, in, in, in, in memoriam and it's, it's in memoriam for, uh, Peo, uh, who was an even greater hero, and, and Achilles is giving out the, the prizes and what happens in there at this point.

SPEAKER 3
Um, Menelas objects like in front of everybody and then accuses Antilochus of racing unfairly and demands that he swears an oath that he did not cheat and then, yeah,

SPEAKER 2
OK, so let's slow that down for a second. So, um, he's, uh, Antilochus is given out the, is giving out the, um, is giving out the prizes, and at this point, basically, um, What happens is Antilochus kind of says, wait a minute, you know, I'm, I'm entitled to that. 2nd prize. I came in 2nd, right? And it's a mayor or something, you know, But he wants the 2nd prize, and Minnelaus looks at him and says, Wait a minute, are you, you're telling me that you beat me? Right, are you telling me I'm 3rd? Are you telling me that you're better than me? And he says, and then he he challenges him to the truth. So this is, at this point, this is a trial, right? A Greek trial, essentially. It's a, it's a litigation. The litigation as to who wins the prize. Right. And at first, actually, Menelaos says, you know what, we're gonna reunite all of the most senior heroes here. OK, we're gonna bring them all together and we're gonna decide who gets the prize and who won. Whether you Beat me. And he says, no, actually, Let's not do that. Let's do something else. And that's where you said he tells them to. swear, swear to Zeus, swear to Zeus that what he

SPEAKER 3
didn't cheat.

SPEAKER 2
Well, it's not so much he didn't cheat, it's just swear to Zeus that you're stronger than me, right, right. Yeah. And then what happens? So at this point, you know, at this point, like Antilochus has to take his whip and go, you know, sign up to Zeus and say, and swear, make this sermon to Zeus. At which point, what would happen to, what would happen to Antilochus if he said this?

SPEAKER 3
Um, he'd probably get punished.

SPEAKER 2
There'd be a stroke of lightning coming down from Zeus, and he would be dead. Is what he's thinking. Why Because.

SPEAKER 3
Me? Yeah, oh, because, um. Moment. Menelaus was. Like, like better than him in terms of like rank and like honor and status because Minnelaus was his senior.

SPEAKER 2
Right. Just like I'm your senior period, right?

SPEAKER 3
Yeah. You're better than me.

SPEAKER 0
I'm scared.

SPEAKER 2
That's right That's exactly right. I am stronger than you, probably. And I am, A greater hero than you, yes. Simply because I'm. Older than you.

SPEAKER 3
Yes, keep going.

SPEAKER 2
So now, so what, so, and of course, so, and of course Antilochus realizes his foolishness, as you have just now. Absolutely, right? Yeah, and confesses his error. He confesses his error, he confesses that he was misled by his youth. And he was misled by his youth. He was misled by his youth. And impetuousness. To think that He could be better than his senior. Right? Now, so what kind of a race was this? An. Uh, I mean, like, what were we doing in this race?

SPEAKER 3
I guess like it wasn't about like how I interpreted it like it wasn't about discovering like the objective truth of like who is like faster and like stronger but about publicly staging and reinforcing an already established social hierarchy.

SPEAKER 2
Right, precisely, precisely. And um Everything about it. was about Representing. Reinforcing. That social hierarchy, the Greek social hierarchy, the Greek social order. Right? It's not like Cortina. Right, right now we're trying to figure out, you know, who's the fastest slalom skier. That's a real race. That's a real race to figure out who is physically stronger, and probably if you and I went outside, you'd run faster than me.

SPEAKER 3
I don't know about that.

SPEAKER 2
Well, you're definitely better. Thank you. Right. Exactly. Because that doesn't matter. Right, the only thing that matters is the social order. So the, the race was intended to be a reflection of the social order. And in this particular case, actually, in this particular case, Uh, Mingjiang Do, do you get a sense of like, how the order, how the order is reaffirmed?

SPEAKER 8
As in the consequences of the race, yeah, I mean,

SPEAKER 2
as in the consequences maybe of of Antilochus' actions. Right? I mean, Antilochus, Antilochus. Is the one who ultimately reaffirms the social order, right?

SPEAKER 8
Yes, and he does it in a way that does not cause further altercations within the, uh, within the existing order. Um, he does not, well, he abandons his right to the. Second, wait, to the, yes, to the 2nd prize, um, by saying I'm not going to undertake the oath because he knows he would be right, he does it like

SPEAKER 2
voluntarily, right. In fact, I mean, the what you're suggesting is, and it's, it is actually kind of not, I mean, Foucault doesn't really say this, but it would have been a lot worse if the senior heroes had gotten together and imposed their will on Antilochus, right? When, when Menelaos, the first time he thinks, he thinks, oh, I'm just gonna reunite the heroes. And then we're going to decide the case. Well, that would have been like an imposition. That would have been coercion, right? Here, instead, Antilochus, on his own, of his own. Right, of his own, he says, my youth fooled me. Actually, my youth fooled me, that social order is right. So he, like, he, he willingly, voluntarily kind of, kind of refies the social order of his own doing. Right? In a, in a very, and, and, and, in that way actually reinforces it even more than if it were imposed by his kind of quasi confession. Right, he is Giving a renewed, a rejuvenated strength to the social order of ancient Greece. Right? And the social order of ancient Greece is very clear. It's that The senior heroes are more important than the junior heroes. Right? There is a social hierarchy. Minnelaus is more entitled to respect than Antilochus because of this. Right? Um, Juliana, were you a classics major? Uh, yeah, you were. Who else was classics majors here? Oh, OK. Any others? Only one expert. Juliana? OK. So, and so, so what do you think, what do you think is going on in terms of um How does How does all of this Greek social order stuff come? What is it, what does it tell us? Do you think?

SPEAKER 9
It's a very open ended question is um. I mean, Foucault doesn't touch on this in the lecture, but something I've been thinking about is like the chronology of the Iliad, like the The epic, the Homeric epics were received like in this oral tradition and so in effect like people during classical Greece would be reading this and like these are their heroes from a mythic past and so it's not just reifying like the current social order but it's in a way um. Almost like the way we think about the founders, like telling us historically. This is how the great heroes were like this is how our society was. This is what you have inherited and what you must continue. Um, I don't know if that's what you're going for,

SPEAKER 2
but I don't know what I was going for. I was going for your expertise, um, but I think you've given it to us in a sense that that, that the whole, the all of this work. In the Iliad, the Odyssey, etc. was intended to reaffirm. That their vision of society is being one of a, a hierarchy of heroship, in a way, right? Yeah, I mean, so the whole Iliad is like that, and of course this chapter is just one piece of it, but a piece of it, which is effectively. Trying to show us. And trying to reinforce a proper. social order. Um, which was the Greek social order, the way in which Greek social order was understood, uh, in ancient Greece. Right. All right, now, so How does this all fit together? You must be wondering. We've gone from Antebellum slave cases to To, uh, Melville to. Uh, Foucault on Homer. The antebellum slave cases were doing exactly the same thing. As Antilochus. Which was reaffirming. And reifying. And strengthening. A social order. It was a social order that was based on slavery. It was a it was a social order that was based on. And of A relation between Supremacy of white persons. And the enslavement of black persons. Right. Those, those. Those cases were doing exactly the same thing as what Antilochus is doing when he avows in a sense that he is. The junior hero. And affirms the social order of society. Those cases, those cases are making that social order natural. And not only natural but also Um, negotiating their borders in such a way that it goes on and continues. Right, and survives. Right? And um That is what we do as lawyers, essentially. All the time, in all of our cases. We don't realize it, but what we're doing is we are. For the most part Making possible the social order that we live in. Today Now We don't ever ask these questions like what is the social order that we are. Uh, promoting. We generally just ask ourselves questions like, well, is the second confession admissible? Because, um, well, the first commission, the first confession was kind of coerced. Second confession was given in front of a magistrate, you know, We treat these cases the way we treat all of our cases, you know, is, is Martin's action voluntary? Is Martin's action not voluntary, right? We, we do this as if like what's really at issue are the small legal questions. But we put aside completely, we put aside completely. The like the social structures that they kind of enact. Right? So when we study law, You should think of it in terms of layers, OK? You should think of it in terms of layers. When you study law, you should think of it in terms of layers. You should think that at the top. There's the source of law. Right? So what is the sources of law? The sources of law are the model penal code. Right. Um, the New York, the New York Penal Code, uh, the Constitution. Next week we'll be doing constitutional law. Uh, the 14th Amendment, the due process clause, those are sources of law, right? And they're the most important thing. That's what we spend all our time focusing on. In law school The second thing is the legal reasoning, right? What is it? Why is it? How does, how does, uh, what is the precedent? How do we interpret the source of law? Uh, what is the case law, um, and what's the reasoning in the decisions, right? Uh, Willansky, something about negligence, something about recklessness, awareness, etc. All of the legal reasoning that goes into those cases. The 3rd Is legal history. Legal history always plays a role in here. We look at Blackstone, we can see the, we can trace things to the to the Romans. We'll see the way in which And of legal history plays an important role, changes and changes, uh, etc. But the most kind of determinative thing, sorry, the most determinative thing. Are the relations of power in society that kind of undergird all of this. OK. And the relations of power are the ways in which Social ordering is created. It's the way in which we have a place like. Angola. Right? Or the way in which we incarcerate people, 2 million plus, right? Or the way in which ratios of prison and jail populations change by race. Over the 20th century. Those are all the relations of power that maintain a social order and that are effectively hidden. In In our, in our. In our legal analysis, in our daily legal studies. Hidden because we never really kind of probe about them. So instead, we can kind of argue about a Clarissa case, we can argue about a Wyatt case today, contemporary, without ever even asking. What is it doing? What kind of social order is it creating? Uh, we can, we can argue about All of these criminal law cases we're going to be studying this semester without ever asking, wait. Are we in How how does our society relate to a slave society? What kind of society do we have? What, how are these cases contributing to the social order that we have today? Right? Um, And so We should always be going back. To explore how it is. That we are kind of contributing. To a social order. Through our analysis of the laws and Punishment and criminality and what it is that that social order looks like. Now with that in mind, I had intended to get back to the Abolition readings, but we've run out of time. Uh, so what I propose is that we, we pick up with the abolition readings on Tuesday before then studying the constitutional, uh, limits of the criminal law, OK? All right, have a great weekend. Thank you.
