SPEAKER 0
I All right, everyone. Welcome back. Let's get back to work. All right. So. Cynthia, I was asking you a question about the Model Penal Code, but before I get back to you. Uh, let's just. Recap where we are here, OK. So, um, we're studying felony murder, right? Um, a particular kind of category of homicide. Um At common law, in the English system, centuries ago, it was, there was a, there was a sharp distinction between, Lawful and unlawful acts resulting in death, right? And so we saw that discussion in the Koch Institutes about whether someone was lawfully on their property or not, and if they were not lawfully on the property, then it would have been a felony and therefore any death that would have occurred would have been felony murder. It's a pretty harsh rule. It was a harsh rule that was mitigated by the fact that most felonies were sentenced by death anyway. So there wasn't much of an effect. And there wasn't much gradation. You see, in the 19th century, the courts are starting to narrow the underlying felony or to start to put some limits on it. Um, you notice, uh, Justice Stevens in the Serna case in 1887 proposing that there be some notion that the death be in furtherance of the felony, right, that there be some connection between the death, and that notion of furtherance, in furtherance of court is very similar to our contemporary notion of foreseeability. Um, although it's, it's, it's actually even. More closely tied in some way than simple foreseeability. Which is an issue of Cognition foreseeability, right? It's just a question of what you can imagine happening, whereas in furtherance almost seems as if there's an element of intentionality in it. But these were competing approaches to try and limit. We saw that in the United States originally there wasn't much limitation, so we saw a case like People versus Stamp from 1969 California where basically you take your. Victim as you find them and you're responsible essentially for anything that might happen. And we saw that the arguments are well. The typical kind of arguments we get in these cases and that we'll see today. One is a question of deterrence. Might it deter? Might people use greater care when they're engaged in a felony, knowing that if someone dies, they would be responsible for that death. Might it have some deterrent effect? Or on the contrary, might it undermine the deterrent effect because there's no marginal deterrence, right? Because in fact, um, if you punish the same for robbery. That accidentally results in a murder. And robbery that intentionally results in a murder, there's no real reason to be careful, right? In fact, it might actually encourage homicide because the robber would be getting rid of a witness, right? So no marginal deterrence. Arguments about the fact that, well, it, it might not really be preventable. There's nothing that that stamp could have done to prevent that death. His victim. Um, except not to not to commit the robbery, right? Um, but there wasn't anything he could do, uh, even going in there with a toy gun. would not have prevented the death. OK, so we see that. Uh, there's a trajectory and ultimately, um, a lot of jurisdictions create foreseeability exceptions, so it has to be the case that it's foreseeable that that. Felony could result in death. And we saw the Sarah Stillman article about the fact that you know there's in some jurisdictions the rules are so harsh that there's even there is really no foreseeability applied and that's the case of um. Mr. Baxter, who basically was simply breaking into cars. To steal money. And it's really hard to imagine the foreseeability of that leading to the death of the cyclist by the co-defendant running away from the police, OK. Um, I mean, if that's, if death is foreseeable there, then death is then, then it's always foreseeable, and it's kind of like the game is over, right? Um OK. That brings us then to the Model Penal Code approach, um, which tries to do something slightly different. And Via, what does the Model Penal Code do?

SPEAKER 1
Um, it says that there is a reck like recklessness and extreme indifference to the value of human life is presumed if the actor is engaged um in committing a felony.

SPEAKER 0
Right, right. And do you know what how that presumption works?

SPEAKER 1
No, yeah, so, so now we're in the second part

SPEAKER 0
of the Model Penal code, right, because we've got a, we've got a, um, specific crime which is homicide. And You're right. So the way that it deals with it is to say, well, we're going to presume. That there's extreme recklessness if there's another felony. Right? OK. And so then you want to try and figure out how does a presumption really work. A presumption would be a kind of a general thing that applies to any kind of case. So you'd go to the part one of your model penal code, the first part, the general part. And you try and figure out, see if there's anything about presumptions um in any of those definitions or kind of broad sections about general liability and you might come across in section 112. Subsection 5. Of these general provisions that apply to all offenses, you might come across something in section 5 that talks about a presumption and talks about how the presumption works, OK, um, so you'd look there and you see when the code establishes a presumption with respect to any fact which is an element of an offense, it has the following consequences. OK, what would be the, what would be here the fact that would be an element of an offense. How do we, how do we read this in the context of that model penal code homicide provision?

SPEAKER 1
Um, I think that it says that if the fact is submitted to the jury, and unless the court is satisfied that the evidence as a whole clearly negatives the presumed fact.

SPEAKER 0
OK, yeah. And what is the fact here? What do you think the fact would be?

SPEAKER 1
The fact that supports like that the person committed. An element of the offense. What would, what would be the element of the offense

SPEAKER 0
here, do you think that we're talking about in terms of this presumption?

SPEAKER 1
Uh The the mens rea.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah, it would be the mens rea, right? Cause all we're talking about here really is mens rea. So the only question here is whether the mens rea. Of extreme recklessness, that's just that that's, that's the element the element, the element is extreme recklessness, it's the mens rea, right? Whether that, whether it's whether factually there was extreme recklessness. Right. So, the question here, the question that the jury has to decide is, was there extreme recklessness in this case? Right? Was there extreme recklessness in the stamp case, for instance, if we analyze it under the model penal code? OK, so when the establishes a presumption with respect to any fact which is an element of an offense, so when it establishes a presumption regarding extreme recklessness, so it's the following consequences when there's evidence of the facts which give rise to the presumption, the facts which give rise to the presumption would be.

SPEAKER 1
Committing the felony, committing the felony, yeah, those would be

SPEAKER 0
facts that would give rise to the presumption. The issue of the existence of the presumed fact must be submitted to the jury. Unless the court is satisfied the evidence as a whole clearly negatives the presumed fact. OK, um, so. Unless the court finds there's no evidence that you engaged in that felony. The fact goes to the jury, right, and then when the issue of the existing supreme fact is submitted to the jury, the court shall charge, so this is basically what the court will tell the jury, that while the presumed fact must on all the evidence be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, the law declares that the jury may regard the facts, giving rise to the presumption as sufficient evidence of the presumed fact. OK, so. What is? So what is, and what, what do you think that means?

SPEAKER 1
Um. I think that they kind of just have the jury has to take the fact that Um, Like, the fact of committing the felony as like, sufficient for to prove the mens rea.

SPEAKER 0
Right. The jury may regard the facts giving rise to as sufficient evidence for the presumed fact. May regard so, so basically. What's the difference? What would be the difference technically between a statute that simply says, It's Felony murder if the. If you find that the felony occurred and this. I mean, so the Model Penal Code is trying to, trying to, trying to create some light between. Automatically saying it's felony murder and something about a presumption, right? What is that light? Is there any light there between those two?

SPEAKER 1
Um, I don't think there's like a super like guiding force there.

SPEAKER 0
Is there any difference?

SPEAKER 1
I guess that the The difference may be that like the jury has to do like less work in terms of being like punitive.

SPEAKER 0
Less work under which model do you think?

SPEAKER 1
The model penal penal code.

SPEAKER 0
Why would you say less work?

SPEAKER 1
Because it doesn't. Um It doesn't force them to find like that it doesn't force the jury to find the mens rea themselves, but kind of just like gives it to them in the in the sense that like, oh, if you find this part, like you have evidence for the mens rea too.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah, I don't know if that seems to me to give them a little bit more work. No? I mean, in one scenario, in one scenario, it's automatic. The jury is told if this Homicide. If, if causing death happened during a robbery. It's felony murder. Like in the stamp case, it, it happened during a robbery. So there's no work to do, right? It's kind of like it, there's a, there's a way in which it's pretty strict liability. All the jury has to determine was that there was the underlying felony. Here Here, what do they have to find? They have to find that there was an underlying felony and anything more?

SPEAKER 1
Um, They have to find that the. Underlying like felony is enough. To Presume the mens rea.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah, or they have to find that the, the underlying felony. They're given a presumption that the underlying felony amounts to extreme recklessness. But they still have to. Accept that presumption in a way. Right? So they need to not only find that there was an underlying felony, but then accept the presumption that that underlying felony amounts to extreme recklessness. And I take it that that gives them the option then to say something like, Well, you know, I'm not sure. In the end, I mean, We can presume. But we don't have to. Right, so you can imagine jury deliberations where 12 people are there really trying to figure this out, saying to themselves, OK, right, well, we have enough here to presume that there was. Extreme recklessness. But we don't have to. We, we still, we can, we need to accept this presumption in a way, right? So what it, so what it does really. is it allows a jury. To then try to distinguish between The presumption and whether or not the presumption should apply and whether or not in fact they ultimately think that that this crime is enough to say it was extremely reckless on the part of the defendant, right? It's pretty thin, it's a pretty thin distinction. Um, but, uh, but that's, I mean that's, and it's not, I mean, it seems. I mean, given the way the presumption Works in the general part, it seems pretty preclusive. It doesn't seem, I mean, it would be. I feel it was a nice attempt at trying to create some light. But I'm not sure it really works. It might have just been better to say, You know, you. You should consider whether you think that the commission of this felony. is behavior that is extremely reckless in, in something like that. Right The presumption kind of makes it. Too easy for the jury just to rest on that alone in a way, it doesn't really create that much, and of course, and it doesn't necessarily. Well, I mean, it doesn't give them a hook like foreseeability or in furtherance necessarily to. To discuss the case, right? It might not give them the right kind of language to discuss the case. OK. All right. In any event, uh, that's what the MPC tries to do and states that use the MPC. OK. All right, now, state versus Canola, which is on page 546 or 517, then raises all kinds of issues about. Um, who can be, and we, we had started to talk about State versus Canola, but, uh, starts to ask all questions about how, how we should be thinking about felony murder, where Kind of it might have been foreseeable, but the actual causing the death occurs by someone who you wouldn't have exactly expected to be the one who was causing death, such as a victim or a police officer, OK, and whether the defendant is responsible for those additional deaths, OK, deaths may be perpetrated by a co-defendant or police officer or a victim. OK. Now, um, Uh, Jeremy and, uh, let's see, Jeremy, with uh, you guys are gonna be, uh, prosecutors, OK, and, um, we're gonna have defense counsel here, OK? Um, starting with, um, ED, OK. Um, so, You read that there are, there are two theories, right? You read about this, right? Two theories. Elizabeth, did you, you get the sense there are two theories about how this, how these kind of, how these rules apply in the context of uh. Of uh possibly a co-defendant killing someone or a co-defendant being killed, whatnot.

SPEAKER 2
So like one theory is the agency theory which is the doctrine of felony murder which does not extend to a killing if the killing is attributable to the act of someone outside. Of the unlawful acts, um, and this is what happened in State v. Canola. It's narrower and more protective. And then the second one is proximate cause theory where liability under the felony murder rule is attached to any death proximately resulting from the unlawful activity. So this is like broader and harsher. All right, good.

SPEAKER 0
So now you're the prosecution, I think I said, right? So, uh, you, you, you 4 or you 5 are the prosecution, um. Uh, which theory are you more prone to in Mr. Cannella's case?

SPEAKER 2
Um, if I were for a prosecution, I would argue for a proximate cause theory.

SPEAKER 0
OK, why?

SPEAKER 2
Because It's a lot more like strict liability. In terms of like if you were engaged in unlawful activity and someone died. As like Then you're just liable for the death versus like agency theory. You, there's a possibility that if you weren't the one who did the killing and it had to do with a third party, then you would not be liable.

SPEAKER 0
OK, I, are you, uh, you're for defense counsel, which, which, uh, do you, do you, do you effectively agree with prosecution? What would you be arguing for? In this situation.

SPEAKER 3
I would say the um HMC.

SPEAKER 0
OK, so you effectively agree with the prosecution that. That That The general proximate cause theory should not be applied from the defense perspective. OK, all right, and, um, and, and so, and what are your arguments here exactly? What is the argument for, uh, I take it you want the agency theory. Yeah, I think Is your thing broken? It just doesn't. It's not letting. It's broken. It doesn't matter. Then just keep on going, scream, scream. It's better actually, yeah, it'd be better if we didn't have these things. It'd be better if we like you stood up and you screamed. We should do that instead, don't you think? I've been thinking all winter that what I was going to do is I was going to put two podiums here and then have the defense and the prosecution up here arguing to everybody. I think it would really be good. We might do that once we're kind of like settled in and we know each other, you know. No, really, it it it's really good. I mean, you know, this is an exercise, I mean, you're lawyers now. So you need to talk in front of big groups, it's not just the litigators. Not just the litigators, it's also those corporate types who are going to be, you know, making presentations and whatnot. You're going to be in front of big groups. You do.

SPEAKER 3
Yeah, I think especially in this case, uh, the homicide is, uh, justifiable. Um, I mean, the store owners acted, um, in self-defense, um, so it is a legal act.

SPEAKER 0
OK, hold on, hold on, hold on, your, your, your, your defense counsel here, yeah, yeah, OK, I don't know what you mean by justifiable.

SPEAKER 3
Uh, I mean, like the, the homicide itself is, um, is, is, is lawful. Right, you're talking, OK, you're talking about the homicide, OK,

SPEAKER 0
so there are two homicides in this case, right? Um, and you're talking about the Uh, Shooting by the um owner. OK, so the owner shoots the co-defendant. Is that what we're talking about here? Yeah, OK, go ahead.

SPEAKER 3
So like, uh, if this homicide is, um, legal, um, there, there is no like criminal homicide, uh, at the first place, uh, for this specific, uh, death. So, um, it is kind of like unfair to punish, um, Canola for a lawful act by someone else.

SPEAKER 0
Interesting. OK. All right, interesting. So we're kind of back to Koch's Institutes. Is that where we are then? Because it's a lawful, because it's lawful, um. Because it's lawful, OK. Um, So the box we're in right now. I The victim was a co-defendant. Right And the shooter was. The victim of the felony, is that right? Yeah, OK, so you're saying in this box here, where the target of the felony kills. A co-defendant. It's fully justifiable. It's lawful. It's lawful. It's justifiable homicide and therefore it shouldn't be imputed to the defendant here. OK, Um, is there another way, is, uh, is there another way to think about this co-counsel for the defense, uh, Ranji? So one way to think about it is maybe it's, yeah, it's a justifiable homicide. Um, the other ways that is like. Is that an agency theory?

SPEAKER 3
Uh, I guess I'm not like, uh, arguing a specific for that theory, but I think it's an argument for this case. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

SPEAKER 0
But it's not a question of agency. Or is it? Ramji, how would an agency, what would the agency sound like? What would the agency sound argument sound like? Um, it's like the defendant is trying to rob the store. It's not to kill the, uh, owner. So the defendant does not have the intent to kill. But if the owner, if the, the death of the owner is, he's under an agency theory, he would be liable for the death of the owner by the co-defendant. Wouldn't he? You as defense counsel aren't. Challenging the other homicide. Mhm. The other homicide, so we've got one, we've got one death that fits in this box here. Co-defendant kills the victim. And we've got another homicide. No, sorry Wait, uh, uh, uh, uh. The the the robbery victim kills the co-defendant. And then we have another homicide. The other homicide is what box? Um, is the owner killed the the the co-defendant. No, no, what we just saw was the owner kills the co-defendant. The owner kills the co-defendant. This is where we are right now on that first one. The second one was who kills who? Is the co-defendant killed the owner. Yes, so the co-defendant killed the target of the felony, the victim. Right, that box. Yes. Now that box, you as defense counsel right now aren't even challenging that. I take it. He, he was convicted of 2, our defendant was convicted of 2 homicides, this one and this one. And you're not even challenging this one in this case, isn't that correct? If you look at the beginning of your case, you look at the case, the appellate division upheld both convictions. The Supreme Court granted a petition for certiorari certification addressed to homicide of the co-defendant. So the only thing that we are focusing on right now is the homicide of the co-defendant, whether the defendant is guilty for the homicide of the co-defendant under a felony murder rule, right? Does that make sense? It's tricky. But it hopefully it makes sense. And why is that? Why Why is that That homicide, which is the co-defendant kills the victim. Why is that not really at issue here? Because it's not. The owner is not killed by the defendant. Uh, well, it's not an issue because neither under your theory nor under the prosecution's theory, is there any doubt that you would be res that that your client is responsible for that death. Neither under the agency theory nor under the proximate cause theory, is there any question but that classically, felony murder, if your co-defendant kills, The victim of the robbery, that's felony murder. You're trying to argue something that applies to kind of what bucket of cases. Motion. Which, which kind of cases on here does your argument apply? So I mean, I, and I take it Elizabeth is arguing under your theory all of these different homicides would be attributable, although I'll come to you next to ask whether that's true. So our framing as defense is that we reject the proximate cause in general as that's something that fits into torts, not into somebody who's gonna be put away for life for murder. And we want prefer agency. We think that culpability, uh, matters. So you're saying it's something between civil law and criminal law. I think that there's a difference there. And for that reason we are not trying to defend where the owner gets killed because that's clearly we're culpable. Our client, um, did something in furtherance of his crime. Uh, an owner is trying to protect himself. He went ahead and killed the owner. Uh, that's, that's obviously what we're doing and that's our fault, but the reverse, that's what we want to defend because the fact that co-defendant got killed doesn't help us. It's not what we wanted. It doesn't aid us, it's not in furtherance of our crime and most importantly from an agency perspective, which matters who did the killing, our defendant did not do this killing, didn't pull the trigger on this fully foreseeable. Fully foreseeable, certainly not. If it was maybe foreseeable is a question, but that so you don't want a foreseeability standard. I don't. I see that as proximate cause. OK, the foreseeability just becomes proximate cause. OK, so then what is your argument knock out? In other words, on this table here, what is it, what does it knock out? Does it knock out any of these offenses if the defendant kills the victim, an innocent bystander, or a co-defendant? Um, probably not. If the defendant is the killer, then they were the agent, and I can't say that, hey, my person didn't, there's no agency actually. I mean, so if there's no agency, there's no principal agency relationship. Right? OK, for a principal agency relationship to exist, there need to be two people, and one person is the principal, the other person is the agent, the other person is doing things in furtherance of the principal's directions, and intentions. OK, um. Query about this one, but let's go on for a second. Uh, does it apply to a co-defendant? Is your agency co-defendant kills? Is there, is there liability here under the agency theory? I think so. I think I could. Yes, see my, my defendant did it. Yes, you already conceded it. In your earlier thing, OK, now what then becomes, what, what, what rows get knocked out? The 3rd, 4th, and 5th. The 3rd, 4th, and 5th rows get knocked out under the agency theory. OK. All right, now. Are there, is there, are there any cells in this table that you would say that the um proximate cause standard excludes, or are you saying it applies everywhere? Well, I'd love to have it apply everywhere, but I think the strongest argument would probably be the third row, because in a case like this, um, if, if the target of the family, why is that more so than the 4th row. Well, I feel that in I don't know how translatable it might be into, into the facts of Baxter, but we, I think we've established that the, uh, you know, holding somebody liable for, for their, um, oh well then that would be a co-defendant killing. Well, uh, that would be, so the Baxter case would be co-defendant co-defendant killed bystander, innocent bystander, yes, right. Um, Now how do you deal with Baxter? Thanks. You've given yourself the tough case. How do you deal with Baxter? I think under the proximate cause theory, the prosecution would still like to hold Baxter liable for the death of the two cyclists. And they did. And he's serving a long sentence. Yes. Um, What would be, what would be your defense, um, what would be your defense in the Baxter, uh, situation, uh, sorry, Carl. That's not the shield case, right? That is the, um, New Yorker article case, the Sarah Stillman case. That's the guy who's breaking into cars and then his co-defendant, the cops come, he gets in a car, he drives away and he kills two cyclists. Oh yeah, so I mean our argument there is that even on a proximate cause theory, it's like he's starting a new act when he gets into the car. And runs away. That's not part of the, um, commission of the initial felony. I think that they were doing them separately to begin with different cars in the first place. Uh, OK. All right, um, so you might want to draw a distinction between. Um, I don't know how that distinction holds because basically I think, I mean it's not clear that the co-defendant, it's not clear if I recall from the from the New York New Yorker article that the co-defendant was actually as comfortable breaking into cars to try and steal stuff from the cars as Baxter was. I had this impression that Baxter was doing it, but The co-defendant was kind of. Sitting back a little bit. Not on the front lines, as someone would say. And that he somehow, but, but that the police come and at that point. Who was, who's my Sarah Stillman article person? You were. The police come and then what he gets in, he gets in a, he is he stealing a car? He's just, or he's just run, he's just driving away. I think he's Sorry, um, I think at that point he is. Trying to get away. I don't think he's still breaking into the cars at that point. OK, he, um, let's see, I think that's right. It's Haley, right? Yeah, no, sorry. Oh, Aditi, Aditi, yeah, sorry, um, so, uh, yeah, I think he's, he's just in, in, in his car getting away. What he does, I think, is he, he, he screws up and he goes around the neighborhood and makes a big circle and then appears in front of the. Place where the victim is complaining and the cops are there and the victim identifies the car and then they chase and then he engages in the accident. OK, so um. So it seems as if it might be the same crime. You might not be able to distinguish the crimes, but it's also, I guess, not a. I guess the, the, the, um, co-defendant wasn't. Uh, wasn't a murder, I, I guess, or? Well, the co-defendant isn't the one who rams into the bicyclist, but the co-defendant was engaging in the same crime from which the other co-defendant was fleeing. It's, I take it it's foreseeable that fleeing, that you would flee from a crime. Uh, I, what, what would your, what, Jeremy, what would your argument for the prosecution sound like here?

SPEAKER 4
Um, so I, I, you mean to uphold the felony murder conviction? Um, I mean, I guess I would say that, um, I mean, it was foreseeable that when, uh, I guess when Baxter, um. Engaged in the kind of felony with um with his co-defendant that the co-defendant um. Had the possibility of, I guess, um, I guess trying to evade the police and then, um, taking that sort of so and the question becomes is it foreseeability or

SPEAKER 0
is it possibly in furtherance of right could it be a question of in furtherance and in furtherance, I mean, and it's possible that fleeing after a crime would be in furtherance of the crime or something like that, right, um. Uh, OK, so, so under a, under, under, under a proximate cause theory you're, you're strong on Baxter. You guys are trying to create some light between the defendant and the co-defendant in the Baxter case. Um, uh, Estefania, what does that sound like? What is your best argument? The agency theory. So I would say that Baxter didn't commit the vehicular manslaughter himself, so he should not be held liable for that. But that's gonna be true. That's gonna be true of anybody in these. Boxes. That's going to be true for anybody in box 2 in rows 2345. He didn't commit it himself. But in, but in, uh, but in canola, you guys are conceding that this. would be Felony murder. So the fact that he didn't commit it himself isn't enough. Right, I mean that's how the felony murder rule applies. So it's gotta be something more than that he didn't commit it himself. Right. What more is that? Well, in the, the article he speaks about how Baxter was already in the police car and so there was like that framing of if he was already, um, captured or what I don't like that language, but like if he was already in handcuffs whether or not he could have been held. Liable for a death that occurred while he was already in custody. Yeah, so the timing seems really problematic, right? I mean, he is in police custody, right? Alicia, anything more?

SPEAKER 1
Um, I mean, I would also, um, add that I think the felony murder rule applies when you're doing the unlawful activity and so because he was in handcuffs he was no longer performing that unlawful activity so I would imagine that there was no transfer of that mens rea for that intent.

SPEAKER 0
OK. And so I wonder if you can make the argument, I'm not sure here. I'm wondering if you can make the argument somehow that. It's a I don't know. What do you think of this prosecutors? There's a different crime going on here. It's kind of like one is breaking into cars, the other is evading and. Evading arrest. Yeah, is that what you're saying? There's a different crimes. There's a different underlying crime. Um, and, and, and his Baxter's co-defendant is getting convicted for. Breaking into cars, but then evading arrest. Whereas Baxter is not evading arrest, he is under arrest. What do you think of that? Yes, I think an argument could be made that a when in consideration of a from prosecution side, I personally think it's a little, but uh in a in felony murder you care in um. Uh, yeah, the state is paying my wage. Anyways, um, uh, in felony and murder cases, I think, um, I guess to borrow from the terms, uh, felonies should be considered, you know, same transactional occurrence, so I guess, right, running away. Very much arguably running away from the police is a an integral part of committing any sort of felony because you wouldn't be committing, so, so you're gonna do everything you can to kind of merge the uh escape the the escape into the whatever the the police chase into the original crime and say that's all part of one thing. And that's interesting because actually you'll, we'll see when we um. Do. Um, kind of complicity later on that there is, I mean there is a temporal dimension to some of this stuff. You'll, we'll see when we do complicity later on that you can be an accomplice before the fact. Or you can be, you, some people can be accomplice after the fact, meaning now, and we've gotten rid of that rule mostly in US jurisdictions, but there is this idea that you could have like not participated in the robbery, but then later on you could, you know, harbor a fugitive, say, you know, the robber comes to your place and it's like, hey, I just robbed this joint, the police are coming after me. I need a place to store my gun and I need to hide in your closet. And if you say yes, well, now, is that, you know, are you now part of the original robbery? A lot of jurisdictions will say no, it used to be the case, accomplice after the fact, yes, that, that was all just, just as bad. But now it's more of a separate kind of, you know, harboring a fugitive or something like that. It's not really that you are responsible for the actual robbery itself, OK? And here there's something of that dimension. There's a, there's an interesting temporal dimension to this, right, precisely what you guys are arguing, Alicia. And um Alicia and Estefania that like there's a break maybe right at the because he is in he is in detention when this is happening it seems hard to understand how you could be held guilty we'll see this in the Pininkerton rule also. In the Pinkerton case, which is also about conspiracy and complicity, it's about these brothers. One of them is in prison. They're they're bootleggers basically, and one of them is in prison, and the question is whether the one in prison is responsible for all of the bootlegging that the brother is doing. I mean they had been bootleggers together. Um, but so can you be, yeah, but now, OK, now, so here we would be fighting over this and these temporal issues, um, but you get the sense, you, you understand, so, um, uh, back to you Ming Cheng, is there any, any box here that is not included then? In the process, so you just, you've just added Baxter, right? Is there any box that would not be included on a kind of um. On a proximate cause. Actually, now that I think of it, probably not, because I think especially within the fact of canola, when you and a gang of robbers walking into a store with arms uh with guns, you should probably. Expect resistance from either the target, the owner of the store, or if the police gets involved, the police or innocent bystanders who also happen to be armed. OK, so in other words, all of this is kind of foreseeable, right? It's a lot of it would be in furtherance of the crime. And but those would be the questions that you would be asking possibly at some extreme limit along those dimensions and furtherance of the crime or foreseeable you might say, OK, wait, no, that goes a little bit too far. You might even be willing to say Baxter goes a little bit too far because it was, um, you know, because there was some, I mean it's not in furtherance of the of the breaking in or whatever or or something like that, but, but pretty much you're everywhere and. For the defense, basically you're trying to knock out places where the person who does the killing. The victim, police officers or a bystander are not agents, are not are not working with the defendant and so these things get knocked out completely. You wouldn't be held responsible for these offenses and you might also. You might also wonder about when the co-defendant is a victim, whether that was in fact whether. I mean, If a co-defendant kills another co-defendant, You might be saying, wait a minute, that wasn't in furtherance of our agency relationship here. Right? I mean, because the notion of agency is that somehow someone is doing something for you. In furtherance of your project. Right? OK. All right. OK. So, um, and as you see the court, oh OK, well you see what the court does in Canola. Um, but you'll notice that the law changes and then, and then basically like the New York penal law in the squib after the case starts to actually designate everyone who could or could not based on a, based on these charts so you can look at the New York. Penal law, for instance. And figure out, OK, wait, it's in course in furtherance of designated felony, he or another participant, OK, causes the death of a person other than one of the participants. OK, so death of participants goes out, co-defendant victims go out, right? On that, on that understanding, right? Or in New Jersey, any person. Causes the death of any person other than one of the participants. OK, so that last column goes out co-defendant victim goes out. So you can kind of use this chart to figure out how your statute applies to all the different possible permutations of the death. OK, all right, let's move on. Um, let's move on to um. Unintended or uh reckless homicide, unintended killings, OK? So the first case we're looking at here and, and what we're, what we're talking about now are a uh different category of homicide. Although it's very close to felony murder, right? In fact, under the Model Penal Code, felony murder is extreme recklessness. It's just demonstrated by the underlying felony, OK, so we're looking at cases where there's either extreme recklessness or simple recklessness. OK, so we're looking at a case that basically is either going to be described as murder. Even though it's unintended. But because it is grossly negligent. Or a case that's going to be described as involuntary manslaughter because it was reckless. So we're looking at the difference between Extreme recklessness and recklessness, OK? In the Model Penal Code, very quickly in the Model Penal Code. Uh, Bailey. In the model penal code. What is, what is extreme recklessness? Uh, homicide. Homicide that gives you that is, that is by extreme recklessness. Did you get a sense? What would that be called if a homicide is committed with extreme recklessness, and we're gonna be going straight to um. Malone. Uh, so, let's see, Henry. Henry, Julia, Matty, OK, we're going to Malone. OK, um, Extreme recklessness is um. Is it 2nd degree murder? Um, are you, what, where, where are you in your, are you in front of your model penal code? Mhm. OK. Are you at the back of your book? At the back of the book, yes, OK, all right. The model penal code doesn't have degrees, remember. So what would it be called? What section would it fall under, say? Um, the murder section, section 210.2. Go ahead, 2 210, 210.2, yeah, OK, so it's murder. If it's extremely reckless, committed with recklessness under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life, then the person would be charged with murder. Right, if the person is just being charged with a crime, a homicide that is committed recklessly, what would that be? Um, manslaughter, manslaughter, yes, section 210.3. OK, so we're, we're navigating between murder and manslaughter. Murder and manslaughter and it's unintentional, it's involuntary, it's not, no, it's not involuntary in the sense of an involuntary act. It's involuntary in the sense that it was not an it was an unintentional act. It was not, it was an unintentional act. OK, the Malone case, um, was it an unintentional act, uh, Maddie. Uh, let's see, you know what? Uh, why don't you guys be the prosecutors for a second and, and give me some defense on this, Tolliver, in a second, OK? You're the prosecutors. Was it an intentional act?

SPEAKER 2
Um, I don't think that it's being argued that it was intentional, right.

SPEAKER 0
So, uh, was there intentionality here? Yes. What was the intentionality?

SPEAKER 2
Um, he put the gun up to, is it Billy's side and pulled the trigger 3 times.

SPEAKER 0
And what was intentional there? Um, he was joking, pulling the trigger, pulling the trigger, yeah, right? He pulls the trigger 3 times. Those are intentional pulls of the trigger, yeah, right. Tolliver. Defense counsel. Do you contest that? I don't contest the pulling of the trigger, but the reason for which it was pulled, I do. OK. All right, so you're not contesting. You're not contesting the intentionality of the pulling of the trigger, is that what you're saying? No, I am. Oh, you are. Yeah, OK, so, so, so you're not, you're not contesting that he pulled the trigger, yeah, yeah, but you are contesting that it was an intentional act. Yeah. Why? Um, how? I'd say the nature of it was within the context of a game, and he was joking, um, and when he switched the chamber, or I don't really know how guns work, but when he, when he, um, turned it, I guess counterclockwise, he did not think, um, that that was actually the chamber that the bullet was in. OK, um, all right, so. Just to understand. A gun in this situation. Uh, this is a revolver. And a revolver er has this cylinder that turns around, that, that turns each time you pull the trigger, it'll turn one more, right? And this apparently is a 5 cylinder uh chamber. It's got 5 chambers. This, uh, this, this, this revolver, according to, it's not clear actually the court, um, but it it is. And The cylinders move in a particular direction, clockwise or counterclockwise, actually depending on the manufacturer of the gun. So the Smith and Wesson goes counterclockwise. We're most used to a Smith and Wesson gun. The 32 caliber police positive revolver with 6 shots goes clockwise, OK. And what you're arguing is that when he put the bullet in the. In the chamber. What? He then twisted it so that when he fired, he believed that he was not firing with the bullet in the chamber. OK, he put the chamber, I think he put it in the first one on the right. Believing that it was a clockwise cylinder rotation. And therefore, if in fact he put it in the first one in the right, and it was a clockwise cylinder rotation. He could have pulled the trigger how many times? The total of 5, he could have, well, since they're 5 cylinders, I think he could have, I mean 5 chambers, whatever, he could have pulled it 44 times, and it shouldn't have, it shouldn't have fired, right? OK, so what you're saying is he. was certain. Let's say he was certain. That the bullet, that the gun was not going to fire a live, a live bullet. OK. All right. What, how does that do, what does that do though to intentionality, Cole? Co-counsel. Um, Didn't he still, didn't he still intentionally pull that trigger? Yeah, he intentionally pulled the trigger, but like in terms of the disagree with your co-counsel, uh, maybe, uh, not disagree, maybe just looking at it from a different vantage point, um, but I, I would say maybe like not like intentionally pulled the trigger, sure, but the outcome of that action was unintended. And in fact, like you could argue unforeseeable as well, if he pulls it 3 times, and the, and the gun has 5 chambers, it doesn't even, I can't even understand how on the 3rd pole. The bullet would fire if it was immediately to the right, whether or not it was clockwise or counterclockwise. So what about that, Henry, prosecutor. Um, what, how, how, what happened here? Uh, isn't it unforeseeable?

SPEAKER 5
Well, I have a few points to make, uh. Number 1, like, you're meant to treat guns as loaded, even if you are 100% certain that they're not. This is fairly common knowledge, I would say. And if you, if this isn't something that the defendant had known, he should have known it or he should have known that he shouldn't have been handling a loaded weapon if he didn't know how to have known it.

SPEAKER 0
You're arguing, Henry. That's correct. Alexander, what do you respond? I mean, I just don't understand why he should have known that the bullet, no, no, no, no, no. No. He said, he should have known it. He said, he just said he should have known it. Should have, wait, should have known what? Should have known the, the danger. Should have known, should have known the risk. Should have known, he should have known the risk that he was that he was doing. I would still say that if he's putting the bullet in the last chamber, it's typical that a gun would fire just one chamber at a time. OK, so you're fighting the facts, so you're, you're fighting the fact. You're fighting his fact. You're saying No, he exercised some kind of reasonable care by putting it in the right chamber and It's he, he, he should have known, no, you're saying no, he, he couldn't have known. In fact, something, something. What's the polite way to say this? Fucked up about the gun, and we don't know what happened. It doesn't make sense. It doesn't make sense that on the 3rd pull, the gun would have fired the bullet. He was dead certain. That there wasn't any risk. Because of where he put the live bullet. Which, by the way, was it his bullet? No, it was the deceased. It was the father's bullet's bullet, right? So let's get Let's get a little bit reasonable, I mean, about, you know, assigning blame here, OK. He, he went to the diner with an empty gun. Tragedy, it's a tragedy. It's a total tragedy. It's a total tragedy. But he didn't even go there with a live gun, OK? It's the victim who brought that bullet from his father's military arsenal. Right? OK, So you're fighting the fact, but can you fight the law? Co-counsel. Co-counsel, uh, Nadia. Um, what aspect of the law do you want me to fight? Like, I think prosecutor Henry just said. He should have known. I think he shouldn't have. I don't think that. What it should have sound like? I don't think he could have reasonably been expected to. Why? Because he is 17. No, no, because recklessness doesn't require. Requires more than just reasonableness. Prosecutor Henry just said. It's, it's, it, it was a reasonable person should have known. That's not where we are. We're not in the negligence category here. We're not in negligent homicide. We're talking about murder. So there should be manslaughter, so there should be a willful disregard precisely because recklessness requires that he. Be aware of. It's not just that it be that a reasonable person. So you, so your response to the prosecutor is, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, we're not in this, we're not in any, we're not in the civil domain and we're not in the negligence domain. We're not negligent homicide, that's not, I mean you want to charge that? Maybe we'll talk, alright, we can talk about that. Maybe we could settle the case actually if you want to do negligent, negligent homicide, might, might actually, you know. OK, but it's not. Recklessness, and it's not recklessness with extreme indifference to human life because recklessness requires awareness. So, prosecutor, you guys need to argue, I take it, defense counsel says that he, was aware of this risk, more than just a reasonable person. So how do you, how do you respond? Henry and co-counsel Julia.

SPEAKER 5
Um, I guess what I would say first of all is that the should there is less of a reference to a reasonable person and more a reference to like this specific defendant in this specific position. Like, he, we're treating this like it's some sort of freak accident, but at the end of the day, he knew that this was a gun. Guns are meant to kill people. He knew that this was a gun that had a bullet in it. So, like, you know, So he had to be aware

SPEAKER 0
of a big risk here, right, like, OK, and how big, and OK, he, he had to be aware, I mean like. How old is he?

SPEAKER 5
17.

SPEAKER 0
17. You have to be aware that there's a risk here. Right? How big was the risk, Julia? Considering that the gun was brought by a 13 year old and he didn't know, I think he brought the gun. The bullet was brought by the 13 year old, I think, yeah, sorry, the bullet, but, and he didn't know how the gun was handled. There was something in the afternoon before the firing of the gun, so I think like he, the gun wasn't like in his possession the whole time before that, so he didn't know whether there was only one bullet or more. Hmm, OK. OK. OK. And assuming there was only one bullet, what's the risk? What was the risk? How big a risk was there here? Pulling the trigger in this way, the way he did. Can you actually Can you actually quantify the risk? Can we actually say how much risk there was like in total, I think 3 out of 53 out of 53 out of 5 would be what? 3 out of 5 if what? Like, uh, when it's 3 possible chambers out of 5 existing chambers, yeah. Um So it turns out, so if he rotated the gun every time, or the first time he rotated it, it would be one chance out of 5. It would be random, right? Yeah, totally random, but he fired it 3 times, so he fired it 3 times in a row. That made it 3 out of 5, so that. Yeah, I think that's functionally right. Yeah, each one, assuming each one is randomly at 20%, by the third one you're getting at 60%. So you're saying. You and Henry are saying, look, you had to be aware of the risk and the risk here is pretty much off the freaking charts. We're talking about 60% chance here of the gun going off, right? 60% chance of the gun going off. OK, so how do you respond to that, Maxwell? Uh, I think I'd go back to what co-counsel, uh, Alex said, uh, about how in his mind he believed there was no chance that there was a bullet that he was actually firing. And why is that a good argument? Uh, because it's what he thought in the moment. It is like it's because intention, because there's a subjective element to the requirement. Because, because if you look at, you know, if you look at a typical kind of recklessness thing, if you look at the recklessness page for the Model Penal Code, right, he consciously disregards the substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element exists, OK? Consciously disregards well, you're saying, sure. There was this risk which was manifested by the fact that it was a 60% and that he kills his friend. Yes, there was an unjustifiable, it might have been an unjustifiable risk. It might have been a substantial risk. It might have been a huge Risk. It was a huge risk, but basically he had to be subjectively aware of this, and he himself was not subjectively aware of this. He was not consciously disregarding that risk. Why wasn't he consciously disregarding that risk? Because he didn't, it wasn't in his consciousness, because he believed that he had safely put the bullet in that first chamber to the right and with a, Clockwise rotating cylinder, he could have pulled the trigger 4 times. It never would have shot. OK, right? Um, all right, and so what you're doing with this case is you're kind of, you're, you're first you're going back and forth with actually what is the, what is the risk in this case, and remarkably this is probably the only case you'll ever have in your life where it's quantifiable like this. It really is quantifiable, although actually it's not, I mean something went wrong with the gun. There's no explanation. There's no good explanation for. For what happened Unless, unless he thought he was putting it in the 1st chamber and he was actually putting it in the 3rd chamber. Or, yeah, he, he thought he was putting it in the first chamber and then when he er closes the cylinder, it flipped forward to. Maybe that's what happened. Who knows? Or maybe there was a, you know, as the prosecution said, maybe someone had left a, a bullet in there. I mean, that's always the danger with guns, right? OK. In any event, we've got something about risk, right, and the level of risk is gonna matter, and you'll notice that in this particular case, the court says, um, the court actually finds that there's 60%, but. In the Hall case, if you go to the Hall case, um, Which is the ski slope case People versus Hall, Colorado 2000. It's like page, uh, well, you know where it is, it's in your book, the one that follows, uh, Willansky. Um, you'll notice for instance in the paragraph. In the fourth paragraph there. The district court's conclusion. That Hall's conduct did not represent a substantial and justifiable risk of death rested on an erroneous construction of recklessness that for the risk to be substantial, it must be at least more likely than not that death would result, i.e., for it to be a substantial risk, it has to be more than 50%, right? That's the civil liability standard in a way. Civil liability in order to be held civilly liable, you only have to show that the defendant was more likely than not, that's more than 50%. Of course in the criminal context, it has to be beyond a reasonable doubt, which is more than that. OK, but anyway, that's 50%. And then they say a risk of death that has less than a 50% chance of occurring may nonetheless be a substantial risk depending on the circumstance of the particular case. So basically in the Hall case, the court had said 50% and more, you're basically in the Hall case, the court basically said you have to be on this side on the x axis. OK, you have to be more than 50% in order to be held responsible under some kind of a recklessness standard, whereas what the whole court says is no, no, no, no, no, it's not a strict 50%, right? Something can be substantial at say. I don't know, maybe 20%, maybe 33%, OK, and we don't know what that is, but that's going to be one of the factors. The other factor is going to be whether it's a a subjective standard, right, or an objective standard. In the objective standard you could be clueless. So the kid could have been clueless on the, on, on Henry's original point, kid could have been completely clueless, not knowing what was going on. Doesn't matter. If a reasonable person, OK, so you're gonna have some determination of the kind of subjective versus objective, and then I think another dimension that puts us into a third dimension, so maybe we should think of this whole room, you know, maybe we've got quadrants here, right? This is like, you know, low risk, high risk, subjective, objective, and then another dimension which is how much care did you put into this. And the argument here is that the kid made did some care. He was being careful, he put the gun, he put the he put the bullet on the right hand side, knowing that it was a. Whatever, so he did exercise some kind of care, obviously not enough, but those would be the kind of dimensions that you would be arguing about in a case like um Malone, in a case like Malone, in a case like uh the ski uh uh accident in Hall, right, a ski accident where a. Ski instructor is the defendant, right? So the prosecution would be arguing in the Hall case, right, that This, this guy knew he should have known how dangerous it was. He's a ski instructor, right? He knows the dangers of, um of uh skiing down, uh, going straight down. And uh Taking a jump without knowing who the hell is going to be underneath the. The mogul or whatever. OK, now, uh, in Malone. Then Um, What we get is a Um, notion of gross recklessness, OK? Gross recklessness that, um, that turns it from manslaughter into murder. OK, possibly, OK, um. And um. What we're going to do next is quickly, we're going to talk for 3 minutes about the Willansky case. And then what I want to do on Thursday is for us to talk about the Terrible incident that happened at the ski resort town of Cross Montana in Switzerland on the evening of July 31st. Um, where 41 people were, uh, killed, uh, died as a result of a fire that broke out in a club, uh, in a basement of this resort town, OK. And what we're gonna try and do is kind of figure out how, given the Wolansky case and every everything that you've read, the Wolansky and all of this, how would, how would we think about it, assuming it's say, you know, in the model penal code or something like that, OK, um, and actually here what I'd like is maybe I'm gonna assign some prosecutors and defense counsel to the, uh, Carl Montana case. So Ramia de Salome. You guys are the prosecutors, OK, and you can go out and get as much information about this case as you want, OK? And uh Nilam Talara. You guys are the uh defense counsel, OK? And so get as much information as you can. Uh, the charge is for the husband and wife who own the club. Have you, have you all heard about this case? Yeah Um, terrible incident. Husband and wife are now accused of manslaughter. Um, basically it seems, it seems as if the sparklers, uh, that were. Being used uh inflamed the uh the the the the the ceiling. Um, and there's a lot of questions about whether that was preventable, whether there were any inspections, had any inspections been made, etc. etc. very much like the Willansky case. So you've got the Wolansky case. We're gonna use the Wolansky case as our kind of like background case, and as you know, the Wolansky case was a horrible situation. Um, all of which is trying to tell us whether we get to something like criminal negligence or is it, is it criminal negligence or is it manslaughter, right, is the kind of case and um the the Coconut Grove case was actually a horrid. Uh, situation as you read where the owner was actually there were 492 people who died, 492 people died in this club accident incident. Uh, the owner that night was in the hospital, wasn't even at the club. Right, and the question was whether the owner was liable, either was criminally liable, either for something like manslaughter, reckless manslaughter, or something like negligent homicide. OK, and, um, as you know from that case, it was, uh, it was just horrifying, but they had blocked the exits, um, it, I mean, you know, it was a great commercial venue they had like over 1000 people in this place, but they had blocked the exits, uh, to make it a better venue, um, and, uh. And so, OK, all right, uh, so let's start on Thursday. We'll talk a little bit about Wlansky just to know what the rules are, but then we'll go to the Cole Montana case and try and figure out what's going on there, OK? All right, thanks. For the things you're saying about, can I just clarify again, like when we're talking about negligence, right, for the minimum requirement requirements to convicts of murder. For at least. So the minimum minimum is reckless. that would be. OK. Yeah I know. Yeah. I criminal convictions. Fraud insider trading. for No. OK. OK thank you. Um, really understood the, the subjectivity of the recklessness standard because yes, on the one the subjectivity of the recklessness standard. OK, it's these words.
