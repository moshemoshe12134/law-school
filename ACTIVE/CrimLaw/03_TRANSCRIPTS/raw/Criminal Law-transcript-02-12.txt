I. No, but Yeah. money. G Always so I don't know to say hello. Oh, you could say hello whenever. Really? OK I I You. No. That's very I. I we For them it's. Yeah you All right, everyone, how's everybody doing?

SPEAKER 1
Is this working? Barely.

SPEAKER 0
Barely, barely, barely.

SPEAKER 1
Let's see if we can get some volume here. Had a lot of volume last night in this room. Hello. All right. All right, so, uh, What we're going to do is we're, we're gonna start by um wrapping up our conversation about some of these theories of punishment quickly. Um, and, um, Then push on towards uh Michelle Foucault's book Discipline and Punish. So let's just remember where we were, uh yes uh yesterday or the day before. We were trying to think about how these different theories of punishment might apply in a case like the terrible fire that happened in Comalta uh, um. And so we're using the example, uh, tragically of Jessica Moretti, who was one of the two club owners who we, we saw. Uh, with her extreme remorsefulness on that, on that video and trying to figure out what it would mean, what these different theories of punishment would mean in her particular case, OK? And I think that we were at the point where we were going to discuss questions of rehabilitation and also of incapacitation, OK? And You have to understand that both rehabilitation and incapacitation tend to fit within the framework of a utilitarian punishment theory because in fact, uh, what we are trying to do is achieve some end, achieve an end as a result of the infliction of punishment. Right, we're trying to use punishment. In a utilitarian way to rehabilitate the person, for instance, uh, and um. And turn them into a more productive member of society. Or incapacitate them and make sure that they don't. Do any more harm, OK? Uh, and so they fit squarely in a kind of utilitarian approach because we're not again treating them simply as Ends, but in a way as means towards some greater good, and that greater good might be a more safe society. It might be a more well adjusted citizenry. Right? Um, but those are in some sense, means, things we're using the individual as a means to achieve some greater end. OK. Now, what is that, how does that work in the case of, uh, Jessica Moretti, um. Um, Maya, what do you think? I mean, like, for instance, uh, what would rehabilitation, what would rehabilitation look like in the case of Jessica Moretti, and does it make any sense to think about rehabilitation in that context?

SPEAKER 2
Yeah, it's interesting. I don't really know if it makes sense to think about rehabilitation in this context because. A rehabilitation to me implies that there's some sort of problem like moral issue maybe or like behavioral issue with. The person, like the, the criminal that's like inherent to them that we're trying to fix, but like this is a init a crime of neg negligence, sorry, um, so I'm not really sure like how you rehabilitate negligence, right?

SPEAKER 1
How do you rehabilitate negligence? How do you rehabilitate negligence? How do you rehabilitate negligence? I mean, what would you be working on? I mean, that's the distinction, right? I mean, it's, it's, we're saying that they didn't, she didn't act as a reasonable person would have acted, right? Um, so, so what, what kind of work would we need to do in that particular case?

SPEAKER 2
Um At some sort of like. Method of making them more aware of like what is expected from society. I'm not really sure, honestly, um.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, uh, defense counsel Neilam, um. What, what do you, what do you think?

SPEAKER 3
I guess in terms of rehabilitation, something that you could focus on, I don't know if this would apply specifically here, but like to working on fire safety awareness, some degree of like awareness towards you think that she's now

SPEAKER 1
aware?

SPEAKER 3
I think she'd be hyper-aware given the crime. So maybe rehabilitation is not sort of necessary. In the sense that she already will be aware when she goes back into society, no extra programming is needed to help her, right?

SPEAKER 1
I mean, we saw her really remorseful, right? I mean, she, I mean, like, could you imagine? I mean, she feels responsible. She is, she is responsible for the death of 41 people. I mean, it's not as if, it's not as if she's. I mean, maybe if she were kind of saying, hey, it was no big deal, I don't care, it's not my problem, it was somebody else's problem or something like that. Um, you'll notice that actually uh they're filing criminal investigations and possibly charges now against the um. The head of the Kind of safety, uh, safety department for the canton and a former fire inspector, right? I mean, so I mean it could be that she's, it could be that someone in that position says, look, it wasn't my, it wasn't my fault. I don't, I don't, I, you know, it wasn't my fault. They should have done their work. Nobody inspected the place, but, but I mean it, it looks as if she's taking responsibility for this, right? And I can't imagine from a rehabilitation perspective, something more powerful than actually what the tragedy that she's gone through in terms of making her aware at this point of the dangers that are associated with this behavior. So So it is hard to imagine. Particularly in the in the in the negligence context, but particularly given. The situation that she herself has experienced, that there could be any. Purpose in kind of rehabilitation more than more than whatever she's experiencing herself. Now, as you read in in the materials um on rehabilitation uh in the piece by Michael Vitiello. And then also the discussion by Michael Moore, um, there's a long history to this idea of rehabilitation. It goes back to the 19th century, and we, we hear it well in discipline and punish, right? It is the in discipline and punish, it's the, it's the motivating kind of way of thinking about punishment that comes into place in the 19th century. Uh, it's based on a penitential model. Uh, actually, the first prisons in the United States were penitentiaries, um. Uh, Auburn in the state of New York, these kind of modern, modern prisons were built as penitentiaries with this idea of rehabilitating people. The Chestnut Street Jail in Philadelphia and Auburn were the product of Quaker reform that, um. We're trying to create a space where someone could gain self-consciousness. Uh, and so in a lot at that time actually there were two models going on, one in which individuals worked by themselves in isolation all day and lived in isolation at night. These were isolated confinement places of penitence. Another model, people would work together in collectivity during the day, although there would be no communication, so it would be in silence, but then they would be alone at night, so a modified form of isolation, and the idea was that they would commune with their souls, with God. I mean there was a religious template here. And, um, and it produced, uh, a whole disciplinary model in the 19th century that we're gonna talk about in, in Foucault, but that is the that is the kind of origin of rehabilitation, a disciplinary model, um, it gives rise then to all kinds of psychiatric, um, sciences, uh, and. To all kinds of programs for psychiatric treatment, for work, uh, work being a form of rehabilitation. And then ultimately it comes to a climax in the United States, at least in the early 1970s when there's a famous study that's issued to the effect that basically nothing works. OK, um, that study is actually a tragic story because it was the sociologist was a very, a very progressive sociologist. He'd been a freedom rider and um. And he, he didn't expect that the work was going to have this effect, but it had the effect of kind of gutting all of the rehabilitation programs that the United States had around the country pretty much. And tragically, he actually committed suicide ultimately as a result of the kind of consequences of what happened with his study. But in any event, uh, and gradually in the past decades or so there's been a bit of a return of rehabilitative programs in the United States, particularly through what's called kind of specialty courts, uh, and so, uh, a lot of times now different jurisdictions will have a specialty, a drug treatment a drug court, um, or a domestic violence court. These are specialized courts and. As a result of their specialization, they then tend to kind of push people into kind of rehabilitative programs either for drug treatment or for anger management, abuse, um, and other things like that so uh there's a bit of a return in a kind of specialized context, but for the most part we've given up on. For the most part we've given up on rehabilitation. I mean it used to be the case that there would be, um, like where I practice in Alabama, there would be, uh, all kinds of work programs associated with a large prison, you know, um, Holman Prison. Uh, which is one of the largest prisons where there's death row, you know, they would have, uh, they would have a furniture shop and a tag shop where they'd be making, you know, license plates and all kinds of kind of like work programs that were intended to get people skills, electrical shop, etc. Pretty much all of that doesn't exist anymore. Uh, it's been gutted and the only kind of the only kind of. Uh, rehabilitation that you can get pretty much today is, uh, Bible studies, you know, I mean, it's, uh, it's very, that's, it's all kind of, um. Um Churches coming in. Giving courses on. On the Bible.

SPEAKER 0
OK.

SPEAKER 1
But, but in a case like Moretti, it's like, it does just doesn't seem as if it doesn't speak to the, to the case very well, right? Um, all right. And then incapacitation, uh, so what do we think here about incapacitation, Joshua?

SPEAKER 4
Like if. The defendant here, yeah, should we be thinking that that

SPEAKER 1
would be an appropriate rationale for incarcerating, say, someone like Jessica Moretti?

SPEAKER 4
I would say no, and I feel like. My reasoning is based off of Bentham's reasoning about the proportionality of punishment just because I feel like in this situation. The punishment of, I guess. Social embarrassment is proportional enough and if she were to be Incapacitated for this, it would just be. Overblown and therefore in Bentham's words, I guess evil.

SPEAKER 1
OK, OK. All right. Now, how far does that argument go? Does that argument go so far as to say that actually there should be no punishment in this case, that Mrs. Moretti has been sufficiently punished by the fact that she is responsible for the death of 41 people?

SPEAKER 4
I think it depends on who you ask because Um, if I were looking at this from the point of view of the next of kin of the victims of the fire, then obviously the argument doesn't go far at all, uh, but as As someone who is, I guess, a bit more removed and. Someone who has seen the remorse that she has shown. I think, uh, the argument that Social embarrassment is punishment enough, it might go a bit further.

SPEAKER 1
And how should we include the question of the victim's sentiment in this case, right? Um, on the prosecution side, Camille, what do you think? How do the, how do we factor in. What the families of the victims, uh, are, are feeling and. How should we, what, what do we factor in in terms of. These different kinds of punish theories of punishment.

SPEAKER 5
Well, in terms of incapacitation, I would be concerned if I were, um, representing the victims and the families or just their families that even if we were to like, not imprison them, Um, If they were to go into another line of business or something like that, that they would continue this type of, um, negligent behavior and then lead to more issues and things like that.

SPEAKER 1
OK, so what would that militate for then? What would you argue there in terms of kind of punishment?

SPEAKER 5
Um Well, thinking about rehabilitation, like maybe. Um, to what Neilan was saying, OK, sorry, sorry, so

SPEAKER 1
what you just said is, I thought interesting because it seems to me like one punishment that we could think of then is, you know, you can't have a license to, to, to have a club, or, um, you can't, you know, you can't engage in any activity that put, that puts other people at risk or, or something. I'm not sure how you would. Um, phrase that. But, but what about a punishment like that? What about, what about a punishment saying you, you can't have a license anymore? You can't have a, an entertainment license anymore, right?

SPEAKER 5
I mean, I, I think. As prosecution that could potentially be. A solution, because then at least they're not going to prison for life for all these people's deaths, and they could still be as like, because of the remorse they showed and everything, they could still be a productive member of society. Um, and then maybe that speaks more to like the rehabilitative, uh, potential here where they could, like, I remember my brother got a crazy speeding ticket and he had to go to classes. And I don't know if it made him a better driver, but Maybe because, hopefully, um, but maybe because of obviously all the death and destruction that occurred. Um, in the combination of remorse and the opportunity to still be a productive member of society, then they would take like those rehabilitative opportunities more seriously.

SPEAKER 1
Right, yeah, yeah, yeah. Now, one could say, well, actually, so that sounds like a good idea, but maybe it needs to be combined with some, maybe it needs to be combined with something else, because it, it doesn't. It doesn't, again, it, it doesn't really address the question of what the victims, but it does address the question of like how society could protect itself against this kind of thing, right? And in part the incapacitation logic is a logic of what's called kind of social defense, the idea of society protecting itself, OK? You get that idea of social defense actually in the Michael Moore reading in the, uh, in the second Michael Moore reading. So you know, we have a few Michael Moore readings, but in the, in the one on rehabilitation, uh, you get a sense that this is that rehabilitation is an idea but we're, we're here to protect society. That's the objective. The purpose of punishment is to protect society. It shouldn't, it shouldn't be to do blameworthiness or moral equations or rectifying moral failure. It's just to protect society. That's why we'll lock somebody up. The only reason you have to lock somebody up is that they can't commit. A crime On the outside. But at least, right, um, now, um. Uh The rehabilitation, the, the, uh, sorry, the incapacitation logic, uh, the incapacitation logic. Uh, has You know, it works, uh, automatically. In terms of. Uh, harm in the outside world, although obviously it doesn't say anything about what's going on within the confines of, of the prison. Um, it came to the fore in the 1960s with theories about the 6%. Um, and so basically a lot of, and, and you, you read this in the, um, In the Uh, Vitiello piece, right, um, that basically, um. No, sorry, you read this in the DeLo, in the DeLo piece. Uh, John DeLo was a big advocate of this. The idea was that actually it's a small number of people who commit. Many crimes. Supposedly Uh, that's actually, so in social science, you find that a lot. It's called the J curve. I don't know for those of you who are kind of social science and oriented, but it's this idea that, for instance, in terms of police officers who actually fire guns. Turns out that it's not just a random distribution, it's not just a normal curve, it's a J curve, which means that there are most police officers don't fire guns. There's a small group of police officers who fire guns a lot, so that's the curve. And the idea of really of incapacitation or selective incapacitation was that there's about 6% of the population that commits 50% of the crime in society. That was the kind of the scientific social scientific argument. And so it would be much more efficient if we simply inc incarcerated, incapacitated that small 6% of the population. You could, you know, you could knock out 50% of crime in, in, in the country if you did that. That was the argument, um, and, and the argument was, you know, it would also save money, right, because. You can get rid, you can, you can let the rest of the people out. As long as you're putting those 6% in. The problem is that it resulted in mass incarceration instead, so it kind of resulted in justifying increased incarceration at a scale that was not really limiting it to the 6%. Uh, but that was the, that was the logic, um. And uh Uh, but in a case like this, right, so then in a case like this, you would. You would wonder whether you know the Moretti's fall in that 6%, um, whether it makes sense or but at this point the major question is, you know, has, has the lesson been learned or if you take the person's license would that solve the problem they're not gonna be doing anything like this again, etc. etc. OK, all right, so, um. So we have these different theories. And what you'll notice about them is that they're At odds. They're not intended to, they're not intended to, as it were, work together, they are in conflict most of the time. Uh, the retributive arguments about moral dessert. are radically In conflict with the utilitarian arguments about benefiting society, right? Those are just. Clashing with each other. And it's definitely clashing, I think, in the Moretti case, because it seems to me as if on the, on the moral, on the retribution side, there's a very weak argument. The only possible, the strongest argument in this case is something like deterrence for other people. Right? I mean, that seems to be the single strongest argument. In fact, the other arguments. Uh, some kind of Kantian retribution argument, uh, rehabilitation, those weigh in favor of not punishing, uh, Mr. and Mrs. Moretti. But deterrence does. I mean, at least I think in this case, if you could get a big bang of deterrence and, and people really start to be careful about clubs and nightlife and fire hazards and nightlife, that would be a good thing. Do you get a sense of what the, uh, the model penal code and the statutes do with all of these punishment theories, um, Rohan?

SPEAKER 6
You mean in general, like, yeah, which one do they,

SPEAKER 1
which one do they embrace?

SPEAKER 6
Deterrence, maybe?

SPEAKER 1
Where'd you get that?

SPEAKER 6
Uh, OK, I didn't really have like a specific line. OK, so you go to the model penal code.

SPEAKER 1
OK, sure. What the heck? Might as well go to the thing. And uh you look at, uh, you try and find something about the purposes of punishment. Turns out you go to the general provisions, right? Because that's the, it's going to be the general provisions that would have that. And you find section 102 that says purposes. OK, purposes, principles of construction. OK. So basically the model penal code, and i.e. every penal code that's out there will have a section that will tell you what they think is the right way to think about punishment. And what do you get a sense? What, what, what, what does it seem like?

SPEAKER 6
Uh, maybe incapacitation. I mean, just looking at one, I mean, it says to prevent conduct that inflicts or threatens substantial harm to individual or public interests. To subject to public control people who indicate that they're disposed to commit crimes.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah. So, so, but do you see, you see the word incapacitation, don't you? In little, little I2, the two little eye, uh, when reasonably feasible. What version of the, what version of the code do you have? What version of the book do you have?

SPEAKER 6
I have the 11th, 11th, OK, um, so I think

SPEAKER 1
it's, uh. Uh, there's a, is there a little passage there that says when reasonably feasible to achieve offender rehabilitation.

SPEAKER 6
I mean, it says them all, right? Rehabilitation, deterrence, incapacitation. It says to achieve what did you just say. It says them all.

SPEAKER 1
Thank you. What the hell does that mean?

SPEAKER 6
Uh They want to check all the boxes.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, they kind of do check all the boxes, don't they? Yeah. I mean they got, they got rehabilitation if I'm not mistaken actually they got rehabilitation they got deterrence. I got the, I see the word deterrence. I see the word incapacitation. I see the word reintegration. I see the blameworthiness. Right? Yeah. So So basically they got them all. They got them all. So what's our theory of punishment here? Are we Benthamite or Kantian? Incapacitators. Rehabilitators, what are we? A mix like a mix, a smorgasbord. A little bit of this, a little bit of that, right? A little bit of this, a little bit of that, actually a little bit of everything. OK, so for Moretti, we're gonna do a little bit of the blameworthiness, we're gonna do a little bit of the rehabilitation, we're a little bit of the deterrence, we're gonna do this, we're gonna do that. And when they conflict, well, we're gonna do a little bit of this, we're gonna do. It's meaningless No, It's totally meaningless to say that these are the purposes of punishment, to put all of them in here. Gives us absolutely no guidance. It gives us no idea what we're doing with this penal code. Because we have, we're just, we're just, you can just justify anything you want. Right. It's, in effect, it's the total breakdown. Of punishment theory. It, there's, there's no, you just, just toss it all away, make any argument you want. Right It's totally outrageous, but not unexpected. Actually, Friedrich Nietzsche predicted this. And diagnosed it in 1887. Alright, in the genealogy of morals, in the 2nd section of the genealogy of in the 2nd essay of the genealogy of morals. Chapter section 12. A word more, he writes in 1887, a word more on the origin and the purposes of punishment. Two problems which are or ought to be kept distinct, but which unfortunately usually lumped into one. And what tactics have our moralists employed up to the present in these cases? The inveterate naivete. They find some purpose in punishment. For instance, revenge or deterrence. And then in all their innocence they set that purpose. At the beginning, as if it was the cause of the, of the theory of punishment, and They've done the trick. Right? Perhaps, he writes, there is no more pregnant principle for any kind of history than the following. The origin of the existence of a thing and its purpose, its practical application, it's incorporation into system of ends. Are just opposites from each other. All of these purposes, he argues. All of the ways that we think about these purposes are actually just the imposition of. What he says is a will to power. Right? It's just When, when you end up saying, oh. We're gonna punish people because of deterrence or we're gonna punish people because of rehabilitation. It's just that you've managed to kind of pull the wool over other people. Right, and imposed your particular will over others. He writes in this really uh beautiful passage. Um He writes, The evolution of a thing of a custom is anything but its progresses towards an end. It is rather the succession of processes of subjugation, more or less profound, more or less mutually independent, right? He writes essentially. The purpose of law. Is absolutely the last thing to employ. In the history of the origin of the law, whatever exists, having somehow come into being is again and again reinterpreted to new ends, taken over, transformed and redirected by some power superior to it. Right. So We constantly are making these arguments in the law that, oh well, you have to interpret this statute because that's the purp because here's the purpose, here's the purpose of what we're trying to do, and therefore, here's the interpretation. And what he wants to say is purposes and utilities are only signs that a will to power has become master of something less powerful and imposed upon it the character of a function. Right? That all of these purposes we talk about when they apply, just means that someone has really imposed their will on the way that we interpret the law. OK. And that Punishment purposes are fabricated and changed. Right. And we say, oh, we're doing this because it's going to deter, or we're doing this because you're morally blameworthy. But we're kind of making that up. And not only are we making it up, that probably something else is going on. With the punishment. OK. So the idea Nietzsche's idea from the 19th century really is that You know, your model penal code is a reflection of the fact that you have no bloody idea about what you're doing when you punish people. Right? You've got every single punishment theory possible in your model penal code. Which reveals in fact. That you've got none. So When you start going down this path, the question then becomes, well, what, what is really going on with punishment, right? What are we doing when we punish? Right, if we, if we're just, if just making up these purposes, what are we really doing? And different people have picked up on different things that we're doing in society when we punish. So, a couple of Brilliant critical theorists in 1939 published a book called Punishment and Social Structure, Rusn Kirschheimer, and they went through and basically they went through these files from uh The ancient regime in France in the 18th century and what they found was All of this correspondence. And the the the the magistrates, the judges were punishing people to the galleys. That was, that was the form of punishment. So these were boats that need to be rowed to engage in commerce, to engage in war, basically. And what they found were these letters. Where the king's administrators, this was Louis the 15th, was writing to the prosecutors and saying, look, folks. We need more able-bodied men to row these boats for our galleys, all right? So start. Sentencing them to Galley service, right? His Majesty urgently needs more men. He wishes you to take the necessary steps in his name in order to have the criminals judged quickly. Right, We need people on our. Boats And you get the correspondence back from the prosecutor saying, oh, you're going to be glad to know we just sentenced a bunch of people, so you're going to have more men for your galleys, right? You will be gratified to learn that this court has 20 prisoners who will be chained together this morning and sent off. And then you have these rules that like, well if the person is maimed, then you don't sentence them to the galley, but uh but, but rules about kind of like how much maiming is good enough to kind of avoid the galleys. Because basically there was a political economy that needed to take place here, right? These galleys had to be manned. Now, Rush and Kirchheimer were, Rush and Kirsheimer were, were with this thing called the Institute for Social Research, which was a um An institute that was formed in in Frankfurt. And that at the time, uh, they were in exile here actually at Columbia University. And they were from a kind of Marxist ideological background. And most of this work, Rusn Kirchheimer would try to develop a relationship between labor, supply, and prison populations. And basically what they tried to show was that the variations in prison populations were related not to crime. But to labor supply needs. OK, and this created a whole, uh, a whole discipline of, it's called the Ruschen Kirchheimer hypothesis with lots of testing, lots of studies trying to show that actually, you want to know what prison population, what's going to be moving prison populations. Find out whether there is a shortage of labor. Find out what the unemployment rates are. Find out what the needs are in industry, and that will reflect your fluctuations in levels of incarceration. All right. Now what they were doing. That was so fascinating for us is that they were kind of like trying to disentangle crime and punishment. Right. Because one of our most deeply held. Common sense, secondhand beliefs. Is that crime and punishment are linked. That you only punish people if they've committed a crime. And if you commit a crime, you punish people and therefore that the whole space of punishment is directly related to the space of criminality, that there's a kind of 1 to 1 link, that those are related to each other necessarily and logically. It's for that reason that the criminal law is so powerful. At shaping. The social order. Because Right? When we had slavery in this country, It was based on Property relations. And that ultimately didn't seem. Right leading to the Civil war. But after the Civil War, When they turned to the criminal law to do the enslaving. It felt a lot more natural because if you commit a crime, you should be punished. There's something natural about. Incarceration for committing a crime. It's not a moral question. We think it's not an ethical question. If you commit a crime, you should be punished. Right? It's logical, it's necessary. It's not moral. There's nothing, there's nothing tricky about that. Accept If basically crime and punishment aren't really connected. And that's what we saw after Reconstruction with convict leasing, right? Convict leasing was kind of proof that actually, wait a minute, you know, we're punishing, but it's not really, the crime is the excuse. To convict least someone. To sell someone the way people had been sold as enslaved persons, but this time as a convict. Because a convict is supposed to do time. A convict is supposed to do forced labor. Right. So the, the link between crime and punishment is really the most invidious in a way, the most invidious relationship, because it blinds us to what we're really doing when we punish. And what these folks were trying to do was to say, no, no, no, open your eyes, OK? Open your eyes. You've got mass incarceration in this country, open your eyes. You had massive fluctuations of crime rates in this country from 9th when we measure these things, usually because prison populations go back to about the beginning of the 1900s. 1926 is when the Federal Bureau started to get all these statistics. But you had fluctuating crime rates from 1926 to 1973. Fluctuating crime rates and a flat prison population. So what was the relationship? Then you had high crime rates and a shooting up massive incarceration. And to the point where we've got 2 million people in, in jails and prisons. And today, Crime rates have just plummeted since 1991, plummeted since 1991. But we still have mass incarceration. So There's some kind of disconnect if in fact crime and punishment were related in the way in which we assume blindly. Those would be far more correlated, right? Prison populations and crime. I mean there might be a lag, sure, there might be a 10 year lag. But still they'd they'd be kind of correlated. You should see something that is related, and what we have instead is just we have a system of mass incarceration now with crime rates that are lower than in the 1960s. Right. So what you have to think is like, what is the relationship between crime and punishment? Is there one? And they were arguing, no, no, you need to look at political economy to understand punishment. And in a way, that's where Foucault starts his book. Uh, it's on page 20. 23, 24, it's on page 24 of the book actually, right? He says, page 24. Rus and Girsheimer's great work Punishment and Social Structures provides a number of essential reference points. Right? And the first one The first one, we must first rid ourselves of the illusion. That penality, i.e., crime and punishment. Uh, the system of punishment in this country that he's writing about France, but you get it. Penality is just punishment and all of its processes. He says we have to rid ourselves of the illusion that penality is above all, if not exclusively. A means of reducing crime. It's not about crime. Break that link. Understand, break that link. It's not, it's not about reducing crime. In this role, according to the social forms, the political systems or beliefs, it may be severe, lenient, tend towards expiation or obtaining redress towards the pursuit of individuals, attribution, collective responsibility, right? So, um It's not, you have to, the first thing you have to do. Is to realize. Stop being fooled. It's not about crime. It's about something else. We must analyze rather the concrete systems of punishment, study them as social phenomena that cannot be accounted for by the juridical structure of society alone, nor by its fundamental ethical choices. We must situate them in their field of operation in which the punishment of crime is not the sole element. It's not about punishing crime, he says. Right? We must show that punitive measures are not simply negative mechanisms that make it possible to repress, to prevent, to exclude, to eliminate. Crime. But that they are linked to a whole series of positive and useful effects, which is their task to support and in this sense, blah blah blah. OK? You've got to think that, wait a minute, punishment is doing something different than just repression of crime. It's doing something positive. Right now, and positive, not in the sense, like, good, but in the sense that it's, it's doing something else, right? It's doing other work. Right. It's, it's manning the galleys, right? It's for imperial conquest, right, for commercial supremacy. Or it's um it's feeding the labor force, right? Or uh with convict leasing. It was, there's no question, it was, it was. Maintaining, um. The kind of plantation economy. Right? That's the, that's the positive thing that it's doing. It's maintaining the plantation economy. Or it's manning the galleys or allowing, you know, colonization or something like that, OK? And that's what you have to understand. So, on the page before, he tells you a little bit what he's doing here, right? This is his method. Page 23, he sets out his method. Right. One, do not concentrate the study of the punitive mechanisms on their repressive effects alone, on their punishment aspects alone, but situate them in a whole series of their possible positive effects, even if they seem marginal at first sight. As a consequence, regard punishment as a complex social function. OK, in other words, You got to think about punishment as being something that is creating, that is involved in creating something at a societal level. Right, it has a complex social function. And this is actually interesting because um the, the years before in like 1971, 19972, he had given a series of lectures on penal institutions and theories, penal theories and institutions, and he had mostly developed a repressive theory that the criminal law is about repression. 1972, he goes to Attica for a visit. It's after the riot and uh. Uh, rebellions that took there and the brutal, um, the brutal repression that took place, resulting in the deaths of dozens of uh Uh Persons incarcerated and correctional officers, that was in 1971. He goes in 1972 and he's so taken by that experience that he realized something else is going on here. Something else is being constructed here through this whole system. And when he comes out, he actually does this interview where he's like, you know, I, I've always been thinking that it's about punishment, it's about repression, but actually, no, it's something else is going on. It's about you got to figure out what we're constructing as a society through these forms of punishment. And that's reflected right here in the first in his first method, right? Don't just look at the repression, look at the positive side. All right, analyze punitive methods not simply as consequences of legislation or indicators of social structure, but as techniques possessing their own specificity in the more general field of other ways of exercising power. Regard punishment as a political tactic. OK. Um, and, uh, and think of it in the third one, he says, think of it as something about, uh, creating knowledge of humans. He writes, knowledge of man, but you get it. It's knowledge of humans. That's what we're doing. There's something about scientific knowledge that's going on when we punish. Paragraph 4. Try to discover whether this entry of the soul onto the scene of penal justice and with it the insertion of legal practice of a whole corpus of scientific knowledge is not the effect of a transformation on the way in which the body itself is invested by relations of power. OK. All right. So what is this, what is he, what is he doing? Here. So what he's trying to do is to suggest that, well, OK, these forms of punishment are about something. Very different than just responding to crime, and if you see how they change over time. You can start to get a sense of what they are trying to achieve, what is their true social function. So when you want to think about punishment, you don't think about what are the purposes of punishment. You don't do this kind of, you know, deterrence, rehabilitation. You go find out what, what is really going on. With these forms of punishment. And it's at this point that he then Comes to the Realization that look, these, these forms of punishment have changed so much over time, right? And we started there, uh, on Tuesday, you know, sermons and, uh, trial by battle and inquisition and, and he, and, and what he does is he says, look, look at the transformation we've had in 150 years, basically, right. From the brutal punishment of Danyang, right, uh, to these kind of these forms of incarceration. Uh, like the, uh, panopticon here, um, uh. That this is, uh, this is Stateville. Uh, this is, this was the, there were 4 of these Panopticon prisons built in just outside of Chicago in Joliet. Uh, at Stateville Prison. Um, where something else, something very different is going on. People are being placed in cells where they can be watched 24 hours a day, and we're trying to somehow get them to internalize that gaze and kind of create some kind of super ego that is kind of policing them themselves, right, if you think of it in a Freudian way, right? We're not terrorizing people through brutal forms of punishment. We're using forms of discipline. Now, y'all are very disciplined right now. Right? I mean, You're all sitting in rows, right? Um, paying attention. Uh, all of you are kind of looking down at the well of this room. Um, right? Um. These are disciplinary processes. Your, your, your first year of law school is a complete disciplinary process. You're being shaped, you're given these, you're given these mandatory courses, right? And you're You don't have any choice. You are being turned into lawyers. What does that mean, being turned into lawyers? Well, it's some form of disciplining process that's going on here. Right? It's a disciplining process that actually, you know, it's not that different than the kind of disciplinary processes that he talks about in terms of schooling, right? That emerged at some point such that you would end up in rows. Sitting in a particular way. With a professor who might tell you, take your cap off. Right? I, I don't do that. But some might. Um, but, and, and being in a particular kind of relation, spatial relationship to each other and to your laptop. And to what, how you're taking notes or to taking an outline or something like that, right? Now. These images are from the 19th century and they're very, they're very French, OK. Um. Discipline, I mean, it's not an accident that Foucault wrote Discipline and Punish studying France because, France is extremely disciplined, far more than a place like the United States. My kids grew up here. You know, they went to these classrooms where they had, I don't know, they put tennis balls underneath the little tables so that they could move the tables everywhere. And it was like, it's like when I would go in, it was like, it was like, what is going on here? I mean, like, it was like this, this is like the playground, right? It was a very progressive. It was, you know, one of these, you know, do we. was a progressive educator, Dewey, who started Teachers College here. Well, he came from a place called University of Chicago and the lab school, kids went to the lab school. It was just like. Not no rope. There was no rose. There was no discipline. There was no, no nothing. So Different cultures relate differently. But you go to a French Elysee, you get raised, you, you still get practically raised like this. Disciplined roles, ways to kind of like hold yourself, different, uh, when you're learning, right, the idea of how to learn, how to write, for instance. My kids didn't learn well, except when we were in France, but. Learning to write cursive and all of that stuff, right? I mean, in some cultures, like you will be really disciplined as to how to use that pen. You'll be forced to have an ink pen and to use it in a certain way and to learn how to write in cursive. Now, now, so. What's Foucault doing here? Now you'll notice all of this is in the, all of this is actually in the book. Why is it in the book? Well, because the book itself is A classic social theory, what does a classic social theory mean? A classic social theory is a book that starts from a before. And then goes to an after, OK? There's a before and an after. You look at any classic text of social theory, and that's what it is. You look at Tocqueville's The Ancient regime, you look at. Uh, Uh, all of these texts have this idea that there was a before and there's an after. The before, OK, in this book is part one. OK, so part one on torture, that's, that's the before, that's the brutal punishments, the spectacle of the sta scaffold, the, uh, the punishment of Damien. Part two is the transition. Generalized punishment, the general way in punishment. Part two is the idea that all of a sudden, some people rebelled against the torturous way that was, The punishment was exercised. The Enlightenment thinkers, people like Cesare Bequeria, we'll come back to Cesare Bequeria, who writes a famous book in in 1764 called On Crimes and Punishment. He's 24 when he writes that book. Um, and, and they all, they start opposing, uh, the brutality of the punishments. They start talking about humanity. They start talking about, uh, the soul. If you look, for instance, uh, on page 74, right? This is a transition period, 74, uh, they talk about, uh, humanity, this need for punishment without torture, first formulated as a cry. From the heart or from an outraged nature, in the worst of murders, there is one thing at least to be respected when pun punished, his humanity, right? Um, so it's, it's all about kind of enlightenment. And this discourse of leniency, right? Page 75, we must therefore recount the birth and early days of this enigmatic leniency. But what Foucault shows is that actually that doesn't stick. OK, so part two, which is all about the reform movements of the 18th century, does not stick. And instead what we get. Is a disciplinary society where prison is the one size fits all for everybody, for everything. And the only metric is time, how much time you're going to serve. Right? And he's, and his argument is that's not what the enlightenment reformers were thinking. That's not what they had in mind. They weren't thinking everybody goes to prison for certain amounts of time. They were thinking you have this very calibrated, um, you have this very calibrated system where there are particular punishments, uh, you know, for particular things that are perfectly tailored, that it's all kind of well regulated. They have this idea that there'd be kind of all kinds of different punishments, but that it would be this kind of theater of The appropriate kinds of punishment. That was what the reformers wanted. They didn't want a kind of one size fits all. Everybody goes to prison. But that's what we got. And his, and his question, the dominating question is. How did that come about? How did it come about that we have this system now where the prison is the only form of punishment really that's meted out? And the answer is The birth of the prison actually is just one of many institutions. That were transformed during the 18th and 19th century towards what he calls a disciplinary society. OK. And so, actually, this book is not really. This book is Accidentally about the birth of the prison, it's really about the birth of a disciplinary society, OK? And all of part three, you'll notice, is not about the birth of the prison. It is about the birth of this disciplinary society in things like the military, right? And education. And the hospital. It's all the ways in which all of a sudden, we started as a society to. Try to change people, to correct them. To make them into soldiers. The idea would have been that, say, in the 16th century, OK. We Put together an army. By trying to just, by just recruiting the roughest and toughest and meanest and, you know, most brutal people. Just like, OK, You know, we need, we need men to fight. This war. Who's like, who, who really wants to go kill people? It's like, oh, OK. All right. OK, so you're a good person. You're now, the idea is that we fundamentally changed that so that we would make everybody a good soldier. OK, so we're gonna, instead of saying like, we're gonna take, we're going to select from. You know, the most. brutal. People, is we're gonna make everybody, anybody can be a soldier. We're gonna, we're gonna discipline you into being a soldier. Through these rules and so all of a sudden there were all of these manuals and kind of processes by which we would transform people, discipline them to be in the military, and there would be these steps, right? This is how you hold your gun, this is what you have to do. Then you have to, you know, this is how you load the gun. Uh, this is, there's a military art here to what we're doing, OK? This is how you pick your mesh up. This is, you know, and it's in steps, and we're going to have these, uh, different steps and different movements and coordinated and lined up and everybody's gonna be doing them, everybody's gonna be in barracks, uh, distributed in this way, right? And effectively, we are gonna, we're gonna transform every single one of you so that every single one of you could be a good soldier. And that was true of everything else throughout society, right? Every, um, We're going to teach everyone how to write. You hold yourself, you put your foot this way, and the other foot that way, and you, Sit standing properly, and you put your arm out and you hold your pen this way, and these, there's a 1234567, this is where it's supposed to be, and we can tell you, like, no, you're holding your pen wrong, right? You sit in these rows, and these are the different ways you have to sit and, sometimes, uh, standing, sometimes sitting, these are proper, proper positions in order to make you a good, School kid All of these forms, and, and we distribute things, so that's all the idea of kind of lines of sight, lines of visibility, geographic distribution, right, all of those terms that he has in here. That filter through all of society, through all of these different institutions. These are hospitals, right? We're creating rows of, uh, of, uh, of hospital rooms with best access, how it's gonna happen, and we're creating ultimately, and then the prison was born as well. But just as one of these institutions, right? And it became then the dominant form of punishing, but it became that because it was the perfect. Use of disciplinary practice. Right. Now, why was this going on, we could ask. Why this turn to discipline? I think the answer, at least my reading of Foucault, is. It was because of the industrial revolution. And because of the needs of society, uh, a growing society to, uh, fuel the industrial revolution. So I think on page 220, 221 is kind of the heart of the explanation. Where he's basically saying bottom of 220. If the economic takeoff of the West began with the techniques that made possible the accumulation of capital. OK, bottom of 220, right? It might perhaps be said that the methods for administering the accumulation of men made possible a political takeoff in relation to the traditional ritual costly violent forms of power which soon fell in disuse and were superseded by a subtle calculated technology of subjection. The two processes, he says, the accumulation of men and the accumulation of capital, cannot be separated. It would not have been possible to solve the problem for the accumulation of men without the growth of an apparatus of production capable of sustaining them and using them. Conversely, the techniques that made the Cumulative multiplicity of men useful accelerated the accumulation of capital. OK, so in other words, the two are completely intertwined, and I note he's, he's actually citing Marx there from Capital Volume One, which gives you an indication that when he's talking about the accumulation of capital, that's what he's talking about, so the, the kind of birth of a capitalist society. Um, but what he's suggesting here is that actually these disciplinary processes were essential to that. And he's making a few more claims, right? One of the things he's saying is, you know, we tend to think of this as all about enlightenment, that we got enlightened. That we, we were, we were horrible back in the Middle Ages. We were horrible under the ancien regime. We did these brutal punishments and look at, look at how enlightened we are now. And he wants to debunk that and say, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. That's not what's going on here. We didn't just become enlightened. We got smarter. It's page 82. Right, we got smarter. We figured out that actually all of that brutal stuff. There wasn't I wasn't that good at creating what we needed, which are docile bodies, right? So, uh, top of 82. Reform, quote unquote in the strict sense, formulating theories of law, as outlined in various projects, was the political or philosophical resumption of this strategy with its primary objectives. To make of the punishment and repression of illegalities a regular function coextensive with society. Not to punish less. But to punish better. To punish with an attenuated severity perhaps. Not the brutal quartering of Damien. But in order to punish with more universality and necessity. To insert the power to punish more deeply into the social body. Those are key lines, right? Not to punish less, that's not what's going on. It's not a story of enlightenment. It's a story of figuring out. What works better? And what works better, right, is. Disciplining people. Now Um, What he develops in this book then is really a new theory of power. Uh, that's probably one of the most important contributions of this book, which I try to describe in that Reader's Companion that I shared with you. By contrast to kind of Hobesian notions of power in the state of nature, he wants to say, no, no, no, no, no, power, power is actually. It's in the relations of power that everything is happening. Relations of power become his way of thinking about it. You can get a good sense of it on the bottom of pages. Um, About 1820, hold on. Um, Well, I'll, uh, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll get you the exact passages because this is, this is really important where he develops his theory of power. It's on page 26, 27, bottom of 26. He talks about microphysics. Power is exercised on the body. It's not power isn't something that you. Possess, it's not something that a class possesses over another, it's something that's exercised, it's in the fluid space of relations of power that actually society, that social, that there are social distributions, OK? And we'll talk about some of those tomorrow now. Now, what he develops then is, or what he identifies then is what he calls disciplinary power, panopticism, um, this idea in fact that. Right now This is a bit of a spectacle, cause you're all looking at me, right? You're all out there, all of you looking at one person, OK? He wants to say what we've developed in this society, in prison. Is the inverse, the flip side of that. I get to look at all of you, OK? At the heart of the panopticon, there's one. Correctional officer or no one because you can just close the shades and nobody knows it who's watching all of you, right? The reversal of the spectacle into the panopticon and he wants to say there's something about that in society broadly. Now Two things to keep in mind. One is. Maybe that's not. As true anymore as it was in 1970. 1970 was a period of, of real rehabilitation. Right? The idea here is that, you know, The guard would be looking at the prisoner, and the prisoner would internalize the gaze. Right? Um, now, maybe that's not true anymore, right? Maybe this isn't the model that we have in society anymore. Maybe power operates differently now. And I think as a result of social media, it does. I think as a result of social media. We don't really have a disciplinary society, we have what I call an expository society. Where we're not being forced. We're not being forced to internalize like this. We're not being caged so much. As we are being propelled by our own desire to say everything about ourselves and to expose ourselves on social media, on social media, on every Google search we do, on every AI search we do, on every YouTube we watch, etc. it operates, I argue today, through desire. More than coercion. We are known, entirely known to our governments and to other governments today. Because We like Because we like Cause we tell people what we like.

Right?

SPEAKER 1
Cuz we search. On search engines. Because everything is done in a way that gets us to want to present ourselves. It's done through desire. So, and I think that that's different. This wasn't desire right here. It was a disciplinary form that was different. It exposed you completely. But it operated through a different, a form of coercion, a form of panopticism. There's no, there's no big brother right now forcing the telescreen in our living room. We have a smart TV instead that's recording what we're saying. Right, then it's not being forced on us. It's like we want that thing. We want to talk to it and make it do what we want to do. And it's transmitting all of everything we say and everything we do. To, you know, first commerce and then the NSA. Right, so it's a different system. That doesn't mean though that the Theory of power and the work that is being done in discipline and punish is not still, I think, extremely helpful to understand where we are today, OK. Now the question then becomes, of course, well then, why, why, why, why are we punishing? Right? If punishment is not about deterrence, it's not about incapacitation, if it's not about uh retribution, but and we're doing something different, then why would we continue punishing, right? And there are, you know, two proposals that I put forth. One is randomization, which in a way is kind of evacuating punishment theory. It's like, no, we don't have any punishment theory, so it's just randomize.
