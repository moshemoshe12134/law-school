SPEAKER 0
Yeah No. Yeah, I went to bed at like a reasonable time and I just kept like. It's picking me up. That's just. Yeah Oh I heard OPW. I was It just Well right now world. I at that point. Oh Yeah, I Yeah, anything you want. Yeah. yeah. do. I mean. kind of Oh All right, everyone. Welcome back. Uh, so let's finish the discussion, uh, regarding heat of passion, uh, extreme emotional distress, and then turn to, um, Felony murder, OK. Uh, so. Aldo Um, you were the prosecutors, right? But I can be if you'd like. Were you? No, you weren't. You were the defense counsel. Neither. You were neither. Yeah, William, you were a prosecutor. William, you were a prosecutor. That's right. And William next to, it, it, it's William next to William also, right? You were, you were a prosecutor too, right? Yes. OK. All right. John, you were a prosecutor, right? No, no, not yet. Now you are. And, and you too, David, and Aldo, um. So Let's assume for a second that these cases, that these decisions in these different jurisdictions have some precedential value for the way that we think about. Extreme emotional distress, heat of passion, etc. Um, so they come from different jurisdictions, but they have arguments in them that we find that we could use, we could point to them. Is there anything, uh, in any of these decisions, Aldo, that you think would be particularly helpful for you as a prosecutor, uh, in say, um, I don't know, we could just take, let's just take the jurard facts, uh, for, for our, for our situation. Um, is there anything in here that you think is particularly helpful for you, uh, as a prosecutor, and so just. You can take a step back and tell me what you're, what you're thinking as a prosecutor in a case like Gerrard. Um, well, as a prosecutor, I don't want his defense of the fact that the words that he heard were enough of a provocation to qualify as giving him extreme emotional disturbance. Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go a level up. Let's go a level up, uh, so. The words thing. Yeah, in his particular case, words, but. What is it that you're trying to, what are you trying to achieve as a prosecutor in, in, in, in a case like Girouard? To show that his, uh, the action that he took and his reaction. Was not a reasonable and it didn't meet that standard, right, right, right, I mean you wanna show basically that. This is unreasonable behavior. Or, or more generally, David, anything else? Um, I mean, I guess like the, the broadest thing that you're trying to do is show that he's in some way morally culpable for what he did. Yeah, that he's morally culpable for what he did. Um, that it was unreasonable. I, I take it and I mean more broadly, even more broadly, I take it, John, tell me what you think. I mean, you as a prosecutor trying to say, look, this kind of behavior, right? We just, we just don't want to excuse this kind of behavior. Right? And why, why don't we want, why is it that you don't, as a prosecutor, you don't want to excuse this kind of behavior? So if you excuse this kind of behavior, it sets a precedent that would give, you know, expanded. Sort of immunity to people who act out in this way. And so if you let it go in this case, Then that makes it more difficult to convict other people in the future. OK, surely that's, that's, so, um, not only kind of convict other people in the future, but I take it. I mean, more broadly, your argument is that like, If we excuse this kind of behavior. It's likely to happen more, right, in society, in a way, right? I mean, isn't that the, isn't that the, the broad kind of argument that we would be making here, that look, we don't want people, we don't want men to be killing their wives. There's a, that's a, that's a crisis in our society, it's called femicide, right? And we just, we don't want that. To happen. So, so somehow we've got to get rid of these rules of criminal law that allow it to happen in a way, right? That, that excuse it or that. That justifies it in a way, right? So, I mean, just to kind of like build on this, right? I mean, the idea is that We don't want this behavior and somehow. By saying that. It's excusable or it's human nature. We are excusing it. We are saying it is human nature. Apparently And then it's like, oh, OK, so then people can start just, I mean, so then we just kind of. Reinforce that norm in society somehow, it's it's OK, so everybody understands that it's kind of a human frailty, it's OK to kill your, Wife, if your wife says things that are really hurtful to you, I mean that, that can't be what we, that we don't want that as a society, I take it, right? And the and the criminal law plays a big role in Kind of informing us of what we think is. Human nature is. Human frailty, something like that. Right, it, it, it's a, it's kind of a, you said this is like the imperial function of the criminal law is that this, we start to believe that this is, right? Right? Now, Alexander, how do you respond to that from the defense side? I mean, that's a, that's a, and I, and I take it, so I was, you know, um. I'll do Like you, you get a sense of that, for instance, um. On, in the, at, in the last paragraph or in the penultimate paragraph of the Gerrard case, where the court is basically saying, yeah, you're, and you were right, the court is dealing with the words issue, you know, words alone is not enough. But look at what they're saying, right? They're saying social necessity dictates our holding. Domestic arguments easily escalate into furious fights. We perceive no reason for a holding in favor of those who find the easiest way to end a domestic dispute is by killing the offending spouse. Right? I mean, it's this language of kind of, you know, this is, this is policy language here that the court is giving, right? There's no good policy to have a kind of like an excuse system where you allow men to get away with femicide. That's it, right? No, we're going to put a stop to that. And there are large social movements. I mean, right now, I'd say this is kind of the 4th wave feminism today is, is, uh, is questions of femicide. Um, In uh You hear it less in the United States, but you, you, there's a strong movements in, in South America, um, in Europe, etc. uh, against the whole problem of femicide, and, and, and, you know, that's what we're dealing with in these cases, right? That's what heat of passion is all about. It has traditionally excused men for being violent. Because of what we consider to be. Semi-reasonable uh frailties. So how do we, so what's the, so what's, how do we defend this? This chap Um. I think you can kind of push back on the idea that The defendant is morally culpable. Come on, come on, come on, come on come on. Go ahead. Yeah, you can push back, I think. OK, morally, so you're saying he's not as as morally culpable. As what? As someone who is not in emotional disturbance, um, and if the point of criminal law is to. Uh, deter People from crimes um that aren't in emotional disturbance then you're kind of like overstepping that boundary. OK, you've got, I think you've got two good arguments in there um I think you've got two good arguments in there. So one of them is the, the deterrence argument. One of them would be something like, well, wait a minute, like the criminal law and punishment. Maybe the purpose of punishment, and we're gonna be studying purposes of punishments later, but maybe the purpose of punishment is to deter people from engaging in heinous acts, right? And what you're saying is, well, wait a minute, the deterrence is not really going to be playing much of a role here. Because Gerard or Casasa or Mayer. We're in a in a in a mental state where deterrence was not going to have an effect. If we think of deterrence as being something specific about the individual, the threat of punishment, these peop these people when they're acting in this way, right, I mean, um. Uh, Gerard tries to commit suicide, right, doesn't he, after he stabs his wife, right? I mean, so basically he's not thinking, oh gosh, I shouldn't do this because. I'm going to get a long sentence. I mean, he's not thinking. Apparently, or so. You're the psychiatrist, he's not thinking. He's not thinking about consequences, if anything, he's thinking about killing himself. Right, he's thinking that he wants everything to end. His wife, himself, his life. What kind of deterrence are you going to get in a case like that? You're not going to get any deterrence. Right? Now, so, yeah, sure, sentence him to death, uh flog him, I don't know, uh, mutilate him, uh quarter him. It's not going to make any difference. Gerard was In another state And the deterrence is, it's like, so if that's what you think you're doing with the criminal law. Forget about it. It's not gonna, it's not gonna have any impact. So that was one thing you were arguing. The other thing you were arguing is something about moral blameworthiness. OK? All right. So now, if moral blameworthiness is what we're doing here, right, with the criminal law, your argument is essentially. Uh, so, OK, yeah, so maybe the purpose of all of this criminal law stuff is something about, um, uh, uh. We would call it retribution. It's something about, um, uh, you know, on the skills of uh moral blame, you know, if someone is acting in a blameworthy way, then we, we punish them. It's a response to their evil action, uh, and so the more morally evil it is, the more we punish it. We try to redress the scales of justice, we try to redress the scales of society, right? When a wrong has been done, we try to. Put things back into place. If that's what we're doing here. Then look, Gerard is less culpable. Then say, uh, Charles Manson, cold-blooded killer, um, take your other pics of um. Um, you know, of our cases, it's just he's not, he, he's not, he didn't, he's just not, he's not a, he's not, he's not out to kill people. He's not a cold blooded killer. He's not an assassin. He Lost it Because of his psychological Problems and because of the provocations. OK. We accept provocation as a defense, right? We might not like it. But we think if somebody provokes something that, you know. Things change. You'll see it when we study the Trayvon Martin in the George Zimmerman case, there's a big question about provocation. Did George Zimmerman actually provoke that incident, right? Do we think different? Yeah, yeah, I tell you, we're gonna think differently about that case because there was provocation. So do we think differently about this case because there was provocation? I mean, you know, don't, I mean, you know. You're all adults, right? I never did want to marry you. You're a lousy fuck. You remind me of your dad. I don't know. that might be some might think that those, that kind of relationship is provocative in some way. Right, I mean, you're getting pretty deep into come on someone's. You know, psyche there. Right? You're hitting him in this, you know, below the belt, right? So That person is not as bad. As a lot of other people, right? Who we want to say should be punished. You know, first degree murder, uh, uh, second-degree murder, a high level of murder. Somehow this doesn't fit with those cases, you argue in the defense, right? Um, David, how do you respond to that? For the prosecution, yeah, I mean, I, I suppose sort of going back to the argument about. Deterrence or also maybe even an argument about like the law if we've been talking about the law is like a political tool and a tool that expresses sort of moral judgments, I think there's something to be said about like. The law maybe in this case should be used to in some sense like inculcate the idea or like the virtue of like restraint in situations like this and patience and managing one's anger in situations like this so like sort of allowing this defense defeats that function of the law to express a moral condemnation of these sort of hasty actions or moral condemnation and political condemnation of a sort of system of gender-based violence, yeah, yeah, and so. Uh, so that's good. So then, uh, you were, uh, focusing on this notion of the expressive function of the law. Which is a really interesting concept. It's been developed by some philosophers and legal philosophers. There's this idea that actually the law has an expressive function. Right? And what it is expressing here is To all of society, to American society at least. You know, No more femicide, period. Right, that's it. That's Off the, that's off the table. You can't do that And it has not just an expressive function, but that I take it is gonna have a, a moral education function. Hope, and, and I think it, I think it does, doesn't it? The law does express kind of what is acceptable, what is not acceptable. The law has changed. Um, I think, I think it is, it's, for instance, uh, homosexual advanced cases, much more, much. More rare now than say 20 years ago. OK, homosexual advance defenses, right? Someone, some, someone of the same sex made a sexual advance at. An individual, they then hurt them or kill them. That is less accepted today in the law. You'll see rape law. We're going to talk about rape law. It has changed. It has changed significantly. You'll see, I mean, the original sexual assault law. Required. Women To engage in utmost resistance. So under, under old British law, essentially if a woman did not come out of a sexual interaction. Uh, it, it, it claiming sexual assault, if the woman didn't come out of a sexual interaction physically bruised with evidence of fighting back. Then there was no way to prosecute the case. That has changed. Dramatically, you'll see, right, to the point where in some jurisdictions. What's required now is affirmative consent. OK. That's, that's, that's changed, and in a way, the law helped change that. And it helps change the way we think about things. So, so. Precisely, the expressive function of the law also changes our morals. Our customs, our morals, the way we talk about things. Um, Do ICE agents have absolute immunity? Right? Well, they don't. Doesn't, doesn't, we'll see when we study. Law enforcement use of lethal force. There is no such thing as absolute immunity. But to claim that they would, for instance, right? That's gonna change the way people behave, and that's gonna change the way people think about the way that people should behave, and what's acceptable and what's not. So the, the law is an the criminal law is like this imperial tool. To shape our society, and you really get a good sense of it in these cases about heat of passion. Right. So why shouldn't the law then, in a way, reflect our most advanced moral principles, right? And not allow us to behave like. Barbarians, say, right? That's the, that's the argument. But the, and the, and the back and forth is gonna be that. You know, all of these arguments about it's, it's not gonna have a deterrent effect. If there's, and these are the typical arguments, by the way, that you get in your torts class. It's questions of foreseeability, right? The same kind of arguments, you know, the person doesn't, isn't having any foreseeability. The same kind of argument about why you would not want to hold someone. Guilty for a negligent crime is the same kind of argument you're making right now, Alexander, right? The person, the person wasn't the person wasn't aware. Of the unreasonableness of their action. They weren't aware. They didn't have, they didn't have consciousness of it. How are you going to deter that? You're not going to be able to deter that and you're not going to be able to deter Mr. Girouard or Mr. Casasa because they have extreme emotional disturbance and they're not acting rationally and they're not and and you can punish them as much as you want, but that's not going to have any effect on them. Right? OK. All right. So, um, so those are the kind of arguments that. Uh, you hear, you would hear in these kind of cases, um. And as I'm going to suggest, it's the kind of arguments that you make very often. In criminal law and in. A lot of other forms of law. And that we're going to see recur in the felony murder context, OK. In a way, what we just did, I mean, we're about to do or what we are doing is about the crystalline structure of law, right? Just listen to the back of your head that the arguments we're gonna be making in the context of something different. Which is felony murder. OK, felony murder. Alright, so let's go to the felony murder doctrine. Um, so, Um, By contrast to the heat of passion, Or extreme emotional distress, um, defense, that we were just discussing, which you'll recall moves us from something like an intentional murder, right? Because these are intentional murders, there's no question, That these were 3 intentional murders. That moves us from intentional murder to something like uh voluntary manslaughter, OK. Right now with the felony murder doctrine, we're looking more at kind of an. Possibly an unintentional murder, OK. An unintentional murder. That then gets transformed. Well, and possibly an unintentional or an involuntary manslaughter. OK, that gets transformed into. The highest degree of murder. OK. Now, um, In general, A felony murder can be can be prosecuted or thought of in two different ways. It kind of fits in two boxes. It could fit In the In the uh in the general kind of in the general mens rea scheme. OK, in the general mens rea scheme. Jack. In the general mens rea scheme. How do you think about felony murder? Mm What's the, what's the, what's the. We haven't studied it yet, but just instinctually, what, what. I think, uh, The, the, the idea is that. If you're aware that you're committing an act that puts people in danger, uh, that, that is essentially the same as if you were, even if you're not the one committing the murder yourself, or it just happened, uh, naturally out of the acts you're doing, it's sort of the same, uh, mindset, uh, of if you were the one committing the murder yourself. Yeah, exactly, exactly. And what is it, what do you think, like, mens rea wise? What is that intuitive sense that you have about putting someone at risk or something like that? Mm mm mm Um, Like if you had to fit it in one of the four categories of mens rea. What would you put it in? Um, purpose, you can say yes or no purpose. To kill? No, no. Knowledge? No, no. Recklessness? Uh, I could be, I think, something like that, right? There's so, so something about the, the, the crimes that we're gonna see here in the context of felony murder are crimes that we think, you know, Mens rea wise. There was some, some, some, in some of these cases, there's a sense in which That was kind of reckless behavior. Right. The stamp case. What what happens in the stamp case? Do you remember the stamp case. It's the first case we, the first, uh, American case that we look at stamp, uh. People versus Stant from California. 5:20 or something. Yeah, so in the, uh, in this there was a robbery and essentially, uh, the person was being held down or uh restrained just to uh. To go along with the, uh, the robbery, but in the process of that, it was an older obese man who had a, uh. He, I think, I don't, I think he had a, he had a history of heart disease and so he ended up having, uh, ended up having a heart attack, uh, so it wasn't the direct act of, uh, killing him, but because of the shock from the incident, that's what, uh, led, led to his right. And in that situation, what would you say about kind of recklessness? What was, was he engaging in a reckless act? Uh, well, the Actual robbery would be considered reckless in a way or tying him down, uh, yeah, right, I mean. That's a, that, that's, that, that's, that's kind of like, there's some risk here. The, the guy's, the guy was carrying a gun. Right, he's committing a robbery with a gun. Right? So now, So one way to think of this whole thing is that he's being reckless. The gun could go off by accident, or you know, I mean if you go rob someone with a gun, there's a possibility that the other person might pull out a gun, that you might have to use the gun, that the gun might go off, that a cop might show up, I mean. That's not, that's, there's, there's, there's some, there's, there's some awareness if you're carrying a gun and robbing people, there's some awareness that shit can happen. Right? So there's an element of reckless, so, so one way to think about that is hm that's reckless, maybe it's extremely reckless. In fact, maybe it's extremely reckless with complete indifference to human life to carry a gun and go rob somebody at gunpoint. If it's extremely reckless. With, if we said, if we decide, and we get to decide these things, we get to be the judge, uh, if we say it's extremely reckless and it shows a real indifference to human life to go around, uh, carrying a gun and robbing people, OK, then what would that likely be in terms of a homicide offense? Uma le mai. Uma, Uma, yes, OK, sorry. I'm sorry, what's the question? What would it be? Uh, as a homicide, say, in New York or under the Model Penal Code, what would it be? What would it be in New York? I guess do you remember be manslaughter, not murder. Hold on, if it's extreme reckless, recklessness with indifference to human life, maybe you need co-counsel from, uh, who was New York. Who was New York? Dylan, were you in New York? Who was New York? Who was Pennsylvania? Murder statute When you were having Yeah, oh, I found, I can, oh, you were in New York. OK. All right, you're in New York, Ming. What, what is it under New York law if we say having carrying a gun, trying to rob somebody, um, uh, with a gun is extremely reckless behavior with great indifference to human life. What is it in New York? Is it? Well, it's not first degree, is it manslaughter? Yeah, you're right, it's not first degree because it, we don't have the cop, right? So we don't have a cop or a correctional officer, um, but Uma, you're, you got it now. Yeah, so therefore it at most it could be second degree murder. It would be second degree murder. It would be second degree murder. Look at 125.25. This is on page 450 or 425. You've got your New York homicide statute at the beginning of the homicide section, right? So 125, 25, subsection 2, under circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human life, he recklessly engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of death to another person, thereby causes the death of another person. You could say, well, I actually think. I actually think In today's world, uh, carrying a gun and robbing people at gunpoint is, uh, depraved indifference to human life, right? OK, yeah, hm. I don't, I'm not sure, uh, well, I'm, I'm sure, I'm sure. I'm sure some significant majority of judges would agree with you, and I'm sure some. Number of judges would disagree with you. You could argue that it's just reckless. OK, OK, so it's not extreme reckless with complete indifference to human life, although some people might say it is. Some people might say, look, it's actually reckless behavior. That is reckless behavior, OK? And if it were reckless behavior in New York, min, what would it be? That's where you were right. Manslaughter, right? Yes, which one? The the second degree. Second degree, yes, 121-15 subsection 1 recklessly causes death of another person. OK, so that would be manslaughter. So we're dealing with a crime essentially that Kind of fits in a category somewhere possibly, sometimes. Maybe not in Mr. Baxter's case, which we read about in the New Yorker magazine, but in some of these cases, fits somewhere possibly between. Kind of like Um, Involuntary manslaughter, recklessness or extreme recklessness somewhere in the murder category. In terms of kind of imputable mens rea. But we treat it differently. And we, in a way, evacuate the mens rea requirement. Because we use the attendant circumstance element instead. All right. You should be thinking that's what we're functionally doing here. We're, and. In what sense are we eva what what sense are we evacuating the mens rea requirement, Uma, in this case, um, I guess we're just going off the fact that the mens rea has been met for the felony and then just pretending that that's sufficient for the murder as well. Exactly what we're doing is we're saying it's a causing death. Yes, person, person's dead. It was a homicide. Something caused death. And instead of saying it has to be reckless, we're just saying with the attendant circumstance. That it was, that it happened during the course of a felony. OK. So you'd have to prove that felony and as a result you'd have to prove some mens rea for that felony, possibly. If it's an armed robbery, it's probably purpose. Was that an intentional, was that an intentional felony? Arson would be like what, you know, was there knowledge, was there purpose, whatever, you'd have to prove the attendant circumstance, which is the other crime, but then that substitutes for mens rea. So what the felony murder rule is basically doing is kind of evacuating the mens rea associated to the Cause it causing death and replacing it with a Attendant circumstance, and in a way. You can think about it as creating strict liability. Right? It's, it's strict liability on the homicide piece. Right? So if you engage in any other felony, that's it, you in uh torts you often have this idea, you take your plaintiff as you find them, you know, the eggshell plaintiff, right, or the. Did you guys, have you done eggshells yet? Not yet. OK, well, basically, The same issue arises to where you have a very vulnerable, say, um er person er who has a condition. And. I think in torture you're going to do something where someone kicked someone in the leg and because they had very vulnerable bones, it was a real injury, which would just it would have been like a normal kind of like bump. But it becomes a tort. I, I mean, it becomes, it becomes really bad because that person just had, you know, an eggshell, whatever. It's like you, that's it. It doesn't, it doesn't, don't, you know, that's your, that's your, that's, it's not our problem, it's your problem. Right? Here too, it's kind of like. The logic of the felony murder is, you know. The death wasn't intended by any stretch of the imagination. Maybe Mr. Stamp. In the stamp case had a toy gun. Maybe he had a plastic gun, maybe he knew. I don't, I really don't wanna kill anybody. I really don't wanna do any. I don't, I do everything I can to make sure that this is not, that there's no guns being fired, say, right? Or maybe the gun didn't have any bullets in it, whatever, maybe, yeah, maybe it's just a plastic gun. In the stamp case, the point is it doesn't matter, buddy. Right? You could have taken all the precautions you want. You could have brought in a toy gun if Mr. Stant has a heart attack. And Mr. Stamp is obese. He's 60 years old. He hasn't been taking care of his heart. Doesn't matter, right? You didn't intend, you even tried to take precautions. You even tried to take um er er a standard of care. It doesn't matter, strict liability, you get it, right? OK. So, but just keep in mind that these cases can be thought of through different lenses. And I could imagine as a prosecutor. In some of these felony murder cases, Charging the person with reckless behavior. Right. Instead of necessarily going with felony murder, OK. So I think that like some of these cases, it's kind of like it's got two tracks, you can fit them in two different categories, OK? But when we fit them in felony murder, what we're doing essentially is creating a form of strict liability, which means that you are responsible for whatever happens. All right. Now, um, Uh, just a couple of things about this, um. The law has kind of changed over time, OK? Uh, and you have, in your first reading, before you get to the stamp case, you have an old case. From 1887. By a judge who you will see again. Uh, James Fitzjames Stephen's a very conservative judge, a very. Uh, interesting judge, we'll, we'll see him resurface. In this course, particularly when we talk about the Hart Devlin debate. Uh, which was a debate in the 1950s and 191960s about whether to criminalize homosexuality and prostitution and vice crimes and basically that debate from the 1960s, we'll do it right after we, I think right before after we come back from spring break. Replicated this debate between uh John Stuart Mill, um, who you may know from the 19th century, a political philosopher who Argued for what was called the harm principle that everything should be based on whether. You cause harm to someone else that's Mill John Stuart Mill, uh, James Fitzjame Stevens was his opponent in that debate, and Stevens argued for legal moralism, basically the law, and, and this, this is, this goes back to you, David, and your argument in the, in the, uh, in the Casasa in the Girard case that basically the law should reflect our morality. That's, that's how the criminal law should, what the criminal law should do it should simply reflect our morality of course for him it was Christian morality, so it was, so it's pretty violent stuff we'll read it, but basically um the law should reflect Christian morality uh was what he says in this case, uh, this is an interesting case, the um surname case. Um, he's got a lot to say about, uh, he's got a lot to say about felony murder and also about morality, actually. Um, did you get a sense quickly, um, Sorry, Juliana. About, can you tell us quickly about the Serna case just before we jump into it? Um, yes, so Serna, um, owned a business and he had a home above it where he lived with his family. And a few weeks prior to the events, he took out insurance against his home, and things in his business and his son who had some sort of disability. And then 3 weeks later, he and an accomplice set 3 or 4 fires in. His shop and his home and like strategically placed so that maybe he and his family could escape, but two of his sons ended up dying in the fire and he and his accomplice were convicted of murder. Right, right. And so he's charged with felony murder here. What's the most, what's the most incriminating evidence, do you think? Um, I think. The fact that he took out the insurance, I think he was having some financial problems. He did that right before he set the fires. Also, there were like 3 fires, so it couldn't have been an accident. Yeah, yeah. The, the insurance seems kind of damning, uh, some damning evidence, and, uh, and you're right, the way that the fire breaks out, it seems as if it's, it's not just one incident, but, um, yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, Now, um, do you get a sense of what Judge Stevens thinks the verdict should be in this case. Um, from reading his kind of instructions to the jury, he's almost telling them to convict them of murder. He's kind of giving him a directed verdict. I mean, it's pretty astounding what he says, right? I mean, I would, you would not expect this, um. But he's, uh, you know, he's a. Spunky judge. Um, I, no one can say truly that Barrett was not justly hanged, as in this case, you know, God forbid that I should, by what I say, produce in your minds even the smallest degree of any feeling against prison, but the evidence. You do not convict one or both of the prisons of willful murder. It's willful murder. I mean, it's almost as if he's like directing a verdict. Did you get a sense of how the jury responded? Um, it says verdict not guilty. Yeah, so, uh, so maybe the way that he's kind of presented the facts is not as. Truthful or maybe some somehow they did not think he was guilty. They did not think that he engaged in. that clearly the jury did not think that he killed his son. Right? I think. Yeah. It's an interesting case. But yeah, um, Stevens is, is, is really directing them uh to give a guilty verdict. But at the same time, what's interesting about this case is that Stevens is limiting Uh, the felony murder rule a little bit, which. was a step that was a modification of the law. And how is it actually, uh, Henry that he's limiting the rule here? Did you get a sense?

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, he almost says that it has to have been a bit like foreseeable that death would have happened and all of the examples he's given, um, there's kind of like a clear intention that someone's life was at harm, and while they were doing the felony and doing that action, you know, they killed someone. So I kind of saw it as a foreseeability versus kind of the strict liability we saw in the staple case.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah, I think that's right. Um, you can think of it in, uh, and here's where kind of like foreseeability and knowledge sometimes are very close to each other, right? Um, but there's definitely, there's definitely this passage, uh, and it's on, so you have the, uh, decision in front of you, right, um. It's in the 3rd paragraph of the decision, where he says that the felony rule should be narrowed, right? And you mentioned foreseeability. I think that's right. Um, uh, I, I, I think it's foreseeability, something, something like knowledge, right? It would be reasonable to say, 6 lines in, it would be reasonable to say that any act known to be dangerous to life and likely in itself to cause death, done for the purpose of committing a felony which causes death, should be murder, right? So it's, it's that idea that, I mean, and I think I'd, I'd go a little bit further than foreseeability. I think I'd say it almost strikes me that he's got a knowledge requirement under kind of like the NPC knowledge requirement. In the sense in which, so what he's trying to say is it's not. Any felony necessarily, it's not strict liability, as you're suggesting, Henry, it's not strict liability. It has to be the case. That That there was something about this uh underlying action. That there was some knowledge that it could cause death, OK? Now, would that apply to stamp? OK, I don't know. It applies here. Why does it apply here? It applies here, I take it, because. Because there's because supposedly. No, we don't know. But supposedly they set fire to the home. And there's a knowledge that that setting fire could cause death, right? Uh, well, uh, you know, could you say, it's the same thing with stamp? Do you know? I don't, I, I'm not I'm not sure it would be it's foreseeability. I think there's foreseeability that somebody could get really harmed, hurt. Do you know? I mean, it depends how far you're going in terms of knowledge, I think, and certainty, um, and remember, you know, the knowledge requirement. Uh, you know, when you, if you look back at our mens rea for a second, the knowledge requirement was, was, was spoken about in terms of kind of, um, Um, High probability of its existence, right? Uh, is aware, practically certain result of conduct, practically certain. So knowledge is pretty high in terms of, in terms of certainty, at least under the Model Penal code. Of course, we have no idea for him. Now, one of the things that's interesting about this case is that he shows us a little bit the earlier, the genealogy of this rule, um, in a footnote A. Of the decision. Footnote A of the decision is really fascinating. Um, it goes back to Edward Koch, and I had mentioned Edward Koch when I spoke about, um, Blackstone, right? Blackstone's commentaries was in the, uh, 18th century. Blackstone's commentaries was one of these things that was trying to tell us what the law of England was, right? In the process, he's making it up, right? He's codifying. Well, uh, Koch had done the same thing in those institutes in 1644. OK, so, so Cooke was another one of these kind of really smart, uh, well, he was a judge, but he was one of these really, um. At a real will to power, um, because he basically was rewriting the English law at the time in his institutes, the way that Blackstone did. The way that the Model Penal Code people tried to do. OK, but what does he say? He draws a distinction between. Shooting, so shooting, if, if A, uh, steals a deer in the park with B, shoots at the deer. And kills a boy, it's murder. But if B shoots the deer, it's not murder. So what, what's the difference between A and B? Did you get a sense of that, Maria? I'm refreshing myself as I answer this. Um, yes, good, good, good, good. OK, so A is saying. If you're on, if you're on B's property and you shoot a deer, um, and you kill a boy, then that is murder. However, if you are the owner of the park or the property and you shoot at the deer and you accidentally kill the boy, and this is homicide, not a felony. It's actually, it's actually nothing. It's misadventure, and no felony. It's not a felony. It's misadventure, yeah. Now what's the difference between A and B? Um, it has to do with. Whose property they're on, um, because in this area are you guys doing property right now? Yes, yeah, fascinating, wow, now this is fascinating. So if you're the property owner, and you. Shoot a deer on your property and you kill someone by accident, no problem, it's just a mistake. If you're not the property owner and you do that, then. It's murder. A what? Using one of the principles we just learned in property, you own what is on your property, right? And, um, and so I think like in, in the first case, you are just killing someone, essentially. Um, and in the second case, you are like exercising your rights on your own property, and you, unfortunately, collaterally killed someone, but this is your space. In the first case, you're trespassing. Right? And that's a crime. And do we assume that the, the boy that you kill is trespassing on your property in the second. It doesn't matter about the boy who is killed in a way. Um, I mean that's an interesting question. I don't think that Cooke, I mean we'd have to go back to the institutes. I don't think that Cooke would have said if the boy was trespassing and therefore he was. In violation of the criminal law. He is, that it, it's that it's OK, right? What matters for Coke in this distinction is that it's trespass. Which is a felony and therefore felony murder. Right? So this is a classic case of felony murder, but it's a cla I mean it's so dramatically classic in the sense that you get a real sense of the property, the private property genealogy of this crime, right? Because it's all based on property rights. So if it's a trespass, which is illegal, then felony murder. This guy gets hanged. Whereas the same act done by the owner. I excused is not a homicide because there's no underlying felony. In both cases, it's kind of like the exact same. Kind of act. Right? Almost In the sense that for A, that act was preceded by a criminal act which was going on somebody's property and violating trespass laws, right? Notice also. He then says If you kill a wild fowl. Then It's a. Different Than if, because it's not unlawful to shoot at the wild fowl, but if it's a cock or a hen or a tame fowl of any other man's, then the, then, then it is murder, right? So you can all, and so you're, so they're making all of these distinctions based on whether or not there's an underlying crime, right? Now that is, that right there is the old law, basically, um, the old British law. Which would have been draconian in that way. The only distinction is whether or not there's an underlying felony. Right? Um, now, Stevens is actually mellowing that out a little bit, and he's narrowing it a little bit, uh, with the stamp case. No, I'm sorry, he, he, he, in the surnay case, he narrows it a little bit by saying that, well, it's that would be too, too much. He's actually saying, uh, Coke is a little bit too much. There has to be some kind of knowledge associated with it. Um, but that doesn't really translate to the United States, uh, where we pretty much get an early felony murder doctrine that is closer to the draconian. British early British law and so you see a case like Stamp where they basically he's saying, look, it doesn't matter. This is strict liability. He actually uses the word strict liability, the judge, right? A felon is held strictly liable for all killings committed by him or his accomplices in the course of the felony. No foreseeability requirement. OK? All right. Now, um, What we get with the, what we get though over time is a movement towards uh certain limitations on the felony murder rule in the United States. And one of them is a movement towards some kind of foreseeability requirement uh in many states. Uh, it has to be kind of the, the, the. The actions have to be in furtherance of the felony. OK. Um, and, um, and then we have the Model Penal code, uh. Way of dealing with felony murder, which is different, um. Aditi, did you have time to read the New Yorker piece? OK. In that case, what, what did the, what is the crime charged against er Mr. Baxter? Yeah, so he is charged with the felony murder because he was searching cars for cash, um, and then he's actually arrested already when his partner, I guess, causes this killing of the people on their bikes, so he's not even there, um, but because he was part of the original crime, he ends up being convicted initially of the felony murder. Right, exactly. So he and a co-defendant, so it's basically kind of the, the, it's a, it's a, it's a case involving two defendants, basically, two co-defendants, as you say, exactly, and they are. Their, their underlying felony is, as you said, breaking into cars in the neighborhood, right? And Mr. Baxter gets arrested by the cops. His, um, co-defendant, um, what was his co-defendant's name again? It's not O'Brien. No, no, that was the lawyer to find it. Uh, was it, was it, what was it O'Brien? It was O'Brien. OK, sorry, um, OK, co-defendant, the co-defendant O'Brien is charged, um, with, uh, well, the co-defendant O'Brien is not arrested. Gets in a car, is ends up driving again in front of the home, gets identified. They do a chase, and he, uh, In a speed chase kills two cyclists, right? OK. Now, um So how, in that case, uh, where does that kind of fit here? Is it more like old UK law? Is it more like, is it like stamp? Is it, is it like what, what is it like? Yeah, I saw it more as like. Strict liability because they are. Like Transplanting the mens rea for the first crime into the second one, and I feel like that is just so clear here because like Baxter wasn't even present when it happened, right? I mean that's the, that's kind of like the most strict liability you can imagine, right? I mean, because also. There's even, there's like no connection between, well, I mean, I don't know, it's hard to connect, breaking into cars to steal money out of the, you know. Cigarette holder or something, right? And then the chase that leads to the death of the cyclists, right? So that seems, so in terms of, is there, so we would say something like, that's not foreseeable. Right, right, and I, I feel like especially later on in the article they mentioned that the police initiated that chase when they shouldn't have, so I feel like that even contributes to like it wasn't foreseeable at all, maybe for even both defendants that this would happen, right? Yeah, that would be a strong argument you would think that would be a strong argument you would think in a. To an appellate court or something actually right since um we tend to assume that people are know what the law is we kind of impute knowledge of the law so in fact if you could argue that people should know that the. You know, police are not allowed to engage in a chase like that anyway, that would even even create more kind of unforeseeability, right? So, so that case is the, that case is kind of like really the extreme case of unforeseeability, strict liability. You couldn't, it would be hard to even put that under the recklessness, right? It'd be hard to say that that causing death was reckless in any way. This It's hard to follow that other track, so you're pretty much in a pure. Which obviously uh in Florida continues to exist now, um. The, um, canola case for a second. We're gonna, we're gonna talk about the canola case in um, in, for some other issues, but just to understand kind of what was going on in the canola case. Uh, Maxwell, can you tell us quickly? Uh, so Canola and 3 others were robbing a jewelry store. Um, one of the, the store owner and employee started kind of fighting with one of the 4 robbers to resist the robbery. Another robber began shooting and the store owner shot back. Um, both the owner and one of the felons were fatally shot. Uh, the 2, the 3 other robbers were indicted on counts of murder, robbery, armed robbery. Um, Based on both deaths and the kind of the death in question is the death of the co-felon of whether or not they should be held liable for that in kind of a felony murder. So Canola gets charged with two deaths because they're two dead people right during the course of this robbery. One is the store victim, the, the victim, the store owner who's the victim who, and the second death is the death of a co-defendant. And who killed that co-defendant? The, the store owner, right. Store owner kills co-defendant during the course of a robbery and the question becomes whether or not canola. Co-defendant is responsible for that death, right? OK. No question under the felony murder rule that he's responsible for the death of the. Store owner That seems pretty clear, pretty straight. Just a question whether he's responsible for the death of the co-defendant. Now do you get a sense of what the court is doing in this case in terms of the felony murder rule? Like which direction it's pushing it? Yeah, I mean they're analyzing both the traditional and contrary view. I think eventually they push it towards like a, a more narrow application, uh, kind of like we see, so it's narrowing, it's doing the work of trying to kind of in a way limit. Uh, the felony murder rule, right? Yeah, and you should look at the language because it's really interesting in this case if you look at the majority decision. In State versus Canola, in the penultimate paragraph. Um, the language there is very interesting. The most modern progressive thought in criminal jurisprudence favors restricting, restriction rather than expansion of the felony murder rule, right? A couple of lines down, it appears to us regressive to extend the application of the felony murder rule to lethal acts of third persons not in furtherance of the felonious scheme, right? Interesting language. I mean, that's an interesting way that the court is, is doing this. The modern progressive thought. So why is the modern progressive thought good? Why, why do we like modern progressive thought? Sure I think that's a rhetorical question. What do you think, Maxwell? Why do we like progressive thought? To change with times and adapt our system for the better. Right, right, but. But it's kind of amazing that the court is basically saying. Uh, look, uh. We're progressives. We're not conservatives. And on that basis, we're gonna rule this way, right? And you could say, I mean, so this is part of the, this was part of the discussion we were having with David and Aldo and Alexander, right? Should the law reflect kind of this adjustment? This adaptation. Should the law and, and, and, and what would be the arguments here, right? The arguments would be. Well, in the case of Mr. Baxter. Are you, are you gonna, are you gonna deter breaking into cars? By sentencing someone to life in prison. Kind of. As, as if like Are you gonna sentence someone to death for breaking into cars? Are you gonna sentence someone to life in prison for breaking into cars, right? What happens if you start. Kind of having such draconian punishment for everything. Like what's the, what's the problem with that, Joseph?

SPEAKER 2
I think that there would, you would achieve a deterrent effect, um, but just the sense, almost like, like a niche type of, um, like justice for the person themselves, um, where if they were committing a relatively minor crime and it was totally unforeseeable to them and all of a sudden you're gonna give them the death penalty, um, that just seems very basically unfair and unjust.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah, OK, so there's the, the justice question, but let's talk a second about what you just said about the deterrence. You might get some deterrence out of it. You might, right? I mean, so if we punish every, if we punisher breaking into cars to steal, you know, cash or whatever you can find in a car, by death. Then that might have a deterrent effect, right? No, you don't think so, tea? No, I mean, I think as long as people are like dependent on a wage in order to survive, but there aren't enough wages to go around, it feels like people are going to have to steal for cash. OK, OK, so you're saying. People aren't elastic. People aren't some people are not going to be elastic to the price of punishment. You can jack up the punishment. But it's not gonna have any effect. It's not going to deter crime. It's not going to deter crime because people are not elastic. We'll get to this when we study law and economics a little bit, but the idea is there's no responsiveness between the cost of the crime, death, and how much crime there is. OK, OK, so one response might be, no, there is no elasticity here, there's no deterrence. It's not gonna have deterrence. Joseph, you were saying, well, it might have some kind of deterrence. It might have some kind of deterrence. I think, I think I could push back on my

SPEAKER 2
own argument.

SPEAKER 0
OK, well, um, I think, OK, I'll stick to your argument and then you can push back against me. OK. Look, let's not be, yeah, let's not be too dogmatic about this. I think, you know, if I told you guys, uh, if you come back on Tuesday and I find any, um, Uh, illegally downloaded MP MP4s or MP3s on your, on your laptops. I'm gonna, I'm gonna actually, uh, kick you out of Columbia Law School. Um, I think the laptops are going to be a lot cleaner. I do. Draconian things can sometimes have effects. So there could be some deterrence. What's the problem with that though, Joseph?

SPEAKER 2
So what I'm kind of thinking now is that there's almost a perverse incentive where if you anyways are gonna be sentenced to life in prison, you're anyways gonna be sentenced to death, you may as well shoot up the whole store. Yeah, right, exactly.

SPEAKER 0
So what you don't get is what's called marginal deterrence. You're not getting any marginal deterrence because if everything is punished by death, what the fuck? Right? I mean like, you know, if you're gonna get kicked out on Tuesday cos I'm gonna find something on your laptop, you might as well start, you know, I don't know, tagging the joint, right? And, you know, I don't know, whatever. If, if uh, if you're a robber, and you got a gun, and you're robbing someone, and you're gonna be sentenced to death anyway. Well, get rid of the, get rid of the witness. More or less likely you're gonna be convicted if there's not a witness, right? So, so what you're arguing is this, there's gotta be marginal, it's gotta be marginal deterrence. So yeah, we might change society in a way, but actually we might change it for the worse because now, Crooks. I consider myself a crook, so it's not a bad thing. Crooks are gonna just be like, you know, murderers, right? And that was in part that was er one of the, one of the um. One of the reasons. That A country like the UK, Great Britain at the time, moved away from, uh, such a kind of, uh, expansive death penalty. In the UK at the time that Sernay is decided, well, maybe not by then, but at least in the 18th century in the UK. There, everything was punished by um death. OK, all felonies were punished by death, OK? So that was the case. I mean like the pickpocket. At the execution would be punished by death, right? Now, and if you have that, then some something's not gonna work. And what we the experience in England was that basically, well, the experience in the United States too with mandatory death sentences was that jurors weren't finding people guilty because they knew that they would be sentenced to death for something that they were thinking, wait a minute, people shouldn't be sentenced to death for that, right? In England, it's very interesting actually, if you're interested, there's some great English historians. Douglas Hay wrote a book called um Albion's Fatal Tree, uh EP Thompson. Albion's Fatal Tree is just an incredible book, you should read it. Um, and what they tried to show is that uh a whole system of mercy, uh, and clemency came into place. Whereby the king would grant mercy to people. So everybody would be sentenced to death, but then it allowed the king to decide, ah, to, to grant mercy to people, and that that actually, that granting of mercy was, Used as a way to govern. Right? Um, it, it gave a lot of legitimacy. To the monarchy Because the monarchy was viewed as being Compassionate and understanding. Um, OK, anyway, but all of these arguments then come into play, and they all have to do with questions of foreseeability. They should sound similar again, right? They should sound similar, uh, to what we were talking about in the context of extreme emotional disturbance. Now, um, Uh, here, the, the court is simply saying, well, we're gonna adapt our law to modern circumstances. We're gonna soften this, we're gonna put in something like foreseeability. Uh, what the Model Penal Code does, as you know, very quickly, um, what does the Model Penal Code do? Is it Via Uh, no, um, the D is pronounced like a TH sound. OK. So tell me, The Thea. Uh, I think the model Punic. No, sorry, you're, um, I'm gonna get your name, sorry. Via? No, um, Via.ia. OK. Yes, go for it. Um, I think the model penal code, um, basically says that, um, Like. you kind of just don't, you do need to have some sort of like, I guess, intent to be like, Like like convicted of murder. OK, but on, on, um, on felony, on felony murder. Did you see what it does in section 210.2.1, point B? Um, what pages. All right. Um, we'll pick up here. Uh, with the model penal code. Uh, section 210.2.1, point B on Tuesday. OK? All right. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. Yeah. Lithium. Via EP Thompson. I was wondering, uh, uh, what, what that book was about. I'm more familiar with, uh, his, I did a lot of research into like crowd actions in the 18th, 19th century, so I'm the moral, the moral economy of the crowd. Yes, yeah, that's great stuff. That's great stuff. Yeah, no, this is, um, well, it's a little bit, it's, uh. It's a little bit the other side because it's studying kind of sovereign power rather than mob and the mob, but it has a very similar notion of legitimacy. So that actually they were. Exercising. He is the sovereign is creating uh legitimacy. For I Oh great. I see. Yeah, I see. Yeah. That's interesting. Yeah, the mom was funny because I was looking at, Oh. Oh. I can't. rise up And so there must be something to their concerns about what was. Very much see it from the other side. this. Great I know. Yes Good. It's sort of like. That. I OK. the But you can't. I. Yeah, there are a couple of. my that's a fundamental. Yeah, I think that's really good.
