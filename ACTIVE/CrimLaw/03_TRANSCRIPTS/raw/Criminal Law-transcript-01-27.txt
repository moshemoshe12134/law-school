SPEAKER 0
Hi Yingying, right? We we, we were talking about Faulkner, right? OK, we'll start here. Is that OK? Yes. check. Yes. Yeah Me. Yeah, yeah, let me, I think. I. Oh. OK All right, everyone. Welcome back. I hope you had a nice snowy New York weekend. And got to play in the snow. Um, so, as you may recall, we were brutally interrupted by a fire alarm on Friday. That was before the snow. Um, so let's pick up where we were and quickly try to wrap up the elements, uh, segment before turning to homicide, OK? And I think Ying Ying, we were talking about these statutes and how we would interpret them. And just to remind us, let's go with the first one. So if the statute in Faulkner reads, a person commits arson, who he causes a fire to result, right? Um How do we think about the mens rea that attaches here?

SPEAKER 1
Um, I would say there's no, there's no mens rea.

SPEAKER 0
There's no explicit mens rea. There's no text. There's nothing in the text that mentions an explicit mens rea, right. So How would you, what would you argue if you were the judge reading this statute and trying to figure out how to interpret it and figuring out what would the mens rea be for arson? What would you think? How, what, what would you, yeah, what would you do?

SPEAKER 1
Um, I guess depending on if you're the prosecution or the defense.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah, although I put you in the position of the judge, OK, OK, so I put you in the position of Trying to be somewhat neutral. What's your, your, you've got a conundrum here. What are your options, do you think?

SPEAKER 1
Um, well, I think even if there's no explicit mens rea. I think it would be unfair to not put. For there to not be at least like some intent put into it or at least like some negligence. Yeah, I think a judge would usually think that.

SPEAKER 0
I mean, arson, I mean this is, you know, it's a felony. It's a felony, it's pretty serious, a felony, right? It's the most serious thing you've got arson is a serious crime. Um, so it's, it seems like it's unlikely that it's just gonna be strict liability, right? I mean, as a judge, you're thinking strict liability, that's usually reserved for, you know, traffic tickets or something, it's not really for a felony, right? You're not gonna put someone. Yeah, we're gonna be putting somebody in prison? So yeah, you're probably thinking there's probably should be some kind of mens rea, right? OK, but what are your options or how do you, how do you think about it?

SPEAKER 1
Um, well, I guess. You could either go the more like foreseeability route, like if. They were doing something that could have caused a fire and they didn't.

SPEAKER 0
All right, um, OK, so certainly foreseeability. Is a traditional way that we think about things. What is that? What, what, what, so what is that tradition? So you're putting on a wig. And you're kind of going back to something like. Some common law notion or something, right, that there needs to be foreseeability, right? So I mean one option, which is what you're doing right now, which is kind of going with your gut. Would be a traditional common law approach, like so, actually maybe we go back really to the kind of common law and say it's a specific intent crime under, it's always been a specific intent crime, right? And so we require maybe specific intent or something like that. Or, or we say, you know, it requires at least foreseeability. You can't have, you really can't have a, a serious crime like felony without foreseeability or without, without, without some moral blameworthiness, right? OK. So you could go the kind of the common law route, OK. Irene, or you could go the codified route, the kind of codification route, like the Model Penal Code. So you would look in your state definitions or um. You would look in your state model penal code, the state code NYPL or something. Let's assume for a second our state adopted the Model Penal Code. How would the Model Penal Code help us here?

SPEAKER 2
Um, maybe if you could infer a reckless or negligent conduct, and how would you do that? Um Well, if you focus on the committing arson bit or the conduct conduct bit, um, and you look at whether the person consciously disregarded. Um, foreseeable risk, then I think you would argue that there was some level of, uh, recklessness that could be in, OK, but, um, but where are you getting all

SPEAKER 0
of this? What you, where are you getting all of it, where you're going as a judge to try and figure this out is to what's called the general part of the model penal code, which is those definitions at the beginning and the stuff about elements, right? It's very general stuff that applies to all crimes. Um, You, you. The crime specific stuff is in the second part. It's a specific part of the model penal code, and we're assuming that the specific part of the model that the specific part of the penal code here simply says doesn't have any kind of mens rea in it right now, we're assuming, right? So, and what would you get from those general rules in the mens rea section?

SPEAKER 2
Um, could you turn to? The 2. section 2.02, specifically subsection 3 to infer that precisely.

SPEAKER 0
That's exactly where you would go as a judge, right? And what would that tell you, subsection 3?

SPEAKER 2
Um, unless the statute explicitly provides otherwise, then, um, at minimum culpability requires recklessness.

SPEAKER 0
OK, so, um, so instead of going with some. Vaguer common law notion of foreseeability, say, you would say specifically, the code says, if there's no explicit mens rea, then it is recklessness, OK. So since there's no explicit mens rea here, if there's no explicit mens rea, it doesn't say anything, it has to be at a minimum, reckless. So in order to convict Mr. Faulkner, If you could show that he did it intentionally, our hierarchy of mens rea tells us, OK, well, you've got recklessness. If you know, if you could say that he did it knowingly, he knew that the ship was gonna go on fire, then, OK, you're satisfying recklessness. And bottom line is, at a minimum, it's gotta be recklessness. OK? And that's inferring. From the general language of the code. To a specific statute. Right? OK, so those are some of your options, and notice the kinds of arguments you would make here are arguments like, I mean, in the common law context, the kind of argument you would make is, look, there shouldn't be criminal liability without, at a minimum, foreseeability. There shouldn't be criminal liability without some moral blameworthiness. Right? And part of those arguments are going to be, well, look, it's not gonna. It's not going to deter anyone, say, if, if they don't have some awareness of the danger. Right? The punishment is not gonna have a deterrent effect. So you know it's not we're we're kind of wasting our time putting someone in prison if they really didn't even know that there was gonna be a fire, right? The person is not blameworthy. You shouldn't punish them, right? That kind of argument, right? OK. Uh, quickly, let's look at the 2nd statute very quickly, um. Flora, Can you make a different kind of argument as to what the, well, let's put it this way, is there a mens rea in this one? Um, not prescribed in the statue. Uh, is, is there any? Sorry. Let's go to 2B. OK, um, then in that case, yes, the word intentionally. OK, there is some mention of mens rea in that statute, right? If it's written as Section 2B would be written. Um, so first degree arson and the mens rea is intention. What does the intention apply to? What does the mens rea apply to? What, what act or attendant circumstance or result of crime does the existing explicit mens rea apply to? Um, committing a misdemeanor. Yes. So What do you think, uh, let me, so, so, um. Let's say you're a defense counsel now and not a judge. You're a defense counsel. What do you think that the mens rea should be for this crime? What are the elements? You're defense counsel, what are the elements? Um, so you have the committing Fatima, you're going to be prosecutor. Go ahead. So committing a misdemeanor. Committing a misdemeanor. OK, so you have to be committing a misdemeanor. That's an element. Prosecution has to prove that you're committing a misdemeanor. OK, good. What is another element? Um, as a result of that. Um, you cause a fire. Yes, that's a result element. You caused a fire. OK, that's a second element. Prosecution has to prove that you caused a fire. Is there a third element right now? I guess if counting the mens rea, the mens rea, yeah, yes. The third element is that the misdemeanor has to be intentional. OK. Those are 3 elements that the prosecution would have to prove. Now, you are defense counsel. Tell me. Is there anything else that needs to be proved? Is there any other element? Mm And let me ask you, as defense counsel, what do you want? Um, I want as many elements. You want another element, and what kind of element do you want? Uh, mens rea of, of. Intent purpose of intent associated with what? I think with all the actors, well, you've got one already intent. With the other one, which is causing a fire. Right? So you want it to be 4 elements. You want the judge to have to instruct the jury in order to convict him of arson. You need to satisfy these you need to find these four elements, jury. You need to find that he was engaged in a misdemeanor, that he was intentionally engaged in a misdemeanor, that he caused a fire, and that he intentionally caused the fire. OK. Did Mr. Faulkner intentionally cause the fire, William? It's William, right? Yes, it's William, but no, he did not. No, no. No juror is gonna find that Faulkner intentionally caused the fire. That was not his intent. His intent was to have a drink of rum. Right, OK. Defense wins. Prosecution, Atima, what do you want as What do you want as the um elements in this case um like

SPEAKER 3
only 3 elements, not 4, yeah, sure.

SPEAKER 0
OK, let me go back to you for a second, Laura. How do you make that happen? Um, so you can go back to the Model Penal code. OK, good, yeah, and look at, and it's not the Model Penal code, it's our code, yeah, all right, right, yes. Our statute in this jurisdiction says, what does it say? What will you rely on? So, subsection 4, Basically saying that if there is um a culpability requirement, it shall apply to all the material elements of the offense? Yes. Precisely. So if there, so your argument is, look at section 4 of the general statute here. And it says, if there's one mens, if there's a mens rea in there. Then that mens rea applies to all of the elements. OK? And one of the elements is causing fire. So that's it. You got 4, you gotta have 4 elements. You intent applies to all of the elements, you would say, you would argue. And that would be your best argument. Prosecution You would rather not have to prove, I mean it's a big lift to have to prove that Mr. Faulkner intentionally caused the fire, right? And you might not even believe that he intentionally caused the fire. But it doesn't matter. Right, I mean, the whole freaking boat sank. That was like, that was full of. Valuable narcotics. Rum and such, OK, so huge economic loss for this corporation, the East Indies Trading Corporation or whatever. OK. All right. OK. So, so, so you, so you wanna go with how do you argue it.

SPEAKER 3
Um, I think I'm looking at the penal code here, and I wonder if, um, subsection 5 would be a good place to turn to just kind of like finding, um, like. Intention, well, not intention, but just intentionally committing a misdemeanor here or like the incident with the rum would like incidentally lead to arson so there doesn't necessarily have to be like that intention like for arson to be committed it's just like the likelihood or the foreseeability of it like. Yeah, I think it's like a probability argument. Like how likely was it for arson to be committed or for the fire to erupt after the incident like with the rum occurred. Does that make sense?

SPEAKER 0
Well, I'm not sure that 5 helps here, OK, because what 5 really does is it kind of creates these hierarchies, right, which says that. If you're, if you've got, if, if, if someone's acting purposefully, then they're acting knowledge and recklessness and so I don't know if the hierarchy is gonna be that helpful. I think, I think you, I, it's a, it's a, it's a tougher argument because I mean we just hammered, we just hammered on section 4. It's kind of like right now, they're just yellow frogs in our mind. But To get the green birds or the green frogs and yellow birds, I forget which one it was, but

SPEAKER 3
Yeah, oh sorry, I think I meant subsection 7. like would that be a better alternative? So when knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, so like in that situation, like being in that enclosed space where like fire is more likely to erupt given like the environment that they're in, would that be a good argument for the prosecution then?

SPEAKER 0
Well, um, so section 7. Uh, kind of defines what knowledge means. Knowledge means high probability of its existence, right? OK. Um, And in this particular, the way this particular statute is written, we don't really have a knowledge requirement. We just have the intentionally committing a misdemeanor, right? So I'm not sure that I would go to 7. I think, I think I would just go to, I would stick with 4. And just use the language at the end of that paragraph, right? Um, unless a country purpose plainly appears. And I think you would wanna you probably would be best to argue, look, Look at the way the statute is written. I think you, I think the prosecutor would probably be making a textualist argument based on the text, the way it's written itself, right? You know, it's like these, these people knew what they were doing. They know what a mens rea is, right? They, they, they, they, they, they, they used one right there intentionally. It's very clear that they know what they're writing. They, and what they were trying to do was create a situation where if you are culpable and you are intentionally engaging in a criminal act, here a misdemeanor, then that lifts your arson to first degree. Right? And so you'd have to argue that, well, it wasn't, it wasn't a mistake. Right? I mean, defense counsel is suggesting that it was an absence, it was a failed uh an error in the in the writing of the legislation. You would want to try to. Find some legislative history or something where, you know, they discussed this and they said, well, we're gonna have intent to the misdemeanor, but basically the structure of 2B is like, Felony murder. We have felony murder in this state. If you are committing a felony and someone dies as a result. That's it, it's murder. Through felony murder, we'll see this week, OK? So you would probably be arguing something about um about um. About the way in which this makes full sense. You don't have, there's not, you don't you don't have to fill in any gap. There isn't a gap here as defense counsel suggests, because it's just, it's a, it's a misdemeanor felony crime is what it is. And if you're intentional as to the misdemeanor, then you get socked with a higher degree of arson, OK? All right. Now, who would win? It depends entirely on what the judge had for lunch, OK? Um, no, I mean, honestly, uh, you could write the opinion either way. All right. You could write the opinion either way in a very convincing way. All right. So, who would win would, it would really depend on Politic political proclivities. But the argument, the arguments are predominantly about kind of blameworthiness. And whether someone should be held criminally liable if they don't intend to do something, if they don't have moral blameworthiness and kind of arguments that you would hear. Now, uh, OK, uh, I was gonna take you through, um. Hazelwood as well, which you have in your casebook. And uh it's like variously on pages 250, 268, etc. that's the case about the Exxon Valdez that discharged an enormous amount of petroleum and the person and the question there is whether it's criminal negligence or simple negligence, OK? Um Criminal negligence, so those are those are slightly different standards. Criminal negligence versus civil negligence. In your torts cases, you're going to have ordinary civil negligence is going to be the standard that you're going to be using. There's going to need to be an unjustifiable risk and a deviation from a standard of care, OK, for there to be a tort, for there to be a tort under a negligence standard. And it turns out that there's also a criminal negligence standard. So you know, uh, in the model penal code, for instance, you have negligence as one of the four standards, right? If you look at, uh, section, again, if we just go back to the same page, if you look at section 2.02, uh. 2, negligently, a person acts negligent with respect to a material element of a defense when he should be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk. Um, risk must be of such a nature and degree that the actor's failure to perceive it, consider it as a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the actor's situation. OK, the way that that's written is a little bit higher, OK, in terms of how much of a deviation has to be from the standard of care, of how much of a risk it has to be. It needs to be a gross and unjustifiable risk, OK? So there are these um Differences between the civil and the criminal standard, and the case Hazelwood is a discussion about whether or not we should use criminal negligence or civil negligence in a criminal case. This is an Alaska case. Um, uh, and in this particular case they decide that there's no need for criminal negligence. Negligence is fine. Just civil negligence is fine. And then, as you will see, um, you know, uh, uh, oftentimes the, uh. State will then uh interject and uh change the law and create a civil, uh, create a criminal instead of a civil. In all of this discussion. What our conversation would have revealed is that a very similar kind of argument comes up in the criminal context, in the criminal versus civil negligence context, context, context. The similar kind of argument that you shouldn't be criminalizing something if there isn't like. Something that's really morally blameworthy, right? And that civil negligence is just not enough. That's just you're, you're just being a little bit unreasonable, but that's there isn't moral blameworthiness. And the point is that you'll start noticing, and you'll notice it today as we talk about homicide, that there are just these recurring arguments that we make in the classroom. And in the courtroom. And they recur all the time. And there's a way in which, and this was the point of the Balkan article that I was asking you to look at, we'll come back to it in more detail. I'll just talk about it for a minute right now, but we'll come back to it in more detail. Um, the argument of Balkan is that it turns out that there's always these similar kinds of arguments that come up in the classroom. And in the courtroom. Arguments like there shouldn't be any criminal liability if there isn't moral blameworthiness. OK. And it turns out that it's there, there are kind of these dyads. There's always the same response to these arguments. Um, you've heard them already probably throughout the first semester you were probably like, oh yeah, I heard that argument. I made that argument before, right? And it's like, no, of course there can be criminal, there can be criminal responsibility without, uh, without moral fault or things like that. And basically what he's trying to, what he tries to do is to come up with the pat arguments that you can make in the criminal law, in tort law, in, in, in all different parts of law, and to give you a kind of a dictionary or a manual, um, a working manual as to, you know, what you can trot out and what you're going to trot out, uh, when you. Argue cases now. Um, so he, uh, So he kind of creates these arguments and he, he tries to show that there's a kind of a political balance to them. No liability without fault is a, is, is what we were just talking about. OK, no liability without fault. And what he's trying to say, so that's NLWF um and what he's trying to say is, well, That's a kind of an individualist argument. It respects the individual against the community. It it benefits the individual versus the community. If there's, because if there were a requirement that there be liability, that would be better for the communal interests, right? Less good for the individual interests, but better for the communal interests, OK. And so he tries to map these onto a kind of communalism versus individualism. And so he and he comes up then with these um. Typical arguments, particularly in Well, you read some of them, right? In all contexts, affirmative action, gun control, uh, warranties of habitability, these are just kind of like the typical kinds of arguments that we get in the criminal law, you get these arguments, right? No liability without free choice, no liability without a fair warning, no liability without criminal intent. And on the other hand, you would argue, well, there was free choice free here or there was a fair warning or criminal intent requires liability or something like that, right? Those are matched so that they are on the different sides of the arguments that we would be making in a particular case. And he wants, he wants to say actually I'm gonna give you a pretty good list of everything that you'll need in criminal law to answer Harcourt's questions, OK? That's what he's trying to do here. He's trying to say there's a structure to this, OK, and I can give you a glossary that you can use to answer Harcourt's questions when he asks you about whether or not there should be. Negligence or criminal negligence, right, um, or whether there should be an imposition of, uh, uh, intention or, uh, intent, a mens rea. Oh well, let's see, um, well, wait a minute, um, you know, um. Um, Flora, it's like, oh, I can pull out number 8 for Harcourt when he asked that question, right? That's what you were doing. You were pulling out 8. It's kind of like a menu, and you just choose from these things because it's, that's actually what you're doing, OK? And his, his idea is that you do it in, in this kind of you can do it in these sequential ways like the same kind of argument as to whether or not there should be a negligence standard, say. Whether or not there should be a negligence standard, is there negligence or is there not negligence? Well, OK, there is negligence. Well, should it be civil negligence or should it be criminal negligence, which is the next dyad, is the same argument you're making. Right? You're just kind of repeating the same kind of arguments, OK? That's his point. All right, I want to give it to you and we'll come back to it. Um, this is a classic move in kind of critical legal studies, which is to suggest that really the law is, it's just a pattern form, it's a language, it's a language we speak. It's a. Um, there's a structure to it. All you have to do is figure out what the structure is, and then you can deploy that very easily. Now, what do, what towards what end? That, that's the then the kind of critical question, right? Um. Uh, critical legal scholars will say usually it's deployed towards political ends, right, that are masked, so all of the politics is masked by this because you just have the oral, the normal arguments that you make in law, but it turns out that making those arguments is not innocuous. It has kind of a political tendency one way or the other, OK? All right, I just wanted to introduce that to you. We will come back to it. Let's go to homicide. And Let's go to the law of homicide. OK. Now, As I indicate in the syllabus. And this is really, really helpful. The law of homicide is all about the gradation of culpability and blameworthiness. OK, what does that mean? What it means is that, as you're going to see, we're going to spend the next couple of weeks on homicide law. We're now turning then to a specific crime. So it's in part two, in the specific part of a model penal code or a penal statute. What you're going to see is that. Everything here as to what kind of homicide it is, is gonna be a question of mens rea. Mostly, OK? It's gonna be a question of mens rea. The differences between 1st degree murder and 2degree murder and manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter and voluntary manslaughter and all that stuff. All of that is a question of gradation. It's a question of trying to figure out how bad. The actor was. When they were engaged in that activity, that caused death. All right. And we're gonna be basically going through this, this, uh, you can think of this as a spectrum, OK? A spectrum. Where kind of the worst offense here is on the bottom. You could put the spectrum on a horizontal line, if you'd like, or you could flip it the other way and make the worst at the top, but here the worst is at the bottom. OK. And the least. Uh, egregious is at the top. And everything is about trying to figure out where the act fits, OK. Now, let me just be clear about something. Civil law and criminal law. Torts and criminal law. Can overlap Perfectly So in other words, uh, again, we were talking about um the um. Uh, homicide of Renee Good or Alex Pretty. Um, there can be a criminal homicide investigation as to whether or not it was an unjustifiable killing, all right? There will be a civil suit. OK. The civil suit, that's what you're gonna do in torts, OK, for wrongful death. OK. Um, the same act of that shooting. Can form the basis of a civil lawsuit. And of a criminal prosecution. In addition, there can be both a state prosecution and a federal prosecution for the same crime, for the same act. OK, there's no double jeopardy bar. To both state and federal prosecutions. We've got death penalty cases where many death penalty cases where there is a Alabama death sentence imposed under state law and a separate federal prosecution resulting in a federal death sentence imposed in federal court. OK? Now, the reason I'm saying this is because I've put civil liability as kind of a Uh, maybe, maybe, maybe I should have put civil, civil negligence, probably, um, but, um, civil negligence would be, would be a better way to put it than just civil liability, um, but you could have, you could have an argument. That at the civil level, it was a, it was a, an intentional. Homicide. OK. So, um, Now, In terms of this flow chart. What we're basically looking at is, OK, some, there some somebody caused someone's death, OK, and the question is then going to be, at what level is that? OK. Now Uh, the bottom is usually something like it's an intentional homicide. There was an intent or premeditation or we'll see kind of stuff like that today. Um, less egregious in the sense that you would be punished less would be something like, well, it's intentional but excusable in some way. Alright, we're going to see, for instance, heat of passion defenses. It wasn't intentional killing, but the person who did it was under the effects of extreme emotional distress that we think is OK. I mean, it's not OK, but we excuse it in a way. So it's a less bad homicide, it's a less bad murder. Or involuntary, or, or you could go all the way to criminal negligence, right? The person was negligent in causing the death, wasn't even aware of it, but was negligent, OK? Or you could say, no, there isn't now, usually the demarcation here is, here's where the kind of the criminal law applies from here on down. And you might say, no, it was just civil negligence, so there's civil liability, but not criminal liability. All of this stuff is criminal liability. Or you could say, no, there's no liability whatsoever. Right? And that's what, you know, that's what you would be figuring out in a torts class. Is there a liability? Was there a liability? Was there a duty, was there a breach of duty, etc. OK? But what you're gonna see is all these different definitions of, of murder and manslaughter are really all about the mens rea requirement. OK. Now let's just take a step back, um, and go over some basics. When there is a death OK, when there is a death, um, sorry, it's small. I know, but all you need to know is the big fat words, really. I'll tell you what the other ones mean. Uh, when there is a death, uh, there's always an investigation. There's always a, um, there always needs to be a, uh, report by, uh, the coroner, uh, of the county, um, and there needs to be an assessment of what the cause of death was, OK. Causes of possible causes of death, typically are natural death, meaning that the person has died of a natural cause, er a heart attack, um. An illness, cancer, etc. a natural illness. There can be accidental deaths. Someone who dies in a car crash, for instance, it's an inadvertent chance happening. There can be suicide, which is that the person has taken their own life. Or there can be homicide, which means that someone else has caused the death of another human being. OK. And then, of course, it can be undetermined or pending, etc. When someone dies, then uh there is a um um A medical a medical examiner, a medical doctor, will have to certify what the cause of death is. On any death certificate, uh, that you look at, there will be on the death certificate, the cause of death. Every time a person, any person dies, you need to have a death certificate. OK? And on something like, you know, a death certificate or an autopsy report or anything like that, you're going to have um uh the uh. You're gonna have the cause of death. All right? And here, for instance, right, you get a good sense of it. Here's the manner of death, it could be natural, here it was natural. So uh this was a heart attack, OK, natural, an accident, suicide, homicide, pending investigation couldn't be determined, OK. What we are studying. are homicides, OK? Um, Uh, as soon as it, as soon as you check the box off for homicide. That's when. We Get, we get the case in here, OK, in criminal law, OK? And every homicide. Uh Requires a determination. Of whether or not it was. A justified homicide, in which case there wouldn't be any kind of prosecution. Or um an unjustified homicide, in which case there will be a prosecution and a determination of what level, Is associated with that homicide, OK? All right. So all of the criminal law is a determination really in in this category of deaths. Whether or not there needs to be a prosecution and a pursuit. Of the person who caused the death of the other person. OK? So, um, so the term homicide. Does not mean murder. The term homicide is just, is just, it just means that the cause of death was another person. What brings it into our bailiwick is if it becomes a criminal homicide. OK. Alright, now. Uh, historically, So, we can go back to, this is again, this is uh Blackstone's commentaries. Uh, how does he define murder? Murder, uh, defined by Sir Edward Cooke who was, uh, a famous British judge and who is frequently cited and who himself had uh done some, uh, commentaries himself. When a person of sound mind and uh discretion unlawfully kills any reasonable creature in being and under the king's peace with malice aforethought, either expressed or implied, OK. So, uh, unlawfully killeth. OK, so this is interesting, uh, the first thing you should note here is actually killeth is a verb. Right, so I think it was Eli, we're in the kind of act, uh, we're in the conduct category, right? It's an active verb. Um Uh, uh, today in most all criminal statutes you're gonna see it's actually a result element, uh, it's actually caused death, um, but, uh, for Blackstone it was unlawfully killeth. Now the unlawfully, the unlawfully again we don't need to pay too much attention to it. Uh, what would be a lawful killing. Dylan, for instance. Sorry, presumably you were committing self-defense and, you know, possibly self-defense, yeah, yeah, or an execution, yeah, right, so you, so this is not intended to cover, uh, the executioner in, uh, the, uh, 17th century unlawfully killeth. OK, so, uh, an executioner is lawfully killeth thing, right? OK. Alright, any reacher with malice aforethought. OK, malice aforethought, either expressed or implied. OK, and murder is distinguished from manslaughter, he says, OK. Maalice aforethought There's a brilliant little passage in your, uh, book. Just at the beginning of the homicide section, so it's on page 420, 444 maybe for you, um, it's the report of the Royal Commission on Capital punishment from 1945, 1953. It's a brilliant, uh, it's right at the beginning of homicide. Do you have it there? Yes, yes. OK. What is so brilliant about this is that it understands, it is, this is an expression of nominalism, philosophical nominalism. What it's basically saying is, the term itself is just an arbitrary symbol. It actually says that in section 74, 5 lines in. It is malice aforethought is a, is a highly technical term of art. It's now only an arbitrary symbol. What does it mean by that? It doesn't mean anything, OK? malice aforethought. It doesn't mean anything. It's not like you can go and say, oh, they say malice aforethought, so malice means it's a kind of devilish kind of mental state. No, that is just a container, an empty vessel. You gotta have malice aforethought. But it doesn't mean anything, we're gonna tell you what it means, OK? And these are the things that at common law, it could mean, OK? Maalice aforethought would be satisfied and therefore something would be murder if you unlawfully kill it. If it's premeditated. Or if there was an intent to cause death, or if there was an intent to cause serious bodily harm. Or if it was extremely reckless and indifferent to life. Or if it was committed during the course of a felony. OK. At common law, these, all of these would have satisfied, the malice aforethought that you need in order to get, Murder, right, as distinguished from. Manslaughter. OK. And, um, Manslaughter, Blackstone defined it as the unlawful killing. Of another without malice. And it can be voluntary upon a sudden heat or involuntary, but in the commission of some unlawful act, OK? Without malice. So meaning, none of these things apply. It wasn't intentional killing. There wasn't an intent to harm. to cause physical serious injury. It wasn't during the course of a felony. OK. Um, And we'll get to manslaughter. Uh After we cover murder. Um, Notice that. Manslaughter has to be without malice, but it can be voluntary. Voluntary murder during a sudden heat of passion, for instance, or imperfect self-defense, we'll get to that when we get to self-defense. Or involuntary. Um, So it wasn't you're in, it wasn't a voluntary act. But it was done in some kind of, say, reckless manner. OK. Alright, now. So what we're going to do very quickly, very quickly, as quickly as we can. Is look at some of these statutes to get a sense uh of what's going on, OK? Um, we're going to look, uh, Dylan, I'm gonna take you first to the Pennsylvania statute, uh, so that's on. Page 423 or 465 or 447. And you got it? OK. Pennsylvania statute, it's a very interesting statute. It's the first statute in the country, 1794 that created the distinctions between first degree murder, second degree murder, etc. Before that, at common law, at common law, all of those things would have been called murder, period. No 1st degree, no 2nd degree. At common law, it's just murder, OK? And in effect, You would be convicted of murder if you engaged in premeditated killing. Or if you engaged in a robbery, during the course of which someone died, felony murder. OK, all of that would just be called murder. If you got the M tattooed on your forehead, it wouldn't make any distinction between any of those categories, OK? All right, uh, very quickly, what do we have in Pennsylvania? Do you get a sense of what we have in Pennsylvania? Uh, how, how the Pennsylvania code fits here with the, with versus the common law? Is there a premeditated. Uh, for first-degree murder, there's a requirement that it be premeditated or that it's intentional killing, I guess, not necessarily it's premeditated, but they might define it as such. OK, so in, in, in, in, in, uh, in Pennsylvania, actually, they don't make that much of a distinction between premeditated and intentional. It has to be intentional, and that's from, OK, so now we're at section 2501 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes, Title 18. 2010, Section D, which is the definitions, and as you were saying, the intentional killing can be just one of the things, if it's premeditated, it's intentional, but it needs to be intentional for it to be first degree murder. So premeditated and intent to cause death would be first degree murder in the state of Pennsylvania. OK, what would uh intent to inflict serious bodily harm be? Um, it seems that that would likely, um, I mean it probably could end up falling in the, uh, murder of the third degree camp, uh, because you did not intend to kill them and the first degree is restricted for an intentional killing and second degree is restricted for when it is in the perpetration or assistance of a felony, which would remain one of the options. It's gotta be 3rd, because the 3rd is the bucket, right? OK, so we got intent to inflict, uh, bodily harm would be 3rd degree murder. Turns out that that's a 20 year max, right? Uh, under the Pennsylvania statute. What's extreme recklessness and indifference to human life? Uh, I would say the same. Dirt, yeah, it fits in the, it's the big bucket, right? That's not intentional and not felony, and felony murder. Uh, felony murder would be, uh, I guess. Uh, 2nd degree, 2nd degree, yeah, that's the only thing that is 2nd degree here, right? And there the sentence is life. So basically if you commit, uh, a murder during a felony, if you commit, if, and we saw, uh, you know, it's like the Faulkner Statute, right? It was like the Faulkner Statute, but the Faulkner Statute was arson and a misdemeanor. Here it's death and a felony. If you commit a felony intentionally and someone dies, you've got 2nd-degree murder in Pennsylvania, which means a life sentence, OK, which is more than if you kill someone with the intent to inflict serious bodily harm, which would be 3rd degree, OK? All right. And very quickly, when you go to manslaughter, anything there, um, what would, uh, what would kind of like voluntary heat of passion be? Do you think? I mean that could still be um like voluntary manslaughter would seem voluntary manslaughter. Yeah, it would be voluntary manslaughter with a 20 year max. Um, Recklessness, involuntary manslaughter would be what? Uh, recklessness would be involuntary manslaughter, would be involuntary manslaughter. OK, so that would be Section 2504. Yeah, and that's a 5 year max. And then is there anything for criminal negligence? Um, I mean, involuntary manslaughter also includes, uh, gross negligence. Exactly. All right, so that's the same thing, uh, that's involuntary manslaughter with a 5 year max. OK. All right, now, um, we're just reading the statute is what we're doing, right? OK, so this exercise, we're just, you're just reading the statute, and you can take any statute today, uh, NYPL. Uh, on the next page, um, very quickly, uh, we could do it for New York too, um, and what do you get? You basically get kind of, you'll see it's a mix and match. Let's look at the New York penal law for a second. Um, how is that one structured, um, uh, main. Do you get a sense of what is first-degree murder in New York penal law? Well, let me ask you this, what is 2nd degree murder? I just found the section for the first degree murder. Sure. Um, special circumstances. When the Victim is a police officer, for instance, OK, yes. So, so. So it's sec basically first degree murder is Any 2nd degree murder. Any 2nd degree murder. Where there is An attendant circumstance. Right. Such as you just said killing a police killing a police officer. OK. All right, so notice it's a, it's a different little, it's a, there's a, it's a different thing going on here. What are second degree murders? Which ones fit in second degree murder? Um, well, the first one is with the intent to cause, intent to cause death. So a purpose or intentional would be, um, uh, second degree murder. What else would be second degree murder? Um, indifference to human life, recklessly, uh, engaged in a conduct which creates a grave risk of death to another person. So you're reading section 125252, right? Yeah, OK. Yeah, extreme recklessness and indifference to human life. OK, so that's 2nd degree murder. Anything else? Second degree murder? Uh, it looks like felony murder. Felony murder is 2nd degree murder as well, right? OK, so we've got 3 things that are 2nd degree murder intent to kill, uh, extreme recklessness, and felony murder. OK. Now, and those become, any of those would become first-degree murder. If there is an attendant circumstance, interesting attendant circumstance, and of course, so here all of a sudden you'd start to be wondering to yourself, hm, victim is a police officer or an employee of a state correctional institution, crime committed while the defendant is in custody serving a life sentence. hm, interesting. I wonder what the mens rea is there. You'd be thinking to yourself, you'd be thinking, hm, I wonder, so does it have to be intentional? Does it have to be that the person intentionally killed a police officer? Right? Uh, not clear. We don't know, but all of a sudden you'd be starting to think, oh, interesting. OK, well, what's the mens rea that attaches to that attendant circumstance, which is not a conduct and not a result of crime, but an attendant circumstance, right? OK. All right, now here's what is interesting very quickly, um, oh damn. Uh, the Model Penal Code, well, uh, I should have that other slide. Uh, the Model Penal Code, now, so you'll notice that what's going on is that each state is kind of defining what's first degree. Premeditated death is not gonna be first degree in New York State. Cause it doesn't doesn't nece unless it has that attendant circumstance, but it is first degree in Pennsylvania, you'll notice. So you can see these differences between these statutes. Now what's interesting is that the Model Penal Code, let's flip to the Model Penal Code very quickly, uh, Amy. Uh, Model Penal Code, we're at section 210. OK, now we're now in the definitions of specific crimes. This is part two of the Model Penal Code. Now we're defining specific crimes. Remember, part one was the general thing that applies to all crimes. Part two is specific crimes. Um, what's murder?

SPEAKER 2
Um, murder is when you, it's a criminal homicide, um, which is purposeful or knowing or reckless under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to human life.

SPEAKER 0
OK, great. So, uh, on this chart, what's premeditated murder called in the Model Penal Code and, and any of the 24 states that use the Model Penal code? What would that be called? Premeditated murder, what would it be called?

SPEAKER 2
Um, Would it be just murder, murder.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah. Just murder. Intent to kill? What is it called?

SPEAKER 2
Um. Murder, murder.

SPEAKER 0
Uh, intent to cause bodily harm. If it's extremely indifferent to human life. That's also murder. Extreme recklessness.

SPEAKER 2
Murder, felony murder. Um, murder.

SPEAKER 0
Murder. Thank you. OK, all right. Notice that what the Model Penal Code has done is it's basically gone back to the common law notion, it's gotten rid of all of the first degree, second degree, right? A state like Alabama, which has the Model Penal Code, which adopted something functionally like the Model Penal Code, it's just murder, OK. It's not 1st degree, 2nd degree, whatever. It's effectively kind of like, there's a sense in which we've kind of like historically, you can imagine kind of like we came from the common law, we went into this kind of like convoluted first all these trying to make these distinctions, whatever, and then we end up today back at a kind of like a very simplified, you know what, it's either murder or it's manslaughter, right? Uh, manslaughter is listed on the next section, and it's just manslaughter. If it's reckless, or if it's, um, heat of passion, right? It's all just manslaughter. And then there's a negligent homicide, um, under the Model Penal Code. So we've done a lot of trajectory, uh, but we've gotten to the same place, OK, as the common law. In these other states, it's very different. OK. And um, and you don't need to know the sentencing proposals. OK, now. So the first thing we want to, so the first, OK. Now, so, at this point. You should be able to read any. Any homicide statute in any state and kind of do that game, mix and match and figure out what's going on, OK? All right. Um, uh, we now turn then to our kind of first kind of delineation. OK. How do you distinguish premeditated homicide from intentional homicide? OK. Now, long and short, uh, the Model Pin code doesn't. OK, we'll get to that in a second. So the model penal is this kind of the model penal code is a big um. Um, aggregator. It's kind of like, uh, it took your, it took the Excel spreadsheet and got rid of the cells and just turned it into one big thing. Do you know what I mean by doing, you know how you do that on Excel? Yeah, it's it's just like a combined cells. That's what it did, yeah. Not sure why we could talk about it, but the first thing we're trying to figure out is kind of like this distinction between premeditated and intent to cause death. OK. And now, um, uh, let me see, uh, Cecilia and, uh, you four are gonna be our prosecutors and James and y'all are gonna be defense counsel, OK, before we get to the prosecution, the Sabrina and Nua, tell me a little bit about, um. Uh, tell me a little bit first, uh, uh, Sabrina, tell me a little bit about, um, the Guthrie case very quickly. What are we dealing with here? And Noah, I want you to tell me about the Anderson standard. Do you remember, did you catch the Anderson standard? Yeah, OK. All right, so, um, Sabrina. What's going on in Guthrie?

SPEAKER 2
Um, so essentially the defendant stabbed a co-worker with a knife in the neck after the co-worker supposedly made fun of him and whacked him on his nose with a towel, right?

SPEAKER 0
OK. And so, um, So all these cases are really tragic, really tragic, um. So in this case, uh, what do we know about the defendant?

SPEAKER 2
The defendant suffered from a host of psychiatric problems, including Uh, insecurity regarding his nose to a point where he would. Look at it in every reflective surface constantly, right, right,

SPEAKER 0
right, so he had some kind of nose, uh, dys uh uh dysmorphia systemic disorder, uh, no, uh, dys, uh, dysmorphic disorder, right, and, um, borderline personality disorder and basically he gets triggered by a coworker and what you're saying is it was just kind of it was supposed to be just a. Ribbing or something like that and um and he goes, and he, he goes off and uh knifes him. And um And uh OK. So, and the question in this case then uh is, what, how does, how does the case come up legally as a legal matter? Why is this case is on appeal? I take it this case is on appeal. We are in West Virginia, right? How does it get to the court?

SPEAKER 2
The defendant is appealing the jury verdict, um, appealing the

SPEAKER 0
jury. Well, based on the instructions, it's an appeal of the conviction. Yeah, but you were just saying, uh, based on the

SPEAKER 2
instructions that they were given.

SPEAKER 0
OK, so the argument here is that there is a jury instruction. That was erroneous as a legal matter, right? erroneous as a legal matter. What, what did it say?

SPEAKER 2
Uh, they referred to it as the straighter instructions. They were, um, Confusing and improper because the terms willful, deliberate, and premeditated were equated with the mere intent to kill.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah, it's smushing everything. It's smooshing everything. Uh, instruction number 10 says constitute premeditated murder. It has to be an intent to kill and it needs to exist only for an instant, right? OK, so I think this is going back to Ava, maybe Ava and Haley. I don't remember. I, I think. You were talking about this idea like, wait a minute, if there's like intent can be intent can be just, is it the intent for to act or is it the intent to kill? And, and basically this is saying that really if, if you had an intent. To say. Pull a trigger. Right, then. Kind of that intent becomes deliberation to kill. Right, that basically intent can be formulated, that deliberation can be formulated in a split second, and the premeditation would be confused with intent to kill, and also to a certain extent with just intent to Act. In a way, right, it's almost as if any intentional act. That the, the intent to act becomes intent to kill, that becomes premeditation, OK? Um, all right, now, um. Noah, how does Anderson, how does the Anderson work? So the Anderson is a California case, and the California case gives us this kind of Way of thinking about premeditation. Yeah, what are the factors?

SPEAKER 4
The factors are planning activity, motive, and then kind of particularity. So basically, um, evidence sufficient to sustain a finding of premeditation generally falls into one of these three categories. Planning activity refers to facts regarding defendant's behavior prior to the killing that might indicate a design to take life. Um, so planning. Yeah, and then motive, which is facts about the defendant's prior relationship with the victim that might indicate a reason to kill. OK, in particularity is evidence that the manner of the killing was so particular and exacting that the defendant must have intentionally killed according to a preconceived design.

SPEAKER 0
OK. All right. And so this California court, which Later it gets overruled, but that doesn't matter. It's no longer the case. But this California court is really trying to figure out like how do, what, what is premeditation, right? And comes up with these 3 categories and then actually says, you know, you need some kind of mix and match of whatever a lot of 1, a lot of 2. I mean it's actually like either 1 or 2 plus 1 or 3 or something like that but it's basically trying to figure this out. OK, now, um, Cecilia, for the prosecution having that in mind, right? Um, what would you be arguing here in terms of whether or not there actually was premeditation, right? So not, the question is not, well, assuming, yeah. Go ahead, sorry. Oh, I just think the prosecution's interest is like holding this, this line in the original, um, trial case of, um. Sort of saying that there um doesn't need to be a time lapse and that you can have like intent in an instance right that you can and you can have deliberation in an instance right right OK um. Uh, I think, OK, so that, that is right, um, and. Uh. On that argument. James. How do you respond as defense counsel? There's no microphone here, so I'll. Great, thanks. Basically he was being put in a corner. Uh, his coworker was snapping a towel at him. There are clearly, uh, some sort of mental issues going back a very long time, especially with relation to his nose. There was no time to reflect. It was an instantaneous reflexive reaction. OK. Now, that's, that's all, that's all right, good, ah, and factual. Uh, and important. Now, the prosecutor right now is arguing. In a way, the I was going there. That's where I was going. I was going with the facts. But the prosecutor is actually just going with the law right now. The prosecutor is simply saying. Uh, the, the law is or the law should be. That premeditation is satisfied. If, uh, any kind of intent is formulated, you know, uh. Immediately, in an instant, basically, right, as a legal matter. Now how do you respond to the legal, how do you respond to that legal claim? There was no intent. It was an overwhelming instantaneous emotion. OK. There's no time for reflection, no, no time to formulate. OK. Um, all right. So one of the things you're, OK, so what you're doing right now is you're going with reflex. OK. So in response to the kind of legal argument, you're saying, in a way, you're arguing it was an involuntary act. Kind of. I mean, you're not, you're not saying, you didn't say that, but you said it's, it was a reflex. Right? And a reflex is just an involuntary act without any time to think. OK. Um, And in part, what you're doing. Is again, you're pulling out an 8. If it was a reflex, there was no moral culpability, there's no blameworthiness. You can't have criminal responsibility without some kind of blameworthiness. And you're doing it in a way by trying to bring in the notion of involuntariness. Which is from our kind of actus reus discussion. OK. All right. Uh, and you're doing it factually. Right, you're not doing something legally here. Right. Cecilia is raising a legal argument, you're responding with a factual argument, but based on a legal principle. That, um, there can't be any criminal liability if there was only, if there wasn't any, any culpability. If it was just a reflex. An automatic reflex is not criminal liability. OK. All right. OK. And so we can have this, um, we can have the legal argument. Uh, let's go to the factual argument. What would be your arguments, uh, Shreya, that there is in fact what could be considered something like premeditation here.

SPEAKER 5
Well, um, we can refer refer to the facts that said that the victim and defendant were in a heated argument or the victim was joking, so he says, but the defendant perceived it as an attack on him, so we can argue that in that short time period there was premeditation.

SPEAKER 0
Uh, OK. All right. So you can try and do some time framing where you kind of expand the moment that they're actually arguing with each other and say that that was giving birth to premeditation. OK. Is there anything else, um, Shuru, that you can point to, to try and think about premeditation in this case? Working. Um, oh, yeah, so I would probably say that, um, Um, so like there was a time lapse when he walked towards the victim and um the vic and and then the victim also made fun of him, um, saying that he's taking his clothes off. um, I would try to expand that, um, time frame, um, saying that there was definitely time for, um, to form an intent. OK, all right, so you're, you're doing the Kalman piece as well, um, trying to expand the time frame and create kind of premeditation during that time. Heather, anything else for the prosecution?

SPEAKER 6
Um, perhaps you could say that he removed his gloves before approaching the victim. So, in the time frame that he removed his gloves, um, to like stabbing the victim, that showed premeditation.

SPEAKER 0
Also, he had a knife on him. Right? He was carrying a knife, right? Was that premeditation? OK, um, what would you argue, Emily, factually to try and move away from premeditation in this particular case?

SPEAKER 7
Um, I don't don't have a mic, but I would point to the fact that, um, the defendant and the victim had a good relationship up until that point, like they were friends at work.

SPEAKER 0
OK. All right. um, and what would that go to in our Anderson categories? Actually, Noah, what would that be?

SPEAKER 4
I believe that's the second one referring to motive, something

SPEAKER 0
about motive, right? OK, they were friends, they were friends, you'd say, right? OK, um, what else have you got for me, uh, Michael?

SPEAKER 8
It wasn't a particularly well planned crime. It was kind of just a stab in the neck. He was immediately found to be guilty. It's not like he lured him into some sort of valley or anything like that, so there's no real evidence of this being well planned in any way. OK, no planning activity, you would say, right?

SPEAKER 0
Another one of the Anderson, uh, Daniel. Anything else?

SPEAKER 9
Um, yeah, I might say that, um. So in response to the prosecution's argument that he had a knife on him, he was also a dishwasher at a steakhouse, so it wouldn't be. Unreasonable for him to have a knife for something other than uh killing his co-worker.

SPEAKER 0
OK, and, um, OK. Um, and then we would need to know something about the knife itself. Uh, was it some kind of Bowie knife or, and actually in West Virginia, I did a little research carrying a knife, whether it's legal or not, it's gonna depend on the type of the knife, how is it in the pocket, whether it's concealed or clipped in the pocket visibly. And then what kind of a knife it is, right? So we would need to know. I mean, clearly if it was the case, which I don't believe it was, but if it was the case that actually that was a kitchen knife that he was cleaning, then that would even reduce more from the kind of the motive, uh, of the case, right? Uh, Huo Qing. Anything more you can add for the defense? Well, since it's not planned, so, um, not planned, yeah, so, so I would argue that this act is out of an impulsion. There's no way for us to see that he is carrying that knife for the purpose of committing the crime. OK. So, you're taking kind of, you're taking the Anderson categories and basically trying to argue, and that's what you've been doing here, that as a factual matter, right? There's no planning, there's no motive, and there's no You know, what? What, what did I forget? Manner and the manner itself, right, is not a preconceived design, right? There was, there was, I mean, it's clear that it was not planned the day before, that there was nothing about it the day before and the question of like how fast did it take for him to come up with this premeditate, I mean it's like there was not, there would be nothing on your Anderson scales, right? All right, um. Let's stop here because we're running out of time. Um, we will conclude, uh, we will start by going just quickly through the Carroll case and the Forrest case, OK? Um, and then we'll move to the next topic on Thursday, OK? All right. Thanks. Oh
