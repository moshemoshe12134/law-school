I I Yes. uh. That is like a. I. Yeah. person I If it 8, I got a 10. Hey Exactly, exactly. I like wasn't All right. All right. Welcome everyone. Welcome back. So, this week we turn to questions of punishment theory and. Philosophical questions about. What we're doing in the criminal law imposing sanctions. And we're going to have 3 sessions this week. The first session we're going to discuss the various theories of punishment that exist out there and that you will utilize and hear that are very common, things like retribution, rehabilitation, etc. Um, on Thursday, we'll turn to Michel Foucault's book Discipline and Punish and discuss that and try and understand how it relates to these questions of theories of punishment. And then on Friday we'll do some historical work to start thinking about what we could think of as being the function of punishment or the function of the law actually more broadly. Now, uh, You have to understand when you are thinking about punishment, and when you are reading about punishment and debating punishment today in any particular case. That Forms of punishment over human history. Have changed dramatically over time. And that At every moment. Kind of. A vast majority of people in society believed that those methods were right. Some thought that they were divine, right? But that they were basically. The right way to engage in. What happens after there has been harm in society, OK? And so you have to realize that kind of punishment has gone, punishment practices have gone through. Remarkable changes over human history. And at times have involved things like compensation. Right? Blood geld. Right, if a person was murdered. Right, the family would seek compensation. From the murderer. And that was the way in which punishment was administered. OK. There was a certain price. To life. And there would be forms of simply monetary compensation. And determinations of guilt were uh Done on very different. In very different ways. Right, so both the criminal law determination of guilt and the criminal law forms of punishment have varied dramatically over history. And have always been viewed at the time as the best way to deal with the criminal law and punishment. OK. There were times when crimes were addressed. Through battle. OK. Someone was someone was accused of having committed a crime. The determination and the resolution would have been achieved through battle. Right. James Whitman, a historian, has a great book on trial by battle, and that was the way in which accusations of crime were resolved. Now we look today at trial by battle and we think, boy, that's really irrational, right? We've got juries, it works a lot better. I mean, this make, I mean this makes no sense. What, how do you, how do you, You know, I mean, for instance, this could be a battle between someone who was harmed and someone who was accused of harming them, or it could be a battle between two people who are accused of having harmed someone to determine which one loses would be the person who is actually the real culprit. And you're probably familiar with this from. From what? Game of Thrones, right? Yeah, OK. So, um, now, We think it makes no sense today. But actually, it made all the sense in the world. Right. OK, who's a Game of Thrones person? Why did it make sense? Uh, well, based on my recollection, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we can, we can do rough recollection. That's fine. Um, we don't have to confess that we're still watching Game of Thrones.

SPEAKER 1
The like the implication was that thanks the implication was that if somebody won in a trial by battle then they were. Like divinely sanctioned, yes.

SPEAKER 0
Right. Is the hand of God, right? It's not by accident that you win. And it's not just your mere strength, it's the fact that God intervenes. God is intervening and telling us who is the culprit and who is not. Right. That makes much more sense than a jury, doesn't it? I mean, if you believe. If you believe, why would you trust? Ignorant laypeople. To decide this, when in fact we could have divine intervention. Deciding it Right? So there were all different kinds of ways of thinking about this, right? In Germanic, in feudal times. Uh, under in Germanic law, there was a system of oath taking. And essentially the way it worked was if you were accused of a homicide. If you could line up. 9 or 12 highly respected Persons from the community. Then you could prove your innocence. And in fact, the way it would work sometimes is that it would be a comparative. Of who had the most highly respected people who would swear for them. Right? Who would take an oath. That that this person is an honest person. And it was a system of social status. What they were, what they were actually achieving, I mean we look at it now. I mean, I look at it now and I think, well, what were they doing? They were, they were trying to achieve, they were trying to kind of reflect social status. To see who had. The best Social connections and reputation that would have led us to believe that they were in fact. Honest people. Right? But of course it was, it was, it depended entirely on social status and. On these questions of, you know, where you stood in the, in the social order of society. Trial by water. Was another form of divine intervention. A trial by fire was a form of divine intervention. And then of course there was the Inquisition. Right, which was a measured. Form of interrogation and also punishment, OK? And it was believed, and we'll see, we're going to look at on Friday, we're going to look at some cases involving enslaved persons in the United States. But this notion of torturing someone. Um, goes back all the way to the Romans and the Greeks. And in fact, we'll see. Under Roman law, you could not not torture an enslaved person to get their testimony. In other words, that was the only way you could interrogate them. OK. And it was very rational. As you'll see on Friday. It made sense that you would need to torture someone who is enslaved. Think about it. You've got till Friday to figure out why. But it makes total sense. And it was codified. In Roman law. And it was a practice in ancient Greece. Uh, of course, the Inquisition came back, well, the Inquisition was a continuation of these modes, the Star Chamber in England. Um And then forms of brutal corporal punishment, right, the opening scene from Discipline and punish, the execution of Damian. Uh, who attempted a regicide on Louis the 15th in 1757, right? And you read all about it, and you have a completely different way in which we are expressing our outrage or punishing people. Then Maybe what we have today. At least that's part of the claim of Foucault's discipline and punish. That there was over the course of just 150 years. A radical transformation in the way in which we punish people, from the brutal corporal punishments in the 17th and 18th century. To these forms of regimented, very, uh, disciplined. Right, timetables, uh, uh, uh, arrangements of space of people. And discipline. To the point where, as Foucault suggests, we get to a form of what he calls panopticism, which we'll talk on Thursday. And this form of panopticism. is of course very different than what we see in the United States, I would argue. With the explosion. In incarceration starting in about 1973. Leading to these kinds of images, images of essentially warehousing of human beings, right? And it's hard to think that there's really much disciplining going on here. It's more a form of just. Kind of Massive incapacitation, warehousing. Something different. Alongside. Solitary confinement. That's being used still today. Forms of kind of engagement. Right. And of course the death penalty. Which has itself transformed dramatically from the public brutal forms of execution for Damien, for instance. To Uh, closed, private. Um Uh, middle of the night executions that are intended to take the form of kind of putting a pet to sleep. Right. So, there have been dramatic, and it's really important to get a sense of this because these are dramatic changes in punishment over time. Each of which has generally felt, whenever there has been a change, it has generally been felt as if it was a positive change, leading then to a status quo that was generally accepted by society. We in America tend to think that, well, I mean, I, I, I don't, but I, in general, we tend to think that, you know, if there has to be a death penalty. This is probably the way to do it right now. This is probably the best way to do it. lethal injection. It's not, it's not painful. It happens relatively quickly. It's kind of like euthanasing your dog or cat, and, you know, it, it, it does the job without ruffling too many feathers. Right. And in fact, you know, you start doing a firing squad and it's a little bit more controversial. Gas chamber, that's kind of controversial. But lethal injection, OK. We're OK with that, right? In the same way in which back then, we would have thought, well, let's just, I mean, it's a trial by battle, it's the only way to solve this. So the methods have changed, and the logics of punishment have changed dramatically, dramatically, uh, just over the last century. OK. So at the turn of the 20th century, say, in 1910, OK, what you would have had in terms of sentencing would have been a very, a form of individualized sentencing. With a large potential sentence, something like 3 years to life, say. With the person going before a parole board and essentially being released when the parole board decides. OK. That was called, was, that was, that was, that was called indeterminate sentencing basically. OK. You'd be sentenced to, you know, a term of life, uh, or, again, you know, 5 to life. Something really long. OK, and the expectation was, well, it'll be the Board of parole, the correctional system that will decide how long you're in prison. Uh, it, it was, it was a turn to individualized sentencing. In part it was brought about by the social sciences, which were really invented and came into birth at the end of the 19th century. And with the social sciences, there was this idea that, no, we can do things in a more scientific way. We can figure out who these folks are who are in prison, and we can figure out how long they need to be here. We can see how they behave. We can. Find out all of their background. We can see what kind of er programs they are in when they're in prison, and we can individualize it in such a way that we will get just the right sentence. Through this, uh, mechanism, right, of the Department of Corrections, right? The the very name of the entity that is principally in charge of punishment is itself a reflection of changing times and changing philosophies. Departments of corrections came into place at that period. When there was a notion of rehabilitation. They weren't called departments of corrections. They were called at times penitentiaries. Penitentiaries, which, as Foucault really shows us, was the idea of penitence, right, of religious penitence. They were called penitentiaries, they were called prisons, right? But they, but you don't call a prison today a prison. It's a, it's a, it's, it's in the Department of Corrections, right? And that was something that came into place at the, at about 1900. So there was this idea of indeterminate sentencing, right? And we would have the parole board that would determine when you get out, you would have probation instead of incarceration. Right, as a way to try and treat people, it was a rehabilitative model that came into place. There was a separate system for juveniles, completely separate system for juveniles. Juveniles were not criminally, um, were not criminally adjudicated, don't, they're not guilty. They're just adjudicated in the juvenile system. Their records are not supposed to go after with them. They're supposed to get out when they're 18. There were juvenile courts. We treated them differently, right? And we focused on individual traits. Today we've got a very different system. We don't really, I mean, now, it's 50 different states, so 50 different systems and the federal. Government, right? So, uh, and territories. So These are generalizations about kind of trends in America, but the trend in America has been away from indeterminate sentencing to what's, what is really now kind of a form of kind of actuarial prediction. OK. Um, actuarial, actuarial, uh, Actuarialism has a a fascinating history, um, in part because it started with the parole boards. Um It, uh, it started at, in, at Chicago, at the University of Chicago, where uh, a sociologist, Ernst Burgess, Started trying to predict who would violate parole. And he put together a metric with 21 factors that would predict. Which person would violate parole. It turned out that his research assistant, Ferris Lawn, then got appointed to the Board of Pardons and paroles in Illinois. And he then implemented the Burgess method. So you would, so what they would do is they would go through somebody's jacket. Right? Their, their, their folder. And try and figure out 2 these 21 factors. Create a score. And based on that score, they would decide whether or not the person would be released on parole. And some of those factors you might think were kind of Odd Some of them were racist and nationalist, so you would get a good score if you came from. Um Uh, I forget, the bad scores were Germany and Lithuania and being black. Uh, there was a, there was a determination, if you were black, you got an extra point, basically. Uh, this, by the way, this racial coding in these actuarial models lasted till at least 1974. In California in 1974, there was a four-factor test for parole, one of them was your race. OK. If you're interested in this, I've got an article called Risk is a proxy for race. I'll share it with you if you're interested. But they, but, uh, they would, they would use, they would, they would try and figure out, uh, try and figure out like your your social status. If you were a farm boy, that was a category, that was good. Got a good point for that. If you were a ne'er do-well. You got a negative point for that, ne'er do-well, that's the term of art, OK? ne'er do-well is your younger brother who kind of Can't get a job, but isn't like a bad egg, but it's just not able to kind of. Get moving, right? That's the ne'er do-well. That was the term of art. Hobos, there were hobo. I mean, if you're interested in this, I don't, I don't think there is anything in our materials about this. I'll share, I'll share some of the tables. The tables were just mind boggling. Um, On the basis of that kind of uh. Information Right, they would then decide whether you would get parole or not. Now, We find it shocking, but it's what operates today, OK? It's what operates today, because essentially what's happened is that people over time realized that it's not going to work to classify with ne'er do-wells or based on race anymore. It turns out that all of that stuff is mirrored. Very well by prior convictions and prior criminal contacts. OK. Why? Well, in part because we have racial profiling in our policing, mostly, right, which means that most of the policing is in certain neighborhoods that are often correlated with race, that results in more criminal contacts. Which means that if you just use criminal contacts, you're not using race, it's not racially discriminatory, right? It's just prior criminal contacts. And that's a neutral thing, right? And if you've got prior criminal contacts. You're a bad egg. Right? And it turns out that recidivism is the best proxy. For um recidivism. Or let's put it this way Although this isn't how they would say it, it's the best proxy for your likelihood of having another criminal contact. Right? So in a way, we're predicting the likelihood of having a criminal contact, which is, in effect, predicting where the police are going to be policing. Right. But we generally went towards an actuarial approach with fixed sentences rather than indeterminate sentence. Guidelines, ah, like the sentencing guidelines, mandatory, mandatory minimums, mandatory minimums, guidelines, truth in sentencing. Which was a movement from the 1980s, it's kind of like from the Reagan period on, the idea was, and the idea was, of course, everybody was like, oh well look, this person was sentenced to life. And they got out after 12 years. Right, well, of course that was, that was the intention. I mean, they were sentenced to life, the board of parole would determine when they would get out. But people reacted against this, saying there's no truth in sentencing. We don't know how long, it's not true. You, you tell, you tell a person who's gonna be sentenced to life and they only spend 5 years in. So there was a whole movement for truth in sentencing. The model became mostly incapacitation. We got supermax prisons galore. Juvenile courts basically were gutted through processes really of waivers, so juvenile waivers, so juveniles would be treated as adults, right. And most of the states kind of lowered the age at which a juvenile could be treated as an adult. So you'd be 14 years old, you could be treated as an adult, and basically that kind of guts the juvenile system. And instead of using individual traits, we use prediction of future dangerousness. OK. And that in large part is, so this is a, these are, these are, these are so fundamental changes in punishment practices. That you are, you, you're doing 360s, OK. I haven't watched any of the Olympics yet, but it's something as stunning, I'm sure. I think there's a great American skater right now who's doing something. I, all I saw was the headline. It's kind of like that, we've done those kind of flips in the way that we think about punishment. Take a simple look, for instance, at Now, uh, let me show you two kinds of sentencing schemes. This is the federal sentencing scheme, OK. This is the federal guidelines, basically. And you'll notice that the federal guidelines essentially, it's a matrix, it's a, it's a, it's got two axes on the matrix, OK. The horizontal one. Um, oh, I'm sorry. The, uh, Um, there's another column on the left. OK, the column on the left has the points, OK? And that is based on the level of the crime and then a bunch of other things. So for instance, uh, if you're robbing a bank, if you rob a bank that's insured by FDIC, you get 2 extra points. Don't ask me why. Um, if, so if you would use a gun, you would get extra points. If you confess guilt, you might get one less point, OK? So the axis, these are the, the, the, the. Y axis, OK, the vertical one gives you a point system about how bad your crime is, OK. But the other axis, which is the one that we're looking at here, is your criminal history, OK? And so basically, right, basically, It's all about recidivism, because, I mean, because the Federal Sentencing Commission tried to get the best tool to predict crime and then said, you know what? None of these tools, you know what? Recidivism is just the best thing. So you're in a criminal category, OK, if you've got priors, OK. And so basically, your sentence, right, for the same crime is gonna vary, you know, vary based on whether you've had prior criminal, uh, activity, OK, and basically it doubles if you've had prior criminal activity. OK, so the major, Kind of the major. Prediction form here turns simply to recidivism. And you see it similarly in, in, uh, in state sentencing schemes. So I'm showing you here a uh A sentencing, uh, uh. The sentencing. A form that is filled out by a judge in Virginia. Um Based on someone being found or pleading guilty to sexual assault, OK. And basically what the judge does is fill out this box, OK? So offender's age, start with the offender's age here, OK. Now if, and if you're younger than 35, you get 12 points here. If you don't have anything more than a 9th grade education, you get 4 points here. OK? Now, let me tell you, you don't wanna be getting points, OK? That's like more points, not good, OK? So basically, if you, if you're not well educated, you get 4 points. If you're not regularly employed, you get 5 points. Um, and then based on kind of, uh, prior adult felony misdemeanor arrests, you can get, you know, if you've got 4+ misdemeanors, you get 15 points. 2 felonies plus 4 misdemeanors, you get 15 points. Prior incarceration, you get points. Uh, if you had any mental health treatment. You, you don't get a point, but if you've had no mental health treatment, um, uh, you get 4 points. Um, if you've had prior alcohol or drug treatments, you get 3 points. OK, and the judge just. Calculates the sum total here. And then you're basically, if you've got 44 points or more, you've got level one, level two, or level three, right? So you, you, I mean the defendant wants to be in the bottom with no adjustment, but basically what these levels do is they can multiply the length of your incarceration, say, by, you know, 100%, 300%, OK. And this is the way. We are sentencing people, OK? Right? So if you, if you dropped out of school. You're going to get sentenced more. You don't have a regular job, you're gonna get sentenced more. If you've had prior criminal contacts, you're gonna get sentenced more, right? And these are all determinations that are trying to figure out. Who is likely to be a dangerous person in the future, right? And you know, I mean using age is um you know, that's one of the most constant findings of social science is that there's a age crime curve, right? People age out of uh out of delinquent behavior. Right, uh, so they're using that kind of that social science. To then inform the sentencing, all right. So this gives you in a way kind of A reality check This is very different than trial by battle. You know, It's really very different. And one of the things that is incumbent on us is to think historically. To ask ourselves, like, you know, how did we get here? And why are we so firmly. Um, confident. That where we are makes sense. OK. Now, um, so. Underlying all of these different histories of punishment have been some very consistent philosophical theories of punishment. And these theories of punishment. Play a role in sentencing. And you'll see when we discuss the death penalty. We're going to have a week on the death penalty actually. I need to see when that week is. I think it should be next week. I don't know if it is next week. Sometimes I move things around and so I'm going to check. I think we should do the death penalty punishment. I don't know if I put constitutional limits afterwards. But in any event, um, when we discuss the death penalty, you'll see these theories of punishment are very important as to kind of like, what are the purposes. They're very important to any, any form of sentencing, right? Because they give us an idea of what, uh, what the sentence should be. All right, so let's try and understand these now. Uh, and what we're gonna do actually is we're gonna use the. Fire case from Comotana. All right. So we're going to be thinking about punishment for uh Mr. and Mrs. Moretti. OK, who are the club owners, OK. Um, I don't take questions, but go ahead. Yes, it was regarding sentencing guidelines, so I, I, no, no, we'll talk about it later. OK. OK. All right, Moretti. OK, um, so, uh. Let's, uh, let's try and get some sense here. Of what the different theories would tell us about Moretti. OK. And let's, let's talk about Jacques Moretti, uh, the husband here. OK. Um, well, both. OK. Both. Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Moretti, uh, you know, all the, you know, all the, you, you, you've gotten a good sense. We talked about it last time. All right. If we came to it from, uh, so there are different ways that we could, we could think about it. Let's, let's assume for a minute that we know the facts, OK? What can we agree on? What can the, what can the prosecution and the defense agree on? Go ahead, Sylvie. I mean we can we can agree on the outcome like there was, right, 41 are dead right now. There may be more right due, due to this fire in this bar that we can agree on, right? OK. What else? We can agree on the fact that the place was not um inspected for 5 years. And. We can agree that we can agree that it was likely the uh foam on the ceiling that resulted in the fire. We can agree that. The foam was flammable. And the question becomes, who's responsible for that, right? Was it the, was it the waitress on the shoulders? Was that a policy? Was whatever, whatever, OK. Let's assume for a second that they've been convicted of either criminal negligence. Or some kind of involuntary manslaughter. So basically, let's assume that a jury has found them either. Um, Objectively unreasonable in some way. Or uh that they were reckless in some way. And let's assume that there's a conviction here, OK? Right, so we've got a jury conviction that finds that a reasonable person would have taken more care. Somehow Or possibly that there was some recklessness. Now let's assume for a minute that there has been this determination. Of guilt. Uh, the other case we're going to have in the back of our mind is the Baxter case, OK? Um, the case, Sarah Stillman's case from The New Yorker about the, the kid who's basically breaking into cars and his co-defendant, uh, has an accident and kills two bicycle, uh, uh, 22 cyclists. OK. But let's, let's focus on Moretti for, for a minute. How do, how do these different theories, what are these different theories, how do they cut in? Into this, OK? Uh let's start with the Kantian approach, which is a retributivist approach, OK? And let's try and figure out what What, what that would lead us to, Cecilia. Do you want to kick us off a little bit with, with how, how do we think that a kind of Kantian would think about the punishment in this case?

SPEAKER 2
I mean, I think a Kantian would, um, insist that the punishment can't be instrumental towards an end, right? Like the punishment actually has to, um, affect upon this person, um, who committed. The crimer is guilty or culpable, like, yes.

SPEAKER 0
So that is one of the kind of like first and uh primary uh principles of a Kantian approach. The punishment cannot be used as a means to achieve something else. OK. And, and that's based on, on what Kantian idea basically.

SPEAKER 2
Um, oh. I mean. Just like a non-instrumentalism of people. So perhaps the fact that people are all ends and not means, we treat people as ends and not as

SPEAKER 0
means, right? We treat people as ends and not as means. You can never treat another human being as a means to achieving something else from a Kantian perspective, OK. So that means that you have to focus entirely, as you were suggesting, on what?

SPEAKER 2
Um, I think on what they did wrong, definitely on

SPEAKER 0
what they did, yes, yes, as a reflection of what?

SPEAKER 2
Like their moral culpability, yes, as a reflection of their

SPEAKER 0
moral culpability, right, or their blameworthiness. Right? So you have to measure the person's moral failing. OK, you have to get a measure of the person's moral failing in this case. All right. OK. Now, Uh, I want you four to be Kantians, so Shreya, um. What, what, how, how does that help us think this through? For, for Moretti, sorry.

SPEAKER 3
I think because Kantians would favor retributive justice, it should focus simply on what the person did and tailor the punishment to that and not focus on deterrence as much.

SPEAKER 0
Exactly, right, yes, yes, that's true, um. So we're not focusing on deterrence, we'll try and figure out what that means in a minute. Uh, but how do we measure moral failing here? What was the moral failure here?

SPEAKER 3
I'd say the moral failure was to take reasonable care or take the steps necessary to prevent the harm from occurring.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah, OK, OK. Now let's assume for a minute that they were convicted simply of negligent homicide. OK. Defense counsel, uh. Sorry, uh, Amara? Um, how do you respond to the Kantian argument here? And I take it the Kantian argument here was There was a moral failure on their part, which was not to take sufficient care. Maybe by putting in flammable sound stuff on the roof or something like that. How do you respond as defense counsel to that claim, and the conviction here is for negligent homicide?

SPEAKER 4
Um, I think maybe the best argument you could make is like around intent and knowledge of, of the fact of whether. The owners knew for a fact that that would be the result. In that case, like, if there's a question of knowledge or intent, then I think that sort of lessens the moral culpability.

SPEAKER 0
Yes. So what you're saying is, well, wait a minute, this was negligent homicide. This meant that they weren't necessarily aware of this. They weren't aware of it. We're saying a reasonable person should have been aware. OK, but they weren't aware. That's what the jury found here. Negligent homicide does not involve awareness and a deliberate kind of denial of of an awareness of a risk, right? So your argument here to the Kantian theory is, well, yeah, we're, I'm with you, Kant. I'm totally with you, it's gotta be a moral failure on the part of this individual. But this individual did not have that, there's no finding that this individual had that moral failure. Right? Because this individual was just found negligent. Not necessarily aware of this. Does the, does the, does the Now, What do you think as a Kantian Shuru? Heather. Shuru first.

SPEAKER 5
Sorry, can you repeat the question? So what do you think as a Kantian of that

SPEAKER 0
argument, which is the argument is. defendant should not receive any punishment. Because the defendant was not aware of the risk. And to make the defendant, here's the strongest argument, to make the defendant punishable, even though she and he were not found to be aware of the risk. Is in some sense to treat them as a means to something else. I don't know, you've got something else going on, but it's not, Moral dessert. How do you respond?

SPEAKER 5
Um, I think the rationale of retribution is that the punishment has to be proportional to the realm, so I would argue that it doesn't really matter if if the defendant is aware of the wrong. We just have to make sure that the sentence is proportional to that wrong, and we have to punish that, and that is the rationale of retribution.

SPEAKER 0
OK, and then, so what would the sentence be in that case?

SPEAKER 5
Um, maybe just to look at the, um, like past records and to see, um, if the society hasn't agreed upon like any proportionality of that realm so that we can determine, um, like based on the past records, um, we like we we can have a standard of that punishment.

SPEAKER 0
OK. All right. OK. So this is a tricky problem. This is a tricky problem, right? So the response here. To the defense is something like, well, We We, we can't be sure of their individual. Awareness of it. But what we're saying is that they, by contrast to the rest of us. Had some kind of failure. So like we're not sure. I mean, so, so what you're saying basically kind of uh the content now the content and the continent here could take two positions. But let's go with this one. The Kantian could say, look, the finding of negligence somehow reflects the fact that this person was not. Morally Reasonable. Even if they didn't know Even if they didn't know that they were being morally unreasonable, they were, they were being, they were acting in an unreasonable way. And maybe that is enough. So in other words, we might not be able to go into the mind of the person, but we can say that their behaviors were their behaviors were unreasonable, that's what you've said. Jury with the negligence finding. And that unreasonableness has a bit of a moral dimension to it. Heather, I take it, could you as a Kantian agree with defense counsel?

SPEAKER 2
Um, possibly if you were to say, OK, so defense counsel is saying that. Um, negligence because you are basically failing to act reasonably. There should be no punishment for that because it's like more subjective, um, looking at what the person failed to do. I, well, because it's because it's more objective looking at

SPEAKER 0
what a reasonable person would have done and not caring too much about what this person did, yeah, yeah, um,

SPEAKER 2
I mean. In that case, like, it's not an eye for an eye because they, there was no action, right?

SPEAKER 0
How do you do the, how do you do the equilibration here, right? So the Kantian, the Kantian idea is that you have demonstrated some moral failing. And whatever quantum of moral failing. Is the quantum of punishment you should receive. That there's gotta be a relationship, an equitable relationship, it's like balances, it's kind of like balances between your moral wrongdoing. And your punishment. So that the world gets rectified in a way, right? It is as if it's a balance, and all of a sudden there has been wrong done, and we need to get back to the same place. Right? OK And you're saying it's possible from a Kantian perspective that it would be hard to determine what that wrongdoing is, even if we say there was an act that was unreasonable and how you would balance it out. It's easy in a case of intentional homicide, for instance, because we know that the intentionality of the homicide is this horrible act and so, you know, we know that, you know, it's a moral act and so we can kind of counter it through for Kant and execution, right? A murder for a murder, but in a case like this, it's kind of, it's just unclear as to whether or not the balance is really skewed and how you would, how you would rectify that balance. Now, you could take a completely different perspective, OK, so let's take, for instance, ah, let's go to um, Let's go to uh Bentham. Charlie, did you catch Bentham? How would someone like Bentham think about this case? So you get a flavor of Bentham. On page, uh, what is it, 97 of the 11th section of the 11th edition. No. That's, uh, what, what page? 16. OK, thanks. Yeah. OK. Um, so what do we think? How, how does, how does Bentham approach this? And, and notice just one last thing before you guys get going on, on Heather. Um, You have to understand that all of these. Punishment theorists. We originally trying to limit punishment. OK. All right. And I think it's really important to keep that in mind. These theories were originally intended to be enlightenment theories that limit punishment in a In a dark age. OK. Now we tend to associate today retributivism with like vengeance and, you know, we tend to think of Kantian retributivism as being really vengeful and. As kind of multiplying punishment, and there are certain passages in, in what he writes that seem extreme. Like when he says, if a society is disbanding from an island, did you read that little passage? If a society is disbanding from an island and everybody is going to go live elsewhere and there's one person in prison for murder, they need to kill that one person. Before they disband their society. Otherwise, they're going to be kind of marked by that moral failure. Right? So, now, you know that sounds, that's, that's pretty, whoa. Can't, I mean, like, wait a minute. Give that dude a pass. You guys are leaving, you know, let him, let him go somewhere too, right? I mean, that seems woo, harsh. Extreme But keep in mind that what he's trying to do is limit punishment by saying you can only punish if there's a moral failure on the part of the actor, and your punishment has to be limited to that. OK. Charlie, what's, what's Bentham's kind of approach to this?

SPEAKER 6
Yeah, I mean he has a utilitarian approach. So, so like punishment is kind of seen as a lesser evil. It's still like, um, any type of punishment or like infliction of Physical pain or restriction of liberty is seen as an evil, but if it's used for a greater evil, it's really important, right?

SPEAKER 0
That's really important. Bentham is saying any punishment is bad. OK, keep that in mind, he wants to say, all right? Every single time you are punishing someone, you are creating pain. And pain is bad, it's a negative, OK? Life is very simple. There's pleasure and there's pain, and what you wanna do in life is maximize pleasure and minimize pain, all right? No pain, no gain, bullshit. All right. I mean, actually, maybe from a utilitarian perspective, you could make some kind of argument, but the real point here is, OK, all forms of punishment are pain, OK? So, You gotta to limit it to, and, and he's gonna limit it on utilitarian grounds, you say. All right. So what are some of those utilitarian grounds that would apply here?

SPEAKER 6
Uh, one is definitely deterrence in the sense that, um, he kind of sees most people as still rational actors and um if the pleasure that they get or the, the gain that they get from committing a crime is not worth the pain, then they might be deterred from committing that crime. Exactly.

SPEAKER 0
All right. OK. So the big one is going to be deterrence. Now, how would, what would that sound like, uh, Kyle, what would that sound like in the Moretti case?

SPEAKER 7
Um, you would only wanna punish the Morettis insofar as you could prevent, um, maybe another kind of club owner or, you know, someone similarly situated from being negligent and having a big disaster like that one.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah, right. OK, now you could be thinking, uh, gen then what you just mentioned is what's called general deterrence. OK. General deterrence being like the deterrence that's gonna apply to other people. OK. So other people are gonna learn about what happened to the Morettis. And you're saying, we want them to learn what happened to the Morettis and then say to themselves, 00, what, what I, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm gonna get rid of my, um, Uh, uh, ceiling stuff in my club. I'm gonna check with whatever, we're not gonna have any sparklers, you know, uh, we're gonna, we're gonna, whatever it is, it's gonna, it's all you want other people and, and how much do you need for that, do you think?

SPEAKER 7
Like how much punishment? Yeah, how much punishment. That's hard to say like I mean again like you wouldn't wanna like make an example of someone necessarily but like you would want enough for it to be noticeable where people feel like um it's again like kind of Charlie was saying like the the gain I guess or the cost benefit of keeping the club or uh the social scene as it is is not worth the potential penalty.

SPEAKER 0
Right, yeah, yeah, so it's uh it's tough to find the right amount, um. But you want to engage in some kind of equation, right? Uh, Bentham would say, some kind of equation such that. Let's see now. Such that The expected punishment. Would exceed somehow the expected benefit. So you might wanna, so now, now this would be, now you could be thinking about this in terms of specific deterrence, which means specific deterrence as to the Morettis themselves. Or you could be thinking about this in terms of general deterrence, general deterrence for all of the other club owners, for all of us. OK? Cause we probably all have fire hazards in our homes, right? OK. Now, and the idea here is basically, ah, you could be thinking about the Morettis, or you could be thinking about other people, but basically you, what Bentham is kind of saying with his deterrence is the idea that, well, We want people who And there's a, there's a basic assumption here of rational actors, right? So there's a rational actor theory here. But we want people to kind of like figure out, wait a minute, um. So there's like shit, if this happens, OK, there's a 90% probability of detection in a case like this. I mean it's actually it might even be 100%, right? detection is not going to be like this in most cases. Actually, in most cases it's going to be very low detection. Criminal justice system catches very few people who are accused of crime. Here it's pretty high. It's probably, let's say, OK, it's 100%. If you've got a fire, you're going to be detected. And the probability of detection times the probability of the likely punishment. So this is where the Moretti punishment comes in because it's like, OK, well people are gonna say, ah, you got 1 year, you can do 1 year in prison, or 5 years in prison, or 3 years of community service. Or something that has some kind of a price tag to it, expected punishment, and then you say that has to be more than whatever the expected benefit was, right, because there was benefit from this, they, they, they probably, they you know they must have a lot I don't know. I don't know. I'm sorry, I don't know about the clients, but I assume they're pretty well off. And, you know, they, they're, they're probably millionaires. And they've probably got, you know, a villa here and a boat here and a, you know, chalet here and whatnot as a result of the club being so popular, right? So there was definitely benefit in having such a popular club, overcrowded, lots of revenue, right? And so you'd have to make some kind of an equation to figure out what it is that people would be thinking, OK, it's not worth it to me. OK. And you have to think, people, and this assumes that people are kind of. Rational actors and stuff like that, so you come in with, say, I don't know, what do you think, uh. Well, what do you think? What are we doing? Prison time? Um, I guess it would depend on the expected benefit. If it's a lot, then a lot of punishment would be seemingly a right deterrence. So the expected benefit, the expected benefit from this was that they are very wealthy people and they're probably living a pretty good life. As they, they, they, they probably, they're probably living a much, they were probably living a much better life than, than, than most of us. Sitting here. In law school Instead of being on some sea slope having a nice ho. All right, go ahead. So just take away a little bit from that, uh, good life to take the measures that and the punishment would be something like. Um What do you think is gonna, what do you think is gonna be the optimal amount? OK. Yeah, it's gotta be the optimal amount that 1, deters the rest of us, but 2, Does not inflict more than necessary, right? Because anything more than necessary is pure pain. Anything more than necessary is, is, is a reduction in social welfare, right? So it might be taking away their benefits that they got as a result of not taking care. Oh, OK, so maybe the answer is forfeiture. Forfeiture of their wealth. Forfeiture, forfeiture of their wealth, and now you're thinking compensation, right? You're actually that, so that brings us back to a whole different model of punishment, right? Ah, you're not so sure, Charlie?

SPEAKER 6
Yeah, um, like, I, I used to work in the nightlife industry and, um, It's like there's a, there's a saying like when you're in a space like uh the, the club that got caught on fire, it's like this old wooden building, overcrowded, like you just shouldn't use pyro in an environment like that, like anything fire-based, and it's just like, there's been so many accidents and like tragedies from irresponsible club owners doing stuff like that to thinking that There's just some marginal gain from like having a little extra flare. It's just not worth it. So like I think it should be punished more severely for sure to, to, to just set an example for other people.

SPEAKER 0
OK, so you're saying to set an example, you're saying also because in a way it happens so often it, it seems like it's so common that there are these problems and people aren't kind of. You know, they're not waking up. We need to wake people up to this. This is a big problem. Now, uh, and so, right, now, how, how do you, how do you defend against something, some acclaim like that? Uh, sorry, it, um, Jasmine.

SPEAKER 8
I think that assumes a sort of knowledge about the risk. Like if you're trying to do this calculation of what was the benefit versus, um, like the pleasure that came from that versus the punishment, like you would have to know and in this case, it didn't seem as they, as if they knew and the regulations should have came from, as we talked about last class of jurisdiction, it didn't really come from them and in that particular space, they didn't need to have certain precautions that maybe other bigger clubs would need to have. So that wasn't really their responsibility to.

SPEAKER 0
All right, so you're saying something, I think the thrust of what you're saying is, well wait a minute here, like this rational actor model is a little bit problematic here because our, our clients, they weren't doing this calculation. They weren't they weren't doing this calculation. That's not how they operated and that's not how people operate, in fact, and if the problem is, Charlie, that you know. You know, I mean, it seems obvious to you to try and skip the pyrotechnics because you have, you know, because you have experience. But, but there, it's happening all the time. It's happening all the time because, because there are, because there are other human emotions going on here than pure rationality, right? It's because it's December 31st and people have been drinking a lot, and people are having fun, and That's it. I mean it was, it was an overexuberance of kind of the moment, but people were not thinking rationally. People were not engaging in kind of deterrence-based, rational kind of expectations models. It's just, it's not, you're just, it's not, you're not taking human beings as human beings. I mean, if everybody was as rational as you, and as rational as you'd like us to be, of course this wouldn't happen. But how can you treat someone on in a kind of like in a rational basis deterrence model when, you know, all these, these, You know, the waitress was possibly high. Um, they were just having a lot of fun. I mean, it was a fun scene. There was a lot going on. There was a lot of music. It was techno, they were just like. Out of their minds, right? What is it, how do you make sense of the, how do you make sense of the rationality of the underlying the theory? In a place where we just need to be kind of realistic about human emotions and, and stuff, right? Now, um, how are you all feeling for the prosecution in terms of these different theories? Uh, let's see, it wasn't Maxwell, it was Ramia that we started there, wasn't it? Um, Romeo. What are you leaning, are you leaning towards Kant? Are you leaning towards Bentham? Where are you leaning right now as a prosecutor?

SPEAKER 9
Um I mean, if we're trying to increase, um. Their punishment, um, I think, or their sentence, um, it seems like Bentham is probably a better route, but if it's, if you're asking me personally, well, yeah, I mean,

SPEAKER 0
I'm asking you as a prosecutor, and prosecutors aren't necessarily supposed to be out for simply increasing the punishment, right? Supposedly prosecutors are there to do justice. Um, however, however, the, There is a tendency to think that justice. Involves enforcement, otherwise, you're typically not a, a prosecutor, but yeah, I mean, you can put on your justice hat too.

SPEAKER 9
I will say like based on what, um, defense and prosecution do agree on, which was the, except the facts that you mentioned earlier, professor, um, based on the lack of inspections combined with, you know, the, um, the risk and having the dangerous ceiling covering, um. It seems like you could take a position under either theory that means that like excessive punishment beyond, um, the actual culpability of, um, Of the negligence would be would be too much.

SPEAKER 0
OK, um, all right, so you're, you're toning down the. Deterrence with some Kantian moral analysis. Now, OK, now one thing that's not fair is to suggest that Bentham would be more punitive. Then K, right? So I mean, that wasn't my point, Charlie, and In, in, in, in, in, in pushing you towards utilitarianism. I mean, again, uti Bentham, Bentham was trying to reduce punishment. To what is socially optimal. Right? He's not now. We think of deterrence as being, today, we think of deterrence as being this really kind of maximal. Theory of punishment, but it wasn't originally, right? Remember, anything in excess of whatever is necessary from a deterrence perspective is pain and is not. A good thing socially. So, so don't, don't think that like Bentham and deterrence would necessarily be the big bad wolf here. Or that Kant would necessarily be the big bad wolf. In a way, both of them are. Arguments that are helping you try and figure out what is the right balance of, of punishment, I take it. Now, um, a couple of quick things. So, on deterrence, the Bentham, the response to the. Kind of argument I was making about. Look, there aren't rational actors necessarily is we now have more sophisticated law and economic theories about crime and punishment. Um, maybe too sophisticated, but basically, and we'll be studying this as well, we'll have a little section on this, but, uh, Gary Becker and the economists at, uh, the University of Chicago created theories of the, um, economic theories of crime and punishment. Where what Becker basically said was, well, this analysis, this analysis that I gave you was, is a little bit too simple. OK. Um, this, this deterrence stuff is a little bit too simple because, um, what you have to do instead is just approach things as any economist would and figure out, uh, and we'll, we'll do more of this in detail, but figure out the sweet spot, really. Um, figure out a sweet spot of where it's best for society, uh, to have, um, to, to place punishment. Why? Because, Uh, it turns out that you have to realize that putting someone, say, in prison for 3 years is a big cost to society. Right? And it's a big, it's a big cost to them, but it's a big cost to us. And that you're never gonna bring down, you're never gonna bring down, uh, criminal offenses to zero. It would cost way too much. You'd have to have a total police state, and a police state is very expensive. So you have to put in the costs of policing into the equation. And it turns out that there's going to be actually a relationship. There's going to be, you're going to make a function. Where you're basically trying to figure out how do we reduce total costs in society. What what are the costs? Well, the, the fire is the cost. There's 41 deaths are a cost, right? 41 deaths are a cost, but so is the inspection. Right? And if we had had yearly inspections, those would be costs too. How many inspections do you wanna have? And putting people in prison is a cost. And all of the, like, that's a big cost. And so what you wanna get is to a place where the, The punishment brings it down to a level that is actually optimal for society, and it turns out that maybe the optimal level is, you know, a few club fires with a smaller number of deaths. There's actually an optimal number of homicides in society. It's not 0 But to get to 0. We would need to have pretty much a cop next to each one of us. To get to 0, we'd all have to be handcuffed. OK, and that's going to create costs for society that are unbearable. So there's a, so according to the economist, the sophisticated economist, the Nobel Prize winning economist, right, there's an optimal level of crime. There's an optimal level of sexual assaults in society. There's an optimal level of robberies. There's an optimal level of homicides, and there's an optimal level of club fires. And you have to figure out what that is, and that's going to determine, so it's not. The strict old fashioned deterrence. It's a social welfare calculus. What would be the what would be the optimal punishment for the Morettis? With the optimal amount of policing. And incarceration. That would create the greatest benefit to society. You're maximizing social welfare, OK? And it's not just a simple calculation of what to expect and what not to expect, OK? All right, now, um. So, uh, I, I'll, I'll explain that more. It's a bit of a complicated concept, but, um, uh, but it's, it's fascinating. Um, now, so we have really two big poles of punishment theory. Uh, one is the Kantian informed retribution theory, and then the other generally is called deterrence, I mean, sorry, utilitarianism. But within utilitarianism there are other theories as well. Theories that try to achieve something through punishment, right? And that can be. Uh, uh, rehabilitation, all right, so trying to transform the individual through a rehabilitative process, or it can be simple incapacitation. All right, so the idea here is that we're not trying to change people, we're simply trying to lock them up so that they can't commit another crime. OK. Those theories, and we'll kind of start here on Thursday before going into Foucault, are theories that are utilitarian in the sense that you are trying to achieve other ends through the punishment of an individual. OK, um, uh, it's not as if, uh, it's not, it's, it's, it's, it's as if you are in a way, kind of instrumentalizing the punishment towards some goal that is different than just the purely moral equation at at play in a Kantian approach. OK. All right, so let's stop here, we'll pick up here, um, we'll continue a little bit with punishment theory. And then we'll talk about the Foucault discipline and punish, OK? Thank you. Thanks. Yeah. Um, would you say that? That's unfortunate. It's a very. You were I And it's relatively cheap to buy tar, right, right, and the only reason we don't do it is because we're not only about the. Uh, well, it could be, well, so it could be that it has bad effects. I mean, I mean that that that, yeah, that might. Like there might not be any marginal deterrence. Right, like if you're going to tar and feather someone. Then, then I suppose they, they would. There might be situations where you might want to Try and create some different forms of punishment so that people have an incentive not to do. You know what I mean, but if it's so bad already, they have no incentive not to do worse, or it could be that there's a It could be that there's a, that it backfires that the brutalization of society actually causes more people to get. Revolution what we're like revolutionary revolutionary. OK, good, thank you. I That was good.
