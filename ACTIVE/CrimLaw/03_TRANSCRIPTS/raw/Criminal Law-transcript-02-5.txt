I I was always Oh. What My circums. Tell your partner when he gets here. Tell your partner when he gets here. I I Like. OK, everyone. Um, All right, everyone. So, uh, let's see, we're going to try and, uh, this is gonna be like sweeper, OK? We're gonna try and sweep, uh, the end of homicide and causation, OK, and then talk about the Cole Montana case, OK? And everything that we're kind of sweeping actually ties into the Carl Montana case. So Carl Montana should be listening carefully to all of the Conversations that are going on, uh, here because they're perfectly relevant, OK? So what we have left to do, um, Well, here we go. All right, let's see, uh. Oh gosh, let's see. Um, Where we are here is um. Here OK, so this is where we are, right? Uh, we have pretty much done most of the categorical differences between different kinds of homicide. And now we're looking at the difference. This morning we're gonna, with Wlansky, we're going to look at the difference between um. Basically, something like involuntary manslaughter, involuntary manslaughter which would require recklessness, right? And actually maybe just civil liability under a negligence standard, OK, we're kind of going in between those zones, uh, where you wouldn't even hear you wouldn't, uh, civil liability on a negligence standard, kind of we're looking at the place where it becomes criminal, OK, where all of a sudden something becomes criminal and, um. Uh, and so, but in that space where something becomes criminal, uh, some states use a criminal negligence standard. So in some states you can have criminal responsibility. Under a simple negligence standard, some states will require that there be a criminal negligence standard, which is a little bit more negligence. Some states will not allow a negligence standard at all and will require instead the recklessness standard which triggers involuntary manslaughter. OK. So this is the space that we're working in. Now, the difference between civil liability and criminal liability is you, you know, you understand that very clearly, right? Civil liability is a private party, that's your torts. It's a private party suing someone. Uh, they can get money damages. But that's it. Just money damages. In the famous OJ Simpson case, right? The family of the victim sued OJ Simpson. And got a gets a money award, OK? Once it passes this line into the criminal. Right, then you have the state that's, that's the prosecuting entity, and you have Possible jail time. Well, you have possible prison time. The difference between jail and prison, jail is pre-trial, mostly, OK, so people are put in jail for pre-trial detention, predominantly, or for a short sentence. Usually if it's a sentence under a year, it'll be served in the county jail. OK. Um, prison is for longer term sentences beginning at about a year or so. Once you've been convicted, OK, so someone who's in prison has been convicted and has a sentence that is probably longer than a year. Someone who's in jail is either in pre-trial detention, er, can't afford bail, for instance, or serving a very short sentence on usually a a misdemeanor. OK. All right. So, uh, what we're gonna do is we're going to get through these last few cases, uh, Wilansky and, um, and Williams, Wilansky and Williams, mostly. Um, and then we're also gonna start talking about causation. Which is our final topic because when the question is if it's a result crime, right, then there's always a causation question was their death was the death the result of actions or omissions by this particular defendant? OK? And um so we're gonna be doing causation on the on the front row. And we're, we're gonna do the Wlansky and the Williams case and we're gonna sweep on the back row, OK. All right, so let's go, though, let's start with you, Gauthier. The Willansky case quickly. Um, let me ask you, uh, what was the, what was the verdict? What was the verdict for in the Willansky case? Um It was one of guilt for involuntary manslaughter, I believe. Uh, involuntary manslaughter, that is correct. OK. Charged with numerous counts of involuntary manslaughter. And um and what was the sentence, do you remember? Um I think it was 12 to 15 years, 12 to 15 years, that's correct, yes. uh. Uh, let's see now. So, uh, in the back row, I need some prosecutors and defense attorneys. Do I see Jeffrey and William there? OK, yeah, all right, give me some prosecution. And then, uh, going over to the defense side over here, is it Adeline? Yeah, hi. Vi Sophiaanghui. OK, give me some defense now. All right, so we've got a man we got an involuntary manslaughter here and um 12 to 15 years now. Did you get a sense, Gautier, of what the legal issue is here? You're the judge, so you're gonna have to be parsing out what they say here. Yeah, it seems to be whether the conduct in question, um, in this case, probably an omission of taking safe precautions amounts to a wanton or reckless conduct. OK, excellent. So first important point here. Is we're dealing with an omission case, right? It's one of our first omission cases here that we're dealing with actually. I mean we had the Jones case, remember, which set out the standard for omission. Um, do you remember the Jones case at all? No. OK, um, uh, who, who spoke about Jones? Elizabeth, did you, did you, were we, were we around here for Jones? Jones was the, the, the person who. Took care of a child. Remember, a small child. Does this ring any bells? I don't think we spoke about it, but we can. OK, great. All right, uh, sure, actually, sorry, that was Heather. I was it's catching Elizabeth behind you. Heather, Heather to Cecilia, what was the, what was the, um, yeah, you were relieved, Elizabeth, sorry, I'm happy to send it back to her. Alright, um, so, OK, so, uh, there were, there were 4, there were 4 places that created omission liability. Do you remember there were kind of like 4 situations that created omission liability, and there are 4 of you in your row. So what were those 4? Um, do you remember? Do you, did you want us to go like 1 by 1, or I can just say, OK. Um, and you can whisper to your co-counsel who's, who's, who's struggling to find the page. Go ahead. OK. Well, the first one was a statute imposes a duty of care, right, right. OK, so if there's a statute that imposes a duty of care, then, uh, omission liability applies and I mean, does this start to make any sense in your tort context now or not? Uh, yes, because it's like negligence per se, kind of if you fail to follow a statute, right? Yeah, right, if you fail to follow a statute, but also because in torts, right, you have to have a duty. Right. You can't, you can't have liability in torts unless you have a duty. Right? Am I, am I just making this up? I'm not making this up, right? This is like, is this is like torts 101. No, I mean this is the first thing you learn in torts. No, you have to have a duty. If you don't have a duty, it's like, fuck it. I got like I'm, I'm sorry, and I got no, I got no responsibility here, right? It's got the first thing is a duty, and here it's gotta be a duty because it's an omission. There's no act. It's not like. Now, usually with an act. What is the duty? Where does the duty come from usually? The statute? Yeah, what do you mean by the statute? Um, the law, yeah, what do you mean by the law? Like the, uh. Yes, like, you're the, it's, you're entirely right, it's the law. It's the, it's the, it's the, it's the penal code. It's the criminal code, right? It's the criminal code, right. Yes, it's the law. If the law says thou shalt not kill. That one goes back a ways, right? OK, but we got it in the NYPL say, simple enough. New York penal law says thou shalt not kill. Um, you know, the Massachusetts Bay Colony, when it started, it simply. Took as its criminal law Deuteronomy. Isn't that radical? It was like, ah, we don't need to make a criminal law, it exists already, right? So, uh, so they just like uh. That's it. And that's where the duty comes from. The duty in a usual in a criminal context comes from the penal code. That's your, those are your duties, and we set them out for you, and that's those are actions. In the omission context, we got to impose a duty. We do so in some cases with a statute. We might impose a duty. Like for instance, you need to report something. If you see a felony, you need to report it. That might impose a duty on you, OK? All right. A duty, what else can, what else, what else? And, and in torts, your duties, where do your duties come from in torts? Um, torts, I, I, I actually don't think we have like learned about the duty in torts, but supposedly, gosh, you guys, yeah, OK, I'm, I'm here I am helping teach torts, but it's gotta come from a, a legal decision, precedent, it's a, it's a court decision. Courts create things, court create torts in torts. Right, a court creates a duty not to inflict emotional distress, for instance. Right, that's created out of whole cloth, so it's like the judges, the wigs, the whole thing, they're like hm, should be a duty. Yeah you shouldn't be able to inflict emotional distress on somebody. OK, bingo. Now there's a duty. Now you breach the duty, that's it. You got civil responsibility. You'd be up there. No, you'd be up there, right, right there, bingo. Judges create that here we gotta have a statute that creates it, OK, so the first thing could be, but for omission could be a statute, could be what else quickly, um, the status relationship status relationship for sure, parent, child, um. Uh, Are there such things? What's the third thing?

SPEAKER 1
Where one has assumed a contractual duty to care for another, contractual duties, yeah, or Cecilia.

SPEAKER 0
Right, voluntarily assume the care, right, and then kind of like taking them in your possession and made them kind of dependent on you. Gautier, in this case, what would it be, do you think? Um, duty to care for the others, duty to care. So it's kind of like the, he's a, it's Wlansky is the patron in some sense, yeah, and he has a duty to care for his, um, uh, guests, right? So I, you know, actually it's interesting. They don't even talk about it. They just, they do talk about, they do say it's an omission, but I wonder probably if we did some research. If there are any of you who are legal historian inclined, um, maybe it's something, a duty about kind of like an innkeeper that probably goes back far, probably goes back far that like innkeepers had a sense of some kind of duty towards their whatever. OK, so we have an omission and now what's the legal question you as a judge have to decide here? Whether this omission amounts to wanton or reckless conduct, uh, why? Um, well, in this scenario is that there weren't sufficient, um, emergency exits in the event of a fire, and in fact they seem to have been deliberately blocked to an extent. Uh, yeah, OK, well, so tell me, uh, actually maybe we need to hear from the prosecutor here. Uh, William, Jeffrey, what, what, what is the, uh, what is the evidence here of recklessness? Um, that the exit was blocked. How many exits? Nourish. Do you know? Um, I believe it was 4 or 5. I think the other, I think there were 5 exits, multiple of them were blocked with like, uh, coat hangers in front of them, coat things and like that, also locked themselves. Why, why were they locked? Um, I think it was because to prevent like someone from coming in, like, yeah, exactly right, you don't want, you don't want, because you look, there's a, you, you gotta pay to get in, OK, if you got these doors that all you just do is push the door and you get out, then you just push the door and let in all your friends, right? OK, so they locked the doors so that people couldn't just kind of like come in and, uh. Take advantage of the, of the, of the club, a really very popular club. OK. Um, all right. So, and so how does that demonstrate recklessness? Um Like they had an obvious like because they did it for a particular reason, they did it purposely like, OK, but the judge wants to know how does it demonstrate recklessness against Mr. Wilansky. Where was Mr. Willansky, defense counsel, Sun Hui? In the hospital, in the hospital, yeah, in the hospital. Sophia, so he was in the hospital. So, so, so what, what's, what's your defense? He did not know the conditions that day and didn't have control over them within the club. OK, didn't know the conditions that day. How do you respond to that, prosecutors? I think we would respond just by saying that it's still under his purview, the management of his venue. He's a proprietor of this space that he's offering to the public. It doesn't matter if he's separated by from, you know, via some physical distance, it's still within the scope of his responsibility. Exactly. There was nothing about that night that was different than any other night, right? I mean you just gotta ask yourself the, the question, right? What makes this night different than any other night? Nothing. Right, he knew exactly what was going on, right? It's not like all of a sudden they like he's not there and they locked the things. He knew it was this is, you know, he'd been, so he's in the hospital, I'm sorry. But that's not much of a defense here because the conditions. Now how does the fire, how does the fire, how does the fire start? Prosecutors, do you remember? I believe it was um maybe an employee or something who lit a match which then ignited one of the uh decorations or something of that sort within the club, right, right, these palm trees, he was actually he's a young bar barback or something who's. Trying to change a light bulb. Right, if I understand correctly, trying to change the light bulb, there isn't much light because the bulb isn't working. Strikes a match to see what he's doing and the whole place goes on fire. OK? Now, what do you say about that defense counsel? Um, Viday? Um, so we basically say that, um, yes, that he is the manager, but again it's the day to day operations also this is kind of like a superseding cause in itself that this employee has taken upon himself to light a fire in a dark room and then not make sure that the fire has been put out and how can you factor that interesting superseding you said what it's a superseding act like it's interesting, interesting. Elizabeth, did you catch that? Yeah, yeah, you're my causation. You guys are causation here, right? Right. So, so, yeah, so interesting. OK, so now the notice that all of a sudden kind of like, hm, the recklessness question is kind of migrating from the back row. To the front row Right? Interesting. Now why is that? Because, uh, one of the defense said this earlier, one of the defense the defense counsels I guess, um, the defendant's wrongful acts must be the factual cause. That's the first element of causation. And so it is very relevant that the person who's charged in this, Vansky, was not present on the premises, um, at the time of the fire, but. You could parse that out in the way, OK, so that's very interesting. So you've introduced another concept to us which is um. Factual causation, you said, right? OK, so now if we jump for a second to the front row on causation, OK, so what are the two pieces of causation we need? Yes, you need factual cause, factual cause, uh, proximate cause, and proximate cause. OK, Elizabeth, you'll be factual cause, you and you'll be proximate cause, OK. What, OK, so what would be the argument here in this case about factual causation? Yes, um, so factual cause. What would we need to show for factual cause? So factual cause is that it it's called like the but for or uh sine qua non I don't know a requirement, but it means that the harm would not have occurred in the absence of the defendant's act and so we would need to show in this case that uh despite Wilansky not being on the premises at the night of the fire, perhaps assuming that I was the prosecution, perhaps he did something that that led to. The fire, but for his actions, but for Wilansky's actions, this wouldn't have happened. Yes, right? But for Wlansky's actions this wouldn't have happened. And or since this is an omission case, kind of tricky. But for his failure to do his duty. His duty under a relationship duty, right? This wouldn't have happened. OK? All right, but for. All right, so let's spend a second to try and understand but for for a second. Um, and to do that, let's go to the, um, Acosta case quickly. Anua, can you, uh, quickly tell me what's going on in, in Numa, uh, no, in, uh, Acosta. Yeah, so Acosta stole the car, um, and the cops saw him and then he began like engaging them in like a almost 50 mile high speed chase. He was running stop lines, I mean stop signs, red lights, he was driving on the wrong side of the street, kind of obstructing traffic. Um, so, so he is, um, screwing up, right? And he's causing a car chase, and there's no question that this is dangerous behavior. And it's foreseeable that actually somebody's going to get hurt. Right? It's like it's foresee if somebody, you know, a, a pedestrian's gonna get run over, uh, a cop is gonna, you know, roll over, something bad's gonna happen. OK, what happens in this case? Um, so the police ultimately, uh, choose to engage helicopters to track him, and, um, the details, if you want me to recount them, I can, but essentially, uh, keep it, keep it, keep it tight. I like that. Um, so there were a few helicopters, but two of them eventually ended up crashing into each other after one terminated radio communication and according to expert testimony did some reckless behavior. OK. And so Acosta is being held accountable for the death of the helicopter, uh, uh, um. It's not an engineer, pilot, pilot, thank you. The death of the helicopter pilot and the question then is, um. Uh, First, Well, How does Acosta, how would the argument in Acosta relate to Vidal's argument just now in uh Wilansky? Um, I think it would relate because like, but for Acosta engaging the police on the ground in the high speed chase, they wouldn't have needed helicopters to come and track him and thus. OK, I take it though that that would be the prosecutor's argument. What was your argument again? It was an independent act. It was, you had used another term. supersedes. Thank you. It was an intervening or superseding act you were saying. What was the intervening or superseding act? Um, in Acosta or Valansky, you're, you're Wolensky. Um, you just represent Mr. Wolensky. You don't care about it to light a match. OK, so the kid, the barback was the intervening cause, right? OK. In Acosta, what would the argument be? OK, um, that the reckless conduct by the pilots was like an intervening act that was like separate from Acosta's driving and causing them to be caught on the scene. Yes, exactly right. So in Acosta, the argument would be, uh, look, the fact that the helicopter pilot. Breaches FAA rules, does some kind of unexpected U-turn in the sky that that violates regulation. This is an illegal, this is an illegal left turn, right? That is what kind of intervenes and breaks the chain of causality. All right, and you're saying the barback broke the chain of causality for Wolansky. You're saying in this case, in the similar issue would be in Acosta that the helicopter pilot broke the causal chain. OK. All right. OK, so we've got that. Let's, let's put that argument on hold for a second. On um. Uh, how do, so we've got, we've got, we've got but for causation, I take it, uh, but for causation. Um, do, does the defense, Well, Does the defense have anything on but for causation in Willansky? Do you think? Sorry, uh. Defense, uh, Adeline. On causation, do you have any other arguments? Are you gonna go anywhere else? Do you have but for causation or do you have proximate causation? I think just looking at the facts on a whole, the the nightclub was in operation for like 9 years. And if they were saying that this was just a typical night, the fact is that in the whole of 9 years, assuming that all the facts remain the same, 4 out of 5 of the exits were not blocked, so it's totally fine. And there was no incident, absolutely. So why would they have proximate cause because The bar was operating for 9 years in the same conditions, even if our client was in the hospital you said proximate cause. You said proximate cause, yeah. So how does proximate cause work? What is, what is, what is proximate cause? How does it differ from uh Uh, how does it differ from but for causation? You close your relationship on top of the but for cause rationale. Say you do what? Say that again. You you closer relationships between the result and the cause. You need a closer relationship between the, the thing and the results, a closer relationship. What do you mean by closer? Less attenuated. That's a good synonym. Um, but it doesn't help me that much. Like, so what are you getting at here? What is proximate causation by contrast to but for causation? Um. So, you could contemplate it. That's proximate. All right, so it sounds to me like you're fishing around. Um, it sounds to me like you are. It sounds to me like you're making it up, kind of. That's foreseeable. Yeah, sometimes it's 4C. It sounds to me like you're making it up and you're entirely right. We make it up, we make it up, right? This is, this is another place where the law is, you know. It's mush And where you get to make the arguments, right? Proximate causation, legal causation. You know what, you know what proximate causation really means, you. Sorry, you know what proximate cause really means? No, means you're screwed. That's it. That's what it means. It's like the conclusion. Right? It's the conclusion, it's basically saying we find causation here. That's what it is. It's, it's, uh, you know, we call it, we call it proximate, we call it legal. It means. We, with the black robe, have decided that there is causation. But for causation is somewhat more factual, right? It's a little bit more about like, if you remove this. If you remove this. Peace here, would it have happened? But for causation, all right, in Acosta, give me 10 but-for causations. Audrey. And I mean, but for the taking the car, but for him taking the car, stealing the car, this would not have happened. Um, but for him driving like 40 miles, but for him driving like 40 miles, this wouldn't happen. Get a little bit more creative. Um, but for him running stop signs. True, yes, that's kind of similar, OK, but for what about but for his mother having met his father, Yeah, um, right, but for now but for his mother having met his father. This crime would not have happened. That's true, isn't it? I mean, take all of the but for terms here. Harm would not occurred in the absence of the parents getting married and deciding to have this child, but for the all in it's there are indispensable there are a lot of factual indispensable links in this. But for him being in, I don't even remember where this happened, it's in California somewhere, right. They see what, where, what? Newport, OK, but for him being in Newport, this wouldn't have happened, right? I mean, the, the, you know, but for the, but for the, the. Gas attendant who, you know, fixed his flat tire. This wouldn't have happened, right? There are tons of but-fors, OK? Factually. And so what the law does is it to say, well, that, you need that. Because if you don't have a but, because if you're not but for, then you know, nothing triggers. But that's not enough alone, OK? All right. So what you need is legal causation, which is the second prong of causation, OK? And for legal causation. That's where it gets mushy. Why is it mushy? Look, there's a great, uh, there's a great, look at, uh, is it in Uh Acosta. Yeah, there's this great line. I love it. This is on page 605 of your 11th, 572 of the 9th. I don't know what the 10, you'll tell me if does anybody have 10 here? Anybody have the 10th edition? No, mostly, mostly what are you guys using? Mostly the 11th edition? OK, all right. Um, so I think it's on page 605 of the 11th edition. Uh, there's this beautiful paragraph. This is, this is gold. It starts with proximate cause. In quotes, in quotes, uh, do you see that paragraph? Um, yeah, Alex, you're gonna be my proximate cause person also in this in Acosta. Proximate cause is the term historically used to separate those results for which an actor will be held responsible from those not carrying such responsibility. It's the conclusion. The term is in a sense artificial, serving matters of policy surrounding tort and criminal law and based partly on expediency and partly on concerns of fairness and justice, right? It was like, remember, malice. Mali is an artificial term, it doesn't mean anything, it doesn't mean that you've got a, a, a bad heart. Right, it's a, it's a term that we fill, right, and if you're committing a felony, it satisfies it, period. Baxter, he had malice because he was breaking into cars to kill somebody. Right, he had malice to kill somebody because he was breaking into cars. It's artificial. It's, it's a, it's a legal term, it's just, it's artificial, and by the way. All of law is artificial. OK, that's the point. That little paragraph, that is the most important paragraph you're gonna read in your first year of law school. All legal terms are artificial, and it's up to you to push the court to define those terms in a way that benefits your client. Whether it's You know, Elon Musk Or The environment. Right? OK, um, now, OK, so, so, and in this case, Alex, what do you think, what, how does, how does, uh, how does the in the Acosta case, how does the proximate cause work here? What, what, what, what do they say is proximate cause? I mean they got a lot of nonsense about common sense, but common, common sense is bullshit. Forget it. Put aside common sense doesn't mean anything. Common sense doesn't mean anything because proximate. Doesn't have a common sense. And legal doesn't have a common sense. So you can put that, all that, that's nonsense, complete nonsense. Well how do they end up defining it here?

SPEAKER 2
They're, they really define it in terms of like foreseeability, I think that it's like, well, he should have known that this could have happened, that he could have caused someone's injury even if it was on the ground or in the air, who cares? He should have known that someone was gonna get hurt.

SPEAKER 0
Exactly. So it's a, it's a kind of like, it's a kind, it's a foreseeability standard. Um, did you get the exact language that they use in this one? The exact language is that it's not highly extraordinary, OK? So that's your legal, that's your legal term. It's not highly extraordinary. OK. That's how they're defining proximate causation. Not highly extraordinary. And then, of course, then it just becomes like what is your, what is your, what, what are your facts? just becomes facts, right? Not highly extraordinary. Well, at that point, at that point, what are you arguing for? Wollansky, uh, for as the prosecution, prosecutors, Jeffrey and. William We're arguing that it's highly foreseeable that not taking the necessary measures to ensure the safety of the space would lead to the harm that resulted, in particular, flammable decorations, right, flammable decorations, all you just like put all of your facts in that bucket, right? And you're just gonna, you're just gonna, it's all facts at this point, OK? This legal standard is easy now, and you'll notice under the model penal code. What is the standard under the Model Penal code? There's actually a footnote to it, right in the case, right in the case, right in the case, right there. Bingo. The model penal code, what do they say? What do they propose that, uh, uh, they say to

SPEAKER 2
focus on whether the result is too remote or accidental in its occurrence to have a just bearing on the actor's liability.

SPEAKER 0
Exactly. So it's kind of like not highly extraordinary, right, but the language is in the Model Penal code. Not too remote or accidental in its occurrence to have a just bearing on a liability. OK? All right. OK. So that's, that's the, that's the flavor of how uh uh proximate cause goes. Now, you, um Medea, you had raised the question of. Um, Intervening cause. Right? Uh, so intervening cause, so you were saying the person and, and, and kind of like how would you argue that whether it's an intervening cause. Um, because again it's an independent action. Wolansky wasn't aware this was happening. He was in the hospital. OK, he wasn't consulted about anything. OK, OK, OK. So, and if it is an intervening cause, what do you think you need to argue? Or let me ask this. Do you guys remember Jack Balkin's crystalline structure of legal thought? Moshe, what would Jack Balkin tell us we need to do? Crystalline structure It's just a crystalline structure. It just repeats itself. Right? Co-counsel. You made a movement with your fingers that was exactly right. Oh yeah, I mean the Balkan and the crystalline structure obviously has that. There's 2, yeah, there's 2, but just think of the crystalline structure itself. That's what I thought your fingers were doing, right? The crystalline structure repeats itself, right? It's like if there's a crystalline structure here, the same crystalline structure is below it, right. And here, if there's a crystalline structure, then what? You do the exact same analysis. It's an intervening cause? Well, what do you ask? When you go back to the causation people, right? It's an intervening cause. Well, it's only an intervening cause if what, Elizabeth? And you, Elizabeth, yes, if it's if it's but for and if it's proximate, right, you do the exact same analysis, basically, OK, so because it, it's not going to be an intervening cause if it's not a, a but for in this case, and was it a but for in this case, defense counsel? Yes, yeah, why? Because if not for him lighting the match and blowing it out, there will be no fire. Wlansky is in the hospital. This has been like fine for 9 years. They've had these crowds for 9 years. Nothing happens. He's got it under control. He's managing the place OK. All right, so there are some violations. There are always violations. Look, there's always violations. There are tons of violations in this room right now. OK. Tons of them on your computer, there's tons of violations. So like we live in a world with a lot of violations. He's managed this for 9 years, but for this, Young kid Who lights a fricking match on the ceiling. It never would have happened, right? And so you gotta do the but for and you gotta do the foreseeability. It was foreseeable this kid, it should have been foreseeable that this kid to this kid, right? OK, so you gotta do exactly the same analysis. Um, now, uh, just to get back to our, uh, Acosta very quickly, do you see what they do in this case? These cases are really amazing. You gotta, I, I know you just love these cases because. What you love about them so much is how like at the end, there'll be a real twist. Right, and it'll be, it'll, you'll, you'll read, you're reading the case, it's all going fine, you're following the logic, and then all of a sudden it's like, whoa, what did they just do? Right? It's like when the jury comes back in the Sernay case with this directed verdict from this man with a wig, who's this British judge who's like really giving you the directed verdict, you need to find him guilty, and it's like, not guilty. Whoa. And what happens here?

SPEAKER 2
The, uh, court actually reverses his conviction of murder because they find that there's no, that they don't, that he doesn't meet like the requisite mens rea for a murder conviction.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah, crazy, and doesn't meet the requisite mens rea because. Uh, because, oh, because there's no, they found insufficient malice,

SPEAKER 2
uh, for a murder conviction, because it, it, it, it,

SPEAKER 0
it doesn't show that he consciously disregarded the risk of the helicopter pilots. But wait a minute, I thought it was not so extraordinary, right? That makes no sense. I just want you to know it makes no sense. It's basically they're applying, they're applying the same standard but they're coming to different results, right? They're applying the standard, oh, foreseeability it has to be not uh extremely unlikely, um, unlikely or whatever it's called, highly extraordinary, and then they say, well, you know what, it kind of is. Well, is it or isn't it, right? They basically use the mens rea way to say, well, you know, there's no proof that he realized that it was so, so, but if it is so extraordinarily. Not if it is not extraordinarily unlikely, then, you know, he, he, he, we could assume, we could assume that he uh figured that out. Um, but so they're using the subjectivity of the consciousness of the disregard in the mens rea to say there isn't enough evidence that he Even though It is not extremely extraordinary, extraordinary that he, there's no evidence that he was consciously disregarding that, OK? And in a way, so, OK, so that's that. Um, in a way the Wlansky case is also a mind twister. Um, did you, did you, did you, uh, did you see that Gautier? Did you, did, like, did you notice? Were, weren't you, when you read that opinion, weren't you like, holy Moses, what the hell? What the heck is going on here? Right? Yeah, I mean, they seem to suggest. That, um, let's see. That he was aware of the risk that they take these two approaches. To talk about, um, to be, he needs to be, he needs to be aware, right? He needs to, they say. There's no negligence. In Massachusetts. There is no such thing as criminal negligence in Massachusetts. Who's from, who's from the great state of Massachusetts here? All right, good. All right. You should know, I mean, actually, I don't know the law probably changed, but they're saying in the great state of Massachusetts, there is no such thing as criminal negligence, OK? So, like your Model Penal code, you know, the Model Penal Code has criminal negligence in it. That doesn't exist in Massachusetts, OK? And And these judges actually think that They're making the law, OK, but that's fine. So, so there is no criminal negligence, so what does that mean? It's a, it's not an objective standard. I mean, so what does that mean there's no criminal negligence. Uh, does it mean that no objective standard? What is, what do I mean by when I say that? What do you mean? So that means they have to consider the perspective of the person subjectively in that moment. Yeah, it has to be, it has to be something like recklessness. Recklessness requires what conscious awareness, right? So subjectivity, OK. And then do you notice anything about what kind of standard they put in place? Yeah, um, they seem to say that there is no common law, uh, criminal negligence in Massachusetts, but then they talk about how something becomes criminal when it passes the borders of negligence and gross negligence and enters into the domain of wanton and reckless behavior. And how and what standard do they give wanton and and reckless behavior? What kind of standard do they give it? Um, like a reckless disregard for the safety of the patrons. Yeah, um. Yes, that's the reckless disregard for the safety of the patrons. Wait, is it not just kind of criminal negligence? Well, it ends up being a completely objective standard. Right? Look at the opinion, even if, so this is um. 6 paragraphs from the bottom. The paragraph that says the judges the judge charged the jury correctly, OK, so we're going with awareness. You have to actually realize, defendant actually has to realize, and then they write, but even if a particular defendant is so stupid or so heedless. That in fact he did not realize the grave danger, he could escape the imputation of wanton and reckless conduct in his dangerous behavior, if an ordinary normal man under the same circumstances would have realized the gravity of the danger. So it's an objective standard, it turns out, right? So it's an objective standard, it's an objective standard, but what it requires is a really high degree of risk. OK. Weird, fascinating. You guys must have been like, wow, I like this. This is just, this is like, it's kind of like it's really, it's like a switch, it's like a magician. It's like a magician, right? It's gotta be conscious awareness of something, but all of a sudden we, and we're usually, we're used to that as being like a subjective standard, but then it's actually an objective standard, right? So you don't act you don't know, you don't actually have to be consciously aware. You don't actually have to be consciously aware. So it's a Standard that requires conscious awareness. In which you don't actually have to be consciously aware. OK. Try to explain that one to to someone to a lay person, OK. All right, um, let's quickly get, uh, um, the Arzon case on and the Williams case, and then we're gonna go to our, to Cole Montana for this tragic situation in Comontana, um, uh. Arzon, um, Elliott, tell, tell us, remind us quickly what's going on in Arzon. Um, Arzon was the case where the defendant set fire in an abandoned building on the 5th floor, right, right, right. So it feels as if this is like maybe a squat or a homelessness or it's, yeah, it's, this is kind of like this is, yes, this is old New York. This is the New York that I grew up in. This is, this is New York, OK. Uh, abandoned buildings, 5th floor, fire, arson. Yes, OK, so on the 5th floor, and what happens? Um, firefighters came to get rid of the fire, and then while they were on the 5th floor, a 2nd fire started on the 2nd floor, and it's, and how did that 2nd fire start? They aren't sure. They just said there's virtually no evidence implicating the defendant, so he didn't set, set that fire or is not responsible for the 2nd fire, OK. So it's another arson that happens on the 2nd floor at the same time as there's an arson on the 5th floor. Not the defendant is not responsible for it. OK. And what, what happens then, um, as the firefighters are trying to exit the building, they get caught up in the smoke, and it makes it hard to exit the fire because of the 2nd floor fire, um, and then one of the firefighters inhaling the smoke is injured and then later dies, right? OK, exactly. OK. And so what's the question in this case? Um, the issue is. If the defendant can be charged for murder of that firefighter, even though he seems to have been killed by the independent fire on the 2nd floor, right, and it becomes a question of causation, right? OK, and so direct proximate, how does it work? In this case, what did the court say for direct, um, the but for causation, the factual, uh, the factual causation is met because without a but for the defendant's fire on the 5th floor, the firefighters wouldn't have been in the building in the first place, OK. Right So somehow he's responsible for the cumulative danger that was caused by the fire on the 5th floor, right? I mean the firemen might have been there because of the 2nd floor arson, but we just don't, but in a way we don't know whether the 2nd floor arson all alone would have led to such dangerous conditions, but certainly the 5th floor and the whatever lead to that, um. Uh, sorry, um, Addison, yes. So for the proximate cause, um, the court says that they're going to still, that there's enough of a connection between the sort of starting the fire on the 5th floor and, and the cause of death because it triggered a chain of events such as the firefighters were there and then because they were there, they had to go upstairs and, and that allowed them to be sort of in proximity of, of the fire on the 2nd floor. And do you get a sense of what the standard that they're using here as well? Yeah, it sounds like they're using sort of a like. A chain of events standard. OK, yeah, it is a chain of events standard. Yes, and so I was looking at the line, um, uh, at the bottom of 576 on the, uh, 11th edition, which is under the theory advanced by people. Um, which is the, um, which was the case about the people versus Kibbe case. Yes, it would have been irrelevant that death, uh, had been the consequence of one particular chain of causation rather than another. It would have been enough that the defendants exposed the victim to the risk of death, and that's where he died. OK. And that passage on page, what did you say again? Uh, 570 bottom of 576 onto 57576. OK. All right, yes, um. Uh, uh, it should have been, so it should have been foreseeable as being reasonably related to his act, right, series of change, OK. And, um, by the way, Rea, since you're defense counsel or an Adeline, do you, do you have another defense for this one? Quickly. Well, why did I turn to you guys? You've officially become the Intervening causes, right? What would the intervening causes be? Here for like the fire case. It's because another fire was set out by another person. So like, yeah, so it was an intervening. Yeah, exactly, and it would be a substantial and like operating cause of the guy's death instead. Right, exactly right. OK. All right, very quickly, the last case, uh, we're gonna do before we turn to Coultana is um. The Williams case, a very sad, tragic case. All, all of these cases are tragic, uh, State versus Williams, um. And uh. State versus Williams is the case where uh the court In Washington state. Is deciding what is the stand, whether, whether you can use a civil negligence standard, OK. This was the two parents who had a small child who had a tooth infection, and the tooth infection led to gangrene. And the child dies. It's a really tragic story. The parents are, don't have very high education, uh, and the question is whether they are responsible for the death of their child. And we could, we could go back and forth a lot about this. Um, there's evidence in the case that, you know, they're very worried that the, um, social services are going to take the child away because of the child's condition and in fact one of their cousins lost their child to social services and this is something that has been historically an extraordinary problem within uh Native American communities of children being taken away. And so and so basically they were trying to deal with it at home and not going to the doctor's office in part because they were worried uh that their child would be taken away. Now the real question in this case is first what is the legal standard, right? What legal standard applies, um, and. And then there's a question of causation and so you see in this case too how the question of the legal standard feeds into kind of like how we go from the back row to the front row um because uh in this particular case the court holds that there is a simple negligence standard. For statutory manslaughter in Washington, OK, a rare kind of pretty harsh rule that basically says simple negligence, simple civil negligence will get you a manslaughter charge in Washington, OK. Um, that's the court's ruling, um, so basically what they're doing is if we go back to our chart they're changing the line. Yeah, they're changing the line here. In a way, they're creating criminal liability here. They're saying the civil negligence liability is sufficient to give you what they call statutory manslaughter. So the parents end up being convicted of manslaughter. Because what the court has done is it has in a way moved the criminal line up to here, OK? It's the, the court has smooshed these three categories. OK, that's what the court has basically done in Washington. It smushed it. It's all now just statutory manslaughter, OK? If it's reckless, if it's extreme negligent, or if it's negligent, civil negligent, it is statutory manslaughter. But you'll notice that the question then becomes, so once you've got that, uh, the back row, we can kind of migrate to the front row and it's like, well, wait a minute, were they really the cause of the child's death? And there it's actually not so clear, right, because if you look, if you do a real kind of close timeline of the case, um, a child gets sick on September 1 and dies on September 12, well, you know, there's this one of the doctors testifies that by September 5th, the child was so ill that nothing could have been done to save the child's life, right? And so then all of a sudden we're back down to causation. Whether or not, now, OK, maybe, but for their Omissions, this is an omission case, right, but for their omissions, you would have had, uh, the baby would have been OK, sure, maybe there's but for causation, but on legal causation, you know, look, if there's nothing they could have done, how is that part of the foreseeability, how is that part of the chain of causation or something like that. And so you, I think in the Williams case, you could argue either the mens rea. Right? Or you could come forward and then say, wait a minute, there's just simply no causation here. OK? All right. Now, with that, OK, um, I think that you have understood all of the law of homicide. Congratulations. You've seen that really, it's a lot of just kind of like back and forth with these standards, right? mens rea standards. You're really kind of going back and forth between, is it, you know, is it intentional, is it reckless, is it negligent, and that the gradation is all about the mens rea, really, right? You're moving back and forth between different categories of mental states and situating it on the homicide, um, on your homicide, uh, code, all right, so let's now go and let's think about this case that just happened and I'm going to, um, one of the stances that's always one of the things that's difficult in these, um, all of these cases is that, you know, we often. Um, We often talk about them and they can get light and. It's important not to get too depressed, so we make jokes about them too and stuff, but I thought it would be helpful for us to have a little bit of reality check. So I don't know, so we're just going to take 2 minutes to understand what happened and then we'll go to the case. OK. Swiss investigators are trying to determine the precise circumstances that led to the deadly fire at the Constellation bar on New Year's Eve. It all started about an hour and a half after midnight. Pictures published by French TV station BFM appear to show the moment it began. They seem to confirm what several witnesses described at the scene. A male waiter lifted a female waitress on his shoulders. She was holding lit candles placed on champagne bottles. On the second picture, the ceiling appears to have caught fire. Lighting candles close to the ceiling was apparently common practice in the bar, according to this witness. When customers bought large bottles, we used to put on a little show, a little show where we carried the waiters on our shoulders with sparklers. It's true that they often came very close to the ceiling, and I had already asked myself the question. I thought, if something happens, there's nothing we can do. The fire spread quickly on the underground floor, with dozens of revelers frantically trying to escape through a narrow flight of stairs. Dozens were trapped inside. The concentration of gasses led to an explosion known as a backdraft. Meanwhile, experts are struggling to identify the victims. It's extremely worrying. 47 victims have yet to be identified. This process is complicated and will take days. We also have 112 wounded, 107 of them identified. With Crans Montana being an international tourist destination, the victims are likely to be of multiple nationalities. OK. So, um, so, and since then, um, The 2, the 2 owners of the. Bar Constant thoughts go to the victims and those who are fighting. Sorry, hold on, um, to the, the bar owners of the constellation were a man and woman by the name of Jacques, and both of them Moretti. Um, and, uh, this is the woman owner speaking here. My constant thoughts go to the victims and those who are fighting today. This was an unthinkable tragedy, and never could we have imagined this. It happened in our bar, and I want to say I'm sorry. OK. That's the sound of an American oil company hard at work, uh, so. OK, so that's where we are, uh, and, uh, 41 people have been, um, are dead as a result of this, OK? All right, so how do we think about responsibility in this case, and um I think I'm starting, is it, is it Maxwell down the road you guys were the state, the state of, uh, I think you said it was Ramia. OK, OK, OK, uh, Ramia, OK, OK, OK, uh, good catch, uh, Ramia, uh, Camille, Doris, Sylvie, and Salome, then, um, so, uh, how do you view this from the kind of state's perspective, um, you're representing actually here it would be the carton of, I don't know, vote. Uh, Switzerland is a confederacy, so it's, um, it's the, it's the cantons that are in charge. Go ahead. Yeah, so we don't know exactly what, um, the Swiss statute, uh, states, but we know that it imposes a duty of care upon bar owners to, I think we're gonna, since we don't know, we're just gonna go with the model penal code, yeah, um, so. Um We were, when we were deciding, we know that the Swiss system tends to be more, uh, rehabilitative. So when realistically, judging our options between Um, manslaughter and neglig and murder, we thought manslaughter would be a more realistic route, um, but we, and so tell me some of the facts, all of you, tell me some of the facts. Uh, let's go 11 by one, but you can start, you can start, you can continue, you can start. Give me some of the facts that you think suggest that there should be criminal liability here, right? Because I mean, I take it to. The defense counsel thinks that there there need not be crim uh criminal liability here. So what, what makes you think that we should even be using the criminal law in a situation like this? Well, they advertised to hundreds more people than what the capacity of the bar was, which was 200, and I think they like advertised advertise 400 people there. OK, so hold on. OK, so, um. So Milam, Imara, Jasmine, and Laura, I'm gonna just kind of like bounce back and forth with you guys, OK, so the first thing you said was they advertised for what they advertised what they, there were 400 people at the party, um, OK, so that's not a question of advertisement, that's a question of capacity, but they like, uh, purposefully solicited a crowd that was larger than the capacity of the, OK, OK, OK, OK, um, go ahead. What else, Camille? Um, we also know that the owners were previous operators of the bar itself, so they were familiar with the space, um, and then they helped renovate the space, including adding the foam pads that were, we could see in the videos that were on the ceiling and what eventually caused the fire. Do we know if the foam pads were anti-retardant, fire retardant, or do we know anything about the pads? We know that they bought them from a DIY company, and they claim that they didn't know that if it was, um, fire retardant or anything like that. But I mean, given common sense and maybe a reasonable man's knowledge of foam and things like that, uh, they seem pretty flammable. OK, OK. And in fact they were flammable. It's pretty clear, right, um, OK, Doris. Sorry. Um, yeah, some, some other details about the space, um, and recklessness. First, it was local law that, um, those kinds of spaces had to be inspected every year and it hadn't been inspected since 2019. 2nd, they'd made specific renovations that made it more dangerous in this situation. So they narrowed some of the hallways. They made it so that fire exits could only open, um, Inwards from the outside, but not outwards from the inside, which is how a lot of people died. Um, so you mean the fire exits didn't operate, didn't work, and they also had fire extinguishers stored in a locked room, um, so employees couldn't get to them. There was no fire training, and some employees said, um, so that's a lot of damning evidence there, Sylvia. Sylvie, sorry, Sylvie, um. I think I want to underscore Doris's point about the lack of fire safety training. We have on the record from one of the staff members who died in the blaze that she had received no safety training and was unaware of the danger posed by the ceiling itself the night of the fire. Um, I think that there are multiple like industry standards that we can like point to. OK, OK. Salome, anything to add? Um, I would just add that like the use of sparklers in an enclosed space like that and how many sparklers they were, there were, and the fact that they were, um, having a waitress on, on the shoulders of another waiter, um, as a frequent practice seems pretty, um, negligent and, um, irresponsible, negligent and irresponsible. OK, all right. Negligent and irrespons should reckless and irresponsible. OK, um, yeah, OK, no, I mean, so we're gonna have to, so, so clearly, uh, your argument is that we're, we're somewhere past civil liability and we're into the criminal law domain and we should be caring about it. As criminalists, OK. All right, so how do you start, what, what kind of, uh, how, what kind of defense would you start thinking about Neelam? Sure, so, oh, OK, um, I think maybe the best way to try to push back on this would be to try to argue for negligence, and you could try to attempt to argue civil liability under negligence, though that might be a harder case to make, or maximum criminal negligence, but not so much reckless recklessness that would lead to manslaughter. OK, OK, now, um. So, how, so what do you think about the strategy of conceding negligence here? What makes you feel that you have to concede negligence? Seems like there's relatively strong but for causation that's hard to push back against, whereas I think there's a stronger case to be just stronger defense that could be made that there's not proximate causation, but the. And what would that sound like here? So, and, and again notice we've kind of like moved from the back of the room to the front here and we've sli slid quickly from the negligence question into the causation question. um, what. What do you, what, uh, Amara, what do you think about causation, and then I'll come back to the negligence question.

SPEAKER 3
Yeah, I think I agree with Neilam that, um, the but for causation thing is a little bit hard to argue against, but you could argue, and what, what exactly

SPEAKER 0
are the kind of like the factual but for.

SPEAKER 3
I think, um, the fact that the bar hadn't been inspected since 2019, like that's, you know, a little bit damning for us fault is that the owner's the owner's fault of that is it is it, is it?

SPEAKER 0
I'm not sure. I'm not sure co-counsel. Um, yeah, I would say maybe it's the responsibility of the state to make sure that the bars within their like sovereignty or like what like exactly what it is or like yeah, jurisdiction are following the protocols, and I would also say that in regards to causation it's important to note that the waitress wasn't told to and it's not within the protocol of the bar that she has to be on the shoulders of this man with a helmet on, which could also blur like her vision. Um, and using like that many amount of sparklers, like it's also on the record that none of that is part of the protocol of the bar. It might be something that the waiters and waitresses have decided to do as their own custom, but it wasn't anything that our owners told them to do. OK, OK, all right. uh, Jasmine, is there anything you wanna add to that? Yeah, so basically what Laura was saying was like the way we could argue that the Waitresses Act was the intervening, um, was the intervening causation and also, um. I forgot what point, um, the use of sparklers like that's OK, so we've got a question of intervening causation. OK, go ahead. And I guess to push back on the sparklers argument was that like that's a commonplace, um, practice within bars so it's not like any negligence on side of the owners when the the waitress decided to use them. So, um, of the arguments that you've made so far, um, I'm. I'm thinking that uh something about the lack of uh inspections of the bar seems somewhat compelling. Um, I take it that it's not up to the bar owners to. Make these inspections happen. It's up to the Canton or the local authorities. And so this is like the responsibility of the mayor of Comontana or the fire inspectors of Comontana, right? They, they were the ones who should have been inspecting. Did you notice whether there had been inspections before?

SPEAKER 3
Yeah, there have been inspections before in 2019, and I also want to add that on the point of the states maybe um sort of rejecting their responsibility, it's said that fire alarms and sprinklers were not legally required for a bar of that size, so maybe that points to the state sort of um underestimating the dangers perhaps.

SPEAKER 0
Saying that again. Say that again. What was not required? I'm sorry, what was fire alarms and sprinklers were not

SPEAKER 3
legally required for a bar of that size, so the owners were technically in compliance with, um, the regulations for that municipality or that jurisdiction.

SPEAKER 0
OK, OK, OK, um, so how do you respond to the question about this inspection, the problems with the inspections. I think, um, there's a two-part response. One, which is that, um, the owner still had an affirmative duty of care under the statute. So, yeah, it might be true the state never sent inspectors, but they theoretically should have been ready for an inspection at any time and things like the fire exits, etc. um, were ones that would be deficient. Number 2, Yeah, those, the statue might not have required like sparklers, um, or, or sorry, fire sprinklers, uh, for a bar of that size, but they were purposefully attracting crowds larger than capacity. So it seems that there's still a risk of knowing disregard. Um, OK, so the larger than capacity, the fact that there was a. The fact that they had so many people, how does that map onto the way that we've been thinking about, uh, these cases, Salome? What dimension is that really? Um, I think it's part of the foreseeability. It's part of foreseeability, yeah. Anything else? Sophie, what else is it part of? Um, It's part of foreseeability. There's a question of foreseeability. Sorry, Sylvie. That's OK, um. I think the fact that we, we see them kind of disregard the capacity of the bar and attract also minors and self-install things like the foam ceiling shows that, you know, looking at this from a common sense lens, maybe more of a like proximate causation lens, you would, a reasonable person would think they're not being responsible. Um, so foreseeability, proximate causation lens, also, I think it's like the degree of risk, right? Degree of risk is important here. If you have really, I mean if, if, if the capacity was 75 and they were at 100, it would be different than if the capacity was 75 and they were at 400 or the Coconut Grove was at past 1000 for a capacity that was, I don't remember what the capacity was, but. Those questions tie into the question of risk, right? So, in a way, we kind of come back to these typical arguments that are reflected, for instance, when we quickly spoke about the Hall case, but when we speak about Wolansky, right? These are the typical kind of arguments that have to do with how much risk was there, right? Or remember in the Malone case, right? In the Malone case, we could say 60, there was 60% risk. How much risk was there here? I don't know. Can we quantify it? The big risk that there would be deaths if there was a fire in there, right? There's a big risk and, and the whole sparkler thing and now we know, you know, I mean this is, this is a common problem with with clubs is the insulation and the sound sound insulation that is flammable, right? and it. It looks as if this was pretty flat, this looks like it was just flammable stuff. Um, so, so the risk here, I take it, you know, and obviously you all would be fighting about what the risk is, how many people, and you were saying it's a small, it's a small venue, it didn't even require sprinklers. And fire alarms, right? That means it's a pretty small venue or um uh maybe the regulations weren't appropriate, you know, I think in a way, uh, the defense is going to be trying to push some of the responsibility onto the the regulators here, right? And certainly there's a lot of room for that because the place hadn't been regulated, hadn't been inspected for 5 years, OK. Uh, Uh, the, another dimension would be how much care was taken, right? So for instance, Were the waiters instructed not to do this with the sparklers? It sounds as if it had become a common practice to do it with a big bottle. Were the owners aware of it, right? So, standard of care and, and then kind of like their awareness. How much were the owners aware of what was going on? If you, if we take a model penal approach in negligence. Uh, an objective standard of negligence, um, that under the Model Penal Code, while they might be held criminally negligent, if it's a gross deviation, right? So if we start, so, you know, if, if the, um, If the defense goes towards conceding negligence, then the test is going to be, if you look at your model penal code again, um, under murder, right, for instance, under murder, um, It's gonna be, let's see, well, criminal negligence would be section 210.4, Criminal negligence then would have the negligence standard, and it's whether there was a gross deviation from the standard of care. Right now, if you're in Washington state at the time of Williams, maybe the standard would have been simple civil negligence, OK, but that's something you would, you would want to know exactly what is your standard for criminal negligence. Here it would be a gross deviation from the standard of care. Was there a gross deviation from their standard of care? That would be the question, or if it goes up to recklessness and manslaughter. Um, that would be a conscious disregard of a substantial risk, right?
