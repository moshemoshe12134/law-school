SPEAKER 0
Yeah. I do. So. Yeah You fight Yeah, it's randomly warm outside. I. Expecting it to be like 2 degrees still and then I was like, of course, running up the hill as always and I was like, oh my God like I. I was thinking I was. Are you wearing? Are you wearing? I'm trying. a I It. And I was like and That they were And I don't. But I. I Oh, see. You go to this The I was like, who's touching it? They're sending someone, but you figured it out. OK, great.

SPEAKER 1
All right, everyone, welcome back. Sorry, we had a little technical difficulty because the PC is under maintenance, but I think we got it all going. All right, it worked. I got it.

SPEAKER 0
I got it. It worked. Thanks. Thanks so much.

SPEAKER 1
It's warm today. Nice, isn't it?

SPEAKER 0
No, too hot. All right.

SPEAKER 1
Is this working all right?

SPEAKER 0
So, uh, we're gonna dig in today into What's called

SPEAKER 1
the elements of criminal law. By the way, you should, you should, I, I, I was reading the syllabus, it's actually pretty good, you know, there's like a, there's a, there's a good description of this at the beginning, so make sure you read that, because it, it's intended to frame the whole course and stuff and. Yeah, it's, it's pretty good. Um, OK, all right. So Common law. You guys did all that first week in your legal methods, right? Common law. Criminal law in the United States, for the most part today is Actually, civil law. Codified, OK. Um, the codes that we have in states. Across the country. Our criminal codes, penal codes that aren't really that different from the Napoleonic criminal code from 1810, I think it was. Which was of course You know, a seminal example of civil law, right? Um, the civil code in France actually from, I think it was 1804. Is You know, the exemplar of civil law, right, codified civil law. In fact, when you think about it. The civil code in France, which is the Napoleonic code which was created at the beginning of the 19th century, still operates in France today, and there have been something like 19 constitutions. 5 republics. But one civil code. Which is kind of remarkable. So for instance, you know, inheritance law in France, which was in the civil code from 1804, was a pretty remarkable uh invention. Inheritance law inheritance law in France is pretty simple. Uh, you have it's. However many children you have, it's those are the parts you add one part to it. So if you have 2 children. Um, you have 3 parts to your whole estate, and 1/3 goes to 1 child, 1/3 goes to the other child, and the last 13 you can do what you want with. You can't disinherit your children. The money goes to the children. Women, girls, daughters, and sons were treated exactly the same in 1804. It was a kind of a radical system, but that has continued to live on. And so civil Codes and civil law have a tendency to continue despite all kinds of political regime change. There's more kind of constancy with these codes than there is in the political realm itself. Now, as you know, from very well, the United States. Is considered a common law country or came from a common law tradition from the UK, right, from Great Britain, which itself was a common law. And so, um, most of the fields that you're studying in your first year are common law fields, they're judge, judge decided law, torts. You know, it's just the judges decide what the law is, they invent a tort. Right? And early, and in early in in England, that was the way it was done. It was common law, criminal law, OK? And so in order to know what the law was, in order to know how murder was defined, say, You had to look at the cases from the judges to see what the definition of murder was. In the same way that, in your torts, you need to read the cases to figure out what are the, Elements of a tort. Right, there's got to be a duty. What else? There's gotta be a breach. I don't know. You guys know torts. I don't. You don't know torts. Well, OK, but you had a class. Causation, there's a duty, right? And but now, but where do you get this from? Well, you get it from the case law, right? It's like, oh, you're reading some ridiculous case from, you know, California where they created a, uh, intentional, uh, infliction of emotional distress for something. They just kind of created it out of thin air, and now it exists, OK. And, and you're probably in your torch class, you guys are gonna probably be looking at what's called the. Restatement of torts. Did you get, did you touch the restatement? Yeah, right. And the restatement of Torts is what? The restatement of Torts is a bunch of people with suits and ties who are professors and whatnot, who are basically saying, oh, this is the law of torts. This is, this is what the law of torts should be like, OK. Now we don't really have that in criminal law, OK? We don't have A bunch of professors saying this is what. Criminal law should be like kind of common law. This would be a good one, OK. We instead have a bunch of professors. It started here at this at this joint. Um, uh. Who are part of the ALI, the American Law Institute, who do those restatement of torts. The Crim law professors, instead, they decided, well, we're just, we can't make a restatement because that doesn't make sense. Instead, we're going to make a model penal code. OK, so we're going to say this is, this is the way the model penal code should be. Should be. So they proposed a model penal code, OK, and. They proposed a model penal code in the 1960s. Many states were like, oh. That, that sounds great. Let's take it and modify a little bit, about 20, about half of the state said, all right, let's change our let's change our code. You know, New York State had a has a penal code. We're gonna change it in relationship to this model penal code, but we're gonna adopt it as our legislation, right, becomes our code. But it's, it's based on the Model Penal Code. OK. Now, um, In this class, We're going to be studying a lot of the model penal code. Because. Uh, you've got it in the back of your book. And it's a kind of a. Foil, a good foil. In the cases we're reading, you're gonna be dealing with particular state statutes, particular state codes. But we'll be kind of trying to understand those often. By kind of comparing it to the Model Penal Code. Like what would happen under the Model Penal Code, right? Now you have to understand, of course, the Model Penal Code doesn't have an elaborate common law development of the Model Penal Code, because the Model Penal Code is fiction. Right, I mean, it's just a model, so it's not as if There's a whole Supreme Court, you know, New York Supreme Court or New York appellate court or New York Court of Appeals jurisprudence surrounding the Model Penal Code because it's, you know, there's some comments and sometimes we'll look at the comments, but what we'll be doing mostly is looking at the Model Penal Code as an example of, OK, so if the crime were defined like this, how would it work. Right, versus, oh well, OK, well, we got a New York State case. Now, the first case we're gonna start with is an Alabama state case, OK? You got a you've got a code provision in that case, right? So we're not gonna be looking at the model penal code there. We're gonna be looking at the Alabama code from actually it's from 1940, right, in that case, OK, in the Martin case. OK. All right. Now Most of the. Criminal law that we have in this country, though. Traces its origins to. British common law. All right. Um, for the most part. Uh, there are in Louisiana is slightly different because of course Louisiana was a French territory and the Napoleonic code applied in Louisiana, so the Louisiana code is actually influenced by the Napoleonic code, um, and but that's a that's pretty much of an exception. Most of the other codes that are in place in the United States were heavily influenced by what's called British common law, OK. And um. When you prepare for the bar exam. Um, so criminal law is on the bar exam. Uh, it's one of the foundational, um, subjects that you'll be tested on. When you prepare for the bar exam, you will take some bar prep course, and they will be talking about common, the common law of murder or the common law of manslaughter, OK? That you should know that that doesn't mean anything. But it doesn't exist, OK. Um There is no common law of murder today applicable in the United States. If somebody, I mean in in in most states. You, you'll, we'll, you'll see a few cases where there's a mention of common law, but in most states. There are no common law crimes. OK, I would say that that is like 98% true in this country. There are no common law crimes. And what does that mean? What that means is you can't be charged for a crime unless it's codified, unless there's a code that says you are not allowed to do this. OK? That's what we mean when we say there's no common law crimes. You can't have a crime where a court says, oh, Hm, this is a crime. No, that, that doesn't really exist in, in, in America, OK? It has to be a violation of the code that's been enacted in in the state that you're practicing in. Nevertheless, on the bar, for some reason they talk about common law crime of murder, common law crime of manslaughter, we'll talk a little bit about it, but you should know that that is just for. Bar examiners, and it has nothing to do with real life, OK? But that's true in life. I mean, there are a lot of times in life where you just have to know how to talk a certain way in order to get past the door. OK? All right. So What we're starting with are elements of crime. Elements of crime. Why are elements of crime important? Well, elements of crime are really important because, That is what the prosecution has to prove in order to obtain a conviction. So the elements of crime are actually the most important, basic thing that you need to know about. And you can think of it as a little bit like a menu or a check box, OK? In order for the prosecution to convict someone of, say, Assault. OK. There have to be a few elements satisfied. They have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that certain elements exist in this case. All right. It's the same thing for torts. For torts you've got a certain number of things that have to be proven for there to be a tort. Tort and criminal law are very similar. One is civil, one is criminal, um, they can cover the same thing, right? So in other words. Any, so. Renee Good Was tragically killed in Minneapolis. There can be a criminal case against the police, against the ICE agent Jonathan Ross in the state of Minnesota. There can be a state criminal case against Agent Ross in the state of Minnesota. There can also be a civil suit brought by her wife. Uh, Ms. Good. To allege wrongful death. OK. Those are two separate tracks. I can guarantee you there will be a civil lawsuit. I mean, if there isn't a civil lawsuit. I'll give you all 100 bucks. There will be a civil lawsuit brought by the estate. Of Renee Good against the police officer, against ICE probably for a lack of proper training and things like that. There'll be a lot of different counts that's going to be your torts class, right? And that's going to be wrongful death. It could be wrongful death, could be, there could, there could be a lot of different, there could be a lot of different. Torts that essentially constitutionalize things. Uh Now, so, And in those cases as well, they will have to prove certain elements, OK? Just as in the criminal law context, to prove that it was a, Murder or a manslaughter. It was a homicide. There's no question, as we will see next week, it was a homicide in the sense that it was a death caused by another human being. It was not a suicide. It was not an accident or whatever. It was a homicide. The only question is going to be whether it was a justified homicide or not, but we will see next week what you would have to prove. One of the things that you're going to have to prove. Is an act You're going to have to prove for any crime that there was actually an act. And the other thing you're going to have to prove. Is that there was, bless you, a particular mental state satisfied. And usually, um, usually that kind of Covers a lot of the ground for the kinds of elements that you'd need to prove in a case. Sometimes there's also something else like Uh, That the victim was under 18 or something like that, right? So that's, that's not really an act and it's not really a mental state. You're gonna see it's it's what we call an attendant circumstance, but sometimes that will be a requirement of the actual crime. OK, all right. Now all of this goes back, of course, to, well, it goes back to Roman law. It goes back to civil. Law, Roman civil law, where there was a requirement back there, it's. For those who speak or those who understand Latin, let's see, actus nonfaci reum nisi men sit rea. An act does not make a person guilty unless there's also an act and a guilty mind. But in our case, Our tradition doesn't so much go back to Roman law, although there are some elements of that influence, and there were some elements of that influence in British common law. Our, Tradition mostly goes back to British common law. And what you have in front of you here is uh. The uh Blackstone's commentary. Have you studied Blackstone's commentaries at all? In any class? No. Yes, in one, in one of the classes. In what? You've heard of him? OK. All right. So, um, so Blackstone, uh, was a judge, uh, in the 18th century in England. Uh, and what he did, very Uh, The smart thing to do was to produce what he called the commentaries on the law of England. OK. It's 4 volumes. This is the 4th volume. This is, this has wrongs in it, uh, and so it has the criminal law in it. Um, and I'll pass it around so you all can see what it looks like, uh, now. Uh, the commentaries, what he was doing was really smart, because given that there were. This was common law. There were just a lot of decisions by British judges with wigs that, you know, you had to read all the decisions to figure out what the law was. He figured, well, you know, I'm gonna, I'll tell you what the law is right here. So he writes a, this commentary, which essentially er tells you what the law is in England. OK, now of course you have to realize that gives you a lot of power, right? When people, when people start saying, oh well, let me see what the law, it's kind of like, you know, it's kind of like chat chat GTP gains a lot of power today, right, because people are asking chat GTP what the law is, right? Well, here, you know, it was just a published book and you went to the Blackstone. So you didn't have to read all those cases, you just read the treatise and. There's a way in which the treatise was an original form of codification, right? Right? I mean it's not, no, it's not a code passed by the uh legislature and signed and it's not a bill that becomes a law. But it serves as a kind of a codification because it starts to tell you what the rules are, and they're written down in this way, right? So, um, Blackstone, one of the first things he says about crimes. Is this To make a complete crime cognizable by human laws, there must be both a will and an act. OK. Because basically no tribunal can search the heart or fathom the intentions of the mind otherwise than as they are demonstrated by outward actions. It therefore can't punish for what it cannot know. All temporal jurisdictions in all temporal jurisdictions, an overt act or some open evidence of an intended crime is necessary in order to demonstrate the depravity of the will before the man is liable to punishment. Actually, the woman also. Um And uh there were different forms of punishment for men and women at the time. Um, so that to constitute a crime against human laws there must be, first, a vicious will, and secondly, an unlawful, act. Consequent thereupon. OK. A vicious will without a vicious act is no crime. So an unwarrantable act without a vicious will is no crime. So basically what Blackstone is saying here, I mean, You get the gist of what he's trying to say, which is, you can't punish someone for just having bad ideas. Well, you, you couldn't, you couldn't in England back then. Throughout most of American history, that was true too. Until now, but. You the idea is, if you, if you, if you know, someone who says like, I, I, I, I want to kill this person. Like, no, you can't punish them, unless, and that that might be an evil will, but you can't punish it unless there is some kind of act, right? So we're not gonna punish people for bad thoughts. That was the kind of, that was what was guiding the Blackstonian rule here. But what it amounted to then, and what it became understood as requiring is that a crime, to define a crime, you need two elements, an act and a will. OK. We're going to talk about the act requirement today. And then we're gonna talk about the will requirement tomorrow. Uh, actus reus, so that's just Latin for the act requirement. It's the act thing, OK? It's the real act. Um, mens rea is the mental thing. Ms is the mental and rea is the thing, OK? So basically we use these Latin terms, but it's just act requirement and um, uh, mental state. OK. All right. So, um, now with that background. Then, uh, let's dig into our first case, which is the Martin versus State case. So you can open up your casebooks to 205 or 221 or 248, depending on which version you have. Um, And uh. Uh, let's see. Let's start. Is it Eli or yes, or Eli? Eli, hi. Um, And y'all should know I like going down rows, so, OK. All right, you lie, um. What is the uh. Now, OK, well, actually, uh, let me just add one more thing to this, sorry, before I get to you, and we get to the, what the code provision is in Alabama. Um, one other thing about the Blackstone common law here is that in addition to it being an act requirement. There also, it also needs to be the case that it's a voluntary act, OK? And so you have that here in Blackstone, an involuntary act as it has no claim to merit, so neither can it induce any guilt. All right. So there's a requirement that it be um uh that there be an act and a requirement, of course, that the act be a voluntary act under common law, under the tradition from which our laws are made, mostly, mostly. All right, Eli, what's the, what is the, uh, what is the statute provision that is at issue in Martin versus State? Um, well, the provision is that someone can't be, um, intoxicated in a, a public highway. OK, let's, let's, um, let's be more specific about that. Um If Martin. If all that Martin Did was to. Be drunk In public Do you think that there would be a charge here? I know, there's, I mean, there has to be some sort of conduct that kind of results from being intoxicated. So just the mere state of intoxication is not enough that conduct like boisterous or indecent conduct, being boisterous, being boisterous, uh, what are the exact words? Uh, manifest the drunken condition by boisterous or indecent conduct or loud or profane discourse. OK. All right, so, uh, it's not just that the person has to be drunk in public. There are, there are public drunk statutes. Uh, Public intoxication statutes. In this case, it's a public intoxication statute, plus you have to actually act in a boisterous or profane or indecent way, a loud or profane or so basically you have to yell or shout or scream or say bad things or whatnot, OK. And being drunk is not enough, really. It's not, this isn't just an, this isn't just a simple uh public intoxication prohibition. It's that you really have to do something here. OK. All right. And so what would you say are the acts. In this codification, and so by the way, everyone should be clear about this. This is the Alabama code of 1940, so it was passed by the Alabama legislature as a criminal code and signed by the governor of Alabama. It's the law at the time, um, in the 1950s. Uh, it was in Title 14. Uh, Title 14 must have been the penal law part of the Alabama code. I would venture, uh, 99.9%. Good guess. Title 14 included all of the criminal definitions of what are crimes, and under section. 120 of that was this prohibition. What would you say, give me kind of like, what are the acts. that have to happen here. So I would look, um, after reading the case, I would look at kind of the two verbs that appear in the code, and one of them is appears and the other one is manifests. And so it seems like the crime entails both appearing and manifesting by any of those kind of adjectives that it says after manifests. OK, good. And the idea of going for the verbs is probably very, uh. is very smart and it's a good one good way to approach it is to figure out what are the action terms, right? What are the action terms. We're going to see that there's another kind of act that isn't a verb action term, but in a lot of statutes, the verb action term is going to be important as being what the act is. Um, possibly we're gonna see, it might be what we might call conduct. OK. All right, so, um, so the terms you said are appearing in a public place and manifesting boisterousness or indecency, OK? And those would be the actions you're saying. All right So now, um, on a simple reading of. Say Blackstone has to be an act and a. Vicious will. Let's put aside the vicious will for a second. Um, Are we satisfied that there is an act requirement here in the statute? That the statute requires an act. Yes, yeah, yeah, OK. The statute requires an act. OK, so it satisfies that. Um, are we satisfied? Is it Dang J? That the um. That the conviction of Mr. Martin satisfies the act requirement.

SPEAKER 2
I don't think so because there was an issue of the voluntariness.

SPEAKER 1
OK, the voluntariness of what of, um, so we discussed

SPEAKER 2
that there's, um, there's two verbs and the first one appears, i.e., appearing in a, in a public, um, like place, um. According to the facts available, the defendant appeared on the public highway because he was brought there by the police in an involuntary manner. How was he brought there? My understanding is that he was first arrested at home and then he, I guess like on their way somewhere they found themselves in an altercation where he like he became boisterous on the road, basically.

SPEAKER 1
Um, I'm not sure if there was an altercation. I'll have to look again at the exact wording of what the, um, Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals said, but you're entirely right that he was arrested in his home. And under arrest. Involuntarily. I mean, he was at home. He was staying at home. He was just in his home. He was placed under arrest and then taken. Coercively or involuntarily or by the police, possibly something like to the patrol car, and at that point, he was appearing in a public place. While he was intoxicated. And so what you're arguing is that the appearance, which is one of the act requirements here in the statute. Is not voluntary. OK. All right. And that's what the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeal holds, right? OK. So the holding in the case is pretty simple. It's pretty easy, right? This requires Some actions. Uh, one of which is purely involuntary. We say Uh, because he was arrested. And Taken outside against his voluntary will, all right, and therefore we don't have satisfied the voluntary act requirement. OK. Very simple case. Seem, does it seems right to you, Hannah? Um, I would say no because he never, we don't know that he ever intended to be in public. He was at home and then he was brought into a public space. So you mean yes in the sense that you're agreeing, you're agreeing with the Court of Criminal Appeals, yeah, yes, is that right? Um, yes, the, the that's the court that reversed it. Yes, yes, yes, yes, uh, so, um. You're so you're saying it's, so is it an easy case, you are saying yes, it is an easy case because he didn't voluntarily appear in public. Right, so you're, you're agreeing with the Court of Criminal Appeals, yes, OK. Um, how many of you? I feel that the Court of Criminal Appeals kind of got the right intuition here. OK. All right. Now, um, and of course that is what the Court of Criminal Appeal rules, right? Uh, on our little chart here, just so we start to get a sense of the. sense of the of what goes on in these criminal law cases. Mr. Martin would have started here with his trial where he was convicted, correct? He's convicted of this offense, he's convicted of this section of the Alabama code and at a trial. At the in, in, uh, in whatever county he is in Alabama. And he has the right to an appeal. There's a constitutional right to counsel on your first appeal. He had an attorney, and he goes to his first appeal, which is in box here, the first appeal of right. OK. And this usually goes to something like a state intermediate appellate court. In the case of Alabama, it's the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals, OK? If you were in New York State, if you were in New York State, have you guys, have you guys been in New York State, Hannah, do you know what this would be called right here? The, uh, Supreme Court, yeah, that would be the Supreme Court in New York State. OK, you'd be convicted in Supreme Court and then you would go to the, um. Uh, court of, then you would go to the, uh, Criminal Appellate division. OK. In Alabama, it's the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals. Here it's the Uh, appellate division. OK. And from that decision, OK, you could go to the, in, in Alabama, you could go to the Alabama Supreme Court. OK, and it would be a discretionary review, so you're not entitled to that, but you could ask them to take the case. OK? In New York it would be the New York Court of Appeals. OK, so in New York you'd be going from the Supreme Court to the Appellate Division to the Court of Appeals. In Alabama, you go from the uh circuit court, it's called a circuit court, uh, to the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals to the Alabama Supreme Court. OK? All right. So now Let's Put ourselves in the place of the Alabama Supreme Court. Rather than the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals for a minute. OK. And let's imagine that the case is coming back to us. Uh, Rabia. Your defense counsel or your counsel for Mr. Martin, you're at the Alabama Supreme Court. They have graciously granted your petition for certiorari. So you've gone there on a, you, you, you would petition them for a writ of certiorari to review the decision by the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals, and they've granted you the appeal, and now you represent Mr. Martin and you. are in front of the Alabama Supreme Court. What is your argument?

SPEAKER 3
It was not, he was not voluntarily in the highway, so it was not a voluntary act.

SPEAKER 1
He was not voluntarily in the highway. OK, uh, so, um, um. So what is the, what is the, uh, what is the, what is missing here?

SPEAKER 3
I think they can argue that he voluntarily made prosecution.

SPEAKER 1
Oh, OK. The, the prosecution can argue what maybe he voluntarily drank

SPEAKER 3
earlier. Maybe his activities were voluntary.

SPEAKER 1
Your defense counsel. So what's your argument?

SPEAKER 3
I would say like it doesn't really matter because he was not there voluntarily, so his activities are not under his voluntary bod. He was not in the mental stage. To decide.

SPEAKER 1
OK, so, um. So basically, uh, You want to say that the appearance in public was involuntary. OK. And so, um, And that's what the um. That's what the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals held, right? OK. Um, And uh. You said something about being drunk. How, what is, what is, what, how does that play into it?

SPEAKER 3
Maybe being drunk led him to act in a bad way in the highway. So maybe like. Someone can argue that drinking alcohol was a voluntary act in his house, which led him to act in that way when he was under arrest in the highway. OK, so you're going to defend the decision by the

SPEAKER 1
Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals by saying that it's right because it wasn't voluntary. And you're saying it wasn't voluntary, not only because he was arrested and coercively taken outside. But also because um he was drunk. And so the state of inebriation. Renders, now, I think what you're saying is the state of inebriation renders the manifesting the boisterousness and the indecent conduct and the louder profane discourse also involuntary. So you're arguing that both are involuntary. Not only was it involuntary for him to appear in public because he was under arrest and coerced, but also he was drunk and therefore being boisterous and indecent was itself involuntary as well. It wasn't a voluntarily decided condition to be in. He happened to be drunk. He couldn't control himself when he was outside. He was being boisterous because he was drunk. And that that's not a kind of, he wasn't acting voluntarily, OK? All right. So you're arguing that in, in a sense, both of the possible verbs, right? Are possibly involuntary. OK. OK. Now, for the prosecution, Maya. Hi hi. Uh, how do you respond?

SPEAKER 4
So I think you could respond by expanding the time frame that you're looking at and say, well, when he was in his house, he voluntarily decided to drink and that's what made him in this state and started this whole chain of events. And you can argue that there's some sort of causation between him. Becoming drunk voluntarily and then his conduct, um, in the car in public or, yeah.

SPEAKER 1
OK, so the first thing you want to say is you're gonna, you're gonna kind of, and you know, we're doing some Kellman here, we'll talk about Kelman, but obviously we're doing some Kellman here. I've read it, so, and you're doing it, and that's good. You're gonna expand the time frame, right? And you're gonna say, OK, it's true, counsel Robia. It's true, Councilor Rabia, that, um, he was drunk and therefore that might have been, you might consider it as involuntary. But he chose to drink, and that was a voluntary action. So he chose to drink as a voluntary action and therefore his intoxication in a public place is, is, is, is voluntary. Ah, in other words, there is a voluntary act that led to his, ah, intoxication, that led to his being boisterous. OK. All right. Now, um, Uh, co-counsel, uh, Joshua. Um, all right, do you have any other arguments for, uh, for the prosecution in this case?

SPEAKER 5
Yeah, so based on a plain reading of the statute, it doesn't define. Any exception to how the person appears in public. So. A plain reading of the statute just basically says any person who appears in a public place. And behaves a certain way. So whether or not The defendant was In public voluntarily or involuntarily is not defined in the statute, so. It really doesn't matter if the defendant was coerced into being in public.

SPEAKER 1
So your argument in a way focuses on the boisterousness and the manifesting boisterousness. You're saying, look, being in public. You know, that's OK, well, you gotta be in public, fine, but the real act here is being boisterous in public. The question is not how did you get in public, the question is what you do when you are in public. And when you are, when he is in public, he is acting boisterously, and Using a lot of curse words. And that is a choice. And that's a voluntary choice. So what's being punished here isn't simply public drunkenness. That's the point. This isn't just a public drunkenness statute. This is a being obnoxious in public. Because you're drunk And you're saying he was voluntarily acting and manifesting that boisterousness when he was in public. So your argument is if there is an act requirement. And if there is a voluntary act requirement, There's a voluntary act requirement. It is satisfied here. It is satisfied by the fact that he voluntarily was engaging in indecent conduct. Right? And that's a voluntary act. Completely voluntary. He could have shut up, he could have, you know, he could have acted properly, he could have said, Excuse me, sir, I don't know, whatever, used normal language. He didn't have to scream and shout. He acted voluntarily in being boisterous and therefore he is guilty of a crime. That's all that we need here is a voluntary act. It's not like. But it's not like every single minute of every single piece of this needs to be. Voluntary, is that there has to be at some point a voluntary act. And that's a voluntary act, being boisterous in public. Now How do you respond? How do you respond, co-counsel, for the prosecution? Uh, is it Benjamin? How do you respond to, uh, defense counsel's claim that, well, he's intoxicated, so it's not voluntary?

SPEAKER 6
Um, well, I would say there's levels to intoxication. Um, so you can be intoxicated to the point where there is perhaps some level of unconsciousness as we saw in the, in the Newton case, or perhaps you can be a defense here, there's also a level of intoxication where, um, You know, your actions can be controlled a little bit more to a, to a greater degree. And so we're not really sure what level of intoxication he has here. Um, I would also say that, um, Sorry, I lost my train of thought.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, I mean, so yeah, definitely. Levels of intoxication are good. How about being like more aggressive as a prosecutor and simply saying, wait a minute, there's no defense of intoxication. You can't kill somebody and say you're intoxicated. You can't sexually assault someone and say you're intoxicated, you can't assault someone and say, you know, there's no, there's no, there's not that turns out there isn't, there isn't a defense of intoxication. It's not like you can say I'm intoxicated and therefore I'm not guilty. If we had that, boy, the prosecutors will say there's gonna be a lot of stuff that's gonna be excused that shouldn't be excused. Now, you know. I don't know. I'd probably grant intoxication defense if I were, if, you know, if I were. Judge, but there's no way, there's no way intoxication is not a defense here. OK, now you don't know that. You have to go look at the law a little bit, but the response would be an aggressive kind of like intoxication is not going to be a defense in this state to doing all kinds of wrong things, right? So intoxication does not in a way justify any of these acts or protect these acts, OK. Um, now the defense is going to want to kind of move things back and say, and perhaps go with, wait a minute, uh, intoxication, not only that, he's an alcoholic, say, right? I mean, I'm putting words in your, uh, mouth, uh, Rayham. I'm putting words in your mouth. But, um, I mean, the next step for you, I take it, would be to say something like, well, he's not, he didn't voluntarily drink. That was a, that was a response to the first kind of. Answer, right? We've gone back and forth, we kind of skipped a few stages, but you, right, you would say, it wasn't voluntary. He didn't decide to get drunk. He got drunk. Yeah, and it also wasn't foreseeable that he was going to be arrested at the time that he drank, right? And it wasn't foreseeable that he was going to get arrested at the time. How do you, how do you respond to that one, Yasir?

SPEAKER 5
Um, we foreseeability, we can, we can probably just be thinking about like, oh, if somebody is drunk within a particular place, is it just the norm where folks are like brought into like public places, um, just that habitual, I think it's like more of a habitual act. Um, I read this in like further cases down.

SPEAKER 1
OK, OK, OK. Make sure to talk louder. Oh yeah, I'm old.

SPEAKER 5
Um, so I guess it's just really more so thinking about like, oh, do people, when folks get drunk and um what you call it and they're like in certain particular streets particular place, particular places that they get arrested, brought out to like public places, and in a sense just like seeing like, you know, more of them foreseeability

SPEAKER 1
yeah, right, um, now and so, um, and so you could go with foreseeability, uh, you could go with something like, well, at some point he voluntarily drank. And became an alcoholic if in fact, if in fact we're going to move it all the way back to the fact that he's an alcoholic, then at some point there was a voluntary choice to drink which then led to alcoholism, which might be involuntary, but at that point you've got a voluntary act to begin with. Um, uh, but, um, And I take it the prosecution's going to want to say, look, none of this drinking stuff matters, and it might depend a little bit also on what he was arrested for. Maybe he was arrested for domestic abuse. Maybe he was arrested on a completely different charge. Maybe he was, he was being arrested for murder. I mean, you know. We could have any kind of hypotheticals and, and to a certain extent I would think that whatever he gets arrested for is probably. Will probably be used in the argument somehow, right? Like if he wears, if he's getting arrested for a joint. I think defense counsel would make a big deal out of that, right? You know you'd be you'd be up there saying wait a minute, this guy is getting, yeah, he's engaged in decent conduct he's at home, he's getting high at home, he's getting arrested because of that, brought into public. I mean that's ridiculous. It's a waste of taxpayer money, blah blah blah, now you've got, now you've got a charge and it's you know. On the other hand, if he gets arrested, if he was arrested for domestic abuse, I think that in some way the prosecution would use that, right? To say, wait a minute, he's drunk. Drunkenness is tied to domestic abuse. He's getting arrested for that, you know, the voluntariness of the domestic abuse itself probably led to the fact that he gets arrested. He's in public, etc. and so you can imagine that that would kind of cast a shadow that would be favorable for the prosecution in these kind of in the kind of way in which we'd be kind of trying to eke out the judge's sentiments on the case, right. OK. But let's just get back for a second here to this. So the prosecution's argument now is. There is a voluntary act. He was boisterous in public. That's enough. What do you have? You don't have to have like voluntariness all around. It's not as if like every single moment has to be voluntary. It's not like you have to have a. What does it say? An unlawful act consequent upon such vicious will, that's all it requires under Blackstone. There has to be, An act that has to be voluntary, and in this case, voluntary, there was enough, he was, he was being boisterous. Voluntarily He was being boisterous voluntarily. What's wrong with that? Yes, let's see.

SPEAKER 5
Um, I guess just reading code, um, reading the code altogether, no, no, remember you're the prosecutor. Oh yeah, OK.

SPEAKER 1
Uh, oh, That sounds good. I want you to stick in your role for a second.

SPEAKER 5
Uh, whatchamacallit, OK, um, I guess reading, um, what you call it, given that we're saying that manifesting that drunken that, that was definitely voluntary, um, we can definitely just add to the fact of just like saying like yes, he was drunk and I think it's just really going back to that, just that habitual like no one was drunk, yeah, we don't care.

SPEAKER 1
I don't care. He was drunk, but I don't care he was drunk. I don't care whether he was a drunkard. I don't care whether he's got drinking problems. I don't care about anything. I don't care. I just don't care what he did, whatever, but you know what you can't do is you can't be out in the public saying. Dirty words. Except if you're in New York. No, this is Alabama, um, you know, it's Alabama. I couldn't even say. Well, I'm not gonna say it. That's it. I couldn't even use the Lord's name in vain. When I was living in Alabama. That would have been a crime. But anyway, it's Alabama, they don't want people using curse words out in public. They have, you know, it's not New York, it's not New York, right? OK, all right, so. It's voluntary. It was a voluntary acting. He was boisterous. Why are we even debating this case? Why are you even debating this case? It's clear. That he acted boisterously. Let's look at a second at the Model Penal Code, OK? Let's look at the Model Penal Code. What does the Model Penal Code require? Hm? OK, so look at the flip the back of your book, flip to the back of the book. Oh gosh, I lost the page. Um, oh no, I didn't lose the page. Uh, so you've got your model penal code at the back of your book, right? Article 2, general principles of liability, Section 2.01. Section 2.01. OK, Charles, what does section 2.01 say? Remember you're the prosecutor, yeah.

SPEAKER 0
Let's find that. Yeah, so 2.01 pretty much states, well, it has four provisions in it. It says that yeah let's go with the first one. Yeah, it says a person is not guilty of an offense unless his liability is based on conduct which includes a voluntary act or the omission to perform an act of which he is physically capable. OK.

SPEAKER 1
All right. And so as prosecutor, where does that lead you with this statute?

SPEAKER 0
Um, Well, Like we stated before, um. The, the action of like drinking or getting drunk, like that's like a voluntary action and given the fact that uh the NPC 201 says that a person is not guilty of an offense unless he is liable based on the conduct which includes a voluntary act, I think we could sort of like tie the. The statute itself here to this case by pretty much arguing the fact that him being boisterous in the public space, uh, because due to drunkenness and whatnot is itself still a voluntary so you wanna rest on the drunkenness

SPEAKER 1
as being voluntary. Is that your strongest argument, do you think?

SPEAKER 0
Well, the boisterous aspect of it is the is the strongest argument in my opinion.

SPEAKER 1
All right, so you rest on the boisterousness. You rest on the boisterousness. That is the strongest argument you've got. That was a voluntary act. It only look at the, look at the model penal code. It only requires one. One voluntary act, right? Isn't that all it requires? All it requires is that it includes a voluntary act. It's all it does. It's on conduct which includes a voluntary act. What is, OK, what is conduct? Hmm, how would you know what, what is conduct? Well, we'll look at that in a second. Actually, we'll go back to our judges to figure out what conduct is. Isabel and Nicole, you might tell me in a minute what conduct actually means, but let's assume that we, for a second, um, uh, all this says is, uh, is based on conduct which includes a voluntary act. And here you're saying, Charles, there was a voluntary act. He was boisterous in public. That's voluntary. Period. What's the problem? And quickly, what is a voluntary act, Isabel? I mean, sorry, what is conduct? What does conduct mean? Um, I guess it's a physical movement that is voluntary. Uh, where do you, where, where do you get that idea? Oh, that was just a guess. OK, no, that's it's a good guess. Sorry, it's a good guess. Where would you go to figure out what conduct means? You might go to the definitions, right? Yeah, sorry, that's where I'm looking. OK, good, good. So section 5 of the general definitions conduct means. An action Right. It's a, it's a section 1.13 general definitions. Section 5 or little 5. You got it. Yeah, sorry, no worries. Um, it means an action or omission and it's accompanying state of mind or where relevant, a series of acts and omissions. OK, all right, so an action, it's an action or omission. Well, uh, here, um, we're not really dealing with an omission case, although we might be able to try and create an omission case, but here it's probably an action, so it's an action, an action, OK. Anything else where conduct is is kind of like defined. Section 9, elements of an offense means such conduct. Or such attendant circumstances or such a result of conduct as is included in the description of the forbidden conduct in the definition of the offense. OK, so they're using conduct slightly differently in, in these different uh provisions, slightly differently. Um, Uh, we know conduct is an action, but we also know that conduct can be an element of an offense. And also the result of conduct can be an element of an offense. So that's Eli where you got the, uh, you got the verb, when you were talking about the verb, right? That seems like conduct. Conduct is the verb thing. But another element could be a result of conduct. Right, uh, if you look under at the, at the section 9, conduct, an element of offense could be conduct, an attendant circumstance, or a result of conduct. OK, all right, uh, result of conduct. Well, that's what we're gonna see in the homicide context. Now, don't you have to go? Yeah, you're gonna be late here. Go ahead, um. Ah, the result of conduct is what we're going to see mostly for homicides, OK? In other words, homicide is defined as causing death. Alright, that's, that's usually most, some statutes say killing, but it's very rare. Most statutes say homicide is when a person causes someone's death. OK? That would be result of conduct. There was some kind of conduct that caused death. Um. So their elements can either be a conduct. An attendant circumstance or a result of conduct. Do you have any idea here on this statute, um, Uh, Nicole, what an attendance circumstance might be. On this statute, so I think the attendant circumstance would be the drunkenness. Yes, an attendant circumstance, well, I say that boldly, don't I? Depends who you're arguing for in the case, but you could argue while intoxicated or drunk. That's an attendant circumstance. In fact, that is what the prosecution would want to argue mostly. Prosecution would want to say actually the whole drunkenness thing. That's just an attendant circumstance, alright? That doesn't, it's not the voluntary act, that's not the act, that's the attendant circumstance. It has to be the case that the person is drunk. OK, alright, so that you just put aside. It has to be the case that the person is drunk. That's an attendant circumstance. That's an element of this crime. If you want to prove this crime to a jury, you have to prove that the person was intoxicated or drunk. OK. And and the defense could be, no, Mr. Smith was not intoxicated and drunk. Maybe a defense of Mr. Martin, did I say Mr. Smith? Mr. Martin, maybe a defense of Mr. Martin is he was not drunk. He was pissed. OK? He was out there in the middle of the road, getting arrested at 3 o'clock in the morning in his Boxer shorts. It's 5 degrees outside and he's just pissed, so he swore up and down and he really let them have it, but he was not drunk. He's a teetotaler. He didn't have any, any alcohol that night. That would be a defense, I think, according to the defense. I mean, according to the defense, right? Because you would say, wait a minute, what are the elements of the crime? What are the elements of the crime? Now Crimes don't come with their own little instruction booklet on what the elements are. There are jury instructions. There are pattern jury instructions that usually will list what the elements are. But your task as a lawyer. Is to play around with the elements. For your. Client And the defense would be saying, well, one of the elements that has to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt is that he was drunk. I'm not sure the prosecution would necessarily want to argue that. OK. All right. So that could be an intended circumstance. There's no result of conduct here. The conduct here then would be possibly appearing in public, or possibly manifesting a drunk condition by being boisterous, by being boisterous, that could be the conduct. But if you take those definitions, and you look at what this requires, which is merely That liability be based on conduct which includes a voluntary act. It includes a voluntary act. There's been a voluntary act here. He's been boisterous. In public. Maybe in fact, the prosecution could argue that the appearing in public is kind of an attendant circumstance. It has to be that you're in public when you are boisterous. OK. So now We're In Alabama Supreme Court. How do we decide this case? Uh. Una. What's your best argument here left for the defense?

SPEAKER 7
Mm I'm struggling with the idea that the statute seems to imply that like there are multiple acts required for this offense to have been committed and that the prosecution seems to be under the assumption that you only need to have voluntarily committed one of them.

SPEAKER 1
OK, so you might want to argue, as the defense, you might want to argue, well, what this means in section 2.011 is that any act element has to be voluntary. It's not, it's not really saying that you, you just have to have one voluntary thing. It's that all of it needs to be voluntary. It all needs to be voluntary. So the being taken out in a public place needs to be voluntary, and then manifesting boisterous conduct needs to be voluntary. So kind of like what applies to one applies to the other, right? OK, and we'll see some of that in the Model Penal Code, uh, we'll see that tomorrow in an interesting way, um, but how would you respond to that, uh, Phillip? For the prosecution. I mean, again, you could go with like a plain reading of the Model Penal code and it does not say either in the statute or the Model Penal code that Um, each individual element needs to be, you know, shown to be voluntary on this basis, so there's, there's not like explicitly enumerated. All it says is requires one voluntary act. Right, that the words, the words of the statute just say, including a voluntary act. That doesn't say that every single step of the process has to be some kind of voluntary act. It just says there's some, as long as there's a voluntariness piece to this that's satisfied, it shows enough that they were acting. In a bad way, right? OK, uh, Anna? What's your final argument, a defense or prosecution? You tell me your, your defense. You guys are the defense.

SPEAKER 8
Um. Hm, I guess my final argument, um, it could be like maybe like the evil to be remedied, so to speak, by the statute, um, is necessarily going into public and causing incident while drunk and in that case that is not the situation here. So if the court were to rule um against the defendant in this case, it could cause, um. Unnecessary situations in the future that goes against the intent of the statute, like the police to be able to go into someone's home and drag them out in any scenario and be able to increase the, uh, arguments that they have against that person.

SPEAKER 1
OK, so, um, so it's a kind of like a spirit of the law rather than the words of the law, right? I don't know if you've done that before. That's a regular statutory move, right? Um. Uh, I'm sorry. Your name again? No. Philip, yeah, sorry, Philip was arguing the, the words, the text. It was a textual argument, right? The words say just a voluntary act. It doesn't say more than that. And you were arguing. The spirit of the law, the kind of what is the law trying to get at? It's trying to get at this idea that people shouldn't that you know you shouldn't go into public and make a nuisance of yourself, but going into public, you're not going into public if you're being transported there. Sorry, Anna, yes, and Ruben, last argument for the defense.

SPEAKER 9
Um Yeah, I think I would definitely add on to that fact too. I think especially considering the reality of how that would operate, I think. I think especially in expanding the time scope as it was kind of previously mentioned and considering like what was the intent of those who arrested him and bringing him out to accomplish I think in how you mentioned that in Alabama they didn't so uh that's interesting.

SPEAKER 1
So are you're saying there's kind of like there's shared responsibility here. I mean it's not just all, it's just not all him. I mean they bring him out, they're, they're arresting him, they're bringing him out. There's kind of, it's like a diminished responsibility or something.

SPEAKER 9
Yes, I was, yeah, I think especially in considering that,

SPEAKER 1
and that's interesting in the, in the torts context in some states there is, you can like impute portions of liability, per percentages of responsibility to particular people and others. That's interesting. OK, all right. OK. uh, Andre, last, last, last argument for the prosecution. I would actually disagree with, um, that the spirit of the law. Um, doesn't also align with what the text actually says, because I think the spirit of the law is to rent, to prevent drunken, um, boisterousness or indecent conduct, and that is exactly what happened. And therefore, The person should be Convicted of that. OK, all right, so turning around the spirit of the law argument. OK. All right, so. Were there moments during this conversation? Were there moments during this conversation? When all you saw was. Yellow fish. I And then moments in this conversation where all you saw were green frogs. That's how I received this case. I can, I can, I can get myself to only see. Green frogs here. Very easily. And I can get myself to like, it's like, what, what the hell? I mean, he was outside and he was being boisterous. That's a voluntary act. You can't, in the, in the criminal law, you cannot go with like intoxication as a defense. I, I wish you could, but you can't. It's like it's just, it doesn't fly. It doesn't fly. If intoxication is not a defense, intoxication is not gonna be a defense. He was boisterous, period. What's the end? I mean, I don't understand. It's not, it's not complicated, right? And then there are other times where it's just like I can read the case and think about it and convince myself that there's no way in hell that this was a voluntary act. He got arrested in his home. He got taken outside. Right? Um, now, you know, this is Escher, right? Uh, famous Dutch artist who had this tendency to always try and kind of show you that, you know, you might not see what you're seeing, you know, it's like there are only frogs here, right? Um, but actually, no, there are fish, there are only fish, and Our mind can work that way, right? It can kind of go from only seeing, I mean, only seeing one, looking at something and only seeing one way and looking at it again and then seeing something completely different. And these are effects of time. In this case, it's an effect of time framing, which is what Which was Mark what Mark Kelman was trying to get at, right? It's kind of like we can make a list of like what happens in this case. Well, there's a, there's some kind of crime for which he's arrested, he then gets drunk, he then gets arrested, he then is taken outside, and he then is boisterous. And how you frame that temporally is going to have a big role. If you, you can write the opinion, you can write the opinion in two ways. You can write a majority and the dissent that are going to be equally compelling in part you're going to be playing with the facts. You're going to be stretching or kind of condensing the facts that you talk about. You might start the crime. You might start if you just if you just want to go with the. Uh, the, the prosecution, you're just gonna focus on the boisterousness. What was he, what was he saying when he was on the street, right? And you kind of like get everybody to focus on that and it's like well you know that's clearly illegal, but if you want, and it all has to do with framing, time framing, right? Framing, framing, which is really important because we know from behavioral law and economics and behavioral economics and behavioral psychology that framing can be really key to how you think about a case. Are these the same length? Yes, of course they are, but jeez, I don't think they are when I look at them. Or you know, this study, right? The anchoring example, right? You give exactly the same information to really good real estate, um, agents. You give them the whole package and everything. They get to have everything the same. If you say that the house is worth 119, they're gonna say it's worth a lot less than if you say the house is worth 149. Right? These are kind of, these are just kind of ways in which kind of framing a case or framing a situation. Can make you see something different. OK. Um, and that I think is what's going on in these cases, in the Decina case as well, which is about the epilepsy. Situation or in the In the other cases that you've read about, the, the, the homelessness cases, is someone is sleeping on, sleeping outside because there is no shelter, right? Is that voluntary? Is it not voluntary? Or the Huey Newton case, right, he's got a bullet in his stomach. And he's kind of, is, is he conscious or not? I mean, in all these cases, it's kind of like how you frame it. OK. All right, we are out of time, so we will pretty much continue here to jump into the second piece of it, which is mental states tomorrow. OK? All right.

SPEAKER 0
Thank you thanks. Hi, about the case. So the Alabama court seems to me that there's no way that it requires. Like because like like my, it says and then manifest. So doesn't that imply that it requires, that's a.
