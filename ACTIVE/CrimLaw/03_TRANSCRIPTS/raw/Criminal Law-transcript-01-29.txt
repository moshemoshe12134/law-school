Like just have as much money. I it could happen like. Mr. 1. Shreya. Function function. Alright. All right. Yeah. Oh Oh Are we spinning Is this not working? um. I haven't talked. Yeah, I haven't talked. They just, oh, maybe not. There's no way I'm picking that up. Yeah, I know this is. Yeah. I Yeah. So in this case. I really feel like a rapper like talking about murder and speaking into it. All right, everyone. Welcome back. This is working. Hold on for a sec. All right. OK, so we were trying to figure out the difference. Between premeditation. And intent. Uh, There was a question at the end of class about Just how all this relates to the. Model penal code. It should be, so it should be clear to you that intent, the category intent to cause death here, that's purpose under the Model Penal Code, essentially, OK? So you know the Model Penal Code has 4 categories, um, and the highest one, purpose is is what would also be called intent, intent or purpose, OK? Um, the other categories. Uh The other categories don't map on as neatly. OK, and so you need to be thinking about what would knowledge be in a model penal code jurisdiction compared to these categories. Where does recklessness fit? Is it, it looks like, well, recklessness looks like it's in manslaughter here, right? Ordinary recklessness, um, but there's also a form of extreme recklessness that applies as well sometimes. So you, you, you are, we are, what we're doing is we're trying to, you know, see the world through two lenses, whatever the statute specifically says intent to cause crime, and then kind of what it would be equivalent in our general modern understanding of those four categories, OK. All right, and premeditation doesn't apply in a lot of states, right? So there are a lot of states where there is no definition of homicide as being as requiring premeditation. There are a lot of states where you're not going to have a first degree. Distinction with 2nd degree that turns on whether it's premeditated or not, OK? So You, so what, what your task is as a student, but also as a lawyer. Is to kind of understand the lay of the land, right? Figure out what your statute in whatever state you're practicing. Requires Right, in whatever state your case is, because you can practice in many states. Figure out what the statute requires and then be able to push things in one direction or the other, OK? You shouldn't When you're reading these cases, you shouldn't be thinking, oh, that's the law. Right? Law doesn't exist. OK, there is no that's the law. There is no black letter law. OK? You come to school thinking that's what you're gonna learn. If that's what you're learning, you're learning the wrong thing because it doesn't exist. What you've got to learn as lawyers is, is how to move things. In a direction that is beneficial to your client. All right. So never think that like, oh OK, I read this case, that's the law. Always place yourself in the position of being the next court, the higher court, whenever you read a decision. Right, thinking to yourself, hm, is this right or wrong? And you know what, if it's right or wrong, it's really just gonna depend on what perspective and who you're arguing for. OK. All right. Let's wrap up this premeditation thing very quickly. Uh, with two other cases. Um, Heather, you're still the prosecutor. Uh, I think you guys were the prosecutor. Uh, Hao Qing, you are the defense attorney if I recall correctly. Um, on the Carroll case, OK, Commonwealth versus Carroll, it's a Pennsylvania case from 1963. Um, Involving a husband who kills his wife. And um what kind of, what kind of facts would you be stressing, Heather, as the prosecutor? Uh, to push this towards premeditation.

SPEAKER 1
Um, if I recall, this is where the gun is above the bed. We have an argument and he takes the gun and shoots his wife. Yes, yes. Well, I think right where you started. Yeah, I was gonna say the gun is above the bed, right?

SPEAKER 0
What is the gun doing there?

SPEAKER 1
It's just sitting there, not normally where I put, would put a gun if I had one, and he looks at it as well and then goes to pick it up, which I think in like in that instance he's obviously thinking about doing something pretty ill with a gun.

SPEAKER 0
OK, all right, um, OK, so you might try to do some time. Work here, uh, you, you're scrunching, you're scrunching the premeditation there a little bit, um, kind of like looking at the gun before he shoots it. Um, what are the other things that you could rely on, so one thing is like you know the, the, the placement of the murder weapon, that's, that's, that was an odd, it looked like it seems like he was ready to kill his wife by placing the gun there and that and that would have been something. That, you know, would have been in a way premeditated. There's really a horrible sound coming from somewhere. Is it always like this? It was like this yesterday. Have you guys complained? Um, OK, it's, it's somewhere around here. We'll complain. Uh, maybe we can complain to, uh, building services or something. Not, it's not immediate, but today we'll do it. We'll do it today. We'll do it today. Um, yeah, you could actually, you could tell John in the, in the, in the, in the whatever that it's not an emergency, Courtney. All right, bye. But, but, 00. It's coming back. OK, alright. OK, so you've got the placement of the gun, which seems, uh, and, and the placement of the gun, um. The placement of the gun, sorry. Nua What kind of, what kind of evidence would that be? Um, it might be related to intent, I think. Sure, yeah, it's really, no, that's not, no, no, no, you had preplanning behavior you? Yes, planning behavior. That was you, planning behavior, right? That sounds like planning behavior possibly. Maybe he was planning anything else?

SPEAKER 1
Um, he concealed the body after the murder.

SPEAKER 0
OK, so conceals the body. Now how, so how do we deal with kind of post-crime stuff? Does that fit any, does that fit in any of the Anderson, Sabrina, does that fit in any of the Anderson categories for you?

SPEAKER 1
Particular. Maybe the manor, which one manner.

SPEAKER 0
I feel like manner goes to both, yeah, maybe, maybe. I mean, that's the closest one, definitely, yeah, manner, the manner of killing, including like disposing the body, what the person does after the crime could be relevant, yeah, um, OK, uh, Shuru, anything else? For the prosecution Um, that would be, that would be helpful to try and show that there was premeditation here.

SPEAKER 2
Um, I think there was, um, a time lapse, um, where they had, um, several arguments and he. He went to pick up the gun, although he said that if the gun was on the floor, he wouldn't have picked it up, but that action would definitely show both the intent and the premeditation.

SPEAKER 0
Uh, OK, so what I mean, so, well, the fact that they've been having a violent argument for a while, a violent and protracted argument, is that what you're focusing on, a violent and protracted argument? OK, all right, so maybe, or maybe you might want to even pull it back further and say, you know, it looks like there's been domestic abuse here for a while, right? Um, in 1958 she suffered a mental, a fractured skull while attempting to leave the car in the course of an argument. I mean, you know, so maybe this was, there was a long history of abuse, um, and this was the culmination of that, right? Uh, OK, on the defense side, what are you, what are you focusing on?

SPEAKER 3
Um, well, I would say this is not planned because like, um, the weapon is just there. Like it would be odd for someone to plan a killing to just put a gun to some openly available place and to grab it and uh to say that this is like heavily planned um way to exercise this crime.

SPEAKER 0
OK, so, hm, yeah, OK, hmm. Um, It's almost as if you're saying it could have been more planned, right? Or it could have been better planned. Or that Yeah, because I remember I read to say

SPEAKER 3
that the defendant remembered that the gun was there. Like it wasn't like for him to say that I planned to, to, to place the gun there for the purpose of killing someone, but it's just like a moment of impulsion that he remembered, OK, there's some something handy over there, and grab the gun and do something horrible, but it's not like that he planned to do something horrible.

SPEAKER 0
I suppose the jury would be thinking, well, obviously he's not going to say he planned and he planted the gun there. So he's obviously gonna say like, you know. I realized it was there or something rather than I planned it. Um, Um, I mean, you could, you could argue that. You know, I mean, on the one hand, Heather says that's a strange place to put a gun. On the other hand, you know, if what you're interested is in some form of self-defense in case someone breaks into your home, where are you going to put the gun? You're going to put the gun, I don't know, under the mattress, near the bed or something, I mean, so it wouldn't be absolutely crazy that the gun would be in proximity of the bed. Um, if it's actually being used for self defense, um, to defend a home or something like that, uh, anything else, Daniel?

SPEAKER 4
Well, you could, uh, make an inverse argument with regard to the cleanup. So you could say that the fact that it was so sloppy and, uh, that it wasn't carefully planned out, that he kind of haphazardly wrapped up the body in the sheets, took it to the dump, uh, would seem to indicate an absence of premeditation.

SPEAKER 0
Right, OK, OK, that's a, that's a, that's a, that's a, that's a pretty compelling argument, right? I mean, um. It didn't, it's. I mean, the whole afterwards seems completely. Irrational, unplanned, unthought out. He He doesn't know. He has no idea what to do with the body. And goes to work. I mean, you know, so, um, arguably you could try to say something like that. It, it shows that, um. It shows that there wasn't any advance planning at all, that the incident was unexpected, completely unexpected, right? Uh, OK, and then, and then, um, and then, you know, the mode, the whole motive question, uh. It's like, uh. Relates to, you know, questions of domestic abuse, and questions of um. And what the relationship was, um, and his psychological and mental state at the time. OK. All right, now if we compare that case then to the Forrest case which you have, uh, it's the last case before we get to, uh, mitigation, uh, to manslaughter. So it's on page 461 or 4336, state versus Forrest, which is a North Carolina case. Um, Shreya. As the prosecutor in that case, do you find premeditation, or what would you rely on? Um, I would find premeditation because it was a mercy killing. OK. Tell me more. Um, so the father was terminally ill and the son killed him to relieve him of his suffering. OK, and so. That satisfies, say what prongs of an analysis that one would have for premeditation. Uh, I think, uh, in the Anderson factors, uh, one planning activity would have been satisfied, OK, um, because, because of the feelings what was, what, what, what was included in planning here. How would you say that in this particular case there was planning? Like the son saw his father suffer over a period of time and then decided to believe the suffering. He drives a gun, right? He drives to the Uh, home to the, to the facility where his father is with a gun. If that's not planned. You know, I don't know what is planned. OK, uh, Michael, you're gonna have to defend this case in a minute. Um, Cecilia, uh, so we've got planning activity. What else do we have? I think we have a motive with the mercy, which is what, um, that he wants to relieve his father of suffering, right? We've got the motive. And then what's the last category? The manner or preconceived design, OK. And, um, again, like driving to the facility with a gun kind of speaks to that. OK, OK, OK. All right. OK, good. Michael, do you have any defense at all in this case?

SPEAKER 5
It's a, it's a tough one for sure. Um, it is a tough one. I, I noticed that the, the Model Penal code and a lot of statutes had a special carve out for assisted suicide, and perhaps this falls into that category better than first degree murder.

SPEAKER 0
well. This is a little bit more than assisted suicide, you know. I mean, so what, what is your understanding of assisted suicide?

SPEAKER 5
Someone wants to kill themselves because and Doctor Kevorkian, someone wants to kill themselves because they're terminally ill and a doctor helps them do it. Right, right, right, right.

SPEAKER 0
Um And here we really don't, here we really don't have any facts about what the father was, what the father was thinking, right? So I think it would be pretty hard to bring it under kind of an assisted suicide. Um, So what Is there anything else you can muster up here?

SPEAKER 5
It, it was, there was premeditation, but it wasn't malice or wickedness. It was merciful, I guess is the best I could come up with the manner, the manner of the crime maybe was, was different than the manner of, of getting into a fight with someone and shooting them. There was no fight. There was nothing beforehand that premeditated that.

SPEAKER 0
Interesting. Manner. OK, that's an interesting tack. Um, Yeah I think that I think that it's really hard to defend this case in terms of premeditation. I think it's a pretty clear case of premeditation. Um, And it's actually a case like this that pushed the model penal code writers. To get rid of premeditation, right? It's, it's precisely because of a situation like this, which is relatively exceptional, maybe. That the authors of the Model Penal Code came to the conclusion that It doesn't always mean that you are. The worst of the worst offenders if you are engaged in premeditation. In fact, it might be the case that the cold blooded killer. Who does not even think for a second about killing someone. Is worse in terms of their blameworthiness than someone who has. Who is hesitating, and in the process of hesitating. Is planning Right? In other words, the process of planning itself could be associated with. Uh, a form of kind of uncertainty, thinking, thinking it through. It could be that the planning that the, it could be that the delay reflects something different than evil blameworthiness, right? And so as a result, uh, The model penal code you'll see in following the squib, so the squib that's C right before mitigation of manslaughter. Uh, about 461 or 437, right, rejecting premeditation with this idea that prior reflection may reveal the uncertainties of a tortured conscience rather than exceptional depravity. Or as they write, the suddenness of the killing may simply reveal callousness so complete and depravity so extreme that no hesitation is required. OK? All right. So, um, In a way, what we're dealing with here is the problem between rules and standards, right, which recurs, recur, it recurred during your first semester. It's going to recur, it's, it's going to recur at all times. The, the problem between rule and standard is this idea that, you know, well we, we, we want to put in a rule about Premeditation, say that it makes it worse, but then you're going to find cases at the edge. That don't really satisfy the underlying The underlying principle was premeditation makes it worse because it reflects some evil intent. Right? If you had and so and so that's what and that creates the problem. The rule creates the problem because there are going to be certain cases at the edge that really don't fit in well with that strict rule, strict rule. If there's premeditation, you're in category one. First degree murder You're subject to the death penalty or something like that. It's like for the little forest cases. Wait a minute, are you're going to subject. This young man to the death penalty because he was so distraught about his father's condition that he tried to help his father end his life. No, it can't be right. Because the problem is that it, the rule boundedness of it, right? You could have a standard which says, well, Uh, Something goes into the, into first degree murder when it has the kind of premeditation that we associate with an evil intent or an evil mind. Right? Um, So you could have, you could have solved it by creating a softer standard rather than simply that hard rule requiring premeditation. Somehow giving what the spirit of the law was intended to do. But clearly the Model Penal Code authors don't do that, and the problem typically with that is that it starts to get. Mushy, because now we have to define what, what do you mean by evil intent? Right? If you turn it into a standard, then all of a sudden it feels as if there's too much discretion, too much. Moral discretion in how you define those attributes that you're trying to get at. Right? But you could say, look, that's what the criminal law is all about. And we're gonna see that in this next section uh on uh on manslaughter. It's all about kind of. The mushy moral determinations. Cultural imperialism, how we decide how people should be behaving, what we think is bad behavior, illegal behavior, immoral behavior, and what is not. And so it could be that what we should have instead is just a standard that allows. The jury to impose its community feelings, right? All right, let's look at that in the context of uh mitigation, um. Mitigation of manslaughter, OK. All right. So again, as I suggested, all of homicide law is is fascinating because what it is, is it's this movement. From one category to another and where you're placed in those categories is going to be really important because it's going to determine the length of the sentence. It's going to determine how bad the crime is viewed. It's going to determine how much you are going to be punished, right? OK, so right now we're going. So we looked at the premeditation versus purpose or intent, which is a small, that's usually a small gradation in a way. It's actually I mean when it applies if you have it in a state, it'll usually lift you up to something that becomes death eligible so I mean it's not that small, it could be a matter of life or death, but it's a small gradation in the sense that there's not that much difference between thinking of something as premeditated and thinking of something as intentional, right? Um, premeditation in states that retain premeditation, they'll usually say, and there's a little bit of discussion in the book there, it's, it's got to be a little bit more than intent. It's gotta be that you've thought about it or you've thought about it and you've you've thought about it twice, right? OK, now the next category distinction we're going to talk about. Moves you from Murder Like, which is the worst, or possibly first degree murder, intentional murder, it's, it's usually an intentional murder, right, to something that would be called voluntary manslaughter. OK, and so here you could be talking about the death sentence versus, uh, you know. Uh, a prison sentence, OK? Uh, in, um. Uh, In New York it would be 25 max uh versus possibly life. OK? All right, so we've got 3 cases, um. Gerard, uh, Mayer, and Casasa, let's try and get through these cases and see how they help us understand the law of manslaughter. All right. Uh, Muharem. How you doing? Um, OK, let's start with the Giroard case, OK? Uh, just tell me, tell me quickly what, what we've got going here in terms of the facts. You, Kyle, and Charlie are gonna be my judges today, all right? Um, basically, the wife was provoking, uh, her husband, and then the husband killed her as a result of the direct taunting. Yes, yes, uh, so they were engaged in a domestic conflict, and as a result of that conflict. Uh, the defendant, Steven Gerrard, killed his wife. How did he kill her? Um Stab wounds? Yes. Uh, he had, and what did he use? Kitchen knife. A kitchen knife, OK. Used a kitchen knife that he had hidden behind the pillow and stabbed her 19 times. OK. All right, now, um, did you get a sense of, uh. Whether this case goes to a jury or whether it's a Bench trial. And do you know the distinction? Um I don't know that this. I don't think it went to a jury. It didn't go to a jury, right? OK, so when you try a case, when you, if the case goes to trial, um, the defense can waive a jury and try it to the judge only. OK, that's called a bench trial. And one of the interesting things is you know actually all three of these cases are bench trials rather than jury trials. Um And the reason to go before a judge rather than a jury. Is if you think as defense counsel or for the defendant, if you think that it is more likely. That a judge Who sees a lot of homicide cases. And who Has been inured in a way to. Uh, homicide cases. Is more likely to give you. Some slack As the defense Um, The worry of course is that a jury of 12 ordinary citizens will never have seen any of these cases, will never have seen a homicide case, and that they're going to be really appalled in a way by the case, right. It's like you. I mean, you guys, I mean, I don't know how many of you have. Sat in a jury already or not, but I mean these are, these are your first, these are for some of you, these are your first criminal cases, right? And for some of you, you might be reading these cases and, and just thinking wow this is really horrible, right? And you know, in a couple of months, you'll be reading one of these cases, you're like. Yeah, OK, all right. You know, not as horrible. I mean, boy, it's not as horrible as that other one I tried last week. Woo, you should have seen that one, right? So the idea here is on the defense side, you're gonna be thinking, let me get a judge who has seen a lot of these cases. And who's gonna be not and who's gonna be able to try and figure out the distinctions and whether or not, you know, whether or not in fact this person was uh acting in heat of passion or something like that so it can can make a cool collected decision about the case rather than it's like the first case you get and you're you're just appalled and you know it's it the, you know these cases are. are bloody and ugly, and there are a lot of exhibits and photographs from the scene of the crime, etc. that can inflame. A jury, OK? So you notice that actually all three of these are bench trials. Which is paradoxical in part because all three of these are cases where the court says we should be letting the jury decide. OK, let's, we'll come back to that. OK, so, um, so it is a bench trial. So what's the, what's, so since it's a bench trial, what is the legal issue that's being raised, uh, Kyle? Yeah, so Mr. Gerard's legal team is arguing that the, uh, insults and taunts of his wife should be considered adequate provocation, reducing the murder to, uh, reducing the second degree murder to manslaughter. Right. And so, and just technically, just as a technical matter. You know, last time we were talking about the fact that the case Was a question of whether the jury instructions were erroneous, right? Um, that's how we were, that's how we were discussing, that's how the case came up on appeal. Was the jury instructions erroneous? Well, there's no jury instruction here. So what is it that, what's the legal, what's the legal claim that the defense is raising on appeal, right? Because we're on appeal from the trial court and the bench trial and the conviction. Tricky little question. But the important question always know how are we where we are right now, right? Do you get a sense? Um, no, I actually wasn't quite sure. Yeah, yeah, so it's actually that um the court. Right, ah, when it, when it, uh, ruled, when it found the defendant guilty. Would have said from the bench, basically, I'm finding you guilty because it's not a jury verdict, so it's the judge verdict. And at that point, the judge would have said, and I'm not crediting any of the evidence about uh heat of passion. Because words alone. Aren't enough, right? And so the judge would have then that that would have been the judge's um that would have been the equivalent of a judge's opinion, right, or decision, right, which then you would appeal saying wait there's there's legal error there. It's not right that you can't consider words in the context of uh this defense. OK. All right, so that's how it comes up and that would be the argument. The argument would be. The court, the judge during the bench trial made an error. In not allowing the consideration of uh the words that were here as to whether or not they uh. Kind of uh justified in some way or excused because of a heat of passion, a provocation, etc. OK? All right, um, And uh Uh, Charlie, tell me a little bit, um, well, tell me a little bit how the court rules and on what basis the court rules, uh.

SPEAKER 6
The court rules that in this case, the words alone are, are not sufficient to justify the second degree over 1st degree. And a big reason is that Um, like words could constitute provocation if it's combined with, um, indication of intent to harm. But like in this case, the husband was like 200 pounds and like way taller than, uh, his wife who was like much smaller than he is. So, um, even though uh the words were like hurtful, um, it's not reasonable to infer that there would be intention to harm in that case.

SPEAKER 0
Correct, yes, um, all right, now, um, did you get a sense from this case as to, um, what are the typical kind of circumstances where this kind of defense would arise and would satisfy the standards in. The state of Maryland.

SPEAKER 6
Um, yeah, maybe if the two people were more similar in stature or, you know, the person who's uh uh saying the threatening things, maybe like was getting ready to like fight or like maybe had like a weapon, like a gun holster.

SPEAKER 0
Might not be enough, right? It might be more that actually there needs to be a fight. Right? Or something like that. There are certain categories, uh, this is on page 463 or 438. Um, it's the paragraph that starts, petitioner relies primarily on out of court cases. Um, and it talks about the traditional circumstances when a. Defense like this heat of passion would apply. Get a sense of what those traditional circumstances are, extreme assault or battery, OK, so as you were saying, if there was actually like a physical assault or battery, uh, if they're in mutual combat. Right, then the heat of passion defense might work if the defendant is getting illegally arrested, if there's a serious injury or abuse to a close relative, or if it's a sudden discovery of a spouse's adultery. OK. Now the classic case for this is the discovery of adultery. The classic case for this, and in most jurisdictions where this kind of came from, the heat of passion. was if a Husband found his wife in the act of, um, adultery. And classically the way this worked, the way this operated, was that the justification was only for the For the homicide of the paramour. So in other words, uh, if a husband found his wife in flagrant uh act of adultery. The husband that there would be a kind of a heat of passion defense if the husband then kills the paramour. OK. That was the kind of the, the kind of most contained way in which the heat of passion defense originated. OK. It actually didn't apply if the husband killed the wife. It only applied to the um to the paramour. Um. And, but what you have here is, in these typical circumstances, certain categories. Alright? Certain categories. And what you have with this case is a case where the court is. Kind of trying to put things in boxes, in a way, right? Um, now, the heat of passion instructions vary by state, OK, and as you know, and we're gonna see the Model Penal Code creates its own version of this. Uh, some of typical heat of passion instructions might be something like such a passion as would naturally be aroused in the mind of an ordinarily reasonable person under the given facts and circumstances. Um, or so disturbed or obscured by some passion to such an extent as would render ordinary men of average disposition liable to act rashly or without due deliberation and reflection, and from his passion rather than from judgment. OK, so these are various ways in which the defense is styled in different statutes. Of course you have the modern model penal code, uh, which doesn't use the term heat of passion, but instead use the term extreme emotional distress, OK? And, um, what you, what you want to look at is in the back of your text, uh, section 210, it's in the criminal homicide statute itself, OK, Section 210 at the back of your, Uh, book, you're actually looking under the section 210.3 on on manslaughter, where the, where the code defines, uh, uh, a crime, a homicide, so it places in that category. of manslaughter. Any homicide, which would otherwise be murder. OK. So you could, I mean, so if we didn't have this defense, right, Mr. Gerard would be convicted, well, was convicted, but would be convicted of intentional homicide. He intentionally killed his wife. It wasn't, it wasn't an accident, it wasn't recklessness, he stabbed his wife to death. That's an intentional homicide, right? So it would ordinarily be a murder. It would otherwise be a murder. But it doesn't fall in the murder category and it drops to the manslaughter category if it is committed under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance for which there is a reasonable explanation or excuse. OK. And then, it says, the reasonableness of such explanation or excuse shall be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the actor's situation under the circumstances as he believes them to be. All right? OK. Now, so what's clear under the Model Penal Code and say New York penal law because the New York State adopted this section of the Model Penal Code, as did a few other states verbatim. Is that you need essentially two things to prove extreme emotional disturbance. Um, in New York State it becomes an affirmative defense, which means that the defense has to prove this. So these would be elements, these would be elements that it's not the prosecution that needs to prove this, but it's the defense that needs to prove this as an affirmative defense, OK, and the affirmative defense, the defendant would have to prove two elements. OK, the first element is that there is extreme emotional disturbance, so that the, the individual was kind of subjectively suffering from extreme emotional disturbance, and then second, uh, that that extreme emotional disturbance had a reasonable explanation or excuse. And those would be the two requirements. Two elements that you would have to prove. OK, now. Um, Let's, uh. OK, now. One of the, one of the ways to understand all of these cases, actually. is to think of them along. Two different dimensions. OK. 11 dimension and so if you, if you wanted to kind of like analyze the law of voluntary manslaughter. One dimension is whether or not the. Rule. About the, the category is a categorical rule or some kind of standard. OK. Um, how would you? We're still, we're still being judges here, Scar Scarlett, how would you define the. Um Ruling. In Girouard. That Uh, words alone are not enough. Along the spectrum of, is that a categorical rule or a standard?

SPEAKER 7
Um, I mean, I guess. I would think of it more as a. Um, I mean, sorry, I was thinking about subjective versus objective first, um, but I would say it's because it's definitely more of an objective approach, um, but I guess I would say categorical because it's just, you know, it's kind of a black and white thing like rule or words are not enough, you need more than that. So, yeah, I think that's right.

I think it's a pretty, it's a, it's a, yeah, it's a categorical rule, right? It's a categorical rule, um. Um, because all you have to know is whether, uh, there was anything more than words. It's about as categorical rule-ish, I think, as you can get, pretty much, um. Now, what were you thinking about subjective and objective?

SPEAKER 7
I mean, again, it's kind of a similar, uh, explanation, I guess, but just that it's pretty black and white. It needs to be objective that, that the words, well, first of all, it's in the language to inflame the passion of a reasonable man. So that is kind of an objective standard and then.

SPEAKER 0
OK, so that's, OK, so this is interesting. So, um. So I think you're, I think you're smooshing a little bit two questions, but that you're right with your outcome. But in a way, so I think, I think you're, you're thinking on the, you're thinking, you're reading, you're thinking that the case itself. And the holding itself has this reasonable person standard in it. And therefore is kind of on the objective side of the spectrum. Um, I'm not sure that it's from the fact that words alone aren't adequate. I'm not sure, I'm not sure how I would place that attribute of the case along a subjective objective, but I think you're right that the case itself, the language of the case, speaks in terms of an objective standard. So for instance, I think you're right that you say, when you say, you know, this is page 463, whatever, it's about halfway for provocation to be adequate. It must be calculated to inflame the passion of a reasonable man. Intend to cause him to act for the moment from passion rather than reason. The uh. The, so all of this is about the reasonable person standard, which obviously is the objective standard, right? So I think you're right that the case itself is all about reason, reasonable, and so the case itself would fit in the kind of top right quadrant of the kind of of a categorical and objective, um, um. Uh, form of heat of passion defense, OK. Uh, what about, what about, what about, uh, let's, let's try and map these other two cases then for a second, Mayor versus people and, and then Casasas, um, and Sophie. Um, what do you, what do you, uh, tell me a little bit about Mayor quickly.

SPEAKER 1
Yes, so, um, Mayor was charged with, um, assault with intent to kill and murder. And, uh, so it looks like he was following his wife and her alleged lover into the woods, um, and

SPEAKER 0
yeah, they were going into the woods. I don't think he followed them into the woods.

SPEAKER 1
He didn't follow them into the woods. He just followed them, I guess, maybe to like the entrance of the woods in my mind. Um, saw them exiting the woods and saw the lover entering a saloon, and as he's following this lover to the saloon, one of the defendant's friends tells him that they are his wife is having an affair with said lover. Um, he enters the saloon and he shoots him, inflicting a non-fatal wound in and through the left ear.

SPEAKER 0
Yes, precisely. So it's not a, it's not a homicide case. It's an attempted homicide case. Um, we'll deal with attempt later. We'll, let's pretend we, we can treat it as if it were a homicide case, OK? It's actually the person is actually charged with, uh, assault with intent to kill and murder, assault with intent to kill and murder, which is a. Which is actually different than attempted murder, but. It's an assault. It's a kind of a high category assault, OK? All right. And, um, and so, um, what does the, what does the court, uh, say about like how to think about, um. Heat of passion in the state of Michigan in 1862. You notice it's also a bench trial, but what kind of standard do they adopt there, would you say? They, what kind of, is it, is it a categorical standard ultimately or what, what, what, what, what, uh, what definition of heat of passion do they give?

SPEAKER 1
Um, it seems it's more of a standard than a categorical approach. They spent a lot of time discussing how like a jury is better suited to handle this because there's a lot of fact finding to do and there might be a, it's more of a case by case basis.

SPEAKER 0
OK, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's kind of like we can't decide these things as a categorical. Uh, question, it's just all these cases are too different from each other and juries have to decide, right? Um. In a sense, uh, you, uh, so that's the language, for instance, in the. Third to last paragraph, you know, the court should, I think. Uh, or, or, no, scarcely the paragraph that starts with the judge, it is true. Must to some extent assume to decide upon the sufficiency of the alleged provocation at the end of that paragraph, right? That's the language I think you're referring to. Scarcely two cases can be found which are identical in all their circumstances. There's no reason to hope for greater uniformity in the future. Provocations will be given without reference to any previous model. Passions they excite will not consult the precedents, right? So this is human behavior, and human behavior is going to be different in all these different cases. So what the court says essentially is, I take it, you know, we can decide. In gross terms, whether the heat of passion defense goes to the jury. But then we're not going to give them kind of these categories. We're not going to tell them that it's limited to. You know what it was limited to in Girouard. We're not going to tell the jury you can only find heat of passion if there was an assault or if the person discovered their spouse engaged in adultery. OK, we're not, we're not going to tell the jury you have to fit in these boxes. We're just going to tell the jury. You know, it's, it's up to you to decide basically what an ordinary human being would do. Right? So that very much seems like a, like a standard. OK. Correct. Now what about um on the objective, subjective uh uh dimension.

SPEAKER 1
Um, I think there's like two angles to that. I think to Scarlett, to echo Scarlett's point, um, of the rule itself, like it is a reasonable person standard, so it's not necessarily the, um, the, I guess like the subjective intent of that particular defendant, but at the same time, there's a subjective element to it in regards to the jury deciding whether or not it is, um, whether or not the heat of passion defense applies in the case.

SPEAKER 0
And is there anything particularly kind of Subjective sounding language that you found in when you were reading the case.

SPEAKER 1
Sorry, do you mind repeating?

SPEAKER 0
I think, so, I think you're right. And I think, so I think you're right that on the one hand, It's a reasonable person standard, right, but as you were saying, on the other hand, it's, it feels as if it's somewhat subjectively tailored to the individual person, and I think that you get that sense in the like six lines from the end of the case where the court basically says look. You would need to consider the excitement, the great perspiration exhibited on entering the saloon, the hasty manner in which he approached and fired the pistol at Hunt. Right, so, and so, those are all, those all seem to be in a way, things about Mr. Mayor. Right? He was sweating and perspiring. Um, And he was hasty, and the way he went into the saloon. In a way, those seem very tailored to his subjective behavior. And so it starts to feel as if even though it's an objective standard with the reasonable person, right, it also seems to carry a lot of his personal behavior and being. So for instance, One way to use, 11 way to give me a reasonable person standard would simply be to say, No reasonable person is going to Shoot, try to engage in homicide of that. Paramour, if all they have is a suspicion. That they're engaged in adultery. Right? That's not reasonable. No reasonable person would do that. I mean, even if, for instance, if it's in flagrant delecti, even if, even if it would be OK for a reasonable person to shoot the paramour if he saw them engaged in adultery. It's not reasonable for anyone to do that if they are just suspicious. OK. You, that's too much. That's not reasonable, right? We're gonna, we're gonna cabin this. We could have a Here it's not a category, it's a standard, but we could have a category, say, and then say simply. That's outside of that category is not reasonable. And that would be one way of going with the objective standard. Here, however, there, the, the court is really kind of looking at the individual behaviors of the person to try and figure out, it almost seems as if it's trying to figure out whether he was really in a heat of passion or not, right? And the, and the reasonableness, it's an objective standard, but it's kind of tailored to, to him. OK. All right. And then our third case, Casasa, uh, Claire. Can you tell us quickly about the facts of that case?

SPEAKER 2
Yeah, the defendant was dating a woman, um, and then she rejected him and he like stabbed her and killed her.

SPEAKER 0
Yes, yes, um. And in that case, uh, now we're operating under the new, we're in New York. Uh, we're operating under the NYPL New York Penal Law Section 125251A. Um, which is the same language as the Model Penal Code. It was adopted verbatim from the Model Penal Code. Um, it's a bench, uh, trial again. Um So the trial court is making the decisions here. Do you get a sense on this one that we have a categorical approach or more of a standard, more of a rule or more of a standard?

SPEAKER 2
I think standard because they talk about how the provocation was so unique to him and his own circumstances that an ordinary person would not have done what he did.

SPEAKER 0
OK, yes, I think you're, I think you're right. I think that, I think that, um. Uh, the language of the extreme emotional disturbance, um, is they, they specifically say that it's kind of like it's intended to be broader than the heat of passion, right? It's intended to be broader than just those old categories. It's intended to really just let the jury decide if, if, if they, if the person is. Experiencing extreme emotional disturbance whether or not um you know, they were, whether the behavior was a result of that. So it is very much of a standard you hear it very well for instance where the court says in the um. On the second page, basically, um, you should be around 480 or 454. The extreme emotional disturbance defense is an outgrowth of the heat of passion defense, but the new formulation is significantly broader in scope than the heat of passion doctrine which it replaced. Right, uh, existence of a cooling off, it, it, it, it doesn't require all of these things. It does, it's not specifically, it's not specifically saying that it has to be really heat of passion. There doesn't have to be a cooling off period to, to annul it. It's an action influenced by extreme emotional disturbance. It's not one that is necessarily so spontaneously undertaken, rather, A significant mental trauma has affected the defendant's mind for a substantial period of time, simmering in the unknowing conscious and then inexplicably coming to the fore. OK? Alright, so yeah, that's much more of a, that's much more of a rule. Anything where there is kind of extreme emotional disturbance, it's much more of a psychiatric, it's much more of a psychoanalytic definition of what we're dealing with here, right? OK, and, um, uh, last but not least, Juliana, uh, do you get a sense that this is a, um, subjective or objective standard that's being used here?

SPEAKER 1
Um, I, I think it's some degree of both. So with the MPC test, the first prong that the defendant must have acted under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance, um, I think is more subjective.

SPEAKER 0
That is a subjective requirement in the sense that that person has to have been acting in a manner experiencing extreme emotional disturbance. That's entirely correct. That's entirely subjective. You're not saying. You're not saying, would somebody in this situation have been experiencing emotional distress? No, we're saying, did the defendant, did the defendant experience emotional distress? That is a very subjective standard. Yes. And 2, and then for the second prong, uh, which

SPEAKER 1
is that there must have been a reasonable explanation or excuse for such extreme emotional disturbance, um, that's more objective in the sense that reasonableness is determined from the. Uh Defendant's perspective, was there a reasonable explanation or excuse?

SPEAKER 0
OK, so there is where the reasonableness standard comes in. There is where the objective reasonableness standard comes in. OK. Now, um. Now, uh, Let's see, Ashley. Hi. Uh, you're a defense counsel with Sarah and Alexander. Where do you want to push this standard? In the Casasas case, your defense counsel. You just heard it's a reasonable, it's an objective standard. It's an objective standard. What do you want to be doing? As defense counsel Do you agree or do you disagree? Don't forget to scream. And turn on your microphone. Your Honor. That's wrong. No, that's right. What is it?

SPEAKER 2
Disagree.

SPEAKER 0
Damn right you disagree. Why do you disagree?

SPEAKER 2
Um. Maybe I have to, you have to consider like my particular state of mind.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah, why?

SPEAKER 2
Uh, because I'm the one experiencing the extreme emotional distress.

SPEAKER 0
Well, I mean, all right, so. What's your name? I'm sorry. Next, no, yes, Peter, sorry, Peter, um, you're, you're a prosecutor, obviously, so how do you respond to that? Uh, well, I would respond that, uh. To be experiencing extreme emotional distress has to come from

SPEAKER 2
a reasonable point of view, or otherwise anyone could say

SPEAKER 0
they no, your, no, your response is, no, your response is, yeah, sure, sure, Ashley. He has to have extreme emotional distress. I'm fine with that. I'm fine with that. He's got to have that. That's fine. But the standard is it's got to be reasonable, right? That's what the language says, it's got to be reasonable. What does the language say? Uh, What does the language say? There must have been a reasonable explanation. Yeah, there's gotta be a reasonable explanation or excuse. It's a reasonable standard, so it's a reasonable person's standard, right? Sarah, Ashley, Sarah, what do you say? Isn't that reasonableness?

SPEAKER 2
Um, I guess the reasonableness should be determined from my point of view.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah, why?

SPEAKER 2
Uh. Because I'm the one like suffering the, the mental anguish.

SPEAKER 0
That's, that's true, but I think that the answer why it's because of the words, right?

SPEAKER 2
What are the words under the circumstances as he believes them to be.

SPEAKER 0
Yes, under the circumstances as he believes them to be. This is, this is, this is the most subjective, objective standard you could ever have. In the world, in fact, it's not an objective standard, it's a subjective standard, right? It's not what the reasonable person believes, it's what. This person. Believed. And we think, you know, it's gotta be reasonable, but it's, it's from his viewpoint, it's from his situation, it's under the circumstances as he believes them to be. And how does that, and how does that help your client, Alexander or Sarah, did I skip you? Come on, Sarah, how does that help your client? What did, what did he believe?

SPEAKER 1
Um, he believed that, uh, she was essentially cheating on him and rejecting him, which prompted the mental anguish.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah, I mean, he was suffering from extreme emotional distress because of his Psychotic beliefs. of being spurned and fueled by his psychotic behavior of breaking into the, you know, breaking into the apartment downstairs and listening to what was going on upstairs, and so he's he's, he's he's suffering from emotional. Disturbance here, extreme emotional disturbance, and, and, and we need to figure out, you know, what does he believe these circumstances to be. He believes, he believes that um, He is being Uh, That he's being hurt and. You know, you've got the testimony of a psychiatrist here, right? So the words are about as subjective as you can get. William, how do you respond as a prosecutor?

SPEAKER 8
Well, um, I know it's, it's subjective in that sense, but we are still imposing some sort of reasonableness requirement. I think. Is this the case where we have a countervailing opinion from a different psychiatrist? Yes, you do, of course. Yeah, so I mean we have evidence that There is still a reasonableness requirement, and it's not necessarily reasonable even if, you know, he's a little out there um for him to go murdering a woman with a steak knife.

SPEAKER 0
Right, right, right, right. OK, yeah. So what you're doing right now is you are in a sense kind of pulling the case back and forth on the dimension of objectivity and subjectivity, OK? Of uh, of whether it's a subjective standard, what was going on in his mental state or whether it's an objective standard about what we would expect from a reasonable person, OK? Now you have to realize that um. There's a spectrum on this. It's not just is it objective or is it subjective. There's a whole spectrum. Kind of, of what it can be, right? And in fact, um, There are lots of ways in which it could be. Totally objective. Or totally subjective, and in between, you can slice the salami pretty thin and figure out, wait, it's a little bit more subjective, a little bit more subjective, you're getting somewhere in the middle. Now, here, we've got ah the language, um, The language You know, I mean, the most subjective would be something like if he, OK, he has an emotional disturbance, he has EED element number 1, element number 2, that he sincerely believes, ah. That he's, that he's right, that he's no, no reasonable person standard at all, just what he sincerely believes, right? At the other extreme, it's just the pure reasonable person standard, and in between you've got a lot of different standards, OK, um, man, the manslaughter, the MPC manslaughter is pretty subjective as objective standards go. OK, um, uh, because of this business about the circumstances as he believes them to be, right? Um, you could say. We're going to see in the self-defense context, in the Model Penal Code self-defense context, it's a subjective standard, but the belief has to be non-negligently and non recklessly formed, right? That's, that's in a way that's even more subjective, right, than, than the EED. So you could have something that's even more subjective, but you could have things that are much more objective. Believes and the belief is reasonable and the reasonable standard, you know. Uh, uh, believes and the belief is reasonable. Believes and the belief is reasonable. It could be either like a little bit more, uh, subjective or objective depending on how you push and pull these things. Now, and what of course what you would be doing as a lawyer is trying to push the case in one direction or the other, OK? And in this case, in the Casas' case, um. You know, uh, this is, for instance, in the Mayor case, this is where all that language about, you know, he was perspiring, that seems, that seems as if it's pushing us in his situation, right? That seems more subjective. And in the Casas' case as well, you can see the court kind of struggling with the both the subjective and the objective standard and trying to figure out how to resolve it now. The court in Casasas does this strange thing at the end in the um penultimate paragraph in the last few sentences of the penultimate paragraph where it says that basically you have to conclude that the murder in this case was the result of defendant's malevolence rather than an understandable human response deserving of mercy, right, malevolence. I mean. That's a kind of a strange way to try and parse these uh this notion of a reasonable person, right? Um, notions of malevolence, it seems as if that's, that's kind of pushing us in the direction of moral, some, some moral claim about blameworthiness, right? I think that that's wrong. But I'm not the judge. I mean, it's obvious it was right, you know, it's right in New York, uh, according to this judge. I think that's wrong because that's not what we're getting at here. We're not trying to figure out if the person was malevolent or malicious, right? Um, even though, uh, in some states it's gonna be whether there's malice aforethought. Because malice aforethought is the way we think about murder, whereas for manslaughter there's gotta be no malice aforethought, but malevolence, maliciousness, I don't think that's it. It's something it seems to me that the real test is to try and understand what it means, right? What it means to talk about the circumstances as he believes them to be. Now you'll notice that in New York State, what the court basically says. Uh, this is the New York Court of Appeals, so our highest court basically says, look, leave it to the jury. OK. Leave it to the jury, um, uh. So, This is the uh 4th paragraph from the, from the bottom. It's all about the objective standard, whether the objective standard goes, and at the end of that paragraph, this is, however, this, however, appears to have been the intent of the draftsman. The purpose was explicitly to give full scope to what amounts to a plea in mitigation based upon a mental or emotional trauma, significant dimensions which the jury ask to show whatever empathy it can. If you look at the comment. To the Model Penal Code, which is on page 502 of the 11th edition, 485 of the 10th, 459 of the 9th. It's clear that basically, and this is I would say. Totally outrageous. Totally outrageous. What the drafters essentially did was to use terms that are quote unquote designedly ambiguous. What do you think about that for drafting laws? Oh. But anyway, they can do whatever they want. Um, So the word situation is designedly ambiguous. That's not what we want Congress to do, right, to draft legislation that's designedly ambiguous. And it says on the one hand, it's clear that personal handicaps and some external circumstances must be taken into account. Thus, blindness, shock from traumatic injury, extreme grief are all easily read into the term situation, for it would be morally obtuse to appraise a crime for mitigation of punishment without reference to these factors. On the other hand, it is equally plain that idiosyncratic moral values are not part of the actor's situation. OK. You go further down. Thus there will be room for interpretation of the word situation, and that is precisely the flexibility desired. In the end, the question is whether the actor's loss of self-control can be understood in terms that arouse sympathy in the ordinary citizen. Section 2103 faces this issue squarely. And leaves the ultimate judgment of the ordinary citizen and the function of a juror assigned to resolve the specific case, OK. All right, so basically I think what the, what the, so the Model Penal Code drafters. wrote this language. So that you couldn't understand it. OK. And if you don't understand it, They've succeeded, right? Um, Now, I think that what they are doing ultimately. Is Trying to parse. What kind of facts the jury should consider and what kind of facts the jury shouldn't consider under a uh. Under the standard that applies in that state, all right, I, I would say that if I had to analyze the situation. Think about what's going on. They're actually trying to figure out which facts can be considered and which facts can't be considered. Now, I don't think that they do this explicitly. Um, and I don't, and I've never seen a court actually do this. But I think this is what they're trying to do. They're trying to weed out certain things that can be considered and that can't be considered, and I think you'll see it, we'll see it again where, wherever this reasonableness spectrum comes into place, we're gonna see it again, OK? Um, I think that what the courts are trying to do is to say, for instance, OK, uh, there are certain facts that that can be considered and there's certain facts that can't be considered. So for instance, um, You know, for instance, at the bottom, political extremist beliefs. I mean, There was a mention in here, you know, you can't consider political, political beliefs or something like that. Well, you know, if it's a subjective standard, you can. Right, there's no, I mean, if it's just a question of whether or not this person was. Extremely emotionally disturbed you could I mean, you know, uh, it's uh January 6th, um, um, a protester, uh, would have a defense maybe under extreme emotional disturbance if it's purely subjective, right? And you can't say, well, look, you got your political opinion, you got these political opinions that are, you know, off the wall, and we're not gonna let a jury consider that as a defense, say. That's what you would get maybe if you had a more objective standard maybe under the model penal code you could say no you can't consider those extremist political views if you have a subjectivist, yes you do or for instance, um, homosexual advance, right, uh, which is a defense in some states uh. You know, in some states, the answer is no, you, that's not, that's not, that's not reasonable to act violently or, uh, or homicidally in response to a, uh, same-sex advance in, in another place in, in other states it might, you know, it might be acceptable, it certainly would be acceptable under a subjective standard, right, if the person argues that they were extremely emotionally disturbed because of that, um, because of that. So my sense is that that's what's really going on here. It's a question of trying to filter out facts that we don't want included in the evaluation. OK, let's see, uh, I think we're almost done with, um, I think we're almost done with, uh, this, uh, manslaughter, but, um, we will, we'll, we'll wrap it up tomorrow morning, um, William, Alexander, etc. We'll wrap it up tomorrow morning and then we'll turn to, uh, felony murder, OK? All right. You're welcome. Thank you. No disturbance. 00, very big difference, very big difference. Um Uh, so, um, uh, insanity is a mental disorder. You have to have a mental disorder. You have to have a diagnosed. And then there's going to be some relationship between that disorder and the conduct and it might be cognitive, it might be control, it might, we're gonna, we'll have a day on all of this. And if you have a mental illness. That caused the behavior, then you're not guilty. Usually. Some states have now adopted guilty but mentally insane. OK, but the way it used to work was you would be not guilty at all. So basically it would pull you down from murder, an intentional murder to no liability.
