SPEAKER 0
It's very full. I could only, I could only reserve 3 seats. Because every other seat was taken.

SPEAKER 1
Hi, sorry, uh, Charles, first I wanna introduce myself. Charles, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Um, I just wanted to inform you that I actually have an interview at noon, so I was wondering if it would be alright just like a couple minutes before class I'll have the hell out. Of course, thank you very much.

SPEAKER 0
Hm. Hey Good, how are you doing? Good to see you. Good to see you. How are you doing? Good to see you. So, um, I could only reserve 3 seats because we have 125 students. So I hope that's all right, and I figured one of you might be in class or something, so. On Tuesdays All right. Um, I'll introduce you guys, and then I don't know if we can meet this afternoon or if not this afternoon, sometime this week. Ricardo will figure something out. All right, so we'll figure it out. We'll figure it out. All right, thanks. Um Oh All right, everyone. Welcome To criminal law. Welcome back to, well, you were here last week, right? Yeah, alright, so forget it. um, you can welcome me back to Columbia if you'd like. All right, no, um, so, uh, we are going to be studying the criminal law in this, uh, in this class, in this semester. Um, I'm Bernard Harcourt, your professor. Uh, and you have the great privilege and um. Honor to have 4 extraordinary TAs with us as well. For it in the back and let me just quickly, uh, and maybe you can rise when I call your name, Dana. Hi, Dana and Maher. And Courtney. And Amitov. All right. So, um, they will be working with you and assisting in every way they can and running TA sessions, etc. And so, um, thank you, uh, for joining us this year. So, of all of your kind of foundational courses in your first year of law studies. Civil procedure, contracts. Towards. Property, etc. Criminal law is the most consequent. Because it's the domain where politics and morality are at the same time. Completely hidden. OK. Naturalized, rendered invisible. But at the same time, exert extraordinary influence. And in truth shape. The social order that we live in today in this country. We all know, of course, how property law establishes ownership over the economic tools of enrichment. Historically, property law has been the basis of feudal orders. Today in this country, it's the foundation of a capitalist, an exploitative capitalist system. That creates huge inequality in our society and growing inequality based on property law, which you study in property law. And we also all recognize that contract law. So often serves the interests of those with greater economic clout. And expensive lawyers, right? How for instance consumer protection laws which arose in the 1960s to protect persons without any bargaining power and have functioned as a check on state commercial codes and contracts laws and then how they gradually got eviscerated over time. Uh, and mostly only apply in states like California and Massachusetts today. We know, we understand all of this well, we're familiar. I mean, it's clear, it's obvious, it's obvious how property law is going to shape. Modes of production and ownership and inequality in a in a in a country like ours. But by contrast, we really tend to overlook the way in which criminal law, right? Shapes the social order. In this country Um, now, uh, we do so because we tend to think that criminal law is just a response to crime. Right, we tend to think that this is just, OK, well there are bad acts, and so we have the criminal law to deal with those bad acts, and everybody agrees that those are bad acts, so the criminal law just takes care of that. Right? In a way, everything gets naturalized because we tend to think that the criminal law is really all about crime. And that punishment. is tied to crime and crime is tied to punishment. Right, that there's some relationship that, that, that we, what we, we use the criminal justice system. To just punish bad actors who've committed crimes. And that seems Normal, right? That's just actually that's. Liberal political theory, which is the foundation of our system of government. But what we fail to understand is that really it turns out. That there's a disjuncture between crime and punishment. And that in fact, our punishment systems in this country. Historically and still today. Do something very different than simply. Respond to crime. They structure our society. They, they create relations of power. That then kind of infuse our society with the hierarchies that exist today. Relations of power along lines of race, along lines of gender, along lines of wealth and poverty and class. Now A few years ago. We started to get a sense of this in the United States. In American discourse in American political life. Uh, during the Black Lives Matter movement. Um, there was a growing awareness actually that maybe the criminal law was doing more than just. Responding to crime. Um, we got an idea that there might be something like systemic racism. That influences the criminal justice system and more broadly American society. And um There was a whole kind of conversation in this country that revolved around that. Uh, and there were reflections on abolition. There were discussions of abolition. Discussions of transforming the criminal law basically and law enforcement. Um, And that discussion kind of highlighted some places where we began to think that maybe what's going on in the criminal law is slightly different than what we expected. Or what the theory was. Now As you know, Those discussions have somewhat kind of uh evaporated in the American imagination um over the course of the last 6 years. Um, but I think that they helped us see insights, uh, that you are going to be confronted with. Very much in this course. Because they are hidden. Um, And so to try and get a sense of how it is that The criminal law shapes our society. It's helpful to go back in history. Um, particularly to go back to the reconstruction era, uh, following the Civil War. To take a step back. And to unearth how it is that the criminal law served to create, entrench, and replicate mechanisms of power. And here it's really helpful to go back to someone like WEB Du Bois's great work, um, Black Reconstruction in America, published in 1935. Because he really put his finger on kind of a process. That took place during Reconstruction. And that fundamentally kind of transformed American society. And it had to do with the way in which The criminal law replaced property law. As the mechanism to impose a racial hierarchy. In this country. So you could kind of think that what happened is. You took your property course class. And you just switch and, you know, you switch from JGH 107 to JGH 101. OK. Um This is here, an advertisement. For the sale. Of a person Uh, an advertisement in 1866, in December of 1866. So no, the Civil War is over. Um, the 13th Amendment. Is ratified a year earlier. There is no Longer slavery in this country. That whole property relationship. Has been ended, right? So we're not in the property domain anymore. People are not chattel slavery. And yet You have functionally the same process going on. This was a public sale for an African American man, Richard Harris. Who's Labor was being sold. Because he had been convicted of a crime. Right? And so what we have here is the reconstitution of a social order. A racial order by means of the criminal law. Given that property law can't do that work anymore. Right? And it operates through this idea that well, crime is just, it's bad. Right? We can. Raise your hand if you don't think crime is bad. Right? Crime is bad. We don't want crime. Who's in favor of crime? OK, I'll admit it. Anybody else? No. OK. But I was like, right, we can all agree to that. So if someone has committed a crime, You know, we can punish them. And if they have committed a crime, actually, And they're in prison, they're not covered by the 13th Amendment. Right Slave You know your 13th Amendment, right? There's an exception. To the abolition of slavery. For people who are convicted of crimes. Check your 13th Amendment. It's, it's in there. Who can read it for me? Who's got it right in front of them? Did you just pick it up? You wanna read it? I Uh, neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States or any place subject to their jurisdiction. Slavery is unconstitutional. Except. If you've been convicted of a crime. Wow Now, that's how this functions then, right? So basically we replace the property relations by the criminal law. And um it was, it was actually a very deliberate thing that was happening. If you look at the 1905 um constitutional debates at the Alabama uh constituent Assembly when they were passing the, the Alabama Constitution of 1905. The uh Legislators, the, the people assembled there, explicitly said, look, we want white supremacy, so in order to get white supremacy, we are going to add these crimes to the felon disenfranchisement list, OK, because these are the crimes that we think. African Americans are more likely to commit or that we can Kind of disproportionately convict African Americans, so we will reduce their uh participation in terms of the voting uh rights. Felon, it's called felon disenfranchisement. If you're interested, there's the United States Supreme Court case which actually struck down, uh, it's, it's, it's, it's an older case. Don't know if they would necessarily do that today. But they struck it down. Hunt I think it's called Hunter. I'll send it out to you guys, where they actually have the language from the Constitutional convention where the People were kind of like deciding what would lead to disenfranchisement and choosing particular crimes in order to reduce the American uh African-American vote. Now, the criminal, now this was, this was called convict leasing, OK, and so basically what it meant was If you were a convict, you could be sold, your labor could be sold, and you would just, you know, you'd be back in the cotton field as a convict, OK? Um, it led to essentially, ah, a whole set of institutions, um, in the south and elsewhere. That functionally reproduced the plantation. Through the prison and incarceral system. OK. Um, this is a gang of juveniles who were convict leased in 1903. Uh, and actually, um, The, in in uh in Louisiana today, there still is a plantation prison. This is the biggest prison in uh Louisiana. It's called Angola. Other people refer to it as the farm. If you're interested, there's an incredible documentary called The Farm about Angola Prison. It is 28 square miles, OK? This prison is 28 square miles. That's a lot of miles. What's Manhattan? I don't even know Someone could tell me in a minute. How many square miles is Manhattan? How many? 2.8 22.8. OK, so bigger than Manhattan. is a farm in Louisiana. Called Angola Prison. Where persons who are incarcerated there. are working the fields. So it's, it's a, it's a functioning agricultural, kind of, it's a, it's a, it's a plantation, OK? It's a former plantation and a and a present plantation. Um So you have all of these mechanisms and institutions and practices whereby, as WEB Du Bois had written in Black Reconstruction, The whole criminal system came to be used as a method of keeping Negroes at work and intimidating them. Consequently, there began to be a demand for jails and penitentiaries beyond the natural demand due to the rise of crime. Now, this, of course, this was written in 1935. It was looking at practices that were instituted uh from Reconstruction on. But these patterns continue uh today and reach into the present. These are pictures from California today, um, well, 2008. It's from the Plata. It was the constitutional challenge to overcrowding in prisons in Plata. California. Um, these were some of the pictures, actually, uh, in a rare. Moment the Supreme Court included pictures of these overcrowdings in um in their judicial opinion. Um, so, some of these are actually in the, in the reporters. Um, but this is a, you know, a day room, uh, a gym transformed into a prison, basically. It used to be a gym, got overcrowded, so they started, you know, bunking and then double bunking people. This is a triple bunk gym, basically, uh, in another prison. And um Uh, what we experience in the United States. Starting in 1973, OK, was in a way, a turn to the Criminal law again to regulate society. OK. Starting in 1973. We began an exponential increase in incarceration in this country, exponential. OK. It has plateaued. Now, since about 2010. But from the period 1973 to about 2008, This country was simply on a exponential increase in the prison and jail populations. OK. Speaking about how kind of the criminal law is used to. Create a social order. This was a deliberate decision. I mean, it's somewhat remarkable. You usually don't see exponential lines like this, except in kind of natural phenomena, maybe cell reproduction, cancer cell reproduction, or kind of, you know. Bio biology kind of things. This is just, this is just a social policy. This is us. We decided. It's not, it wasn't like cells reproducing, not going crazy or anything. It's like we decided. We are going to start incarcerating. 1% of the adult population. By 2008, we were, we were incarcerating 1% of the adult population in the United States. 2.3 million people. More than like half of Denmark. And Greenland. Right? It's just, I mean, in just. unexplicable numbers of people. We put behind bars and remain there today. So we've got about almost 2 million people behind bars today in this country. 2 million, OK? Now, so, ah, this here, um, Reflects the ah jail population in dark black here, OK. Jails, uh, this is the federal prison population. And then this is the state prison population. OK. And when you put them together, we are somewhere around 2 million people today who are physically incarcerated behind bars. Now, that doesn't include everybody else who's kind of been touched by this criminal justice system. The people who are either on probation instead of being in jail, usually probation. is instead beforehand as an alternative to incarceration or on parole, meaning that they might have served their sentence and they're coming out now, but they're under parole supervision, so they have to check in every week or they might have a bracelet or they might have other restrictions. In the United States today, we're at about somewhere between 6 and 7 million people. Who are kind of undercarceral supervision at this moment. OK. Now, you have to realize, of course, all of these people have partners. Many have children, many have parents, many have brothers and sisters. So when you take this number, 6.5 million, And then you add all the people who are touched by that. Right? I don't know. It's got, I don't know, there's gotta be, there's gotta be an average of how many people are, how many people touch us. I, I don't know what it is. 5 Somewhere between 5 and 10. Yeah, cause we got cousins too, right? 5 and 10, some 5. Let's take 10. I can name 10, you know, I got 2 kids. Partner. Cousins Nephews and nieces. Let's say it's 10. Let's say 1010, 10 people might wanna come visit me. When I get incarcerated. Let's say. All right. OK. So that means we're talking about 65. million people in this country, at least, who are affected by the criminal justice system, right? That's a, that's, that's big, right? It's big, uh. Of course, it's much bigger than other comparable countries. Um, so, America is exceptional in this context, uh, in terms of countries that one might want to compare oneself to, although I'm not sure. Who we want to compare ourselves to right now anymore, but Assuming some of the the OECD countries, for instance, uh, rates of incarceration. Are much lower, so we are exceptional in this sense, and though, um, it gets worse, Uh, because It is also Deeply, uh, racialized. Ageified. And also gendered. In terms of prison populations and incarceral populations, although the numbers of women incarcerated increases and sometimes increases at a disproportionate number. The population tends to be male. The population tends to be Younger African American. Or Hispanic. Men. So, um, And this is a trend that has been continuous over the course of the past century or so. What we have here, for instance, is state and federal prison populations by race. And so what we see is that actually in the 1920s, and this was in part Due to Uh Other institutions, segregation and forms of Jim Crow, uh, that existed at the time. Um, but back in the 1920s, the state and federal prison population was about 2/3 white in this country. And gradually over the course and systematically over the course of the 20th century, it has become 2/3 non-white. OK. Such that the disparities between kind of uh Uh, Black, Latinx, and white populations in terms of their rates of incarceration. are dramatic Today. Uh, so when we talk about incarceration, we generally use numbers per 100,000. OK? That's what, that's what we use. When we were comparing the countries before, that's what we use. It's per 100,000. OK. Um, if you look at the numbers today, basically, At least in 2022, it hasn't changed since then. The imprisonment rate is, you know, 229 per 100,000. So that's essentially kind of 0.2% of the population. If I'm getting it, if I'm not making a mathematical error, I think that's 0.2% of the population, um, behind, uh, bars in state and federal prisons. Um, African American population is 1.2% of the population of the African American population, OK? And this is actually, again. Slightly underestimating things because this is, includes males, females, and includes all ages, right? When you start looking at ah Kind of, um, people. Probability of male incarceration by age 30 to 34, OK. So in other words, here we're just focusing on young men. Alright, then you see kind of the, the disparities kind of accentuate to the point where black men, With no high school diplomas are at a 69% risk for incarceration. OK. Ages 30 to 34. OK. All right. So now, This Is a legacy. Uh, continuity is some, is somehow related to. What WEB Du Bois was talking about. OK. Um, and of course, in, in a way, it's our responsibility. Today. To try and understand how it is that the criminal law does this, how does criminal law enforcement achieve these disparities and create this social order. Right. Now, um, This year we're going to be, you know, we're going to be studying the criminal law. You're going to be getting a lot of cases. You're going to be getting. A lot of Law so that because I want you all to be able to, you know, be able to know perfectly well what's going on in a case, a criminal case. A lot of people are gonna ask you, and I know a lot of you are not gonna be doing criminal law when you grow up. I get it. But I can tell you everybody is going to be asking you to explain this to them, OK? So, your mother, your brother. Everybody is going to be saying, hey. You're a lawyer You know, is there absolute immunity for a federal officer? You gotta be able to answer that, OK? You know, No, there's no absolute immunity for a fellow officer. Well, it doesn't exist. You need to know that, OK, so that's we're going to learn this. But I want you to, as we do it, you have to understand the, the context within which it is all playing out. You might be reading a case that's about. Some self-defense issue, what you need to be thinking about is how does it produce this? Right? How do we get from the cases that we're gonna be studying this year? To these kind of disparities, OK. All right. And the criminal law, I would say, is the mechanism that most innocently. Creates these, these, these, these, these, these social order, the social order that we live in, the social order that we live in, in New York City. OK. Who's getting stopped? Where are the cops? What are they enforcing? How do we get here? OK. Now, There are hypotheses. Uh, Louiscon is a sociologist at Berkeley, and he tries to draw a causal, causal relationship between how slavery might have had historical consequences bringing about Jim Crow in the South. That might have then resulted in migration of African Americans to the north, which then through an evolutionary process and enmeshing of the ghetto and the prison created. Hypo ghettoization and mass incarceration. There are sociological theories, there are historical theories, OK. There are political theories about all of this. Right. And what we're going to be trying to do is kind of develop some legal theories here. Legal theories in the context of the reality of uh. The reality of what's going on today. Because entering a prison or a jail or a courthouse for that matter. Did any of you get down to go watch some arraignments? Yeah. What was it like? Did you do, uh, Center Street?

SPEAKER 2
Uh, I actually used to work there, yeah, so I've been to a lot of trials and arraignments.

SPEAKER 0
Um, what's it like going in the arraignment?

SPEAKER 2
It's, there's a lot going on. Um, typically I went for at least like 1 or 2 cases. Um, It's, it depends on if you're in like criminal court versus supreme Criminal Court. Um, I would say criminal court is a lot more like fast paced and then Supreme Court's a lot more like orderly and, um, tends to be like less cases because it's felonies versus misdemeanors.

SPEAKER 0
Who are the most people who, who are the, can you characterize most of the people who are going through arraignments?

SPEAKER 2
Um I would say, I mean, just in my experience with I, I work for the DA's office, um, I would say a lot of my defendants are, um, what we you characterized as um young black men. So I would say that's who goes through arraignments.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think that's one of the most um striking things about sitting through arraignments is just seeing a kind of constant parade of. Poor, it's kind of almost half seem homeless or destitute. Um, African American predominantly, uh, it's rare, it's rare to see. Some Others, um, young men kind of shuffling through, uh, the arraignments, um. It's um it's a pretty harrowing experience, but I really recommend it. I think it's really important for you to see and to experience and to see what it's like to lawyer, um. And, uh, and I encourage you to work, uh, in the, in the various offices. um, thanks. Um Have any of you been inside of a prison? Done volunteer work or then, yes. Um, where, where were you? I've taught a bunch in prison during my PhD program, which, uh, which facility in Connecticut, so Cheshire, McDougal, and York, which is a women's prison. OK. Do they have, uh, school classrooms or do they do it in the, in the, in the, they do have schools, yes, um, so the classrooms are in an area of the prison that is called a school. OK, OK, yeah. Did you say you've also Yeah, just to visit my

SPEAKER 3
uncle, um, who I live with actually just got out of prison. He served, he's like 16. He was in prison for most of his life, I think his last sentence was like 35 years, so I was, I think it was upstate New York or Connecticut, Green something Prior correctional Green Haven Correctional Facility, yeah.

SPEAKER 0
Thanks, thanks. Who else did I see? Yes. Is it sorry, let me see it's Enuma and not Alexandra. You're Alexandra Audrey Audrey, all right, we'll get you on here and um, is it Cecilia? Yeah, OK. And is it Sarah? Go ahead. Is that working? All right, scream, go for it. You've worked in 2 prisons? With, OK. OK. OK. OK. OK, great. Thank you so much Cecilia. Did I see somebody else? Yes, Doris, is it?

SPEAKER 4
Sorry, hi, um, yeah, I guess a lot of my work has been in jails actually, so like Rikers Island, um, in the Broome County Jail, which is a jail in upstate New York, Greene County, Broome County, Broome County,

SPEAKER 0
yeah, um, and.

SPEAKER 4
Yeah, a lot of my experiences in public defenders' offices, and I ran a jail visitation program upstate, um, and then I was at the Bronx Defenders here, so visiting

SPEAKER 0
clients at Rikers, um, like visiting people or getting property,

SPEAKER 4
um, and then also just like personal visit, um, with somebody who is, um, incarcerated upstate as well. So, OK, anyone else.

SPEAKER 0
3 more, or 4 more, 5 more. Well, we got, OK. Yeah, go ahead. Yes, is it? Hi, yeah, it's Una. Um, I'm from Washington and back in Washington I worked, uh, with an organization that represented, um, immigrants who had been detained in the incarceral system in Washington state so I did a lot of like legal visit stuff out there, um, was that in ICE facilities or no, it was folks who've been convicted of a crime and who are, um, also like have sort of different immigrant statuses, um. So yeah, we were kind of addressing both systems. OK, thanks. Let's see, is it Hannah? No, yes, yes, you, Isabel, Isabelle, OK, go ahead.

SPEAKER 5
Um, I've also done a lot of work in prisons in New York. I was a paralegal doing, um, representing victims of prison abuse, so I've been around, um, but mostly at Sing Sing.

SPEAKER 0
OK, Sing Sing, you said? OK, great. Thanks. All right, well, I'll, and I'll hear from the rest of you, um, as we, as we, as we continue, um. The facilities can be harrowing, uh, as you know, as those of you who've been inside know, as those of you maybe who've who've who've seen images, these. This is a a suicide watch cell actually, um, so this is, this is what you would be uh. Subjected to if you were at risk of depression or suicide, California, these are from the Plata, um. Photographs, um, this is a cell for acutely suicidal patients which basically is stripped of absolutely everything. Um, I kind of feel as if, if one were acutely suicidal, if one weren't beforehand, one would be pretty quickly in a facility like this. These are cages for people who are waiting for mental health treatment. Uh, to see a therapist. This is uh therapy, um, uh, so the therapist is uh having a consultation here with someone who is incarcerated. Um, this is a group therapy. Um, in, uh, In California, in a California facility and um California is a pretty wealthy state that dedicates a lot of resources to its criminal justice system um California is is actually a system that um that does pretty well in terms of the kinds of uh processes and institutions and similarities, uh, that. They put Into uh rehabilitation, etc. um, other states wouldn't even have uh group therapy at all, um, or wouldn't, you know. Allow individuals out of their cells, uh, so. The conditions can be absolutely harrowing, and the consequences of the criminal law can be absolutely harrowing. All right, now, um, This all means, of course, that we We really, when we study the criminal law, we need to understand how all the pieces fit together. What the language is, how you make arguments, right, how you read cases, how it all works in order to try and get the bigger picture. To see what the reality of all of this is like. The building blocks are pretty simple, and we're going to be going through those. We're going to start immediately. We're going to start at a very fast pace. We're going to be jumping in next session into what's called um mens rea actus reus, the, the basic building blocks, the mental state, the act requirements in the criminal law. How you define elements of a crime. You need to, we need to jump into those as quickly as possible and we'll be doing that this week. But it's also important to get a sense of Kind of what we aspire to in terms of justice, um. What justice might mean, um, what it would take, and how we can evaluate. What we're reading against a sense of what we think is justice. And so it's for that reason that I asked you to to spend time over the break reading Just Mercy, um, which I hope you enjoyed, and, uh, found. Productive And what I wanted to do today was to start by discussing the book, but also trying to figure out what you might think is an idea of justice. What is justice, OK? All right, and so, um, I thought that we could start just by talking today about Bryan Stevenson's book. Figuring out what it is that we thought was most compelling, so I asked a couple of questions, maybe we could start the conversation, uh, now. Sylvie, how are you doing? Do you wanna tell me what you thought was kind of the most. Let's start with the unjust because I always find that it's easier to define the unjust than it is to define what justice is. What would you say were some of the moment or what was the moment that you thought was the most unjust in just mercy?

SPEAKER 5
Um, good morning. It's cool to be the first cold call in Crim. Um, you'll remember it all your life. Um, it's hard to pick one moment in Just Mercy, frankly, there were a few times that I felt pretty close to tears. Um, with that said, I think some of Stevenson's descriptions of. The ways that people are put to death in Alabama were quite harrowing. Just the processes themselves of, you know, once you do get through the justice system of how people You know, are, are put to death on their last day, um, specifically in the prologue, there was a kind of botched execution that took, I think it was 15 or 20 minutes that felt clearly unjust to me and the like cruel and unusual punishment comes to mind, um, but even thinking about, um, the case that we track, um, throughout, and I know you were involved, um, just the fact that, um. He was put into uh on death row prior to being convicted feels extremely unjust. So just the way that we treat um those that are accused of a crime prior to conviction, of course there's so much more there and so many steps along the the path of that case that seemed to be, you know, clearly um infused with racial political biases um. And uh it was astonishing, um, but I think those were, those were two of the pieces that I felt particularly stood out to me, um, because if we are to say that we are a society of processes, it feels like the processes were kind of circumvented or, um, like flat out ignored in those instances at the beginning and end.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah, interesting, it's interesting because I mean you've pointed to 11, Event that happens before the determination of guilt, right? So the person is presumed innocent, right? And you're, you're talking about the fact that Walter McMillan was. Detained and placed on death row. During an execution. In pretrial detention. Right, so someone who not only is innocent, it turns out, but is presumed innocent for purposes of the criminal justice system at this point. Being placed on death row. I've never heard of anything like that in my whole life. I mean. That is, that strikes me as so far off the charts that it's, I wouldn't, I would, if someone ever said to me, well, could you be placed on death row before, uh, at a pretrial detention, you know, there's no, there's no way, right? There's no, that can't happen. You can't be placed in prison. So there's a difference between jail and prisons. A jail is pretrial detention, county jail, Rikers Island, those are pretrial detention, right? You can serve short sentences in jail in America, less than a year sentence. You'll often be in a county jail. But you can't go to, you can't go to prison in pretrial detention, and you know. Going to death row. I mean that's that, yeah, you're right. I mean, there's just it's unimaginable. Now it's interesting that the second thing that you raised is something about the execution itself, where someone has been determined to be guilty. Has been sentenced to death. And then what you're saying is, even, even if you have convicted someone and you have sentenced them to death. Then the process of execution somehow has to satisfy some. Something, some process.

SPEAKER 5
It, it feels like the confluence of what you were saying thematically, like this is an intersection of morality and the law, right? There's something that even once the legal processes are complete, that feels unsettled once you reach the point of execution, I guess.

SPEAKER 0
But that goes to all of the idea that if we have an execution system. Then the method has to satisfy the 8th Amendment as well. So we shouldn't have botched executions or we shouldn't use methods that are barbaric or something. Um, and so there's a notion of justice there too in terms of the kind of implementation of the punishment. Or this implementation of punishment, right? I mean something about even if you are guilty, there needs to be some, we need to be able to filter it through some standard um of justice. Um, Aliyah. You were nodding your head. What were you thinking?

SPEAKER 6
Um, I was just kind of thinking about the second question and the notion of like what just mercy means, and kind of when you were speaking, I was thinking about like, just the general dehumanization of people that are incarcerated in general in terms of like, Do they still deserve, like they do still deserve some form of fairness and treatment, and especially when you're speaking of the botched execution and there having to be some form of like painless way to do that or less barbaric way, but yeah.

SPEAKER 0
So dehumanization, so can you. Can you kind of like pull on that or something or stretch it somehow, so is that is that. The form of injustice? Is that a form of injustice, dehumanization? Is it a form of, of justice somehow? How does it, what is, is dehumanization Do you think, for you, is dehumanization kind of the, at the core of these problems that we're identifying possibly as injustices?

SPEAKER 6
Yeah, I think it's a way to like look at people as lesser than so that it's easier to treat them in that manner. Like I think it's more of the notion of injustice.

SPEAKER 0
OK. So then maybe, so on this, if we go down this path, right, the idea would be something like ah Um What is injustice, what, what makes these different things that we might. Identify as unjust is the fact that they dehumanize a person. They, they do not treat a person as a human being worthy of respect in some way. Yeah. That's a very Kantian, that's a very Kantian notion. Um, Kant had this idea that we should treat people like ends and not means. And we should always treat people as an end and not as a means. And in a way, it, it kind of, it, it, uh, it reflects this idea that you should always treat people as human beings. Entitled to respect. I mean, as you'll see, cause we'll study punishment theory, uh, in a couple of weeks, Kant's notion was that. You should never do anything to anyone. In order to achieve some other end. So he was against deterrence, like that we would punish someone severely in order to deter other people in a way that I think that kind of ties closely to your idea that You have to treat someone like a human being. With respect and not use them for some other. End Possibly, maybe. Maybe that ties to the. Execution Um, to the questions of methods of execution. I'm uh deeply involved and you'll, we'll probably talk about this a, a, a lot cause this semester's gonna be hot on this, but I'm, I'm, uh, I am the lawyer challenging Alabama's new method of execution, which is, uh, nitrogen gas executions. So they developed a new method. Where essentially they place a mask on the prisoner and they pump in pure 100% nitrogen gas. Right now we're breathing 80% nitrogen gas and 20% oxygen, nitrogen is an inert gas that actually we're breathing all the time, but it's the 20% oxygen that keeps us going. If you, uh, so basically they, they put a gas mask on someone and push in pure 100% nitrogen. And effectively your body is trying to breathe but not getting any oxygen, and the question in these cases is how long it takes to become unconscious. And there have been 7 executions in Alabama at this 0.1 execution in Louisiana using nitrogen gas, and it looks as if it takes about somewhere between 2 to 44, possibly 7 minutes to become unconscious. And so during that time, uh, the prisoner is basically experiencing what's called air hunger, which is this kind of excruciating feeling that you are not getting oxygen. But you're breathing anyway. Um, so I, um, David Wilson, who you might have read a little bit about because I asked you to start reading about David Wilson, uh, I represent him on his habeas corpus case challenging his death sentence, but he filed a We filed a 1983 civil rights action against the state of Alabama challenging the nitrogen gas process. Um, So that case is, uh, actually right now an act of discovery. Um, so we'll be talking about it. But it raises the question of if you have a method of execution, like how, how, how can it be just? The argument I'm making, or that I will be making or the argument that I plan to emphasize is that if you have a method of execution, it has to be instantaneous. That's the, that's the idea. All of the modern methods of execution. Have been developed because they are instantaneous. Uh Guillotine. Hanging Uh, hanging. is going to get a little bit gruesome on our first. On our first date, sorry, but A properly executed hanging. I snaps your uh Snaps your spinal cord and so you're immediately out. That's why there are kind of weight and height tables about how high and how high it should be depending on your weight and whatnot, because otherwise it's just asphyxiation, which in a way is like nitrogen gas, it's just a form of asphyxiation, strangulation. All right. Um, but, uh, but if you look at all of them, firing squads, uh, even the electric chair was intended to be immediate. Uh, when Thomas Edison was experimenting on elephants and whatnot and the chair was being developed, the idea was that it would be instantaneous death. Uh, so, is there something about that, in fact? Um, it's tricky, right, because you might say, well, maybe the death penalty is not just. In itself Then how do you say that, well, if you have the death penalty, it needs to be instantaneous and not, and not having that would be unjust in some way, right? Um, OK, so there's an idea of, ah, humanity. Are there, so. Can someone, does someone else like what what is at the core, do you think of the. Of your, uh, Nicole. What is at the core of. Is it being treated as a human being? What do you think? What is at the core of your idea of injustice and justice?

SPEAKER 7
Well, I also thought it was interesting how Bryan Stevenson says the opposite of poverty is justice and that we, in terms of building on the dehumanization point that we should measure our character based on how we treat the poor, disfavored, incarcerated, and others. And so just in terms of themes surrounding justice, that if the opposite of poverty is justice and, and just in seeing. That there, there is some element of, of the dehumanization as, as a as a counterpoint to that.

SPEAKER 0
OK, OK. All right. OK, um. OK, so that's, uh, uh, what I like about that is, you know, um, you can measure, there's, there's an expression, you can measure a society by. The strength of its weakest link or something like that. I, I'm not always that great with expressions, but I think it's something like that. Like, you know, you have to look at the, at the place where kind of the, there's the weakest link or there's the most vulnerability or something to see what a society is really like, right? And there, there's, there's something like that. I mean the opposite of poverty is something as if treating people who are most vulnerable. In a prop in a proper way, right? Um. OK. Is that tie particularly to a specific moment in the text that you thought was kind of the greatest injustice in a way?

SPEAKER 7
Oh, I do think. In some ways that it, it ties to the notion of when in talking about the meaning of just mercy and sort of the importance of Stevenson talks about the importance of embracing our own brokenness and that, that creates a need and a desire for mercy and that everyone is more than the worst thing that they've ever done. And so with regard to the McMillan case, we see that ultimately, That he is innocent, that he's, that he had this robust out, and I think part of what the greatest injustice to me was, and was just ignoring the alibi, ignoring those who are potentially seen as disfavored in, in society and And that some witnesses were credited more so than others and that they were, they were overlooking the clear evidence throughout the case and, and coercing, trying to, to get out a conviction as opposed to the true justice of, of seeing what had actually happened in the case.

SPEAKER 0
And what does just mercy mean to you? How do you understand the term just mercy?

SPEAKER 7
So I think it's more so the latter of what you were saying, if, is it simply mercy or is there justice imposed in it? And I think that Towards the end of the book, Stevenson talks about how mercy is just when it is rooted in hopefulness and freely given, and that it's most empowering when directed at the undeserving. And so he, he talks about this sort of at the end is that the power of just mercy is that it belongs to the undeserving and that that is the only way to break the cycle of constant victimization and victimhood that it's not who are the undeserving then

SPEAKER 0
do you think?

SPEAKER 7
I think in this context, he talks about giving individuals a second chance, that our notion of justice can't be rooted in retribution, but rather that the only way to break that cycle of mass incarceration and of continual victimization and victimhood is by giving people a second chance and not boxing people in based on the worst thing that they've ever done.

SPEAKER 0
OK, yeah. Definite and so there are, you know, there are these expressions that, you know, stand out and you just stated one at the end that have become in some sense. Principles or mottos or something, right? Not treating someone based on the worst thing that they've done, right? Um. That goes to the question of vulnerability also, um, and of course to the question of undeserving, undeserving, of course, Walter McMillan deserved mercy because he was innocent, right, um. There are times in which when he's talking about the just mercy at the end there, he's actually talking about Walter McMillan. Kind of granting mercy to the people who prosecuted him improperly in a way, right? Um, Yeah, yeah. OK, um, let's see, um, Ming Ziang? What do you wanna add to the conversation on terms of what your idea of justice might be or injustice?

SPEAKER 8
Right, I was going to talk about the improper prosecution because they um had leveraged other death row um inmates into creating false testimony against an innocent man and I, I feel like. I, I don't know, I was also thinking about Khan a little bit because the idea is that you are prosecuting an innocent person because he is black, because he had an affair with a white woman, you're using his body and his Humanity, his legal rights to life. As a way to communicate, I guess the public anger against, against this person and then I was also thinking about um So there too you're you're using the person

SPEAKER 0
to express kind of racial to to impose a racial hierarchy or to impose racial prejudice or something like that

SPEAKER 8
right? OK, yeah, that's one part, yeah, and also I mean the, the white folks of that town was quite angry with the fact that you know a black person is uh. I guess having a sexual intercourse with a with a white woman and there's bigotry in that and also um I, I was also wondering to what extent should the uh states or, or local prosecution be responsive to, um, I guess. The people directly, um, maybe should there be another layer of insulation between the people and the elected officials and the state's, um, enforcement of its laws, interesting, yeah, OK,

SPEAKER 0
so, um, and that raises interesting questions about the relationship between justice and democracy in a way and representation, um, which is a whole other huge. Issue in criminal justice, um. About whether or not actually it's helpful or hurtful to have criminal justice responding to community pressure, democratic, democratic feeling, etc. because, You know, it's not always clear what the community wants is necessarily. The most just thing, particularly in the case of a heinous crime, which all of these cases involve heinous crimes. Did you, um, did you all have a moment to write down and think about what you think, how you would define justice? Hm Did you all? Yes. Not yet. Some of you, yes. Yes, I mean this is gonna be important because we're gonna be coming back to your definitions of justice. I want you to hold on to the definition of justice. Why don't you at least tell me, um, Maddie. Did you write down a definition of justice?

SPEAKER 9
Um, I did. I kind of struggled with it.

SPEAKER 0
I can imagine, yeah, it's probably the most difficult thing you'll have to do all semester.

SPEAKER 9
Um. I talked to, I, I think I. took from this book sort of the idea of mercy of the undeserving, and I I thought about um. I guess what that looks like, like, I think to your point, it's easy to say for Stevenson, knowing he's innocent, what mercy looks like and what it should look like, and then also from his end, what mercy for the people who treated him so unfairly might look like. But I think. To me, I guess what what Is, uh, a way that this sort of shaped my thinking is thinking about it from, uh, an earlier perspective, what it looks like when you don't know someone's innocent, when maybe, in fact, you know, that they're not innocent. And maybe it should always look the same justice and thinking about what we've talked about in terms of some of these disparities and OK, so something about being treated

SPEAKER 0
equally then or something in the face of uncertainty, being treated equally in the face of uncertainty or something, right? Maybe I think something like that. Charles, before you go quickly, what's yours?

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, I think for me the idea of justice really boils down to just your ability to be heard. I think one of the things that I was particularly interested when I was reading was a story about a lot of the kids and how they were treated in the criminal justice system, particularly in the case of Ian. I think Ian wrote a letter to, uh, Bryan Stevenson and that he talked about how, um, like. He want, he was enjoyed the ability of like being like having his photo taken and he wanted to have a copy of that just so to let the world know that he's still here, right? And I think being able to, uh, even in the face of injustice against you and other people just being able to have your day and be able to say, um, have your story heard or your side of the story heard, I think that is really an integral part of justice.

SPEAKER 0
Ian is a remarkable, uh, man. Uh, he'll join us this semester. Share some of his poetry with us. Uh, he spent 23 years in solitary confinement from the sentenced to life imprisonment without parole at the age of 13. Uh And, um, and yes, uh, there's this, there is this, uh. This You know, he, his. His desire to be heard and to actually One day, um, be respected among us, right? It's something that, um, It was really important to him. All right, so I'm hoping that if you've written down a sentence with a period at the end, which is, uh, a sentence that defines justice, OK? Various points in time I will come back and ask you what that sentence is and whether it relates to the case, OK? So if you haven't done that yet, do that today, OK? Um, it's very hard. I'm in a moment of transition. I'm, I'm starting to change and think that maybe this has something to do with arbitrariness of the exercise of power or something or. Resisting arbitrary forms of power or something. So I don't know, but, um, but I think that this notion of justice is gonna be key for all of your uh case reading, OK? All right, so let me do two quick things before we end today. Um, one, just give you quickly a little bit of a roadmap of, uh, kind of how these cases move, and two, let me give you a little quick roadmap about how this course is gonna work, OK? So just very simply. Right, I gave you this roadmap of how cases move through the system, right, starting with an arraignment. Appearing before a judge, if you've got a felony case, felony misdemeanors versus felonies, we'll talk about that, but felonies go in front of a grand jury. You then have an arraignment. You likely plead not guilty. You have motions practiced, and ultimately a trial. How did that happen in Walter McMillan's case, right? Walter was indicted by a grand jury. OK. He was indicted on a two-count indictment for capital murder. Um, he, the count number one said that he and, uh, Ralph Myers, uh, who you've read a lot about Ralph Myers, who's quite a character, but anyway, uh, that he and Ralph Myers went into the, uh, dry cleaning and killed, um. Uh, a young woman. Um, Rhonda Morrison causing her death during the course of a robbery, essentially, essentially. One indictment, one count of the indictment said that the property belonged to Rick Blair. The other count of the indictment simply said that the property belonged to Rhonda Morrison, but they were basically functional equivalents. It was essentially a robbery, right, and during the course of a robbery, a murder. So murder during the course of a robbery, capital robbery, murder. Um He was then he was arraigned on December 1987. He pleaded not guilty. So basically we're going through the chart. You can kind of go through the chart yourself and see, you know, this is New York, but it's very similar in other states. It would be similar in Alabama. You can see where he's going through at each stage. OK. He pleads not guilty. He then has a motions hearing. He moves to sever his case from Ralph Myers, OK, so he goes all alone. He then moves for a change of venue. He's granted, sometimes you shouldn't ask for things that you that you might get. He gets moved to Baldwin County, which is a predominantly white county. He then goes to trial. He has a sentencing hearing in front of the jury, right? So this would be all of the processes that he's going through. Sentencing in front of the jury that sentences him to life imprisonment without parole. He then has a judge sentencing hearing. Uh, Following that Isn't this working? Work too much. He has a sentencing hearing and the judge, Robert E. Lee Key Jr. sentences him to death on a judicial override. Alabama doesn't have that anymore, but until a few years ago there was a system of judicial override, so you could be sentenced to death despite the fact that the jury gave you, well, in my case, a unanimous life verdict. OK. All right. So his case then. Of course, then you read the book and you know what happens. But if you look in your book and you see this chart, you can follow his case, kind of like where it goes, how it gets investigated, becomes a felony, goes to the grand jury, goes through an arraignment, goes to trial, and then he's convicted, and then what happens afterward. Um, this is kind of a typical chart that gives you an idea of how the system functions, OK? And um We're not going to go over it now, although we will. Soon. Yes, no, hey yay. Uh, we will be going through all the stages, OK, of all the stages of kind of how you get appeals, habeas corpus, etc. and I'll explain all of this to you, and this is going to be the most important chart you'll ever see in your whole entire life, um, and you will, um, be thankful, uh, when you take federal courts, uh, either next year or the year after, and, um, Uh, this will help you understand everything, hopefully, uh, in other classes as well. All right, very quickly, uh, on the syllabus. Which you have in front of you. So, uh, the way we're gonna work this semester. I, uh, we are going to have 3 Friday sessions, OK? Hear me out. 3 Friday sessions. This week, so we're meeting this week, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday. Next week, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, so we're going to get a lot under our belt real early, real quick. And then in February, there's gonna be a Tuesday, Thursday, Friday. All of the other weeks are just gonna be Tuesday, Thursday. Those are 3 makeup classes, which means we're gonna have 2 weeks of spring break. Actually, 2.5, because I have to go give some lectures abroad. So, um, so that just before spring break, there won't be a Thursday, and then after spring break, there won't be a Tuesday and a Thursday. OK? Does that all make sense? OK. Uh, please read the syllabus. I put a lot of stuff in here, um. Uh, about artificial intelligence, which. You shouldn't be using. It's not going to help you. You need to. Develop your mind here so you need to be reading the cases. If you don't understand them, just reread them. If you don't understand them after you reread them, that's fine just come to class and we're gonna talk about them, OK? But um it's not gonna be helpful if you're getting things digested for you. You need to be doing the digestion yourself. Uh, the only other thing I would say that's really important here is um. This is a space of academic exchange and academic freedom. I'm invoking a privilege, it's called the uh Harcourt privilege, which means that uh we can talk about everything and anything and all ideas, good and bad. We're not going to be censored in any way. I'm not going to change the way I teach this class in any way, OK? You can just don't, you wanna be sure you don't trigger other people and you're not offensive, OK? We're gonna avoid that, but We are here to debate things. This world is not pretty, it's really ugly. So there is going to be a lot of ugliness. Trigger warning. Most of these cases are horrible, OK. All right, so, I mean, you know, I mean, it's like, I used to give trigger warnings specifically, I think I kept a few in here, but it's a permanent trigger warning, OK? None of this is, people are getting murdered. Sexually assaulted, it's not pretty, OK. Uh, but obviously. That's what we're studying, OK, but the, uh, academic freedom thing is really important, OK, so nobody should be like, so this what what uh what uh what we do in hard court criminal law stays in hardcore criminal law, OK, no video taping, no complaints about other people, OK. All right, just Be adults and intellectuals, OK, alright. Um. That's it. See you guys on Thursday. Thanks. Hi. Hi. Say it again. Enuma. OK, a few questions about this. Yes, I might be wrong, but I think we all have class during office hours. I'm not. Oh, really? Do you? What, what class? I. Who property is what time? 2:50 to 4:40. OK. On Thursdays, on Thursday?
