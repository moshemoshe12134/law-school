# Audio Prep Style Guide
**For listening before class — ~25-30 minutes spoken**

---

## PURPOSE
- Prepare student for Socratic dialogue
- Conversational tone, listenable at 1.5x-2x speed
- Covers "what you need to know cold" for class participation
- NOT comprehensive reference—that's what class_reference.md is for

## STRUCTURE (Required Sections)

### 1. INTRO (2 minutes)
- Welcome + what we'll cover
- Learning objectives (3-5 bullet points)
- Set expectations: no doctrine yet OR introducing [concept]

### 2. CORE CONTENT (15-20 minutes)
Break into named parts based on class topics:
- PART 1: [Topic Name] (~X minutes)
- PART 2: [Topic Name] (~X minutes)
- etc.

**Within each part:**
- Tell a story or explain concept conversationally
- Use examples, hypotheticals
- Connect to bigger themes
- Avoid jargon unless explaining it
- NO verbatim case briefs (save for class_reference)
- NO MPC section-by-section parsing (save for class_reference)

**Conversation techniques:**
- "Here's the thing..."
- "Now, here's where it gets interesting..."
- "Let me give you an example..."
- "Think about it this way..."
- "Harcourt will likely push on..."
- "Be ready to argue both sides..."

### 3. COLD CALL PREP (2-3 minutes)
- "If Harcourt asks about [X]..."
- Give 3-4 specific questions with answer snippets
- Keep answers conversational, not formal
- Reference what's in class_reference for deeper dive

### 4. CLOSING (1 minute)
- What this class sets up for semester
- Encouragement
- No new content here

---

## VOICE & TONE

**DO:**
- Use second person ("you'll learn," "have this ready")
- Be conversational, like a study partner explaining to you
- Use transition phrases between sections
- Give opinions on what's most important
- Make predictions about what Harcourt will focus on

**DON'T:**
- Be overly formal or academic
- Use "one must consider" — say "you need to understand"
- Lecture like a professor
- Read directly from outlines (transform into narrative)
- Include every detail (this is for listening, not reference)

---

## TIME BUDGETING
- Target spoken word count: ~4,000-5,000 words
- At 150 words/minute speaking = ~27-33 minutes
- Can be listened to at 1.5x-2x speed = ~15-20 minutes

---

## FORMATTING FOR TEXT-TO-SPEECH

**Use section headers with time estimates:**
```markdown
## PART 1: JUST MERCY AND WALTER MCMILLIAN (8 minutes)
```

**Break long sections into sub-headers:**
```markdown
### The Story of Walter McMillian
### What This Case Shows Us
```

**Use conversational formatting:**
- Bold for emphasis (**not** "just")
- No numbered lists within paragraphs (break narrative flow)
- Bullets okay for quick examples
- NO tables (TTS struggles)
- Keep paragraphs short (3-5 sentences max)

**Pronunciation guides if needed:**
- "Harcourt (HAR-court)"
- "McMillian (mak-MILL-ian)"

---

## CONTENT PRINCIPLES

**What goes IN audio prep:**
- Core concepts explained conversationally
- Stories and narratives
- Key cases (facts + holding + why it matters, not every detail)
- MPC provisions (conceptual overview, not word-by-word)
- Policy tensions explained simply
- Cold call prep with answer starters
- Connections to previous/future classes

**What stays OUT (goes in class_reference):**
- Verbatim MPC text
- Detailed case briefs with every element
- Policy/article summaries with extensive quotes
- Hypo banks with 20+ examples
- Balkin dyads (too detailed for audio)
- Extensive footnote-style citations

---

## NAMING CONVENTION
File format: `YYYY-MM-DD_classNN_audio_prep.md`
Example: `2026-01-20_class01_audio_prep.md`

## EXAMPLE OPENING

```markdown
# Audio Prep — Class #2 — Actus Reus
**Audio length: ~28 minutes | Listen before class on Thursday, January 22, 2026**

---

## INTRO (2 minutes)

Welcome back. Today we're diving into actual criminal law doctrine for the first time—actus reus, the act requirement. This is foundational. Every crime has elements, and actus reus is one of them. You can't have a crime without a voluntary act.

By the end of this prep, you'll understand: (1) what counts as a "voluntary act" under the MPC, (2) the three key cases—Martin, Newton, and Decina—and how they test the voluntariness requirement, (3) how omission liability works, and (4) Mark Kelman's time-framing argument from Critical Legal Studies, which shows how manipulable all of this is.

Let's start with the basic question: why do we even require a voluntary act?
