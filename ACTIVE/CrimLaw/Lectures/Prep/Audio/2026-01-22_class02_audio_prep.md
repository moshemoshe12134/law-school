## INTRO (2 minutes)

Today is the first real doctrine class. The topic is “actus reus,” which sounds like Latin fluff, but it’s actually a deep moral claim: the state should not punish you unless you did something that counts as *your* action.

Here’s the punchline you want in your head walking in:

You don’t just need “a bad outcome.” You don’t even just need “a bodily movement.” Criminal liability needs a *voluntary act* (or a legally significant omission), and the entire fight is going to be: what exactly are we calling “the act”?

That last question is the Harcourt move. He’s going to push you to notice that courts can define “the act” narrowly or broadly, and that choice can flip the result.

By the end of this audio, you should be able to do three things out loud:

One: say what the voluntary act requirement is and why we have it.

Two: walk through Martin, Newton, and Decina as three different “stress tests” for voluntariness.

Three: explain omissions using Jones, and tie all of this to the “time-framing” idea from Kelman.

## PART 1: WHAT “ACTUS REUS” IS REALLY DOING (4 minutes)

At a surface level, actus reus is “the act requirement.” But what it’s really doing is separating:

One: things the law wants to punish, because they look like chosen conduct, from

Two: things the law doesn’t want to punish, because punishing them would feel like punishing pure accident, pure bodily malfunction, or pure status.

So when you hear “voluntary act,” think of three justifications you can always reach for in class:

First, deterrence: you can’t deter a reflex or a seizure. Punishment doesn’t change behavior if the behavior wasn’t under control.

Second, retribution/desert: people don’t “deserve” blame for bodily movements that aren’t meaningfully theirs.

Third, legitimacy and limiting principle: without an act requirement, criminal law can become “punish whoever seems dangerous,” which collapses into status policing.

But here’s the twist that makes this Harcourt-friendly: even this limiting principle is *manipulable*.

Courts can often find a voluntary choice earlier in the timeline and treat that earlier choice as “the act,” which lets them punish what looks involuntary in the moment.

That’s the theme of today.

## PART 2: THE MPC FRAME — HOW TO SPOT THE VOLUNTARY ACT (6 minutes)

Your professor cares about MPC close reading. So you want the structure, even if you don’t memorize the exact words.

Think of MPC §2.01 as four moves:

Move one: the baseline rule. No guilt unless your liability is based on conduct that includes a voluntary act — or an omission you were physically capable of preventing.

Move two: the list of “not voluntary acts.” Four categories: reflex/convulsion; movements during unconsciousness or sleep; hypnosis; and a catchall for movements that aren’t the product of effort or determination.

Move three: omissions. You can’t base liability on omission alone unless either the statute makes omission sufficient, or some other law imposes a duty to act.

Move four: possession. Possession counts as an act if you knowingly got the thing, or you were aware of control long enough to terminate possession.

Now, here’s how you use that in a cold call. Your default script is:

Step 1: identify the specific conduct the state is trying to punish.

Step 2: ask, “Is there a bodily movement that’s voluntary?” If not, ask, “Is there an omission with a duty?” If not, ask, “Is there possession that counts as an act?”

Step 3: if the moment looks involuntary, widen the frame and ask, “Is there an earlier voluntary choice that created this risk?”

That last step is basically the Decina move.

## PART 3: THREE VOLUNTARINESS CASES (9 minutes)

### Martin v. State: “You can’t punish what the cops made happen.”

In Martin, the statute punished being drunk “in public” and behaving in a certain way. The key fact is that police took Martin from his home and put him onto the public highway, and that’s where the “public intoxication” element gets satisfied.

So the holding is: you can’t get criminal liability if the crucial “being in public while drunk” happened because the state physically forced you there.

What you should be ready to say if called on Martin is:

“The relevant act is ‘appearing in public while intoxicated.’ That’s the actus reus the statute targets. And here that act wasn’t voluntary because the police carried him there. If you define the act narrowly, there’s no voluntary act satisfying the statute.”

Then you should be ready for the Harcourt push:

“Okay, but didn’t he choose to get drunk?”

And that’s where you say, calmly:

“That depends on time-framing. If we broaden the frame, we can redescribe the conduct as ‘getting drunk knowing you might end up in public’ or ‘getting drunk in circumstances that foreseeably lead to public drunkenness.’ But the court chooses the narrower frame that tracks the statutory element.”

The key is: you’re not just reciting the rule; you’re showing you see the framing choice.

### People v. Newton: “Unconsciousness can be a complete defense.”

Newton is about what counts as “unconscious” action. Newton was in a struggle, there’s a shooting, he may have been shot first, and the claim is that he was in a shock reaction — basically, unconscious in the relevant way.

The holding, in simplified form: if there is evidence that the defendant was involuntarily unconscious (not self-induced intoxication, etc.), the jury has to be instructed that unconsciousness is a complete defense — because there is no voluntary act.

What Harcourt might push you on is the boundary question:

What counts as unconsciousness? Is it total blackout? Is it a dissociative state? Is it shock?

You don’t need medical precision. You need the legal move:

“If the defendant’s bodily movements weren’t the product of conscious or habitual effort or determination, then the voluntary act requirement fails.”

And you should also be ready to contrast it with intoxication cases:

The law is much less sympathetic if you “made yourself” unconscious through voluntary intoxication. Newton is different because the alleged unconsciousness is caused by an external shock event.

### People v. Decina: “The voluntary act can be earlier than the harm.”

Decina is the case you use to show how the court escapes the “seizure = involuntary” intuition.

The story: defendant is prone to seizures, he drives anyway, he has a seizure while driving and kills multiple people. If you look only at the moment of the seizure, his bodily movement is not voluntary. But the court holds him liable.

The way to say it is:

“The voluntary act is the earlier choice to drive despite knowing about the condition and the risk. That earlier voluntary choice counts as the voluntary act within the course of conduct that produced the deaths.”

This is time-framing in action. The court broadens the frame. It joins earlier and later moments into one incident and treats the earlier decision as the act that grounds liability.

And once you see that, you can generate clean cold-call comparisons:

Martin: the court narrows the frame and focuses on the element “in public.”

Decina: the court broadens the frame and focuses on the earlier choice that created the lethal risk.

Newton: the court focuses on whether the bodily movement in the moment is voluntary at all.

## PART 4: OMISSIONS — JONES AS YOUR 30-SECOND RULE (3 minutes)

The omission rule is simple but strict:

You are generally not guilty for failing to act unless you had a legal duty to act.

Jones is the classic four-category list. If called on it, you say:

“A legal duty can come from: a statute; a certain status relationship; a contractual duty; or voluntary assumption of care plus secluding the person so others can’t help.”

That “voluntary assumption + seclusion” detail is important. It’s the difference between “you’re a bad person who didn’t help” and “you took charge of care in a way that cut off other rescuers.”

And in Harcourt terms, you should also be ready to say why omissions doctrine matters:

It’s one of the places criminal law draws a boundary around what it will demand of citizens — how much we are obligated to be each other’s rescuers — and that boundary is deeply political.

## PART 5: THE KELMAN MOVE — TIME-FRAMING AS A SKILL (3 minutes)

The Kelman takeaway you want is not a citation. It’s a tool.

Here’s the tool:

Any fact pattern can be described at different time scales.

Narrow time frame: you isolate the last moment. That tends to support an “intentionalist” picture — what did the defendant do right then?

Broad time frame: you include earlier choices, earlier pressures, and longer context. That can either increase blame (Decina: earlier choice to drive) or decrease blame (other doctrines: duress, insanity, provocation, where broader context makes the moment look less freely chosen).

Harcourt’s likely push is: “So is the voluntary act requirement actually a constraint, or just an aesthetic?”

Your best answer is:

“It’s a real constraint in some cases, but courts often preserve outcomes by redefining the act earlier or later in the timeline. So the doctrine is both limiting and flexible, and that flexibility is itself a policy choice.”

## COLD CALL PREP (3 minutes)

If Harcourt asks…

1) “What is the voluntary act requirement?”
- A: “Criminal liability requires conduct that includes a voluntary act, or a legally significant omission. The idea is we don’t punish reflexes, seizures, or purely involuntary movements.”
- Push: “So why punish Decina?” → “Because the voluntary act can be earlier: the choice to drive knowing the seizure risk.”

2) “What’s the voluntary act in Martin?”
- A: “There isn’t one that satisfies the statutory element. The ‘appearing in public’ was forced by police.”
- Push: “But he chose to get drunk.” → “That’s a different framing of ‘the act’ and the court chose the narrower frame tied to the element.”

3) “Newton — what’s the doctrinal point?”
- A: “Unconsciousness, if involuntary and supported by evidence, can negate the voluntary act and is a complete defense.”

4) “When can an omission be criminal?”
- A: “Only with a legal duty — statute, status relationship, contract, or voluntary assumption + seclusion (Jones).”

5) “Give me the one-sentence Kelman point.”
- A: “Time-framing choices are outcome-determinative: narrow vs broad descriptions of ‘the act’ can flip whether conduct is treated as voluntary.”

## CLOSING (1 minute)

The connection to next class is simple: once we know what counts as the act, the next question is what state of mind attaches to each element — MPC §2.02.

Walking into class today, your job is not to recite Latin. Your job is to spot the framing choice and defend whichever frame helps your argument — while admitting that it’s a choice.
