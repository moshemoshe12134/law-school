# Prep Packet — Class #5 — 2026-01-29 — Heat of Passion

## 0) Outcome Targets (5 minutes)
- By the end of prep, I can: (1) state the elements of common-law heat of passion/provocation defense; (2) distinguish Girouard's categorical approach from Maher's flexible jury-determination approach; (3) explain MPC §210.3(1)(b)'s "extreme mental or emotional disturbance" (EMED) and how it differs from common law; (4) identify the traditional categories of adequate provocation; (5) apply the cooling time requirement and its exceptions; (6) discuss partial justification vs. partial excuse theories; (7) write a jury instruction for provocation/EMED.

## 1) Assignment Snapshot
- **Syllabus extract**: `Admin/Syllabus/Assignments/2026-01-29_class05.md`
- **Harcourt's two-level reading framework**:
  - **Technical/legal level**: Map out elements of homicide, attach mens rea to act requirements, write jury instructions
  - **Theoretical level**: What does criminal law reveal about our culture and moral judgments? How are moral judgments hidden in cases/codes?
- **Reading triage**:
  - **Cases**: Girouard (words alone, categorical approach), Maher (flexible, case-by-case), Casassa (MPC EMED)
  - **MPC §210.3(1)(b)**: Understand EMED — hybrid subjective/objective standard

## 2) Common-Law Heat of Passion Doctrine

### Elements (Traditional)
To mitigate murder to voluntary manslaughter, defendant must prove:
1. **Adequate provocation**: Objective — would cause a reasonable person to lose self-control
2. **Actually provoked**: Subjective — defendant actually did lose self-control
3. **No cooling time**: Killing occurred in heat of passion before "reasonable time" for blood to cool elapsed
4. **Causal connection**: Killing was result of the passion, not independent calculation

### Traditional Categories of Adequate Provocation (Girouard approach)
Majority jurisdictions (like Maryland in Girouard) limit adequate provocation to specific categories:
1. **Extreme assault or battery** on defendant
2. **Mutual combat**
3. **Illegal arrest** of defendant
4. **Injury or serious abuse** of close relative of defendant
5. **Sudden discovery** of spouse's adultery (in flagrante delicto — "in the very act")

**Key limitation**: **Words alone are NOT adequate provocation** (Girouard)

### Cooling Time Requirement
- Significant lapse of time between provocation and killing makes provocation inadequate
- **Majority rule**: Court decides cooling time as matter of law
- **Exception (Berry)**: Jury can find "long-smoldering" passion — passage of time aggravates rather than cools
- **Rekindling**: Some courts allow earlier provocation to be rekindled by fresh event (but many reject this)

---

## 3) The Great Split: Girouard vs. Maher

### Girouard v. State (Maryland, 1991) — Categorical Approach

**Facts (30 seconds)**:
- Steven and Joyce married 2 months; tense marriage; Joyce possibly resuming relationship with ex-boyfriend Wayne
- Argument escalated: Joyce taunted Steven with "I never did want to marry you and you are a lousy fuck and you remind me of my dad" (who abused her); said she wanted divorce, filed abuse charges against him, he'd be court-martialed
- Steven lunged with kitchen knife hidden behind pillow, stabbed her **19 times**
- Attempted suicide (slit wrists), called police: "I just murdered my wife"

**Holding / Rule**:
- Conviction for **second-degree murder** upheld; provocation **inadequate** for manslaughter
- **Words alone** cannot constitute adequate provocation
- Words can be adequate **if accompanied by conduct** indicating present intention/ability to cause bodily harm
- Here: Joyce's minor physical acts (stepped on back, pulled hair) insufficient to create fear of bodily harm (size disparity: 5'1"/115 lbs vs. 6'2"/200+ lbs)

**Key language**:
> "We cannot in good conscience countenance holding that a verbal domestic argument ending in the death of one spouse can result in a conviction of manslaughter. Social necessity dictates our holding. Domestic arguments easily escalate into furious fights. We perceive no reason for a holding in favor of those who find the easiest way to end a domestic dispute is by killing the offending spouse."

> "There must be not simply provocation in psychological fact, but one of certain fairly well-defined classes of provocation recognized as being adequate as a matter of law."

**Policy hook**:
- **Categorical certainty**: Bright-line rules prevent jury arbitrariness
- **Domestic violence prevention**: Don't incentivize killing spouses as "easy way out" of disputes
- **Objective standard**: "Reasonable man" — doesn't focus on defendant's "peculiar frailties of mind"

---

### Maher v. People (Michigan, 1862) — Flexible Approach

**Facts (30 seconds)**:
- Maher discovered wife's adultery by following her and Hunt into woods; emerged 30 minutes later; friend told him they'd also had intercourse day before
- Maher pursued Hunt to saloon, entered "agitated," shot Hunt in ear (non-fatal)
- Trial court excluded evidence of adultery; convicted of assault with intent to murder

**Holding / Rule**:
- Reversed; evidence of adultery **should have been admitted**
- **Case-by-case approach**: Provocation adequacy is **question of fact for jury**, not categorical legal rule
- Jury better positioned than judge to determine "average of ordinary human nature" and what provokes passion

**Key language**:
> "The law can not with justice assume by the light of past decision, to catalogue all the various facts and combinations of facts which shall be held to constitute reasonable or adequate provocation. Scarcely two past cases can be found which are identical in all their circumstances; and there is no reason to hope for greater uniformity in future. Provocations will be given without reference to any previous model, and the passions they excite will not consult the precedents."

> "The standard of reasonableness does not and should not focus on the peculiar frailties of mind of the Petitioner."

**Cooling time**:
- Also question of fact for jury, not legal rule
- Depends on "nature of man and laws of human mind" and "nature and circumstances of provocation"

**Dissent (Manning, J.)**:
- Provocation must be given **in presence** of person committing homicide
- Would be "extremely mischievous to let passion engendered by suspicion, or by something one has heard, enter into and determine the nature of a crime"
- "Innocent as well as guilty" might suffer

**Policy hook**:
- **Jury discretion**: Trust jurors to draw line based on community standards
- **Flexibility**: Human passion is too varied to catalogue in advance
- **Realism**: Doesn't pretend that only certain things provoke people

---

## 4) Comparing the Two Approaches

### Girouard (Categorical) — Majority Rule
**Categories**: Assault/battery, mutual combat, illegal arrest, abuse of relative, discovery of adultery
**Words alone**: Never sufficient
**Cooling time**: Legal question for court
**Advantages**:
- Predictability, limits jury bias
- Prevents domestic violence
- Protects women from abusive husbands who claim "provocation"

**Disadvantages**:
- Arbitrary (why THESE categories?)
- Ignores cultural change (categories from 19th century)
- May exclude genuinely understandable loss of control

### Maher (Flexible) — Minority Rule
**Categories**: None — case-by-case jury determination
**Words alone**: Can be adequate if jury finds they would cause reasonable person to lose self-control
**Cooling time**: Question of fact for jury
**Advantages**:
- Flexible, responsive to facts
- Trusts jury's collective wisdom
- Admits human complexity

**Disadvantages**:
- Unpredictable
- Jury bias (especially against women, LGBTQ people)
- May expand doctrine too far

## 5) MPC Approach: Extreme Mental or Emotional Disturbance (EMED)

### MPC § 210.3(1)(b) — EMED Provision
> "Criminal homicide constitutes manslaughter when: a homicide which would otherwise be murder is committed under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance for which there is reasonable explanation or excuse. The reasonableness of such explanation or excuse shall be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the actor's situation under the circumstances as he believes them to be."

### Two-Part Test

**Part 1 — Subjective**: Did defendant act under influence of EMED?
- Wholly subjective — defendant's actual emotional state
- Was claimed explanation "contrived or sham"?

**Part 2 — Hybrid Objective-Subjective**: Was there reasonable explanation or excuse?
- **Subjective element**: View "person in actor's situation" (individual circumstances)
- **Subjective element**: "Circumstances as actor believes them to be" (even if mistaken)
- **Objective element**: Explanation/excuse must be "reasonable" from that viewpoint

### EMED vs. Common-Law Heat of Passion

| Feature | Common-Law Heat of Passion | MPC EMED |
|---------|---------------------------|----------|
| Scope | Narrow (limited categories) | Broad (any EMED) |
| Provocation required? | Yes (adequate provocation) | No (any EMED with reasonable explanation) |
| Cooling time? | Yes (must be immediate) | No (can simmer over time) |
| Standard | Reasonable person | Person in actor's situation as actor believes |
| Words alone | Never adequate | Can be adequate |
| Objective/Subjective | Purely objective | Hybrid |
| Flexibility | Rigid categories | Open-ended jury judgment |

**Key quote from Patterson (cited in Casassa)**:
> "An action influenced by an extreme emotional disturbance is not one that is necessarily so spontaneously undertaken. Rather, it may be that a significant mental trauma has affected a defendant's mind for a substantial period of time, simmering in the unknowing subconscious and then inexplicably coming to the fore."

---

## 6) Case: People v. Casassa (New York, 1980) — EMED Applied

**Facts (30 seconds)**:
- Casassa became obsessed with Lo Consolo after she rejected him
- Broke into apartment below to eavesdrop; broke into her apartment, disrobed, lay in her bed (armed with knife)
- Final visit: Brought wine/liquor as gift; she rejected it; he stabbed her multiple times in throat, dragged body to bathtub, submerged to "make sure she was dead"
- Psychiatrist for defense: Obsession + personality attributes caused EMED
- Psychiatrist for prosecution: Disturbance was self-created, "stress from within himself, dealing mostly with a fantasy, a refusal to accept reality"

**Holding / Rule**:
- Murder conviction upheld; EMED defense **failed**
- Court applied **two-part test**:
  1. **Subjective**: Accepted Casassa was under EMED (threshold met)
  2. **Objective reasonableness**: His explanation was "so peculiar to him that it was unworthy of mitigation"
- Self-created trauma based on fantasy/refusal to accept reality ≠ reasonable explanation

**Key language**:
> "The determination whether there was reasonable explanation or excuse for a particular emotional disturbance should be made by viewing the subjective, internal situation in which the defendant found himself and the external circumstances as he perceived them at the time, however inaccurate that perception may have been, and assessing from that standpoint whether the explanation or excuse for his emotional disturbance was reasonable."

> "The purpose was explicitly to give full scope to what amounts to a plea in mitigation based upon a mental or emotional trauma of significant dimensions, with the jury asked to show whatever empathy it can."

**Policy hook**:
- EMED is broader than heat of passion (abolishes rigid categories, cooling time)
- But not unlimited — must be "reasonable" from actor's perceived situation
- "Self-created" trauma based on fantasy doesn't qualify
- Jury empathy has role, but must be bounded

---

## 7) Policy / Theory Brief

### What is Provocation? Partial Justification vs. Partial Excuse

**Partial Justification**:
- Focuses on **wrongfulness of act**
- Defendant's response is **partially right** or at least not entirely wrong
- Victim's wrongfulness reduces blameworthiness of killing
- Example: Killing person sexually assaulting your child — victim's wrongdoing justifies some response

**Partial Excuse**:
- Focuses on **culpability of actor**
- Act is **wholly wrong** but defendant is **less culpable** due to diminished capacity
- We forgive because of reduced volitional/cognitive capacity
- "Frailty of human nature" — ordinary people might lose control

**Why it matters**:
- If provocation is **partial justification**:
  - Should apply **only** if victim did something wrong
  - Should **not** apply if defendant kills innocent bystander (Scriva, Spurlin)
  - Cooling time rule makes sense — justification fades with time

- If provocation is **partial excuse**:
  - Should apply regardless of victim's conduct
  - Should apply if defendant kills innocent bystander (loss of control is same)
  - Cooling time rule makes less sense — emotional disturbance can persist

**Balkin pairs (Class 3 connection)**:
- **Individualist** (defense): Focus on defendant's actual mental state, unique circumstances
- **Communalist** (prosecution): Focus on objective reasonableness, social norms, protection of victims

---

### Feminist Critiques and Reforms

**Traditional doctrine is "anti-woman"**:
- Categories reflect 19th-century male honor culture (adultery, mutual combat)
- Men kill wives/partners and claim "provocation" from infidelity, taunting
- Juries view "masculine violence as inevitable fact of life"
- Women rarely kill unfaithful partners — doctrine doesn't map onto women's experiences

**Reforms**:
- Some states abolish adultery as adequate provocation (Maryland after Peacock case)
- Some states ban "gay panic" and "trans panic" defenses (NY, CA, and 10+ others)
- Some jurisdictions require provocation be "in presence" of defendant

**Counterargument (Gruber)**:
- Provocation claims rarely succeed
- Group most burdened by abolition = young men of color accused of non-intimate homicides (most punitive system)
- Women kill intimates (family, children) — limiting provocation in intimate homicides disproportionately harms women
- Law's leniency doesn't benefit women equally because they're not most defendants

---

### Cultural Judgments Hidden in Law

**Harcourt's theoretical question**: What do these cases reveal about our moral judgments?

1. **Adultery as provocation**: Law treats sexual infidelity as serious wrong justifying loss of control — reflects historical property rights in women's sexuality

2. **"Words alone" rule**: Verbal abuse can't provoke — assumes physical threats are only real harm; minimizes psychological violence

3. **Size/sex disparities**: Girouard notes Joyce (5'1"/115 lbs) couldn't cause Steven (6'2"/200 lbs) to fear bodily harm — implicit assumptions about gendered violence

4. **"Reasonable man"**: Assumes male perspective — what reasonable MAN would feel, not reasonable person across genders

5. **Domestic violence**: Girouard refuses to incentivize "easiest way to end domestic dispute" — recognizes domestic homicide as social problem

6. **EMED expansion**: Reflects modern psychology's understanding of trauma, obsession, mental illness — law catches up to science

## 8) Cold Call / Co-Counsel Script (2 minutes)

**If called on common-law heat of passion elements**:
- **Four elements**: (1) Adequate provocation (objective); (2) Actually provoked (subjective); (3) No cooling time; (4) Causal connection (killing resulted from passion)
- **Traditional categories**: Assault/battery, mutual combat, illegal arrest, abuse of relative, sudden discovery of adultery
- **Words alone**: Not adequate (Girouard, majority rule)

**If called on Girouard vs. Maher**:
- **Girouard (categorical)**: Only specific categories count; words alone never adequate; court decides adequacy as matter of law; promotes certainty, prevents domestic violence
- **Maher (flexible)**: No fixed categories; jury decides case-by-case what provocation is adequate; includes words alone; trusts jury's collective wisdom
- **Majority/minority**: Majority follows Girouard; minority follows Maher

**If called on MPC EMED**:
- **Two-part test**: (1) Subjective — did defendant act under EMED? (2) Hybrid — was there reasonable explanation/excuse from viewpoint of person in actor's situation under circumstances as actor believes them to be?
- **Key differences from common law**: No rigid categories, no cooling time requirement, broader scope, includes self-created trauma only if reasonable
- **Casassa**: EMED not met because disturbance was "self-created," based on fantasy/refusal to accept reality

**If called on cooling time**:
- **Common law**: Significant lapse of time negates provocation (matter of law for court)
- **Exception (Berry)**: "Long-smoldering" passion — passage of time can aggravate rather than cool (jury question)
- **MPC**: No cooling time requirement — EMED can simmer over time

**If called on partial justification vs. excuse**:
- **Justification**: Act is partially right; victim's wrongdoing reduces blameworthiness; explains why victim must be actual provoker
- **Excuse**: Act is wholly wrong but defendant less culpable due to diminished capacity; explains why killing innocent bystander doesn't negate defense
- **Most courts**: Hybrid — both elements

---

## 9) Hypo Triggers (Practice)

### Hypo 1: Domestic Argument (Girouard-style)
Husband and wife argue for hours about divorce. She taunts him: "I never loved you, I'm leaving you for someone better, you're pathetic." He snaps, grabs knife, stabs her 15 times. He has history of depression.

**Common-law analysis**: Second-degree murder — words alone inadequate provocation (Girouard)
**Maher analysis**: Jury could find manslaughter — words + long argument might provoke reasonable person
**MPC EMED**: Could be manslaughter if jury finds (1) EMED and (2) reasonable explanation (long marital discord + depression + sudden rejection)

### Hypo 2: The "Cooling Time" Problem
D discovers spouse in bed with lover. D is enraged, leaves house, drives around for 2 hours, returns, shoots lover.

**Common-law**: Murder — 2 hours = adequate cooling time as matter of law
**Berry exception**: Jury could find passion smoldered/rekindled when D returned
**MPC EMED**: No cooling time — could still be manslaughter if D acted under EMED with reasonable explanation

### Hypo 3: Non-Provoking Victim (Misdirected)
D gets into fight with Bouncer at bar. Bouncer kicks D out, throws him down stairs. D waits outside, sees Pat (unrelated patron) exit, thinks it's Bouncer in dim light, shoots and kills Pat.

**Common-law**: Murder — victim not provoker
**Some statutes**: Derivative provocation allowed (NJ, PA statute)
**Excuse theory**: If D lost control, does it matter who he killed? (Most courts: yes, matters)

### Hypo 4: Self-Created Trauma (Casassa-style)
D obsessed with coworker V after she rejects him. D stalks V, creates elaborate fantasy relationship in mind. One day D brings flowers to V's work, she rejects them publicly, D shoots V.

**MPC EMED analysis**:
- Part 1 (subjective): D was under EMED (yes, obsession)
- Part 2 (objective): Was disturbance "self-created"? Did D refuse to accept reality?
- Likely **murder** — like Casassa, self-created fantasy ≠ reasonable explanation

---

## 10) Jury Instruction Drafting Exercise

### Common-Law Provocation Instruction (Girouard-style)
> "The defendant claims the killing was committed in the heat of passion caused by adequate provocation, which would reduce the crime from murder to voluntary manslaughter. To establish this defense, the defendant must prove all of the following elements by a preponderance of the evidence:
>
> First, that the defendant was provoked by [specific category — e.g., extreme assault and battery] upon the defendant by the victim;
>
> Second, that the defendant actually became passionately excited and lost self-control as a result of this provocation;
>
> Third, that not enough time passed between the provocation and the killing for the defendant's passion to have cooled; and
>
> Fourth, that the defendant killed the victim while still under the influence of this passion and not as a result of further reflection or calculation.
>
> Provocation is adequate only if it is of a type that would cause a reasonable person to lose self-control. Mere words or insults, no matter how abusive, are not adequate provocation."

### MPC EMED Instruction (Casassa-style)
> "The defendant claims that the homicide was committed under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse. This is an affirmative defense, and the defendant must prove it by a preponderance of the evidence.
>
> To establish this defense, you must find both of the following elements:
>
> First, that the defendant acted under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance. This means the defendant experienced an emotional trauma or disturbance that significantly affected his ability to control his actions. This is a subjective question — did the defendant actually experience such a disturbance?
>
> Second, that there was a reasonable explanation or excuse for this disturbance. In deciding whether the explanation or excuse was reasonable, you must view the situation from the perspective of a person in the defendant's position, under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be, even if those beliefs were mistaken. However, the explanation or excuse must still be objectively reasonable from that perspective.
>
> If you find both elements proven, the crime is reduced to manslaughter."

## 11) Predictions (explicit + falsifiable)

### Likely covered in class:
- Deep dive on Girouard vs. Maher split — categorical vs. flexible approaches
- Hypotheticals testing what counts as "adequate provocation" (adultery, words, mutual combat)
- MPC EMED two-part test — subjective + hybrid objective/subjective
- Casassa application of EMED — when is self-created trauma unreasonable?
- Jury instruction drafting — Harcourt may ask students to draft instructions

### Likely skipped:
- Detailed notes after cases (Harcourt may reference some concepts)
- Mercy killing controversy (mentioned in notes)
- Non-provoking victims issue (brief mention only)

### Likely cold-call targets:
- "What are the elements of heat of passion at common law?"
- "Was Girouard rightly decided? What if Maher approach applied?"
- "Does the MPC abolish or expand heat of passion doctrine?"
- "Write a jury instruction for provocation/EMED"
- "What is 'reasonable explanation or excuse' under MPC?"

### Likely policy debate:
- Should provocation defense be abolished? (Feminist critiques, racial justice concerns)
- Is domestic homicide different from other homicides? (Girouard's "social necessity" rationale)
- Should "gay panic" and "trans panic" be banned? (Cultural judgments in law)
- Partial justification vs. partial excuse — which is correct?

### Likely exam angle / "what he wants you to learn":
- **Provocation is malleable** — Girouard and Maher show two defensible approaches
- **Cultural values embedded in law** — What counts as "adequate provocation" reveals moral judgments (adultery = serious wrong; words = not serious; male honor = worthy of protection)
- **MPC modernizes but doesn't solve** — EMED is broader but still requires "reasonableness" judgment
- **Jury discretion vs. legal rules** — Maher trusts juries; Girouard limits them — trade-off between flexibility and predictability
- **Hypothetical application**: Be able to argue both prosecution (inadequate provocation) and defense (adequate provocation) positions

---

## 12) TA / Office Hours Questions (if any)
- For exam, should we assume jurisdiction follows Girouard or Maher approach unless told otherwise?
- Does MPC EMED require "external" provocation, or can it be purely internal mental illness?
- How much weight should jury instructions get on exam — should we be prepared to draft them?
- Under MPC, does "circumstances as actor believes them to be" mean mistakes of fact always help defendant?
