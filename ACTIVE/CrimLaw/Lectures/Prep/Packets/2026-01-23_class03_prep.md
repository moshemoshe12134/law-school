# Prep Packet — Class #3 — 2026-01-23 — Mens Rea

## 0) Outcome Targets (5 minutes)

- By the end of prep, I can: (1) define and distinguish the four MPC mental states (Purposely, Knowingly, Recklessly, Negligently); (2) apply the MPC §2.02(3) default rule (recklessness) and §2.02(4) distribution rule; (3) explain how *Cunningham* and *Faulkner* illustrate the shift to subjective mens rea; (4) use Balkin's "crystalline structure" to generate opposing arguments for a cold call.

## 1) Assignment Snapshot

- **Syllabus extract**: `Admin/Syllabus/Assignments/2026-01-23_class03.md`
- **Reading triage** (Harcourt):
  - **MPC §2.02**: **CRITICAL**. Read word-for-word multiple times. This is the engine of the course.
  - **Supp. Balkin**: Read pages 2-13 carefully. Understand the "opposing pairs" concept.
  - **Cases**: *Cunningham* & *Faulkner* (foundational subjective mens rea); *Elonis* (modern statutory interpretation/subjectivity); *Hazelwood* & *Santillanes* (negligence line-drawing).

## 2) MPC Parsing Sheet (primary)

### MPC § 2.02 — General Requirements of Culpability

> *Note: This is the "master key" to the MPC.*

- **Provision text (verbatim)**:

  - **(1) Minimum Requirements of Culpability**: "...person is not guilty... unless he acted purposely, knowingly, recklessly or negligently, as the law may require, with respect to each material element of the offense."
  - **(2) Kinds of Culpability Defined**:
    - **(a) Purposely**: (i) conscious object to engage in conduct or cause result; (ii) aware of attendant circumstances (or believes/hopes they exist).
    - **(b) Knowingly**: (i) aware that conduct is of that nature or circumstances exist; (ii) aware that it is practically certain that conduct will cause such a result.
    - **(c) Recklessly**: Consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk. Disregard involves a gross deviation from the standard of conduct of a law-abiding person.
    - **(d) Negligently**: Should be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk. Failure to perceive involves a gross deviation from the standard of care of a reasonable person.
  - **(3) Culpability Required Unless Otherwise Provided**: If statute is silent, **Recklessness** is the default minimum.
  - **(4) Prescribed Culpability Requirement Applies to All Material Elements**: If one mens rea is stated (e.g., "knowingly"), it applies to ALL material elements unless a contrary purpose plainly appears.
- **Defined terms / cross-references**:

  - "Material element" (§1.13(10))
  - "Conduct," "Result," "Attendant Circumstances" (the three element types from §1.13(9))
- **Elements (The 4 Levels)**:

  1. **Purpose**: Conscious object (desire).
  2. **Knowledge**: Practical certainty (awareness).
  3. **Recklessness**: Conscious disregard of risk (subjective awareness + objective deviation).
  4. **Negligence**: Failure to perceive risk (objective deviation only).
- **Mens rea attachment (where does it apply?)**:

  - **Crucial**: Mens rea attaches to *each element* separately. You can be purposeful as to conduct but only reckless as to result.
  - §2.02(4) is the "distributive" canon: a single mens rea word at the start of a statute travels through to all elements.
- **Interpretive moves Harcourt might make**:

  - **The "Default" Game**: If a statute says "It is a crime to [verb] [noun]," what is the mens rea? -> §2.02(3) says Recklessness.
  - **The "Distributive" Game**: "Whoever knowingly [verb] [noun]..." -> Does "knowingly" apply to the noun too? -> §2.02(4) says Yes.
  - **Subjective vs. Objective**: P, K, and R are *subjective* (defendant's mind). N is *objective* (reasonable person). The line between R and N is the "conscious disregard" (did they know the risk?).
- **Ambiguities / line-drawing**:

  - **Recklessness vs. Negligence**: Did D *actually* know the risk (R) or *should* they have known (N)? This is a fact question often proven by circumstantial evidence.
  - **"Substantial and Unjustifiable"**: What does this mean? It's a value judgment (Balkin territory). Driving has risks, but is it "unjustifiable"?
- **Quick hypo trigger**:

  - **The "Exploding Statue"**: D steals a statue. It explodes, killing V.
    - Theft: Purpose (to take).
    - Homicide: Did D know it might explode?
      - If yes + disregarded -> Reckless (Manslaughter).
      - If no, but should have -> Negligent (Negligent Homicide).
      - If no, and reasonable not to -> No liability for death (Accident).

## 3) Policy / Theory Brief (co-primary)

### Jack Balkin: "The Crystalline Structure of Legal Thought"

- **Central thesis (1 sentence)**:

  - Legal arguments are not infinite; they fall into recurring, opposing pairs (dyads) that reflect fundamental tensions in liberal thought (e.g., individualism vs. communalism).
- **3 supporting claims (bullets)**:

  - **Argument Pairs**: For every argument (e.g., "No liability without fault"), there is a standard counter-argument (e.g., "As between two innocents, the one who caused the harm should pay").
  - **Level of Abstraction**: We can move up and down levels of abstraction to make these arguments fit any case.
  - **Moral Conflict**: These arguments aren't just logic; they represent competing moral/political visions (freedom of action vs. security from harm).
- **2 key quotes**:

  - "Legal thought is not a chaotic mess... it has a crystalline structure."
  - "We are always choosing between a regime of individualism and a regime of communalism."
- **How this policy frame changes doctrine/application**:

  - **Mens Rea Debates**:
    - **Subjective (Individualist)**: "Only punish what *I* intended/knew. Don't punish me for stupidity." (Focus on D's agency).
    - **Objective (Communalist)**: "You must live up to community standards. If you're dangerous/stupid, we need to protect society." (Focus on social welfare).
  - **Strict Liability**:
    - **Arg**: "Efficiency, protection of public."
    - **Counter**: "Unfair to punish without blame."
- **Likely Harcourt questions (Socratic prompts)**:

  - "Mr. [Name], give me the 'individualist' argument for requiring Purpose here."
  - "Now give me the 'communalist' counter-argument for allowing Negligence."
  - "Does Balkin explain why we have the line between Recklessness and Negligence?"

## 4) Minimal Case Cards (tertiary)

### Case: *Regina v. Cunningham* (1957)

- **Facts**: D ripped gas meter off wall to steal money; gas leaked into neighbor's house, poisoning her. Charged with "maliciously administering noxious thing."
- **Holding**: "Malice" does not mean "wickedness." It means (1) actual intention to do harm, or (2) recklessness (foresight of consequence). Remanded to see if he *foresaw* the risk.
- **MPC hook**: Defines **Recklessness** (conscious disregard). Rejects "general wickedness" in favor of element-specific mens rea.
- **Policy hook**: Shift from "moral guilt" (he's a thief, so he's guilty of everything) to "cognitive guilt" (did he think about *this* specific harm?).

### Case: *Regina v. Faulkner* (1877)

- **Facts**: Sailor stealing rum lights match, accidentally burns down ship. Convicted of arson.
- **Holding**: Conviction quashed. Intent to steal (felony) does not automatically transfer to intent to burn (arson). Needs specific mens rea for the burning.
- **MPC hook**: Rejection of "transferred intent" across different crimes. Mens rea must attach to the specific *result* element.
- **Policy hook**: Proportionality. Stealing rum is minor; burning ship is major. Shouldn't punish for major crime based on minor intent.

### Case: *Elonis v. United States* (2015)

- **Facts**: D posted violent rap lyrics on Facebook about wife/FBI. Charged with "transmitting threat." Issue: Is "threat" measured objectively (reasonable person feels threatened) or subjectively (D intended to threaten)?
- **Holding**: Court reads in a *mens rea* requirement. Negligence (reasonable person) is not enough for criminal liability in this statute. Must show D *intended* to threaten or knew/recklessly disregarded the risk.
- **MPC hook**: §2.02(3) default rule (usually recklessness). Court avoids constitutional issue by using statutory interpretation.
- **Policy hook**: Free speech vs. Safety. Subjective standard protects speech (Balkin: Individualism). Objective standard protects victims (Balkin: Communalism).

### Case: *Santillanes v. New Mexico* (1993)

- **Facts**: D's nephew cut neck on glass while D was "disciplining" him. Statute: "Child abuse = negligently causing..."
- **Holding**: "Negligence" in criminal statute means *criminal negligence* (MPC Recklessness/Gross Negligence), not *civil negligence* (simple failure of care).
- **MPC hook**: The gap between Civil Negligence (tort) and Criminal Negligence (MPC §2.02(2)(d) - "gross deviation").
- **Policy hook**: Stigma of criminal law requires higher culpability threshold than torts.

## 5) Cold Call / Co‑Counsel Script (2 minutes)

**If called on MPC §2.02 Definitions:**

- **Purpose**: "Conscious object." I *want* it to happen.
- **Knowledge**: "Practical certainty." I know it *will* happen, even if I don't care.
- **Recklessness**: "Conscious disregard." I know it *might* happen (substantial risk), and I do it anyway. (Subjective awareness).
- **Negligence**: "Should have known." I didn't know, but a reasonable person would have. (Objective failure).

**If called on the "Default Rules":**

- **Silence**: If the statute is silent, §2.02(3) sets the floor at **Recklessness**.
- **Distribution**: If one word ("knowingly") starts the clause, §2.02(4) distributes it to all material elements.

**If called on *Cunningham* / *Faulkner*:**

- **Core Principle**: Mens rea is element-specific. You can't just be "generally bad" (stealing rum/gas meter) and be liable for all consequences. You must have the requisite mental state for the *specific* harm (burning ship/poisoning).
- **Shift**: Moves from "offense analysis" (he's a criminal) to "element analysis" (did he foresee *this* result?).

**If called on Balkin/Policy:**

- **The Move**: "This is a conflict between the Individualist perspective (focus on D's subjective mind/agency) and the Communalist perspective (focus on social protection/objective standards)."
- **Application**: *Elonis* chose Individualism (protect speaker). *Santillanes* chose Individualism (protect D from criminal stigma for mere accidents).

## 6) Predictions (explicit + falsifiable)

- **Likely covered in class**:

  - **The Grid**: Harcourt will likely draw a grid of the 4 mental states.
  - **The "Exploding Statue" Hypo**: Or similar "bad act -> unexpected result" to test *Faulkner*.
  - **Elonis**: Discussing how the Court essentially adopted the MPC approach (reading in mens rea) without explicitly citing it.
  - **Balkin**: Using the "crystalline structure" to map the arguments in *Elonis* (Free speech vs. Fear).
- **Likely skipped**:

  - Detailed facts of *Hazelwood* (Exxon Valdez) - likely just used for the "civil vs. criminal negligence" point.
- **Likely cold-call targets**:

  - "Define Recklessness vs. Negligence." (The key difference is *awareness*).
  - "Does 'Knowingly' apply to the age of the victim in this statute?" (Testing §2.02(4)).

## 7) TA / Office Hours Questions (if any)

- Does the "gross deviation" standard in Recklessness/Negligence effectively import an objective standard into Recklessness? (i.e., the *risk* must be objectively unjustifiable).
- How does "Willful Blindness" fit into Knowledge under the MPC? (MPC §2.02(7) - high probability = knowledge).
