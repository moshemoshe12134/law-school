# Prep Packet — Class #4 — 2026-01-27 — Intended Killings

## 0) Outcome Targets (5 minutes)
- By the end of prep, I can: (1) explain the Pennsylvania 1794 reform that created the degree system for murder; (2) distinguish Carroll's "instant premeditation" approach from Guthrie's "reflection period" requirement; (3) parse MPC §210.2 and explain how it differs from the common-law degree system; (4) apply the premeditation-deliberation analysis to hypothetical fact patterns; (5) connect this to prior classes (mens rea from Class 3, Kelman time-framing from Class 2).

## 1) Assignment Snapshot
- **Syllabus extract**: `Admin/Syllabus/Assignments/2026-01-27_class04.md`
- **Reading triage** (Harcourt):
  - **MPC §210**: Must read carefully — the MPC's radical break from common-law degrees
  - **Cases**: Carroll (instant premeditation) and Guthrie (rejection of instant premeditation) — these are in direct conflict; understand both approaches
  - **Background**: Pennsylvania 1794 statute — understand the historical shift from common-law murder to degree system

## 2) Background: The Pennsylvania Reform of 1794

### The Common-Law Baseline (Pre-1794)
- At common law, there was only **one type of murder** — all intentional killings were murder, punishable by death (mandatory)
- No degrees, no gradations based on culpability
- This was seen as overly harsh — not all intentional killings are equally blameworthy

### The Pennsylvania Statute of 1794
**Text** (verbatim-ish):
> "All murder, which shall be perpetrated by means of poison, or by lying in wait, or by any other kind of willful, deliberate and premeditated killing, or which shall be committed in the perpetration, or attempt to perpetrate any arson, rape, robbery or burglary shall be deemed murder in the first degree; and all other kinds of murder shall be deemed murder in the second degree."

**Key features**:
1. **First-degree murder** (death penalty):
   - Killings by poison
   - Killings by lying in wait
   - **Willful, deliberate, and premeditated killings** (WDP)
   - Felony murders (during arson, rape, robbery, burglary)

2. **Second-degree murder** (lesser penalty):
   - All other murders (intentional killings that don't meet first-degree criteria)

**Purpose**: To confine the mandatory death penalty to homicides judged "particularly heinous"

**Spread**: Other states followed Pennsylvania's lead — at one time, the vast majority of American jurisdictions differentiated degrees of murder

**Legacy**: The term "first-degree murder" entered common parlance; the WDP formula remains central today

## 3) MPC Parsing Sheet (primary)

### MPC § 210.0 — Definitions
- **(1) "Human being"**: person who has been born and is alive (excludes fetuses)
- **(2) "Bodily injury"**: physical pain, illness, or impairment of physical condition
- **(3) "Serious bodily injury"**: creates substantial risk of death or causes serious/permanent disfigurement or protracted loss/impairment of bodily function
- **(4) "Deadly weapon"**: anything (animate or inanimate) used in a manner capable of producing death or serious bodily injury

### MPC § 210.1 — Criminal Homicide
- **(1)**: "A person is guilty of criminal homicide if he purposely, knowingly, recklessly or negligently causes the death of another human being."
  - Connects back to **MPC §2.02** (four culpability levels from Class 3)
  - All four levels can support homicide liability
- **(2)**: Criminal homicide is **murder**, **manslaughter**, or **negligent homicide**

### MPC § 210.2 — Murder (THE KEY PROVISION)
**Murder = 3 alternative mental states**:
- **(1)(a)**: Killing **purposely** OR **knowingly** (subjective mens rea)
- **(1)(b)**: Killing **recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life** (depraved heart)
  - **Recklessness + extreme indifference** is presumed if actor commits/ attempts/ flees from robbery, rape, deviate sexual intercourse by force, arson, burglary, kidnapping, or felonious escape
  - This is the MPC's version of "felony murder" — but it's a presumption, not strict liability

**MPC's radical break**:
- **NO "premeditation-deliberation" requirement** — the MPC rejects the degree system entirely
- Purpose + Knowledge = murder (regardless of premeditation)
- Depraved heart recklessness = murder (regardless of premeditation)
- **First-degree vs. second-degree**: The MPC doesn't use these categories
- Sentencing is done separately, based on individualized assessment

### MPC § 210.3 — Manslaughter
**Manslaughter = 2 alternative bases**:
- **(1)(a)**: Killing **recklessly** (but WITHOUT extreme indifference)
  - Ordinary recklessness (conscious disregard of substantial/unjustifiable risk)
- **(1)(b)**: **Extreme mental or emotional disturbance (EMED)**
  - Homicide that "would otherwise be murder" (i.e., meets §210.2) is committed under the influence of EMED
  - **Reasonable explanation or excuse** standard: "The reasonableness of such explanation or excuse shall be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the actor's situation under the circumstances as he believes them to be."
  - This is the MPC's version of "heat of passion" / "diminished capacity" — but broader and more subjective

### MPC § 210.4 — Negligent Homicide
- **(1)**: Killing **negligently** (should have known risk, but didn't)
  - Below recklessness on the culpability ladder

### MPC Hierarchy of Intended Killings
| Mental State | MPC Category | Common-Law Equivalent |
|--------------|--------------|----------------------|
| Purposely | Murder | First-degree murder (with premeditation) |
| Knowingly | Murder | First-degree murder (with premeditation) |
| Recklessly + extreme indifference | Murder | Depraved heart murder |
| Recklessly (ordinary) | Manslaughter | Voluntary manslaughter |
| EMED killing | Manslaughter | Voluntary manslaughter (heat of passion) |
| Negligently | Negligent homicide | Involuntary manslaughter |

**Key difference**: MPC looks at **culpability level**, not **time elapsed** or **premeditation**

## 4) The Great Split: Carroll vs. Guthrie on Premeditation

### Commonwealth v. Carroll (Pennsylvania, 1963) — "Instant Premeditation"

**Facts (30 seconds)**:
- Carroll (good character, hard worker, good reputation) had mentally unstable wife with schizoid personality who abused their children
- After hours of arguing about his work assignment (which would take him away from home 4 nights/week), they went to bedroom around 3 AM
- Wife dozed off; Carroll remembered loaded .22 pistol on window sill (put there earlier for wife's protection)
- He "reached up and grabbed the pistol and brought it down and shot her twice in the back of the head"
- He claimed: "I saw my hand move...the only thing I can recollect after that is right after the shots"
- Psychiatrist testified: "rage," "desperation," and "panic" produced "an impulsive automatic reflex type of homicide" — argued he couldn't have formed premeditation

**Holding / Rule**:
- Conviction for first-degree murder upheld
- **Specific intent to kill** for first-degree murder can be inferred from:
  - Defendant's words or conduct
  - Attendant circumstances
  - **Intentional use of deadly weapon on vital part of body**
- **No time requirement**: "Whether the intention to kill and the killing, that is, the premeditation and the fatal act, were within a brief space of time or a long space of time is immaterial if the killing was in fact intentional, wilful, deliberate and premeditated."

**The "no time too short" principle**:
- Quoting *Commonwealth v. Drum*: "No time is too short for a wicked man to frame in his mind the scheme of murder"
- Carroll's argument: "Conversely, a long time is necessary to find premeditation in a 'good man'" — **rejected**
- Court: Time is "immaterial" if killing was intentional

**Key language**:
> "From his own statements and from his own testimony, it is clear that, terribly provoked by his allegedly nagging, belligerent and sadistic wife, defendant remembered the gun, deliberately took it down, and deliberately fired two shots into the head of his sleeping wife. There is no doubt that this was a willful, deliberate and premeditated murder."

**Policy hook**:
- **Prosecution-friendly**: Makes first-degree murder easy to prove — any intentional killing with a deadly weapon can be first-degree
- **Minimal distinction between first and second degree**: If premeditation can be "instant," what's the difference?
- **Jury deference**: "Jury argument" — Carroll's lack of escape plan, difficulty concealing body, etc., are factual matters for the jury

---

### State v. Guthrie (West Virginia, 1995) — "Reflection Required"

**Facts (30 seconds)**:
- Guthrie (dishwasher with psychiatric problems: panic attacks, depression, body dysmorphic disorder obsessed with nose size, borderline personality disorder) worked with victim at restaurant
- Victim teasing Guthrie about being in bad mood, snapped him with dishtowel (playful)
- Dishtowel hit Guthrie's nose — he became enraged, pulled knife from pocket, stabbed coworker in neck
- Victim cried: "Man, I was just kidding around." Guthrie: "Well, man, you should have never hit me in my face."
- No history of conflict; victim didn't realize he was upsetting Guthrie

**Procedural posture**:
- Convicted of first-degree murder under jury instruction: "to constitute a willful, deliberate and premeditated killing, it is not necessary that the intention to kill should exist for any particular length of time...it is only necessary that such intention should have come into existence for the first time at the time of such killing, or at any time previously"
- These are **"Schrader instructions"** — equated premeditation with mere intent to kill, allowed instant formation

**Holding / Rule**:
- **Conviction reversed; new trial ordered**
- **Schrader instructions rejected as "confusing, if not meaningless"**
- **New rule**: Premeditation and deliberation require "some period between the formation of the intent to kill and the actual killing, which indicates...an opportunity for some reflection on the intention to kill after it is formed."
- The accused **must kill purposely after contemplating the intent to kill**
- "Instantaneous premeditation and momentary deliberation is not satisfactory for proof of first-degree murder"

**Key language**:
> "To speak of premeditation and deliberation which are instantaneous or which take no appreciable time, is a contradiction in terms...The deliberate killer is guilty of first degree murder; the impulsive killer is not."

> "There must be some evidence that the defendant considered and weighed his decision to kill in order for the State to establish premeditation and deliberation under our first-degree murder statute. This is what is meant by a ruthless, cold-blooded, calculating killing. Any other intentional killing, by its spontaneous and nonreflective nature, is second-degree murder."

**Policy hook**:
- **Meaningful distinction**: Creates real difference between first and second degree
- **Culpability gradation**: Impulsive killers (less blameworthy) vs. calculated killers (more blameworthy)
- **Deterrence rationale**: "Prospect of death penalty more likely to deter men from deliberate than from impulsive murder"
- **Stare decisis overturned**: Court admitted prior Schrader doctrine was "intrinsically unsound" and overruled it

---

## 5) Comparing the Two Approaches

### Carroll Approach (Instant Premeditation)
**Advantages**:
- Flexible — jury can consider all circumstances
- Prosecution can prove first-degree murder without showing elaborate planning
- No bright-line time requirement avoids loopholes

**Disadvantages**:
- **Collapses first and second degree**: If intent = premeditation (instant), what's the difference?
- Jury can convict anyone with a gun of first-degree murder
- No meaningful gradation of culpability

### Guthrie Approach (Reflection Period)
**Advantages**:
- **Meaningful distinction**: First-degree (calculated) vs. second-degree (impulsive)
- Aligns with death penalty rationale (deterrence, culpability)
- Prevents first-degree convictions for "crimes of passion"

**Disadvantages**:
- **How much time is "some period"?** — still a line-drawing problem
- Defendant who "cools off" for 2 seconds vs. 2 minutes vs. 2 hours — where's the line?
- May allow guilty defendants to escape first-degree liability based on technicality

### The "Contradiction in Terms" Problem
- **Carroll**: Premeditation can be formed "while pressing the trigger"
- **Guthrie**: "Instantaneous premeditation" is a contradiction — premeditation literally means "thinking before"

**Question**: In Carroll jurisdictions, is there a difference between premeditated intent to kill and intent to kill without premeditation?
- **Carroll approach**: Effectively no — intent to kill + deadly weapon = first degree
- **Guthrie approach**: Yes — must have reflection period after intent forms

---

## 6) Kelman Time-Framing (Connection to Class 2)

### How Time-Framing Applies to Premeditation
From Class 2 (Kelman), courts can characterize conduct broadly or narrowly, which is outcome-determinative.

**Carroll (broad time frame)**:
- "The act" = the entire evening of argument, culminating in shooting
- Premeditation formed during argument when he "remembered the gun"
- Time frame: hours of escalating conflict

**Guthrie (narrow time frame)**:
- "The act" = the moment of rage when dishtowel hit nose
- No time for reflection between trigger and stabbing
- Time frame: seconds

**Both can be right** — depends on where you draw the line

### Exam Strategy (Balkin Connection from Class 3)
For any hypo, you can argue **both**:
- **Prosecution** (Carroll approach): Broad time frame, premeditation formed during conflict, deadly weapon shows deliberation
- **Defense** (Guthrie approach): Narrow time frame, instant reaction to provocation, no reflection period

**Harcourt wants you to see the malleability** — these aren't logical deductions, but policy choices

## 7) Cold Call / Co-Counsel Script (2 minutes)

**If called on MPC §210.2 vs. common-law degrees**:
- **Common law**: First-degree murder = willful, deliberate, premeditated killing (Pennsylvania 1794 formula)
- **MPC**: Murder = purposely, knowingly, or recklessly with extreme indifference (no premeditation requirement)
- **MPC's radical break**: Rejects degree system entirely — focuses on culpability level, not time elapsed
- **Sentencing**: MPC handles punishment separately, based on individualized assessment

**If called on Carroll vs. Guthrie split**:
- **Carroll (PA)**: "No time is too short for premeditation" — instant premeditation sufficient; intent to kill + deadly weapon = first degree
- **Guthrie (WV)**: Must have "some period" for reflection after intent forms; "instantaneous premeditation is a contradiction in terms"
- **Key difference**: Carroll collapses first/second degree; Guthrie maintains meaningful distinction
- **Kelman connection**: Both outcomes can be defended by time-framing differently

**If called on "what is premeditation?"**:
- **Definition**: Thinking about killing before doing it — forming intent to kill, then reflecting on it, then acting
- **Carroll**: Can happen in an instant (trigger pull)
- **Guthrie**: Requires some appreciable time for reflection
- **MPC**: Rejects concept entirely — purpose/knowledge is enough, regardless of premeditation

**If called on the Pennsylvania 1794 reform**:
- **Before**: One type of murder, mandatory death penalty
- **After**: Two degrees — first degree (WDP + poison + lying in wait + felony murder) gets death; second degree (lesser penalty)
- **Purpose**: Confining death penalty to "particularly heinous" homicides
- **Legacy**: Degree system spread nationwide; "first-degree murder" entered common parlance

**If called on EMED (MPC §210.3(1)(b))**:
- **What**: "Extreme mental or emotional disturbance" — reduces murder to manslaughter
- **Standard**: Reasonable explanation/excuse from viewpoint of person in actor's situation under circumstances as actor believes them to be
- **Subjective**: "As actor believes them to be" — even if mistaken
- **Compare**: Like heat of passion, but broader (no requirement of adequate provocation)

---

## 8) Minimal Case Cards (tertiary)

### Commonwealth v. Carroll (Pa. 1963)
- **Facts**: After hours of arguing about work assignment, husband grabbed loaded gun from window sill and shot sleeping wife twice in head; claimed "automatic reflex"; psychiatrist testified rage/panic caused impulsive killing
- **Holding**: First-degree murder upheld; premeditation can be instant; "no time is too short for wicked man to frame scheme of murder"
- **Rule**: Intent to kill can be inferred from intentional use of deadly weapon on vital part; time between intent and killing "immaterial"
- **MPC hook**: Under MPC §210.2(1)(a), Carroll's killing would be murder (purposely), but no first/second distinction
- **Policy**: Makes first-degree easy to prove; collapses degree distinction; prosecution-friendly

### State v. Guthrie (W.Va. 1995)
- **Facts**: Dishwasher with psychiatric disorders stabbed coworker in neck after coworker snapped him with dishtowel (teasing); convicted under "instant premeditation" jury instruction
- **Holding**: Reversed; rejected "instant premeditation"; must have "some period" for reflection between intent formation and killing
- **Rule**: Premeditation requires "opportunity for some reflection on the intention to kill after it is formed"; "instantaneous premeditation is a contradiction in terms"
- **MPC hook**: Under MPC §210.2(1)(a), Guthrie's killing would be murder (purposely), but no first/second distinction
- **Policy**: Creates meaningful distinction between calculated (first degree) and impulsive (second degree) killings; overturns prior "Schrader" doctrine

---

## 9) Policy / Theory Brief

### The Degree System: Rationale and Critique

**Why have degrees?**
1. **Proportionality**: Not all intentional killings are equally culpable
2. **Death penalty constraint**: Limit death to "worst of the worst"
3. **Deterrence**: Death penalty might deter calculated killers but not impulsive ones
4. **Moral gradation**: Society sees "cold-blooded" killing as worse than "crime of passion"

**Problems with degrees**:
1. **Line-drawing**: How much premeditation is enough? Seconds? Minutes? Hours?
2. **Jury confusion**: Instructions like "intent need exist only for an instant" collapse the distinction
3. **Arbitrary outcomes**: Similar fact patterns yield different degrees based on jury's view of timing
4. **Gaming the system**: Prosecutors can charge first degree to force plea; defense can argue lack of time for reflection

### MPC's Rejection of Degrees

**Why MPC rejects premeditation**:
1. **Focus on culpability**: Purpose/knowledge/depraved heart = more culpable than ordinary recklessness — that's the real distinction
2. **Time is misleading**: A "planned" killing after 3 days of cooling off might be less culpable than a "heat of passion" killing after 3 seconds of rage
3. **Sentencing flexibility**: Handle gradation through sentencing, not categorical labeling

**Counterargument**:
- MPC §210.2(1)(a) (purpose/knowledge) captures what first-degree murder traditionally meant
- MPC §210.3(1)(a) (recklessness) captures second-degree murder
- So MPC still has two levels — just doesn't call them "degrees"

### Balkin Pairs (Connection to Class 3)

**Individualist vs. Communalist arguments on premeditation**:

- **Individualist (defense)**:
  - Focus on defendant's actual mental state
  - Did D have time to reflect? Did D actually weigh the decision?
  - Protects "crimes of passion" from being labeled "cold-blooded"
  - Guthrie approach

- **Communalist (prosecution)**:
  - Focus on social harm and dangerousness
  - Intentional killing with deadly weapon = first-degree, regardless of reflection
  - Society needs to condemn all intentional killings as equally serious
  - Carroll approach

**Retributive vs. Utilitarian**:
- **Retributive**: First-degree should be reserved for most culpable (calculated killers) — Guthrie
- **Utilitarian**: Death penalty deters planned murders, so all intentional killings should be first-degree (to allow death penalty) — Carroll

---

## 10) Hypo Triggers (Practice)

### Hypo 1: The Bar Argument
D and V argue at bar for 20 minutes about who owes whom money. D is visibly angry, face red, shouting. D pulls out gun and shoots V in chest. D claims he "just snapped" and didn't think about it.

**Carroll analysis**: First-degree murder — intent to kill inferred from deadly weapon; 20-minute argument is "broad time frame" showing premeditation
**Guthrie analysis**: Second-degree murder — "just snapped" suggests no reflection period; impulsive, nonreflective killing
**MPC analysis**: Murder under §210.2(1)(a) — purposely killed

### Hypo 2: The Domestic Dispute
Husband and wife argue for 3 hours about divorce. Husband goes to kitchen, grabs knife, returns to living room, and stabs wife. He says "I don't know what came over me."

**Carroll**: First-degree — 3-hour argument + retrieving weapon from other room = premeditation
**Guthrie**: First-degree — leaving room to get knife is "reflection period"
**MPC**: Murder §210.2(1)(a) — purposely

### Hypo 3: The Sudden Fight
D and V exchange words in parking lot. V pushes D. D pulls gun from pocket and shoots V dead. Total time from push to shot: 2 seconds.

**Carroll**: Could be first-degree (intent to kill from deadly weapon)
**Guthrie**: Second-degree — 2 seconds = no reflection period; impulsive
**MPC**: Murder §210.2(1)(a) — purposely

---

## 11) Predictions (explicit + falsifiable)

### Likely covered in class:
- Deep dive on Carroll vs. Guthrie split — instant vs. reflection premeditation
- Hypotheticals testing "how much time is enough" for reflection
- Comparison of MPC §210.2 to common-law degrees
- Kelman time-framing applied to both cases

### Likely skipped:
- Detailed statutory history beyond Pennsylvania 1794
- Felony murder (covered in later class)
- Negligent homicide (MPC §210.4) — less emphasis

### Likely cold-call targets:
- "What's the difference between first and second degree murder?"
- "Was Carroll rightly decided? What if we apply Guthrie's rule?"
- "Does the MPC have premeditation?"
- "How much time is 'some period' for reflection under Guthrie?"

### Likely policy debate:
- Should death penalty be limited to "cold-blooded" killers (Guthrie) or available for all intentional killers (Carroll)?
- Is instant premeditation a "contradiction in terms"?
- Does the degree system create arbitrary distinctions?

### Likely exam angle / "what he wants you to learn":
- **Premeditation is malleable** — Carroll and Guthrie show you can argue either way
- **Time-framing is key** — where you draw the line of "the act" determines outcome (Kelman)
- **MPC rejects degrees** — focus on culpability levels (purpose/knowledge/recklessness) instead
- **Connection to mens rea** — §210.2 uses the four MPC mental states from Class 3
- **Exam strategy**: For any hypo, be prepared to argue both Carroll and Guthrie approaches

---

## 12) TA / Office Hours Questions (if any)
- Which states follow Carroll vs. Guthrie approach? (Majority follow Carroll/instant premeditation)
- For exam, should we assume we're in a Carroll or Guthrie jurisdiction unless told otherwise?
- How does MPC §210.2(1)(b) "extreme indifference" compare to common-law "depraved heart" murder?
- Does EMED (MPC §210.3(1)(b)) require "objective" reasonableness or "subjective" reasonableness? (Answer: Hybrid — "viewpoint of person in actor's situation" + "as actor believes circumstances to be")
