## 1) Just Mercy — Complete Summary

### Overview
Just Mercy chronicles Bryan Stevenson's career as founder of the Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), a legal aid organization defending the poor, wrongly convicted, and unfairly sentenced. The book centers on Walter McMillian, a Black Alabama man falsely convicted of murdering an 18-year-old white woman and sentenced to death despite remarkably flimsy evidence. With Stevenson's help, McMillian was eventually exonerated after 6 years on death row. Threaded throughout are stories of other clients: juveniles sentenced to life without parole, the mentally ill warehoused in prisons, women prosecuted for stillbirths, and death row inmates facing execution.

**Stevenson's Core Argument**: The American criminal justice system is stacked against the poor, disabled, and people of color. We cannot morally imprison for life or execute those who never stood a chance. "The true measure of our character is how we treat the poor, the disfavored, the accused, the incarcerated, and the condemned."

### The Walter McMillian Case (Central Narrative)

**Background**:
- Walter McMillian: Black businessman in Monroeville, Alabama (setting of To Kill a Mockingbird)
- Ronda Morrison: 18-year-old white woman found murdered at cleaners where she worked (November 1986)
- Months of failed investigation, no leads

**The Frame-Up**:
- Ralph Myers, prisoner held for different murder, claimed McMillian killed Morrison
- Myers couldn't even identify McMillian when police brought them face-to-face
- Only "evidence": Myers's accusation
- Motivation: McMillian had affair with white woman (Karen Kelly) in town where this was still outlawed by state constitution; hostility to interracial relationship + successful Black businessman = target

**Procedural Outrages**:
1. **Pre-trial detention on death row** (unprecedented): Sheriff Tate placed both Myers and McMillian on death row BEFORE trial to break Myers, force him to reaffirm accusations
2. **Manufactured evidence**:
   - Jailhouse snitch Bill Hooks claimed he saw McMillian's "low-rider" truck at crime scene
   - Hooks was promised release + reward money (later discovered)
   - Truck wasn't converted to low-rider until MONTHS after murder
3. **Ignored alibi**: Dozens of witnesses (including police officer with log book entry) confirmed McMillian was at fish fry at his house during murder
4. **Fabricated testimony**: Myers's story was "nonsensical" and kept changing
5. **All-white jury**: Nearly all-white jury took 3 hours to convict
6. **Jury override**: Jury recommended life; Judge Robert E. Lee Key overrode to impose death (judges do this to look "tough on crime" in elections)

**Stevenson's Investigation**:
- Myers eventually confessed: "Everything I said at McMillian's trial was a lie"
- Hooks was paid and immediately released after testifying
- Darnell Houston testified Hooks was working elsewhere during murder (prosecutor threw Houston in jail for perjury to intimidate him)
- Karen Kelly confirmed Myers was coerced
- 60 Minutes profile raised national attention
- Alabama Bureau of Investigation reviewed case: "There is no way Walter McMillian killed Ronda Morrison"

**Exoneration**: March 1993 — all charges dismissed after 6 years on death row

**Aftermath**:
- McMillian struggled to reintegrate; many in Monroeville still believed he was guilty
- Civil suit yielded only few hundred thousand dollars (immunity laws protect state actors)
- McMillian developed dementia, confused nursing home with death row
- Died in 2013

### Most Unjust Moments in Just Mercy

**Top candidates (choose what resonates most for Harcourt's Question #1)**:

1. **Pre-trial death row detention**: Sheriff Tate placed McMillian on death row before trial to psychologically torture him and coerce witnesses. Unprecedented, unconstitutional, purely punitive.

2. **Jury override for death**: Jury recommended life; judge overrode to death sentence to boost election chances. Political death sentence.

3. **Ignored alibi**: Dozens of witnesses + police log confirmed McMillian's whereabouts. Prosecutors simply ignored it. Truth didn't matter.

4. **Paid/coerced witnesses**: State paid Hooks, coerced Myers, jailed Houston for telling truth. System manufactured evidence.

5. **Charlie (Chapter 6)**: 14-year-old boy jailed in adult facility for killing mother's abusive boyfriend (who was cop), repeatedly raped by adult inmates while awaiting trial. System destroyed a child.

6. **Trina Garnett (Chapter 8)**: 14-year-old girl accidentally set fire that killed two boys, sentenced to life without parole, raped by guard in prison, gave birth in shackles, baby taken away.

7. **Herbert Richardson (Chapter 4)**: Traumatized Vietnam vet built bomb to "rescue" ex-girlfriend (win her back); accidentally killed her niece; executed despite no intent to kill, clear mental illness from war trauma.

8. **Joe Sullivan (Chapter 14)**: 13-year-old sentenced to life for rape he likely didn't commit, sexually abused in prison, developed MS from trauma, confined to wheelchair, still in prison decades later.

### Stevenson's Concept of "Just Mercy" (Harcourt Question #2)

**"Just Mercy" has multiple meanings**:

1. **"Just" as "simply"**: Mercy, plain and simple. Not mercy with conditions or limits. Unconditional compassion.

2. **"Just" as "justice"**: Mercy is not opposed to justice but is part of it. True justice requires mercy. A system that lacks mercy cannot be just.

3. **Recognition of shared brokenness**: "We are all broken by something. We have all hurt someone and have been hurt. We all share the condition of brokenness." (From Chapter 15) Mercy means acknowledging our common humanity.

4. **Redemption vs. retribution**: System focused solely on retribution misses possibility of redemption. "Just mercy" means creating space for people to be more than the worst thing they've ever done.

**Key quote (Epilogue)**: "In the end, it was just mercy towards others that allowed him [McMillian] to recover a life worth celebrating."

**The paradox**: How do you reconcile mercy with justice? Stevenson argues they're not in tension — a system without mercy is inherently unjust because it denies humanity, ignores context (poverty, abuse, mental illness, racism), and destroys rather than redeems.

### Criticisms of Just Mercy (Harcourt Question #3)

**Possible angles (argue the counterpoint)**:

1. **One-sided**: Only tells defendants' stories, not victims'. What about Ronda Morrison's family? The children killed in fires? Focuses on innocence (McMillian) and tragic circumstances (juveniles) but what about the simply guilty?

2. **Conflates innocence with mitigation**: Mixes actually innocent people (McMillian) with guilty-but-sympathetic (Herbert Richardson, juveniles). These require different responses. Innocence demands exoneration; guilt with mitigation demands proportional punishment, not abolition.

3. **Lacks structural solutions**: Powerful narrative but light on concrete policy. What specifically should change? Abolish death penalty (he'd say yes)? Eliminate life without parole for juveniles (Supreme Court did this)? But then what? How do we actually fix the system?

4. **Ignores public safety**: Does mercy mean no consequences? What about deterrence? What about dangerous people who will reoffend? The book focuses on tragic cases but doesn't grapple with truly incorrigible offenders.

5. **Emotional manipulation**: Uses heartbreaking stories to bypass rational analysis. Appeals to sympathy rather than rigorous policy argument. Effective advocacy, but is it good policymaking?

6. **Class/race reductionism**: Attributes all injustice to poverty and racism. But some poor people and people of color commit serious crimes. Does focusing on system failures deny individual responsibility?

**The strongest criticism**: Stevenson doesn't fully grapple with the tension between mercy and accountability. If everyone is "broken," if everyone deserves mercy, what does justice for victims look like? How do we deter crime? When is punishment ever justified?

## 2) Four Questions — My Prepared Answers

### Q1: What is the most unjust fact/phenomenon in Just Mercy? What was the moment that upset you most?

**My answer**: [Choose one and elaborate — here are options]

**Option A (procedural outrage)**: The most unjust moment was Sheriff Tate placing Walter McMillian on death row BEFORE his trial. This wasn't just procedurally irregular—it was psychological torture designed to break witnesses and coerce confessions. McMillian spent 18 months on death row without a conviction. The state used the death row itself as a weapon. This wasn't about justice or even a mistake—it was deliberate, calculated cruelty to manufacture a conviction. It shows the system can be weaponized against the innocent.

**Option B (systemic failure)**: The most unjust phenomenon was the entire McMillian case showing that truth didn't matter. Dozens of alibi witnesses, including a police officer with written documentation—ignored. Manufactured evidence—rewarded. Coerced witnesses—embraced. The prosecutor and judge knew the case was garbage, but McMillian was convicted anyway because he was a Black man who'd had an affair with a white woman. The system worked exactly as designed: to punish the "transgressive" Black man, regardless of actual guilt.

**Option C (children destroyed)**: The most upsetting moment was 14-year-old Charlie being repeatedly raped in adult jail while awaiting trial for killing his abusive stepfather. Charlie was tiny, terrified, catatonic with fear. The system put a child in an adult facility where sexual assault was inevitable. Then Stevenson had to fight just to get him moved. The state destroyed a child who'd defended his mother from a violent cop. That's not justice—it's compounding trauma with more trauma.

**Option D (death without intent)**: Herbert Richardson's execution upset me most. He was a traumatized Vietnam vet who built a bomb trying to "rescue" his ex-girlfriend to win her back (deeply misguided). The bomb killed her niece—horrible, tragic. But Richardson had no intent to kill anyone. He was mentally ill from war trauma. Instead of treatment, the state executed him. We sent him to war, it broke him, and then we killed him for being broken.

### Q2: What is Stevenson's idea of "just mercy"?

**My answer**: Stevenson's "just mercy" operates on two levels. First, "just" means "simply"—mercy without conditions. But second, and more importantly, "just" connects to justice. Stevenson argues mercy is not opposed to justice but essential to it. True justice requires recognizing our shared humanity and brokenness. He writes, "We are all broken by something." A legal system that lacks mercy—that treats people as nothing more than their worst act—is inherently unjust because it denies this fundamental truth about humanity. "Just mercy" means creating a system that can hold people accountable while still seeing them as human, capable of redemption. It's not about excusing crime; it's about refusing to destroy people in response to it. Without mercy, justice becomes pure retribution, and retribution without limit is vengeance.

### Q3: Greatest criticism of Just Mercy?

**My answer**: My biggest criticism is that Stevenson conflates very different types of cases without acknowledging the distinctions. Walter McMillian was actually innocent—that's a system failure requiring exoneration and compensation. But Herbert Richardson, Trina Garnett, and the juveniles were guilty. Their cases involve mitigation (trauma, mental illness, age, lack of intent), which argues for lesser punishment, not for no punishment. By weaving innocent and guilty-but-sympathetic cases together, Stevenson makes a powerful emotional appeal but obscures the harder policy questions. What should happen to guilty people with terrible circumstances? How much do poverty, abuse, and mental illness reduce culpability? Where's the line? The book is stronger on what's wrong (mass incarceration, racial bias, excessive punishment) than on what's right. If we abolished death penalty and life without parole for juveniles tomorrow, then what? Stevenson doesn't give us a clear alternative punishment framework—just an imperative for mercy. That's powerful advocacy but incomplete policy.

###Q4: How do I define justice? (One sentence)

**My answer**: [Craft your own, but here are examples]

**Utilitarian-leaning**: Justice is a system that minimizes harm to both victims and offenders by holding people accountable in ways that promote rehabilitation and community safety without destroying human potential.

**Retributive-leaning**: Justice is proportional accountability—people who choose to harm others deserve punishment that reflects the severity of their wrong and the degree of their culpability.

**Mercy-focused**: Justice is a response to wrongdoing that recognizes the humanity of all involved, seeks to repair harm where possible, and refuses to abandon hope for redemption.

**Process-focused**: Justice is fair procedures applied equally regardless of race, class, or power—a system where truth matters more than politics and rights are protected for everyone.

**Hybrid**: Justice is a system that holds people accountable for their choices while recognizing that those choices are shaped by circumstances, with punishment proportional to both culpability and harm, and mercy embedded in recognition of our shared imperfection.

**Restorative**: Justice is a process that centers victims' needs for healing while offering offenders pathways to repair harm, take responsibility, and rebuild their place in community.

## 3) Criminal Justice Process — KSSB Pages 1-19 Summary

### America's Mass Incarceration Crisis

**The Numbers**:
- **2.2 million people** incarcerated in US (prisons + jails)
- **6.9 million** under correctional supervision (including probation, parole)
- **1 in 31 adults** has criminal record
- **1 in 17 people** born in 2001 expected to go to prison/jail sometime in life

**Not evenly distributed — extreme racial concentration**:
- African Americans are **13.4% of population** but **33% of incarcerated**
- **1 in 3 Black men** has felony conviction
- Black adults **5.9 times more likely** to be incarcerated than white adults
- In D.C., **75% of Black men** can expect incarceration at some point
- **1 in 3 Black men** born today can expect imprisonment (vs. 6% of white men)
- **1 in 6 Hispanic men** expected to serve prison time
- Black men receive sentences **19.1% longer** than similarly situated white men

**How did this happen?**:
- **NOT primarily rising crime**: Crime spiked in 1970s-80s but continued falling through 1990s-2000s while incarceration kept rising
- **Policy choices**: "Three strikes" laws, mandatory minimums, elimination of parole, trying children as adults, war on drugs
- **Drug law enforcement**: Targeted Black communities despite equal/lower drug use rates than whites
- **Punitive political climate**: Judges elected on "tough on crime" platforms; prosecutors seek longer sentences; legislators compete to increase penalties

**Consequences**:
- **Criminogenic effects**: Long sentences make reentry harder, increase recidivism
- **Family destruction**: 2.1 million children have incarcerated fathers (3% of all US children)
- **Community devastation**: Poorest neighborhoods see constant cycle of incarceration and return
- **Collateral consequences**: Loss of voting rights, employment barriers, housing restrictions, public benefit denials
- **Mental health crisis**: 50%+ of inmates have mental illness (vs. 10% general population); prisons became warehouses for mentally ill after psychiatric institutions closed
- **Foster care pipeline**: 70% of California prisoners are former foster youth

**National Research Council conclusion**: "The United States has gone past the point where the numbers of people in prison can be justified by social benefits. The high rates of incarceration themselves constitute a source of injustice and, possibly, social harm."

### Underenforcement vs. Overenforcement Paradox

**The tension**: How can communities be simultaneously over-policed and under-policed?

**Overenforcement**: Mass incarceration, excessive sentences, racial disparities in arrest/prosecution
**Underenforcement**: Failure to protect vulnerable communities from crime

**Examples of underenforcement**:
- Domestic violence and sexual assault often not seriously investigated/prosecuted
- Inner-city Black-on-black homicides receive less investigative resources
- Hate crimes against marginalized groups sometimes ignored
- Financial crimes by wealthy/corporate actors rarely prosecuted (2008 crisis)
- Police violence against civilians goes unpunished

**Alexandra Natapoff's argument**: Both are symptoms of same problem—system's non-responsiveness to needs of poor, racial minorities, politically vulnerable. "Justice and lawfulness are distributed unevenly across racial and class lines."

**The dilemma**: Calls to defund police/reduce incarceration risk increasing underenforcement in already under-protected communities. Some residents "equate public safety with more policing" even while experiencing overpolicing.

**Harcourt's question**: Can we strengthen enforcement fairly without expanding carceral state? Can we treat everyone as well as wealthy are treated, or will push for equality mean harsh treatment wins out for all?

### Basic Criminal Justice Process (Stages)

1. **Investigation**: Police gather evidence
2. **Arrest**: Formal custody (requires probable cause)
3. **Initial appearance/arraignment**: First court appearance within 24-48 hours; charges read; bail set
4. **Grand jury** (or preliminary hearing): Determines probable cause; issues indictment (formal charges)
5. **Arraignment** (post-indictment): Defendant enters plea (guilty, not guilty, no contest)
6. **Pre-trial motions**: Suppress evidence, dismiss charges, change venue, etc.
7. **Plea bargaining**: ~95% of cases resolve via plea (no trial)
8. **Trial** (if no plea): Jury or bench trial; prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt
9. **Sentencing**: Judge imposes punishment (often constrained by mandatory minimums)
10. **Appeal**: Defendant can appeal legal errors (not factual findings)
11. **Post-conviction relief**: Habeas corpus, clemency, pardon

**Capital case additions**:
- Automatic appeal to state supreme court
- State post-conviction proceedings
- Federal habeas corpus (can take years)
- Clemency hearing before execution
- Timeline: Often 10-20+ years from conviction to execution
- High error rate: Liebman study found ~68% of capital cases reversed on appeal

**Key concepts**:
- **Burden of proof**: Beyond reasonable doubt (criminal) vs. preponderance of evidence (civil)
- **Presumption of innocence**: Defendant doesn't have to prove anything
- **Right to counsel**: Gideon v. Wainwright (1963) guaranteed, but quality varies wildly (as McMillian shows)
- **Prosecutorial discretion**: Enormous power to decide charges, plea offers; little oversight
- **Judicial review on appeal**: Courts review legal errors, not factual determinations (appeals courts defer to trial court's factual findings)

## 4) Punishment Theories (Introduction from KSSB)

### Two Main Categories

**Retributive ("Backward-Looking")**:
- Punishment justified because people deserve it
- Focuses on moral blameworthiness of past behavior
- "Just deserts" — punishment proportional to culpability
- NOT about consequences (deterrence, prevention) but about justice/fairness

**Utilitarian/Consequentialist ("Forward-Looking")**:
- Punishment justified by useful purposes it serves
- Three main goals:
  1. **Deterrence**: General (deter others) and specific (deter this offender)
  2. **Incapacitation**: Remove dangerous people from society
  3. **Rehabilitation**: Reform offender so they don't reoffend

**Key tension**: Retribution asks "What does this person deserve based on what they did?" Utilitarianism asks "What punishment will produce best consequences going forward?"

**Example (Regina v. Dudley & Stephens)**: Sailors stranded at sea, starving, kill and eat cabin boy to survive, rescued 4 days later.
- **Utilitarian argument**: Punishing them serves no purpose (won't deter future shipwrecks; they're not dangerous; no rehabilitation needed). Executing them is wasteful.
- **Retributive argument**: They deliberately killed innocent boy. Murder is murder. Law must uphold principle that you cannot kill innocent to save yourself, regardless of circumstances.
- **Court's holding**: Guilty of murder; sentenced to death (later commuted). Retributive reasoning: "To preserve one's life is generally a duty, but it may be the plainest duty to sacrifice it." Necessity is not a defense to murder of innocent.

## 5) How Just Mercy Illustrates Criminal Justice Failures

**At every stage, McMillian's case shows system failures**:

### Investigation
- **What should happen**: Follow evidence objectively
- **What happened**: Sheriff Tate under political pressure to solve high-profile white victim case; targeted Black man in interracial relationship despite no evidence

### Arrest
- **What should happen**: Probable cause based on evidence
- **What happened**: Arrested on fabricated sodomy charge (pretext); only "evidence" was coerced witness who couldn't identify him

### Pre-trial detention
- **What should happen**: Jail or bail pending trial; death row only after conviction
- **What happened**: Placed on death row pre-trial to psychologically torture him and break witnesses

### Grand jury/indictment
- **What should happen**: Independent review of whether probable cause exists
- **What happened**: Presented only Myers's coerced testimony; withheld alibi evidence

### Right to counsel
- **What should happen**: Competent defense attorney investigates, calls alibi witnesses
- **What happened**: Court-appointed lawyer did minimal investigation; alibi witnesses available but not effectively used at trial

### Trial
- **What should happen**: Jury hears all evidence, weighs credibility, convicts only if proof beyond reasonable doubt
- **What happened**: Nearly all-white jury; prosecution withheld exculpatory evidence (that Hooks was paid, that witnesses were coerced); defense couldn't access police records; jury took only 3 hours despite dozens of alibi witnesses

### Sentencing
- **What should happen**: Jury's sentencing recommendation followed
- **What happened**: Jury recommended life; judge overrode to death for political reasons (election)

### Appeal
- **What should happen**: Appellate courts review for legal errors, reverse if constitutional violations
- **What happened**: Initial appeals denied despite clear Brady violations (prosecution hiding exculpatory evidence), coerced testimony, manufactured evidence

### Post-conviction relief
- **What should happen**: Meaningful review when new evidence emerges
- **What happened**: Took 60 Minutes national exposure, Alabama Bureau of Investigation reversal, and years of EJI work to finally get charges dismissed

**The lesson**: Process matters. Rights on paper mean nothing without enforcement. McMillian had constitutional rights at every stage—they were simply ignored because he was poor, Black, and politically powerless.

## 6) Cold Call Preparation

**If called on Just Mercy**:
- **Justice definition**: [Use my answer from Q4]
- **Most unjust moment**: [Use my answer from Q1 — have specific example ready]
- **Stevenson's thesis**: "Just mercy" means recognizing our shared brokenness and building justice system that includes mercy as essential component, not luxury. Without mercy, system becomes pure retribution, which is vengeance.
- **Connection to course**: This book frames semester's central tension: Is criminal law about retribution or redemption? Can we have both? How do we measure justice—by punishment severity or by fairness of process? By what's deserved or what's useful?

**If called on criminal justice process**:
- **Basic stages**: Arrest → initial appearance → grand jury → trial → sentencing → appeal
- **McMillian example**: System failed at literally every stage (describe 2-3 specific failures)
- **Mass incarceration stats**: 2.2 million incarcerated, extreme racial disparity (Black adults 5.9x more likely than whites), NOT explained by crime rates but by policy choices

**If called on punishment theories**:
- **Retribution**: Backward-looking, desert-based, punishment because deserved
- **Utilitarian**: Forward-looking, consequence-based, punishment to deter/incapacitate/rehabilitate
- **Just Mercy's critique**: Current system claims to be about both but actually serves neither—doesn't deter (recidivism high), doesn't rehabilitate (prisons make people worse), gives disproportionate punishment (not desert), and destroys rather than protects communities

## 7) Predictions for Class Discussion

**Likely topics**:
- Multiple students asked for their justice definition (Q4) — Harcourt will compare/contrast
- Debate: Is mercy compatible with justice or opposed to it?
- McMillian case timeline: What specifically went wrong and why?
- "How could this happen?" — systemic explanations vs. individual bad actors
- Mass incarceration statistics and racial disparities
- Underenforcement vs. overenforcement paradox
- Stevenson's solutions (or lack thereof) — what should we do?

**Likely Harcourt provocations**:
- "If McMillian was innocent, what about the guilty ones Stevenson represents? Do they deserve mercy too?"
- "Stevenson says we're all broken. Does that mean no one is responsible for anything?"
- "Should we abolish the death penalty? Life without parole? Where do you draw the line?"
- "Is the problem the law itself or just its application? Could the system work if we just enforced rights better?"
- "Justice for whom? Defendants or victims?"

**Likely cold-call questions**:
- "Define justice in one sentence."
- "What upset you most in Just Mercy?"
- "Is Stevenson right? Is mercy part of justice?"
- "Can you defend the prosecutors in McMillian's case? What might they say?"
- "Why do we punish? What's the point?"

## 8) Connections to Course Themes

### Class 1 sets up semester-long tensions:

**1. Doctrine vs. Justice**:
- We'll learn "correct" application of criminal law doctrines (actus reus, mens rea, defenses, etc.)
- But Just Mercy shows law can be "correctly" applied and still produce horrific injustice
- Question throughout: When does following the law produce injustice? When should we?

**2. Retribution vs. Utilitarianism**:
- Punishment theories frame every doctrinal question
- Should felony murder liability exist? (Retribution: yes if culpable. Utilitarian: only if deters.)
- Should we have heat of passion mitigation? (Retribution: reduces desert. Utilitarian: may or may not deter.)

**3. Individual Responsibility vs. Structural Context**:
- Criminal law traditionally focuses on individual choice and culpability
- But Stevenson (and mass incarceration data) shows poverty, racism, mental illness, childhood trauma massively shape outcomes
- How much should law account for structural disadvantage?

**4. CLS Theme ("Lawyers Ply the Law")**:
- Syllabus says "all practicing lawyers worth their salt will ply the law in their client's direction"
- Just Mercy shows this cuts both ways: Stevenson plies law to save McMillian; prosecutors plied law to convict him
- Criminal law is malleable, not neutral—its application reflects power, not just rules

**5. Process vs. Substance**:
- McMillian had rights on paper—they meant nothing
- Question: Is justice about correct procedures or correct outcomes? Can we have one without the other?

## 9) Personal Reflection Space

**My definition of justice (to revisit throughout semester)**:
[Write yours here based on Q4]

**What role should mercy play in criminal law?**:
[Write initial thoughts — will these change?]

**What am I most concerned about in studying criminal law?**:
[E.g., Will I become desensitized to injustice? Will I learn to manipulate doctrine without caring about real-world impact? How do I reconcile advocacy for clients with pursuit of justice?]

**After Class — Reflection Questions**:
- Did my definition hold up in discussion?
- What surprised me?
- What do I want to explore further?
- Did Harcourt reveal his own view of justice?

## 10) Key Quotes for Discussion

**From Just Mercy**:
1. "The true measure of our character is how we treat the poor, the disfavored, the accused, the incarcerated, and the condemned."
2. "We are all broken by something. We have all hurt someone and have been hurt."
3. "Each of us is more than the worst thing we've ever done."
4. "Capital punishment means 'them without the capital get the punishment.'" (Steve Bright, SPDC director)
5. "In the end, it was just mercy towards others that allowed him to recover a life worth celebrating."
6. "I decided that I was supposed to be here to catch some of the stones people cast at each other." (Elderly woman at courthouse, referencing Bible parable)

**From KSSB (Mass Incarceration)**:
1. National Research Council: "We believe that the high rates of incarceration themselves constitute a source of injustice and, possibly, social harm."
2. David Garland: "Imprisonment becomes mass imprisonment when it ceases to be the incarceration of individual offenders and becomes the systematic imprisonment of whole groups of the population."

**From Regina v. Dudley & Stephens (Punishment)**:
1. "To preserve one's life is generally speaking a duty, but it may be the plainest and the highest duty to sacrifice it."
2. "Who is to be the judge of this sort of necessity? By what measure is the comparative value of lives to be measured?"
3. "We are often compelled to set up standards we cannot reach ourselves, and to lay down rules which we could not ourselves satisfy."
