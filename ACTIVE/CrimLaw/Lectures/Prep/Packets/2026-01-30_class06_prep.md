# Prep Packet — Class #6 — 2026-01-30 — Felony Murder

## 0) Outcome Targets (5 minutes)
- By the end of prep, I can: (1) define the felony murder rule and identify its elements; (2) distinguish agency theory from proximate cause theory; (3) explain the reasoning in Serné, Stamp, and Canola; (4) analyze whether felony murder is strict liability or implied malice; (5) discuss the real-world impact of felony murder laws using Stillman/Adnan Khan examples; (6) argue both prosecution and defense positions on felony murder hypothetics.

## 1) Assignment Snapshot
- **Syllabus extract**: `Admin/Syllabus/Assignments/2026-01-30_class06.md`
- **Reading triage** (Harcourt):
  - **Cases**: Serné (foundational statement of felony murder + judge's skepticism), Stamp (strict liability application), Canola (agency vs. proximate cause split on co-felon deaths)
  - **Real-world materials**: Stillman New Yorker article, Adnan Khan video — **essential** for understanding human impact
  - **Policy focus**: Felony murder is widely criticized — why does it persist? Who benefits/harmed?

## 2) Felony Murder Rule — Basic Definition

### What is Felony Murder?
- A person commits **murder** if a death occurs during the commission of a **felony**, even if the death was:
  - Accidental
  - Unintentional
  - Not caused by defendant
  - Not foreseeable

### Traditional Elements (Common Law)
1. **Death of a person** occurred
2. **During commission** (or immediate flight from) of a **felony**
3. Defendant was **participating** in the felony
4. Death was **causally connected** to the felony (some jurisdictions add: "in furtherance of")

### No Mens Rea Required for the Killing
- Defendant only needs mens rea for the underlying felony
- **No intent to kill** required
- No recklessness with respect to death required
- This is why felony murder is called "strict liability" for murder

### Underlying Felonies
Traditionally limited to **"dangerous felonies"**:
- Arson
- Burglary
- Robbery
- Rape
- Kidnapping
- (Some jurisdictions add: escape, sodomy, etc.)

MPC §210.2(1)(b) uses same list.

---

## 3) The Two Great Theories: Agency vs. Proximate Cause

### Agency Theory (Majority Rule)
**Liability**: Felon is liable for murder ONLY if the killing is done by:
- The felon themselves, OR
- An accomplice/confederate in the felony

**Not liable** if killed by:
- Victim (self-defense)
- Police officer
- Bystander
- Non-participant

**Rationale**:
- Felony murder requires act of killing by felon or agent
- "Agency" = felon or those acting for them
- Doesn't extend to third parties resisting the felony

**Jurisdictions**: Majority of American states

### Proximate Cause Theory (Minority Rule)
**Liability**: Felon is liable for ANY death that is a foreseeable result of the felony, even if killed by:
- Victim acting in self-defense
- Police officer
- Bystander
- Another felon

**Key question**: Was the death a foreseeable/proximate result of committing the felony?

**Rationale**:
- Felony murder is about holding felons accountable for all consequences of their criminal conduct
- Tort law proximate cause principles apply

**Jurisdictions**: New York, Pennsylvania (historically), California (implied malice variant)

**Hybrid approaches**: Some statutes use "in furtherance of" language (e.g., NY, NJ) that courts interpret differently

---

## 4) Minimal Case Cards (co-primary)

### Regina v. Serné (England, 1887) — Foundational Statement

**Facts (30 seconds)**:
- Serné and Goldfinch insured life of Serné's imbecile son (Sjaak, 14) for £700 and stock/furniture for £700
- Set fire to their home/shop at 274 Strand with family inside (wife, 2 daughters, 2 sons)
- Fires set in multiple locations simultaneously using inflammable materials
- Wife, daughters, and Goldfinch escaped; both sons burned to death
- Serné claimed he hoped family would escape

**Holding / Rule**:
- **Acquitted** (jury didn't buy prosecution case)
- But Judge Stephen's jury instruction is the key statement of felony murder doctrine:
  - **"Malice aforethought"** (technical term) includes:
    1. **Intent to kill**
    2. **Intent to commit felony** that causes death
    3. **Knowledge that act will probably cause death**

**Key language** (Judge Stephen):
> "The definition of murder is unlawful homicide with malice aforethought, and the words malice aforethought are technical... One of those meanings is, the killing of another person by an act done with an intent to commit a felony."

> "It would be reasonable to say that any act known to be dangerous to life and likely in itself to cause death, done for the purpose of committing a felony which causes death, should be murder."

> "If a person chose, for some wicked purpose of his own to sink a boat at sea, and thereby caused the deaths of the occupants, it matters nothing whether at the time of committing the act he hoped that the people would be picked up by a passing vessel. He is as much guilty of murder if the people are drowned, as if he had flung every person into the water with his own hand."

**Judge Stephen's skepticism**:
> "I very much doubt whether the definition which I have given, although it is the common definition, is not somewhat too wide."
>
> "The mere words cover a case like this, that is to say, a case where a man gives another a push with an intention of stealing his watch, and the person so pushed, having a weak heart or some other internal disorder, dies."
>
> "I very much doubt, however, whether that is really the law."

**Policy hook**:
- Judge Stephen narrows doctrine to **"act known to be dangerous to life and likely in itself to cause death"** — not any felony
- Rejects "push to steal watch" hypothetical as too broad
- Distinguishes **dangerous felonies** (arson, rape with choking) from minor felonies
- Foretells modern criticism that felony murder is overbroad

**MPC hook**:
- MPC §210.2(1)(b) captures Stephen's concern: only felonies that create "extreme indifference to value of human life" (arson, robbery, rape, burglary, kidnapping)
- Minor felonies don't trigger felony murder under MPC

---

### People v. Stamp (California, 1969) — Strict Liability Applied

**Facts (30 seconds)**:
- Stamp burglarized Honeyman's business, robbed him at gunpoint
- Required Honeyman (60, obese, history of heart disease) to lie on floor for 10 minutes
- After Stamp fled, Honeyman suffered chest pains, collapsed, died of **heart attack**
- Doctors: "fright induced by the robbery was too much of a shock to Honeyman's system"

**Holding / Rule**:
- Felony murder conviction upheld
- **Strict liability**: Felon liable for ALL killings in course of felony, **whether or not death was foreseeable**
- "**Robber takes victim as he finds him**" — if victim has heart condition, robber liable for heart attack
- Only limitation: victim's condition can't be "only substantial factor" causing death

**Key language**:
> "The [felony-murder] doctrine is not limited to those deaths which are foreseeable. Rather a felon is held strictly liable for all killings committed by him or his accomplices in the course of the felony."

> "As long as a victim's predisposing physical condition, regardless of its cause, is not the only substantial factor bringing about his death, that condition and the robber's ignorance of it, in no way destroys the robber's criminal responsibility for the death."

> "So long as life is shortened as a result of the felonious act it does not matter that the victim might have died soon anyway."

**Policy hook**:
- **Maximum liability** — no mens rea for death required
- **Deterrence rationale**: Put felons on notice — if you commit violent felony, you're responsible for any death
- **Criticism**: Punishes robber for victim's heart condition he couldn't have known about — seems unfair

**Contrast with Serné**:
- Judge Stephen doubted "push to steal watch" would be murder (unforeseeable death)
- Stamp adopts broad rule — even unforeseeable deaths count
- U.S. law expanded beyond English judge's more cautious approach

---

### State v. Canola (New Jersey, 1977) — Agency vs. Proximate Cause Split

**Facts (30 seconds)**:
- Four robbers (including Canola and Lloredo) committed armed robbery of jewelry store
- Store owner resisted, physical skirmish with one robber
- Canola (second robber) "called upon for assistance, began shooting"
- Store owner returned gunfire
- **Both owner and Lloredo (co-felon) killed** — Lloredo shot by owner's gun

**Holding / Rule**:
- **Murder conviction for co-felon's death REVERSED**; conviction for owner's death upheld
- **Adopts agency theory**: Felony murder applies only if killing done by felon or confederate
- **Rejects proximate cause theory** for co-felon killed by victim
- Co-felon killing by victim is **justifiable homicide** — outside felony murder rule

**Agency theory** (traditional):
- "Killing must have been done by the defendant or by an accomplice or confederate or by one acting in furtherance of the felonious undertaking"
- Limited to situations where felon or confederate does actual killing

**Proximate cause theory** (rejected):
- Would attach liability for ANY death proximately resulting from unlawful activity — even co-felon
- Pennsylvania adopted in *Commonwealth v. Almeida* (cop killed by other cops)
- Pennsylvania overruled Almeida in *Commonwealth ex rel. Smith v. Myers* (1970)

**"Shield cases" distinguished**:
- If felons use victim as **human shield** (Taylor, Keaton cases), liable for victim's death
- This is "express malice" — distinct from felony murder

**Key language**:
> "Most modern progressive thought in criminal jurisprudence favors restriction rather than expansion of the felony-murder rule. Although the rule was logical at its inception, when all felonies were punishable by death, its survival to modern times when other felonies are not thought to be as blameworthy as premeditated killings is discordant with rational and enlightened views of criminal culpability and liability."

> "Tort concepts of foreseeability and proximate cause have shallow relevance to culpability for murder in the first degree. Gradations of criminal liability should accord with the degree of moral culpability for the actor's conduct."

**Concurrence (Sullivan, J.)**:
- Would adopt **proximate cause theory** for deaths of innocent victims and police
- Only exception: co-felon deaths (justifiable homicide)
- Argues legislative intent was broader than majority's reading

**Policy hook**:
- **Majority (Conford)**: Felony murder already overbroad; don't expand to co-felons killed by victims
- **Dissent (Sullivan)**: Absurd result — felon gets "free pass" if victim kills cop or bystander, as long as felon's confederate didn't pull trigger
- **Real-world impact**: Majority rule creates perverse incentive — felons might hope victim kills co-felons to avoid murder charge?

**Legislative response**:
- New Jersey later amended statute to adopt Sullivan's position (proximate cause with co-felon exception)
- Shows courts can't always fix bad policy — legislature may step in

## 5) The "Who Does the Killing?" Problem — Detailed Analysis

### Scenario Matrix

| Killer | Agency Theory | Proximate Cause Theory |
|--------|---------------|------------------------|
| Felon themselves | ✅ Liable | ✅ Liable |
| Co-felon/accomplice | ✅ Liable | ✅ Liable |
| Victim (self-defense) | ❌ Not liable | ✅ Liable |
| Police officer | ❌ Not liable | ✅ Liable |
| Bystander | ❌ Not liable | ✅ Liable (if foreseeable) |
| Co-felon killed by victim | ❌ Not liable (Canola) | ✅ Liable (Almeida) |

### Why Different Outcomes?

**Agency theory rationale**:
- Felony murder requires felon's **agency** — felon or their agents must do killing
- If victim kills co-felon in self-defense, that's victim's agency, not felon's
- Protects felons from liability for things they didn't do

**Proximate cause theory rationale**:
- Felony murder is about holding felons accountable for **risks they create**
- If you commit violent felony, you're responsible for all foreseeable consequences
- Including victim defending themselves, police intervening, etc.

### "Shield Cases" Exception
- If felons use victim as **human shield** to block gunfire
- Victim killed by police fire — felons liable (even under agency theory)
- Rationale: This is "express malice" — felon actively places victim in danger
- Distinct from typical felony murder

### "Implied Malice" Alternative (California)
- Some courts use **depraved heart murder** instead of felony murder for killings by third parties
- *People v. Gilbert* (1966): If robber shoots at victim, victim shoots back and kills co-felon, robber liable under **implied malice**, not felony murder
- Rationale: Robber's intentional shooting shows "conscious disregard for life"
- Result same, doctrinal path different

## 6) Policy / Theory Brief

### Why Felony Murder Exists — Historical & Modern Rationales

**Historical origin**:
- Developed when **all felonies** were punishable by death
- If felony = death penalty, then accidental death during felony shouldn't reduce punishment
- Made sense when felonies were inherently grave crimes

**Modern rationales**:

1. **Deterrence**:
   - Felons will be more careful if they know any death triggers murder liability
   - Counterargument: Felons don't think about legal rules in the moment

2. **Individual culpability**:
   - Anyone who commits dangerous felony shows such disregard for human life that they deserve murder liability
   - Counterargument: Robber doesn't intend to kill and may be horrified by death

3. **Punishment proportionality**:
   - If you're willing to commit armed robbery, you're culpable enough for murder when things go wrong
   - Counterargument: Things going wrong isn't the same as choosing to kill

### Criticisms of Felony Murder

**1. No mens rea for killing**:
- Violates core principle that culpability requires guilty mind
- Stamp case: Robber liable for heart attack he couldn't foresee
- Serné hypothetical: Push to steal watch resulting in heart attack

**2. Overbreadth**:
- Minor felonies can trigger murder liability in some jurisdictions (burglary, not just violent felonies)
- Felon "takes victim as he finds him" — liable for hidden conditions

**3. Arbitrary outcomes**:
- Two identical robberies: one victim lives, one dies of heart attack
- Felon's moral blameworthiness identical, but charges differ wildly
- Random chance of medical condition shouldn't determine murder vs. robbery

**4. Racial disparity**:
- Felony murder disproportionately punishes people of color
- Adnan Khan case: Young man of color sentenced to life for felony murder when he didn't kill anyone
- Real-world materials show this is not theoretical

**5. Perverse incentives**:
- Under Canola agency theory: Felon better off if victim kills co-felon (no murder liability) than if co-felon kills victim (murder liability)
- Doesn't make moral sense

### Defenses of Felony Murder

**1. Felon creates the risk**:
- But-for the felony, no death would occur
- Felon is "but-for cause" of entire situation

**2. Moral blameworthiness**:
- Armed robbery, rape, kidnapping show such disregard for human life that any death isfelon's moral responsibility
- Even if accidental, felon chose to create dangerous situation

**3. Practical enforcement**:
- Eliminates need to prove who fired fatal shot in group crimes
- Easier prosecution — just prove felony + death + causal connection

**4. Legislative choice**:
- If legislature wants this rule, courts should apply it
- Policy objections are for legislature, not courts

### Real-World Impact (Stillman, Adnan Khan)

**Sarah Stillman, "Sentenced to Life for an Accident Miles Away"** (New Yorker, 2023):
- Documents cases of people sentenced to life for felony murder when they:
  - Didn't kill anyone
  - Weren't present at the scene of death
  - Didn't intend any harm
- Example: Driver in getaway car miles away when accomplice accidentally shoots someone
- Felony murder allows **murder conviction without mens rea for killing**

**Adnan Khan case**:
- Young man involved in robbery where accomplice killed someone
- Sentenced to **life without parole** for felony murder
- Khan didn't kill anyone, may not have even known accomplice was armed
- **Marshall Project / NYT video**: Shows human face of harsh doctrine
- Raises questions: Is this justice? Should we abolish felony murder?

## 7) MPC Approach — § 210.2(1)(b)

**Text**:
> Murder occurs when homicide is "committed recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life. Such recklessness and indifference are **presumed** if the actor is engaged or is an accomplice in the commission of, or an attempt to commit, or flight after committing or attempting to commit robbery, rape or deviate sexual intercourse by force or threat of force, arson, burglary, kidnapping or felonious escape."

**Key features**:

1. **Presumption, not strict liability**:
   - Felony creates **presumption** of extreme indifference
   - Presumption can be **rebutted**
   - Not automatic felony murder

2. **Limited felonies**:
   - Only inherently dangerous felonies listed
   - No minor felonies

3. **Rebuttable**:
   - Defendant can present evidence that they didn't act with extreme indifference
   - Jury instruction allowed
   - More flexible than common-law rule

4. **Still harsh**:
   - Presumption is hard to overcome
   - In practice, MPC felony murder works similarly to common law
   - But at least doctrinally recognizes mens rea element

## 8) Cold Call / Co-Counsel Script (2 minutes)

**If called on felony murder definition**:
- **Rule**: Death occurring during commission of felony = murder, even if accidental/unintentional
- **Elements**: (1) Death; (2) During felony/flight; (3) Defendant participating; (4) Causal connection
- **No mens rea**: Only need intent for underlying felony, not for killing
- **Underlying felonies**: Traditionally limited to dangerous felonies (arson, robbery, rape, burglary, kidnapping)

**If called on agency vs. proximate cause**:
- **Agency theory** (majority): Liable only if felon or accomplice does killing; not liable if victim/police/bystander kills
- **Proximate cause** (minority): Liable for any death that's foreseeable result of felony, even if third party does killing
- **Canola adopted agency theory**: Co-felon killed by victim doesn't trigger felony murder liability
- **Policy**: Agency limits overbreadath; proximate cause holds felons accountable for all risks they create

**If called on Serné**:
- **Foundational case**: Judge Stephen's instruction defines felony murder
- **"Malice aforethought"** includes intent to commit felony causing death
- **Judge's skepticism**: "Doubts whether definition is not somewhat too wide" — questions "push to steal watch" hypothetical
- **Narrowing**: Stephen says should apply only to acts "known to be dangerous to life and likely in itself to cause death"

**If called on Stamp**:
- **Strict liability**: Robber held liable for victim's fatal heart attack, even though unforeseeable
- **"Takes victim as he finds him"**: Felon responsible for victim's hidden medical conditions
- **No mens rea**: No requirement that death be foreseeable
- **Criticism**: Punishes robber for something he couldn't have known about

**If called on Canola**:
- **Facts**: Armed robbery, store owner shot co-felon (Lloredo) during exchange of gunfire
- **Holding**: Agency theory — no felony murder liability for co-felon killed by victim
- **Reasoning**: Victim killing co-felon is justifiable homicide, not "in furtherance of" felony
- **Concurrence**: Would adopt proximate cause theory for innocent victims/police, except co-felons

**If called on policy**:
- **Criticism**: No mens rea for killing; overbroad; arbitrary outcomes; racial disparity
- **Defense**: Deterrence; felons create risk; moral blameworthiness of dangerous felonies; practical enforcement
- **Real-world**: Stillman article, Adnan Khan case show harsh human impact
- **Reform**: Some states abolish (Hawaii, Kentucky), others narrow; MPC presumption approach

---

## 9) Hypo Triggers (Practice)

### Hypo 1: The Heart Attack (Stamp-style)
D commits armed robbery of convenience store. Points gun at clerk, demands money. Clerk (50, obese, history of heart problems) complies, D flees. Clerk suffers heart attack from stress, dies.

**Felony murder**: Yes — Stamp applies
**Agency theory**: Yes — D's conduct (robbery with gun) directly caused death
**No defense**: "Takes victim as he finds him"

### Hypo 2: The Police Shootout (Canola-style)
D and V commit armed robbery. Police arrive, shoot at V. V returns fire, police officer killed. D didn't shoot.

**Agency theory** (Canola): D not liable — officer killed by police, not by felon or accomplice
**Proximate cause theory** (Almeida): D liable — officer's death foreseeable result of armed robbery
**MPC**: Presumption of extreme indifference if "engaged in" robbery — likely liable

### Hypo 3: The Co-Felon Death (Canola facts)
D and V rob store. Store owner shoots back, kills V (co-felon). D didn't shoot.

**Canola**: D not liable for V's murder — agency theory; victim killed co-felon (justifiable homicide)
**Proximate cause**: D liable — V's death foreseeable result of armed robbery
**Concurrence (Sullivan)**: Would adopt proximate cause but exempt co-felons

### Hypo 4: The Bystander
D commits burglary of home. Neighbor sees suspicious activity, calls police, gives chase. D pushes neighbor to escape, neighbor falls, hits head, dies.

**Felony murder analysis**:
- Burglary is underlying felony
- Did D's push cause death? Yes
- Was push "dangerous to life"? Maybe not — depends on jurisdiction
- Serné: Judge Stephen might say no (push not inherently dangerous)
- Stamp: Court might say yes (any act during felony triggering death)

### Hypo 5: The "Shield" Scenario
D and V commit robbery. They grab bystander B, use B as human shield while escaping. Police fire at D, bullet hits B, B dies.

**Shield cases**: D liable even under agency theory
- Using victim as shield is "express malice"
- Actively placing victim in danger
- Different from typical felony murder where victim's death is collateral

---

## 10) Predictions (explicit + falsifiable)

### Likely covered in class:
- Serné's statement of felony murder doctrine + Judge Stephen's skepticism
- Stamp's strict liability application ("takes victim as he finds him")
- Canola's agency theory rejection of co-felon liability
- Agency vs. proximate cause split — majority vs. minority approaches
- Real-world impact: Stillman article, Adnan Khan case discussion

### Likely skipped:
- Detailed notes after cases (brief mention if needed)
- MPC §2.03 causation provision (mentioned in notes)

### Likely cold-call targets:
- "What is felony murder? Why does it exist?"
- "Was Stamp rightly decided? Should robber be liable for unforeseeable heart attack?"
- "Explain the difference between agency and proximate cause theories."
- "Why did Canola reverse the co-felon murder conviction?"
- "Is felony murder just? Should we abolish it?"

### Likely policy debate:
- **Abolish vs. reform**: Some states abolish felony murder entirely; should others follow?
- **Mens rea requirement**: Should felony murder require some culpability for death, not just for felony?
- **Racial justice**: Felony murder disproportionately punishes people of color — reform needed?
- **Proportionality**: Does life without parole for felony murder violate 8th Amendment when defendant didn't kill? (*Enmund v. Florida*, *Tison v. Arizona*)

### Likely exam angle / "what he wants you to learn":
- **Felony murder is deeply controversial** — not neutral doctrine, but policy choice
- **Agency vs. proximate cause** is key distinction with real consequences
- **Real-world impact** matters — Stillman/Adnan Khan show human cost of doctrine
- **Exam strategy**: Be able to argue both sides — prosecution (deterrence, culpability) and defense (no mens rea, unfairness, arbitrariness)
- **Connection to prior classes**: Mens rea (Class 3) — felony murder is exception; actus reus (Class 2) — causal requirement; Kelman time-framing — when does felony "begin" and "end"?

## 12) TA / Office Hours Questions (if any)
- For exam, should we assume agency or proximate cause theory unless told otherwise?
- How does *Enmund v. Florida* (Supreme Court case limiting death penalty for felony murder) affect the doctrine?
- Does MPC presumption actually make a difference in practice, or is it just doctrinal window dressing?
- Should felony murder apply to all underlying felonies, or only "inherently dangerous" ones?
