# Prep Packet — Class #2 — 2026-01-22 — Actus Reus

## 0) Outcome Targets (5 minutes)
- By the end of prep, I can: (1) parse MPC §2.01 word-by-word and explain what counts as a "voluntary act"; (2) distinguish the three cases (Martin, Newton, Decina) on when involuntary conduct defeats liability; (3) explain how Kelman's "time-framing" affects whether an act is voluntary; (4) state the omission liability rule from Jones; (5) answer a cold-call with clean elements + hypo application.

## 1) Assignment Snapshot
- **Syllabus extract**: `Admin/Syllabus/Assignments/2026-01-22_class02.md`
- **Reading triage** (Harcourt):
  - **MPC §§1.13(2), 1.13(9), 2.01**: Must read word-by-word (foundational)
  - **Supp. Kelman (CLS)**: Must read (interpretive flexibility = exam-relevant)
  - **Cases**: Martin, Newton, Decina (voluntary acts); Jones (omissions) — skim for hypo-able facts + holdings
  - **Note**: Omissions are a "quick note" — less emphasis, but know the rule

## 2) MPC Parsing Sheet (primary)

### MPC § 1.13(2) — Definition of "Act"
- **Provision text (verbatim)**:
  - "(2) 'act' or 'action' means a bodily movement whether voluntary or involuntary"

- **Defined terms / cross-references**:
  - "(3) 'voluntary' has the meaning specified in Section 2.01"
  - So: "act" is ANY bodily movement; "voluntary act" is defined in §2.01

- **Elements (numbered)**:
  1. Bodily movement (physical, not mere thoughts)
  2. Can be voluntary OR involuntary (but see §2.01 for criminal liability requirement)

- **Interpretive moves Harcourt might make**:
  - **Breadth**: "Act" is defined very broadly — includes involuntary movements
  - **Cross-reference**: But criminal liability requires *voluntary* act per §2.01(1)
  - **Implication**: MPC separates the definition of "act" from the requirement of voluntariness

- **Ambiguities / line-drawing**:
  - What counts as "bodily movement"? Does it include speech? Omissions? (No to omissions — §1.13(4) defines those separately)
  - Where does the "act" begin and end? (Time-framing issue — Kelman)

- **Quick hypo trigger**:
  - Sleepwalker breaks window — is that an "act"? Yes (bodily movement). Is it *voluntary*? No (§2.01(2)(b)). Criminal liability? No (§2.01(1) requires voluntary act).

---

### MPC § 1.13(9) — Definition of "Element of an Offense"
- **Provision text (verbatim)**:
  - "(9) 'element of an offense' means (i) such conduct or (ii) such attendant circumstances or (iii) such a result of conduct as
    - (a) is included in the description of the forbidden conduct in the definition of the offense; or
    - (b) establishes the required kind of culpability; or
    - (c) negatives an excuse or justification for such conduct; or
    - (d) negatives a defense under the statute of limitations; or
    - (e) establishes jurisdiction or venue"

- **Defined terms / cross-references**:
  - "conduct" = action or omission + accompanying state of mind (§1.13(5))
  - "material element" defined in §1.13(10) — subset that relates to harm/evil sought to be prevented

- **Elements (numbered)**:
  1. **Three types of elements**: (i) conduct, (ii) attendant circumstances, (iii) result
  2. **Five functions**: (a) description of forbidden conduct, (b) culpability, (c) negatives excuse/justification, (d) statute of limitations, (e) jurisdiction/venue

- **Mens rea attachment (where does it apply?)**:
  - This definition sets up what mens rea attaches TO (conduct, circumstances, results)
  - "Material elements" (§1.13(10)) are the ones that require culpability under §2.02

- **Interpretive moves Harcourt might make**:
  - **Breaking down offenses**: Every crime can be parsed into elements (conduct/circumstances/result)
  - **Mens rea matching**: Each element may have different mens rea (purpose for conduct, knowledge for circumstances, recklessness for result — must parse carefully)

- **Ambiguities / line-drawing**:
  - What's "conduct" vs. "result"? (E.g., "killing" — is that conduct or result?)
  - Which elements are "material" for mens rea purposes?

- **Quick hypo trigger**:
  - Murder statute: "Whoever purposely kills another" — parse it:
    - Conduct: killing (affirmative act)
    - Result: death of another
    - Mens rea: purposely (attaches to what? The conduct of killing? The result of death? Ambiguous — Harcourt will drill this)

---

### MPC § 2.01 — Requirement of Voluntary Act; Omission; Possession
- **Provision text (verbatim)**:
  - **(1)** "A person is not guilty of an offense unless his liability is based on conduct which includes a voluntary act or the omission to perform an act of which he is physically capable."
  - **(2)** "The following are not voluntary acts within the meaning of this Section:
    - (a) a reflex or convulsion;
    - (b) a bodily movement during unconsciousness or sleep;
    - (c) conduct during hypnosis or resulting from hypnotic suggestion;
    - (d) a bodily movement that otherwise is not a product of the effort or determination of the actor, either conscious or habitual."
  - **(3)** "Liability for the commission of an offense may not be based on an omission unaccompanied by action unless:
    - (a) the omission is expressly made sufficient by the law defining the offense; or
    - (b) a duty to perform the omitted act is otherwise imposed by law."
  - **(4)** "Possession is an act, within the meaning of this Section, if the possessor knowingly procured or received the thing possessed or was aware of his control thereof for a sufficient period to have been able to terminate his possession."

- **Defined terms / cross-references**:
  - "conduct" = §1.13(5)
  - "omission" = §1.13(4) (failure to act)
  - "voluntary" = defined negatively in §2.01(2) (what it's NOT)

- **Elements (numbered)**:
  - **§2.01(1) — Voluntary Act Requirement**:
    1. Criminal liability requires conduct
    2. Conduct must include a voluntary act OR
    3. Omission to perform an act of which physically capable
  - **§2.01(2) — NOT Voluntary Acts** (four categories):
    1. Reflex or convulsion
    2. Movement during unconsciousness or sleep
    3. Conduct during hypnosis / hypnotic suggestion
    4. Movement not product of effort or determination (conscious or habitual)
  - **§2.01(3) — Omission Liability** (two requirements):
    1. Omission expressly made sufficient by statute defining offense; OR
    2. Legal duty to perform omitted act
  - **§2.01(4) — Possession as Act** (two ways):
    1. Knowingly procured or received; OR
    2. Aware of control for sufficient period to terminate

- **Mens rea attachment (where does it apply?)**:
  - Voluntariness is NOT mens rea — it's part of actus reus
  - But note: §2.01(4) possession requires "knowingly" — this IS mens rea
  - Contrast: §2.01(2) involuntariness can be unconscious (no mental state at all)

- **Interpretive moves Harcourt might make**:
  - **"Includes" in §2.01(1)**: Conduct must *include* a voluntary act — doesn't have to be ONLY voluntary acts. If course of conduct has ONE voluntary act, that may suffice (see Decina).
  - **Negative definition in §2.01(2)**: MPC defines voluntary acts by exclusion — anything NOT on this list is presumptively voluntary. Very broad.
  - **§2.01(2)(d) — "conscious or habitual"**: This is KEY. Even habitual (non-conscious) acts can be voluntary. Voluntariness ≠ conscious choice in the moment.
  - **Time-framing (Kelman)**: Where you draw the line of "the act" determines voluntariness. Decina: if "the act" = driving while epileptic (voluntary decision), liable. If "the act" = having seizure while driving (involuntary), not liable.

- **Ambiguities / line-drawing (best arguments both ways)**:
  - **When is conduct "habitual" enough to be voluntary?** (e.g., trained reflex vs. true reflex)
  - **How far back can you go to find a voluntary act?** (Decina: driving with knowledge of epilepsy is voluntary act, even though seizure isn't)
  - **Omission duty (§2.01(3)(b))**: What counts as "duty otherwise imposed by law"? Statute? Common law? Contract? Relationship? (Jones explores this)
  - **Possession (§2.01(4))**: How long is "sufficient period"? Seconds? Minutes?

- **Quick hypo triggers**:
  1. **Martin (reflex/involuntary)**: Police drag drunk man onto highway; he's convicted of "being drunk on highway." Voluntary act? No — he didn't voluntarily go to highway. [§2.01(2)(d) — not product of his effort/determination]
  2. **Newton (unconsciousness)**: Huey Newton shot in stomach, claims unconscious when he killed cop. Voluntary act? Maybe not if truly unconscious [§2.01(2)(b)]. But jury question: was he really unconscious?
  3. **Decina (prior voluntary act)**: Epileptic drives knowing he might have seizure; has seizure, kills 4 people. Voluntary act? Yes — the voluntary act was driving with knowledge of condition [§2.01(1) — conduct *includes* a voluntary act; time-framing]
  4. **Jones (omission)**: Woman takes in friend's baby, baby dies of malnutrition. Omission liability? Only if legal duty [§2.01(3)(b)]. What creates duty? Statute? Contract? Voluntary assumption of care? Relationship?

## 3) Policy / Theory Brief (co-primary)

### Mark Kelman: "Interpretive Construction in the Substantive Criminal Law"

- **Central thesis (1 sentence)**:
  - Criminal law doctrine is radically indeterminate because legal outcomes depend on interpretive choices (e.g., broad vs. narrow time-framing, subjective vs. objective standards) that are presented as technical but are actually political/normative.

- **3 supporting claims (bullets)**:
  - **Time-framing**: Courts can characterize conduct broadly (long time frame) or narrowly (snapshot), which determines voluntariness, mens rea, and causation. This choice is manipulable and outcome-determinative.
  - **Broad vs. narrow views of act**: In voluntary act cases, courts oscillate between narrow framing (the involuntary seizure) and broad framing (the choice to drive knowing of seizures), often without acknowledgment.
  - **Legitimacy**: By presenting these choices as neutral legal reasoning rather than policy choices, courts disguise the malleability of criminal law and avoid accountability for normative judgments.

- **2 key quotes** (paraphrase if exact text unavailable):
  - [Need to read Kelman supplement for exact quotes — placeholder:]
  - "The legal system's demand for a single, determinate account of conduct is fundamentally at odds with the multiple ways any conduct can be described."
  - "Time-framing choices in criminal law are political choices masquerading as logical deductions."

- **How this policy frame changes doctrine/application (2-4 bullets)**:
  - **Actus reus (voluntary act)**: Decina can be decided either way depending on time frame. Narrow: involuntary seizure (acquit). Broad: voluntary choice to drive (convict). Both are "correct" as doctrinal matter.
  - **Mens rea (coming classes)**: Same manipulability — broad time frame can find purpose where narrow finds only recklessness.
  - **Exam strategy**: Harcourt wants you to see BOTH framings, argue both sides, show ambiguity. Don't just pick one.
  - **Connects to Class 1 (CLS)**: This is the "lawyers ply the law" theme — good lawyers can frame facts/doctrine to client's advantage. Law is not neutral.

- **Likely Harcourt questions (Socratic prompts)**:
  - "Is Decina rightly decided? What if we frame the act differently?"
  - "Was Martin's conduct voluntary or involuntary? Depends on what we call 'the act,' right?"
  - "Can you defend both outcomes in Newton using different time frames?"
  - "What normative values drive the choice of time frame? Deterrence? Culpability? Administrative ease?"

## 4) Minimal Case Cards (tertiary)

### Case: Martin v. State (Ala. Ct. App., 1944)
- **Facts (30 seconds)**:
  - Martin arrested at home for drunkenness; police took him onto public highway; convicted under statute making it crime to be drunk "on public highway"

- **Holding / rule nugget (1-2 sentences)**:
  - Conviction reversed. Voluntary act requirement: accused must have voluntarily appeared in public while drunk. Being involuntarily placed there by police defeats actus reus.

- **MPC hook (what language does this implicate?)**:
  - §2.01(2)(d) — bodily movement not a product of effort or determination of actor
  - §2.01(1) — no liability unless conduct includes voluntary act

- **Policy hook (what value conflict does this raise?)**:
  - **Deterrence**: Can't deter involuntary conduct — pointless to punish
  - **Culpability**: No moral blame if police forced him onto highway
  - **But**: He DID get drunk voluntarily (Kelman: broader time frame could sustain conviction if "the act" = getting drunk, not being on highway)

- **One exam-style hypo (1-2 sentences)**:
  - D, intoxicated in his home, is carried by friends to a public park as a prank. Charged with public intoxication. Voluntary act? No (Martin). But what if D asked friends to take him outside? Then yes (voluntary request, even if friends carried him).

---

### Case: People v. Newton (Cal. Ct. App., 1970)
- **Facts (30 seconds)**:
  - Huey Newton (Black Panther) shot in stomach during confrontation with police; cop killed; Newton claims he was unconscious due to shock/pain and doesn't remember shooting

- **Holding / rule nugget (1-2 sentences)**:
  - Trial court should have given unconsciousness instruction. If jury believes Newton was unconscious when he shot, no voluntary act, no liability. Unconsciousness is complete defense (if not self-induced).

- **MPC hook (what language does this implicate?)**:
  - §2.01(2)(b) — bodily movement during unconsciousness or sleep is not voluntary
  - But: if unconsciousness is self-induced (e.g., voluntary intoxication), different rule may apply

- **Policy hook (what value conflict does this raise?)**:
  - **Subjectivity**: How do we know if someone was really unconscious? Battle of experts? Defendant's self-serving testimony?
  - **Deterrence**: If we excuse unconscious conduct, does that create incentive to fake it?
  - **Culpability**: If truly unconscious, no awareness, no capacity to control — seems unjust to punish

- **One exam-style hypo (1-2 sentences)**:
  - D suffers severe allergic reaction, goes into anaphylactic shock, flails and strikes V in face causing injury. Battery? No voluntary act if truly unconscious (Newton). But what if D knew of allergy and didn't carry EpiPen? (Decina-style argument: prior voluntary act of negligence)

---

### Case: People v. Decina (N.Y., 1956)
- **Facts (30 seconds)**:
  - Decina, known epileptic, drove car knowing he was subject to seizures; had seizure while driving, lost control, killed 4 schoolgirls; convicted of negligent homicide

- **Holding / rule nugget (1-2 sentences)**:
  - Conviction upheld. Voluntary act requirement met: Decina's voluntary act was driving with knowledge of his epileptic condition. The subsequent seizure doesn't negate liability if the initial conduct (driving) was voluntary and culpable.

- **MPC hook (what language does this implicate?)**:
  - §2.01(1) — conduct must "include" a voluntary act (not be entirely voluntary)
  - **Key word**: "includes" — if course of conduct has ONE voluntary act, that's enough
  - Voluntary act: decision to drive with knowledge of epilepsy

- **Policy hook (what value conflict does this raise?)**:
  - **Deterrence**: Can deter epileptics from driving (or at least driving without precautions)
  - **Culpability**: Decina chose to create risk; morally blameworthy for that choice
  - **Disability**: Should epileptics be criminalized for driving? Limits autonomy/mobility
  - **Time-framing (Kelman)**: Broad frame (voluntary choice to drive) vs. narrow frame (involuntary seizure) — court picks broad, but could go either way

- **One exam-style hypo (1-2 sentences)**:
  - D, diabetic, forgets to take insulin, goes into hypoglycemic state while driving, crashes and kills V. Voluntary act? Yes (Decina): voluntary act = driving while knowing of diabetic condition and having skipped insulin. But counterargument: if D genuinely forgot (not reckless), less culpable.

---

### Case: Jones v. U.S. (D.C. Cir., 1962)
- **Facts (30 seconds)**:
  - Jones took in friend's baby, baby died of malnutrition in her care; Jones convicted of involuntary manslaughter based on failure to feed (omission)

- **Holding / rule nugget (1-2 sentences)**:
  - Conviction reversed, remanded for proper jury instruction. Omission liability requires legal duty. Jury must find: (1) legal duty to act, (2) knowledge of facts giving rise to duty, (3) physical ability to act.

- **MPC hook (what language does this implicate?)**:
  - §2.01(3) — omission liability only if: (a) statute expressly makes omission sufficient, OR (b) legal duty imposed by law
  - Question: What creates "legal duty"? Statute, common law (parent-child), contract, voluntary assumption of care, creation of peril?

- **Policy hook (what value conflict does this raise?)**:
  - **Good Samaritan problem**: Generally no duty to rescue strangers (American rule). Why?
  - **Special relationships**: Parents/children, spouses, employers/employees may create duties
  - **Voluntary assumption**: If you start helping, do you create duty? (Encourages or discourages help?)
  - **Foreseeability**: Baby's mother left it with Jones — does that create duty? Contract? Reliance?

- **One exam-style hypo (1-2 sentences)**:
  - D sees child drowning in pool, walks by without helping, child dies. Omission liability? Generally no (no legal duty to rescue stranger). BUT: if D is lifeguard on duty, or parent, or created the peril (e.g., D pushed child), then duty exists (§2.01(3)(b)).

## 5) Cold Call / Co-Counsel Script (2 minutes)

**If called on MPC §2.01:**
- **Definition**: §2.01(1) — no criminal liability unless conduct includes a voluntary act or omission where duty exists.
- **Voluntary act defined negatively**: §2.01(2) lists what's NOT voluntary — reflex, unconsciousness, hypnosis, or movement not product of effort/determination.
- **Key word "includes"**: Conduct must *include* voluntary act, not be entirely voluntary. One voluntary act in a chain of events can suffice (Decina).
- **Application**: [Pick fact from Martin/Newton/Decina depending on question]

**If called on Martin/Newton/Decina distinction:**
- **Martin**: Involuntary throughout — police forced him onto highway. No voluntary act at all. Acquit.
- **Newton**: Arguably involuntary at moment of shooting (unconscious). But jury question — was he really unconscious? If yes, acquit.
- **Decina**: Voluntary act present (chose to drive knowing of epilepsy), even though seizure itself involuntary. Convict. Court uses broad time frame.
- **Kelman insight**: All three can be reframed. Martin: voluntary drunkenness (broad). Newton: voluntary confrontation with police (broad). Decina: involuntary seizure (narrow). Time-framing is manipulable.

**If called on omissions (Jones):**
- **General rule**: No liability for omission unless legal duty.
- **Duty sources**: Statute, special relationship (parent/child), contract, voluntary assumption of care, creation of peril.
- **Jones**: Unclear if she had duty — jury should decide. Did voluntary assumption of care create duty?
- **MPC**: §2.01(3) — omission alone not enough; need duty imposed by law.

**If called on Kelman:**
- **Time-framing**: Courts choose broad vs. narrow time frames to describe "the act," which determines voluntariness (and later, mens rea, causation).
- **Example**: Decina — narrow frame (seizure) = involuntary, acquit. Broad frame (driving with knowledge) = voluntary, convict. Court picked broad, but choice is political, not logical.
- **Implication for us**: On exam, argue BOTH frames. Show Harcourt you see the malleability. This is CLS in action.

## 6) Predictions (explicit + falsifiable)

### Likely covered in class:
- Deep dive on Decina — "includes" in §2.01(1), time-framing, where to draw the line
- Hypotheticals testing voluntariness: sleepwalking, seizures, intoxication, trained reflexes
- Kelman time-framing applied to all three cases (can you flip the outcomes?)
- Omissions briefly — Jones rule, what creates duty

### Likely skipped:
- Deep omission doctrine (that's a quick note, not main focus)
- Possession (§2.01(4)) — mentioned but probably not deeply discussed

### Likely cold-call targets:
- "What's the voluntary act requirement? Why do we have it?"
- "Was Decina rightly decided? What if we describe the act as the seizure, not the driving?"
- "Can you defend the Martin outcome? The opposite outcome?"
- "How does Kelman explain why these cases come out the way they do?"

### Likely policy debate:
- Should we require voluntary acts? (Deterrence argument: can't deter involuntary conduct. Culpability: no blame without choice.)
- Decina: Should epileptics be allowed to drive? Disability rights vs. public safety.
- Omissions: Should we have Good Samaritan laws (duty to rescue)? Why does U.S. generally reject them?

### Likely exam angle / "what he wants you to learn":
- **Actus reus is the foundation** — can't have crime without it (pairs with mens rea next class)
- **Voluntary act requirement is manipulable** — Kelman shows this. Harcourt wants you to see both sides, argue ambiguity.
- **MPC close reading is essential** — "includes" in §2.01(1) is doing heavy lifting
- **Time-framing will come up again** — mens rea, causation, defenses. This is a course-long theme.
- **Elements analysis**: Start breaking down offenses into conduct/circumstances/results (§1.13(9)) — this is the foundation for mens rea matching (next class: §2.02)

## 7) TA / Office Hours Questions (if any)
- How much Kelman detail for exam? (Full article analysis or just time-framing concept?)
- Will Harcourt provide modified MPC statutes or use the actual MPC text?
- For omissions (Jones), how deeply do we need to know common law duty categories?
- Should we memorize MPC section numbers or just concepts?
