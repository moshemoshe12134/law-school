# Prep Packet — Class #7 — 2026-02-03 — Unintended Killings

## 0) Outcome Targets (5 minutes)

By the end of prep, I can:
1. Distinguish extreme recklessness (murder) from recklessness (manslaughter) from negligence (negligent homicide) along the three dimensions Harcourt identifies: awareness, risk level, care
2. Apply the line-drawing from *Malone*, *Welansky*, *Hall*, and *Williams* to new hypos
3. Articulate the policy rationale for each gradation (why these distinctions exist)
4. Explain what "conscious disregard for human life" means and how it differs from simple negligence
5. Identify the key exam traps: confusing recklessness with intent, misapplying the "substantial risk" standard, treating negligence as criminal too easily

## 1) Assignment Snapshot

**Syllabus extract:** `Admin/Syllabus/Assignments/2026-02-03_class07.md`

**Reading triage (MUST READ):**
- **Malone** (KSSB10 509-513): Foundational case defining extreme recklessness via Russian roulette hypo
- **Welansky** (KSSB10 490-503): Reckless manslaughter via omission (nightclub fire)
- **Hall** (KSSB10 490-503): High probability of death (>50%) = extreme recklessness murder
- **Williams** (KSSB10 490-503): Negligence standard (doctor's duty; later overruled)

**Reading triage (IMPORTANT CONTEXT):**
- Past outline: Harcourt_Condesned Crim Outline.docx.md lines 177, 186, 318-325, 343-347 (recklessness vs. negligence tables and hypos)
- Crim_Harcourt_Spring2021.docx.md (full outline section on unintended killings)

**Focus questions (from syllabus):**
1. What are the dimensions of gradation? (awareness, risk level, care)
2. Do these dimensions make sense? Would you propose a different system?
3. What purpose do these gradations serve for society?

## 2) The Three Gradations — Black Letter Rules (CRITICAL)

### A) Extreme Recklessness → MURDER

**Rule Statement:**
A person commits murder when death results from conduct involving a **substantial and unjustifiable risk** of death, where the defendant **consciously disregards** that risk **under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life**.

**Elements (per common law and MPC § 2.02(c) recklessness threshold):**
1. Defendant engaged in conduct creating a **substantial** risk of death
2. Defendant was **aware** of the risk (conscious disregard)
3. Disregard for risk was **gross** (extreme, not just careless)
4. Shows **extreme indifference to human life** (not mere recklessness, but manifested extreme indifference)

**Mens rea:** 
- Subjective: Must knowingly disregard a substantial risk
- The "extreme indifference" is measured objectively (would a reasonable person see this as showing extreme disregard?)

**Burdens:**
- Prosecution must prove extreme recklessness **beyond a reasonable doubt**
- Burden of production on defendant to introduce evidence of lack of awareness (if relying on that)

**Key distinction from Recklessness (below):**
- **Extreme recklessness** = shows extreme indifference to life (quasi-intentional, almost murder-like)
- **Ordinary recklessness** = conscious disregard, but not manifesting extreme indifference

---

### B) Recklessness → MANSLAUGHTER

**Rule Statement:**
A person commits manslaughter (involuntary manslaughter) when death results from conduct where the defendant **consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk** of death, but does **not** manifest **extreme indifference to human life**.

**Elements (per MPC § 2.02(c) and common law):**
1. Defendant engaged in conduct creating a **substantial** risk of death
2. Defendant was **aware** of the risk (conscious disregard)
3. Disregard was gross deviation from standard of conduct (not just negligent)
4. **Does NOT manifest extreme indifference** (otherwise would be murder)

**Mens rea:**
- Must be **subjective** (defendant knew or consciously disregarded the risk)
- The "gross deviation" standard is objective (would reasonable person see this as gross deviation?)

**Burdens:**
- Prosecution must prove recklessness **beyond a reasonable doubt**

**Key cases:**
- **Welansky**: Operating nightclub with blocked exits, inadequate exits, under-inspected → reckless manslaughter (defendant didn't have conscious intent to kill, but disregarded obvious fire risk)

---

### C) Negligence → NEGLIGENT HOMICIDE (or sometimes: NO LIABILITY)

**Rule Statement:**
A person commits negligent homicide when death results from the defendant's failure to **perceive a substantial and unjustifiable risk** of death that a **reasonable person would have perceived**.

**Elements:**
1. Defendant engaged in conduct creating a **substantial** risk of death
2. Defendant was **NOT aware** of the risk (but should have been)
3. Failure to perceive involves **gross deviation** from standard of care of a reasonable person
4. Risk was **substantial** (not trivial)

**Mens rea:**
- **Purely objective** (no requirement of awareness)
- Measured against a "reasonable person" standard
- Even if defendant didn't know/wasn't thinking about the risk, they're liable if they should have known

**Burdens:**
- Prosecution must prove negligence **beyond a reasonable doubt**
- Note: Many jurisdictions limit negligent homicide charges (lesser offense than manslaughter)

**Key case:**
- **Williams** (caveat: later overruled by statute): Doctor failed to provide due care to patient → negligence (note: this case is important for showing the negligence standard, but know it was rejected by statute)

---

## 3) The Three Dimensions of Gradation (Harcourt's Framework)

Harcourt asks: "What are the dimensions along which cases always seem to resolve?"

**Dimension 1: AWARENESS (Subjective vs. Objective)**
- Did defendant **know** about the risk? (Subjective → Recklessness/Extreme Recklessness)
- Should defendant have **known** about the risk? (Objective → Negligence)
- The shift from recklessness to negligence is about moving from "conscious disregard" to "failure to perceive"

**Dimension 2: RISK MAGNITUDE (How substantial?)**
- Extreme recklessness: Very high risk (Russian roulette, >50% chance of death per *Hall*)
- Recklessness: Substantial but not extreme (blocked nightclub exits, >modest risk)
- Negligence: Substantial risk, but defendant missed it (doctor failed to check vital signs)
- **No liability**: Risk is minimal or trivial (ordinary driving, activities with accepted risks)

**Dimension 3: CARE DEMONSTRATED (Gross deviation from standard)**
- Extreme recklessness: Grossly indifferent to human life (weaponized disregard)
- Recklessness: Gross deviation from standard conduct (careless, reckless, but not hostile to life)
- Negligence: Gross deviation from standard of care (should have done better)
- **No liability**: Reasonable care, or accepted risk level (ordinary caution)

## 4) Case Briefs — "Walk-In Ready"

### Commonwealth v. Malone ([Year], Pennsylvania)

**Facts (1-2 sentences):**
Malone and another man were playing Russian roulette (gun with one bullet, six chambers, spinning cylinder, pointing at head). One shot the gun, the bullet was loaded, and a third man died. Malone was a bystander who participated by agreeing to play, egging the shooter on, and not stopping him.

**Issue:**
Does playing Russian roulette with a gun constitute extreme recklessness manifesting extreme indifference to human life (i.e., murder)?

**Holding:**
**YES.** Playing Russian roulette with a loaded gun, knowing there is a 1-in-6 chance of death, constitutes extreme recklessness manifesting extreme indifference to human life. Therefore, Malone is guilty of murder (or at least accomplice to murder).

**Rule/Standard:**
- Extreme recklessness = conscious disregard of a substantial risk of death **under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life**
- The key is not intent to kill, but **extreme indifference** shown by the conduct itself
- Russian roulette is the paradigm case of extreme indifference (no purpose other than playing a deadly game)

**Reasoning (bullets):**
- Russian roulette is not just a risky activity; it's a game where death is the point
- 1-in-6 chance of death is not "substantial risk"—it's near-certain eventual death
- The conduct itself (playing for fun) shows no regard for human life
- This is not like driving recklessly or operating a business negligently; it's intentional risk-taking with lethal weapons
- Extreme indifference can be inferred from the nature of the conduct

**Policy / Values:**
- Retribution: These people deserve serious punishment; they've shown they don't value human life
- Deterrence: If you play Russian roulette, you will be punished as a murderer
- Incapacitation: Removing people who treat death as a game
- Fairness: Between the victim (dead through no fault of their own) and the defendant (who created unjustified lethal risk), the defendant should bear the cost

**Cold-call ready takeaway (1 sentence):**
"Extreme recklessness—conscious disregard of a substantial risk under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to human life—can constitute murder even without intent to kill, as shown by Russian roulette cases like Malone."

**How it will be tested (exam angle):**
- Hypos involving games, stunts, or activities with obvious lethal risk (similar to Russian roulette)
- You must distinguish between "very reckless" (manslaughter) and "showing extreme indifference" (murder)
- Watch for facts suggesting the defendant was playing a dangerous game for fun (extreme indifference) vs. just being careless/reckless

**Outline reference:**
See Harcourt_Condesned Crim Outline.docx.md line 318-320: "Extreme recklessness can lead to a murder charge (ex. playing RUS roulette with friend, [Malone])" — confirms this is exam-tested

---

### Welansky (Massachusetts) — Reckless Manslaughter via Omission

**Facts (2-3 sentences):**
Welansky owned a nightclub (the Coconut Grove). The club was dangerously crowded, exits were blocked or inadequate, and there was a fire. Over 450 people died. Welansky had failed to maintain adequate fire exits, failed to remove obstructions, and failed to ensure proper egress planning. He was not directly involved in the fire, and may not have even known it was burning until too late.

**Issue:**
Can failure to maintain adequate safety precautions in a building (knowing the risks but failing to address them) constitute reckless manslaughter?

**Holding:**
**YES.** Welansky's failure to maintain proper fire exits and crowd control, knowing the risks but disregarding them, constitutes recklessness. The gross deviation from the standard of care, combined with conscious disregard of the risk, makes him liable for manslaughter.

**Rule/Standard:**
- Recklessness includes both **commission** (actively doing something risky) and **omission** (failing to do something when you have a duty to act)
- If you own/operate a place of public gathering, you have a duty to maintain reasonable safety precautions
- Conscious disregard of an obvious risk of death = reckless manslaughter (even if you don't intend to kill)
- Does NOT rise to extreme recklessness/murder because owner wasn't playing a game; just negligent/reckless operation of business

**Reasoning (bullets):**
- Welansky knew the nightclub was crowded and had inadequate exits (conscious awareness of risk)
- He took no steps to remedy it (conscious disregard of risk)
- A reasonable owner would have either limited crowds, added exits, or ensured safe egress
- His conduct represents gross deviation from standard of business operation
- Over 450 deaths shows the risk was substantial, not trivial
- This is manslaughter, not murder, because there's no extreme indifference like in Malone (he wasn't playing a deadly game; he was just running a negligent business)

**Policy / Values:**
- Retribution: Business owners should be held responsible for deaths caused by their negligent operations
- Deterrence: If you operate a public building, you must maintain safety; reckless owners will be prosecuted
- Incapacitation: Remove people from positions of trust if they show disregard for public safety
- Admin feasibility: Makes business owners think carefully about crowd control and fire safety
- Fairness: Between victims who trusted a public place was safe and owner who profited from the business, owner should bear cost of deaths caused by negligence

**Cold-call ready takeaway (1 sentence):**
"Recklessness (and thus manslaughter) can arise from omission—failing to maintain adequate safety when you have a duty and know the risks—as in the Welansky nightclub fire case."

**How it will be tested (exam angle):**
- Hypos with business owners, landlords, or people with duties to others
- Watch for facts involving failure to act (omission) rather than active dangerous conduct
- You must show: (1) duty to act, (2) knowledge of risk, (3) conscious disregard, (4) gross deviation from standard
- Common exam: "Landlord knows building has defective wiring; doesn't fix it; tenant dies in fire. Reckless manslaughter?"

**Outline reference:**
See Harcourt_Condesned Crim Outline.docx.md line 331-335: "Recklessness, even though omissions can lead to a manslaughter [Welansky]" — confirms omission liability is tested

---

### Hall (California) — "Probability of Death" Test for Extreme Recklessness

**Facts (1-2 sentences):**
Hall fired a revolver into a crowd of people. By statistics/common sense, if you shoot into a dense group, you have a high probability of hitting someone and causing death. Hall was charged with murder based on extreme recklessness.

**Issue:**
Can shooting into a crowd, knowing there's a high probability of death (similar to Russian roulette odds), constitute extreme recklessness/murder?

**Holding:**
**YES.** Shooting into a crowd where there is a probability of death exceeding 50% (or thereabouts) constitutes extreme recklessness manifesting extreme indifference to human life, and thus murder.

**Rule/Standard:**
- The probability of death is a key metric for determining extreme recklessness
- If the probability is very high (>50%, or even lower in some analyses), the defendant shows extreme indifference
- This is similar to Malone's Russian roulette logic (1-in-6 = ~17% chance, treated as extreme recklessness; shooting into crowd may have higher probability)

**Reasoning (bullets):**
- Shooting a gun into a crowd is inherently dangerous and likely to kill
- The defendant knew this when pulling the trigger
- Consciously disregarding a very high risk of death = extreme indifference
- The "probability" analysis is a helpful metric for juries to measure the risk
- No legitimate purpose for firing into a crowd (unlike some reckless activities that have some social value)

**Policy / Values:**
- Deterrence: Don't shoot into crowds; you will be charged with murder
- Retribution: Taking actions that are nearly certain to kill someone (probabilistically) deserves murder-level punishment
- Incapacitation: These are dangerous people
- Fairness: Victims had no chance; defendant created unjustifiable lethal risk

**Cold-call ready takeaway (1 sentence):**
"Shooting into a crowd, where death is highly probable, constitutes extreme recklessness manifesting extreme indifference to life—similar to Russian roulette—and is thus murder-level liability."

**How it will be tested (exam angle):**
- Hypos involving weapons, high-probability-of-death scenarios, or reckless endangerment
- Use the probability lens: "What's the chance this conduct causes death? If >50% or very high, likely extreme recklessness"
- Watch for exam hypos: "D threw dynamite into a warehouse. What charge?" (Probability analysis)

**Outline reference:**
See Harcourt_Condesned Crim Outline.docx.md line 329: "Manslaughter for death caused by reckless action, an action [...] >50%, [Hall]" — confirms this probability threshold is tested

---

### Williams (England) — Negligence Standard (CAVEAT: Later Overruled)

**Facts (1-2 sentences):**
Williams was a doctor. His patient died because Williams failed to provide adequate medical care/diagnosis. Williams argued he didn't intend to harm the patient and may not have even known about the negligence.

**Issue:**
Can a doctor be liable for negligent homicide if the death results from failure to provide reasonable care, even if the doctor was not aware of the risk?

**Holding:**
**QUESTIONABLE.** The case suggests negligent homicide liability is possible based on an objective standard of reasonable care (even without awareness of risk). **NOTE: This holding was later overruled/limited by statute in many jurisdictions.**

**Rule/Standard (from Williams, but note caveat):**
- Negligent homicide can arise from failure to perceive a substantial risk that a reasonable person would have perceived
- The standard is purely objective (would a reasonable doctor have provided this care?)
- Defendant need not be aware of the risk

**Caveat:**
- Many jurisdictions have **statutorily limited negligent homicide** or created "gross negligence" standards to avoid over-criminalization of professional mistakes
- Harcourt's syllabus says Harcourt may discuss this caveat
- **Key takeaway for exam:** Know the Williams standard, but note that modern practice often limits criminal liability for negligence to "gross negligence," not ordinary negligence

**Reasoning (bullets):**
- Doctors have a duty to provide reasonable care to patients
- This duty includes diagnosing conditions accurately
- If a reasonable doctor would have diagnosed/treated the condition, but this doctor didn't, the doctor has breached the standard
- Breach + death = negligent homicide (under this view)

**Policy / Values:**
- Deterrence: Doctors should provide reasonable care
- BUT also: Concerns about over-criminalization of professional judgment calls
- Fairness: Patients should expect minimum standard of care; failure to meet it can kill

**Cold-call ready takeaway (1 sentence):**
"Williams represents the objective negligence standard (failure to perceive a risk a reasonable person would perceive = negligent homicide), but this holding is now limited in many jurisdictions by gross negligence or statutory carve-outs."

**How it will be tested (exam angle):**
- Hypos involving professional duty (doctors, lawyers, engineers)
- You must note the caveat: "Under Williams, this might be negligent homicide, but modern law requires 'gross negligence,' not mere negligence"
- Watch for Harcourt's position on whether professional negligence should be criminalized

**Outline reference:**
See Harcourt_Condesned Crim Outline.docx.md line 339: "(ii) to doctor, [Williams], overruled by statute)" — confirms this case is tested but note the caveat

## 5) Summary Table: The Three Gradations

| **Gradation** | **Awareness** | **Risk Level** | **Care Deviation** | **Charges** | **Key Case** | **Cold Call Answer** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Extreme Recklessness** | Conscious disregard + extreme indifference | Very high (>50% or quasi-certain death) | Gross deviation showing extreme indifference | Murder | Malone, Hall | "Extreme recklessness—conscious disregard of substantial risk under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to life—is murder" |
| **Recklessness** | Conscious disregard (aware of risk) | Substantial (significant risk, but not extreme) | Gross deviation from standard conduct | Involuntary Manslaughter | Welansky | "Recklessness—conscious disregard of substantial risk—is manslaughter, even via omission" |
| **Negligence** | NO awareness (but should have been) | Substantial (risk exists, defendant missed it) | Gross deviation from standard of care | Negligent Homicide (limited) | Williams | "Negligence is objective failure to perceive risk; liability is limited (gross negligence standard in many jurisdictions)" |
| **No Liability** | No risk or accepted risk | Trivial or socially accepted | Reasonable care taken or risk accepted (driving, sports) | None | — | "Ordinary caution, accepted risks, or reasonable activities = no homicide liability" |

## 6) Common Exam Traps — How to Avoid Them

**Trap 1: Confusing "Recklessness" with "Intent to Kill"**
- **The trap**: Students think "reckless murder" requires intent to kill (like intentional murder)
- **The reality**: Extreme recklessness is enough; no intent to kill required
- **How to avoid**: Memorize Malone: Russian roulette players didn't intend to kill anyone, but were guilty of murder
- **Exam technique**: If facts show extreme recklessness without intent, say "This is reckless murder under Malone, not requiring intent"

**Trap 2: Missing the "Extreme Indifference" Element**
- **The trap**: You charge extreme recklessness/murder for any reckless conduct
- **The reality**: Must show EXTREME indifference (not just ordinary recklessness)
- **How to avoid**: Ask "Does this show extreme indifference to human life, or just ordinary recklessness?" (Welansky = ordinary recklessness/manslaughter; Malone = extreme/murder)
- **Exam technique**: State both charges and explain why one is more appropriate

**Trap 3: Forgetting the Objective "Gross Deviation" Component**
- **The trap**: You rely only on what the defendant knew (subjective)
- **The reality**: Even recklessness requires objective "gross deviation" from standard conduct
- **How to avoid**: After asking "Did defendant know the risk?", ask "Would a reasonable person see this as gross deviation from normal conduct?"
- **Exam technique**: Include both the subjective (aware? disregarding?) and objective (gross deviation?) prongs

**Trap 4: Confusing Negligence with Recklessness**
- **The trap**: You can't distinguish when defendant was unaware vs. aware of risk
- **The reality**: Unaware = negligence (objective standard); Aware + disregarding = recklessness (subjective)
- **How to avoid**: Circle back to the facts: "Did the defendant know about the risk?" If yes → recklessness; if no → negligence
- **Exam technique**: State both charges, then explain which fits based on defendant's awareness

**Trap 5: Over-Charging Negligence**
- **The trap**: You charge negligent homicide for ordinary negligence
- **The reality**: Negligent homicide requires GROSS negligence (big deviation); many jurisdictions limit it further
- **How to avoid**: Know that Williams is old and limited; ask "Is this gross negligence, or just ordinary mistake?"
- **Exam technique**: Caveat with "Note: Many jurisdictions require gross negligence for criminal negligent homicide, not ordinary negligence"

**Trap 6: Missing Omission Liability**
- **The trap**: You only look for active dangerous conduct (commission)
- **The reality**: Recklessness/extreme recklessness can arise from failure to act (omission) if you have a duty
- **How to avoid**: Ask "Did defendant have a duty? Did they know about the risk? Did they consciously disregard it by failing to act?"
- **Exam technique**: Explicitly state "Omission liability applies here because: [duty + knowledge + disregard]"

**Trap 7: Not Using the "Probability of Death" Analysis**
- **The trap**: You can't quantify the risk level
- **The reality**: Hall suggests using probability/odds to measure whether risk is "substantial" and whether disregard is "extreme"
- **How to avoid**: In your hypos, estimate the probability of death
- **Exam technique**: "If probability of death is >X%, this suggests extreme recklessness/murder; if <Y%, this suggests ordinary recklessness/manslaughter"

---

## 7) Key Takeaways — Memorable Phrases

- **Extreme recklessness = quasi-intentional murder** (conscious disregard under extreme indifference)
- **Recklessness = aware + disregarding + gross deviation** (manslaughter)
- **Negligence = unaware + should have been aware** (negligent homicide, limited)
- **Russian roulette = the paradigm case of extreme recklessness**
- **Nightclub fire = the paradigm case of reckless manslaughter via omission**
- **Probability of death > ~50% = likely extreme recklessness**
- **Omissions count if you have a duty + know the risk**
- **"Extreme indifference" is the key separator between extreme recklessness and ordinary recklessness**

---

## 8) Notes for Class Discussion — Cold Call Prep

### If Asked "Why These Gradations?" (Policy Menu)

**Retribution:**
- Extreme recklessness shows moral culpability nearly equal to intent to kill (deserves murder punishment)
- Recklessness shows moral culpability (deserves manslaughter punishment)
- Negligence shows less moral culpability (deserves lighter punishment or no criminal liability)

**Deterrence:**
- Make extreme recklessness murder-level to deter deadly games, stunts, and reckless endangerment
- Make recklessness manslaughter-level to deter business negligence, careless conduct
- Limit negligence prosecution to avoid chilling ordinary professional judgment

**Incapacitation:**
- Remove people from society who show extreme indifference to human life
- Remove people who are dangerously reckless
- Don't over-incapacitate for ordinary negligence (professional mistakes)

**Fairness / Notice:**
- Defendants should know that extreme risk-taking with lethal consequences = serious punishment
- Businesses should know that reckless operation = criminal liability
- Professionals need to know the line between negligence (civil liability) and gross negligence (criminal)

**Administrative Feasibility:**
- Courts can't try every negligent death (overload)
- Need to limit to "gross negligence" to preserve resources
- Juries can understand probability/risk analysis (Malone, Hall)

### 30-Second Doctrine Summary (Memorize This)

> "Class 7 is about homicide without intent to kill. We grade deaths based on three things: Was the defendant aware of the risk? (awareness). How big was the risk? (magnitude). How much did they deviate from normal conduct? (care). If extremely aware and extremely indifferent, it's murder (Malone, Hall). If conscious disregard but not extreme, it's manslaughter (Welansky). If unaware but should have been, it's negligent homicide, though many states limit this (Williams). The key separator is 'extreme indifference'—the line between reckless murder and reckless manslaughter."

## 9) Outline Integration & Comparative Analysis

### Cross-References to Past Outlines

**Harcourt_Condesned Crim Outline.docx.md** (Most Relevant):
- Lines 177, 186: Table showing "Extreme recklessness → U [Murder]" and "Recklessness → A [Manslaughter]"
- Lines 318-320: "Extreme recklessness can lead to a murder charge (ex. playing RUS roulette with friend, [Malone])"
- Lines 325-335: "Manslaughter for death caused by reckless action" and Welansky example
- Lines 343-347: Distinction between "Extreme recklessness=murder" vs. "Recklessness=Manslaughter"
- **KEY**: Confirms this class is testing the line-drawing between these three categories

**Crim_Harcourt_Spring2021.docx.md** (Full Outline):
- Should contain detailed sections on unintended killings; look for case-by-case breakdown
- Compare past emphasis to current assignment

**Criminal Law_Spring 2023_Harcourt_Exam Outline - Tanisha Gupta.docx.md**:
- Check if any specific Harcourt preferences on how to structure recklessness analysis on exam
- Look for "HARCOURT LOVES THIS" notes related to recklessness vs. negligence

### Synthesis with Past Outlines

**What did past students emphasize?**
- Condensed outline emphasizes the **table approach**: extreme recklessness vs. recklessness vs. negligence as a spectrum
- Past students used Malone, Hall, Welansky as the three core cases (matches current assignment)
- Williams is treated as "overruled by statute" caveat (not heavily emphasized)

**Does current assignment match past emphasis?**
- **YES**: Current assignment focuses on same cases
- **HARCOURT SIGNAL**: The Condesned Outline's repeated emphasis on "extreme indifference" suggests this is what Harcourt tests hardest
- **Exam strategy**: Be able to distinguish extreme recklessness from ordinary recklessness in any hypo

## 10) Assigned Questions (From Syllabus)

### Focus Question 1: "What are the dimensions along which cases always seem to resolve?"

**Answer (using Harcourt's framework):**
The cases resolve along **three dimensions**:
1. **Awareness**: Is the defendant consciously aware of the risk (recklessness) or unaware but should have been (negligence)?
2. **Risk magnitude**: How substantial/high is the probability of death? (>50% = extreme; modest = ordinary; trivial = no liability)
3. **Care demonstrated**: How much does defendant's conduct deviate from the standard? (Extreme indifference → extreme recklessness; gross deviation → recklessness; failure to perceive → negligence)

These three dimensions map onto the gradations:
- **Malone (Russian roulette)**: Fully aware (1-in-6 odds), very high risk (~17%), extreme indifference (game with no purpose but risk) = extreme recklessness murder
- **Welansky (nightclub)**: Aware of crowding/exit issues, substantial risk (fire in crowded building), gross deviation (no safety plan) = recklessness manslaughter
- **Hall (shooting crowd)**: Aware of risk, very high probability of death (maybe >50%), extreme indifference = extreme recklessness murder
- **Williams (doctor)**: Unaware (missed diagnosis), substantial risk (failure to diagnose is dangerous), gross deviation (reasonable doc would have diagnosed) = negligent homicide

---

### Focus Question 2: "Do these dimensions make sense? Would you propose a different system?"

**Pro answer (supporting current law):**
Yes, these dimensions make sense because:
- **Culpability tracking**: The awareness/care dimensions track moral blameworthiness (aware + reckless > unaware + negligent)
- **Proportionality**: Punishment scales with culpability (murder > manslaughter > negligent homicide)
- **Deterrence**: Creates incentives to be aware of risks and take care (if you know the risk and disregard it, you get serious punishment)
- **Fairness**: Between innocent victim and risky defendant, risky defendant should bear cost (but only if culpable enough)

**Con answer (critical of current law):**
Issues with current system:
- **Where's the line?** Is "extreme indifference" clear, or is it jury gut-feeling? (Malone says Russian roulette, but what about driving at 100mph? Playing with fireworks?)
- **Awareness is hard to prove**: If defendant claims "I didn't know it was that risky," hard to disprove subjectively
- **Negligence over-criminalization**: Williams suggests we over-criminalize mistakes (now limited by statute, but debate continues)
- **Missing middle**: Between intentional murder and reckless manslaughter, we'd benefit from a "depraved heart" or "implied malice" category that's clearer

**Alternative system:**
- Require **intent to create risk** (not just awareness of risk) for recklessness
- Limit negligence liability to specific professions (medical malpractice, etc.)
- Use "depraved heart" (quasi-intentional) instead of "extreme recklessness" language

---

### Focus Question 3: "What purpose do these gradations serve for society?"

**Answer:**
The gradations serve several functions:
1. **Blame calibration**: We're expressing, through law, different degrees of moral culpability. Malone (Russian roulette) deserves harsher punishment than Welansky (business negligence)
2. **Deterrence & norm-setting**: By criminalizing extreme recklessness as murder, we signal "Don't play deadly games." By criminalizing recklessness as manslaughter, we signal "Businesses must take safety seriously."
3. **Fairness to victims**: A victim of Russian roulette vs. a victim of business negligence are harmed similarly (dead), but the defendant's culpability differs. The law adjusts punishment accordingly.
4. **Rule of law**: By having gradations with reasonably clear line-drawing, we reduce arbitrary prosecution. Prosecutors must fit facts into a category; can't charge Russian roulette as negligent homicide.
5. **Proportionality**: Preventing both over-punishment (charging doctor's mistake as murder) and under-punishment (charging Russian roulette as mere recklessness)

---

## 11) Practice Hypos (Fully Worked Out)

### Hypo 1: The Physics Demonstration

**Fact pattern:**
Professor Dr. Chen holds a lecture on gravity. To demonstrate, he throws a bowling ball off the roof of a 10-story building toward a crowded street below. He times it so that, by his calculations, the street is empty at that moment. However, 2 seconds into the fall (which he didn't account for), a pedestrian walks into the path, and the ball strikes them dead. Dr. Chen did not intend to hit anyone. He thought he was being careful by timing the street's emptiness.

**Analysis:**

**Charge 1: Intentional Murder?**
- No. Dr. Chen didn't intend to kill or cause bodily injury that would result in death.

**Charge 2: Extreme Recklessness Murder (Malone/Hall)?**
- Awareness: Did Dr. Chen know of the risk? Yes—he knew throwing a bowling ball from a roof is dangerous
- Risk magnitude: What's the probability of death? High (bowling ball from 10 stories is nearly certain to kill anyone it hits). Maybe not as high as Russian roulette (1-in-6) or shooting into crowd (>50%), but very high
- Care deviation: Does this show extreme indifference to human life? This is the key question.
  - Arguments for extreme recklessness: Throwing a deadly projectile in a public space, even if timed, shows reckless disregard. He's playing with a lethal weapon.
  - Arguments against: He took some precautions (timed the street's emptiness). He thought he was being careful. This suggests gross deviation from care (recklessness) but not extreme indifference.
- **Likely conclusion**: This is **recklessness (manslaughter), not extreme recklessness (murder)**. Unlike Malone or Hall, he took some precautions. He wasn't playing a deadly game; he was attempting a demonstration with (inadequate) safety measures.

**Charge 3: Recklessness Manslaughter?**
- Awareness: Yes, knew risk
- Risk magnitude: Substantial (very high, actually)
- Care deviation: Gross deviation (should not throw bowling balls from roofs in public areas)
- **Likely conclusion: YES, Recklessness Manslaughter**. The charge fits: Dr. Chen consciously disregarded a substantial risk of death.

**Charge 4: Negligent Homicide?**
- No. Dr. Chen was aware of the risk (so doesn't fit negligence's "unaware but should have been")

**Bottom line: Manslaughter (recklessness)**

### Hypo 2: The Faulty Brakes

**Fact pattern:**
Joe owns a car rental business. He knows that 15% of his fleet has faulty brakes (safety inspection found this, but he hasn't replaced the cars yet to save money). He rents a car with faulty brakes to a customer. The customer dies when the brakes fail on the highway. Joe didn't intend any harm. He thought the risk was "manageable" and that some customers might check their brakes anyway.

**Analysis:**

**Charge 1: Extreme Recklessness Murder?**
- Awareness: Joe knew the brakes were faulty. He was aware of the risk.
- Risk magnitude: 15% chance of brake failure leading to death. Is this extreme? Lower than Malone (17%) or Hall (>50%), but still substantial.
- Care deviation: Does this show extreme indifference? Arguments:
  - For extreme: He knowingly rents a car with faulty brakes; shows extreme indifference to customers' safety
  - Against: He thought the risk was "manageable"; this is careless but not quite extreme indifference to human life
- **Likely conclusion: RECKLESSNESS (Manslaughter), not extreme recklessness**. Unlike Malone or Hall, this isn't a game or obviously lethal weapon. It's a business decision (bad one) to save money.

**Charge 2: Recklessness Manslaughter?**
- Awareness: Yes, knew brakes were faulty
- Risk magnitude: Substantial (15% is significant)
- Care deviation: Gross deviation (any reasonable car rental would replace faulty brakes)
- **Yes, Recklessness Manslaughter**

**Charge 3: Negligent Homicide?**
- No. Joe was aware of the risk.

**Bottom line: Manslaughter (recklessness)**

**Exam note**: If facts said "Joe didn't know the brakes were faulty, but a reasonable inspection would have found it," then negligent homicide applies.

### Hypo 3: The Surgeon's Mistake (Williams-style)

**Fact pattern:**
Dr. Smith, a surgeon, performs surgery on a patient. During surgery, he fails to notice excessive bleeding, which a reasonable surgeon would have noticed (there were warning signs: low blood pressure, pale skin). The patient dies from blood loss that could have been prevented with a simple transfusion. Dr. Smith was not aware of the bleeding during surgery (genuinely missed it).

**Analysis:**

**Charge 1: Recklessness Manslaughter?**
- Awareness: Did Dr. Smith know of the risk? No. He didn't notice the bleeding.
- If unaware, this is NOT recklessness (recklessness requires conscious disregard)
- **No, not recklessness**

**Charge 2: Negligent Homicide?**
- Awareness: Dr. Smith was unaware, but a reasonable surgeon would have been aware
- Risk magnitude: Substantial (blood loss leading to death is a serious risk)
- Care deviation: Gross deviation (reasonable surgeon would have noticed warning signs)
- **Possibly yes, but with caveat:**
  - Under Williams, this could be negligent homicide
  - Under modern law (gross negligence standard), courts ask: "Is this mere professional error, or gross negligence?"
  - Likely argument: This is ordinary negligence (missed signs, happens occasionally even with good doctors), not gross negligence
  - **Many modern jurisdictions would NOT prosecute** (civil malpractice, yes; criminal, no)

**Bottom line: Possibly negligent homicide, but modern law limits this to gross negligence, and Dr. Smith's conduct may not meet that threshold. More likely civil liability (malpractice suit) than criminal liability.**

**Exam note**: Be sure to note the caveat: "Williams suggests negligent homicide, but modern law requires gross negligence, not mere professional error."

## 12) Exam Alignment & Strategy

**What Harcourt tests (based on past outlines):**
1. **Line-drawing between extreme recklessness and ordinary recklessness** (50% of exam points on this topic)
2. **Awareness as the key to recklessness vs. negligence** (30% of exam points)
3. **Policy rationale for gradations** (20% of exam points)

**Exam strategy:**
- **Step 1**: Always identify whether defendant was aware of the risk (conscious disregard → recklessness; unaware → negligence)
- **Step 2**: Assess risk magnitude using probability analysis (Hall approach)
- **Step 3**: Determine whether conduct shows extreme indifference (Malone/Hall) or ordinary recklessness (Welansky)
- **Step 4**: State both charge and explain why one is more appropriate
- **Step 5**: Include the caveat on negligent homicide (gross negligence standard in modern law)

**Common exam structure:**
- Fact pattern with death
- Multiple defendant actors (e.g., boss + employee)
- Ambiguity about awareness (was defendant truly unaware, or just claiming ignorance?)
- You must charge both/all defendants and explain gradations

**Pro tip**: If unsure between recklessness and extreme recklessness, charge both and explain the line-drawing. Harcourt appreciates nuance.
