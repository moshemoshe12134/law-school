## CORE DOCTRINE

### The one-sentence rule (what you say out loud)
Criminal liability requires conduct that includes a **voluntary act** (or a legally significant **omission**); courts often fight over **how to define “the act”** (narrow vs broad time frame).

### How to analyze any actus reus problem (fast)
1. **Identify the statute’s conduct element** (“does X,” “appears in Y,” “possesses Z,” etc.).
2. Ask: **What is the act?** (bodily movement? omission? possession?)
3. Ask: **Is it voluntary?**
   - If the moment looks involuntary (seizure, blackout, reflex), ask whether there is an **earlier voluntary act** in the same course of conduct.
4. If omission: ask whether there is a **legal duty** to act (Jones categories).
5. If possession: ask whether the person **knowingly procured/received** or was **aware of control long enough** to terminate it.

### MPC text (verbatim)
Source: `Admin/Sources/Past_Outlines/MPC Supplement.docx.md`

#### MPC §1.13(2) “act”
```text
(2) "act" or "action" means a bodily movement whether voluntary or involuntary;
```

#### MPC §1.13(9) “element of an offense”
```text
(9) "element of an offense" means (i) such conduct or (ii) such attendant circumstances or (iii) such a result of conduct as
    (a) is included in the description of the forbidden conduct in the definition of the offense; or
    (b) establishes the required kind of culpability; or
    (c) negatives an excuse or justification for such conduct; or
    (d) negatives a defense under the statute of limitations; or
    (e) establishes jurisdiction or venue;
```

#### MPC §2.01 Requirement of Voluntary Act; Omission; Possession
```text
(1) A person is not guilty of an offense unless his liability is based on conduct which includes a voluntary act or the omission to perform an act of which he is physically capable.

(2) The following are not voluntary acts within the meaning of this Section:
    (a) a reflex or convulsion;
    (b) a bodily movement during unconsciousness or sleep;
    (c) conduct during hypnosis or resulting from hypnotic suggestion;
    (d) a bodily movement that otherwise is not a product of the effort or determination of the actor, either conscious or habitual.

(3) Liability for the commission of an offense may not be based on an omission unaccompanied by action unless:
    (a) the omission is expressly made sufficient by the law defining the offense; or
    (b) a duty to perform the omitted act is otherwise imposed by law.

(4) Possession is an act, within the meaning of this Section, if the possessor knowingly procured or received the thing possessed or was aware of his control thereof for a sufficient period to have been able to terminate his possession.
```

### Key contrasts Harcourt will care about
- **“Act” vs “voluntary act”**: MPC defines “act” broadly, but liability still requires “voluntary act” (or omission).
- **Narrow vs broad framing**: courts can define the relevant act at different time scales; that choice can flip voluntariness.
- **Omissions**: not “bad personhood,” but *legal duty* problems.

## EXPECTED HARCOURT QUESTIONS (Q→A)

### Big-picture / framing questions

**Q: Why does criminal law require a voluntary act?**
**A:** Because punishment is supposed to track agency: you can’t deter or morally blame reflexes/blackouts/seizures the same way you can blame chosen conduct. Also, it’s a limiting principle against criminalizing mere status.
**Alternate plausible answer:** It’s less about metaphysical free will and more about administrability and legitimacy: without an “act,” the state’s power becomes unbounded.
**Likely pushback:** “But courts still punish ‘involuntary’ harms by redefining the act earlier. So is it real?” → “It’s real sometimes, but malleable; the malleability itself reflects policy choices.”

**Q: What is the *real* fight in actus reus cases?**
**A:** What we call “the act.” If you pick a narrow time slice, the moment may look involuntary; if you broaden the slice, you can often find an earlier voluntary choice that supports liability.

### Doctrine parsing questions (MPC-focused)

**Q: Under MPC §2.01, what counts as “not voluntary”?**
**A:** Reflex/convulsion; movements during unconsciousness or sleep; hypnosis; and movements not the product of effort or determination.
**Likely pushback:** “Is ‘habit’ voluntary?” → MPC’s language treats “effort or determination” as including habitual action, so habitual can still be voluntary.

**Q: Can the prosecution satisfy §2.01 by pointing to a voluntary act earlier in time?**
**A:** Often yes, if the earlier voluntary act is part of the “conduct” that grounds liability (Decina-style framing). The contest is whether the earlier act is too remote or whether the statute’s conduct element requires the later moment.

**Q: When can an omission be the basis of liability?**
**A:** Only if omission liability is expressly made sufficient by the offense definition, or a legal duty to act is otherwise imposed by law (§2.01(3)).

**Q: What’s the shortest correct statement of the Jones duty rule?**
**A:** Four sources of legal duty: statute; status relationship; contract; voluntary assumption of care plus seclusion of the helpless person.

### Case-based questions

**Q: Martin — what is the voluntary act problem?**
**A:** The statute punished being drunk “in public.” Martin’s “in public” presence was forced by police; the prosecution couldn’t prove the proscribed conduct was voluntary in the way the statute requires.
**Alternate plausible answer:** The voluntary act requirement is satisfied by “getting drunk,” but that’s a different act than the statute criminalizes; the court ties voluntariness to the statutory conduct element (appearing in public).
**Likely pushback:** “So why not broaden the frame and convict?” → “That would be rewriting the statute’s conduct element; the court refuses.”

**Q: Newton — what’s the holding you can say in one line?**
**A:** If there’s evidence of involuntary unconsciousness, the jury must be instructed that unconsciousness can be a complete defense because it negates voluntariness.

**Q: Decina — what’s the best prosecution story in one line?**
**A:** The voluntary act is the earlier choice to drive knowing about the seizure risk; the seizure itself is involuntary, but the course of conduct includes a voluntary act that creates the lethal risk.

**Q: Decina — what’s the best defense story?**
**A:** The “killing” results from an involuntary seizure; punishing as if the death-causing act were voluntary collapses voluntariness into negligence/recklessness and lets courts backfill liability by broad framing.

## CASE BRIEFS

These briefs are based on `Admin/Sources/Past_Outlines/Crim_Spring 2025_Harcourt_Full.docx.md` (priors), not verbatim casebook text.

<details>
<summary>Martin v. State (AL 1944) — Voluntary Act — Police Forced “Public” Element</summary>

- **Facts (outline):** Martin was drunk; police took him onto a public highway; he allegedly manifested drunkenness there.
- **Statute (outline excerpt):** punished appearing intoxicated in a public place and manifesting drunkenness by boisterous/indecent conduct or loud/profane discourse.
- **Issue:** Can liability be imposed if the proscribed conduct (appearing in public while drunk) was involuntary?
- **Holding:** No conviction on this proof; the “public” appearance can’t be established by proof the accused was carried there by police.
- **Why Harcourt assigns it:** clean example that voluntariness can be tied to the statute’s conduct element (not to “bad character”).
- **Exam trigger fact:** state actors or third parties force the element into existence.

</details>

<details>
<summary>People v. Newton (CA 1970) — Unconsciousness — Voluntariness Negated</summary>

- **Facts (outline):** Newton charged with murder of an officer after a struggle; possible he was shot first and suffered a “profound shock reaction,” losing consciousness.
- **Issue:** Was it error to refuse an unconsciousness instruction?
- **Holding:** Yes; where there is evidence of involuntary unconsciousness (not induced by intoxication, etc.), refusal of the requested instruction is prejudicial error; unconsciousness can be a complete defense.
- **Why Harcourt assigns it:** shows that voluntariness can fail even when the body “moves”; the question is whether movement is a product of effort/determination.
- **Exam trigger fact:** blackout/shock state; dispute about whether the defendant was conscious at the critical moment.

</details>

<details>
<summary>People v. Decina (NY 1956) — Epileptic Driver — “Prior Voluntary Act” Framing</summary>

- **Facts (outline):** Defendant prone to seizures; drove; had a seizure while driving; killed four people; charged with criminal negligence in operation of a vehicle causing death.
- **Issue:** Is the defendant’s act voluntary for actus reus purposes?
- **Holding:** Yes (outline): awareness of condition + disregard of consequences supports liability.
- **Why Harcourt assigns it:** the classic “broad time frame” move—courts locate the voluntary act earlier (the decision to drive with known risk).
- **Exam trigger fact:** the moment of harm looks involuntary, but there is a prior choice that created the risk.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Jones v. U.S. (DC 1962) — Omissions — Legal Duty Requirement</summary>

- **Facts (outline):** Defendant convicted of involuntary manslaughter for failing to provide for a ten‑month‑old child in her care; details unclear (e.g., payment), but defendant had means to provide.
- **Issue:** Must the prosecution prove a legal duty to act to convict for omission?
- **Holding:** Yes. Four situations where failure to act may constitute a breach of legal duty: (i) statute; (ii) status relationship; (iii) contract; (iv) voluntary assumption of care + seclusion preventing others from rendering aid.
- **Why Harcourt assigns it:** omissions doctrine is a boundary on state power; “bad person” is not enough—duty must be legal.
- **Exam trigger fact:** failure to feed/call for help; question becomes which duty category applies.

</details>

## POLICY / THEORY

### Kelman “time-framing” (what you should be able to say)
The same incident can be described narrowly or broadly in time, and that descriptive choice often determines whether conduct is labeled voluntary or involuntary, culpable or excusable.

**How it applies today:**
- Narrow frame can make Martin look blameless (forced into public).
- Broad frame can make Decina look culpable (choice to drive with known seizure risk).
- The court’s choice of frame is not purely “logical”; it’s a policy/values choice about what counts as “the act.”

### Harcourt-style exam move
When voluntariness is contested, write both framings explicitly:
- **Defense (narrow):** isolate the involuntary moment (seizure, blackout, forced movement).
- **Prosecution (broad):** locate the earlier voluntary choice that created the risk (driving, bringing contraband into custody, etc.).
Then explain why the court (or the statute) should pick one frame over the other (deterrence, fairness, administrability, statutory fidelity).

### Missing source note (important)
The syllabus assigns Kelman’s article, but it isn’t stored in this repo. If you want quote-level accuracy, add the PDF/text to `Admin/Sources/Source_Material/Supplement/` and regenerate this section.

## QUICK HYPOS (≥5)

### Hypo 1 — Sleepwalking assault
D sleepwalks and punches roommate, causing injury.
- **Prosecution best:** try to find an earlier voluntary act that creates liability (usually hard on these facts).
- **Defense best:** §2.01(2)(b) movements during sleep are not voluntary; no voluntary act.
- **Harcourt push:** “Are we comfortable letting this go entirely? What would the limiting principle be if we expand liability?”

### Hypo 2 — Epileptic driver variant
D has known seizures, drives anyway, seizure occurs, pedestrian dies.
- **Prosecution best:** Decina framing: voluntary act is the decision to drive with known risk.
- **Defense best:** focus on the death-causing moment as involuntary; argue remoteness or that mens rea should do the work (don’t let actus reus collapse into negligence).
- **Harcourt push:** “Is the difference between Martin and Decina just a policy choice dressed up as doctrine?”

### Hypo 3 — Police transport to “public” element
D intoxicated in private; police carry D onto sidewalk and cite for public intoxication.
- **Prosecution best:** argue any voluntary drunkenness suffices, or that the statute targets intoxication status.
- **Defense best:** Martin: the conduct element “in public” wasn’t voluntary.
- **Harcourt push:** “Is the statute really about location, or about public order? Should that matter?”

### Hypo 4 — Omission: babysitting
D agrees to watch friend’s infant for the weekend; doesn’t feed; infant dies.
- **Prosecution best:** Jones duty via contract (explicit or implied) and/or voluntary assumption + seclusion.
- **Defense best:** challenge duty category; argue no seclusion or unclear assumption; contest causation facts.
- **Harcourt push:** “Should moral obligation be enough, or must it be legal duty?”

### Hypo 5 — Possession-as-act
D is arrested; police find drugs in D’s pocket at booking. D claims police forced him into the station and he didn’t “act” in jail.
- **Prosecution best:** MPC §2.01(4): possession is an act if D knowingly procured/received or was aware long enough to terminate control.
- **Defense best:** argue no meaningful chance to terminate control (timing; coercion); try to analogize to Martin-like compulsion.
- **Harcourt push:** “Where exactly is the voluntary act—acquiring, continuing to possess, or failing to discard?”
