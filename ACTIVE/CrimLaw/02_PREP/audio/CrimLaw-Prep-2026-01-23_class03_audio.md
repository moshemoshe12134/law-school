# Audio Prep — Class #3 — Mens Rea

**Audio length: ~28 minutes | Listen before class on Friday, January 23, 2026**

---

## INTRO (2 minutes)

Welcome back. Today we're covering mens rea—the mental state requirement for criminal liability. This is foundational. If actus reus asked "what did you do?", mens rea asks "what was going through your head when you did it?"

Why this matters: criminal law doesn't just punish harmful acts. It punishes culpable mental states. The same physical act—say, killing someone—can be murder, manslaughter, or no crime at all depending on your mental state when it happened.

By the end of this prep, you'll understand:
1. The four MPC mental states and how they differ
2. How to map mental states onto specific elements of a statute
3. When courts use subjective versus objective standards
4. How to argue both prosecution and defense using recurring legal arguments

Let's start with the basic architecture: MPC Section 2.02.

---

## PART 1: The MPC Mental State Hierarchy (7 minutes)

### The four levels

MPC Section 2.02 creates a four-tier hierarchy of culpability. From highest to lowest: Purposely, Knowingly, Recklessly, Negligently.

**Purposely** means you *wanted* it to happen. Your conscious object was to engage in that conduct or cause that result. If the element involves attendant circumstances, you either knew they existed or hoped they did. Classic example: you pull the trigger *intending* to kill.

**Knowingly** means you were *practically certain* it would happen. You might not have wanted it, but you knew it would result from what you were doing. Example: you set fire to a building to collect insurance. You're practically certain people sleeping inside will die, even if that's not your goal.

Key distinction from Purposely: Knowledge doesn't require desire. You can know something will happen and do it anyway, even if you wish it wouldn't.

**Recklessly** means you *consciously disregarded* a substantial and unjustifiable risk. You knew there was a real chance this bad thing would happen, and you did it anyway. The risk must be substantial enough that ignoring it is a "gross deviation" from how a law-abiding person would act.

Critical detail: recklessness requires *subjective awareness*. You actually thought about the risk, then decided to take it. That's what separates it from negligence.

**Negligently** means you *should have known* about the risk, but didn't. A reasonable person in your situation would have perceived it. Your failure to notice represents a gross deviation from the standard of care.

Key distinction from Recklessness: this is *objective*. We're not asking what you actually thought. We're asking what you should have thought.

### Why the hierarchy matters

The MPC Section 2.02(5) says these mental states are cumulative. If a statute requires negligence, recklessness satisfies it. If it requires recklessness, knowledge satisfies it. And so on. Higher mental states automatically satisfy lower thresholds.

This matters tactically. If you're a prosecutor, you want to argue for the lowest mental state the statute allows, because that's easiest to prove. If you're defense, you want to argue for the highest, most demanding standard.

### The "gross deviation" qualifier

Notice that recklessness and negligence both require a "gross deviation"—from the standard of conduct for recklessness, from the standard of care for negligence. This is the line between criminal law and tort law. Simple negligence might get you sued. Criminal negligence requires something worse—a gross, shocking deviation.

---

## PART 2: Element-by-Element Analysis (5 minutes)

### The three types of elements

MPC Section 1.13 breaks criminal statutes into three element types:

**Conduct** is the act itself—the verb. "Sells," "kills," "possesses."

**Attendant circumstances** are facts that must exist when you act. "The buyer is a minor." "The property belongs to someone else." "You're inside a dwelling."

**Result** is what happens because of your conduct. "The victim dies." "The building burns."

Why this matters: mental states attach *separately* to each element. You might act knowingly as to your conduct but only recklessly as to the result. Element-by-element analysis is the engine of modern criminal law.

### The distribution rules

MPC Section 2.02(4) says if a statute prescribes one mental state "without distinguishing among the material elements," that mental state distributes to *all* material elements—unless a contrary purpose plainly appears.

Example: "Whoever knowingly sells alcohol to a minor." Does "knowingly" apply just to "sells," or also to "minor"? Section 2.02(4) says it distributes to both unless there's a contrary purpose.

This is a constant fight. Prosecution wants narrow distribution. Defense wants broad distribution. The phrase "contrary purpose plainly appears" is where the battle happens.

### The silence rule

MPC Section 2.02(3) handles gaps. If the statute doesn't specify a mental state for an element, the default is *recklessness*. Not strict liability. Not negligence. Recklessness.

This is a deliberate floor. The MPC drafters thought criminal punishment requires at least conscious risk-taking.

## PART 3: The Cases—Subjective vs. Objective Standards (8 minutes)

### Cunningham and Faulkner: The turn to subjective culpability

**Regina v. Cunningham** (1957): Defendant ripped a gas meter off a wall to steal coins. Gas leaked into the neighbor's house, poisoning her. He was charged with "maliciously administering a noxious thing."

The court held "malice" doesn't mean general wickedness. It means either (1) actual intent to harm, or (2) recklessness—*foresight* that harm was possible. The conviction was quashed because the jury wasn't asked whether he *actually foresaw* the risk of gas poisoning.

**Regina v. Faulkner** (1877): Sailor steals rum from the hold of a ship. He lights a match to see in the dark, accidentally sets fire to rum, burns down the entire ship. Convicted of arson.

Court quashed the conviction. His intent to steal rum doesn't transfer to intent to burn the ship. You need specific mens rea for the specific harm.

**What these cases establish:** Mens rea is element-specific and subjective. You can't be "generally bad" and held liable for every consequence. You must have the requisite mental state for *this particular* harm.

This is the foundation of modern culpability analysis. It's a shift from "he's a bad guy, so he's guilty" to "did he *think about* this specific risk?"

### Hazelwood vs. Santillanes: The negligence fight

**State v. Hazelwood** (Alaska 1997): Captain of the Exxon Valdez. Ship runs aground, spills 11 million gallons of oil. Alaska statute: "a person commits a misdemeanor if the person negligently discharges petroleum."

Court upholds conviction based on *ordinary civil negligence*. No requirement of criminal negligence (gross deviation).

**Santillanes v. New Mexico** (1993): Defendant's nephew cuts his neck on glass during "discipline." Statute: "child abuse is negligently causing injury."

New Mexico Supreme Court says "negligently" in a criminal statute means *criminal negligence*, not ordinary negligence. Criminal law requires a culpability threshold that matches the stigma of conviction.

**The core fight:** Is "negligence" in a criminal statute the same as tort negligence, or does it mean something more? Hazelwood says ordinary negligence suffices for regulatory offenses with low penalties. Santillanes says criminal stigma requires criminal negligence.

**How to argue this:**

Prosecution frame: This is a public welfare statute. The defendant is a professional in a regulated industry. Ordinary negligence is enough to deter harmful conduct. Focus is prevention, not moral blame.

Defense frame: Criminal conviction carries stigma. We don't criminalize every careless mistake. "Negligence" must mean criminal negligence—a gross deviation—or we collapse the line between criminal and civil liability.

### Elonis: Statutory interpretation and mens rea defaults

**Elonis v. United States** (2015): Defendant posted violent rap lyrics on Facebook about his wife and the FBI. Charged with "transmitting a threat." Question: Is a "threat" measured by what a reasonable person would think (objective), or what the defendant intended (subjective)?

Supreme Court holds the statute requires *at least* recklessness. Negligence—a reasonable person standard—isn't enough for criminal liability here.

The Court avoided the constitutional question by reading a mens rea requirement *into* the statute. When Congress is silent, criminal statutes generally require awareness of wrongdoing.

**The broader principle:** Courts are reluctant to impose criminal liability for mere negligence, especially for speech-related offenses. The presumption is that criminal law requires subjective culpability.

## PART 4: Balkin's Recurring Argument Pairs (3 minutes)

### The structure of legal argument

Jack Balkin argues that legal reasoning isn't random. Lawyers and judges cycle through a small set of recurring argument pairs. Once you see the pattern, you can deploy these moves fast.

**Key pairs for mens rea:**

**Subjective culpability vs. objective social protection**  
Defense: Criminal stigma requires proof of actual fault—what the defendant knew or intended.  
Prosecution: We protect society by punishing dangerous conduct, even without evil intent.

**Autonomy vs. deterrence**  
Defense: Punishing someone who didn't foresee the harm violates autonomy and fairness.  
Prosecution: Deterrence works by making people more careful. We don't need to prove subjective awareness.

**Rules vs. standards**  
Prosecution: Objective standards create clear, administrable rules. Easy to apply.  
Defense: Subjective standards allow context-sensitive fairness. Mechanical rules miss moral nuance.

**Narrow vs. broad framing** (Kelman)  
Defense: Narrow the time frame. At the moment of harm, defendant lacked awareness.  
Prosecution: Broaden the frame. Defendant made a voluntary choice earlier that created the risk.

These pairs show up in every mens rea case. Your job is to pick the pair, choose a side, and state the payoff clearly.

## COLD CALL PREP (3 minutes)

If Harcourt asks you to define the four mental states...

**Purposely:** Conscious object to cause that result or engage in that conduct.  
**Knowingly:** Practically certain the result will occur, or aware that circumstances exist.  
**Recklessly:** Consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk. Subjective awareness.  
**Negligently:** Should have been aware of the risk. Objective standard.

If he asks about the default rules...

**Silence rule (2.02(3)):** If statute doesn't specify mens rea, default is recklessness for each material element.  
**Distribution rule (2.02(4)):** If statute prescribes one mens rea without distinguishing elements, it applies to all elements unless contrary purpose plainly appears.

If he asks you to model a statute...

Break it into elements: conduct, attendant circumstances, result. Identify which are material. Map the mens rea word onto each element. If there's ambiguity, argue both sides using Section 2.02(4).

If he asks about Cunningham or Faulkner...

Core principle: Mens rea is element-specific and subjective. You can't be guilty based on general bad character. You need the requisite mental state for the specific harm.

If he asks about ordinary negligence vs. criminal negligence...

Prosecution: Regulatory statutes with low penalties can use ordinary negligence to deter.  
Defense: Criminal stigma requires criminal negligence—a gross deviation.

## 60-SECOND RECAP (1 minute)

If you remember nothing else, remember this:

1. Four mental states: Purposely (wanted it), Knowingly (practically certain), Recklessly (conscious disregard), Negligently (should have known).

2. Recklessness vs. Negligence: The key is *awareness*. Recklessness is subjective (you knew the risk). Negligence is objective (you should have known).

3. Element-by-element analysis: Mental states attach separately to conduct, circumstances, and results.

4. Default rules: Silence = recklessness (2.02(3)). One mens rea word distributes to all elements unless contrary purpose plainly appears (2.02(4)).

5. Core case principles: Cunningham and Faulkner establish subjective, element-specific mens rea. Hazelwood vs. Santillanes shows the fight over ordinary vs. criminal negligence.

## CLOSING (1 minute)

Today's class will be dense. Harcourt will drill you on definitions, ask you to model statutes on the fly, and push you to argue both sides. Have the MPC text open. Know where to find Sections 2.02(3) and 2.02(4). Be ready to distinguish recklessness from negligence—that's the line he'll press hardest.

The intellectual move here is recognizing that mens rea isn't just about fairness. It's about deciding what kind of behavior we want to deter and what kind of mistakes we're willing to tolerate. When courts choose subjective vs. objective standards, they're making policy choices about autonomy, safety, and the function of criminal law.

You're ready. See you in class.
