# Audio Prep — Class #2 — Actus Reus

**Audio length: ~28 minutes | Listen before class on Thursday, January 22, 2026**

---

## INTRO (2 minutes)

Welcome to your first real doctrine class in Criminal Law. Today's topic is actus reus, which sounds like scary Latin, but it's actually testing a simple moral intuition: the state shouldn't punish you unless you actually DID something.

Here's the key insight walking into class today: Criminal law doesn't just need a bad result. It doesn't even just need a bodily movement. It needs what the law calls a voluntary act, or sometimes an omission with a legal duty to act. And the entire game today is going to be figuring out what counts as "voluntary" and what counts as "the act."

By the end of this audio prep, you'll be ready to handle three things in class:

First, you'll understand the voluntary act requirement - what it is, why we have it, and what the MPC says about it.

Second, you'll be able to walk through the four main cases: Martin, Newton, Decina, and Jones. Each one tests a different edge case of voluntariness.

Third, you'll understand Kelman's time-framing critique, which is Harcourt's signature critical theory move. Courts manipulate when "the act" begins, and that manipulation determines the outcome.

Let's start with why we even care about voluntary acts.

---

## PART 1: WHY THE VOLUNTARY ACT REQUIREMENT EXISTS (4 minutes)

### The moral core

At bottom, the voluntary act requirement is about moral culpability. We only punish people for things they chose to do, not for accidents, reflexes, or things that just happened to their bodies.

Think about it this way: If lightning strikes you and your body falls onto someone and hurts them, should you go to prison? Obviously not. Your body moved, there was a bad result, but there was no crime because you didn't DO anything. No choice, no culpability, no punishment.

The voluntary act requirement separates three types of things: First, voluntary acts - things you chose to do. Second, involuntary acts - bodily movements that aren't really yours, like reflexes or movements during unconsciousness. Third, status - just being a certain type of person, like being an addict or being epileptic.

Criminal law can only punish the first category. Punishing involuntary acts or status would violate basic fairness.

### Three justifications you should know

When Harcourt pushes you on why we have this requirement, you want three justifications ready:

One: Fair notice. You can only conform your conduct to law if you can control your actions. If the law punishes reflexes or unconscious movements, you can't avoid punishment no matter what you do. That violates the rule of law.

Two: Deterrence. Punishment only works if people can choose not to act. Threatening to punish reflexes won't stop reflexes from happening. It's just pointless suffering.

Three: Moral condemnation. Criminal punishment isn't just about consequences - it's about moral blame. And we can't morally blame someone for something they didn't choose to do. That's what separates criminal law from tort law, where you might have to pay damages even for an accident.

### How this connects to everything else

Here's something important: The voluntary act requirement is technically part of actus reus - the conduct element of a crime. It's separate from mens rea, which is about your mental state. But in practice, they're deeply connected because both go to culpability.

You'll see courts sometimes blur the line. When a court can't find a voluntary act, it might use mens rea instead - like saying someone acted "knowingly" or "recklessly" to fill in the culpability gap. Harcourt will want you to notice when that's happening.

---

## PART 2: WHAT THE MPC SAYS (5 minutes)

### Three critical MPC provisions

The Model Penal Code has three provisions you need to know cold. Let me walk through them.

First, MPC section one point thirteen, subsection two defines "act." It says: An act means a bodily movement whether voluntary or involuntary. Notice what's doing there: ANY bodily movement is an act - voluntary or not. Thoughts alone aren't acts. Wishing harm on someone isn't an act. But any physical movement counts as an act, even if it's involuntary.

Second, MPC section two point zero one is the critical one. It lays out the voluntary act requirement. Subsection one says: A person is not guilty of an offense unless his liability is based on conduct that includes a voluntary act or the omission to perform an act of which he is physically capable.

Parse that language carefully. It says conduct must INCLUDE a voluntary act. Not that every act must be voluntary. Just that somewhere in the conduct, there has to be at least one voluntary act. That word "includes" is going to be really important in the Decina case.

Third, section two point zero one subsection two gives you a list of what's NOT voluntary. Memorize this list because Harcourt loves MPC close reading:

Not voluntary: Letter A - a reflex or convulsion. Letter B - a bodily movement during unconsciousness or sleep. Letter C - conduct during hypnosis or resulting from hypnotic suggestion. Letter D - a bodily movement that otherwise is not a product of the effort or determination of the actor, either conscious or habitual.

Notice that last one says "either conscious or habitual." That means habitual acts CAN be voluntary. If you always scratch your nose when you're nervous and you do it out of habit, that's still voluntary because it's a product of your determination, even if it's not consciously thought through.

### Possession as a special case

One more MPC thing: Section two point zero one subsection four covers possession. It says possession is an act if the possessor knowingly procured or received the thing possessed, OR was aware of his control for a sufficient period to have been able to terminate his possession.

So if someone hands you a stolen gun for a second and you drop it immediately, maybe no possession. But if you hold it for thirty seconds, you were aware of control long enough to put it down, so that counts as an act.

This matters for drug possession and weapons possession crimes.

---

## PART 3: THE CASES - TESTING THE BOUNDARIES (9 minutes)

### Martin v. State - the easy case

Let's start with the clearest case. Martin was drunk at home. Police arrested him at his home and physically carried him out onto a public highway. He was then convicted under a statute that said: Any person who while intoxicated appears in any public place shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

The court reversed the conviction. Why? Because the statute requires "appearing" in a public place - that's an act. But Martin didn't voluntarily appear there. He was carried there by police against his will. No voluntary act, no conviction.

Now, here's what makes this interesting for Harcourt: You might say, "Wait, Martin chose to get drunk. Isn't getting drunk a voluntary act?" And the answer is: Yes, but that's not the act the statute criminalizes. The statute punishes appearing in public while drunk, not getting drunk. The relevant act for actus reus is the act described in the statute - the public appearance. And THAT act was involuntary.

This case introduces what we call the time-framing problem. We could define "the conduct" broadly - starting when Martin decided to drink - or narrowly - just the moment of being in public. The court chooses the narrow framing, so Martin wins.

### People v. Newton - unconsciousness defense

Newton is more complex. Newton was a Black Panther member stopped by Oakland police. There was a struggle. The officer shot Newton in the abdomen. Then the officer was killed by gunshot. Newton's defense: I was unconscious from being shot, so when the officer died, I wasn't voluntarily acting.

The California Court of Appeals agreed that unconsciousness is a complete defense - if you're unconscious when you pull the trigger, there's no voluntary act. The case was reversed because the jury instruction was wrong. The instruction suggested unconsciousness might only reduce murder to manslaughter. But that's incorrect. If you're truly unconscious, you're not guilty at all - complete defense, not partial.

Now, here's where Harcourt will push: Newton had been in a voluntary confrontation with the police before he was shot. Could we say his voluntary act of confronting armed police satisfies the actus reus requirement, even if he was unconscious at the moment he pulled the trigger? 

The court says no - we need voluntariness at the moment of the harmful act. But keep Newton in mind when we get to Decina, because Decina goes the other way.

### People v. Decina - the time-framing manipulation

This is the big one. Decina had epilepsy. He knew he was subject to seizures. Despite knowing this, he drove a car. While driving, he had a seizure. The car went out of control, jumped a curb, and killed four children. Decina was charged with criminal negligence and homicide.

His defense: No voluntary act. The seizure was involuntary, so the harmful act - driving during the seizure - was involuntary.

The New York Court of Appeals said: Conviction affirmed. Here's their logic: The MPC says conduct must INCLUDE a voluntary act. It doesn't say the immediate harmful act must be voluntary. Decina's voluntary act was choosing to drive knowing he had a seizure condition. That voluntary act set in motion the chain of events. So even though the seizure itself was involuntary, there was a sufficient voluntary act earlier in the sequence.

Now, here's the critical theory payoff. This is pure time-framing. The court defines "the act" broadly - starting with the decision to drive. If they had defined "the act" narrowly - as the moment of the seizure - Decina would win, just like Martin and Newton.

The court has complete discretion to pick the time frame. They could frame it as "getting in the car knowing you have seizures" - voluntary. Or "having a seizure while driving" - involuntary. Same facts, different frame, opposite results.

This is Mark Kelman's critical legal studies point. Courts have interpretive flexibility to manipulate outcomes by choosing how to define "the act." There's no neutral principle determining which frame is correct. It's just a policy choice dressed up as doctrinal analysis.

Harcourt loves this point. He'll push you: "How is Decina different from Martin? In both cases, we could find an earlier voluntary act. Martin chose to drink. Decina chose to drive. Why does the time-framing work for Decina but not Martin?"

The answer is: The court wants to convict Decina but not Martin, so they manipulate the frame to get there.

### Jones v. United States - omissions are different

The last case is about omissions. Jones took care of a baby. The baby became ill and died from malnutrition and neglect. Jones was charged with involuntary manslaughter by omission - failure to provide food and medical care.

Judge Burger's opinion lays out the rule for omission liability. Three elements: One, legal duty to act. Two, knowledge of facts giving rise to the duty. Three, physical capability to act.

The interesting part is what creates a legal duty. Burger gives five categories:

One: Statute. The law explicitly says you must act.

Two: Status relationship. You're a parent, spouse, or similar relationship with special obligations.

Three: Contract. You undertook a contractual obligation to care for someone.

Four: Voluntary assumption. You took on the duty to help someone, and they relied on you.

Five: Creation of peril. You created the dangerous situation, so you have a duty to fix it.

These are the ONLY ways you get a legal duty. American law does not have a general duty to rescue strangers. If you walk past a drowning child and you could easily save them with no risk, you have no legal duty to act. You might be a terrible person, but you're not a criminal.

The court in Jones reversed because the jury instruction didn't explain these duty categories. On remand, the jury needed to hear: Did Jones have a legal duty under one of these five categories?

For class today: if you get an omission hypothetical, always walk through these five categories and identify which one applies. Don't just say "there's a duty." Say "This is a relationship duty because parent-child" or "This is voluntary assumption because Jones agreed to take care of the baby and the mother relied on that."

## PART 4: POSSESSION AS AN ACT (2 minutes)

Quick note on possession crimes. The MPC treats possession as a type of act, but only if it's knowing. Section two point zero one subsection four: Possession is an act if you knowingly procured or received it, OR you were aware of control for sufficient time to terminate possession.

So if police plant drugs in your bag without your knowledge, no possession act - you didn't knowingly procure it and you weren't aware of control.

If someone hands you drugs for one second and you immediately throw them away, maybe no possession - not sufficient time to terminate.

But if you hold drugs for a minute, knowing what they are, that's sufficient awareness and sufficient time. Possession is an act.

This comes up on exams in possession-of-stolen-property hypos or drug possession. Always ask: Did defendant knowingly procure? Or aware of control for sufficient time?

## COLD CALL PREP (4 minutes)

Let's get you ready for Socratic dialogue. Here are the most likely questions and your answer starters.

### If professor asks about the voluntary act requirement

Question you might hear: "Why do we require a voluntary act? What's the point?"

Answer starter: "Three reasons. First, fair notice - you can only obey law if you control your actions. Second, deterrence - punishment doesn't deter reflexes. Third, moral culpability - we can't blame people for things they didn't choose."

Follow-up: "But don't we sometimes punish based on status, like being a felon in possession of a gun?"

Your response: "That's still an act - possessing. MPC section two point zero one subsection four makes possession an act if knowing. We're not punishing the status of being a felon; we're punishing the act of a felon possessing a gun."

### If professor asks about Martin

Question you might hear: "Martin chose to get drunk. Why isn't that a sufficient voluntary act?"

Answer starter: "Because the statute criminalizes appearing in public while drunk, not getting drunk. The actus reus has to match the statute's conduct element. The public appearance was involuntary because police carried him there."

Follow-up: "But couldn't we just say getting drunk started a chain of events?"

Your response: "We could - that's the time-framing issue. But the court chose a narrow frame here. Compare Decina, where the court used a broad frame. The difference shows interpretive flexibility, not a neutral rule."

### If professor asks about Decina

Question you might hear: "How is Decina different from Newton? Both involved involuntary conduct after voluntary conduct."

Answer starter: "In Newton, the court required voluntariness at the moment of the criminal act - pulling the trigger. In Decina, the court said conduct must only INCLUDE a voluntary act, so the earlier act of driving knowing about seizures was sufficient. The MPC allows this because it says 'includes' not 'consists of.'"

Follow-up: "Isn't that manipulable? Can't we always find some earlier voluntary act?"

Your response: "Exactly. That's Kelman's critique. Courts choose where to start the time frame, and that choice determines the outcome. It's interpretive flexibility disguised as neutral doctrine."

### If professor asks about omissions

Question you might hear: "Should American law recognize a general duty to rescue?"

Answer starter: "Under current law, no general duty - only the five Jones categories. The policy argument against: respects autonomy and avoids compelled altruism. Where would duty end? Must you donate kidneys? Jump in front of cars? The policy argument for: moral duty to help when easy and safe, like many European countries."

Follow-up: "What about the relationship category? How broad is that?"

Your response: "Parent-child is clear. Spouses probably. But courts are cautious about expanding it. Key question: Is there reliance or special vulnerability that justifies legal duty?"

### If professor asks about Kelman

Question you might hear: "What's Kelman's point about interpretive construction?"

Answer starter: "Kelman argues courts manipulate time frames to reach desired results. Defining 'the act' broadly or narrowly determines voluntariness. But there's no neutral principle for choosing the frame - just policy preferences. This shows indeterminacy in legal doctrine."

Follow-up: "Does that mean the voluntary act requirement is meaningless?"

Your response: "Not meaningless, but more flexible than it appears. Courts can usually find SOME voluntary act if they want to convict, or frame narrowly if they want to acquit. The rule doesn't determine outcomes; policy preferences do."

## 60-SECOND RECAP (1 minute)

Alright, if you remember nothing else, remember this:

Criminal liability requires a voluntary act or omission with legal duty. Voluntary means NOT a reflex, unconsciousness, sleep, hypnosis, or non-volitional movement under MPC section two point zero one.

Four cases: Martin - involuntary public appearance, reversed. Newton - unconsciousness defense, must be voluntary at moment of harm. Decina - voluntary act of driving with seizure risk satisfies actus reus even though seizure was involuntary. Jones - omission liability requires legal duty from five categories: statute, relationship, contract, voluntary assumption, creation of peril.

Critical theory payoff: Courts manipulate time frames to define "the act" - Kelman's point. This is interpretive flexibility disguised as neutral doctrine.

On an exam: Always identify the relevant act from the statute, check MPC section two point zero one categories for voluntariness, discuss time-framing if there's an earlier voluntary act and later involuntary act, and walk through Jones duties for omissions.

---

## CLOSING (1 minute)

You're ready for class. When Harcourt cold calls you, start with the doctrine - MPC provisions, case holdings. Then when he pushes, bring in the policy arguments - moral culpability, fair notice, deterrence. And when he asks what's really going on, bring in Kelman - courts are manipulating time frames based on who they want to convict.

This is how Harcourt's class works. Surface level: clean doctrine. One level down: policy trade-offs. Bottom level: critical theory showing the doctrine is more manipulable than it looks.

You've got this. Go get ready for class.
