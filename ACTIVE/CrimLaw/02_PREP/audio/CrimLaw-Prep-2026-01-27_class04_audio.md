# Audio Prep — Class #4 — Intended Killings

## INTRO (2 minutes)

Today is the first homicide class, and it’s really a class about grading intentional killing.

The common law starts with one bucket called “murder,” then jurisdictions create degrees to separate “the worst murders” from everything else. The traditional tool is the premeditation-deliberation formula: “willful, deliberate, and premeditated.”

By the end of this prep, you can do three things on command:
1. State what “premeditation” is supposed to accomplish, and why the doctrine collapses if it’s defined as instantaneous.
2. Explain *Carroll* versus *Guthrie* as two different ways to keep (or destroy) the first/second-degree distinction.
3. Pivot to the MPC and say, cleanly, “the MPC does not do premeditation,” then locate what the MPC uses instead.

Keep one tactical point in mind for Harcourt: he treats time-framing as a lawyer move. He’ll ask for the prosecution story and the defense story, and he’ll insist both are legally plausible in the hard cases.

---

## PART 1: Why Degrees Exist + What “Premeditation” Is (5 minutes)

The historical problem is simple. At common law, murder was murder, and the punishment could be mandatory and extreme. The Pennsylvania reform in 1794 is the classic move: create first-degree murder for a narrower set of killings, then second-degree for everything else.

The structure of that statute is worth having in your head. It lists a few “paradigm” first-degree killings—poison and lying in wait—then adds the general clause: any other “willful, deliberate and premeditated” killing. It also folds in felony murder as another route to first degree.

That design is doing two things at once. It’s picking out a few methods that reliably signal planning, and it’s giving the state a general-purpose doctrinal test for everything that looks planned but doesn’t fit the enumerated buckets.

The core category for first-degree is a “willful, deliberate, and premeditated” killing. Translate that into plain English.

“Willful” means intent to kill. “Premeditated” means the intent was formed before the act. “Deliberate” is supposed to mean the choice was made with some reflection rather than a pure snap reaction.

Those words are supposed to be separate constraints. If “premeditation” just means “intent,” then first degree becomes “any intentional killing,” which defeats the idea of degrees.

There’s also a straight policy critique of premeditation as a sorting device.

Premeditation can punish the wrong axis. A person can “premeditate” in the sense of thinking about killing for a long time and still be less morally terrifying than someone who kills quickly and efficiently. The doctrine can also reward certain kinds of killers: if “reflection time” is what matters, then a cold-blooded execution that happens fast can look less premeditated than a messy killing preceded by anguish.

That critique connects to why the MPC drops premeditation. The MPC moves the grading question to mens rea and mitigation, instead of pretending that time-to-think reliably maps onto culpability.

That is the theory. The practical problem is that “premeditation” is not something you can see directly. You infer it from proxies: did the person plan, did they have a motive, did the manner of killing look like execution rather than chaos.

One classic set of proxies is the Anderson triad: planning activity, motive, and manner. You don’t need the case name to use the structure.

Planning activity means steps that look like setting the killing up: retrieving a weapon, waiting, picking a location, arranging an encounter. Motive means some reason that makes a planned killing story plausible. Manner means the method looks like a preconceived design rather than a flailing fight—an execution-style shot, a targeted strike, a method that requires control.

None of those are perfect. They are inference engines. The prosecution uses them to build a narrative of reflection. The defense uses them to re-label ordinary facts as neutral facts.

Here’s what that looks like in two sentences.

On the prosecution side: “the facts show preparation and control, so the killing reflects a settled choice.” On the defense side: “the same facts are ordinary background and the killing is a single impulsive eruption.”

Run the triad quickly on a weapon-retrieval fact pattern.

Planning: leaving to get the weapon is the decision point. Defense response: leaving is still part of the same rage episode, and the weapon was accessible anyway.

Motive: prior threats or relationship history supports a planned killing story. Defense response: motive is not deliberation; it is a reason courts and juries overread ambiguous acts.

Manner: a calm, execution-style shot supports preconceived design. Defense response: the manner can be a product of chaos, luck, or panic, not reflection.

If Harcourt cold-calls you, he may ask: “which proxy is doing the work here?” Answer by naming one proxy as your best point, then conceding the other side’s best rebuttal.

Tiny hypo to anchor this. D and V argue. D storms out, gets a knife, comes back, and stabs. Is that planning, or is it still a single rage episode. The answer depends on what you treat as “the act” and what you treat as evidence of reflection.

Harcourt will press this as a framing choice. If the “act” is just the stab, that looks impulsive. If the “act” includes leaving the room, getting the knife, returning, and choosing again, that looks reflective.

In other words: premeditation doctrine is a grading doctrine, and grading doctrines invite narrative. The question is how much narrative you allow before “first degree” stops meaning anything.

---

## PART 2: *Commonwealth v. Carroll* — Instant Premeditation (4 minutes)

Start with the key move in *Carroll*. The Pennsylvania court says there is no minimum time requirement. “No time is too short” for premeditation.

Facts in one breath. After hours of arguing, Carroll remembers a loaded pistol near the bed and shoots his wife twice in the back of the head while she is dozing or asleep. The defense leans on psychiatric evidence: rage, panic, and an “impulsive automatic reflex,” not a reflective plan.

The court’s answer is: intent can be inferred from conduct and circumstances, and the shortness of time between forming intent and acting does not defeat premeditation. The interval can be brief and still count.

So the evidentiary center of gravity is intent. If the factfinder believes this was an intentional aiming and firing at a vital area, *Carroll* makes first degree easy.

If the factfinder believes the defendant’s story that the act was not an intentional choice to kill, then the label “premeditated” does not save the prosecution, because premeditation does not exist without intent.

There is also a deeper move hiding in the opinion. The court refuses to let psychiatric labels control the legal category. It insists the factfinder decides intent and responsibility from the evidence, not from a clinician’s bottom line.

So if Harcourt pushes on “why that matters,” your answer is concrete: in a *Carroll* jurisdiction, you don’t win by saying “he was enraged” or “he panicked.” You win by driving doubt about whether he formed the intent to kill, because time and reflection do not do much filtering work.

That also clarifies how to argue second degree in a *Carroll* jurisdiction. You don’t say “there was no time.” You either (1) deny intent, or (2) move to a different grading device like mitigation, depending on the jurisdiction.

So how do you use *Carroll* in class. The prosecution story under *Carroll* is straightforward: he argued for hours, he remembered the gun, he reached for it, he aimed, he fired twice. That is a purposive sequence. Any distinction between “intent” and “premeditation” disappears once you accept that sequence as enough.

The defense story under *Carroll* has to attack intent, not timing. If premeditation can be instantaneous, then the only way out is to say he did not actually form the intent to kill in the legally relevant sense, or that the evidence does not support deliberation as anything other than an emotional spasm.

The pressure point is what’s left of second-degree murder in a *Carroll* world. If every intentional killing can be called “premeditated” because no time is too short, the degrees collapse toward “first degree whenever intent exists.”

Harcourt will probably force that question: if *Carroll* is right, what is the legal work done by “premeditation” at all. Your clean answer is: it does little work in close cases; it shifts power to the factfinder to label intent as “premeditated” without a meaningful constraint.

If you need to defend *Carroll* against the “collapse” critique, the best defense is institutional. The court can say: the statute uses WDP language, and the court is not going to invent a minimum reflection time that is not in the text. The constraint is supposed to come from the factfinder’s inference of intent and from the legislature’s sentencing scheme, not from a judicial stopwatch rule.

That defense is not a full answer to the grading problem, but it is a coherent position: *Carroll* treats premeditation language as reinforcing that intentional killings belong in the highest murder category, and it leaves the mercy/harshness question to sentencing or jury discretion rather than to a doctrinal “time” element.

Tiny hypo to practice. D sees V across the street, pulls a gun, fires instantly. Under *Carroll*, if the factfinder believes intent to kill existed at the trigger pull, the premeditation box is basically checked. Under a reflection regime, you have a real fight.

---

## PART 3: *State v. Guthrie* — Reflection Required (4 minutes)

*Guthrie* is the deliberate attempt to save the degree structure from *Carroll*-style collapse.

Facts in one breath. Guthrie is a dishwasher with serious psychiatric problems, gets teased at work, a coworker snaps him with a dish towel that hits his nose, and Guthrie stabs him in the neck and kills him. The case is not a “planned assassination” fact pattern. It is exactly the kind of “snap” killing that forces a degree choice.

The instruction problem matters. The jury was told that intent to kill need not exist for any particular length of time, and that an intent formed “in an instant” is enough for “willful, deliberate, and premeditated.” Those are the Schrader instructions.

The court’s response is blunt: those instructions effectively equate premeditation with mere intent to kill, and that eliminates the distinction between first- and second-degree murder. That can’t be right if the statute actually means to grade.

So *Guthrie* holds: there must be some period between forming the intent and killing that indicates an opportunity for reflection after the intent is formed. No fixed minimum time, but not “instantaneous.”

This is where line-drawing becomes the doctrine. You are not going to find a clean number of seconds that always works. You argue from structure.

If the sequence contains a point where a reasonable person could say “this is a second decision,” you argue deliberation. Leaving the room to get a weapon is the classic example, but anything that looks like stopping and restarting can play the same role.

If the sequence looks like one continuous emotional eruption, you argue second-degree. Your job is to erase the prosecution’s proposed “decision point” and re-describe it as part of the same episode.

This is where the same fact can cut both ways.

Carrying a knife can be planning, or it can be ordinary work behavior. Walking out of a room can be “cooling off,” or it can be escalation. A pause can be reflection, or it can be a frozen panic moment.

Under *Guthrie*, the fight is over the most plausible description of those facts. The prosecution needs a story that makes “opportunity for reflection” feel real, not abstract. The defense needs a story that makes “continuous eruption” feel like the only honest description.

Use it in class like this. The prosecution story under *Guthrie* is to find reflection. If there is any sequence that looks like second thoughts were possible, you argue deliberation: leaving to get a weapon, waiting, lying in wait, choosing a particular method, or any calmness that suggests control rather than pure impulse.

The defense story under *Guthrie* is to keep the time frame narrow and to argue the action is continuous, emotional, and nonreflective. The defense wants the court to see “intent and act fused,” not “intent then reflection then act.”

The hard part is that *Guthrie* refuses a stopwatch rule. That means you still argue from proxies. The difference is that the proxies matter because the doctrine is trying to preserve the idea of “cold-blooded” versus “impulsive.”

One clean line to have ready if cold-called: first degree is for the deliberate killer; second degree is for the intentional but impulsive killer. That is *Guthrie*’s project.

Tiny hypo to practice. D argues with V, storms into the kitchen, grabs a knife, returns, stabs. Prosecution says the walk is the reflection interval. Defense says it’s still the same rage episode and there was no real opportunity for second thoughts. That is the *Guthrie* fight.

---

## PART 4: MPC §210 — What Replaces Premeditation (5 minutes)

Now pivot to the MPC. The MPC does not grade intentional killing by premeditation. It treats purposeful and knowing killings as murder, full stop.

So what does the MPC do instead. Two moves.

First, it uses the culpability framework you built last class. Under the MPC, homicide is graded by mens rea categories: purposely/knowingly is murder, reckless is usually manslaughter unless it rises to “extreme indifference,” and negligent is negligent homicide.

Second, the MPC builds mitigation directly into the statute. Read the opening of the murder provision: “Except as provided in Section 210.3(1)(b)…” That is the EMED mitigation. A killing that would otherwise be murder can be manslaughter if committed under extreme mental or emotional disturbance with a reasonable explanation or excuse, judged from the actor’s viewpoint.

Two things to say if Harcourt drills on that language.

First: EMED is not “I was upset.” The statute requires an extreme disturbance and then demands an explanation that is reasonable or excusable, even while telling you to evaluate it from the actor’s viewpoint.

Second: this is the MPC’s replacement for the common law’s categorical provocation doctrine. Instead of asking whether the provocation fits a traditional box, the MPC asks whether the emotional disturbance story is the kind of story the law should partially credit.

That sentence is a structural cue. It means: start at murder, then check whether the mitigation gate applies. Harcourt likes that kind of statutory architecture, because it forces you to read the words in order.

That is the MPC’s way to avoid premeditation as a proxy for culpability. Instead of asking “how long did you reflect,” it asks “what was your culpability level, and do we have a mitigation story that the law is willing to recognize.”

This is a major bridge to the next class, heat of passion. Under the common law, provocation doctrine is the mitigation lever. Under the MPC, EMED is broader and more subjective.

Two quick examples to keep straight.

Example one: D aims at V’s head and pulls the trigger. Under the MPC, you say “purposeful killing,” and you’re basically at murder. You do not argue premeditation.

Example two: same killing, but D is in an extreme disturbance and you have facts that make an explanation plausible. Under the MPC, you still start at murder, then you argue EMED to drop to manslaughter.

If you have to argue EMED in class, keep it disciplined.

Defense side: identify the disturbance facts (what makes it “extreme,” not ordinary anger), then connect them to an explanation that the law can treat as reasonable or excusable from the actor’s viewpoint. The actor’s viewpoint means you incorporate the actor’s situation and perception, not that you get a blank check.

Prosecution side: attack either “extreme” or “reasonable.” You can concede that the defendant was upset and still argue the disturbance is not extreme, or argue the explanation is not reasonable or excusable because it looks like revenge, pride, or simple loss of control that the law refuses to credit.

Tiny hypo to practice. D intentionally shoots V after a shocking betrayal. Under the common law degree framework, you fight about premeditation and also about provocation mitigation. Under the MPC, you fight about purpose (easy) and EMED mitigation (harder).

Harcourt’s likely follow-up: does the MPC lose anything by dropping premeditation. The pro-MPC answer is that premeditation is a bad proxy. It can track planning capacity and evidence rather than moral blame. The pro-degree answer is that society wants a special label and special punishment for calculated killings.

## PART 5: Harcourt Moves — Time-Framing + Roles (3 minutes)

Prepare for Harcourt to force you into roles.

If you are the prosecutor: broaden the time frame. Your job is to make the killing look like the endpoint of a sequence of controlled choices. Identify any step where D could have stopped and didn’t.

If you are the defense: narrow the time frame. Your job is to make the killing look like a single continuous eruption, with no meaningful opportunity for second thoughts. Attack the prosecution’s inferences as hindsight story-telling.

In the real edge cases, both stories are plausible. The grading question becomes which story your doctrine allows the factfinder to credit.

One integrated practice fact pattern:

D and V argue for an hour. D says, “I’m going to kill you.” D leaves the room, goes to a drawer, gets a gun, comes back, and shoots V.

Run it two ways, fast.

Common law degrees: under *Carroll*, the timing interval does not matter much once intent is found, so this looks like first-degree. Under *Guthrie*, the exit and return are the key: the prosecution calls that the reflection interval; the defense tries to collapse it into the same rage episode.

MPC: this is purposeful murder under `§ 210.2(1)(a)` unless EMED applies. Premeditation is not part of the analysis. The fight is whether the disturbance story has the kind of explanation the statute calls “reasonable” from the actor’s viewpoint.

Now a harder integrated fact pattern:

D and V argue face-to-face. No one leaves the room. D sees a heavy object on the table, grabs it, and kills V within five seconds.

Under *Carroll*, the prosecution tries to win by proving intent to kill from the manner of attack; timing does not rescue the defense. Under *Guthrie*, the defense presses “no reflection interval,” and the prosecution tries to manufacture one by broad framing: earlier threats, earlier escalation, earlier choices that put D in the killing situation.

Under the MPC, it’s still murder if purpose/knowledge is proved. The defense then needs to decide whether it’s making a mitigation argument (EMED) or a mens rea argument (lack of purpose/knowledge, depending on the facts).

Three micro-drills (answer each in fifteen seconds):

Drill 1: D and V argue, D leaves for thirty seconds, returns and shoots. Under *Carroll*, first-degree once intent is found. Under *Guthrie*, that thirty seconds is either “reflection interval” or “same episode,” depending on your story. Under MPC, murder unless EMED.

Drill 2: D waits in a dark hallway for ten minutes and shoots when V walks in. Under either common-law approach, planning and manner are strong; this is first-degree in most degree jurisdictions. Under MPC, murder under `§ 210.2(1)(a)`.

Drill 3: D has been obsessed with revenge for months, but the killing happens suddenly in a chance encounter. Prosecution: motive plus instant execution supports a planned killing story. Defense: obsession is motive, not reflection at the moment; the encounter is spontaneous; under *Guthrie* the state still must show an opportunity for reflection tied to the killing sequence.

One exam-style habit to practice, because Harcourt rewards it: switch roles without changing your structure.

Write the prosecution version as a tight story of decision points. Then write the defense version as a tight story of continuity and loss of meaningful opportunity for second thoughts. Treat “time frame” as your first move in each paragraph.

Two quick practice prompts.

Prompt one: D keeps a loaded gun for protection. One night, after an argument, D grabs it and shoots. Prosecutor: remembering and reaching is a choice. Defense: the gun’s presence is innocent and the moment is impulsive.

Prompt two: D texts “I’m going to kill you” an hour before, then shows up and kills. Prosecutor: motive and planning. Defense: if you want a defense, it can’t be “no premeditation”; it has to be something else.

## COLD CALL PREP (3 minutes)

If Harcourt asks: “What is premeditation supposed to do?”

**Answer starter:** “It’s the grading device for intentional killings. It’s supposed to reserve first degree for killings that reflect a settled choice rather than a snap decision.”

If Harcourt asks: “State *Carroll* in one sentence.”

**Answer starter:** “*Carroll* holds there’s no minimum time for premeditation—no time is too short—so if the factfinder finds intent to kill, the timing interval does not defeat first degree.”

If Harcourt asks: “State *Guthrie* in one sentence.”

**Answer starter:** “*Guthrie* rejects ‘instant premeditation’ because it collapses degrees; it requires some period showing opportunity for reflection between intent and killing.”

If Harcourt asks: “How does the MPC handle intended killings?”

**Answer starter:** “The MPC doesn’t ask about premeditation. Purposeful or knowing killing is murder under §210.2, subject to mitigation to manslaughter for EMED under §210.3(1)(b).”

If Harcourt pushes: “Time-framing—what’s the move?”

**Answer starter:** “Narrow frame makes the act look impulsive. Broad frame includes the prior choices that set up the killing and makes it look deliberate. Both frames are legally usable, and the doctrine decides how much weight each can carry.”

If Harcourt asks: “What’s left of second-degree murder under *Carroll*?”

**Answer starter:** “Not much for intentional killings. If premeditation can be instantaneous, the main way to avoid first degree is to undermine intent or move into a different malice category rather than rely on timing.”

If Harcourt asks: “Under *Guthrie*, what facts are you hunting for?”

**Answer starter:** “Any decision point that supports opportunity for reflection—leaving to get a weapon, waiting, choosing a method, or anything that looks like stopping and restarting rather than one continuous eruption.”

If Harcourt asks: “Define ‘willful, deliberate, and premeditated’ without handwaving.”

**Answer starter:** “Willful is intent to kill. Premeditated means intent formed before the act. Deliberate means the decision reflects some opportunity for reflection rather than pure impulse. The dispute is whether that opportunity can be instantaneous.”

If Harcourt asks: “What’s your evidence structure for proving deliberation?”

**Answer starter:** “I organize the facts into planning activity, motive, and manner, then argue why those facts support reflection rather than a continuous eruption.”

If Harcourt asks: “What’s the best critique of *Guthrie*?”

**Answer starter:** “It preserves the degree distinction, but it does it through a vague ‘some period’ requirement that can invite story-telling from ambiguous facts. The constraint has to come from demanding concrete evidence of a decision point, not just moral labeling.”

If Harcourt asks: “What policy argument supports *Guthrie* over *Carroll*?”

**Answer starter:** “If degrees mean anything, first degree needs to track a more settled, reflective choice; otherwise the legal system loses its grading vocabulary and everything becomes first degree whenever intent is found.”

If Harcourt asks: “Why would the MPC reject premeditation?”

**Answer starter:** “Premeditation is a noisy proxy for culpability. The MPC grades by culpability levels and then uses mitigation directly, instead of pretending time-to-think cleanly separates the worst from the rest.”

## 60‑SECOND RECAP (1 minute)

> If you remember nothing else, remember this:
>
> 1. Premeditation is a grading device for intentional killings in degree jurisdictions.
> 2. *Carroll* allows instant premeditation, pushing the fight into whether intent existed at all.
> 3. *Guthrie* requires some reflection interval to preserve the first/second-degree distinction.
> 4. The MPC rejects premeditation; it grades by mens rea and uses mitigation (EMED) instead.
> 5. Harcourt will force prosecutor/defense narratives through time-framing.

---

## CLOSING (1 minute)

Next class is heat of passion and provocation. That’s the mitigation lever that interacts with premeditation fights in common-law jurisdictions, and it maps onto the MPC’s EMED mitigation.

Go into class ready to say, out loud, what fact you treat as the “reflection interval,” and why your framing is grounded in evidence rather than character judgment.
