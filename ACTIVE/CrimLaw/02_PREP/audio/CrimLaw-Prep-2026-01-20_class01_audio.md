## INTRO (2 minutes)

Hi. You're about to walk into Professor Harcourt's Criminal Law class, and I want to give you straight talk about what you're stepping into.

This isn't just a class about doctrine—it's an ideological arena. Harcourt is a Foucaultian critical legal studies scholar. He spent his career arguing that the criminal justice system isn't broken—it's working exactly as designed: to dominate and control. He wants to dismantle your "common sense" intuitions about law, justice, and punishment.

**Important clarification**: Harcourt does NOT think individual judges, prosecutors, or police are intentionally evil or racist. His critique is structural, not conspiratorial. The system produces racist outcomes and oppressive results regardless of individual intentions. Well-meaning people participating in the system still reproduce domination because the system itself is designed to dominate. The problem isn't "bad apples"—it's that the entire orchard produces poisonous fruit.

Today's class sets up that project. You're reading Bryan Stevenson's Just Mercy to have your emotions activated, then discussing mass incarceration to see the system's scale, then defining "justice" so Harcourt can return to your definition all semester and show you how naive it is.

And here's the thing: Harcourt's critique has real force. The system IS racist. It DOES produce horrific injustices like Walter McMillian. Mass incarceration IS a moral catastrophe.

But you're not crazy if you also think: wait, aren't prisons and police necessary? Don't we need some form of punishment? You're stepping into a 50-year intellectual war between Foucaultians and their critics. This audio prep will give you the intellectual ammunition to participate.

By the end, you'll have: (1) a sophisticated definition of justice that can withstand Harcourt's critique, (2) the Walter McMillian case cold, (3) a clear-eyed view of Stevenson's "just mercy" including its limitations, (4) the criminal justice process stages, and (5) the punishment theory framework that structures everything.

Let's go.

## PART 1: JUST MERCY AND THE WALTER MCMILLIAN CASE (8 minutes)

### The Story of Walter McMillian

Walter McMillian was a Black businessman in Monroeville, Alabama—the same town where To Kill a Mockingbird is set. In November 1986, Ronda Morrison, an 18-year-old white woman, was murdered at the dry cleaners where she worked. The investigation went nowhere for months.

Then police arrested Ralph Myers for a different murder. While in custody, Myers claimed McMillian killed Morrison. When police brought them face-to-face, Myers couldn't even identify him. That was their "witness."

So why target McMillian? He'd had an affair with a white woman. In 1980s Alabama, a Black man with a white woman— that made him a target. Sheriff Tate, under political pressure to solve a high-profile white victim's murder, decided McMillian was their guy.

Now here's where it becomes unconscionable: **before McMillian even had a trial, Sheriff Tate placed him on death row.** Death row BEFORE trial, BEFORE conviction. This had never happened before. The sheriff did it to psychologically torture McMillian and break Myers, forcing him to keep accusing McMillian. McMillian spent 18 months on death row without being convicted of anything.

At trial, the prosecution's case was garbage. Dozens of witnesses—including a police officer with a written logbook entry—confirmed McMillian was at a fish fry at his house during the murder. Solid alibi. The prosecution ignored it.

They presented a jailhouse snitch, Bill Hooks, who claimed he saw McMillian's truck at the crime scene. Hooks was promised release and reward money. Also, McMillian's truck wasn't even converted to a low-rider until months AFTER the murder. The evidence was completely manufactured.

The jury took three hours to convict and recommended life in prison. Judge Robert E. Lee Key overrode the jury and sentenced McMillian to death. Why? Because judges who look "tough on crime" get reelected in Alabama.

Bryan Stevenson took up the case. Eventually, Myers confessed he'd lied. Hooks admitted he was paid. The Alabama Bureau of Investigation reviewed the case and concluded: "There is no way Walter McMillian killed Ronda Morrison." After six years on death row, McMillian was exonerated in March 1993.

But there's no happy ending. McMillian struggled to reintegrate. Many in Monroeville still believed he was guilty. He received minimal compensation. He developed dementia and died in 2013, still traumatized.

### What This Case Shows—And What It Doesn't

Harcourt wants you to see system failure at every stage. And he's right: McMillian had constitutional rights on paper that were ignored because he was poor, Black, and politically powerless.

When Harcourt asks what upset you most, the pre-trial death row detention is the strongest answer. It wasn't just procedurally irregular—it was psychological torture designed to manufacture a conviction. This wasn't a mistake; it was deliberate cruelty.

But here's what Harcourt won't emphasize: the McMillian case proves that the system, when it actually functions, can correct injustice. Stevenson didn't burn down the system—he used appeals courts, the media, and the legal process to exonerate McMillian. The fact that this took six years and required a 60 Minutes segment is shameful. But the system eventually worked.

This distinction matters. Harcourt will argue the system is inherently oppressive. A better response is: the system contains tools for accountability, but those tools are only accessible to people with resources. The problem isn't criminal law itself—it's unequal access to justice.

## PART 2: STEVENSON'S "JUST MERCY"—AND ITS LIMITS (6 minutes)

### What Stevenson Is Arguing

Stevenson's phrase "just mercy" operates on two levels. First, "just" means "simply"—mercy without conditions. But second, "just" connects to justice. Stevenson argues mercy is not opposed to justice but essential to it. A system without mercy becomes pure retribution, and retribution without limit is vengeance.

His core insight: "We are all broken by something. We are all more than the worst thing we've ever done." A criminal justice system that refuses to recognize our shared humanity and capacity for redemption is inherently unjust.

This is morally powerful. When you read about children sentenced to life without parole, or mentally ill people executed, or juveniles raped in adult prisons, Stevenson's demand for mercy feels like the only humane response.

### The Problem: Stevenson Conflates Innocence with Mitigation

Here's the critique Harcourt won't give you: Stevenson mixes entirely different types of cases.

Walter McMillian was **innocent**. That's a system failure requiring exoneration. Herbert Richardson, the traumatized Vietnam vet who built a bomb that killed his ex-girlfriend's niece, was **guilty**. He actually did it. His case involves mitigation—trauma, mental illness, lack of intent—which argues for lesser punishment, not for no punishment.

By weaving these cases together, Stevenson makes a powerful emotional appeal but obscures the harder policy questions. What should we do with guilty people who have terrible circumstances? How much do poverty, abuse, and mental illness reduce culpability? Where's the line?

Stevenson is devastating on what's wrong—mass incarceration, racial bias, excessive punishment. He's vague on what's right. If we abolish the death penalty and life without parole for juveniles, then what? What's the alternative punishment framework? Stevenson doesn't tell us.

### The Real Tension: Mercy vs. Accountability

The deeper problem is that Stevenson never grapples with the tension between mercy and accountability. If everyone is "broken," if everyone deserves mercy, what does justice for victims look like? How do we deter crime? When is punishment ever justified?

Stevenson wants mercy to be part of justice. But justice also requires holding people accountable for their choices. A system that shows mercy to guilty people without accountability abandons victims. A system that shows accountability without mercy creates the mass incarceration nightmare Stevenson documents.

The right answer is proportional punishment that accounts for both culpability and circumstance, with mercy embedded in recognition of human fallibility. But that's a boring middle position that doesn't make for powerful storytelling.

For class, you can appreciate Stevenson's moral witness while recognizing the limitations of his framework. Be ready to point out that innocence and mitigation are different, and that "just mercy" doesn't answer the hard questions about what guilty people deserve.

---

## PART 3: DEFINING JUSTICE—THE POSITION YOU SHOULD TAKE (4 minutes)

### My Definition (Steal This)

Here's the definition of justice I'm using, and you should too:

**"Justice is a system that holds people accountable for their choices while recognizing that those choices are shaped by circumstances, with punishment proportional to both culpability and harm, and mercy embedded in recognition of our shared imperfection."**

Why this definition?

First, it avoids the trap that Harcourt will set for retributivists. If you say "justice is giving people what they deserve," he'll spend the semester showing you that "desert" is socially constructed, racialized, and manipulable. He's right that desert is messy—but that doesn't mean we can't aim for proportionality.

Second, it avoids the utilitarian trap. If you say "justice is minimizing harm and maximizing rehabilitation," he'll show you how "rehabilitation" became a euphemism for social control. He's right that rehabilitation programs can be coercive—but that doesn't mean rehabilitation isn't a legitimate goal.

Third, and most importantly, this definition makes room for what Stevenson demands—mercy—while retaining what criminal law must provide—accountability. It acknowledges individual choice without denying structural context.

### Why Harcourt Will Hate This Definition

Harcourt will push you from two directions.

From the Foucaultian left, he'll argue that "proportionality" is a myth—there's no neutral way to measure what punishment is "proportional" to what harm. All punishment is an exercise of power, not the calibration of justice.

From the critical legal studies perspective, he'll argue that "individual choice" is a lie—we're all shaped by structures beyond our control, so holding people "accountable for their choices" just blames the poor for poverty.

From the abolitionist perspective, he'll argue that "mercy" shouldn't be "embedded" in a punishing system—the system itself is the problem.

### How to Defend It

When Harcourt pushes, you say:

"You're right that proportionality is imperfect and that structures shape choices. But the alternative—that there's no meaningful difference between more and less culpable behavior, or that punishment is just pure power—denies moral reality. Some actions ARE worse than others. People DO make choices within constraints. A system that can't distinguish between a murderer and someone who made a honest mistake has abandoned justice entirely."

Then you pivot: "The question isn't whether we can achieve perfect justice. It's whether we can build a system that's less unjust than the alternative. What would you replace criminal law with?"

That second move is crucial. Harcourt will critique the existing system. Your job is to demand he articulate an alternative.

## PART 4: THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROCESS—AND THE PARADOX (6 minutes)

### Mass Incarceration by the Numbers

The statistics are brutal. 2.2 million people incarcerated in the US. Another 6.9 million under correctional supervision. That's 1 in 31 adults with a criminal record.

But the racial disparity is what should alarm you: African Americans are 13.4% of the population but 33% of the incarcerated. Black adults are 5.9 times more likely to be incarcerated than white adults. 1 in 3 Black men born today can expect to go to prison at some point, compared to 6% of white men.

Why did this happen? Not because crime exploded—crime actually fell through the 1990s and 2000s while incarceration kept rising. This was policy choices: three strikes laws, mandatory minimums, eliminating parole, trying children as adults, the war on drugs targeting Black communities.

### The Overenforcement/Underenforcement Paradox

Here's the tension Harcourt will explore, and it's real: How can communities be simultaneously over-policed and under-policed?

**Overenforcement**: Mass incarceration, excessive sentences, racial disparities in arrest and prosecution. Black communities are swarmed by police for minor offenses.

**Underenforcement**: Failure to protect vulnerable communities from crime. Domestic violence and sexual assault often not seriously investigated. Inner-city homicides receive fewer investigative resources. Police violence goes unpunished. Financial crimes by the wealthy rarely prosecuted.

Both are symptoms of the same problem: the system's non-responsiveness to the needs of the poor, racial minorities, and the politically vulnerable.

Alexandra Natapoff's argument is that overenforcement and underenforcement are two sides of the same coin. The state doesn't care about poor communities—it harasses them with overpolicing while failing to protect them from serious harm. The police are there, but they're not serving the community's actual safety needs.

### The Harcourtian Trap—and the Way Out

Here's where Harcourt will make his Foucaultian move: He'll argue that the solution to underenforcement can NEVER be more policing, because policing itself is the problem. The criminal justice system is inherently oppressive, so expanding it to protect vulnerable communities just expands oppression.

He's pointing at a real dilemma. If you say "we need to take domestic violence more seriously," he'll respond "but that means more policing, more prosecutions, more incarceration." If you say "we need to hold police accountable," he'll respond "but that just expands the carceral system."

The way out is to reject the binary. We can have accountability without mass incarceration. We can take violence seriously without excessive punishment. We can protect vulnerable communities without harassment. The problem isn't criminal law itself—it's how we've designed it.

But Harcourt won't accept that answer. He'll argue the system is irredeemable. That's the abolitionist position, and it's where he's heading.

### The Basic Process Stages

You need to know these cold because Harcourt will reference them:

1. **Investigation**: Police gather evidence
2. **Arrest**: Formal custody (requires probable cause)
3. **Initial appearance**: Within 24-48 hours; charges read; bail set
4. **Grand jury** or preliminary hearing: Determines probable cause; issues indictment
5. **Arraignment**: Defendant enters plea (guilty, not guilty, no contest)
6. **Pre-trial motions**: Suppress evidence, dismiss charges, change venue
7. **Plea bargaining**: ~95% of cases resolve here—no trial
8. **Trial**: Jury or bench trial; prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt
9. **Sentencing**: Judge imposes punishment
10. **Appeal**: Defendant can appeal legal errors, not factual findings
11. **Post-conviction relief**: Habeas corpus, clemency, pardon

McMillian's case is useful for showing how each stage can fail: investigation was corrupt, arrest was on fabricated charges, pre-trial detention was on death row (unprecedented), grand jury only heard prosecution evidence, trial ignored alibi witnesses, sentencing was a jury override, appeals took years and required media exposure.

## PART 5: PUNISHMENT THEORIES—AND WHY IT MATTERS (3 minutes)

### Retribution vs. Utilitarianism

There are two main punishment theory families, and this tension structures everything you'll learn this semester.

**Retributive theories are backward-looking.** Punishment is justified because people deserve it. It's about moral blameworthiness for past behavior. "Just deserts"—punishment proportional to culpability. It's NOT about consequences like deterrence or prevention, but about justice and fairness.

**Utilitarian or consequentialist theories are forward-looking.** Punishment is justified by the useful purposes it serves: deterrence (general and specific), incapacitation (removing dangerous people), and rehabilitation (reforming offenders).

The key tension: Retribution asks "What does this person deserve based on what they did?" Utilitarianism asks "What punishment will produce the best consequences going forward?"

### Regina v. Dudley & Stephens

The classic example: sailors stranded at sea, starving, kill and eat the cabin boy to survive, rescued four days later.

**Utilitarian argument**: Punishing them serves no purpose. They're not dangerous to anyone. They won't do it again. Executing them is wasteful. Let them go.

**Retributive argument**: They deliberately killed an innocent boy. Murder is murder. The law must uphold the principle that you cannot kill an innocent to save yourself, regardless of circumstances. If we make an exception here, where does it end?

The court held them guilty of punishable murder (later commuted). They used retributive reasoning: "To preserve one's life is generally speaking a duty, but it may be the plainest and the highest duty to sacrifice it."

### How This Connects to Harcourt's Project

Harcourt will argue throughout the semester that BOTH theories are masks for power.

Retributivism claims to be about "desert," but "desert" is socially constructed. What we think people "deserve" reflects racial biases, class prejudices, and political calculations. The death penalty isn't about what murderers deserve—it's about prosecutors looking "tough on crime."

Utilitarianism claims to be about "consequences," but those consequences are measured by the people in power. Deterrence studies are contested. Incapacitation assumes we can accurately predict who's dangerous. Rehabilitation programs become tools for social control.

From a Foucaultian perspective, punishment has always been about domination—from the public executions of the 18th century to the prisons of today. The theories are just rationalizations.

### The Third Purpose: Preventing Vigilantism and Mob Rule

Here's what I missed and it's crucial: **Criminal law exists to maintain the state's monopoly on violence and prevent vigilantism.**

Think about it. If victims don't trust that the system will deter crime through policing, they'll arm themselves to protect their own safety—and millions already do. If victims don't trust that the system will deliver retribution against people who hurt them, they'll take the law into their own hands.

Without criminal law, we get the world of Hobbes: a war of all against all, where everyone is armed and everyone takes revenge privately.

This matters for TWO groups:

**First, it protects innocent people from mob rule.** When people lose faith in the system, they take matters into their own hands. We saw this during the Black Lives Matter protests—thousands of people broke into and looted department stores in NYC because they felt "the system" wasn't fair. That's what happens when the state's monopoly on violence breaks down.

**Second, and this is crucial—it protects CRIMINALS from the mob.** Mobs don't care about due process. Mobs don't read you your Miranda rights. Mobs don't appoint defense attorneys. Mobs don't require proof beyond reasonable doubt. Mobs just punish.

Criminal law protects defendants FROM the victims. It says: "No, you can't personally punish this person. The state will do it, and the state will follow procedures that protect the defendant's rights."

This is the paradox Harcourt won't grapple with: **The same system that perpetrates mass incarceration ALSO protects people from something worse—uncontrolled private violence.**

### Why You Should Still Care

Here's the thing: Harcourt's critique is powerful, but it can't be the end of the conversation. At some point, we have to make decisions about how to respond to crime. We have to choose between more or less punishment, between different types of punishment, between different procedures.

Retribution, utilitarianism, and preventing vigilantism—despite their limitations—give us a framework for having those conversations. They help us ask: Is this punishment proportional to the wrongdoing? Will it actually make things better or worse? Will victims take justice into their own hands if we don't act?

Don't let Harcourt convince you that all frameworks are equally corrupt. Some really are better than others. And the alternative to imperfect state punishment is worse—privately administered violence with no due process whatsoever.

## PART 6: THE INTELLECTUAL WAR YOU'RE ENTERING (4 minutes)

### Where Harcourt Is Coming From

You need to understand the intellectual lineage because it explains where Harcourt is taking you.

**1975—Michel Foucault, Discipline and Punish**: Foucault drops the bomb. He attacks the old Hobbesian view that the state exists to protect us from chaos. Instead, he argues that prisons, schools, hospitals—these are factories for domination. They create "docile bodies" for capitalism. The "humanitarian" reformers who replaced torture with imprisonment weren't being nicer—they just found more efficient ways to control people. This becomes the bible for academic leftists.

**1971—Chomsky vs. Foucault**: In a televised debate, Chomsky (massive leftist) tries to argue that we fight injustice because... it's unjust. Foucault laughs. He says "justice" is a fake concept invented by winners. There's no moral floor—only power. This was the first warning sign: Foucault's philosophy has no room for actual moral judgment, only critique of other people's moral judgments.

**1980s—Jürgen Habermas**: The Frankfurt School giant calls Foucault out on "crypto-normativity." You can't write 300 pages complaining about how evil prisons are while claiming there's no such thing as evil. You're relying on our moral intuition to sell a theory that destroys morality. It's a devastating critique.

**1982—Broken Windows (Wilson & Kelling)**: While professors read Foucault, American cities became dangerous. Wilson and Kelling argue the opposite: disorder doesn't make people free; it makes them terrified. We need more policing of small things (broken windows, turnstile jumping) to restore order. This philosophy took over policing in the Giuliani era. It worked to lower crime, but Foucaultians like Harcourt hated it because it expanded the carceral state.

**2011—Steven Pinker**: Pinker brings data to a philosophy fight. Foucault says "humanitarianism" is a lie and we just found new ways to control people. Pinker shows the charts: murder is down, torture is banned, rights are up. The institutions Foucault hates actually made us the safest humans in history.

**2018—Jordan Peterson**: Direct response to the postmodernist takeover of universities. Peterson argues that hierarchies are natural and necessary, not just power games. When a teacher grades a student, it's not oppression—it's standards. If you dismantle all standards because they're "power structures," bridges fall down and surgeons kill patients.

**Present Day—Bernard Harcourt**: Harcourt looks at all these counterarguments and says no, Foucault was right. He argues that Broken Windows created a racist mass incarceration disaster. He wants to return to the radical critique: police and prisons cannot be reformed; they must be abolished.

### Why You're Not Crazy

If you're sitting there thinking, "but don't we need SOME form of criminal law?"—you're not crazy. You're stepping into a conversation that's been active for 50 years, and Harcourt is on the radical end.

The key is to understand his position without being intimidated by it. Yes, the system has horrific injustices. Yes, mass incarceration is a moral catastrophe. Yes, racial bias is real. But it doesn't follow that the entire project of criminal law is illegitimate.

Your job this semester is to learn the doctrine while keeping the critical questions in view. Can we have criminal law without mass incarceration? Can we have accountability without oppression? Can we have punishment that's proportional rather than excessive?

These are hard questions. Harcourt will push you toward one answer. You don't have to accept it.

## COLD CALL PREP (2 minutes)

### If Harcourt Asks About Justice

**Question**: "Define justice in one sentence."

**Your answer**: Use the definition I gave you. Say it clearly and confidently.

**His follow-up**: "But isn't 'proportionality' just a social construct? How do you measure it?"

**Your response**: "Proportionality is imperfect, but some distinctions are real. A murderer is more culpable than a pickpocket. A person who kills intentionally is more culpable than someone who kills by accident. The alternative—that we can't make these distinctions—denies moral reality entirely."

### If Harcourt Asks About Just Mercy

**Question**: "What upset you most in Just Mercy?"

**Your answer**: "The pre-trial death row detention. Sheriff Tate didn't make a mistake; he used the death penalty as psychological torture to manufacture a conviction. That wasn't a system failure—it was the system working as a weapon against a powerless Black man."

**His follow-up**: "So the system worked when it exonerated him, right?"

**Your response**: "After six years, a 60 Minutes segment, and Stevenson's free labor. The system contains tools for accountability, but those tools are only accessible to people with resources. McMillian's exoneration proves the system CAN work, not that it DOES work."

**Question**: "What's 'just mercy'?"

**Your answer**: Give Stevenson's definition, then add: "But Stevenson conflates innocence with mitigation. McMillian was innocent—he deserved exoneration. Herbert Richardson was guilty but mentally ill—he deserved lesser punishment. These require different responses. Mercy is essential to justice, but so is accountability."

### If Harcourt Asks About the Criminal Justice Process

**Question**: "Walk me through the process."

**Your answer**: List the stages: investigation, arrest, initial appearance, grand jury, arraignment, pre-trial motions, plea bargaining, trial, sentencing, appeal, post-conviction relief.

**His follow-up**: "And where did it fail for McMillian?"

**Your response**: "Everywhere. Investigation was corrupt. Arrest was on fabricated charges. Pre-trial detention was unprecedented death row. Grand jury only heard prosecution evidence. Trial ignored alibi witnesses. Sentencing was a jury override. Appeals took years and required media exposure. The case proves that rights on paper mean nothing without enforcement."

### If Harcourt Asks About Punishment Theories

**Question**: "Why do we punish?"

**Your answer**: "Three main purposes. Retributive: people deserve punishment proportional to their culpability—backward-looking. Utilitarian: punishment serves useful purposes like deterrence, incapacitation, rehabilitation—forward-looking. And third—criminal law maintains the state's monopoly on violence. Without criminal law, victims would arm themselves for protection and take revenge privately. We'd have vigilantism and mob rule. Criminal law protects innocent people from mob rule AND protects defendants from the mob—mobs don't care about due process."

**His follow-up**: "And which are you?"

**Your response**: "I'm skeptical of all three as complete justifications. Deserts are socially constructed and racialized. Consequences are hard to predict and measure. But I think we need some framework for choosing between more and less punishment, more and less culpability. These theories, despite their limits, give us that framework."

---

## CLOSING: WHAT THIS CLASS SETS UP (1 minute)

This first class frames the entire semester. You're going to learn technical doctrines—actus reus, mens rea, homicide, defenses. But Harcourt wants you to see that law can be "correctly" applied and still produce horrific injustice.

The questions today will return: When does following the law produce injustice? Should punishment be about desert or consequences? How much should criminal law account for structural disadvantage? Is law neutral or just power disguised as rules?

Your definition of justice will evolve. That's the point. But don't let Harcourt intimidate you into thinking there are no better or worse answers. There are. The fact that justice is imperfect doesn't mean all systems are equally unjust.

Come to class curious, ready to participate, and willing to challenge Harcourt from the left AND the right. You're not here to absorb his worldview—you're here to test your own.

Good luck.
