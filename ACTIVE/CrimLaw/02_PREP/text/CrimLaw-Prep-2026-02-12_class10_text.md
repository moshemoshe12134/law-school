## 2. FOUCAULT'S OPENING CONTRAST (pp. 3-16)

### Scene 1: Public Execution of Damiens (March 2, 1757)

**The Sentence:**
- Robert-François Damiens attempted to assassinate King Louis XV (regicide)
- Condemned to make public penance before Church of Paris, then taken to Place de Grève
- Torture sequence: flesh torn with red-hot pincers, right hand (holding knife) burnt with sulphur, molten lead/boiling oil/burning resin poured into wounds, body drawn and quartered by horses, remains burned to ashes

**The Reality (from eyewitness Bouton):**
- Execution became extended spectacle lasting hours
- Horses failed to quarter body; initially 4 horses, then 6, still unsuccessful
- Executioners forced to cut sinews and hack at joints
- Damiens remained conscious throughout, crying "My God, have pity on me! Jesus, help me!"
- Even after limbs torn off, trunk still showed signs of life when thrown on stake
- Body took four hours to burn completely; last ember burning at 10:30 PM
- Crowds watched; confessors consoled condemned man; officials supervised every detail

**Key Features:**
- **Public spectacle** - elaborate theater of state power
- **Body as target** - physical pain, torture, dismemberment, destruction
- **Ceremonial excess** - ritual must display sovereign's power through criminal's body
- **Extended duration** - "slow death" multiplied by calculated interruptions

### Scene 2: Prison Timetable (Eighty Years Later, 1830s-40s)

**Leon Faucher's Rules for House of Young Prisoners in Paris:**
- Minute-by-minute schedule from 5-6 AM rising to 7:30-8:30 PM lights out
- Drum-rolls signal each activity transition
- Activities: work (9 hours), instruction (2 hours), meals, chapel, recreation
- Constant supervision: supervisors open cells, lead to chapel, watch in courtyards, inspect clothing, ensure silence
- Evening ritual: reading of "instructive or uplifting work," prayer, inspection, bed

**Key Features:**
- **Invisible power** - no spectacle, routine bureaucracy
- **Time as target** - not body's pain but body's time, organized in precise units
- **Disciplinary technique** - schedules, surveillance, normalization
- **Continuous control** - every moment accounted for and directed

### Foucault's Question:

> "We have, then, a public execution and a time-table. They do not punish the same crimes or the same type of delinquent. But they each define a certain penal style. Less than a century separates them."

**What changed?** Not just "humanization" or "progress" — something fundamental about the **object, mechanisms, and function** of punishment.

## 2.5 NEW INSIGHTS FROM HARCOURT'S 2025 READER'S COMPANION

Harcourt's 2025 essay draws on three major new archival sources that transform our understanding of *Discipline and Punish*:

### The Three New Archives:

1. **Collège de France Lectures (1970-1973)** — Foucault's thirteen years of lectures, especially those immediately preceding the book
2. **Bibliothèque nationale de France Manuscripts (2014 deposit)** — 40,000+ pages of notes, drafts, journals
3. **G.I.P. Archives** — Documents from Foucault's prison activism with the Prisons Information Group

### Key Reinterpretation #1: Not a History of Prisons

**The scholarly controversy:** Recent historians (Abolafia 2024; Larsen & Letteney 2025) argue prisons existed in ancient Rome and Greece — Foucault "got it wrong" by dating imprisonment to the modern period.

**Harcourt's response (from the archives):**
- Foucault was never writing a "history of the prison"
- He was writing a **genealogy of a new mode of governing** — using the prison as a case study
- The early draft manuscript shows Foucault called panopticism a "tribute to Bentham" — a **metaphor** for generalized discipline, not literal architectural plans
- As Foucault wrote: "If we call 'disciplinary' the mechanisms of spatial distribution... then let us pay tribute to Bentham and call 'panoptic' a society where power is exercised through generalized discipline"

> "Discipline and Punish was never intended to be a 'history' of the prison. That indeed would have entailed cataloguing the prior carceral institutions, from the debtors' prisons and the infamous Rasphuis in Amsterdam, to Medieval dungeons and their Greek and Roman antecedents. Foucault was doing something else: not a history of the prison, but a genealogy which sought to unearth the new way in which power circulated in modern society." (Harcourt 2025)

### Key Reinterpretation #2: The "Power of Truth" Framework

From the Collège de France lectures, we now understand Foucault's project differently:

**Three stages of Foucault's research (1972-1975):**
1. **1972:** Analysis of the Nu Pieds rebellion — emergence of repressive power through state judicial apparatus
2. **1973:** Conceptualization of "punitive society" — disciplinary techniques producing docile individuals
3. **1975:** Elaboration of the "panoptic" device — formalization of power itself

**The real question at the center of the book:** Not "why did the prison emerge?" but "how does modern society produce truth about subjects through legal forms?"

- The book is a **case study of the production of legal and scientific truth** about the modern subject
- Foucault traced how the "examination" becomes a new juridical form that extracts surplus-knowledge
- This produces the "human sciences" (criminology, psychology, psychiatry) as effects of power

### Key Reinterpretation #3: Against Hobbes, Not Just Prisons

From Foucault's notebooks (BnF, box XCII), we find his explicit break with modern political theory:

**Hobbes's model:** War of all against all → social contract → peace, war expelled from the Commonwealth

**Foucault's counter-model (Dec 24, 1972 notebook):**
> "At the center, place the most reviled of wars: civil war. This is not war pure and simple... It is not the struggle of all against all; it is the struggle of some against some... Civil war takes place everywhere."

- **Politics as continuation of civil war** — not the other way around (contra Clausewitz)
- Power relations must be described through "permanent struggle, a silent but continuous war"
- This explains the closing reference to the "roar of battle" in *Discipline and Punish*

### Key Reinterpretation #4: Prison Reform as Prison's "Program"

From the G.I.P. archives, we understand Foucault's activism as directly connected to his theory:

**Foucault's experience at Attica (April 1972):**
- Described as "overwhelming" — shifted him from "repression" to analyzing "positive functions" of penality
- New question: "What role does capitalist society's penal system play? What aim is sought? What effects are produced?"

**The reform paradox:**
> "Prison 'reform' is virtually contemporary with the prison itself: it constitutes, as it were, its programme." (DP 234)

- Reform doesn't fix prisons — it **enables their continued existence**
- This is Angela Davis's point in *Are Prisons Obsolete?* — reform and prison have always been linked
- Harcourt: "Reforming the prison means breathing new life into the institution"

### Key Reinterpretation #5: Beyond Discipline — Looking Forward

**Disciplinary power isn't sufficient for today:**
- We live in an age of "warehousing, zero tolerance, algorithmic surveillance, and the rise of the global far-Right"
- The digital age involves an "expository society" where power circulates through desire and lust, not just internalized discipline

**What Foucault offers today:**
- Not a specific model of power (discipline/panopticism) that fits every era
- A **method** for analyzing power relations, knowledge-power, and forms of governmentality
- Tools to "find ways to resist new forms of inhumanity and to articulate new paradigms of cooperation"

**The political stakes (Harcourt's conclusion):**
> "What are the political implications of a narrative of continuity at the present moment? ... All historical scholarship—and genealogical work as well—is always a matter of continuities and differences. What work does it do to stress the continuities today?"

- Stressing continuity with ancient prisons undermines the radical break that abolition demands
- We have overcome other historical inhuman practices (slavery, interrogational torture) — not just reformed them
- "This is no time for backsliding on the prison... It is especially important to look forward, not backwards and strive for a new episteme."

## 3. THE TRANSFORMATION OF PUNISHMENT (pp. 7-16)

### What Disappeared:

**1. The Public Spectacle**
- Torture abolished (France 1789-1791-1830; England 1834-37)
- Pillory abolished (France 1789; England 1837)
- Public chain gangs abolished (early 1800s)
- Public exhibitions of prisoners ceased (France 1848)
- Execution became hidden: closed carriages, prison walls, secret witnesses
- "Ugly to be punishable, but there is no glory in punishing"

**2. The Body as Direct Target**
- No more torture as "art of unbearable sensations"
- Punishment becomes "economy of suspended rights"
- Physical pain no longer "constituent element of the penalty"
- Law reaches body "at a distance, in the proper way, according to strict rules"

**3. The Ceremony of Punishment**
- Shift from spectacle to bureaucracy
- Justice "ashamed" of its own violence
- Punishment delegated to "autonomous sector" (prisons, administrators)
- Double system of protection between justice and penalty

### What Appeared:

**1. New Objects of Judgment**
- Not just crime, but "soul" of criminal
- "Passions, instincts, anomalies, infirmities, maladjustments, effects of environment or heredity"
- Psychiatric expertise, criminal anthropology, criminology
- Assessment of dangerousness, treatability, future behavior

**2. New Techniques of Control**
- Imprisonment, forced labor, prohibition from entering areas
- "Security measures" beyond formal sentence
- Surveillance, normalization, rehabilitation
- Time-tables, architectural designs, supervision systems

**3. New Justifications**
- From expiation to correction: "A technique of improvement"
- Penalty aims to make offender "capable of living within the law"
- Judges claim not to punish but to "correct, reclaim, 'cure'"
- Proliferation of "technicians": warders, doctors, chaplains, psychiatrists, psychologists, educators

### The Persistence of "Torture":

**Foucault's caveat:**
- Physical pain did NOT entirely disappear
- Imprisonment "has always involved a certain degree of physical pain"
- Rationing of food, sexual deprivation, corporal punishment, solitary confinement
- 19th century criticism: prisoners treated better than workers (implying they SHOULD suffer physically)
- "It is difficult to dissociate punishment from additional physical pain"

## 4. FOUCAULT'S CENTRAL ARGUMENT

### The Shift from Body to Soul:

**Mably's principle (1760s):**
> "Punishment, if I may so put it, should strike the soul rather than the body."

**But this is not "progress" or "humanization":**
- New form of power, not less power
- More subtle, more pervasive, more inescapable
- Creates "docile bodies" through discipline, not terror

### The Genealogical Method:

Foucault rejects:
- **Whig history** - "great march toward humanization"
- **Idealist history** - "evolution of ideas/consciousness"
- **Functionalist history** - "needs of industrial society"

Foucault proposes:
- **Genealogy** - trace discontinuities, ruptures, accidents
- **Power/knowledge** - how forms of knowledge emerge from and sustain power relations
- **Micro-physics** - study actual practices, techniques, architectures, not just ideas

### The Real Question:

NOT: "Why did punishment become more humane?"

BUT: "What new form of power emerged? What does it target? How does it operate? What does it produce?"

**Foucault's answer (preview of rest of book):**
- Modern punishment doesn't just respond to crime
- It **produces** delinquency as a manageable category
- It creates knowledge about individuals (criminology, psychology)
- It extends surveillance and normalization throughout society
- Disciplinary techniques spread from prison to schools, factories, hospitals, military

## 5. THE ABOLITION CONNECTION (Harcourt Reading)

### The Punishment Paradigm:

**Harcourt's thesis (building on Foucault):**
- Modern liberal democracies are governed by "punishment paradigm"
- Punishment is mechanism through which societies **create and maintain social order**
- In U.S.: racial and class hierarchies constructed through criminal legal system

**The Pattern:**
- Minimal social support: education, healthcare, mental health, housing
- Everything privatized; individuals "left alone to figure things out"
- BUT: "The minute they are accused of wrongdoing, then we go after them with everything we've got"
- Example: NYC pretrial detention costs $556,539 per person per year
- "We'll spend all the money in the world to punish"

### Mass Incarceration as Deliberate Choice:

**The data:**
- 1973: Beginning of exponential rise in U.S. incarceration
- 2008: 2.3 million incarcerated (1% of adult population)
- 7.3 million under criminal supervision (1 in 31 adults)
- Racial disparities: 1 in 9 Black men aged 20-34 incarcerated

**Harcourt's point:**
> "Like inequality in society, the public policies that created this travesty were chosen and deliberate. There were no natural laws of detention or evolutionary principles at play. It was all constructed and enforced by legislators, sentencing judges, prosecutors, and corrections officials."

### The New Abolition Movement:

**Contemporary abolitionists:**
- Mariame Kaba, Dorothy Roberts, Ruth Wilson Gilmore, Derecka Purnell, Angela Davis
- Call for abolition of: police, jails/prisons, child protective services, immigration detention, border policing
- Not just reform, but dismantling "punitive society"

**Harcourt's proposal: Cooperation Paradigm**
- Replace punishment with cooperation
- "Care about people from the start, rather than investing in them only through prison construction and guard labor"
- Mechanisms of mutual support to allow people to thrive
- Based on "equal citizenship, equity, and respect and care for others and for the environment"

## 6. KEY QUESTIONS FOR CLASS DISCUSSION

### On Foucault's Method:

**1. What does Foucault show us by opening with Damiens' execution?**
- Not just shock value or historical curiosity
- Forces us to see "our" system (prison/discipline) is NOT natural evolution from "their" system (torture/spectacle)
- These are two fundamentally different forms of power with different targets, mechanisms, effects

**2. Is the modern system really "more humane"?**
- Foucault's skepticism: "more subtle, more subdued sufferings, deprived of their visible display"
- Does hiding punishment make it better or just make us more comfortable?
- Physical pain may decrease, but is total institutional control over person's existence worse?

**3. What does it mean to judge the "soul"?**
- How did we get from judging **acts** (did X commit crime Y?) to judging **people** (is X dangerous, treatable, redeemable)?
- Psychiatric expertise, criminal anthropology, risk assessment
- Does this extend power or protect defendants?

**4. History vs. Genealogy — Why does the distinction matter?**
- New scholarship argues prisons existed in ancient times (does this refute Foucault?)
- Harcourt: Foucault wasn't writing history — he was writing **genealogy of power**
- What's the difference between tracing continuity (history) and rupture/new forms (genealogy)?
- Why does this matter for abolition?

### On the Punishment Paradigm:

**5. Does Foucault's analysis apply to the U.S. today?**
- Public spectacle disappeared? (Consider: perp walks, arrest footage, mugshots online)
- Body no longer target? (Consider: police violence, solitary confinement, prison conditions)
- Or has punishment become simultaneously more hidden AND more visible?

**6. What is the relationship between punishment and social order?**
- Foucault/Harcourt claim: punishment doesn't just respond to disorder, it **creates** order
- In U.S.: racial and class hierarchies maintained through criminal legal system
- Is this conspiracy theory or structural analysis?

**7. The Reform Paradox — Does reform help or hurt?**
- Foucault: "Prison reform is virtually contemporary with the prison itself: it constitutes... its programme"
- Angela Davis: Reform has always been part of what creates new prisons
- Harcourt: "Reforming the prison means breathing new life into the institution"
- Is this too cynical? Can meaningful reform exist?

**8. Is abolition realistic or utopian?**
- What would society without punishment look like?
- Cooperation paradigm: invest in support rather than punishment
- Objection: but what about serious harm? Violence? Murder?
- Abolitionist response: ??? (to be developed in class)

### New from Harcourt's 2025 Companion:

**9. What does "politics as continuation of civil war" mean?**
- Foucault's notebooks: "Civil war takes place everywhere" — not before social contract, but **within** it
- Against Hobbes: war doesn't end with the Commonwealth, it just changes form
- How does this frame help us understand criminal law today?

**10. Beyond Discipline — What power structures exist today?**
- Harcourt: Foucault's disciplinary model may not fully explain algorithmic surveillance, warehousing, zero tolerance
- Power today circulates through "desire and lust" in the expository/digital society
- How would Foucault analyze mass incarceration, ICE detention, predictive policing?

---

## 7. CONNECTIONS TO PAST AND FUTURE CLASSES

### Looking Back (Classes 1-9):
- We studied **homicide law**: mens rea, actus reus, intended/unintended killings, causation
- We learned categories: murder degrees, manslaughter, felony murder
- We assumed law's stated purpose: identify culpable actors, assign proportionate punishment

### Today's Shift (Class 10):
- Foucault asks: what if stated purposes aren't real purposes?
- What if punishment serves different function than law claims?
- Genealogy reveals punishment systems are historically contingent, not natural

### Looking Forward (Classes 11-18):
- **Class 11 (Friday)**: Function of Punishment - Alabama slavery cases, Robert Cover on judicial complicity
- **Classes 12-15**: Constitutional limits on punishment, legality, vagueness, death penalty
- **Classes 16-18**: Rape law, morality and criminalization
- Throughout: critical examination of what work punishment actually does

---

## 8. PRACTICAL EXAM RELEVANCE

**Not directly tested, BUT:**
- Understanding Foucault helps with **critical analysis** of any doctrine
- Exam essays reward depth: not just stating rules, but seeing their function
- Questions about deterrence, retribution, rehabilitation — be skeptical of stated purposes
- Policy questions: now you can critique punishment paradigm itself

**Example application:**
- Essay question asks about mens rea standards in felony murder
- Surface answer: explain doctrine, apply to facts
- Deeper answer: note how felony murder extends criminal liability to create broader net of "delinquents" subject to state control (very Foucauldian)
- Don't overdo theory, but show you understand legal categories serve social functions

**New from Harcourt 2025 — The "Reform" Angle:**
- Exam may present reform scenario (e.g., "Should we adopt the MPC approach to X?")
- Foucault/Harcourt insight: reform often **extends** rather than limits punitive systems
- Example: "Three strikes" reforms, "truth in sentencing," risk assessment tools — all presented as improvements but expanded carceral reach
- Be wary of questions that invite you to simply "fix" the system — show you understand the reform paradox

---

## 9. BOTTOM LINE FOR CLASS

### The Central Insight:

Modern punishment is **not** simply a humane replacement for pre-modern torture. It is a fundamentally different technology of power that:
1. Targets the soul/mind/behavior rather than just the body
2. Operates through continuous surveillance and normalization rather than spectacular violence
3. Produces knowledge about individuals (criminology, psychology, risk assessment)
4. Extends disciplinary techniques throughout society (schools, factories, hospitals)
5. Serves to create and maintain social hierarchies, not just respond to crime

### The Abolitionist Challenge:

If punishment functions primarily to maintain social order (especially racial/class hierarchy) rather than to protect public safety, then:
1. Reform is insufficient — tinkering with system that serves unjust function
2. **Reform IS the prison's program** — reform breathes new life into the institution (Harcourt 2025)
3. Abolition becomes thinkable — not chaos, but alternative paradigm
4. Cooperation paradigm — invest in mutual support, not punishment

### What's New from Harcourt's 2025 Companion:

**Foucault wasn't writing a history of prisons:**
- He was writing a **genealogy of how modern societies produce truth about subjects**
- The prison was his case study for a broader analysis of power/knowledge regimes
- Panopticism was a **metaphor** for generalized discipline, not just architectural plans

**Foucault's method matters more than his specific model:**
- Disciplinary power (19th century) may not fully explain today's digital/expository society
- But his **genealogical method** — studying how power produces truth — remains essential
- We need to use his method to analyze algorithmic surveillance, warehousing, zero tolerance

**The political stakes of "continuity":**
- Arguments that "prisons have always existed" undermine the radical break abolition demands
- We've overcome other historical inhuman practices (slavery, torture) without reform — why not prisons?
- Harcourt: "This is no time for backsliding on the prison... strive for a new episteme."

### What to Watch For in Discussion:

- How does Harcourt connect Foucault's historical analysis to contemporary mass incarceration?
- What is the relationship between "discipline" (Foucault) and "abolition" (contemporary movement)?
- How do we reconcile skepticism about punishment with need to respond to serious harm?
- Is the cooperation paradigm realistic, or does it assume too much about human nature?
- **New:** How do we use Foucault's method to analyze power structures beyond disciplinary institutions?

---

**REMEMBER:** This is a **theory** class. You're not expected to have all the answers. The goal is to question assumptions about punishment that seem natural or inevitable. Foucault's method is to make the familiar strange — to see that our system is historically contingent, serves particular functions, and could be otherwise. The new archival insights show us that Foucault was developing a method for analyzing power, not just describing 19th-century prisons.
