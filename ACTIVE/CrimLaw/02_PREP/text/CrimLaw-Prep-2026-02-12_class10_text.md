## 2. FOUCAULT'S OPENING CONTRAST (pp. 3-16)

### Scene 1: Public Execution of Damiens (March 2, 1757)

**The Sentence:**
- Robert-François Damiens attempted to assassinate King Louis XV (regicide)
- Condemned to make public penance before Church of Paris, then taken to Place de Grève
- Torture sequence: flesh torn with red-hot pincers, right hand (holding knife) burnt with sulphur, molten lead/boiling oil/burning resin poured into wounds, body drawn and quartered by horses, remains burned to ashes

**The Reality (from eyewitness Bouton):**
- Execution became extended spectacle lasting hours
- Horses failed to quarter body; initially 4 horses, then 6, still unsuccessful
- Executioners forced to cut sinews and hack at joints
- Damiens remained conscious throughout, crying "My God, have pity on me! Jesus, help me!"
- Even after limbs torn off, trunk still showed signs of life when thrown on stake
- Body took four hours to burn completely; last ember burning at 10:30 PM
- Crowds watched; confessors consoled condemned man; officials supervised every detail

**Key Features:**
- **Public spectacle** - elaborate theater of state power
- **Body as target** - physical pain, torture, dismemberment, destruction
- **Ceremonial excess** - ritual must display sovereign's power through criminal's body
- **Extended duration** - "slow death" multiplied by calculated interruptions

### Scene 2: Prison Timetable (Eighty Years Later, 1830s-40s)

**Leon Faucher's Rules for House of Young Prisoners in Paris:**
- Minute-by-minute schedule from 5-6 AM rising to 7:30-8:30 PM lights out
- Drum-rolls signal each activity transition
- Activities: work (9 hours), instruction (2 hours), meals, chapel, recreation
- Constant supervision: supervisors open cells, lead to chapel, watch in courtyards, inspect clothing, ensure silence
- Evening ritual: reading of "instructive or uplifting work," prayer, inspection, bed

**Key Features:**
- **Invisible power** - no spectacle, routine bureaucracy
- **Time as target** - not body's pain but body's time, organized in precise units
- **Disciplinary technique** - schedules, surveillance, normalization
- **Continuous control** - every moment accounted for and directed

### Foucault's Question:

> "We have, then, a public execution and a time-table. They do not punish the same crimes or the same type of delinquent. But they each define a certain penal style. Less than a century separates them."

**What changed?** Not just "humanization" or "progress" — something fundamental about the **object, mechanisms, and function** of punishment.

## 3. THE TRANSFORMATION OF PUNISHMENT (pp. 7-16)

### What Disappeared:

**1. The Public Spectacle**
- Torture abolished (France 1789-1791-1830; England 1834-37)
- Pillory abolished (France 1789; England 1837)
- Public chain gangs abolished (early 1800s)
- Public exhibitions of prisoners ceased (France 1848)
- Execution became hidden: closed carriages, prison walls, secret witnesses
- "Ugly to be punishable, but there is no glory in punishing"

**2. The Body as Direct Target**
- No more torture as "art of unbearable sensations"
- Punishment becomes "economy of suspended rights"
- Physical pain no longer "constituent element of the penalty"
- Law reaches body "at a distance, in the proper way, according to strict rules"

**3. The Ceremony of Punishment**
- Shift from spectacle to bureaucracy
- Justice "ashamed" of its own violence
- Punishment delegated to "autonomous sector" (prisons, administrators)
- Double system of protection between justice and penalty

### What Appeared:

**1. New Objects of Judgment**
- Not just crime, but "soul" of criminal
- "Passions, instincts, anomalies, infirmities, maladjustments, effects of environment or heredity"
- Psychiatric expertise, criminal anthropology, criminology
- Assessment of dangerousness, treatability, future behavior

**2. New Techniques of Control**
- Imprisonment, forced labor, prohibition from entering areas
- "Security measures" beyond formal sentence
- Surveillance, normalization, rehabilitation
- Time-tables, architectural designs, supervision systems

**3. New Justifications**
- From expiation to correction: "A technique of improvement"
- Penalty aims to make offender "capable of living within the law"
- Judges claim not to punish but to "correct, reclaim, 'cure'"
- Proliferation of "technicians": warders, doctors, chaplains, psychiatrists, psychologists, educators

### The Persistence of "Torture":

**Foucault's caveat:**
- Physical pain did NOT entirely disappear
- Imprisonment "has always involved a certain degree of physical pain"
- Rationing of food, sexual deprivation, corporal punishment, solitary confinement
- 19th century criticism: prisoners treated better than workers (implying they SHOULD suffer physically)
- "It is difficult to dissociate punishment from additional physical pain"

## 4. FOUCAULT'S CENTRAL ARGUMENT

### The Shift from Body to Soul:

**Mably's principle (1760s):**
> "Punishment, if I may so put it, should strike the soul rather than the body."

**But this is not "progress" or "humanization":**
- New form of power, not less power
- More subtle, more pervasive, more inescapable
- Creates "docile bodies" through discipline, not terror

### The Genealogical Method:

Foucault rejects:
- **Whig history** - "great march toward humanization"
- **Idealist history** - "evolution of ideas/consciousness"
- **Functionalist history** - "needs of industrial society"

Foucault proposes:
- **Genealogy** - trace discontinuities, ruptures, accidents
- **Power/knowledge** - how forms of knowledge emerge from and sustain power relations
- **Micro-physics** - study actual practices, techniques, architectures, not just ideas

### The Real Question:

NOT: "Why did punishment become more humane?"

BUT: "What new form of power emerged? What does it target? How does it operate? What does it produce?"

**Foucault's answer (preview of rest of book):**
- Modern punishment doesn't just respond to crime
- It **produces** delinquency as a manageable category
- It creates knowledge about individuals (criminology, psychology)
- It extends surveillance and normalization throughout society
- Disciplinary techniques spread from prison to schools, factories, hospitals, military

## 5. THE ABOLITION CONNECTION (Harcourt Reading)

### The Punishment Paradigm:

**Harcourt's thesis (building on Foucault):**
- Modern liberal democracies are governed by "punishment paradigm"
- Punishment is mechanism through which societies **create and maintain social order**
- In U.S.: racial and class hierarchies constructed through criminal legal system

**The Pattern:**
- Minimal social support: education, healthcare, mental health, housing
- Everything privatized; individuals "left alone to figure things out"
- BUT: "The minute they are accused of wrongdoing, then we go after them with everything we've got"
- Example: NYC pretrial detention costs $556,539 per person per year
- "We'll spend all the money in the world to punish"

### Mass Incarceration as Deliberate Choice:

**The data:**
- 1973: Beginning of exponential rise in U.S. incarceration
- 2008: 2.3 million incarcerated (1% of adult population)
- 7.3 million under criminal supervision (1 in 31 adults)
- Racial disparities: 1 in 9 Black men aged 20-34 incarcerated

**Harcourt's point:**
> "Like inequality in society, the public policies that created this travesty were chosen and deliberate. There were no natural laws of detention or evolutionary principles at play. It was all constructed and enforced by legislators, sentencing judges, prosecutors, and corrections officials."

### The New Abolition Movement:

**Contemporary abolitionists:**
- Mariame Kaba, Dorothy Roberts, Ruth Wilson Gilmore, Derecka Purnell, Angela Davis
- Call for abolition of: police, jails/prisons, child protective services, immigration detention, border policing
- Not just reform, but dismantling "punitive society"

**Harcourt's proposal: Cooperation Paradigm**
- Replace punishment with cooperation
- "Care about people from the start, rather than investing in them only through prison construction and guard labor"
- Mechanisms of mutual support to allow people to thrive
- Based on "equal citizenship, equity, and respect and care for others and for the environment"

## 6. KEY QUESTIONS FOR CLASS DISCUSSION

### On Foucault's Method:

**1. What does Foucault show us by opening with Damiens' execution?**
- Not just shock value or historical curiosity
- Forces us to see "our" system (prison/discipline) is NOT natural evolution from "their" system (torture/spectacle)
- These are two fundamentally different forms of power with different targets, mechanisms, effects

**2. Is the modern system really "more humane"?**
- Foucault's skepticism: "more subtle, more subdued sufferings, deprived of their visible display"
- Does hiding punishment make it better or just make us more comfortable?
- Physical pain may decrease, but is total institutional control over person's existence worse?

**3. What does it mean to judge the "soul"?**
- How did we get from judging **acts** (did X commit crime Y?) to judging **people** (is X dangerous, treatable, redeemable)?
- Psychiatric expertise, criminal anthropology, risk assessment
- Does this extend power or protect defendants?

### On the Punishment Paradigm:

**4. Does Foucault's analysis apply to the U.S. today?**
- Public spectacle disappeared? (Consider: perp walks, arrest footage, mugshots online)
- Body no longer target? (Consider: police violence, solitary confinement, prison conditions)
- Or has punishment become simultaneously more hidden AND more visible?

**5. What is the relationship between punishment and social order?**
- Foucault/Harcourt claim: punishment doesn't just respond to disorder, it **creates** order
- In U.S.: racial and class hierarchies maintained through criminal legal system
- Is this conspiracy theory or structural analysis?

**6. Is abolition realistic or utopian?**
- What would society without punishment look like?
- Cooperation paradigm: invest in support rather than punishment
- Objection: but what about serious harm? Violence? Murder?
- Abolitionist response: ??? (to be developed in class)

## 7. CONNECTIONS TO PAST AND FUTURE CLASSES

### Looking Back (Classes 1-9):
- We studied **homicide law**: mens rea, actus reus, intended/unintended killings, causation
- We learned categories: murder degrees, manslaughter, felony murder
- We assumed law's stated purpose: identify culpable actors, assign proportionate punishment

### Today's Shift (Class 10):
- Foucault asks: what if stated purposes aren't real purposes?
- What if punishment serves different function than law claims?
- Genealogy reveals punishment systems are historically contingent, not natural

### Looking Forward (Classes 11-18):
- **Class 11 (Friday)**: Function of Punishment - Alabama slavery cases, Robert Cover on judicial complicity
- **Classes 12-15**: Constitutional limits on punishment, legality, vagueness, death penalty
- **Classes 16-18**: Rape law, morality and criminalization
- Throughout: critical examination of what work punishment actually does

---

## 8. PRACTICAL EXAM RELEVANCE

**Not directly tested, BUT:**
- Understanding Foucault helps with **critical analysis** of any doctrine
- Exam essays reward depth: not just stating rules, but seeing their function
- Questions about deterrence, retribution, rehabilitation — be skeptical of stated purposes
- Policy questions: now you can critique punishment paradigm itself

**Example application:**
- Essay question asks about mens rea standards in felony murder
- Surface answer: explain doctrine, apply to facts
- Deeper answer: note how felony murder extends criminal liability to create broader net of "delinquents" subject to state control (very Foucauldian)
- Don't overdo theory, but show you understand legal categories serve social functions

## 9. BOTTOM LINE FOR CLASS

### The Central Insight:

Modern punishment is **not** simply a humane replacement for pre-modern torture. It is a fundamentally different technology of power that:
1. Targets the soul/mind/behavior rather than just the body
2. Operates through continuous surveillance and normalization rather than spectacular violence
3. Produces knowledge about individuals (criminology, psychology, risk assessment)
4. Extends disciplinary techniques throughout society (schools, factories, hospitals)
5. Serves to create and maintain social hierarchies, not just respond to crime

### The Abolitionist Challenge:

If punishment functions primarily to maintain social order (especially racial/class hierarchy) rather than to protect public safety, then:
1. Reform is insufficient — tinkering with system that serves unjust function
2. Abolition becomes thinkable — not chaos, but alternative paradigm
3. Cooperation paradigm — invest in mutual support, not punishment

### What to Watch For in Discussion:

- How does Harcourt connect Foucault's historical analysis to contemporary mass incarceration?
- What is the relationship between "discipline" (Foucault) and "abolition" (contemporary movement)?
- How do we reconcile skepticism about punishment with need to respond to serious harm?
- Is the cooperation paradigm realistic, or does it assume too much about human nature?

**REMEMBER:** This is a **theory** class. You're not expected to have all the answers. The goal is to question assumptions about punishment that seem natural or inevitable. Foucault's method is to make the familiar strange — to see that our system is historically contingent, serves particular functions, and could be otherwise.
