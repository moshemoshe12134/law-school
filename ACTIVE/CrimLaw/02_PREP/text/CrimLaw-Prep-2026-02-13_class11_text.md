## 2. CASE SUMMARIES (Quick facts/legal issues/outcomes)

### State v. Clarissa (Alabama, 1847):

**Facts:**
- Clarissa, an enslaved woman, worked as cook for her overseer Nelson Parsons
- Parsons and another white man (Bussey, Clarissa's enslaver) became ill after drinking coffee she prepared; symptoms consistent with narcotic poison
- Clarissa's mother (Chloe, also enslaved) testified that she had seen Clarissa put bag of Jamestown weed seeds in coffee pot on two occasions; on one occasion, Chloe removed the bag to protect Bussey
- Chloe initially denied knowledge but confessed after being whipped by Bussey
- Clarissa was whipped "with great severity" but refused to confess
- When told her mother had confessed, Clarissa confessed
- Two days later (Thursday→Saturday), Clarissa moved from house to field; overseer called her back, asked if she preferred cooking or field work, she said cooking, he then asked "why she had continued to give him poison when she saw him so near dying"; she replied she didn't know "unless it was the devil that put it into her head"

**Legal Issues:**
1. **Indictment sufficiency**: Does indictment need to allege that Jamestown weed is "a deadly poison" or "calculated to destroy human life"?
2. **Grand jury challenge**: Can defendant purge/challenge grand jury before indictment is found?
3. **Confession admissibility**: Are confessions after torture/coercion admissible? What about subsequent "independent" confessions?

**Holdings:**
1. **Indictment INSUFFICIENT**: Must allege substance is deadly poison or calculated to cause death; court "cannot know as matter of law that seed of Jamestown weed is a deadly poison"
2. **Grand jury challenge DENIED**: No right to have grand jury "expurgate themselves" before indictment; challenges must be by plea in abatement at term when indictment found
3. **Confessions EXCLUDED**: 
   - First confession (after whipping) properly excluded
   - Second confession (Saturday) also inadmissible because overseer's question "assumed the fact of her guilt from her previous confession" — didn't propose question of guilt/innocence, just asked for reason for conduct
   - Court states: "When a confession has been extorted by threats or punishment... it would seem that no subsequent confession of the same facts, ought in the case of slaves, under any circumstances to be admitted"

**Disposition:** Conviction reversed; Clarissa remanded to custody for new indictment or until discharged

**Key language (Ormond, J.):**
> "Although the confessions of slaves, freely and voluntarily made... must... be received in evidence, it must be admitted, their condition in the scale of society, throws a certain degree of discredit over any confession of guilt they may make, and renders it unsafe if not improper, to act upon such evidence alone, without other corroborating proof."

> "The humane policy of our law would exclude such evidence coming from a white person, and the reason is much stronger for excluding it in the case of a slave."

### Wyatt v. The State (Alabama, 1854):

**Facts:**
- Wyatt (enslaved) ran away from master; same night, master's gin-house burned down
- Wyatt captured 2-3 nights later; master said "Well, boy, you have done it now" (assuming guilt)
- Master bound Wyatt and left; Wyatt said "Master, I want to talk with you"; master replied "I don't want to hear a word from you"
- Next morning, master found Wyatt had cut his hands with razor trying to escape
- Master said: "Boy, these denials only make the matter worse"
- Wyatt replied: "Master, I have done wrong"
- Master asked: "What have you done?" Wyatt answered: "I burnt your gin-house"
- Same day, master took Wyatt before justice of the peace; when justice asked master what Wyatt had done, master said "He has burnt my gin-house; examine him for yourself"
- Justice examined Wyatt in master's presence; Wyatt repeated same confessions

**Legal Issue:** Are confessions admissible?

**Holding (Chilton, C.J.):** Both confessions INADMISSIBLE

**Reasoning:**
- Master-slave relation creates "influence over the mind of the slave" — "naturally looks to his master for protection... accustomed to throw himself upon his leniency and mercy, and... by honest confessions of his guilt, to mitigate the chastisement"
- Master's statement "these denials only make the matter worse" (even though master claimed he was referring to denial of having a knife) was "calculated to excite in him the hope that a confession would make the matter better"
- Under rule from *Clarissa*, subsequent confession before magistrate also tainted because "the same inducement to confess continued"
- Before repetition before magistrate can be received, "the influence of the former inducement, and all fear of punishment from a recantation of his confessions, must be 'totally done away with'"
- Justice failed to caution Wyatt about effect of confessions

**Disposition:** Conviction reversed

**Key language:**
> "Keeping in view this relation [of ownership and dominion], it is proper that we should examine with caution, whether the confessions of guilt made by a slave in interviews had with his master... were not elicited or controlled by the relation, and predicated upon the fear of punishment or injury, or upon the hope of some benefit to be gained by making them."

## 3. SYLLABUS QUESTIONS (What Harcourt wants you to see)

The syllabus asks you to consider:

**1. What are the STATED purposes in the legal decisions?**
- *Clarissa*: "Humane policy of our law" protects slaves from coerced confessions (even more than whites)
- *Wyatt*: Courts must examine "with caution" whether confessions were "elicited or controlled by the relation"
- Stated purpose: **Fairness, due process, protection of the vulnerable**

**2. What do you think is REALLY going on?**
- Both convictions reversed BUT both defendants "remain in custody for another indictment"
- Courts don't question slavery itself — only procedural fairness **within** the system
- Law treats enslaved people as property (cases filed as "State v. [First Name], A Slave" or "property of [Owner]")
- Confessions inadmissible partly because of "their condition in the scale of society" — acknowledging dehumanization while perpetuating it
- **Real function:** Law legitimates slavery by appearing fair while maintaining total domination
- Exclusion of confessions doesn't free defendants — just requires better evidence/procedure

**3. How do we reconcile what is SAID and what is DONE?**
- **Said:** Law protects enslaved people from torture-induced confessions
- **Done:** Law maintains system of slavery; "protection" serves to legitimate the system
- Courts apply "humane" rules but never question whether enslaving humans is "humane"
- **Cover's question:** Why do judges comply with systems they know are unjust?

## 4. ROBERT COVER — "Of Creon and Captain Vere" (Key Arguments)

### The Central Problem: Complicity, Not Disobedience

**Cover's observation:**
> "To focus upon the disobedient and the process of disobedience is to accept the perspective of the established order. It is a concession that it is the man who appeals beyond law that is in need of explanation."

- We celebrate **civil disobedience** (Antigone, Martin Luther King, Gandhi) — the dramatic individual who defies unjust law
- We rarely study **complicity** — judges/officials who enforce laws they personally believe are immoral
- **Why?** Studying complicity questions legitimacy of legal systems themselves

### Captain Vere as Model for Judicial Complicity

**Billy Budd summary:**
- Billy Budd (innocent sailor) falsely accused of mutiny by evil first mate Claggart
- Billy, struck dumb by accusation, lashes out and kills Claggart with single blow
- Captain Vere must apply Mutiny Act; instructs drumhead court to convict/hang Billy
- Vere acknowledges Billy is "innocent before God" but says: "Do these buttons that we wear attest that our allegiance is to Nature? No, to the King."

**Five elements of Captain Vere's legal formalism:**
1. **Role consciousness:** "It is a uniform, not nature, that defines obligation"
2. **Law distinct from transcendent/personal sources:** "The law is neither nature nor conscience"
3. **Identifiable source:** Imperial code/Mutiny Act governs
4. **Will behind law is NOT judge's will:** "Imperial will" (constitutional structure), not Vere's personal will
5. **Judge not responsible for content:** "For that law and the rigor of it, we are not responsible. Our... responsibility is in this: That however pitilessly that law may operate... we nevertheless adhere to it and administer it."

**Character of Captain Vere:**
- Nickname from Marvell: "Under the discipline severe / Of Fairfax and the starry Vere" (suggests impersonal severity)
- Eschewed innovations "disinterestedly"; lacked "companionable quality"
- "Disposed to approach life institutionally, to avoid the personal realm"
- "Inflexibly honest, righteous, and duty bound"
- Exclaimed: "Struck dead by an angel of God! Yet the angel must hang."
- Assumed "paternal stance" like "Abraham embracing Isaac... in obedience to the exacting behest"

**Cover's questions:**
- What "deep urge" leads a man to condemn "unworldly beauty and innocence"?
- How reconcile recognition of Billy's innocence with seizing opportunity to condemn him?
- Why does Vere "hear and obey the voice of the Master so quickly"?
- **Our doubts compound when "it is a harsh social system that becomes the Lord"**

**The historical model:**
- Cover suggests Melville's model was **Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw** (Melville's father-in-law)
- Shaw: "firm, unbending man of stern integrity"; strong private opponent of slavery
- BUT: Shaw enforced Fugitive Slave Act in his judicial capacity
- **This is the puzzle:** Personally moral judge enforcing immoral law

## 5. MICHEL FOUCAULT — "Lecture of April 22, 1981" (Key Arguments)

### The Central Question: How Do Legal Procedures Construct "Truth"?

**Foucault's method:**
- Examines chariot race dispute in Homer's *Iliad* (Book 23, Patroclus's funeral games)
- Not interested in "what really happened" — interested in **how truth is established through procedure**

**The dispute:**
- Chariot race; question of who came in second place
- Competitors: Diomedes (1st), then dispute over 2nd/3rd between Eumelus and Antilochus
- Antilochus took 2nd by driving recklessly (Nestor had advised him to use tricks to win)
- Menelaus claims Antilochus cheated; demands Antilochus swear oath OR concede prize

**Key insight:**
- Truth is NOT determined by "what happened" (no replay, no neutral witnesses)
- Truth determined by **judicial ritual**: who can demand oath? Who must swear? What does refusal to swear mean?
- Menelaus has standing to challenge because of his status; his demand for oath is itself a form of judgment
- Antilochus **doesn't swear** — instead, offers prize to Menelaus voluntarily
- By not swearing, Antilochus avoids making a formal "avowal" of wrongdoing, but outcome is same

**Foucault's broader claim:**
- Legal procedures don't **discover** truth; they **produce** truth
- "Avowal" (confession, oath) is mechanism by which legal system generates truth-claims
- The procedure itself (who can speak, when, in what form) determines what counts as "true"
- This is how law maintains power: by controlling the production of truth

**Connection to Clarissa/Wyatt:**
- Enslaved people's confessions are **compelled** through violence (whipping) and power relation (master-slave)
- Courts exclude confessions not because system is fair, but because confessions were produced through WRONG PROCEDURE
- If confession produced through "proper" procedure (voluntary before magistrate), it would establish "truth" — even if equally coerced by structural violence of slavery

**Takeaway:**
- Law doesn't seek pre-existing truth; law creates truth through its procedures
- What courts call "truth" is product of power relations and ritual forms
- Exclusion of coerced confessions maintains **appearance** of fairness while perpetuating domination

## 6. HARCOURT FRAMING (What "work" is punishment doing?)

### Three Functions of Punishment (Stated vs. Unstated):

**Stated purposes (traditional theories):**
1. **Retribution:** Moral desert; wrongdoer deserves punishment
2. **Deterrence:** Prevent future crimes (general & specific)
3. **Incapacitation:** Protect society by restraining dangerous people
4. **Rehabilitation:** Reform the criminal

**Unstated functions (critical perspective):**
1. **Social ordering:** Punishment maintains hierarchies (race, class, power)
   - *Clarissa/Wyatt*: Law enforces slavery while appearing "humane"
2. **Legitimation:** Procedure makes power appear neutral/fair
   - Excluding coerced confessions signals "fairness" without questioning slavery
3. **Subject formation:** Law produces categories of personhood
   - "Slave" as legal category; person as property
4. **Truth production:** Legal rituals determine what counts as "true"
   - Confession = truth (if procedurally proper)

### The Alabama Cases as Illustration:

**What the cases say they're doing:**
- Protecting vulnerable defendants from coerced confessions
- Applying "humane policy" of law equally (or more) to slaves

**What the cases are actually doing:**
- Legitimating slavery by appearing fair and procedurally rigorous
- Maintaining master-slave power relation (both defendants "remain in custody")
- Producing legal "truth" about enslaved people's confessions through procedure
- Creating appearance of legal personhood (slaves have procedural rights) while denying substantive personhood (they remain property)

**The judicial dilemma (Cover):**
- Judges who oppose slavery enforce slave law
- Possible explanations:
  1. **Legal formalism:** "I just apply the law; I'm not responsible for its content" (Captain Vere)
  2. **Role morality:** "My duty as judge overrides my personal morality"
  3. **System preservation:** "If I don't enforce law, legal system collapses"
  4. **Gradualism:** "Procedure improvements are progress; questioning slavery would be too radical"

**Harcourt's likely push:**
- Is procedural fairness within an unjust system a form of progress or complicity?
- Do these cases make slavery MORE sustainable by making it appear lawful/humane?
- What should judges do when law requires them to enforce what they believe is immoral?
- How does focusing on procedure (confession admissibility) distract from substance (slavery itself)?

## 7. POLICY/THEORY ARGUMENTS

**Argument 1: Procedural Fairness Can Legitimate Injustice**
- Alabama courts exclude coerced confessions (procedural win for defendants)
- BUT this makes slavery appear compatible with "rule of law"
- Procedural protections can serve to **entrench** substantive injustice by making system appear fair
- Modern parallel: Miranda rights make police interrogation appear legitimate; but does that legitimize mass incarceration?

**Argument 2: Judicial Complicity Is Under-Examined**
- We celebrate resisters (Antigone, MLK) but don't study complicit officials (Creon, judges who enforced slavery)
- This reflects "perspective of established order" — assumes system is basically legitimate, only extremists need explanation
- Critical approach: examine how "good people" participate in evil systems
- Judges personally opposed to slavery chose duty to law over duty to morality

**Argument 3: Law Produces "Truth" Rather Than Discovering It**
- Foucault: Legal procedures don't find pre-existing truth; they CREATE truth through ritual
- Confession = truth, but only if produced through proper procedure
- This is how law maintains power: by controlling what counts as "true"
- Modern parallel: Plea bargaining produces "truth" (guilty plea) through coercion (trial penalty)

**Argument 4: Law Constructs Social Hierarchies**
- *Clarissa/Wyatt*: Law simultaneously treats enslaved people as persons (with procedural rights) and property (ownership relation determines confession admissibility)
- Law doesn't just reflect social hierarchy; it **produces** it
- Categories like "slave," "felon," "citizen" are legal constructs that shape lived reality

## 8. EXAM STRATEGIES FOR THEORY/POLICY CLASSES

**When Harcourt asks policy questions:**
1. **Identify tension:** What's the gap between stated purpose and actual function?
2. **Use critical theorists:** Cover (complicity), Foucault (truth-production), Balkin (dyads)
3. **Historical examples:** Slavery cases, capital punishment, drug war — how does law maintain social order?
4. **Both sides:** Defend procedural fairness (incremental progress) AND critique it (legitimates injustice)

**Key moves:**
- **Time-framing (Kelman):** Narrow (this case) vs. Broad (system of slavery)
- **Dyads (Balkin):** Rules vs. Standards; Formal vs. Substantive; Procedure vs. Substance
- **Functionalist analysis:** What work is this doing? Who benefits? What hierarchy does it maintain?

---

## 9. QUICK HYPOS / DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

**Hypo 1: Modern Analogy**
- **Facts:** Judge personally opposes death penalty; believes it's cruel and immoral. Jury convicts defendant of capital murder; judge must impose death sentence under state law.
- **Issue:** Should judge impose sentence? Resign? Nullify?
- **Application:** Captain Vere's dilemma — "allegiance is to... the King," not personal morality. But is preserving legal system worth participating in killings you believe are murder?

**Hypo 2: Miranda as Legitimation**
- **Facts:** Police read Miranda rights, then interrogate suspect for 8 hours in windowless room; suspect "voluntarily" confesses.
- **Issue:** Does Miranda make confession admissible? Does it make system fair?
- **Application:** Like *Clarissa/Wyatt* — procedure (Miranda) makes confession appear voluntary, but structural coercion (police power, fear, exhaustion) remains. Does procedural "fairness" legitimate coercive system?

**Hypo 3: Plea Bargaining**
- **Facts:** Prosecutor charges defendant with 10 counts carrying 50 years; offers plea to 1 count for 2 years. Defendant "voluntarily" pleads guilty.
- **Issue:** Is plea "voluntary"? What truth does it produce?
- **Application:** Foucault — plea procedure produces "truth" (guilty) through coercion (trial penalty). But courts call it "voluntary" because procedure followed.
