## 1. CASES FOR TODAY

**Purpose:** Watch Quimbee videos for these cases (include court/year to disambiguate)

- **Regina v. Serné (English Crown Cases Reserved, 1887)** — KSSB10 pp. 517-520
  - *Quimbee search:* "Regina v. Serné England 1887"
  - Topic: Foundational statement of felony murder; Judge Stephen's skepticism about scope

- **People v. Stamp (California Court of Appeal, 1969)** — KSSB10 pp. 520-522
  - *Quimbee search:* "People v. Stamp California 1969"
  - Topic: Strict liability — felon liable for unforeseeable heart attack

- **State v. Canola (New Jersey Supreme Court, 1977)** — KSSB10 pp. 544-552
  - *Quimbee search:* "State v. Canola New Jersey 1977"
  - Topic: Agency theory adopted — not liable when victim kills co-felon

## 1.2. NON-CASE MATERIALS (policy / institutions)

- **Sarah Stillman, “Sentenced to Life for an Accident Miles Away” (The New Yorker, Dec. 11, 2023)**  
  - Local copy: `01_SOURCES/readings/03_homicide/Sentenced to Life for an Accident Miles Away _ The New Yorker.txt`
  - Anchor example: Sadik Baxter charged with felony murder for a fatal police-chase crash even though he was in handcuffs miles away.
  - Themes to have ready: felony murder as strict-liability/plea leverage; mass incarceration + racial disparity; “who gets charged” distribution.
  - **What it’s about (1-minute brief):**
    - Stillman uses the Baxter case to show how felony murder can treat non-killers (and even non-present defendants) as first-degree murderers when a death occurs “in the course of” a qualifying felony.
    - Framing claim: the U.S. retains/expands felony murder even after the U.K. and other Commonwealth countries abolished it (Bentley execution → abolition), and felony-murder charging surged in the 1970s alongside mass incarceration.
    - Prosecutor-side rationale in the piece: it is an “efficient path to conviction” because mens rea for the killing (and sometimes even presence) is not required; it also creates massive plea pressure (“shadow of felony-murder charges”).
    - Data claim in the piece: states often don’t track felony murder separately; Stillman reports her team documented 10,000+ felony-murder convictions nationwide and found stark racial disparities in the available data (e.g., Wisconsin and St. Louis examples).
  - **How to use it in class/exam (tie to today’s cases):**
    - *Stamp* = strict-liability feel: you don’t litigate foreseeability of death much; the fight becomes “during/flight” + causation connection.
    - *Canola* = “who did the killing?” boundary: agency vs proximate cause decides whether third-party killings can be pinned on the felons; Stillman’s “miles away / in handcuffs” story is a time-framing + causation challenge.
    - *Serné* = limiting principle: felony murder should not be “any felony + any death”; press “dangerous to life” / culpability concerns.
- **Adnan Khan (Marshall Project commentary + NYT video)**  
  - Use the syllabus links; be ready to connect facts → doctrine → institutional consequences.
  - As you watch/read: tag (1) role in the felony, (2) distance in time/place from the death, (3) prosecution’s causation story, (4) defense’s time-framing response.

## 1.5. CASE BRIEFS (Quick facts/reasoning/holding)

**Regina v. Serné (1887):**
- **Issue:** Is felony murder “any felony + any death,” or is it limited to felonies/acts **known to be dangerous to life**?
- **Facts:** D, in debt, insured his son’s life and set fire to his shop/home; both sons died in the fire.
- **Rule/Instruction (Stephen, J.):** “Malice” can be satisfied by intent to commit a felony **known to be dangerous to life and likely to cause death**; rejects overbreadth (“push to steal a watch” worry).
- **Disposition:** Jury acquitted; the case is famous for the limiting instruction, not an appellate holding.

**People v. Stamp (1969):**
- **Issue:** Does felony murder require foreseeability of death?
- **Facts:** During an armed robbery, victim with a preexisting heart condition suffered a fatal heart attack shortly after (fright/shock).
- **Reasoning:** Felony murder is not limited to foreseeable deaths; “robber takes victim as he finds him” (eggshell victim logic).
- **Holding:** Murder conviction upheld.

**State v. Canola (1977):**
- **Issue:** Can a felon be guilty of felony murder when a **victim** kills a co-felon during the felony (agency vs. proximate cause)?
- **Facts:** Attempted armed robbery of a jewelry store; shootout ensued; the store owner and one robber died (owner shot by a robber; robber shot by the owner).
- **Reasoning:** Court adopts **agency theory**: felony murder requires the killing be by defendant or an accomplice; tort-style proximate cause is a poor fit for first-degree murder culpability.
- **Holding:** Felony-murder conviction reversed for the co-felon’s death (killed by the victim); felony-murder conviction for the store owner’s death upheld (killed by a participant).

## 2. STATUTE / RULE (Core text to have ready)

**Felony Murder (Common Law — core idea):**

Intent to commit the felony is treated as supplying the “malice” for murder when a death occurs in the course of a qualifying felony (so it has a strict-liability feel as to the killing).

**Core elements (agency version):**
1. A death
2. During commission/attempt/immediate flight from a qualifying felony
3. Defendant was a participant in the felony
4. The killing was committed by the defendant or another participant, and is sufficiently connected to the felony (often framed as “in furtherance of” / causally connected)

**Harcourt-style element fights (what changes outcomes):**
- **Which felonies qualify?** Enumerated list vs “inherently dangerous” limitation; *Serné* suggests “dangerous to life.”
- **When is it ‘during’?** Commission vs escape vs after-the-fact (time-framing).
- **Who must do the killing?** **Agency** (majority; *Canola*) vs **proximate cause** (minority).
- **Whose death counts?** Many statutes exclude co-felon deaths (“other than a participant”).

**Mens rea move:** No separate mens rea for the death under classic felony murder; mens rea for the felony supplies “malice.”

**Dangerous Felonies (Traditional List):**
- Arson
- Robbery
- Rape
- Burglary
- Kidnapping
- (Some add: escape, sodomy)

**MPC §210.2(1)(b) — Murder:**

> "Criminal homicide constitutes murder when... it is committed recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life. Such recklessness and indifference are **presumed** if the actor is engaged or is an accomplice in... robbery, rape, arson, burglary, kidnapping or felonious escape."

**Key MPC Point:** Presumption (rebuttable), not strict liability. Limited to dangerous felonies.

**Source:** KSSB10 pp. 517-522, 544-552, MPC §210.2

## 3. PROSECUTION ARGUMENTS (2-3 arguments)

**Argument 1: Strict Liability (*Stamp* Rule)**
- Felon liable for ALL deaths during felony, whether foreseeable or not
- "Robber takes victim as he finds him" — preexisting conditions don't matter
- *Stamp*: Heart attack during robbery = felony murder (no foreseeability required)
- Deterrence rationale: Put felons on notice — any death triggers murder liability

**Argument 2: Proximate Cause Theory (Minority)**
- Felon liable for ANY death that's foreseeable/proximate result of felony
- Can include deaths caused by victim (self-defense), police, or bystanders responding to the felony (depending on jurisdiction/statute)
- But-for the felony, death wouldn't occur — felon created the risk
- Prosecutor lever: broad time-framing (attempt + escape + immediate flight) to keep the death “during” the felony

**Argument 3: MPC Presumption (§210.2(1)(b))**
- Engaging in dangerous felony creates **presumption** of extreme indifference to human life
- Presumption hard to rebut — functionally similar to common-law felony murder
- Limited to inherently dangerous felonies (arson, robbery, rape, burglary, kidnapping)
- More doctrinally sound than strict liability (retains mens rea element)

---

## 4. DEFENSE ARGUMENTS (2-3 arguments)

**Argument 1: Not “Any Felony + Any Death” (*Serné* Limitation)**
- *Serné* limiting move: felony murder should not be “any felony + any death”
- Require the act/felony be **known to be dangerous to life and likely to cause death** (culpability principle)
- Felony murder otherwise risks punishing “bad luck” rather than moral blameworthiness (strict liability for murder)

**Argument 2: Agency Theory — "Progressive vs. Regressive" (*Canola* Majority)**
- **Core rule:** Felon liable ONLY if killing done by felon or accomplice — NOT liable if victim/police/third party does the killing
- **Magic language from *Canola*:** *"Most modern progressive thought in criminal jurisprudence favors restriction rather than expansion of the felony-murder rule"*
- **Second key quote:** *"It appears to us regressive to extend the application of the felony-murder rule to lethal acts of third persons not in furtherance of the felonious scheme"*
- **Rationales:** 
  - Victim's defensive killing is **not "in furtherance"** of the felony — it's in opposition to it
  - When victim kills co-felon, that's a **justifiable/lawful homicide** — shouldn't create criminal liability for survivors
  - Defendant didn't pull the trigger → first-degree murder is grossly disproportionate to moral culpability
- **Third quote:** *"Tort concepts of foreseeability and proximate cause have shallow relevance to culpability for murder in the first degree"*
- **Why tort principles don't fit:** Proximate cause is about compensating victims in civil law; it's a poor fit for determining who gets life imprisonment
- **Proportionality:** *"Gradations of criminal liability should accord with [the] degree of moral culpability for the actor's conduct"*

**Argument 3: Time/Distance Unforeseeability (Baxter Case from Stillman)**
- Extreme example: Defendant miles away, in handcuffs when co-defendant causes death during police chase
- Even if statute says "during the felony," there must be baseline causal connection/foreseeability
- Breaking into cars ≠ knowing co-defendant will later engage in police chase → too attenuated
- Defense can argue police shouldn't have initiated chase (policy violation) → breaks causal chain

**Argument 4: MPC Middle Ground (Rebuttable Presumption)**
- Under MPC §210.2(1)(b), defendant can rebut presumption they acted with extreme indifference to human life
- Not automatic felony murder — allows individualized assessment
- More defensible than common-law strict liability while still deterring dangerous felonies
- Example: used toy gun, took precautions, victim had rare preexisting condition → rebut presumption

---

## 5. POLICY HOOK (1 sentence)

Felony murder is criticized as strict-liability murder that can impose life sentences on non-killers and drive plea bargaining (Stillman; Adnan Khan materials), but defenders argue felons create the lethal risk and should bear responsibility — with MPC’s rebuttable presumption as a middle ground.

## 6. PAST OUTLINE REFERENCE

**Past outline:** `Crim_Spring 2025_Harcourt_Full.docx.md`  
**Topic in INDEX:** "Homicide → Felony Murder"  
**Location:** Lines ~1688-1900 (approximate — search for "## Felony Murder" or "Canola")

**Key outline points:**
- Agency theory (majority) vs proximate cause theory (minority) — who did the killing?
- *Stamp* strict liability vs *Serné* skepticism about overbreadth
- *Canola* agency rule: Not liable when victim kills co-felon
- Stillman article: felony murder as plea leverage / mass incarceration / racial disparity; defendants who didn’t kill or intend to kill
- Harcourt frame: felony murder as “social order” doctrine (hidden moral judgments; class/race)
- Coke footnote in *Serné*: accidental killing while trespassing can flip into felony murder (property/class signal)
- MPC §210.2(1)(b) presumption more defensible than strict liability
- Exam tip: Argue both agency/proximate cause; apply common law AND MPC

**In-class lookup strategy:** Keep past outline open, CTRL+F for "felony murder" or "agency" when called on
