### CASE BRIEFS — Quick Reference

| Case | Dispute | Rule Applied | Who Won |
|------|---------|--------------|---------|
| **People v. Acosta** (Cal. Ct. App. 1991) | Defendant liable for deaths when two police helicopters collided during high-speed chase? | Proximate cause established: but-for cause + substantial factor + "highly extraordinary result" test. Majority: foreseeable risk that participants act recklessly in pursuit. But implied malice failed—no evidence defendant consciously disregarded risk to pilots. | Defendant (conviction reversed on malice) |
| **People v. Arzon** (NY Sup. Ct. 1978) | Defendant liable when firefighter died from separate fire while responding to defendant's fire? | "Indispensable link" + "zone of vulnerability": defendant's 5th-floor fire placed firefighter in dangerous position even though 2nd-floor fire (not defendant's) caused death. Intervening cause doesn't break chain when defendant created vulnerable situation. | Prosecution (motion to dismiss denied) |

### Detailed Case Analysis

**People v. Acosta** (Cal. Ct. App. 1991)

**Facts:** Acosta fled police in stolen vehicle, leading officers on 48-mile reckless chase through Orange County. He ran stop signs, red lights, drove wrong way on streets. Four police helicopters (Anaheim, Costa Mesa, Huntington Beach, Newport Beach) tracked from air. Costa Mesa and Newport Beach helicopters collided midair, killing 3 occupants in Costa Mesa helicopter. FAA expert testified Costa Mesa pilot violated regulations; expert had never heard of midair collision between police helicopters in pursuit before. Charged with three counts of 2nd-degree murder.

**Proximate Cause Analysis:**
1. **Actual cause (but-for):** YES—helicopters dispatched only because of chase
2. **Intended consequence?** NO—collision not intended
3. **Substantial factor?** YES—defendant's conduct placed helicopters in dangerous situation
4. **Highly extraordinary result?**
   - **MAJORITY:** NO—"possible consequence which reasonably might have been contemplated"; "appreciable probability" that participants may act recklessly/negligently in heat of pursuit to apprehend fleeing suspect
   - **DISSENT (Crosby):** YES—helicopters not in "zone of danger" created by ground pursuit; manner/circumstances of collision "highly extraordinary result" beyond reach of criminal culpability

**Implied Malice:** REVERSED—no evidence Acosta consciously disregarded risk to helicopter pilots. High risk to people on ground, but only minimal risk to pilots in air. Defendant's driving didn't affect helicopters' pursuit or pilots' flying.

**Outcome:** Conviction reversed—proximate cause arguably satisfied but implied malice element failed.

**People v. Arzon** (NY Sup. Ct. 1978)

**Facts:** Arzon intentionally set fire to couch on 5th floor of abandoned building. FDNY responded but couldn't control fire. While two firefighters attempted to evacuate, they encountered thick smoke later determined to come from **separate fire on 2nd floor** (no evidence Arzon set it). One firefighter sustained injuries from smoke and died. Charged with 3rd-degree arson and 2nd-degree murder (depraved indifference). Arzon moved to dismiss—argued no causal link between his fire and firefighter's death.

**Causation Test:**
1. **Sufficiently direct cause:** Harm need not be directly intended, but must be "reasonably foreseen as being reasonably related" to defendant's acts
2. **"Indispensable link" test:** Defendant's conduct must "forge a link in the chain of causes which actually brought about the death" (*People v. Stewart*)
3. **Zone of vulnerability:** Even if independent intervening force exists, defendant liable if his acts placed victim in position of particular vulnerability to that force

**Application:**
- 5th-floor fire continued burning out of control, blocked access routes, created evacuation emergency
- Arzon's fire was "indispensable link" in chain of events—placed firefighters in building in dangerous evacuation scenario
- Firefighter responding to Arzon's fire = foreseeable victim
- Second fire doesn't break causal chain because Arzon's fire created the vulnerable situation

**Distinguished Cases:**
- *People v. Kibbe*: Defendants robbed victim, left him roadside in freezing cold without shoes/glasses; victim killed by passing truck—causal connection upheld
- *People v. Stewart*: Victim stabbed, taken to ER, surgeon performed unrelated hernia operation, victim died—causal connection broken because hernia operation was superseding cause

**Outcome:** Motion to dismiss DENIED—sufficient evidence of causal connection to support 2nd-degree murder charge.

## 2. STATUTE / RULE (Core text to have ready)

**MPC § 2.03 — Causal Relationship Between Conduct and Result:**

> (1) Conduct is the cause of a result when:
> (a) it is an antecedent but for which the result in question would not have occurred; and
> (b) the relationship between the conduct and result satisfies any additional causal requirements imposed by the Code or by the law defining the offense.
>
> (2) When purposely or knowingly causing a particular result is an element of an offense, the element is not established if the actual result is not within the purpose or the contemplation of the actor unless:
> (a) the actual result differs from that designed or contemplated, as the case may be, only in the respect that a different person or different property is injured or affected or that the injury or harm designed or contemplated would have been more serious or more extensive than that caused; or
> (b) the actual result involves the same kind of injury or harm as that designed or contemplated and is not too remote or accidental in its occurrence to have a [just] bearing on the actor's liability or on the gravity of his offense.

**Key language:** "but for" (factual cause) + "too remote or accidental" (proximate cause)

**Two-Part Test:**

1. **Factual Cause:** But-for test (sine qua non)
2. **Proximate Cause:** Result not "too remote or accidental" / result is "foreseeable"

**Source:** MPC § 2.03, KSSB10 pp. 603-614

## 3. PROSECUTION ARGUMENTS 

**What would prosecution argue?**

**Argument 1: But-For Cause Established**

- Defendant's conduct was the factual cause (sine qua non) — without the police chase in Acosta, helicopters would never have collided.
- Key phrase: "But for the defendant's conduct, would the harm have occurred?"
- Why it works: Factual causation is usually easy to establish; very broad net.

**Argument 2: Result Was Foreseeable**

- A reasonable person could foresee that high-speed chase would create risk of serious harm (helicopter collision is within the general category of foreseeable harms).
- In Arzon, firefighter death from second fire is foreseeable consequence of setting a building ablaze.
- Key phrase: "Foreseeable risk" or "within the scope of the risk created."
- Why it works: Proximate cause doesn't require exact sequence be predicted, just general type of harm.

**Argument 3: Intervening Cause Not Superseding**

- Even if another cause contributed (second fire in Arzon, pilot error in Acosta), defendant's conduct was still a substantial factor.
- Independent intervening causes don't break the chain if original conduct created the dangerous situation.
- Why it works: Defendant set the harm in motion; shouldn't escape liability due to contribution by others.

## 4. DEFENSE ARGUMENTS

**What would defense counsel respond?**

**Argument 1: Result Too Remote or Accidental**

- Helicopter collision in Acosta is a "highly extraordinary result" — not the natural and probable consequence of fleeing police.
- Key phrase: "Too remote or accidental in its occurrence" (MPC § 2.03(2)(b)) or "highly extraordinary result" (common law).
- Why it works: Proximate cause requires some limit; otherwise, causation extends infinitely.

**Argument 2: Intervening Cause Was Superseding**

- The real cause was pilot error (Acosta) or the second arsonist (Arzon).
- Defendant's conduct may have been a but-for cause, but independent intervening act breaks the causal chain.
- Why it works: Criminal law traditionally recognizes superseding causes as cutting off liability.

**Argument 3: Insufficient Connection to Defendant's Mens Rea**

- Under MPC § 2.03(2), when defendant acts purposely or knowingly, actual result must be within contemplation.
- Defendant didn't contemplate helicopter collision or second fire — these are outside the scope of the intended/known risk.
- Why it works: Causation doctrine must link to defendant's mental state; can't impose strict liability for every consequence.

## 5. POLICY HOOK (1 sentence)

**"What's the policy concern here?":**

The tension is between holding defendants responsible for all harms they factually cause vs. limiting liability to foreseeable consequences, balancing deterrence against fairness.

## 6. PAST OUTLINE REFERENCE

**From:** Harcourt_Condesned Crim Outline.docx.md

**Key points professor might expect:**

- Two-part causation test: factual (but-for) and proximate (foreseeability/not too remote)
- "Highly extraordinary result" language from Acosta
- MPC § 2.03 has different standards for purpose/knowledge vs. recklessness/negligence
- Connection to time-framing (Kelman): how broadly we frame defendant's conduct affects causation analysis

## AGENT NOTES (for future reference)

**What worked:**

- Focused on MPC § 2.03 as core statute
- Identified foreseeability as key battleground for proximate cause

**What didn't work:**

- N/A

**Time spent:** 15 minutes
