# Prep Packet — Class #3 — 2026-01-23 — Mens Rea

## QUICK NAVIGATION

- Book navigation (casebook + MPC + supplements)
- MPC §2.02 (verbatim) + parsing plan
- Definitions to have ready: conduct / element / material element (MPC §1.13)
- Statute modeling system (syllabus Q1–2)
- Balkin: recurring argument pairs (syllabus Q4)
- Case cards: *Cunningham*, *Faulkner*, *Hazelwood*, *Santillanes*, *Elonis*
- Cold-call scripts (prosecution/defense)

## 0) Outcome Targets (5 minutes)

- By the end of prep, I can: (1) define and distinguish the four MPC mental states (Purposely, Knowingly, Recklessly, Negligently); (2) apply the MPC §2.02(3) default rule and §2.02(4) distribution rule; (3) explain *Cunningham*/*Faulkner* as moves toward element‑specific, subjective culpability; (4) distinguish ordinary negligence (*Hazelwood*) from criminal negligence (*Santillanes*) and argue which standard should apply; (5) model a statute cleanly (conduct / attendant circumstances / result + mens rea per material element); (6) generate both sides’ arguments using Balkin-style recurring pairs and Kelman-style framing moves.

## 1) Assignment Snapshot

- **Syllabus extract**: `01_SOURCES/syllabus/assignments/2026-01-23_class03.md`
- **Reading triage** (Harcourt):
  - **MPC §2.02**: **CRITICAL**. Read word-for-word multiple times. This is the engine of the course.
  - **Supp. Balkin**: Read pages 2-13 carefully. Understand the "opposing pairs" concept.
  - **Cases**: *Cunningham* & *Faulkner* (foundational subjective mens rea); *Elonis* (modern statutory interpretation/subjectivity); *Hazelwood* & *Santillanes* (negligence line-drawing).

**Syllabus prompts (Harcourt is likely to ask these explicitly):**
1. Model how act requirements, mens rea, and attendant circumstances interact (build a system).
2. Use MPC default rules to handle gaps/silences/ambiguities.
3. Argue both sides; connect to Kelman frames/interpretive constructs where possible.
4. Start an inventory of recurring legal arguments; use Balkin to systematize them.

## 2) Book Navigation (in-class)

- **Casebook**:
  - KSSB10 258–267: *Cunningham*; *Faulkner*
  - KSSB10 268–278: *Hazelwood*; *Santillanes*; *Elonis*
  - MPC appendix: **MPC §2.02** (Harcourt will call on you to read subsections out loud)
- **Backups in this repo**:
  - MPC text: `01_SOURCES/past_outlines/MPC Supplement.docx.md` (search: `§ 2.02 General Requirements of Culpability`)
  - Elonis supplement: `01_SOURCES/readings/02_elements/Elonis v. US.pdf`
  - Balkin supplement: `01_SOURCES/readings/02_elements/Balkin Crystalline Structure.pdf`
- **Ctrl+F triggers Harcourt will press**:
  - `material element`, `without distinguishing`, `contrary purpose plainly appears`
  - `practically certain`, `consciously disregards`, `should be aware`
  - `high probability`, `wilfully`, `lowest for which`

## 3) MPC Parsing Sheet (primary)

### MPC § 2.02 — General Requirements of Culpability

**MPC §2.02 text (verbatim) — keep this open for class**  
Source: `01_SOURCES/past_outlines/MPC Supplement.docx.md`

```text
(1) Minimum Requirements of Culpability. Except as provided in Section 2.05, a person is not guilty of an offense unless he acted purposely, knowingly, recklessly or negligently, as the law may require, with respect to each material element of the offense.

(2) Kinds of Culpability Defined.

(a) Purposely:
A person acts purposely with respect to a material element of an offense when:
  (i) if the element involves the nature of his conduct or a result thereof, it is his conscious object to engage in conduct of that nature or to cause such a result; and
  (ii) if the element involves the attendant circumstances, he is aware of the existence of such circumstances or he believes or hopes that they exist.

(b) Knowingly.
A person acts knowingly with respect to a material element of an offense when:
  (i) if the element involves the nature of his conduct or the attendant circumstances, he is aware that his conduct is of that nature or that such circumstances exist; and
  (ii) if the element involves a result of his conduct, he is aware that it is practically certain that his conduct will cause such a result.

(c) Recklessly.
A person acts recklessly with respect to a material element of an offense when he consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct. The risk must be of such a nature and degree that, considering the nature and purpose of the actor's conduct and the circumstances known to him, its disregard involves a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a law-abiding person would observe in the actor's situation.

(d) Negligently.
A person acts negligently with respect to a material element of an offense when he should be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct. The risk must be of such a nature and degree that the actor's failure to perceive it, considering the nature and purpose of his conduct and the circumstances known to him, involves a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the actor's situation.

(3) Culpability Required Unless Otherwise Provided. When the culpability sufficient to establish a material element of an offense is not prescribed by law, such element is established if a person acts purposely, knowingly or recklessly with respect thereto.

(4) Prescribed Culpability Requirement Applies to All Material Elements. When the law defining an offense prescribes the kind of culpability that is sufficient for the commission of an offense, without distinguishing among the material elements thereof, such provision shall apply to all the material elements of the offense, unless a contrary purpose plainly appears.

(5) Substitutes for Negligence, Recklessness and Knowledge. When the law provides that negligence suffices to establish an element of an offense, such element also is established if a person acts purposely, knowingly or recklessly. When recklessness suffices to establish an element, such element also is established if a person acts purposely or knowingly. When acting knowingly suffices to establish an element, such element also is established if a person acts purposely.

(6) Requirement of Purpose Satisfied if Purpose Is Conditional. When a particular purpose is an element of an offense, the element is established although such purpose is conditional, unless the condition negatives the harm or evil sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense.

(7) Requirement of Knowledge Satisfied by Knowledge of High Probability. When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge is established if a person is aware of a high probability of its existence, unless he actually believes that it does not exist.

(8) Requirement of Wilfulness Satisfied by Acting Knowingly. A requirement that an offense be committed wilfully is satisfied if a person acts knowingly with respect to the material elements of the offense, unless a purpose to impose further requirements appears.

(9) Culpability as to Illegality of Conduct. Neither knowledge nor recklessness or negligence as to whether conduct constitutes an offense or as to the existence, meaning or application of the law determining the elements of an offense is an element of such offense, unless the definition of the offense or the Code so provides.

(10) Culpability as Determinant of Grade of Offense. When the grade or degree of an offense depends on whether the offense is committed purposely, knowingly, recklessly or negligently, its grade or degree shall be the lowest for which the determinative kind of culpability is established with respect to any material element of the offense.
```

**Attack plan (what Harcourt will force you to do):**
1. Identify the statute’s elements (conduct / attendant circumstances / result).
2. Identify which are **material**.
3. Attach mens rea **element-by-element**.
4. If mens rea word appears once, apply §2.02(4) (unless “contrary purpose plainly appears”).
5. If silence, apply §2.02(3) (recklessness floor).
6. If the case talks in old common-law words (“malice,” “willful”), translate using §2.02(2) and §2.02(8).

## 4) Definitions to have ready (MPC §1.13)

Source: `01_SOURCES/past_outlines/MPC Supplement.docx.md`

```text
(5) "conduct" means an action or omission and its accompanying state of mind, or, where relevant, a series of acts and omissions;

(9) "element of an offense" means (i) such conduct or (ii) such attendant circumstances or (iii) such a result of conduct as
  (a) is included in the description of the forbidden conduct in the definition of the offense; or
  (b) establishes the required kind of culpability; or
  (c) negatives an excuse or justification for such conduct; or
  (d) negatives a defense under the statute of limitations; or
  (e) establishes jurisdiction or venue;

(10) "material element of an offense" means an element that does not relate exclusively to the statute of limitations, jurisdiction, venue or to any other matter similarly unconnected with (i) the harm or evil, incident to conduct, sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense, or (ii) the existence of a justification or excuse for such conduct;
```

## 5) Statute Modeling System (syllabus Q1–2)

**Goal:** walk into class able to (a) *diagram* a statute on the fly and (b) argue mens rea distribution/default rules in-role.

### A. The “three buckets” model (elements)

Use MPC §1.13(9):
1. **Conduct** (the verb)
2. **Attendant circumstances** (facts that must exist when the conduct occurs)
3. **Result of conduct** (what must happen)

### B. The “mens rea map” (element-by-element)

1. List the elements in order.
2. Mark which ones are **material** (MPC §1.13(10)).
3. For each material element, write the required mens rea:
   - explicit mens rea word in statute; then apply §2.02(4) if needed
   - if silence, apply §2.02(3)

### C. Prosecution vs. defense scripts (what Harcourt will cold-call)

- **Prosecution script:** classify more facts as “attendant circumstance” or “result,” then push §2.02(4) distribution and a lower culpability threshold (recklessness / ordinary negligence where allowed).
- **Defense script:** classify the contested fact as a material attendant circumstance, then argue “contrary purpose plainly appears,” or insist on subjective awareness (recklessness/knowledge), or translate common-law words (“malice,” “willful”) upward.

### Mini-model to practice (30 seconds)

**Statute (toy):** “Whoever knowingly sells alcohol to a minor commits a felony.”
- Conduct: sells alcohol
- Attendant circumstance: buyer is a minor
- Mens rea word: knowingly
- Fight: does knowingly apply to “minor”?
  - Prosecution: §2.02(4) distributes unless contrary purpose plainly appears.
  - Defense: contrary purpose plainly appears (policy/structure/penalty), so knowledge applies only to selling, not age.

### Kelman-style framing move (syllabus Q3) — use on mens rea

**Hypo:** D handles a loaded gun while drunk; it discharges; V dies.
- **Narrow frame:** the discharge was accidental; at the moment of firing D lacked awareness → negligence (or no criminal homicide, depending on statute).
- **Broad frame:** the voluntary choice was handling a loaded gun while intoxicated; D knew (or consciously disregarded) the risk → recklessness.

## 6) Balkin: Recurring Argument Pairs (syllabus Q4)

### Jack Balkin: "The Crystalline Structure of Legal Thought"

**Working thesis for class:** legal argument is patterned. Courts and lawyers cycle through a small set of familiar moves. Your job is to deploy them fast and in-role.

**Argument pairs you can reuse in every mens rea fight:**
- **Subjective culpability vs. objective social protection**
- **Autonomy/fairness vs. deterrence/safety**
- **Rules/administrability vs. standards/context**
- **Textual fidelity vs. purpose/spirit**
- **Narrow framing vs. broad framing** (Kelman overlap)
- **Proportionality/stigma vs. regulatory enforcement**

**Translate into prosecution/defense one-liners:**
- **Defense:** criminal stigma requires subjective fault; ordinary negligence is too low.
- **Prosecution:** dangerous conduct can be deterred with objective standards; the point is prevention, not moral purity.

## 7) Minimal Case Cards (tertiary)

### Case: *Regina v. Cunningham* (1957)

- **Facts**: D ripped gas meter off wall to steal money; gas leaked into neighbor's house, poisoning her. Charged with "maliciously administering noxious thing."
- **Holding**: "Malice" does not mean "wickedness." It means (1) actual intention to do harm, or (2) recklessness (foresight of consequence). Remanded to see if he *foresaw* the risk.
- **MPC hook**: Defines **Recklessness** (conscious disregard). Rejects "general wickedness" in favor of element-specific mens rea.
- **Policy hook**: Shift from "moral guilt" (he's a thief, so he's guilty of everything) to "cognitive guilt" (did he think about *this* specific harm?).

### Case: *Regina v. Faulkner* (1877)

- **Facts**: Sailor stealing rum lights match, accidentally burns down ship. Convicted of arson.
- **Holding**: Conviction quashed. Intent to steal (felony) does not automatically transfer to intent to burn (arson). Needs specific mens rea for the burning.
- **MPC hook**: Rejection of "transferred intent" across different crimes. Mens rea must attach to the specific *result* element.
- **Policy hook**: Proportionality. Stealing rum is minor; burning ship is major. Shouldn't punish for major crime based on minor intent.

### Case: *State v. Hazelwood* (Alaska 1997)

- **Facts**: Oil tanker ran aground; ~11 million gallons spilled.
- **Statute**: Misdemeanor to negligently “discharge, cause to be discharged, or permit the discharge of petroleum … upon the waters or land of the state.”
- **Holding (as framed in past Harcourt outlines)**: ordinary civil negligence can satisfy the mens rea for this type of “negligent discharge” offense.
- **Fight Harcourt will stage**:
  - Prosecution: regulatory/public-welfare frame; ordinary negligence is enough to deter; actors are professionals.
  - Defense: criminal stigma/proportionality frame; require criminal negligence (gross deviation) at minimum.

### Case: *Elonis v. United States* (2015)

- **Facts**: D posted violent rap lyrics on Facebook about wife/FBI. Charged with "transmitting threat." Issue: Is "threat" measured objectively (reasonable person feels threatened) or subjectively (D intended to threaten)?
- **Holding**: Court reads in a *mens rea* requirement. Negligence (reasonable person) is not enough for criminal liability in this statute. Must show D *intended* to threaten or knew/recklessly disregarded the risk.
- **MPC hook**: §2.02(3) default rule (usually recklessness). Court avoids constitutional issue by using statutory interpretation.
- **Policy hook**: Free speech vs. Safety. Subjective standard protects speech (Balkin: Individualism). Objective standard protects victims (Balkin: Communalism).

### Case: *Santillanes v. New Mexico* (1993)

- **Facts**: D's nephew cut neck on glass while D was "disciplining" him. Statute: "Child abuse = negligently causing..."
- **Holding**: "Negligence" in criminal statute means *criminal negligence* (MPC Recklessness/Gross Negligence), not *civil negligence* (simple failure of care).
- **MPC hook**: The gap between Civil Negligence (tort) and Criminal Negligence (MPC §2.02(2)(d) - "gross deviation").
- **Policy hook**: Stigma of criminal law requires higher culpability threshold than torts.

## 8) Cold Call / Co‑Counsel Script (2 minutes)

**If called on MPC §2.02 Definitions:**

- **Purpose**: "Conscious object." I *want* it to happen.
- **Knowledge**: "Practical certainty." I know it *will* happen, even if I don't care.
- **Recklessness**: "Conscious disregard." I know it *might* happen (substantial risk), and I do it anyway. (Subjective awareness).
- **Negligence**: "Should have known." I didn't know, but a reasonable person would have. (Objective failure).

**If called on the "Default Rules":**

- **Silence**: If the statute is silent, §2.02(3) sets the floor at **Recklessness** for each material element.
- **Distribution**: If the law prescribes one mens rea without distinguishing elements, §2.02(4) distributes it to all material elements unless a contrary purpose plainly appears.

**If called on “ordinary negligence vs criminal negligence”:**
- **Prosecution:** “This is a regulatory harms-prevention statute; ordinary negligence is enough (*Hazelwood*).”
- **Defense:** “Criminal liability needs a culpability threshold that matches stigma; read ‘negligence’ as criminal negligence (*Santillanes*).”

**If called on *Cunningham* / *Faulkner*:**

- **Core Principle**: Mens rea is element-specific. You can't just be "generally bad" (stealing rum/gas meter) and be liable for all consequences. You must have the requisite mental state for the *specific* harm (burning ship/poisoning).
- **Shift**: Moves from "offense analysis" (he's a criminal) to "element analysis" (did he foresee *this* result?).

**If called on Balkin (inventory of arguments):**
- Give the pair. Pick a side. State the payoff.
  - “Subjective fault protects autonomy; objective standards protect safety.”
  - “Rules are predictable; standards track fairness in hard cases.”

## 9) Predictions (explicit + falsifiable)

- **Likely covered in class**:

  - **The grid**: Harcourt draws the 4 mental states and drills the difference between knowledge vs. recklessness and recklessness vs. negligence.
  - **Statute modeling**: he makes someone “model” a statute (conduct/circumstance/result) and then distribute mens rea (§2.02(4)).
  - **Negligence fight**: *Hazelwood* vs. *Santillanes* as “ordinary” vs “criminal” negligence and which frame is legitimate.
  - **Elonis**: silence in statute → interpret mens rea in; negligence disfavored; open question between recklessness vs knowledge.
  - **Balkin inventory**: he asks for recurring argument pairs and forces you to generate both sides.
- **Likely skipped**:

  - Deep factual rabbit holes; focus will be on element modeling and argument structure.
- **Likely cold-call targets**:

  - "Define Recklessness vs. Negligence." (The key difference is *awareness*).
  - "Does 'Knowingly' apply to the age of the victim in this statute?" (Testing §2.02(4)).
  - "What does ‘contrary purpose plainly appears’ mean?" (when to stop distribution).

## 10) TA / Office Hours Questions (if any)

- Does the "gross deviation" standard in Recklessness/Negligence effectively import an objective standard into Recklessness? (i.e., the *risk* must be objectively unjustifiable).
- How does "Willful Blindness" fit into Knowledge under the MPC? (MPC §2.02(7) - high probability = knowledge).
- When should a court treat “negligence” in a statute as ordinary negligence vs. criminal negligence? What variables should control (penalty, stigma, regulatory context, licensing, typical actor)?
