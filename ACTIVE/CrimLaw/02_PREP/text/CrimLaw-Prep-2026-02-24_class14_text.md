## 1. CASES FOR TODAY

**Purpose:** Watch Quimbee videos for these cases (include court/year to disambiguate)

### A. Background - Constitutionality of Death Penalty

- **Furman v. Georgia (U.S. Supreme Court, 1972)** — KSSB10 pp. 552-573 (referenced in Gregg)
  - *Quimbee search:* "Furman v. Georgia 1972"
  - Topic: Death penalty **as administered** violated 8th Amendment — inflicted in arbitrary and capricious manner
  - Per curiam decision, 5-4, each justice wrote separately
  - Two justices (Brennan, Marshall) found all capital punishment unconstitutional
  - Others focused on arbitrariness, randomness, infrequency, discriminatory administration

- **Gregg v. Georgia (U.S. Supreme Court, 1976)** — KSSB10 pp. 565-573
  - *Quimbee search:* "Gregg v. Georgia 1976"
  - Topic: Death penalty **with guided discretion** does NOT violate 8th Amendment
  - Georgia's bifurcated trial system with aggravating/mitigating circumstances upheld
  - Plurality opinion by Stewart, Powell, Stevens
  - Establishes framework for constitutional capital punishment

### B. Modern Jurisprudence

- **Atkins v. Virginia (U.S. Supreme Court, 2002)** — KSSB10 pp. 580-585
  - *Quimbee search:* "Atkins v. Virginia 2002"
  - Topic: Execution of intellectually disabled persons violates 8th Amendment
  - "Evolving standards of decency" test — national consensus against executing intellectually disabled
  - Intellectually disabled defendants have diminished culpability
  - Execution does not serve retribution or deterrence purposes for this class

## 1.2. SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS (policy / theory)

- **Steiker & Steiker, "Sober Second Thoughts: Reflections on Two Decades of Constitutional Regulation of Capital Punishment"** (109 Harv. L. Rev. 355 (1995))
  - Local copy: `01_SOURCES/readings/06_capital_punishment/Steiker+and+Steiker,+Sober+Second+Thoughts.txt`
  - Topic: Supreme Court's death penalty jurisprudence has **failed** to rationalize capital punishment and may have **legitimated** it
  - Key argument: Court's regulation created illusion of fairness without actual reform
  - Tension between narrowing (who is death-eligible) and individualization (consider all mitigating evidence)
  - Result: Return to pre-Furman arbitrariness

- **Memo introducing David Wilson (on Courseworks)**
  - Context: Wilson was on death row in Pennsylvania, case shows modern death penalty in practice

## 1.5. CASE BRIEFS (Quick facts/reasoning/holding)

### **Furman v. Georgia (1972):**
- **Issue:** Does the death penalty, as administered, violate the 8th Amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment?
- **Facts:** Three consolidated cases — Furman convicted of murder, Jackson and Branch convicted of rape. All sentenced to death. Petitioners argued death penalty violated 8th and 14th Amendments.
- **Procedural History:** Georgia Supreme Court affirmed all three convictions and sentences.
- **Rule/Reasoning (5-4 per curiam, each justice wrote separately):**
  - **Douglas:** Death penalty applied discriminatorily — statutes give unbridled discretion to juries, resulting in sentencing based on race and class.
  - **Brennan:** Death penalty is inherently cruel and unusual — fails four principles: (1) must not degrade human dignity, (2) must not be inflicted arbitrarily, (3) must not be unacceptable to contemporary society, (4) must not be excessive (disproportionate to crime or unnecessary to achieve legitimate goals).
  - **Stewart:** Death penalty imposed so infrequently and randomly that it is "cruel and unusual in the same way that being struck by lightning is cruel and unusual."
  - **White:** Death penalty imposed so infrequently it cannot serve purposes of deterrence or retribution — too random to be useful.
  - **Marshall:** Death penalty violates 8th Amendment in all circumstances — informed citizenry would find it "shocking, unjust, and unacceptable."
  - **Dissent (Burger, Blackmun, Powell, Rehnquist):** Death penalty has long tradition in American law; courts should defer to legislative judgment; procedural reforms (not abolition) are appropriate remedy.
- **Holding:** Death penalty statutes that give unbridled discretion to juries/judges violate 8th Amendment — death penalty **as then administered** is unconstitutional.
- **Impact:** Effectively commuted 629 death sentences nationwide; states responded by enacting new statutes with guided discretion or mandatory death penalty.

### **Gregg v. Georgia (1976):**
- **Issue:** Does Georgia's revised death penalty statute, which provides guided discretion through aggravating/mitigating circumstances, violate the 8th Amendment?
- **Facts:** Gregg convicted of armed robbery and murder. Under Georgia's **bifurcated trial** system: (1) guilt phase, (2) separate sentencing phase where jury must find at least one statutory aggravating circumstance and weigh aggravating vs. mitigating circumstances. Jury found two aggravating circumstances (murder during armed robbery; murder for pecuniary gain). Gregg sentenced to death.
- **Georgia's Statutory Scheme (Pyramid Structure):**
  1. **Capital offense conviction** (murder with specific circumstances)
  2. **Aggravating circumstances** — jury must find at least one from statutory list (e.g., murder during felony, murder for hire, heinous/cruel murder)
  3. **Weighing** — jury weighs aggravating vs. mitigating circumstances
  4. **Automatic appellate review** — Georgia Supreme Court reviews proportionality
- **Rule/Reasoning (Plurality: Stewart, Powell, Stevens):**
  - **Death penalty is not per se unconstitutional:** Consistent with history, contemporary values, and serves legitimate penological purposes (retribution and deterrence).
  - **Furman's core concern was arbitrariness:** Must channel discretion through objective standards.
  - **Georgia statute addresses Furman's concerns:**
    - **Narrowing function:** Aggravating circumstances limit death penalty to "worst of the worst" offenders.
    - **Guided discretion:** Specific standards for jury to follow.
    - **Consideration of individual circumstances:** Jury can consider any mitigating evidence.
    - **Proportionality review:** Automatic appellate review prevents arbitrary sentencing.
  - **Theories of punishment support death penalty:**
    - **Retribution:** Society's moral outrage at particularly heinous crimes justifies death penalty. Not merely revenge — reflects community's belief that certain crimes deserve ultimate punishment.
    - **Deterrence:** Death penalty may deter some rational actors (though evidence is inconclusive). Legislative judgment entitled to deference.
- **Holding:** Georgia's guided discretion statute is constitutional — provides sufficient safeguards against arbitrary and capricious sentencing.
- **Concurrence (White, joined by Burger, Rehnquist):** Georgia statute adequately responds to Furman by narrowing class of death-eligible defendants and requiring findings to support death sentence.
- **Concurrence (Blackmun):** Reluctantly accepts that Constitution permits death penalty, though has personal reservations.
- **Dissent (Brennan, Marshall):** Death penalty is unconstitutional in all circumstances (same position as in Furman).
- **Companion Cases Decided Same Day:**
  - **Proffitt v. Florida:** Florida's weighing statute upheld.
  - **Jurek v. Texas:** Texas's special questions statute upheld.
  - **Woodson v. North Carolina:** **Mandatory death penalty** struck down — violates 8th Amendment by removing all discretion and failing to consider individual circumstances.
  - **Roberts v. Louisiana:** Mandatory death penalty for specific murders struck down.

**Three Post-Furman Statutory Schemes:**

1. **Pyramid Statutes (Georgia model):**
   - Capital offense conviction → aggravating circumstances → jury discretion to impose death
   - Risk: Little real narrowing if aggravating circumstances overlap with capital offense definition

2. **Weighing Statutes (Alabama, Florida models):**
   - Jury weighs aggravating vs. mitigating circumstances
   - Cannot simply count — must assess relative weight
   - Death penalty only if aggravating circumstances outweigh mitigating

3. **Special Questions Statutes (Texas model):**
   - Jury answers specific questions (deliberateness, future dangerousness, provocation reasonableness)
   - If "yes" to all questions → death penalty
   - Texas later added fourth question about mitigating evidence

### **Atkins v. Virginia (2002):**
- **Issue:** Does execution of intellectually disabled persons violate the 8th Amendment?
- **Facts:** Atkins convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. Evidence showed he had IQ of 59 (intellectually disabled). Virginia Supreme Court affirmed, rejecting argument that execution of intellectually disabled violates 8th Amendment.
- **Rule/Reasoning (Justice Stevens, 6-3):**
  - **8th Amendment prohibits "cruel and unusual punishments"** — must be interpreted according to "evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society."
  - **Test for "evolving standards":** Look to objective evidence of national consensus, plus Court's own judgment.
  - **National consensus exists against executing intellectually disabled:**
    - Since *Penry v. Lynaugh* (1989), 18 states banned execution of intellectually disabled (16 states + federal government already prohibited death penalty entirely).
    - Direction of change is more important than absolute numbers — strong legislative trend.
    - Very few executions of intellectually disabled persons even in states that permit it.
  - **Intellectually disabled have diminished culpability:**
    - Reduced capacity for moral reasoning and impulse control.
    - Less able to appreciate wrongfulness of conduct.
    - Less able to process information, communicate, learn from mistakes.
  - **Death penalty does not serve legitimate penological purposes for intellectually disabled:**
    - **Retribution:** Requires culpability proportionate to blameworthiness — intellectually disabled have diminished moral culpability.
    - **Deterrence:** Intellectually disabled less likely to engage in cost-benefit analysis; execution unlikely to deter them.
  - **Risk of wrongful execution:** Intellectually disabled more vulnerable to false confessions, less able to assist counsel, make poor witnesses.
- **Holding:** Execution of intellectually disabled persons violates 8th Amendment — national consensus and Court's own judgment support this conclusion.
- **Dissent (Scalia, joined by Rehnquist, Thomas):**
  - No real national consensus — only 18 of 38 death penalty states banned execution of intellectually disabled (less than half).
  - Plurality manipulates evidence to find consensus that doesn't exist.
  - "Evolving standards" test gives Court too much discretion to impose its own moral views.
  - States should decide this question, not federal courts.
  - Intellectually disabled can still have sufficient culpability for capital punishment (diminished capacity ≠ no capacity).
- **Note:** *Atkins* left to states the question of **how to define "intellectually disabled"** — led to litigation over IQ cutoffs, adaptive functioning tests, etc.

## 2. PRINCIPLES / RULES (Core doctrines)

### **A. Constitutional Framework for Death Penalty (Post-Gregg)**

**Core Principle:** Death penalty is constitutional **if** administered through procedures that minimize arbitrariness and ensure individualized consideration.

**Constitutional Requirements:**

**1. Procedural Due Process (14th Amendment)**
- Adequate notice of charges
- Fair trial procedures
- Effective assistance of counsel
- Appellate review

**2. Substantive 8th Amendment Limits**
- Must serve legitimate penological purpose (retribution and/or deterrence)
- Must not be "cruel and unusual" under "evolving standards of decency"
- Must not be imposed arbitrarily or capriciously
- Must be proportionate to offense

**Two Core Tensions in Death Penalty Law:**

**Tension #1: Narrowing vs. Individualization**
- **Narrowing requirement (from Furman):** Death penalty must be limited to "worst of the worst" through objective criteria (aggravating circumstances).
- **Individualization requirement (from Woodson, Lockett):** Sentencer must consider all relevant mitigating evidence about defendant's character and circumstances.
- **Problem:** These requirements work at cross-purposes. Narrowing seeks consistency through rules; individualization seeks mercy through discretion.

**Tension #2: Guided Discretion vs. Unbridled Discretion**
- **Furman forbids unbridled discretion** (leads to arbitrary, discriminatory sentencing)
- **But mandatory death penalty also unconstitutional** (Woodson) — must allow consideration of mitigating evidence
- **Solution:** "Guided discretion" statutes with aggravating/mitigating framework
- **Problem:** Discretion remains at multiple stages (prosecutor charging decisions, jury sentencing decisions) — impossible to eliminate entirely

---

### **B. Aggravating Circumstances (Narrowing Function)**

**Purpose:** Distinguish capital murder from ordinary murder — identify "worst of the worst" cases.

**Examples of Statutory Aggravating Circumstances:**
- Murder during commission of enumerated felonies (robbery, rape, burglary, kidnapping, arson)
- Murder of law enforcement officer, firefighter, judge, prosecutor
- Murder for hire (contract killing)
- Murder of multiple victims
- Especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel murder
- Prior convictions for violent felonies
- Created great risk of death to multiple persons

**Constitutional Limits on Aggravating Circumstances:**
- Must provide "principled way to distinguish" cases where death penalty is imposed from those where it is not
- Cannot be so vague as to give unbridled discretion (e.g., "heinous, atrocious, or cruel" requires narrowing construction)
- **Concern:** Many aggravating circumstances overlap with elements of capital murder — provides no real narrowing

**Proportionality Review:**
- Some states (like Georgia) require appellate review to ensure death penalty not disproportionate to similar cases
- Court has held proportionality review not constitutionally required (*Pulley v. Harris*, 1984)

---

### **C. Mitigating Circumstances (Individualization Function)**

**Purpose:** Allow defendant to present any evidence about character, background, or circumstances that might warrant leniency.

**Constitutional Rule (from *Lockett v. Ohio*, 1978):**
- States **cannot limit** types of mitigating evidence defendant can present
- Defendant has right to present **any** evidence that might call for sentence less than death
- Jury must be allowed to consider and give effect to all mitigating evidence

**Examples of Statutory Mitigating Circumstances:**
- No significant prior criminal history
- Extreme mental or emotional disturbance
- Victim was participant or consented
- Defendant acted under duress or domination of another
- Defendant's capacity to appreciate wrongfulness or conform conduct was impaired
- Age (youth or old age)
- Defendant's role as minor participant or accomplice

**Important:** These are just examples — defendant can present **any** mitigating evidence, even if not listed in statute.

**Problem:** Unlimited mitigating evidence + unbounded jury discretion = return to pre-Furman arbitrariness?

---

### **D. "Evolving Standards of Decency" (8th Amendment Test)**

**Core Principle:** 8th Amendment must be interpreted according to contemporary values, not frozen at 1791 meanings.

**Two-Part Test (*Atkins*, *Roper v. Simmons*):**

**1. Objective Evidence of National Consensus**
- State legislation (how many states prohibit the practice?)
- Direction of change (recent trend toward abolition?)
- Frequency of practice (how often is it actually used?)
- International opinion (relevant but not dispositive)

**2. Court's Own Judgment**
- Do characteristics of the class (intellectually disabled, juveniles, etc.) reduce culpability?
- Does execution serve legitimate penological purposes for this class?
  - **Retribution:** Is this class sufficiently culpable to deserve death?
  - **Deterrence:** Can this class be deterred by threat of death?
- Are there heightened risks of wrongful execution?

**Cases Applying "Evolving Standards":**
- **Atkins v. Virginia (2002):** Execution of intellectually disabled unconstitutional
- **Roper v. Simmons (2005):** Execution of juveniles (under 18) unconstitutional
- **Kennedy v. Louisiana (2008):** Death penalty for child rape (non-homicide) unconstitutional
- **Hall v. Florida (2014):** Florida's rigid IQ cutoff for determining intellectual disability unconstitutional

---

### **E. Race and the Death Penalty (McCleskey v. Kemp)**

**Facts:** *McCleskey v. Kemp* (1987) — Defendant presented Baldus study showing:
- Defendants charged with killing white victims **11 times more likely** to receive death penalty than defendants charged with killing black victims
- Black defendants who kill white victims **most likely** to receive death penalty
- Statistical evidence of racial disparities in Georgia death penalty system

**Holding:** Statistical evidence of racial disparities **insufficient** to prove 8th Amendment violation or equal protection violation.

**Reasoning:**
- To prove unconstitutional discrimination, must show **purposeful discrimination** in defendant's own case
- Statistical disparities alone do not prove discriminatory intent
- Discretion is essential to criminal justice system — cannot eliminate all risk of arbitrary or discriminatory application
- Accepting McCleskey's claim would open door to challenges throughout criminal justice system

**Dissent (Brennan, Marshall, Blackmun, Stevens):**
- Baldus study shows systemic racial bias in capital sentencing
- Death penalty different from other punishments — "death is different" principle requires heightened scrutiny
- Discretion that enables discrimination is not "essential" — is the very problem Furman sought to address
- Court's decision contradicts Gregg's promise to eliminate arbitrariness

**Significance:**
- Court tolerates racial disparities in death penalty as unavoidable consequence of discretionary system
- Death penalty's legitimacy depends on claim of rational, non-arbitrary administration — *McCleskey* undermines this claim
- Shows limits of constitutional regulation — Court unwilling to confront systemic racism in capital punishment

---

## 3. PROSECUTION ARGUMENTS (2-3 arguments)

### **On Death Penalty's Constitutionality (Post-Gregg Framework)**

**Argument 1: Death Penalty Serves Legitimate Retributive Purpose**
- Society's moral outrage at heinous murders justifies death penalty
- Retribution is not mere vengeance — it's society's expression that certain crimes deserve ultimate punishment
- Proportionality: Death for death is not disproportionate
- Capital punishment affirms value of innocent life by imposing harshest penalty for its deliberate taking
- Without death penalty, life sentence trivializes worst crimes — no penalty sufficiently expresses society's condemnation

**Argument 2: Guided Discretion Statutes Address Furman's Concerns About Arbitrariness**
- Aggravating circumstances provide objective standards — narrow death penalty to "worst of the worst"
- Bifurcated trial separates guilt/innocence from sentencing — ensures focus on defendant's culpability
- Proportionality review ensures consistency across cases
- Consideration of mitigating evidence ensures individualized justice
- Multiple layers of review (trial, automatic appellate review, state post-conviction, federal habeas) minimize risk of error

**Argument 3: Death Penalty Has Deterrent Effect (Utilitarian Justification)**
- Rational actors will be deterred by threat of death — capital punishment may deter some murders
- Even if empirical evidence is inconclusive, legislature's judgment is entitled to deference
- Better safe than sorry — if death penalty deters even one murder, it's worth it
- Incapacitation: Executed murderers cannot kill again (including killing in prison)

---

## 4. DEFENSE ARGUMENTS (2-3 arguments)

### **On Death Penalty's Unconstitutionality (Abolitionist Position)**

**Argument 1: Death Penalty Inevitably Arbitrary — Gregg's Promise of Rationality Has Failed**
- Steiker & Steiker critique: Two decades of regulation have failed to eliminate arbitrariness
- **Narrowing doesn't work:** Aggravating circumstances overlap with capital murder elements — nearly all capital murders are death-eligible (no real narrowing)
- **Individualization undermines consistency:** Unlimited mitigating evidence + jury discretion = return to pre-Furman arbitrariness
- **Discretion at every stage:** Prosecutor's charging decision, jury's sentencing decision, governor's clemency decision — impossible to eliminate discretion entirely
- Result: Death penalty still imposed in arbitrary, random manner ("lightning bolt" sentencing Stewart warned about in Furman)

**Argument 2: Death Penalty Applied in Racially Discriminatory Manner**
- *McCleskey* evidence shows systemic racial bias: race of victim predicts death sentence more than any other factor
- Black defendants who kill white victims most likely to be sentenced to death
- White defendants who kill black victims least likely to be sentenced to death
- Racial disparities cannot be explained by legitimate factors (heinousness of crime, criminal history)
- Court's tolerance of racial discrimination in *McCleskey* contradicts Gregg's promise of fair administration
- Death penalty reinforces racial hierarchy — modern form of lynching

**Argument 3: Death Penalty Does Not Serve Legitimate Penological Purposes (Fails Retribution and Deterrence)**
- **Retribution fails:** Many murderers have diminished culpability (mental illness, trauma, abuse) — not "worst of the worst"
- **Deterrence fails:** No reliable empirical evidence that death penalty deters murders better than life imprisonment
  - Most murders are not rationally calculated (crimes of passion, mental illness, impulsivity)
  - Murderers don't weigh costs/benefits of death vs. life sentence before killing
  - States with death penalty do not have lower murder rates than states without
- **Risk of wrongful execution:** Since 1973, over 180 death row inmates exonerated — how many innocent people have been executed?
- **Brutalization effect:** Death penalty may increase murder rate by legitimizing killing and devaluing life

**Argument 4: Death Penalty Has Been Legitimated, Not Rationalized (Steiker & Steiker Critique)**
- Court's complex regulation creates **illusion of fairness** without actual fairness
- **Internal legitimation:** Judges/juries feel less responsibility because they know decision will be reviewed — pass the buck
- **External legitimation:** Public believes system has "many levels of safeguards" so accepts executions as fair
- Supreme Court's jurisprudence has helped **stabilize and entrench** death penalty rather than abolish it
- Court acts as "house built by warring architects" — centrist justices pulled between abolitionist and retentionist wings, unable to choose coherent vision
- Result: Death penalty persists with veneer of constitutional legitimacy but without meaningful safeguards

---

## 5. POLICY HOOK (1-2 sentences)

The death penalty raises fundamental questions about the criminal justice system's legitimacy: Can capital punishment be administered fairly and rationally, or does it inevitably reflect the arbitrary and discriminatory impulses Furman condemned? Steiker & Steiker argue that two decades of Supreme Court regulation have failed to rationalize capital punishment and instead have **legitimated** an irredeemably flawed system — creating an illusion of fairness that masks persistent arbitrariness and racial bias.

---

## 6. HARCOURT CLASSROOM MOVES (What to expect)

**Theories of Punishment Application:**
- Expect detailed discussion of retribution vs. deterrence in Gregg plurality opinion
- "Does death penalty serve retribution? What does 'retribution' mean here?" (Is it just vengeance?)
- "If death penalty doesn't deter, should we abolish it? Or is retribution alone sufficient?"
- Compare Kant (death penalty required by retributive justice) vs. Bentham (death penalty unjustified unless it deters)

**Gregg's Framework:**
- "Does Georgia's statute actually narrow the class of death-eligible defendants? Or does it just restate capital murder elements?"
- Role-play prosecution/defense: "You're the prosecutor — which aggravating circumstances would you argue? Now you're defense counsel — what mitigating evidence would you present?"
- "Can you have both narrowing (consistency) AND individualization (mercy)? Or are these inherently contradictory?"

**Steiker & Steiker Critique:**
- He will likely assign his own students' article or discuss it extensively (Steiker clerked for Justice Marshall)
- "Has the Supreme Court succeeded in rationalizing death penalty? Or just legitimated it?"
- **Legitimation concept:** "How does appearance of fairness (bifurcated trial, aggravating circumstances, appellate review) make death penalty more palatable to public?"
- "If you were on the Court in 1976, would you vote to uphold death penalty in Gregg? What's your alternative?"

**Race and Death Penalty:**
- Expect discussion of *McCleskey* (not assigned but referenced in readings)
- "Baldus study shows race of victim is strongest predictor of death sentence — does this prove discrimination?"
- "Why did Court reject statistical evidence of discrimination? What kind of proof would be sufficient?"
- Critical theory lens: "How does death penalty entrench racial hierarchy? What is the through-line from slavery → lynching → capital punishment?"

**Atkins and "Evolving Standards":**
- "How do we determine 'evolving standards of decency'? Who decides?"
- "Should Court look to state legislation, international opinion, or its own judgment?"
- "Is 'evolving standards' test too subjective — letting Court impose its own values? Or appropriately flexible?"
- Apply Atkins framework to other groups: "Should we execute juveniles? Severely mentally ill?"

**Systemic Critique:**
- Connect to earlier themes: felony murder, status crimes, broken windows policing
- "How does capital punishment reflect and reinforce existing social order?"
- "Is death penalty reform possible? Or should we abolish it entirely?"
- "What would Bernard Harcourt say about death penalty? What about Foucault?"

## 7. PAST OUTLINE REFERENCE

**Past outline:** `Crim_Spring 2025_Harcourt_Full.docx.md`  
**Topic in INDEX:** "Capital Punishment" or "Homicide → Death Penalty"  
**Location:** Search for "Gregg" or "Atkins" or "death penalty" or "capital punishment"

**Key outline points:**
- Post-Furman statutory schemes: pyramid (Georgia), weighing (Alabama/Florida), special questions (Texas)
- Mandatory death penalty struck down in *Woodson* — must allow individualized consideration
- Aggravating circumstances narrow death-eligible class (in theory)
- Mitigating evidence cannot be limited — defendant can present any relevant evidence (*Lockett*)
- Tension between narrowing and individualization
- *Atkins*: execution of intellectually disabled violates 8th Amendment (evolving standards test)
- *McCleskey*: statistical evidence of racial bias insufficient to prove unconstitutional discrimination
- Steiker & Steiker critique: Court's regulation has legitimated death penalty without rationalizing it

**In-class lookup strategy:** Keep past outline open, CTRL+F for "Gregg" or "Atkins" or "death penalty" when called on. Note pyramid diagram if included.

## 8. EXAM TIPS

**Issue-Spotter Application:**

1. **Constitutional Challenges to Death Penalty Statute:** If question involves death penalty statute, analyze under Gregg framework:
   - Does statute narrow death-eligible class through aggravating circumstances?
   - Does statute allow consideration of all mitigating evidence?
   - Does statute provide guided discretion (not unbridled discretion, but also not mandatory)?
   - Is there appellate review?

2. **Aggravating Circumstances:** Identify statutory aggravating circumstances. Are they sufficiently specific? Or unconstitutionally vague?

3. **Mitigating Evidence:** Identify any evidence about defendant's character, background, circumstances that might warrant mercy. Remember: defendant can present **any** mitigating evidence (age, mental illness, abuse, remorse, family circumstances, etc.)

4. **Proportionality:** Is death penalty proportionate to offense? (Death penalty for non-homicide offenses likely unconstitutional after *Kennedy v. Louisiana*)

5. **"Evolving Standards" Challenges:** If question involves execution of particular class of defendants (intellectually disabled, juveniles, mentally ill):
   - Apply *Atkins* two-part test: (1) objective evidence of national consensus, (2) Court's own judgment
   - Does this class have diminished culpability?
   - Does execution serve retribution/deterrence for this class?

6. **Racial Discrimination Claims:** If facts suggest racial disparities:
   - Under *McCleskey*, statistical evidence alone insufficient — must prove purposeful discrimination in defendant's case
   - But can argue *McCleskey* was wrongly decided / should be overruled

**Policy Essay:**

- **Retribution vs. Deterrence:** Does death penalty serve these purposes? Empirical evidence on deterrence?
- **Arbitrariness:** Has Gregg framework succeeded in eliminating arbitrary sentencing? Or has it failed (Steiker critique)?
- **Race and Death Penalty:** Racial disparities in capital sentencing; *McCleskey*'s tolerance of systemic discrimination
- **Legitimation:** Does Court's regulation legitimate death penalty without actually rationalizing it?
- **Alternatives:** Abolition? Life without parole? More stringent narrowing requirements?
- **Connection to Course Themes:** How does death penalty reflect and entrench racial/social hierarchy? Is it modern form of lynching? (Connect to slave cases, *Goetz*, *McCleskey*)

**Harcourt's Preferences:**
- He values critical theory/Foucault lens — how punishment practices reflect power relations and entrench social order
- Emphasize Steiker & Steiker legitimation critique (Court's regulation makes death penalty seem fair without actually making it fair)
- Apply racial justice lens — death penalty as tool of racial subordination (lynching → capital punishment)
- Note failures of empirical claims (deterrence) — parallel to broken windows policing critique
- Connect to systemic themes throughout course — death penalty not isolated, but part of larger pattern of criminal law entrenching hierarchy

---

**REMEMBER FOR CLASS:**
- Watch Quimbee videos for Furman, Gregg, Atkins
- Read Gregg plurality opinion carefully — theories of punishment, aggravating/mitigating framework
- Understand three post-Furman statutory schemes (pyramid, weighing, special questions)
- Be ready to discuss Steiker & Steiker critique of legitimation
- Think about connection between death penalty and racial hierarchy (slave cases, lynching, McCleskey)
