## 1. CASES FOR TODAY

**Purpose:** Watch Quimbee videos for these cases (include court/year to disambiguate)

### A. Introduction and the Requirement of Legality

- **Keeler v. Superior Court (California Supreme Court, 1970)** — KSSB10 pp. 157-58 and 176-185
  - *Quimbee search:* "Keeler v. Superior Court California 1970"
  - Topic: Legality principle — statutory construction limits murder charge when fetus not "human being" under existing statute

- **Rogers v. Tennessee (U.S. Supreme Court, 2001)** — KSSB10 pp. 176-185
  - *Quimbee search:* "Rogers v. Tennessee 2001"
  - Topic: Due process/legality — judicial abolition of year-and-a-day rule upheld despite retroactive application

### B. The Ban on Status Crimes

- **Robinson v. California (U.S. Supreme Court, 1962)** — KSSB10 pp. 1072-1082
  - *Quimbee search:* "Robinson v. California 1962"
  - Topic: Criminalizing "status" of being addicted to narcotics violates Eighth Amendment (cruel and unusual punishment)

- **Powell v. Texas (U.S. Supreme Court, 1968)** — KSSB10 pp. 1072-1082
  - *Quimbee search:* "Powell v. Texas 1968"
  - Topic: Public intoxication NOT a status crime — involves voluntary act (being in public while drunk)

- **City of Grants Pass v. Johnson (U.S. Supreme Court, 2024)** — Supplemental
  - Topic: Camping bans can be enforced even when insufficient shelter available — doesn't violate Eighth Amendment

## 1.2. SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS (policy / institutions)

- **Supp. Brief in Tomlin v. Patterson (SDAL 2016)**
  - Local copy: `01_SOURCES/readings/05_constitutional_limits/Tomlin Brief Excerpt on Fair Notice.txt`
  - Topic: Fair notice requirement under legality principle
  - Connection to *Keeler*: defendant cannot be convicted under statute unless reasonable person would understand conduct is prohibited

---

## 1.5. CASE BRIEFS (Quick facts/reasoning/holding)

### **Keeler v. Superior Court (1970):**
- **Issue:** Can defendant be charged with murder for killing a fetus when the murder statute defined victim as "human being"?
- **Facts:** D attacked his pregnant ex-wife, causing death of viable fetus (8 months); fetus was "viable" but not yet born.
- **Rule/Reasoning:** 
  - California murder statute required death of "human being"
  - At common law and when statute enacted (1850), "human being" meant person "born alive"
  - Strict statutory construction required by legality principle — no fair notice that killing fetus = murder
  - Legislature (not courts) must expand criminal prohibitions to provide fair notice
- **Holding:** Murder charge dismissed; legislature subsequently amended statute to include fetuses.
- **Dissent (Mosk):** "Human being" could be interpreted to include viable fetus; no legality violation.

### **Rogers v. Tennessee (2001):**
- **Issue:** Does due process prohibit judicial abolition of year-and-a-day rule when applied retroactively to defendant?
- **Facts:** D stabbed victim; victim died 15 months later; Tennessee Supreme Court abolished common-law year-and-a-day rule and upheld murder conviction.
- **Background:** Year-and-a-day rule = if victim dies more than one year and one day after injury, defendant not liable for murder (outdated based on medical advances).
- **Rule/Reasoning:** 
  - Due process legality principle prohibits retroactive *legislation* (ex post facto), not judicial interpretation
  - Abolition of year-and-a-day rule was not "unexpected and indefensible" — rule was obsolete anachronism
  - Defendant had fair notice that killing could be murder; timing rule was procedural/evidentiary, not substantive element
- **Holding:** Conviction upheld — judicial abolition of year-and-a-day rule does not violate due process.
- **Dissent (Scalia):** Retroactive judicial expansion of criminal liability violates legality/due process (substance over form).

### **Robinson v. California (1962):**
- **Issue:** Does criminalizing the "status" of being addicted to narcotics violate Eighth Amendment?
- **Facts:** California statute made it a misdemeanor to "be addicted to the use of narcotics"; D convicted based on needle marks and officer testimony about addiction.
- **Rule/Reasoning:**
  - Eighth Amendment cruel and unusual punishment applies to states via Fourteenth Amendment
  - Punishing a *status* (being addicted) rather than an *act* is unconstitutional
  - Addiction is a disease/condition, not voluntary conduct
  - Analogies: Can't criminalize being sick with illness, being mentally ill, having leprosy
- **Holding:** Conviction overturned — criminalizing status of addiction violates Eighth Amendment.
- **Key limitation:** Statute punished *being* addicted (status), not *using* narcotics or *possessing* narcotics (acts).

### **Powell v. Texas (1968):**
- **Issue:** Does criminalizing public intoxication violate Eighth Amendment when defendant is chronic alcoholic?
- **Facts:** D, chronic alcoholic, convicted of "appearing in public while intoxicated" (Texas statute).
- **Rule/Reasoning:**
  - Statute criminalizes *act* (being drunk **in public**), not status of being alcoholic
  - Even if alcoholism is involuntary, D made voluntary act of appearing in public
  - *Robinson* limited to pure status crimes — doesn't extend to conduct crimes even if condition makes conduct more likely
- **Holding:** Conviction upheld — public intoxication statute does not violate Eighth Amendment (5-4 decision).
- **Dissent (Fortas):** Chronic alcoholic has no control over being in public while drunk — punishment is for involuntary conduct, violates Eighth Amendment.

### **City of Grants Pass v. Johnson (2024):**
- **Issue:** Do camping/sleeping bans violate Eighth Amendment when insufficient shelter beds available?
- **Facts:** Oregon city ordinances prohibited camping on public property; homeless individuals challenged as criminalizing status of being homeless when no shelter available.
- **Rule/Reasoning:**
  - Ordinances criminalize *conduct* (camping in public spaces), not status of being homeless
  - *Robinson* does not create "necessity defense" for homelessness
  - Cities can regulate public spaces even when this affects involuntarily homeless individuals
  - Insufficient shelter does not convert conduct ban into status punishment
- **Holding:** Ordinances upheld — camping bans do not violate Eighth Amendment even when shelter unavailable.
- **Policy tension:** Majority emphasizes local government authority to regulate public spaces; dissent/critics emphasize criminalization of poverty and involuntary conduct.

## 2. PRINCIPLES / RULES (Core doctrines)

### **A. Legality Principle (Fair Notice & No Ex Post Facto)**

**Core Principle:** No person shall be convicted of a crime unless the law clearly prohibited the conduct at the time it was committed.

**Three Sub-Rules:**

**1. Fair Notice (Vagueness Doctrine)**
- Criminal statute must give reasonable person fair warning that conduct is prohibited
- Strict construction in favor of defendant when statute is ambiguous
- *Keeler* application: "human being" strictly construed to mean born alive (no fair notice fetus included)

**2. No Ex Post Facto Laws (Constitutional)**
- Legislature cannot retroactively criminalize past conduct (Art. I, §9-10)
- *Rogers* distinction: prohibition applies to legislation, not judicial interpretation of common law
- But: Retroactive judicial expansion can violate due process if "unexpected and indefensible"

**3. Legislative Specificity (Rule of Lenity)**
- Courts should not expand criminal statutes beyond clear legislative intent
- If statute is ambiguous, interpret narrowly in favor of defendant
- *Keeler*: Court refuses to expand "human being" to include fetus — job for legislature

**Constitutional Source:** Due Process Clause (Fifth/Fourteenth Amendments) + Ex Post Facto Clause (Art. I)

---

### **B. Actus Reus Requirement (No Status Crimes)**

**Core Principle (*Robinson*):** Eighth Amendment prohibits punishing a person for a *status* or *condition* rather than for voluntary *conduct*.

**Rule:** Criminal liability requires proof of a voluntary act (or omission with duty to act); criminalizing status alone is cruel and unusual punishment.

**Elements (status crime test):**
1. Does statute punish condition/status (being X) or conduct (doing X)?
2. Is the conduct/status voluntary or involuntary?
3. If statute reaches involuntary conduct closely tied to involuntary status, does it violate Eighth Amendment?

**Applications:**

**Status (unconstitutional):**
- Being addicted to narcotics (*Robinson*) ✗
- Being homeless (hypothetical) ✗
- Being an alcoholic (hypothetical) ✗

**Conduct (constitutional):**
- Using narcotics (*Robinson* dicta) ✓
- Possessing narcotics ✓
- Being drunk in public (*Powell*) ✓
- Camping on public property (*Grants Pass*) ✓

**Key Distinction (*Powell*):** Even if underlying condition (alcoholism, homelessness) is involuntary, statute is constitutional if it criminalizes *act* (being in public, camping) rather than status itself.

**Voluntariness Gloss (*Powell* dissent):** Some acts may be so compelled by involuntary condition that they become constructively involuntary (chronic alcoholic "must" drink in public; homeless person "must" sleep somewhere) — but majority rejects this extension.

## 3. PROSECUTION ARGUMENTS (2-3 arguments)

### **On Legality (*Rogers* / Judicial Evolution)**

**Argument 1: Judicial Abolition of Obsolete Rules Is Not "Ex Post Facto"**
- *Rogers*: Due process legality principle applies to retroactive *legislation*, not judicial evolution of common law
- Courts routinely update common law doctrines — criminal law should not be frozen in time
- Year-and-a-day rule was obsolete anachronism; medical advances made it meaningless
- Defendant had fair notice that killing = murder; timing rule was evidentiary, not substantive element

**Argument 2: Fair Notice Satisfied When Core Conduct Clearly Prohibited**
- *Rogers*: Defendant knew stabbing someone could result in murder charge
- Legality requires notice of prohibited *conduct*, not every procedural limitation or defense
- Timing rules (statutes of limitation, year-and-a-day) are not elements of offense — can be modified without legality concerns

### **On Status Crimes (*Powell* / Grants Pass)**

**Argument 3: Conduct vs. Status — Voluntary Act Satisfies Actus Reus**
- *Powell*: Statute punished being drunk *in public*, not being alcoholic (conduct, not status)
- *Grants Pass*: Ordinances prohibit camping *on public property*, not being homeless (conduct, not status)
- Even if underlying condition is involuntary, criminalizing resulting conduct is constitutional
- *Robinson* limited to pure status crimes — doesn't extend to conduct crimes

**Argument 4: No Necessity Defense for Homelessness**
- *Grants Pass*: Eighth Amendment does not create necessity defense when person "has no choice" but to violate law
- Cities have legitimate interest in regulating public spaces (health, safety, aesthetics)
- Insufficient shelter does not convert conduct ban into unconstitutional status punishment
- Remedy is legislative/policy (build shelters), not constitutional (invalidate conduct prohibitions)

---

## 4. DEFENSE ARGUMENTS (2-3 arguments)

### **On Legality (*Keeler* / Scalia dissent in *Rogers*)**

**Argument 1: Legality Requires Strict Construction — Courts Cannot Expand Criminal Statutes**
- *Keeler*: "Human being" in 1850 statute clearly meant born alive — no fair notice that fetus included
- Rule of lenity: ambiguous criminal statutes construed in favor of defendant
- Retroactive expansion of criminal liability violates legality (substance over form)
- Legislature must provide fair notice by enacting statute *before* conduct occurs

**Argument 2: *Rogers* Dissent — Judicial Expansion Is Ex Post Facto in Substance**
- Scalia dissent: retroactive judicial abolition of year-and-a-day rule violates due process legality principle
- Defendant relied on year-and-a-day rule as limiting liability (not just evidentiary)
- Distinction between legislation and judicial interpretation is formalistic — substance matters
- If legislature cannot retroactively expand liability, neither can courts

### **On Status Crimes (*Robinson* / *Powell* dissent)**

**Argument 3: Involuntary Conduct Constructively = Status (*Powell* Dissent)**
- When person has no meaningful control over conduct (chronic alcoholic appearing in public drunk), punishing conduct is functionally punishing status
- *Robinson* principle: cannot punish person for condition beyond their control
- Homelessness example (*Grants Pass* dissent): if person has nowhere to sleep, criminalizing sleeping/camping is punishing status
- Necessity/duress defense should apply when conduct is compelled by involuntary condition

**Argument 4: Criminalizing Poverty Violates Eighth Amendment**
- *Grants Pass* dissent/critics: enforcing camping bans when insufficient shelter available punishes poverty (condition), not conduct
- If person cannot afford housing and no shelter available, they have no lawful place to exist
- Distinguishable from *Powell* (alcoholic could stay home) — homeless person has no private space

---

## 5. POLICY HOOK (1-2 sentences)

The legality principle protects individual liberty by requiring fair notice and legislative specificity, but *Rogers* shows courts may retroactively update obsolete rules if change is foreseeable; the status-crime ban (*Robinson*) prevents criminalizing conditions like addiction, but *Powell* and *Grants Pass* show courts narrowly cabin this protection, raising tensions about criminalizing poverty and involuntary conduct.

---

## 6. HARCOURT CLASSROOM MOVES (What to expect)

**Legality Module:**
- Expect him to assign prosecution/defense roles on *Keeler* vs. *Rogers* — argue whether judicial evolution violates fair notice
- He may ask: "Is the year-and-a-day rule an element or a defense?" (tests whether fair notice applies)
- Time-framing move: narrow description ("killing a fetus") vs. broad description ("killing") — which provides fair notice?
- Statutory construction exercise: read California murder statute and argue whether "human being" includes viable fetus

**Status Crimes Module:**
- Expect role-play on *Robinson* vs. *Powell* — prosecute/defend public intoxication charge for chronic alcoholic
- He may ask: "What's the voluntary act in *Powell*?" (Answer: appearing in public, not drinking)
- *Grants Pass* policy question: "If homelessness is involuntary and camping is necessary for survival, why isn't camping a status crime?"
- He may frame as Foucault/Balkin problem: criminalizing poverty = disciplining marginalized populations

**MPC Connection:**
- MPC § 1.02(1)(d): purposes of criminal law include "safeguard[ing] conduct that is without fault from condemnation as criminal"
- MPC § 2.01: actus reus requires "voluntary act" — no liability for status/condition alone

## 7. PAST OUTLINE REFERENCE

**Past outline:** `Crim_Spring 2025_Harcourt_Full.docx.md`  
**Topic in INDEX:** "Constitutional Limits → Legality" and "Actus Reus → Status Crimes"  
**Location:** Search for "legality principle" or "Robinson v. California"

**Key outline points:**
- Legality principle (fair notice + no ex post facto) derived from due process
- *Keeler* = strict construction in favor of defendant (rule of lenity)
- *Rogers* = judicial evolution allowed if not "unexpected and indefensible"
- *Robinson* = Eighth Amendment prohibits pure status crimes
- *Powell* = conduct (being in public) vs. status (being alcoholic) — majority says voluntary act satisfies actus reus
- *Grants Pass* = camping bans constitutional even when insufficient shelter
- Policy tension: legality protects liberty, but *Rogers*/*Grants Pass* show limits
- Harcourt frame: status crimes as social control of marginalized populations (Foucault's discipline)

**In-class lookup strategy:** Keep past outline open, CTRL+F for "legality" or "status crime" when called on

## 8. EXAM TIPS

**Issue-Spotter Application:**
1. **Legality:** If statute is ambiguous, argue rule of lenity (strict construction in favor of defendant)
2. **Fair Notice:** If new judicial interpretation or retroactive application, cite *Keeler* (courts can't expand) vs. *Rogers* (judicial evolution OK if foreseeable)
3. **Status vs. Conduct:** If statute arguably criminalizes status, cite *Robinson* (status unconstitutional) and distinguish *Powell* (conduct with voluntary act OK)
4. **Involuntary Conduct:** If defendant has no meaningful choice (homelessness, chronic addiction), cite *Powell* dissent and *Grants Pass* — argue conduct is constructively status

**Policy Essay:**
- Legality as liberty protection vs. judicial flexibility to update obsolete rules
- Status crimes as criminalizing poverty/marginalized populations (Foucault, abolitionist critique)
- *Grants Pass* as example of criminalizing homelessness — social control vs. public safety
- MPC approach: § 1.02(1)(d) and § 2.01 incorporate legality and voluntary act requirements

**Harcourt's Preferences:**
- He values policy/theory arguments — 50% of exam
- Critical theory frame (Foucault, Balkin) especially on status crimes
- Apply both common law AND MPC
- Time-framing arguments (narrow vs. broad description)
