# Text Prep — Class #4 — Intended Killings

**Index card for in-class lookup | Tuesday, 2026-01-27**

**Target length:** 500-800 words  
**Prep time:** 10-15 minutes  
**Philosophy:** Statute + arguments only. Post-class review is where real exam prep happens.

## 1. CASES FOR TODAY

**Purpose:** Watch Quimbee videos for these cases (include court/year to disambiguate)

- **Commonwealth v. Carroll (Pennsylvania Supreme Court, 1963)** — KSSB10 pp. 451-458
  - *Quimbee search:* "Commonwealth v. Carroll Pennsylvania 1963"
  - Topic: Instant premeditation allowed; no minimum time required

- **State v. Guthrie (West Virginia Supreme Court, 1995)** — KSSB10 pp. 458-462
  - *Quimbee search:* "State v. Guthrie West Virginia 1995"
  - Topic: Premeditation requires "some period" for reflection

## 1.5. CASE BRIEFS (Quick facts/reasoning/holding)

**Commonwealth v. Carroll (1963):**
- **Facts:** D shot sleeping wife twice in back of head after marital argument; claimed impulsive act.
- **Reasoning:** No minimum time required for premeditation; intent can form instantly if factfinder believes D intended to kill.
- **Holding:** First-degree murder conviction upheld; "brief space of time... is immaterial if killing was in fact intentional."

**State v. Guthrie (1995):**
- **Facts:** D stabbed coworker after being teased/snapped with dishtowel; jury instructed premeditation could be "in an instant."
- **Reasoning:** "Instantaneous premeditation" collapses first/second-degree distinction; need "some period" for reflection.
- **Holding:** Conviction reversed; jury must find interval showing opportunity for second thoughts.

## 2. STATUTE / RULE (Core text to have ready)

**Pennsylvania 1794 Degree-of-Murder Formula:**

> "All murder, which shall be perpetrated by means of poison, or by lying in wait, or by any other kind of **willful, deliberate and premeditated** killing... shall be deemed murder in the first degree; and all other kinds of murder shall be deemed murder in the second degree."

**Elements (parsed):**
1. **Willful** — intent to kill (specific intent)
2. **Deliberate** — cool, reflective thought process
3. **Premeditated** — formed intent before acting (time-framing fight)

**MPC §210.2 (Murder):**

> "(1) Except as provided in Section 210.3(1)(b), criminal homicide constitutes murder when:
> (a) it is committed purposely or knowingly; or
> (b) it is committed recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life."

**Key MPC Point:** No "premeditation" element. Murder = purposeful/knowing OR reckless with extreme indifference. Mitigation via EMED (§210.3(1)(b)).

**Source:** MPC Article 210, KSSB10 pp. 443-451

## 3. PROSECUTION ARGUMENTS (2-3 arguments)

**Argument 1: Instant Premeditation (*Carroll* Standard)**
- No minimum time required for premeditation
- Intent can form "in the moment" — any interval sufficient if factfinder believes D intended to kill
- Evidence: aiming at vital area, multiple shots/stabs, lying in wait
- *Carroll*: "brief space of time... is immaterial if killing was in fact intentional"

**Argument 2: Broad Time-Framing**
- "The act" includes defendant's earlier choices (retrieving weapon, returning to scene)
- Anderson factors: planning activity, motive, particular manner of killing
- Walk to kitchen/return = recommitment after opportunity for reflection
- Prosecution frames act broadly to show deliberation

**Argument 3: MPC Murder (§210.2(1)(a))**
- Under MPC, purposeful killing = murder automatically
- No "premeditation" analysis needed
- Check mitigation gate (§210.3(1)(b) EMED) — argue not satisfied here
- Clearer mens rea requirement than common law

---

## 4. DEFENSE ARGUMENTS (2-3 arguments)

**Argument 1: Requires Reflection Period (*Guthrie* Standard)**
- "Instantaneous premeditation" collapses first/second-degree distinction
- Need "some period" showing opportunity for reflection
- Snap decision in heat of argument ≠ premeditation
- *Guthrie*: must prove more than "intent at moment of killing"

**Argument 2: Narrow Time-Framing**
- "The act" is the trigger pull / stab — isolated moment, not prior choices
- No planning activity (weapon already present, or grabbed impulsively)
- No cooling period or recommitment
- Prosecution's "planning" narrative is post-hoc reconstruction from ordinary conduct

**Argument 3: MPC Mitigation (§210.3(1)(b) EMED)**
- Even if purposeful under §210.2(1)(a), check EMED provision
- "Extreme mental or emotional disturbance" with "reasonable explanation or excuse"
- Standard: "from viewpoint of person in actor's situation under circumstances as he believes them to be"
- Long marital conflict + sudden rejection + defendant's mental state = reasonable explanation
- Drops to manslaughter

## 5. POLICY HOOK (1 sentence)

The degree system tries to reserve first-degree murder for "cold-blooded" killings, but premeditation tracks planning skill and evidentiary luck as much as moral culpability — Kelman's time-framing critique shows the same facts support opposite results depending on whether you frame "the act" narrowly or broadly.

## 6. PAST OUTLINE REFERENCE

**Past outline:** `Crim_Spring 2025_Harcourt_Full.docx.md`  
**Topic in INDEX:** "Homicide → Intended Killings / Premeditation"  
**Location:** Lines 500-650 (approximate — search for "Carroll" or "Guthrie")

**Key outline points:**
- *Carroll* (instant premeditation) vs *Guthrie* (reflection required) = majority/minority split
- Anderson factors (planning, motive, manner) are evidentiary proxies
- MPC §210 rejects premeditation entirely — shifts to mens rea + mitigation
- Time-framing (broad vs narrow) is outcome-determinative in borderline cases
- Exam tip: Write prosecution AND defense; Harcourt rewards role-switching

**In-class lookup strategy:** Keep past outline open, CTRL+F for "premeditation" when called on
