# Prep Packet — Class #7 — 2026-02-03 — Unintended Killings

## 0) Outcome Targets
By the end of prep, I can: (1) distinguish extreme recklessness (murder) from recklessness (manslaughter) from negligence (negligent homicide) along three dimensions: awareness, risk level, care; (2) apply Malone, Welansky, Hall, and Williams to new hypos; (3) articulate policy rationale for gradations; (4) explain "conscious disregard for human life" vs. simple negligence; (5) avoid common exam traps on recklessness/intent confusion.

## 1) Assignment Snapshot
- **Syllabus extract**: `Admin/Syllabus/Assignments/2026-02-03_class07.md`
- **Reading triage**:
  - **Malone** (KSSB10 509-513): Russian roulette = extreme recklessness murder
  - **Welansky** (KSSB10 490-503): Nightclub fire = reckless manslaughter via omission
  - **Hall** (KSSB10 490-503): Shooting into crowd = extreme recklessness (>50% probability)
  - **Williams** (KSSB10 490-503): Doctor negligence = negligent homicide (overruled)
  - Past outline: Harcourt_Condesned Crim Outline.docx.md lines 177, 186, 318-325, 343-347

## 2) Three Gradations — Black Letter Rules

### A) Extreme Recklessness → MURDER

**Rule**: Death results from conduct involving substantial and unjustifiable risk of death, where defendant consciously disregards that risk under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to human life.

**Elements**:
1. Conduct creating substantial risk of death
2. Defendant aware of risk (conscious disregard)
3. Disregard is gross (extreme, not careless)
4. Shows extreme indifference to human life (key separator from recklessness)

**Mens rea**: Subjective awareness + objective "extreme indifference" measurement

---

### B) Recklessness → MANSLAUGHTER

**Rule**: Death results from conscious disregard of substantial and unjustifiable risk of death, without manifesting extreme indifference to human life.

**Elements**:
1. Conduct creating substantial risk of death
2. Defendant aware of risk (conscious disregard)
3. Gross deviation from standard of conduct
4. Does NOT manifest extreme indifference

**Mens rea**: Subjective awareness of risk

---

### C) Negligence → NEGLIGENT HOMICIDE

**Rule**: Death results from failure to perceive substantial and unjustifiable risk that reasonable person would have perceived.

**Elements**:
1. Conduct creating substantial risk of death
2. Defendant NOT aware of risk (but should have been)
3. Gross deviation from standard of care
4. Risk is substantial (not trivial)

**Mens rea**: Purely objective (reasonable person standard)

**Note**: Many jurisdictions limit negligent homicide to gross negligence or statutory carve-outs (Williams caveat).

---

## 3) Three Dimensions of Gradation (Harcourt's Framework)

**Dimension 1: AWARENESS (Subjective vs. Objective)**
- Defendant knew risk → Recklessness/Extreme Recklessness
- Defendant should have known → Negligence

**Dimension 2: RISK MAGNITUDE**
- Extreme recklessness: Very high risk (Russian roulette, >50% chance)
- Recklessness: Substantial but not extreme
- Negligence: Substantial risk defendant missed
- No liability: Minimal or trivial risk

**Dimension 3: CARE DEMONSTRATED**
- Extreme recklessness: Gross indifference to human life
- Recklessness: Gross deviation from standard conduct
- Negligence: Gross deviation from standard of care
- No liability: Reasonable care or accepted risk

---

## 4) Minimal Case Cards

### Commonwealth v. Malone (Pennsylvania)

**Facts**: Malone played Russian roulette (gun with one bullet, six chambers) with two others. One fired, bullet loaded, third man died. Malone participated by agreeing to play, egging shooter on.

**Issue**: Does playing Russian roulette constitute extreme recklessness manifesting extreme indifference to human life (murder)?

**Holding**: YES. Playing Russian roulette with loaded gun, knowing 1-in-6 chance of death, constitutes extreme recklessness manifesting extreme indifference to human life. Murder.

**Rule**: Extreme recklessness = conscious disregard of substantial risk under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to human life. Russian roulette is paradigm case.

**Reasoning**:
- Russian roulette is game where death is the point
- 1-in-6 chance is not "substantial risk"—it's near-certain eventual death
- Conduct itself (playing for fun) shows no regard for human life
- Extreme indifference inferred from nature of conduct

**Policy**: Retribution (deserve serious punishment), deterrence (punish as murderer), incapacitation (remove people who treat death as game).

**MPC hook**: MPC §2.02(2)(c) — recklessness involves conscious disregard of substantial risk that constitutes gross deviation from standard. Extreme recklessness elevates to murder-level culpability.

**One exam hypo**: D and V play game with loaded gun, spinning cylinder and pulling trigger. V dies. D claims no intent to kill. Charge: Extreme recklessness murder under Malone. No intent required—extreme indifference suffices.

---

### Welansky (Massachusetts)

**Facts**: Welansky owned nightclub (Coconut Grove). Club dangerously crowded, exits blocked/inadequate. Fire killed over 450 people. Welansky failed to maintain adequate fire exits, failed to remove obstructions, no egress planning.

**Issue**: Can failure to maintain safety precautions (knowing risks but disregarding) constitute reckless manslaughter?

**Holding**: YES. Failure to maintain proper fire exits and crowd control, knowing risks but disregarding them, constitutes recklessness. Gross deviation from standard of care + conscious disregard = manslaughter.

**Rule**: Recklessness includes both commission (actively doing risky) and omission (failing to act when duty exists). Conscious disregard of obvious risk of death = reckless manslaughter.

**Reasoning**:
- Welansky knew nightclub crowded and had inadequate exits (conscious awareness)
- Took no steps to remedy (conscious disregard)
- Reasonable owner would limit crowds, add exits, ensure safe egress
- Gross deviation from standard of business operation
- Manslaughter, not murder—no extreme indifference like Malone (not playing deadly game, just negligent business)

**Policy**: Deterrence (business owners must maintain safety), incapacitation (remove people who disregard public safety), fairness (owner who profited bears cost of deaths).

**One exam hypo**: Landlord knows building has defective wiring, doesn't fix it. Tenant dies in fire. Reckless manslaughter? Yes: (1) duty to tenant, (2) knowledge of risk, (3) conscious disregard, (4) gross deviation from standard.

---

### Hall (California)

**Facts**: Hall fired revolver into crowd of people. High probability of hitting someone and causing death. Charged with murder based on extreme recklessness.

**Issue**: Can shooting into crowd, knowing high probability of death (>50%), constitute extreme recklessness/murder?

**Holding**: YES. Shooting into crowd where probability of death exceeds 50% constitutes extreme recklessness manifesting extreme indifference to human life. Murder.

**Rule**: Probability of death is key metric for extreme recklessness. Very high probability (>50%) shows extreme indifference.

**Reasoning**:
- Shooting gun into crowd inherently dangerous, likely to kill
- Defendant knew this when pulling trigger
- Consciously disregarding very high risk = extreme indifference
- Probability analysis helps juries measure risk
- No legitimate purpose for firing into crowd

**Policy**: Deterrence (don't shoot into crowds, charged with murder), retribution (nearly certain to kill deserves murder-level punishment).

**MPC hook**: MPC §2.02(2)(c) — when conscious disregard involves extreme indifference to human life, elevated culpability.

**One exam hypo**: D throws dynamite into warehouse. High probability someone inside dies. Charge: Extreme recklessness murder under Hall probability analysis.

---

### Williams (England) — CAVEAT: Later Overruled

**Facts**: Williams was doctor. Patient died because Williams failed to provide adequate medical care/diagnosis. Williams argued didn't intend harm and may not have known about negligence.

**Issue**: Can doctor be liable for negligent homicide if death results from failure to provide reasonable care, even if doctor not aware of risk?

**Holding**: QUESTIONABLE (later overruled/limited). Suggests negligent homicide liability possible based on objective standard of reasonable care without awareness of risk.

**Rule**: Negligent homicide can arise from failure to perceive substantial risk that reasonable person would have perceived. Purely objective standard.

**Caveat**: Many jurisdictions statutorily limit negligent homicide or require "gross negligence" to avoid over-criminalization of professional mistakes. Know standard, but note modern limitation.

**Reasoning**:
- Doctors have duty to provide reasonable care
- Duty includes accurate diagnosis
- If reasonable doctor would have diagnosed/treated, but this doctor didn't, breach standard
- Breach + death = negligent homicide (under this view)

**Policy**: Deterrence (doctors should provide reasonable care), but concern about over-criminalizing professional judgment.

**One exam hypo**: Surgeon fails to notice excessive bleeding during surgery (warning signs: low BP, pale skin). Patient dies. Negligent homicide? Under Williams, yes. But modern law requires gross negligence—this may be ordinary professional error, not criminal. Civil malpractice more likely than criminal liability.

## 5) Summary Table

| **Gradation** | **Awareness** | **Risk Level** | **Care Deviation** | **Charges** | **Key Case** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Extreme Recklessness** | Conscious disregard + extreme indifference | Very high (>50% or quasi-certain) | Gross deviation showing extreme indifference | Murder | Malone, Hall |
| **Recklessness** | Conscious disregard (aware) | Substantial (significant, not extreme) | Gross deviation from standard conduct | Involuntary Manslaughter | Welansky |
| **Negligence** | NO awareness (should have been) | Substantial (risk exists, defendant missed) | Gross deviation from standard of care | Negligent Homicide (limited) | Williams |
| **No Liability** | No risk or accepted risk | Trivial or socially accepted | Reasonable care or accepted risk | None | — |

## 6) Key Exam Traps

**Trap 1: Confusing recklessness with intent to kill**
- Extreme recklessness does NOT require intent to kill
- Malone: Russian roulette players didn't intend to kill, but guilty of murder
- Exam technique: If facts show extreme recklessness without intent, say "Reckless murder under Malone, no intent required"

**Trap 2: Missing "extreme indifference" element**
- Not all reckless conduct = extreme recklessness
- Ask: Does this show extreme indifference to human life or ordinary recklessness?
- Welansky = ordinary recklessness/manslaughter; Malone = extreme/murder
- Exam technique: State both charges, explain why one more appropriate

**Trap 3: Forgetting objective "gross deviation" component**
- Even recklessness requires objective "gross deviation" from standard
- After "Did defendant know risk?", ask "Would reasonable person see this as gross deviation?"
- Exam technique: Include both subjective (aware? disregarding?) and objective (gross deviation?) prongs

**Trap 4: Confusing negligence with recklessness**
- Unaware = negligence (objective); Aware + disregarding = recklessness (subjective)
- Circle back to facts: "Did defendant know about risk?"
- Exam technique: State both charges, explain which fits based on awareness

**Trap 5: Over-charging negligence**
- Negligent homicide requires GROSS negligence (big deviation)
- Williams is old and limited; modern law requires gross negligence
- Exam technique: Caveat with "Many jurisdictions require gross negligence for criminal negligent homicide, not ordinary negligence"

**Trap 6: Missing omission liability**
- Recklessness/extreme recklessness can arise from failure to act if duty exists
- Ask: Duty + knowledge of risk + conscious disregard via inaction?
- Exam technique: Explicitly state "Omission liability applies because: [duty + knowledge + disregard]"

**Trap 7: Not using probability analysis**
- Hall: Use probability/odds to measure whether risk is "substantial" and disregard is "extreme"
- Exam technique: "If probability >50%, suggests extreme recklessness/murder; if lower, suggests ordinary recklessness/manslaughter"

## 7) Cold Call Script

**Extreme recklessness vs. recklessness vs. negligence:**
"Three dimensions: awareness (conscious disregard vs. failure to perceive), risk magnitude (very high vs. substantial), care deviation (extreme indifference vs. gross deviation). Malone (Russian roulette) = aware, very high risk, extreme indifference → murder. Welansky (nightclub) = aware, substantial risk, gross deviation but not extreme → manslaughter. Williams (doctor) = unaware but should have been → negligent homicide."

**Malone holding:**
"Russian roulette with loaded gun constitutes extreme recklessness manifesting extreme indifference to human life. No intent to kill required—extreme indifference suffices for murder."

**Welansky omission:**
"Recklessness includes both commission and omission. Business owner who knows of safety risks but consciously disregards them by failing to maintain adequate precautions commits reckless manslaughter."

**Hall probability test:**
"Shooting into crowd where probability of death exceeds 50% constitutes extreme recklessness murder. High probability shows extreme indifference to human life."

**Williams caveat:**
"Williams establishes objective negligence standard—failure to perceive risk reasonable person would perceive. But modern law often limits negligent homicide to gross negligence, not ordinary professional errors."

**Policy rationale:**
"Gradations calibrate punishment to culpability. Extreme recklessness shows moral blameworthiness near intent (deserves murder). Recklessness shows moral culpability (deserves manslaughter). Negligence shows less culpability (deserves lighter punishment or no criminal liability). Also deterrence: signal that extreme risk-taking = serious punishment."

## 8) Assigned Questions — Prepared Answers

**Q1: What are the dimensions along which cases resolve?**
Three dimensions: (1) Awareness—defendant consciously aware (recklessness) or unaware but should have been (negligence). (2) Risk magnitude—very high (>50%) = extreme; substantial = ordinary; trivial = no liability. (3) Care demonstrated—extreme indifference → extreme recklessness; gross deviation from standard → recklessness; failure to perceive → negligence.

**Q2: Do these dimensions make sense? Would you propose different system?**
Pro: Yes—culpability tracking (aware + reckless > unaware + negligent), proportionality (punishment scales with culpability), deterrence (incentives to be aware of risks), fairness (risky defendant bears cost when culpable). Con: Line-drawing unclear—"extreme indifference" becomes jury gut-feeling; awareness hard to prove (defendant claims "didn't know"); negligence over-criminalization (Williams limited for this reason); missing middle between intentional murder and reckless manslaughter.

**Q3: What purpose do these gradations serve for society?**
(1) Blame calibration—expressing different degrees of moral culpability through punishment levels. (2) Deterrence and norm-setting—criminalizing extreme recklessness as murder signals "don't play deadly games"; recklessness as manslaughter signals "businesses must take safety seriously." (3) Fairness to victims—similar harm (dead), but different defendant culpability; punishment adjusts accordingly. (4) Rule of law—gradations with clear line-drawing reduce arbitrary prosecution; prosecutors must fit facts into category. (5) Proportionality—prevents over-punishment (doctor's mistake as murder) and under-punishment (Russian roulette as mere recklessness).

## 9) Practice Hypos

### Hypo 1: Physics Demonstration
**Facts**: Professor throws bowling ball off 10-story building toward crowded street. Times it so street empty when ball falls. Pedestrian walks into path 2 seconds in (unaccounted for), killed. Professor didn't intend harm, thought careful by timing.

**Analysis**:
- Intentional murder? No intent to kill or cause bodily injury.
- Extreme recklessness murder? Aware of risk (yes). Risk magnitude high (bowling ball from 10 stories nearly certain to kill). Extreme indifference? Debatable—threw deadly projectile in public space, but took precautions (timed street's emptiness). Likely ordinary recklessness, not extreme.
- Recklessness manslaughter? Yes—consciously disregarded substantial risk, gross deviation from standard conduct.
- Negligent homicide? No—aware of risk.
- **Bottom line: Manslaughter (recklessness)**

### Hypo 2: Faulty Brakes
**Facts**: Joe owns car rental business. Knows 15% of fleet has faulty brakes (inspection found, hasn't replaced to save money). Rents faulty-brake car to customer. Customer dies when brakes fail. Joe didn't intend harm; thought risk "manageable."

**Analysis**:
- Extreme recklessness murder? Aware of risk (yes). Risk magnitude 15%—substantial but lower than Malone (17%) or Hall (>50%). Extreme indifference? Debatable—knowingly rented unsafe car, but business decision to save money, not deadly game. Likely ordinary recklessness.
- Recklessness manslaughter? Yes—aware, substantial risk, gross deviation (reasonable rental would replace faulty brakes).
- Negligent homicide? No—aware of risk.
- **Bottom line: Manslaughter (recklessness)**
- Exam note: If facts said "didn't know brakes faulty but reasonable inspection would have found," then negligent homicide.

### Hypo 3: Surgeon's Mistake (Williams-style)
**Facts**: Surgeon fails to notice excessive bleeding during surgery (warning signs: low BP, pale skin). Reasonable surgeon would have noticed. Patient dies from preventable blood loss. Surgeon genuinely didn't see bleeding.

**Analysis**:
- Recklessness manslaughter? No—unaware of risk (didn't notice bleeding). Recklessness requires conscious disregard.
- Negligent homicide? Unaware but reasonable surgeon would have been aware. Substantial risk (blood loss leading to death). Gross deviation (reasonable surgeon would have noticed signs). Possibly yes, but caveat: Under Williams, negligent homicide; under modern law (gross negligence standard), this may be ordinary professional error, not gross negligence. Many modern jurisdictions would NOT prosecute (civil malpractice, not criminal).
- **Bottom line: Possibly negligent homicide, but modern law limits to gross negligence—this may not meet threshold. More likely civil liability than criminal.**

## 10) Exam Strategy

**What Harcourt tests** (based on past outlines):
1. Line-drawing: extreme recklessness vs. ordinary recklessness (50% of exam points)
2. Awareness as key to recklessness vs. negligence (30% of exam points)
3. Policy rationale for gradations (20% of exam points)

**Exam strategy**:
- Step 1: Identify whether defendant aware of risk (conscious disregard → recklessness; unaware → negligence)
- Step 2: Assess risk magnitude using probability analysis (Hall approach)
- Step 3: Determine if conduct shows extreme indifference (Malone/Hall) or ordinary recklessness (Welansky)
- Step 4: State both charge and explain why one more appropriate
- Step 5: Include caveat on negligent homicide (gross negligence standard in modern law)

**Common exam structure**: Fact pattern with death, multiple defendant actors, ambiguity about awareness. Must charge all defendants and explain gradations.

**Pro tip**: If unsure between recklessness and extreme recklessness, charge both and explain line-drawing. Harcourt appreciates nuance.
