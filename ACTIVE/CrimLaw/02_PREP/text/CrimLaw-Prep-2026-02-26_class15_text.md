## SECTION 1: CASES FOR TODAY

### Primary Case: McCleskey v. Kemp (1987)

**Assignment Context:**
This class focuses on one of the most significant criminal law cases concerning race and capital punishment. We will explore whether statistical evidence of racial disparities in death penalty sentencing can prove unconstitutional discrimination. The assignment asks you to think about ways around the McCleskey holding to address racial discrimination in the criminal justice system.

**Reading:** KSSB10 pp. 590-602

**Quimbee Instructions:**
1. Search for "McCleskey v. Kemp" in Quimbee
2. Review the case brief, paying special attention to:
   - Facts about the Baldus study and its statistical findings
   - The Court's analysis of the intent requirement under the Equal Protection Clause
   - The majority's distinction between proving systemic risk vs. proving discriminatory intent in a specific case
   - Justice Brennan's dissent on the relevance of statistical evidence

## SECTION 1.2: SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS

### Charles R. Lawrence III: "The Id, The Ego, and Equal Protection: Reckoning with Unconscious Racism"

**Core Thesis:**
Lawrence challenges the intent requirement established in Washington v. Davis, arguing that the criminal justice system's focus on proving conscious discriminatory intent ignores the reality of unconscious racism that pervades American culture.

**Key Arguments:**

1. **Unconscious Racism is Prevalent:**
   - Culture transmits racist beliefs and preferences through "tacit understanding"
   - Individuals experience cognitive dissonance between racist ideas and societal ethics that condemn racism
   - The mind "excludes racism from consciousness" to avoid discomfort
   - Racist attitudes are "inescapable in a culture permeated with racism"

2. **The Intent Requirement is Inadequate:**
   - Traditional notions of intent don't reflect how human minds actually work
   - The intentional/unintentional dichotomy is "false"
   - Decisions about racial matters are influenced by unconscious factors that are neither consciously sought nor random
   - The burden of proving intent is "super high" and often impossible

3. **Proposed Solution - Cultural Meaning Test:**
   - Evaluate governmental conduct to determine whether it conveys a symbolic message to which the culture attaches racial significance
   - The "cultural meaning" of an allegedly discriminatory act is "the best analogue for a collective unconscious"
   - This test would trigger strict scrutiny for facially neutral actions with racially significant cultural meanings

4. **Why This Matters:**
   - Current doctrine distorts perceptions about causes of discrimination
   - Focus on individual fault creates resistance to affirmative action remedies
   - Understanding the cultural source of racism "obviates the need for fault"
   - Both conscious and unconscious racism infringe due process and equal protection

**Connection to McCleskey:**
Lawrence's argument directly challenges the McCleskey holding. While McCleskey requires proof of discriminatory intent in the specific case, Lawrence argues that unconscious racism operates irrespective of whether a decisionmaker consciously intends to discriminate. The Baldus study in McCleskey revealed exactly the kind of systemic racial disparity that Lawrence's cultural meaning test would address.

## SECTION 1.5: CASE BRIEFS

### McCleskey v. Kemp (U.S. Supreme Court, 1987)

**Facts:**
- Warren McCleskey, a Black defendant, was convicted of two counts of armed robbery and one count of murder in Georgia
- During an armed robbery of a furniture store, McCleskey and three accomplices shot and killed a white police officer
- The jury found two aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt:
  1. The murder was committed during an armed robbery
  2. The victim was a peace officer engaged in performance of duties
- The jury recommended death, and the trial court adopted the recommendation
- McCleskey challenged his sentence based on the **Baldus study**, a comprehensive statistical analysis of over 2,000 Georgia murder cases from the 1970s

**The Baldus Study Findings:**
- Even after controlling for 39 nonracial variables (criminal history, circumstances of crime, etc.), the study found:
  - Defendants charged with killing white victims were **4.3 times more likely** to receive a death sentence than defendants charged with killing Black victims
  - Black defendants who killed white victims (like McCleskey) had the **greatest likelihood** of receiving the death penalty
- The study demonstrated statistically significant racial disparities in capital sentencing

**Procedural History:**
- District Court and Court of Appeals dismissed McCleskey's petition, finding the statistical evidence insufficient
- McCleskey appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing his death sentence violated the Eighth Amendment (cruel and unusual punishment) and Fourteenth Amendment (equal protection)

**Issue:**
Whether a complex statistical study indicating a risk that racial considerations enter into capital sentencing determinations proves that a petitioner's capital sentence is unconstitutional under the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendment.

**Holding (5-4 Decision):**
No. Statistical evidence showing systemic racial disparities is insufficient to prove an unconstitutional violation without proof of purposeful discrimination in the specific case.

**Majority Reasoning (Justice Powell):**

1. **Intent Requirement:**
   - Under equal protection doctrine, petitioner has the burden of proving the existence of **purposeful discrimination** in his specific case
   - Statistical evidence alone, even powerful statistical evidence, does not meet this burden
   - Even the Baldus study "does not contend that his statistics prove that race enters into any capital sentencing decisions or that race was a factor in [McCleskey's] case"

2. **Inevitable Discretion in Criminal Justice:**
   - Discretion is essential to the criminal justice system
   - Statistical disparities are an "inevitable part of our criminal justice system"
   - Accepting McCleskey's claim would open the door to challenges based on "unexplainable discrepancies that correlate to membership in other minority groups and even to gender"
   - This would undermine the system's ability to function

3. **Eighth Amendment:**
   - While Furman v. Georgia (1972) was concerned with arbitrary and capricious sentencing, post-Furman cases like Gregg v. Georgia established that statistical disparities alone don't prove arbitrariness
   - Georgia's statutory scheme provides sufficient safeguards against arbitrary sentencing

4. **Institutional Competence:**
   - Legislatures, not courts, are best positioned to address broad policy concerns about systemic racism in criminal justice
   - "McCleskey's arguments are best presented to the legislative bodies"

**Dissent (Justice Brennan, joined by Marshall, Blackmun, and Stevens):**

1. **Furman's Concern with Risk:**
   - Post-Furman jurisprudence focuses on the **risk** of arbitrary or discriminatory sentencing, not just proven instances
   - McCleskey presents evidence not about how the system "might" operate, but about how it "does" operate
   - "It is irrelevant that McCleskey cannot prove the influence of race on any particular sentencing decision"

2. **Statistical Evidence is Powerful:**
   - The Baldus study is one of the most sophisticated statistical analyses ever conducted
   - Courts regularly rely on statistical evidence in other contexts (e.g., employment discrimination)
   - The study shows McCleskey faced a **significantly greater risk** of death because his victim was white

3. **Perpetuating Discrimination:**
   - The majority's reasoning "seems to give a constitutional stamp of approval on the status quo"
   - Requiring proof of discriminatory intent in specific cases makes the Equal Protection Clause "a dead letter" in challenging systemic racism

4. **Moral Responsibility:**
   - The risk of racial prejudice in capital sentencing is constitutionally intolerable
   - "The Court's decision today will not change what attorneys in Georgia tell other Warren McCleekeys about their chances of execution"

**Key Tensions:**

1. **Individualization vs. Consistency:**
   - Capital punishment doctrine requires both individualized sentencing (considering specific circumstances) and consistent application (avoiding arbitrary disparities)
   - McCleskey highlights the difficulty of achieving both simultaneously

2. **Proof of Risk vs. Proof of Intent:**
   - Dissent: Furman was concerned with risk of discrimination
   - Majority: Equal Protection requires proof of actual discriminatory intent

3. **Statistical Evidence vs. Specific Proof:**
   - How should courts weigh powerful statistical evidence against the inability to prove discrimination in a particular case?
   - Is it sufficient that a defendant faced a substantially higher risk due to race?

**Exam Relevance:**

1. **Equal Protection Analysis:**
   - What must a defendant prove to establish an equal protection violation?
   - Intent requirement: purposeful discrimination in the specific case
   - Why statistical disparities alone are insufficient under current doctrine

2. **Capital Punishment Doctrine:**
   - Post-Furman requirements: avoiding arbitrary and capricious sentencing
   - Tension between discretion (necessary for individualization) and consistency
   - Role of aggravating and mitigating factors

3. **Policy Arguments:**
   - Institutional competence: courts vs. legislatures
   - Floodgates concern: extending McCleskey's logic to other contexts
   - Practical implications for criminal justice system

4. **Connections to Other Course Themes:**
   - How criminal law entrenches social order (race, class, power)
   - Interest theory: using neutral doctrines to perpetuate inequality
   - Steiker & Steiker's legitimation theory: does McCleskey give "constitutional stamp of approval" to discriminatory practices?

**Ways Around McCleskey (Assignment Focus):**

Consider approaches that might address racial discrimination in capital punishment without requiring proof of intent in specific cases:

1. **Legislative Reform:**
   - Mandatory proportionality review
   - Presumptions based on racial disparities
   - Enhanced data collection and transparency

2. **Eighth Amendment Arguments:**
   - Frame as cruel and unusual punishment per se
   - Argue that risk of discrimination itself violates Eighth Amendment
   - Distinguish from equal protection intent requirement

3. **State Constitutional Grounds:**
   - Some state constitutions provide broader protections
   - State courts not bound by federal Equal Protection analysis

4. **Procedural Safeguards:**
   - Voir dire questions about racial bias
   - Jury instructions on avoiding racial considerations
   - Automatic reversal when racial evidence introduced

5. **Prosecutorial Discretion Reform:**
   - Guidelines for charging capital-eligible offenses
   - Oversight and review mechanisms
   - Race-impact statements

## SECTION 2: POLICY CONSIDERATIONS AND EXAM ANGLES

### The Intent Requirement and Its Critics

**Washington v. Davis Framework:**
- Facially neutral laws that have disparate impact are constitutional unless there's proof of discriminatory intent
- Intent must be purposeful, not merely awareness of disparate impact
- This is the framework McCleskey applies

**Lawrence's Critique:**
- Intent doctrine "ignores what we know about how the human mind works"
- Unconscious racism operates "irrespective of the decisionmaker's motives"
- Current doctrine makes Equal Protection "essentially unenforceable" against systemic discrimination
- Cultural meaning test would look at whether government action "conveys a symbolic message to which the culture attaches racial significance"

### Steiker & Steiker: Legitimation Theory Applied to McCleskey

**Internal Legitimation:**
- McCleskey allows prosecutors, judges, and jurors to believe the system is fair
- "False aura of rationality" around capital sentencing
- Actors within the system feel their discretion is "safely circumscribed"

**External Legitimation:**
- Public perceives multiple safeguards against unjust executions
- Supreme Court's detailed attention to death penalty creates appearance of careful regulation
- In reality, "regulatory effects are negligible in promoting justice"
- McCleskey gives "constitutional stamp of approval" to discriminatory status quo

**Worst of All Possible Worlds:**
- Court's regulation of death penalty has "negligible improvements over pre-Furman era"
- But Court's attention "has helped people to accept without second thoughts... our profoundly failed system of capital punishment"

### Connections to Course Themes

**How Criminal Law Entrenches Social Order:**
- McCleskey demonstrates how facially neutral legal doctrines perpetuate racial inequality
- Intent requirement protects existing power structures
- Statistical evidence of discrimination is insufficient to overcome legal presumptions

**Balkin Dyads:**
- **Individualist approach:** Dissent focuses on risk to individual defendant, considers systemic context
- **Communalist approach:** Majority emphasizes system's need for discretion, deference to state interests

**Time-Framing:**
- Narrow framing: focus on specific case, specific actors, specific intent
- Broad framing: systemic patterns across thousands of cases over decades

**Foucault and Discipline:**
- Capital punishment as mechanism of state power
- How legal doctrine makes discrimination appear legitimate and natural
- "Straightening" of criminal justice discourse to hide systemic racism

### Potential Exam Questions

1. **Compare and contrast** McCleskey's holding with the dissent's approach. Which is more persuasive? Why might the Court have been concerned about accepting the Baldus study as sufficient proof?

2. **Apply Lawrence's cultural meaning test** to the facts of McCleskey. Would the death penalty practices in Georgia satisfy his proposed standard? What "symbolic message" does the racial disparity in capital sentencing convey?

3. **Analyze McCleskey through Steiker & Steiker's legitimation theory.** How does the decision function as internal and external legitimation of the death penalty system?

4. **Policy question:** If you were a state legislator, what specific reforms would you propose to address the concerns raised by the Baldus study while respecting the Court's holding in McCleskey?

5. **Compare the intent requirement in McCleskey with mens rea requirements** for criminal defendants. Is there an inconsistency in requiring proof of purposeful discrimination from defendants challenging their sentences while allowing conviction based on lesser mental states?
