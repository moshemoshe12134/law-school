# Prep Packet — Class #8 — 2026-02-05 — Issues of Causation

## 0) Outcome Targets (5 minutes)
By the end of prep, distinguish: (1) factual (but-for) from legal (proximate) causation; (2) the foreseeability test for proximate cause; (3) Acosta's "highly extraordinary result" standard; (4) Arzon's treatment of independent intervening causes; (5) MPC § 2.03's causal requirements for purpose/knowledge vs. recklessness/negligence; (6) causation hypothetics with unusual event chains; (7) policy and theoretical critiques of causation doctrine.

## 1) Assignment Snapshot
- **Syllabus extract**: `Admin/Syllabus/Assignments/2026-02-05_class08.md`
- **Reading triage**:
  - **Cases**: Acosta (helicopter collision during police chase — how bizarre is too bizarre?), Arzon (firefighter killed when second fire intervenes — independent but foreseeable)
  - **Statutory**: MPC § 2.03 — systematic approach to causation
  - **Policy**: Technical causation doctrine involves deep policy choices about responsibility
  - **Theoretical**: Kelman time-framing (Class 2) + cultural interpretation of "causing" harm

---

## 2) Causation Framework

### Two-Part Structure

**1. Factual Cause (Actual Cause / "But-For" Cause)**
- **Test**: "But for the defendant's conduct, would the harm have occurred?"
- **Latin**: *sine qua non* — without which, not
- **Purpose**: Establish minimal factual connection between act and result
- **Usually easy**: Most cases clear this hurdle (Acosta: but-for chase, helicopters never positioned for collision)
- **Exceptions**: Overdetermination, pre-emptive causes, loss of chance

**2. Legal Cause (Proximate Cause)**
- **Test**: Is the result sufficiently connected to defendant's conduct to justify liability?
- **Key concepts**: Foreseeability, scope of the risk, directness
- **Purpose**: Distinguish results we hold defendant responsible for from coincidences
- **Usually hard**: Real disputes arise here
- **Flexible**: No bright-line rule; involves policy judgments

### Why Two Prongs?

**Factual cause is necessary but not sufficient**:
- Example: Acosta factually caused helicopter crash (but-for test satisfied)
- Question remains: Should we hold him criminally responsible?
- Proximate cause answers that question

**Policy function**:
- Prevents unlimited liability for infinite cascading consequences
- Focuses on harms defendant should have anticipated
- Reflects moral judgments about responsibility

---

## 3) The Foreseeability Test (Dominant Approach)

### Basic Principle

**Rule**: Defendant liable for results reasonably foreseeable at time of act, not for highly extraordinary or accidental outcomes

**Source**: Tort law principles imported into criminal law

**Key language (Acosta)**:
> "Proximate cause" separates results for which actor held responsible from those not carrying such responsibility... The line of demarcation is flexible; uniform tests fail.

**Standard (Acosta)**:
> "Exclude extraordinary results; allow trier of fact to determine on particular facts using 'common sense of common man as to common things'"

> "Highly extraordinary result" standard

### What is "Foreseeable"?

**Objective test**:
- About what reasonable person would anticipate, not defendant's actual foresight
- Focuses on "objective conditions present when he acts"

**Not too demanding**:
- No need to predict exact sequence of events
- No need to foresee specific mechanism of harm
- General category of harm sufficient

**Not unlimited**:
- Must be more than merely possible
- Must be more than barely conceivable
- "Barely objectively cognizable" risk too attenuated (Acosta mens rea discussion)

---

## 4) Minimal Case Cards (co-primary)

### People v. Acosta (California, 1991) — Helicopter Collision

**Facts (30 seconds)**:
- Acosta led police on 48-mile high-speed chase in stolen car
- Engaged in egregious driving: ran stop signs/red lights, drove on wrong side of road
- Four police helicopters tracked him from above with spotlights
- During coordination maneuver, two helicopters collided mid-air
- Three officers died
- Expert witness: Never heard of police helicopter collision during chase; unprecedented

**Procedural posture**:
- Acosta convicted of three counts second-degree murder
- Appeals: (1) Insufficient evidence of proximate cause; (2) Insufficient evidence of malice (mens rea)

**Holding — Causation**:
- **Proximate cause established**; helicopter collision not "highly extraordinary"
- But-for test satisfied: Without chase, helicopters never in position
- Foreseeability: Collision was "possible consequence which reasonably might have been contemplated"

**Key reasoning**:
- Factual cause clear: "But for Acosta's conduct fleeing police, helicopters would never have been in position"
- Proximate cause standard: "Highly extraordinary result" test — exclude results too remote/accidental
- Not highly extraordinary despite unprecedented:
  - No reported cases; expert never heard of it
  - "Emotional dynamics of police pursuit" create appreciable probability of pursuer negligence/recklessness
  - Prior lack of helicopter crashes reflects "police flying skill and technology," not inherent improbability

**Key language**:
> "Two-helicopter collision was unknown to expert witness and no reported cases describe one, but it was 'a possible consequence which reasonably might have been contemplated'"

> "Given emotional dynamics of any police pursuit, there is 'appreciable probability' that one of the pursuers, in heat of chase, may act negligently or recklessly"

**Holding — Mens Rea** (IMPORTANT DUAL ANALYSIS):
- **Murder conviction REVERSED** on mens rea grounds
- Insufficient proof of malice (conscious disregard of risk to human life)
- Risk to helicopter pilots was "barely objectively cognizable"
- No reasonable juror could find conscious disregard of risk "barely objectively cognizable"
- Result: Acosta caused deaths (causation satisfied) but not guilty of murder (mens rea lacking)

**Key language — Mens rea**:
> "No reasonable juror could find conscious disregard for risk which is barely objectively cognizable"

**Dissent (Crosby, J.)**:
- Would reverse on causation grounds
- Helicopter occupants "not within range of apprehension of fleeing criminal on ground"
- Citing *Palsgraf*: "Risk imports relation; it is risk to another or to others within range of apprehension"
- No proximate cause because harm too extraordinary

**Policy hook**:
- **How bizarre is too bizarre?**: Unprecedented doesn't mean unforeseeable
- **Split issue**: Causation satisfied (crash foreseeable enough) but mens rea lacking (risk barely cognizable)
- **Result**: Acosta guilty of some homicide crime (manslaughter?) but not murder
- **Tension**: How can risk be "barely objectively cognizable" for mens rea but sufficiently foreseeable for proximate cause?

**Connection to prior classes**:
- **Mens rea** (Class 3): Malice requires conscious disregard
- **Felony murder** (Class 6): If felony murder, mens rea not element
- **Kelman time-framing** (Class 2): When does Acosta's criminal act "begin" and "end"?

---

### People v. Arzon (New York, 1978) — Intervening Independent Cause

**Facts (30 seconds)**:
- Arzon intentionally set fire to couch on fifth floor of abandoned building
- Fire department responded, found 5th/6th floors burning
- Firemen fought fire, made no progress, decided to withdraw
- **Suddenly**: Thick smoke enveloped them from **second fire** on second floor
- Second fire also arson, but NO evidence Arzon responsible
- Firefighter Martin Celic died in hazardous evacuation caused by combination of both fires

**Charges**:
- Count 1: Depraved-heart murder (recklessly engaged in conduct creating grave risk of death)
- Count 2: Felony murder (death during arson)
- Count 3: Arson (not contested)

**Defense argument**:
- Insufficient causation: Second fire (independent cause) broke causal chain between Arzon's fire and death
- Without second fire, firefighter would have survived

**Holding — Causation established**:
- Murder charges upheld; Arzon criminally liable for firefighter's death
- Independent intervening cause (second fire) does NOT break causal chain

**Reasoning**:
- Defendant's conduct need not be "sole and exclusive factor" in death
- Standard from *People v. Kibbe*: Conduct is "sufficiently direct cause" when harm "should have been foreseen as reasonably related to acts"
- *People v. Stewart*: Must forge link in chain of causes actually bringing about death

**Application**:
- Firefighters responding to Arzon's fire was foreseeable
- Their exposure to life-threatening danger was foreseeable
- Arzon's fire was "indispensable link in chain of events"
- Even without second fire, evacuation hazardous due to Arzon's fire
- Second fire was "separate and independent force" but:
  - Arzon's act placed firefighter in "position particularly vulnerable" to that force
  - Similar to Kibbe: Defendants abandoned robbery victim on dark road; truck killed victim; defendants still liable

**Key language**:
> "Under People v. Kibbe... individual criminally liable if conduct was sufficiently direct cause of death, and ultimate harm should have been foreseen as reasonably related to acts"

> "Irrelevant that fire on second floor intervened, contributing to conditions culminating in death"

> "Fire set by defendant was indispensable link in chain of events resulting in death"

> "Defendant's act placed deceased in position particularly vulnerable to separate and independent force"

**Contrast with Warner-Lambert**:
- Arzon liable despite independent intervening cause
- Warner-Lambert NOT liable because specific triggering mechanism unforeseeable
- Key difference: Arzon created foreseeable risk to firefighters; Warner-Lambert created general risk but not specific triggering event

**Policy hook**:
- **Independent doesn't mean unforeseeable**: Second fire independent but risk to firefighters foreseeable
- **Vulnerable victim principle**: Defendant who puts victim in harm's way liable for independent dangers exploiting that vulnerability
- **Foreseeability vs. independence**: Intervening act can be independent yet foreseeable
- **"Sufficiently direct cause"**: Flexible standard; not sole cause, not remote cause

**Connection to prior classes**:
- **Felony murder** (Class 6): Arzon charged with felony murder — causation requirement similar
- **Mens rea** (Class 3): Depraved heart = reckless disregard of grave risk

---

### People v. Warner-Lambert Co. (New York, 1980) — Specific Causal Mechanism

**Facts (30 seconds)**:
- Warner-Lambert manufactured chewing gum using magnesium stearate (MS)
- MS dust creates explosion hazard at high concentrations
- Insurance company WARNED defendants about explosion risk
- Hazard not eliminated
- Explosion occurred at factory; employees killed/injured
- **Triggering cause UNKNOWN**: Could be machinery sparking, metal part impact, or something else
- Experts speculated but no proof of what ignited dust

**Prosecution theory**:
- But-for causation sufficient
- Foreseeable risk of explosion existed
- Defendants failed to remove dust
- Specific triggering event irrelevant
- Would be liable even if lightning bolt or intruder's match triggered explosion

**Holding — Causation NOT established**:
- Indictment dismissed; insufficient evidence of causation
- But-for causation alone insufficient for criminal liability
- Must foresee **specific causal mechanism** or triggering event

**Reasoning**:
- Rejects "sweeping theory of culpability" from tort law
- Criminal law requires narrower causation standard
- Distinguishes *Kibbe* and *Arzon*: Those involved foreseeable mechanisms (truck hitting person, firefighters entering burning building)
- Here: Specific cause of explosion unknown; could have been "lightning of match by uninvited intruder or bolt of lightning"
- That level of unpredictability breaks causal chain

**Key language**:
> "People position: but-for causation is all required for imposition of criminal liability"

> "Chain of physical events by which explosion set off, i.e., its particular cause, is to them matter of total indifference"

> "Effect: hold defendants to status of guarantors until ambient dust removed"

> "We have rejected application of any such sweeping theory of culpability under our criminal law"

**"Specific causal mechanism" requirement**:
- Defendant must reasonably foresee **how** harm will occur, not just **that** harm might occur
- Not enough that explosion was foreseeable risk
- Must foresee specific triggering event (machinery spark, metal impact, etc.)
- When multiple possible triggers, some too remote, liability fails

**Policy contrast**:
- **Arzon**: Liable because firefighters responding was foreseeable specific mechanism
- **Warner-Lambert**: Not liable because specific trigger (spark? lightning? intruder?) unforeseeable
- **Line drawing**: Arzon's risk involved predictable human response; Warner-Lambert's involved unpredictable physical events

**Subsequent developments**:
- New York courts limited "specific-causal-mechanism" requirement to commercial/manufacturing contexts
- Not universally applied to all criminal cases
- Shows court's discomfort with broad liability

**Policy hook**:
- **Limiting principle**: Criminal law shouldn't make defendants "guarantors" of all possible consequences
- **Predictability requirement**: Specific mechanism must be foreseeable
- **Tort vs. criminal**: Tort law broader causation; criminal law narrower (higher stakes)

## 5) MPC § 2.03 — Systematic Approach

### Text Breakdown

**§ 2.03. Causal Relationship Between Conduct and Result**

**Subsection (1) — General Causation Requirement**:
> "(1) Conduct is cause of result when:
> (a) it is antecedent but for which result in question would not have occurred; and
> (b) relationship between conduct and result satisfies any additional causal requirements imposed by Code or by law defining offense."

**Structure**:
- **(1)(a)**: But-for causation requirement (factual cause)
- **(1)(b)**: Additional requirements from Code or offense definition (legal cause)

**Subsection (2) — Purpose/Knowledge Cases**:
> "(2) When purposely or knowingly causing particular result is element of offense, element is not established if actual result is not within purpose or contemplation of actor unless:
> (a) actual result differs from that designed or contemplated only in respect that different person or different property is injured or affected or that injury or harm designed or contemplated would have been more serious or more extensive than that caused; or
> (b) actual result involves same kind of injury or harm as that designed or contemplated and is not too remote or accidental in its occurrence to have [just] bearing on actor's liability or on gravity of his offense."

**Key features**:
- **Purpose/Knowledge**: Defendant intended or knew result would occur
- **Divergence**: Actual result different from intended result
- **Two safe harbors**:
  - **(2)(a)**: Different victim/property or less serious harm = automatically within scope
  - **(2)(b)**: Same kind of harm + not too remote/accidental = within scope

**Subsection (3) — Recklessness/Negligence Cases**:
> "(3) When recklessly or negligently causing particular result is element of offense, element is not established if actual result is not within risk of which actor is aware or, in case of negligence, of which he should be aware unless:
> (a) actual result differs from probable result only in respect that different person or different property is injured or affected or that probable injury or harm would have been more serious or more extensive than that caused; or
> (b) actual result involves same kind of injury or harm as probable result and is not too remote or accidental in its occurrence to have [just] bearing on actor's liability or on gravity of his offense."

**Key features**:
- **Recklessness/Negligence**: Defendant conscious of risk (recklessness) or should have been (negligence)
- **Risk-based**: Focus on risks defendant was aware of/should have been aware of
- **Same structure** as subsection (2)

**Subsection (4) — Strict Liability**:
> "(4) When causing particular result is material element of offense for which absolute liability is imposed by law, element is not established unless actual result is probable consequence of actor's conduct."

**Key features**:
- **Strict liability**: No culpability requirement
- **Stricter standard**: Result must be "probable consequence" of conduct
- Higher threshold than purpose/knowledge or recklessness cases

### MPC Approach Explained

**Same kind of harm + not too remote**:
- Not same as common-law foreseeability
- Focus on "same kind of harm" not exact result
- Flexible "not too remote or accidental" standard
- "Just bearing on liability or gravity of offense"

**Examples**:
- Intend to shoot Victim A, bullet misses and hits Victim B → Same kind of harm (death), different person → § 2.03(2)(a) applies → Liable
- Intend to break Victim A's arm, actually breaks Victim B's leg → Different person, different harm but same kind (bodily injury) → § 2.03(2)(b) if not too remote → Liable
- Recklessly discharge gun in building, bullet travels through wall, hits person in adjacent building → Same kind of harm (death), not too remote → § 2.03(3)(b) → Liable

**How MPC would decide Acosta**:
- Acosta acted recklessly (malice requires conscious disregard)
- Result: Death of helicopter pilots
- Was death "within the risk" of which Acosta was aware?
- **Issue**: Court said risk to pilots was "barely objectively cognizable"
- **MPC § 2.03(3)**: If death not within risk of which Acosta was aware, then:
  - § 2.03(3)(a): Different person? No (officers vs. ground pursuit)
  - § 2.03(3)(b): Same kind of harm? Death is same kind, but is it "too remote or accidental"?
- **Result**: MPC would likely find death too remote/accidental given "barely cognizable" risk

**How MPC would decide Arzon**:
- Arzon acted purposely (arson)
- Result: Death of firefighter
- Was firefighter death "within the contemplation" of Arzon?
- **Issue**: Arzon didn't contemplate firefighter death specifically
- **MPC § 2.03(2)**:
  - § 2.03(2)(a): Different person? Yes (firefighter not contemplated)
  - § 2.03(2)(b): Same kind of harm? Death not necessarily same kind as property damage by fire
  - BUT firefighter death is foreseeable risk of arson
- **Result**: MPC would likely find liability under § 2.03(2)(b) — same kind of harm (death) not too remote given foreseeable emergency response

**How MPC would decide Warner-Lambert**:
- Warner-Lambert acted recklessly/negligently (knew explosion risk)
- Result: Death from explosion
- Was death "within the risk"?
- Yes, explosion risk was known
- **Issue**: Specific triggering mechanism unknown
- **MPC § 2.03(3)**:
  - Death within risk of explosion? Yes
  - Same kind of harm? Yes (death)
  - Too remote/accidental? Unknown trigger might make it too accidental
- **Result**: Unclear, but MPC's "not too remote or accidental" standard might be more flexible than Warner-Lambert's "specific causal mechanism" requirement

## 6) Policy / Theory Brief

### The Core Problem

**Why causation doctrine?**
- Limit liability for infinite cascading consequences
- Distinguish results we blame people for from coincidences
- Give fair warning about punishable conduct
- Express moral judgments about responsibility

**The tension**:
- Too narrow: Escape liability for bad results defendant should have anticipated
- Too broad: Punish people for results outside their control

### Foreseeability Approach (Dominant)

**Strengths**:
1. **Objective standard**: Reasonable person test, not defendant's subjective foresight
2. **Fair warning**: People can anticipate foreseeable risks
3. **Moral limits**: Don't punish for results person couldn't reasonably anticipate
4. **Flexible**: "Common sense of common man" adapts to contexts

**Weaknesses**:
1. **Indeterminate**: No clear line for "too remote"
2. **Hindsight bias**: Easy to say result was foreseeable after it happened
3. **Policy judgments**: Disguises policy choices as factual findings
4. **Acosta puzzle**: How can risk be "barely cognizable" for mens rea but sufficiently foreseeable for causation?

**Hart & Honoré criticism**:
> MPC's "not too remote or accidental" formulation "does not provide specifically for cases where... another human action... involved in production of proscribed harm. These are treated merely as one kind of case where harm may or may not be 'too accidental'"

**Problem**: Human actions are special — we treat them differently from natural events

### Scope of the Risk Approach (Alternative)

**Basic idea**: Focus on risks defendant consciously created, not all foreseeable results

**Structure**:
1. Identify risks defendant was aware of (or should have been)
2. Ask: Did actual result fall within scope of those risks?
3. If yes, defendant liable
4. If no, defendant not liable

**Example**:
- Drug dealer sells heroin to buyer
- Buyer uses heroin, dies in bathroom
- Dealer not liable for death
- Why? Death from overdose not within scope of risk dealer consciously created
- Dealer created risk of addiction, not death
- Punishing dealer for death wouldn't deter careful dealing

**Strengths**:
1. **Clearer focus**: Look at risks defendant actually chose to create
2. **Deterrence rationale**: Punishment linked to risks defendant could have avoided
3. **Moral fit**: Blames defendant for risks they intentionally created

**Weaknesses**:
1. **Definitional problems**: What is "scope of the risk"?
2. **Arbitrary line-drawing**: Is death from overdose "same kind of harm" as addiction?
3. **May under-deter**: Doesn't punish for bad results foreseeable but outside conscious risk-taking

### Cultural Interpretation (Harcourt/Kelman lens)

**Time-framing (Kelman)**:
- When does act "begin" and "end"?
- Acosta: Is entire 48-mile chase part of "act"? Or does act end when each dangerous driving maneuver ends?
- Arzon: Is arson "act" complete when fire set? Or does it continue while firefighters respond?
- Time-framing determines what consequences are "within" the act

**Causal attribution as cultural practice**:
- Different cultures attribute causation differently
- Western law focuses on individual agency as causal force
- What counts as "cause" reflects deep assumptions about responsibility

**Hypothetical**:
- Campbell assists suicide (provides drugs to terminally ill patient)
- Kevorkian assists suicide (provides suicide machine)
- Both intend death, both cause death
- Both acquitted or not prosecuted for murder
- Why? Cultural distinction: We treat victim's choice as "real" cause, not assistant's facilitation
- Shows causation is about cultural interpretation, not just physical chains

**Practical implications**:
- We don't hold doctors liable when patients die despite treatment (usually)
- We don't hold drug sellers liable for buyer's overdose death (usually)
- We do hold robbers liable when heart attack victim dies (Stamp)
- Difference: Cultural judgments about what counts as "causing"

## 7) Cold Call / Co-Counsel Script (2 minutes)

**Causation framework**:
- **Two-part structure**: Factual cause (but-for test) + legal cause (proximate cause/foreseeability)
- **Factual**: "But for defendant's conduct, would harm have occurred?" — usually easy
- **Legal**: Is result sufficiently connected to justify liability? — usually hard
- **Purpose**: Limit liability to results defendant should have anticipated

**Acosta**:
- **Facts**: 48-mile police chase, 4 helicopters tracking, 2 collided mid-air, 3 officers died
- **Causation**: But-for test satisfied (no chase = no helicopters), proximate cause established (collision not "highly extraordinary")
- **Mens rea split**: Court found causation satisfied but malice insufficient; risk to pilots "barely objectively cognizable"
- **Key holding**: Unprecedented doesn't mean unforeseeable; emotional dynamics of pursuit create appreciable probability of negligence
- **Dissent**: Helicopter occupants not "within range of apprehension" of fleeing driver (Palsgraf principle)

**Arzon**:
- **Facts**: Arzon set fire on 5th floor, firefighters responded, second fire broke out on 2nd floor (independent arson), firefighter died in evacuation
- **Issue**: Does independent intervening cause (second fire) break causal chain?
- **Holding**: No, Arzon liable for firefighter's death
- **Reasoning**: Firefighters responding foreseeable; Arzon's fire placed firefighter in position vulnerable to second fire; "indispensable link in chain of events"
- **Standard**: *Kibbe* — conduct is "sufficiently direct cause" when harm "should have been foreseen as reasonably related to acts"

**Warner-Lambert**:
- **Facts**: Gum factory with explosive magnesium stearate dust, explosion killed workers, triggering cause unknown (spark? lightning?)
- **Holding**: Causation NOT established; indictment dismissed
- **Reasoning**: But-for causation insufficient; must foresee specific causal mechanism; triggering event too unpredictable
- **Contrast with Arzon**: Arzon involved foreseeable human response (firefighters); Warner-Lambert involved unpredictable physical events
- **Policy**: Criminal law shouldn't make defendants "guarantors until ambient dust removed"

**MPC § 2.03**:
- **Structure**: (1) But-for causation + (2) Additional requirements from offense definition
- **§ 2.03(2)**: Purpose/knowledge cases — actual result within purpose/contemplation OR different victim/property OR same kind of harm not too remote
- **§ 2.03(3)**: Recklessness/negligence cases — actual result within risk defendant aware of OR different victim/property OR same kind of harm not too remote
- **Key concept**: "Same kind of harm + not too remote or accidental"
- **Advantage**: More systematic than common-law foreseeability; ties liability to culpability level

**Policy**:
- **Foreseeability**: Dominant approach; objective "reasonable person" test; excludes highly extraordinary results
- **Criticism**: Indeterminate; hindsight bias; disguises policy as factual finding
- **Alternative**: Scope of the risk approach — focus on risks defendant consciously created
- **Tension**: Acosta — risk "barely cognizable" for mens rea but sufficient for causation?
- **Cultural lens**: Causation reflects deep assumptions about agency and responsibility

## 8) Hypo Triggers (Practice)

### Hypo 1: The Pre-Existing Condition (Stamp revisited)
D commits armed robbery, points gun at victim V (65, history of heart problems). V complies, D flees. V suffers heart attack from stress, dies.

**Analysis**:
- **Factual cause**: But-for robbery, no heart attack → Yes
- **Proximate cause**: Is heart attack foreseeable?
  - Stamp: Yes — "takes victim as he finds him"
  - Modern view: Probably yes — armed robbery creates stress, stress can trigger heart attack in vulnerable people
- **Mens rea**: D didn't intend death, wasn't conscious of heart-attack risk
- **Result**: Felony murder or depraved heart? Felony murder (Class 6) easier path

### Hypo 2: The Rescue Attempt (Arzon-style)
D sets fire to abandoned building. Firefighter F responds, enters building, roof collapses (not from fire but from pre-existing structural weakness), F dies.

**Analysis**:
- **Factual cause**: But-for arson, firefighter wouldn't be there → Yes
- **Proximate cause**: Is roof collapse foreseeable?
  - Arzon principle: Firefighters responding is foreseeable; they face structural risks
  - BUT: Roof collapse from pre-existing weakness, not fire, might be too remote
  - If fire weakened roof → foreseeable; if independent weakness → maybe too attenuated
- **Result**: Closer case than Arzon; depends on evidence linking fire to structural failure

### Hypo 3: The Bystander (Acosta-style)
D leads police on high-speed chase. Police car pursuing D runs red light, hits pedestrian crossing street, pedestrian dies.

**Analysis**:
- **Factual cause**: But-for chase, police car wouldn't be at intersection → Yes
- **Proximate cause**: Is pedestrian death foreseeable?
  - Acosta: Police chase creates "appreciable probability" of negligence
  - Police running red light to maintain pursuit is foreseeable risk
  - Pedestrian is "within range of apprehension" (unlike Acosta's helicopters)
- **Result**: Likely proximate cause; D liable for death

### Hypo 4: The Independent Criminal (Arzon contrast)
D robs victim V at knifepoint, takes wallet, flees. While V lying on ground shaken up, independent criminal X comes by, sees V vulnerable, robs V again, stabs V, V dies.

**Analysis**:
- **Factual cause**: But-for D's robbery, V wouldn't be vulnerable to X → Yes
- **Proximate cause**: Is X's independent attack foreseeable?
  - Not like Arzon (firefighter response is foreseeable risk of arson)
  - Independent criminal attack is not foreseeable consequence of robbery
  - Unlike Arzon, X's act is not "in furtherance of" or "response to" D's crime
- **Result**: X's independent acts likely superseding cause; D not liable for murder

### Hypo 5: The Medical Malpractice (classic hypo)
D shoots V in abdomen. V taken to hospital. Surgeon operates, commits malpractice (leaves sponge in V), V dies from infection, not from gunshot.

**Analysis**:
- **Factual cause**: But-for shooting, V wouldn't be in surgery → Yes
- **Proximate cause**: Is malpractice foreseeable?
  - Medical treatment is foreseeable response to shooting
  - BUT gross malpractice might be independent intervening act
  - Courts split: Some hold shooter liable (medical response foreseeable), some don't (malpractice too remote)
- **Key factor**: How egregious is malpractice? Minor negligence = still liable; gross negligence = might break chain
- **Result**: Fact-specific; modern trend: hold shooter liable unless malpractice is "completely outside foreseeable risks"

### Hypo 6: The Warner-Lambert Hypo (manufacturing)
D operates chemical plant, stores volatile chemicals negligently. Lightning strikes storage tank, explosion kills worker.

**Analysis**:
- **Factual cause**: But-for negligent storage, no explosion (lightning wouldn't cause explosion if chemicals properly stored) → Yes
- **Proximate cause**: Is lightning strike foreseeable?
  - Warner-Lambert: Need to foresee specific triggering mechanism
  - Lightning is "act of God" — not reasonably foreseeable
  - Unlike Arzon (human response), lightning is natural event
- **Result**: NOT proximate cause; lightning too remote/accidental

### Hypo 7: The MPC Scope of Risk (drug dealing)
D sells heroin to addict A. D knows A will use heroin, doesn't think about death. A uses heroin, dies from overdose (combined with alcohol A also drank).

**Analysis**:
- **MPC § 2.03(3)**: Recklessness/negligence case
- **Within risk?**: D aware of addiction risk; was death within that risk?
  - Modern courts: Often yes, overdose death foreseeable risk of heroin distribution
  - Scope-of-risk approach: Death from overdose not within scope of risk dealer created (dealer risked addiction, not death)
- **Burrage complication**: If heroin wasn't but-for cause (alcohol combination would have killed anyway), no factual cause
- **Result**: Jurisdictions split; MPC's "same kind of harm" test might reach either result

---

## 9) Predictions (explicit + falsifiable)

### Likely covered in class:
- Acosta's "highly extraordinary result" standard + mens rea split
- Arzon's treatment of independent intervening causes
- Warner-Lambert's "specific causal mechanism" requirement
- MPC § 2.03's systematic approach
- Distinction between factual and proximate cause
- Policy tensions: How bizarre is too bizarre?

### Likely cold-call targets:
- "What is the difference between factual cause and proximate cause?"
- "Was Acosta rightly decided? Should he be liable for helicopter collision?"
- "Why did Arzon hold defendant liable despite second fire being independent?"
- "How does MPC § 2.03 differ from common-law foreseeability approach?"
- "In Warner-Lambert, why wasn't the explosion foreseeable enough?"

### Likely policy debate:
- **Foreseeability vs. scope of risk**: Which approach better limits liability?
- **Cultural interpretation**: Do we treat human acts differently from natural events? Why?
- **Corporate liability**: Should corporations face murder liability for workplace accidents?
- **Mens rea/causation tension**: Acosta's split result — how can risk be sufficient for causation but insufficient for mens rea?

### Likely exam angle:
- **Causation is not neutral technical doctrine** — involves deep policy choices
- **Factual cause usually easy; legal cause where disputes arise**
- **Foreseeability is flexible standard** — no bright-line rules
- **Independent acts don't break chain if foreseeable** (Arzon)
- **MPC offers more systematic approach** — tie causation to culpability level
- **Connection to prior classes**: Mens rea (Class 3), Felony murder (Class 6), Kelman time-framing (Class 2)

### Likely hypo patterns:
- **Unusual physical events**: Helicopter crashes (Acosta), lightning strikes (Warner-Lambert)
- **Independent intervening acts**: Second fires (Arzon), medical malpractice, third-party crimes
- **Pre-existing conditions**: Heart attacks (Stamp), weakened structures
- **Rescue attempts**: Firefighters, police officers, Good Samaritans injured
- **Combinations**: Defendant creates risk, independent act exploits that risk

### Determining Criminal Liability for Result

```
START: Defendant's conduct → Result occurred
    ↓
STEP 1: Factual Cause (But-For Test)
    Question: But for defendant's conduct, would result have occurred?
    ├─ NO → NOT FACTUAL CAUSE → NOT LIABLE (generally)
    └─ YES → Factual cause established → Go to Step 2
    ↓
STEP 2: Legal Cause (Proximate Cause)
    Question: Is result sufficiently connected to conduct to justify liability?
    │
    └─ Foreseeability Approach (Acosta):
        ├─ Was result "highly extraordinary" or "remote or accidental"?
        │   ├─ YES → Not proximate cause → NOT LIABLE
        │   └─ NO → Proximate cause → Go to Step 3
        │
    OR  └─ Scope-of-Risk Approach:
        ├─ Was result within scope of risk defendant created?
        │   ├─ NO → Not proximate cause → NOT LIABLE
        │   └─ YES → Proximate cause → Go to Step 3
    ↓
STEP 3: Mens Rea Analysis
    Question: Did defendant have required culpability for result?
    │
    ├─ Purpose/Knowledge:
    │   └─ MPC § 2.03(2): Result within purpose/contemplation
    │       OR different victim/property
    │       OR same kind of harm not too remote
    │
    ├─ Recklessness:
    │   └─ MPC § 2.03(3): Result within risk defendant aware of
    │       OR different victim/property
    │       OR same kind of harm not too remote
    │
    └─ Negligence:
        └─ MPC § 2.03(3): Result within risk defendant should have been aware of
            OR different victim/property
            OR same kind of harm not too remote
    ↓
CONCLUSION: All three elements (factual cause + legal cause + mens rea) → GUILTY
```

### Key Decision Points

**Factual Cause**:
- Usually straightforward: "But for X, Y wouldn't have happened?"
- Exceptions: Overdetermination (two sufficient causes), pre-emptive causes, loss of chance (Burrage)

**Legal Cause**:
- Foreseeability: "Common sense of common man as to common things"
- Not "highly extraordinary" (Acosta)
- Independent acts don't break chain if foreseeable (Arzon)
- Specific mechanism must be foreseeable (Warner-Lambert)

**Mens Rea/Causation Interaction**:
- Acosta: Proximate cause satisfied but mens rea insufficient (risk "barely cognizable")
- MPC ties causation scope to culpability level: Purpose/knowledge broader than recklessness
- Felony murder (Class 6): Eliminates mens rea for result

### What's "Really Going On"? (Harcourt lens)

**Causation as cultural practice**:
- We choose which links in causal chain to emphasize
- We treat human agency differently from natural events
- We attribute responsibility based on moral judgments, not just physics

**Examples**:
- Campbell/Kevorkian suicide assistance: Victim's choice treated as "real" cause
- Doctor whose patient dies: Not blamed (usually) — we treat disease as cause
- Drug dealer whose buyer overdoses: Split decisions — is death within risk of dealing?

**Policy questions**:
- Are we holding people liable for results they controlled or results we blame them for?
- Does causation doctrine reflect objective facts or normative judgments?
- Should we adopt scope-of-risk approach to make link between culpability and causation clearer?

## 11) TA / Office Hours Questions
- For exam, should we apply MPC § 2.03 or common-law foreseeability unless told otherwise?
- How do we reconcile Acosta's mens rea/causation split — how can risk be sufficient for causation but insufficient for malice?
- In Arzon, would defendant still be liable if second fire was natural (lightning) rather than arson?
- Does Warner-Lambert's "specific causal mechanism" requirement apply beyond manufacturing contexts?
- For hypo analysis, is there a checklist we should run through for causation?
- How does causation in criminal law differ from tort law? Are standards the same?
- When we see unusual fact patterns (helicopter crashes, etc.), how do we know if result is "highly extraordinary"?
- Should we treat death of "vulnerable victims" (firefighters, police, bystanders) differently in causation analysis?

## 12) Connections to Prior Classes

### Class 2 — Actus Reus & Kelman Time-Framing
- **Act requirement**: Causation is element of actus reus — must be voluntary act that causes result
- **Time-framing**: When does act "begin" and "end"?
  - Acosta: Is entire chase "act" or does each maneuver create new act?
  - Arzon: Does arson "act" include period while firefighters respond?
- **Omissions**: Failure to act can cause result (notes discuss Muro — mother who didn't call doctor for beaten child)

### Class 3 — Mens Rea
- **Acosta split**: Proximate cause satisfied but malice (mens rea) insufficient
- **MPC § 2.03**: Ties causation scope to culpability level
  - Purpose/knowledge: Broader causation (result within contemplation)
  - Recklessness: Narrower causation (result within risk)
  - Negligence: Narrower (result within risk defendant should have been aware of)
- **Levels of culpability**: Different mental states shape which results we hold defendant responsible for

### Class 6 — Felony Murder
- **Strict liability**: Felony murder eliminates mens rea for result
- **Causation requirement**: Still need causal connection between felony and death
  - Agency theory: Felon/accomplice must do killing
  - Proximate cause theory: Death must be foreseeable result of felony
- **Stamp**: "Takes victim as he finds him" — broad causation for felony murder
- **Canola**: Agency theory limits causation to felon's own acts

### Class 7 — Accomplice Liability
- **Pinkerton rule**: Accomplice liable for foreseeable crimes committed by principal in furtherance of conspiracy
- **Causation through complicity**: Holding accomplice responsible for results they didn't directly cause
- **Foreseeability**: Same proximate cause analysis applies to accomplice liability

- [ ] Distinguish acts that break causal chain vs. acts that don't
- [ ] Discuss policy tensions in causation doctrine
- [ ] Explain relationship between causation and mens rea (Acosta puzzle)
- [ ] Connect causation to prior classes (felony murder, mens rea, actus reus, Kelman)

- **Total**: 120 minutes (2 hours)

**Key insights**:
- Causation seems technical but involves deep policy choices
- Factual cause usually easy; legal cause is battleground
- Foreseeability is flexible, not formulaic
- Independent acts don't break chain if foreseeable
- MPC ties causation to culpability levels
- Acosta's split result shows tension between causation and mens rea
