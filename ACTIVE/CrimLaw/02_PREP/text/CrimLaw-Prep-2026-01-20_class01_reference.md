## CORE THEMES

### Defining Justice

- **Central question**: How do we define justice for purposes of "criminal justice"?
- **Goal**: Develop personal definition to guide semester learning
- **Connection**: Bryan Stevenson's "just mercy" concept
  - Is it about mercy or justice?
  - Does "just" mean "simply" or relate to justice?

### Criminal Justice System Structure

- **Overview**: Process from arrest through appeal
- **Components**: Arraignments, grand juries, trial, appeal
- **Focus**: Understanding how the system operates in practice vs. theory

---

## EXPECTED PROFESSOR QUESTIONS (Q→A)

### Justice Definition Questions

**Q:** What is your definition of justice?

**Option A:** Justice protects individual rights and dignity while holding people accountable for their actions in a manner that is transparent and self-correcting.

**Option B:** Justice is treating people with dignity and proportionality, recognizing their full humanity and circumstances, while addressing harm to victims and society in ways that create opportunity for redemption and healing.

**Key considerations:**

- Fairness vs. mercy
- Procedural vs. substantive justice (is a "fair process" enough if outcomes are unjust?)
- Individual rights vs. societal needs
- Retribution vs. rehabilitation
- Equal treatment vs. recognition of context/circumstances

---

**Q:** How does the "justice" in "criminal justice" differ from other conceptions of justice?

**Option A:** Criminal justice is distinct because it involves the state's monopoly on legitimate violence and coercion—the power to deprive people of liberty or life. This makes questions of fairness, accuracy, and restraint uniquely critical, as errors are often irreversible and consequences are severe.

**Option B:** Criminal justice differs because it must balance multiple competing values: protecting society, punishing wrongdoing, deterring future crime, rehabilitating offenders, and respecting individual rights—all while operating through imperfect human institutions that reflect societal biases and power structures.

**Key considerations:**

- Legitimacy of punishment and state power
- Proportionality (does punishment fit crime?)
- Role of mercy in a justice system designed to punish
- Systemic fairness vs. individual outcomes
- Tension between finality (closure) and accuracy (getting it right)

---

### Just Mercy Questions

**Q:** What is the most unjust aspect of the Walter McMillian case?

**Option A:** The most unjust aspect was the knowing use of fabricated testimony by prosecutors. Ralph Myers was pressured to lie, the prosecutor knew it was false, yet they built a death penalty case on it anyway. This isn't a mistake—it's deliberate corruption of the truth-seeking process that defines criminal justice. When the state manufactures evidence to kill someone, the entire system loses legitimacy.

**Option B:** The most unjust aspect was the system's resistance to correction even after overwhelming evidence of innocence emerged. McMillian had 12+ alibi witnesses, the key witness recanted, yet he remained on death row for years because prosecutors and courts prioritized "finality" over truth. This reveals that the system is designed to convict, not to ensure accuracy—once it has you, it won't let go even when it knows it's wrong.

**Key considerations:**

- Prosecutorial misconduct (knowing use of false testimony)
- Racial bias (Black man, white victim, Alabama)
- Judge overriding jury's life sentence recommendation
- Suppression of exculpatory evidence
- Six years on death row despite clear innocence
- No accountability for wrongful conviction
- Community pressure and political motivations

---

**Q:** What is Bryan Stevenson's concept of "just mercy"?

**Option A:** "Just mercy" means that mercy is not opposed to justice—it IS justice. Stevenson argues that true justice requires seeing the full humanity of every person, including those accused of terrible crimes. The "just" means both "simply mercy" (giving mercy when we're tempted not to) and "justice through mercy" (recognizing that a system without compassion and context cannot be just). We judge ourselves by our treatment of the condemned.

**Option B:** "Just mercy" is Stevenson's argument that the criminal justice system is broken because it lacks mercy—it operates on a logic of pure retribution and dehumanization. Justice requires understanding people's circumstances (poverty, trauma, mental illness, racial oppression) and creating opportunities for redemption. A system that only punishes and never forgives isn't achieving justice; it's perpetuating cycles of harm.

**Key considerations:**

- Recognition of humanity in all people, including those accused
- Understanding context and circumstances that lead to crime
- Mercy as essential component of justice, not opposed to it
- System reform to address bias and unfairness
- Role of redemption and second chances
- Connection between "just" (simply) and "just" (justice)

---

**Q:** What criticisms might you have of Just Mercy?

**Option A:** The book focuses heavily on innocence cases like Walter McMillian, which are compelling but represent a tiny fraction of those imprisoned. This avoids the harder question: What about people who ARE guilty? Does Stevenson's framework of mercy and humanity apply to someone who committed the crime? By centering innocence narratives, the book may reinforce the idea that only the "innocent" deserve compassion, rather than challenging the system's overall brutality.

**Option B:** Stevenson emphasizes individual redemption stories and personal moral transformation, but gives less attention to structural and political solutions. How do we actually reform police departments, prosecutors' offices, and courts? The book might leave readers feeling inspired but unclear about what systemic changes would prevent these injustices—it's more about changing hearts than changing laws and institutions.

**Additional considerations:**

- Limited discussion of victims' perspectives and their justice needs
- Question of whether mercy can coexist with accountability
- Does the narrative style prioritize emotional appeal over policy analysis?
- Focus on death penalty may not address mass incarceration more broadly

1. **Pre-Trial**

   - Arrest
   - Arraignment (initial appearance, charges read, bail set)
   - Grand jury (indictment process)
   - Discovery
   - Plea bargaining
2. **Trial**

   - Jury selection
   - Opening statements
   - Presentation of evidence
   - Closing arguments
   - Jury deliberation
   - Verdict
3. **Post-Trial**

   - Sentencing

   - Clemency/pardon

### Capital Case Considerations

- Enhanced review process for death penalty cases
- Multiple levels of appellate review
- Federal habeas corpus review
- Clemency as final safeguard

## CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROCESS OVERVIEW

### Key Points from KSSB10 pp. 1-19

**The Funnel Effect**

- Large number of crimes committed
- Smaller number reported
- Even smaller number prosecuted
- Tiny fraction result in convictions

**Discretion at Every Stage**

- Police: whether to arrest
- Prosecutors: whether to charge, what charges
- Defense: trial strategy
- Judges: evidentiary rulings, sentencing
- Juries: verdict
- Appellate courts: which issues to review

**Systemic Issues to Watch For**

- Racial and economic disparities
- Plea bargaining pressure (95%+ of cases)
- Resource imbalances (prosecution vs. defense)
- Finality vs. accuracy tensions

## JUST MERCY DISCUSSION POINTS

### Walter McMillian Case Summary

**Facts:**

- Black man accused of murdering white woman in Alabama
- Sentenced to death based on testimony of known criminal
- Key witness later recanted, admitting to lying under pressure
- Alibi evidence (witnessed by 12+ people at church fundraiser) ignored
- Spent 6 years on death row before release

**Key Injustices:**

1. Racial bias permeated investigation and prosecution
2. Prosecutor withheld exculpatory evidence
3. Judge overrode jury recommendation of life imprisonment
4. System resisted correction despite clear evidence of innocence
5. No accountability for wrongful conviction

### Reflection Questions - Prepared Responses

**Most unjust moment:**

**Response A:** The moment when it's revealed that the prosecutor and judge knew Ralph Myers was lying but proceeded anyway. Myers told them repeatedly his testimony was coerced and false, yet they used it to seek the death penalty. This isn't incompetence—it's conscious evil. The system didn't fail; it worked exactly as designed to kill a Black man regardless of truth.

**Response B:** When McMillian's appeals were repeatedly denied despite overwhelming evidence of innocence. The legal system has mechanisms for correction—appeals, habeas corpus, post-conviction review—but they all failed because courts valued "finality" over accuracy. Judges wrote that even if he might be innocent, procedural rules prevented relief. The injustice isn't just the conviction; it's the system's refusal to fix its own obvious mistakes.

---

**Definition of "just mercy":**

**Interpretation A:** The phrase works on two levels—"just" as "simply" (merely showing mercy) and "just" as justice. Stevenson argues these aren't separate: showing mercy to the condemned IS what justice requires. We can't have a just system that doesn't account for humanity, context, and redemption. The system's brutality and dehumanization make it fundamentally unjust.

**Interpretation B:** "Just mercy" is Stevenson's counter to "law and order" rhetoric. Where tough-on-crime advocates say justice means harsh punishment, Stevenson says real justice means understanding why people commit crimes (poverty, abuse, mental illness, systemic racism) and responding with compassion. Mercy isn't weakness or permissiveness—it's what justice demands when you see people's full humanity.

---

**Personal criticism:**

**Criticism A:** The book's power comes from innocence narratives (McMillian, Trina, children sentenced to life), but this strategy has limits. It implies we should only care about injustice when someone is "innocent" or "sympathetic." What about someone who did commit murder but received the death penalty because of racial bias? Stevenson's approach might not help us think about justice for the actually guilty.

**Criticism B:** The book is long on stories of injustice but shorter on concrete solutions. Stevenson says we need to "change the narrative" and "recognize humanity," but how? What specific reforms would prevent another Walter McMillian? Should we abolish the death penalty? Eliminate prosecutorial immunity? Mandatory recording of interrogations? The book inspires outrage but doesn't give clear policy prescriptions.

---

**Personal definition of justice:**

**Definition A:** Justice is a system that treats all people with equal dignity, applies rules fairly regardless of race or wealth, prioritizes accuracy over convenience, and has meaningful mechanisms to correct its inevitable errors before they become irreversible.

**Definition B:** Justice is the proportionate response to harm that holds people accountable while maintaining their humanity, seeks to repair rather than merely punish, and structures itself to minimize bias and maximize the chance that outcomes reflect truth rather than power.
