## 1.5. CASE BRIEFS (Quick facts/reasoning/holding)

**Girouard v. State (1991):**
- **Issue:** Whether the types of provocation sufficient to mitigate murder to manslaughter should be limited to traditional categories, or decided by the factfinder on a case-by-case basis; specifically, whether words alone constitute adequate provocation.
- **Facts:** D stabbed wife 19 times after she taunted him during divorce argument ("lousy fuck," "remind me of my dad" [who abused her], wants divorce, filed abuse charges, threatened court martial). Wife was 5'1" 115 lbs; D was 6'2" 200+ lbs. D claimed provocation from words + minor physical contact (stepping on back, pulling hair).
- **Reasoning:** (1) Provocation must be "calculated to inflame passion of reasonable man and tend to cause him to act from passion rather than reason"; (2) Words alone not adequate unless accompanied by conduct indicating present intention/ability to cause bodily harm; (3) Wife's size/strength meant D could not reasonably fear harm; (4) Standard is objective reasonableness, not D's "peculiar frailties of mind"; (5) Social necessity — "cannot countenance holding that verbal domestic argument ending in death can result in manslaughter" (would incentivize killing over divorce).
- **Holding/Disposition:** Affirmed. Provocation inadequate as matter of law. Court leaves "to another day the possibility of expansion of the categories" but holds these facts don't warrant broadening.

**Maher v. People (1862):**
- **Issue:** (1) Whether provocation adequacy is a question of law for the court (categorical approach) or a question of fact for the jury; (2) Whether evidence of adultery committed within half hour before the assault should be admitted where D did not witness the act itself but saw them go into woods together and was told by friend they had intercourse.
- **Facts:** D charged with assault with intent to murder. D's wife and Hunt (victim) went into woods together; D saw them, followed, they emerged after 30 min. D followed Hunt to saloon; friend told D on the way that Hunt and wife had committed adultery day before. D entered saloon in agitated state, "great perspiration," shot Hunt (non-fatal wound). Trial court excluded evidence of adultery; convicted D of assault with intent to murder.
- **Reasoning:** (1) Provocation standard: act must be "under influence of passion produced by adequate/reasonable provocation, before reasonable time for blood to cool"; (2) What constitutes adequate provocation should be jury question, not rigid legal categories — "law cannot with justice assume to catalogue all the various facts and combinations of facts"; (3) "Provocations will be given without reference to any previous model, and the passions they excite will not consult the precedents"; (4) Jurors "from various classes and occupations of society" better qualified than judges to determine reasonableness; (5) Evidence here sufficient to go to jury (adultery within 30 min, D's excitement/hasty manner); (6) Cooling time also jury question, not law question.
- **Holding/Disposition:** Reversed and remanded for new trial. Evidence should have been admitted to jury for determination of whether provocation adequate. [Manning, J., dissenting: provocation must occur in defendant's presence].

**People v. Casassa (1980):**
- **Issue:** Whether EMED defense requires a purely subjective standard, or includes an objective reasonableness component; specifically, whether D's extreme emotional disturbance caused by victim's romantic rejection and his resulting obsession constitutes a "reasonable explanation or excuse."
- **Facts:** D and victim (Victoria Lo Consolo) met Aug 1976, dated casually. Nov 1976: she told him she was "not falling in love" with him; this "devastated" D. D then: (1) broke into apartment below hers multiple times to eavesdrop on her social life; (2) broke into her apartment while she was out, disrobed, lay in her bed, armed with knife (said he "was either going to hurt Victoria or Victoria was going to cause him to commit suicide"); (3) Feb 28, 1977: brought wine/liquor as gift, she rejected it, D stabbed her multiple times in throat with steak knife he brought, dragged body to bathroom, submerged in bathtub "to make sure she was dead." Bench trial. Defense psychiatrist: D obsessed, under EMED. Prosecution psychiatrist: D emotionally disturbed but not EMED because "stress he created from within himself, dealing mostly with a fantasy, a refusal to accept the reality."
- **Reasoning:** (1) NY statute adopted MPC §210.3(1)(b) EMED defense — broader than "heat of passion" (no immediate reaction required, can be "significant mental trauma" "simmering in unknowing subconscious"); (2) Two-part test: (a) Subjective — D must have actually acted under EMED (not contrived/sham); (b) Objective — "reasonable explanation or excuse" for the disturbance; (3) Objective component: view "subjective, internal situation" and "external circumstances as [D] perceived them" but assess whether explanation "reasonable" from that standpoint; (4) "Both subjective and objective elements" — gives "full scope" to mental trauma "while retaining some element of objectivity"; (5) Trial court properly found D's disturbance "so peculiar to him that it was unworthy of mitigation" — murder was "result of defendant's malevolence rather than an understandable human response deserving of mercy."
- **Holding/Disposition:** Affirmed. EMED defense failed. Court properly applied two-part test: accepted D was under EMED (subjective), but disturbance based on self-created fantasy/refusal to accept reality not objectively reasonable.

## 2. STATUTE / RULE (Core text to have ready)

**Common-Law Heat of Passion (Provocation) — Four Elements:**

1. **Adequate provocation** (objective) — would cause reasonable person to lose self-control
2. **Actually provoked** (subjective) — defendant actually did lose self-control
3. **No cooling time** — killing before reasonable time for passion to cool
4. **Causal connection** — killing resulted from passion, not calculation

**Traditional "adequate provocation" categories (Girouard):**
- Extreme assault or battery
- Mutual combat
- Illegal arrest
- Injury/abuse of close relative
- Sudden discovery of spouse's adultery (in flagrante delicto)

**Words alone:** NOT adequate provocation (majority rule)

**MPC §210.3(1)(b) — Extreme Mental or Emotional Disturbance (EMED):**

> "Criminal homicide constitutes manslaughter when... a homicide which would otherwise be murder is committed under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance for which there is reasonable explanation or excuse. The reasonableness of such explanation or excuse shall be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the actor's situation under the circumstances as he believes them to be."

**Key MPC Point:** No rigid categories, no cooling time, words alone CAN suffice. Two-part test: (1) subjective EMED, (2) reasonable explanation from actor's viewpoint.

**Source:** KSSB10 pp. 462-485, MPC §210.3

## 3. PROSECUTION ARGUMENTS (2-3 arguments)

**Argument 1: Words Alone Not Adequate (Girouard Rule)**
- Traditional categorical approach: words never sufficient for provocation
- Only specific categories count (assault, mutual combat, adultery, etc.)
- Policy: Prevents domestic violence; don't let killers claim taunting as excuse
- *Girouard*: "We cannot countenance holding that verbal domestic argument ending in death can result in manslaughter"

**Argument 2: No Reasonable Person Standard Met**
- Objective test: Would reasonable person lose self-control?
- Defendant's "peculiar frailties of mind" don't matter (majority rule)
- Facts show calculated response, not passion (e.g., multiple stabs, hiding weapon)
- Cooling time elapsed — passion should have subsided

**Argument 3: MPC EMED Not Satisfied (Casassa Standard)**
- Part 1 (subjective): Even if D under EMED, Part 2 fails
- Part 2 (objective reasonableness): Explanation "so peculiar to defendant that it was unworthy of mitigation"
- Self-created trauma based on fantasy/refusal to accept reality ≠ reasonable
- *Casassa*: Obsessive delusion doesn't justify mitigation

---

## 4. DEFENSE ARGUMENTS (2-3 arguments)

**Argument 1: Flexible Approach (Maher Rule)**
- Provocation adequacy should be jury question, not rigid categories
- Human passion too varied to catalogue — *Maher*: "provocations will be given without reference to any previous model"
- Words + long-term abuse + sudden rejection CAN provoke reasonable person
- Trust jury to determine community standards

**Argument 2: Actually Provoked + No Cooling**
- Subjective element clearly met — D actually lost self-control
- Time elapsed doesn't negate passion if "long-smoldering" (Berry exception)
- Passion can rekindle or build over time
- Immediate response to final provocation

**Argument 3: MPC EMED Satisfied**
- Part 1 (subjective): D under extreme mental or emotional disturbance — clear from facts
- Part 2 (reasonable explanation): View from "person in actor's situation under circumstances as he believes them to be"
- Long marital conflict / history of trauma / mental state = reasonable explanation from D's viewpoint
- MPC broader than common law — no rigid categories, no cooling time

## 5. POLICY HOOK (1 sentence)

The categorical vs flexible split reflects tension between predictable rules that prevent domestic violence (Girouard) and jury discretion that captures human complexity (Maher), with MPC's EMED standard expanding mitigation while retaining "reasonableness" check to exclude purely self-created delusions (Casassa).

## 6. PAST OUTLINE REFERENCE

**Past outline:** `Crim_Spring 2025_Harcourt_Full.docx.md`  
**Topic in INDEX:** "Homicide → Heat of Passion / Voluntary Manslaughter"  
**Location:** Lines 650-800 (approximate — search for "Girouard" or "provocation")

**Key outline points:**
- *Girouard* (categorical) vs *Maher* (flexible) = majority/minority split
- Feminist critique: Traditional categories reflect male honor culture
- MPC EMED abolishes rigid categories but retains objective "reasonableness"
- Partial justification vs partial excuse theories
- Exam tip: Argue both common law AND MPC; Harcourt tests two-regime analysis

**In-class lookup strategy:** Keep past outline open, CTRL+F for "heat of passion" or "EMED" when called on
