## 1. CASES FOR TODAY

**Purpose:** Watch Quimbee videos for these cases (include court/year to disambiguate)

### A. Vagueness Doctrine

- **Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville (U.S. Supreme Court, 1972)** — KSSB10 pp. 185-202
  - *Quimbee search:* "Papachristou v. Jacksonville 1972"
  - Topic: Vagrancy statute void for vagueness — failed to provide fair notice and allowed arbitrary enforcement

- **City of Chicago v. Morales (U.S. Supreme Court, 1999)** — KSSB10 pp. 185-202
  - *Quimbee search:* "City of Chicago v. Morales 1999"
  - Topic: Gang loitering ordinance void for vagueness — lacked adequate standards for enforcement and failed fair notice test

## 1.2. SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS (policy / institutions)

- **Bernard Harcourt, *Illusion of Order* (excerpts from Chapter 2 and Chapter 3)**
  - Local copy: `01_SOURCES/readings/05_constitutional_limits/Harcourt Illusion of Order Chap. 2.txt` and `Harcourt Illusion of Order 2001 Chapter 3.txt`
  - Topic: Critique of broken windows policing theory
  - Connection to *Morales*: Chicago's gang ordinance justified by broken windows theory (disorder breeds crime)
  - Key argument: "disorder" is socially constructed concept used to control marginalized communities
  - Empirical critique: studies supporting broken windows theory are methodologically flawed

---

## 1.5. CASE BRIEFS (Quick facts/reasoning/holding)

### **Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville (1972):**
- **Issue:** Is a vagrancy statute constitutional when it criminalizes loafing, wandering, or strolling without lawful purpose?
- **Facts:** Defendants arrested under Jacksonville vagrancy ordinance that prohibited multiple activities: loafing, wandering/strolling without lawful purpose, hanging around liquor establishments, common night walking, men "habitually living upon earnings of wives/minor children" despite being able to work.
- **Rule/Reasoning:** 
  - Vagueness doctrine (due process): criminal statute must give "person of ordinary intelligence fair notice" of what conduct is prohibited
  - Second prong: statute cannot give law enforcement "unfettered discretion" in enforcement
  - Jacksonville ordinance failed both prongs — terms like "wandering," "loafing," and "without lawful purpose" are inherently vague
  - Encourages arbitrary arrests based on subjective judgments about who "looks suspicious"
  - Historical context: vagrancy laws used to control poor, minorities, and marginalized groups
- **Holding:** Jacksonville vagrancy ordinance unconstitutional — violates due process vagueness doctrine.
- **Policy:** Protects freedom of movement and prevents discriminatory enforcement against poor/homeless.

### **City of Chicago v. Morales (1999):**
- **Issue:** Is an anti-gang loitering ordinance constitutional when it prohibits "remaining in any one place with no apparent purpose"?
- **Facts:** Chicago enacted gang ordinance with four predicates: (1) officer reasonably believes at least one person is gang member, (2) two or more persons loitering in public place, (3) officer issues dispersal order, (4) person disobeys dispersal order = criminal offense. Morales convicted under ordinance.
- **Statutory Language:** "Loitering" defined as "remaining in any one place with no apparent purpose."
- **Rule/Reasoning:** 
  - Plurality (Stevens): Ordinance violates due process — fails to provide minimum guidelines for enforcement
  - "No apparent purpose" is inherently vague — covers vast range of innocent conduct
  - Officers have absolute discretion to decide what counts as "loitering" vs. legitimate presence
  - No limiting construction possible — term is standardless
  - Arbitrary enforcement: officer decides whose "purpose" is legitimate based on subjective judgments
- **Holding:** Chicago gang loitering ordinance unconstitutional — void for vagueness (6-3 decision, fragmented opinions).
- **Concurrences:** 
  - O'Connor: ordinance might be saved with more specific definition of loitering and limitations on where ordinance applies
  - Kennedy/Breyer: focus on overbreadth (infringes right to free movement) rather than pure vagueness
- **Dissent (Scalia):** Ordinary person understands what "loitering" means; plurality reads statute unreasonably to strike it down based on policy preferences against anti-gang policing.
- **Policy Tension:** Public safety and gang control vs. freedom of movement and preventing discriminatory enforcement in minority communities.

## 2. PRINCIPLES / RULES (Core doctrines)

### **A. Vagueness Doctrine (Due Process Clause)**

**Core Principle:** A criminal statute violates due process if it is so vague that persons of ordinary intelligence cannot understand what conduct is prohibited OR if it permits arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.

**Constitutional Source:** Fifth/Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause

**Two-Part Test:**

**1. Fair Notice Prong**
- Statute must give "person of ordinary intelligence fair notice" that particular conduct is prohibited
- Reasons: (a) individual autonomy (can plan conduct to avoid criminal liability), (b) rule of law (not governed by arbitrary power)
- *Papachristou*: terms like "wandering," "loafing," "without lawful purpose" provide no meaningful notice
- *Morales*: "no apparent purpose" is standardless — ordinary person cannot determine what qualifies

**2. Arbitrary Enforcement Prong**
- Statute must provide law enforcement with adequate standards/guidelines for enforcement
- Cannot give police "unfettered discretion" to decide who violates statute
- Prevents discriminatory enforcement based on officer's subjective preferences
- *Papachristou*: vagrancy law allows arrest based on appearance, suspicion, or prejudice
- *Morales*: officer has absolute discretion to decide whose "purpose" is legitimate

**Relationship to Legality Principle:**
- Vagueness doctrine overlaps with legality principle (fair notice requirement)
- Legality = statutory construction problem (how to interpret ambiguous statute)
- Vagueness = constitutional problem (statute is so unclear it violates due process)
- Both require strict construction in favor of defendant (rule of lenity)

---

### **B. Broken Windows Theory (Policy Context)**

**Core Theory (Wilson & Kelling, 1982):** "Disorder and crime are inextricably linked, in a kind of developmental sequence."

**Causal Claim:** Minor disorders (littering, loitering, public drinking, panhandling, prostitution) → signal that no one is in charge → attract crime → neighborhood decline.

**Policy Prescription:** Police should resume "order-maintenance function" — focus on visible signs of disorder rather than serious crime. Foot patrol officers enforce civility norms and maintain good order.

**Application to *Morales*:** Chicago justified gang ordinance as implementing broken windows theory — gang loitering is visible disorder that signals community breakdown and invites crime.

**Insider/Outsider Dichotomy (from Wilson & Kelling):**

| Category | Regulars | Strangers |
|---|---|---|
| **Ordered** | Decent folk | Visitors |
| **Disordered** | Drunks/derelicts | Criminals |

- Theory assumes crime comes from "outside" community (criminal invasion)
- Order-maintenance policing = control disorderly insiders, exclude disorderly outsiders
- Critics: dichotomy stigmatizes marginalized groups as inherently disorderly

---

### **C. Harcourt's Critique of Broken Windows**

**Empirical Critique:**
1. **Weak Evidence:** Studies cited to support broken windows (Skogan 1990, Sampson & Cohen 1988) are methodologically flawed
2. **Missing Data:** Skogan's study patched together five inconsistent datasets; robbery victimization available in only 30 neighborhoods
3. **Causation Problem:** Even if correlation exists between disorder and crime, doesn't prove disorder *causes* crime (could be reverse causation or common cause)
4. **Alternative Explanations:** Any crime reduction from order-maintenance policing could result from increased police presence (not social meaning of order)

**Theoretical Critique:**
1. **Socially Constructed Disorder:** "Disorder" is not objective fact but socially constructed category shaped by existing power relations
2. **Used for Social Control:** Concept of disorder manipulated to justify surveillance and policing of poor/minority communities
3. **Reinforces Hierarchies:** Order/disorder dichotomy reinforces existing social hierarchies (who counts as "decent folk" vs. "disorderly people")
4. **False Promise:** Order-maintenance policing doesn't address underlying structural causes of crime (poverty, inequality, lack of opportunity)

**Connection to Vagueness:**
- If "disorder" is socially constructed, then laws prohibiting "disorderly conduct" or "loitering" give police discretion to enforce dominant group's vision of order
- *Morales* ordinance = vehicle for controlling marginalized youth (especially Black/Latino) in public spaces
- Vagueness doctrine limits this discretion by requiring clear legislative standards

---

## 3. PROSECUTION ARGUMENTS (2-3 arguments)

### **On Vagueness (Defending Ordinances Like *Morales*)**

**Argument 1: Ordinary Meaning Standard — "Loitering" Has Clear Common-Sense Definition**
- Scalia dissent in *Morales*: ordinary person understands what "loitering" means (hanging around without purpose)
- Chicago ordinance incorporated common-law definition used for centuries
- "No apparent purpose" should be read reasonably — officer observes objective behavior (standing, sitting, no visible activity)
- Plurality reads statute unreasonably to strike down ordinance based on policy disagreement with gang enforcement

**Argument 2: Context Narrows Scope — Ordinance Limited to Gang Members in High-Crime Areas**
- Officer must reasonably believe at least one person is gang member (first predicate)
- Ordinance targets specific group (gang members) in specific contexts (public loitering)
- Not criminalizing all loitering — only gang loitering that threatens public safety
- Sufficient limiting construction: "loitering" means remaining without legitimate reason when officer reasonably suspects gang activity

**Argument 3: Public Safety Justifies Broad Discretion — Gangs Pose Unique Threat**
- Broken windows theory: visible gang presence creates fear, signals community breakdown, invites crime
- Gang loitering used for intimidation, turf control, drug trafficking
- Officers need discretion to intervene before violence erupts
- Alternative: wait until gang members commit serious crime (by then victims already harmed)

---

## 4. DEFENSE ARGUMENTS (2-3 arguments)

### **On Vagueness (Challenging Ordinances Like *Morales*)**

**Argument 1: "No Apparent Purpose" Is Inherently Standardless — Criminalizes Innocent Conduct**
- Vast range of innocent activities have "no apparent purpose" from outsider's perspective
- Standing on corner waiting for friend? Sitting on stoop reading? Walking slowly down street?
- Officer's subjective judgment about "purpose" determines criminality
- No objective standard — violates fair notice and invites arbitrary enforcement

**Argument 2: Arbitrary Enforcement = Tool for Discriminatory Policing**
- *Papachristou* history: vagrancy laws used to control poor, Black people, labor organizers
- *Morales* context: ordinance disproportionately enforced in minority neighborhoods against Black/Latino youth
- Vague statutes give police discretion to arrest based on race, appearance, neighborhood
- Structural inequality: marginalized groups policed more heavily for same conduct as dominant groups

**Argument 3: Freedom of Movement — Criminalization of Presence in Public Spaces**
- Ordinance effectively gives police power to clear streets of "undesirable" people
- Young Black/Latino men cannot stand on street corner in own neighborhood without risk of arrest
- Echoes status crimes (*Robinson*, *Powell*, *Grants Pass*): criminalizing poverty/marginalized identity rather than harmful conduct
- Constitutional right to occupy public spaces without government interference (freedom of movement, First Amendment associational rights)

---

### **On Broken Windows Theory (Harcourt Critique)**

**Argument 4: Broken Windows Theory Is Empirically Unsupported and Socially Harmful**
- No reliable evidence that minor disorder causes serious crime (Harcourt's replication shows Skogan data flawed)
- Order-maintenance policing may reduce crime through increased police presence (not social meaning)
- "Disorder" is subjective — reflects dominant group's preferences, not objective threat
- Disproportionate harm: order-maintenance policing = over-policing of poor/minority communities without corresponding crime reduction benefit
- Alternative explanation for NYC crime drop (1990s): national crime trends, economic growth, NOT quality-of-life policing

---

## 5. POLICY HOOK (1-2 sentences)

The vagueness doctrine protects liberty by requiring clear legislative standards and preventing arbitrary enforcement, but *Morales* shows the doctrine's limits when cities use order-maintenance policing (justified by broken windows theory) to control public spaces; Harcourt's critique argues that "disorder" is socially constructed to legitimize surveillance of marginalized communities, raising fundamental questions about whose vision of order criminal law enforces.

---

## 6. HARCOURT CLASSROOM MOVES (What to expect)

**Vagueness Module:**
- Expect prosecution/defense role-play on *Morales* — argue whether "no apparent purpose" is sufficiently clear
- He may ask: "How would you draft a gang loitering ordinance that passes vagueness test?" (tests whether limiting construction possible)
- Comparative reading: *Papachristou* (broad vagrancy law) vs. *Morales* (targeted gang ordinance) — does narrower scope cure vagueness?
- Scalia dissent discussion: "Is the plurality striking down the ordinance because it's vague, or because they don't like gang enforcement policies?"

**Broken Windows Module:**
- He will likely assign reading of his own article (*Illusion of Order*) — expect in-depth discussion
- Critical theory frame: How does broken windows theory construct certain groups as inherently "disorderly"?
- Empirical question: "What evidence supports the claim that disorder causes crime?" (Answer: weak evidence, Harcourt's replication shows)
- Policy question: "If broken windows is wrong, what alternative approach should we take to gang violence and urban crime?"
- Foucault connection: Order-maintenance policing as disciplinary mechanism that shapes subjects (who is "disorderly" becomes internalized identity)

**Insider/Outsider Analysis:**
- He may ask students to map *Morales* facts onto Wilson & Kelling's insider/outsider grid
- Gang members = disorderly insiders (need to be controlled) or disorderly outsiders (need to be excluded)?
- "Who decides who counts as 'decent folk' vs. 'disorderly people'?" (Power question)

**Connection to Earlier Topics:**
- Vagueness doctrine + legality principle (*Keeler*, *Rogers*) = family of fair notice requirements
- Status crimes (*Robinson*, *Powell*, *Grants Pass*) + vagueness (*Papachristou*, *Morales*) = constitutional limits on criminalizing poverty/marginalized identities

## 7. PAST OUTLINE REFERENCE

**Past outline:** `Crim_Spring 2025_Harcourt_Full.docx.md`  
**Topic in INDEX:** "Constitutional Limits → Vagueness" and "Punishment Theory → Broken Windows"  
**Location:** Search for "Papachristou" or "Morales" or "vagueness doctrine"

**Key outline points:**
- Vagueness doctrine two-part test: fair notice + arbitrary enforcement
- *Papachristou*: vagrancy law void for vagueness (criminalizes innocent conduct, allows discriminatory enforcement)
- *Morales*: gang ordinance void for vagueness — "no apparent purpose" is standardless
- Scalia dissent: ordinary meaning of "loitering" provides sufficient notice
- Broken windows theory: disorder → fear → crime (Wilson & Kelling)
- Harcourt critique: 
  - Empirical: studies are flawed, no reliable evidence disorder causes crime
  - Theoretical: disorder is socially constructed to control marginalized groups
  - Order-maintenance policing = disciplinary mechanism targeting poor/minorities
- Connection to *Grants Pass*: criminalization of poverty/homelessness
- Policy frame: public safety vs. discriminatory enforcement

**In-class lookup strategy:** Keep past outline open, CTRL+F for "vagueness" or "Morales" or "broken windows" when called on

## 8. EXAM TIPS

**Issue-Spotter Application:**
1. **Vagueness Challenge:** If statute uses terms like "loitering," "vagrancy," "disorderly conduct," "without lawful purpose" → analyze under two-prong vagueness test
2. **Fair Notice:** Does statute give ordinary person notice of prohibited conduct? List examples of innocent conduct potentially covered.
3. **Arbitrary Enforcement:** Does statute give police meaningful standards, or can officer arrest based on subjective judgments?
4. **Discriminatory Impact:** Note if statute disproportionately enforced against poor/minorities (historical pattern from *Papachristou*)
5. **Limiting Construction:** Can statute be narrowed to pass vagueness test? Or is core term inherently standardless?

**Policy Essay:**
- Vagueness doctrine as safeguard against police discretion and discriminatory enforcement
- Tension: public safety (gang control) vs. liberty (freedom of movement, protection from arbitrary arrest)
- Broken windows theory as justification for order-maintenance policing
- Harcourt critique: disorder is socially constructed; order-maintenance policing harms marginalized communities
- Race and class dimensions: who is labeled "disorderly"? Whose "order" does law enforce?
- Alternatives: address root causes (poverty, inequality) rather than criminalize visible poverty

**Harcourt's Preferences:**
- He values critical theory arguments — Foucault, social construction of disorder
- Emphasize empirical critique of broken windows (his own scholarship)
- Apply insider/outsider analysis to fact patterns
- Note racial/class dimensions of enforcement
- Connect to status crimes, criminalization of poverty themes

**Past Exam Appearance:**
- 2024 Spring Exam featured anti-gang ordinance similar to *Morales* — students analyzed under vagueness doctrine and status crime ban
- Model answers used *Robinson*, *Powell*, *Morales* framework
- Emphasized discriminatory enforcement, arbitrary standards, and broken windows critique
