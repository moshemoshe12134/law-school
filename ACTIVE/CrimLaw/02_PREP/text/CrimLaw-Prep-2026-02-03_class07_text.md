## 2. STATUTE / RULE (Core text to have ready)

**MPC § 2.02(2)(c) — Recklessness:**

> A person acts recklessly with respect to a material element of an offense when he consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct. The risk must be of such a nature and degree that, considering the nature and purpose of the actor's conduct and the circumstances known to him, its disregard involves a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a law-abiding person would observe in the actor's situation.

**Key language:** "consciously disregards" + "substantial and unjustifiable risk"

**Three Gradations:**

1. **Extreme Recklessness (Murder):** Conscious disregard + "extreme indifference to human life"
2. **Recklessness (Manslaughter):** Conscious disregard of substantial risk, but not extreme
3. **Negligence (Negligent Homicide):** Should have been aware of substantial risk (no actual awareness)

**Source:** MPC § 2.02, KSSB10 pp. 490-513

## 3. PROSECUTION ARGUMENTS (2-3 arguments)

**Argument 1: Conscious Disregard Standard Met**

- Defendant knew there was a substantial risk of death (Russian roulette in Malone has noticable chance of death).
- Key phrase: "Consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk."
- Why it works: MPC § 2.02(2)(c) requires awareness, which is established by defendant's own understanding of risk.

**Argument 2: Extreme Indifference to Human Life**

- Playing Russian roulette or creating death trap (Welansky nightclub) shows extreme indifference beyond ordinary recklessness.
- This elevates from manslaughter to murder.
- Why it works: "Gross deviation from standard of conduct" + high probability of death = extreme recklessness.

**Argument 3: No Need for Intent**

- Murder doesn't require purpose to kill; extreme recklessness is enough.
- Distinguish from purposeful killings covered in earlier classes.

---

## 4. DEFENSE ARGUMENTS (2-3 arguments)

**Argument 1: Risk Not as Substantial as Prosecution Claims**

- In Welansky, defendant may not have been aware that exits were locked or risk was so high.
- Distinguish actual awareness (recklessness) from should-have-known (negligence).
- Key phrase: "Consciously disregards" requires actual awareness, not constructive knowledge.

**Argument 2: No Extreme Indifference**

- Even if reckless, not all recklessness is murder-level.
- Must show "extreme indifference to human life" — a very high bar.
- Why it works: Manslaughter is the default for reckless killings; prosecution must prove the "extreme" element.

**Argument 3: Negligence, Not Recklessness (Williams Defense)**

- Defendant didn't actually foresee the risk (doctor failing to treat child's toothache).
- This is negligence (should have known) not recklessness (did know).
- Maximum liability: negligent homicide, not manslaughter or murder.

---

## 5. POLICY HOOK (1 sentence)

The tension is between holding defendants accountable for unintended deaths when they knowingly took major risks vs. requiring actual intent to kill before imposing murder liability.

## 6. PAST OUTLINE REFERENCE

**From:** Harcourt_Condesned Crim Outline.docx.md

**Key points professor might expect:**

- Extreme recklessness murder requires "extreme indifference to human life" (not just awareness of risk)
- Three-part test: awareness (subjective), risk level (objective), care demonstrated (objective)
- Kelman time-framing applies: narrow frame (just the act) vs. broad frame (including lead-up choices)
