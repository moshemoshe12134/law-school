### Deterrence and EED Defense for Femicide

**Context**: Discussion of Extreme Emotional Disturbance (EED) defense in intimate partner homicide cases.

**Professor's Position**: The professor suggested that deterrence isn't a significant concern with these defendants because they are "disturbed" individuals.

**My Counterargument**: I disagree with dismissing deterrence entirely. While I acknowledge that many individuals who commit intimate partner homicide may be emotionally disturbed, the threat of severe consequences (murder vs. manslaughter) can still deter many potential killers who are contemplating violence.

**Alternative Theory on Deterrence**: My concern is more nuanced than general deterrence. The standard deterrence rationale assumes we give harsh murder sentences because we fear the defendant might kill *anyone*—that they pose a general threat to society. However, a defendant who commits intimate partner homicide under extreme emotional disturbance is typically NOT an indiscriminate killer or assassin. They are already deterred from killing most people in most situations.

The key insight: **This defendant is only at risk of killing in extremely specific circumstances** (intimate relationships with particular emotional dynamics). If the defendant poses a threat only in such narrow circumstances, does this justify the same level of punitive sentencing that we'd impose on someone who poses a broader threat to society?

**Questions for Discussion**:
1. Should the calculus of deterrence consider the *scope* of future danger (specific vs. general threat) rather than just the *likelihood* of future danger?
2. If a defendant is already naturally deterred from 99% of potential homicides (due to the specificity of their risk factors), does that argue for a more lenient sentence even from a deterrence perspective?
3. How do we balance this individualized risk assessment with the need for consistent sentencing and the symbolic/expressive function of criminal law?
