## 1. STATUTE/RULE AS HARCOURT FRAMED IT

### A. Model Penal Code Felony Murder Presumption (Recap)

**Harcourt's key teaching:** MPC creates a *presumption* of extreme recklessness when defendant is engaged in a felony, rather than strict liability.

**How the presumption works (MPC § 1.12(5)):**
1. When evidence shows defendant committed a felony (the "facts giving rise to the presumption")
2. The issue of extreme recklessness must go to the jury
3. Jury is instructed that "the law declares that the jury may regard the facts giving rise to the presumption as sufficient evidence of the presumed fact"
4. But jury doesn't *have to* accept the presumption

**Harcourt's distinction:**
> "What's the difference? What would be the difference technically between a statute that simply says, It's Felony murder if the... If you find that the felony occurred and this... the Model Penal Code is trying to, trying to, trying to create some light between. Automatically saying it's felony murder and something about a presumption, right?"

**The "light" between automatic felony murder and MPC:**
- Pure strict liability: Jury just finds felony → automatic murder conviction
- MPC presumption: Jury finds felony → may presume extreme recklessness → but can reject the presumption
- Gives jury option to say "we're not sure this crime amounts to extreme recklessness"

**Harcourt's assessment:**
> "It's pretty thin, it's a pretty thin distinction... given the way the presumption Works in the general part, it seems pretty preclusive. It doesn't seem, I mean, it would be... it was a nice attempt at trying to create some light. But I'm not sure it really works."

### B. Agency Theory vs. Proximate Cause Theory — State v. Canola Framework

**Agency Theory (defense-friendly, narrower):**
- Felony murder rule does NOT extend to killings attributable to someone OUTSIDE the unlawful enterprise
- Defendant only liable when defendant or a co-participant kills
- "Culpability matters" — must be acting as agent in furtherance of defendant's criminal project

**Proximate Cause Theory (prosecution-friendly, broader):**
- Liability attaches to ANY death proximately resulting from the unlawful activity
- Defendant liable even when victim, police, or bystander does the killing
- Focus on foreseeability and "in furtherance of" the crime

**Harcourt's Matrix (exam tool):**

| WHO KILLS | Victim | Innocent Bystander | Co-Defendant Victim |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Defendant** | Both theories = liable | Both theories = liable | Query under both |
| **Co-Defendant** | Both theories = liable | Proximate = liable / Agency = query | Proximate = liable / Agency = NO LIABILITY |
| **Victim (target of felony)** | N/A | Proximate = liable / Agency = NO LIABILITY | Proximate = liable / Agency = NO LIABILITY |
| **Police Officer** | Proximate = liable / Agency = NO LIABILITY | Proximate = liable / Agency = NO LIABILITY | Proximate = liable / Agency = NO LIABILITY |
| **Innocent Bystander** | Proximate = liable / Agency = NO LIABILITY | Proximate = liable / Agency = NO LIABILITY | Proximate = liable / Agency = NO LIABILITY |

**Key agency theory arguments (defense):**
- No principal-agency relationship when third party (victim/police/bystander) does killing
- Death not "in furtherance of" defendant's criminal enterprise
- Co-defendant's death doesn't aid the crime — "it's not what we wanted"
- Culpability should matter in criminal law (not just tort-style proximate cause)

**Key proximate cause arguments (prosecution):**
- All deaths foreseeable when engaging in dangerous felony
- When you rob with guns, resistance is foreseeable
- Police intervention is foreseeable
- Flight from police is "in furtherance of" the crime (part of same criminal transaction)

**Harcourt's specific note on justifiable homicides:**
> Defense argument: "if this homicide is, um, legal, um, there, there is no like criminal homicide, uh, at the first place... So, um, it is kind of like unfair to punish, um, Canola for a lawful act by someone else." (Echoes Coke's Institutes — lawful vs. unlawful killing distinction)

---

### C. Statutory Approaches — Who Gets Knocked Out

**New York Penal Law approach:**
> "in course in furtherance of designated felony, he or another participant... causes the death of a person other than one of the participants"

**Effect:** Death of co-defendant victims = NO LIABILITY

**New Jersey approach:**
> "any person... Causes the death of any person other than one of the participants"

**Effect:** Death of co-defendant victims = NO LIABILITY (same result)

#EXAM_SIGNAL — Use the matrix to analyze statutes and determine which "boxes" of liability apply

---

### D. Temporal Dimension Issues — Baxter Case Analysis

**Key temporal question:** When does the felony END for purposes of felony murder?

**Baxter facts:** Defendant breaking into cars → arrested/in custody → co-defendant flees and kills cyclists

**Defense arguments (strongest):**
1. **Already in custody:** "if he was already in handcuffs whether or not he could have been held liable for a death that occurred while he was already in custody"
2. **Different crime:** Co-defendant committing separate crime (evading arrest), not the original felony (breaking into cars)
3. **No longer performing unlawful activity:** "because he was in handcuffs he was no longer performing that unlawful activity so I would imagine that there was no transfer of that mens rea"
4. **Not in furtherance:** Death doesn't aid the car break-ins

**Prosecution response:**
> "in felony and murder cases... felonies should be considered... same transactional occurrence... running away from the police is a an integral part of committing any sort of felony"

**Harcourt's complicity analogy:**
- Accomplice before the fact vs. after the fact
- Used to be: helping fugitive after crime = accomplice to original crime
- Modern rule: harboring fugitive = separate crime, not part of original robbery
- Temporal break between original crime and subsequent acts

**Exam issue:** Where is the temporal line? When does felony end?

#EXAM_SIGNAL — Temporal dimension of felony murder will be tested; know when felony "ends"

---

### E. Reckless/Unintended Homicide — Murder vs. Manslaughter

**MPC Framework:**

**Murder (§ 210.2):**
- Committed recklessly "under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life"
- Extreme recklessness

**Manslaughter (§ 210.3):**
- Committed recklessly
- Simple recklessness (not extreme)

**Key distinction: Extreme recklessness vs. simple recklessness**

---

### F. Commonwealth v. Malone — Russian Roulette Case

**Facts:** 17-year-old defendant, 13-year-old victim (Billy), revolver with 5 chambers, one bullet, defendant pulled trigger 3 times, third pull killed victim

**Core legal issue:** Was this murder (extreme recklessness) or manslaughter (recklessness)?

**The gun mechanics dispute:**
- Defendant put bullet in "first chamber on the right"
- Believed cylinder rotated clockwise (like most Smith & Wesson guns)
- If clockwise: could pull trigger 4 times safely before reaching bullet
- Problem: Gun fired on 3rd pull (doesn't make sense if clockwise)
- Possible explanations: (1) counterclockwise rotation, (2) defendant miscounted chambers, (3) cylinder flipped when closing, (4) another bullet in gun

**Risk quantification:**
- Court found: 3 out of 5 = 60% chance of death
- Each random pull = 20% chance
- Three pulls = cumulative 60% risk

#EXAM_SIGNAL — Malone is one of the rare cases where risk is actually quantifiable; use for risk analysis framework

---

## 2. ARGUMENTS HARCOURT PUSHED

### A. Prosecution Arguments (Malone)

**Arg 1: Objective awareness — should have known**
- "you're meant to treat guns as loaded, even if you are 100% certain that they're not. This is fairly common knowledge"
- Even if defendant didn't know, "he should have known it or he should have known that he shouldn't have been handling a loaded weapon"

**Arg 2: Knew the risk — gun + bullet = death**
- "he knew that this was a gun. Guns are meant to kill people. He knew that this was a gun that had a bullet in it"
- "You had to be aware of the risk and the risk here is pretty much off the freaking charts. We're talking about 60% chance here of the gun going off"

**Arg 3: Didn't know full situation**
- "he didn't know how the gun was handled. There was something in the afternoon before the firing of the gun... he didn't know whether there was only one bullet or more"
- Gun wasn't in his possession the whole time — could have been additional bullets

**Arg 4: Pulled trigger intentionally**
- Not contesting: he intentionally pulled the trigger three times
- Intentional act with known dangerous instrument

---

### B. Defense Arguments (Malone)

**Arg 1: Subjective unawareness — didn't know the risk**
- "in his mind he believed there was no chance that there was a bullet that he was actually fired"
- "he was dead certain that there wasn't any risk. Because of where he put the live bullet"
- Recklessness requires CONSCIOUS disregard — "it wasn't in his consciousness"

**Arg 2: Exercised care**
- Deliberately put bullet in specific chamber believing it was safe position
- Thought he could pull trigger 4 times safely with clockwise rotation
- "he did exercise some kind of care, obviously not enough"

**Arg 3: Unforeseeable outcome**
- "the outcome of that action was unintended. And in fact, like you could argue unforeseeable as well"
- If bullet in first chamber right, clockwise rotation, shouldn't have fired on 3rd pull
- "I just don't understand why... it's typical that a gun would fire just one chamber at a time"

**Arg 4: Not defendant's bullet/gun**
- "it was the deceased's father's bullet, right?"
- Defendant "went to the diner with an empty gun"
- "It's the victim who brought that bullet from his father's military arsenal"
- Tragedy, but defendant didn't bring the dangerous element

**Arg 5: Wrong mens rea standard**
- Prosecution arguing "should have known" = negligence standard
- "whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, we're not in this, we're not in any, we're not in the civil domain and we're not in the negligence domain"
- Not negligent homicide — charged with murder/manslaughter requiring recklessness
- Recklessness requires AWARENESS, not just "should have been aware"

---

### C. Agency vs. Proximate Cause Arguments

**Defense — Agency Theory:**

**Arg 1: No agency relationship**
- "there need to be two people, and one person is the principal, the other person is the agent, the other person is doing things in furtherance of the principal's directions, and intentions"
- Victim/police/bystander not acting as defendant's agent
- Not doing something "for you. In furtherance of your project"

**Arg 2: Not in furtherance of crime**
- When co-defendant gets killed: "that wasn't in furtherance of our agency relationship here"
- "the fact that co-defendant got killed doesn't help us. It's not what we wanted. It doesn't aid us, it's not in furtherance of our crime"

**Arg 3: Culpability matters**
- "there's a difference" between civil law (proximate cause) and criminal law (agency/culpability)
- "somebody who's gonna be put away for life for murder"
- Should require actual culpable connection to the death

**Arg 4: Justifiable homicide exception**
- When victim kills co-defendant in self-defense: "the homicide itself is, um, is, is lawful"
- "if this homicide is, um, legal, um, there, there is no like criminal homicide"
- "kind of like unfair to punish... Canola for a lawful act by someone else"
- Echoes Coke's Institutes: distinction between lawful and unlawful killings

**Prosecution — Proximate Cause:**

**Arg 1: Foreseeability**
- "when you and a gang of robbers walking into a store with arms uh with guns, you should probably expect resistance from either the target, the owner of the store, or if the police gets involved, the police or innocent bystanders who also happen to be armed"
- "all of this is kind of foreseeable, right?"

**Arg 2: In furtherance**
- Deaths during felony are "in furtherance of" the criminal enterprise
- Flight from police is part of same transaction

**Arg 3: Same criminal transaction**
- Fleeing = "integral part of committing any sort of felony"
- Should "merge the uh escape the the police chase into the original crime and say that's all part of one thing"

## 4. MAGIC WORDS / PHRASES

**Harcourt's exact language (use on exam):**

### Felony Murder

- **"Create some light between"** — when discussing distinctions that are thin but legally significant (e.g., MPC presumption vs. strict liability)

- **"In furtherance of"** — key phrase for both agency theory and temporal scope
  - "that notion of furtherance... is very similar to our contemporary notion of foreseeability... although it's actually even more closely tied in some way than simple foreseeability... almost seems as if there's an element of intentionality in it"

- **"Same transactional occurrence"** — prosecution argument for including flight/escape in original felony

- **"Principal-agency relationship"** — defense framework for agency theory
  - "For a principal agency relationship to exist, there need to be two people, and one person is the principal, the other person is the agent"

- **"Someone who you wouldn't have exactly expected to be the one who was causing death"** — framing for third-party killer cases

- **"Lawful vs. unlawful acts"** — foundational distinction from Coke's Institutes still relevant

### Recklessness

- **"Consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk"** — MPC definition of recklessness

- **"Extreme indifference to the value of human life"** — what elevates recklessness to murder

- **"Should have known" vs. "was aware"** — objective (negligence) vs. subjective (recklessness) standards

- **"Treat guns as loaded"** — objective standard argument

- **"The outcome... was unintended"** — defense framing for unintentional killings

- **"Quantifiable risk"** — Malone's unique feature (60% = 3/5)

- **"Not negligent homicide"** — defense objection when prosecution argues "should have known"

### Analytical Framework

- **"Subjective vs. objective"** — first dimension of recklessness analysis

- **"Low risk vs. high risk"** — second dimension

- **"How much care did you put into this"** — third dimension

- **"We're not in the civil domain"** — defense objection to proximate cause/tort standards

- **"Culpability matters"** — defense theme for criminal law vs. civil law

---

## 5. PREWRITE FRAGMENTS

### Fragment 1: Agency vs. Proximate Cause — Analytical Framework

**Issue:** Defendant liable for death during felony when victim/police/bystander (not defendant or co-defendant) does the killing?

**Two competing theories:**

**Agency Theory (narrower):**
- Felony murder rule extends only to killings by defendant or co-participants
- Requires principal-agency relationship
- Death must be "in furtherance of" defendant's criminal project
- When third party kills: no agency, no liability
- Rationale: Culpability matters in criminal law; defendant not morally responsible for independent acts of third parties

**Proximate Cause Theory (broader):**
- Liability for any death proximately caused by the felony
- Focus on foreseeability: was death foreseeable consequence of engaging in dangerous felony?
- Also considers whether death was "in furtherance of" the crime (similar to agency but more expansive)
- Rationale: When you engage in inherently dangerous felony, you assume risk of all foreseeable deaths

**Matrix approach (use on exam):**

Create table with WHO KILLS (rows: Defendant, Co-Defendant, Victim, Police, Bystander) and WHO DIES (columns: Victim, Bystander, Co-Defendant)

- Both theories = liability: Defendant or co-defendant kills victim/bystander
- Agency = NO liability: Third party (victim/police/bystander) kills anyone
- Proximate cause = liability: Any killing if foreseeable and in furtherance

**Statutory interpretation:** Read statute to determine which boxes apply. Look for phrases like:
- "One of the participants" killing = agency approach
- "Other than one of the participants" dying = co-defendant victims excluded
- "Any person" = broader proximate cause approach

**Apply to facts:** Use matrix to categorize the killing, determine which theory applies, argue foreseeability and furtherance

---

### Fragment 2: Temporal Scope of Felony Murder

**Issue:** When does the underlying felony END for purposes of felony murder liability?

**Rule:** Death must occur during commission, attempt, or immediate flight from the felony. But temporal boundaries can be disputed.

**Key considerations:**

1. **Already in custody/not fleeing:**
   - If defendant arrested and in custody when co-defendant kills someone, strongest argument felony has ended
   - Defendant "no longer performing that unlawful activity" → "no transfer of that mens rea"

2. **Different crime:**
   - If co-defendant committing NEW crime (e.g., evading arrest vs. original burglary), argue separate criminal transaction
   - Counter-argument: Flight is "integral part of committing any sort of felony" — "same transactional occurrence"

3. **Not in furtherance:**
   - Death during flight only counts if flight is "in furtherance of" the original felony
   - Defendant already caught = subsequent deaths don't aid the original crime

4. **Complicity doctrine analogy:**
   - Accomplice before the fact = part of original crime
   - Accomplice after the fact (harboring fugitive) = separate crime
   - Modern rule: helping after crime is distinct offense, not part of original crime
   - Similar logic: Acts after arrest should be separate from original felony

**Exam approach:** When death occurs after some temporal gap or change in circumstances, argue:
- Felony has ended (in custody, different location, time gap)
- New separate crime (flight/evasion distinct from original felony)
- Not in furtherance (death doesn't aid original criminal objective)

---

### Fragment 3: Reckless Murder vs. Manslaughter — Malone Framework

**Issue:** When does unintended killing constitute murder (extreme recklessness) vs. manslaughter (simple recklessness)?

**MPC Framework:**
- Murder § 210.2: Recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to human life
- Manslaughter § 210.3: Recklessly

**Three-dimensional analysis (Harcourt framework):**

**Dimension 1: Risk Level (Low → High)**
- How substantial was the risk of death?
- Malone: 60% (3 chambers out of 5) = very high risk
- Hall: Court rejected 50% bright-line rule; risk below 50% can still be "substantial" depending on circumstances
- No magic percentage; fact-specific

**Dimension 2: Subjective vs. Objective Awareness**
- OBJECTIVE (negligence): Should the defendant have known of the risk?
  - "Reasonable person" standard
  - "Treat guns as loaded" — objective standard for gun handling
- SUBJECTIVE (recklessness): Did the defendant ACTUALLY know/was defendant aware?
  - MPC: "consciously disregards" the risk
  - Defense: "in his mind he believed there was no chance" → no conscious disregard
  - Critical distinction: "should have known" ≠ "was aware"

**Dimension 3: Care Exercised**
- Did defendant take any precautions?
- Malone defense: Deliberately placed bullet in specific chamber, believed he could pull trigger 4 times safely
- "He did exercise some kind of care, obviously not enough"
- Relevant to determining whether disregard was "gross" or "extreme"

**Key argument structure:**

**Prosecution (extreme recklessness = murder):**
1. Risk level: Quantify the risk (Malone: 60%)
2. Objective knowledge: Defendant should have known (e.g., gun safety rules)
3. Conduct: Defendant acted despite obvious danger
4. Result: Death shows how extreme the risk was

**Defense (simple recklessness = manslaughter or negligence):**
1. Subjective unawareness: "He believed there was no chance" — not conscious disregard
2. Care taken: Defendant took precautions (put bullet in "safe" position)
3. Unforeseeable: Outcome doesn't match expected risk (gun shouldn't have fired on 3rd pull)
4. Wrong mens rea: Prosecution arguing negligence ("should have known") not recklessness ("aware")

**Critical distinction for exam:**
- Negligent homicide: Should have been aware of risk (objective)
- Reckless manslaughter: Actually aware of risk (subjective), consciously disregarded
- Reckless murder: Actually aware of substantial risk + extreme indifference to human life

**Magic phrase:** "We're not in the civil domain and we're not in the negligence domain... recklessness requires awareness"

---

### Fragment 4: MPC Felony Murder Presumption — Jury Instruction Issue

**Issue:** How does MPC § 1.12(5) presumption work in felony murder context?

**Background:** MPC doesn't have pure felony murder rule. Instead, creates rebuttable presumption of extreme recklessness when defendant engaged in certain felonies.

**Mechanics (MPC § 1.12(5)):**

1. **Trigger:** Evidence defendant committed enumerated felony
2. **Submission:** Issue of extreme recklessness must go to jury (unless court finds evidence "clearly negatives" the presumed fact)
3. **Instruction:** "The law declares that the jury may regard the facts giving rise to the presumption [the felony] as sufficient evidence of the presumed fact [extreme recklessness]"
4. **Jury discretion:** Jury MAY presume extreme recklessness, but doesn't HAVE TO

**Key word: "MAY"**
- Not mandatory
- Creates "some light between automatically saying it's felony murder and something about a presumption"

**Practical effect:**
- Strict liability model: Find felony → automatic murder (no jury deliberation on mens rea)
- MPC model: Find felony → may presume extreme recklessness → but jury can reject

**Jury deliberation under MPC:**
- "We have enough here to presume that there was extreme recklessness. But we don't have to."
- "We can, we need to accept this presumption in a way"
- Jury can distinguish between the presumption and whether it should apply in this specific case

**Harcourt's assessment:** "It's pretty thin, it's a pretty thin distinction... it seems pretty preclusive. It doesn't seem... it was a nice attempt at trying to create some light. But I'm not sure it really works."

**Exam application:**
- Identify MPC jurisdiction
- Note presumption arises from underlying felony
- Argue jury should/shouldn't accept presumption based on:
  - Nature of the felony (how dangerous?)
  - Circumstances of the death (how connected to felony?)
  - Defendant's awareness/state of mind
- Compare to pure strict liability jurisdictions

---

### Fragment 5: Intentional Act vs. Unintended Outcome

**Issue:** Defendant intentionally did dangerous act but didn't intend the resulting death. Murder? Manslaughter? Negligent homicide?

**Malone illustration:**
- **Intentional act:** Pulling the trigger (3 times)
  - "Those are intentional pulls of the trigger, yeah, right"
  - Not contesting the intentionality of pulling trigger
- **Unintended outcome:** Billy's death
  - "The outcome of that action was unintended"

**Key analytical move:** Separate the ACT from the RESULT

**Act analysis:**
1. Was the act itself voluntary? (Yes — intentionally pulled trigger)
2. Was the act objectively dangerous? (Yes — gun with bullet)
3. Did defendant intend to do the act? (Yes)

**Result analysis:**
1. Did defendant intend the result? (No — didn't intend to kill Billy)
2. Was defendant aware the result could occur? (Subjective recklessness question)
3. Should defendant have been aware? (Objective negligence question)

**Mens rea determination:**
- **If defendant intended result:** Intentional murder (not applicable in Malone)
- **If defendant aware of risk and consciously disregarded:** Reckless (murder or manslaughter depending on extremity)
- **If defendant should have been aware but wasn't:** Negligent homicide

**Defense strategy:**
- Concede act was intentional and dangerous
- Focus on lack of awareness/intent regarding result
- "In his mind he believed there was no chance"
- Emphasize precautions taken (careful bullet placement)

**Prosecution strategy:**
- Emphasize intentionality of dangerous act
- Argue awareness inferred from nature of act (guns kill people)
- "He knew that this was a gun. Guns are meant to kill people."
- Quantify the risk to show defendant must have been aware

**Exam tip:** Always separate act vs. result analysis. Intent as to one doesn't mean intent as to the other.

## 6. CONNECTIONS & CONTEXT

### Upcoming: Negligent Homicide (Wolansky + Zermatt)

**Thursday's assignment:**
- Read Wolansky case (Coconut Grove nightclub fire, 492 deaths)
- Research Zermatt, Switzerland nightclub fire (July 31, 2023, 41 deaths, husband and wife club owners charged with manslaughter)

**Key issues for Thursday:**
- Criminal negligence vs. manslaughter
- Owner liability when not present at time of incident
- Blocked exits, inadequate inspections, commercial venue safety
- Comparing American (Wolansky) and Swiss approaches

**Assigned roles:**
- Prosecutors: Ramia, Salome
- Defense: Nilam, Talara

### Connection to Complicity Doctrine

**Harcourt signaled:** Temporal issues in felony murder connect to complicity doctrine
- Accomplice before the fact = part of crime
- Accomplice after the fact = separate offense (harboring fugitive)
- When does criminal liability attach/detach temporally?

### Common Law Evolution

**Historical trajectory:**
1. English common law: Harsh felony murder rule, any death during any felony
2. 19th century: Courts narrow (Justice Stevens — "in furtherance of")
3. Modern: Foreseeability requirements, enumerated felonies only
4. MPC: Rebuttable presumption instead of strict liability

**Ongoing debate:** Deterrence rationale
- Pro: Encourages care during felonies
- Con: No marginal deterrence (same punishment for accidental vs. intentional killing → might as well kill witnesses)

## 8. OPEN QUESTIONS / FOLLOW-UP

1. In Malone, what actually happened with the gun? Why did it fire on the 3rd pull if bullet was in first chamber?

2. How far does "same transactional occurrence" extend? If co-defendant flees hours later and kills someone, still felony murder?

3. Under MPC presumption, have any juries actually REJECTED the presumption? Or is it effectively strict liability despite the "may"?

4. If victim kills co-defendant in self-defense (Canola), and self-defense is "lawful," how does that square with felony murder rule? Is it still "homicide" if justified?

5. Hall case: What IS the threshold for "substantial risk" if not 50%? 33%? 20%? Fact-specific only?

6. Malone: If defendant was 17 and victim was 13, any relevance of their ages to recklessness analysis?

7. How do courts handle felony murder when death is extremely unlikely (Baxter — breaking into cars → cyclist death)? At what point is it "too attenuated"?

8. Zermatt case: Will Swiss law follow similar framework? Comparative analysis coming Thursday.

## 9. PROFESSOR STYLE NOTES

**Harcourt's teaching methods observed:**
- Socratic with extended back-and-forth
- Assigns prosecution/defense roles for argument
- Uses visual/spatial analogies (matrix, three-dimensional space, quadrants)
- Encourages competing co-counsel arguments
- Breaks down complex statutes step-by-step (MPC § 1.12(5) deep dive)
- Connects historical evolution (Coke's Institutes → modern statutes)
- Quantifies when possible (60% risk in Malone)
- Self-aware about ambiguities ("I don't know if that distinction holds")
- Forward-looking (signals upcoming topics)
- Contemplated having students stand at podiums and argue (considering for future classes)

**Harcourt's recurring themes:**
- Subjective vs. objective standards
- Civil law vs. criminal law standards
- Culpability mattering in criminal context
- Temporal dimensions of liability
- Statutory interpretation skills

## 10. PERSONAL STUDY NOTES

**Need to review:**
- [ ] Re-read Wolansky before Thursday
- [ ] Research Zermatt fire facts (July 31, 2023 — transcript says July 31st, doesn't specify year but said "evening")
- [ ] Review MPC § 1.12 general provisions
- [ ] Create practice matrix for different felony murder scenarios
- [ ] Outline three-dimensional recklessness analysis framework

**Practice problems to create:**
- Agency vs. proximate cause with different killer/victim permutations
- Temporal scope hypotheticals (when does felony end?)
- Recklessness quantification (what % risk = substantial?)
- MPC presumption jury instruction application

**Questions for office hours:**
- Clarify Malone gun mechanics (still don't understand how it fired on 3rd pull)
- Discuss Baxter temporal issue — where's the line?
- MPC presumption effectiveness — any empirical data?
