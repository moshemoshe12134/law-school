## Part I: Course Framework & Method (5 min)

### Harcourt's Opening Frame

**Core Thesis:** Criminal law is not merely a neutral response to "crime." Punishment institutions structure social order—reproducing hierarchies of race, class, and gender—even while doctrine appears apolitical.

**"Disjuncture" Claim:** Punishment institutions are not calibrated to crime rates. The "crime → punishment" story is descriptively wrong. There is a gap between actual crime and who gets punished.

**Implication for exams:** When analyzing doctrine, always ask:
1. What conduct/mental state does the rule require?
2. What institutions apply it (police, prosecutors, juries, judges)?
3. What distributional consequences follow (who gets stopped, charged, convicted)?

**Justice as Throughline:** Harcourt asked students to write a one-sentence definition of justice and keep revising it against cases. Use this as a lens for evaluating doctrine.

---

### The Criminal Process Roadmap

**Memorize this sequence** (Harcourt called it "the most important chart you'll ever see"):

`Investigation → Arrest → Charging/Complaint → (Grand Jury/Indictment where used) → Arraignment → Motions → Trial → Verdict → Sentencing → Direct Appeal → Collateral Review (habeas)`

**Exam use:** When analyzing cases, identify where in the process the issue arises (e.g., jury instructions at trial, charging decisions by prosecutor).

---

### No Common Law Crimes

**Blackstone's Foundation:** "To make a complete crime...there must be both a will and an act."

**Modern Rule:** ~98% of U.S. criminal law is codified. You cannot be charged unless a statute prohibits the conduct. This means:
- Statutory interpretation is the core skill
- MPC word-by-word parsing matters
- Look to definitions sections (MPC §1.13)

---

## Part II: Actus Reus — Voluntary Act Requirement (8 min)

### MPC § 2.01(1) — Core Rule

> "A person is not guilty of an offense unless his liability is based on conduct which **includes** a voluntary act..."

**"Includes" = minimal threshold:** Only ONE voluntary act in the chain of conduct is required—not every component need be voluntary.

### What Is NOT Voluntary (MPC § 2.01(2))

1. **(a)** Reflex or convulsion (true reflex, not trained response)
2. **(b)** Bodily movement during unconsciousness or sleep
3. **(c)** Conduct during hypnosis
4. **(d)** Movement not product of effort or determination of actor, **either conscious or habitual**

**Key insight:** Even habitual/routine acts count as voluntary. Very few acts qualify as involuntary.

### Time-Framing (Kelman)

**Concept:** Where you draw temporal boundaries of "the act" determines voluntariness.

| Case | Narrow Frame (Defense) | Broad Frame (Prosecution) |
|------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Martin** | Appearing on highway = involuntary (police coercion) | Getting drunk = voluntary act |
| **Decina** | Having seizure = involuntary | Driving with known epilepsy = voluntary act |

**Exam technique:** Always argue BOTH time frames. Show doctrine is malleable. Analyze which frame serves deterrence/culpability better.

**Prosecutor wants:** Fewer elements, broader time frame
**Defense wants:** More elements, narrower time frame

---

## Part III: Mens Rea — Element-by-Element (10 min)

### MPC § 2.02 — Four Mental States (Hierarchy)

| Mental State | Definition | Key Phrase |
|--------------|------------|------------|
| **Purpose** | Conscious object to engage in conduct or cause result | "Conscious object" |
| **Knowledge** | Aware conduct is of that nature; practically certain result will occur | "Practically certain" |
| **Recklessness** | Consciously disregards substantial and unjustifiable risk | "Conscious disregard" |
| **Negligence** | Should be aware of substantial and unjustifiable risk | "Should be aware" |

**Hierarchy Rule (§ 2.02(5)):** Purpose satisfies knowledge, recklessness, negligence. Knowledge satisfies recklessness, negligence. Recklessness satisfies negligence. (Substitution works downward only.)

### Element Types (MPC § 1.13(9))

1. **Conduct** — action or omission
2. **Attendant Circumstances** — facts that exist at time of conduct
3. **Result of Conduct** — what the conduct produces

**Exam skill:** Every statute analysis requires mapping mens rea to each material element type.

### Default Rules (Critical for Exams)

**§ 2.02(3) — Silence creates recklessness floor:**
- When statute doesn't specify mens rea, element is established if person acts purposely, knowingly, **or recklessly**
- Due to hierarchy, this creates a **floor of recklessness**
- "Night and day" difference in proof burden

**§ 2.02(4) — Distribution rule:**
- When statute prescribes culpability "without distinguishing among material elements," that mens rea applies to ALL material elements
- **UNLESS** "a contrary purpose plainly appears"

**Prosecution argument:** "Contrary purpose plainly appears" from structure/policy/penalty
**Defense argument:** Distribute mens rea across all elements (multiplies prosecution's burden)

### Translating Common Law Terms

**"Malicious"** (*Cunningham*):
- Old (rejected): General wickedness
- Modern: Either (1) intent to cause harm, or (2) recklessness (foreseeability)
- MPC translation: Recklessness (consciously disregarding substantial risk)

**Key distinction:** Recklessness = subjective (what defendant actually foresaw); Negligence = objective (what reasonable person would have known)

---

## Part IV: Homicide — Intended Killings (7 min)

### MPC vs. Common Law Structure

**Common Law:** First-degree murder (premeditated), Second-degree murder (intentional but not premeditated), Voluntary manslaughter, Involuntary manslaughter

**MPC:** Collapses degrees → Murder, Manslaughter, Negligent Homicide

**Exam skill:** Be able to "mix and match" any homicide statute.

### Premeditation — The Degree Boundary

**Anderson evidentiary buckets:**
1. **Planning activity** — e.g., gun placement above bed
2. **Motive** — history of abuse, financial gain
3. **Manner/particularity** — how killing was done

**Time-framing:** Prosecution expands the moment; defense narrows it.

**MPC Critique of Premeditation:**
> "Prior reflection may reveal the uncertainties of a tortured conscience rather than exceptional depravity."
> "The suddenness of the killing may simply reveal callousness so complete that no hesitation is required."

**Forrest (mercy killing):** Shows problem with categorical premeditation rule—clearly premeditated but "tortured conscience" not "exceptional depravity."

**Prosecution wants:** Jury instruction equating willful/deliberate/premeditated with mere intent ("smushes everything")
**Defense wants:** Anderson factors as checklist; narrow time frame

---

## Part V: Mitigation to Manslaughter (10 min)

### The Two-Dimensional Framework

**Analyze any heat of passion/EED defense along BOTH dimensions:**

| Dimension 1: Categorical Rule vs. Standard | Dimension 2: Objective vs. Subjective |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Categorical:** Bright-line categories (e.g., "words alone not enough") | **Objective:** Reasonable person standard |
| **Standard:** Case-by-case jury determination | **Subjective:** Defendant's actual beliefs |

**Prosecution wants:** Categorical + Objective (exclude idiosyncrasies)
**Defense wants:** Standard + Subjective (maximum flexibility)

### Three Approaches

| Case | Rule/Standard | Objective/Subjective | Key Holding |
|------|--------------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Girouard** (MD) | Categorical | Objective | "Words alone not enough"; traditional categories only (assault, mutual combat, illegal arrest, injury to relative, adultery) |
| **Mayor** (MI) | Standard | Objective (but tailored) | Jury decides case-by-case; "scarcely two cases identical" |
| **Casasa** (NY) | Standard | Subjective + objective hybrid | MPC/NYPL: "Under circumstances as [defendant] believes them to be" |

### MPC Extreme Emotional Disturbance

**Two-element test:**

1. **Subjective:** Defendant acted under influence of extreme emotional disturbance
   - Purely subjective: Did *this defendant* experience EED?

2. **Objective (with subjective flavor):** Reasonable explanation or excuse for EED
   - "Reasonableness... determined from viewpoint of person in actor's situation under circumstances as he believes them to be"
   - Prof: "Most subjective objective standard you could ever have"

**MPC Commentary:** "Designedly ambiguous" — flexibility desired. "Situation" is intentionally vague.

**What's included:** Blindness, shock, extreme grief, personal handicaps
**What's excluded:** Idiosyncratic moral values, bigoted beliefs

**Fact-filtering:** Objective/subjective spectrum = determining which facts jury may consider (exclude: political extremism; include: shock, grief)

---

## Part VI: Felony Murder (10 min)

### Core Concept — "Evacuating" Mens Rea

Felony murder evacuates the mens rea for the killing and replaces it with an attendant circumstance (the underlying felony). This creates **strict liability on the homicide piece.**

> "If you engage in any felony [with death], that's it."

**Traditional elements (agency version):**
1. A death
2. During commission/attempt/immediate flight from qualifying felony
3. Defendant was participant in felony
4. Killing by defendant or accomplice, sufficiently connected to felony

### Agency Theory vs. Proximate Cause Theory

**Use this matrix on exams:**

| WHO KILLS | Victim | Bystander | Co-Defendant |
|-----------|--------|-----------|--------------|
| **Defendant** | Both = liable | Both = liable | Query under both |
| **Co-Defendant** | Both = liable | Proximate = liable / Agency = query | Proximate = liable / Agency = **NO LIABILITY** |
| **Victim/Police/Bystander** | Proximate = liable / Agency = **NO LIABILITY** | Proximate = liable / Agency = **NO LIABILITY** | Proximate = liable / Agency = **NO LIABILITY** |

**Agency Theory (defense-friendly, narrower):**
- Killing must be by defendant or co-participant
- Requires principal-agency relationship
- Death must be "in furtherance of" criminal project
- **No liability** when victim/police/bystander kills
- Rationale: Culpability matters

**Proximate Cause Theory (prosecution-friendly, broader):**
- Liability for any death proximately caused by felony
- All deaths foreseeable when engaging in dangerous felony
- Flight from police = "integral part of committing felony"

### Temporal Dimension — When Does Felony End?

**Baxter problem:** Defendant arrested, in custody, miles away when co-defendant kills cyclists during flight.

**Defense arguments:**
1. Already in custody → felony ended
2. Different crime (evading arrest vs. original burglary)
3. Not "in furtherance of" original felony
4. No longer performing unlawful activity

**Prosecution response:** Flight is "same transactional occurrence" — "integral part of committing any sort of felony"

### Foreseeability Limitation

**Stamp (CA):** No foreseeability required. "Felon takes victim as he finds him" (eggshell victim logic).

**Serné (1887):** Felony murder limited to acts "known to be dangerous to life and likely in itself to cause death."

**Exam move:** Argue whether jurisdiction requires foreseeability; use Serné for knowledge requirement.

### Policy Arguments (Both Sides)

**Deterrence:**
- Pro: Severe punishment deters felonies generally
- Con: No marginal deterrence (if everything punished by death, no incentive not to kill witnesses)
- Con: No deterrence for unforeseeable deaths

**Moral Blameworthiness:**
- Pro: Choosing dangerous felony supplies culpability
- Con: Breaking into cars ≠ premeditated killing culpability
- Con: Punishment should be proportional to blameworthiness

---

## Part VII: Reckless Murder vs. Manslaughter (5 min)

### MPC Framework

**Murder (§ 210.2):** Recklessly "under circumstances manifesting **extreme indifference** to the value of human life"

**Manslaughter (§ 210.3):** Recklessly (simple recklessness, not extreme)

### Malone Framework — Three-Dimensional Analysis

**Dimension 1: Risk Level**
- Malone: 60% (3/5 chambers) = very high
- No bright-line 50% rule (*Hall*)
- Fact-specific: what is "substantial risk"?

**Dimension 2: Subjective vs. Objective Awareness**
- **OBJECTIVE (negligence):** Should have known (reasonable person)
- **SUBJECTIVE (recklessness):** Actually aware, consciously disregarded
- Critical: "should have known" ≠ "was aware"

**Dimension 3: Care Exercised**
- Did defendant take precautions?
- Relevant to whether disregard was "gross" or "extreme"

**Prosecution argues:** Objective knowledge ("treat guns as loaded"), quantify risk, extreme indifference
**Defense argues:** Subjective unawareness ("believed there was no chance"), precautions taken, unforeseeable outcome

## Part VIII: Policy Essay Framework (5 min)

### Recurring Themes (Balkin Pairs)

When writing policy essays, use these recurring argument pairs:

**1. Individualism vs. Communalism**
- Individualism: Respect choice, market forces, anti-paternalism
- Communalism: Social regulation for collective good, paternalism
- Application: Subjective standards (individualism) vs. objective standards (communalism)

**2. Rules vs. Standards**
- Rules: Predictable, bright lines, easy administration (formal realizability)
- Standards: Flexible, case-by-case fairness (substantive realizability)
- Application: Premeditation rule catches edge cases; EED standard creates discretion
- **This trade-off "recurs at all times" in criminal law**

**3. Paternalism vs. Anti-Paternalism**
- Paternalism: Foreclose choices for parties' own good
- Anti-paternalism: Respect autonomy

**4. Rights as Freedom vs. Rights as Security**
- Freedom: Protect doing what you want
- Security: Protect against harms from others

### Policy Arguments to Deploy

**Deterrence:**
- General deterrence vs. specific deterrence
- Marginal deterrence problem (felony murder creates no marginal cost to killing)
- "Can you deter people who aren't thinking about consequences?" (EED context)

**Moral Blameworthiness / Proportionality:**
- Punishment should be proportional to culpability
- Breaking into cars ≠ first-degree murder
- Mercy killing ≠ "exceptional depravity"

**Expressive Function:**
- Law signals moral condemnation
- "Moral education function"
- BUT: What message does law send when applied unjustly?

**Institutional Reality:**
- Felony murder as plea leverage tool
- Racial disparities in charging
- Mass incarceration as background condition

### Essay Structure

**Introduction:** State thesis connecting doctrine to theory
**Body Paragraphs:** Use Balkin pairs to structure arguments; always present both sides
**Conclusion:** Return to justice definition—does this rule/institution serve justice?

## Magic Words to Echo on Exam

From Harcourt's lectures (use these phrases):

- **"Element-by-element"** — mens rea analysis
- **"Consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk"** — recklessness
- **"Night and day"** — difference between mens rea levels
- **"Contrary purpose plainly appears"** — distribution rule exception
- **"Time-framing"** — expand or contract the relevant moment
- **"Evacuating the mens rea"** — felony murder concept
- **"In furtherance of"** — agency theory / proximate cause test
- **"Extreme indifference to the value of human life"** — reckless murder
- **"Under the circumstances as he believes them to be"** — MPC EED subjective hook
- **"Designedly ambiguous"** — MPC drafting strategy
- **"Rules vs. standards recurs at all times"** — meta-framework
- **"Culpability matters"** — defense argument against strict liability
