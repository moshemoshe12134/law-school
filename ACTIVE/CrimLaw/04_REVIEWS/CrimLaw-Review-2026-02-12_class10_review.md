# Review — Class #10 — Foucault & The Breakdown of Punishment Theory

## 1. PREP VS. REALITY COMPARISON

- **Expected**: A dedicated transition to "theory/critical analysis" focused entirely on Foucault's *Discipline and Punish*, employing the genealogical method and specifically referencing the "Reader's Companion" reinterpretations.
- **Reality**:
    - **Continuation of Moretti**: The first third of the class was actually a wrap-up of the "Moretti" (club fire) hypothetical, applying Rehabilitation and Incapacitation theories.
    - **The MPC Critique**: Significant time was spent attacking Model Penal Code § 1.02 for listing *all* theories of punishment, utilizing Nietzsche to argue this renders the code "meaningless."
    - **Rusche & Kirchheimer**: A strong detour into *Punishment and Social Structure* to de-link crime from punishment (arguing punishment tracks labor markets, not crime rates).
    - **The "Expository Society" Twist**: While Foucault was covered (Spectacle vs. Discipline), the Professor pivoted at the end to argue that Foucault's "Disciplinary Society" model might be outdated, replaced by a modern "Expository Society" (driven by desire/social media rather than coercion).

## 2. EXAM SIGNALS

- **#EXAM_SIGNAL The "Meaninglessness" of MPC § 1.02**: The Professor was emphatic ("It's completely meaningless") that adopting *all* theories of punishment (Retribution, Deterrence, Rehab, Incapacitation) acts as a total breakdown of guidance. If you see a statute or policy that claims to do "everything," the critique is that it allows for *any* justification (a "will to power").
- **#EXAM_SIGNAL "Expository Society"**: This appears to be the Professor's own theoretical addition. In a policy essay about modern punishment or surveillance, contrasting Foucault's "Panopticon" (coercion/internalized gaze) with the "Expository Society" (desire/voluntary exposure) would likely be highly rewarded.
- **#EXAM_SIGNAL Punishment $\neq$ Crime Response**: The Professor repeatedly stressed "Breaking the link" between crime and punishment. Arguments that assume punishment is a natural reaction to crime are "blind." A sophisticated answer should interrogate the *political economy* or *social function* of the punishment (e.g., "What is this punishment actually constructing?").

## 3. CORRECTIONS TO PREP

- **Theory Application**: The prep assumed a clean break from doctrine to theory. The class demonstrated how to *apply* theory (Rehab/Incapacitation) to a fact pattern (Moretti), showing that these theories often conflict ("radically in conflict").
- **Foucault's Scope**: The prep focused heavily on the "new archival insights." While the Professor mentioned the "Reader's Companion," the lecture focused more on the core text's distinction between the "Spectacle" (Damiens) and "Discipline" (Timetables), and then moved *beyond* Foucault to the "Expository Society."

## 4. DOCTRINAL INSIGHTS

### The "Mix" is a Failure
The Model Penal Code's approach of listing every purpose (§ 1.02) is not a "comprehensive" strategy; it is a **failure of theory**.
- *Quote*: "It gives us absolutely no guidance... You can just justify anything you want. It's in effect the total breakdown of punishment theory."
- *Nietzsche's Diagnosis*: Purposes (deterrence, rehab) are just "fabrications" attached *after* the fact to justify a practice that exists for other reasons (often "will to power").

### Rusche & Kirchheimer Hypothesis
- **Core claim**: Punishment levels track **labor markets**, not crime rates.
- *Evidence*: "Fluctuating crime rates and a flat prison population" (1926-1973) vs. "Skyrocketing incarceration" later.
- *Application*: When analyzing a punishment regime, look at the economic backdrop. Is there a need for labor (galleys, convict leasing) or a surplus of labor (mass incarceration)?

### "Discipline" as a "Positive" Power
- Punishment is not just "repressive" (stopping crime).
- It is "positive" in the sense that it **constructs** something:
    - It constructs "docile bodies" (soldiers, students, workers).
    - It constructs a "delinquent" class.
    - It creates "knowledge" (criminology, psychiatry).

## 5. POLICY ARGUMENTS

### The "Social Defense" Argument (Incapacitation)
- **Framing**: Incapacitation is not about "punishment" or "moral blame"; it is purely **Social Defense**.
- **Counter-Argument**: The "6% Problem" (J-Curve). The theory that a small % of people commit 50% of crimes led to "selective incapacitation" strategies.
- **Critique**: In practice, we supply "Mass Incarceration" rather than "Selective Incapacitation," widening the net rather than narrowing it.

### The "Expository Society" (vs. Discipline)
- **Classic Foucault**: We are watched (Panopticon), so we internalize the gaze and discipline ourselves. (Coercion).
- **Harcourt's Update**: We hold the camera ourselves. We *want* to be seen. We expose our data, our location, our preferences via social media and search engines. (Desire).
- **Argument**: Modern control operates through **desire**, not just restriction. We are "known" to the state/corporations because we *volunteer* that knowledge.

## 6. OUTLINE INSERTS

### Critique of Multi-Purpose Statutes (MPC § 1.02)
> "To put all of [the purposes] in here gives us absolutely no guidance... It's totally meaningless... It's the total breakdown of punishment theory."
> *Use this to critique any sentencing scheme that claims to balance Retribution, Deterrence, and Rehabilitation simultaneously. See Nietzsche: Purposes are signs that a 'will to power' has mastered the institution.*

### Rusche & Kirchheimer Hypothesis
> "We must first rid ourselves of the illusion that penality is above all a means of reducing crime."
> *Punishment levels correlate more strongly with labor market needs (needs for workers vs. surplus population) than with crime rates.*

### Disciplinary Power vs. Expository Power
> **Disciplinary Power (Foucault)**: Operates through **surveillance** and **coercion**. The Panopticon: "The few see the many." Result: "Docile Bodies" (internalized discipline).
> **Expository Power (Harcourt)**: Operates through **desire** and **digital exposure**. The Digital Panopticon: "We expose ourselves." Result: Being fully "known" through voluntary data emission.

## 7. SOURCE EXTRACTION

- **Michel Foucault**, *Discipline and Punish* (1975).
- **Friedrich Nietzsche**, *On the Genealogy of Morals* (1887) (Critique of "purposes" as post-hoc justifications).
- **Rusche & Kirchheimer**, *Punishment and Social Structure* (1939) (Economic theory of punishment).
- **Model Penal Code § 1.02** (Cited as the example of "meaningless" mixed theory).

## 8. PREWRITE OPPORTUNITIES

- **The "Purpose of Punishment" Essay**: A prewrite criticizing the "eclectic" or "mixed" theory of punishment (like MPC § 1.02) using Nietzsche's argument that "origin $\neq$ purpose" and that mixed theories allow for unbridled prosecutorial/state discretion.
- **Modern Surveillance Policy**: A creative essay distinguishing between "traditional" surveillance (cameras on corners - Disciplinary) and "modern" surveillance (data harvesting/social media - Expository).

## 9. TRANSCRIPT QC FLAGS

- **Speaker ID**: Most of the transcript is correctly identified as "SPEAKER 1" (Professor).
- **Clarity**: The transcript is raw but very clear; the distinction between the "Moretti" discussion and the "Lecture" portion is seamless but distinct in content.
