# Review — Class 11 — The Function of Punishment

## 1. PREP VS. REALITY COMPARISON

| Category | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Topic Coverage** | 🟢 Mapped | Class followed the prep structure almost exactly: Clarissa → Wyatt → Cover → Foucault/Homer. |
| **Cold Call** | 🟢 Survived | Benjamin (Clarissa facts), Addison (Indictment defect), Elliott (Grand jury), Charles (2nd confession), Philip (Wyatt facts). |
| **Hypotheticals** | ⚪ Skipped | No new hypos; focus was entirely on the historical cases and the theory readings. |
| **Unexpected** | 🟡 Nuance | Harcourt emphasized the **financial incentives** (State paying 50% vs 100% of slave value) as the key driver for the "fairness" – not just abstract legitimacy, but economic structural preservation. Also linked specifically to **Justinian's Digest** (Roman law on torture) which wasn't in prep. |

## 2. EXAM SIGNALS (#EXAM_SIGNAL)

- **#EXAM_SIGNAL (Methodology)**: "We could be doing the same thing with Nazi law." Harcourt explicitly stated we can "do the law" (IRAC, facts, holding) separate from the morality. The exam might ask you to apply a rule from a morally repugnant regime to test if you can separate "law" from "justice" – or to critique that separation.
- **#EXAM_SIGNAL (Function of Procedure)**: The "Reform Paradox" is key. If an exam question involves a procedural reform (e.g., better police warnings, more hearings), the **policy argument** should be: "Does this reform substantive justice, or does it just make the injustice more sustainable/palatable?"
- **#EXAM_SIGNAL (Judicial Role)**: The "Captain Vere" dilemma. Judges enforcing laws they personally detest. A likely policy question: "How should a judge decide when the law is clear but the outcome is unjust?" (Answer: Formalism/Vere vs. disobedience).

## 3. CORRECTIONS TO PREP

- **Indictment Defect Detail**: Prep noted the indictment was insufficient. Harcourt clarified *why* it mattered: it shows she got *more* technical due process than modern defendants (who wouldn't get off on a "noxious thing" vs "poison" technicality). This highlights the "weirdness" of the slave law system's rigorous formalism.
- **Justinian's Digest**: Prep didn't include this. Harcourt brought physical books of Justinian's Digest to show the continuity of "regulating torture" from Rome to Alabama. Torture wasn't *banned*; it was *regulated* (e.g., don't ask leading questions).

---

## 4. DOCTRINAL INSIGHTS

### The "Regulation of Torture" (Not Abolition)
Harcourt reframed the exclusion of confessions not as "anti-torture" but as "regulated torture."
- **Roman Law (Justinian)**: You can torture slaves, BUT you must follow rules (e.g., no leading questions like "Why did you poison him?").
- **Alabama Law**: You can't use the confession if the master is present or if it's a "leading question" situation (Clarissa's overseer assuming guilt).
- **Insight**: The legal system's goal was not to stop pain, but to ensure the *reliability* of the pain-extracted truth so the system (slavery) wouldn't collapse under false accusations.

### Economic Incentives of Due Process
- **The 50% Rule**: State paid 50% of executed slave's value to owner.
- **Governor's Veto**: Vetoed bill for 100% reimbursement.
- **Why?** If owners got 100%, they'd dump bad saves by accusing them of capital crimes. "Humanity alone... is the only inducement."
- **Doctrine**: "Humanity" (due process) is actually an economic regulatory mechanism to prevent market failure (owners destroying their own capital at state expense).

---

## 5. POLICY ARGUMENTS

### The "Legitimation" Argument (Stabilization)
- **Argument**: "This procedural protection [exclusion of confession] actually *strengthens* the unjust system."
- **Why**: It prevents the system from becoming too chaotic/brutal (which would cause revolt or economic loss). It creates an "equilibrium" that allows the oppressive social order to persist.
- **Harcourt's Phrasing**: "Negotiating the space of slavery so that it can continue to survive."

### The "Formalism as Complicity" Argument (Cover)
- **Argument**: "By separating specific legal questions (indictment sufficiency) from the broader moral reality (slavery), the court acts as Captain Vere."
- **Application**: The judge absolves themself of responsibility ("I just apply the law") while serving as the essential machinery of the injustice. Law serves to *distance* the moral actor from their action.

### The "Truth Production" Argument (Foucault)
- **Argument**: "Legal truth is not what happened; it's what the procedure produces."
- **Evidence**:
    - **Homer**: Truth = outcome of the Oath Ritual (risk).
    - **Clarissa**: Truth = outcome of the Review Procedure (technicalities).
    - **Modern**: Truth = outcome of the Plea Bargain/Trial rules.
- **Use**: Attack a "fact" on the exam by attacking the *procedure* that produced it.

## 6. OUTLINE INSERTS

### [Critical Theory] The Functions of Punishment (Harcourt)
*Insert in "Punishment Theory" section, after classic utilitarian/retributive theories*

| Stated Purpose | Real/Unstated Function | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fairness/Due Process** | **Legitimation**: Makes unjust systems appear neutral; stabilizes social order ("equilibrium"). | *State v. Clarissa*: "Humane policy" excludes tortured confession, but upholds slavery. |
| **Truth Seeking** | **Truth Production**: Rituals create "legal truth" independent of reality. | *Homer's Iliad*: Oath-taking determines winner, not eye-witness facts. |
| **Justice** | **Complicity**: Allows actors (judges) to separate law from morality. | *Captain Vere*: "Buttons" require hanging the innocent angel. |

### [History] Conditions of Enslaved Persons (Alabama Cases)
* **Rule**: Confessions by enslaved persons require "corroborating proof" due to "condition in the scale of society" (inherent coercion).
* **Limit**: Even "voluntary" confessions are suspect if master/overseer is present (*Wyatt*) or if questions are leading (*Clarissa*).
* **Rationale**:
    1.  **Stated**: "Humane policy" / Reliability.
    2.  **Actual**: Regulating the master-slave relationship to prevent "implosion" of the system (Governor's Veto on 100% reimbursement).

---

## 7. SOURCE EXTRACTION

### From Transcript
*   **Justinian's Digest (Roman Law)**: Cited as the ancestor of Alabama's torture regulation. "The former seems rather the action of someone suggesting an answer than seeking the truth" (banning leading questions in torture).
*   **Governor of Alabama Veto Message**: Cited to show the economic logic of "humanity" (100% reimbursement would remove incentive for fair trial).

## 8. PREWRITE OPPORTUNITIES

### The "Captain Vere" Prewrite
**Trigger**: A judge in a hypo expresses personal discomfort with a ruling but says "the statute compels me."
**Response**:
1.  Identify the **Formalist/Positivist** stance (Law is distinct from Morals).
2.  Critique using **Cover/Vere**: By retreating to "office" ("these buttons"), the judge becomes complicit in the substantive injustice.
3.  Counter with **Instrumentalist/Realist** view: The judge *constructs* the law; they could interpret the "noxious weed" ambiguous statute differently if they wanted to avoid the injustice (like the court in *Clarissa* finding a technicality to *save* the defendant, though here it was to save the *system*).

---

## 9. TRANSCRIPT QC FLAGS

- **Transcription Error**: "Jason weed" -> **Jamestown weed** (Jimsonweed).
- **Speaker ID**: "Speaker 2" is clearly **Harcourt**. "Speaker 1/3/etc" are students (Benjamin, Yasir, Addison, etc.).
- **Missing Context**: The "Anu" student reads from the physical Justinian book; transcript captures the reading but not the visual of the book passing.

---

## 10. NEXT STEPS / ACTION ITEMS

- [ ] Add "Function of Punishment" table to Outline.
- [ ] Review the "Captain Vere" interaction for the Deals/Contracts overlap (judging vs personal morality).
- [ ] **Prepare for Class 12**: Likely moving back to Doctrine or modern application of these theories.
