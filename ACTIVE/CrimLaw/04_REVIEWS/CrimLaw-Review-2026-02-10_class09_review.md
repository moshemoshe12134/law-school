# Review — Class #9 — 2026-02-10 — Punishment Theory

**Purpose:** Extract exam-ready material (NOT summarize class). Critical output: Prewrite fragments (Section 5) + "Magic Words" (Section 4).

> **#EXAM_PRIORITY** This lecture is **VERY IMPORTANT for the exam**. Harcourt explicitly signaled this week's material as foundational for the policy essay. Focus on how he made arguments, not just what the arguments were.

## Prep vs. Reality

### What Was Covered vs. Expected

The prep materials predicted a criminal justice process overview and four punishment theories (retribution, deterrence, incapacitation, rehabilitation) with Harcourt's critique. Instead, Harcourt opened with a sweeping historical narrative that framed punishment practices as radically contingent—each era believing its methods were rational and just. This historical setup is itself the foundation of his critique: our current actuarial/risk-based approach will seem barbaric to future generations, just as trial by battle seems barbaric to us.

The class then moved through Foucault's transformation from corporal to disciplinary punishment, the swing from indeterminate to actuarial sentencing (including the Burgess method and modern sentencing guidelines), and applied Kantian and Benthamite theories to a negligence conviction using the Comotana fire (Moretti) case.

**Key realization:** Harcourt's opening wasn't filler—it establishes that our current practices are historically contingent, not natural or inevitable. This is ammunition for challenging the "naturalness" of whatever punishment regime appears on the exam.

## Exam Signals

### Professor's Meta-Teaching Moments

**"We've done 360s."** Harcourt used this phrase to describe the dramatic flips in punishment practices over just the last century. From indeterminate sentencing with rehabilitation to actuarial prediction with mass incarceration—these aren't minor adjustments but complete reversals of philosophy. On an exam, when arguing about punishment theory, show you understand that current approaches are historically contingent and will change again.

**"Forms of punishment over human history have changed dramatically. And at every moment a vast majority of people in society believed that those methods were right."** This is a critical meta-point for challenging the naturalness of current punishment practices. If trial by battle made sense to people as divinely ordained, what practices do we accept today that will seem barbaric in 100 years?

**"All of these punishment theorists... were originally trying to limit punishment."** Both Kant and Bentham were enlightenment theorists trying to reduce punishment in a "dark age." Retribution wasn't originally about vengeance—it was about LIMITING punishment to what the offender deserves. Utilitarianism wasn't about maximizing punishment—it was about the minimum necessary to achieve social goals. On exam, don't present retribution as "eye-for-an-eye vengeance" or utilitarianism as "maximal punishment"—frame them as competing LIMITING principles that have been distorted.

**"Recidivism is the best proxy for recidivism."** This devastating line captures the circularity of actuarial sentencing. We claim to predict future dangerousness, but we're actually predicting future criminal contacts—which is really predicting where police will police. Since policing concentrates in certain neighborhoods (often correlated with race and class), prior convictions reflect policing patterns more than underlying dangerousness. Use this on exam to challenge prediction-based sentencing as circular and racially coded while appearing "neutral."

**"There's an optimal level of crime."** Gary Becker's economic theory holds that reducing crime to zero would require unacceptable costs (a cop next to everyone, all of us handcuffed). There is instead an optimal level of homicides, sexual assaults, and club fires that maximizes social welfare. Use this sophisticated utilitarian insight to critique simple deterrence arguments on exam.

## Doctrinal Insights

### Historical Transformation of Punishment

Harcourt spent significant time establishing the dramatic changes in punishment practices. The point isn't trivia—it's that each era believed its methods were rational and just. We're no different.

**Early Germanic:** Blood geld—monetary compensation for harm. If someone was murdered, the family would receive payment. There was a set price for life.

**Feudal:** Trial by battle. Harcourt noted this made sense at the time: if you believe in divine intervention, why trust ignorant laypeople when you could have God decide? The winner wasn't merely stronger but divinely favored.

**Germanic law:** Oath-taking. If accused of homicide, you could line up 9-12 highly respected community members to swear to your honesty. This was effectively a system of social status—those with better connections and reputation prevailed.

**Medieval:** Trial by water/fire—another form of divine intervention testing.

**Roman/Greek:** Torture of enslaved persons was codified as the ONLY way to interrogate them. Free citizens couldn't be tortured; slaves had to be. Harcourt noted this was rational at the time and will be explored further in Friday's class on enslaved persons in American law.

**17th-18th century:** Brutal corporal punishment, exemplified by Damien's execution for attempted regicide against Louis XV in 1757 (the opening scene of Foucault's *Discipline and Punish*). Public torture and execution as expression of outrage.

**19th century (Foucault):** Disciplinary punishment—timetables, arrangements of space, regimented discipline, panopticism. Punishment becomes about training rather than spectacle.

**1973-present (US):** Mass incarceration and warehousing. Harcourt noted it's hard to see much "disciplining" going on—just massive incapacitation.

**Modern:** Lethal injection—private, clinical, middle-of-the-night executions designed to be "like euthanizing your dog." We accept this as humane, just as previous eras accepted their methods as appropriate.

### The 20th Century Swing: From Indeterminate to Actuarial

Around 1910, the system used **indeterminate sentencing**—a judge might impose "3 years to life" or "5 years to life," and a parole board would decide when the person was actually released. This was individualized sentencing brought about by the rise of social sciences. The idea was that experts could figure out "who these folks are," assess their background, monitor their behavior in prison, and determine exactly when they were reformed. The very name "Department of Corrections" reflects this rehabilitative philosophy. There was a separate system for juveniles, who weren't "criminally adjudicated" but received different treatment with records that wouldn't follow them.

Starting around 1973, there was a dramatic shift to **actuarial sentencing**—prediction-based, fixed sentences, truth-in sentencing laws, mandatory minimums. Harcourt traced this to the University of Chicago, where sociologist Ernst Burgess developed a 21-factor metric to predict parole violations. His research assistant, Ferris Lawn, was then appointed to the Illinois Board of Pardons and Paroles and implemented the Burgess method. The factors included categories like "farm boy" (good), "ne'er-do-well" (bad), and explicit racial scoring—being Black added points. This racial coding in actuarial models lasted until at least 1974 in California, where race was one of four factors on a parole worksheet.

The modern version uses recidivism as a proxy. But as Harcourt put it, "recidivism is the best proxy for recidivism." What this means is that the best predictor of future criminal contacts is prior criminal contacts. But criminal contacts reflect where police police—since policing concentrates in certain neighborhoods often correlated with race and class. So we're predicting policing patterns, not underlying dangerousness. The racial coding is still there, just one step removed.

Harcourt displayed two concrete examples:

**Federal Sentencing Guidelines:** A matrix with offense level on the vertical axis (points for crime type, gun use, FDIC-insured bank, etc.) and criminal history on the horizontal axis. For the same crime, your sentence roughly doubles if you have prior criminal activity.

**Virginia Sentencing Worksheet:** An actual judge's form where the judge adds points for factors like age under 35 (+12), less than 9th grade education (+4), not regularly employed (+5), multiple misdemeanor arrests (+15), no mental health treatment (+4), prior alcohol/drug treatment (+3). If you score 44+ points, your sentence can be multiplied by 100% or 300%. As Harcourt noted: "If you dropped out of school, you're going to get sentenced more. You don't have a regular job, you're going to get sentenced more."

### Punishment Theories Applied to Moretti (Comotana Fire)

Harcourt used the Comotana fire case (Mr. and Mrs. Moretti, club owners, 41 deaths) to test whether the major theories actually work in practice. The agreed facts: flammable foam on the ceiling, no inspections for five years, 41 dead. The assumed conviction: negligent homicide—objective unreasonableness, not awareness.

**Kantian (Retributivist) approach:** The core principle is that punishment cannot be instrumental toward other ends. "Treat people as ends, not as means." Focus on moral culpability or blameworthiness—get a measure of the person's moral failing, then punish proportionally to rectify the moral balance.

The problem with negligence: negligent homicide by definition means the defendant was NOT aware of the risk. How can there be moral failing without awareness? A Kantian might respond that the negligence finding reflects that they "were not morally reasonable"—their behaviors were unreasonable even if they didn't realize it. But this is unsatisfying. How do you "equilibrate" punishment when the moral failing is so unclear? In intentional homicide, "eye for an eye" makes sense. But here, it's just unclear whether the moral balance is skewed at all, let alone how to rectify it.

**Benthamite (Utilitarian) approach:** The core principle is that punishment is a "lesser evil." Every time you punish someone, you create pain, and pain is bad. Punishment is justified only if it prevents greater pain. The main form is deterrence: expected punishment (probability of detection times likely punishment) must exceed expected benefit.

The problem with negligence: the rational actor model fails. By definition, negligent actors weren't aware of the risk, so they couldn't have calculated costs and benefits. As Harcourt noted, "It was December 31st and people have been drinking a lot... There was a lot of music. It was techno, they were just like out of their minds." A student suggested the answer might be forfeiture of their wealth—which sounds more like compensation than deterrence, bringing us back to older punishment models.

**Becker's economic analysis:** Harcourt noted the sophisticated utilitarian response. It's not simple deterrence with rational actors. Putting someone in prison is a big cost to society. You'll never bring crime to zero—that would require a cop next to everyone. There's an "optimal level of crime" (including homicides, sexual assaults, club fires) that maximizes social welfare, not a goal of zero crime. The question is finding the "sweet spot" where marginal reduction in crime equals marginal cost of punishment.

## Punishment Theory

### Historical Perspective — Punishment Practices Change
Each era believed its methods were rational and just. Our current approach will seem barbaric to future generations. Use this to challenge "naturalness" of current punishment practices on exam.

### Two Major Theoretical Families

#### 1. Retributivism (Kantian)
**Core principle:** Punish because offender deserves it—backward-looking. "Treat people as ends, not as means." Punishment cannot be instrumental toward other ends. Focus on moral culpability/blameworthiness. Proportionality: punishment must equal wrongdoing.

**Originally a LIMITING principle:** Can't exceed what's deserved. Kant's extreme example: if a society disbands from an island, they must execute the murderer before leaving—otherwise they carry the moral failure with them. This sounds harsh but was meant to constrain punishment to moral desert.

**Application problems:** Negligence—how to measure moral failing without awareness? How to "equilibrate" punishment to moral wrongdoing when the wrongdoing is unclear?

#### 2. Utilitarianism (Benthamite)
**Core principle:** Punish to prevent greater future harm—forward-looking. Punishment is "pain"—inherently bad. Justified only if it prevents more pain than it inflicts (lesser evil).

**Forms:** Deterrence (general to others, specific to offender), incapacitation (physical removal), rehabilitation (transform offender).

**Deterrence formula:** Expected punishment = (Probability of detection) × (Likely punishment). Must exceed expected benefit of crime. Assumes rational actor.

**Economic sophistication (Becker):** "There's an optimal level of crime"—not zero. Must consider costs of policing and incarceration. Goal is maximizing social welfare, not minimizing crime.

### The Modern Actuarial Turn

**From individualized to predictive sentencing:** Indeterminate sentencing (c. 1910) used parole boards, "corrections" model, rehabilitation. Actuarial sentencing (1973-present) uses risk scores, recidivism predictors, fixed sentences.

**The actuarial problem:** "Recidivism is the best proxy for recidivism." Actually predicting criminal contacts (where police police), not dangerousness. Racially coded but "neutral" because uses priors.

**Examples:** Federal Sentencing Guidelines (offense level × criminal history). Virginia worksheet (points for age, education, employment, prior contacts). Characteristics like education/employment punish poverty.

## Magic Words — Professor Language to Echo

### When Discussing Retribution

Use these phrases on exam to signal you understand the Kantian framework: "Punishment cannot be instrumental toward other ends." "Treat people as ends, not as means." The focus is on "moral culpability" or "blameworthiness"—you must "get a measure of the person's moral failing." The punishment should "equilibrate" or be "proportional" to restore the "balance." For intentional crimes, "eye for an eye" makes sense, but negligence creates problems.

### When Discussing Deterrence

The core formula: "Expected punishment must exceed expected benefit." This equals "probability of detection times likely punishment." This assumes a "rational actor" making a "cost-benefit calculation." Distinguish "general deterrence" (deterring others) from "specific deterrence" (deterring the offender). The Benthamite insight is that punishment is a "lesser evil"—"punishment is pain, and pain is bad."

### When Critiquing Current System

Use Harcourt's phrasing: "Recidivism is the best proxy for recidivism"—we're "predicting criminal contacts, not dangerousness." Acknowledge "we've done 360s in punishment practices" and "each era believed its methods were right." Challenge whether our current actuarial approach will seem barbaric in the future.

### When Discussing Historical Change

"Trial by battle made sense" because it relied on "divine intervention" rather than "ignorant laypeople" on a jury. Early systems used "blood geld" (monetary compensation for harm) and "oath-taking" (social status as proxy for honesty). Foucault documents the shift to "panopticism" (disciplinary society) and then to "warehousing" (mass incapacitation).

## Prewrite Opportunities

### 1. Punishment Theory Essay

**Prompt:** "The criminal law has shifted dramatically in its approach to punishment over the past century. Discuss how this shift reflects changing assumptions about human behavior and social order."

**Outline:**

I. Introduction — The historical pendulum. Forms of punishment have changed dramatically, and each era believed its methods were right. Our current approach is no more "natural" than trial by battle.

II. Indeterminate sentencing era (c. 1910). Individualized assessment, rehabilitation model, Departments of "Corrections," parole board discretion. Assumed experts could determine who was reformed and when.

III. Actuarial turn (1973-present). From rehabilitation to incapacitation. Risk assessment and recidivism predictors. "Recidivism is the best proxy for recidivism"—predicting policing, not dangerousness.

IV. Theoretical foundations. Kantian retributivism (moral deservingness) vs. Benthamite utilitarianism (lesser evil, deterrence). Both were originally LIMITING principles.

V. Critique. Assumptions about rationality fail. Circular prediction logic. Racial coding through "neutral" factors. Historical contingency of current practices—each era thinks it's progressive.

VI. Conclusion — Future transformations inevitable. Our actuarial/warehousing approach will seem barbaric to future generations, just as Damien's execution seems to us.

### 2. Sentencing Challenge Hypo

**Fact Pattern:** Defendant, age 28, 10th grade education, intermittently employed. Convicted of negligent homicide after workplace accident. Two prior misdemeanor arrests (disorderly conduct). No prior incarceration.

**Analysis:**

Under a Virginia-style worksheet: Age under 35 (+12), no college (+4), not regularly employed (+5), 2 misdemeanors (+15), no prior incarceration (0). Total: 36 points → Level 2 or 3, sentence multiplied 100-300%.

**Kantian challenge:** Negligence means no awareness of risk. Where is the "moral failing" required for retribution? Punishment using defendant as means to deter others violates the "ends not means" principle.

**Utilitarian challenge:** General deterrence requires other employers to actually calculate risk. The rational actor assumption fails—negligent actors by definition aren't calculating. Better argument: Becker's economic analysis of "optimal level of workplace safety" considering all costs.

**Actuarial challenge:** Points for age, education, employment punish poverty. Recidivism predicts policing, not dangerousness. Sentence doubling based on priors multiplies existing disparities.

### 3. Foucault Transformation Essay

**Prompt:** "Has the transformation from corporal to disciplinary punishment represented progress, or merely a change in the form of social control?"

**Arguments FOR progress:** From public torture to clinical execution ("euthanizing your dog"). From arbitrary punishment to standardized guidelines. From brutal physical punishment to time-based sentences.

**Arguments AGAINST (Foucaultian):** Panopticism creates more pervasive control—Bentham's panopticon means constant surveillance without needing actual guards. Warehousing is mass incarceration without rehabilitation. Actuarial punishment is disguised discrimination. **Each era believes it's progressive.**

**Exam move:** Quote Harcourt: "We in America tend to think that this is probably the best way to do it... In the same way in which back then, we would have thought, well, let's just trial by battle, it's the only way to solve this." This humility about current practices is the Foucaultian insight.

### 4. Deterrence Critique

**Prompt:** "Deterrence theory assumes rational actors weighing costs and benefits. Discuss whether this assumption holds in the context of negligence crimes."

**Argument 1: Rational actor model fails for negligence.** By definition, negligence is failure to perceive risk. Can't weigh costs/benefits of unknown risks. Comotana example: New Year's Eve, intoxication, party atmosphere—"out of their minds."

**Argument 2: General deterrence also problematic.** Most people don't know sentencing ranges. Negligent actors by definition not calculating. "Expected punishment" calculation requires awareness of both risk and penalty.

**Argument 3: Utilitarian response.** Becker's sophistication: it's about social welfare optimization, not individual calculation. "Optimal level of crime" accounts for imperfect deterrence. Focus on systemic incentives, not individual rationality. This is a more sophisticated utilitarianism that doesn't require each actor to be rational.

---

## Policy Arguments

### For Prosecution

**Kantian framing:** The negligence finding reflects objective unreasonableness. Even if they weren't subjectively aware, a reasonable person would have recognized the danger. Moral failure exists even without subjective awareness—"they were acting in an unreasonable way, and maybe that is enough."

**Utilitarian framing:** General deterrence—punish to "set an example for other club owners." The high benefit from cutting corners (wealth, popularity) creates need for high punishment to make cost-benefit analysis favor safety. As one student noted, these tragedies are "so common" and "people aren't waking up—we need to wake people up."

**Economic framing:** Calculate expected benefit (wealth from popular club) and set punishment to exceed it. Consider forfeiture of gains as the punishment itself—returning to blood geld model of compensation.

### For Defense

**Kantian challenge:** Negligence means no awareness. "To make the defendant punishable... is in some sense to treat them as a means" to deter others, violating the categorical imperative. It's hard to "equilibrate" punishment when the moral wrongdoing is unclear.

**Utilitarian challenge:** Rational actor model doesn't apply. Client "wasn't doing this calculation." Context matters: intoxication, party atmosphere, "out of their minds." Also note **state failure**—no inspections for five years means the state enabled or at least failed to prevent the harm.

**Actuarial challenge:** Punishment predicts future policing, not dangerousness. Characteristics like education and employment punish poverty. Sentence doubling based on priors multiplies existing disparities rather than correcting them. "Recidivism is the best proxy for recidivism"—circular and coded.

## Meta-Learning: Harcourt's Teaching Method

### The Historical Framework as Critique

Harcourt began with 15+ minutes on historical punishment practices. This wasn't trivia—it establishes that our current practices are NOT natural or inevitable, but historically contingent and destined to change. On exam, when writing about punishment theory, demonstrate you understand current approaches are just one phase in a long history.

### "Both Originally Limiting Theories"

Critical meta-point: Both Kant and Bentham were trying to REDUCE punishment, not increase it. Retribution and utilitarianism were enlightenment responses to "dark ages" with arbitrary, excessive punishment. On exam, don't present retribution as vengeance or utilitarianism as maximal punishment—frame them as competing LIMITING principles that have been distorted in modern application.

### Real-World Application

Harcourt used the Comotana fire (Moretti) as ongoing example throughout. This tests whether theories actually work in practice. The key tension exposed: Kantian retributivism struggles with negligence (no moral awareness), Benthamite deterrence struggles with irrational human behavior, and actuarial sentencing "works" but is racially coded. These tensions are exam gold for showing sophisticated understanding.

---

## Questions for Office Hours / Further Review

1. **Negligence and retribution:** If negligence by definition lacks awareness, how can Kantian retributivism justify punishing it? Is objective unreasonableness enough for "moral failing"?

2. **Becker's optimal crime:** How do we determine the "optimal" level? How does this abstract economic theory get implemented in actual sentencing guidelines?

3. **Actuarial circularity:** If recidivism predicts criminal contacts and criminal contacts reflect policing patterns, how do we break this cycle? Is there any way to make actuarial prediction legitimate?

4. **Foucault's panopticism:** How does the panoptic prison model differ from current "warehousing" approach? Are we still in the disciplinary era or has it transformed again?

5. **Kant's extreme example:** The society disbanding from an island that must execute the murderer first—is this meant to be taken seriously or is it reductio ad absurdum against strict retributivism?

---

## Exam Strategy Notes

### When You See Punishment Theory on Exam

1. **Identify which theory justifies the position.** Prosecutor: likely deterrence/retribution combo. Defense: challenge assumptions of deployed theory.

2. **Show historical awareness.** Current practices are contingent, not natural. Quote: "Each era believed its methods were right."

3. **Distinguish original purpose from current application.** Retribution and utilitarianism were LIMITING theories; today often used to MAXIMIZE punishment.

4. **Apply actuarial critique.** "Recidivism predicts policing, not dangerousness." Challenge risk scores as coded discrimination.

5. **Use the economic sophistication.** "Optimal level of crime" not zero. Cost-benefit includes policing and incarceration costs.

### For Policy Essay Specifically

Harcourt's exam priorities (from prep): synthesize across bodies of literature; show how theories "don't speak the same language" but interact; original argument, not summary.

**Prewrite template:** "While [retribution/deterrence] assumes X, [critical theory/Balkin/feminist] reveals Y. This acoustic separation between discourses obscures how punishment actually functions in the [case/context]. By applying [Foucault/Harcourt's insight about historical contingency], we can see that..."

## Personal Reflection

### What I Need to Review

1. **Foucault's *Discipline and Punish*** — Thursday's class will focus on this
2. **Burgess method details** — The 21 factors, how they operated in practice
3. **Gary Becker's economic model** — The optimization function for social welfare
4. **Sentencing guidelines mechanics** — Federal and state systems

### Confidence Level

- **Historical transformation:** Solid (blood geld → trial by battle → actuarial)
- **Kantian retributivism:** Good (ends not means, moral culpability, but problematic for negligence)
- **Benthamite utilitarianism:** Good (lesser evil, deterrence formula, Becker sophistication)
- **Actuarial sentencing:** Strong (recidivism critique, worksheet examples)
- **Foucault connection:** Need Thursday's class (panopticism, disciplinary society)

### Study Priorities Before Next Class

1. Read Foucault's *Discipline and Punish* (assigned for Thursday)
2. Review actuarial sentencing examples
3. Prepare for discussion of panopticism
4. Think through: How does Foucault connect to punishment theory critique?

---

## Next Class Prep

**Class 10 (Feb 12):** Foucault's *Discipline and Punish*

From syllabus: Continue punishment theory discussion; Foucault's transformation from corporal to disciplinary punishment; panopticism concept; how Foucault challenges traditional theories.

**Action items:** Read *Discipline and Punish* excerpts carefully. Think about: Is modern incarceration "disciplinary" or just "warehousing"? Consider: How does Foucault's historical analysis connect to Harcourt's actuarial critique?
