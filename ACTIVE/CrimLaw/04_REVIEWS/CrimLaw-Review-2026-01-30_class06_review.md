## 1. STATUTE/RULE AS HARCOURT FRAMED IT

### A. Felony Murder Basics — The Strict Liability Turn

**Core concept:** Felony murder evacuates the mens rea for homicide and replaces it with an attendant circumstance (the underlying felony).

> "What the felony murder rule is basically doing is kind of evacuating the mens rea associated to the Cause it causing death and replacing it with a Attendant circumstance, and in a way. You can think about it as creating strict liability." (Transcript 2026-01-30)

> "It's, it's strict liability on the homicide piece. Right? So if you engage in any other felony, that's it" (Transcript 2026-01-30)

**Traditional common law elements (agency version):**
1. A death
2. During commission/attempt/immediate flight from a qualifying felony
3. Defendant was a participant in the felony
4. The killing was committed by the defendant or another participant, and is sufficiently connected to the felony

**Prof's key framing:** These cases can fit in two analytical tracks:
- **Track 1 (Mens rea track):** Could charge as reckless/extreme recklessness → manslaughter or depraved indifference murder
- **Track 2 (Felony murder track):** Evacuate mens rea entirely; strict liability on the killing; just prove the underlying felony

> "These cases can be thought of through different lenses. And I could imagine as a prosecutor. In some of these felony murder cases, Charging the person with reckless behavior. Right. Instead of necessarily going with felony murder" (Transcript 2026-01-30)

**Example (Stamp case applied to NY statute):**
- Armed robbery with gun → could be extreme recklessness with depraved indifference to human life (NY 125.25(2) — second-degree murder)
- Or: just reckless → manslaughter 2d (NY 125.15(1))
- Or: felony murder → evacuate the mens rea entirely

### B. The Draconian British Origin (Regina v. Serné, 1887)

**Serné facts (from class discussion):**
- D owned business with home above; financial problems
- Took out insurance on home, business, and disabled son
- 3 weeks later: set 3-4 fires (strategically placed); two sons died
- Charged with felony murder

> "The insurance seems kind of damning, uh, some damning evidence, and, uh, and you're right, the way that the fire breaks out, it seems as if it's, it's not just one incident" (Transcript 2026-01-30)

**Judge Stephen's jury instructions:**
- Almost a directed verdict ("God forbid that I should...produce in your minds even the smallest degree of any feeling against prison, but the evidence")
- But: jury found NOT GUILTY (verdict: not guilty)

**Key doctrinal move by Stephen:** He *narrows* the old draconian British rule

> "It would be reasonable to say that any act known to be dangerous to life and likely in itself to cause death, done for the purpose of committing a felony which causes death, should be murder" (Transcript 2026-01-30)

**Prof's description of the old British law (from Edward Coke's Institutes, 1644):**

> "If you're on, if you're on B's property and you shoot a deer, um, and you kill a boy, then that is murder. However, if you are the owner of the park or the property and you shoot at the deer and you accidentally kill the boy...It's misadventure, and no felony." (Transcript 2026-01-30)

- **Pure property-based:** Trespass (felony) + death = felony murder; no trespass = excused homicide
- No foreseeability, no knowledge requirement — just: was there an underlying felony?

> "So if it's a trespass, which is illegal, then felony murder. This guy gets hanged. Whereas the same act done by the owner...is not a homicide because there's no underlying felony." (Transcript 2026-01-30)

**Prof's point:** Serné tries to add a *knowledge* requirement ("known to be dangerous to life"), but U.S. law mostly reverted to strict liability (see Stamp).

### C. People v. Stamp (California 1969) — The Strict Liability Anchor

**Stamp facts (from class discussion):**
- Armed robbery (maybe toy gun? Prof hypothesizes various scenarios)
- Victim: obese, 60 years old, preexisting heart condition
- During robbery: victim suffered fatal heart attack (fright/shock)
- D convicted of felony murder

**Prof's hypothetical:**
> "Maybe Mr. Stamp. In the stamp case had a toy gun. Maybe he had a plastic gun, maybe he knew...I really don't wanna kill anybody...maybe it's just a plastic gun. In the stamp case, the point is it doesn't matter, buddy." (Transcript 2026-01-30)

> "You could have taken all the precautions you want...If Mr. Stant has a heart attack...Doesn't matter, right? You didn't intend, you even tried to take precautions...It doesn't matter, strict liability, you get it, right?" (Transcript 2026-01-30)

**Eggshell victim logic:**
> "In torture [torts] you're going to do something where...you take your plaintiff as you find them...Here too, it's kind of like. The logic of the felony murder is, you know. The death wasn't intended by any stretch of the imagination...doesn't matter" (Transcript 2026-01-30)

**Court's language:** "A felon is held strictly liable for all killings committed by him or his accomplices in the course of the felony. No foreseeability requirement."

### D. State v. Canola (NJ 1977) — Agency Theory vs. Proximate Cause

**Canola facts:**
- 4 co-defendants robbing jewelry store
- Shootout: store owner and one robber both killed
- Store owner killed by a robber; robber killed by the store owner
- Question: Is Canola liable for co-felon's death (killed by victim)?

**Holding:** Adopt **agency theory** → felon NOT liable for co-felon's death when killed by victim

- **Agency theory (majority):** Killing must be by defendant or accomplice
- **Proximate cause (minority):** Any death proximately caused during felony

**Court's language (critical for exam):**

> "The most modern progressive thought in criminal jurisprudence favors restricting, restriction rather than expansion of the felony murder rule, right? A couple of lines down, it appears to us regressive to extend the application of the felony murder rule to lethal acts of third persons not in furtherance of the felonious scheme" (Transcript 2026-01-30)

**Prof's framing:** This is a *narrowing* move (court explicitly uses "progressive" vs "regressive" language)

### E. The New Yorker Case (Sadik Baxter) — Extreme Unforeseeability

**Baxter facts (from class discussion + prep doc):**
- D and co-defendant breaking into cars to steal cash
- D arrested by police (in custody, miles away)
- Co-defendant drives away, police chase, kills two cyclists
- D charged with felony murder for the cyclists' deaths

> "So how, in that case, uh, where does that kind of fit here? Is it more like old UK law? Is it more like, is it like stamp?...Like Transplanting the mens rea for the first crime into the second one, and I feel like that is just so clear here because like Baxter wasn't even present when it happened" (Transcript 2026-01-30)

**Prof's characterization:**
> "That's the, that's kind of like the most strict liability you can imagine, right? I mean, because also. There's even, there's like no connection between, well, I mean, I don't know, it's hard to connect, breaking into cars to steal money...And then the chase that leads to the death of the cyclists" (Transcript 2026-01-30)

> "It'd be hard to say that that causing death was reckless in any way...you're pretty much in a pure [strict liability case]" (Transcript 2026-01-30)

**Defense argument from class:** Police shouldn't have initiated the chase (policy violation) → even less foreseeability

---

## 2. THE BIG POLICY DEBATE (Rules vs. Standards Redux)

### A. Prosecutor's Arguments (Why Keep Strict Liability?)

**Efficiency / Deterrence:**
- Severe punishment for any felony with death → deters felonies generally
- "If we punish every, if we punisher breaking into cars...by death. Then that might have a deterrent effect" (Prof hypothetical)

**Expressive Function:**
- Law expresses moral condemnation
- "The law has an expressive function...that actually the law has a, a moral education function" (Transcript 2026-01-30)

### B. Defense Arguments (Why Narrow/Abolish Felony Murder?)

**1. No Deterrence for Unforeseeable Deaths:**

> "Are you gonna, are you gonna deter breaking into cars? By sentencing someone to life in prison...Are you gonna sentence someone to death for breaking into cars?" (Transcript 2026-01-30)

> "Gerard or Casasa or Mayer. We're in a in a in a mental state where deterrence was not going to have an effect...these people when they're acting in this way...he's not thinking about consequences" (Transcript 2026-01-30 — from heat of passion discussion, same logic applies)

**2. Perverse Incentives / No Marginal Deterrence:**

> "What you don't get is what's called marginal deterrence. You're not getting any marginal deterrence because if everything is punished by death, what the fuck?...If, if uh, if you're a robber, and you got a gun, and you're robbing someone, and you're gonna be sentenced to death anyway. Well, get rid of the, get rid of the witness." (Transcript 2026-01-30)

**Prof's example:**
- UK/U.S. history: when all felonies = death penalty, jurors wouldn't convict OR mercy/clemency systems emerged
- If you lose marginal deterrence, criminals have incentive to escalate (kill witnesses, etc.)

**3. Moral Blameworthiness / Proportionality:**

> "That just seems very basically unfair and unjust" (student re: Baxter case)

- Breaking into cars ≠ first-degree murder culpability
- Death penalty/life sentence for car break-ins = disproportionate

**4. Unforeseeability:**
- In cases like Baxter: defendant miles away, in handcuffs, can't foresee co-defendant's police chase
- Even Stamp: if using toy gun, taking precautions → still strict liability

---

## 3. ELEMENT FIGHTS / BOUNDARIES (Where Outcomes Change)

### A. Which Felonies Qualify?

**Old British law (Coke):** ANY felony (including trespass)

**Serné (Stephen's narrowing):** Felonies "known to be dangerous to life and likely in itself to cause death"

**Modern variations:**
- Enumerated list (e.g., certain states list specific felonies)
- "Inherently dangerous" test
- "Dangerous to life" limitation

**Exam move:** Argue enumerated vs. inherently dangerous; cite Serné for knowledge/foreseeability requirement

### B. When Is It "During" the Felony?

**Time-framing fights:**
- Commission vs. attempt vs. immediate flight
- Baxter case: was the chase "during" the car break-ins? D already arrested?

**Causal connection:**
- "In furtherance of" the felony
- Canola language: "not in furtherance of the felonious scheme"

### C. Who Must Do the Killing? (Agency vs. Proximate Cause)

**Agency theory (Canola majority):**
- Killing must be by defendant or accomplice
- Third-party killings (victim, police) → no felony murder

**Proximate cause theory (minority):**
- Any death proximately caused during felony
- Victim shoots co-felon → still felony murder for survivors

**Exam signal:** If a third party (victim, police, bystander) does the killing, this is the fight

### D. Foreseeability (Jurisdictional Split)

**Strict liability (Stamp / Florida / old British law):**
- No foreseeability required
- "Felon takes victim as he finds him" (eggshull logic)

**Foreseeability required (some modern statutes / Serné's instruction):**
- Death must be foreseeable consequence of the felony
- Knowledge that act was "dangerous to life"

## 4. MAGIC WORDS / PROF LANGUAGE TO ECHO

### A. Core Concepts

**"Evacuating the mens rea":**
> "What the felony murder rule is basically doing is kind of evacuating the mens rea associated to the Cause it causing death and replacing it with a Attendant circumstance" (Transcript 2026-01-30)

**"Strict liability on the homicide piece":**
> "You can think about it as creating strict liability...It's, it's strict liability on the homicide piece" (Transcript 2026-01-30)

**"Two tracks":**
> "These cases can be thought of through different lenses...Charging the person with reckless behavior. Right. Instead of necessarily going with felony murder" (Transcript 2026-01-30)

### B. Policy Arguments

**"Marginal deterrence":**
> "What you don't get is what's called marginal deterrence" (Transcript 2026-01-30)

**"Expressive function":**
> "The law has an expressive function...that actually the law has a, a moral education function" (Transcript 2026-01-30)

**"Progressive vs. regressive" (Canola language):**
> "The most modern progressive thought in criminal jurisprudence favors restricting...it appears to us regressive to extend the application" (Transcript 2026-01-30)

### C. Historical Framing

**"Draconian British law":**
> "The old British law. Which would have been draconian in that way. The only distinction is whether or not there's an underlying felony" (Transcript 2026-01-30)

**"Property genealogy":**
> "You get a real sense of the property, the private property genealogy of this crime, right? Because it's all based on property rights" (Transcript 2026-01-30)

### D. Fact Patterns

**"Take your plaintiff as you find them" / "Eggshell victim":**
> "In torture [torts] you're going to do something where...you take your plaintiff as you find them...Here too" (Transcript 2026-01-30)

**"Doesn't matter, buddy":**
> "Maybe it's just a plastic gun. In the stamp case, the point is it doesn't matter, buddy" (Transcript 2026-01-30)

## 5. PREWRITE FRAGMENTS (Exam-Ready Micro-Arguments)

### Fragment 1: Evacuating Mens Rea / Strict Liability Nature

**Situation:** Prosecutor charges felony murder; defense argues lack of intent/foreseeability

**Defense move:**
"Felony murder evacuates the mens rea for the killing and replaces it with an attendant circumstance—the underlying felony. This creates strict liability on the homicide piece, meaning the defendant is held responsible for any death that occurs during the felony, regardless of intent, knowledge, or foreseeability. This is fundamentally at odds with the culpability principle that punishment should be proportional to moral blameworthiness. Here, [defendant] committed [underlying felony], but there was no mens rea as to the death—no purpose, knowledge, or even recklessness regarding the victim's death. Strict liability for first-degree murder treats breaking into cars the same as premeditated killing."

**Prosecutor response:**
"The attendant circumstance IS the mens rea. By choosing to commit [armed robbery / arson / etc.], defendant demonstrated extreme recklessness with indifference to human life. Carrying a gun to rob someone is inherently dangerous—'shit can happen,' including accidental discharge, victim resistance, police intervention. This is extreme recklessness under NY 125.25(2) or recklessness at minimum under 125.15(1). Felony murder simply acknowledges that choosing to commit dangerous felonies supplies the culpability for resulting deaths."

### Fragment 2: Foreseeability Limitation (Serné vs. Stamp)

**Situation:** Death was highly unforeseeable (Baxter-type facts; toy gun; heart attack)

**Defense move:**
"Regina v. Serné rejected the draconian British rule that 'any felony + any death = murder.' Judge Stephen held that felony murder should be limited to acts 'known to be dangerous to life and likely in itself to cause death.' Here, [defendant's conduct] was not known to be dangerous to life. [Defendant was miles away in handcuffs / used a toy gun / victim had rare preexisting condition]. This death was not a foreseeable consequence of [car break-ins / etc.]. Even under the 'eggshell victim' logic of Stamp, there must be some baseline foreseeability that the felonious conduct could cause death. Extending felony murder to these facts is 'regressive' (Canola) and defeats the proportionality principle."

**Prosecutor response:**
"Stamp explicitly rejected a foreseeability requirement: 'A felon is held strictly liable for all killings committed by him or his accomplices in the course of the felony.' The 'eggshell victim' rule applies—defendant takes victims as he finds them. If the victim has a heart condition, that's the risk defendant assumed when committing the felony. The entire point of felony murder is that defendants who choose to commit inherently dangerous felonies bear the risk of any resulting deaths, foreseeable or not."

### Fragment 3: Marginal Deterrence Problem

**Situation:** Arguing against draconian punishment for low-level felonies

**Defense move:**
"Imposing life sentences or death penalty for [car break-ins] eliminates marginal deterrence. If breaking into cars carries the same penalty as intentional murder, defendants have no incentive to avoid escalating violence—'if you're gonna be sentenced to death anyway, well, get rid of the witness.' Historically, this was the UK's experience with universal death penalty: jurors refused to convict, or kings granted mercy, because the punishments were disproportionate. Felony murder without foreseeability limits creates perverse incentives to escalate violence because there's no marginal cost to killing witnesses or victims."

**Prosecutor response:**
"Marginal deterrence still exists—the choice is between committing the felony (and risking felony murder liability) or not committing it at all. The deterrent is ex ante: don't rob people at gunpoint. Once you've made that choice, you've assumed the risk. Moreover, felony murder has a strong expressive function: it signals that society will not tolerate dangerous felonies that result in death, and this moral education effect changes behavior over time."

### Fragment 4: Agency vs. Proximate Cause (Canola Issue)

**Situation:** Victim or police kill someone during the felony

**Defense move:**
"Under the agency theory adopted in Canola, felony murder requires that the killing be committed by the defendant or an accomplice. Here, [store owner / police officer] killed [co-defendant / victim]. This was not an act 'in furtherance of the felonious scheme' but a defensive/responsive act by a third party. As Canola held, 'modern progressive thought in criminal jurisprudence favors restricting rather than expansion of the felony murder rule.' Imposing liability for third-party killings extends felony murder beyond its culpability rationale—defendant did not pull the trigger, and tort-style proximate cause is inappropriate for first-degree murder."

**Prosecutor response (minority/proximate cause jurisdictions):**
"Proximate cause theory holds defendants responsible for deaths that are the direct and foreseeable consequence of their felonious conduct. By initiating [the armed robbery / etc.], defendant set in motion a chain of events that foreseeably led to [victim's death / co-felon's death]. The victim's act of self-defense, or the police officer's use of force, was a direct response to defendant's felony. This is analogous to tort law's proximate cause analysis: 'but for' defendant's felony, no one would have died. Limiting liability to 'agency' creates an arbitrary line and allows felons to escape responsibility for the natural consequences of their dangerous conduct."

### Fragment 5: Time-Framing / "During" the Felony (Baxter-Type Facts)

**Situation:** Death occurs after arrest, during flight, or at significant temporal/spatial distance

**Defense move:**
"Felony murder requires that the death occur 'during commission, attempt, or immediate flight' from the felony. Here, defendant was already arrested and in handcuffs—the felony (car break-ins) was complete. The police chase and resulting deaths occurred [miles away / hours later] as a result of the co-defendant's independent decision to flee and the police's decision to pursue (possibly in violation of chase policies). This death was not 'in the course of' or 'in furtherance of' the original felony. The causal chain was broken by [arrest / intervening acts]. Imposing felony murder liability here stretches the 'during' requirement beyond recognition."

**Prosecutor response:**
"'Immediate flight' is part of the felony for purposes of felony murder. The co-defendant was fleeing from the same criminal episode (the car break-ins), and defendant is liable for his accomplice's actions under accomplice liability principles. The fact that defendant was arrested doesn't sever the causal connection—the chase was a direct consequence of the ongoing criminal enterprise. Felony murder applies to 'all killings committed by him or his accomplices in the course of the felony' (Stamp), and flight is part of 'the course of the felony.'"

## 6. OPEN QUESTIONS / TO FOLLOW UP

### A. Model Penal Code Approach

**Prof teed this up but didn't finish:**
> "Uh, with the model penal code. Uh, section 210.2.1, point B on Tuesday" (Transcript 2026-01-30)

**From prep doc:** MPC likely requires some level of culpability for the death (e.g., recklessness with extreme indifference), rather than pure strict liability.

**Action item:** Review MPC § 210.2(1)(b) for next class—how does it differ from common law felony murder?

### B. Institutional/Racial Justice Dimensions (Stillman Article)

**Prof flagged these issues:**
- Felony murder as "plea leverage" tool
- Racial disparities in charging (Wisconsin, St. Louis data)
- U.S. retention/expansion while UK/Commonwealth abolished it

**From prep doc:**
> "Framing claim: the U.S. retains/expands felony murder even after the U.K. and other Commonwealth countries abolished it (Bentley execution → abolition), and felony-murder charging surged in the 1970s alongside mass incarceration"

**Potential exam angle:** Policy question asking about institutional consequences of felony murder; cite Stillman/Baxter for real-world impacts

### C. Historical Arc (Mercy/Clemency System)

**Prof's aside on UK history:**
> "A whole system of mercy, uh, and clemency came into place. Whereby the king would grant mercy to people...that granting of mercy was, Used as a way to govern...it gave a lot of legitimacy. To the monarchy" (Transcript 2026-01-30)

**Cited source:** Douglas Hay, *Albion's Fatal Tree* + E.P. Thompson

**Exam relevance:** Shows why draconian punishment regimes require safety valves (mercy, jury nullification, prosecutorial discretion); connects to marginal deterrence problem

---

## 7. CONNECTIONS TO OTHER DOCTRINES

### A. Back to Heat of Passion / EED (Rules vs. Standards)

**Prof's explicit callback:**
> "And as I'm going to suggest, it's the kind of arguments that you make very often. In criminal law...we're about to do or what we are doing is about the crystalline structure of law, right? Just listen to the back of your head that the arguments we're gonna be making in the context of something different. Which is felony murder." (Transcript 2026-01-30)

**Same arguments, different context:**
- **Deterrence:** Can you deter people in extreme emotional disturbance? Can you deter people who commit felonies with unforeseeable deaths?
- **Moral blameworthiness:** Is Girard less culpable than cold-blooded killer? Is Baxter less culpable than intentional murderer?
- **Expressive function:** Should law condemn femicide? Should law condemn dangerous felonies?

### B. Foreseeability (Torts Overlap)

**Prof flagged this:**
> "And the, and the back and forth is gonna be that...these are the typical arguments, by the way, that you get in your torts class. It's questions of foreseeability" (Transcript 2026-01-30)

**Eggshell plaintiff/victim:**
- Torts: take your plaintiff as you find them
- Felony murder (Stamp): take your victim as you find them (heart condition, etc.)

### C. Negligence / Recklessness Crimes

**Same deterrence problem:**
> "The same kind of argument about why you would not want to hold someone. Guilty for a negligent crime is the same kind of argument you're making right now...the person wasn't aware. Of the unreasonableness of their action...How are you going to deter that?" (Transcript 2026-01-30)

**Takeaway:** Deterrence rationale weakens when defendant lacks awareness/foreseeability

---

## 8. NEXT CLASS PREP

**MPC § 210.2(1)(b)** — Prof will cover how MPC treats felony murder (presumably adds culpability requirement)

**Carry forward:** Policy arguments about deterrence, marginal deterrence, foreseeability, agency vs. proximate cause
