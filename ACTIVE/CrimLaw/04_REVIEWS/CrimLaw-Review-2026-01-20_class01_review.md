# Review — Class #1 — 2026-01-20 — Criminal Law and Justice

---

## 1. What Professor Emphasized (3-5 main points)

1. Criminal law shapes the social order; politics and morality operate through “neutral” doctrine. #EXAM_SIGNAL
2. The “crime → punishment” story is descriptively wrong; there is a disjuncture between crime and punishment. #EXAM_SIGNAL
3. Mass incarceration is the background condition: punishment institutions reproduce hierarchies (race/class/gender) and must stay in view while reading cases. #EXAM_SIGNAL
4. “Justice” is the semester-long throughline: write a one-sentence definition and keep revising it against cases and institutions. #EXAM_SIGNAL
5. The criminal process roadmap (arrest → charging → trial → sentencing → appeal/habeas) is the backbone for everything we do.

---

## 2. Exam Signals #EXAM_SIGNAL

**Explicit signals:**
- [ ] “This is going to be the most important chart you’ll ever see in your whole entire life.” — criminal process roadmap (KSSB chart) #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] “Hold on to your definition of justice… I will come back and ask you what that sentence is.” #EXAM_SIGNAL

**Implicit signals:**
- [ ] The course is not “doctrine in a vacuum”: every doctrinal unit gets evaluated against institutional reality (incarceration; disparities). #EXAM_SIGNAL
- [ ] Elements (actus reus / mens rea) are treated as the “building blocks” you must be able to mix-and-match and explain cleanly. #EXAM_SIGNAL

---

## 3. Corrections to Prep

**My prep said:** Class 1 is “foundational; defining justice; no doctrine yet,” centered on *Just Mercy* and a high-level overview of the criminal process.
**Prof clarified:** Same agenda, but he anchored it in a larger claim about criminal law’s function in producing social hierarchy (not merely responding to “crime”) and used incarceration statistics to force that frame from day 1.
**Fix:** Treat every future case as doctrine + institutional output: “What does this rule do in the world?” belongs in every case brief and exam answer.

**My prediction:** The discussion would stay mostly at book-level moral critique (McMillian, prosecutors, jury override, etc.).
**Actually emphasized:** The book is a gateway to a methodological posture: define justice; keep it; interrogate “neutral” rules as power-structuring.
**Lesson:** Keep a running “justice definition” paragraph in the outline and update it as doctrine arrives.

---

## 4. Doctrinal Insights

**New understanding:**
- Even before doctrine, the course posture is interpretive: doctrine supplies vocabulary, but the target is how legal rules interact with institutions (policing, prosecution, prisons).
- “Elements” (actus reus / mens rea) are treated as modular parts that make criminal law flexible and contestable.

**Statutory/professor moves:**
- The “crime → punishment” narrative is treated as ideology (naturalization): start from the possibility that punishment institutions do something other than “respond.”
- “Justice” is operationalized as a recurring test: does the case/rule/institution satisfy your one-sentence definition?

---

## 5. Policy Arguments

**Strong arguments prof rewarded:**
- Justice can be assessed by how society treats the poor/disfavored/incarcerated; “the opposite of poverty is justice.”
- “Everyone is more than the worst thing they’ve ever done” as a critique of purely retributive punishment.

**Strong critiques prof anticipated:**
- Justice vs. democracy tension: “community pressure” (especially after heinous crime) can drive punishment away from what is just.
- Mercy for the “undeserving” is the hard case (not mercy for the innocent).

**Exam-ready policy paragraphs:**
- **Disjuncture thesis:** Punishment institutions are not calibrated to “crime rates”; they distribute power and vulnerability through policing, prosecution, and incarceration.
- **Just mercy thesis:** A justice system that treats people as permanently defined by their worst act (or by stigma) forecloses redemption and entrenches racialized vulnerability.

## 6. Outline Inserts (copy-ready)

> Paste-ready blocks to add into `05_OUTLINE/` without rewriting.

### Insert: Course Frame — Crime/Punishment Disjuncture

```markdown
**Frame:** Criminal law is not merely a neutral response to “crime.” Punishment institutions can function to structure social order (race/class/gender hierarchies) even while doctrine appears apolitical.

**Method:** For each doctrinal rule, ask:
1) What conduct/mental state does the rule define?
2) What institutions apply it (police/prosecutors/juries/judges/prisons)?
3) What distributional consequences follow (who gets stopped/charged/convicted/incarcerated)?

#EXAM_SIGNAL
```

### Insert: Justice Definition Prompt (Recurring)

```markdown
**Justice (working definition):** [1 sentence, period at end.]

**Use:** Revisit and revise the definition against each unit; treat it as a lens for evaluating doctrine + institutions.

#EXAM_SIGNAL
```

### Insert: Criminal Process Roadmap (High-Level)

```markdown
Investigation → Arrest → Charging/Complaint → (Grand Jury/Indictment where used) → Arraignment → Motions → Trial → Verdict → Sentencing → Direct Appeal → Collateral Review (state/federal habeas, etc.)

#EXAM_SIGNAL
```

### Cases

| ☐ | Case Name | Rule/Holding | Exam Point | New/Update |
|---|-----------|--------------|------------|------------|
| ☐ | *(No doctrine cases in Class 1)* | — | — | — |

### Statutes/Rules

| ☐ | Citation | Key Provision | Prof's Interpretation |
|---|----------|---------------|----------------------|
| ☐ | (None) | — | — |

### Readings/Scholars

| ☐ | Source | Main Point | Prof's Use |
|---|--------|------------|-----------|
| ☐ | Bryan Stevenson, *Just Mercy* | Justice/mercy as institutional critique | Core text for “justice” framing |
| ☐ | KSSB10 1–19 (Structure of the Criminal Justice System) | Criminal process roadmap | “Most important chart” backbone |
| ☐ | W.E.B. Du Bois (named) | Racialized institutional legacy | Used to frame incarceration as historical continuity |
| ☐ | Loïc Wacquant (named; transcript unclear) | Slavery → Jim Crow → ghetto/prison linkage | Sociological causal narrative (needs verification) |

## 8. Prewrite Opportunities

> Potential exam questions arising from this lecture. Flag for `06_PREWRITES/`.

### Doctrinal Prewrites Identified

| ☐ | Doctrine | Question Type | Prof's Framework | Priority |
|---|----------|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| ☐ | Actus reus / mens rea (preview) | Issue-spotter | Elements as “building blocks” | High |

### Policy Prewrites Identified

| ☐ | Topic | Question Type | Prof's Angle | Priority |
|---|-------|---------------|-------------|----------|
| ☐ | Disjuncture between crime and punishment | Policy essay | Punishment institutions structure power | High |
| ☐ | “Just mercy” vs retribution | Policy essay | Mercy rooted in hope; second chances | High |

### Prewrite Fragment (if ready to extract now)

**Doctrine:** Justice definition as analytic lens
**Trigger:** Any exam answer that risks becoming “doctrine-only”
**IRAC Starter:**
> **Issue** How should the law evaluate [rule/institution] as part of “criminal justice”?
> **Rule/Frame** Criminal law doctrine must be evaluated against institutional reality; punishment systems can structure social order, not merely respond to “crime.”
> **Application template** Identify (i) the doctrinal requirement, (ii) the institutional implementation, and (iii) the distributional consequences; then test against a stated definition of justice.

## 9. Transcript QC

> Flag any transcript accuracy issues for correction.

**Verification status:** ⚠️ Issues Found

### Errors Detected

| Flag | Section | Issue | Suggested Correction |
|------|---------|-------|---------------------|
| #TRANSCRIPT_VERIFY | Sociologist name | “Louiscon” at Berkeley | Likely Loïc Wacquant (Berkeley sociologist) — verify |
| #TRANSCRIPT_VERIFY | Guest speaker | “Ian” (23 years solitary; LWOP at 13) | Verify full name + details (likely Ian Manuel) |

**Common legal term corrections applied:**
- “Harcourt privilege” / “what we do in Harcourt criminal law…” → leave as-is (course-specific phrasing)

---

## 10. Spaced Reinforcement (10–15 minutes later)

**Self-quiz prompts (closed-book):**

1. State Harcourt’s “disjuncture” claim in one sentence.
2. Write your current one-sentence definition of justice.
3. Name two ways punishment institutions can structure social hierarchy even if doctrine looks neutral.
4. Recite the criminal process roadmap in order (charging → trial → appeal/habeas).
5. Define “just mercy” as used in discussion and identify the hard case (not the innocent).

## METRICS

**Prediction accuracy:** {metrics.prediction_accuracy} (0=missed, 1=partial, 2=accurate)
**Time spent:** {metrics.time_spent_minutes} minutes
**Exam signals found:** {metrics.signal_count}
**Sources extracted:** {metrics.sources_count}
**Prewrite opportunities:** {metrics.prewrite_count}

**What to prep differently next time:**
- Carry “institutional output” (who gets stopped/charged/incarcerated) into every doctrine unit.
- Keep a running justice definition and revise it in writing after each class.
