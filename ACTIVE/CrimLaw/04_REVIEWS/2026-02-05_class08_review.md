# 2026-02-05_class08_review.md

**Class:** 8
**Date:** February 5, 2026
**Topic:** Issues of Causation (+ Sweeping Homicide - Willansky, Williams)
**Status:** Complete

---

## Prep vs. Reality Comparison

### What Was Covered vs. Expected

**EXPECTED (from prep):**
- Deep dive into causation through Acosta and Arzon
- MPC § 2.03 framework
- Two-part causation test (factual + proximate)

**ACTUAL:**
- **Broad sweep of homicide cases** (back row: Willansky, Williams)
- **Causation cases** (front row: Acosta, Arzon)
- **Real-time case application**: Crans Montana bar fire (Switzerland)
- **Integrated approach**: Moved between negligence/recklessness (back row) and causation (front row) showing how they interact

**KEY REALIZATION:** Harcourt used this class to show how mens rea questions (back row) **migrate into** causation questions (front row). The "crystalline structure" repeats - same analysis for intervening causes as for primary causation.

---

## Exam Signals

### #EXAM_SIGNAL Professor's Meta-Teaching Moments

1. **"All legal terms are artificial"** - The paragraph on p. 605 (11th ed.) about proximate cause is "**the most important paragraph you're gonna read in your first year of law school**"
   - Legal terms are policy containers you fill with arguments
   - "Proximate cause" is just a conclusion we dress up with doctrine

2. **Crystalline structure repeats** - When analyzing intervening causes, you do the SAME two-part analysis:
   - But-for causation for the intervening cause
   - Proximate causation for the intervening cause
   - "If there's a crystalline structure here, the same crystalline structure is below it"

3. **Migration between standards** - Notice how causation questions can shift the battlefield away from mens rea
   - "We've kind of moved from the back of the room to the front"
   - Defense can concede negligence but fight on causation

4. **Proximate cause = "you're screwed"** - Direct quote: "You know what proximate cause really means? Means you're screwed. That's it. That's what it is. It's the conclusion."
   - It's the legal system saying "we find liability here"
   - But-for is factual; proximate is policy-driven

### #EXAM_SIGNAL Pattern Recognition

**Standard progression Harcourt expects:**
1. Identify the actus reus (omission vs. commission)
2. Determine duty (if omission)
3. Assess mens rea level (negligence → criminal negligence → recklessness)
4. Test causation (but-for → proximate)
5. Check for intervening causes (apply same two-part test)

**Key transitions to master:**
- When defense concedes negligence → fight moves to causation
- When intervening cause emerges → reapply full causation analysis
- When facts are ambiguous → fight over characterization (degree of risk, foreseeability)

---

## Corrections to Prep

### Major Additions Not in Prep

1. **Willansky case** - Deep coverage
   - Massachusetts has NO criminal negligence (unusual)
   - But then creates objective "wanton/reckless" standard anyway
   - Omission case (innkeeper duty)
   - Quote: "Even if defendant is so stupid or so heedless that in fact he did not realize the grave danger... if an ordinary normal man would have realized the gravity of the danger" - objective standard masquerading as subjective

2. **Williams case** - Significant coverage
   - Washington state allows CIVIL negligence for statutory manslaughter
   - Parents of child with tooth infection → gangrene → death
   - Court "smooshed" categories: civil negligence = criminal negligence = extreme negligence
   - Causation defense: By Sept 5th, nothing could have saved child (doctor testimony)
   - Context: Native American community concerns about child removal

3. **Crans Montana real case** (Swiss nightclub fire, New Year's Eve, 41 deaths)
   - Used for live role-play exercise
   - Prosecution vs. defense arguments on actual recent event
   - Showed how all homicide doctrine comes together

### Prep Accuracy Assessment

**What prep got right:**
- Acosta and Arzon as main cases ✓
- Two-part causation test (but-for + proximate) ✓
- Foreseeability as key battleground ✓
- MPC § 2.03 framework ✓

**What prep missed:**
- Willansky case (major coverage)
- Williams case (major coverage)
- Integration with earlier homicide material (sweep)
- Real-world application exercise (Crans Montana)
- The "migration" concept (mens rea → causation)

**Verdict:** Prep was 60% accurate. Should have anticipated broader homicide sweep.

## Doctrinal Insights

### Causation Framework (Harcourt's Version)

**Two-Part Test:**
1. **Factual Cause (But-For Test)**
   - "Sine qua non" - indispensable condition
   - Remove defendant's conduct; would harm still occur?
   - Usually easy to establish; very broad net
   - **Problem:** Infinite but-for causes exist
     - "But for his mother meeting his father..."
     - "But for the gas attendant fixing his flat tire..."
   - **Solution:** Need second prong

2. **Proximate Cause (Legal Causation)**
   - **NOT a factual question** - it's a policy conclusion
   - Standards used:
     - "Not highly extraordinary" (Acosta)
     - "Not too remote or accidental" (MPC § 2.03)
     - "Foreseeable"
     - "Substantial factor"
   - **Reality:** These are all **post-hoc rationalizations** for liability decision
   - Quote: "Proximate cause... is artificial, serving matters of policy surrounding tort and criminal law"

### Intervening Causes

**Key Point:** Apply the SAME two-part test to the intervening cause

**Test for Intervening Cause:**
1. Is it a but-for cause? (Does the intervening act independently cause the harm?)
2. Is it proximate? (Foreseeable? Too remote?)

**Examples from class:**
- **Willansky:** Barback lighting match = intervening cause?
  - But-for: YES (without match, no fire)
  - Proximate: Fight over foreseeability
  
- **Acosta:** Pilot error = intervening cause?
  - But-for: Arguable
  - Proximate: Court said NO (foreseeable that people act recklessly in pursuit)

- **Arzon:** Second arsonist = intervening cause?
  - But-for: YES (second fire actually killed firefighter)
  - Proximate: NO - defendant created "zone of vulnerability"

### Duty in Omission Cases (Refresher)

**Four sources of duty (Jones case):**
1. **Statute** imposes duty
2. **Status relationship** (parent-child)
3. **Contractual duty** assumed
4. **Voluntary assumption** of care

**Willansky:** Innkeeper/proprietor duty (probably historical common law)

## Specific Cases - Exam-Ready Analysis

### People v. Willansky (Massachusetts, 1944)

**Facts:**
- Coconut Grove nightclub fire (492 deaths)
- Capacity violations (way over capacity)
- 4-5 exits blocked/locked (to prevent non-paying entry)
- Willansky in hospital during fire
- Barback lit match to change lightbulb → ignited palm tree decorations

**Legal Issue:**
- Is omission (failing to maintain safe exits) + absence from premises = "wanton and reckless conduct"?
- Massachusetts: NO criminal negligence statute

**Holding:**
- YES - Wanton and reckless conduct even though objective standard
- Defendant knew of conditions (normal operations, not one-time thing)
- Even if defendant "so stupid or heedless" he didn't realize danger, liable if "ordinary normal man" would have

**Verdict:** 12-15 years involuntary manslaughter

**Exam Moves:**
- **Omission** → Must establish duty first (innkeeper duty)
- **Intervening cause defense:** Barback's match-lighting
  - But-for: YES
  - Proximate: Foreseeable in environment with flammable decorations, locked exits, overcrowding
- **Standard twist:** Calls itself subjective (wanton/reckless) but applies objective test

### People v. Acosta (California, 1991)

**Facts:**
- High-speed chase (48 miles, stolen car)
- 4 police helicopters tracking
- 2 helicopters collided (Costa Mesa pilot violated FAA rules)
- 3 deaths
- Expert: Never heard of helicopter collision during pursuit before

**Holdings:**
1. **Proximate cause:** NOT "highly extraordinary result" - SATISFIED
   - Foreseeable that participants act recklessly during pursuit
   - Defendant's conduct placed helicopters in dangerous situation
   
2. **Implied malice:** NOT established - REVERSED
   - No evidence defendant consciously disregarded risk **to pilots**
   - High risk to ground, minimal risk to air

**Key Teaching:**
- Proximate cause can be satisfied even when implied malice isn't
- Same facts, different legal standards, different outcomes
- Shows artificial nature of legal categories

**Exam Moves:**
- Argue foreseeability broadly (general type of harm) vs. narrowly (specific manner)
- Distinguish between risk to different groups of people
- Intervening cause (pilot error) doesn't break chain if within foreseeable risks

### People v. Arzon (New York, 1978)

**Facts:**
- Defendant set fire on 5th floor (abandoned building)
- Firefighters responded
- **Separate fire** on 2nd floor (NOT defendant's) created deadly smoke
- Firefighter died from smoke inhalation (from 2nd fire, not defendant's)

**Holding:** Motion to dismiss DENIED - Sufficient causation

**Test Applied:**
1. **"Indispensable link":** Defendant's fire placed firefighters in building
2. **"Zone of vulnerability":** Defendant created situation where firefighters were exposed to other dangers
3. **Foreseeable victim:** Firefighters responding to fires are foreseeable victims

**Key Doctrine:** Intervening cause doesn't break chain when defendant created the vulnerable position

**Exam Moves:**
- **Zone of vulnerability** language is powerful
- Argue defendant "set in motion" chain of events
- Distinguish from superseding causes (e.g., *Stewart* - hernia operation unrelated to stabbing)

### State v. Williams (Washington, 1971)

**Facts:**
- Parents, child with tooth infection → gangrene → death
- Parents feared social services (history of Native American child removal)
- Child sick Sept 1 → died Sept 12
- Doctor testimony: By Sept 5, nothing could save child

**Legal Issue:** 
- Can civil negligence = statutory manslaughter?
- What about causation if child unsaveable?

**Holding:**
- Washington: YES - Simple civil negligence sufficient for statutory manslaughter
- Court "smooshed" all categories into criminal liability

**Causation Problem:**
- But-for: Maybe? If treatment sought Sept 1-4?
- Proximate: If nothing could be done by Sept 5, how is death legally caused by omissions?

**Exam Moves:**
- Challenge on **legal causation** even if but-for satisfied
- If harm inevitable regardless of defendant's act, is there proximate cause?
- Omission cases: Must establish duty + causation

---

## Policy Arguments

### Tension: Scope of Criminal Liability

**Broad Liability View (Prosecution):**
- Deterrence: Hold defendants responsible for all reasonably foreseeable harms
- Fairness: Defendant created risk; shouldn't escape liability due to how risk materialized
- Public safety: Err on side of victims

**Narrow Liability View (Defense):**
- Fairness: Criminal punishment requires meaningful connection between act and harm
- Limiting principle: Without limits, causation extends infinitely
- Foreseeability: Only hold defendants liable for risks they actually perceived/should perceive

### Foreseeability Standard Critiques

**Problem:** "Foreseeability" is conclusory
- Everything is foreseeable in hindsight
- Everything is unforeseeable if you frame it specifically enough
- Legal system uses "foreseeability" to rationalize pre-determined outcomes

**Harcourt's View:** This is a feature, not a bug
- Law is artificial
- Your job: Fill these terms with facts favorable to your client
- Master the vocabulary, then manipulate it

### State Role in Willansky/Crans Montana

**Should state liability offset defendant liability?**
- Willansky: No inspections → fire
- Crans Montana: No inspections since 2019, sprinklers not required for venue size

**Argument FOR shared liability:**
- Regulatory failure enabled harm
- Prosecution uses state's standards to prove violation, but state didn't enforce

**Argument AGAINST:**
- Defendant has independent duty of care
- State failure doesn't excuse defendant's omissions

## Outline Inserts

### [INSERT INTO CAUSATION SECTION]

```markdown
## Causation

### Two-Part Test
1. **Factual Cause (But-For)**
   - Sine qua non test: Would harm have occurred without defendant's conduct?
   - Very broad - captures many links in causal chain
   - Insufficient alone

2. **Proximate Cause (Legal Causation)**
   - Policy-driven determination of liability scope
   - Tests/standards (all artificial):
     - "Not highly extraordinary result" (*Acosta*)
     - "Not too remote or accidental" (MPC § 2.03)
     - Foreseeability
     - Substantial factor
   - **Reality:** Post-hoc rationalization of liability decision

### Intervening Causes
- Apply SAME two-part test to intervening cause
- Defendant still liable if:
  - Intervening cause foreseeable
  - Defendant created "zone of vulnerability" (*Arzon*)
  - Result is general type of harm risked

### Key Cases
- **Willansky:** Omission liability for nightclub owner; intervening cause (barback's match) doesn't break chain when defendant created dangerous conditions
- **Acosta:** Proximate cause satisfied for helicopter collision (foreseeable in pursuit), but implied malice not shown
- **Arzon:** "Zone of vulnerability" doctrine - defendant liable even when separate fire actually caused death
- **Williams:** Washington allows civil negligence for manslaughter; causation defense if harm inevitable by certain date
```

### [INSERT INTO MENS REA SECTION - NEGLIGENCE]

```markdown
## Criminal Negligence Variations

### State-by-State Differences
- **Massachusetts (*Willansky*):** NO criminal negligence statute; requires "wanton and reckless" but applies OBJECTIVE standard
- **Washington (*Williams*):** Simple CIVIL negligence sufficient for statutory manslaughter
- **MPC:** Criminal negligence = gross deviation from standard of care (objective test with high threshold)

### Key Quote - Willansky Standard
"Even if a particular defendant is so stupid or so heedless that in fact he did not realize the grave danger, he could escape the imputation of wanton and reckless conduct in his dangerous behavior, if an ordinary normal man under the same circumstances would have realized the gravity of the danger."
- Sounds subjective (wanton/reckless)
- Actually objective (reasonable person standard)
- **High degree of risk required**
```

## Source Extraction

### New Statutes/Rules to Add

**MPC § 2.03 - Causal Relationship (Revisit)**
- Already in sources
- Emphasize (2)(b): "not too remote or accidental"

### New Cases to Add

1. **Commonwealth v. Willansky** (Massachusetts, 1944)
   - Coconut Grove fire
   - Omission + intervening cause
   - Objective standard for "wanton and reckless"

2. **State v. Williams** (Washington, 1971)
   - Civil negligence = criminal liability
   - Causation with inevitable harm
   - Context: Native American child removal fears

3. **People v. Stewart** (mentioned in *Arzon*)
   - Superseding cause example
   - Hernia operation unrelated to stabbing broke causal chain

### New Concepts to Index

- **"Zone of vulnerability" doctrine** (*Arzon*)
- **"Indispensable link" test** (*Arzon*)
- **Crystalline structure applies to intervening causes**
- **Omission liability sources** (*Jones* case - 4 duties)
- **"Smooshing" standards** (Williams - collapsing civil/criminal negligence)

---

## Prewrite Opportunities

### 1. Proximate Cause Essay

**Prompt:** "Proximate cause is an artificial legal construct that serves no meaningful limiting function on criminal liability. Discuss."

**Arguments FOR:**
- Harcourt's teaching: "It's artificial, serving matters of policy"
- Everything foreseeable in hindsight (confirmation bias)
- Courts apply inconsistently (compare *Acosta* outcomes)
- Real limits come from mens rea, not proximate cause

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Provides necessary limit beyond but-for causation
- Reflects community standards of fairness
- Prevents infinite regress of liability
- Foreseeability has meaningful content (compare *Acosta* dissent)

### 2. Intervening Cause Hypo

**Fact Pattern:**
- Defendant robs victim, leaves him drunk in dangerous neighborhood
- Good Samaritan finds victim, puts him in car to drive to hospital
- Good Samaritan crashes car (texting while driving), victim dies

**Analysis:**
- But-for cause: YES (defendant's robbery placed victim in position)
- Proximate cause: 
  - **PRO:** Zone of vulnerability (*Arzon*); foreseeable someone would assist
  - **CON:** Texting = superseding cause (intentional wrongful act)
- Compare to *Kibbe* (victim left on roadside, killed by truck)

### 3. State Regulatory Failure + Criminal Liability

**Issue:** Should defendant's criminal liability be reduced when state failed to enforce safety regulations?

**Crans Montana example:**
- No inspections since 2019
- Sprinklers not required for venue size
- Fire exits may not have met code

**Doctrine:**
- Defendant has independent duty (*Willansky*)
- State failure doesn't break causal chain
- But can argue for mitigation at sentencing

## Transcript QC Flags

**Transcription quality:** Excellent - clear audio, minimal errors

**Notable corrections needed:** None significant

**Context captured:** Yes - including video shown in class

---

## Class Mechanics Notes

### Back Row vs. Front Row Teaching

Harcourt divided class spatially:
- **Back row:** Negligence/recklessness questions (Willansky, Williams)
- **Front row:** Causation questions (Acosta, Arzon)

**Purpose:** Show how legal analysis "migrates" between categories
- Defense concedes negligence → fight moves to causation
- Intervening cause question → same analysis as primary cause
- All doctrine is interconnected (crystalline structure)

### Role-Play Exercise: Crans Montana

**Structure:**
- Prosecution: 4 students (Canton of Valais)
- Defense: 4 students (bar owners)
- Judge: 1 student (mediating)

**Facts used:**
- 41 deaths, New Year's Eve fire
- Capacity violations (200 capacity, 400+ present)
- DIY foam ceiling (flammable)
- No inspections since 2019
- No fire training for staff
- Sparkler tradition (waitress on shoulders near ceiling)
- Fire exits locked inward/blocked

**Prosecution arguments:**
- Overcrowding (advertised to 400+ when capacity 200)
- Flammable decorations (DIY foam)
- Locked fire exits
- No safety training
- Sparkler practice reckless in enclosed space

**Defense arguments:**
- **State responsibility:** No inspections since 2019, sprinklers not required for size
- **Intervening cause:** Waitress's sparkler act not part of bar protocol
- **Common practice:** Sparklers standard in industry
- **9 years safe operation** (if similar to Willansky argument)

### Exam Prep Takeaway

This exercise showed:
1. How to integrate multiple doctrines (duty, negligence, causation)
2. How to characterize facts (degree of risk, foreseeability)
3. How to argue intervening causes
4. How real cases trigger same analysis as hypotheticals

---

## Meta-Learning: Harcourt's Teaching Method

### "Crystalline Structure" Moment

When defense raised intervening cause (barback's match in Willansky), Harcourt:
1. Stopped class
2. Referenced **Jack Balkin's crystalline structure**
3. Made students see: Same analysis repeats at every level
4. Intervening cause = mini-causation analysis (but-for + proximate)

**Exam application:** When you see nested questions (e.g., intervening cause), apply the full framework at each level

### "Most Important Paragraph" Moment

Harcourt: The paragraph on proximate cause (p. 605, 11th ed.) is "**the most important paragraph you're gonna read in your first year of law school**"

**Why:** "All legal terms are artificial... it's up to you to push the court to define those terms in a way that benefits your client"

**Exam application:** Don't treat legal terms as fixed. They're containers you fill with arguments.

### Migration Between Standards

Showed how defense strategy involves **choosing your battlefield**:
- Concede negligence, fight on causation
- Concede but-for causation, fight on proximate cause
- Concede primary cause, fight on intervening cause

**Exam application:** Always have backup arguments at different doctrinal levels

---

## Questions for Office Hours / Further Review

1. **Willansky standard confusion:** How can a standard be called "wanton and reckless" (suggesting subjectivity) but applied objectively? Is this consistent with MPC framework?

2. **Williams causation:** If doctor testifies child unsaveable by Sept 5, and child died Sept 12, how does proximate cause work? Is there a temporal cutoff?

3. **Acosta split:** Why did court find proximate cause satisfied but implied malice not? Aren't they using similar foreseeability analyses?

4. **State liability:** In Crans Montana scenario, can bar owners use state's failure to inspect as affirmative defense, or only mitigation?

5. **MPC § 2.03 split:** Does proximate cause test differ for purpose/knowledge vs. recklessness/negligence? (Prep suggested yes, but class didn't cover)

---

## Exam Strategy Notes

### Issue-Spotting Checklist for Causation

When you see a result crime:
1. **Actus reus:** Commission or omission?
   - If omission: Establish duty first (4 sources)
2. **Mens rea:** Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence?
3. **But-for causation:** Remove defendant's conduct; does harm still occur?
4. **Proximate causation:** 
   - Foreseeability of harm
   - Degree of risk
   - Substantial factor
5. **Intervening causes?** If yes:
   - Apply full two-part test to intervening cause
   - Zone of vulnerability argument
   - Superseding cause arguments

### Red Flags for Deep Analysis

- **Omissions:** Always check duty first
- **Multiple actors:** Look for intervening causes
- **Temporal gaps:** Use for "too remote" arguments  
- **Unusual chains:** "Highly extraordinary result" language
- **State involvement:** Regulatory failure angle

### Writing Tips

**For proximate cause:**
- Start with recognition it's policy-driven
- Use court's language ("not highly extraordinary," "zone of vulnerability")
- Argue both sides of foreseeability
- Distinguish cases (superseding vs. foreseeable intervening causes)

**For intervening causes:**
- State explicitly: "Applying the crystalline structure..."
- Do full two-part analysis for intervening cause
- Use *Arzon* "zone of vulnerability" if defendant created situation

---

## Personal Reflection

### What I Need to Review

1. **MPC § 2.03 differences** for purpose/knowledge vs. recklessness/negligence
2. **More hypo practice** on intervening causes
3. **State-by-state variations** on negligence standards
4. **Past exam causation questions** to see patterns

### Confidence Level

- **Causation framework:** ✓ Solid (but-for + proximate)
- **Intervening causes:** ✓ Good (crystalline structure makes sense)
- **Case applications:** ✓ Strong (Acosta, Arzon, Willansky clear)
- **Integration with mens rea:** ~ Need more practice (migration concept)

### Study Priorities Before Next Class

1. Review MPC § 2.03 in detail (all subsections)
2. Outline integration: Causation + mens rea flowchart
3. Write practice intervening cause hypos
4. Review *Jones* case (omission duties) - referenced but not in prep

---

## Next Class Prep

**Class 9 (Feb 10):** Reminder re. Criminal Justice Process
- Expect procedural overview (probably lighter doctrine)
- May circle back to context for earlier substantive material
- Good opportunity to ask lingering questions on homicide/causation

**Action items:**
- Update outline with causation section
- Create causation flowchart
- Draft intervening cause practice problem
- Review Jones case (omission liability)
