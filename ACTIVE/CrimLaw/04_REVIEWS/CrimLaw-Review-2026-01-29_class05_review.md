## 1. STATUTE/RULE AS HARCOURT FRAMED IT

### A. Premeditation wrap-up: Two cases (Carroll vs. Forrest)

**Carroll case (PA 1963):** Husband kills wife; gun above bed.

**Anderson factors as applied:**
- **Planning activity**: Gun placement above bed (looked like planning)
- **Motive**: History of domestic abuse (1958 fractured skull); violent, protracted argument
- **Manner**: Concealed body after murder (post-crime behavior)

> "The placement of the gun, um. The placement of the gun... planning behavior, right? That sounds like planning behavior possibly." (Transcript 2026-01-29)

> "Maybe this was, there was a long history of abuse, um, and this was the culmination of that, right?" (Transcript 2026-01-29)

**Defense moves (Carroll):**
- Gun wasn't hidden/planned there → "moment of impulsion that he remembered, OK, there's some something handy over there"
- Gun near bed = reasonable for home self-defense
- Post-crime sloppiness → "the fact that it was so sloppy... would seem to indicate an absence of premeditation"

---

**Forrest case (NC):** Mercy killing; son kills terminally ill father.

**Anderson factors:**
- **Planning**: Drove to facility with gun ("If that's not planned. You know, I don't know what is planned.")
- **Motive**: Mercy/relief of suffering
- **Manner**: Drove with gun; preconceived design

> "Like the son saw his father suffer over a period of time and then decided to believe the suffering. He drives a gun, right?" (Transcript 2026-01-29)

**Prof's big point:** This case shows the **problem with premeditation as a categorical rule** → MPC rejects it

> "It's, it's precisely because of a situation like this... That the authors of the Model Penal Code came to the conclusion that It doesn't always mean that you are. The worst of the worst offenders if you are engaged in premeditation." (Transcript 2026-01-29)

> "The cold blooded killer. Who does not even think for a second about killing someone. Is worse in terms of their blameworthiness than someone who has. Who is hesitating, and in the process of hesitating. Is planning." (Transcript 2026-01-29)

**MPC rationale (page 461/437):**

> "Prior reflection may reveal the uncertainties of a tortured conscience rather than exceptional depravity." (Transcript 2026-01-29)

> "The suddenness of the killing may simply reveal callousness so complete and depravity so extreme that no hesitation is required." (Transcript 2026-01-29)

### B. Rules vs. Standards (critical framing for entire manslaughter section)

**The problem:**
- **Rule** (premeditation) = bright line, but creates edge cases that don't fit underlying principle
- **Standard** (reasonableness/evil intent) = flexible, but too much discretion/"mushy"

> "The problem between rule and standard... If there's premeditation, you're in category one. First degree murder You're subject to the death penalty or something like that. It's like for the little forest cases. Wait a minute, are you're going to subject. This young man to the death penalty because he was so distraught..." (Transcript 2026-01-29)

**Prof's point:** Could solve with a standard ("premeditation that we associate with an evil intent"), but then gets too discretionary.

> "If you turn it into a standard, then all of a sudden it feels as if there's too much discretion, too much. Moral discretion in how you define those attributes" (Transcript 2026-01-29)

---

### C. Mitigation to Manslaughter: Overview + MPC Structure

**Basic principle:** Murder → drops to voluntary manslaughter (huge sentencing difference: death → 25 years max; life → lower sentence)

**MPC § 210.3 formulation:**

> "Any homicide, which would otherwise be murder... drops to the manslaughter category if it is committed under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance for which there is a reasonable explanation or excuse." (Transcript 2026-01-29)

**Two elements (MPC/NYPL):**
1. **Subjective**: Extreme emotional disturbance (EED)
2. **Objective** (with subjective flavor): Reasonable explanation/excuse

> "The reasonableness of such explanation or excuse shall be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the actor's situation under the circumstances as he believes them to be." (Transcript 2026-01-29)

**Affirmative defense:** Defense bears burden (not prosecution)

---

## 2. ARGUMENTS HARCOURT PUSHED

### A. Analyzing heat of passion/EED along **two dimensions** (critical framework)

**Dimension 1: Categorical Rule vs. Standard**
- Categorical = bright-line boxes (e.g., "words alone not enough")
- Standard = jury decides case-by-case flexibility

**Dimension 2: Objective vs. Subjective**
- Objective = reasonable person standard
- Subjective = what this defendant believed/experienced

> "One dimension... is whether or not the. Rule. About the, the category is a categorical rule or some kind of standard." (Transcript 2026-01-29)

> "So I think... the case itself, the language of the case, speaks in terms of an objective standard." (Transcript 2026-01-29)

### B. Girouard case (MD 1990): "Words alone not enough"

**Rule:** Categorical + Objective (top-right quadrant)

> "It's a categorical rule, um... because all you have to know is whether, uh, there was anything more than words." (Transcript 2026-01-29)

**Traditional circumstances for heat of passion (page 463/438):**
- Extreme assault or battery
- Mutual combat
- Illegal arrest
- Serious injury/abuse to close relative
- **Sudden discovery of spouse's adultery** (classic case)

**Classic formulation:** Originally only applied when husband killed paramour (not wife)

**Objective language:** "calculated to inflame the passion of a reasonable man" → "reasonable person standard, which obviously is the objective standard"

**Bench trial strategy:**

> "The idea here is on the defense side, you're gonna be thinking, let me get a judge who has seen a lot of these cases. And who's gonna be... able to try and figure out the distinctions... rather than it's like the first case you get and you're you're just appalled" (Transcript 2026-01-29)

---

### C. Mayor case (MI 1862): Jury-decides standard

**Rule:** Standard + Objective (but with subjective tailoring)

**Court's reasoning:**

> "Scarcely two cases can be found which are identical in all their circumstances... Provocations will be given without reference to any previous model. Passions they excite will not consult the precedents" (Transcript 2026-01-29)

**Subjective tailoring (critical exam move):**

> "The excitement, the great perspiration exhibited on entering the saloon, the hasty manner in which he approached and fired the pistol" → "those all seem to be in a way, things about Mr. Mayor... those seem very tailored to his subjective behavior" (Transcript 2026-01-29)

**Prof's alternate framing (pure objective):**

> "No reasonable person is going to Shoot... if all they have is a suspicion. That they're engaged in adultery... even if it would be OK for a reasonable person to shoot the paramour if he saw them engaged in adultery. It's not reasonable for anyone to do that if they are just suspicious." (Transcript 2026-01-29)

---

### D. Casasa case (NY): MPC/NYPL "designedly ambiguous"

**Rule:** Standard + Subjective (with objective check)

**Two-prong test:**
1. **Subjective**: Did defendant experience EED?
2. **Objective-ish**: Was there reasonable explanation/excuse "from the viewpoint of a person in the actor's situation under the circumstances as he believes them to be"

**Prof's description of prong 2:**

> "This is, this is, this is the most subjective, objective standard you could ever have. In the world, in fact, it's not an objective standard, it's a subjective standard, right? It's not what the reasonable person believes, it's what. This person. Believed." (Transcript 2026-01-29)

**Defense argument:** "Under the circumstances as he believes them to be" → his psychotic beliefs, breaking into apartment, listening upstairs

**MPC Commentary (page 502/485/459):**

> "The word situation is designedly ambiguous... there will be room for interpretation of the word situation, and that is precisely the flexibility desired." (Transcript 2026-01-29)

Prof's reaction:

> "Totally outrageous. Totally outrageous. What the drafters essentially did was to use terms that are quote unquote designedly ambiguous. What do you think about that for drafting laws?" (Transcript 2026-01-29)

**MPC says:**
- Include: blindness, shock, extreme grief, personal handicaps
- Exclude: idiosyncratic moral values

> "In the end, the question is whether the actor's loss of self-control can be understood in terms that arouse sympathy in the ordinary citizen." (Transcript 2026-01-29)

---

### E. Prof's theory: It's really about **fact-filtering**

**What he thinks courts are doing:**

> "I think this is what they're trying to do. They're trying to weed out certain things that can be considered and that can't be considered" (Transcript 2026-01-29)

**Examples of fact-filtering:**
- Political extremist beliefs (Jan. 6 protester example)
- Homosexual advance defense (varies by state)
- Cultural values

**Prof's point:** Objective/subjective spectrum = determining which facts jury can consider

> "If it's a subjective standard... you know... a January 6th, um, um, a protester, uh, would have a defense maybe under extreme emotional disturbance if it's purely subjective, right? And you can't say, well, look, you got your political opinion... and we're not gonna let a jury consider that" (Transcript 2026-01-29)

## 3. EXAM SIGNALS #EXAM_SIGNAL

**1. Rules vs. Standards recurs everywhere** #EXAM_SIGNAL

> "The problem between rules and standards... recurred during your first semester. It's going to recur, it's, it's going to recur at all times." (Transcript 2026-01-29)

**2. Two-dimensional analysis for any heat of passion/EED problem** #EXAM_SIGNAL

Always analyze along BOTH dimensions:
- Categorical vs. Standard
- Objective vs. Subjective

**3. "Figure out what your statute requires and then be able to push things in one direction or the other"** #EXAM_SIGNAL

> "Your task is as a student, but also as a lawyer. Is to kind of understand the lay of the land... Figure out what your statute in whatever state you're practicing. Requires... and then be able to push things in one direction or the other" (Transcript 2026-01-29)

**4. Never think "that's the law"** #EXAM_SIGNAL

> "You shouldn't When you're reading these cases, you shouldn't be thinking, oh, that's the law. Right? Law doesn't exist. OK, there is no that's the law. There is no black letter law... What you've got to learn as lawyers is, is how to move things. In a direction that is beneficial to your client." (Transcript 2026-01-29)

**5. Anderson factors apply to premeditation fact patterns** #EXAM_SIGNAL

Planning, motive, manner → exam will have facts to argue both ways

**6. Post-crime behavior as "manner"** #EXAM_SIGNAL

Cleanup/concealment = manner (prosecution), but sloppiness = no premeditation (defense)

**7. "Under the circumstances as he believes them to be" is the subjective hook** #EXAM_SIGNAL

This language = defense argument to bring in defendant's perspective

**8. Bench trials in all three manslaughter cases (paradox)** #EXAM_SIGNAL

> "All three of these are bench trials. Which is paradoxical in part because all three of these are cases where the court says we should be letting the jury decide." (Transcript 2026-01-29)

---

## 4. MAGIC WORDS / PHRASES

**On premeditation problems:**
- "Planning activity, motive, and manner" (Anderson factors)
- "Time-framing" (expand or contract the moment)
- "Prior reflection may reveal uncertainties of a tortured conscience rather than exceptional depravity"
- "Suddenness may reveal callousness so complete that no hesitation is required"

**On mitigation to manslaughter:**
- "Extreme emotional disturbance for which there is a reasonable explanation or excuse"
- "From the viewpoint of a person in the actor's situation under the circumstances as he believes them to be"
- "Move things in one direction or the other" (lawyer's task)
- "Categorical rule vs. standard" (framework for analysis)
- "Objective vs. subjective" (second dimension)
- "Designedly ambiguous" (MPC drafting strategy)
- "Whether the actor's loss of self-control can be understood in terms that arouse sympathy"

**When analyzing any heat of passion case:**
- Map it on two dimensions: (1) categorical/standard, (2) objective/subjective
- For defense: push toward standard + subjective
- For prosecution: push toward categorical + objective

## 5. PREWRITE FRAGMENTS

### Fragment 1: Two-Dimensional Framework for Heat of Passion/EED

**Issue-spotter:** Any fact pattern with killing after provocation/emotional disturbance

**Analysis structure:**

When analyzing heat of passion or extreme emotional disturbance defenses, map the jurisdiction's standard along two critical dimensions:

**Dimension 1: Categorical Rule vs. Standard**
- Categorical approach: Bright-line categories of adequate provocation (e.g., Maryland in *Girouard*: "words alone not enough"; traditional categories = assault/battery, mutual combat, illegal arrest, injury to relative, discovery of adultery)
- Standard approach: Case-by-case jury determination; no rigid categories (e.g., Michigan in *Mayor*: "scarcely two cases identical in all circumstances")

**Dimension 2: Objective vs. Subjective**
- Objective: Reasonable person standard ("calculated to inflame reasonable man")
- Subjective: Defendant's actual beliefs/experience
- Hybrid (MPC/NYPL): "Under circumstances as [defendant] believes them to be" → subjective facts plugged into reasonableness inquiry

**Exam move:** Argue jurisdiction's standard in both directions
- Defense: Push toward standard + subjective (maximum flexibility; include defendant's perspective)
- Prosecution: Push toward categorical + objective (exclude defendant's idiosyncrasies; bright-line rules)

**Connection to fact-filtering:** Courts use objective/subjective spectrum to determine which facts jury may consider (exclude: political extremism, bigoted values; include: shock, grief, personal handicaps)

---

### Fragment 2: Rules vs. Standards Trade-off (Meta-Issue)

**Context:** Premeditation (Forrest mercy-killing) exposes tension

**The problem:**
- **Rule** (e.g., "premeditation = first-degree") creates predictability but catches edge cases that violate underlying principle
  - Example: Mercy-killing defendant clearly premeditated, but "tortured conscience" not "exceptional depravity"
- **Standard** (e.g., "premeditation reflecting evil intent") captures principle but creates excessive discretion

**MPC response:** Abandon premeditation requirement entirely because:
- "Prior reflection may reveal uncertainties of tortured conscience rather than exceptional depravity"
- "Suddenness may reveal callousness so complete that no hesitation required"

**Prof's point:** This trade-off "recurs at all times" in criminal law

**Exam application:** When statute uses categorical rule, argue edge case doesn't fit underlying policy; when statute uses standard, argue either (1) flexibility allows sympathetic interpretation (defense) or (2) discretion shouldn't extend to defendant's conduct (prosecution)

---

### Fragment 3: MPC Extreme Emotional Disturbance (Elements + Arguments)

**Two-element test (NYPL § 125.25(1)(a); MPC § 210.3):**

1. **Subjective element**: Defendant acted under influence of extreme emotional disturbance
   - Purely subjective: Did *this defendant* experience EED?
   - No reasonable person inquiry at this stage
   
2. **Objective element (with subjective flavor)**: Reasonable explanation or excuse for EED
   - "Reasonableness... determined from viewpoint of person in actor's situation under circumstances as he believes them to be"
   - Prof: "Most subjective objective standard you could ever have"
   - Not "what reasonable person believes" but "what this person believed" assessed for reasonableness

**Defense arguments:**
- Element 1: Psychiatric testimony about defendant's mental state
- Element 2: "Under circumstances as he believes them to be" → bring in defendant's perspective, psychotic beliefs, background (*Casasa*: breaking into apartment, listening upstairs)

**Prosecution arguments:**
- Element 1: Competing psychiatric testimony
- Element 2: Even from defendant's perspective, response was unreasonable; exclude "idiosyncratic moral values" and bigoted beliefs

**Broader than heat of passion:**
- No "cooling off" requirement
- Can be "mental trauma... simmering in unknowing conscious and then inexplicably coming to fore"
- Not limited to spontaneous action

**MPC Comment caution:** "Designedly ambiguous" language creates interpretive flexibility for "ultimate judgment of ordinary citizen... assigned to resolve specific case"

---

## 6. CONNECTIONS & FOLLOW-UP

**To prior classes:**
- Class #4: Premeditation/degree structure → continued with Carroll/Forrest
- Actus reus (Class #1-2): "Reflex" defense = voluntariness language
- Intent/purpose (Class #4): Intent = purpose under MPC

**To upcoming material:**
- Insanity defense (prof mentioned briefly at end): mental disorder → not guilty (different from EED, which is mitigation only)
- Felony murder (next topic): Different path to murder without intent
- Self-defense: Prof mentioned MPC self-defense has "non-negligently and non-recklessly formed" belief standard (even more subjective than EED)

**Open questions:**
- How exactly does fact-filtering work in practice?
- What facts are in/out under MPC "situation" language?
- Homosexual advance defense status across jurisdictions

## 7. CASE CHART

| Case | Jurisdiction | Rule/Standard | Objective/Subjective | Holding |
|------|--------------|---------------|---------------------|---------|
| **Carroll** (PA 1963) | Pennsylvania | N/A (applying premeditation) | N/A | Premeditation found (gun placement, abuse history, concealment) |
| **Forrest** (NC) | North Carolina | N/A (applying premeditation) | N/A | Premeditation found (mercy-killing; planning clear); shows problem with categorical rule |
| **Girouard** (MD 1990) | Maryland | Categorical (traditional categories only) | Objective (reasonable person) | Words alone insufficient; no assault/threat from smaller wife |
| **Mayor** (MI 1862) | Michigan | Standard (jury decides case-by-case) | Objective (but subjectively tailored: perspiration, haste) | Remand to jury; "passions don't consult precedents" |
| **Casasa** (NY) | New York (MPC) | Standard (EED broader than heat of passion) | Subjective + objective hybrid ("circumstances as he believes them to be") | Deny EED; defendant's beliefs too idiosyncratic despite "designedly ambiguous" language |
