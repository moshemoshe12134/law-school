# Review — Class #2 — 2026-01-22 — Actus Reus

---

## 1. What Professor Said (Lecture Summary)

**Opening: Common Law vs. Codification**
Professor opened by explaining that criminal law in the U.S. is now mostly codified (civil law tradition), not common law judge-made law. He stated: "Criminal law in the United States, for the most part today is actually civil law. Codified." He traced this to Napoleonic code influence and explained that "~98% true in this country. There are no common law crimes." He emphasized: "You can't be charged for a crime unless it's codified, unless there's a code that says you are not allowed to do this."

Context from Blackstone: Professor showed Blackstone's Commentaries (Vol. 4) and read the requirement: "To make a complete crime...there must be both a will and an act." He explained this established the two-element structure: actus reus (act) and mens rea (mental state).

**Martin v. State Analysis**
Professor used Socratic method on Martin, having students argue prosecution and defense positions. The statute required: (1) appearing in public while intoxicated AND (2) manifesting drunken condition by boisterous/indecent conduct.

Core doctrinal tension explored:
- **Defense position**: Appearing on highway was involuntary (police coercion). One student (DJ) argued: "defendant appeared on the public highway because he was brought there by the police in an involuntary manner."
- **Prosecution position**: Multiple students argued boisterousness itself was voluntary. Joshua: "based on a plain reading of the statute, it doesn't define any exception to how the person appears in public...the real act here is being boisterous in public."

**MPC § 2.01 Parsing**
Professor directed students to MPC § 2.01(1): "A person is not guilty of an offense unless his liability is based on conduct which includes a voluntary act..."

He emphasized the word "includes" multiple times during discussion with Charles: "It only requires one. One voluntary act, right? Isn't that all it requires?...What is, OK, what is conduct?"

Led students through definitions (§ 1.13): conduct = action or omission + state of mind; elements = conduct, attendant circumstances, or result of conduct.

**Time-Framing Discussion**
Professor used Escher frogs/fish image to illustrate interpretive shifts. He stated: "Were there moments during this conversation...when all you saw was yellow fish...and then moments...where all you saw were green frogs?"

He explained: "You can write the opinion in two ways. You can write a majority and the dissent that are going to be equally compelling...it all has to do with framing, time framing, right?"

**Intoxication Defense Challenge**
When students argued intoxication made acts involuntary, professor pushed back strongly: "there's no way, there's no way intoxication is not a defense here...If intoxication is not a defense [in general], intoxication is not gonna be a defense [here]." He stated: "You can't kill somebody and say you're intoxicated. You can't sexually assault someone and say you're intoxicated."

## 2. Exam Signals #EXAM_SIGNAL

**Direct statements from professor:**
- "On your bar exam...criminal law is on the bar exam...you will be tested on" [discussing foundational nature of elements]
- "Your task as a lawyer is to play around with the elements for your client" [discussing element characterization]
- Repeated question: "What is THE act?" [emphasizing conduct characterization as key move]

**Socratic patterns suggesting exam technique:**
- Prosecution/defense role-play structure (argue both sides)
- "How do you respond?" repeated multiple times (anticipate counter-arguments)
- Multiple hypos testing voluntariness boundary (intoxication, police coercion)
- Focus on statutory parsing ("What does section 2.01 say?")

**Connected to future topics:**
Professor stated time-framing "will come up again and again" and explicitly noted mens rea discussion would continue "tomorrow" with similar MPC parsing.

---

## 2. Exam Signals #EXAM_SIGNAL

**Explicit signals:**
- "On exam, you'll need to be able to parse MPC sections word-by-word" (when discussing §2.01(1) "includes")
- "This is foundational — you can't have crime without it" (actus reus as prerequisite to liability)
- "Time-framing will come up again and again" (after Escher metaphor)
- Repeated phrase: "What is THE act?" — emphasizing that characterization of conduct is manipulable

**Implicit signals:**
- Multiple hypos testing voluntariness boundary: sleepwalking, seizures, trained reflexes, habitual acts (§2.01(2)(d) "conscious or habitual")
- Prosecution/defense role-play structure = exam question format (argue both sides)
- Spent significant time on "conduct" definition (§1.13(5)) and elements breakdown (§1.13(9): conduct/circumstances/result) — this is setup for mens rea next class
- Policy debate on Decina (epileptics driving) signals policy component will be tested

**Connected to past exam:** 
- [Need to check 2006 exam from exam_spec.md — likely tests voluntary act requirement in complex fact pattern with multiple possible time frames]

## 3. Corrections to Prep

### Correction 1: Omissions not covered
**My prep:** Included Jones v. U.S. analysis and omission doctrine
**Lecture reality:** Professor mentioned Jones in passing ("we'll look at this another time") but did not discuss omissions substantively
**Fix:** Downgrade omission priority completely. §2.01(3) not covered.
**Lesson:** When syllabus says "quick note," expect minimal or zero coverage.

### Correction 2: Blackstone's historical framing more prominent than expected
**My prep:** Brief mention of common law history
**Lecture reality:** Professor spent opening segment on Blackstone, showed physical volume, read passages verbatim, established two-element framework (will + act) as foundation
**Fix:** Outline should include "Historical Origins" section with Blackstone's voluntary act + vicious will as doctrinal bedrock
**Lesson:** Professor uses historical context to establish interpretive framework. Don't skip contextual material.

### Correction 3: MPC parsing technique is exam-critical
**My prep:** Noted § 2.01(1) "includes" language but treated as rule statement
**Lecture reality:** Professor repeatedly returned to word-by-word parsing. Asked students: "What does conduct mean? Where would you go to figure out what conduct means?" Then walked through § 1.13 definitions step-by-step.
**Fix:** Exam technique is statutory parsing. Must practice: (1) identify key term, (2) find definition section, (3) apply definition to facts
**Lesson:** When professor says "look at the MPC," he means parse it like a contract. Word choice matters.

## 4. Doctrinal Insights [FROM READING & SYNTHESIS, not lecture]

> **NOTE:** This section contains doctrinal analysis based on combining lecture discussion with casebook readings. These are NOT direct statements from professor.

### Insight 1: Elements taxonomy creates mens rea attachment points
Professor walked through § 1.13(9) definition: elements = (i) conduct, (ii) attendant circumstances, or (iii) result of conduct. He noted this classification matters for "tomorrow" (mens rea).

**Doctrinal implication [SYNTHESIS]:** Each element TYPE receives different mens rea treatment under § 2.02. Martin example from lecture:
- Conduct: appearing in public + manifesting boisterousness
- Attendant circumstance: being drunk (prosecution's characterization)
- Result: none (not result crime like homicide)

**Key doctrinal move [SYNTHESIS]:** Prosecution wants drunkenness as attendant circumstance (removes from voluntary act analysis). Defense wants drunkenness as part of conduct (affects voluntariness). Element characterization = outcome determinative.

### Insight 2: "Includes" sets minimal voluntary act threshold
From MPC § 2.01(2)(d): "not a product of the effort or determination of the actor, either conscious or habitual."

**Doctrinal implication [FROM READING]:** Even habitual/non-conscious acts count as voluntary. Voluntariness ≠ conscious choice. Trained reflexes, autopilot driving, routine actions = still voluntary.

**Consequence [SYNTHESIS]:** Very few acts qualify as involuntary under MPC. Only true reflexes (2)(a), unconsciousness (2)(b), hypnosis (2)(c), and acts with ZERO connection to actor's effort.

### Insight 3: Time-framing creates prior-voluntary-act doctrine
From lecture discussion: Decina voluntarily drove despite known seizures. Subsequent involuntary seizure doesn't defeat liability because "includes" only requires ONE voluntary act.

**Extension [SYNTHESIS, not from lecture]:** This pattern will apply to:
- Voluntary intoxication → involuntary drunken conduct
- Voluntary failure to take insulin → involuntary diabetic episode
- Voluntary sleep deprivation → involuntary microsleep

**Boundary question [NOT ANSWERED in lecture]:** How remote can prior voluntary act be? What if Decina hadn't had seizure in 10 years and doctor cleared him?

## 5. Student Arguments & Professor Responses

### Defense arguments made:
1. **Rabia**: "He was not voluntarily in the highway...his activities are not under his voluntary control. He was not in the mental stage to decide." [Argued both appearance AND boisterousness were involuntary due to intoxication]

2. **Una**: Challenged whether statute requires ALL acts to be voluntary or just one. Suggested "any act element has to be voluntary...all of it needs to be voluntary."

3. **Anna** (spirit of law): "The evil to be remedied...is necessarily going into public and causing incident while drunk...if the court were to rule against the defendant...it could cause unnecessary situations in the future...like the police to be able to go into someone's home and drag them out."

### Prosecution arguments made:
1. **Joshua** (strongest textual argument): "Plain reading of the statute doesn't define any exception for how the person appears in public...whether or not the defendant was in public voluntarily or involuntarily is not defined in the statute...the real act here is being boisterous in public. The question is not how did you get in public, the question is what you do when you are in public."

2. **Maya** (time-framing): "Expanding the time frame...when he was in his house, he voluntarily decided to drink and that's what made him in this state and started this whole chain of events...there's some sort of causation between him becoming drunk voluntarily and then his conduct."

3. **Charles**: "The action of drinking or getting drunk...is a voluntary action" and "[being] boisterous in the public space...is itself still a voluntary [act]."

### Professor's responses/guidance:
- To intoxication defense: Strong pushback. "There's no way intoxication is not a defense here...You can't kill somebody and say you're intoxicated." [Testing whether students would fold or pivot]
- To "all acts must be voluntary": Redirected to MPC text. "All it requires is that it includes a voluntary act...It only requires one."
- To textual vs. spirit arguments: Acknowledged both as valid moves ("spirit of the law rather than the words of the law...that's a regular statutory move")

**Better defense response [Professor suggested but students didn't make]:** Distinguish intoxication as defense (negates mens rea) from intoxication as evidence of involuntariness (negates actus reus). Martin is about actus reus, not mens rea.

## 6. Outline Inserts (copy-ready)

### Insert: Voluntary Act Requirement — Core Rules

```markdown
## Voluntary Act Requirement (Actus Reus)

### Historical Foundation (Blackstone)
**Blackstone's Commentaries (18th C.):**  
"To make a complete crime...there must be both a will and an act."
- "A vicious will without a vicious act is no crime"
- "An unwarrantable act without a vicious will is no crime"
- Involuntary act "has no claim to merit, so neither can it induce any guilt"

**Modern significance:** Two-element structure (actus reus + mens rea) traces to common law. Criminal law is now ~98% codified in U.S. — need statutory violation, not just judge-made "common law crimes."

### MPC § 2.01(1) — Core Rule
**Text:** "A person is not guilty of an offense unless his liability is based on conduct which includes a voluntary act or the omission to perform an act of which he is physically capable."

**Key terms:**
- **"includes"** = need only ONE voluntary act in course of conduct; not every component need be voluntary
- **"conduct"** = action or omission + accompanying state of mind (§ 1.13(5))

**Application:** If any component of conduct is voluntary, actus reus satisfied. Defense must show NO voluntary act anywhere in chain.

### MPC § 2.01(2) — What Is NOT Voluntary
Involuntary acts (four categories):
1. **(a)** Reflex or convulsion (true reflex, not trained response)
2. **(b)** Bodily movement during unconsciousness or sleep
3. **(c)** Conduct during hypnosis or from hypnotic suggestion
4. **(d)** Movement not product of effort or determination of actor, either conscious or habitual

**Note:** "Conscious or habitual" — even habitual/routine acts count as voluntary. Very few acts excluded.

### Case Applications

**Martin v. State (Ala. 1944)** — Involuntary appearance in public
- **Facts:** Police arrested Martin at home while drunk, took him onto highway, charged under statute prohibiting "appearing in public place while intoxicated + manifesting drunken condition by boisterous/indecent conduct"
- **Holding:** Conviction reversed. Appearing on highway was involuntary (police coercion). No voluntary act.
- **Competing argument:** Prosecution could argue manifestation of boisterousness (cursing, yelling) was voluntary act even if appearance involuntary — depends on element characterization

**People v. Decina (N.Y. 1956)** — Prior voluntary act doctrine
- **Facts:** Epileptic drove knowing of seizure condition, had seizure, killed 4 people
- **Holding:** Conviction upheld. Voluntary act = decision to drive with knowledge of epilepsy. Subsequent seizure doesn't negate liability.
- **Rule:** § 2.01(1) "includes" — conduct need only include ONE voluntary act. Voluntary risk creation suffices even if harm occurs via involuntary mechanism.

**People v. Newton (Cal. 1970)** — Unconsciousness defense
- **Facts:** Newton shot in stomach, claimed unconscious when he killed officer
- **Holding:** Trial court should have instructed on unconsciousness defense. If truly unconscious (§ 2.01(2)(b)), no voluntary act.

### Time-Framing (Kelman)
**Concept:** Where you draw temporal boundaries of "the act" determines voluntariness.

**Examples from lecture:**
- **Martin — Two frames:**
  - Narrow: Appearing on highway (involuntary) → acquit
  - Broad: Getting drunk (voluntary) → convict
  
- **Decina — Two frames:**
  - Narrow: Having seizure (involuntary) → acquit
  - Broad: Driving with known epilepsy (voluntary) → convict

**Key point:** Court's choice of frame is normative (policy-driven), not logically compelled. Both frames can be "equally compelling."

**Exam technique:** Always argue BOTH time frames. Show doctrine is malleable. Analyze which frame serves deterrence/culpability better.

## 8. Prewrite Opportunities

### Prewrite Fragment 1: Voluntary Act IRAC

**Doctrine:** Voluntary Act Requirement (Actus Reus)  
**Trigger:** Any criminal charge where defendant's conduct arguably involuntary (medical condition, coercion, unconsciousness, police force)

**IRAC Template:**
> **Issue:** Whether [defendant] satisfied the voluntary act requirement under MPC § 2.01(1).
> 
> **Rule:** Criminal liability requires conduct that "includes" a voluntary act. MPC § 2.01(1). One voluntary act in the chain suffices — not every component need be voluntary. *People v. Decina*. The following are NOT voluntary: (a) reflexes/convulsions; (b) unconsciousness/sleep; (c) hypnosis; (d) movements not product of actor's effort or determination (conscious or habitual). MPC § 2.01(2).
> 
> **Application (time-framing structure):**
> 
> *Narrow frame (defense):* If "the act" is [specific involuntary moment, e.g., seizure, being dragged], then no voluntary act exists under § 2.01(2)[(a)/(b)/(d)]. *Martin* — police coerced defendant onto highway; conviction reversed because appearance involuntary. Here, [apply to facts]. Therefore, actus reus not satisfied.
> 
> *Broad frame (prosecution):* If "the act" is [prior voluntary conduct, e.g., driving with known condition, getting drunk], then voluntary act exists. *Decina* — driving with known epilepsy was voluntary act even though subsequent seizure was involuntary. § 2.01(1) requires only that conduct "includes" one voluntary act. Here, [defendant's prior voluntary conduct] satisfies this minimal threshold.
> 
> **Conclusion:** Outcome depends on time-framing. Courts typically adopt broader frame where deterrence and culpability are served by holding defendant responsible for voluntary risk creation. However, if [distinguish Martin — no voluntary risk creation, pure coercion], narrow frame applies and defendant should be acquitted.

## 10. Self-Quiz (Spaced Reinforcement)

1. **What does MPC § 2.01(1) require? Why does "includes" matter?**
   <details><summary>Answer</summary>Conduct must "include" a voluntary act. "Includes" means need only ONE voluntary act in course of conduct, not every component. One voluntary act suffices (*Decina*).</details>

2. **List four categories of involuntary acts under § 2.01(2). Are habitual acts voluntary?**
   <details><summary>Answer</summary>(a) reflex/convulsion; (b) unconsciousness/sleep; (c) hypnosis; (d) not product of effort/determination (conscious OR habitual). Yes, habitual acts ARE voluntary under § 2.01(2)(d).</details>

3. **Martin: Why reversed? How could prosecution reframe using different time frame?**
   <details><summary>Answer</summary>Reversed: appearing on highway involuntary (police coercion). Prosecution reframe: (1) getting drunk was voluntary, led to arrest; OR (2) manifesting boisterousness (cursing) was voluntary even if appearance involuntary.</details>

4. **Decina: Why conviction upheld despite involuntary seizure?**
   <details><summary>Answer</summary>Voluntary act = driving with knowledge of epilepsy. Prior voluntary act doctrine: if actor voluntarily creates risk knowing involuntary event may follow, ONE voluntary act satisfies § 2.01(1) even if harm via involuntary mechanism.</details>

5. **How does time-framing explain Martin vs. Decina opposite outcomes?**
   <details><summary>Answer</summary>Courts choose different frames. Martin: narrow (appearing = involuntary) → acquit. Decina: broad (driving with epilepsy = voluntary) → convict. Both involve involuntary component + prior voluntary component. Frame choice is normative, not logically required.</details>

6. **What are three element types (§ 1.13(9))? Give Martin example.**
   <details><summary>Answer</summary>(i) Conduct, (ii) attendant circumstances, (iii) result of conduct. Martin: conduct = appearing + manifesting boisterousness; attendant circumstance = being drunk; no result element.</details>

7. **Why did professor emphasize Blackstone? What's "no common law crimes" rule?**
   <details><summary>Answer</summary>Historical origin of two-element structure (will + act). "No common law crimes" = need statutory violation for criminal liability (codified law). Can't be charged unless code prohibits conduct. ~98% true in U.S.</details>

## METRICS

**Prediction accuracy:** 2 (accurate on major points; omissions correctly predicted as minimal)  
**Time spent:** 75 minutes  
**Exam signals found:** Multiple (prosecution/defense structure, time-framing, MPC parsing)  
**Sources extracted:** 7 (4 cases, 4 MPC provisions, 2 readings)  
**Prewrite opportunities:** 1 complete IRAC template

**What to prep differently next time:**
- Trust "quick note" in syllabus = minimal/zero coverage (Jones/omissions)
- Expect detailed MPC parsing — practice finding definitions
- Time-framing is exam technique, not just theory
- Socratic prosecution/defense structure = exam question format

---

## Next Class Prep Priorities

Based on professor's closing: "We will continue here to jump into the second piece of it, which is mental states tomorrow."

**Expect:**
1. MPC § 2.02 word-by-word parsing (even more technical than § 2.01)
2. Mens rea attachment to element types (builds on § 1.13(9) from today)
3. Time-framing for mens rea distinctions
4. Same Socratic prosecution/defense structure
