# Review — Class #3 — 2026-01-23 — Mens Rea

**Purpose:** Extract exam-ready material (NOT summarize class)  
**Target time:** 25-40 minutes  
**Critical output:** PREWRITE FRAGMENTS (Section 5)

---

## 1. STATUTE/RULE AS HARCOURT FRAMED IT

### A. MPC §2.02 — The Core Framework

**Harcourt's approach:** Element-by-element mapping. Every statute analysis requires:
1. Identify the three types of actus reus elements: conduct / attendant circumstances / result of conduct
2. Attach mens rea to each material element
3. Apply default rules (§2.02(3) and §2.02(4)) when statute is silent or ambiguous

**Harcourt's explicit language on the four mental states:**

From transcript: Harcourt defined the hierarchy clearly during class:
- **Purpose**: "conscious object" — you want it to happen
- **Knowledge**: "practical certainty" — you know it will happen (for conduct/circumstances: "aware"; for results: "practically certain")
- **Recklessness**: "conscious disregard" — you're aware of substantial and unjustifiable risk and do it anyway
- **Negligence**: "should be aware" — you didn't know, but a reasonable person would have (objective standard)

**Key textual move Harcourt emphasized:** The hierarchy matters. "If the law requires negligence, then it's established if it was purposeful, knowing, or reckless." (MPC §2.02(5)). The lower culpability threshold is sufficient.

### B. Omissions (Jones case) — Quick Coverage

**Harcourt's formulation of omission liability:**
"In order to have criminal liability for an omission, there has to be essentially a duty imposed on the individual to do something, and then the omission is a breach of that duty."

**Categories of duty (common law):**
1. Statute
2. Status (parent-child, spousal)
3. Contract
4. Assumption and seclusion (voluntary undertaking + preventing others from helping)

**MPC §2.01(3):** "Liability for the commission of an offense may not be based on an omission unaccompanied by action unless the omission is expressly made sufficient by the law defining the offense or a duty to perform the omitted act is otherwise imposed by law."

---

## 2. ARGUMENTS HARCOURT PUSHED

### A. The Element-Mapping Exercise (NY Manslaughter in the 1st Degree)

**Harcourt's method:** Take a complex statute and parse it into elements, then fight over how many things the prosecution must prove.

**Statute (NY Penal Law §125.20):**
"A person is guilty of manslaughter in the 1st degree when, being 18 years old or more, and with intent to cause physical injury to a person less than 11 years old, the defendant recklessly engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of serious physical injury to such person and thereby causes the death of such person."

**What Harcourt extracted (with Charlotte):**
- Attendant circumstance: being 18 or more
- Attendant circumstance: victim being less than 11 (10 or younger)
- Mens rea: intent (top tier)
- Actus reus attached to intent: causing physical injury (mixed conduct + result element)
- Mens rea: recklessness
- Actus reus attached to recklessness: engaging in conduct which creates grave risk
- Result of conduct: causes death of person

**Harcourt's strategic framing:**
"As a prosecutor, you're gonna want to have less things to have to prove. You're gonna want to bring that number of elements down... As a defense counsel, you might want to bring that number of things up. You might also be trying to make it more kind of intentional rather than say, knowledge or recklessness."

**Key move:** Jury instructions = the battleground. "This turns into a jury instruction... You will have to find 5 things. Or 10 or 7. And that's in a way what you're going to be fighting about."

### B. The "Malicious" Fight (Cunningham)

**Prosecution argument (Judge Oliver's jury instruction):**
"Malicious" means "wicked" — "he has no business to do and he knows... it's wicked."

**Translation to MPC terms:** Knowledge (per student Anu): "he needs to like know that he's doing it."

**Defense argument (Judge Byrne's opinion, overturning conviction):**
"Malicious" doesn't mean general wickedness. It means specific foreseeability: "even if the appellant did not intend the injury to Mrs. Wade, he foresaw that the removal of the gas meter might cause injury to someone."

**Translation to MPC terms:** Foreseeability = Recklessness. Harcourt: "This notion of the way that it's styled by this British judge is foreseeability. But the foreseeability there really does smack of recklessness."

**Why recklessness not negligence?**
Harcourt (with Noella): "Mr. Cunningham, we don't know what Mr. Cunningham's mental state was... Having to prove that it was foreseeable to him might be difficult for the prosecution. It would be a lot less difficult for the prosecution to prove that it was simply negligent... For negligence purposes, [we] don't have to care about what he was thinking, doing, intending, knowing or aware of, we can just say a reasonable person would have been aware."

**Core distinction:** Recklessness = subjective (what defendant actually foresaw); Negligence = objective (what reasonable person would have known).

### C. The Strict Liability Fight (Faulkner)

**Prosecution argument (lower court):**
Mens rea for arson = none. Just need: (1) engaged in theft of rum (bad act), (2) fire resulted. "It's almost as if there is no mental state. It's automatic, strict liability as long as you were engaged in that trying to steal the rum."

**Harcourt's characterization:** "It's a form of strict liability. It's like... felony murder. It's basically any murder that happens during the course of a felony. Is a certain degree of murder because it happened during the course of a felony."

**Defense argument (Barry):**
Not strict liability. "The act must be done in fact intentional and willful... the accused just needs to know that the injury would be probable and then act anyway."

**Translation:** Knowledge + Recklessness. "Barry does this kind of weird thing... where he starts with kind of it has to be intentional and willful. But then when he defines intentional and willful, it becomes something like knowledge plus recklessness."

**Defense argument (Fitzgerald dissent):**
"It should have to be a probable consequence... reasonably foreseeable."

**Translation:** Modified recklessness or possibly negligence. "Reasonably foreseeable could possibly be something like negligence, rather than... he had to foresee it himself."

### D. The MPC Default Rules Fight

**Scenario:** "A person commits arson if he causes a fire to result." (No mens rea stated)

**Prosecution argument (Jesse):**
Strict liability. "There is none. It's written this way, it says if you cause a fire, period. Strict liability... The legislators know they know how to write things. They put no mens rea, it's a strict liability crime."

**Defense argument (Flora):**
Implied mens rea under MPC §2.02(3). "When it's not prescribed by law in the statute... the element is established if the person acts purposely, knowingly or recklessly."

**Outcome:** Effectively recklessness (due to hierarchy in §2.02(5)).

**Harcourt's point:** "That's like night and day... That's a big difference in terms of what you gotta prove at a trial."

### E. The Distribution Rule Fight (§2.02(4))

**End of class hypothetical:** Does the mens rea in the NY manslaughter statute attach to the result element "causes the death"?

**Prosecution argument:** No mens rea attached. Causing death is strict liability within the offense. "The part of the statute that says causing the death does not have a mens rea attached to it."

**Defense argument:** Apply MPC §2.02(4). "When the law defining an offense prescribes the kind of culpability that is sufficient for the commission of an offense, without distinguishing among the material elements thereof, such provision shall apply to all the material elements of the offense, unless a contrary purpose plainly appears."

**Harcourt's move:** Left it unresolved for Tuesday. Set up the battle: prosecution wants fewer elements; defense wants more elements with higher culpability thresholds.

## 3. EXAM SIGNALS

**Explicit signals:**

1. **Statute modeling as exam skill:** Harcourt spent significant time parsing the NY statute element-by-element. This is the core exam method. #EXAM_SIGNAL

2. **Felony murder preview:** "This concept we'll come back to next week when we look at when we're studying homicide, because it's very much like felony murder... Murder during a robbery, murder during a burglary gets automatically elevated because of the underlying felony." Direct connection to upcoming material that will definitely appear on exam. #EXAM_SIGNAL

3. **MPC default rules as exam moves:** The final exchange (noon, class ending) was Harcourt explicitly showing how to use §2.02(3) and §2.02(4) in statutory interpretation fights. "We'll start here on Tuesday." This is unfinished business = exam-critical. #EXAM_SIGNAL

**Implicit signals:**

- Multiple hypotheticals forcing prosecution vs. defense positioning on mens rea levels
- Repeated emphasis on element-by-element mapping (not just "what's the crime")
- Translation exercise from common law terms ("malicious," "willful") to MPC categories
- The hierarchy move (§2.02(5)) — if statute requires negligence, higher culpability satisfies it

**Connection to past exams:**
[SOURCE NEEDED — cross-reference with past exam index to see if mens rea element-mapping appears]

## 4. MAGIC WORDS / PHRASES

**Harcourt's exact language (use on exam):**

- "Conscious object" — when discussing purpose
- "Practically certain" — when discussing knowledge of results
- "Consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk" — when discussing recklessness
- "Should be aware" — when discussing negligence
- "Element-by-element" — when analyzing statutes
- "The hierarchy" — when discussing substitution rules (§2.02(5))
- "Contrary purpose plainly appears" — when arguing against distribution under §2.02(4)
- "Material element" — distinguish from jurisdictional/procedural elements
- "Conduct element / attendant circumstance / result of conduct" — the three types of actus reus
- "Night and day" — Harcourt used this to emphasize the huge difference strict liability vs. recklessness makes at trial

**Time-framing language:**
Brief mention re: Decina vs. Martin. "It's a time framing issue again... He was engaging in a voluntary act when he was starting to drive... Or narrowly when he has the accident he's experiencing an epileptic seizure which is not voluntary."

**Policy framing:**
Harcourt made the prosecutor-defense positioning explicit throughout. Not just "here's the doctrine" but "as a prosecutor you want X, as defense counsel you want Y."

## 6. BALKIN RECURRING ARGUMENT PAIRS - KEY FINDINGS

**Source:** Jack Balkin, "The Crystalline Structure of Legal Thought" (39 Rutgers L. Rev. 1, 1986), pp. 2-13 (OCR-extracted text).

**Core Thesis:** Legal arguments form a "crystalline structure" of predictable opposing pairs. These pairs recur across all legal debates, providing a systematic way to generate both sides of any issue.

**Key Recurring Pairs (from Balkin):**

1. **Individualism vs. Communalism**
   - **Individualism:** Respect individual choice; market forces produce optimal outcomes; anti-paternalism
   - **Communalism:** Impose social choices to correct market failures; paternalism/regulation for collective good
   - **Example in Mens Rea:** Subjective standards (individualism) vs. objective standards (communalism)

2. **Paternalism vs. Anti-Paternalism**
   - **Paternalism:** Foreclose choices for parties' own good (e.g., strict liability to protect victims)
   - **Anti-Paternalism:** Respect autonomy; no interference with choices
   - **Mens Rea Tie-in:** Objective negligence (paternalist) vs. subjective recklessness (anti-paternalist)

3. **Formal Realizability vs. Substantive Realizability**
   - **Formal:** Rules should be easy to administer (bright lines, no jury discretion)
   - **Substantive:** Standards allow fair case-by-case adjudication, even if harder to apply
   - **Mens Rea Tie-in:** MPC's subjective elements (substantive) vs. strict liability (formal)

4. **Rights as Freedom of Action vs. Rights as Security**
   - **Freedom of Action:** Rights protect doing what you want
   - **Security:** Rights protect against harms from others
   - **Mens Rea Tie-in:** Purpose/knowledge (freedom) vs. recklessness/negligence (security)

**Balkin's Method:** For any legal issue, identify which pair applies, then generate arguments on both sides. This creates "exhaustive catalogue" of positions.

**Relevance to Class:** Harcourt modeled this implicitly (prosecution vs. defense positioning). Syllabus Q4 asks for recurring arguments — Balkin systematizes them.

**Exam Application:** Use pairs to structure issue-spotters. E.g., "Prosecution argues formal realizability (strict liability easier to prove); defense counters substantive realizability (subjective mens rea fairer)."

## 5. PREWRITE FRAGMENTS ⭐ (CRITICAL OUTPUT)

### Fragment 1: Translating Common Law Mens Rea Terms to MPC

**Trigger:** Exam question uses terms like "malicious," "willful," or asks to interpret an old statute

**Prewrite paragraph (issue-spotter format):**

> The statute requires the act be done "maliciously." Under common law, "malice" is an imprecise term. Courts have interpreted it as either general wickedness (mere moral culpability for being engaged in a bad act) or as requiring specific mental states tied to the particular harm. Under MPC §2.02, mens rea must attach element-by-element. In *Regina v. Cunningham*, the court rejected the "wickedness" standard and held that "malicious" administration of a noxious substance requires either (1) actual intent to cause that specific harm, or (2) foreseeability of the harm—which translates to recklessness under the MPC. Recklessness requires the defendant consciously disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk. This is a subjective standard: the prosecution must prove what the defendant actually foresaw, not just what a reasonable person would have foreseen (which would be negligence). Here, [apply to facts: did defendant actually foresee the risk of this specific harm, or merely engage in other bad conduct?]. The prosecution will argue foreseeability was obvious; the defense will argue the defendant's actual awareness must be proven.

**Magic words included:**
- "element-by-element"
- "consciously disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk"
- "subjective standard"
- "actual foreseeability" vs "reasonable person" (negligence)

**Source:** Class 3 discussion of *Cunningham*; Harcourt's translation of "malicious" to recklessness

---

### Fragment 2: MPC Default Rule (§2.02(3)) — Silence Creates Recklessness Floor

**Trigger:** Statute states prohibited conduct but no mens rea, or exam asks "what mental state is required?"

**Prewrite paragraph:**

> The statute prohibits [conduct] but does not specify a required mental state. Under MPC §2.02(3), when culpability is not prescribed by law, a material element is established if a person acts purposely, knowingly, or recklessly. Due to the hierarchy in §2.02(5), this creates a floor of recklessness: any mental state higher than recklessness (purpose or knowledge) also satisfies the requirement, but negligence does not. The prosecution will argue for strict liability—that the legislature's silence indicates no mens rea is required, similar to regulatory offenses like driving without a license. The defense will invoke §2.02(3) to read in an implied recklessness requirement: the defendant must have consciously disregarded a substantial risk that [element] would occur. This makes the prosecution's burden significantly higher—they must prove the defendant's actual awareness of the risk, not merely that the defendant caused the harm. The difference is "night and day" in terms of what must be proven at trial.

**Magic words included:**
- "§2.02(3)"
- "floor of recklessness"
- "the hierarchy"
- "consciously disregarded a substantial risk"
- "night and day"

**Source:** Class 3 discussion of hypothetical arson statute; Harcourt's "Jesse (prosecution) vs. Flora (defense)" exchange

---

### Fragment 3: MPC Distribution Rule (§2.02(4)) — Does Mens Rea Apply to All Elements?

**Trigger:** Statute has one mens rea word but multiple elements; question is which elements get the mens rea

**Prewrite paragraph:**

> The statute states the defendant must "knowingly" [conduct], and the offense also requires [attendant circumstance] and causes [result]. Under MPC §2.02(4), when the law prescribes culpability without distinguishing among material elements, that mens rea applies to all material elements unless a contrary purpose plainly appears. The prosecution will argue a contrary purpose plainly appears from [structure/policy/penalty], limiting "knowingly" to the conduct element only, leaving the [circumstance/result] as strict liability or subject to a lower mens rea via §2.02(3). The defense will argue §2.02(4) distributes "knowingly" across all material elements, requiring the prosecution to prove the defendant was aware [circumstance existed] and was practically certain [result would occur]. As a practical matter, this multiplies the prosecution's burden: instead of proving one element with mens rea, they must prove three. The statutory language [read closely for textual clues about distribution]. The legislative history [if available] and the severity of the penalty [higher penalty suggests requiring more culpability] support the [prosecution/defense] position.

**Magic words included:**
- "§2.02(4)"
- "without distinguishing among the material elements"
- "contrary purpose plainly appears"
- "practically certain" (knowledge of result)
- "multiplies the prosecution's burden"

**Source:** Class 3 discussion of NY Manslaughter §125.20; Harcourt's end-of-class setup for the "causing death" fight

---

### Policy Fragment: Recklessness vs. Negligence — Subjective vs. Objective Standards

**Trigger:** Exam asks about policy justifications for different mens rea levels, or whether a statute should require subjective vs. objective fault

**Policy paragraph:**

> The choice between recklessness and negligence is the choice between subjective and objective culpability standards. Recklessness requires proof of what the defendant actually knew and consciously disregarded—a subjective inquiry into the defendant's mental state. Negligence asks only whether a reasonable person would have perceived the risk—an objective standard that does not require entering the defendant's mind at all. The prosecution favors negligence because it is easier to prove: circumstantial evidence of what a reasonable person would have known is sufficient, without needing to establish the defendant's actual awareness. The defense favors recklessness because criminal liability carries stigma and should require proof of culpable mental state, not merely a failure to meet an objective standard of care (which is the domain of tort law). The Model Penal Code generally sets recklessness as the default floor (§2.02(3)), reflecting a policy judgment that criminal punishment requires subjective fault. However, for public welfare offenses or regulatory crimes involving licensed professionals (e.g., *State v. Hazelwood* — oil spill), courts sometimes accept ordinary negligence as sufficient, reasoning that deterrence and public safety outweigh the need for subjective culpability. The tension is autonomy and fairness (requiring subjective fault) versus social protection and deterrence (accepting objective standards).

## 6. OUTLINE INSERTS (copy-paste ready)

**Insert location:** `05_OUTLINE/02_MENS_REA/`

```markdown
### MPC §2.02 — Four Mental States

**Rule (Harcourt's formulation):**
- **Purpose**: Conscious object to engage in conduct or cause result; aware/hope/believe circumstances exist
- **Knowledge**: Aware conduct is of that nature or circumstances exist; practically certain result will occur
- **Recklessness**: Consciously disregards substantial and unjustifiable risk (subjective awareness)
- **Negligence**: Should be aware of substantial and unjustifiable risk (objective—reasonable person standard)

**Hierarchy (§2.02(5)):** Purpose satisfies knowledge, recklessness, negligence. Knowledge satisfies recklessness, negligence. Recklessness satisfies negligence. (Substitution only works downward.)

**Element-by-element application:** Each material element (conduct, attendant circumstance, result) gets its own mens rea analysis. MPC §2.02(2) defines mens rea differently for conduct/circumstances vs. results.

---

### Default Rule: Silence → Recklessness (§2.02(3))

**Rule:** When statute doesn't specify mens rea, element is established if defendant acted purposely, knowingly, or recklessly. Due to hierarchy, this creates a **floor of recklessness**.

**Case:** Hypothetical arson statute ("causes a fire")
- Prosecution: Strict liability (silence = no mens rea)
- Defense: §2.02(3) reads in recklessness requirement

**Exam move:** Defense always argues for §2.02(3) when statute is silent. "Night and day" difference in proof burden.

#EXAM_SIGNAL

---

### Distribution Rule: Single Mens Rea → All Elements? (§2.02(4))

**Rule:** When statute prescribes culpability "without distinguishing among the material elements," that mens rea applies to ALL material elements, **unless a contrary purpose plainly appears**.

**Fight:** 
- **Prosecution:** Argue "contrary purpose plainly appears" from structure/policy/penalty to limit mens rea to one element
- **Defense:** Argue distribution applies across all material elements, multiplying prosecution's burden

**Hypo from class:** NY Manslaughter §125.20 — "with intent to cause physical injury... recklessly engages in conduct... and thereby causes death." Does "recklessly" attach to "causes death"? 
- Prosecution: No, causing death is strict liability within the offense
- Defense: §2.02(4) distributes recklessness (or use §2.02(3) to read in recklessness)

**Unresolved in class** — Harcourt said "we'll start here on Tuesday."

#EXAM_SIGNAL

---

### Translating Common Law Terms

**"Malicious" (*Regina v. Cunningham*):**
- Old definition (rejected): "wickedness" — general moral culpability
- Modern definition: Either (1) intent to cause specific harm, or (2) recklessness (foreseeability of specific harm)
- MPC translation: Recklessness (consciously disregarding substantial risk)

**"Willful" (MPC §2.02(8)):**
- Satisfied if defendant acts "knowingly" with respect to material elements (unless statute requires more)

**Key move:** Translate vague common law language to specific MPC mental states. Always argue element-by-element.

---

### Subjective vs. Objective Standards

**Recklessness = Subjective:**
- Must prove what defendant actually knew/foresaw
- Harder for prosecution to prove
- Respects autonomy/fairness (criminal stigma requires culpable mental state)

**Negligence = Objective:**
- Reasonable person standard
- Easier for prosecution (use circumstantial evidence)
- Serves deterrence/public safety (regulatory offenses)

**Case:** *Regina v. Cunningham* — "Having to prove it was foreseeable to him might be difficult for the prosecution. It would be a lot less difficult to prove that it was simply negligent."

**Policy tension:** Autonomy vs. safety; subjective fault vs. objective standards

---

### Strict Liability & Felony Murder (preview)

**Strict Liability:** No mens rea required for the result. If defendant is engaged in bad act (e.g., theft) and harm results (e.g., fire), guilty regardless of mental state about the harm.

**Case:** *Regina v. Faulkner* (lower court) — Stealing rum + fire results = arson (strict liability within felony)

**Connection to felony murder (next week):** "Any murder that happens during the course of a felony is a certain degree of murder because it happened during the course of a felony. Murder during a robbery, murder during a burglary gets automatically elevated." #EXAM_SIGNAL

**Defense challenge:** Faulkner dissent (Barry) argued must require knowledge or recklessness as to the specific harm (burning ship), not just intent to commit underlying felony (steal rum). Proportionality concern.

## 7. CORRECTIONS TO PREP

**What prep got wrong / what class clarified:**

| My Prep Said | Harcourt Actually Said | Correction |
|--------------|------------------------|------------|
| Expected deep dive into *Hazelwood* and *Santillanes* (ordinary vs. criminal negligence) | Didn't cover these cases at all; focused on *Cunningham* and *Faulkner* | Update outline: ordinary vs. criminal negligence distinction will likely come later |
| Expected *Elonis* discussion | Not covered | Hold for future class |
| Expected Balkin recurring argument pairs as explicit topic | Not explicitly discussed; Harcourt modeled the moves (prosecution vs. defense positioning) but didn't name them as "Balkin pairs" | The moves are embedded in his teaching method, not an explicit meta-discussion |
| Prep emphasized §2.02(3) and §2.02(4) as conceptual rules | Harcourt made them **live battlegrounds** — not just "know the rule" but "use it in prosecution/defense fights" | These are **active exam tools**, not passive doctrine |

**Major deltas (big differences from prep):**

1. **Omissions got 2 minutes, not 15:** Jones case mentioned quickly at start, then moved on. Not a focus.

2. **MPC parsing was hands-on, not abstract:** Harcourt didn't lecture about §2.02; he made students read it aloud, map a statute (NY Manslaughter), and argue both sides. This is the exam skill.

3. **Common law translation is critical:** Much more time than expected on translating "malicious" and "willful" to MPC terms. This is a recurring exam move.

4. **Felony murder preview:** Harcourt explicitly previewed next week's material and connected it to strict liability. This is intentional exam prep sequencing.

**Lessons for future prep:**

1. Assume Harcourt will use cases as **springboards for live statutory interpretation fights**, not as standalone "holdings to memorize"

2. Prepare prosecution AND defense scripts for every doctrine

3. When syllabus lists multiple cases, prioritize foundational ones (Cunningham/Faulkner) over modern applications (Hazelwood/Santillanes/Elonis) — he may skip the latter

4. Pay attention to "we'll come back to this" language — signals exam-important material
