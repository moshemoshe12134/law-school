# Review — Class #4 — 2026-01-27 — Intended Killings

**Purpose:** Extract exam-ready material (NOT summarize class)  
**Critical output:** Prewrite fragments (Section 5) + “Magic Words” (Section 4)

> QC note: Quotes below are copied from the raw transcript file and may contain transcription artifacts. Treat as “professor language to echo,” not as a pin-cite authority.

## 1. STATUTE/RULE AS HARCOURT FRAMED IT

### A. Missing mens rea → how judges infer it (Faulkner arson hypo)

**Professor’s frame:** felony + serious punishment makes strict liability less plausible; then choose interpretive method.

> “Arson… it’s a felony… it seems like it’s unlikely that it’s just gonna be strict liability… strict liability, that’s usually reserved for… traffic tickets.” (Transcript 2026-01-27, lines 19–20)

**Two routes he described (exam move = argue both):**
- **Common-law / moral blameworthiness**: require foreseeability / culpability.
- **Codification / MPC “general part”**: infer mens rea from MPC element rules.

> “Where you’re going as a judge… is to what’s called the general part of the model penal code… very general stuff that applies to all crimes.” (Transcript 2026-01-27, lines 31–32)

**Default mens rea (if MPC jurisdiction):**

> “If there’s no explicit mens rea… it has to be at a minimum, reckless… bottom line is, at a minimum, it’s gotta be recklessness.” (Transcript 2026-01-27, line 44)

### B. Degree structure vs MPC simplification (why premeditation matters)

**Professor’s big picture:** MPC collapses degree labels back into “murder / manslaughter / negligent homicide.”

> “Notice that what the Model Penal Code has done is it’s basically… gotten rid of all of the first degree, second degree… it’s just murder.” (Transcript 2026-01-27, lines 86–86)

**Target skill he stated:** You should be able to read any homicide statute and “do that game” (mix-and-match).

> “You should be able to read any… homicide statute in any state and kind of do that game, mix and match…” (Transcript 2026-01-27, lines 86–86)

## 2. ARGUMENTS HARCOURT PUSHED

### A. Statutory interpretation as an element-count fight

**Core move:** prosecution wants fewer elements; defense wants more (especially adding mens rea to results/attendant circumstances).

> “You want as many elements.” (Student; prof uses it as the defense goal.) (Transcript 2026-01-27, line 44)

> “You want the judge to have to instruct the jury… you need to find these four elements…” (Transcript 2026-01-27, line 44)

### B. Premeditation litigation = jury-instruction + time-framing

**Instruction problem:** equating “willful/deliberate/premeditated” with mere intent collapses the degree distinction.

> “It’s smushing everything. It’s smooshing everything.” (Transcript 2026-01-27, line 116)

> “It has to be an intent to kill and it needs to exist only for an instant…” (Transcript 2026-01-27, line 116)

**Tool:** Anderson-style evidentiary buckets (planning / motive / manner).

> “The factors are planning activity, motive, and then… particularity.” (Transcript 2026-01-27, line 119)

**Time-framing (prof explicitly named it):**

> “So you can try and do some time framing where you kind of expand the moment…” (Transcript 2026-01-27, line 128)

> “You’re doing the Kalman piece… trying to expand the time frame…” (Transcript 2026-01-27, line 128)

### C. “Reflex” as a defense narrative (tie back to actus reus rhetoric)

**What prof did:** he took the defense “reflex” story and translated it into voluntariness/blameworthiness language.

> “A reflex is just an involuntary act without any time to think.” (Transcript 2026-01-27, line 122)

> “An automatic reflex is not criminal liability.” (Transcript 2026-01-27, line 122)

## 3. EXAM SIGNALS #EXAM_SIGNAL

1. **Default mens rea when silent** (MPC §2.02(3)) is a “judge move” you should deploy. #EXAM_SIGNAL
2. **Degree-of-murder boundary fights are instruction fights** (“instant” vs “reflection”). #EXAM_SIGNAL
3. **Time-framing is the advocacy lever** (expand vs narrow). #EXAM_SIGNAL
4. **Anderson buckets are an evidentiary checklist** (and a rebuttal checklist). #EXAM_SIGNAL
5. **Prof will reward role-switching** (he repeatedly staged prosecution vs defense). #EXAM_SIGNAL
6. **Admin signal:** next class starts by finishing Carroll + Forrest (unfinished = likely tested). #EXAM_SIGNAL

## 4. MAGIC WORDS / PHRASES (QUOTE BANK)

Use these as “professor voice” lines in your exam answers (sprinkle, don’t drown).

- > “It’s a felony… unlikely that it’s just gonna be strict liability… traffic tickets…” (Transcript 2026-01-27, lines 19–20)
- > “The general part of the model penal code… very general stuff that applies to all crimes.” (Transcript 2026-01-27, lines 31–32)
- > “If there’s no explicit mens rea… at a minimum, it’s gotta be recklessness.” (Transcript 2026-01-27, line 44)
- > “It’s smushing everything. It’s smooshing everything.” (Transcript 2026-01-27, line 116)
- > “Planning activity, motive, and then… particularity.” (Transcript 2026-01-27, line 119)
- > “Try and do some time framing… expand the moment…” (Transcript 2026-01-27, line 128)
- > “A reflex is just an involuntary act without any time to think.” (Transcript 2026-01-27, line 122)
- > “An automatic reflex is not criminal liability.” (Transcript 2026-01-27, line 122)
- > “It’s just murder.” (Transcript 2026-01-27, line 86)

## 5. PREWRITE FRAGMENTS (CRITICAL OUTPUT)

### A. Silent mens rea → MPC default (Faulkner-style)

If the arson statute is silent on culpability, I argue (defense) that strict liability is disfavored for serious felonies; as the professor framed it, strict liability is typically for “traffic tickets,” not prison-level offenses. (Transcript 2026-01-27, lines 19–20) In an MPC jurisdiction, the court should infer mens rea from the “general part,” and apply MPC §2.02(3) so that “at a minimum” the prosecution must prove recklessness for the relevant material elements. (Transcript 2026-01-27, lines 31–32, 44) Prosecution will respond that purpose/knowledge evidence satisfies the recklessness floor under the culpability hierarchy, but the key is that mere causation without awareness is not enough.

### B. Premeditation: instruction + time-framing + Anderson buckets

This is a first-degree/second-degree boundary case that turns on jury-instruction and time-framing. If the court equates willful/deliberate/premeditated with “intent… in an instant,” it “smush[es] everything” and collapses the degree distinction. (Transcript 2026-01-27, line 116) Prosecution will expand the time frame and slot facts into Anderson-style proxies—planning activity, motive, and manner/particularity—to show reflection. (Transcript 2026-01-27, lines 119, 128) Defense will narrow the relevant moment and argue spontaneity: no meaningful planning, weak motive, and no particular manner showing a preconceived design.

## 6. OUTLINE INSERTS (copy/paste)

```markdown
### Missing mens rea (MPC default move)
- Harcourt framing: felony + punishment makes strict liability less plausible (“traffic tickets” line).
- If MPC jurisdiction: go to “general part” → default culpability → minimum recklessness (MPC §2.02(3)).
```

```markdown
### Premeditation fights (method)
- Jury instruction can “smush everything” if it equates premeditation with mere intent.
- Use time-framing explicitly: prosecution expands the moment; defense narrows it.
- Use Anderson-style buckets: planning / motive / manner (as evidentiary proxies).
```

## 7. CORRECTIONS TO PREP

**Prep expected:** mostly homicide (Carroll/Guthrie) + degree structure (common-law vs MPC §210).  
**In class:** prof spent substantial time finishing the elements/statutory-interpretation unit (Faulkner → MPC defaults) before premeditation, and flagged that **Carroll + Forrest** would be finished next class. (Transcript 2026-01-27, line 2; line 158)
