## Templates (to be filled)
- Justice / “criminal justice” definitions
- Punishment justifications (retribution, deterrence, incapacitation, rehabilitation, abolition/critique)
- Critical theory lenses (power, discipline, legitimacy, racial subordination)
- Statutory interpretation frames (textualism/structure/purpose; ambiguity; institutional competence)
