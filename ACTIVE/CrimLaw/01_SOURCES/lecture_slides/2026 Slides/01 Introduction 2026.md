"The whole criminal system came to be used as a method of keeping Negroes at work and intimidating them. Consequently, there began to be a demand for jails and penitentiaries beyond the natural demand due to the rise of crime." 

W.E.B. Du Bois,  Black Reconstruction in America: 1860-1880  (New York: The Free Press, 1998), page 506.

At a  motions hearing , he moved for a change of venue, alleging that due to extensive pretrial publicity, he would be unable to receive a fair trial in Monroe County.
