The only difference in the counts of the indictment is the allegation of ownership of the money alleged to have been taken in the robbery.

## McMillian v. State, 616 So.2d 933 (1993) {#slide-8}

At arraignment on December 14, 1987, appellant pleaded not guilty. He moved to sever his case from that of Myers, and his motion was granted. At a motions hearing, he moved for a change of venue, alleging that due to extensive pretrial publicity, he would be unable to receive a fair trial in Monroe County. After an evidentiary hearing, the trial court granted the motion and transferred the case to Baldwin County for trial.

## Common Law Tradition {#slide-17}

	Blackstone,  Commentaries  Book 4 

	 " In all temporal jurisdictions an  overt  act or some open evidence of an intended crime is necessary, in order to demonstrate the depravity of the will, before the man is liable to punishment. And as a vicious will without a vicious act is no crime, so an unwarrantable act without a vicious will is no crime. "  

## Common Law Tradition {#slide-18}

	Blackstone,  Commentaries  Book 4 

	to constitute a crime against human laws there must be,  first , a vicious will; and  second , an unlawful act consequent upon such vicious will

		= (1)  mens rea  and (2)  actus reus

"Any person who, while intoxicated or drunk, appears in a public place where one or more persons are present, ... and manifests a drunken condition by boisterous or indecent conduct, or loud and profane discourse, shall, on conviction, be fined."  Alabama Code 1940, Title 14, Sec. 120.

## Model Penal Code {#slide-21}

Act  is  " bodily movement "  MPC 1.13(2) 

MPC 1.13(9) defines  elements of offense

Key concepts =  " conduct "  or result or attendant circumstances.

MPC 2.01(1): if conduct, must include either: 

Conduct which involves a  voluntary act

Omission to perform an act where there is a duty

Voluntary act : defined by negatives 2.01(2)

Not reflex; sleep; unconsc; hypnosis; and (d)	

Omission : only if there is a duty MPC 2.01(3)

## ELEMENTS DEFINING A CRIME.... {#slide-22}

Model Penal Code Sec. 1.13

	

Element of an offense = 

	(1)	 conduct,

	(2)  attendant circumstances, or 

	(3)  a result of conduct

## Kelman ,  Interpretive Constructs {#slide-23}

4 unconscious constructs :

- broad and narrow time frames

	example:  status crimes (600)

- disjoined and unified accounts

	example:  involuntary acts (603; 618)

- broad and narrow views of intent

	example:  intent to kill vs. intent to pull the trigger

- broad and narrow views of the defendant	

	example:  reasonable person (634)

2 conscious constructs:

- free will vs. determinism

	e.g. insanity defense as determinist (648)

	e.g. provocation (645)  

- rules vs. standards

	e.g. 660   Papachristou  case

To what end?

p. 669:  Just be realist and do better policy work. 

p. 670:  Interpret correlations (law is politics)

p. 671:  Just non-rational filters.
