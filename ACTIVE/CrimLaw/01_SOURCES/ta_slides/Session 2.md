## Homicide in the Model Penal Code {#slide-3}

MPC §  § 210.0 Definitions.

- (1)    ''human being'' means a person who has been born and is alive;
- (2)    ''bodily injury'' means physical pain, illness or any impairment of physical condition;
- (3)    ''serious bodily injury'' means bodily injury which creates a substantial risk of death or which causes serious, permanent disfigurement, or protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ;
- (4)    ''deadly weapon'' means any firearm or other weapon, device, instrument, material or substance, whether animate or inanimate, which in the manner it is used or is intended to be used is known to be capable of producing death or serious bodily injury. 

## Homicide in the Model Penal Code {#slide-4}

§ 210.1. Criminal Homicide.

- (1) A person is guilty of criminal homicide if he purposely, knowingly, recklessly or negligently causes the death of another human being.
- (2) Criminal homicide is murder, manslaughter or negligent homicide.

§ 210.2. Murder.

Except as provided in Section 210.3(1)(b), criminal homicide constitutes murder when:

it is committed purposely or knowingly; or

it is committed recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life. Such recklessness and indifference are presumed if the actor is engaged or is an accomplice in the commission of, or an attempt to commit, or flight after committing or attempting to commit robbery, rape or deviate sexual intercourse by force or threat of force, arson, burglary, kidnapping or felonious escape.

 Murder is a felony of  the first degree  \[but a person convicted of murder may be sentenced to death, as provided in Section 210.6\].

- (a) mens rea: purposely or knowingly 
- (b) is essentially felony -murder rule -- presumes sort of heightened recklessness and indifference but allows for rebuttal (though this rebuttal isn't as protective as we might expect)

<!-- -->

- If defense, you would argue against this presumption saying it wasn't a heightened standard of recklessness and such recklessness shouldn't be presumed

## Homicide in the Model Penal Code {#slide-5}

§ 210.3. Manslaughter.

Criminal homicide constitutes manslaughter when:

(a) it is committed recklessly; or

(b) a homicide which would otherwise be murder is committed under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance for which there is reasonable explanation or excuse. The reasonableness of such explanation or excuse shall be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the actor\'s situation under the circumstances  as he believes them to be . \[subjective standard  → defendant friendly\]

- Manslaughter is a felony of the   second degree .

§ 210.4. Negligent Homicide. 

Criminal homicide constitutes negligent homicide when it is committed negligently.

- Negligent homicide is a felony of the  third degree .

Reminder : Mitigation down from murder to manslaughter can happen in cases of EED and mitigation up from manslaughter to murder can happen in cases of felony/extreme recklessness 

## Common Law Homicide: Murder {#slide-6}

- Actus reus:  killing another without justification, excuse, or mitigating circumstance 
- Mens rea : killing with "malice aforethought" 
- Types of malice aforethought: 

<!-- -->

- Premeditation
- The intent to cause death
- The intent to inflict grievous bodily injury on another
- Depraved heart (an extremely reckless disregard and indifference to the value of human life) 
- The intent to commit a felony, during the commission or attempted commission of which a death results (aka felony murder: during the course of a felony) // i.e. unintentional killing can be murder if done in the course of a felony

<!-- -->

- Classified by degrees based on willfulness, deliberation and premeditation (legislative grading)
- 1st degree: if both  intentional  and  premeditated , or if it involves a killing during the course of another major felony (as defined by statute)
- 2nd degree: anything not falling within 1st degree 

<!-- -->

- E.g.,  State v. Guthrie  (you can have intent without premeditation → second degree //  Carroll  view; ∆ friendly) 

## Intentional Killing: Premeditation {#slide-7}

Commonwealth v. Carroll  (PA 1963)

Facts :  After an argument, defendant shot his wife in the back of the head (2x) while they were laying in bed. She allegedly harmed their children, and it is disputed whether she suffered from a mental disorder. The gun was placed in the bedroom for the wife's safety. Testified that he didn't "know positively" if he intended to murder his wife

Statue :  First degree murder is a willful, deliberate, and premeditated killing.

Issue :  Whether the defendant's actions constitute a premeditated killing.

Holding :  This is a premeditated killing.

- Premeditation can occur just in the moments before a killing.
- The premeditation required for first-degree murder can be satisfied even if it occurred very shortly before the killing. 
- Length of time and a general lack of planning doesn't preclude a finding of premeditation
- Premeditation can be satisfied either an instant before or simultaneously with the act of homicide.

<!-- -->

- Basically, premeditation is any intent to kill

## Intentional Killing: Premeditation  {#slide-8}

State v. Guthrie  (WV 1995)

Facts :  After being subjected to heckling by the victim, the defendant grabbed a knife and stabbed the victim. The defendant had identifiable mental disorders and was particularly sensitive about his nose, which the victim flicked prior to the stabbing. Defendant testified to having a panic attack before killing.

- Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life.
- The jury was instructed with no meaningful distinction between first- and second-degree murders.

Issue :  Whether the trial court erred in its jury instruction on premeditation.

Holding :  The trial court erred. Premeditation requires  some  time to contemplate the decision to kill, though there isn't any set time.

- There must be evidence indicating that the defendant weighed and considered his decision to kill.
- Premeditation must not be equated with intent to kill. 
- Contrary to Carroll

## Homicide: Voluntary Manslaughter {#slide-9}

- In common law:  Murder + provocation = voluntary manslaughter

<!-- -->

- Intentional killing that would otherwise be murder but committed in sudden heat of passion as a result of adequate provocation without cooling off period

<!-- -->

- Murder may be mitigated to "voluntary manslaughter" where there was a (1) "provocation" that (2) caused defendant to act in the "heat of passion." 

<!-- -->

- Provocation is therefore an excuse or affirmative defense.

<!-- -->

- Why do we think that people who are "provoked" to kill are less culpable? 

<!-- -->

- Is it fairer to essentially pin some of the blame on the provoker? 
- Do reasonable people react in this way, even to severe provocation?
- If reasonable people don't, then does voluntary manslaughter culpability track this difference?

<!-- -->

- Two views on what is adequate provocation:

<!-- -->

- Girouard  represents the common law approach.
- Maher  represents a minority view that some jurisdictions follow.
- Casassa  represents the MPC approach---some states have adopted fully; others have revised it.

## Intended Killings: Provocation/Heat of Passion  {#slide-10}

Girouard v. State  (Md. Ct. App. 1991)

Facts :  Defendant and his wife got into an argument. She told him she wanted a divorce and asked, "What are you going to do \[about it\]?" He grabbed a knife hidden behind a pillow and stabbed her 19(!) times.

Holding :  The victim did not provoke the defendant.

- Words alone are inadequate to constitute provocation. 
- Girouard couldn't have feared for bodily harm, because his was wife was much smaller than him.

Takeaway :  Words are sufficient only if the words are both:

- (1) calculated to inflame the passion of a reasonable man and tend to cause him to act for the moment from passion rather than reason; and 
- (2) accompanied by conduct indicating a present intention and ability to cause the defendant bodily harm.

## Intentional Killing: Provocation  {#slide-11}

Maher v. People  (Mich. 1862)

Facts :  Defendant suspected his wife of cheating on him. He followed her and the paramour and saw they disappeared into the woods. Defendant shot the paramour but didn't kill him. He was charged with assault with intent to murder.

Issue:  Was the evidence of the affair between Hunt and Maher's wife properly rejected by the trial court?

Holding : No.  Evidence of provocation should've been admitted at the trial level.

- It would've been within the jury's competence to find whether the conduct was committed as a result of provocation. 

Takeaway :  In a  Maher  jurisdiction, you don't need fear of bodily harm. Provocation is a jury question.

- Per Harcourt, this is an arcane understanding of provocation motivated by patriarchal conceptions of a man's "right" to his woman. Look at the year this case was decided.
- This view of provocation is the minority approach.

## Intentional Killing: Provocation/Heat of Passion {#slide-12}

People v. Casassa  (NY Ct. App. 1980)

Facts :  Defendant's girlfriend broke up with him, and he began stalking her. On the night of the killing, he broke into her home to offer her gifts. When she refused them, he stabbed her several times.

Statute :  Under NY law, it is an affirmative defense to second degree murder that the defendant acted under EED for which there is a reasonable explanation/excuse. 

- Defendant's burden of proof

Holding :  Defendant's (E)ED does not have a reasonable explanation/excuse.

- Subjective: Yes, the defendant was clearly emotionally distressed.
- Objective(ish): His emotional distress was not reasonably justified from the viewpoint of a person in the defendant's circumstances.

Note:    MPC §210.3  states that a murder is downgraded to manslaughter when it was "committed under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance for which there is reasonable explanation or excuse."
