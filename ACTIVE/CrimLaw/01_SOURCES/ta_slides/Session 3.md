## Criminal Law                Session 3 {#slide-1}

## Unintentional Killing: Felony Murder {#slide-2}

Common Law

- Refers to causing death in the course of perpetrating another felony. Strict liability offense in the sense that it doesn't require a distinct mens rea to kill; rather, the intent to commit felony accounts for the mens rea that resulted in the death of victim.

MPC § 201.2

- Has no standalone felony-murder provision. Doesn't make felony-murder a strict liability offense but creates a  presumption of recklessness  (a conscious appreciation and disregard as to risk of death) when a homicide occurs during the commission of certain felonies. MPC doesn't like the felony-murder rule, but most states nonetheless retain some form of the rule

## Unintentional Killing: Felony Murder {#slide-3}

Regina v. Serné  (UK 1887)

Facts :  Leon Serné and his family were in severe debt, living in house above a store in London. Serné had taken out a life insurance policy on his son Sjaak. Within a month the store and house burned down, and both his sons died. At trial, prosecution introduced evidence that Serné and Goldfinch had been seen together in the shop shortly before the fire started. It was alleged they willfully set fire and were indicted for Sjaak's murder.

Issue :  If a person commits a felonious act known to be dangerous to life and likely to cause death to another person, and death results, is it murder?

Holding :  Yes, but narrower holding of felony-murder:  Only an action taken w/ intent to commit a felony that is known to create a danger to human life can constitute felony-murder, not just killing of another person by an act done with intent to commit felony.

- Reflects view generally accepted in American courts
- Cf.  Stamp

## Unintentional Killing: Felony Murder {#slide-4}

People v. Stamp  (Cal. 1969)

Facts :  Defendant burglarized Honeyman's store, robbed him at gunpoint. After, Honeyman (60-year-old w/ history of heart disease) died of a heart attack. Doctors testified that the fright from the robbery was too much of a shock to Honeyman's system.

Holding :  First-degree murder conviction is upheld.

- Felony-murder doctrine not limited to foreseeable deaths; a felon is instead held strictly liable for all killings committed by him/his accomplices in the course of the felony.
- As long as the homicide is the direct causal result of the robbery the felony-murder rule applies whether or not the death was a natural/probable consequence of the robbery.
- The robber takes his victim as he finds him.

## More on Felony Murder and what it says about punishment {#slide-5}

- Footnote to Serne quotes Edward Coke, Institute 46: If a man accidentally shoots another hunting and trespassing on another's land, that constitutes felony murder. However, if a man accidentally shoots another while hunting on his own land, that is considered an accidental killing.

<!-- -->

- Shows class/property dimension: What renders the same act punishable is the fact that you're not the property owner.
- Felony murder in part comes from class and is woven into the law

Harcourt's thoughts: Felony murder operates as a way to entrench social order-- including systemic racism-- into the law. That's why doctrines like felony murder rule allow for punishment to be so disproportionate from moral culpability.

## Unintentional Killing: Felony Murder {#slide-6}

State v. Canola  (NJ 1977)

Facts :  Jewelry store owner resisted an attempted armed robbery by defendant (Canola) and his accomplices. One accomplice and the store owner exchanged gunfire, both died. Defendant and two accomplices indicted on one count of robbery and two counts of murder (store owner and co-felon). Defendant found guilty on both murder counts and sentenced to two concurrent terms of life imprisonment.

Issue :  Under NJ law, can a defendant be found guilty of felony-murder when during his robbery of a store one of the robbery victims shoots one of the defendant's accomplices?

Holding :  No. Court endorses agency theory of felony murder and rejects proximate cause theory.

- Some felonies are not as blameworthy as premeditated killings
- Concepts of foreseeability and proximate cause have shallow relevance to culpability for murder in the 1 st  degree 
- Gradations of criminal liability should accord with the degree of moral cu lpability for the actor's conduct

## Unintentional Killing: Extreme Recklessness {#slide-7}

Commonwealth v. Malone  (PA 1946)

Facts : A 17-year-old killed his 13-year-old friend while playing Russian poker.

Rule : When an individual commits an act of gross recklessness for which he must reasonably anticipate that death to another is  likely  to result, he exhibits that "wickedness of disposition, hardness of heart, cruelty, recklessness of consequences, and a mind regardless of social duty" which proves that malice was present.

Issue : Do the facts justify a conviction for murder over manslaughter?

Holding : Yes, charge of murder is correct.

- Malice here is evidenced by defendant's "doing of an uncalled-for act in callous disregard of its likely harmful effects on others." 

<!-- -->

- "When an individual commits an act of gross recklessness for which he must reasonably anticipate that death to another is likely the result, he exhibits that wickedness of disposition...which proves there was malice"

<!-- -->

- Lack of motive is not dispositive.

## Reckless \[Manslaughter\] and Negligent Homicide {#slide-8}

Commonwealth v. Welansky  (Mass. Supreme Judicial Court, 1944)

Facts:  Defendant ran the Coconut Grove nightclub. There was only one entrance; three emergency exits were poorly marked, and two were either locked or blocked. One night an employee lit a match to see a bulb he was replacing, igniting an inflammable artificial palm tree. The fire spread quickly. Many patrons were unable to escape and died.

Issue : Can an involuntary manslaughter through wanton or reckless conduct conviction be upheld? 

Holding/Reasoning:  Yes. (1) D was aware that venue was not in compliance with local safety regulation; and

(2) D knew that construction plans for new party of lounge precluded the possibility of installing the doors necessary to comply with safety regulations 

- Actus reus = omission caused death
- As owner of club, defendant had a legal duty to his invitees to use reasonable care in keeping the premises safe for their use and preventing known dangers.
- "was enough to prove that death resulted from his wanton or reckless disregard" of safety protocols
- Usually wanton or reckless conduct consists of an affirmative act...But where as in the present case there is a duty of care... wanton or reckless conduct may consist of intentional failure to take such care in disregard of the probable harmful consequences to them or of their right to care. "

## Reckless \[Manslaughter\] and Negligent Homicide {#slide-9}

People v. Hall  (CO Supreme Court, 2000)

Facts:  While skiing, defendant collided with victim who was on the slope below. Victim died as a result. Defendant was charged with reckless manslaughter.

Issue:  what's a substantial and unjustifiable risk?

Statute:  Reckless manslaughter requires that a person "recklessly cause the death of another person."

- Conduct is reckless when the actor consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that death may result. (MPC §2.02)

Holding:  this was a substantial and unjustifiable risk → affirm conviction of reckless manslaughter (MPC)

- Def created substantial risk (skiing at excessive speed with lack of control) and unjustified risk ("enjoyment of skiing does not justify skiing at the speeds and with the lack of control Hall exhibited.")
- Gross Deviation From SoC of a Reasonable, Law-Abiding Person in the Circumstances

<!-- -->

- Extreme violation of civil liability duty for skiers to avoid collisions and defendant disregarded risk ("Hall\'s knowledge and training could give rise to the reasonable inference that he was aware of the possibility that by skiing so fast and out of control he might collide with and kill another skier unless he regained control and slowed down.")
- Gross deviation of standard of care takes it from civil liability to criminal liability  

Takeaway:  a risk of death that has less than a 50% chance of occurring can still be substantial, and thus, disregarding it can still be reckless

## Reckless \[Manslaughter\] and Negligent Homicide {#slide-10}

State v. Williams  (Wash. CoA, 1971)

Facts:  mother and stepfather of baby were convicted of manslaughter for negligently failing to take their baby to a doctor when he had an abscessed tooth that became infected and developed gangrene

Statute:  In Washington, involuntary manslaughter is committed if the death of the victim is the proximate result of simple negligence

- Court applies reasonable person standard to negligence

Holding:  this was simple negligence, and such negligence is sufficient to support a conviction of negligent manslaughter.

- If a person commits ordinary negligence, i.e. fails to exercise ordinary caution that a reasonable person would exercise under the same or similar circumstances, and such negligence proximately causes the death of another, a person is guilty of involuntary manslaughter.

Takeaway:  civil / tort negligence resulting in death can be the basis for involuntary manslaughter

- Note: this statute was later changed to require criminal negligence
- Additional food for thought: Walter & Bernice Williams were Native American, respectively had 6th and 11th grade educations & feared state intervention/taking of children.

- Should this matter?

##  Issues of Causation {#slide-11}

Note: There doesn't always need to be a causal relationship between the injury and harm. BUT, when the statute defines a crime with a causal element, that element must be found by the factfinder beyond a reasonable doubt.

MPC 2.03

(1) Conduct is the cause of a result when:

○ (a) it is an antecedent but for which the result in question would not have occurred; and

○ (b) the relationship between the conduct and result satisfies any additional causal requirements imposed by the Code or by the

law defining the offense.

(2) When purposely or knowingly causing a particular result is an element of an offense, the element is not established if the actual result is not within the purpose or the contemplation of the actor UNLESS:

○ (a) the actual result differs from that designed or contemplated, as the case may be, ONLY in the respect that a different person

or different property is injured or affected or that the injury or harm designed or contemplated would have been more serious or

more extensive than that caused; OR

○ (b) the actual result involves the same kind of injury or harm as that designed or contemplated and is not too remote or

accidental in its occurrence to have a \[just\] bearing on the actor\'s liability or on the gravity of his offense.

(3) When recklessly or negligently causing a particular result is an element of an offense, the element is not established if the actual result is not within the purpose or the contemplation of the actor UNLESS:

○ (a) the actual result differs from that designed or contemplated, as the case may be, ONLY in the respect that a different person

or different property is injured or affected or that the injury or harm designed or contemplated would have been more serious or

more extensive than that caused; OR

○ (b) the actual result involves the same kind of injury or harm as that designed or contemplated and is not too remote or

accidental in its occurrence to have a \[just\] bearing on the actor\'s liability or on the gravity of his offense.

(4) When causing a particular result is a material element of an offense for which absolute liability is imposed by law, the element is not established unless the actual result is a probable consequence of the actor\'s conduct.

##  Issues of Causation {#slide-13}

People v. Acosta  (CA. CoA, 1991)

Facts:  police helicopters crash during the police chase of Acosta → 3 people died

Issue:  did Acosta cause the deaths? Can awareness of the dangers on the ground be imputed to dangers in the air?

- Was the helicopter pilot's illegal maneuver an intervening cause that disrupts the causal chain that justifies holding Acosta responsible?

Holding:  yes, Acosta was the factual and proximate cause of the deaths (n.b. conviction still reduced from murder to manslaughter because no malice / mens rea)

Reasoning: 

- Causation-in-fact:  but for Acosta's conduct, helicopters would not have been in the position to crash
- Re proximate cause: this result was foreseeable and not highly extraordinary

<!-- -->

- "Appreciable probability that one of the pursuers, in the heat of the chase, may act negligently or recklessly"

##  Issues of Causation {#slide-14}

People v. Arzon  (SC NY, 1978)

Facts:  aptly named defendant set fire to a couch; the hazardous conditions and the smoke from an independently set fire on another floor resulted in a fireman dying

- Defendant's argument: no causal link between underlying crime and death → can't be convicted

Reasoning:  foreseeable that firefighters would respond to the fire; fire set by defendant was an "indispensable link in the chain of events that resulted in death" / added to the problem

-  Irrelevant that the other fire contributed to the hazardous conditions

Holding:  motion to dismiss murder counts of indictment is denied

○ Note: seems like he's only been indicted so far - this doesn't necessarily mean he'll be convicted

Rule:   "an individual is criminally liable if his conduct was a sufficiently direct cause of the death, and the ultimate harm is something which should have been foreseen as being reasonably related to his acts"

- Need not be "the sole and exclusive" cause

Takeaway:  independent intervening cause doesn't absolve Arzon because his act put fireman in a position where he was "particularly vulnerable to the separate and independent force"
