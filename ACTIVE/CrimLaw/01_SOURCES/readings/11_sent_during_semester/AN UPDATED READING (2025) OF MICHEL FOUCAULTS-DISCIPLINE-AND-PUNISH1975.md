AN	UPDATED	READING	(2025)	OF	MICHEL	FOUCAULT’S
DISCIPLINE	AND	PUNISH	(1975)

Bernard	E.	Harcourt *

Michel	Foucault’s	book,	Discipline	and	Punish,	burst	onto	the	intellectual	scene

in	February	1975	to	much	acclaim,	but	significant	controversy.	Many	historians	found

the	work	too	philosophical	and	not	up	to	the	standards	of	positive	historical	science.

"Mr.	 Foucault	 races	 through	 three	 centuries	 at	 full	 gallop,	 like	 a	 barbarian	 on

horseback,”	 the	 historian	 Jacques	 Léonard	 wrote.	 “He	 burns	 the	 steppe	 without

caution”	(Léonard	1977,	226).	Many	philosophers	found	the	work	too	historical	and

lacking	 a	 clear	 conceptual	 architecture	 (Taylor	 1986;	 Walzer	 1986).	 Sociologists

lamented	the	absence	of	a	more	sustained	engagement	with	Erving	Goffman	and	the

classic	texts	on	total	institutions	(Robert	2010).	Prison	activists	and	political	actors

were	 puzzled	 by	 the	 historical	 details	 and	 would	 have	 preferred	 a	 more	 overtly

political	 manifesto.	 “We	 were	 expecting	 a	 somewhat	 militant	 book,”	 observed	 the

historian	 Jacques	 Revel.	 “I	 would	 say	 that	 we	 are	 ‘disappointed’—in	 the	 technical

sense	of	the	word—insofar	as	the	militancy	of	this	book	is	not	at	all	what	we	thought

we	would	find	in	it”	(Revel	2010,	92).

Despite	the	polemics,	Foucault’s	book	quickly	became	an	essential	reference.

Within	 a	 few	 short	 years,	 it	 became	 impossible	 to	 write	 about	 the	 prison	 in	 any

discipline	without	acknowledging	the	book	or	positioning	one’s	research	in	relation

to	 Foucault—and	 that	 still	 remains	 true	 today.	 It	 explains	 why	 the	 controversies

surrounding	Discipline	and	Punish	have	not	abated.	Today,	a	new	set	of	studies	argue

1

that	imprisonment	existed	in	ancient	times	in	Rome	and	Greece	and	that,	in	effect,

Foucault	 misled	 by	 dating	 it	 to	 the	 modern	 period	 (Abolafia	 2024;	 Larsen	 and

Letteney	 2025;	 Folch	 forthcoming).	 “Turning	 decisively	 against	 Foucault,”	 Adam

Gopnik	notes	in	a	recent	book	review	in	the	New	Yorker,	scholars	like	Matthew	Larsen

and	 Mark	 Letteney	 “write	 that	 incarceration	 may	 be	 ‘a	 facet	 of	 every	 hierarchical,

complex	society.’	In	other	words,	it’s	always	been	with	us”	(Gopnik	2025,	59).

But	Discipline	and	Punish	was	never	intended	to	be	a	“history”	of	the	prison.

That	indeed	would	have	entailed	cataloguing	the	prior	carceral	institutions,	from	the

debtors’	prisons	and	the	infamous	Rasphuis	in	Amsterdam,	to	Medieval	dungeons	and

their	 Greek	 and	 Roman	 antecedents—the	 many	 prisons

throughout

the

Mediterranean	 world	 during	 the	 Byzantine,	 Hellenistic,	 and	 Roman	 eras,	 including

the	 famous	 Mamertine	 Prison	 in	 Rome	 built	 in	 the	 seventh	 century	 BCE	 (Ruyter-

Harcourt	2015).	Foucault	was	doing	something	else:	not	a	history	of	the	prison,	but	a

genealogy	which	sought	to	unearth	the	new	way	in	which	power	circulated	in	modern

society,	 and	 not	 only	 by	 means	 of	 the	 prison,	 but	 also	 through	 schools,	 factories,

hospitals,	psychiatric	wards,	barracks,	and	convents.	Foucault	labelled	it	disciplinary

power,	panoticism.	As	Gopnik	rightly	observes,	“Foucault’s	point	[about	the	prison]

was,	in	retrospect,	more	illustrative	than	strictly	argumentative:	the	modern	prison

was	a	Black	Mass	parody	of	other	institutions	of	modernity—the	factory,	the	office,

the	psychiatric	hospital—where	people	are	processed	and	sent	on	their	way,	reduced

to	abstract	entries	in	a	ledger”	(Gopnik	2025,	60).

More	than	a	half-century	after	its	publication,	and	with	the	benefit	of	a	new

trove	 of	 archives,	 unpublished	 manuscripts,	 and	 historical	 documentation,	 it	 is

2

possible	now	to	more	fully	discern	the	historical	import	of	Foucault’s	book:	Discipline

and	Punish	marked	the	end—the	bookend—of	modern	political	theory	and	launched

a	new	and	now	dominant	approach	to	analyze	relations	of	power	in	society.	Just	as

the	Leviathan	of	Thomas	Hobbes	captured	the	turn	in	modern	political	philosophy	to

theories	 of	 sovereignty	 and	 representation,	 Discipline	 and	 Punish	 crystalized	 the

contemporary	way	to	understand	how	power	circulates	and	paved	the	way	for	the

study	of	contemporary	modes	of	governing.	By	focusing	on	what	historians	refer	to

as	the	modern	period	(sixteenth	to	nineteenth	centuries),	Foucault	traced	a	genealogy

of	 modern	 forms	 of	 power—and	 not	 a	 history	 of	 the	 prison—in	 order	 to	 give	 his

readers	the	tools	to	understand	the	present	moment.

The	task	of	this	essay	is	to	update	our	reading	of	Discipline	and	Punish	in	light

of	 the	 new	 resources	 that	 have	 surfaced	 over	 the	 past	 50	 years—archives,

manuscripts,	 historical	 documents—in	 order	 to	 actualize	 the	 import	 of	 Foucault’s

book.	The	essay	will	explore	perspectives	and	readings	of	the	book	that	have	been

opened	 as	 a	 result	 of	 recent	 access	 to	 the	 Collège	 de	 France	 lectures,	 the	 Foucault

archives,	and	G.I.P.	documents.	Based	on	those	new	resources,	the	essay	will	redefine

the	central	contribution	of	the	book	and	explore	how	to	use	Foucault’s	book	today—

and	also,	how	to	go	beyond	it.

It	is	important	to	understand	that	the	impact	of	Discipline	and	Punish	at	the

time	of	its	publication	was	attributable	to	its	historical	conjuncture—two	historical

factors	in	particular.	First,	Discipline	and	Punish	provided	a	forceful	complement	or

alternative	 to	 Marxism,	 which	 was	 beginning	 to	 lose	 its	 hegemonic	 status	 among

European	intellectuals	in	the	immediate	post-May	‘68	period.	The	book	challenged	a

3

political	 field	 that	 was	 littered	 by	 the	 fragments	 of	 Marxism—Freudo-Marxism,

Hegelian-Marxism,	 Husserlo-Marxism,	 Maoism,	 etc.—and	 imposed	 a	 series	 of	 new

concepts:	 surveillance,	 panopticism,	 knowledge-power,	 discipline,	 power	 relations,

illegalisms,	 regimes	 of	 truth,	 juridical	 forms,	 docile	 bodies.	 Second,	 Discipline	 and

Punish	 proposed	 a	 new	 relationship	 between	 critique	 and	 praxis.	 The	 militant

engagements	 of	 Foucault,	 alongside	 prisoners	 and	 activists

in	 the	 Groupe

d’information	 sur	 les	 prisons	 (Prisons	 Information	 Group	 or	 G.I.P.),	 inspired	 the

development	 of	 a	 new	 philosophical	 and	 historical	 method—genealogy—which

Foucault	first	experimented	in	his	early	lectures	at	the	Collège	de	France	and	then

perfected	in	his	book	in	1975.	Vice	versa,	those	theoretical	innovations	shaped	the

program	Foucault	would	advance	within	the	G.I.P.

As	a	result,	Discipline	and	Punish	quickly	provided	a	path	forward	to	overcome

traditional	 concepts	 like	 repression	 or	 coercion,	 class	 struggle	 or	 ideological	 state

apparatuses,	 and	 to	 reveal	 their	 productive	 side:	 in	 the	 nineteenth	 century,	 the

existence	 of	 a	 subject-creating	 knowledge-power	 that	 shaped	 individuals’	 bodies,

imposed	 their	 optimal	 distribution	 across	 means	 of	 production,	 and	 facilitated	 the

maximum	 extraction	 of	 their	 labor	 through	 the	 management	 of	 their	 time,	 the

surveillance	of	their	behavior,	and	the	control	of	their	lives.

These	breakthroughs	reflected	the	spirit	of	the	times:	the	Cold	War	and	the

confrontation	between	Marxism	and	liberalism—or,	depending	on	one’s	point	of	view

at	the	time,	between	utopian	communism	or	the	totalitarian	Gulag	on	the	one	hand

and	 liberalism	 or	 capitalist	 exploitation	 on	 the	 other.	 Foucault’s	 book	 challenged

these	 simplistic	 dichotomies	 by	 exposing	 the	 disciplinary	 functions	 of	 schools,

4

factories,	convents,	hospitals,	boarding	schools,	barracks,	and	prisons	in	nineteenth-

and	 twentieth-century	 liberal	 Europe.	 “The	 carceral	 archipelago,”	 Foucault	 wrote,

“transported	this	technique	from	the	penal	institution	to	the	entire	social	body”	(DP,

298).1	This	searing	critique	of	the	liberal	illusion	of	Western	societies	contributed	to

the	 success	 of	 Discipline	 and	 Punish.	 At	 a	 time	 when	 anti-communism	 remained

strong,	Foucault’s	book	offered	a	post-Marxist	critique	of	liberal	democracies.

Today,	the	political	landscape	is	entirely	different.	The	Cold	War	and	the	Soviet

Union	 are	 a	 distant	 memory.	 The	 Western	 discourse	 surrounding	 communism	 has

been	 replaced	 by	 talk	 of	 narcoterrorism,	 immigration	 invasion,	 and	 states	 of

emergency.	 Rehabilitation	 and	 the	 therapeutic	 paradigm	 of	 the	 early	 twentieth

century	 have	 given	 way	 to	 strict	 enforcement,	 zero	 tolerance,	 and	 paramilitary

policing.	And	with	their	demise,	Foucault’s	specific	model	of	disciplinary	power	at	the

heart	of	Discipline	and	Punish	has	lost	some	traction.	Discipline	is	no	longer	sufficient

to	understand	the	current	mechanisms	of	counterrevolution,	order	maintenance,	and

algorithmic	surveillance	in	the	expository	society	of	the	digital	age.

But	as	the	many	new	archives	and	resources	make	clear,	the	book’s	import	far

exceeds	the	specific	details	of	the	analysis	of	disciplinary	power	in	the	nineteenth	and

twentieth	 centuries.	 Discipline	 and	 Punish	 heralds	 instead	 a	 broader	 critical

framework	 to	 study	 new	 and	 emerging	 forms	 of	 governmentality—an	 essential

method	 to	 understand	 the	 circulation	 of	 power	 and	 the	 production	 of	 truth	 in

1 In a 1976 interview, Foucault refers to Solzhenitsyn and points out that he only used the term “carceral
archipelago”  once  (DE  II,  32).  A  note  added  by  the  editors  to  the  interview  in  1994  indicates  that  the
expression was “removed in subsequent editions” of Discipline and Punish (DE II, 32, n. *). This is not the
case. The expression appears three times in all editions of the book.

contemporary	 society.	 Foucault’s	 invention	 of	 panopticism	 was	 never	 meant	 to

merely	 describe	 Bentham’s	 architectural	 plans	 or	 to	 suggest	 that	 they	 were

implemented.	Instead,	it	was	an	homage	to	Bentham	to	capture	one	particular	mode

of	governing	people—a	“tribute	to	Bentham,”	as	Foucault	wrote	in	an	unpublished

draft	 of	 Discipline	 and	 Punish	 in	 the	 new	 archives	 at	 the	 Bibliothèque	 nationale	 de

France	 (BnF,	 box	 XLIX).	 There	 is	 a	 much	 broader	 philosophical,	 epistemological,

political,	historical,	and	methodological	import	to	the	book.	Today,	for	critical	thought

that	seeks	to	describe	contemporary	forms	of	power	in	relation	to	regimes	of	truth,

Discipline	and	Punish	provides	an	essential	companion,	just	as	Hobbes’	Leviathan	did

for	the	early	modern	era.

I.

New Insights into the Origins and Context of Discipline
and Punish

More	than	a	half	century	after	the	publication	of	Discipline	and	Punish,	three

important	sources	offer	new	and	fresh	perspectives	on	the	book:	first,	the	complete

publication	of	Michel	Foucault’s	thirteen	years	of	lectures	at	the	Collège	de	France,

particularly	those	delivered	immediately	prior	to	the	1975	publication	of	the	book;

second,	the	40,000	plus	pages	of	manuscripts,	reading	notes,	journals,	and	jottings	of

Foucault	deposited	at	the	Bibliothèque	nationale	de	France	in	2014;	and	third,	the

publication	 of	 manuscript,	 photographic,	 and	 audiovisual	 archives	 of	 Foucault’s

militancy	within	the	Prisons	Information	Group.

A History of Truth and Juridical Forms: Michel Foucault’s Early Collège de

1.
France Lectures

6

The	publication	of	Foucault’s	early	lectures	at	the	Collège	de	France	(Lectures

on	the	Will	to	Know,	1970-1971;	Penal	Theories	and	Institutions,	1971-1972;	and	The

Punitive	Society,	1972-1973)	reveals	that	Discipline	and	Punish	was	the	culmination

of	a	lengthy	trajectory	of	research,	established	in	Foucault’s	first	year	at	the	Collège

de	France,	focused	on	a	historical	analysis	of	juridical	forms	and	how	they	produce

effects	of	truth	(LWK,	2-5;	PTI,	229).

In	 his	 first	 set	 of	 lectures,	 Lectures	 on	 The	 Will	 to	 Know,	 Foucault	 began	 to

analyze	the	relationship	between	truth	and	juridical	forms.	He	first	studied	the	“test”

or	the	ordeal	as	a	mode	of	veridiction,	using	the	agonistic	battle	between	Antilochus

and	Menelaus	in	the	chariot	race	in	Book	XXIII	of	Homer’s	Illiad;	then,	the	“inquiry”

or	the	investigation	using	the	case	of	Sophocles’	Oedipus	Rex;	and	finally,	the	question

of	money	as	a	measure	of	truth.	From	his	very	first	lecture,	Foucault	undertook	an

analysis	 of	 measurement,	 testing,	 and	 investigation	 as	 forms	 of	 power-knowledge.

Alongside	his	lectures,	he	indicated	that	his	research	seminar	at	the	Collège	(distinct

from	 the	 main	 course)	 would	 focus	 on	 the	 production	 of	 truth	 in	 the	 context	 of

nineteenth-century	penality:	“The	precise	point	of	the	analysis	will	be	the	insertion

of	 a	 discourse	 claiming	 scientific	 status	 (medicine,	 psychiatry,	 psychopathology,

sociology)	within	a	system—the	penal	system—which	had	previously	been	entirely

prescriptive”	(LWK,	2).

The	following	year’s	lecture,	Penal	Theories	and	Institutions,	would	pursue	the

analysis	of	other	juridical	forms	and	contexts,	notably	that	of	the	inquiry	as	it	related

to	the	establishment	of	the	state	in	the	Middle	Ages	and	new	forms	of	social	control

in	seventeenth-century	France	(PTI,	20).	In	The	Punitive	Society	the	following	year,	in

7

1973,	 Foucault	 tackled,	 for	 the	 first	 time,	 the	 prison-form	 as	 a	 juridical	 and	 social

specificity,	and	directly	studied	penality	in	the	nineteenth	century.	He	proposed	an

outline	 of	 the	 regime	 of	 truth	 associated	 with	 imprisonment,	 confinement,	 and

penitentiaries,	as	a	political	and	legal	form	producing	truth	effects	and	as	a	metaphor

for	power	relations	throughout	nineteenth-century	society.	“Such	was	the	point	of	my

remarks,”	he	declared,	“the	prison	as	social	form,	that	is	to	say	as	form	according	to

which	 power	 is	 exercised	 within	 a	 society—the	 way	 in	 which	 power	 extracts	 the

knowledge	it	needs	in	order	to	be	exercised	and	the	form	in	which,	on	the	basis	of	this

knowledge,	it	distributes	orders,	prescriptions”	(PS,	227).

Foucault	set	out	the	complete	scope	of	his	research	project	in	his	lectures	at

the	Pontifical	Catholic	University	of	Rio	de	Janeiro	a	few	months	later,	in	May	1973:

to	study	measurement,	testing,	and	investigation	in	order	to	account	for	a	new	“form

of	 power-knowledge	 linked	 to	 the	 systems	 of	 control,	 exclusion,	 and	 punishment

characteristic	 of	 industrial	 societies”	 (PTI,	 230).	 That	 new	 legal	 form	 was	 the

“examination.”	Foucault	had	prefigured	this	already	in	his	handwritten	notes	for	his

last	 lecture	 on	 Penal	 Theories	 and	 Institutions,	 delivered	 on	 March	 8,	 1972:	 “The

analysis	 of	 other	 juridico-political	 matrices	 will	 bring	 to	 light	 another	 schema	 of

power-knowledge	 alongside	 those	 of	 the	 inquiry	 and	 measure.	 The	 new	 types	 of

penality,	control,	and	repression	in	the	eighteenth-nineteenth	century	reveal	the	form

of	the	examination:	examination	of	normality;	examination	of	level;	examination	of

morality;	examination	of	health	(mental	or	other)	of	individuals	or	groups.	A	surplus-

knowledge	 will	 be	 extracted	 from	 this	 whose	 effect	 will	 be	 the	 appearance	 of	 the

human	sciences”	(PTI,	215).

8

	This	 would	 lay	 the	 groundwork	 for	 Discipline	 and	 Punish	 in	 1975:	 a	 book

focused	on	the	regime	of	truth	associated	with	generalized	confinement.	In	light	of

his	first	courses	at	the	Collège	de	France,	the	book	can	now	be	understood	as	a	case

study	 of	 the	 emergence	 of	 the	 juridical	 form	 of	 the	 examination	 in	 the	 nineteenth

century,	 and	 of	 the	 corollary	 production	 of	 the	 scientific	 and	 juridical	 truth	 of	 the

modern	 subject	 in	 industrial	 society.	 The	 question	 at	 the	 center	 of	 Discipline	 and

Punish—why	 confinement?	 or	 more	 precisely:	 “Why	 did	 the	 physical	 exercise	 of

punishment	 (which	 is	 not	 torture)	 replace,	 with	 the	 prison	 that	 is	 its	 institutional

support,	 the	 social	 play	 of	 the	 signs	 of	 punishment	 and	 the	 prolix	 festival	 that

circulated	them?”	(DP,	131)—can	be	understood	in	this	light:	it	is	not	just	a	question

of	the	predominance	of	a	practice	or	institution	(of	imprisonment	or	the	prison)	but,

more	precisely,	of	the	production	of	knowledge	and	of	truth	throughout	the	whole	of

society.

Three	stages	punctuated	Foucault’s	research	process	leading	to	the	writing	of

Discipline	and	Punish:	first,	in	1972,	the	analysis	of	the	brutal	repression	of	the	Nu-

pieds	rebellion	in	Normandy	in	1639,	which	described	the	emergence	of	a	repressive

model	of	power	based	on	the	creation	of	a	state	judicial	apparatus;	second,	in	1973,

the	conceptualization	of	a	punitive	society	that	relied	on	disciplinary	techniques	to

produce	 docile	 individuals;	 and	 third	 and	 finally,	 the	 complete	 elaboration	 of	 the

“panoptic”	device,	which	formalized	the	prison	institution	and,	beyond	that,	power

itself.	In	light	of	the	early	Collège	de	France	lectures,	Discipline	and	Punish	can	thus	be

reread	today	as	a	case	study	of	the	production	of	legal	and	scientific	truth	about	the

9

modern	subject	in	industrial	society.	It	is	inscribed	within	a	longer	history	of	truth

and	demonstrates	what	Foucault	referred	to	as	the	“Power	of	Truth.”2

An Analysis of Modern Modes of Governing, Not Just a History of the

2.
Prison: Michel Foucault’s Manuscripts at the Bibliothèque nationale de France

Foucault’s	partner,	Daniel	Defert,	turned	over	tens	of	thousands	of	pages	of

unpublished	manuscripts,	reading	notes,	and	journals	to	the	Bibliothèque	nationale

de	France	in	2013,	and	those	archives	provide	further	insight	into	the	book.	In	one	of

the	archival	boxes,	boîte	XLIX,	there	is	an	unpublished	127-page	manuscript	entitled

“Version	primitive	de	Surveiller	et	punir”	(“Early	draft	of	Discipline	and	Punish,”	BnF,

box	 XLIX).	 It	 provides	 precious	 information	 on	 the	 role	 Foucault	 assigned	 to

Bentham’s	Panopticon.

Many	 historians	 have	 criticized	 the	 prominence	 Foucault	 attached	 to

Bentham’s	architectural	device	in	his	history	of	prison,	but	fail	to	properly	distinguish

between,	on	the	one	hand,	Bentham’s	detailed	design	for	prisons,	factories,	and	other

total	institutions	and,	on	the	other	hand,	the	metaphor	of	panoptic	power.	They	also

fail	to	distinguish	between	Bentham’s	specific	drawings	and	the	more	general	star-

shaped	 model	 referred	 to	 by	 Foucault	 as	 “panoptic,”	 which	 was	 used	 in	 the

construction	of	so	many	hospitals	and	prisons	(from	the	Petite	Roquette	in	Paris	to

Pentonville	Prison	in	London,	or	those	in	Mexico	City	and	the	Philippines).	As	a	result,

Foucault’s	 notion	 of	 panopticism	 has	 often	 been	 reduced	 to	 a	 mere	 architectural

innovation	related	to	the	prison,	the	hospital,	the	factory,	or	the	convent.	And	this	has

misled	 many	 historians	 into	 a	 futile	 debate	 over	 the	 number	 of	 prisons	 that	 were

actually	constructed	on	Bentham’s	model,	with	some	claiming	that	Foucault	got	it	all

wrong	because	there	were,	in	fact,	none.3

However,	the	manuscript	of	the	“Version	primitive”	demonstrates	that	the	idea

of	 panopticism	 was	 above	 all	 a	 metaphor	 for	 the	 way	 power	 might	 circulate

throughout	society.	The	draft	manuscript	reveals	that	Foucault’s	interest	was	much

broader	than	the	panoptic	prison	and	situated	at	a	far	more	abstract	level,	involving

the	harnessing	and	sequestration	of	time,	the	subjection	of	an	entire	life	to	the	cycles

of	industrial	production,	the	permanent	control	(direct	and	indirect)	of	each	moment

of	 existence—in	 short,	 the	 production	 and	 fabrication	 of	 relations	 of	 power	 in

modernity.	It	is	indeed	disciplinary	society	that	Foucault	analyzed	in	Discipline	and

Punish,	not	merely	penitentiary	confinement	or	the	history	of	the	prison.

Foucault	appropriated	the	metaphor	of	the	“Panopticon”	to	designate	this	new

mode	of	power	and	knowledge	in	homage	to	Bentham—not	to	suggest	that	Bentham’s

Panopticon	proliferated.	In	the	early	draft	of	Discipline	and	Punish,	Foucault	specified

his	reasoning:

If	we	call	“disciplinary”	the	mechanisms	of	spatial	distribution,	extraction	and
accumulation	of	time,	individualization	and	subjugation	of	bodies	through	a
system	of	hierarchical	gazes	and	writings,	then	let	us	pay	tribute	to	Bentham
and	 call	 “panoptic”	 a	 society	 where	 power	 is	 exercised	 through	 generalized
discipline.	 And	 let	 us	 say	 that	 at	 the	 turn	 of	 the	 eighteenth	 and	 nineteenth
centuries,	we	saw	emerge	clearly	these	panoptic	societies	of	which	Bentham
can	 be	 considered,	 depending	 on	 one’s	 point	 of	 view,	 as	 the	 prophet,	 the
witness,	the	analyst,	or	the	programmer.	(BnF,	box	XLIX,	draft,	p.	93)

3 The fact is, no prison was built based exactly on the plans of Bentham and his architect Willey Reveley,
and very few were built based on a layout of cells arranged around a central tower (notable exceptions include
Stateville  Penitentiary  in  Illinois,  the  Geneva  prison—demolished  in  1862—and  The  Round  House
Freemantle in Australia, designed by Reveley’s son, Henry Willey Reveley). See “The Panopticon,” U.C.L.

“Let	us	pay	tribute	to	Bentham”:	Foucault	named	nineteenth-century	society

“panoptic”	 as	 a	 metaphor	 to	 capture	 features	 of	 generalized	 discipline.	 “The

Panopticon,”	Foucault	emphasized	in	Discipline	and	Punish,	“must	be	understood	as	a

generalizable	model	of	functioning;	a	way	of	defining	power	relations	in	terms	of	the

everyday	 life	 of	 men”	 (DP,	 205).	 It	 synthesized	 the	 central	 features	 perfectly:

preserving	the	enclosure	of	the	dungeon	but	offering	“full	lighting	and	the	eyes	of	a

supervisor,”	 the	 trap	 of	 visibility;	 producing	 an	 internalization	 and	 perfection	 of

power	so	that	actual	exercise	becomes	unnecessary;	creating	a	living	laboratory,	"a

privileged	place	for	experiments	on	men”	(DP,	200,	201,	204).

The	metaphor	of	panopticism	would	allow	Foucault	to	go	far	beyond	regimes

of	punishment.	Drawing	on	the	writings	of	Nicolaus	Heinrich	Julius,	a	professor	and

prison	reformer	in	Berlin	who	“a	few	years	after	Bentham,”	as	Foucault	wrote,	“gave

this	[disciplinary]	society	its	birth	certificate”	(DP,	216),	Foucault	inverted	the	logic

of	 power	 in	 society:	 from	 the	 spectacle	 of	 the	 ancient	 amphitheater,	 where	 the

assembled	 masses	 would	 all	 gaze	 at	 a	 single	 gladiator,	 to	 the	 surveillance	 of	 the

panoptic	 prison,	 where	 a	 single	 guard	 (or	 no	 one)	 would	 watch	 the	 distributed

masses.	 “We	 are	 much	 less	 Greeks	 than	 we	 believe,”	 Foucault	 declared.	 “We	 are

neither	in	the	amphitheatre,	nor	on	the	stage,	but	in	the	panoptic	machine,	invested

by	 its	 effects	 of	 power,	 which	 we	 bring	 to	 ourselves	 since	 we	 are	 part	 of	 its

mechanism”	 (DP,	 217).	 Foucault’s	 word	 play—the	 reversal	 of	 the	 spectacle	 into

surveillance—was	undoubtedly	a	reference	to	Guy	Debord,	the	great	theorist	of	the

“society	of	the	spectacle”	(1994).	For	Debord,	like	Julius	before	him,	the	spectacle	was

not	 only	 an	 architectural	 form,	 but	 a	 way	 to	 understand	 the	 circulation	 of	 power

12

throughout	society.	And	just	as	Debord	had	described	a	society	of	spectacle,	Foucault

discovered	the	panoptic	society.

The	archives	at	the	Bibliothèque	nationale	de	France	also	contain	a	treasure

trove	of	lectures,	conferences,	and	manuscripts	representing	Foucault’s	philosophical

conversation	with	Nietzsche	(BnF,	box	LXV).	These	compose	four	sets	of	documents

which	have	now	been	published	in	French	under	the	title	Nietzsche:	Cours,	conférences

et	travaux	(2024).	These	works	all	attest	to	the	importance	of	Nietzsche’s	thought	to

Foucault	as	he	was	developing	his	research	program	on	penal	institutions	in	the	early

1970s.	In	a	course	on	Nietzsche	offered	during	the	1969-1970	academic	year	at	the

Centre	 universitaire	 expérimental	 de	 Vincennes,	 as	 well	 as	 in	 a	 conference	 entitled

“Knowledge	and	Desire”	given	at	SUNY	Buffalo	in	March	and	April	1970,	and	a	series

of	lectures	on	“Nietzsche	and	the	Problem	of	Truth”	delivered	at	McGill	University	in

Montreal	in	April	1971,	Foucault	engaged	in	a	sort	of	relay	race,	developing	a	whole

series	 of	 propositions	 on	 knowledge,	 truth,	 and	 truth-telling	 in	 conversation	 with

Nietzsche.	 At	 Vincennes,	 he	 introduced	 the	 terms	 the	 "will	 to	 know"	 and	 the

"emergence"	 of	 knowledge;	 then,	 at	 Buffalo,	 he	 added	 the	 terms	 the	 "invention	 of

knowledge,"	the	"fable	of	truth,"	and	the	"history	of	truth";	at	McGill,	he	would	then

up	the	ante	with	terms	like	the	"birth"	and	"invention"	of	truth,	as	well	as	the	"delay,"

"event,"	and	finally	the	"end"	of	truth,	with	its	"destruction"	and	"disappearance"	(N,

371-377).	All	these	concepts	became	fundamental	not	only	to	his	article	"Nietzsche,

Genealogy,	 History"	 (1971)	 and	 the	 development	 of	 the	 genealogical	 method	 he

perfected	in	Discipline	and	Punish	in	1975,	but	also	to	his	future	work	on	truth-telling,

parrêsia,	and	the	history	of	truth	in	the	1980s.

13

The	 lectures	 and	 conferences	 on	 Nietzsche	 in	 the	 early	 1970s,	 all	 of	 which

occurred	 as	 he	 was	 writing	 his	 book	 on	 prisons,	 reflect	 several	 important	 shifts	 in

Foucault’s	thought.	First,	epistemological:	Foucault's	work	on	Nietzsche	led	him	to

develop	his	own	theses	on	knowledge-power	that	would	motivate	the	history	of	truth

that	he	traced	in	the	legal	and	historical	spheres.	Second,	political:	The	argument	that

knowledge	and	even	truth	are	invented	implies	that	truth	is	the	result	of	a	struggle,

an	imposition,	a	fight,	a	conflict.	These	ideas	would	shape	Foucault’s	understanding

of	social	relations	on	the	matrix	of	civil	war.	The	source	of	all	this	is	his	Nietzschean

analysis	 of	 knowledge	 and	 truth.	 Third,	 practical:	 for	 Foucault,	 the	 practice	 of	 the

G.I.P.	was	a	philosophical	act	linked	to	his	reading	of	Nietzsche.	Current	events	are

what	 interested	 Foucault,	 just	 like	 Nietzsche.	 They	 are	 what	 Nietzsche	 called	 the

untimely.	Foucault	had	this	in	common	with	Nietzsche,	as	he	said	himself	(DE	I,	1302).

Foucault’s	reading	of	Nietzsche	was	a	political	commitment.

In	addition,	the	new	archives	contain	a	series	of	reading	notes	that	Foucault

took	 from	 the	 early	 1970s	 (BnF,	 boxes	 I	 and	 II).	 Organized	 thematically,	 Foucault

would	give	each	a	title,	and	then	take	notes,	or	copy	quotations,	or	make	comments

about	books	or	articles,	which	were	generally	referenced	at	the	bottom	of	the	page.

These	notes	document	that	Foucault	conducted	an	extensive	historical	investigation,

from	 the	 Roman	 Empire	 to	 the	 nineteenth	 century,	 into	 judicial	 institutions,

procedures,	and	punishments.

Read	 in	 conjunction	 with	 Penal	 Theories	 and	 Institutions,	 the	 reading	 notes

allow	us	to	completely	revisit	the	way	Foucault	approached	law,	and	more	specifically

criminal	 law.	 Discipline	 and	 Punish	 was	 the	 result	 of	 a	 systematic	 study	 of	 legal

14

practices	and	institutions	and,	as	such,	can	be	reread	as	a	history	of	law	(PTI,	265).

Foucault	develops	there	a	political	theory	of	criminal	law,	emphasizing	that	“penality

is	 political	 from	 top	 to	 bottom”	 (PTI,	 190).	 Discipline	 and	 Punish	 completes	 the

political	theory:	a	new	micro-physics	of	power	gradually	overflows	classical	criminal

law	and	causes	it	to	lose	its	bearings,	inspiring	disciplinary	punishments.	As	Foucault

writes	in	his	draft	manuscript:	“the	great	[tension]	in	the	history	of	punishment	is

produced	when	punishment	itself	takes	the	form	of	this	coercion,	that	is,	the	punitive

appropriation	of	time,	submission	to	discipline,	and	the	differentiation	of	individuals

in	relation	to	this	subjugation.	In	other	words,	when	this	new	physics	of	power,	with

its	 individualizing	 effects,	 imposed	 itself,	 or	 rather	 replaced	 a	 system	 of	 criminal

justice	governed	by	the	physics	of	sovereignty”	(BnF,	box	XLIX,	127).

Finally,	 the	 archives	 include	 a	 series	 of	 notebooks	 that	 constitute	 what	 one

might	 call	 Foucault’s	 “Intellectual	 Journal”	 and	 shed	 light	 on	 the	 writing	 process

behind	 Discipline	 and	 Punish.4	For	 example,	 they	 include	 Foucault’s	 heated	 debate

with	Hobbes,	already	evident	in	the	1973	course	The	Punitive	Society,	which	would

erupt	again,	immediately	after	the	book’s	publication,	in	the	1976	lectures	“Society

Must	Be	Defended.”

In	December	1972,	Foucault	had	written	to	his	partner,	Daniel	Defert,	that	he

was	 beginning	 to	 analyze	 power	 relations	 based	 on	 “the	 most	 maligned	 of	 wars:

neither	Hobbes,	nor	Clausewitz,	nor	class	struggle,	but	civil	war”	(DE	I,	57).	Foucault’s

notebooks	confirm	the	salience	of	this	statement.	They	contain	numerous	references

4  In  BnF,  box  XCI,  notebook  11  contains  important  notes  for  the  1972  course,  Penal  Theories  and
Institutions; and notebooks 12, 14, and 16 for Discipline and Punish.

15

to	 the	 “importance”	 of	 Hobbes,” 5 	including	 one	 that	 is	 particularly	 revealing.	 On

December	24,	1972,	Foucault	wrote:	“At	the	center,	place	the	most	reviled	of	wars:

civil	war.	This	is	not	war	pure	and	simple,	monstrously	misplaced	[…].	It	is	not	the

struggle	 of	 all	 against	 all;	 it	 is	 the	 struggle	 of	 some	 against	 some.	 It	 is	 not	 what

precedes	the	‘social	contract’	and	the	collective	will;	on	the	contrary,	it	is	the	effect	of

a	will	[…].	Civil	war	takes	place	everywhere.”6	On	December	29,	he	continues:	“Civil

war	is	neither	the	prolongation	of	the	war	of	all	against	all	beyond	the	social	contract.

[…]	 Do	 not	 look	 for	 the	 model	 in	 Hobbes	 or	 Clausewitz.	 […]	 Civil	 war	 is	 not	 class

struggle.”7

These	counter-proposals	would	form	the	theoretical	pillars	of	Discipline	and

Punish:	as	against	the	Hobbesian	conception	of	politics	as	the	establishment	of	a	state

of	peace,	Foucault	places	civil	war	at	the	heart	of	political	relations;	as	against	the

Clausewitzian	conception	of	war,	he	reimagines	politics	as	its	continuation;	and	as

against	 a	 Marxist	 conception	 of	 the	 binary	 structure	 of	 class	 conflict	 (proletariat

versus	bourgeoisie),	he	views	civil	war	as	a	tactical	entanglement	of	alliances	between

multiple	groups.

A Political Engagement and Militant Agenda: The G.I.P. Archive

New	archives	relating	to	Foucault’s	political	activism	during	the	early	1970s

16

The	 publication	 of	 Discipline	 and	 Punish	 crowned	 one	 of	 the	 most	 active

periods	of	Foucault’s	militant	life,	during	a	period	that	Foucault	himself	experienced

as	 highly	 repressive	 in	 France.	 “[T]oday,	 for	 reasons	 I	 do	 not	 really	 understand,”

Foucault	 pointed	 out,	 “we	 are	 returning	 to	 a	 sort	 of	 general,	 undifferentiated

confinement”	(DE	I,	1166-1167).	It	was	also	a	period	marked	by	violent	prison	revolts

in	France,	in	the	United	States,	and	elsewhere.	Foucault	threw	himself	into	the	fray,

co-founding,	organizing,	and	launching	in	February	1971	the	Groupe	d’information	sur

les	prisons	alongside	Jean-Marie	Domenach,	Pierre	Vidal-Naquet,	Daniel	Defert,	Gilles

Deleuze,	Jean	Genet,	Danielle	Rancière,	Jacques	Donzelot,	and	others.

	Through	the	prism	of	new	archives	on	the	G.I.P.,	Foucault’s	book	can	be	reread

today	as	a	theoretical	and	practical	intervention,	intended	to	be	used	by	educators,

prisoners,	lawyers,	judges,	and	other	engaged	participants.	The	G.I.P.	archive	reveals

that	Foucault	gave	unreserved	support	to	the	prisoners	who	had	revolted	in	prisons

and	jails	across	France	in	1971-1972.	After	the	revolt	at	Toul,	on	5	January	1972,	in	a

joint	press	conference	of	the	G.I.P.	and	the	Comité	Vérité	Toul,	Foucault	declared	that

“what	took	place	at	Toul	is	the	start	of	a	new	process:	the	first	phase	of	a	political

struggle	directed	against	the	entire	penitentiary	system	by	the	social	strata	that	is	its

primary	victim”	(La	Révolte	de	la	prison	de	Nancy,	19).	Two	weeks	later,	on	January

18,	1972,	with	Deleuze,	Sartre,	and	about	forty	others	by	his	side,	Foucault	organized

a	 sit-in	 at	 the	 Ministry	 of	 Justice	 (DE	 I,	 54).	 He	 engaged	 in	 demonstrations,	 press

conferences,inquiries,	and	published	pamphlets	with	the	G.I.P.,	reports	of	the	new

Agence	de	Presse	Libération/APL,	and	columns	in	Le	Monde	and	in	other	newspapers.

17

These	political	engagements	resonate	in	the	book.	Discipline	and	Punish	marks

a	break	with	Foucault’s	prior	analyses—notably	those	that	deployed	the	notions	of

repression,	 exclusion,	 or	 transgression—and	 a	 turn	 instead	 to	 the	 productive

functions	of	penality.	Foucault	begins	to	move	in	this	direction	in	April	1972,	directly

after	 he	 visits	 Attica	 Prison,	 an	 experience	 which	 he	 describes	 as	 “overwhelming”

(Simon	1991,	26).	Upset	by	the	visit,	Foucault	begins	an	analytical	transition	towards

the	“positive	functions”	of	the	penal	system:	“the	question	that	I	ask	myself	now	is	the

reverse,”	he	explains.	“The	problem	is,	then,	to	find	out	what	role	capitalist	society

has	its	penal	system	play,	what	is	the	aim	that	is	sought,	and	what	effects	are	produced

by	 all	 these	 procedures	 for	 punishment	 and	 exclusion.	 What	 is	 their	 place	 in	 the

economic	 process,	 what	 is	 their	 importance	 in	 the	 maintenance	 and	 exercise	 of

power?	What	is	their	role	in	the	class	struggle?”	(Simon	1991,	28).	It	is	precisely	this

turn	 to	 the	 positive	 functions	 of	 penality	 that	 will	 lead	 Foucault	 to	 an	 analysis	 of

political	economy—not	only	in	the	sense	of	that	“‘political	economy’	of	the	body”	(DP,

25)	that	would	certainly	motivate	Discipline	and	Punish,	but	more	tradically,	in	the

manner	of	a	classical	study	of	political	economy.

Foucault	was	fully	aware	of	this	debt.	He	had	already	acknowledged	it	at	the

time,	 in	 Discipline	 and	 Punish.	 “That	 punishment	 in	 general	 and	 the	 prison	 in

particular	belong	to	a	political	technology	of	the	body	is	a	lesson	that	I	have	learnt	not

so	 much	 from	 history	 as	 from	 the	 present.	 In	 recent	 years,	 prison	 revolts	 have

occurred	throughout	the	world”	(DP,	30).	The	trove	of	new	archives	from	the	G.I.P.

confirms	and	contextualizes	this	acknowledgement.

18

In	fact,	Foucault’s	political	commitments	drove	him	to	a	sense	of	indignation,

almost	anger,	against	those	who	misjudged	the	stakes	of	the	political	struggle—of	the

“battle	at	hand.”	There	were	intimations	of	this	in	the	closing	line	of	Discipline	and

Punish,	 where	 Foucault	 referred	 to	 the	 “roar	 of	 battle”	 (DP,	 308),	 and	 in	 the

introductory	 chapter,	 where	 he	 discusses	 how	 the	 study	 of	 the	 micro-physics	 of

power	must	take	as	it	model	“a	perpetual	battle	rather	than	a	contract	regulating	a

transaction	or	the	conquest	of	a	territory”	(DP,	26).	But	it	all	comes	alive	in	the	G.I.P.

archive	and	the	Collège	de	France	lectures.	It	echoes	loudly,	for	instance,	in	the	1973

lecture	on	The	Punitive	Society:

We	 are	 forever	 in	 the	 habit	 of	 speaking	 of	 the	 “stupidity”	 of	 the
bourgeoisie.	 I	 wonder	 whether	 the	 theme	 of	 the	 stupid	 bourgeois	 is	 not	 a
theme	 for	 intellectuals:	 those	 who	 imagine	 that	 merchants	 are	 narrow-
minded,	people	with	money	are	mulish,	and	those	with	power	are	blind.	Safe
from	 this	 belief,	 moreover,	 the	 bourgeoisie	 is	 remarkably	 intelligent.	 The
lucidity	 and	 intelligence	 of	 this	 class,	 which	 has	 conquered	 and	 kept	 power
under	conditions	we	know,	produce	many	effects	of	stupidity	and	blindness,
but	 where,	 if	 not	 precisely	 in	 the	 stratum	 of	 intellectuals?	 We	 may	 define
intellectuals	as	those	on	whom	the	intelligence	of	the	bourgeoisie	produces	an
effect	of	blindness	and	stupidity.	(PS,	164-165)

And	Foucault	adds,	in	the	margin	of	his	manuscript:	“Those	who	deny	this	are	public

entertainers.	They	fail	to	recognize	the	seriousness	of	the	struggle”	(PS,	165	n.*).

His	indignation	at	the	conditions	of	the	prison	fostered	a	militancy,	reflected

well	in	his	lectures	a	few	months	later	at	Rio	De	Janeiro	on	“Truth	and	Juridical	Forms.”

There,	Foucault	links	the	theme	of	the	blindness	of	intellectuals	directly	to	what	he

calls	the	great	Western	myth	of	the	antinomy	of	knowledge	and	power:	“This	great

myth	 needs	 to	 be	 scrapped,”	 Foucault	 declares	 in	 May	 1973.	 “It	 is	 this	 myth	 that

Nietzsche	 began	 to	 demolish	 by	 showing	 […]	 that,	 behind	 all	 knowledge-savoir,

19

behind	 all	 knowledge-connaissance,	 what	 is	 at	 stake	 is	 a	 power	 struggle.	 Political

power	is	not	absent	from	knowledge,	it	is	interwoven	with	it”	(EW	3,	32).	These	are

strong	 words—“scrapped,”	 “demolish.”	 And	 to	 dismantle	 that	 great	 Western	 myth,

Foucault	 set	 out	 in	 Discipline	 and	 Punish	 to	 expose	 the	 production	 of	 a	 regime	 of

truth—prison-form,	 wage-form—at	 the	 heart	 of	 nineteenth-century	 disciplinary

society.

Vice	versa,	Foucault’s	intellectual	enterprise	shaped	his	activism.	The	G.I.P.’s

strategy	of	giving	prisoners	a	voice	rather	than	theorizing	about	their	condition	is	a

direct	product	of	Foucault’s	analysis	in	The	History	of	Madness	and	The	Archaeology

of	Knowledge.	As	Foucault	confided	to	Daniel	Defert,	his	involvement	in	the	G.I.P.	“was

in	a	straight	line	with	The	History	of	Madness”	(Defert	2014,	56).	The	commitment	and

the	 book,	 Discipline	 and	 Punish,	 together,	 became	 a	 philosophical	 act	 intended	 to

address	 educators,	 prisoners,	 and	 magistrates	 alike,	 and	 which	 ultimately	 led

Foucault	to	reject	the	distinction	between	political	prisoners	and	common	criminals

(DE	I,	1072;	Defert	2014,	59).	As	Foucault	declared	in	an	interview	at	the	time,	“If	I

concern	 myself	 with	 the	 G.I.P.,	 it	 is	 precisely	 because	 I	 prefer	 effective	 work	 to

university	chattering	and	scribbling	books.	To	write	today	a	sequel	to	my	Histoire	de

la	folie	[…]	has	no	interest	for	me.	On	the	other	hand,	a	concrete	political	action	in

favor	of	prisoners	seems	to	me	charged	with	meaning”	(DE	I,	1169).

II.

A Critical Theory of Modes of Governing

20

Discipline	 and	 Punish	 opened	 where	 Hobbes	 ended—with	 the	 spectacular

display	of	sovereign	power—in	order	to	announce	a	new	paradigm	to	study	modes	of

governing	 marked	 by	 concepts	 like	 knowledge-power,	 subjectivation,	 power

relations,	 and,	 more	 broadly,	 governmentality.	 Although	 the	 book	 abruptly

interrupted	 its	 story	 in	 January	 1840,	 with	 the	 official	 opening	 of	 Mettray,	 the

infamous	penal	colony	for	youthful	delinquents	where	Jean	Genet	would	find	himself

incarcerated	a	century	later,	Discipline	and	Punish	offered	a	new	analytic	framework

to	decipher	our	most	immediate	present.

The	contrast	to	Hobbes’s	Leviathan	is	instructive.	The	theoretical	opposition

is	 head-on.	 Hobbes	 had	 conceptualized	 the	 modern	 political	 theory	 of	 sovereignty.

Starting	from	a	positivist	methodology,	Hobbes	conceived	of	power	as	a	substance

that	one	possesses.	When	everyone	in	society	agrees	to	divest	(most	of)	their	power

to	a	third-party,	a	centralized	authority,	the	Commonwealth	is	formed	and	becomes

the	concentrated	locus	of	power.	For	Foucault,	by	contrast,	power	is	neither	located

in	 a	 state,	 nor	 detained	 by	 a	 social	 class,	 nor	 subordinated	 to	 an	 economic

infrastructure.	 It	 is	 exercised	 and	 circulates.	 It	 does	 more	 than	 subjugate.	 It	 produces

subjects,	it	shapes	bodies.	In	this	sense,	in	the	nineteenth	century,	disciplinary	power

was	a	constituent	element	of	capitalism,	not	just	a	pure	instrument	of	coercion,	which

implies	its	presence	throughout	the	entire	social	fabric.	Foucault	abandons	the	modern

schemas	 for	 analyzing	 power—appropriation,	 localization,	 subordination,	 and

ideology	(PS,	227-237;	DP	26-27).	He	mounts	a	frontal	assault	on	the	Hobbesian	thesis

that	the	war	of	all	against	all	will	end	with	the	establishment	of	public	order.	He	re-

inserts	the	notion	of	civil	war	within	the	Hobbesian	commonwealth.	Civil	war	does

21

not	plunge	society	back	into	a	state	of	nature,	but	instead	constitutes	the	social.	Power

relations	must	therefore	be	systematically	described	through	the	prism	of	permanent

struggle,	 a	 silent	 but	 continuous	 war	 (PS,	 31).	 This	 explains	 the	 closing	 sentence	 of

Discipline	and	Punish	and	the	reference	to	the	“roar	of	battle”	(DP,	308).	It	is	necessary,

as	Foucault	stated	on	January	10,	1973,	to	“reject	the	image	Hobbes	[proposed]	in	which,

with	the	appearance	of	the	exercise	of	sovereign	[power],	war	is	expelled	from	[the

sovereign	power’s]	space”	(PS,	32).

Discipline	and	Punish	deploys	a	new	philosophical	method—critical	genealogy.

The	emergence	of	the	prison	as	a	major,	if	not	exclusive,	form	of	punishment	cannot

be	 deduced	 from	 the	 philosophical	 programs	 developed	 by	 the	 reformers	 of	 the

Enlightenment.	 The	 latter	 excluded	 the	 prison	 as	 a	 universal	 remedy	 (PS,	 253).	 As

early	 as	 1973,	 Foucault	 pointed	 to	 a	 complete	 “heterogeneity”	 (PS,	 89):	 “prison

practice	was	not	implied	in	penal	theory.	It	arose	elsewhere	and	was	formed	for	other

reasons”	 (PS,	 256).	 It	 was	 therefore	 necessary	 to	 look	 elsewhere,	 not	 using	 the

archaeological	 method	 that	 Foucault	 had	 perfected	 during	 the	 1960s,	 but	 using

another	philosophical	method.

The	seeds	of	this	other	method	can	be	found	in	his	early	lectures	at	the	Collège

de	 France	 and	 in	 his	 “intellectual	 journal,”	 in	 which	 Foucault	 notes	 on	 February	 2,

1973:	 “Archeology:	 testing	 derivations	 by	 identifying	 limits,	 discontinuities,	 and

breaks.	 Genealogy:	 analyzing	 the	 couplings,	 grafts,	 transfers,	 and	 subjugations	 that

produce,	at	a	given	moment,	an	event,	an	emergence”	(BnF,	box	XCII,	notebook	14,	p.

2).	Foucault’s	lecture	of	February	28,	1973	clearly	implements	this	new	method	with

22

the	analysis	of	the	Quakers	and	other	English	dissidents,	who	introduce	the	principle

of	penitence	at	the	heart	of	the	punitive	process.	Penitence	will	ripple	through	to	the

privileged	 classes	 at	 the	 beginning	 of	 the	 nineteenth	 century	 as	 they	 begin	 to

reprimand	the	popular	classes	for	their	“moral	failings”—their	laziness,	tardiness	at

work,	and	“debauchery”	(PS,	164).	Whereupon,	the	more	privileged	can	order	their

workers	to	“Go	and	do	penance”	(PS,	156,	n.	†).	This	is	where	Foucault’s	genealogy

truly	began,	and	it	is	what	would	lead	him	to	understand	the	prison	system	as	an	effect

of	 disciplinary	 power	 woven	 into	 the	 meticulous	 industrial	 regulations	 of

schools,	 barracks,	 and	 factories,	 rather	 than	 as	 the	 product	 of	 a	 theoretical-legal

revolution.

The	conception	of	power	that	emerges	is	then	linked	to	a	regime	of	truth.	In

his	lectures	in	Rio,	Foucault	had	already	attacked	what	he	called	the	great	Western

myth	 of	 the	 antinomy	 of	 knowledge	 and	 power.	 In	 Discipline	 and	 Punish,	 the

articulation	of	knowledge	and	power	unfolds	through	a	whole	series	of	disciplinary

techniques	that	are	themselves	linked	to	an	apparatus	of	economic	production.	The

revolutions	 that	 made	 the	 accumulation	 of	 capital	 possible	 during	 the	 nineteenth

century	 are	 inextricably	 linked	 to	 the	 production	 of	 the	 docile	 worker.	 The

mechanisms	 of	 capital	 accumulation	 presuppose	 “methods	 for	 administering	 the

accumulation	 of	 men”	 (DP,	 220).	 This	 conception	 stands	 in	 stark	 contrast	 to	 the

concept	 of	 ideology:	 delinquency,	 like	 madness	 or	 sexuality,	 are	 not	 “ideological

products	to	be	dispelled	in	the	[light]	of	reason	finally	having	reached	its	zenith”	(BB,

19).	These	categories	constitute	instead	a	point	of	crystallization	and	justification	for

23

a	series	of	effective	practices	and	discourses,	which	are	both	supported	by	and	reveal

effects	of	reality,	without	having	any	real	existence.

Marx’s	theory	of	capital	accumulation,	on	Foucault’s	reading,	depends	on	these

disciplinary	 techniques	 (that	 are	 themselves	 intimately	 connected	 with	 capitalist

production)	 to	 shape	 bodies	 and	 render	 workers	 docile.	 Foucault	 develops	 this

insight	in	Discipline	and	Punish	where,	specifically	citing	Marx’s	Capital	(Vol.	I,	Chap.

XIII),	he	argues	that	the	economic	revolutions	that	made	possible	the	accumulation	of

capital	during	the	nineteenth	century	cannot	be	separated	from	the	methods	for	the

production	of	these	docile	bodies—methods	which	replaced	“the	traditional,	ritual,

costly,	violent	forms	of	power,	which	soon	fell	into	disuse	and	were	superseded	by	a

subtle,	 calculated	 technology	 of	 subjection”	 (DP,	 221).	 Foucault	 writes:	 “the	 two

processes—the	 accumulation	 of	 men	 and	 the	 accumulation	 of	 capital—cannot	 be

separated	 […]	 the	 technological	 mutations	 of	 the	 apparatus	 of	 production,	 the

division	 of	 labour	 and	 the	 elaboration	 of	 the	 disciplinary	 techniques	 sustained	 an

ensemble	of	very	close	relations”	(DP,	221).

	Finally,	 the	 analysis	 of	 docile	 bodies	 then	 inaugurates	 a	 new	 conception	 of

subjectivity.	The	subject	becomes	a	point	of	articulation	for	the	mechanisms	of	power.

Foucault	regretted	not	having	given	this	dimension	its	full	importance	in	this	book.	In

1984,	looking	back,	he	urged	that	his	later	work	on	subjectivity	be	reintegrated	back

into	the	study	of	prisons,	power,	and	regimes	of	truth	(CT,	8-9).	These	are	themes	that

he	 had	 begun	 to	 develop,	 in	 the	 context	 of	 punishment	 and	 penality,	 in	 his	 1981

Louvain	 lectures	 on	 the	 functions	 of	 confession	 in	 criminal	 justice,	 Wrong-Doing,

Truth-Telling—in	 which	 he	 would	 return	 full	 circle	 to	 the	 chariot	 race	 between

24

Antilochus	 and	 Menelaus	 in	 the	 Iliad	 and	 to	 Sophocles’	 Oedipus	 Rex,	 where	 he	 had

started	his	study	of	truth	and	juridical	forms	his	first	year	at	the	Collège	de	France.

III.

Looking Forward with and beyond Discipline and Punish

Naturally,	 the	 controversies	 surrounding	 Discipline	 and	 Punish	 have	 not

subsided.	Given	that	Foucault’s	book	is	a	necessary	reference	in	any	contemporary

research	on	the	prison,	new	studies	routinely	criticize	it,	most	often	for	misleading

the	reader	about	the	history	of	the	prison	(Abolafia	2024;	Gopnik	2025;	Larsen	and

Letteney	 2025;	 Folch	 forthcoming).	 As	 we	 have	 seen,	 though,	 and	 as	 the	 new

resources	make	plain,	Discipline	and	Punish	was	never	intended	to	be	a	“history”	of	the

prison,	but	instead	a	critical	genealogy	of	a	mode	of	governing	in	modern	times.

Adam	Gopnik	seizes	on	the	most	recent	controversies,	in	a	recent	bok	review

in	the	New	Yorker,	to	advance	a	humanist,	reformist	agenda	(2025).	He	argues	that

Foucault’s	way	of	describing	different	siloed	historical	periods—what	Foucault	called

epistemes	 and	 Gopnik	 describes	 as	 a	 Nietzschean	 series	 of	 inhumanities	 (from

torturous	 corporal	 punishments	 to	 disciplinary	 techniques)—is	 detrimental	 to	 the

learning	process	that	would	allow	us	to	improve,	in	conversation	with	Antiquity	and

the	Medieval	Age.	Gopnik	urges	more	exchange	with	the	ancients—what	he	dubs	a

“dialogue	of	the	dead”—to	allow	for	“a	conversation	among	the	living”	(Gopnik	2025,

61).	We	should	learn	from	history,	in	effect,	rather	than	repeat	it.

But	as	we	saw	earlier,	history	intervenes	in	yet	another	way.	The	historical

context	shapes	our	reception	of	books	and	their	surrounding	controversies.	Discipline

25

and	Punish	had	such	resonance	because	it	burst	on	the	scene	at	the	height	of	the	Cold

War.

The	 question	 this	 raises	 is:	 What	 are	 the	 political	 stakes	 in	 undermining

Foucault’s	 genealogical	 account	 right	 now,	 today,	 in	 the	 age	 of	 racialized	 mass

incarceration—at	a	time	when	more	than	2	million	people	in	the	United	States	are

behind	bars,	predominantly	young	persons	of	color?	A	time	when,	just	a	few	years

ago,	a	full	one	percent	of	the	adult	population	was	incarcerated	in	the	U.S.?

What	are	the	political	implications	of	a	narrative	of	continuity	at	the	present

moment?	 All	 historical	 scholarship—and	 genealogical	 work	 as	 well—is	 always	 a

matter	of	continuities	and	differences.	What	work	does	it	do	to	stress	the	continuities

today?

Gopnik	 suggests	 that	 Foucault’s	 philosophical	 approach—the	 genealogical

method,	 the	 epistemes,	 the	 historical	 periodizations—makes	 “even	 our	 efforts	 at

reform	 begin	 to	 feel	 like	 the	 latest	 round	 in	 an	 unwinnable,	 ageless	 struggle	 with

power”	(2025,	61).	But	that	is,	of	course,	Angela	Davis’s	point,	and	that	of	many	other

abolitionists	today:	the	reform	of	the	prison	has	always	been	part	of	the	program	that

produces	new	prisons,	jails,	and	now	ICE	detention	facilities.	Reforming	the	prison

means	breathing	new	life	into	the	institution.

This	is	precisely	how	Davis	opened	her	abolitionist	book,	Are	Prisons	Obsolete?,

emphasizing:	“It	is	ironic	that	the	prison	itself	was	a	product	of	concerted	efforts	by

reformers	to	create	a	better	system	of	punishment.	If	the	words	‘prison	reform’	so

easily	 slip	 from	 our	 lips,	 it	 is	 because	 ‘prison’	 and	 ‘reform’	 have	 been	 inextricably

linked	since	the	beginning	of	the	use	of	imprisonment	as	the	main	means	of	punishing

26

those	who	violate	social	norms”	(Davis	2003,	40).	Davis	in	fact	used,	as	the	epigraph

to	 her	 discussion,	 the	 specific	 passage	 from	 Discipline	 and	 Punish	 where	 Foucault

wrote	about	prison	reform:

One	should	recall	that	the	movement	for	reforming	the	prisons,	for
controlling	their	functioning	is	not	a	recent	phenomenon.	It	does	not
even	 seem	 to	 have	 originated	 in	 a	 recognition	 of	 failure.	 Prison
“reform”	 is	 virtually	 contemporary	 with	 the	 prison	 itself:	 it
constitutes,	as	it	were,	its	programme.	(Davis	2003,	40,	quoting	DP
234)

Reform	of	the	prison	constitutes	the	very	program	of	the	prison.	In	Discipline

and	Punish,	Foucault	went	to	lengths	to	demonstrate	that	prison	reform	plays	right

into	the	possibility	of	its	continued	existence	and	functioning.	The	prison,	as	Foucault

demonstrated,	is	an	institution	in	constant	need	of	reform	that	thrives	and	survives

precisely	because	of	reformist	discourse.

In	other	contexts,	contemporary	societies	have	mostly	overcome,	not	simply

reformed,	inhuman	practices	that	were	equally	prevalent	throughout	history—from

the	ancients	to	the	moderns—such	as	slavery	or	interrogational	torture.	This	is	no

time	for	backsliding	on	the	prison.	It	is	important	to	not	let	our	love	of	the	ancients

get	 in	 the	 way	 of	 making	 a	 more	 radical	 break	 in	 history.	 In	 these	 times	 of	 mass

detention	and	deportations,	extrajudicial	executions,	and	the	rise	of	extreme	right-

wing	politics,	it	is	especially	important	to	look	forward,	not	backwards	and	strive	for

a	new	episteme.	That,	I	take	it,	is	the	real	political	stakes	of	these	renewed	debates

over	Foucault.

Rather	than	looking	back,	I	think	we	need	to	look	forward.	Today,	we	face	a

very	different	political	situation	than	Foucault	did.	We	live	in	a	time	of	warehousing

27

of	prison	populations,	zero	tolerance,	algorithmic	surveillance,	and	a	rise	of	the	global

far-Right.	 Foucault’s	 model	 of	 nineteenth-century	 disciplinary	 power	 is	 no	 longer

sufficient	 to	 understand	 the	 mounting	 counterrevolution.	 That	 form—discipline,

panopticism—may	no	longer	be	dominant	today.	In	the	digital	age,	in	our	expository

society,	power	circulates	differently.	It	circulates	through	our	desire	and	lust,	rather

than	the	internalization	of	disciplinary	techniques.

But	 what	 Discipline	 and	 Punish	 teaches	 us	 is	 a	 method	 for	 analyzing	 power

relations,	 knowledge-power,	 and	 forms	 of	 governmentality.	 And	 that	 method,

radically	different	than	the	modern	political	theory	of	Hobbes,	has	opened	a	whole

new	way	of	thinking	and	being.

What	 we	 need	 now,	 more	 so	 than	 a	 return	 to	 the	 Greeks	 and	 Romans,	 is	 to

draw	on	Foucault’s	philosophical	method	to	properly	analyze	how	power	circulates

in	 society	 today—in	 order	 to	 find	 ways	 to	 resist	 new	 forms	 of	 inhumanity	 and	 to

articulate	new	paradigms	of	cooperation.
