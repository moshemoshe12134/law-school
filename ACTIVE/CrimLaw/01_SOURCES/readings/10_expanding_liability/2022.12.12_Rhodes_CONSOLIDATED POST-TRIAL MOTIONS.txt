CONSOLIDATED POST-TRIAL MOTIONS OF DEFENDANT RHODES
PURSUANT TO F.R.Cr.P. 29 & 33
COMES NOW, the Defendant, ELMER STEWART RHODES, by and through his
attorneys, JAMES LEE BRIGHT and PHILLIP LINDER, and hereby moves for judgment of
acquittal pursuant to F.R.C.P. 29(c) and for a new trial pursuant to F.R.C.P. 33, and in support
thereof sets forth the preliminary grounds as to these Motions as follows:
On November 29, 2022 the Defendant was found guilty by a jury of Seditious Conspiracy
(Count 1), Obstruction of an Official Proceeding (Count 3) and Tampering with Documents or
Proceedings (Count 7). ECF No. 411. The Defendant challenges his convictions as to these
counts on the grounds set forth below and as will be set forth in a substantive memorandum,
which the Court has advised is due on or before December 23, 2022.
I. The verdict was unsupported by legally sufficient evidence to sustain the
convictions beyond a reasonable doubt.
The Defendant submits that the verdict as to all counts was unsupported by adequate
evidence to sustain his convictions to the standard of beyond a reasonable doubt.

II. The verdict was against the weight of the evidence.
The Defendant submits that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence adduced.
III. Reassertion of grounds previously placed on the record.
The Defendant hereby reasserts each and every ground previously set forth in all defense
motions during trial and trial objections, including but not limited to Defendant’s oral and
written motions for judgment of acquittal.
IV. Legal Standard.
Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33, the Court “may vacate any judgment and
grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.” Pursuant to Rule 33(a): "[T]he evidence
must preponderate heavily against the verdict, such that it would be a miscarriage of justice to let
the verdict stand . . . [.] This power should be . . . invoked only in those exceptional cases in
which the evidence weighs heavily against the verdict." United States v. Howard, 245 F. Supp.
2d 24, 30 (D.D.C. 2003) (quoting United States v. Edmonds, 765 F. Supp. 1112, 1118 (D.D.C.
1991)). Moreover, a new trial should be allowed “only if the defendant has shown that the error .
. . affected the defendant's substantial rights." United States v. Williams, 825 F. Supp. 2d 128,
132 (D.D.C. 2011).
V. Rhodes will supplement this motion on or before December 23, 2022.
In addition to arguments made in various motions to dismiss, an oral motion for judgment
of acquittal, and a written motion for judgment of acquittal, Rhodes, as instructed by the Court,
will file a supplemental brief in support of the instant requests for a new trial and for the granting
of judgment of acquittal.

Case 1:22-cr-00015-APM Document 423 Filed 12/12/22 Page 3 of 4
WHEREFORE, the Defendant respectfully requests that he be granted a new trial or that
his motion for judgment of acquittal be granted.
Respectfully submitted:
