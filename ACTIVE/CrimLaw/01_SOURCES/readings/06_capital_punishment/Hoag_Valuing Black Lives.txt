VALUING BLACK LIVES: A CASE FOR
ENDING THE DEATH PENALTY
Alexis Hoag*
ABSTRACT
Since Furman v. Georgia, capital punishment jurisprudence
has equipped decisionmakers with increased structure, guidance, and
narrowing in death sentencing in an effort to eliminate the arbitrary
imposition of death. Yet, these efforts have been largely unsuccessful
given the wide discretion built into capital sentencing which allows for
prejudice, bias, and racism to persist. Juries continue to sentence a
disproportionately high number of defendants who have been convicted
of murdering white victims to death. As a result, death sentencing
schemes tend to undervalue Black murder victims’ lives. Any effort to
eliminate the disparity must center on the undervaluation of Black
lives.
This Article suggests that the next challenge to the death
penalty should be on equal protection grounds based on the
undervaluation of Black lives. It highlights that the Fourteenth
Amendment was originally intended, in part, to extend the equal
protection of the laws to Black victims of crime. The Article then
explores the pitfalls of other race-based challenges to the death
penalty. And demonstrates that a challenge based on disparities in
capitally prosecuting white and Black victim cases could end capital

INTRODUCTION
On October 15, 1986, Mary Beth Westmoreland appeared
before the United States Supreme Court on behalf of the State of
Georgia to defend the State’s racially disparate death sentencing
scheme.1 One of the Justices asked Ms. Westmoreland to explain why
Georgia treated “white victim cases . . . [as] consistently more
serious.”2 She responded,
[O]ut of the black victim cases . . . you’ll find perhaps
over a thousand occur in something like a family
dispute, a lover dispute, a fight involving liquor of some
sort, where some . . . one party is drunk or the [o]ther
party is drunk. Those types of disputes occur so
frequently in black victim cases that they . . . fall out of
the system much earlier, and—leaving the much
m[o]re aggravated, the more highly aggravated white
victim cases, involving armed robberies, and such
things as property disputes. . . . And for whatever
reason, frequently more times we’ll see torture cases
involving white victim cases than you do in black
victim cases.”3
Each of Ms. Westmoreland’s examples—drunken disputes,
family disputes, disputes among lovers—reflected racist stereotypes
and unfounded value judgments as to the worthiness of Black lives;
none of these cases were supported by empirical evidence. The case,
brought by Warren McCleskey, a Black man sentenced to die for
murdering a white victim, relied on a detailed statistical study to
propose a different explanation: that Georgia unconstitutionally relied
on race—the victim’s white race and the defendant’s Black race—when
determining who to sentence to death. In fact, relying on the study’s
findings, John Boger, arguing on behalf of Mr. McCleskey, explained
that Georgia’s death penalty treated “[t]he color of a defendant’s
skin . . . or that of his victim . . . as grave an aggravating
circumstance . . . as those expressly designated by Georgia’s
legislature.”4 Moreover, that such discrimination was based on “a

century-old pattern in the State of Georgia of animosity” against Black
defendants, particularly those accused of harming white victims.5
Since its inception, the disproportionate imposition of the
death penalty has denied murdered Black victims the equal protection
of the laws. Capital punishment is supposed to be reserved for those
who commit the “worst of the worst” crimes.6 Instead, as a result of
bias, prejudice and racism, it is disproportionality reserved for those
charged with killing white victims.7 Over the last fifty years, death
penalty jurisprudence has provided increasing amounts of structure,
guidance, and narrowing to eliminate the arbitrary imposition of
death.8 I argue that these efforts have been largely unsuccessful given
the wide discretion built into capital sentencing which allows for
racism to operate undetected.9
In 1972, a plurality of the Supreme Court held in Furman v.
Georgia that capital punishment, as administered at the time, violated
the Constitution.10 In so holding, members of the Court acknowledged

that the death penalty had only been applied in “freakishly or
spectacularly rare” cases, with little predictability relative to the
nature of the crime.11 The decision immediately voided all death
sentences in the nation.12 However, shortly after Furman, the Court
reinstated capital punishment in Gregg v. Georgia, approving death
sentencing schemes that provided prosecutors and jurors with guided
discretion in an attempt to eradicate prejudice and bias in the
administration of death.13
As was the case prior to Furman, the death penalty continues
to be administered to the most disfavored members of society: the poor,
those with mental illness, and Black people.14 The death penalty is still
disproportionately sought and imposed against defendants accused of
murdering white victims.15 For example, in 1990, the U.S. General

Accounting Office (“GAO”) conducted a comprehensive study of death
penalty cases decided since Furman. The GAO concluded that “[i]n 82
percent of the studies . . . those who murdered whites were found to be
more likely to be sentenced to death than those who murdered
blacks.”16 In addition, the report found that “[t]he race of victim
influence . . . was stronger for the earlier stages of the judicial process
(e.g. prosecutorial decision to charge defendant with a capital
offense . . .).”17 These trends have remained consistent over time.
Any death sentencing scheme is unlikely to eradicate racism
from its operation where the American public and the justice system
continue to undervalue Black lives.18 Where multiple actors in the
justice system—law enforcement, prosecuting attorneys, and the
jury—all contribute to consistent race-of-victim disparities in death
sentencing, there can be no constitutional administration of capital
punishment. My argument, therefore, is that a successful challenge to
the death penalty must be centered on the undervaluation of Black
lives. If proven, the appropriate remedy is not to extend capital
punishment to those who murder Black victims,19 because absent
automatic death sentencing for certain crimes, which the Court
already invalidated,20 the law cannot force prosecutors to seek death
and juries to impose death in Black victim cases. Rather, the
appropriate remedy is to abolish the death penalty altogether.
To date, the Court has never made an equal protection
determination regarding the constitutionality of the death penalty vis-
à-vis the undervaluation of Black lives.21 In order to assert this claim,

a Black defendant sentenced to death for the murder of a white victim
would therefore be required to show that the state declined to seek
death against another defendant in a similarly aggravated case
involving a Black victim, present data supporting that showing, and
provide proof that the decision makers in the Black victim case acted
with discriminatory purpose in declining to seek death.
An examination of early criminal laws and the legislative
history of the Fourteenth Amendment make a strong case for
advancing this challenge. Part I surveys existing scholarship on racial
disparities in death sentencing based on the race of the victim. Part II
covers antebellum history of racial disparities in criminal laws and how
the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment was intended, in part, to
extend the equal protection of the law to Black victims of crime. Part
III discusses the Court’s decision in McCleskey and the lessons learned.

of Black life would look like.
I. EXISTING SCHOLARSHIP ON RACIAL DISPARITIES
Multiple actors in the criminal justice system contribute to
death sentencing disparities based on the victim’s race. Recent
scholarship indicates that the police are one of the first actors to
contribute to this disparity when they identify potential suspects
during the investigation of death-eligible cases.22 Further, numerous
studies show that prosecuting attorneys contribute to the disparity
when determining whether to seek death in a murder case23 and when
than white murderers.”). In denying Mr. McCleskey’s challenge, the Court noted
that he was “not seek[ing] to assert . . . the rights of black murder victims in

juries are more likely to sentence defendants to death when the victim
is white.25
These troubling trends are the result of death sentencing laws

deciding how much weight to assign aggravating and mitigating
evidence during the sentencing hearing.26
A. Race of Victim Studies
In 1998, Professor David Baldus led a thorough examination of
post-Furman death penalty cases analyzing racial discrimination in
capital sentencing.27 Baldus and his team surveyed existing studies
measuring the impact of race-of-defendant and race-of-victim on death
sentencing, most of which focused on cases involving Black
defendants/white victims and white defendants/white victims. These
studies showed that the chance of a case resulting in the death penalty
were highest in Black defendant/white victim cases.28 Baldus also
looked specifically at cases from Philadelphia to determine whether
there was race-of-victim impact. Researchers identified nearly 1000
death eligible cases from 1983 to 1993 and analyzed the penalty phases
of capital trials to determine what impact, if any, the defendant and
victim’s race had on sentencing.29 Baldus concluded that victim race
was “particularly prominent” during the jury’s determination of
mitigation, and that the “magnitude and consistency” of the results
would not be observable “if substantial equality existed in this system’s
treatment of defendants.”30
Six years later Baldus led another team to analyze the extent
of racial discrimination in death sentencing.31 Baldus noted that prior
to Furman, researchers paid little attention to race of victim data,
focusing mostly on race of the defendant. Regardless, pre-Furman
research from Georgia revealed that prosecutors were 4.3 times more
likely to seek the death penalty against a defendant charged with
murdering a white victim than a similarly situated defendant charged
with murdering a Black victim.32 After surveying post-Furman

scholarship, the team concluded that “race-of-victim influence was
found at all stages of the criminal justice system” and was strongest at
the earliest stages, such as when the prosecutor decided to seek death
and in whether to proceed with trial rather than a plea offer.33
One of the starkest race-of-victim disparities comes from a
2015 study of Louisiana murders.34 Using FBI statistics, Frank
Baumgartner and Tim Lyman analyzed all homicides that occurred in
the state between 1976 and 2011, and then continued to analyze death
sentence and execution data through July 2015.35 Those who murdered
white women were 12 times more likely to be sentenced to death than
a defendant who murdered a Black male.36 Although Black men made
up the majority of homicide victims in the state (61%), only 8% of those
cases led to the execution of the perpetrator. Conversely, white women
represented only 7% of all homicide victims, but 47% of those cases led
to the defendant’s execution.37 Here, the researchers concluded that
“the families and communities of murdered black males [were] denied”
equal protection of the laws.38 Indeed, no white person had been
executed for a crime against a Black person in Louisiana since 1752.39
Turning to North Carolina, Jack Boger and Isaac Unah
examined death penalty cases from 1993 to 1997, finding that
defendants whose victims were white were 3.5 times more likely to be
sentenced to death than those with non-white victims.40 Unah noted
that no matter how he and Boger analyzed the data, the whiteness of
homicide victims “operate[d] as a ‘silent aggravating circumstance’
that ma[d]e[] death significantly more likely to be imposed.”41 Michael

Radelet and Glenn Pierce came to a similar conclusion when reviewing
data from North Carolina capital cases from 1980 to 2007.42
The race-of-victim impact also extends to who gets executed.
This means that defendants who attempt to obtain appellate relief
from their death sentence are also impacted by the victim’s race. The
Death Penalty Information Center notes that post-Gregg, “when
executions have been carried out . . . 75 percent of the cases involve the
murder of white victims, even though blacks and whites are about
equally likely to be victims of murder.”43 In Georgia, defendants
convicted of murdering white victims are 17 times more likely to be
executed than defendants convicted of murdering Black victims.44
When rape was still a death-eligible crime, researchers found that of
the 455 men executed for rape between 1930 and 1967, 89 percent were
Black.45
Findings consistently show that the murder victim’s race is a
driving force at multiple decision points throughout death sentencing.
The Court’s decision in Furman afforded state actors significant
discretion at each of these points, enabling them to insert racism, bias,
and prejudice into their decision making. Thus, even with guided
discretion, that most decision-makers are white—investigative law
enforcement, the prosecution,46 judges,47 and juries48—means that

their exercise of discretion is likely guided by their ability to more
readily empathize with white victims.49
B. Centering on Black Murder Victims
Other scholars have acknowledged the devaluation of Black
victims in arguments about racial discrimination in capital
punishment.50 For example, in the wake of the Court’s decision in
McCleskey, Professor Randall Kennedy noted that critics of the opinion
often “failed to explore the implications of the undervaluation” of Black
victims of murder.51 However, his critique does not stem from an
abolitionist framework, but instead speaks to a broader social concern:
the plight of Black communities that disproportionately experience
violence.52
In the same year that Kennedy published his article, Stephen
Carter explored the American legal system’s response to victims of
crime, arguing that the law fails to provide equal protection of the laws
to Black victims.53 Carter criticized the Court’s holding in McCleskey
for not only failing to address racism’s role in the disproportionate
execution of Black defendants, but also “for the inadequate protection
of murder victims who happen to be black.”54 Carter concluded that the
political and legal climate recognizes two types of people when criminal
conduct is involved: victims and Black people.55
In a 1989 article, Michael Radelet analyzed cases where a
white person was executed for crimes against Black people.56 Radelet
reviewed records from 15,978 executions beginning in 1608 and
identified only 30 cases in which a white person was executed for a

crime involving a Black victim.57 Given the rarity of such cases, Radelet
set out to determine what non-racial factors contributed to each
execution. He concluded that social status was the driving force.58 For
example, among white people executed, some either had lower
occupational status relative to their Black victims, others were
“marginal members of the white community,” and some had prior
criminal records, including prior offenses against white people.59 Thus,
the victim’s Black race alone could not explain each perpetrator’s
execution.
II. EARLY AMERICAN CRIMINAL LAW AND THE FOURTEENTH
AMENDMENT AS REDRESS TO BLACK VICTIMS OF CRIME
The lack of redress for Black victims of crime is not a recent
phenomenon; its origins lie in slavery and white supremacy. These two
interdependent forces shaped the early operation of America’s criminal
legal system and continue to impact its operation today.60

A. Early American Criminal Law
The seeds of white supremacy were planted in 1619, when
white settlers first brought enslaved Africans to the shores of colonial
America.61 “It took only a few decades after the arrival of enslaved
Africans in Virginia before white settlers demanded a new world
defined by racial caste.”62 The law of slavery was a uniquely American
invention because the common law that the colonies inherited from
England did not provide for master-enslaved person relationships.63
During the colonial period, the common law was not intended to protect
enslaved people; instead, slave codes enabled white people to punish
Black people with impunity to maintain power and dominance. “The
most salient distinction between the master-slave relationship and
other human interactions was the unlimited violence and oppression
that the slave master could legitimately inflict upon his bondsman.”64
Given the inherent inequality in the relationship, whereby an enslaved
person was wholly owned by another person by virtue of race, enslaved
individuals “were powerless in the face of their masters’ unlimited
power.”65
Each colony had a set of slave codes. These laws dictated, with
specificity, the property rights of those who owned enslaved people, the

contexts.”).

rights these owners had to discipline their property, and protections
against rebellions led by enslaved people.66 Slave owners relied heavily
on the slave codes to assert and maintain control because the state
lacked power to stop a collective slave uprising.67 As a result,
legislators explicitly deprived enslaved people of the equal protection
of “the common law of crimes” when whites “violently abused” them.68
Legislators “pass[ed] exculpatory acts that granted both slave masters
and whites who were strangers to the slave legal rights to beat, whip,
and kill bondsmen.”69 The only type of redress the slave laws provided
for such treatment was to the slave owner, who could be reimbursed
for damages to his property or for replacement if the abuse resulted in
death.70 No enslaved person could testify in court against a white
person to determine guilt.71 According to early colonial law, enslaved
people were not considered worthy of protection. However, these same
laws “held slaves . . . morally responsible and punishable for
misdemeanors and felonies.”72 Thus, early colonial law intentionally
did not provide redress for Black people; it provided only punishment.
Following the formation of the United States, the law’s
emphasis on punishing Black bodies continued. Antebellum era
criminal codes often explicitly mentioned both the race of the victim
and the defendant, making certain acts felonies only when committed
by Black people. For example, in Alabama, an enslaved person could
receive “up to one hundred stripes on the bare back . . . [for] forg[ing] a
pass or engag[ing] in ‘riots, routs, unlawful, assemblies, trespasses,
and seditious speeches.’”73 Similarly, “[i]n Louisiana, a slave who
struck his master, a member of the master’s family, or the overseer, ‘so
as to cause a contusion, or effusion or shedding of blood,’ was to suffer
death . . . .”74
Whereas certain crimes specifically targeted enslaved people,
equally troubling was the fact that the social, political, and legal norms
of the South also failed to hold white people accountable where the
victim of the crime was Black. For example, the criminal codes

assigned harsher punishments to enslaved and free Black people for
committing the same offense as a white person.75 In Georgia, “rape
committed by a white man was never regarded as sufficiently serious
to warrant a penalty greater than 20 years imprisonment. Rape
committed by a slave or a free person of color upon a white woman was
punishable by death.”76 Early American criminal law laid the
foundation for the racial disparities we continue to observe in
contemporary capital punishment.
B. Adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment
The Civil War transformed the United States politically,
economically, and legally. During Reconstruction, from approximately
1863 to 1877, some of these changes briefly touched the lives of
formerly enslaved and free Black people.77 It was during this period
that Congress passed the Fourteenth Amendment. The context, key
political figures, and legislative history leading up to the Amendment’s
passage shed light on the framers’ intent to extend the equal protection
of the laws to Black people, specifically those victimized by crime.
In the aftermath of Emancipation, most Southern whites,
regardless of whether they had been slaveholders, were not prepared
to recognize the rights of Black people.78 Accordingly, Southern
lawmakers, many of whom had owned slaves or were from slaveholding
families, passed a series of laws to maintain the subjugation of Black
people.79 These laws became known as black codes.80 For instance,
“[b]lacks convicted of raping white women were required by law to be
castrated or killed. White men convicted of raping white women,
however, could expect much less severe punishments. The rape of black
women was not even recognized as a crime.”81
Meanwhile, Congress had to quickly determine how to address
post-war Southern resistance and reunify the splintered nation. On
January 12, 1866, a Joint Committee of members of the 39th Congress
convened “to inquire into the condition of the States which formed the

so-called Confederate States.”82 Republican Representatives Thaddeus
Stevens (PA) and John Bingham (OH) were key members of the
committee, powerful political leaders, and fierce opponents of slavery
and racial discrimination.83
During the Reconstruction hearing, members of Congress
questioned lawyers, military officials, and businessmen residing in the
South about the experiences of Black people in the aftermath of the
war. Much of the testimony described violence against Black people. In
Alabama, in the months immediately following the war, a Union Major
General observed: “I have not known, after six months’ residence at the
capital of the State, a single instance of a white man being convicted
and hung or sent to the penitentiary for a crime against a negro, while
many cases of crime warranting such punishment have been reported
to me.”84 The Major General explained that some of these crimes
committed against Black people included the “most atrocious
murders.”85 Major General Canby described a similar situation in
Louisiana: “[T]he prevailing sentiment is so adverse to the negro that
acts of monstrous crime against him are winked at; and this sentiment
will increase just in proportion as the privileges of the negroes are
extended.”86
An attorney practicing in Norfolk, Virginia testified: “I have
had more than a hundred complaints made to me with reference to the
abuse of freedmen . . . . They have been beaten, wounded, and in some
instances killed; and I have not yet known one white man to have been
brought to justice for an outrage upon a colored man.”87 Similarly,
when the Joint Committee asked Major General Clinton Fisk whether
a Black man in South Carolina would turn to the courts if a white man
violated his wife, Fisk responded: “the negro . . . would not dream of
such a thing [because of] . . . fear of personal violence to himself, and

because he would think it would be utterly futile . . . .”88 Earlier in his
testimony, Fisk reported that he “found numerous evidences . . . that
[Black women’s] chastity had been disregarded by the whites . . . .”89
The Joint Committee’s report was over 800 pages, detailing
months of testimony, much of it describing violent Southern resistance
to Black freedom. It was clear that, without federal legislation,
Southern whites had little intention of recognizing Black people’s
humanity or dignity: “The only hope the colored people have is in Uncle
Sam’s bayonets; without them, they would not feel any security . . . .”90
After bearing witness to this testimony, Representative Bingham
drafted Section I of the Fourteenth Amendment:
No state shall make or enforce any law which shall
abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the
United States; nor shall any state deprive any person
of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law;
nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal
protection of the laws.91
When Senator Jacob Howard of Michigan introduced the
Amendment to the Senate, he explained: “It prohibits the hanging of a
black man for a crime for which the white man is not to be hanged.”92
Forefront in the framers’ minds was to provide redress to Black victims
of crimes, and to end the legal discrepancies that had long existed in
Southern states.

Justice Powell foreshadowed the challenge in his dissent in Furman,
musing: “If a Negro defendant . . . could demonstrate that members of
his race were being singled out for more severe punishment than others
charged with the same offense, a constitutional violation might be
established.”94 Embracing Justice Powell’s invitation, counsel for Mr.
McCleskey argued that Georgia’s death sentencing scheme racially
discriminated against Warren McCleskey, a Black man sentenced to
death for killing a white man, in violation of both the Eighth and
Fourteenth Amendments.95 In support, they relied on David Baldus’s
complex statistical study showing that Georgia’s death sentencing
scheme resulted in “persistent racial disparities in capital
sentencing—disparities by race of the victim and by race of the
defendant—that are highly statistically significant and cannot be
explained by any of the hundreds of [other] sentencing factors . . . .”96
Baldus’s analysis showed that defendants charged with killing a white
victim received the death penalty at a rate nearly eleven times higher
than defendants charged with killing a Black victim.97 Yet despite the
clear conclusions from the data, the Supreme Court was unconvinced.98
In evaluating the Fourteenth Amendment claim, the Court
seemed fearful of the vast implications of Mr. McCleskey’s request.99
Namely, finding an equal protection violation would have required the
Court to acknowledge deeply entrenched, systemic racism in the
administration of the death penalty. It was unwilling to concede that
racism, bias, and prejudice played a role in police investigations,
prosecutor charging decisions, and jury and judge decision-making.100
Nor did the Court accept the statistical evidence as sufficient proof of
purposeful racism in Mr. McCleskey’s case. Instead, for Mr. McCleskey
to prevail on an inference of discrimination, the Court “demand[ed]

exceptionally clear proof,”101 despite the fact that the Court routinely
relied on statistical evidence in other areas of the law to infer
discrimination, particularly where “smoking gun” evidence is
unlikely.102 The Court also dismissed Mr. McCleskey’s historical
evidence, claiming that history from the Civil War era had “little
probative value” and that “actions taken long ago” did not reveal
“current intent.”103 The Court therefore created a regime where the
most relevant and probative evidence—i.e., historical discrimination
and deliberate disproportionate punishment—could not be used to
establish a Fourteenth Amendment equal protection violation. This
undermined the intent to extend redressability to Black people
inherent in the Fourteenth Amendment.104
Ultimately, in rejecting Mr. McCleskey’s Eighth Amendment
arguments, the Court invited him to take his case and statistical proof
to the legislature, a body better suited to address his concerns.105
IV. CHALLENGING THE DEATH PENALTY BASED ON THE
UNDERVALUATION OF BLACK LIVES
The Fourteenth Amendment forbids public officials from
intentional discrimination based on race absent a compelling
government interest. This prohibition extends to investigating police
officers and prosecutors exercising discretion. No compelling state
interest can justify the government’s failure to seek the death penalty
in aggravated murders involving Black victims at similar rates as in
cases involving white victims. The distinguishing factor in the
government’s failure to seek death is not the aggravation of the crime,
but rather the race of the victim. As the Court recognized in McCleskey,
“[i]t would violate the Equal Protection Clause for a State to base
enforcement of its criminal laws on ‘an unjustifiable standard such as
race.’”106

1004 COLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [51.3
A. Standing and Selection of Parties to Raise the Claim
A threshold determination in mounting a Fourteenth
Amendment equal protection challenge is determining who should
raise it: the estate of a Black victim, a defendant who murdered a Black
victim and against whom the government did not seek death, or a
defendant who murdered a white victim and against whom the
government did seek death? No lawyer acting in her client’s best
interest would challenge the government’s failure to seek death
against her client. Instead, the question becomes whether a capitally-
charged defendant who murdered a white victim has third-party
standing to raise the issue on behalf of a murdered Black victim from
a non-capital case.
Third-party standing determinations require the person
pursuing the claim to have an interest in the outcome of the dispute,
to be closely related to the third party, and for the third party to be
unlikely to assert their own right.107 Beginning with Craig v. Boren108
and continuing with Batson v. Kentucky109, the Court began to relax
standing principles to address equal protection violations. In Batson,
the defendant challenged the government’s unlawful removal of a
prospective juror based on the juror’s race. In allowing a defendant to
pursue a jury selection discrimination claim, the Court implicitly
recognized that the unlawfully excluded juror was unlikely to assert
their own right. Similarly, there is little likelihood that a Black murder
victim’s estate would assert the victim’s right to equal protection of a
criminal prosecution. Moreover, there is an additional harm in need of
redress: the harm to the community where selective capital
prosecution based on race undermines “public confidence in the
fairness of our justice system.”110 Like Batson, the prosecutor’s
discriminatory action “causes a criminal defendant cognizable
injury . . . because it ‘casts doubt on the integrity of the judicial process’
and places the fairness of a criminal proceeding in doubt.”111
The most appropriate actor to bring the challenge is a Black
defendant whom the state is seeking death against for allegedly
murdering a white victim. To avoid procedural default, the ideal

2020] Valuing Black Lives 1005
procedural mechanism to raise the claim is a pretrial motion after the
prosecution has filed its death notice. To raise the claim, the lawyers
must find a factually similar case from the same prosecuting
jurisdiction involving a white or Black defendant prosecuted for
murdering a Black victim and where the state declined to seek death.
The two crimes should share identical possible aggravating
circumstances and should have occurred during roughly the same
timeframe. These similarities—aggravating facts, prosecutor’s office,
and timing—will help isolate the victim’s race as the distinguishing
characteristic between a death-noticed case and a non-capital
prosecution.
B. Purposeful Discrimination
The central takeaway from McCleskey was that any
subsequent challenge to the death penalty on equal protection grounds
must include evidence of purposeful racial discrimination.112 Thus,
when raising the claim from the perspective of a Black murder victim,
such evidence must support an inference that the decisionmakers acted
with discriminatory purpose when they declined to seek death.
Existing statistics illustrate the stark race-of-victim disparities in law
enforcement murder investigations, prosecutor charging decisions,
jury sentencing, and executions. However, McCleskey tells us we need
more.
As Anthony Amsterdam explained in his 2007 remarks
reflecting on McCleskey, we must collect information about racism in
the community where the cases are being prosecuted, in the
prosecuting attorney’s office, and in the investigating police
department.113 We must also gather evidence of racial discrimination
from the specific prosecutors involved in the charging decisions—their
record of Batson violations, their personnel files, and any public
statements they have made.114 The NAACP Legal Defense and
Educational Fund’s amicus brief in Flowers v. Mississippi is an
excellent example of how to identify racism in a specific community, in

C. Remedy
In response to the racially disproportionate data in McCleskey,
one of the Justices mused: “It’s such a curious case, because what’s the
remedy? Is it to execute more people?”116 Of course not. At the time,
Jack Boger demurred, offering that the Court need not make a facial
holding on the constitutionality of the death penalty akin to the Court’s
decision in Furman.117 However, today the only appropriate remedy is
to abolish the death penalty. States still operating a capital
punishment system are incapable of administering the death penalty
free from racial discrimination and arbitrariness. Legally irrelevant
factors continue to drive death sentencing including the quality of
defense counsel, the location of the crime, and the race of the victim
(and often the defendant).118 Expanding the death penalty’s reach to
include defendants in Black victim cases serves only to perpetuate the
undervaluation of Black lives because the perpetrators of Black victim
cases are often also Black.119
To ensure that Black victims receive equal protection of the
laws, the government must end the discriminatory imposition of
capital punishment. A natural extension of valuing the lives of Black
victims is to value the lives of all defendants, particularly Black
defendants charged with aggravated murders.120

2020] Valuing Black Lives 1007
CONCLUSION
At its founding, the nation’s criminal legal system
distinguished between races to determine what behavior was criminal
and who to punish. The Fourteenth Amendment, in part, was ratified
to eradicate these distinctions. Placing equal value on Black
lives—perpetrators and victims—relative to white lives, would compel
the criminal legal system to address longstanding racial discrimination
in the operation of the death penalty. Rather than expand or even
reform capital punishment, the only solution is abolition. Borrowing
from Allegra McLeod’s prison abolition framework, abolition of the
death penalty forces the law to confront the dehumanization, violence,
and racial degradation inherent in death sentencing.121 Empirical
evidence gathered since Furman illustrates that our nation is
incapable of administering the death penalty free from racial
discrimination. It is time for this nation to cease tinkering with the
machinery of death and to abolish capital punishment.
