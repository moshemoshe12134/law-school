BLACK ON BLACK REPRESENTATION
ALEXIS HOAG*
When it comes to combating structural racism, representation matters, and this is
true for criminal defense as much as it is for mental health services and education.
This Article calls for the expansion of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel of
choice to indigent defendants and argues that such an expansion could be of partic-
ular benefit to indigent Black defendants. Extending choice to all indigent defen-
dants reinforces the principles underlying the Sixth Amendment right to counsel
and can help strengthen the attorney-client relationship. Because an expansion
would grant defendants the autonomy to request counsel who they believe would
best represent them, Black defendants who prioritize racial congruency and cul-
tural competency may select Black counsel. Empowering indigent Black people to
select, should they desire, Black and/or culturally competent public defenders has
the potential to offer a range of benefits, including mitigating anti-Black racism in
the criminal legal system.
Methodologically, this Article takes multiple approaches. First, it connects indigent
representation to existing literature from other fields—clinical therapy and educa-
tion—both of which recognize the benefits of racial congruency, to support the
argument that Black public defenders may benefit Black clients. To explore how
same-race representation functions in practice, this Article also relies on qualitative
interviews with Black public defenders regarding communication and trust, factors
that the American Bar Association identifies as integral to criminal defense.
Together, these approaches highlight how expanding choice to indigent defendants
might impact Black defendants, something that past choice of counsel literature
does not examine. The Article concludes that recruiting more Black public
defenders and training culturally competent lawyers are critical next steps regard-
less of whether the Court expands the right to counsel of choice to people who
qualify for appointed counsel.

INTRODUCTION
In interpreting the Sixth Amendment’s assistance of counsel pro-
vision, the United States Supreme Court recognized multiple rights,
including the right to counsel,1 the right to conflict free counsel,2 the
right to effective counsel,3 the right to represent oneself,4 and the right
to counsel of choice.5 However, the Court’s Sixth Amendment juris-
prudence limits only one of these rights based on an individual’s
ability to afford representation: the right to counsel of choice.6 The
Court has repeatedly recognized that the right to counsel of choice
“does not go beyond ‘the individual’s right to spend [their] own

money to obtain the advice and assistance of . . . counsel.’”7
According to the jurisprudence, an indigent person’s right to counsel
is satisfied so long as appointed counsel is competent and capable of
rendering adequate services.8 Thus, if an indigent person is dissatisfied
with counsel for some reason, unless counsel is incompetent or their
conduct is constitutionally ineffective, the individual has no other
options. In short, beggars can’t be choosers.
The Court’s income-based distinction in counsel of choice cases
does not comport with the principles underlying the Sixth
Amendment. Autonomy, which cuts across income levels, is one such
principle.9 For instance, the Court recognized that “a defendant must
be allowed to make [their] own choices about the proper way to pro-
tect [their] own liberty.”10 This should include the selection of counsel,
as defense counsel is central to protecting a person’s liberty interests
in the face of criminal charges.11 Similarly, in McCoy v. Louisiana, the
Court reaffirmed that the defendant has the “right to make the funda-
mental choices about [their] own defense.”12
Central to representation is a trusting relationship.13 As Justice
Brennan explained, “crucial decisions . . . can best be made, and
counsel’s duties most effectively discharged, if the attorney and the
defendant have a relationship characterized by trust and confi-
dence.”14 An attorney-client relationship lacking trust can be corro-

sive to representation and amount to the denial of counsel.15 Yet,
where a relationship of trust between counsel and the defendant is
paramount to effective representation, an indigent defendant can only
hope for a trusting, communicative relationship with appointed
counsel.16 In instances where trust fails to form and a breakdown in
communication occurs, indigent defendants run the risk of being stuck
with what they could not pay for.17
Differences in race, ethnicity, and culture between counsel and an
indigent defendant can create barriers to relationship building, com-
munication, and trust formation.18 It is at this junction—the right to
counsel of choice and race—where this Article resides. This Article
calls for the Court to expand the Sixth Amendment right to counsel of
choice to indigent people and argues that the expansion could be of
particular benefit to Black indigent defendants.
Black people are overrepresented in the criminal legal system,
the majority of whom are indigent and qualify for public defenders or
appointed counsel.19 Given the lack of racial diversity in the legal pro-

(11th Cir. 1985) (holding that “defendant’s general loss of confidence or trust in his

fession, the system overwhelmingly appoints white lawyers to
represent indigent Black clients.20 For instance, over 70% of assistant
federal public defenders are white, with white men making up the
largest subgroup at 40.5%; among Criminal Justice Act attorneys who
federal courts appoint to represent indigent defendants, approxi-
mately 80% are white.21 The existence of anti-Black bias among
defense counsel is well-documented.22 Anti-Black bias in the attorney-
client relationship can lead to distrust and misunderstanding, corrode
representation, and further reinforce anti-Black racism within the
incarcerated Black people in state court and 64.7% of Black people in federal court, a
higher percentage relative to white and Hispanic defendants in both state and federal
courts. Id. at 9. The New York Times noted that “[r]oughly four out of five criminal

criminal legal system.23 In one study exploring bias in the legal system,
the authors mused: “If police, prosecutors, jurors, judges, and defense
attorneys all harbor anti-[B]lack preferences, then the system would
appear to have limited safeguards to protect [B]lack defendants from
bias.”24
As a solution, this Article calls for the expansion of the Sixth
Amendment right to counsel of choice for all indigent defendants.
Extending choice to indigent defendants reinforces the principles
underlying the Sixth Amendment right to counsel and can help
strengthen the attorney-client relationship. Given the focus of this
Article, the expansion would also grant a defendant the autonomy to
request counsel who shares their race and/or to select culturally com-
petent counsel25 if they believed that lawyer could best represent
them. Empowering indigent Black people to select, should they
desire, Black and/or culturally competent public defenders also has
the potential to help mitigate anti-Black racism in the criminal legal
system. Current choice of counsel literature does not explore the
impact an expansion could have on indigent Black defendants, nor
does indigent defense literature address the potential benefits of racial
congruency in representation.
Black lawyers often have the experiential knowledge of what it is
like to move through the world with the social meaning attached to
Blackness and thus, firsthand knowledge of the corresponding treat-
ment and dangers.26 I call this “embodied empathy.”27 As a result,
many Black public defenders have a greater ability to understand and
empathize with the stressors and circumstances that resulted in the
criminal charges their clients face, and to recognize the humanity in
their clients. This embodied empathy enables many Black defenders
to build rapport more readily with their clients and to establish trust,
both of which can contribute to improved representation. Constitu-

tionally effective representation depends upon a trusting attorney-
client relationship.28 And as this Article demonstrates, Black clients
tend to form a more trusting relationship with Black counsel given the
shared social meaning assigned to race in this country.29
Although indigent defendants from other non-dominant ethnici-
ties and cultures can benefit from culturally competent representation,
this Article focuses on the potential impact expanding counsel of
choice may have on indigent Black people facing criminal charges.
The overrepresentation of Black people in the criminal legal system
reflects longstanding structural racism born from slavery and the
racial hierarchy that resulted.30 It also stems from the strength of anti-
Black bias that stereotypes Black people as dangerous and criminal.31
These stereotypes are direct descendants of slavery, which produced a
racialized caste system. In her book, Caste, journalist Isabel Wilkerson
explains: “What people look like, or, rather, the race they have been
assigned or are perceived to belong to, is the visible cue to their
caste.”32 The public then relies on caste as an “historic flash card” to
determine “how [people] are to be treated, where they are expected
to live, . . . [and] whether they may be shot by authorities with impu-
nity.”33 Historian Khalil Muhammad calls it “racial criminalization:
the stigmatization of crime as ‘[B]lack’” while simultaneously
28 See United States ex rel. Wilcox v. Johnson, 555 F.2d 115, 122 (3d Cir. 1977)

representation”);see also supra note 14 and accompanying text.

show that police stop and question Black people at higher rates;35

regarding communication and trust39—factors that the American Bar
Association identifies as integral to criminal representation.40
Existing choice of counsel scholarship does not examine how
expanding choice to indigent defendants might impact Black defen-
dants. Most of the literature questions the appropriateness and
legality of an income-based distinction, and, based on different theo-
ries, argues that the Court should extend choice to indigent people.41
39 In partnership with the Black Public Defender Association (BPDA), I disseminated
a brief online survey to BPDA members inquiring about public defender racial
demographics, cross-cultural representation training, recruitment efforts for ethnically
diverse attorneys, and whether subjects would be willing to receive follow up contact. I
followed up with a subset of Black public defenders who answered in the affirmative, and I
conducted individual web-based video interviews with them. I asked each subject open-
ended questions about their perception of the relevance of their race in representing Black
clients, the formation of the attorney-client relationship, communication, and the
development of trust. I conducted these interviews with the approval of Columbia
University’s Institutional Review Board and the financial support of Columbia Law
School. Citations to these recordings will be marked as “Defender No. __,” numbered in
the order in which the interviews took place.

1502 NEW YORK UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol.96:1493
For instance, thirty years ago, David Friedman and Stephen
Schulhofer argued that extending the right would likely improve the
attorney-client relationship, both because the client would be able to
exercise agency and the lawyer would have “a self-interested reason to
value the satisfaction of his client.”42 Although this Article agrees that
extending choice could improve representation, it takes the analysis a
step further by elevating the importance of the attorney-client rela-
tionship when examining the doctrine. It also argues that extending
choice may be particularly beneficial to indigent Black defendants
should they choose a Black and/or culturally competent lawyer. In
those instances, there is potential to mitigate anti-Black racism in the
system. Conversely, existing scholarship makes brief mention of how
race may impact the attorney-client relationship and representation.43
This Article proceeds as follows. Part I examines the history and
principles underlying the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, which
are tied to Black people and indigency, arguing that the Court must
extend the right to counsel of choice to make good on the constitu-
tional guarantee. Part II asserts that representation matters, exploring
same-race relationships in clinical therapy and education to provide a
framework for advancing Black on Black representation in indigent
defense. Part III defines embodied empathy, the unspoken familiarity
among Black people given their shared experience with the social
meanings assigned to race. Through firsthand accounts from Black
public defenders, Part IV explores how Black on Black representation
can impact the formation of the attorney-client relationship, including
the quality of communication and the development of trust. This Part
also argues that same-race representation may help mitigate anti-
Black racism in the criminal legal system and identifies some of the
limitations of same-race representation. The Article concludes with a
recommendation that recruiting more Black public defenders and

system-level safeguard against socialization of the criminal defense bar”); Janet Moore,

the Supreme Court’s “no-choice” language is dicta and that the Court should extend the

43 See Tague,Right to Attorney of Choice, supra note 41, at 80 n.41 (mentioning that
indigent defendants likely place greater trust and confidence in attorneys they choose,
which is “particularly true in cases involving . . . racial issues if the indigent feels the
attorney identifies in some way with him”); Schulhofer, supra note 41, at 534 (noting that a
“defendant may feel that he will be most comfortable . . . with an attorney of his own race

THE SIXTH AMENDMENT RIGHT TO COUNSEL OF CHOICE
The Sixth Amendment contains seven procedural protections for
those accused of committing a crime.44 This Article focuses on the
right to counsel, derived from these words: “In all criminal prosecu-
tions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have the Assistance of
Counsel for his defence.”45 Although today we view the right to
counsel as a central component of a fair trial and due process,46 the
legal system did not hold counsel in high regard until the 1920s and
’30s, when the Court began invalidating state criminal convictions for
violations of defendants’ constitutional rights.47 Many of these cases
involved indigent Black defendants in the South,48 including Powell v.
Alabama, which established the right to counsel and the right to
counsel of choice in 1932.49 The Court later elucidated that “[t]he
right to select counsel of one’s choice,” though not explicitly men-
tioned in the Amendment’s text, is part of “the root meaning” of the
Sixth Amendment right to counsel.50 Relative to other aspects of the
Sixth Amendment, the counsel of choice doctrine is “young and
undertheorized.”51 Thus, it is instructive to examine the social and his-
torical context of Powell v. Alabama to help identify the Court’s moti-

vation in recognizing the right and to support an expansion of the
right to counsel of choice to indigent people.
A. The Development of Indigent Defense
The prominence of defense counsel in securing and protecting the
rights of the accused came on the heels of the Progressive Era when
municipalities started delivering criminal defense services to low-
income people. Beginning in the 1910s, these efforts included
government-funded public defender offices52 and privately funded
volunteer defense services.53 Although each model provided legal ser-
vices to indigent people charged with crimes, the underlying philoso-
phies differed. Government-funded defender systems represented
democracy and a necessary element of due process, a concept just
beginning to take form.54 The rationale behind providing privately
funded counsel was to enable lawyers to operate independently of the
state, with a singular focus and loyalty to the client. The assumption
was that a government-funded defender system could not operate in
the best interest of low-income people because the government also
funded the prosecution.55 What was clear about both models was that
the delivery of criminal defense services to low-income people was to
enable “equality before the law,” relative to defendants who could
afford counsel.56 The insistence on equal footing between indigent
defendants and those with means cuts against the contemporary class-
based distinction in the right to counsel of choice.

November2021] BLACK ON BLACK REPRESENTATION 1505
New York City was one example of a municipality engaged in the
debate over how best to deliver criminal defense services to low-
income people. Members of the New York City and New York State
Bar Associations constituted the primary voices in these conversa-
tions.57 In 1917, Charles Evans Hughes was elected president of both
the New York State Bar Association and the Legal Aid Society.58 His
leadership in the development of indigent defense in New York City
helped shape his views in Powell, which the Court decided during his
tenure as Chief Justice.59 Hughes firmly believed in providing “expert
legal advice” to the poor; without it, he argued “it is idle to talk of
equality before the law.”60 During his tenure leading the New York
State Bar Association, Hughes helped develop the Voluntary
Defenders Committee,61 a privately funded indigent defense service,
which later merged with the Legal Aid Society, creating a permanent
criminal division to represent indigent people charged with crimes.62
A decade and a half later, the Hughes Court (1930–1941) was the
first to focus on the rights of criminal defendants, helping to establish
and shape modern criminal procedure.63 The Court’s actions in these
cases also signaled an awareness of the unique experiences of Black
people in the criminal legal system. Jurist and scholar A. Leon
Higgenbotham, Jr. observed that these decisions demonstrated an
awareness that the legal system “treated [B]lack criminal defendants
far more harshly than their white counterparts, and that this harsh
treatment was not a figment of [B]lacks’ imaginations.”64 During the
1930s, the Court overturned multiple criminal convictions in cases
involving Black defendants and blatant injustices. These included
cases involving a trial judge refusing to allow defense counsel to ques-

B. Curtailing Legal Lynching
The Court’s recognition of the right to counsel for the poor coin-
cided with its recognition of the right to counsel of choice in Powell v.
Alabama.70 The case involved nine poor Black youths, falsely accused
of raping two white women in rural Alabama.71 The trial judge techni-
cally appointed counsel, but counsel lacked the time and expertise to
provide adequate representation. After brief proceedings that could
be described as “trials” in name only, all-white juries sentenced all but
the youngest to death.72 By the early 1930s, capital punishment had
largely replaced extrajudicial lynchings of Black people.73 Lynchings,
which often occurred in public and with local law enforcement’s tacit
approval or even participation,74 traumatized entire Black communi-

ties and spurred the Great Migration.75 External pressure, including
from abroad, contributed to the sharp decrease in this so-called “mob-
justice” by the late 1930s and early 1940s.76
Lynchings, and the hasty trials that replaced them, frequently
began with the alleged rape of a white woman by a Black man—or
groups of Black men, such as in Powell.77 In reality, these allegations
frequently stemmed from an economic dispute, a perceived social
transgression, or a consensual interracial relationship.78 The state’s
criminal legal system treated Black indigent defendants charged with

belonged to the organization or refused to take action against it.”); see also United States

non-capital offenses just as swiftly.79 These quick, seemingly lawless
adjudications were not exclusively a Southern problem.80 However,
after slavery, the region relied heavily on the criminal legal system to
facilitate Black people’s virtual re-enslavement and to repopulate a
forced labor system through convict leasing and other exploitative
measures.81
Given weak federal oversight, local officials needed only to pro-
vide defendants with the appearance of due process.82 The federal
judiciary did not insert itself to enforce individuals’ constitutional
rights in state criminal cases with regularity until the Hughes Court.83
79 See, e.g., Derrick A. Bell, Jr., Racism in American Courts: Cause for Black
Disruption or Despair?, 61 CALIF. L. REV. 165, 176 (1973) (noting that Black defendants
“fared measurably poorer than their white counterparts” in criminal courts and that “cases
involving [B]lack defendants were generally heard in less time than those involving
whites”).
80 See id. (“[A] Detroit study . . . found that a significant number of defendants were
not advised of their rights. Black defendants were more likely than whites to have received
no proper indication of their charge, the right to testify, or the right to call and cross-
examine witnesses.”); id. at 177 (describing a Boston study revealing “shocking practices”
in criminal trial courts where the majority of defendants were Black and other ethnic
minorities, including that “defendants were not being adequately advised of their right to
counsel; . . . bail was set by reference to the charge and the defendant’s prior record”
instead of relevant factors like “family ties, length of residence in the community and job
and financial resources”).
81 See BLACKMON, supra note 30, at 57 (describing how “convict leasing adopted
practices almost identical to those emerging in slavery in the 1850s”).
82 See GILMORE,supra note 73, at 126 (describing the threat to “[B]lack safety” in the
South as the appearance of “lawfulness”). For instance, consider the trial of Jesse
Washington, a Black teenager accused of murdering and sexually assaulting a white woman
in Waco, Texas. DRAY, supra note 76, at 216. The judge allowed the angry white mob
inside the courtroom. Id. at 217. The court-appointed attorney “failed to exploit the most
glaring weakness in the prosecution’s case,” and the jury swiftly sentenced Washington to
death. The mob immediately snatched Washington from the courtroom, placed a chain
around his neck, and strung him up on a tree near city hall. Id. at 217–18. Participants
lowered his lifeless body, lit him on fire, and later cut off his fingers, toes, and penis as
souvenirs. Id. at 218. Then, “a man on a horse lassoed the charred remains and dragged
them through town, followed by a group of young boys. The skull eventually bounced loose
and was captured by some of the boys, who pried the teeth out and offered them for sale.”
Id.;see also Taken from the Court Room and Burned, EVENING TIMES-REPUBLICAN, May
15, 1916, at 1 (describing the lynching of Jesse Washington).
83 See ORFIELD, supra note 47, at 243 (describing the Court’s “develop[ing]” actions
“to insure a fair trial in the state courts” as “a vigorous and orthodox application of the
[D]ue [P]rocess [C]lause of the Fourteenth Amendment”). Notable exceptions included
Moore v. Dempsey, 261 U.S. 86, 87, 92 (1923) (reversing state court proceedings, which,
“although a trial in form, were only a form, and that the [five Black] appellants were
hurried to conviction [for murder] under the pressure of a mob without any regard for
their rights and without according to them due process of law”) and Strauder v. West
Virginia, 100 U.S. 303 (1880). In Strauder, the Court reversed a state criminal conviction,
holding that the state’s exclusion of people from jury service on account of race violated
the Fourteenth Amendment. Id. at 310. However, the Court’s prohibition of excluding
Black people from juries was largely symbolic until the mid-twentieth century, when small

November2021] BLACK ON BLACK REPRESENTATION 1509
Without protection from the federal courts, an indigent person, espe-
cially an indigent Black person, had little hope of retaining their con-
stitutional rights against the state’s power. When the state prosecuted
death eligible offenses, the trials occurred before all-white and all-
male juries,84 and often resulted in a conviction, death sentence,85 and
rapidly scheduled execution.86 Unquestionably, the defendant’s access
to effective representation would have thrown a wrench in these kan-
garoo court proceedings. In fact, on appeal, indigent defendants often
raised claims challenging the appointment or effectiveness of counsel,
but “more shocking legal infractions such as mob-dominated trials and
coerced confessions” overshadowed them.87
Yet, the Southern bar, with few exceptions, was unwilling to pro-
vide quality defense services to poor Black people charged with
crimes, let alone capital crimes.88 Community sentiment was such that
any local lawyer attempting to uphold the constitutional rights of
numbers of Black people began regularly serving on state and federal juries. See Alexis
Hoag, An Unbroken Thread: African American Exclusion from Jury Service, Past and
Present, 81 LA. L. REV. 55, 62–65 (2020).
84 EQUAL JUST. INITIATIVE, ILLEGAL RACIAL DISCRIMINATIONIN JURY SELECTION: A
CONTINUING LEGACY 12 (2010) (explaining that all-white juries continued to sentence
Black defendants to death into the 1980s, even after the Supreme Court outlawed systemic
exclusion of Black people from juries due to the discriminatory use of peremptory strikes);
see also Hoag,supra note 83, at 62–65.
85 See, e.g.,Moore, 261 U.S. at 89; Norris v. Alabama, 294 U.S. 587, 588 (1935); Brown
v. Mississippi, 297 U.S. 278, 279 (1936); Hale v. Kentucky, 303 U.S. 613, 615 (1938).
86 Between 1930 and 1972, 455 people were executed for rape. Of those, 405 (89.1%)
were Black. Moreover, 443 of the 455 of those executed were in former Confederate states.

U.S. at 90–92—which stemmed from the 1919 Elaine, Arkansas massacre, in which white
mobs killed several Black people over a labor dispute—the Black defendants included a
claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in their writ of habeas corpus. Without giving the
claim any weight, the Court overturned the murder conviction of the Black defendant
based on the mob-dominated proceedings instead. Likewise, the Court overturned the
murder conviction for a Black defendant in Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U.S. 278, 281–87
(1936), due to a coerced confession even though the defendant also raised ineffective
assistance of counsel for counsel’s failure to exclude the confession after the state
introduced it.

1510 NEW YORK UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol.96:1493
Black defendants would likely have been met with violence or profes-
sional and social rejection.89 Given the pervasive anti-Black racism in
the region, the Court’s recognition of the right to counsel of choice in
Powell considered the defendants’ particular need for counsel who
could elevate their humanity beyond the salacious criminal charges,
counsel who could provide meaningful and effective representation,
counsel who could see them.90 The Court’s decision indicated that for
a fair trial to occur, the defendant needed to be empowered to select
their own lawyer, a lawyer who could provide effective representation
in the face of threats of violence from a “tense, hostile, and excited”
public.91 The opinion repeatedly mentioned that the boys, all from out
of state, had neither friends nor relatives nearby to assist them.92 In
short, there were no Black people around to come to their defense.
At the time, none of Alabama’s law schools would accept, let
alone graduate, a Black student.93 By the late 1930s, there were only
four Black lawyers in the entire state.94 In 1925, the need for lawyers
willing to represent Black Alabamians was so great that Black people
formed the Protective National Detective Association.95 For an
annual membership fee, the Association provided Black Alabamians
free legal services in criminal and civil court until 1937, when the
Association ended.96 The first Black lawyer in the Birmingham Bar
89 See, e.g., Mann, supra note 88, at 145 (explaining that the few southern lawyers
willing to represent Black people could be subjected to “a wide range of adverse responses
including social ostracism, loss of clients, loss of employment, trumped-up criminal
charges, the threat of disbarment, and physical violence” (citation omitted)).
90 Ava DuVernay named her Netflix series When They See Us, based on the true story
of five Black and brown teenagers falsely accused of raping a white woman in Central Park
in 1989, to force viewers to recognize the boys’ individual humanity rather than lumping
them together, nameless, as “The Central Park Five,” which is how the media, at best,
referred to them. See Charles R. Lawrence III, Implicit Bias in the Age of Trump, 133

Association graduated from Howard Law School a decade and a half
later in 1947,97 and the first Black lawyer in Selma, also a Howard
graduate, started practicing in 1958.98 In fact, there was a dearth of
Black or friendly counsel anywhere in the region.99 Over three
decades after the first of the Scottsboro trials, the U.S. Commission on
Civil Rights reported that Southern lawyers and state officials
“continue[d] to distort the processes of public power so that Negro
citizens may not enjoy the legal equality promised them or exercise
the liberties assured them by the Constitution.”100 The report noted
that the Southern bar’s abdication of upholding and protecting the
rights of Black people in the justice system was “by no means exclu-
sively a southern problem.”101
With respect to the lack of Black representation, the Court
focused on the critical importance of counsel to a fair trial, referring to
defense counsel as “vital and imperative” to “due process within the
meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.”102 This was a relatively new
concept at the time. Although the trial judge had appointed counsel in
the case, the appointment was meaningless without the defendant’s
“fair opportunity to secure counsel of his own choice” and sufficient
time for counsel to adequately prepare a defense.103 The Court’s
insertion of choice in recognizing the right to counsel signaled that
autonomy was a significant part of actualizing the Sixth Amendment
right. Without autonomy to select their own lawyers, the defendants in
Powell were beholden to the trial court’s selection, which in this

instance “amount[ed] to a denial of effective and substantial aid.”104
The decision indicated that in some instances, the trial court could not
be trusted to appoint counsel to adequately protect defendants’ rights;
however, the defendant, whose life and liberty were at stake, could.105
C. Choice of Counsel Is a Central Component of the Right to
Counsel
In the decades following the Court’s acknowledgement of the
right to counsel in Powell, there was no question that the defendant’s
autonomy in selecting counsel was part of the constitutional guar-
antee. Even in reserving counsel of choice for those with means, the
Court reaffirmed that the right was firmly ensconced in the Sixth
Amendment’s right to counsel. In United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez,
the defendant sought to reverse his conviction after the trial court
erroneously denied his counsel of choice.106 Although the government
conceded that the trial court’s denial was erroneous, it disputed the
appropriate method of evaluating the violation. The government
argued that the violation was incomplete unless Gonzalez-Lopez
could show substitute counsel’s performance was deficient and that he
was prejudiced by the deficiency under Strickland v. Washington’s
two-prong ineffective assistance of counsel standard.107 Gonzalez-
Lopez had not made such a showing, but it did not matter: The Court
disagreed with the government’s position.
In reversing Gonzalez-Lopez’s conviction, the Court reasoned
that “[t]he right to select counsel of one’s choice . . . has been
regarded as the root meaning of the [Sixth Amendment] constitu-
tional guarantee.”108 Therefore, the denial of the right to counsel of
choice constitutes a denial of the right to counsel, which is a structural
error requiring reversal, so no Strickland prejudice showing was nec-
essary. The Court further explained that when the right to counsel is
disregarded, it does not matter that the trial—with substitute
counsel—was otherwise “fair.” The right to counsel of choice “com-

‘the root meaning’ of the Sixth Amendment”).

mands, not that a trial be fair, but that a particular guarantee of fair-
ness be provided—to wit, that the accused be defended by the counsel
he believes to be best.”109
In applying the structural error doctrine to counsel of choice, the
Court placed it firmly in the company of other “certain basic, constitu-
tional guarantees that . . . define the framework of any criminal
trial.”110 Therefore, the right to counsel of choice is one that
“‘affect[s] the framework within which the trial proceeds,’ rather than
being ‘simply an error in the trial process itself.’”111 In so holding, the
Court elevated the right to counsel of choice to a foundational compo-
nent of fairness in criminal adjudications. The Court reaffirmed as
much in Kaley v. United States a decade later: “[W]e have held that
the wrongful deprivation of choice of counsel is ‘structural error,’
immune from review for harmlessness, because it ‘pervades the entire
trial.’”112
That the right to counsel of choice is firmly positioned within the
Sixth Amendment right to counsel invites the question of why indi-
gent defendants do not enjoy the same right. Upon learning that they
do not have the same right to choose their own lawyer as defendants
with means, Chief Justice Roberts asked: “Why not?”113 The Court
has yet to fully answer that question.
D. Beggars Cannot Be Choosers
Since deciding Powell, the Court has expressed limitations and
qualifications on the right to counsel of choice; principal among them
is that the defendant must be able to afford counsel.114 Other limita-
tions, such as judicial efficiency and adequacy of appointed counsel,
exist concurrently with poverty. Despite the Court’s assertion that the
right to counsel is a necessity and not a luxury,115 the right to counsel
of choice is a luxury for those who can afford it. According to the
Court, beggars cannot be choosers.

110 Weaver v. Massachusetts, 137 S. Ct. 1899, 1907 (2017). Other examples of structural
error include using the defendant’s coerced confession against the defendant in a criminal
trial, depriving the defendant of counsel, trying the defendant before a biased judge, and
denying the defendant a public trial.

1. Limited Time
Much of the right to counsel of choice jurisprudence is concerned
with avoiding delay in the criminal adjudication process.116 A line of
cases caution that the defendant’s right is not absolute, and that a trial
court must weigh the right to counsel of choice “against the public’s
interest in the orderly administration of justice.”117 However, effi-
ciency over due process is in direct conflict with the reasoning in
Powell: Although the Court commended and encouraged prompt dis-
positions of criminal cases, it also cautioned that “a defendant . . .
must not be stripped of his right to have sufficient time” to prepare for
trial with counsel of choice.118 Shortly after Powell, the Court again
acknowledged that the trial court must give appointed counsel suffi-
cient time “to confer, to consult with the accused and to prepare his
defense”; otherwise, it “could convert the appointment of counsel into
a sham and nothing more than formal compliance with” the Sixth
Amendment.119
Efficiency and autonomy came to a head in Linton v. Perini.120
There, the trial court forced the defendant to proceed to trial with
appointed counsel after defendant’s retained counsel requested a con-
tinuance to adequately prepare for trial. The reviewing court acknowl-
edged that the two issues—“the right of choice of counsel” and “the
right to adequate time to prepare for trial”—were related.121 How-
ever, in reversing the conviction, the Sixth Circuit prioritized choice,
holding “[i]t is axiomatic that in all criminal prosecutions the accused
enjoys the right to have assistance of counsel for his defense, and
116 See, e.g., Lee v. United States, 235 F.2d 219, 221 (D.C. Cir. 1956) (the right to counsel
of choice “cannot be insisted upon in a manner that will obstruct an orderly procedure in
courts of justice, and deprive such courts of the exercise of their inherent powers to control
the same”); Lofton v. Procunier, 487 F.2d 434, 435 (9th Cir. 1973) (holding that a trial court
may refuse defendant’s counsel of choice when “the attempted exercise of choice is
deemed dilatory” and may “compel a defendant to proceed with designated counsel”).
117 Linton v. Perini, 656 F.2d 207, 209 (6th Cir. 1981) superseded on other grounds by
statute, 28 U.S.C. §2254, as recognized in Burton v. Renico, 391 F.3d 764 (6th Cir. 2004);
see also United States v. Burton, 584 F.2d 485, 489 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (same); Maynard v.
Meachum, 545 F.2d 273, 278 (1st Cir. 1976) (“The right to counsel of one’s choice is not
absolute. A court need not tolerate unwarranted delays, and may at some point require the
defendant to go to trial even if he is not entirely satisfied with his attorney.”); United States
v. Saldivar-Trujillo, 380 F.3d 274, 277 (6th Cir. 2004) (finding that the “public interest[] in

implicit in this guarantee is the right to be represented by counsel of
one’s own choice.”122 To be clear, Mr. Linton could afford his lawyer
of choice, underscoring that the right to choose is still only reserved
for those with means.
The Sixth Circuit’s reasoning in Linton makes clear that for a
defendant with means, the right to exercise autonomy outweighs judi-
cial efficiency. The reviewing court’s assigned weight also speaks to
the defendant’s differing avenues for relief when a trial court
encroaches on either of the defendant’s Sixth Amendment interests.
When the trial court forces substitute counsel on a defendant, the
defendant can allege that the court violated their right to counsel of
choice. However, when the trial court forces defense counsel to pro-
ceed without adequate preparation, the defendant’s only recourse is
alleging that counsel’s lack of preparation amounted to a violation of
the defendant’s right to effective counsel. As discussed elsewhere,
relief under the latter challenge—that counsel’s conduct was ineffec-
tive—is substantially more burdensome for the defendant to obtain.123
The pedestal on which reviewing courts place a defendant’s
autonomy should extend equally to defendants who qualify for
appointed counsel. Without the right to counsel of choice, an indigent
defendant is forced to go the second, more difficult route: challenging
counsel’s conduct as ineffective. Few defendants, regardless of finan-
cial means, prevail on ineffective assistance of counsel claims.124
Given this reality, the Court’s refusal to extend counsel of choice
could have more to do with the Court’s desire to quickly dispose of
such cases, a sort of doubling down on efficiency. Otherwise,
reviewing courts would be forced to grant new trials any time a trial
court denied an indigent defendant’s right to counsel of choice. But if
the legal system is genuinely concerned with upholding the Sixth
Amendment’s principle of autonomy,125 we should welcome those
corrections.
2. Adequacy of Substitute Counsel

tute counsel’s adequacy eliminates any potential constitutional viola-
tion, thereby removing it from the sacred realm of structural error.
Whereas, for defendants with means, it makes no difference that
replacement counsel is adequate; the trial court’s denial of the right to
choose is absolute. As discussed in Gonzalez-Lopez, the denial of the
right constitutes structural error warranting reversal.126 However, for
indigent defendants, when they seek redress for the violation,
reviewing courts generally use the harder to satisfy Strickland defi-
cient performance-prejudice standard.127 And because courts rarely
find adequate counsel deficient—let alone prejudice resulting from
any deficiency—an indigent defendant’s alleged violation is dead on
arrival.128 Meaning that so long as appointed counsel is adequate, indi-
gent defendants cannot demand another lawyer, even—in most
cases—when the relationship and representation sour.129 In other
words, the Court holds the right to counsel of choice for defendants
with means in higher regard than the right to counsel of choice for
indigent defendants.
The Court made the adequacy of counsel limitation on the right
to counsel of choice plain in Caplin & Drysdale v. United States.130
There, the Court explained that the Sixth Amendment right to
counsel of choice “guarantees defendants in criminal cases the right to
adequate representation, but those who do not have the means to hire
their own lawyers have no cognizable complaint so long as they are
adequately represented . . . .”131 And yet, indigent defendants have all
sorts of valid reasons to complain about otherwise adequate
126 See United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U.S. 140, 147–48.
127 This depends on the nature of the alleged violation. The court will apply Strickland if
the defendant raises an ineffective assistance of counsel claim for appointed counsel’s
conduct, which may have prompted the defendant to unsuccessfully move for substitute
counsel. However, if the defendant raises a denial of the right to counsel—because the
court refused to substitute counsel—the reviewing court will determine if defendant had
“good cause” for substitute counsel and if the trial court abused its discretion in denying
substitute counsel. See United States v. Marrero, 651 F.3d 453, 464 (6th Cir. 2011).
128 See Ossei-Owusu,supra note 87, at 1228–30.
129 See, e.g., Shaw v. United States, 403 F.2d 528, 529 (8th Cir. 1968) (finding vague
allegation of “lack of ‘rapport’ [and] . . . ‘communication’” between defendant and
appointed counsel insufficient to constitute ineffective representation where counsel was
otherwise “competent and skilled in the law”); Perez Goitia v. United States, 409 F.2d 524,

appointed counsel, such as a breakdown in communication,132 failure
to take a desired course of action,133 taking a course of action over
defendant’s protest,134 and outright hostility toward the defendant.135
Defendants’ complaints about counsel usually come before a
reviewing court as ineffective assistance of counsel claims and/or as an
improper denial of defendant’s request for substitute counsel. When
an indigent defendant requests substitute counsel, the trial court has a
duty to inquire about the source of defendant’s dissatisfaction.136 If
the trial court fails to find good cause for the substitution, the indigent
defendant is stuck with appointed counsel so long as there is no con-
flict of interest,137 a complete breakdown in communication,138 or an
irreconcilable conflict.139 Instances of these exceptions must be
extreme.
However, if the defendant had means, they could simply hire a
new attorney so long as the substitution did not unduly delay the pro-
ceedings. And if the trial court prevented the defendant with means
from substituting counsel, a reviewing court would deem the error
structural, warranting reversal. This is not so for indigent defendants.
Instead, they must suffer through representation by defense counsel
with whom they are experiencing discord. And for an indigent defen-

denial of habeas relief where defendant alleged, but did not prove, “a total breakdown of
communication” with counsel due to counsel’s inattention and lack of time spent on
sentencing hearing).
133 See, e.g., United States v. Goldberg, 67 F.3d 1092, 1098 (3d Cir. 1995) (affirming
denial of defendant’s request for substitute counsel where counsel failed to file “a host of
motions that Goldberg insisted be filed,” and trial court failed to find good cause for
substitute counsel).
134 But see McCoy v. Louisiana, 138 S. Ct. 1500, 1511 (2018) (granting new trial based on
violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel where defense counsel admitted
defendant’s guilt over defendant’s express and repeated objections).

assistance of counsel claim as procedurally defaulted where white trial counsel referred to

offer of life to client).

court has an obligation to inquire into source of dissatisfaction between defendant and

dant, there is no justiciable remedy for discord short of Strickland-
level ineffectiveness. Indigent defendants are stuck between a rock
and a hard place: The aspirational goals the Court articulated in
Gideon,140 and the nearly impossible-to-meet standard the Court
established in Strickland.141
Extending counsel of choice to indigent defendants could poten-
tially dislodge them from this untenable position between Gideon’s
unfulfilled promise and Strickland’s effective roadblock. Had the
Court adopted Justice Marshall’s dissenting opinion from Strickland,
the Court would be in a better position to extend counsel of choice to
low-income people. There, Justice Marshall suggested that if a defen-
dant could demonstrate that counsel performed deficiently, the
reviewing court must grant them a new trial, no showing of prejudice
would be necessary.142 Thus, defendant’s mere showing that counsel
was incompetent would be enough. Again, we should welcome these
corrections. Perhaps, if the Court could no longer rely on Strickland’s
difficult standard to prevent indigent defendants from regularly
receiving new trials, the Court would be more apt to extend choice to
indigent defendants. Because a denial of that right would also mean a
new trial, states would also need to be more aggressive about pro-
viding high quality counsel for indigent defendants.
3. Parity for Poor People
That the Court has placed indigent defendants on par with defen-
dants with means in other areas of criminal defense casts further
doubt on why the Court draws the line at counsel of choice. Relying
on the Fourteenth Amendment, the Court has held that due process
and fundamental fairness require the state to provide poor defendants
with a trial transcript if the state gives the defendant an opportunity to
appeal their case;143 prevents the state from charging an indigent
defendant a fee to file a notice of appeal;144 requires the state to pay
for defense counsel;145 and requires the state to provide indigent

defense counsel to low-income people charged with crimes).

defendants with a fair opportunity to present a defense, including
funding for expert services.146 In Gideon v. Wainwright, the Court
made plain that the assistance of defense counsel in the face of crim-
inal charges is a “necessit[y], not [a] luxur[y].”147 With all that is at
stake—liberty and, at times, life148—exercising choice in selecting
counsel should not be a privilege reserved for only those who can
afford it.
II
REPRESENTATION MATTERS
By relying on literature from other fields—clinical therapy and
education—this Part lays the foundation for Black on Black represen-
tation within indigent defense.149 These fields have long recognized
the unique insights and contributions people from non-dominant
racial and ethnic groups can offer, and the benefits that same-race
representation can provide racially marginalized and maligned clients
and pupils. Scholarship from these fields has examined the benefits of
racial diversity to better understand the populations they serve. As
explained more fully below, Black therapists and teachers—much like
Black public defenders—are more likely to have an awareness and an
understanding of the social meaning assigned to Black people and can
use that embodied empathy to the advantage of their same-race cli-
ents and pupils. Research shows that their very presence can put cli-
ents and pupils at ease, ultimately improving Black patient utilization
of counseling services150 and Black student performance.151

That these conversations are not already occurring in legal schol-
arship about indigent defense is problematic, particularly given the
demographics of the client and attorney populations.152 However, this
Article can begin the conversation and spur additional research recog-
nizing that Black public defenders may help better serve Black people
facing criminal charges and more effectively challenge anti-Black bias
in the criminal legal system.
A. Someone Who Understands: Black Therapists for Black Patients
Research on the relationship between Black patients and ther-
apists offers valuable insight into the dynamics that can exist between
a Black person charged with a crime and appointed counsel. The
clinical therapy community has widely accepted that in order to
improve mental health services for people of color, patients should be
matched with same-race counselors when possible.153 Research shows
that Black therapists are able to provide more culturally congruent
treatment given “their more nuanced understanding of Black commu-
nities”154 and that Black therapists are more likely to feel personally
invested in their Black patients.155 Most relevant for our purposes,
research shows that white counselors, relative to Black counselors,
have a harder time obtaining their Black patients’ trust.156 In a study
examining Black therapists who work with Black families, researchers
found that Black patients experience “positive outcomes when [their]

defense, racism, and inequality in criminal courts are notable exceptions. Each contains

therapists have an understanding of the history or experiences African
Americans have had to endure.”157
There are multiple parallels worth noting between clinical
therapy and indigent defense. Relative to white patients, Black
patients’ entry into mental healthcare counseling is more likely to
exist under emergency circumstances and/or “under coerced or man-
dated conditions rather than” being voluntary or self-referred.158 This
parallels Black people’s entry into the criminal legal system in which
individuals experience a highly stressful event (often an arrest fol-
lowed by criminal charges) and the court often appoints defense
counsel, rather than the individual electively retaining counsel. Like
the overrepresentation of Black people in the criminal legal system,
Black people are overrepresented in populations with mental health-
care needs,159 but disproportionately underrepresented in the mental
healthcare profession. Only 6.4% of social workers are Black, slightly
less than 4% of counseling professionals are Black, less than 2% of
doctoral-level psychologists self-identify as Black, and there are even
fewer Black psychiatrists.160 Akin to the way white public defenders’
anti-Black racial bias can negatively impact representation of Black
defendants, research suggests that white counselors’ racial biases and
stereotypes may account for mental healthcare disparities in Black
patients, including spending less time with Black patients, giving more
severe diagnoses to Black patients relative to identically presenting
white patients, and overmedicating Black patients.161
The robust research on the experiences of Black patients in
therapy has helped improve counseling for Black patients. The
research shows that Black patients with strong ethnic and cultural ties
to their race derive the greatest therapeutic benefits when they
receive “culturally congruent mental health services.”162 However, the

availability of Black therapists cannot meet the demand. As early as
2001, the Surgeon General recognized that “[t]he supply of African
American clinicians is important,” in part because Black patients tend
to underutilize services given “[f]eelings of mistrust and stigma or per-
ceptions of racism or discrimination.”163 Like in the legal profession,
there remains a dearth of Black therapists. Unlike the law, clinical
therapy has responded by embracing the need for all therapists who
work with patients of color, particularly Black patients, “to apply mul-
ticultural competencies” to improve patient utilization, retention, and
outcomes.164 To this end, the clinical therapy community has been
producing robust scholarship, training, and assessment on multicul-
tural counseling competency for decades.165

Black students.168 In 2010, relying on this association, the U.S.

discussion. Like in the criminal legal system, there is an overrepresen-
tation and concentration of Black people in many public schools rela-
tive to the population in the community. These demographic trends
are especially true in cities that experienced white flight to suburban
communities and private schools after court-ordered school desegre-
gation.170 Like with indigent defense counsel, there is an under-
representation of teachers of color, particularly Black teachers,
relative to the populations served in public schools.171 Again, like the
negative impact public defenders’ anti-Black bias has on their Black
clients, teachers’ anti-Black bias contributes to Black children being
suspended and expelled at higher rates than their non-Black class-
mates;172 research shows these disparities begin as early as pre-
same-race teachers); Dee, supranote 151, at 195 (noting that it was “conventional wisdom
among educators” that minority students performed better academically when taught by
minority teachers).

school.173 This can result in distrust of the very individuals whom the
student should be able to rely upon for guidance and support.
Given these troubling observations, it is no surprise that students
of color, particularly Black students, can benefit from receiving
instruction from teachers who share their race.174 These benefits
include improved attendance, academic achievement, less frequent
suspension and expulsion (likely reflecting Black teachers’ different
treatment and different interpretation of behavior), and increased
chance of obtaining higher education.175 Most researchers explain the
positive impact that same-race teachers can have on Black students in
one of two ways: passive or active.176 Passive teacher effect means that
the student derives a benefit from the teacher’s mere same-race pres-
ence, potentially viewing the teacher as a model for success.177
Researchers also note that passive teacher effect can help mitigate
stereotype threat—the situational predicament where an individual
fears confirming a negative stereotype about their social group.178 In
educational settings, stereotype threat can result in a Black student’s
lower academic performance in the face of a teacher’s lowered expec-
tations.179 Conversely, active teacher effect refers to proactive conduct
on the teacher’s part, such as spending more time interacting with stu-
dents of their same race, or in designing more culturally relevant (and
thus, potentially more engaging and relevant) course materials.180
These descriptive observations of same-race teachers’ impact on
Black students provide helpful insight into the dynamics between a
Black defender and indigent defendant. Borrowing the active/passive
effect framework allows us to form opinions on why and how the rela-
tionship can be beneficial. With regard to the active effect, a same-

race defender may be more likely to feel personally invested in a
Black client’s case, and as a result, spend more time with the client
and on the case, or be more aware of challenging race-based issues
that occur in the client’s case than a different-race defender. The find-
ings in Parts III and IV support these hypothetical scenarios, as does
existing research examining the opposite trend: Public defenders who
harbor anti-Black bias can have a detrimental impact on their clients’
cases because they tend to spend less time on these cases and fail to
raise potentially meritorious issues.181 With regard to the passive
effect, as discussed in Section IV.B, a Black lawyer’s mere physical
presence in court proceedings may mitigate stereotypes of criminality
and culpability that judges, jurors, and prosecutors subconsciously
apply to Black defendants who come before them.182 As described in
Part IV, Black lawyers may also more readily engender trust in their
clients, enabling their clients to disclose facts and information in sup-
port of the defense that the clients may otherwise avoid or be more
hesitant to disclose to non-racially congruent counsel. Thus, the
active/passive framework provides a helpful lens through which to
measure and test the impact of racially congruent representation.

EMBODIED EMPATHY
In this Part, I define “embodied empathy”—the unspoken famili-
arity between Black people given their shared experience with the
social meaning assigned to Black people in this country. While I iden-
tify a shared experience among Black people in this country, I also
recognize that same-race representation has limitations given the mul-
titude of differences among Black people and that some Black defen-
dants may not want a Black lawyer.183
Differences in class, gender, country of origin, and other coex-
istent identities can have varying degrees of impact on the way Black
people experience their race and ethnicity in this country.184

who recently immigrated from one of over fifty countries in Africa,
Latin America, the Caribbean, or elsewhere in the world.186 In turn,
first-generation Black people may have different experiences than
both American-born descendants of enslaved people and recent immi-
grants.187 Black people who are racially mixed may have an altogether
different experience than any of the previously identified
subgroups.188
Each of these differences can impact the experience and identity
formation of a Black person, which in turn, can factor into how they
relate to another Black person within the attorney-client relationship
context. These differences make clear that Black people and expe-
riences are not monolithic; nevertheless, there is a unifying Black
experience in this country given the institution of slavery and the
racial hierarchy that resulted—a hierarchy that is woven into the
nation’s social fabric and impacts all who reside here.189 This shared

A. I See You. I Hear You. I Understand.
Eye contact and the subtle lift or dip of the chin, exchanged from
across a crowded room, or while walking past one another. It is the
universal gesture among Black people, signaling recognition, commu-
nicating:I see you; I hear you; I understand. I too experience the social
meaning assigned to Black people. Without uttering a word, this
simple gesture can offer greeting, reassurance, validation, and affirma-
tion. It communicates empathy. Among and between Black people, I
call this exchange “embodied empathy.” Although the term embodied
empathy exists in psychotherapy,190 I use it here to mean the shared
knowledge of experiencing this country as a Black person.
This nation, built upon the backs of enslaved Black people, is still
stained with slavery’s legacy. Many of this nation’s institutions are
direct descendants of slavery: our system of capitalism,191 the organi-
zation of our communities,192 our education system,193 and our crim-

opening essay of The 1619 Project, “Anti-[B]lack racism [derived from
slavery] runs in the very DNA of this country.”195 In Policing the
Black Man, Bryan Stevenson describes “a narrative of racial differ-
ence that contaminates the thinking of most Americans. We are bur-
dened by our history of racial injustice in ways that shape [how] we
think, act, and enforce the law.”196 Thus, to exist as a Black person in
this nation can be a uniquely unifying experience. To better under-
stand this shared experience among Black people that can convey
empathy based on this shared understanding, I turn to two contempo-
rary authors who write about navigating America while Black.
In Heavy: An American Memoir, Kiese Laymon charts the pain,
joy, and danger of growing up in Jackson, Mississippi as a Black
person, and later, as a professor in upstate New York.197 His
Blackness is never not relevant, and the precariousness of his safety is
most acute relative to white people. Fresh from high school basketball
practice, Laymon and his teammates, also Black, congregate at the
local Red Lobster to watch a game.198 The news interrupts with
footage of a group of white police officers watching another group of
white police officers beat a Black man.
We watched the news replay the video four times. We all had cops
rough us up, chase us, pull guns on us, call us out of our names. We
all watched cops shame our mamas, aunties, and grandmamas. We
all floated down I-55 creating lyrical force fields from the police and
everything the police protected and served, rapping, “A young
n[***]a got it bad ’cause I’m brown.” But here we were, in one of
our safe spaces, watching white folk watch white police watch other
white police destroy our body.199
In that moment, Laymon and his friends are reminded that their
Blackness renders them vulnerable. Laymon’s white girlfriend then
arrives to pick him up, ignorant to the local news.200 He is tense and
different, failing to give her the greeting to which she is accus-
tomed.201 She senses something is off, but Laymon refuses to elabo-
rate and she drops him at home, angry about what she does not know,

what he cannot explain, and what she cannot understand.202 Although
Laymon could tell the girl with whom he is intimate, the girl he says
he loves, what transpired and where his head is at, something stops
him.203 To do so, he would have to explain too much, expend too
much effort, and expose himself. Worse, her response might come
from a place of pity instead of understanding. Laymon’s girlfriend
lacks an experiential awareness of being Black.
Ta-Nehisi Coates writes about the uniqueness of existing in the
world—specifically America—as a Black man in Between the World
and Me. In the book, a longform letter to his fifteen-year-old son,
Coates considers American-made racism and the violence and con-
straints it renders upon Black people. He muses: “[H]ow do I live free
in this [B]lack body?”204 After identifying a string of unarmed Black
men and boys killed by police officers, Coates warns his son:
The destroyers will rarely be held accountable. Mostly they will
receive pensions. And destruction is merely the superlative form of
a dominion whose prerogatives include friskings, detainings, beat-
ings, and humiliations. All of this is common to [B]lack people. And
all of this is old for [B]lack people. No one is held responsible.205
Although “the destroyers” are law enforcement, the law routinely
fails to hold them legally accountable for their misconduct toward
Black people, even when lethal.206 In the book’s opening pages,
Coates observes his son quietly retreat to his bedroom, crying at the
news report that Michael Brown’s killers will not be held accountable
for their actions.207 To dull any future pain his son will experience
when another unarmed Black person is killed at the hands of police,
Coates explains that such occurrences are ordinary, expected even. To
be Black is to know that such things predictably reoccur. This is the
lesson Coates must teach his son in America.208 As Bryan Stevenson
explains: “People of color in the United States, particularly young
[B]lack men, are burdened with a presumption of guilt and
dangerousness.”209

1530 NEW YORK UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol.96:1493
Embodied empathy is born from the shared experience of navi-
gating the social meanings attached to Black people in America. The
joys, the indignities, the celebrations, and the violence. It is intimate,
lived familiarity with experiencing America’s racial hierarchy that
formed during slavery, the impact of which is felt by Black people
regardless of whether one’s ancestors were held in bondage or immi-
grated voluntarily. Within the context of clinical therapy, Black “ther-
apists often see themselves as being culturally connected to their
[Black] clients, and having a shared cultural heritage and history can
lead to a unique therapeutic alliance between [Black] therapists and
[Black] clients.”210
This understanding and lived experience can add a greater and
necessary depth to the attorney-client relationship. One Black
defender described her exposure to certain life experiences as ena-
bling her to form deeper connections with Black clients: “Being a
child of parents who were incarcerated; . . . [I’ll share] whatever I have
to pull from my background.”211 Doing so communicates to her clients
that she understands, or at least has the ability to understand, what
they are experiencing. And like in clinical therapy, this knowledge and
experience can benefit Black defendants by engendering greater
embodied empathy on the part of same-race defenders.
B. Extending the Right
What if the law empowered indigent defendants to choose
counsel who they believed could best represent them? Some federal
appellate courts have concluded that the right to counsel “would be
without substance if it did not include the right to a meaningful
attorney-client relationship.”212
For many defendants, quality representation includes how well
counsel hears, believes, and understands them; and how well counsel
tells their story.213 Whether counsel is competent and has the capacity
to provide adequate representation—factors trial courts consider
when defendants request to substitute counsel—misses the mark. Fur-
ther, the Court frames these factors as a negative—the floor that
counsel should not fall below. Instead, a defendant may prioritize pos-
itive factors, such as a lawyer with the ability to overcome the pre-

sumption of dangerousness and criminality that society and the legal
system assign Black defendants. In fact, “[o]ur system of laws gener-
ally presumes that the criminal defendant . . . knows his own best
interests and does not need them dictated by the State.”214
These ideas are not unprecedented. In a 2008 article, Shani King
advocated for Black lawyers to represent Black clients in civil legal
service cases.215 King recommended that “[g]iven the fundamental
importance of the attorney-client relationship in securing favorable
outcomes for clients, legal services organizations . . . that serve large
populations of African American clients should employ staff attorneys
who are most likely to engender trust and facilitate communication

nized that extending the right would likely improve the attorney-client
relationship,217 their arguments led a small community in Texas to
enable indigent defendants to select counsel of their choosing among
a list of court approved lawyers.218 The one-year pilot program, the
first of its kind in the nation, appeared to work.219 Relative to non-
choice defendants, client choice defendants were more likely to per-
ceive that their lawyer treated them with respect.220 With regard to
outcomes, although most cases involved the defendant pleading guilty,
significantly more choice defendants pled to lesser charges, more
choice defendants went to trial than non-choice, and choice defen-

dants were more likely to receive a sentence of community service
rather than incarceration.221
These benefits to the outcomes of choice defendants’ cases
demonstrate that there may be something more at stake than merely
exercising agency, which by itself is still a worthy priority. These bene-
fits suggest that when a defendant is able to exercise choice, it fosters
trust; and with trust comes an improved attorney-client relationship,
which can offer multiple benefits, including better case outcomes. As
discussed below, enabling choice-driven racial congruency between
the defendant and counsel can also facilitate trust. And given the
racialized criminal legal system, trust within same-race representation
may provide significant improvements to the outcomes of Black indi-
gent defendants’ cases.
IV
BLACK ON BLACK REPRESENTATION
Should the law extend counsel of choice to indigent defendants, it
would enable low-income people charged with a crime the autonomy
to select the lawyer that they believe would best represent them.222
This Part explores why a Black indigent defendant might prioritize
racial congruency and cultural competency when selecting representa-
tion. The desire to match Black defendants with Black advocates for
improved representation is not a new concept. In the 1960s, the senti-
ment in under-resourced communities of color was that “there was
something unseemly about large numbers of [B]lack defendants being
appointed [white] lawyers who seemed to have little understanding of
their lives.”223 In 1978, Judge John D. Fauntleroy, one of Washington,
D.C.’s first Black judges, chastised the esteemed Public Defender
Service for its failure to hire Black lawyers: “When you’re dealing
with these community problems (in Superior Court) you need people
who understand the community.”224
As discussed in Part III, Black public defenders may be better
situated to represent their client’s humanity before the court given
their shared understanding of the social meanings attached to Black
people in this country. Research demonstrates that Black public

defenders harbor less anti-Black bias than do their non-Black col-
leagues.225 Black public defenders, more often than their white col-
leagues, have direct or indirect exposure to communities similar to
those their clients are from and exposure to similar life experiences.226
In a criminal justice policy recommendation to the Biden
Administration, the Black Public Defender Association explained that
Black public defenders who “come from communities most dispropor-
tionately impacted by the criminal legal system” are “necessary to
fight against racism and end mass incarceration.”227 Sameness,
whether stemming from race, sexuality, or some other shared identity,
can inspire connection, often helping people “establish rapport, trust,
and engagement.”228
This Part presents firsthand accounts from Black public defenders
about how they perceived their shared race with their clients—given
the social meanings assigned to race—impacted the formation of the
attorney-client relationship, improved representation, and mitigated
anti-Black bias. As demonstrated below, same-race representation
may lead to more thorough investigation, more robust case theory
development, and better development and presentation of mitigating

evidence at sentencing. These factors are critical to effective represen-
tation under the Sixth Amendment.
A. The Attorney-Client Relationship
The initial meeting is a critical moment in the formation of the
attorney-client relationship that can set the stage for the remainder of
representation. This meeting is often brief, stressful, and transactional
given counsel’s immediate need to obtain information about the case
against the client. However, it is critical for defense counsel to lay the
foundation for an effective attorney-client relationship during this first
interaction.229 When a Black defendant is paired with a non-Black
defense lawyer, it is necessary to first break through a cross-racial bar-
rier to develop the relationship.230 By contrast, a same-race defender
can immediately begin to establish a deeper professional connec-
tion.231 The head of one public defender office explained that when
she establishes an initial bond with a same-race client, they can jump
right into discussing the substance of the case.232
For some Black defendants, simply laying eyes on a Black
defender can put them at ease. One defender described the district
courthouse she practices in as “overwhelmingly white. [It] has a nega-
tive reputation with [defendants] of color, especially Black people . . .
[T]he judges are all white, the prosecutors are all white, the sheriffs
are all white, the courtroom personnel is all white . . . my personnel in
the public defender office is mostly white.”233 Thus, “when they see
me . . . I’m the only voice that [they] have that can identify with
[them].”234 A federal defender from a major metropolitan jurisdiction
explained the impact her appearance and slight Caribbean accent
have on her clients, many of whom are Black Caribbean. “[T]hey feel
more comfortable.”235 She notices her clients observe that she wears
229 See ABA STANDARDS, supra note 40, at Standard 4-3.3(a) (“In the initial meeting
with a client, defense counsel should begin the process of establishing an effective
attorney-client relationship. This includes assuring the client of confidentiality [and]
establishing trust . . . .”).
230 See Bryant, supra note 18, at 42 (“Lawyers and clients who do not share the same
culture face special challenges in developing a trusting relationship in which genuine and
accurate communication can occur.”).
231 But see Defender No. 10 (“My Blackness, my womanness, my relative appearance of
youth, gets them more concerned in some ways. [They think]: ‘She’s young, she’s Black,
she’s a she. She doesn’t know what she’s doing. She’s going to let the judge run all over
her.’ And so I’m aware that’s probably what they’re coming to the table with [and that I
have to address these concerns in my advocacy.]”).

her hair naturally, in locs.236 “[Their thinking is:] If you have some
understanding of where I come from, then this is going to be some-
thing that you care about and pay attention to, and are invested in. As
opposed to you thinking that I am someone so different from you, and
forgettable in some way.”237 Research shows that the inverse is true,
anti-Black bias can result in a defender being less invested and
spending less time on a Black defendant’s case, which can then impact
a defendant’s willingness to share information that could help advance
the defense.238
In these examples, the lawyers’ mere presence engendered trust
with their same-race clients. Race in these instances acted as a lifeboat
amid potentially hostile, biased waters. This lifeline—the initial con-
nection—can then translate into meaningful differences in representa-
tion. As discussed below, the bond can help open the lines of
substantive communication that may otherwise remain closed to or
misunderstood by non-Black or less culturally aware counsel.
1. Quality of Communication
Communication is a key aspect of the attorney-client relationship
and a central feature of the Sixth Amendment right to effective
counsel. One of defense counsel’s core duties is “to communicate and
keep the client informed and advised of significant developments and
potential options and outcomes.”239 Yet, problems with communica-
tion are the most frequent basis of bar complaints against lawyers.240
Within criminal defense, a breakdown in communication can result in
the deprivation of the right to counsel.241 It can also serve as good
cause for the court to grant a defendant’s motion to substitute

information helpful to the case).

counsel.242 This Subsection demonstrates how same-race representa-
tion can ease communication between the attorney and client and sub-
stantively benefit the client’s case.
The few studies that measure indigent defendant satisfaction
reveal that communication problems abound.243 Research shows that
differences in race, gender, class, and other cultural identities can
create barriers to communication.244 To compensate for race-based
barriers in communication with their clients, some lawyers rely on
non-white colleagues, often non-lawyers, to act as cultural translators.
One public defender was the only Black lawyer in her office when
hired, despite practicing in a jurisdiction where approximately ninety
percent of her clients are Black.245 “I’ve had situations, right before a
trial, [where] my white colleague [asked]: There’s no way we should
be going to trial. All the evidence is against us. I can’t get through to
my client. Can you talk to them?”246 Although she often agreed to
speak with her colleagues’ clients in these instances, she lamented that
those situations can be difficult because she does not know the facts of
the case, the investigation, nor the viability of the case for trial.247 A
supervising defender with whom I spoke shared an example from her
practice:
There was someone in lockup and one of my [supervisee] attorneys,
who was white, was having a difficult time communicating [to the
Black client] what the judge had just said during conference. He
asked me . . . to help him explain it to the client because the client
thought that my attorney was “selling him out” . . . . All he was
doing was relaying what the judge told him to inform his client. By
me coming back there, I was like, “look, no one is trying to sell you
out. We’re not working with the system. We’re not working with the
judge. We are here to help you.” . . . [M]e being there; the tension
just went down. [I was able to bring a sense of] familiarity.248
However, there is something lost between the lawyer and the
client when the lawyer is unable to serve as the primary source of
242 Benitez v. United States, 521 F.3d 625, 632 (6th Cir. 2008) (noting trial court has an
obligation to inquire into source of dissatisfaction between defendant and counsel, and
may grant motion to withdraw or substitute counsel if there is a showing of good cause).
243 See, e.g., Campbell et al., supra note 18, at 761–63 (finding common themes among
defendants’ complaints, including perception that their public defenders did not listen to
them, spent little and low-quality time with them, did not inform them about what would
happen during upcoming court proceedings, and did not inform them about certain rights).

information about the case. This barrier can corrode trust and disrupt
the relationship.
Same-race representation can negate the need for a cultural
translator and allow the attorney and client to establish trust more
readily. The head of a state office, who is Black, discussed a case she
worked on with co-counsel who were white. She shared an anecdote
from the client’s perspective who described a shift in representation
when she joined the team: “He was often told ‘that doesn’t make
sense’ or ‘you shouldn’t say that,’ when it was things I picked up on
automatically and said: ‘well no, that makes perfect sense. I get it.’”249
Her presence on the team and the information she gathered from the
client helped shape the theory of defense.250
2. Development of Trust
Another foundational component of the attorney-client relation-
ship is trust. The ABA Standards instruct criminal defense attorneys,
“[i]mmediately upon appointment . . . to establish a relationship of
trust and confidence” with the client.251 The Court has recognized that
crucial “decisions can best be made, and counsel’s duties most effec-
tively discharged, if the attorney and the defendant have a relation-
ship characterized by trust and confidence.”252 Just as cross-racial
representation can create a barrier to communication, it can also serve
as an obstacle to establishing trust.253 Conversely, same-race represen-
tation provides the potential for lawyers and clients to develop a
trusting relationship based on a perception of shared experiences and
understanding.
Many of the Black public defenders with whom I spoke explained
that their same-race clients perceived them to be less a “part of the
system” and thus more trustworthy than their white colleagues.254

1538 NEW YORK UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol.96:1493
This reflects the fact that many Black indigent defendants racialize the
system as white. Thus, when Black defenders and their Black clients
appear together amidst the overwhelmingly white demographics of
the courtroom—where the judges, prosecutors, and court officers are
often all white—it creates a sense of solidarity between them.255
“There is a different relationship that’s built [between my Black cli-
ents and me] . . . . They trust me [because] they see nothing but white
. . . in the courtroom.”256 This perceived distance between Black
public defenders and the “system” enables Black indigent defendants
to more readily develop trust with their same-race defenders. One
defender described the currency her race plays when interacting with
her clients over the phone. Given the nature of her practice—in court
daily—she often “meets” her clients for the first time over the phone.
“Over the phone, they think I’m a white girl [so] I have to let them
know, I have to identify myself [as a Black woman], because it defi-
nitely changes the tone and tenor [of the conversation].”257 After
revealing her race and referencing a shared experience, she immedi-
ately hears a shift in her clients’ voices and notices that they tend to be
more open and forthcoming with information after the disclosure.258
B. Black Defenders Can Mitigate Anti-Black Bias
As set forth below, Black public defenders may be able to more
readily see, hear, and understand their Black clients and, as impor-
tantly, Black clients tend to more readily see, hear, and understand
their Black lawyers.259 At each turn in the system, a Black indigent
defendant faces potentially hostile decisionmakers whose anti-Black
bias may cloud judgment and detrimentally impact the defendant’s
case.260 Public defenders, like all of us, harbor anti-Black bias.261 Such
In it, he described the common sentiment of Black clients that the system is racist and

bias can manifest in small or large ways, such as defense counsel mis-
taking another Black person in a courtroom for their client,262 or in
negotiating a less favorable plea agreement on behalf of a Black client
relative to an otherwise similarly situated white client.263 However,
research shows that Black defenders harbor less anti-Black bias than
do their non-Black counterparts.264 Moreover, Black defenders may
be more likely to recognize racism and raise race-based challenges by
virtue of their experience as Black people. In this way, Black defense
counsel are particularly well-situated to challenge anti-Black racial
bias whenever it arises in the client’s case.265 This Section argues that
Black public defenders can serve as a safeguard against anti-Black
racial bias in the criminal legal system.
Given their intimate understanding of the social meaning
assigned to Black people in this country, Black defenders may have
both the legal and experiential awareness to challenge anti-Black
racism in their client’s case. Conversely, “a white attorney who repre-
sents a client of color may not be prepared to fully relate to the client
if she approaches the client with a set of assumptions that do not apply
beyond her dominant culture.”266 Black public defenders with whom I
spoke shared examples where they believe their shared race helped
their advocacy on behalf of Black clients. For instance, a defender
now serving as the executive director of an office recalled a case
involving a young Black client facing serious felony charges. The
defender joined two white lawyers who the court had already
appointed. There was a “difference in how [the client] felt when he
had lawyers who were not his same race, and then . . . that changed
overwhelming white, often perpetuate the court system’s racial abuses when interacting
with their indigent clients, who are overwhelmingly Black).

She recalled that her representation “allowed [the client] to open up
more. It allowed him to feel heard and understood.”268 As a result, the
defense team had a more robust picture of the client, the defense, and
mitigation. Just as significant, the client felt better represented.
Black defenders’ mere presence in the courtroom may also miti-
gate the impact of or dissuade the prosecution and/or trial judge from
engaging in anti-Black racism. As discussed above regarding the bene-
fits of same-race representation in education, this is known as passive
effect, where the mere presence of a teacher—or public defender—of
the same race can render a benefit.269 A Black lawyer’s presence may
provide a powerful antidote to the presumption of criminality and
dangerousness that society, including jurors, judges, and prosecutors
assign to Black people. Professor and legal historian Kenneth Mack
observes that Black civil rights lawyers had the power through their
“brilliant” performances in Southern courts to transform the thinking
of white observers.270 Research on race in the legal profession and its
impact on criminal cases shows that “more persons of color making
decisions in the justice system” can “mitigate disparities in justice out-
comes.”271 A study on sentencing indicated that when “consciousness
and awareness of racial discrimination [are] elevated” among “deci-
sion makers [who are] members of underrepresented groups,” it can
have a positive outcome on defendants of color.272
When facing a Black defense attorney, prosecutors may also be
less likely to rely on race when exercising peremptory strikes to
remove prospective jurors. In response to a Black defender’s Batson
v. Kentucky challenge,273 trial judges may think more critically about a
prosecutor’s purported race-neutral reasoning for removing a non-
white juror. Black defenders may also be more likely to object to a

prosecutor’s use of racially coded and dehumanizing language,
whereas a non-Black defender may remain silent because such lan-
guage may not register as offensive or unlawful.274 The impact defense
counsel’s race may have on the prosecutor’s and judge’s actions
regarding racial discrimination in jury selection is an area ripe for
additional research.
Black defenders may also be more attuned than white defenders
to recognizing their client’s humanity beyond the criminal charges.275
This can impact counsel’s temporal investment and performance
throughout the case.276 One appellate defender whose client popula-
tion is exclusively Black men explained that she observes a difference
between the way her Black clients interact with her and with her white
colleagues.277 For example, one client “is very open with me and tells
me the truth, and when he is speaking with [my white colleague] he is
stern, reserved, and professional . . . [and] he’s [no longer] forth-
coming.”278 She recognizes that the client’s openness is beneficial to
her as an advocate, and more importantly, to the case because the
information from her client informs the issues in the appeal and the
way she presents the client’s narrative before the court.279
Investigation and presentation of mitigating evidence during a
client’s sentencing hearing—in both capital and non-capital cases—is
part of constitutionally effective representation.280 The goal of such
evidence is to humanize the client beyond the criminal conviction and
secure a favorable outcome on behalf of the client. In a capital case,
when the defendant is Black, the necessity to humanize the client is

heightened given the tendency for jurors—who are overwhelmingly
white281—to rely on race to render harsher punishment to Black
defendants.282 In non-capital cases, such evidence is vital to help Black
defendants combat presumptions of future dangerousness and to
address the propensity for rehabilitation.283 For Black clients, this
means counsel must be able to investigate and understand the impact
that race, ethnicity, and culture have had on the client’s life.284 To per-
form these tasks effectively, counsel must have cultural compe-
tency.285 Given their experiential awareness of the central role that
race plays in a person’s life, Black defenders often have the baseline

their same-race clients.

to accommodate their requests for same-race representation given the
demographics of the legal profession and public defenders. And what
of women defendants, defendants who identify as lesbian, gay,
bisexual, transgender, or queer, or defendants from any other non-
dominant group who may want an attorney who shares their identity,
or a heightened understanding of their identity, to represent them?
They too should have the option to choose counsel with cultural com-
petency, a lawyer who they can trust and who understands them.
These are skills the Supreme Court should deem part of general com-
petency and the ability to provide adequate defense representation.
However, no other group of marginalized people has the same pre-
sumption of criminality, dangerousness, and irredeemability assigned
to them as do Black people.286 This is why this Article focuses on the
experiences of Black indigent defendants and why same-race repre-
sentation is critical.
That said, this Article does not assume that all Black indigent
defendants would select Black lawyers if given the autonomy to
choose counsel, nor does it assume that a Black defense lawyer would
automatically better serve a Black client. Instead, pragmatically, a
Black defendant may want a white lawyer because Black lawyers may
face the very same anti-Black bias in the courtroom as Black indigent
defendants.287 One Black public defender in the South recalled a pre-
arraignment meeting with a new client, who was Black. The client was
older and had several contacts with the criminal legal system over the
decades. Upon laying eyes on appointed counsel, the client yelled: “I
want a Jew!”288 A head of office conveyed the sentiments she wit-
nesses coming from some of the Black indigent defendants in the
Midwest jurisdiction where she practices.
286 See MUHAMMAD, supra note 34, at 35–87 (“When Hoffman announced that
Chicago’s ‘Italians, Polanders and Russians’ lived under conditions ‘without question more
severe’ than [B]lacks, and [B]lacks still showed the ‘most decided tendency towards crime
in the large cities,’ he unequivocally marked the [B]lack urban migrant as a criminal of
exceptional measure.” (quoting FREDERICK L.HOFFMAN, RACE TRAITSAND TENDENCIES
OFTHE AMERICAN NEGRO (1896))).

1544 NEW YORK UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol.96:1493
Black clients are highly aware of the way white attorneys are
treated by judges, court officers, [and] prosecutors. They get it. They
get what white privilege is . . . they see it. And sometimes they want
that kind of representation. Because they’re making a calcul[ated
decision] about [it] . . . “This is a court appointed lawyer, I’m
already . . . screwed, but . . . is there a way that . . . this [white]
person is gonna do [right] for me?” And even if they have doubts
about whether or not . . . [a white] attorney . . . is really for them,
they recognize that . . . whiteness lets that attorney do more than
maybe a Black attorney [c]ould.289
Black defendants may also want a white lawyer because they
view Black lawyers as less competent than white lawyers given their
own internalized racism.290 However, giving indigent defendants the
autonomy to choose counsel addresses these concerns. The expansion
of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice would enable all
indigent defendants to select the lawyer who they believe would best
represent them. For a Black defendant, this may mean a non-Black
defense lawyer.
Conversely, Black defendants may overwhelmingly want Black
lawyers to represent them. The system is not equipped to handle such
a demand due to the underrepresentation of Black people in the legal
profession, and specifically in the indigent defense community. The
high demand for Black representation could create a Black “tax,”
resulting in burdening Black public defenders with even higher
caseloads beyond the systemic burdens of indigent defense work. A
similar phenomenon occurs in academia where faculty of color are
underrepresented. When hired, faculty of color “are often expected to
occupy a certain set of [additional] roles: to serve as mentors, inspira-
tions, and guides” and to serve as “the racial conscience of their insti-
tutions.”291 Those in higher education refer to these duties as
“invisible labor,”292 which can detract from faculty of color’s ability to
perform the primary duties for which the institution hired them. Like-
wise, even higher caseloads requiring more emotional investment
could prove detrimental to the quality of work Black defenders are
able to perform.
289 Defender No. 10.
290 One Defender, describing initial meetings with indigent Black clients, remarked:
“When I was a younger attorney, there was some skepticism. Everyone has a vision of what
a lawyer looks like, and unfortunately, because we’re already in the minority in the legal
field and in the public defender field, people expect an older, white haired man to walk
into the room.” See Defender No. 3.

There may also be differences in class and education level
between Black lawyers and their indigent clients.293 Despite the uni-
fying social meaning attached to Black people in this country, class-
and education-level divisions can result in different experiential
awareness. Professor Mack discusses the tension that Black civil rights
lawyers experienced when thrust into a representative role for their
clients.294 However, one defender, acknowledging the obvious differ-
ences between herself and her Black clients, explained how their
sameness trumped those relatively minor divisions.
[T]hey know our backgrounds are different, they know that we
didn’t necessarily grow up in the same neighborhood, or they under-
stand that I’m educated and maybe they’re not, or we’re from dif-
ferent regional places, but they also have the comfort that they
don’t have to explain their humanity to me. That part I get. Right? I
have Black sons, so they don’t have to explain to me that they are a
man. We can just talk about the case.295
Instead of expending energy overcoming the presumption of
criminality and dangerousness that society assigns to Black people,296
the defender and her client can dive directly into the case. This is less
likely to occur as seamlessly for non-Black defenders.
Black people’s diverse experiences and the potential for a Black
tax do not negate the utility of research and analysis on how counsel’s
race may impact indigent representation. Nor do these concerns
eclipse the benefit that many Black defendants can derive from same-
race representation. This research is more developed in other con-
texts, such as political science. In Behind the Mule: Race and Class in
African-American Politics, Michael Dawson developed the concept of
“linked fate” to describe Black people’s political cohesion motivated
by the perception that the individual’s fate is linked to the shared
identity group’s interests when making political decisions, like
voting.297 Despite the myriad differences among Black people—

294 MACK,supra note 270, at 4–5 (“[A] representative [B]lack person often had to be as
unlike most members of the minority group as possible. Black Americans themselves often

person—someone as much like the masses of [B]lack people as possible.” Id. at 5.

Dawson closely studied economic difference—Black people “have
displayed extraordinary political unity in their voting decisions” since
the 1960s.298
Although Dawson recognized the diversity among Black people in
America, he argued that “the strength of individuals’ sense of responsi-
bility to each other and to the community as a whole” trumped the
differences.299 Subsequent empirical analysis on identity group cohe-
sion shows that Black people, relative to Hispanic people, non-
Hispanic white people, and Asian people, demonstrate the greatest
group cohesion.300 Taken to a broader context, it is the phenomenon
that one’s prospects are linked to the success of the race. Dawson’s
theory is instructive here, where Black public defenders may be moti-
vated to zealously represent their Black clients out of a shared sense of
linked fate. As one Black public defender described it: “[I]t’s me and
you up here [in court]. We’re standing together as a team. We are a
united front against everything that’s coming at us . . . .”301
D. Opportunity for Growth
Although the ideas in this Article may appear provocative and
radical to some, they are not unattainable nor unreasonable. Exam-
ining the potential benefits that expanding choice could bring to Black
indigent defendants helps advance discourse on undertheorized areas
of the criminal law and practice.
The ideas in this Article make clear that more research is needed
on racially congruent representation and on exercising choice of
counsel from the client’s perspective. As a general matter, there is a
dearth of qualitative research on indigent defendants’ experiences and
perceptions.302 Much of the existing research on indigent defense
survey question, “Do you think that what happens generally to the [B]lack people in this
country will have something to do with what happens in your life?”). I thank Kendall
Thomas for introducing me to Dawson’s work.

focuses on quantitative data regarding charging and sentencing. How-
ever, there is limited information and analysis on client perceptions of
representation and on attorney-client relationships.303 Such research
could help advance the argument for expanding counsel of choice to
indigent defendants and for increasing racial diversity among indigent
defense providers.
The ideas in this Article also encourage greater attention to how
jurisdictions might implement choice of counsel for indigent defen-
dants. Even without a constitutional mandate, local jurisdictions can
begin to explore this possibility.
Although the Comal County pilot program was small in scope,
the results seemed to indicate defendants who chose their own lawyer
experienced better case outcomes relative to their non-choice coun-
terparts, including shorter sentences.304 Enabling choice may be eas-
iest in small and rural jurisdictions, where the court appoints counsel
to indigent defendants from a list of private attorneys. As Schulhofer
and Friedman theorized, appointed counsel would have incentives to
offer higher quality services so that defendants select them.305
However, in larger jurisdictions where the local government and/
or non-profit organizations provide indigent defense representation,
extending choice would be more of an undertaking. In those settings,
defendants might select counsel from a list of employees from a cer-
tain agency; such a list might include details about each lawyer’s back-
ground, experience, and specialized training. With clients driving the
selection process, indigent defense providers would need to conform
their hiring, training, and services to better meet client demands. This
would necessarily include cultural competency training and hiring
public defenders from populations that are more reflective of the cli-
ents served.
CONCLUSION
Regardless of whether the Court extends the right to counsel of
choice to indigent defendants, perhaps benefiting Black defendants,
there is still a dearth of Black public defenders. The arguments in this
Article require indigent defense providers to prioritize recruiting
more Black lawyers and instituting cultural competency training to
ensure that all lawyers can provide effective cross-cultural representa-
tion. Such training is largely absent from many public defender

offices. However, these priorities cannot start in practice. Law schools
have an obligation to prioritize diversity in the profession and to pre-
pare students for practice. Although cross-cultural lawyering has long
been promoted in clinical legal education,306 many law students grad-
uate without ever having enrolled in a clinic.307 Moreover, the rele-
vant doctrinal courses—criminal law, criminal procedure, and
evidence—fail to adequately prepare students for client-facing
work.308 In these ways, improving the representation options for
Black indigent defendants will ultimately improve representation for
all indigent defendants.
