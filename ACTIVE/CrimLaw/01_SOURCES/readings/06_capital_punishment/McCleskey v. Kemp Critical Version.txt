whatthestudies’findingsdiscloseabouttheconductofprosecutorsandjurors.
In Georgia and many other jurisdictions, the choice to seek the death penalty
belongs to prosecutors. As such, it is possible to use data to analyze the exercise of
prosecutorialdiscretionasasourceofpotentialbias.Ifaprosecutorchoosestoseek
the death penalty, the jury is given the option of recommending a death sentence,
and the judge has the power to adopt that recommendation. We are thus mindful
that evidence that a prosecutor’s decisions produced racially disproportionate out-
comesacrossdefendantsofvariousraceswouldnot,withoutshowingdiscriminatory
intent,establishanequalprotectionviolation.Forjuries,bycontrast,thereisnoeasy
way to gather information on whether a particular juror’s racial animus affected
deliberations.Thoughthestudiesincludenodataonthedeliberationsofindividual
juries,wewouldberemissnottorecognizethatjurydeliberations,likeotherformsof

(1985).ThisCourthasadditionallyheldthatgovernmentalactionscreatingdispro-
portionate racial impacts do not automatically result in violations of the Equal
Protection Clause. See, e.g., Personnel Administrator of Massachusetts v. Feeney,
442U.S.256(1979);Washingtonv.Davis,426U.S.229(1976).Moreover,inFeeney,
weexpresslystatedthatweshouldattributediscriminatorypurposetogovernmental

“at least in part ‘because of,’ not merely ‘in spite of’ its adverse effects upon an

doso becausea narrow interpretation ofdiscriminatory intent is inconsistent with
whatweknowaboutthecomplexwaysinwhichracismoperates.Therenowexists

The primary issue raised by Derrick Bell is that of the lack of client voice in
Civil Rights litigation – but there is more to the story. Brown was notable for its
use of expert testimony as evidence of the social impact current laws have on
a community. Nevertheless, the way expert witnesses were used still limited
justicetothenarrowperspectivesofpredominantlywhite,male,privileged,legal-
trained minds. The lawyers and judges involved in Brown identified the problem
and solution, and merely used experts to help them implement it. See, e.g., Bell,
Two Masters, 85 YALE L.J. at 482 (discussing NAACP’s retention of experts to
develop proposal for process of school integration). If, however, child psycholo-
gists, sociologists, education experts, and educators, parents, and students from
within impacted communities had been more involved from the beginning in
identifying the root causes of unequal education, then subsequently assisting in
identifying solutions based on their combined experience and expertise, the law
could have been a mechanism for implementing effective solutions backed by
relevant experience and knowledge.
These critiques and the hard-learned lesson that comes with them are no less
applicableinthiscase.InBrown,weconsideredtheconstitutionalityofasystemof
education.Suchasystemisinformedbythecultural,social,andhistoricalcontexts
in which it was designed, built, and implemented. Here, we are considering the
constitutionalityofasystemofpunishment.Thissystemislikewiseinformedbythe

mented.Legalprofessionals,ontheirown,cannotbeexpectedtointuitivelyunder-

The shortcomings described in the above section regarding the use of experts
notwithstanding, this Court and lower courts have an extensive record of acknow-
ledgingthevalueofexpertsintheirabilitytobringextra-legalexpertiseintoabodyof

noted that Supreme Court “cases make it unmistakably clear that ‘[s]tatistical
analyses have served and will continue to serve an important role’ in cases in
which the existence of discrimination is a disputed issue.” Id. at 339–40 (citing

TeamstersinHazelwoodSch.Dist.v.UnitedStates,433U.S.299,307(1977),holding
that statistics demonstrating a gross disparity between the percentage of minority
employees and minorities in the labor pool could be sufficient for a finding of
systemicdisparatetreatment.
Implicit in the reasoning in the Teamsters and Hazelwood decisions is the
acknowledgment that discriminatory intent is not as simple as an overtly biased
person or group of people intentionally deciding to treat a protected group differ-
entlythan others. While these were both employment cases, discrimination is not
limited to the workplace, as is apparent in the breadth of types of discrimination
cases. See, e.g., Bazemore, 478 U.S. 385, 400 (1986) (acknowledging the value of
multiple regression statistical studies in identifying discrimination); Castaneda
v. Partida, 430 U.S. 482, (1977) (using statistics in grand jury representation case);
Furman v.Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 92 S. Ct. 2726 (1972) (using statistics toevaluate
discriminatoryapplicationofdeathsentence).Asdiscussedinmoredepthbelow,it
would be absurd tofollow toapply a broaderapproachtointent whenlivelihoods
and working conditions are at stake, but not when actual lives are hanging in the
balance. When identifying discrimination in any setting, the nuanced realities of
“intent” and discrimination must be acknowledged, and the way to incorporate
anuancedunderstandingoftherelationshipbetweenintentionanddiscrimination
intocourtproceedingsisbybringinginexpertsfromoutsidethelegalfield.Asstated

acourt’slimitedabilitytounderstanddiscriminatoryintent.
ThechallengethencomesinapplyingtheFREswhendeterminingwhichexpert

(1975).Whiletheremainingrulesregardingexpertwitnessesdiscusstheprocedures
and limitations of this evidence, nothing in the language of the rules explains the
correctprocesstodistinguish“scientific,technical,orotherspecializedknowledge”
from laymen knowledge. Nor does any language of the rules give guidance on
identifying someone “qualified as anexpert byknowledge, skill,experience, train-

imprudent to use the data as proof of discriminatory purpose among members of
the jury. That position, however, misunderstands the nature of social science
research, which typically reveals a causal inference between two conditions, such
as race considerations and the imposition of the death penalty. Empirical data,
however, rarely establishes to an absolute certainty a “but for” relationship or
“counterfactual dependence” between two conditions. The dissent also ignores
that the Court has found the type of multiple regression analysis used in the
Baldus studies to be compelling within other contexts. See Bazemore v. Friday,
478 U.S. 385, 400–01 (1986) (Brennan, J., concurring in part, assessing such data

A number of the dissenting justices are unwilling to acknowledge that impact
evidence should be used in death penalty cases, even though it is considered in
employment and jury strike cases, because those situations are different. Those
situations are different, but in ways that make the argument for allowing impact

quences that often attach to decisions within capital sentencing, it is additionally
appropriate for the Court to consider evidence that race has previously been
explicitly considered and is currently being taken account of in a systemic or
structural manner. Analysis of systemic evidence questions whether beliefs and
motivations connected to race are likely key to explaining the existing disparate
conditions. This query is valid irrespective of the Court’s inability to locate and
assign blame for racial bias to a particular individual. Given the prevalence of
historic race discrimination in criminal justice systems throughout
U.S. jurisdictions, if the Baldus studies or other research strongly support
a contention that race is having a significant, measurable effect on punishment
outcomes, suspect classification analysis must attach. While some would suggest
thatinordertoaddressthissystemiceffectoftheGeorgiadeathpenaltyprocess,one

The text of the Eighth Amendment forbids the awarding of “cruel and unusual
punishments.” In the past, this Court has examined the standard against capital
punishmentbymeasuringproportionalityandparticularmethodsofexecution.See
Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 170 (1976). The death penalty, however, has been
upheldasapunishmentthatdoesnotperseviolatetheEighthAmendment.Id.at
168–99,176.Still,onthesentencingbody’sdiscretioninthismatter,wehavenoted,

invalidatedthedeathpenaltyasanexcessivepunishment,wherethatdiscretionhas
beenappliedinanirrationalmanner.Furmanv.Georgia,408U.S.238(1972).The
practice, however, was reinstated where states substantially addressed the issues
raised in Furman regarding arbitrary and capricious decision-making processes.

McCleskey is asserting that the Georgia death penalty statute is both racially
discriminatoryon itsface and as applied. Based onthe Baldus studies, hedemon-
strates that in Georgia capital cases, Blacks were more likely to receive a death
sentence than any other defendants, and that Blacks who killed white victims
incurred the greatest likelihood of being sentenced to death. While this evidence

Theremightbesometendencytosuggest,intheabstract,thatMcCleskey’ssentence

deliberations. On the proportionality point, he was convicted of killing a police
officer, which is a legitimate aggravating circumstance. Many persons who kill
officers receive the death penalty, irrespective of race. The problem for
McCleskey’s case is that we cannot be certain that the aggravating factor explains
hisdeathsentence.Jurydiscretionpresentsaconfoundingprobleminthiscase.We
need and value the discretion accorded jurors and understand that the Baldus
studies broadly demonstrate systemic correlations between race and punishment,
not a particular problem with the workings of any given jury in Georgia. It is,
however,theconnectionbetweenbroadjurordiscretionandcorrelationsbetween

such, finding the system cruel or unusual because it is captured by a real but
unspecified race bias is completely consistent with our decision in Furman. That
decision set a minimum baseline below which the death penalty should not be
imposed. A system with unaddressed racial bias falls below that baseline. For this
reason,thepetitioneralsoprevailsonhisEighthAmendmentclaim,whichequally

C AnyInfluenceofRacialConsiderationsonSentencingisUnacceptablein
theCriminalJusticeContext.
By holding that Georgia’s administration of the death penalty violates the Eighth
Amendment, today, the Court is acknowledging and rejecting the arbitrary influ-
ence of race on capital sentencing. We do understand that given that the Eighth
Amendment’s cruel and unusual prohibitory language applies to punishment
broadly, our decision today will potentially have a significant impact on the oper-
ationofthecriminaljusticesystem.Tocarveoutthisapproachforthedeathpenalty
alone,however,wouldbetosuggestthatarbitrarydecisionspremiseduponraceare
fine for less consequential decisions within the criminal justice system. If we are
trulyconcernedwitheradicatingracism,themoreadvisableapproachistoconclude
that to the extent evidence can be presented signaling that race is operating in
a statistically significant fashion at other junctures within the criminal justice
system,thosecasesshouldbegiventhesamesearchingEighthAmendmentreview.
With regard to the death penalty, in particular, the risk that race is playing
a determinative role in juror decision-making is more than supported by the
Baldus study findings that a black person who kills a white person received the
death penalty 22 percent of the time, while black-on-black homicides received
the death penalty only 8 percent of the time. To ignore that these outcomes are
linkedtopersonalbiasesinamannerthatimplicatestheEighthAmendmentwould
amount to our accepting that racial bias is unavoidable in the administration of
justice.Suchaclaimisclearlyuntenable.

it would be advisable for Congress and state legislatures to acknowledge the
significant scope of this issue and begin to address the problem in a more
systematic fashion.

Iwriteseparatelytoconcurinthejudgmentandjointhedecisionwithregardto
theclaimthattheGeorgiadeathpenaltyviolatedtheEighthAmendment.Icannot
join the Fourteenth Amendment rationale due to the unique way in which juries
work.Notonlyisdiscretionparamounttojuries,theconfidentialityoftheprocessis
also a necessary feature of the deliberation. This confidentiality makes it nearly
impossible to discern whether jurors have actually engaged in racial bias. That is,
however,theveryevidencethatisrequired.AsIhavestatedpreviouslyinmyopinion
inVillageofArlingtonHeights,andreiteratehere,proofofdiscriminatorypurposeis
anecessitytoasserttheFourteenthAmendmentclaim.429U.S.252.Withoutthis
proof,theCourt’sprescriptionthatthestateinvestigateandofferanonracialexplan-
ation for disparate racial outcomes alone is flawed. For example, one might also

acceptable? It is doubtful. Expanding the intent doctrine in this unprecedented
manner also ensures that measures of intent will be diminished for state actions

Unlike the Fourteenth Amendment, the Eighth Amendment analysis does not

accord with “the dignity of man.” In applying this mandate, the Court has been
guided by his statement that “the Amendment must draw its meaning from the

On these grounds, I join the plurality decision in the holding that significant
racial differences in rates of awarding the death penalty likely involve decision-
making processes that are arbitrary and result inpunishments that are notpropor-
tionate. While I do believe that this Eighth Amendment analysis portends the
availability of challenges to disproportionate racial outcomes in other areas of the
criminal justice system, potentially challenging our criminal justice system at its
foundations, I hesitantly remain open to those potential cases as a requirement of
administering a just system. With regard to curing the multiple disparate racial
effects that are prevalent within the criminal justice system, I would much rather
Congress address these matters through comprehensive reform legislation. In the
absenceofsuchlegislation,however,theCourtmaynotavoiditsdutytoevaluatethe
constitutionality of the system as it is currently configured. In the instant case,
the Court certainly cannot sit on its hands and pretend that no constitutional
violationsarisefromthearbitraryanddetrimentalconsiderationsofraceincapital
sentencing. While I am cognizant of the significant disruptive effect this holding
portends,todootherwisewouldforceonetoswallowtoomuchinjustice.Icanonly
imagine that if I failed to follow the moral imperative involved in invalidating
a system improperly considering race, I would deeply regret that decision for the
remainderofmytimeontheCourtandlongthereafter.
