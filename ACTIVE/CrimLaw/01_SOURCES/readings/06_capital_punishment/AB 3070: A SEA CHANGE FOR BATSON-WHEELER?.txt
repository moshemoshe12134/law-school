In a criminal case, each side gets a certain number of peremptory challenges. A peremptory
challenge is an objection to a juror that the court must follow, and for which no reason need
be given. However, peremptory challenges may not be used to systematically exclude jurors
based on their membership in a cognizable group distinguished by racial, religious, ethnic, or
similar characteristics. This is colloquially known as the Batson-Wheeler rule. See Batson v.
Kentucky (1986) 476 U.S. 79 (applying Fourteenth Amendment equal protection to jury
service) and People v. Wheeler (1978) 22 Cal.3d 258 (California case requiring juries to be
drawn from a representative cross-section of the community). See also Code of Civil
Procedure section 231.5 (prohibiting use of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, sexual
orientation, or similar grounds in jury selection).
There are three parts to litigating a classic Batson-Wheeler challenge. First, the side asserting
the improper use of peremptory challenges must state a prima facie case of systematic
exclusion. Next, the burden shifts to the other party to show that there were neutral reasons
for exercising the challenges (i.e., reasons other than the systematic exclusion of members of
a cognizable group). (Purkett v. Elem (1995) 514 U.S. 765, 768; People v. Clair (1992) 2
Cal.4th 629, 652.) Finally, the trial court must decide whether purposeful discrimination has
been shown. (Snyder v. Louisiana (2008) 552 U.S. 472.)
As it currently stands, the burden of the party alleging systematic exclusion is to establish
purposeful discrimination by a preponderance of the evidence. (People v. Hutchins (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 992, 998.) Making that burden especially tough is the fact that courts have
allowed justifications to be subjective. The opposing party’s burden at this stage is met by an
explanation that is facially valid; it need not be persuasive or even plausible. (People v.
Gutierrez (2017) 2 Cal.5th 1150, 1168). Hunches, a prospective juror’s “body language,” a
particular mode of answering questions, and lack of life experience have all been deemed
acceptable reasons for excusing jurors and used to rebut the inference of systematic
exclusion. (See People v. Hall (1983) 35 Cal.3d 161, 170; People v. Gray (2001) 87
Cal.App.4th 781, 788; People v. Perez (1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1313, 1328.)
Over the years, a key criticism of the Batson-Wheeler procedure has been that many
commonly proffered race-neutral reasons in Step 2 were in fact reasons disproportionately
associated with those protected groups, with the same result as if race had been the stated
reason. In addition, the high bar of establishing purposeful discrimination has made it
extraordiarily difficult to prevail on a Batson-Wheeler challenge. As California Supreme
1/3

Court Justice Goodwin Liu pointed out in a recent 21-page dissenting opinion, “it has been
more than 30 years since this court has found racial discrimination in the peremptory strike
of a Black juror.” (See People v. Triplett (Aug. 31, 2020, S262052) 2020 Cal.Lexis 5546, Liu,
dissenting to denial of review.)
Enter AB 3070, authored by Assemblymember Shirley Weber (D-San Diego) and signed by
Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2020.
Effective for all criminal trials where jury selection begins on or after Jan. 1, 2022, AB 3070
declares that requiring proof of intentional bias renders the procedure ineffective and that
many of the reasons routinely advanced to justify the exclusion of jurors from protected
groups are in fact associated with stereotypes about those groups or otherwise based on
unlawful discrimination. AB 3070 amends California Code of Civil Procedure, section 231.7
subd.(d)(1) to lower the burden from purposeful discrimination to a “substantial likelihood”
determination that an “objectively reasonable person would view [the protected group] as a
factor in the use of the peremptory challenge”. The objectively reasonable person standard
includes an awareness of unconscious bias, both implicit and institutional. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 231.7(d)(2)(A)-(C).)
In addition to lowering the burden to sustain a challenge, AB 3070 also raises the bar for
certain Step 2 justifications, making them presumptively invalid. An attorney relying on
these justifications will have to show by clear and convincing evidence that an objectively
reasonable person would view the rationale as unrelated to a protected category, and that the
reasons articulated bear on the prospective juror’s ability to be fair and impartial in the case.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 231.7(e).)
These new presumptively invalid reasons include such things as a distrust of or having a
negative experience with law enforcement or the criminal legal system, a belief that law
enforcement officers engage in racial profiling, a belief that criminal laws have been enforced
in a discriminatory manner, or a close relationship with people who have been stopped,
arrested, or convicted of a crime. Other presumptively invalid reasons trend toward socio-
economic and geographic factors: the prospective juror’s neighborhood, having a child
outside of marriage, receiving state benefits, or lack of employment or underemployment of
the juror or a family member. Common group identifiers such as dress, attire, or personal
appearance are included, as are language issues such as not being a native English speaker,
or having the ability to speak another language.
Finally, broad categories include employment in a field that is disproportionately occupied by
members listed in a protected group, or that serves a population disproportionately
comprised of group members. Even a prospective juror’s apparent friendliness with another
prospective juror of a protected group will be presumptively invalid as a reason for
peremptory challenge.

AB 3070 also reaches into the tricky area of courtroom demeanor. Certain behaviors are now
listed as presumptively invalid reasons to exclude a prospective juror, including
inattentiveness, staring, failing to make eye contact, exhibiting a lack of rapport or a
problematic attitude, body language or demeanor, or providing unintelligent or confused
answers. (Code Civ. Proc., § 231.7(g)(1).) For these, however, the court and opposing
counsel’s own observations can rebut the presumption, so long as it can be shown that the
behavior matters to the case.
AB 3070 has the potential to turn a number of past California cases on their heads. Consider
the following examples, and the peremptory challenges that were upheld as valid: People v.
Winbush (2017) 2 Cal.5th 402 (prior arrest); People v. Adanandus (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th
496 (same); People v. Cummings (1993) 4 Cal.4th 1233 (relative with a conviction); People v.
Clark (2011) 52 Cal.4th 856 (experience in counseling or social services); People v.
Trevino (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 396, 411 (same); People v. Chism (2014) 58 Cal.4th 1266 (lack
of supervisory work experience); People v. Johnson (1989) 47 Cal.3d 1194 (bad feelings about
police); People v. Calvin (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 1377 (skepticism about the fairness of the
criminal justice system); and People v. Barber (1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 378 (manner of dress,
poor grasp of the English language).
