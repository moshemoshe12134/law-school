Fifty Years of Defiance and Resistance After
Gideon v. Wainwright
abstract. In its 1963 ruling Gideon v. Wainwright, the Supreme Court declared the right to
a lawyer “fundamental and essential” to fairness in the criminal courts and held that lawyers
must be provided for people who could not afford them so that every person “stands equal
before the law.” In later decisions, the Court ruled that a poor person facing any loss of liberty
must have a lawyer “so that the accused may know precisely what he is doing, so that he is fully
aware of the prospect of going to jail or prison, and so that he is treated fairly by the
prosecution.” This Essay argues that fifty years later, this right has not been realized. The U.S.
criminal system is not truly adversarial because prosecutors possess broad, unchecked power and
therefore determine results in criminal cases with little or no input from the defense.
Governments have failed to adequately fund defense systems, many judges tolerate or welcome
inadequate representation, and the Supreme Court has refused to require competent
representation, instead adopting a standard of “effective counsel” that hides and perpetuates
deficient representation. In this system, poverty, not justice, dictates outcomes.

introduction
Every day in thousands of courtrooms across the nation, from top-tier trial
courts that handle felony cases to municipal courts that serve as cash cows for
their communities, the right to counsel is violated. Judges conduct hearings in
which poor people accused of crimes and poor children charged with acts of
delinquency appear without lawyers. Many plead guilty without lawyers.
Others plead guilty and are sentenced after learning about plea offers from
lawyers they met moments before and will never see again. Innocent people
plead guilty to get out of jail. Virtually all cases are resolved in this manner in
many courts, particularly municipal and misdemeanor courts, which handle an
enormous volume of cases. But it is also how many felony cases are resolved.
Even when representation lasts for more than a few minutes, it is often
provided by lawyers struggling with enormous caseloads. These lawyers
practice triage as they attempt to represent more people than is humanly—and
ethically—possible without the resources to investigate their many clients’
cases, retain expert witnesses, and pay other necessary expenses. As a result,
they are unable to give their clients informed, professional advice during plea
negotiations, which resolve almost all cases in “a system of pleas, not a system
of trials.”1 In the rare case that goes to trial, defense counsel often cannot
seriously contest the prosecution’s arguments, raise and preserve legal issues
for appeal, or provide information about the defendant that is essential for
individualized sentencing. For the poor person accused of a crime, there may
be no adversarial system. Prosecutors may determine outcomes in cases with
little or no input from defense counsel.
There are exceptions. Some jurisdictions have provided the resources,
independence, structure, training, and supervision that enable capable, caring,
and dedicated lawyers to zealously represent their clients. Some public
defenders and assigned counsel do heroic work despite overwhelming
caseloads and lack of resources. But in many jurisdictions, perfunctory
representation and “meet ’em and plead ’em” processing of human beings
through the courts remain the dominant culture. Many courts are plea mills:
courts of profit that impose fines without any inquiry into the ability of
defendants to pay, thus setting them up for failure and return to jail.
The representation received by most poor people accused of crimes—if they
receive any at all—is a far cry from the constitutional requirement of the “the
guiding hand of counsel at every step in the proceedings,” which was

established by Gideon v. Wainwright2 and its progeny.3 Gideon held that “fair
trials before impartial tribunals in which every defendant stands equal before
the law” “cannot be realized if the poor man charged with crime has to face his
accusers without a lawyer to assist him.”4 The Court also discussed equality
before the law in another case decided on the same day as Gideon, reiterating its
previous statement that “there can be no equal justice” where the kind of
justice a person gets “depends on the amount of money he has.”5
Nevertheless, most states, counties, and municipalities—responsible for
over ninety-five percent of all criminal prosecutions6—have refused to provide
funding necessary for counsel and equal justice, despite repeated reports of
deficient representation and gross miscarriages of justice. There is no public
support for such funding, and governments have no incentive to provide
competent representation, which could frustrate their efforts to convict, fine,
imprison, and execute poor defendants. Many state governments have a long
history of disregarding or resisting unpopular United States Supreme Court
2. 372 U.S. 335, 345 (1963) (quoting Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 69 (1932)).
3. Gideon applied to felony cases. The Court later held that children facing commitment to an
institution were entitled to counsel as a matter of due process in delinquency proceedings, In
re Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 34-42 (1967), and that “no imprisonment may be imposed, even though
local law permits it, unless the accused is represented by counsel,” Argersinger v. Hamlin,
407 U.S. 25, 40 (1972). An accused is entitled to counsel “within a reasonable time” after
“the initiation of adversary judicial proceedings,” Rothgery v. Gillespie Cnty., 554 U.S. 191,
212 (2008), and at any “critical stage” of a criminal proceeding, such as a preliminary
hearing, Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U.S. 1, 7-10 (1970), or arraignment, White v. Maryland,
373 U.S. 59, 60 (1963). The Court also held that an indigent defendant is entitled to expert
assistance when necessary to a fair trial in Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U.S. 68, 77-83 (1985),
although its decision was based on due process and not the Sixth Amendment. The
American Bar Association, among other organizations, has developed standards
for effective representation, see, e.g., ABA STANDARDS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE:

decisions—whether they require desegregation of the schools or the right to
counsel—unless these decisions are enforced. The right to counsel is not
enforced. Many judges tolerate or welcome inadequate representation because
it allows them to process cases quickly. The Supreme Court has refused to
require competent representation, instead adopting a standard of “effective
counsel” that hides and perpetuates deficient representation.
The cost of this one-sided system is enormous. Innocent people are
convicted and sent to prison while the perpetrators remain at large. Important
issues, such as the system’s pervasive racism—from stops by law enforcement
officers to disparate sentencing—are ignored. People are sentenced without
consideration of their individual characteristics, allowing race, politics, and
other improper factors to influence sentences. Over 2.2 million people—a
grossly disproportionate number of them African Americans and Latinos7—are
in prisons and jails8 at a cost of $75 billion a year.9 Nearly an additional five
million people are on probation, parole, or supervised release.10 Over seventy
thousand children are held in juvenile facilities.11 Even those who have
completed their sentences may be deported, denied the right to vote,
dishonorably discharged from the armed forces, denied public benefits, and

denied business or professional licenses.12 Reentry into society is extremely
difficult,13 extending the costs to the families and communities of those who
have been imprisoned.14
There are expressive costs as well. A system in which all of the key actors
routinely ignore one of its most fundamental constitutional requirements is not
a system based on the rule of law, no matter what it claims to be. When those
actors shirk their constitutional obligations and bring the immense power of
the state down most heavily on African Americans and Latinos, people cease to
have confidence in the courts. The system lacks legitimacy and credibility and
is undeserving of respect. For this to change, courts, legislatures, executives,
and members of the legal profession will need to respond with a sense of
urgency and commitment to justice that has been missing in most places
during the last fifty years.
i. prosecutors determine outcomes in many cases with
little or no input from the defense
The United States supposedly has an adversary system of justice, as
opposed to the inquisitorial system employed in much of the rest of the
world.15 In the latter, a judge or magistrate is primarily responsible for
directing the investigation and sifting through the evidence and establishing

majority of the world uses some version of the inquisitorial system that evolved primarily in
continental Europe).

the true facts.16 America’s adversary system relies on the prosecution and
defense each to conduct investigations, analyze evidence, select witnesses,
argue law, and present “partisan advocacy”17 to a neutral factfinder. The system
is premised on “the principle that truth—as well as fairness—is best discovered
by powerful statements on both sides of the question.”18 For this system to
work, there cannot be significant disparities between the skills and resources of
the prosecution and defense. Both must be able to investigate the case and
present their evidence and arguments fully and forcefully.
However, for the most part, only very wealthy individuals and corporations
can afford to pay for hundreds—often thousands—of hours of representation
by experienced trial lawyers and for the cost of investigation, expert witnesses,
and other expenses of defending a criminal case within the adversary system.
On the other hand, the lawyer assigned to defend a poor person usually has
little or no time and few resources to investigate the charges and mount a
defense. For those who cannot afford costly representation by experienced
attorneys, the system is inquisitorial, but the prosecutor, not a neutral judicial
officer, serves as inquisitor.
Prosecutors have vast resources and immense power in conducting their
inquests and dictating outcomes in the plea bargaining that resolves the
overwhelming majority of cases. Governments maintain well-staffed offices
specializing in the prosecution of cases. Prosecutors regularly appear in court,
and many judges rely on their recommendations on issues ranging from
pretrial release to sentencing. Some judges even rely on prosecutors to write
their orders.19 Prosecutors have access to law enforcement agencies to
investigate cases and laboratories to conduct scientific tests and present expert
testimony.20 They can subpoena witnesses to testify before grand juries and

we remit to the lawyer-partisans the responsibility for gathering, selecting, presenting, and
probing the evidence. . . . In the European systems, by contrast, evidence is gathered by
judges or judge-like investigators, public officers who operate under a duty to seek the
truth.”).

produce all documents and records relevant to a case.21 They have a power that
no other litigant has: the ability to reward witnesses for providing information
or testimony by granting immunity from prosecution, dismissing or reducing
criminal charges, or informing sentencing judges of cooperation.22 They can
place informants in the cells of defendants.23 On the other hand, in the
overwhelming majority of criminal cases against poor defendants, the defense
conducts no investigation whatsoever.
In most jurisdictions, prosecutors are not required to reveal much of what
they know about the case to defense counsel. “[T]he prosecutor’s institutional
role in controlling access to information relevant to a defendant’s guilt, and the
prosecutor’s ability to withhold evidence that might prove a defendant’s
innocence . . . dramatically distort[] the ability of the adversary system to
function fairly and properly.”24 Most jurisdictions allow prosecutors to
withhold almost everything about their case and conduct “trial by ambush.”25
Some prosecutors make plea offers conditioned upon the defendant’s not filing
any motions or seeking discovery.26 The Supreme Court has held that
prosecutors are not required to disclose exculpatory evidence to a grand jury
before it decides whether to issue formal charges27 or to defense counsel before

the entry of a guilty plea.28 Prosecutors may even demand that a defendant
release officials from civil liability in exchange for dismissal of charges.29
The exclusive access to information and unbridled discretion in charging
and plea bargaining enables prosecutors to dictate the resolution of many cases
and often to determine sentences. Prosecutors decide whether to charge, what
to charge, whether to charge in state or federal court or both,30 whether to
allow defendants to enter diversion programs, whether to agree to pretrial
release as part of a plea bargain, and whether to grant immunity.31 They can
overcharge defendants in order to increase their bargaining power. They may
seek the death penalty or other enhanced penalties and mandatory minimum
sentences. In jurisdictions with sentencing guidelines, prosecutors influence
and often control the length of sentences by what they charge and, in the
federal courts, whether they agree to notify the sentencing judge that the
defendant has rendered “substantial assistance.”32 In all types of cases,
prosecutors may agree to reduce the charges, withdraw their notice to seek
enhanced sentences, agree to a specific sentence, or make some other
concession in exchange for the defendant’s entry of a guilty plea and waiver of
a trial by jury and any appeals.33 Judges are often left with little or no

30. The decision to bring charges in state or federal court may be based upon which jurisdiction
has the more severe punishment. See, e.g., United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 479
(1996) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (noting that sentences for drug offenses tend to be
substantially more severe in the federal system than in the state systems and that, in the case
before the Court, the federal sentence might be as long as a mandatory life term, but in state
court it could have been as short as twelve years, less work-time credits of half that amount).

that provides prosecutors tremendous leverage in the plea bargaining process, forced
criminal defense attorneys to adopt the role of transactional attorneys rather than zealous
advocates, and virtually eliminated the criminal jury as a viable check on government
overreaching.” Jackie Gardina, Compromising Liberty: A Structural Critique of the Sentencing

sentencing discretion,34 and defense counsel may be relegated to the role of
messenger.
These vast prosecutorial powers and the ruthless use of them in plea
bargaining and determining sentences were upheld by the Supreme Court in
Bordenkircher v. Hayes.35 There, a prosecutor offered Paul Hayes a sentence of
five years in prison for forging a check for $88.30 and warned Hayes that if he
rejected the offer the prosecutor would file repeat offender papers requiring a
mandatory sentence of life imprisonment. Hayes declined the offer, and the
prosecutor carried out his threat, obtaining the mandatory life sentence. The
Supreme Court upheld the prosecutor’s actions, calling them part of the “‘give-
and-take’ of plea bargaining.”36
Prosecutors exercise this power with virtually no oversight or
accountability. They have absolute immunity for their work in prosecuting
cases37 and may not be held liable even when their failure to train their
assistants results in the suppression of exculpatory evidence and conviction of
innocent people.38 The Supreme Court has made it impossible for a defendant
to prevail on a claim of selective prosecution,39 and has refused to require
prosecutors to reveal the basis for their charging decisions, even when these
decisions produce racial disparities.40 Although prosecutors are, in theory,
bound by the ethics rules promulgated by each state, the reality is that
disciplinary measures are almost never imposed on prosecutors.41 As is often

the case in various contexts, unchecked power sometimes leads to abuse.42
An inquisitorial system masquerading as an adversary system with all
power concentrated in the prosecution is not fair or just. Prosecutors evaluate
cases not as objective inquisitors, but as adversaries and politicians.43 Many are
elected on tough-on-crime platforms, promising convictions and severe
sentences. Moreover, even the most conscientious prosecutor committed to a
just outcome lacks critical information about the accused—his or her version of
events as well as personal characteristics relevant to culpability and
punishment—necessary to make fully informed decisions. Justice in America
supposedly requires a working adversary system, as the attorneys general of
twenty-three states and territories recognized in 1963 by filing an amicus curiae
brief in the Supreme Court in support of Clarence Earl Gideon’s argument that
the Sixth Amendment required counsel for defendants in the state courts.44
Today, however, denying the poor adequate representation is a strategy for
winning cases, used by some prosecutors.45
ii. governments have disregarded their constitutional
obligation to provide counsel
Fifty years after Gideon, the right to counsel and equal justice are as much a
fiction as the adversary system. The kind of justice people receive depends very
much on the amount of money they have. It determines whether they have
counsel, when they obtain counsel, whether they have access to investigators

representation in one complex case carrying a sentence of life imprisonment because the
public defender could not competently and ethically handle it due to obligations to 164
clients in pending felony cases, the prosecutor appealed and obtained a reversal of the order.
Bowens v. State, 39 So. 3d 479, 480-82 (Fla. App. 2010). It is hard to imagine the prosecutor
having any interest in seeking reversal of a judge’s decision allowing a public defender to
decline a single complex case except to take advantage of the public defender’s excessive
workload.

and expert witnesses, and whether the representation provided is zealous or
perfunctory. This is apparent from the moment someone is arrested and jailed.
A person who can afford a lawyer usually retains one at once. The lawyer will
attempt to secure the person’s immediate release from jail, often successfully,
so that the client can maintain employment, take care of family, and prepare for
trial. A team of lawyers, investigators, paralegals, and support staff will begin
an investigation while the evidence is available and the memories of witnesses
are fresh. If it appears that the charges lack merit, the lawyers will attempt to
secure dismissal of the case and, if unsuccessful, prepare for and represent the
client at trial, asserting and protecting all of the client’s rights. If the client
appears to be guilty of the crime charged or a lesser offense, the lawyer will
engage in plea bargaining based upon a detailed knowledge of the facts of the
crime and the background of the client. If the client is convicted at trial or by
entering a guilty plea, the lawyer will provide individualized advocacy with
regard to sentencing.
In contrast, poor people accused of crimes, although entitled to counsel
“within a reasonable time” after “‘the initiation of adversary judicial
proceedings,’”46 may languish in jail for days, weeks, or months after arrest
without a lawyer.47 They do not receive the “consultation, thoroughgoing
investigation and preparation” that are “vitally important” from the outset in a
case.48 As a result, they may lose their jobs, homes, and means of
transportation, even though the charges may later be dismissed. Jacqueline
Winbrone even lost her husband. She was detained after arrest in New York
because she could not make $10,000 bail. With no lawyer to seek a reduction,
she remained in jail and was unable to take her husband to dialysis, and, as a
result, he died.49 She was later released on her personal promise to return to
court, and ultimately the charge was dismissed.50 Diego Moran, facing the

Alabama, 399 U.S. 1 (1970), which are scheduled in most jurisdictions within ten to twenty
days of arrest and provide an opportunity for dismissal of the charges or a reduction of
bond, but defendants without counsel may not receive preliminary hearings because there is
no counsel to ask for them.

did not receive one for over eight months.51 A woman in Mississippi charged
with shoplifting spent eleven months in jail before a lawyer was appointed to
her case, and three additional months before entering a guilty plea.52 Many
poor people spend more time in jail waiting for the appointment of a lawyer
and a hearing than they would spend if found guilty and sentenced.53 Some
jurisdictions have “jail clearing days,” when people who have spent more time
in jail than any sentence they might receive can plead guilty for time served.
Innocent people plead guilty to get out of jail.54
An ABA report in 2004 reached “the disturbing conclusion that thousands
of persons are processed through America’s courts every year either with no
lawyer at all or with a lawyer who does not have the time, resources, or in some
cases the inclination to provide effective representation.”55 A national study in
2009 found that in misdemeanor cases—which far outnumber felonies and
which affect millions of people56—judges were encouraging defendants to
plead guilty without counsel, prosecutors were talking directly with defendants
and convincing them to plead guilty without counsel, defendants were
discouraged from asking for counsel because of application fees for a public
defender as high as $200, and defense lawyers usually had too many cases to

provide competent representation.57
Other studies confirm that judges and prosecutors are routinely ignoring
the right to counsel established by Gideon and its progeny. For example, one
report found that seventy percent of defendants in misdemeanor cases in
twenty-one Florida counties entered pleas of guilty or no contest at
arraignments that lasted an average of 2.93 minutes in 2011.58 One-third were
not represented by counsel.59 Some defendants were not advised of their right
to counsel and others were handed forms encouraging them to waive counsel.60
Poor defendants in Florida must pay a minimum fifty-dollar fee for
representation, which cannot be waived or reduced by trial judges no matter
how destitute the defendant.61 Unrepresented defendants were more likely to
plead guilty or no contest than defendants represented by counsel.62 In
Kentucky, even fewer people accused of misdemeanor offenses—about thirty
percent—were represented by counsel.63 Less than ten percent of the accused
were provided counsel in two populous counties near Cincinnati, Campbell
and Kenton.64 Many courts in Michigan “simply do not offer counsel in
misdemeanor cases” while others “avoid their constitutional obligation to
provide counsel” by accepting “uninformed waivers,” sentences of time served
without counsel, and “the threat of personal financial strains” because of
“unfair cost recovery measures,”65 and mass guilty pleas in misdemeanor cases

on “McJustice Days.”66 A Colorado statute requires defendants in
misdemeanor cases to be informed of plea offers by a prosecutor before
applying for a public defender.67
Fees for counsel may be waived in most states that have them, but
defendants are often not told that the fee can be waived or that they have a
right to a lawyer if they cannot afford one. A typical example is the case of Hills
McGee, who was told only that he had to pay $50 to apply for a public
defender when he appeared in court in Augusta, Georgia, on charges of public
drunkenness and obstruction of the law enforcement officer who arrested him.
Mr. McGee, a fifty-three-year-old man whose sole source of income was a
Veterans Administration disability payment of $243 per month, was unable to
pay the $50 fee and pleaded guilty without a lawyer. Without any inquiry into
his income or ability to pay, a judge fined him $200 plus $70 in fees and
surcharges. Because Mr. McGee did not have $270 that day, the judge told him
he could pay the fine in installments to a private probation company. The
probation company charged an “enrollment fee” of $15 and $39 a month for
accepting Mr. McGee’s monthly payments. After struggling to make monthly
payments for over a year, Mr. McGee had paid $552 on his $270 fine. He was
jailed because he still owed but was unable to pay the last $186.68
Many poor people do not see a lawyer until moments before the court
proceeding in which their cases are resolved. They have a few minutes of
conversation with harried lawyers with little knowledge of their clients and
cases and few resources to hire investigators and experts. Some do not even
talk to a lawyer. Reontay Miller, a seventeen-year-old African-American high
school freshman charged in adult court with stealing a go-cart (a felony) with
his brother, asked for a lawyer the first time he appeared before the superior
court in Cordele, Georgia, in March 2012. An investigator from the public
defender office had a brief conversation with him. He did not speak to an
attorney. Later that morning he was in one of seven groups of defendants who
pleaded guilty. While accepting the pleas, the judge asked the defendants if
they were satisfied with their attorney’s services. The teen looked around,
confused, and said, “I don’t have one.” A public defender standing near the
group of defendants entering pleas volunteered that he represented him, but
said nothing on behalf of Reontay. The court sentenced Reontay to five years’

probation, a $300 fine, and $500 restitution, and imposed the $50 public

One of the three public defenders in the office for that same circuit in
Georgia wrote a client in jail: “[E]xplain to me why you are requesting a
preliminary hearing. I would like to know why you feel like a preliminary
hearing is needed in your case.”70 The public defender also advised the client
that she would not file a motion to reduce bond for ninety days.71
Those in custody may have their only conversation with a lawyer while
handcuffed to other defendants on either side of them.72 Despite the complete
inability of the lawyers to meet even the most minimal professional
responsibilities—such as having confidential communications and being
sufficiently informed about the charges and their clients to give advice—these
discussions are very often followed a few minutes later by the entry of a guilty
plea and sentencing. A California lawyer explained that he was able to handle a
high volume of cases because seventy percent of his clients entered guilty pleas
at the first court appearance after he spent thirty seconds explaining the
prosecutor’s plea offer to them.73 The lawyer processed cases in one of the
twenty-four California counties that contract with lawyers to handle the cases
of people unable to afford lawyers.74 Contracts are often awarded to the lowest

supplemented by their counties. Counties provide primary funding in Arizona, Arkansas,
Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada,
Ohio, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, and Washington, with supplemental funding by the

bidder, creating an incentive for lawyers to handle a high volume of cases and
spend as little time as possible on each case in order to make a profit. One
contract defender repeatedly fought off low bidders by reducing his budget,
which had been forty-one percent of the prosecutor’s budget in 2000, to only
twenty-seven percent of the prosecutor’s budget in 2005. Yet in 2006, he was
undercut by a bid that was almost fifty percent less than his by a firm
employing even fewer lawyers spending even less time on each case.75
Such unconscionable low-bid contracts are the most egregious example of
how inadequate funding “continues to be the single greatest obstacle to
delivering ‘competent’ and ‘diligent’ defense representation.”76 Whether the
poor are represented by public defenders, assigned counsel or contract lawyers,
“the most visible sign of inadequate funding is attorneys attempting to provide
defense services while carrying astonishingly large caseloads.”77 Seven public
defenders in one office in Georgia each completed representation or “closed”
over 250 felony cases in the twelve months ending June 30, 2012, according to
records of the state public defense agency.78 Other jurisdictions have struggled
with similar caseloads.79 As a result of such caseloads, “defense lawyers are
constantly forced to violate their oaths as attorneys because their caseloads
make it impossible for them to practice law as they are required to do according
to the profession’s rules.”80 It is doubtful that a lawyer can competently handle
150 felonies in a year, a maximum established in 1973.81
The workload of Missouri’s statewide public defender program increased
by more than twelve thousand cases in a six-year period ending in 2005, but
the program received no additional staff during that time.82 At the end of 2012,
it was seventy-one lawyers and sixty investigators short of what it needed to

The director of the state public defender commission informed the governor
and the state’s justices, judges, and legislators in 2011 that “[t]riage has
replaced justice in Missouri’s courts,” people languish in jail “for weeks or even
months with no access to counsel,” and attorneys are forced to take “shortcuts
that lead to wrongful convictions.”85 The number of public defenders in
Minnesota fell from 423 in 2008 to 350 in 2010, prompting a judge there to
comment that the courts were “fast becoming the courts of McJustice” because
“[q]uality is sacrificed for efficiency.”86
Lawyers for the poor are often under financial and political pressures to
ignore ethical standards regarding conflicts, zeal, competence, and loyalty.87

cases at low cost than complying with ethical rules.92 Some lawyers in private
practice are dependent upon appointments by judges for their livelihoods.
Resistance to higher caseloads, motions for experts—or any motions for that
matter—and zealous representation may cost them future appointments. It is
no secret that some judges determine the outcome of cases by the attorney
appointed to defend the accused. In Georgia, as a result of financial pressures,
the state public defense agency and some local public defenders joined the
Attorney General’s office in arguing that public defenders should be exempt
from the rules of professional conduct that prevent lawyers from representing
clients with conflicting interests.93
This underfunded, overloaded system of pleas with divided loyalties is
often not up to the task of providing lawyers for trials. Shanna Shackelford, a
twenty-three-year-old African-American woman charged with arson in
Georgia, wrote a desperate plea for help in 2012, explaining that an arson
charge against her had left her jobless and homeless. Despite her protestations
of innocence, her public defenders urged her to take a plea offer that would
result in her spending fifteen years in prison. She lost her two jobs and could
not get another because of the charges. She was sleeping in her car but was
about to lose it because she could not make the next loan payment. Finally, she
“asked to just be placed in jail while they decide how much longer they want to

the members. New Mexico’s chief public defender was until recently appointed by the
governor. N.M. STAT. ANN. § 31-15-4(A) (West 2012). In November 2012, the New Mexico
electorate passed a constitutional amendment to make the public defender office separate
from the state government, and the New Mexico legislature is currently drafting enabling
legislation to create an independent public defender commission. See Minutes of the Fifth
Meeting of the Courts, Corrections and Justice Committee, N.M. LEGISLATURE 6-7 (Nov. 29-30,

provided zealous representation. Her case was dismissed.94
James Fisher, Jr., spent twenty-six-and-a-half years in the custody of
Oklahoma—most of it on death row—without ever having a fair and reliable
determination of his guilt. The lawyer assigned to represent Mr. Fisher tried
his case and twenty-four others during September 1983, including another
capital murder case.95 The lawyer made no opening statement or closing
argument at either the guilt or sentencing phase and uttered only nine words
during the entire sentencing phase.96 Nineteen years later, the Tenth Circuit
set aside the conviction, finding that Mr. Fisher’s lawyer was “grossly inept,”
had “sabotaged” Mr. Fisher’s defense by repeatedly reiterating the state’s
version of events, and was disloyal by “exhibiting actual doubt and hostility
toward his client’s case.”97 At the retrial in 2005, Oklahoma gave Mr. Fisher a
lawyer who was drinking heavily, abusing cocaine, and neglecting his cases.98
The lawyer physically threatened Mr. Fisher at a pre-trial hearing and, as a

case, of their client’s real name.104 Convictions and death sentences have been
upheld despite such incompetence because twenty-one years after Gideon, the
Supreme Court eroded the reach of Gideon by applying presumptions—even in
the face of facts to the contrary—that lawyers are competent and make strategic
decisions.105 No matter how incompetent the lawyer, the Court has decreed
that “counsel is strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance,” and,
no matter how clueless, counsel is presumed to have “made all significant
decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.”106 The Court
has also abandoned its previous position that “[t]he right to the assistance of
counsel is too fundamental and absolute to allow courts to indulge in nice
calculations as to the amount of prejudice arising from its denial”107 and has
allowed judges to make crude guesses as to whether “there is a reasonable
probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the
proceeding would have been different.”108 Of course, appellate judges cannot
possibly know whether the outcome might have been different because they do
not see the witnesses who testified at trial and have no idea how the jury
assessed the case. Nevertheless, courts shrug off one travesty after another
based on a guess that no matter how bad the representation was, it did not
matter.
Justice Marshall, the sole dissenter in Strickland,109 correctly predicted that
the majority’s standard was “so malleable that, in practice, it will either have no
grip at all or will yield excessive variation in the manner in which the Sixth
Amendment is interpreted and applied by different courts.”110 He also objected

fifty years of defiance and resistance
to the presumptions adopted by the Court because they imposed “upon
defendants an unusually weighty burden of persuasion,”111 and he argued that a
defendant who establishes deficient performance should not be required to
show prejudice.112
The Court and Congress have added yet another layer of deference,
requiring federal judges in habeas corpus proceedings to be exceptionally
deferential to the decisions of elected state-court judges.113 Thus, the Court of
Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit upheld a death sentence by doubly deferring
under Strickland and the habeas corpus statute to a state court’s conclusion that
the outcome of the case at issue would not have been different114 even though
the lead defense lawyer drank a quart of vodka every night of trial. The lawyer
was also preparing to be sued, criminally prosecuted, and disbarred for stealing
client funds, and he failed to present evidence that his intellectually limited
client had been “subjected to abuse so severe, so frequent, and so notorious
that his neighbors called his childhood home ‘the Torture Chamber.’”115
In this system, poverty, not justice, dictates outcomes. Inexcusable
injustices occur every day in the criminal courts. As former federal judge and
FBI Director William S. Sessions has observed, the widespread resistance to
Gideon and its progeny “should be a source of great embarrassment” to the
judiciary, the bar and public officials because it has “created one of our legal
system’s most shameful deficiencies, greatly exacerbated by the Court’s
unrealistic and damaging 1984 decision in Strickland v. Washington.”116

conclusion
In the absence of a capable lawyer, a person accused of a crime is virtually
defenseless against a prosecutor acting as both inquisitor and adversary,
exercising unchecked power over everything from the crime charged to the
disclosure of information to the sentence imposed. That so many are left
defenseless so often is shameful. That the courts give so little attention to
defendants as individuals that they are compared to fast-food restaurants is a
disgrace to the courts and the legal system. However, the criminal courts are
not a concern of most people because they deal primarily with racial minorities
and the poor. As Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy observed at the time of
Gideon, “the poor person accused of a crime has no lobby.”117 States, counties,
and municipalities have no incentive to provide those they are prosecuting with
capable lawyers. Quite to the contrary, a bad or mediocre system of providing
lawyers facilitates pleas, move dockets, and lessens the risk that anyone accused
of a crime will not be convicted.
But these failings matter not only because they permanently damage lives,
families, and communities, but also because they leave the criminal courts
without credibility or legitimacy. The media, public officials, the judiciary, the
legal profession, law schools, and everyone in society should be concerned with
a major public institution that is supposed to be about justice and is failing so
badly. They must examine what is happening in the criminal courts and hold it
up to public examination. The Georgia legislature created a public defender
system in 2003 only after repeated criticism of deficient representation by three
consecutive chief justices of the state in addresses to the legislature and the bar,
lawsuits, reports, and extensive coverage by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution
and other media.118 After creating the system, the state has failed to fund it
adequately,119 but there have been significant improvements in representation

fifty years of defiance and resistance
provided in many parts of the state.
While there is little chance that the U.S. Supreme Court can be shamed
into modifying its decision in Strickland v. Washington, some state courts have
been responsive to challenges to systemic deficiencies such as the failure to
provide counsel and excessive caseloads.120
Members of the legal profession have a responsibility to lobby for poor
people accused of crimes. With their government-granted oligopoly on legal
services, lawyers have a responsibility to ensure that the criminal justice system
has integrity and works for the poorest and most powerless, just as for the
most prosperous and powerful. Lawyers should visit courts and observe how
poor people are processed through the system and bring suits to obtain
systemic reforms. Lawyers—no matter what their area of practice, from
corporate lawyers to small firm lawyers, to prosecutors and other government
lawyers—should educate legislators, civil groups, and people concerned about
public policy about the importance of an effective public defense system if there
is to be justice in the courts. Bar associations and lawyers should be the
primary advocates in state legislatures for full funding for the public defense.
Some bar associations and lawyers have provided exemplary leadership in this
regard, but others have avoided indigent defense as too controversial.
Professors, students, and their associations also have an important role to
play. Professors should teach the reality of criminal law by requiring students
to visit different courts, write down what they see, and then discuss what they
have seen and how it compares to what is required. Many law schools have
criminal defense clinics.121 More are needed so that students see the desperate
needs of poor people accused of crimes and learn to provide competent and
ethical representation.
All of these efforts must be used to persuade governments to establish and
120. See State v. Peart, 621 So. 2d 780 (La. 1993) (adopting a presumption of ineffectiveness
where counsel had an excessive caseload and lacked resources for investigation and other
expenses); DeWolfe v. Richmond, No. 34, 2012 WL 10853 (Md. Jan. 4, 2012) (holding that
people accused of crimes have a right to counsel at first appearance hearings); State ex rel.
Mo. Pub. Defender Comm’n v. Waters, 370 S.W.3d 592 (Mo. 2012) (holding that a trial
court must consider whether appointing counsel to a case will cause counsel to violate the
Sixth Amendment and ethical rules); Hurrell-Harring v. State, 930 N.E.2d 217 (N.Y. 2010)
(holding that people accused of crimes could maintain a class action suit seeking counsel at
arraignment and subsequent critical stages); Heckman v. Williamson Cnty., 369 S.W.3d 137
(Tex. 2012) (holding that people accused of crimes could maintain a class action suit seeking
counsel in misdemeanor cases); LEFSTEIN, supra note 81, at 162-89; Stephen F. Hanlon, State

fully fund public defense programs that are independent of judges and politics
and provide representation through public defender programs and assigned
attorneys. This has already occurred in several jurisdictions,122 and the
requirements for competent and ethical representation have been set out in
detail in standards and guidelines.123 The programs must be led by experienced,
client-oriented defense lawyers and must provide training and supervision to
both public defenders and private lawyers who are assigned to represent poor
defendants. Lawyers must have reasonable caseloads and resources for
investigation, interpreters, and experts, and, of course, they should not
represent clients with conflicting interests. Programs with these features can
ensure that every person arrested has “the guiding hand of counsel”124 from the
initial bail hearing through every subsequent proceeding.
Fifty years ago, the Supreme Court began to chart a course toward the
realization of the constitutional guarantees of counsel and equal justice in
Gideon v. Wainwright and other decisions. However, most state governments
have treated the Supreme Court’s decision in Gideon not as a bright star
pointing the way to justice, but as an unfunded mandate to be resisted. A sober
assessment of the defiance of and resistance after Gideon makes clear that to go
from the pretense of representation to the reality of it, there must be a new
commitment to counsel and equal justice with a sense of urgency to make up
for so much time lost. This will occur only when courts begin enforcing the
right to counsel, instead of being complicit in its denial; when the legal
profession meets its responsibility to make the legal system work for everyone;
and when the media, law professors and law students, and others hold the
system up to public examination until governments are shamed into providing
the lawyers that are “fundamental and essential”125 for fairness and justice.
