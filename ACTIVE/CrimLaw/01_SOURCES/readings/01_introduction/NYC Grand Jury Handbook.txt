MESSAGE FROM THE CHIEF JUDGE
Thank you for your upcoming service as grand
jurors. As grand jurors, you now are a part of
our court system. As a grand juror, you do not
work for the prosecutor or for the defendant.
Instead, like me, like the judges throughout
our state, and like the many others who work
in our courts, your responsibility is to fulfill
the mission of the courts to provide the best
justice that can be provided.
Before a criminal prosecution starts, grand juries provide a vital
function by hearing the prosecution’s evidence against the defendant
and determining whether that evidence is sufficient to charge the
defendant with a crime. Just like judges, grand jurors work for the
court and must be neutral and fair: indicting persons accused of crimes
where the evidence is sufficient to meet the legal definition of the
crimes charged, and refusing to indict persons charged with crimes
where the evidence is not sufficient to meet the legal definition of
the crimes charged.
Without the careful and thoughtful participation of grand jurors,
we could not preserve the rights of both defendants and victims in
our system, could not protect public safety, and could not ensure
that police and prosecutors follow the law. We know that grand jury
service will require you to make changes to your usual daily routine,
and we will attempt to accommodate you to make sure the disruption
is not severe. Grand jury service, though, is one of the very most
important parts of the criminal justice system: it gives citizens like you
– instead of kings or dictators -- the decision of whether to prosecute
someone with a serious crime.
For a brief period of your lives, you will be performing an essential and
rewarding service vital to a democratic system of justice. On behalf of
the more than our 16,000 people within New York’s court system, I
offer our deepest gratitude for your contribution to the pursuit of
justice. Thank you.
Rowan D. Wilson

OVERVIEW
The Purpose of this Handbook
This handbook is for citizens summoned to serve as grand jurors in
New York State. It is designed to answer commonly asked questions
about grand jury service. Whether or not you actually sit on a grand
jury, this handbook has information that everyone should know about
grand juries and grand jury service.
This handbook is not a substitute for Article 190 of the Criminal
Procedure Law, which is the legal framework for the grand jury. New
York State law requires that each grand juror be given a copy of Article
190 to read and to use as a reference while serving as a grand juror.
There is a copy of Article 190 starting at page 14 of this handbook.
If you do sit on a grand jury, remember that the grand jury’s legal
advisors are the District Attorney or assistant district attorney (also
called the prosecutor) and the judge - and no one else. Any questions
you have about the law should be addressed only to the prosecutor,
and, if necessary, to the judge. For other questions about grand jury
service, you should consult with commissioner of jurors’ staff or the
grand jury warden, or with the prosecutor if a grand juror needs to
speak with a judge.
The Role of the Grand Jury in the Criminal Justice System
The grand jury is an arm of the court. It is not an agent of the
prosecutor or the police. A grand jury does not decide whether or not
a person has been proven guilty. That is the trial jury’s job. The grand
jury decides whether or not a person should be formally charged with
a crime or other offense. The grand jury makes that decision based
on evidence presented to it by the prosecutor, who also instructs the
grand jury on the law. The grand jury’s decision must be based on the
evidence and on the law.
In general, the grand jury makes one of three decisions:
a) The grand jury may vote to formally accuse someone of a crime.
This accusation is called an “indictment,” also known as a “bill”
which is short for “bill of indictment.”
b) The grand jury may vote to dismiss the charges, also known as
a “no-bill.”
1-800-NY-JUROR • 1-800-695-8767 • WWW.NYJUROR.GOV 1

c) The grand jury may direct the prosecutor to file an information
accusing the person of an offense less serious than a felony.1
There are also rare circumstances where a grand jury recommends
that a case should be sent to Family Court or where the grand jury
makes a report to the court.
Why We Have Grand Juries
The use of trial juries (also called petit juries) and grand juries goes
back approximately 800 years. Beginning around 1215 A.D., both
types of juries were used in England. The grand jury made the formal
accusation, known as a “bill of indictment” or “presentment.”2 The
trial jury decided whether the accusation was proven.
The grand jury is included in the United States Constitution and the New
York State Constitution. In New York State, a person cannot be brought
to trial for a felony unless that person has been indicted by a grand jury.
The grand jury has an awesome responsibility. It uses its power both
as a sword and as a shield: a sword to accuse or indict those whom
there is reason to believe have committed crimes; a shield to protect
the innocent against unfounded accusations.
Differences Between Grand Juries and Trial Juries
Usually when we think of juries, trial juries come to mind. That’s
because most people who serve as jurors serve as trial jurors. In fact,
out of 574,000 people who served as jurors in New York State in 2005,
only 29,000 of them were grand jurors. Another way of looking at it is
that only one juror out of 20 is a grand juror.
There are many differences between trial juries and grand juries. The
most important is that a grand jury decides whether or not there is
enough evidence to charge an accused person with a crime and a trial
jury decides whether or not the person who is charged with a crime has
been proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. (See chart on page 5)
1) U nder special circumstances in cases involving 13 to 15 year olds, the prosecutor may
instruct the grand jury about the option of sending or removing the case to Family
Court. Also, a grand jury may be asked to investigate alleged misconduct in office by
a public official, criminal or otherwise. As a result of its investigation the grand jury
may issue a report to the court making recommendations for legislative, executive or
administrative action in the public interest.
2) The terms “indictment” and “presentment” are used interchangeably. This handbook
will refer only to “indictment.”
2 GRAND JUROR’S HANDBOOK • NEW YORK STATE UNIFIED COURT SYSTEM

BASICS OF GRAND JURY SERVICE
Qualifications of Jurors
Grand jurors and trial jurors must meet the same qualifications. You
are eligible to serve as a juror in New York State if you are:
1) a United States citizen,
2) at least 18 years old, and
3) a resident of the county to which you are summoned to serve
In addition, jurors must
4) be able to understand and communicate in the English
language, and
5) not have been convicted of a felony.3
In general, people who serve as grand jurors or trial jurors in New
York State are not eligible to be called for jury service again for six
years. Those who serve for 11 days or more (which is very common for
grand jurors) cannot be called again for eight years.
Term of Service
Your jury summons states whether you have been summoned as a
grand juror or as a trial juror. Length of service for a grand juror can
vary from two weeks to a month or more. Where the term of service
lasts for a month or more, grand jurors usually sit for one or two days
per week. The grand jury summons states the length of the term and
the reporting requirements. The Commissioner of Jurors and the
judge will explain how long the grand jury term of service will be and
how often grand jurors will be required to be present in court. Grand
jurors serving for long terms go about their normal business on days
when the grand jury is not in session.
Orientation and Selection of a Grand Jury
Upon arrival at the courthouse, summoned grand jurors typically see
a grand jury orientation video and the Commissioner of Jurors or a
member of the Commissioner’s staff explains the logistics of service.
The actual selection process is conducted by the Commissioner of
Jurors or by the judge, who are the only people authorized to excuse
summoned grand jurors. After assuring that all summoned grand
jurors are qualified to serve, the Commissioner or judge explains the
3) Persons previously convicted of a felony who have received a Certificate of Relief from
Civil Disabilities or a Certificate of Good Conduct may be qualified to serve as jurors.
1-800-NY-JUROR • 1-800-695-8767 • WWW.NYJUROR.GOV 3

grand jurors’ duties, and 23 jurors are randomly selected from among
those who are qualified.
How Many Grand Jurors?
A grand jury has 23 members. In order to conduct any business
- hearing evidence or deliberating - a “quorum” of at least 16
grand jurors must be present. In order to make a decision, at least
12 grand jurors who have heard the essential and critical evidence
and also the legal instructions must vote. All jurors who have heard
the essential and critical evidence and have been provided with the
instructions may vote.
The Foreperson
After the grand jurors are sworn, the judge appoints a foreperson.
The foreperson administers the oath to each witness who testifies
before the grand jury (although any member of the grand jury may
do so) and may chair the grand jury sessions.
The grand jury’s decisions must be given to the judge in writing. The
foreperson signs the document and gives it to a member of the court
staff or directly to the judge. If the grand jury cannot make a decision,
that too is reported in writing to the judge by the foreperson.
The Assistant Foreperson
The judge also appoints an assistant or acting foreperson who
performs the foreperson’s duties if the foreperson is absent or
unavailable.
The Secretary
The grand jury selects a secretary to keep the records of the grand
jury’s business. For example, the secretary keeps a record of jurors who
are not present when evidence or legal instructions are given. When
the grand jury votes, the secretary records the results of the vote.
Service as a grand juror begins with an oath of office given to the
jurors by the judge. The grand jurors swear or affirm that they will
perform their duties faithfully.

THE GRAND JURY GETS TO WORK
What Grand Juries Do
A grand jury usually hears many different, unrelated cases. Only the
prosecution presents evidence to the grand jury. There is no judge
present during the grand jury’s proceedings. However, a judge is
available to resolve legal issues and to answer questions, if needed.
The grand jury’s work comes before a trial. The grand jury’s main job
is to decide whether or not a person should be formally charged with
a crime. This formal charge is called an indictment. The grand jury
decides whether there is legally sufficient evidence of a crime and
whether there is reasonable cause to believe that the accused person
committed that crime.
Grand Jury Secrecy
Everything that happens in the grand jury room is secret. The purposes
of grand jury secrecy are to obtain the full cooperation of the witnesses
who appear before the grand jury, to permit grand jurors to make
decisions free from outside interference, and to protect an innocent
person who may be investigated but never indicted.
Grand jurors must preserve the secrecy of the grand jury proceedings.
Grand jurors may not discuss anything that occurs in the grand jury
room with anyone other than the other members of the jury, the
prosecutor or the judge, if necessary. Any discussion about the case by
grand jurors must occur only in the grand jury room. When proposing
questions for a witness, grand jurors should take care not to reveal
the identity of another witness, the substance of another witness’s
testimony, or other evidence they have heard or seen. Grand jurors
may not tell others anything about any action the grand jury takes.
Unlike others involved with the grand jury, witnesses are not required
to keep their role secret. Grand jury witnesses are allowed to discuss
their own testimony in public if they wish to do so. Anyone other than
a witness who violates the secrecy of a grand jury is subject to serious
penalties, including imprisonment.
No one may talk to a grand juror about the grand jury’s work. A grand
juror should immediately inform the jury staff, grand jury warden, the
prosecutor or, if necessary, the judge if anyone outside the grand jury
room approaches the grand juror and tries to talk about the grand
jury or its work.
6 GRAND JUROR’S HANDBOOK • NEW YORK STATE UNIFIED COURT SYSTEM

Reasons For Grand Jury Secrecy
• Full cooperation • Protection of the innocent
from witnesses - who may be investigated,
• Free and confidential but never indicted
deliberations
Who is Present in the Grand Jury Room?
The law strictly limits who may be present in the grand jury room
during grand jury proceedings. Only those who have official duties
may be present. In addition to the grand jurors themselves, those who
may be present include: the prosecutor, the witness, an attorney for
the witness, an interpreter, the stenographer who records everything
that is said during the proceedings, and a court employee authorized
to assist the grand jury. Sometimes a social worker, rape crisis
counselor, psychologist or other professional accompanies a child
witness during the child’s testimony. If there is evidence that must be
presented by video, then a video operator is present. And, finally, a
corrections officer or other public servant will accompany a witness
who is in custody.
When the grand jury is deliberating and voting, only the grand
jurors may be in the room. The only exception to this rule is where a
sign-language interpreter is needed for a deaf or hearing-impaired
grand juror.
Who May be Present in the Grand Jury Room?
• Jurors • Court employee who assists
• Prosecutor the grand jury
• Witness • Professional accompanying a
• Attorney for the witness child witness
• Stenographer • Video operator
• Interpreter • Public servant holding a
witness in custody
Grand Jurors’ Questions
Grand jurors may ask questions about the law. They may also ask
questions of witnesses about the evidence. Generally, the prosecutor
reviews grand jurors’ questions for witnesses and permits only those
that are relevant and legally proper.
1-800-NY-JUROR • 1-800-695-8767 • WWW.NYJUROR.GOV 7

All substantive discussions between grand jurors and prosecutors
or between grand jurors and judges are recorded stenographically.
There are no “off the record” remarks about the substance of a case
in the grand jury.
Note-Taking by Grand Jurors
Because grand jurors may hear evidence in many cases and because
there may be gaps of days or weeks between witnesses or between
hearing evidence and deliberating, many grand jurors find taking
notes helpful, and sometimes essential, in recalling the evidence in a
particular case. In some counties, grand jurors are given note-taking
materials. Grand jurors who are not given such materials may request
them from Commissioner of Jurors staff or the grand jury warden.
Jurors who do not take notes should rely on their own independent
recollection and should not be influenced by the notes of other grand
jurors. At any time the grand jury may ask the stenographer to read
testimony from the transcript.
Grand jurors’ notes must remain in the grand jury room at all times.
All notes are collected and destroyed when the grand jury’s work
is completed.
The Accused Person’s Role
An accused person is not required to testify before the grand jury and
may not even be aware that he or she is being investigated by one.
Sometimes the accused person chooses to testify before the grand
jury. When that happens, the person’s attorney may be present in
the grand jury room only during the defendant’s testimony to advise
him or her during the testimony. The attorney may not ask questions,
make objections or address the grand jury.
An accused person who does not testify is not permitted to have an
attorney present for any part of the grand jury proceedings. This is
because unlike a trial, the grand jury proceeding is not an adversary
proceeding. The purpose of a grand jury proceeding is only to decide
whether or not the prosecution has enough evidence to proceed with
a case against the person and not whether or not the prosecution
can prove that person guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore,
it is only at a trial that a defendant may have an attorney present
at all times.
8 GRAND JUROR’S HANDBOOK • NEW YORK STATE UNIFIED COURT SYSTEM

An accused person who is indicted - formally charged with a crime -
becomes a defendant in a criminal case. A defendant is represented
by an attorney for all proceedings, except in the rare case where a
defendant decides to represent herself or himself.
Deciding Which Witnesses Testify
The prosecutor can call any witness believed to have relevant
information. Also, the grand jury may direct the prosecutor to call
witnesses or to recall witnesses who have already testified.
In addition, the accused person or that person’s attorney may ask
the grand jury to hear from a particular witness. If such a request is
made, the grand jury decides whether it wishes to hear the witness’s
testimony. If the grand jury wishes to hear from the witness, the grand
jury directs the prosecutor to subpoena the witness.
When the grand jury directs the prosecutor to call a witness, that
request must be honored. However, the prosecutor may ask the judge
to limit or prevent a witness’s appearance. If the judge concludes that
the witness’s appearance would not be in the public interest, the
witness will not be called to testify.
How the Grand Jury Makes Decisions
Before the grand jury is asked to deliberate and vote, the prosecutor
gives the legal definitions of the proposed charges and other legal
instructions. Grand jurors may ask questions about these definitions
and instructions of the prosecutor and, if necessary, the judge.
In order for a grand jury to deliberate and vote on a case, a “quorum”
of at least 16 grand jurors must be present. The grand jurors discuss
with each other the evidence and the legal instructions and then
they vote. No one else is present in the room when the grand jury
deliberates and votes except a sign language interpreter if needed for
a juror. At any time the grand jury may ask the stenographer to read
testimony from the transcript.
To formally charge an accused person with a crime, 12 grand jurors
who heard all the essential and critical evidence and also the legal
instructions must agree that there is legally sufficient evidence and
reasonable cause to believe that the accused person committed a
crime. A grand juror who has not heard all the essential and critical
evidence on a case or who has not heard the legal instructions cannot
vote in that case.

QUESTIONS ABOUT GRAND JURY SERVICE
What if I recognize a witness or the name of the accused person?
A grand juror who recognizes a witness or the name of an accused
person should immediately inform the Commissioner of Jurors staff
or the grand jury warden or the District Attorney or assistant district
attorney or the judge.
What if grand jury service would be a hardship for me?
Grand juries, like trial juries, represent the communities from which they
are drawn. Despite the inconvenience, everyone who is summoned is
expected to serve. Excusals from grand jury service are granted rarely,
and only after a juror provides proof to the Commissioner of Jurors
or to the judge that grand jury service would pose a severe hardship.
Do I have to attend every session?
Yes. Attendance must be taken seriously. A grand juror is expected to
report for every day that the grand jury is sitting. However, the law
recognizes that there are emergencies or other unusual circumstances
when a grand juror must be absent. A grand juror who cannot be
present should contact Commissioner of Jurors staff or the grand jury
warden to explain.
When grand jurors are absent, serious consequences can result. No
evidence can be presented and no vote can be taken unless a “quorum”
of 16 grand jurors is present. A juror who has not heard all of the essential
and critical evidence on a case cannot vote on that case. Jurors should
bear in mind that evidence might be presented on different days.
Will I understand what I have to do?
Grand jurors listen to all the evidence presented and decide which
evidence or witnesses are credible. All individuals, regardless of
educational level or occupation, are equally equipped to make these
decisions. The grand jury’s conclusion is a group decision; it is not the
decision of any single person. For centuries, our jury system has worked
well with citizens using their common sense and good judgment while
serving as grand jurors and as trial jurors.
What should I wear?
Grand jury service is a very serious matter. The grand jury plays a
crucial role in the criminal justice system. A juror’s appearance and
attitude should reflect the importance of the grand jury’s work.
Clothes appropriate to a dignified occasion should be worn.
10 GRAND JUROR’S HANDBOOK • NEW YORK STATE UNIFIED COURT SYSTEM

When will I have to serve again?
Jurors who sit for 11 days or more and successfully complete their
service will not be eligible to be called again for eight years. Generally,
jurors who serve for less than 11 days are eligible to be called again
in six years. A person who is qualified and called again is selected at
random from the county wide pool of jurors and may be summoned
either as a trial juror or a grand juror.
Will I get paid for my grand jury service?
Grand jurors are paid according to the same rules as trial jurors. The
jury fee is $40 per day. The law requires employers with more than ten
employees to pay an employee serving as a juror at least $40 per day
for the first three days of service. After the first three days, the state
pays the jury fee to jurors whose employers are not paying them.
The state pays the $40 fee for jurors who work for employers with
fewer than ten employees if the employer is not paying them. The
state also pays the jury fee to jurors who are not employed, or who
are serving while on vacation or on a regularly scheduled day off. For
more information about juror payment, see the chart that appears
on the next page or go to “Who pays your jury fee?” at the court
system’s website: www.nyjuror.gov.
The Commissioner of Jurors is required to collect Social Security
numbers from all jurors who may be paid $600 or more for their
service. Jurors paid $600 or more will be issued an IRS 1099 form for
tax purposes at the end of the calendar year.
Grand jurors serve until they are discharged by the judge. The judge
may extend the grand jury term if the District Attorney or assistant
district attorney and the grand jury say that it cannot complete its
work before the end of its term of service. However, it is rare that a
grand jury’s term is extended.
CONCLUSION
The decision whether or not to charge someone with a crime is an
important one. The grand jury must give individual consideration to
each person under investigation and to each charge being considered.
The grand jury’s decisions must be based on the evidence and on the
law and not on speculation, bias, hostility or prejudice.
The judge, the witnesses, the attorneys and, most important, the
accused person all rely upon each individual grand juror to perform
the duties of a grand juror with honesty, integrity and fairness.

14 GRAND JUROR’S HANDBOOK • NEW YORK STATE UNIFIED COURT SYSTEM

§ 190.05 Grand jury; definition and general functions.
A grand jury is a body consisting of not less than sixteen nor more
than twenty-three persons, impaneled by a superior court and
constituting apart of such court, the functions of which are to
hear and examine evidence concerning offenses and concerning
misconduct, nonfeasance and neglect in public office, whether
criminal or otherwise, and to take action with respect to such evidence
as provided in section 190.60.
§ 190.10 Grand jury; for what courts drawn.
The appellate division of each judicial department shall adopt rules
governing the number and the terms for which grand juries shall be
drawn and impaneled by the superior courts within its department;
provided, however, that a grand jury may be drawn and impaneled
for any extraordinary term of the supreme court upon the order of a
justice assigned to hold such term.
§ 190.15 Grand jury; duration of term and discharge.
1) A term of a superior court for which a grand jury has been impan-
eled remains in existence at least until and including the opening
date of the next term of such court for which a grand jury has
been designated. Upon such date, or within five days preceding
it, the court may, upon declaration of both the grand jury and the
district attorney that such grand jury has not yet completed or
will be unable to complete certain business before it, extend the
term of court and the existence of such grand jury to a specified
future date, and may subsequently order further extensions for
such purpose.
2) At any time when a grand jury is in recess and no other appropri-
ate grand jury is in existence in the county, the court may, upon
application of the district attorney or of a defendant held by
a local criminal court for the action of a grand jury, order such
grand jury reconvened for the purpose of dealing with a matter
requiring grand jury action.
1-800-NY-JUROR • 1-800-695-8767 • WWW.NYJUROR.GOV 15

§ 190.20 Grand jury; formation, organization and other matters
preliminary to assumption of duties.
1) The mode of selecting grand jurors and of drawing and impanel-
ing grand juries is governed by the judiciary law.
2) Neither the grand jury panel nor any individual grand juror may
be challenged, but the court may: (a) At any time before a grand
jury is sworn, discharge the panel and summon another panel if
it finds that the original panel does not substantially conform to
the requirements of the judiciary law; or (b) At any time after a
grand juror is drawn, refuse to swear him, or discharge him after
he has been sworn, upon a finding that he is disqualified from
service pursuant to the judiciary law, or incapable of performing
his duties because of bias or prejudice, or guilty of misconduct
in the performance of his duties such as to impair the proper
functioning of the grand jury.
3) After a grand jury has been impaneled, the court must appoint
one of the grand jurors as foreman and another to act as foreman
during any absence or disability of the foreman. At some time
before commencement of their duties, the grand jurors must
appoint one of their number as secretary to keep records material
to the conduct of the grand jury`s business.
4) The grand jurors must be sworn by the court. The oath may be in
any form or language which requires the grand jurors to perform
their duties faithfully.
5) After a grand jury has been sworn, the court must deliver or
cause to be delivered to each grand juror a printed copy of all
the provisions of this article, and the court may, in addition, give
the grand jurors any oral and written instructions relating to
the proper performance of their duties as it deems necessary or
appropriate.
6) If two or more grand juries are impaneled at the same court term,
the court may thereafter, for good cause, transfer grand jurors
from one panel to another, and any grand juror so transferred is
deemed to have been sworn as a member of the panel to which
he has been transferred.
16 GRAND JUROR’S HANDBOOK • NEW YORK STATE UNIFIED COURT SYSTEM

§ 190.25 Grand jury; proceedings and operation in general.
1) Proceedings of a grand jury are not valid unless at least sixteen of
its members are present. The finding of an indictment, a direction
to file a prosecutor`s information, a decision to submit a grand
jury report and every other affirmative official action or decision
requires the concurrence of at least twelve members thereof.
2) The foreman or any other grand juror may administer an oath to
any witness appearing before the grand jury.
3) Except as provided in subdivision three-a of this section, during
the deliberations and voting of a grand jury, only the grand jurors
may be present in the grand jury room. During its other proceed-
ings, the following persons, in addition to witnesses, may, as the
occasion requires, also be present: (a) The district attorney; (b) A
clerk or other public servant authorized to assist the grand jury
in the administrative conduct of its proceedings; (c) A stenogra-
pher authorized to record the proceedings of the grand jury; (d)
An interpreter. Upon request of the grand jury, the prosecutor
must provide an interpreter to interpret the testimony of any
witness who does not speak the English language well enough
to be readily understood. Such interpreter must, if he has not
previously taken the constitutional oath of office, first take an
oath before the grand jury that he will faithfully interpret the
testimony of the witness and that he will keep secret all matters
before such grand jury within his knowledge; (e) A public servant
holding a witness in custody. When a person held in official cus-
tody is a witness before a grand jury, a public servant assigned
to guard him during his grand jury appearance may accompany
him in the grand jury room. Such public servant must, if he has
not previously taken the constitutional oath of office, first take
an oath before the grand jury that he will keep secret all matters
before it within his knowledge. (f) An attorney representing a
witness pursuant to section 190.52 of this chapter while that
witness is present. (g) An operator, as that term is defined in
section 190.32 of this chapter, while the videotaped examination
of either a special witness or a child witness is being played. (h)
A social worker, rape crisis counselor, psychologist or other pro-
fessional providing emotional support to a child witness twelve
years old or younger, or a social worker or informal caregiver, as
provided in subdivision two of section two hundred six of the
elder law, for a vulnerable elderly person as provided in subdivi-
1-800-NY-JUROR • 1-800-695-8767 • WWW.NYJUROR.GOV 17

sion three of section 260.31 of the penal law, who is called to give
evidence in a grand jury proceeding concerning a crime defined
in article one hundred twenty-one, article one hundred thirty,
article two hundred sixty, section 120.10, 125.10, 125.15, 125.20,
125.25, 125.27, 255.25, 255.26 or 255.27 of the penal law provided
that the district attorney consents. Such support person shall not
provide the witness with an answer to any question or otherwise
participate in such proceeding and shall first take an oath before
the grand jury that he or she will keep secret all matters before
such grand jury within his or her knowledge.
3a) Upon the request of a deaf or hearing-impaired grand juror, the
prosecutor shall provide a sign language interpreter for such
juror. Such interpreter shall be present during all proceedings of
the grand jury which the deaf or hearing-impaired grand juror
attends, including deliberation and voting. The interpreter shall,
if he or she has not previously taken the constitutional oath of
office, first take an oath before the grand jury that he or she
will faithfully interpret the testimony of the witnesses and the
statements of the prosecutor, judge and grand jurors; keep
secret all matters before such grand jury within his or her knowl-
edge; and not seek to influence the deliberations and voting of
such grand jury.
4) (a) Grand jury proceedings are secret, and no grand juror, or other
person specified in subdivision three of this section or section
215.70 of the penal law, may, except in the lawful discharge of his
duties or upon written order of the court, disclose the nature or
substance of any grand jury testimony, evidence, or any decision,
result or other matter attending a grand jury proceeding. For the
purpose of assisting the grand jury in conducting its investigation,
evidence obtained by a grand jury may be independently exam-
ined by the district attorney, members of his staff, police officers
specifically assigned to the investigation, and such other persons
as the court may specifically authorize. Such evidence may not
be disclosed to other persons without a court order. Nothing
contained herein shall prohibit a witness from disclosing his own
testimony. (b) When a district attorney obtains evidence during
a grand jury proceeding which provides reasonable cause to sus-
pect that a child has been abused or maltreated, as those terms
are defined by section ten hundred twelve of the family court
act, he must apply to the court supervising the grand jury for an
order permitting disclosure of such evidence to the state central
18 GRAND JUROR’S HANDBOOK • NEW YORK STATE UNIFIED COURT SYSTEM

register of child abuse and maltreatment. A district attorney need
not apply to the court for such order if he has previously made or
caused a report to be made to the state central register of child
abuse and maltreatment pursuant to section four hundred thir-
teen of the social services law and the evidence obtained during
the grand jury proceeding, or substantially similar information,
was included in such report. The district attorney`s application to
the court shall be made ex parte and in camera. The court must
grant the application and permit the district attorney to disclose
the evidence to the state central register of child abuse and
maltreatment unless the court finds that such disclosure would
jeopardize the life or safety of any person or interfere with a
continuing grand jury proceeding.
5) The grand jury is the exclusive judge of the facts with respect to
any matter before it.
6) The legal advisors of the grand jury are the court and the district
attorney, and the grand jury may not seek or receive legal advice
from any other source. Where necessary or appropriate, the court
or the district attorney, or both, must instruct the grand jury con-
cerning the law with respect to its duties or any matter before it,
and such instructions must be recorded in the minutes.
§ 190.30 Grand jury; rules of evidence.
1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the provisions of
article sixty, governing rules of evidence and related matters with
respect to criminal proceedings in general, are, where appropri-
ate, applicable to grand jury proceedings.
2) A report or a copy of a report made by a public servant or by a
person employed by a public servant or agency who is a physicist,
chemist, coroner or medical examiner, firearms identification
expert, examiner of questioned documents, fingerprint techni-
cian, or an expert or technician in some comparable scientific or
professional field, concerning the results of an examination, com-
parison or test performed by him in connection with a case which
is the subject of a grand jury proceeding, may, when certified by
such person as a report made by him or as a true copy thereof, be
received in such grand jury proceeding as evidence of the facts
stated therein.
2a) When the electronic transmission of a certified report, or certified
copy thereof, of the kind described in subdivision two or three-a
1-800-NY-JUROR • 1-800-695-8767 • WWW.NYJUROR.GOV 19

of this section or a sworn statement or copy thereof, of the kind
described in subdivision three of this section results in a written
document, such written document may be received in such grand
jury proceeding provided that: (a) a transmittal memorandum
completed by the person sending the report contains a certifica-
tion that the report has not been altered and a description of the
report specifying the number of pages; and (b) the person who
receives the electronically transmitted document certifies that
such document and transmittal memorandum were so received;
and (c) a certified report or a certified copy or sworn statement
or sworn copy thereof is filed with the court within twenty days
following arraignment upon the indictment; and (d) where such
written document is a sworn statement or sworn copy thereof
of the kind described in subdivision three of this section, such
sworn statement or sworn copy thereof is also provided to the de-
fendant or his counsel within twenty days following arraignment
upon the indictment.
3) A written or oral statement, under oath, by a person attesting
to one or more of the following matters may be received in such
grand jury proceeding as evidence of the facts stated therein: (a)
that person`s ownership or lawful custody of, or license to occupy,
premises, as defined in section 140.00 of the penal law, and of
the defendant`s lack of license or privilege to enter or remain
thereupon; (b) that person`s ownership of, or possessory right
in, property, the nature and monetary amount of any damage
thereto and the defendant`s lack of right to damage or tamper
with the property; (c) that person`s ownership or lawful custody
of, or license to possess property, as defined in section 155.00 of
the penal law, including an automobile or other vehicle, its value
and the defendant`s lack of superior or equal right to possession
thereof; (d) that person`s ownership of a vehicle and the absence
of his consent to the defendant`s taking, operating, exercising
control over or using it; (e) that person`s qualifications as a dealer
or other expert in appraising or evaluating a particular type of
property, his expert opinion as to the value of a certain item
or items of property of that type, and the basis for his opinion;
(f) that person`s identity as an ostensible maker, drafter, drawer,
endorser or other signator of a written instrument and its falsity
within the meaning of section 170.00 of the penal law; (g) that
person’s ownership of, or possessory right in, a credit card account
number or debit card account number, and the defendant’s lack
20 GRAND JUROR’S HANDBOOK • NEW YORK STATE UNIFIED COURT SYSTEM

of superior or equal right to use or possession thereof. Provided,
however, that no such statement shall be admitted when an ad-
versarial examination of such person has been previously ordered
pursuant to subdivision 8 of section 180.60, unless a transcript of
such examination is admitted.
3a) A sex offender registration form, sex offender registration
continuation/supplemental form, sex offender registry address
verification form, sex offender change of address form or a copy
of such form maintained by the division of criminal justice services
concerning an individual who is the subject of a grand jury pro-
ceeding, may, when certified by a person designated by the com-
missioner of the division of criminal justice services as the person
to certify such records, as a true copy thereof, be received in such
grand jury proceeding as evidence of the facts stated therein.
4) An examination of a child witness or a special witness by the
district attorney videotaped pursuant to section 190.32 of this
chapter may be received in evidence in such grand jury proceed-
ing as the testimony of such witness.
5) Nothing in subdivisions two, three or four of this section shall
be construed to limit the power of the grand jury to cause any
person to be called as a witness pursuant to subdivision three of
section 190.50.
6) Wherever it is provided in article sixty that the court in a criminal
proceeding must rule upon the competency of a witness to tes-
tify or upon the admissibility of evidence, such ruling may in an
equivalent situation in a grand jury proceeding, be made by the
district attorney.
7) Wherever it is provided in article sixty that a court presiding at a
jury trial must instruct the jury with respect to the significance,
legal effect or evaluation of evidence, the district attorney, in an
equivalent situation in a grand jury proceeding, may so instruct
the grand jury.
8) (a) A business record may be received in such grand jury proceed-
ings as evidence of the following facts and similar facts stated
therein: (i) a person’s use of, subscription to and charges and
payments for communication equipment and services including
but not limited to equipment or services provided by telephone
companies and internet service providers, but not including
recorded conversations or images communicated thereby; and
1-800-NY-JUROR • 1-800-695-8767 • WWW.NYJUROR.GOV 21

(ii) financial transactions, and a person’s ownership or possessory
interest in any account, at a bank, insurance company, brokerage,
exchange or banking organization as defined in section two of
the banking law. (b) Any business record offered for consider-
ation by a grand jury pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subdivision
must be accompanied by a written statement, under oath, that
(i) contains a list or description of the records it accompanies, (ii)
attests in substance that the person making the statement is a
duly authorized custodian of the records or other employee or
agent of the business who is familiar with such records, and (iii)
attests in substance that such records were made in the regular
course of business and that it was the regular course of such
business to make such records at the time of the recorded act,
transaction, occurrence or event, or within a reasonable time
thereafter. Such written statement may also include a statement
identifying the name and job description of the person making
the statement, specifying the matters set forth in subparagraph
(ii) of this paragraph and attesting that the business has made a
diligent search and does not possess a particular record or records
addressing a matter set forth in paragraph (a) of this subdivision,
and such statement may be received at grand jury proceedings
as evidence of the fact that the business does not possess such
record or records. When records of a business are accompanied
by more than one sworn written statement of its employees or
agents, such statements may be considered together in deter-
mining the admissibility of the records under this subdivision. For
the purpose of this subdivision, the term “business records” does
not include any records prepared by law enforcement agencies
or prepared by any entity in anticipation of litigation. (c) Any
business record offered to a grand jury pursuant to paragraph (a)
of this subdivision that includes material beyond that described
in such paragraph (a) shall be redacted to exclude such additional
material, or received subject to a limiting instruction that the
grand jury shall not consider such additional material in support of
any criminal charge. (d) No such records shall be admitted when
an adversarial examination of such a records custodian or other
employee of such business who was familiar with such records has
been previously ordered pursuant to subdivision eight of section
180.60 of this chapter, unless a transcript of such examination is
admitted. (e) Nothing in this subdivision shall affect the admissi-
bility of business records in the grand jury on any basis other than
that set forth in this subdivision.
22 GRAND JUROR’S HANDBOOK • NEW YORK STATE UNIFIED COURT SYSTEM

§ 190.32 Videotaped examination; definitions, application, order
and procedure.
1) Definitions. As used in this section: (a) “Child witness” means a
person twelve years old or less whom the people intend to call as
witness in a grand jury proceeding to give evidence concerning
any crime defined in article one hundred thirty or two hundred
sixty or section 255.25 of the penal law of which the person was
a victim. (b) “Special witness” means a person whom the people
intend to call as a witness in a grand jury proceeding and who
is either: (i) Unable to attend and testify in person in the grand
jury proceeding because the person is either physically ill or inca-
pacitated; or (ii) More than twelve years old and who is likely to
suffer very severe emotional or mental stress if required to testify
in person concerning any crime defined in article one hundred
thirty or two hundred sixty or section 255.25 of the penal law
to which the person was a witness or of which the person was a
victim. (c) “Operator” means a person employed by the district at-
torney who operates the video camera to record the examination
of a child witness or a special witness.
2) In lieu of requiring a witness who is a child witness to appear in
person and give evidence in a grand jury proceeding, the district
attorney may cause the examination of such witness to be vid-
eotaped in accordance with the provisions of subdivision five of
this section.
3) Whenever the district attorney has reason to believe that a wit-
ness is a special witness, he may make an ex parte application to
the court for an order authorizing the videotaping of an exam-
ination of such special witness and the subsequent introduction
in evidence in a grand jury proceeding of that videotape in lieu
of the live testimony of such special witness. The application
must be in writing, must state the grounds of the application and
must contain sworn allegations of fact, whether of the district
attorney or another person or persons, supporting such grounds.
Such allegations may be based upon personal knowledge of the
deponent or upon information and belief, provided, that in the
latter event, the sources of such information and the grounds for
such belief are stated.
4) If the court is satisfied that a witness is a special witness, it shall
issue an order authorizing the videotaping of such special wit-
ness in accordance with the provisions of subdivision five of this
1-800-NY-JUROR • 1-800-695-8767 • WWW.NYJUROR.GOV 23

section. The court order and the application and all supporting
papers shall not be disclosed to any person except upon further
court order.
5) The videotaping of an examination either of a child witness or a
special witness shall proceed as follows: (a) An examination of a
child witness or a special witness which is to be videotaped pur-
suant to this section may be conducted anywhere and at any time
provided that the operator begins the videotape by recording a
statement by the district attorney of the date, time and place of
the examination. In addition, the district attorney shall identify
himself, the operator and all other persons present. (b) An accu-
rate clock with a sweep second hand shall be placed next to or
behind the witness in such position as to enable the operator to
videotape the clock and the witness together during the entire
examination. In the alternative, a date and time generator shall
be used to superimpose the day, hour, minute and second over
the video portion of the recording during the entire examination.
(c) A social worker, rape crisis counselor, psychologist or other
professional providing emotional support to a child witness or to
a special witness, as defined in subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (b)
of subdivision one of this section, or any of those persons enumer-
ated in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f ) and (g) of subdivision
three of section 190.25 may be present during the videotaping
except that a doctor, nurse or other medical assistant also may be
present if required by the attendant circumstances. Each person
present, except the witness, must, if he has not previously taken
a constitutional oath of office or an oath that he will keep secret
all matters before a grand jury, must take an oath on the record
that he will keep secret the videotaped examination. (d) The dis-
trict attorney shall state for the record the name of the witness,
and the caption and the grand jury number, if any, of the case.
If the witness to be examined is a child witness, the date of the
witness` birth must be recorded. If the witness to be examined is a
special witness, the date of the order authorizing the videotaped
examination and the name of the justice who issued the order
shall be recorded. (e) If the witness will give sworn testimony, the
administration of the oath must be recorded. If the witness will
give unsworn testimony, a statement that the testimony is not
under oath must be recorded. (f ) If the examination requires the
use of more than one tape, the operator shall record a statement
of the district attorney at the end of each tape declaring that
24 GRAND JUROR’S HANDBOOK • NEW YORK STATE UNIFIED COURT SYSTEM

such tape has ended and referring to the succeeding tape. At the
beginning of such succeeding tape, the operator shall record a
statement of the district attorney identifying himself, the witness
being examined and the number of tapes which have been used
to record the examination of such witness. At the conclusion of
the examination the operator shall record a statement of the dis-
trict attorney certifying that the recording has been completed,
the number of tapes on which the recording has been made and
that such tapes constitute a complete and accurate record of the
examination of the witness. (g) A videotape of an examination
conducted pursuant to this section shall not be edited unless
upon further order of the court.
6) When the videotape is introduced in evidence and played in the
grand jury, the grand jury stenographer shall record the examina-
tion in the same manner as if the witness had testified in person.
7) Custody of the videotape shall be maintained in the same manner
as custody of the grand jury minutes.
§ 190.35 Grand jury; definitions of terms.
The term definitions contained in section 50.10 are applicable to
sections 190.40, 190.45 and 190.50.
§ 190.40 Grand jury; witnesses, compulsion of evidence
and immunity.
1) Every witness in a grand jury proceeding must give any evidence
legally requested of him regardless of any protest or belief on his
part that it may tend to incriminate him.
2) A witness who gives evidence in a grand jury proceeding receives
immunity unless: (a) He has effectively waived such immunity
pursuant to section 190.45; or (b) Such evidence is not responsive
to any inquiry and is gratuitously given or volunteered by the
witness with knowledge that it is not responsive. (c) The evidence
given by the witness consists only of books, papers, records or
other physical evidence of an enterprise, as defined in subdivision
one of section 175.00 of the penal law, the production of which
is required by a subpoena duces tecum, and the witness does not
possess a privilege against self-incrimination with respect to the
production of such evidence. Any further evidence given by the
witness entitles the witness to immunity except as provided in
subparagraph (a) and (b) of this subdivision.
1-800-NY-JUROR • 1-800-695-8767 • WWW.NYJUROR.GOV 25

§ 190.45 Grand jury; waiver of immunity.
1) A waiver of immunity is a written instrument subscribed by a
person who is or is about to become a witness in a grand jury
proceeding, stipulating that he waives his privilege against
self-incrimination and any possible or prospective immunity to
which he would otherwise become entitled, pursuant to section
190.40, as a result of giving evidence in such proceeding.
2) A waiver of immunity is not effective unless and until it is sworn
to before the grand jury conducting the proceeding in which the
subscriber has been called as a witness.
3) A person who is called by the people as a witness in a grand jury
proceeding and requested by the district attorney to subscribe
and swear to a waiver of immunity before giving evidence has
a right to confer with counsel before deciding whether he will
comply with such request, and, if he desires to avail himself of
such right, he must be accorded a reasonable time in which to
obtain and confer with counsel for such purpose. The district
attorney must inform the witness of all such rights before ob-
taining his execution of such a waiver of immunity. Any waiver
obtained, subscribed or sworn to in violation of the provisions of
this subdivision is invalid and ineffective.
4) If a grand jury witness subscribes and swears to a waiver of
immunity upon a written agreement with the district attorney
that the interrogation will be limited to certain specified subjects,
matters or areas of conduct, and if after the commencement of
his testimony he is interrogated and testifies concerning another
subject, matter or area of conduct not included in such written
agreement, he receives immunity with respect to any further tes-
timony which he may give concerning such other subject, matter
or area of conduct and the waiver of immunity is to that extent
ineffective.
§ 190.50 Grand jury; who may call witnesses;
defendant as witness.
1) Except as provided in this section, no person has a right to call a
witness or appear as a witness in a grand jury proceeding.
2) The people may call as a witness in a grand jury proceeding any
person believed by the district attorney to possess relevant infor-
mation or knowledge.
26 GRAND JUROR’S HANDBOOK • NEW YORK STATE UNIFIED COURT SYSTEM

3) The grand jury may cause to be called as a witness any person be-
lieved by it to possess relevant information or knowledge. If the
grand jury desires to hear any such witness who was not called by
the people, it may direct the district attorney to issue and serve
a subpoena upon such witness, and the district attorney must
comply with such direction. At any time after such a direction,
however, or at any time after the service of a subpoena pursuant
to such a direction and before the return date thereof, the people
may apply to the court which impaneled the grand jury for an
order vacating or modifying such direction or subpoena on the
ground that such is in the public interest. Upon such application,
the court may in its discretion vacate the direction or subpoena,
attach reasonable conditions thereto, or make other appropriate
qualification thereof.
4) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision three, the dis-
trict attorney may demand that any witness thus called at the
instance of the grand jury sign a waiver of immunity pursuant
to section 190.45 before being sworn, and upon such demand
no oath may be administered to such witness unless and until he
complies therewith.
5) Although not called as a witness by the people or at the instance of
the grand jury, a person has a right to be a witness in a grand jury
proceeding under circumstances prescribed in this subdivision: (a)
When a criminal charge against a person is being or is about to
be or has been submitted to a grand jury, such person has a right
to appear before such grand jury as a witness in his own behalf
if, prior to the filing of any indictment or any direction to file a
prosecutor`s information in the matter, he serves upon the district
attorney of the county a written notice making such request and
stating an address to which communications may be sent. The
district attorney is not obliged to inform such a person that such
a grand jury proceeding against him is pending, in progress or
about to occur unless such person is a defendant who has been
arraigned in a local criminal court upon a currently undisposed
of felony complaint charging an offense which is a subject of
the prospective or pending grand jury proceeding. In such case,
the district attorney must notify the defendant or his attorney
of the prospective or pending grand jury proceeding and accord
the defendant a reasonable time to exercise his right to appear
as a witness therein; (b) Upon service upon the district attorney
of a notice requesting appearance before a grand jury pursuant
1-800-NY-JUROR • 1-800-695-8767 • WWW.NYJUROR.GOV 27

to paragraph (a), the district attorney must notify the foreman
of the grand jury of such request, and must subsequently serve
upon the applicant, at the address specified by him, a notice that
he will be heard by the grand jury at a given time and place.
Upon appearing at such time and place, and upon signing and
submitting to the grand jury a waiver of immunity pursuant to
section 190.45, such person must be permitted to testify before
the grand jury and to give any relevant and competent evidence
concerning the case under consideration. Upon giving such
evidence, he is subject to examination by the people. (c) Any in-
dictment or direction to file a prosecutor`s information obtained
or filed in violation of the provisions of paragraph (a) or (b) is
invalid and, upon a motion made pursuant to section 170.50 or
section 210.20, must be dismissed; provided that a motion based
upon such ground must be made not more than five days after
the defendant has been arraigned upon the indictment or, as the
case may be, upon the prosecutor`s information resulting from
the grand jury`s direction to file the same. If the contention is
not so asserted in timely fashion, it is waived and the indictment
or prosecutor`s information may not thereafter be challenged on
such ground.
6) A defendant or person against whom a criminal charge is being
or is about to be brought in a grand jury proceeding may request
the grand jury, either orally or in writing, to cause a person des-
ignated by him to be called as a witness in such proceeding. The
grand jury may as a matter of discretion grant such request and
cause such witness to be called pursuant to subdivision three.
7) Where a subpoena is made pursuant to this section, all papers and
proceedings relating to the subpoena and any motion to quash,
fix conditions, modify or compel compliance shall be kept secret
and not disclosed to the public by any public officer or public
employee or any other individual described in section 215.70 of
the penal law. This subdivision shall not apply where the person
subpoenaed and the prosecutor waive the provisions of this
subdivision. This subdivision shall not prevent the publication of
decisions and orders made in connection with such proceedings
or motions, provided the caption and content of the decision are
written or altered by the court to reasonably preclude identifica-
tion of the person subpoenaed.
28 GRAND JUROR’S HANDBOOK • NEW YORK STATE UNIFIED COURT SYSTEM

§ 190.52 Grand jury; attorney for witness.
1) Any person who appears as a witness and has signed a waiver of
immunity in a grand jury proceeding, has a right to an attorney
as provided in this section. Such a witness may appear with a
retained attorney, or if he is financially unable to obtain counsel,
an attorney who shall be assigned by the superior court which im-
paneled the grand jury. Such assigned attorney shall be assigned
pursuant to the same plan and in the same manner as counsel are
provided to persons charged with crime pursuant to section seven
hundred twenty-two of the county law.
2) The attorney for such witness may be present with the witness in
the grand jury room. The attorney may advise the witness, but
may not otherwise take any part in the proceeding.
3) The superior court which impaneled the grand jury shall have the
same power to remove an attorney from the grand jury room as
such court has with respect to an attorney in a courtroom.
§ 190.55 Grand jury; matters to be heard and examined; duties and
authority of district attorney.
1) A grand jury may hear and examine evidence concerning the al-
leged commission of any offense prosecutable in the courts of the
county, and concerning any misconduct, nonfeasance or neglect in
public office by a public servant, whether criminal or otherwise.
2) District attorneys are required or authorized to submit evidence
to grand juries under the following circumstances: (a) A district
attorney must submit to a grand jury evidence concerning a felony
allegedly committed by a defendant who, on the basis of a felony
complaint filed with a local criminal court of the county, has been
held for the action of a grand jury of such county, except where in-
dictment has been waived by the defendant pursuant to article one
hundred ninety-five. (b) A district attorney must submit to a grand
jury evidence concerning a misdemeanor allegedly committed by a
defendant who has been charged therewith by a local criminal court
accusatory instrument, in any case where a superior court of the
county has, pursuant to subdivision one of section 170.25, ordered
that such misdemeanor charge be prosecuted by indictment in a
superior court. (c) A district attorney may submit to a grand jury any
available evidence concerning an offense prosecutable in the courts
of the county, or concerning misconduct, nonfeasance or neglect in
public office by a public servant, whether criminal or otherwise.
1-800-NY-JUROR • 1-800-695-8767 • WWW.NYJUROR.GOV 29

§ 190.60 Grand jury; action to be taken.
After hearing and examining evidence as prescribed in section 190.55,
a grand jury may:
1) Indict a person for an offense, as provided in section 190.65;
2) Direct the district attorney to file a prosecutor`s information with
a local criminal court, as provided in section 190.70;
3) Direct the district attorney to file a request for removal to the
family court, as provided in section 190.71 of this article.
4) Dismiss the charge before it, as provided in section 190.75;
5) Submit a grand jury report, as provided in section 190.85.
§ 190.65 Grand jury; when indictment is authorized.
1) Subject to the rules prescribing the kinds of offenses which may
be charged in an indictment, a grand jury may indict a person
for an offense when (a) the evidence before it is legally sufficient
to establish that such person committed such offense provided,
however, such evidence is not legally sufficient when corrobo-
ration that would be required, as a matter of law, to sustain a
conviction for such offense is absent, and (b) competent and ad-
missible evidence before it provides reasonable cause to believe
that such person committed such offense.
2) The offense or offenses for which a grand jury may indict a person
in any particular case are not limited to that or those which may
have been designated, at the commencement of the grand jury
proceeding, to be the subject of the inquiry; and even in a case
submitted to it upon a court order, pursuant to the provisions of
section 170.25, directing that a misdemeanor charge pending in a
local criminal court be prosecuted by indictment, the grand jury
may indict the defendant for a felony if the evidence so warrants.
3) Upon voting to indict a person, a grand jury must, through its
foreman or acting foreman, file an indictment with the court by
which it was impaneled.
30 GRAND JUROR’S HANDBOOK • NEW YORK STATE UNIFIED COURT SYSTEM

§ 190.70 Grand jury; direction to file prosecutor`s information and
related matters.
1) Except in a case submitted to it pursuant to the provisions of
section 170.25, a grand jury may direct the district attorney to
file in a local criminal court a prosecutor`s information charging
a person with an offense other than a felony when (a) the evi-
dence before it is legally sufficient to establish that such person
committed such offense, and (b) competent and admissible
evidence before it provides reasonable cause to believe that such
person committed such offense. In such case, the grand jury must,
through its foreman or acting foreman, file such direction with
the court by which it was impaneled.
2) Such direction must be signed by the foreman or acting foreman. It
must contain a plain and concise statement of the conduct constitut-
ing the offense to be charged, equivalent in content and precision
to the factual statement required to be contained in an indictment
pursuant to subdivision seven of section 200.50. Subject to the
rules prescribed in sections 200.20 and 200.40 governing joinder in
a single indictment of multiple offenses and multiple defendants,
such grand jury direction may, where appropriate, specify multiple
offenses of less than felony grade and multiple defendants, and
may direct that the prospective prosecutor`s information charge
a single defendant with multiple offenses, or multiple defendants
jointly with either a single offense or multiple offenses.
3) Upon the filing of such grand jury direction, the court must, unless
such direction is insufficient on its face, issue an order approving
such direction and ordering the district attorney to file such a
prosecutor`s information in a designated local criminal court
having trial jurisdiction of the offense or offenses in question.
§ 190.71 Grand jury; direction to file request for removal to
family court.
(a) Except as provided in subdivision six of section 200.20 of this
chapter, a grand jury may not indict (i) a person thirteen years of
age for any conduct or crime other than conduct constituting a crime
defined in subdivisions one and two of section 125.25 (murder in the
second degree) or such conduct as a sexually motivated felony, where
authorized pursuant to section 130.91 of the penal law; (ii) a person
fourteen or fifteen years of age for any conduct or crime other than
conduct constituting a crime defined in subdivisions one and two
1-800-NY-JUROR • 1-800-695-8767 • WWW.NYJUROR.GOV 31

of section 125.25 (murder in the second degree) and in subdivision
three of such section provided that the underlying crime for the
murder charge is one for which such person is criminally responsible;
135.25 (kidnapping in the first degree); 150.20 (arson in the first
degree); subdivisions one and two of section 120.10 (assault in the
first degree); 125.20 (manslaughter in the first degree); subdivisions
one and two of section 130.35 (rape in the first degree); subdivisions
one and two of section 130.50 (criminal sexual act in the first degree);
130.70 (aggravated sexual abuse in the first degree); 140.30 (burglary
in the first degree); subdivision one of section 140.25 (burglary in the
second degree); 150.15 (arson in the second degree); 160.15 (robbery
in the first degree); subdivision two of section 160.10 (robbery in the
second degree) of the penal law; subdivision four of section 265.02
of the penal law, where such firearm is possessed on school grounds,
as that phrase is defined in subdivision fourteen of section 220.00 of
the penal law; or section 265.03 of the penal law, where such machine
gun or such firearm is possessed on school grounds, as that phrase is
defined in subdivision fourteen of section 220.00 of the penal law;
or defined in the penal law as an attempt to commit murder in the
second degree or kidnapping in the first degree, or such conduct as
a sexually motivated felony, where authorized pursuant to section
130.91 of the penal law. (b) A grand jury may vote to file a request to
remove a charge to the family court if it finds that a person thirteen,
fourteen or fifteen years of age did an act which, if done by a person
over the age of sixteen, would constitute a crime provided (1) such
act is one for which it may not indict; (2) it does not indict such
person for a crime; and (3) the evidence before it is legally sufficient
to establish that such person did such act and competent and
admissible evidence before it provides reasonable cause to believe
that such person did such act. (c) Upon voting to remove a charge to
the family court pursuant to subdivision (b) of this section, the grand
jury must, through its foreman or acting foreman, file a request to
transfer such charge to the family court. Such request shall be filed
with the court by which it was impaneled. It must (1) allege that a
person named therein did any act which, if done by a person over the
age of sixteen, would constitute a crime; (2) specify the act and the
time and place of its commission; and (3) be signed by the foreman
or the acting foreman. (d) Upon the filing of such grand jury request,
the court must, unless such request is improper or insufficient on its
face, issue an order approving such request and direct that the charge
be removed to the family court in accordance with the provisions of
article seven hundred twenty-five of this chapter.
32 GRAND JUROR’S HANDBOOK • NEW YORK STATE UNIFIED COURT SYSTEM

§ 190.75 Grand jury; dismissal of charge.
1) If upon a charge that a designated person committed a crime, ei-
ther (a) the evidence before the grand jury is not legally sufficient
to establish that such person committed such crime or any other
offense, or (b) the grand jury is not satisfied that there is reason-
able cause to believe that such person committed such crime or
any other offense, it must dismiss the charge. In such case, the
grand jury must, through its foreman or acting foreman, file its
finding of dismissal with the court by which it was impaneled.
2) If the defendant was previously held for the action of the grand
jury by a local criminal court, the superior court to which such
dismissal is presented must order the defendant released from
custody if he is in the custody of the sheriff, or, if he is at liberty
on bail, it must exonerate the bail.
3) When a charge has been so dismissed, it may not again be submit-
ted to a grand jury unless the court in its discretion authorizes or
directs the people to resubmit such charge to the same or another
grand jury. If in such case the charge is again dismissed, it may not
again be submitted to a grand jury.
4) Whenever all charges against a designated person have been so
dismissed, the district attorney must within ninety days of the
filing of the finding of such dismissal, notify that person of the
dismissal by regular mail to his last known address unless resub-
mission has been permitted pursuant to subdivision three of this
section or an order of postponement of such service is obtained
upon a showing of good cause and exigent circumstances.
§ 190.80 Grand jury; release of defendant upon failure of timely
grand jury action.
Upon application of a defendant who on the basis of a felony
complaint has been held by a local criminal court for the action
of a grand jury, and who, at the time of such order or subsequent
thereto, has been committed to the custody of the sheriff pending
such grand jury action, and who has been confined in such custody
for a period of more than forty-five days, or, in the case of a juvenile
offender, thirty days, without the occurrence of any grand jury action
or disposition pursuant to subdivision one, two or three of section
190.60, the superior court by which such grand jury was or is to be
impaneled must release him on his own recognizance unless: (a) The
lack of a grand jury disposition during such period of confinement
1-800-NY-JUROR • 1-800-695-8767 • WWW.NYJUROR.GOV 33

was due to the defendant`s request, action or condition, or occurred
with his consent; or (b) The people have shown good cause why such
order of release should not be issued. Such good cause must consist
of some compelling fact or circumstance which precluded grand jury
action within the prescribed period or rendered the same against the
interest of justice.
§ 190.85 Grand jury; grand jury reports.
1) The grand jury may submit to the court by which it was im-
paneled, a report: (a) Concerning misconduct, non-feasance
or neglect in public office by a public servant as the basis for a
recommendation of removal or disciplinary action; or (b) Stating
that after investigation of a public servant it finds no misconduct,
nonfeasance or neglect in public office by him provided that such
public servant has requested the submission of such report; or (c)
Proposing recommendations for legislative, executive or adminis-
trative action in the public interest based upon stated findings.
2) The court to which such report is submitted shall examine it and
the minutes of the grand jury and, except as otherwise provided
in subdivision four, shall make an order accepting and filing
such report as a public record only if the court is satisfied that
it complies with the provisions of subdivision one and that: (a)
The report is based upon facts revealed in the course of an in-
vestigation authorized by section 190.55 and is supported by the
preponderance of the credible and legally admissible evidence;
and (b) When the report is submitted pursuant to paragraph (a)
of subdivision one, that each person named therein was afford-
ed an opportunity to testify before the grand jury prior to the
filing of such report, and when the report is submitted pursuant
to paragraph (b) or (c) of subdivision one, it is not critical of an
identified or identifiable person.
3) The order accepting a report pursuant to paragraph (a) of subdi-
vision one, and the report itself, must be sealed by the court and
may not be filed as a public record, or be subject to subpoena or
otherwise be made public until at least thirty-one days after a
copy of the order and the report are served upon each public ser-
vant named therein, or if an appeal is taken pursuant to section
190.90, until the affirmance of the order accepting the report, or
until reversal of the order sealing the report, or until dismissal of
the appeal of the named public servant by the appellate division,
34 GRAND JUROR’S HANDBOOK • NEW YORK STATE UNIFIED COURT SYSTEM

whichever occurs later. Such public servant may file with the clerk
of the court an answer to such report, not later than twenty days
after service of the order and report upon him. Such an answer
shall plainly and concisely state the facts and law constituting
the defense of the public servant to the charges in said report,
and, except for those parts of the answer which the court may
determine to be scandalously or prejudicially and unnecessarily
inserted therein, shall become an appendix to the report. Upon
the expiration of the time set forth in this subdivision, the district
attorney shall deliver a true copy of such report, and the appen-
dix if any, for appropriate action, to each public servant or body
having removal or disciplinary authority over each public servant
named therein.
4) Upon the submission of a report pursuant to subdivision one, if
the court finds that the filing of such report as a public record
may prejudice fair consideration of a pending criminal matter, it
must order such report sealed and such report may not be subject
to subpoena or public inspection during the pendency of such
criminal matter, except upon order of the court.
5) Whenever the court to which a report is submitted pursuant to
paragraph (a) of subdivision one is not satisfied that the report
complies with the provisions of subdivision two, it may direct that
additional testimony be taken before the same grand jury, or it
must make an order sealing such report, and the report may not
be filed as a public record, or be subject to subpoena or otherwise
be made public.
§ 190.90 Grand jury; appeal from order concerning grand
jury reports.
1) When a court makes an order accepting a report of a grand jury
pursuant to paragraph (a) of subdivision one of section 190.85, any
public servant named therein may appeal the order; and when a
court makes an order sealing a report of a grand jury pursuant to
subdivision five of section 190.85, the district attorney or other
attorney designated by the grand jury may appeal the order.
2) When a court makes an order sealing a report of a grand jury pur-
suant to subdivision five of section 190.85, the district attorney or
other attorney designated by the grand jury may, within ten days
after service of a copy of the order and report upon each public
servant named in the report, appeal the order to the appellate
1-800-NY-JUROR • 1-800-695-8767 • WWW.NYJUROR.GOV 35

division of the department in which the order was made, by filing
in duplicate a notice of appeal from the order with the clerk of
the court in which the order was made and by serving a copy of
such notice of appeal upon each such public servant. Notwith-
standing any contrary provision of section 190.85, a true copy of
the report of the grand jury shall be served, together with such
notice of appeal, upon each such public servant.
3) The mode of and time for perfecting an appeal pursuant to this
section, and the mode of and procedure for the argument there-
of, are determined by the rules of the appellate division of the
department in which the appeal is brought. Such rules shall pre-
scribe the matters referred to in subdivision one of section 460.70
and in section 460.80, except that such appeal is a preferred cause
and the appellate division of each department shall promulgate
rules to effectuate such preference.
4) The record and all other presentations on appeal shall remain
sealed, except that upon reversal of the order sealing the report
or dismissal of the appeal of the named public servant by the ap-
pellate division, the report of the grand jury, with the appendix,
if any, shall be filed as a public record as provided in subdivision
three of section 190.85.
5) The procedure provided for in this section shall be the exclusive
manner of reviewing an order made pursuant to section 190.85
and the appellate division of the supreme court shall be the sole
court having jurisdiction of such an appeal. The order of the
appellate division finally determining such appeal shall not be
subject to review in any other court or proceeding.
6) The grand jury in an appeal pursuant to this section shall be
represented by the district attorney unless the report relates to
him or his office, in which event the grand jury may designate
another attorney.
