T.P.I.—Crim. 7.01 First degree murder
(premeditated killing) (for offenses committed on or
1
after July 1, 1995)
Any person who commits the offense of first degree murder is guilty of a crime.
For you to find the defendant guilty of this offense, the state must have proven beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of the
2
following essential elements:
(1)that the defendant unlawfully killed the alleged victim;
and
(2) that the defendant acted intentionally. A person acts intentionally when it is the person's conscious objective or desire to
3
cause the death of the alleged victim;
and
(3) that the killing was premeditated.
A premeditated act is one done after the exercise of reflection and judgment. Premeditation means that the intent to kill must
have been formed prior to the act itself. It is not necessary that the purpose to kill preexist in the mind of the accused for
any definite period of time. The mental state of the accused at the time [he][she] allegedly decided to kill must be carefully
considered in order to determine whether the accused was sufficiently free from excitement and passion as to be capable of
5
premeditation. If the design to kill was formed with premeditation, it is immaterial that the accused may have been in a state
of passion or excitement when the design was carried into effect. Furthermore, premeditation can be found if the decision to kill
6
is first formed during the heat of passion, but the accused commits the act after the passion has subsided.

Any person who commits second degree murder is guilty of a crime.
For you to find the defendant guilty of this offense, the state must have proven beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of the
1

T.P.I.—Crim. 7.07 Criminally negligent homicide
Any person who commits criminally negligent homicide is guilty of a crime.
For you to find the defendant guilty of this offense, the state must have proven beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of the
1
following essential elements:
(1)that the defendant's conduct resulted in the death of the alleged victim;
and
(2)that the defendant acted with criminal negligence;
“Criminal negligence” means that a person acts with criminal negligence when the person ought to be aware of a substantial and
unjustifiable risk that the alleged victim will be killed. The risk must be of such a nature and degree that the failure to perceive
it constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that an ordinary person would exercise under all the circumstances as
10
viewed from the accused person's standpoint.
The requirement of criminal negligence is also established if it is shown that the defendant acted intentionally, knowingly or
11
recklessly.
