## Conspiracy law: {#slide-26}

A separate crime of conspiracy: working with others to commit crime

Crime intended need not be completed: inchoate

Does not merge into completed crime: if choate, two separate convictions and punishments, one for conspiracy, one for target offense. 

PLUS: A possible theory of substantive responsibility for crimes committed by others: conspiratorial accomplice liability \--  Pinkerton

## 18 U.S. Code § 371.Conspiracy to commit offense or to defraud United States {#slide-30}

If two or more  persons  conspire either to commit any  offense  against the  United States , or to defraud the  United States , or any  agency  thereof in any manner or for any purpose, and one or more of such  persons  do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.

If, however, the  offense , the commission of which is the object of the conspiracy, is a misdemeanor only, the punishment for such conspiracy shall not exceed the maximum punishment provided for such misdemeanor.

## Note on "collusion" from Mueller Report: {#slide-31}

Collusion is largely synonymous with conspiracy as that crime is set forth in the general federal conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. §371. See  Black's Law Dictionary  321 (10th ed. 2014) (collusion is "\[a\]n agreement to defraud another or to do or obtain something forbidden by law\"); 1 Alexander Burrill,  A Law Dictionary and Glossary  311 (1871) ("An agreement between two or more persons to defraud another by the forms of law, or to employ such forms as means of accomplishing some unlawful object.\"); 1  Bouvier's  Law Dictionary  352 (1897) ("An agreement between two or more persons to defraud a person of his rights by the forms of law, or to obtain an object forbidden by law.\").
