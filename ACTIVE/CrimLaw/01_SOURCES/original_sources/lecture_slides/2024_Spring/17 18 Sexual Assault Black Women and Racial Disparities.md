Black women are disproportionately affected by sexual assault.

Studies that examined charging decisions in sexual assault cases show that prosecutors were more likely to file charges in cases involving white victims than those with non-white or Black victims.

Survivors of sexual assault who are Black women disproportionately face criminalization.

"Tracy McCarter's case is only one example of how the United States' criminal legal system deems that certain individuals, particularly Black women, have no claim to self-defense."

 - Survived and Punished (Feb. 3, 2024)

(Sept. 27, 2023)

"This is part of the power of abolitionist defense campaigns by groups like Survived and Punished---to connect the criminalization of one to the oppression of all. In McCarter's case, the relentless collective advocacy on behalf of McCarter combined with the collective care shown by all members of her defense campaign---not just for McCarter, but for each other---brought out the dehumanizing nature of a process that allowed McCarter's case to drag on for more than two years before its dismissal in December 2022."

Racial Disparities in the Prosecution of Sexual Assault

Impact of Racial Bias on Decision-Making

- Before the Civil War, white men frequently raped enslaved Black women, many of whom were put in a particularly vulnerable position without legal redress, as the legal system operated in a Black offender/white victim rape paradigm, limiting the social meaning of rape. The legal system therefore did not acknowledge the rape of Black women. 1

Confronting Racial Bias Against Black and African American Victims in the Prosecution of Sexual Violence, Domestic Violence, Stalking, and Human Trafficking  (by  AEquitas  and The National Black Prosecutors Association, with Wendy Gu and Priscilla Hamilton, April 2021):

- Several studies that examined charging decisions in sexual assault cases show that  prosecutors are  more likely to file charges in cases involving White victims than those with non-White or Black victims. 2  
- Studies have also shown that White mock jurors view Black victims as less truthful and more responsible for their assaults, as compared to White victims. 3  
- Moreover, this research suggests that mock jurors are more sympathetic to victims and defendants who possess similar characteristics to them, including race---a major issue for Black victims and defendants who often face predominantly White juries. 4
