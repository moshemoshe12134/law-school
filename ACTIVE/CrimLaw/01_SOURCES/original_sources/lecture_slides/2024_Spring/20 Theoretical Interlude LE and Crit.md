## The indictment against Socrates (as reported by Diogenes Laertius circa 230 CE) {#slide-2}

This indictment and affidavit is sworn by Meletus, the son of Meletus of Pitthos, against Socrates, the son of Sophroniscus of Alopece: Socrates is guilty of refusing to recognize the gods recognized by the state, and of introducing new divinities.  He is also guilty of corrupting the youth.  The penalty demanded is death.

## 1960s:  Law &  \[empirics\] {#slide-13}

Law & Economics:  

	 Positive :  common law evolves toward efficient outcomes

	 Normative : select rules that maximize wealth measured by aggregate consumer willingness to pay for goods and services.  Social welfare maximizing.  

	 Example :   Posner (1985) An Economic Theory of the Criminal Law

Law & Society:

	 Positive : difference between the law on the books and the law in action.  GAP studies.  Power matters.

	 Normative : focus on distributions of power. 

	 Example :   Galanter (1974):  Why the Haves Come out Ahead. 

## Beccaria  and Bentham: Economic Theories of Criminal Law {#slide-14}

- Specific vs. General Deterrence

- E-Punishment = e-detection x sentence

- Punishment must exceed e-benefit 

- Marginal deterrence

- Speed of punishment

## Old theory of deterrence \-- RAT {#slide-15}

	P = probable punishment

	D = probability of detection

COSTS OF POLICING AND PUNISHING

COSTS OF CRIME

Least policing costs

Least crime

## Richard Posner (1985) {#slide-28}

	 " The major function of criminal law in a capitalist society is to prevent people from bypassing the system of voluntary, compensated exchange---the  " market, "  explicit or implicit---in situations where, because transaction costs are low, the market is a more efficient method of allocating resources than forced exchange. Market bypassing in such situations is inefficient---in the sense in which economists equate efficiency with wealth maximization---no matter how much utility it may confer on the offender. "

## Notice {#slide-29}

Bentham on deterrence

Becker on crime

Definition of crime assumed

Posner:  crime = market bypassing....

So crime becomes = inefficient behavior

## Central Tenets for Posner {#slide-30}

Everything is a market (sex, babies, etc.)

Definition of Crime:  inefficient behavior

Rational Choice Assumptions 

E-Punishment must exceed e-benefit 

Punishment = e-detection x l-sentence

Marginal deterrence key

Fines vs. imprisonment

Legal rules:  maximize marginal deterrence

## Minimize Cost of (Profiled) Crime {#slide-44}

	Total social costs include costs associated with the profiled crime itself and with the policing technique (e.g., searching):

- 

		Crime costs =  D   \[  O M  (I M  )  Pop M   + O W  (I W  )  Pop W  \]

- 

		 Search costs =  Q   \[  I M  Pop M   + I W  Pop W  \]

## 1960s:  Law &  \[empirics\] {#slide-57}

Law & Economics:  

	 Positive :  common law evolves toward efficient outcomes

	 Normative : select rules that maximize wealth measured by aggregate consumer willingness to pay for goods and services.  Social welfare maximizing.  

	 Example :   Posner (1985) An Economic Theory of the Criminal Law

Law & Society:

	 Positive : difference between the law on the books and the law in action.  GAP studies.  Power matters.

	 Normative : focus on distributions of power. 

	 Example :   Galanter (1974):  Why the Haves Come out Ahead. 

## 1970s/80s:	Critical Legal Studies {#slide-58}

Fundamental contradictions in the law:

			subjectivity vs. objectivity of values

			free will vs. determinism		

			rules vs. standards

Indeterminacy Thesis: neither the law, nor these contradictions are outcome determinative

Ideological Functions of Legal Discourse:

			Obscures contradictions

			Reduces appreciation of indeterminacy

			Stunts utopian thought

## The Four Tenets of Structuralism: {#slide-59}

	First, structural linguistics shifts from the study of  conscious  linguistic phenomena to study of their  unconscious  infrastructure; second, it does not treat  terms  as independent entities, taking instead as its basis of analysis the  relations  between terms; third, it introduces the concept of  system\... ; finally, structural linguistics aims at discovering  general laws , either by induction or\... by logical deduction, which would give them an absolute character.

\[influence of structuralism:  Balkin p. 72\]

## Tenets of Structuralism: {#slide-60}

	

unconscious infrastructure		YES

relations between terms		YES

system of meaning			YES, BUT GAPS

general laws for prediction		Not in sense 						intended

## Kelman ,  Interpretive Constructs {#slide-61}

4 unconscious constructs :

- broad and narrow time frames

	example:  status crimes (600)

- disjoined and unified accounts

	example:  involuntary acts (603; 618)

- broad and narrow views of intent

	example:  intent to kill vs. intent to pull the trigger

- broad and narrow views of the defendant	

	example:  reasonable person (634)

2 conscious constructs:

- free will vs. determinism

	e.g. insanity defense as determinist (648)

	e.g. provocation (645)  

- rules vs. standards

	e.g. 660   Papachristou  case

## Kelman ,  Interpretive Constructs {#slide-62}

To what end?

p. 669:  Just be realist and do better policy work.  \[Rejected\]

p. 670:  Understand correlations with interpretation, 

		such as class conflict 

p. 671:  Just non-rational filters.

Focus on hidden assumptions

Focus on issues of power

## Feminist Legal Theory Reforms {#slide-71}

Reorganization of work roles and rules

Sexual harassment at work

Particularized dispute resolution

Widened standard of relevance (e.g. reasonable person)

Restrictions on pornography; change in definition of rape

## 1980s  Kantian Liberalism {#slide-72}

	The right is prior to the good:

- The state should guarantee a framework of fundamental rights and liberties
- but should not affirm ways of living

Respect for persons as autonomous moral agents

See  Harcourt,  " What is Poststructuralism? "  SSRN

## Discipline and Punish (1975): {#slide-78}

Shift from judging act to judging person/soul (17-18)

Shift from  " who committed act "  to  " how to rehabilitate person "  (19)

Shift from corporal to discipline (22-23)

Shift from law to normalization (21)

## (Continued) {#slide-79}

The progress narrative of the increased leniency of punishment is a myth:  shift to a more effective means of governance.

Don ' t think of punishment as about crime prevention; see what it is really doing.

Power-knowledge: formation of knowledge is what distributes social resources.

## Poststructuralism: {#slide-80}
