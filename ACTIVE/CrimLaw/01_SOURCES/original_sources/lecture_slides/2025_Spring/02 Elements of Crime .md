# McMillian v. State, 616 So.2d 933 (1993)
At arraignment on December 14, 1987, appellant pleaded not guilty. He moved to sever his case from that of Myers, and his motion was granted. At a motions hearing, he moved for a change of venue, alleging that due to extensive pretrial publicity, he would be unable to receive a fair trial in Monroe County. After an evidentiary hearing, the trial court granted the motion and transferred the case to Baldwin County for trial.

# Common Law Tradition
	Blackstone, Commentaries Book 4

	“In all temporal jurisdictions an overt act or some open evidence of an intended crime is necessary, in order to demonstrate the depravity of the will, before the man is liable to punishment. And as a vicious will without a vicious act is no crime, so an unwarrantable act without a vicious will is no crime.”

<!-- Slide number: 18 -->
# Common Law Tradition
	Blackstone, Commentaries Book 4

	to constitute a crime against human laws there must be, first, a vicious will; and second, an unlawful act consequent upon such vicious will

		= (1) mens rea and (2) actus reus

# Kelman, Interpretive Constructs
4 unconscious constructs:
broad and narrow time frames
	example:  status crimes (600)
disjoined and unified accounts
	example:  involuntary acts (603; 618)
broad and narrow views of intent
	example:  intent to kill vs. intent to pull the trigger
broad and narrow views of the defendant
	example:  reasonable person (634)

2 conscious constructs:
free will vs. determinism
	e.g. insanity defense as determinist (648)
	e.g. provocation (645)
rules vs. standards
	e.g. 660  Papachristou case

To what end?

p. 669:  Just be realist and do better policy work.

p. 670:  Interpret correlations (law is politics)

p. 671:  Just non-rational filters.
