## Three stages of death penalty law {#slide-9}

1.	Antebellum period: automatic death penalty for most felonies

Problem:	Jury nullification

2.	Mid-19th Century - 1960s: absolute jury discretion

Problem:	no guidance; arbitrary; racial discrimination

\[ 3.	 Post-Gregg  statutes: guided discretion .  \]

## Jury discretion -- 1930s-1960s {#slide-10}

	 " In that connection whether you recommend or withhold mercy is a matter solely within your discretion, calling for the exercise of your very best and most profound judgment, not motivated by considerations of sympathy or as a means of escaping a hard or disagreeable duty, but must be considered by you in the light of all the circumstances of the case with respect to the evidence submitted to you and the other circumstances surrounding this defendant. "

## Caldwell case (Ohio, 1934) {#slide-11}

The Foreman: What are grounds for granting mercy?

The Court: That rests solely and wholly in your sound

discretion. You should determine whether or not in your discretion mercy should be granted from a consideration of the evidence, the character of the crime and the attending circumstances. Are there any other questions which you have?

## California, 1957 {#slide-12}

The Foreman: \... We have a question of a point of law and we feel it would be helpful to us in determining a verdict\.... What we wish to know is, is there an interpretation of the law which may aid the jury in determining whether the punishment should be a life sentence or the maximum penalty?

 

The Court: The only thing I can tell you is that it is entirely up to you folks.... The only thing I can say to you, ladies and gentlemen, is that you heard the evidence; you are the sole judges as to what the penalty or punishment is to be in this case. That is up to you. I can\'t tell you what to do.  

## Challenges to capital punishment	 {#slide-13}

McGautha  v. California  (1971):  jury discretion is necessary and inevitable, impossible to have standards for death; no violation of 8 th /14 th .

Furman v. Georgia  (1972):  death penalty violates the U.S. Constitution

## Furman  (1972) {#slide-14}

Douglas - EPC: race discrimination

Brennan - evolving standards of decency

Stewart - wanton and freakish administration

White - too infrequent to serve punishment goal

Marshall - immoral and discriminates on race and innocence. 

## Post-Furman Types of DP Statutes {#slide-15}

Pyramid statutes

Weighing statutes

Special questions statutes

Mandatory DP statutes

## Pyramid statutes {#slide-16}

## Georgia Statute {#slide-17}

Aggravated murder includes kidnapping with bodily injury or ransom where the victim dies; aircraft hijacking; treason\... 

Requirement of aggravating circumstance:   " Where, upon a trial by jury, a person is convicted of an offense which may be punishable by death, a sentence of death shall not be imposed unless the jury verdict includes a finding of at least one statutory aggravating circumstance\... "  17-10-31

After that, jury (or judge) must recommend death. Where a statutory aggravating circumstance is found and a recommendation of death is made, the court shall sentence the defendant to death\.... Unless the jury trying the case makes a finding of at least one statutory aggravating circumstance and recommends the death sentence in its verdict, the court shall not sentence the defendant to death, provided that no such finding of statutory aggravating circumstance shall be necessary in offenses of treason or aircraft hijacking. "  

## Georgia:  Aggravating Circumstances {#slide-18}

	   (1) \... by a person with a prior record of conviction for a capital felony;    (2) \... while the offender was engaged in the commission of another capital felony\...     (3) \... knowingly created a great risk of death to more than one person     (4) \...for the purpose of receiving money or any other thing of monetary value;    (5) The murder of a judicial officer, former judicial officer, district attorney\...     (7) \... outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible, or inhuman in that it involved torture    (8) \...against any peace officer, corrections employee, or     (9) \... by a person in, or who has escaped from, the lawful custody of a peace 

   (11) \... by a person previously convicted of rape, aggravated sodomy\...

## Alabama (continued) {#slide-24}

§ 13A-5-48.  Weighing aggravating and mitigating circumstances. The process described in  Sections 13A-5-46(e)(2) ,  13A-5-46(e)(3)  and  Section 13A-5-47(e)  of weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances to determine the sentence shall not be defined to mean a mere tallying of aggravating and mitigating circumstances for the purpose of numerical comparison.

- Did the defendant act deliberately to kill? 
- Is it probable the defendant would commit violent crimes in the future?  
- If provoked, was it reasonable?

PLUS

- Should the defendant live or die when the mitigating evidence is considered? 

## North Carolina -- pre- Woodson {#slide-27}

All other kinds of murder shall be deemed murder in the second degree, and shall be punished with imprisonment of not less than two nor more than thirty years in the State\'s prison. "   N.C.Gen.Stat. § 14-17 (1969).

## SCOTUS 1976 {#slide-28}

Gregg v. Georgia -- pyramid statutes OK

Proffitt v. Florida -- weighing statutes OK

Jurek v. Texas -- special questions OK

Woodson v. North Carolina -- mandatory NO

Plus:

Lockett v. Ohio (1987) -- individualized sentencing

## Gregg and Woodson (1976) {#slide-29}

MANDATORY

NARROWED AND CHANNELLED 

CONSISTENCY

INDIVIDUAL DIGNITY

INDIVIDUALIZED SENTENCING

## Possible Legal Principles:  Furman  (1972) and  Gregg  (1976) and  Woodson  (1976) {#slide-30}

Evolving decency:  reflect our moral values

Guidance to the jury

Consistency: Narrowing of the class of murderers

Individual dignity: individualized sentencing

Woodson : no mandatory death sentences

## Death Penalty Process Today {#slide-31}

bifurcated proceedings: guilt versus penalty

judge or jury sentencing (or both)

aggravators/mitigators or special questions

individualized sentencing determination

appellate review

stages of collateral review

  1980 US Beck      \[Tomlin  gets new trial because of preclusion clause; and state courts will have to address mandatory jury verdict from  Woodson v. North Carolina   LIFE
  1981 AL Beck      No, Tomlin can be sentenced to LWOP  or death because (1) it's §2 that needs to be averred; and (2) § 2(j) serves as aggravating circumstance.        Death or LWOP;  (LWOP because 12-0 LWOP  jury)

## Steiker and Steiker, "Sober Second Thoughts" (1995/2017) {#slide-48}

Legitimation = "inducing a false or exaggerated belief in the normative justifiability of something in the social world---that is, of inducing belief in the absence of or in contradiction to evidence of what the phenomenon is 'really' like."  (429--430). 

Gramsci = "developed the idea of ' hegemony '" :  " the structure of civil society is maintained not merely by state power, but also by people ' s internalization of certain ideas and attitudes that make challenges to the existing order literally unthinkable. "   (430).

## Steiker (cont.) {#slide-49}

n.352 quoting Gordon:  hegemony = that the most effective kind of domination takes place when both the dominant and subjugated classes believe that the existing order, with perhaps some marginal changes, is satisfactory, or at least represents the most that anyone could expect, because things pretty much have to be the way they are.

## McCleskey v. Kemp (1987) {#slide-50}

                    % sentenced to death
  ----------------- ----------------------
  White  victim     11%
  Black victim      1%
  White defendant   7%
  Black defendant   4%

## McCleskey v. Kemp (1987) {#slide-51}

                    Black  victim   White victim
  ----------------- --------------- --------------
  Black defendant   1%              22%
  White defendant   3%              8%

## McCleskey v. Kemp (1987) {#slide-52}

After analyzing 230 variables, and holding constant the 39 leading nonracial variables:

Defendants charged with killing white victims are 4.3 times as likely to receive a death sentence as defendants charged with killing black victims. 

Worse in the mid-range of cases:  14.4% black victim versus 34.4% white victim 

## Charles Lawrence, "The Id, the Ego, and Equal Protection" (1987) {#slide-53}

Central intervention of Critical Race Theory: problems of race in this country are structural, deep, foundational, and cannot simply be fixed by individual correctives. Not just bad apples.   

 Charles Lawrence: problem of race is structural racism that is internalized, all over, not necessarily intentionally, but internalized through daily experiences. 

Cultural meaning test & implicit bias.
