  ----------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------
  1975/78 (Crime)   Yes (1) aggravating circumstance  must be averred in the indictment; (2) can't ask jury to return death sentence in non death eligible case           LIFE
  1980 US Beck      \[Tomlin  gets new trial because of preclusion clause; and state courts will have to address mandatory jury verdict from  Woodson v. North Carolina   LIFE
  1981 AL Beck      No, Tomlin can be sentenced to LWOP  or death because (1) it's §2 that needs to be averred; and (2) § 2(j) serves as aggravating circumstance.        Death or LWOP;  (LWOP because 12-0 LWOP  jury)
  1981  Kyzer       No, because §2(j) serves as aggravating circumstance                                                                                                  Death or LWOP;  (LWOP  jury)
