## Justification vs. Excuse	 {#slide-2}

Justification: e.g. self-defense; choice of evils

Quasi-excuse: e.g. duress

Excuse: e.g. insanity defense

MPC abandons sharp line

## Justification vs. Excuse	 {#slide-3}

Is it wrongdoing?

Legality and fair warning?

Who bears the burden of proof?

Does it extend to third parties?

## Issues in self-defense cases {#slide-4}

Subjective/objective belief standard

Imminence of harm

Necessity to protect from harm

Deadly force

Provocation

Duty to retreat -- right to stand your ground

Mistake re. deadly force

## NYPL 35.15 {#slide-17}

S 35.15 Justification; use of physical force in defense of a person.

  1.  A  person  may,  subject to the provisions of subdivision two, use

physical force upon another person when and to  the  extent  he  or  she

reasonably believes such to be necessary to defend himself, herself or a

third  person  from  what he or she reasonably believes to be the use or

imminent use of unlawful physical force by such other person, unless:

  (a) The latter\'s conduct was provoked by  the  actor  with  intent  to

cause physical injury to another person; or

  (b)  The actor was the initial aggressor; except that in such case the

use of physical force is  nevertheless  justifiable  if  the  actor  has

withdrawn   from   the   encounter  and  effectively  communicated  such

withdrawal to such other person but the latter  persists  in  continuing

the  incident by the use or threatened imminent use of unlawful physical

force; or

  (c) The physical  force  involved  is  the  product  of  a  combat  by

agreement not specifically authorized by law.

## NYPL 35.15 {#slide-18}

2. A person may not use deadly physical force upon another person under circumstances specified in subdivision one  unless : 

The actor reasonably believes that such other person is using or about to use deadly physical force. Even in such case, however, the actor may not use deadly physical force if he or she knows that with complete personal safety, to oneself and others he or she may avoid the necessity of so doing by retreating; except that the actor is under no duty to retreat if he or she is: (i) in his or her dwelling and not the initial aggressor; or (ii) a police officer or peace officer or a person assisting a police officer or a peace officer at the latter\'s direction, acting pursuant to section 35.30; or

He or she reasonably believes that such other person is committing or attempting to commit a kidnapping, forcible rape, forcible criminal sexual act or robbery; or 

He or she reasonably believes that such other person is committing or attempting to commit a burglary, and the circumstances are such that the use of deadly physical force is authorized by subdivision three of section 35.20. 

## Slide 19

New York Penal Law

S 160.00  Robbery; defined.

  Robbery is forcible stealing. A person forcibly steals property and

commits robbery when, in the course of committing a larceny, he uses or

threatens the immediate use of physical force upon another person for

the purpose of:

  1. Preventing or overcoming resistance to the taking of the property

or to the retention thereof immediately after the taking; or

  2. Compelling the owner of such property or another person to deliver

up the property or to engage in other conduct which aids in the

commission of the larceny.

## Aggravated Assault in Florida {#slide-50}

Section 784.021, Florida Statutes, Aggravated Assault consists of four factual elements:

1. The accused  intentionally and unlawfully threatened, by word or act, to do violence to the alleged victim ,

2. At the time the threat was made, the  accused appeared to have the ability to carry out the threat,

3. The accused's threat created in the mind of the alleged victim a well-founded fear that the violence was about to take place, and

4. The assault was made either  with a deadly weapon  or with a fully formed conscious intent to commit a felony.

Essentially, Aggravated Assault is an assault with an additional act consisting of the use of a deadly weapon or the intent to commit a felony.  Larkins v. State, 476 So. 2d 1383 (Fla. 1st DCA 1985).

## Aggravated Stalking {#slide-53}

784.048  Stalking; definitions; penalties. ---

(1) As used in this section, the term:(a) "Harass" means to engage in a course of conduct directed at a specific person which causes substantial emotional distress to that person and serves no legitimate purpose.

(2) A person who willfully, maliciously, and repeatedly follows, harasses, or cyberstalks another person commits the offense of stalking, a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s.  775.082  or s.  775.083 .

(3) A person who  willfully, maliciously, and repeatedly follows, harasses, or cyberstalks another person and makes a credible threat to that person commits the offense of aggravated stalking , a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s.  775.082 , s.  775.083 , or s.  775.084 .

## Great bodily injury {#slide-54}

There is no standard jury instruction defining great bodily harm. The judge instructed as follows: \"great bodily harm in the context of aggravated battery means great as distinguished from slight, trivial, minor or moderate harm \[and\] as such, does not include  mere bruises  as are likely to be inflicted in a simple assault and battery.\"  

## Provocation {#slide-55}

776.041:  No defense if  " initially provokes the use of force "  unless fear of imminent great bodily harm and exhausted reasonable means to escape such danger "

## Federal investigation under Holder {#slide-56}

"The Justice Department announced today that the independent federal investigation found insufficient evidence to pursue federal criminal civil rights charges against George Zimmerman for the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin on Feb. 26, 2012, in Sanford, Florida.\"

## Slide 62

Constitutional Constraints on Law Enforcement Use of force

(1)  Non-deadly

--  Graham v. Connor  (1989) (passenger going into insulin shock)

▪  Objective "reasonable police officer on the scene," under all the circumstances, including severity of the suspected crime, but  not  LEO subjective motive

(2)  Deadly

-- TN v. Garner  (1985) (fleeing burglary suspect shot in the head)

▪  PC suspect poses significant  threat  of death/serious physical harm / committed a  crime  involving infliction/threatened infliction thereof

▪  necessary to prevent escape

▪  warning if feasible

(3)  Car-ramming

\--  Scott v. Harris  (2007) (8-1) (where speeder was stopped by a rear bump at high-speed, refusing to categorize force as deadly or not, treating  Garner  as relatively fact-bound, and considering suspect culpability and incentives)

With me in the room is Andrea Yates, a white female, D.O.B. 7-2-64. Andrea, can you tell me your full and complete name? 

YATES:  Andrea Yates. 

MEHL:  And how old are you? 

YATES:  36. 

MEHL:  And what\'s your home address? 

YATES:  942 Beachcomber, Houston, Texas 77062. 

MEHL:  OK, and you and I have been talking for awhile, right? 

YATES:  Yes. 

MEHL:  You understood your rights?

MEHL:  OK, I\'m going to read them to you again for the purposes of this tape recording, OK? 

YATES:  OK.

## Slide 90

MEHL:  Um, how long have you been having thoughts about wanting, or not wanting to, but drowning your children? 

YATES:  Probably since I realized  I have not been a good mother to them. 

MEHL:  What makes you say that? 

YATES:   They weren\'t developing correctly . 

MEHL:  Behavioral problems? 

YATES:  Yes. 

MEHL:  Learning problems? 

YATES:  Yes. 

MEHL:  So after you drew the bath water, what happened? 

YATES:  I put Paul in. 

MEHL:  And how old is Paul? 

YATES:  Paul is 3. 

MEHL:  OK, and when you put Paul in the bath water, was he face down or face up? 

YATES:  He was face down. 

MEHL:  And he struggled with you? 

YATES:  Yes. 

MEHL:  How long do you think that struggle happened? 

YATES:  A couple of minutes. 

## Slide 91

MEHL:  OK, you had told me earlier that, that you\'d been having these thoughts about hurting your children for up to two years. Is that, is that about right? 

YATES:  Yes. 

MEHL:  OK, is there anything that happened two years ago that, that made you, that you believe led you to have these thoughts? 

YATES:   I realized that it was time to be punished . 

MEHL:  And what do you need to be punished for? 

YATES:   For not being a good mother . 

MEHL:  How did you see drowning your five children as a way to be punished?  Did you want the criminal justice system to punish you or did you . . . 

YATES:  Yes. 

MEHL:  OK, we were also talking earlier and there was one other time when you filled the tub with water and were going to do this and did not do it. Is that correct? 

YATES:  Yes. 

MEHL:  How long ago was that? 

YATES:  It was two months ago. 

MEHL:  OK, were all the children at home at that time? 

YATES:  Yes, Rusty was there too. 

MEHL:  Rusty was there too? Do you think Rusty would have stopped you? 

YATES:  Yes. 

MEHL:  So, you filled the tub with water that time. What is it within yourself that stopped you from, from doing it that time? 

YATES:  Just didn\'t do it that time.

After her arrest, jail psychiatrist Melissa Ferguson testified, Andrea was  put on medications  that enabled her to finally talk about the visions and voices that she says guided her actions. 

It was only after she was placed in a jail cell, naked, on suicide watch that Andrea spoke of  the Satan inside her  and the only was to be rid of him: 

She said she had to be executed. And she had to kill the children, as Satan demanded, to get the death penalty.

## Interview with Dr. Park Dietz (state expert) {#slide-94}

\"Before you did it,  did you think it was wrong?\" 

\"No.\" 

\"Why did you not think it wrong?\" 

\"If I didn\'t do it,  they would be tormented by Satan.  \... It was a bad choice. I shouldn\'t have done it\... There was distress, but I still felt I had to do it.\" 

\"As you drowned each one, did you think it was the right thing to be doing?\" 

Andrea nodded yes. 

Dietz asked, upon drowning the kids, if she thought about heaven. 

\"I was praying they would go there.\" 

She said she called the police because  she knew the murders would be perceived as bad, despite her higher purpose . Andrea also told Dietz, she believed she was psychotic when she thought the devil had guided her. \" He left when I committed my crime ,\"  she said. 

Dietz asked why Satan would leave her after she had obeyed him. 

\" He destroys and then leaves ,\" Andrea replied.

Texas Law

Sec. 8.01

(a) It is an affirmative defense to prosecution that,  at the time of the conduct charged, the actor, as a result of severe mental disease or defect, did not know that his conduct was wrong.

(b) The term \"mental disease or defect\" does not include an abnormality manifested only by repeated criminal or otherwise antisocial conduct.

## M ' Naghten Rule (1843): {#slide-97}

	(1) everyone is presumed to be sane; (2) to establish a defense on the ground of insanity it must be clearly proved that, at the time of the act, the defendant was laboring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to  know  the  nature and quality of the act  he was doing;  or , if he did know it, that he did not  know  he was doing what was  wrong .

						KSSB p.  969/1031

## Irresistible Impulse   {#slide-98}

	if the defendant is unable to adhere to the right as a result of irresistible impulse;  an inability to adhere to the right does not exist unless the act is committed under an irresistible impulse which completely deprives the defendant of the  power of choice or volition . 

						\[KSSB 974/1036\]

					

## The  Davis  Standard 1897  (p. 1034/972) {#slide-99}

The term "insanity" means such a perverted and deranged condition of the mental and moral faculties as to render a person  incapable  of distinguishing between right and wrong or....  his will ... has been otherwise than voluntarily so completely destroyed that his actions are not subject to it, but are  beyond his control .

## Durham Test   {#slide-100}

	The defendant' s conduct was the product of mental disease or mental defect.

## ALI Rule {#slide-101}

	 As a result of mental disease or defect, defendant lacks  substantial capacity  either to  appreciate  the criminality \[wrongfulness\] of his conduct or to  conform his conduct  to the requirements of law.

## Federal Insanity Defense, 18 USC 17 (1984): {#slide-104}

	It is an affirmative defense to a prosecution under any Federal statute that, at the time of the commission of the acts constituting the offense, the defendant, as a result of a severe mental disease or defect, was  unable to appreciate the nature and quality  or  the wrongfulness of his acts . Mental disease or defect does not otherwise constitute a defense.

						KSSB p. 981

## New York Penal Law Section 40.15 {#slide-105}

§ 40.15 Mental disease or defect. 

In any prosecution for an offense, it is an affirmative defense that when the defendant engaged in the proscribed conduct, he lacked criminal responsibility by reason of mental disease or defect. Such lack of criminal responsibility means that at the time of such conduct, as a result of mental disease or defect,  he lacked substantial capacity to know or appreciate either: 1. The nature and consequences of such conduct; or 2. That such conduct was wrong . 

## Slide 106

" The McNaughton rule, which was followed in New York before 1965, required that the defendant proffer evidence at trial to indicate that at the time he committed the act in question he did not \'\'know the nature and quality of the act he was doing\'\' or that he did not \'\'know that the act was wrong.\'\' The prosecutor then had the burden of disproving the insanity defense beyond a reasonable doubt.

The current insanity defense, as codified in Penal Law section 40.15, has expanded substantially on the McNaughton rule. Thus, unlike the \'\'total impairment for exculpation required under McNaughton\'\' (for this, see McKinney\'s Consolidated Laws of New York, William C.  Donnino , Practice Commentary to Penal Law 40.15), the statute requires the defendant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that at the time of his conduct \'\'he lacked substantial capacity to know or appreciate either (1) the nature and consequences of such conduct, or (2) that such conduct was wrong.\'\' Proof of either element will suffice for the defense.

These changes permit a defendant to prevail in the insanity defense by demonstrating that even if he \'\'knew\'\' what he had done, he nevertheless did not \'\'appreciate,\'\' that is, he did not have an understanding of the \'\'legal and moral import of the conduct involved.\'\' Accordingly, unlike the McNaughton standard,  the current statute distinguishes between surface knowledge of an event and the defendant\'s ability to comprehend and appreciate what it is that he has done . "

## Kahler v. Kansas , 589 U.S. \_\_ (2020) {#slide-107}

Under Kansas law, a jury cannot consider mental disease or defect as a defense to a crime except insofar as it shows "that the defendant lacked the mental state required as an element of the offense charged." In effect, this law makes irrelevant "whether the defendant is unable to know the nature and quality of his actions or know the difference between right and wrong with respect to his actions."

Question presented: May a state abolish the insanity defense without violating the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments?

Holding: Yes; due process does not require Kansas to adopt an insanity test that turns on a defendant's ability to recognize that his crime was morally wrong. 

Justice Elena Kagan was the swing vote with the conservative majority and authored the opinion for a 6-3 majority of the Court.

## Questionable effects? {#slide-108}

	NGI acquittals are rare and stayed rare even after  Hinkley . Studies show little evidence of effect from different formulations of insanity standard.

	See studies at KSS 982.

## Postpartum Depression and Psychosis {#slide-109}

The Andrea Yates Case

&

New Yorker  article 

## Slide 110

What is  " postpartum psychosis " ?

- Mania, depression; hallucinations, paranoia,  dellusions ; 4-6 weeks after childbirth.  See New Yorker  article

- Infanticide is most often associated with postpartum psychotic episodes that are characterized by command hallucinations to kill the infant or delusions the infant is possessed.

- Occurs in from 1 or 2 in 1,000 deliveries.  More common with multiple pregnancies.

- Once one episode has occurred, the risk of reoccurrence increases between 30-50%.

- PMAD occurs in 1 in 7 deliveries.  

## New Yorker  article {#slide-111}

"Both the legal and sociocultural responses to these cases tend to cleave to race and class lines. "A necessary though often insufficient condition for an insanity defense may well be that you are wealthy enough to have a documented mental-health record: you talked to doctors about it---you had the resources to seek treatment. This may be why most of the people who successfully exonerated themselves on grounds of postpartum psychosis have been white and affluent."
