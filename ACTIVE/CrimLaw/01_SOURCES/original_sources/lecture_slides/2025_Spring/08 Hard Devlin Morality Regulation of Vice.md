## The Place of Morality in the Criminal Law {#slide-1}

Bernard E. Harcourt 

Criminal Law

## John Stuart Mill,  On Liberty  (1859) {#slide-2}

"the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number is self-protection"

"the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others"

It is indispensable to not injure "the interests of one another, or rather certain interests which, either by express legal provision or by tacit understanding, ought to be considered as rights"

## Lord James  Fitzjames  Stephen,  Liberty, Equality, Fraternity  (1873) {#slide-3}

"There are acts of wickedness so gross and outrageous that, self-protection apart, they must be prevented as far as possible at any cost to the offender, and punished, if they occur, with exemplary severity."

## 20 th  Century "Regulation of Vice" Debates {#slide-4}

Committee on Homosexual Offences and Prostitution  (the "Wolfenden Report," 1957): recommends that private homosexual acts between consenting adults no longer be criminalized.

Supreme Court considers contraception ( Griswold , 1965)

MPC considers offenses of prostitution, sodomy, fornication, etc. (1960s)

Supreme Court considers First Amendment and "obscenity" ( Memoirs , 1966;  Miller , 1973)

## Lord Patrick Devlin, "Morals and the Criminal Law," in  The Enforcement of Morals  (1965) {#slide-5}

"the law exists for the protection of society. It does not discharge its function by protecting the individual from injury, annoyance, corruption, and exploitation; the law must protect also the institutions and the community of ideas, political and moral, without which people cannot live together. Society cannot ignore the morality of the individual any more than it can his loyalty; it flourishes on both and without either it dies."

"the law must base itself on Christian morals and to the limit of its ability enforce them, not simply because they are the morals of most of us, nor simply because they are the morals which are taught by the established Church-on these points the law recognizes the right to dissent but for the compelling reason that without the help of Christian teaching the law will fail."

"There must be toleration of the maximum individual freedom that is consistent with the integrity of society. Nothing should be punished by the law that does not lie beyond the limits of tolerance. It is not nearly enough to say that a majority dislike a practice; there must be a real feeling of reprobation."

## The Hart-Devlin Debate at philosophical level {#slide-6}

Hart/Mill: the  harm principle  in its simple formulation that "the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others"

Devlin/Stephen:  legal moralism  in its simple formulation that the criminal law is always based on moral principles and serves to uphold a moral order. 

## Hart-Devlin meets the U.S. Constitution:  Principles versus Rights {#slide-7}

Contraception ( Griswold , 1965)

Sodomy ( Bowers , 1986;  Lawrence , 2003)

Prostitution / commercial sex

Pornography / Obscenity ( Miller , 1973)

Gambling

Illicit Drugs & Alcohol

Same-sex marriage ( Windsor , 2013)

Abortion ( Roe , 1973;  Dobbs , 2021)

## Griswold v. Connecticut  (1965) {#slide-8}

"We deal with a  right of privacy older than the Bill of Rights."

"PENUMBRAS" of the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth Amendments

"zones of privacy"

"right of privacy" as "fundamental personal right"

## Bowers v. Hardwick  (1986) {#slide-9}

Question presented: "right of homosexuals to engage in sodomy"

NB: Georgia law applied to heterosexual sodomy as well. 

Holding #1: No "right of homosexuals to engage in sodomy," so no strict scrutiny

Holding #2: Survives rational basis review because:

"the law is constantly based on notions of morality"

"if all laws representing essentially moral choices are to be invalidated under the Due Process Clause, the courts will be very busy indeed."

Blackmun dissent: "right to be let alone"

## Lawrence v. Texas  (2003) {#slide-10}

Question presented: "liberty of the person"; "whether the petitioners were free as adults to engage in the private conduct in the exercise of their liberty under the Due Process Clause"

Intimate relations are a form of liberty protected by Due Process

"the fact that the governing majority in a State has traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice; neither history nor tradition could save a law prohibiting miscegenation from constitutional attack"

## Nietzsche,  The Gay Science  (1882) {#slide-11}

"It has caused me the greatest trouble, and forever causes me the greatest trouble, to perceive that  unspeakably more depends upon what things are called, than on what they are . The reputation, the name and appearance, the importance, the usual measure and weight of things \[...\] have gradually, by the belief therein and its continuous growth from generation to generation, grown as it were on-and-into things and become their very body \[...\] But let us not forget this:  it suffices to create new names and valuations and probabilities, in order in the long run to create new 'things.'"  (§ 58)

Originality.  What is originality? To see something that does not yet bear a name, that cannot yet be named, although it is before everybody's eyes. As people are usually constituted,  it is the name that first makes a thing generally visible to them . - Original persons have also for the most part been the  namers  of things. (§ 261)

## One take on  Lawrence,  morality, and  crim  law: {#slide-12}

"For the first time in the history of American criminal law, the United States Supreme Court has declared that a  supermajoritarian  moral belief does not necessarily provide a rational basis for criminalizing conventionally deviant conduct. The Court's ruling is the coup de grâce to legal moralism administered after a prolonged, brutish, tedious, and debilitating struggle against liberal legalism in its various criminal law representations. Henceforth---or at least until further notice---majoritarian morality no longer automatically trumps liberal argument (whether consequentialist or deontological) in defining the reasonable and  permissible contours of the penal code. ... With much pomp and circumstance the majority in  Lawrence  inters legal moralism and crowns liberal legalism. As a matter of federal due process, courts reviewing penal legislation must now deploy some other principle to distinguish between permissible and impermissible majoritarian moral opprobrium."

## Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization  (2022) {#slide-13}

Question presented: Is the "right to obtain an abortion" protected by the US Constitution?

Holding: Not protected

History of criminalization

Countervailing interest in life of fetus

Viability line makes no sense

NB: The "right to privacy" is "also not mentioned." Same for Casey "freedom to make "intimate and personal choices" that are "central to personal dignity and autonomy."
