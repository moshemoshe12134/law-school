MPC § 1.02(2)

(2) The general purposes of the provisions governing the sentencing and treatment of offenders are:

(a) to prevent the commission of offenses;
(b) to promote the correction and rehabilitation of offenders;
(c) to safeguard offenders against excessive, disproportionate or arbitrary punishment;
(d) to give fair warning of the nature of the sentences that may be imposed on conviction of an offense;
(e) to differentiate among offenders with a view to a just individualization in their treatment;
(f) to define, coordinate and harmonize the powers, duties and functions of the courts and of administrative officers and agencies responsible for dealing with offenders;
(g) to advance the use of generally accepted scientific methods and knowledge in the sentencing and treatment of offenders;
(h) to integrate responsibility for the administration of the correctional system in a State Department of Correction [or other single department or agency].

Nietzsche, *The Genealogy of Morals*

“The ‘purpose of law’ is absolutely the last thing to employ in the history of the origin of law: . . . whatever exists, having somehow come into being, is again and again reinterpreted to new ends, taken over, transformed, and redirected by some power superior to it”

“[P]urposes and utilities are only signs that a will to power has become master of something less powerful and imposed upon it the character of a function.”

The overseer, as it appears, some two or three days after the confession of the prisoner, made after having received a severe whipping, inquired of her why she continued to give him poison, when she had seen him so near dying from the effect of it. This inquiry assumed the fact of her guilt, from her previous confession, and did not even in form, propose the question of her guilt or innocence, but merely demanded a reason for her conduct. To hold that the reply of a slave to her overseer, under such circumstances, was testimony of the fact, thus impliedly asserted, because it could not be denied, would be exceedingly improper. The humane policy of our law, would exclude such evidence, coming from a white person, and the reason is much stronger for excluding it in the case of a slave.

The judgment of the court below must be reversed, but the prisoner will remain in custody for another indictment, or until discharged by due course of law.

repetition of the confessions legitimate proof, the greatest precaution should be used, so as to disabuse the mind of the prisoner, and he should be fully charged as to the effect of such confessions. Ordinarily, we *15 would not exclude confessions which are clearly shown to be voluntarily made before a magistrate, for the sole reason that the justice failed to caution the prisoner (20 Ala. 15); but where confessions have once been made by a slave to his master, under circumstances which will render them improper as evidence, the utmost precaution should be taken to advise him of their nature and effect, by the examining officer, and it must be clearly shown that he was free from the least apprehension of punishment from his master as a consequence of his recantation. Even then we should regard it unsafe to convict the prisoner upon such subsequent confessions, if wholly uncorroborated by other proof.-- Clarissa v. The State, supra.

It follows from what we have said, that the sentence of conviction must be reversed, and the cause remanded, that the prisoner may again be tried; and it is ordered that he be retained in custody to await such further trial.

239 Throughout the nineteenth century antebellum period, slaves charged with a capital offense in Alabama were afforded legal counsel at trial at their owner's expense. As early as 1807, a slave could not be condemned unless he or she was allowed "counsel in his or her defence, whose fee, amounting to ten dollars, shall be paid by the owner of the slave." Act of 1807 § 57, in H. Toulmin, A Digest of the Laws of the State of Alabama Containing the Statutes and Resolutions in Force at the End of the General Assembly in January, 1823 (1823), Courts Inferior, ch. 4 § 57, at 182 (hereinafter "Toulmin's Digest"). The slave's right to counsel at his owner's expense survived the adoption of the Alabama Constitution of 1819, although it was not incorporated therein. The criminal procedure laws enacted after the Constitution uniformly provided for appointed counsel at capital trials. See, e.g., Act of 1819 § 2, in Toulmin's Digest, Courts Inferior, supra, ch. 7 § 2, at 186. (right to counsel, "whose fee, amounting to ten dollars, shall be paid by the owner of the slave"); Act of 1824 § 4, in Aikin's Digest,

## ENACTMENTS BY EMPERORS

1. **ULPIAN, Institutes, book 1**: A decision given by the emperor has the force of a statute. This is because the populace commits to him and into him its own entire authority and power, doing this by the *lex regia* which is passed anent his authority. 1. Therefore, whatever the emperor has determined by a letter over his signature or has decreed on judicial investigation or has pronounced in an interlocutory matter or has prescribed by an edict is undoubtedly a law. These are what we commonly call *constitutions* (enactments). 2. Plainly, some of these are purely *ad hominem* and are not followed as setting precedents. For only the specific individual is covered by an indulgence granted by the emperor to someone according to his deserts or by a penalty specially imposed or by a benefit granted in an unprecedented way.

INVESTIGATIONS

1. **ULPIAN, Duties of Proconsul, book 8:** It is customary for torture to be applied to unearth crimes; but let us see when and how far this should be done. The deified Augustus laid down that one should not begin with the application of pain, and that reliance should not be placed entirely on torture, as is contained also in the deified Hadrian’s letter to Sennius Sabinus. 1. The words of the rescript are as follows: “Recourse should only be had to the infliction of pain on slaves when the criminal is [already] suspect, and is brought so close to being proved [guilty] by other evidence that the confession of his slaves appears to be the only thing lacking.” 2. The deified Hadrian wrote the same in a rescript to Claudius Quartinus; in which rescript he stated that a start should be made with the most suspect person and the man from whom the judge believes that he can most easily learn the truth. 3. It is declared in a rescript issued by the deified brothers to Lucius Tiberianus that persons produced by the accuser from his own household should not be summoned to the torture, nor should it readily be believed that she whom both her parents are said to have treated as their beloved daughter is a slave. 4. The same [emperors] sent a rescript to Cornelius Proculus that reliance should certainly not be placed on the torture of a single slave, but that the case should be examined by proofs. 5. The deified Antoninus and the deified Hadrian to Sennius Sabinus wrote in rescripts that when slaves were alleged along with their master to have sent gold and silver out of the country, they should not be questioned about the master in case they should of their own accord say something which would prejudice him. 6. The deified brothers wrote in a rescript to Lelianus Longinus that torture should not be applied to a slave belonging to an heir in matters to have sought the right of ownership over that [slave] by means of an imaginary municipality [may] be tortured in capital cases affecting the citizens because he is not corporate bodies; for the slave appears to belong, not to a number of individuals, but to

emperor and his deified father did not allow it. 19. Should slaves be tortured as par-
ticipants in a crime in their own right and confess something concerning their master
to the judge, the deified Trajan wrote in a rescript that [the judge] should pronounce
as the case requires. In this rescript, it is demonstrated that masters may be injured
by their slaves' confessions. But subsequent constitutions show a retreat from this
rescript. 20. In a case involving tribute, in which no one doubts that the sinews of
the state are concerned, the consideration of the risk, which threatens capital punish-
ment to a slave who is privy to a fraud, corroborates his declaration. 21. The person
who is going to conduct the torture should not ask specifically whether Lucius Titius
committed a homicide, but in general terms who did it; for the former seems rather
the action of someone suggesting [an answer] than seeking [the truth]. And so the
deified Trajan wrote in a rescript. 22. The deified Hadrian wrote a rescript to Cal-
purnius Celerianus in these words: "Agricola, the slave of Pompeius Valens, can be
interrogated concerning himself. If under torture he should say more than this, it is
taken as evidence against the accused, not as a fault in the interrogation." 23. It is
stated in constitutions that reliance should not always be placed on torture—but not
never, either; for it is a chancy and risky business and one which may be deceptive.
For there are a number of people who, by their endurance or their toughness under
torture, are so contemptuous of it that the truth can in no way be squeezed out of
any kind of lie than

# CHAPTER THE SECOND.

Of the Persons Capable of Committing Crimes.

Having, in the preceding chapter, considered in general the nature of crimes, and punishments, we are next led, in the order of our distribution, to enquire what persons are, or are not, capable of committing crimes; or, which is all one, who are exempted from the censures of the law upon the commission of those acts, which in other persons would be severely punished. In the process of which enquiry, we must have recourse to particular and special exceptions: for the general rule is, that no person shall be excused from punishment for disobedience to the laws of his country, excepting such as are expressly defined and exempted by the laws themselves.

# Ch. 2. WRONGS.

human actions either praiseworthy or culpable. Indeed, to make a complete crime, cognizable by human laws, there must be both a will and an act. For though, in foro conscientiae, a fixed design or will to do an unlawful act is almost as heinous as the commission of it, yet, as no temporal tribunal can search the heart, or fathom the intentions of the mind, otherwise than as they are demonstrated by outward actions, it therefore cannot punish for what it cannot know. For which reason in all temporal jurisdictions an overt act, or some open evidence of an intended crime, is necessary, in order to demonstrate the depravity of the will, before the man is liable to punishment. And, as a vitious will without a vitious act is no civil crime, so, on the other hand, an unwarrantable act without a vitious will is no crime at all. So that to constitute a crime against human laws, there must be, first, a vitious will; and, secondly, an unlawful act consequent upon such vitious will.

Now there are three cases, in which the will does not join with the act: 1. Where there is a defect of understanding. For where there is no discernment, there is no choice; and where there is no choice, there can be no act of the will, which is nothing else but a determination of one’s choice, to do or to abstain from a particular action: he therefore, that has no understanding, can have no will to guide his conduct. 2. Where there is understanding and will sufficient, residing in the party; but not called forth and exerted at the time of the action done: which is the case of all offences committed by chance or ignorance. Here the will fits neuter; and neither concurs with the
