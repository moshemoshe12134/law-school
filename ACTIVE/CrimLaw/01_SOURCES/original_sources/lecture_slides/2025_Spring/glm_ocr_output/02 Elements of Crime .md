# PUBLIC BOOK IV.

## THE SECOND.

## CAPABLE OF COMMITTING MES.

In the chapter, considered in general and punishments, we are next led, to enquire what persons are, crimes; or, which is all one,asures of the law upon the com-other persons would be severely which enquiry, we must have special exceptions: for the general excused from punishment for country, excepting such as are by the laws themselves.

# Ch. 2. WRONGS.

human actions either praiseworthy or culpable. Indeed, to make a complete crime, cognizable by human laws, there must be both a will and an act. For though, in foro confcientiae, a fixed design or will to do an unlawful act is almost as heinous as the commission of it, yet, as no temporal tribunal can search the heart, or fathom the intentions of the mind, otherwise than as they are demonstrated by outward actions, it therefore cannot punish for what it cannot know. For which reason in all temporal jurisdictions an overt act, or some open evidence of an intended crime, is necessary, in order to demonstrate the depravity of the will, before the man is liable to punishment. And, as a vitious will without a vitious act is no civil crime, so, on the other hand, an unwarrantable act without a vitious will is no crime at all. So that to constitute a crime against human laws, there must be, first, a vitious will; and, secondly, an unlawful act consequent upon such vitious will.

Now there are three cases, in which the will does not join with the act: 1. Where there is a defect of understanding. For where there is no discernment, there is no choice; and where there is no choice, there can be no act of the will, which is nothing else but a determination of one's choice, to do or to abstain from a particular action: he therefore, that has no understanding, can have no will to guide his conduct. 2. Where there is understanding and will sufficient, residing in the party; but not called forth and exerted at the time of the action done: which is the case of all offences committed by chance or ignorance. Here the will sits neuter; and neither concurs with the

“In all temporal jurisdictions an *overt* act or some open evidence of an intended crime is necessary, in order to demonstrate the depravity of the will, before the man is liable to punishment. And as a vicious will without a vicious act is no crime, so an unwarrantable act without a vicious will is no crime.”

HAVING, in the preceding chapter, considered in general the nature of crimes, and punishments, we are next led, in the order of our distribution, to enquire what persons are, or are not, capable of committing crimes; or, which is all one, who are exempted from the censures of the law upon the commission of those acts, which in other persons would be severely punished. In the process of which enquiry, we must have recourse to particular and special exceptions: for the general rule is, that no person shall be excused from punishment for disobedience to the laws of his country, excepting such as are expressly defined and exempted by the laws themselves.

ALL the several pleas and excuses, which protect the committer of a forbidden act from the punishment which is otherwise annexed thereto, may be reduced to this single consideration, the want or defect of will. An involuntary act, as it has no claim to merit, so neither can it induce any guilt: the concurrence of the will, when it has it’s choice either to do or to avoid the fact in question, being the only thing that renders human

- Act is “bodily movement” MPC 1.13(2)
- MPC 1.13(9) defines elements of offense
  - Key concepts = “conduct” or result or attendant circumstances.
- MPC 2.01(1): if conduct, must include either:
  - Conduct which involves a voluntary act
  - Omission to perform an act where there is a duty
- Voluntary act: defined by negatives 2.01(2)

# Kelman, Interpretive Constructs

## 4 unconscious constructs:
- broad and narrow time frames
  example: status crimes (600)
- disjoined and unified accounts
  example: involuntary acts (603; 618)
- broad and narrow views of intent
  example: intent to kill vs. intent to pull the trigger
- broad and narrow views of the defendant
  example: reasonable person (634)

## 2 conscious constructs:
- free will vs. determinism
  e.g. insanity defense as determinist (648)
  e.g. provocation (645)
- rules vs. standards
  e.g. 660 *Papachristou* case

To what end?

1. p. 669: Just be realist and do better policy work.
2. p. 670: Interpret correlations (law is politics)
3. p. 671: Just non-rational filters.

# Anchoring Example

Real estate agents
All inspected house
Given 10-page information pack: features, footage, prices of other houses in area, …

Given asking price = $119,900
Predicted

Appraisal value = $114,204
Listing price = $117,745
Purchase price = $111,454
Lowest acceptable offer = $111,136

Given asking price = $149,900
Predicted

Appraisal value = $128,754
Listing price = $130,981
Purchase price = $127,318
Lowest acceptable offer = $123,818

Changed asking prices swayed valuations 11-14%
Effects of asking price remarkably large,
given that so much other information on the house was given.

CHAPTER THE SECOND.

OF THE PERSONS CAPABLE OF COMMITTING CRIMES.

HAVING, in the preceding chapter, considered in general the nature of crimes, and punishments, we are next led, in the order of our distribution, to enquire what persons are, or are not, capable of committing crimes; or, which is all one, who are exempted from the censures of the law upon the commission of those acts, which in other persons would be severely punished. In the process of which enquiry, we must have recourse to particular and special exceptions: for the general rule is, that no person shall be excused from punishment for disobedience to the laws of his country, excepting such as are expressly defined and exempted by the laws themselves.

ALL the several pleas and excuses, which protect the committer of a forbidden act from the punishment which is otherwise annexed thereto, may be reduced to this single consideration, the want or defect of will. An involuntary act, as it has no claim to merit, so neither can it induce any guilt: the concurrence of the will, when it has it’s choice either to do or to avoid the fact in question, being the only thing that renders human actions either praiseworthy or culpable. Indeed, to make a complete crime, cognizable by human laws, there must be both a will and an act. For though, in foro conscientiae, a fixed design or will to do an unlawful act is almost as heinous as the commission of it, yet, as no temporal tribunal can search the heart, or fathom the intentions of the mind, otherwise than as they are demonstrated by outward actions, it therefore cannot punish for what it cannot know. For which reason in all temporal jurisdictions an overt act, or some open evidence of an intended crime, is necessary, in order to demonstrate the depravity of the will, before the man is liable to punishment. And, as a vitious will without a vitious act is no civil crime, so, on the other hand, an unwarrantable act without a vitious will is no crime at all. So that to constitute a crime against human laws, there must be, first, a vitious will; and, secondly, an unlawful act consequent upon such vitious will.

Now there are three cases, in which the will does not join with the act: 1. Where there is a defect of understanding. For where there is no discernment, there is no choice; and where there is no choice, there can be no act of the will, which is nothing else but a determination of one’s choice, to do or to abstain from a particular action: he therefore, that has no understanding, can have no will to guide his conduct. 2. Where there is understanding and will sufficient, residing in the party; but not called forth and exerted at the time of the action done: which is the case of all offences committed by chance or ignorance. Here the will fits neuter; and neither concurs with the act, nor disagrees to it. 3. Where the action is constrained by some outward force and violence. Here the will counteracts the deed; and is so far from concurring with, that it loaths and disagrees to, what the man is obliged to perform. It will be the business of the present chapter briefly to consider all the several species of defect in will, as they fall under some one or other of these general heads: as infancy, idiocy, lunacy, and intoxication, which fall under the first class; misfortune, and ignorance.

AT COMMON LAW, THERE WERE 4 MENTAL STATES:

1. Specific intent crimes: think “intentional”
   a. Intentional murder
   b. Assault
   c. Robbery
   d. Burglary

2. Malice crimes: think “extremely reckless”
   a. Murder
   b. Arson

3. General intent crimes: think “generally aware its illegal”
   a. Battery

4. Strict Liability crimes: no mens rea required. Administrative.
