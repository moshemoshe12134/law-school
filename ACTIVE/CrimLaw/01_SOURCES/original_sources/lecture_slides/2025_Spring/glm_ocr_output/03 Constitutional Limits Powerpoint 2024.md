someone to living in a five by
eight cell for eight to ten years
waiting for their execution. And
so that gives some context to the
concept of inhuman and degrading
treatment under International
Customary Law, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Yeah, Son, see if you can
narrate that International Law
for me while I go catch this
telephone -- I said narrate, I
meant condense.

(Resumed, all parties
present.)
(Defendant present.)

THE COURT: Go ahead.

MR. VALESKA: I understand, Judge.

MR. HARCOURT: Can I just clarify on the double jeopardy motion, is that on all grounds that you rejected that, Your Honor?

THE COURT: Yes, each and every one of them.

MR. HARCOURT: Okay. And I realize -- I would like to make a proffer of evidence on the International Law question and I’m not sure you --

MR. VALESKA: I object.

THE COURT: I don’t want to hear that. Young man, I haven’t read these cases. But one involved a German, one involved somebody of Latin descent. Mr. Tomlin is not a German and if he is it’s his ancestors. He’s not somebody of Latin descent. He hadn’t been extradited from any foreign country. And this International Law Argument makes absolutely no sense whatsoever to me and everything I say is in the record. Okay.

Now, y’all go back and look at any pretrial publicity in
