Channel your outrage: Demand the Death Penalty

The wolf pack attack in Central Park has provoked an extraordinary sense of outrage on the part of decent people throughout the city. The incited demons grieved the collective consciousness of New York in a unique way. Indeed, few crimes in recent memory have generated arousal and produced a reaction.

The people of New York are no longer willing to be seduced by the claim that society is somehow responsible for the behavior of the marauding thugs who terrorize the city. New Yorkers are interested in swift and sure punishment, and in a groping, pointless search for “root causes.”

## Slide 11

BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY.

BRING BACK OUR POLICE!

What has happened to our City over the past ten years? What has happened to law and order, to the neighborhood cop we all trusted to safeguard our homes and families, the cop who had the power under the law to help us in times of danger, keep us safe from those who would prey on innocent lives to fulfill some distorted inner needs. What has happened to the respect for authority, the fear of retribution by the courts, society and the police for those who break the law, who wavily trespass on the right, of others? What has happened is the complete breakdown of life as we knew it.

Mary New York families — White, Black, Hispanic and Asian — have had to give up the pleasure of a leisurely stroll in the Park at dusk, the Saturday, with the playground with their families, the bike ride at dawn, or just sitting on their stoops — given them up as hostages to a world ruled by the law of the streets, as roving bands of wild criminals roam our neighborhoods, dispensing their own vicious brand of poised haunt our neighborhood. At what point did we cross the line from the fine and noble pursuit of genuine civil liberties to the reckless and dangerous permeate atmosphere which allows criminals of every age to heat and rape a helpless woman and then laugh at her family's anguish! And why do they laugh? They laugh because they know that soon, very soon, they will be returned to the streets to rape and maim and kill once again — and we face great personal risk to themselves.

Mary Koch has stated that hate and rancor should be removed from our hearts. I do not think so. I want to have three muggers and murderers. They should be forced to suffer and, when they kill, they should be executed for their crimes. They must serve as examples so that others will think long and hard before committing a crime or an act of violence.

Yes, Mary Koch, I want to hate these murderers and I always will. I am not looking to psychanalyze or understand them. I am looking to punish them. If the punishment is strong, the attacks on innocent people will stop. I recently witnessed a memorial trying to explain the "anger in these young men". I am longer want to understand their anger. I mean them to understand our anger. I want them to be afraid.

How can our great society tolerate the continued brutalization of the citizens by craved misfits? Criminals must be told that their CIVIL LIBERTIES END WHEN AN ATTACK ON OUR LAWYER BEGINS!

When I was young, I sat in a dinner with my father and witnessed two young bullies cursing and threatening a very frightened solider. Two cop rushed in, lifted up the thugs and threw them out the door, warning them never to cause trouble again. I miss the feeling of security. New York fires once gave to the citizens of this City.

Let our politicians give back our police department's power to keep us safe. And backble them from the constant chant of "police brutality" which every petty criminal hurts immediately at an officer who has just taken his or her life to save another's. We must cease our continuous pandering to the criminal population of this City. Give New York back to the citizens who have escaped the right to be New Yorkers. Send a message loud and clear to those who would murder our citizens and terrorize New York — BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY AND BRING BACK OUR POLICE!

NYPL 35.15

S 35.15 Justification; use of physical force in defense of a person.

1. A person may, subject to the provisions of subdivision two, use physical force upon another person when and to the extent he or she reasonably believes such to be necessary to defend himself, herself or a third person from what he or she reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of unlawful physical force by such other person, unless:

(a) The latter's conduct was provoked by the actor with intent to cause physical injury to another person; or

(b) The actor was the initial aggressor; except that in such case the use of physical force is nevertheless justifiable if the actor has withdrawn from the encounter and effectively communicated such withdrawal to such other person but the latter persists in continuing the incident by the use or threatened imminent use of unlawful physical force; or

(c) The physical force involved is the product of a combat by agreement not specifically authorized by law.

## Slide 18

NYPL 35.15

2. A person may not use deadly physical force upon another person under circumstances specified in subdivision one unless:

(a) The actor reasonably believes that such other person is using or about to use deadly physical force. Even in such case, however, the actor may not use deadly physical force if he or she knows that with complete personal safety, to oneself and others he or she may avoid the necessity of so doing by retreating; except that the actor is under no duty to retreat if he or she is: (i) in his or her dwelling and not the initial aggressor; or (ii) a police officer or peace officer or a person assisting a police officer or a peace officer at the latter's direction, acting pursuant to section 35.30; or

(b) He or she reasonably believes that such other person is committing or attempting to commit a kidnapping, forcible rape, forcible criminal sexual act or robbery; or

(c) He or she reasonably believes that such other person is committing or attempting to commit a burglary, and the circumstances are such that the use of deadly physical force is authorized by subdivision three of section 35.20.

# Daniel Penny’s prosecution was ‘BS’ and a ‘political trial,’ original NYC subway vigilante Bernie Goetz says

By Kathianne Boniello
Published Jan. 4, 2025, 9:22 a.m. ET

195 Comments

Daniel Penny’s prosecution was “political,” according to infamous subway vigilante Bernie Goetz.

REUTERS

The original subway vigilante, Bernie Goetz, thinks the prosecution of Daniel Penny for the chokehold death of Jordan Neely aboard a train was “BS.”

Goetz, 77, spoke to WABC’s Frank Morano Dec. 10 about the Penny case, nearly 40 years to the day after he shot a foursome of thugs who tried to rob him on a Manhattan train.

“This is about New York, and New York I consider a BS society, and what the Penny case has in common with my case is, it’s all BS,” he told the host of the show, “The Other Side of Midnight.”

Goetz said the chaos of today’s subways doesn’t compare to riding the rails in the 1980s.

“There was much more violence in the 80s,” he said. “It was a poorer society. We had a much greater percentage of the population preying on the rest of the population.”

His own case “basically shed light on the high crime in New York and that New York City was failing as a city, and also the government here was simply not addressing crime at the time,” he said.

Goetz said his prosecution was sparked by then-governor Mario Cuomo’s presidential aspirations.

“Mario Cuomo himself was saying New York had successful policies to raise people up from poverty, and in fact New York was failing and I went around saying on national TV that New York government was incompetent and corrupt.”

Trump sparks outcry with implication that DEI policies are at fault in D.C. midair collision
“We have to have our smartest people” as air traffic controllers. Trump said.

At his first news conference since the aircraft collision over the Potomac River, President Donald Trump implied Thursday that diversity, equity and inclusion programs could be the cause, although an investigation into the fatal disaster has only just begun.

“We have to have our smartest people” as air traffic controllers, Trump said Thursday morning. “It doesn’t matter what they look like, how they speak, who they are. … They have to be talented, naturally talented. Geniuses. Can’t have regular people doing their job. We can’t have regular people doing this job. They won’t be able to do it, but we’ll restore faith in American air travel.”

Trump spent a considerable amount of time discussing the Federal Aviation Administration's DEI initiatives, particularly under Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama. He cited the FAA's acknowledgment of the underemployment of employees with disabilities.

A week before he took office, Trump said that the FAA website said "people with severe disabilities are the most underrepresented segment of the workforce, that they want them" to be "air traffic controllers. I don’t think so."

The White House just issued a press release on MS-13. It calls them 'animals' 8 times.

Newsletter sign up

The press release issued Monday is titled "What you need to know about the violent animals of MS-13." The release uses eight different statements like, "In Maryland, MS-13's animals are accused of stabbing a man more than 100 times and then decapitating him, dismembering him, and ripping his heart out of his body," and "MS-13's animals reportedly saw murder as a way to boost their standing in the gang." The statement ends by vowing that "President Trump's entire administration is working tirelessly to bring these violent animals to justice."

# Aggravated Assault in Florida

Section 784.021, Florida Statutes, Aggravated Assault consists of four factual elements:

1. The accused intentionally and unlawfully threatened, by word or act, to do violence to the alleged victim,
2. At the time the threat was made, the accused appeared to have the ability to carry out the threat,
3. The accused’s threat created in the mind of the alleged victim a well-founded fear that the violence was about to take place, and
4. The assault was made either with a deadly weapon or with a fully formed conscious intent to commit a felony.

Essentially, Aggravated Assault is an assault with an additional act consisting of the use of a deadly weapon or the intent to commit a felony. Larkins v. State, 476 So. 2d 1383 (Fla. 1st DCA 1985).

Attorney General James' Special Investigations And Prosecutions Unit Releases Report On Investigation Into The Death Of Saheed Vassell

New York -- Today, Attorney General Letitia James’ Special Investigations and Prosecutions Unit (SIPU) released its report into the death of Saheed Vassell. Over the course of the investigation, SIPU found that the officers’ actions were legally justified, and that there was no adequate evidence to warrant criminal prosecution against the officers involved. In order to prevent another tragedy, and to promote the public’s confidence in how local law enforcement responds to such occurrences, the Office of the Attorney General outlined the following recommendations:

1. 911 operators and police dispatchers should receive comprehensive critical incident training.
2. The NYPD should review and reform its public information policies and practices regarding which facts it should release to the public in police-involved uses of force.

Attorney General James released the following statement:

“The death of Saheed Vassell was a tragedy, and I extend my deepest condolences to his family and loved ones. The Special Investigations and Prosecutions Unit is committed to providing thorough and transparent investigations. We urge the New York Police Department to implement our recommendations.”

With me in the room is Andrea Yates, a white female, D.O.B. 7-2-64. Andrea, can you tell me your full and complete name?
YATES: Andrea Yates.
MEHL: And how old are you?
YATES: 36.
MEHL: And what's your home address?
YATES: 942 Beachcomber, Houston, Texas 77062.
MEHL: OK, and you and I have been talking for awhile, right?
YATES: Yes.
MEHL: You understood your rights?

MEHL: OK, I'm going to read them to you again for the purposes of this tape recording, OK?
YATES: OK.

..... [reads rights]

## Slide 90

MEHL: Um, how long have you been having thoughts about wanting, or not wanting to, but drowning your children?
YATES: Probably since I realized I have not been a good mother to them.
MEHL: What makes you say that?
YATES: They weren't developing correctly.
MEHL: Behavioral problems?
YATES: Yes.
MEHL: Learning problems?
YATES: Yes.
MEHL: So after you drew the bath water, what happened?
YATES: I put Paul in.
MEHL: And how old is Paul?
YATES: Paul is 3.

YATES: He was face down.
MEHL: And he struggled with you?
YATES: Yes.
MEHL: How long do you think that struggle happened?
YATES: A couple of minutes.

## Slide 91

# MEHL: OK, you had told me earlier that, that you'd been having these thoughts about hurting your children for up to two years. Is that, is that about right?

**YATES:** Yes.

**MEHL:** OK, is there anything that happened two years ago that, that made you, that you believe led you to have these thoughts?

**YATES:** I realized that it was time to be punished.

**MEHL:** And what do you need to be punished for?

**YATES:** For not being a good mother.

**MEHL:** How did you see drowning your five children as a way to be punished? Did you want the criminal justice system to punish you or did you . . .

**YATES:** Yes.

**MEHL:** OK, we were also talking earlier and there was one other time when you filled the tub with water and were going to do this and did not do it. Is that correct?

**YATES:** Yes.

**MEHL:** How long ago was that?

**YATES:** It was two months ago.

**MEHL:** OK, were all the children at home at that time?

**YATES:** Yes, Rusty was there too.

**MEHL:** Rusty was there too? Do you think Rusty would have stopped you?

**YATES:** Yes.

**MEHL:** So, you filled the tub with water that time. What is it within yourself that stopped you from, from doing it that time?

**YATES:** Just didn't do it that time.

She said she had to be executed. And she had to kill the children, as Satan demanded, to get the death penalty.

• "As you drowned each one, did you think it was the right thing to be doing?"
• Andrea nodded yes.
• Dietz asked, upon drowning the kids, if she thought about heaven.
• "I was praying they would go there."
• She said she called the police because she knew the murders would be perceived as bad, despite her higher purpose. Andrea also told Dietz, she believed she was psychotic when she thought the devil had guided her. "He left when I committed my crime," she said.
• Dietz asked why Satan would leave her after she had obeyed him.

(a) It is an affirmative defense to prosecution that, at the time of the conduct charged, the actor, as a result of severe mental disease or defect, did not know that his conduct was wrong.

## Slide 97

M’Naghten Rule (1843):

(1) everyone is presumed to be sane; (2) to establish a defense on the ground of insanity it must be clearly proved that, at the time of the act, the defendant was laboring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong.

Federal Insanity Defense, 18 USC 17 (1984):

It is an affirmative defense to a prosecution under any Federal statute that, at the time of the commission of the acts constituting the offense, the defendant, as a result of a severe mental disease or defect, was unable to appreciate the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of his acts. Mental disease or defect does not otherwise constitute a defense.

KSSB p. 981

---

## Slide 105

New York Penal Law Section 40.15

§ 40.15 Mental disease or defect.

In any prosecution for an offense, it is an affirmative defense that when the defendant engaged in the proscribed conduct, he lacked criminal responsibility by reason of mental disease or defect. Such lack of criminal responsibility means that at the time of such conduct, as a result of mental disease or defect, he lacked substantial capacity to know or appreciate either: 1. The nature and consequences of such conduct; or 2. That such conduct was wrong.

---

## Slide 106

"The McNaughton rule, which was followed in New York before 1965, required that the defendant proffer evidence at trial to indicate that at the time he committed the act in question he did not "know the nature and quality of the act he was doing" or that he did not "know that the act was wrong." The prosecutor then had the burden of disproving the insanity defense beyond a reasonable doubt.

The current insanity defense, as codified in Penal Law section 40.15, has expanded substantially on the McNaughton rule. Thus, unlike the "total impairment for exculpation required under McNaughton" (for this, see McKinney's Consolidated Laws of New York, William C. Donnino, Practice Commentary to Penal Law 40.15), the statute requires the defendant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that at the time of his conduct "he lacked substantial capacity to know or appreciate either (1) the nature and consequences of such conduct, or (2) that such conduct was wrong." Proof of either element will suffice for the defense.

These changes permit a defendant to prevail in the insanity defense by demonstrating that even if he "knew" what he had done, he nevertheless did not "appreciate," that is, he did not have an understanding of the "legal and moral import of the conduct involved." Accordingly, unlike the McNaughton standard, the current statute distinguishes between surface knowledge of an event and the defendant's ability to comprehend and appreciate what it is that he has done."

## Slide 107

Kahler v. Kansas, 589 U.S. ___ (2020)

• Under Kansas law, a jury cannot consider mental disease or defect as a defense to a crime except insofar as it shows “that the defendant lacked the mental state required as an element of the offense charged.” In effect, this law makes irrelevant “whether the defendant is unable to know the nature and quality of his actions or know the difference between right and wrong with respect to his actions.”

• Question presented: May a state abolish the insanity defense without violating the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments?

• Holding: Yes; due process does not require Kansas to adopt an insanity test that turns on a defendant’s ability to recognize that his crime was morally wrong.

• Justice Elena Kagan was the swing vote with the conservative majority and authored the opinion for a 6-3 majority of the Court.

What is “postpartum psychosis”?
- Mania, depression; hallucinations, paranoia, dellusions; 4-6 weeks after childbirth. See New Yorker article
- Infanticide is most often associated with postpartum psychotic episodes that are characterized by command hallucinations to kill the infant or delusions the infant is possessed.
- Occurs in from 1 or 2 in 1,000 deliveries. More common with multiple pregnancies.
- Once one episode has occurred, the risk of reoccurrence increases between 30-50%.
- PMAD occurs in 1 in 7 deliveries.

## Slide 111

New Yorker article

“Both the legal and sociocultural responses to these cases tend to cleave to race and class lines. “A necessary though often insufficient condition for an insanity defense may well be that you are wealthy enough to have a documented mental-health record: you talked to doctors about it—you had the resources to seek treatment. This may be why most of the people who successfully exonerated themselves on grounds of postpartum psychosis have been white and affluent.”
