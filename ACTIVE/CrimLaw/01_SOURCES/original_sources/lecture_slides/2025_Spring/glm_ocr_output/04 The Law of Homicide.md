# Manner of Death

Manner of Death is the way to categorize death as required by the Washington State Department of Health. The classifications are natural, accident, suicide, homicide, undetermined, and pending. Only medical examiner’s and coroners may use all of the manners of death. Other certifiers must use natural or refer the death to the medical examiner. The manner of death is determined by the medical examiner.

- **Natural Deaths**

Natural is defined as death caused solely by disease or natural process. If natural death is hastened by injury (such as a fall or drowning in a bathtub), the manner of death is not considered natural.

Sudden Unexplained Infant Death (SUID), formerly known as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), is a subset of natural death. It is the sudden death of an infant under one year of age which remains unexplained after a thorough and complete investigation. The investigation includes a complete autopsy, examination of the death scene, and clinical history. If significant risk factors were present, such as an unsafe sleep environment, including co-sleeping or inappropriate bedding, then the cause of death would fall out of the definition of SUID and the manner would be classified as "undetermined."

- **Accidental Deaths**

Accident is defined for medical examiner death certification purposes as an unnatural death resulting from an inadvertent chance happening. Traffic related fatalities (involving vehicles used for transportation on any public roadway) are classified as accidents. On the job injury related deaths are referred to as industrial deaths and are classified as accidents. Deaths related to illicit drug or excessive medication use, in the absence of specifically supporting the conclusion of the manner of death being homicide or suicide, are classified as accident.

Traffic Deaths are a subset of accidental deaths, but deaths resulting from traffic accidents are reported separately from other accidental deaths for statistical purposes. A traffic death is defined as an unintentional death of a driver, passenger, or pedestrian involving a motor vehicle on public roadways. Accidents involving motor vehicles on private property (such as driveways) are not included in this category and are classified non-traffic vehicular deaths. Classification of traffic related deaths as an "accident" does not preclude the prosecution as a vehicular homicide by legal authorities.

Complication of Therapy Deaths are accidental deaths that occur during or due to complications that occur during medical, surgical, therapeutic, or diagnostic procedures.

- **Suicide**

Suicide is defined for medical examiner death certification purposes as a death from self-inflicted injury with evidence of intent to die. Evidence of intent includes an explicit expression, such as a suicide note or verbal threat, previous attempts, or an act constituting implicit intent. An example would be a self-inflicted contact/close range gunshot wound (particularly of the head, chest, or abdomen) that is recognized as having very high potential for lethality, and is considered to be implicit evidence of intent to die.

- **Homicide**

Homicide is defined as the action of one person directly causing the death of another. A death that occurs during and is related to the commission of a felony is also considered homicide. A violent death may stem from some kind of deliberate or purposeful action, but intent to cause death need not be present or proven for the classification as homicide.

Homicide and murder are not the same. All murders are homicides, not all homicides are murder. "Murder" is not an acceptable manner of death classification for death certification purposes. "Murder" is a term used under specific conditions in criminal law matters as as a general concept. An example might be that of unintentional firearms-related hunting death. While it may be classified as a homicide, it is up to legal authorities to determine when to prosecute such a case as "murder," "manslaughter," etc.

- **Undetermined**

Undetermined is listed as the manner of death classification in only a small number of cases each year. Undetermined is an appropriate designation for cases that have very little available information about the circumstances surrounding the death (e.g., partial skeletal remains) or where known information equally supports, conflicts with, more than one manner of death. An undetermined manner of death is assigned to cases of unnatural death when a clear preponderance of evidence supporting a specific manner (homicide, accident, or suicide) is not available.

Some unexpected infant deaths that are not classified as "natural" (SIDS), such as when an unsafe sleeping environment is present, may be classified as "undetermined" in manner.

- **Pending**

Pending may be listed temporarily on the death certificate for cause and/or manner when additional investigation, information and/or test results are required for certification. These classifications are generally amended as soon as additional information becomes available.

## Slide 5

abolished by statute 14 Edw. III. c. 4. we must now (as is observed by Staundforde) define murder in quite another manner, without regarding whether the party slain was killed openly or secretly, or whether he was of English or foreign extraction.

MURDER is therefore now thus defined, or rather described, by Sir Edward Coke; "when a person, of sound memory and discretion, unlawfully killeth any reasonable creature in being and under the king's peace, with malice aforethought, either express or implied." The best way of examining the nature of this crime will be by considering the several branches of this definition.

FIRST, it must be committed by a person of sound memory and discretion: for a lunatic or infant, as was formerly observed, are incapable of committing any crime; unless in such cases where

Blackstone, Commentaries Vol. 4, Chapter 14, p. 195

- Murder is, therefore, now thus defined or rather described by Sir Edward Coke: “when a person of sound memory and discretion unlawfully killeth any reasonable creature in being, and under the king’s peace, with malice aforethought, either express or implied.”
- Murder distinguished from manslaughter.

## Slide 7

Common Law of Murder

Murder is homicide “with malice aforethought”:

* premeditated -- had formed a plan ahead of time
* intent to cause death
* intent to inflict serious bodily harm
* extreme recklessness & indifference to life
* felony-murder: during the course of a felony

---

## Slide 8

Blackstone, Commentaries Vol. 4, Chapter 14, p. 191

- Manslaughter is therefore thus defined: the unlawful killing of another without malice, either express or implied; which may be either voluntarily, upon a sudden heat, or involuntarily, but in the commission of some unlawful act.
- Or “where a person does an act lawful in itself, but in an unlawful manner, and without due caution and circumspection”

---

## Slide 9

Common Law of Manslaughter

Manslaughter is homicide **without** malice:

(1) **voluntary:**
* “sudden heat” (p. 191)
* imperfect self defense (p. 183)

(2) **involuntary:**
* “unlawful manner and without due caution and circumspection” (p. 192)

In WV, the legality of carrying a knife will depend on the type of knife and how it is in his pocket (concealed inside the pocket or clipped against the pocket visibly):

§61-7-3. Carrying deadly weapon without license or other authorization; penalties.

(a) Any person who carries a **concealed** deadly weapon, without a state license or other lawful authorization established under the provisions of this code, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not less than one hundred dollars nor more than one thousand dollars and may be imprisoned in the county jail for not more than twelve months for the first offense; but upon conviction of a second or subsequent offense, he or she shall be guilty of a felony, and, upon conviction thereof, shall be imprisoned in the penitentiary not less than one nor more than five years and fined not less than one thousand dollars nor more than five thousand dollars.

In New York, however, carrying most knives in public is a misdemeanor as they are considered per se "weapons" or "weapons" with intent to use unlawfully when the defendant makes statements about what the knives are for (i.e. "I carry a knife for protection") under NYS PL §265.01. New York City has additional laws prohibition carrying most knives in public or in the subway with administrative law §10-133 and MTA transit law §1050.8.

• “such a passion as would naturally be aroused in the mind of an ordinarily reasonable person under the given facts and circumstances”

• “so disturbed or obscured by some passion to such an extent as would render ordinary men of average disposition liable to act rashly or without due deliberation and reflection, and from his passion rather than from judgment.”

PETIT treason, according to the statute 25 Edw.III. c.2. may happen three ways: by a servant killing his master, a wife her husband, or an ecclesiastical person (either secular, or regular) his superior, to whom he owes faith and obedience. A servant who kills his master whom he has left, upon a grudge conceived against him during his service, is guilty of petit treason: for the traiterous intention was hatched while the relation subsisted between them; and this is only an execution of that intention.

So if a wife be divorced a mensa et thoro, still the vinculum ma-

trimonii subsists; and if she kills such divorced husband, she is a traitress. And a clergyman is understood to owe canonical obedience, to the bishop who ordained him, to him in whose diocese he is beneficed, and also to the metropolitan of such suffragan or diocesan bishop: and therefore to kill any of these is petit treason. As to the rest, whatever has been said, or remains to be observed hereafter, with respect to wilful murder, is also applicable to the crime of petit treason, which is no other than murder in it’s most odious degree: except that the trial shall be as in cases of high treason, before the improvements therein made by the statutes of William III; and also except in it’s punishment.

The punishment of petit treason, in a man, is to be drawn and hanged, and, in a woman, to be drawn and burned: the idea of which latter punishment seems to have been handed down to us from the laws of the antient Druids, which condemned a woman to be burned for murdering her husband; and it is now the usual punishment for all sorts of treasons committed by those of the female sex. Persons guilty of petit treason were first debarred the benefit of clergy by statute 12 Hen. VII. c.7.

## Slide 67

Factual “actual” causation:

- “Harm would not have occurred in the absence of the defendant’s act.”
- “But for X’s conduct, the result would not have happened…”

- “indispensable link in the chain of events”
- Necessary, but not necessarily sufficient (Kidde and Arzon cases)
- “sufficiently direct cause” (Arzon)

## Slide 68

Legal causation:

- **Acosta**: foreseeable; not highly extraordinary; “a possible consequence which reasonably might have been contemplated”

# CAUSATION

Factual cause – if yes continue

Legal cause – if yes continue

Intervening cause? If none, criminal liability. If yes, check if it qualifies:

Is intervening cause a factual predicate of death?
If not, then criminal responsibility; if yes, continue

Is intervening cause is real proximate cause of result? If so, no criminal responsibility; if not, then guilty.
