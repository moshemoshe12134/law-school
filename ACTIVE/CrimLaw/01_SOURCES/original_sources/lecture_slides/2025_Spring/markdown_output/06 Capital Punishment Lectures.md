## Slide 9: Three stages of death penalty law

1.	Antebellum period: automatic death penalty for most felonies
Problem:	Jury nullification
2.	Mid-19th Century - 1960s: absolute jury discretion
Problem:	no guidance; arbitrary; racial discrimination
[3.	Post-Gregg statutes: guided discretion.  ]

---

## Slide 10: Jury discretion – 1930s-1960s

“In that connection whether you recommend or withhold mercy is a matter solely within your discretion, calling for the exercise of your very best and most profound judgment, not motivated by considerations of sympathy or as a means of escaping a hard or disagreeable duty, but must be considered by you in the light of all the circumstances of the case with respect to the evidence submitted to you and the other circumstances surrounding this defendant.”

---

## Slide 11: Caldwell case (Ohio, 1934)

The Foreman: What are grounds for granting mercy?
The Court: That rests solely and wholly in your sound
discretion. You should determine whether or not in your discretion mercy should be granted from a consideration of the evidence, the character of the crime and the attending circumstances. Are there any other questions which you have?

---

## Slide 12: California, 1957

The Foreman: ... We have a question of a point of law and we feel it would be helpful to us in determining a verdict.... What we wish to know is, is there an interpretation of the law which may aid the jury in determining whether the punishment should be a life sentence or the maximum penalty?
The Court: The only thing I can tell you is that it is entirely up to you folks…. The only thing I can say to you, ladies and gentlemen, is that you heard the evidence; you are the sole judges as to what the penalty or punishment is to be in this case. That is up to you. I can't tell you what to do.

---

## Slide 13: Challenges to capital punishment

McGautha v. California (1971): jury discretion is necessary and inevitable, impossible to have standards for death; no violation of 8th/14th.
Furman v. Georgia (1972): death penalty violates the U.S. Constitution

---

## Slide 14: Furman (1972)

Douglas - EPC: race discrimination
Brennan - evolving standards of decency
Stewart - wanton and freakish administration
White - too infrequent to serve punishment goal
Marshall - immoral and discriminates on race and innocence.

## Slide 17: Georgia Statute

Aggravated murder includes kidnapping with bodily injury or ransom where the victim dies; aircraft hijacking; treason...
Requirement of aggravating circumstance:  “Where, upon a trial by jury, a person is convicted of an offense which may be punishable by death, a sentence of death shall not be imposed unless the jury verdict includes a finding of at least one statutory aggravating circumstance...” 17-10-31
After that, jury (or judge) must recommend death. Where a statutory aggravating circumstance is found and a recommendation of death is made, the court shall sentence the defendant to death.... Unless the jury trying the case makes a finding of at least one statutory aggravating circumstance and recommends the death sentence in its verdict, the court shall not sentence the defendant to death, provided that no such finding of statutory aggravating circumstance shall be necessary in offenses of treason or aircraft hijacking.”

## Slide 41

| Year | Does Phil Tomlin have a claim that he could not be punished with LWOP under the 1975 Act? | Max Punishment |
|---|---|---|
| 1975/78 (Crime) | Yes (1) aggravating circumstance must be averred in the indictment; (2) can’t ask jury to return death sentence in non death eligible case | LIFE |
| 1980 US Beck | [Tomlin gets new trial because of preclusion clause; and state courts will have to address mandatory jury verdict from Woodson v. North Carolina | LIFE |
| 1981 AL Beck | No, Tomlin can be sentenced to LWOP or death because (1) it’s §2 that needs to be averred; and (2) § 2(j) serves as aggravating circumstance. | Death or LWOP;  (LWOP because 12-0 LWOP jury) |
| 1981 Kyzer | No, because §2(j) serves as aggravating circumstance | Death or LWOP;  (LWOP jury) |
| 1988 Hays | No, and there is judicial override! | Death by override |
| 2006 Stephens | Possibly. It reverses Beck and Kyzer. Good dicta. But it is under new statute; and it deals with death, not LWOP | LWOP or Life |
| 2011 Magwood | Possibly. Case about death penalty, not LWOP. Bad dicta on LWOP. But good holding on Due Pricess fair warning | LWOP or Life |

## Slide 48: Steiker and Steiker, “Sober Second Thoughts” (1995/2017)

Legitimation = “inducing a false or exaggerated belief in the normative justifiability of something in the social world—that is, of inducing belief in the absence of or in contradiction to evidence of what the phenomenon is ‘really’ like.”  (429–430).
Gramsci = “developed the idea of ‘hegemony’”: “the structure of civil society is maintained not merely by state power, but also by people’s internalization of certain ideas and attitudes that make challenges to the existing order literally unthinkable.”  (430).

---

## Slide 49: Steiker (cont.)

n.352 quoting Gordon:  hegemony = that the most effective kind of domination takes place when both the dominant and subjugated classes believe that the existing order, with perhaps some marginal changes, is satisfactory, or at least represents the most that anyone could expect, because things pretty much have to be the way they are.

## Slide 50: McCleskey v. Kemp (1987)

|  | % sentenced to death |
|---|---|

| Black defendant | 4% |

---

## Slide 51: McCleskey v. Kemp (1987)

|  | Black victim | White victim |
|---|---|---|
| Black defendant | 1% | 22% |
| White defendant | 3% | 8% |

---

## Slide 52: McCleskey v. Kemp (1987)

After analyzing 230 variables, and holding constant the 39 leading nonracial variables:
Defendants charged with killing white victims are 4.3 times as likely to receive a death sentence as defendants charged with killing black victims.
Worse in the mid-range of cases:  14.4% black victim versus 34.4% white victim

---

## Slide 53: Charles Lawrence, “The Id, the Ego, and Equal Protection” (1987)

Central intervention of Critical Race Theory: problems of race in this country are structural, deep, foundational, and cannot simply be fixed by individual correctives. Not just bad apples.
Charles Lawrence: problem of race is structural racism that is internalized, all over, not necessarily intentionally, but internalized through daily experiences.
Cultural meaning test & implicit bias.
