## Slide 6: Blackstone, Commentaries Vol. 4, Chapter 14, p. 195

Murder is, therefore, now thus defined or rather described by Sir Edward Coke: “when a person of sound memory and discretion unlawfully killeth any reasonable creature in being, and under the king’s peace, with malice aforethought, either express or implied.”
Murder distinguished from manslaughter.

---

## Slide 7: Common Law of Murder

Murder is homicide “with malice aforethought”:
*	premeditated -- had formed a plan ahead of time
*	intent to cause death
*	intent to inflict serious bodily harm
*	extreme recklessness & indifference to life
*	felony-murder: during the course of a felony

---

## Slide 8: Blackstone, Commentaries Vol. 4, Chapter 14, p. 191

Manslaughter is therefore thus defined:the unlawful killing of another without malice, either express or implied; which may be either voluntarily, upon a sudden heat, or involuntarily, but in the commission of some unlawful act.
Or “where a person does an act lawful in itself, but in an unlawful manner, and without due caution and circumspection”

---

## Slide 9: Common Law of Manslaughter

Manslaughter is homicide without malice:
(1)	  voluntary:
*	“sudden heat” (p. 191)
*   	imperfect self defense (p. 183)
(2)  involuntary:
*   	“unlawful manner and without due caution and circumspection” (p. 192)

## Slide 19

In WV, the legality of carrying a knife will depend on the type of knife and how it is in his pocket (concealed inside the pocket or clipped against the pocket visibly):
§61-7-3. Carrying deadly weapon without license or other authorization; penalties.(a) Any person who carries a concealed deadly weapon, without a state license or other lawful authorization established under the provisions of this code, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not less than one hundred dollars nor more than one thousand dollars and may be imprisoned in the county jail for not more than twelve months for the first offense; but upon conviction of a second or subsequent offense, he or she shall be guilty of a felony, and, upon conviction thereof, shall be imprisoned in the penitentiary not less than one nor more than five years and fined not less than one thousand dollars nor more than five thousand dollars.
In New York, however, carrying most knives in public is a misdemeanor as they are considered per se "weapons" or "weapons" with intent to use unlawfully when the defendant makes statements about what the knives are for (i.e. "I carry a knife for protection") under NYS PL §265.01. New York City has additional laws prohibition carrying most knives in public or in the subway with administrative law §10-133 and MTA transit law §1050.8.

## Slide 23: Typical CL Heat of Passion Instruction

“such a passion as would naturally be aroused in the mind of an ordinarily reasonable person under the given facts and circumstances”
“so disturbed or obscured by some passion to such an extent as would render ordinary men of average disposition liable to act rashly or without due deliberation and reflection, and from his passion rather than from judgment.”

---

## Slide 24: MPC EED

“EED for which there is reasonable explanation or excuse.  The reasonableness of such explanation or excuse shall be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the actor’s situation under the circumstances as he believes them to be.”

## Slide 27: The Spectrum of Standards

| SUBJECTIVE |  |  |  | OBJECTIVE |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Subjectively felt provoked; believed he was right to act |  |  |  | Reasonable person |
| Look into the mind of the defendant and consider all of his/her experience, rational or irrational |  |  |  | Take an ordinary, rational person off the street and ask what they would do |
|  |  |  |  | Girouard case |

## Slide 28: Spectrum of Subjective/Objective

| Standard | Definition |
|---|---|
| “Sincerely believes” | Purely subjective |
| [MPC self-defense
Sec. 3.04] | Subjective, but belief has to be non-negligently and non-recklessly formed |
| MPC manslaughter Sec. 210.3(1)(b) | “The reasonableness of such explanation or excuse shall be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the actor’s situation under the circumstances as he believes them to be.” |
| “Believes and reasonable to him” |  |
| Reasonably believes |  |
| Believes and the belief is reasonable | ADD:  reasonableness standard is a bit subjective |
| Believes and the belief is reasonable | ADD:  reasonableness standard is a bit objective |
| Reasonable person | Purely objective (Girouard case) |

## Slide 29: Factual Considerations: Are these facts relevant to the decision?

|  | SUBJECTIVE | MPC | OBJECTIVE |
|---|---|---|---|
|  | Pure subjective belief | Reasonable EED; from defendant’s situation | Reasonable person |

## Slide 53: Sarah Stillman, New Yorker

In Wisconsin, where Black individuals account for less than seven per cent of the population, the data show that they make up seventy-six per cent of those incarcerated for felony murder. In St. Louis, every felony-murder conviction between 2010 and 2022—a total of forty-seven people, according to the State of Missouri—was of a Black person.

## Slide 64: Williams (WA)

Common law required “gross negligence” for involuntary manslaughter
RCW 9.48.060: allows simple or ordinary negligence
“Ordinary caution is the kind of caution that a man of reasonable prudence would exercise under the same or similar conditions”
Since repealed: requires criminal negligence

---

## Slide 65

Causation…Williams, p. 474:“The remaining issue of proximate cause….”

---

## Slide 66: Causation issues:

Factual/Actual (“but for”) causation
Legal (proximate) cause
Intervening cause questions

---

## Slide 67: Factual “actual” causation:

“Harm would not have occurred in the absence of the defendant’s act.”
“But for X’s conduct, the result would not have happened…”
MPC 2.03(1)(a)
“indispensable link in the chain of events”
Necessary, but not necessarily sufficient (Kidde and Arzon cases)
“sufficiently direct cause” (Arzon)

---

## Slide 68: Legal causation:

Acosta: foreseeable; not highly extraordinary; “a possible consequence which reasonably might have been contemplated”
Arzon:  “should have been foreseen as being reasonably related to his acts”
MPC 2.03(2 or 3)(b): not too remote or accidental
Most jurisdictions: evolving common law around the notion of reasonably foreseeable
General sense:  more strict than tort standard

---

## Slide 69: Jury Instruction (MA):

X is a cause . . .
without which the death would not have occurred . . .  [factual]
and which, in the natural and continuous sequences, produced the death  [proximate]

---

## Slide 70: Typical Causation Questions:

Without the alleged criminal act, would the victim be dead?
Is the result foreseeable, blameworthy, proximate?
Is there an intervening factor?
Without the intervening act, would the victim be dead?
Was the intervening factor foreseeable, blameworthy, proximate?
