## Slide 4

Racial Disparities in the Prosecution of Sexual Assault

Black women are disproportionately affected by sexual assault.
Studies that examined charging decisions in sexual assault cases show that prosecutors were more likely to file charges in cases involving white victims than those with non-white or Black victims.
Survivors of sexual assault who are Black women disproportionately face criminalization.

Racial Disparities in the Prosecution of Sexual Assault
#StandWith Tracy

© Survived and Punished

“Tracy McCarter’s case is only one example of how the United States’ criminal legal system deems that certain individuals, particularly Black women, have no claim to self-defense.”
- Survived and Punished (Feb. 3, 2024)

Coöperism 3/13 | Radical Acts of Justice with Tracy McCarter, Jocelyn Simonson, and Osyrus Bolly
(Sept. 27, 2023)

“This is part of the power of abolitionist defense campaigns by groups like Survived and Punished—to connect the criminalization of one to the oppression of all. In McCarter’s case, the relentless collective advocacy on behalf of McCarter combined with the collective care shown by all members of her defense campaign—not just for McCarter, but for each other—brought out the dehumanizing nature of a process that allowed McCarter’s case to drag on for more than two years before its dismissal in December 2022.”

## Slide 6

Racial Disparities in the Prosecution of Sexual Assault
Impact of Racial Bias on Decision-Making

Before the Civil War, white men frequently raped enslaved Black women, many of whom were put in a particularly vulnerable position without legal redress, as the legal system operated in a Black offender/white victim rape paradigm, limiting the social meaning of rape. The legal system therefore did not acknowledge the rape of Black women.1
Confronting Racial Bias Against Black and African American Victims in the Prosecution of Sexual Violence, Domestic Violence, Stalking, and Human Trafficking (by AEquitas and The National Black Prosecutors Association, with Wendy Gu and Priscilla Hamilton, April 2021):
Several studies that examined charging decisions in sexual assault cases show that prosecutors are more likely to file charges in cases involving White victims than those with non-White or Black victims.2
Studies have also shown that White mock jurors view Black victims as less truthful and more responsible for their assaults, as compared to White victims.3
Moreover, this research suggests that mock jurors are more sympathetic to victims and defendants who possess similar characteristics to them, including race—a major issue for Black victims and defendants who often face predominantly White juries.4

## Slide 7: McQuirter v. State, 36 Ala. App. 707 (1953)

Long history of false accusations of Black men accused of the sexual assault of white women, resulting even in jury instructions that informed the jury of the “social conditions and customs founded upon racial differences, such as that the prosecutrix was a white woman and defendant was a [Black] man.”
