## Slide 12: Typical robbery question:

“Since the first of this year, has anyone stolen something directly from you by force or after threatening you with harm?”
“Other than that, has anyone tried to take something from you by force even though they did not get it?”

## Slide 13: Recoded to assess neighborhood specific:

Robbery victimization is not neighborhood specific
Commercial sex excluded from disorder
Newark Effect – city versus neighborhood effects
Cross-sectional data for longitudinal theory

## Slide 24: Tentative conclusions….

No evidence that theory is right.
No evidence that disorder causes crime
No evidence that policing disorder reduces crime.
Larger questions:
What is effect on RACE
What is disorder?
What is really going on?

## Slide 33

Ratchet Effect
Selecting on misdemeanors is effectively like sampling more—or over-sampling, in social scientific terms—from the already-targeted group. The resulting sample set will contain a even more disproportionate number of those already-targeted individuals—disproportionate, that is, as compared to their representation in the misdemeanor arrest population. This imbalance will get incrementally worse each year if the NYPD targets neighborhoods on last year’s misdemeanors.
The resulting ratchet effect will have significant detrimental consequences on the employment, educational, familial, and social outcomes of the arrested populations.

## Slide 34

Where does this theory of disorder come from?
Banfield and Wilson:  present-orientedness
“Lower-class”/disorderly versus future oriented/law abider
“A Negro wearing a ‘conk rag’” (Wilson 1968:39-40
What does disorder look like?
Sampson and Raudenbush on “seeing” disorder/race
Danielle Wallace on race/fear/disorder
What is “disorder”?
? Sitting on a stoop?
? Sex work?
? Poverty?
? Complaints of police misconduct?

## Slide 44: Developers

Cede Moses:  ““Retaining an inclusive mix of people will help make the area more cosmopolitan, more creative.” Somehow, this mix will preserve “the neighborhood’s edgy vibe.”
Tom Gimore: “I actually believe that on some level the existence of poor and potentially homeless people or borderline people is not antithetical to a healthy urban environment. It’s really more the stuff that you are seeing on the surface, which is people living in boxes, people who are, to a very large extent, involved in some level of substance abuse, mental illness.”

---

## Slide 45: Media

These developers envision “a harmonious mixing of black-clothed bohos and techie business types with the current populace, which includes Latin American merchants, street people, location film crews and artists living in lofts near the Los Angeles River.”

---

## Slide 46: Larger questions to ask….

How does political economy (social and economic relations, social conditions, wealth distribution) shape punishment?
How do punishment theories (broken windows, incapacitation theory) shape relations of power in society?
How do ideas become forces of legitimation?
