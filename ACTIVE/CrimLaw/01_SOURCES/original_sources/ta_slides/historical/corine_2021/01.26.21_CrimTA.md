Should a specific statute/provision be revised?

How would you  have decided a specific case (or cases) differently?

How would you critique (or support) a legal theory?

- Past  exams , sample answers, and some memoranda  on Courseworks  

## General Tips for Doing Well in Criminal Law {#slide-5}

- Come to TA sessions
- Reach out to me with specific questions  at any time

## Common Law Requirements: Actus Reus {#slide-6}

The  act requirement , or  actus reus , stands for the proposition that just punishment necessitates that punishment be for past, voluntary, wrongful, or potentially harmful conduct that is specified and advanced by statute. 

For criminal liability to attach, there must be a voluntary act or   an   omission. 

And criminal conduct must be voluntary (often called the volition requirement).

What is not voluntary behavior?  Reflexes, convulsion, bodily movements during unconsciousness or sleep. 

## Actus Reus: Model Penal Code {#slide-7}

MPC § 1.13

In this Code, unless a different meaning plainly is required: 

(2) "act" or "action" means a bodily movement whether voluntary or involuntary;

(9) "element of an offense" means 

( i ) such conduct or 

(ii) such attendant circumstances or 

(iii) such a result of conduct as 

(a) is included in the description of the forbidden conduct in the definition of the offense; or

(b) establishes the required kind of culpability; or

(c) negatives an excuse or justification for such conduct; or

(d) negatives a defense under the statute of limitations; or

(e) establishes jurisdiction or venue ;

 

## Actus Reus (Voluntary Acts): Model Penal Code {#slide-8}

MPC § 2.01

(1) A person is not guilty of an offense unless his liability is based on conduct which includes a  voluntary ac t  or the omission to perform an act of which he is physically capable.

(2) The following are not voluntary acts within the meaning of this Section: 

(a) a reflex or convulsion; 

(b) a bodily movement during unconsciousness or sleep; 

(c) conduct during hypnosis or resulting from hypnotic suggestion; 

(d) a bodily movement that otherwise is not a product of the effort or determination of the actor, either conscious or habitual.

## Martin v. State  (Ala. Ct. App. 1994)  {#slide-9}

Facts :  Police officers had arrested him at his house and brought him onto the highway, where he began yelling profanities, indicating a drunken condition. Defendant was convicted of being drunk on a public highway and appealed. 

Statute :  "Any person who, while intoxicated or drunk, appears in any public place where one or more persons are present, . . . and manifests a drunken condition by boisterous or indecent conduct, or loud and profane discourse, shall, on conviction, be fined."

Holding :  Conviction under the statute overturned.

Reasoning :  One cannot be accused of public drunkenness if he was involuntarily brought to a public place by an arresting officer.

- Note: The court doesn't get to the question of whether the statute is invalid, though as Harcourt mentioned, the panel is probably skeptical of such criminality.

## People v. Newton  (Cal. Ct. App. 1970) {#slide-10}

Facts :  Newton (BP co-founder) was pulled over by Officer Frey. In the ensuing struggle over a gun (whose gun is disputed), Frey was fatally shot, and Newton was shot in the abdomen and ended up in the hospital. Newton testified that he had carried no gun and that he had been unconscious between getting shot and ending up in the hospital. 

Holding :  Reversed. The trial court committed reversible error when it failed to instruct the jury on the unconsciousness defense.

Rule :  "Where not self-induced, as by voluntary intoxication or by the equivalent (of which there is no evidence here), unconsciousness is a complete defense to a charge of criminal homicide." (Cal. Pen. Code)

- Does it matter who shot whom first? What if Newton wasn't shot at all?
- Is this statute broader or narrower than MPC § 2.01(2)?

## People v.  Decina   (N.Y. 1956)  {#slide-11}

Facts :  Defendant was indicted for driving despite knowing that he was prone to epileptic attacks that caused him to lose consciousness. He lost consciousness while driving and killed four people. 

Statute :  "A person who operates or drives any vehicle of any kind in a reckless or culpably negligent manner, whereby a human being is killed is guilty of criminal negligence in the operation of a vehicle resulting in death."

- Actus reus: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
- Mens rea: reckless or culpably negligent
- Attendant circumstances: vehicle of any kind; (dead) human being

Holding :  This was criminal negligence within the meaning of the statute.

## People v.  Decina   (N.Y. 1956) (cont'd.) {#slide-12}

Reasoning :  The earlier voluntary act of getting into the car and driving it satisfies the "voluntary act" element of the crime. One may be criminally culpable for involuntary acts caused by a condition if the individual knows of the condition and disregards the possible consequences.

- Is the court's analogy of epilepsy to drunk driving convincing? 
- What if  Decina  had the most severe form of alcoholism? 
- Would this qualify as a reflex or convulsion under MPC § 2.01(2)(a)?
- Is this even an actus reus case? The court talks about decision to drive with epilepsy and "knowledge" and "culpably negligent."

Rule :  As long as there is one voluntary act in the defendant's course of conduct, he may be criminally responsible.

## Kellman ,  Interpretive Construction in the Substantive Criminal Law {#slide-13}

- Two interpretive questions

<!-- -->

- First question (time framing): Are we going to consider a broader history of the defendant?
- Next question (disjoined/unified accounts): Which pieces of the broader history do we connect to the crime?
- Whether broad or narrow, disjoined or unified, the choice is " arational ."
- Once the choice is made, "the question of criminal culpability is forever biased."

<!-- -->

- Broad and narrow views of intent

<!-- -->

- Tension between defendant's will/intent and what the intended conduct actually results in
- Example: What are we saying someone intended to do? Intending to pull trigger or intending to kill? 

<!-- -->

- Broad and narrow views of defendant

<!-- -->

- Looking at defendant broadly forces court to make societal judgments
- Reasonable Person: Looking at D's conduct/intent in that moment versus across time 
- Would a reasonable person in that moment act like that? Or would a reasonable person who has lived through property and had these experiences act like this?

## Kellman  (cont'd.) {#slide-14}

- Narrow time framing

<!-- -->

- "Generally speaking, narrow time frames buttress the traditionally asserted intentionalism of the criminal justice system."
- Translation: Narrow time frames tend to make it easier to pin culpability.

<!-- -->

- Broad time framing

<!-- -->

- "Broad time frame construction is most often used when deterministic discourse supplants the usual intentionalism."
- Translation: Broad time frames are usually used to under cut a defendant's culpability.

<!-- -->

- Disjoined accounts

<!-- -->

- "Disjoined time-framing eases blaming practices where an exculpatory, broad time-framed determinism presses on the would-be  condemnor ."
- Translation: Disjoined accounts help maintain culpability despite broad time frames.

<!-- -->

- Unified accounts

<!-- -->

- Unified accounts tend to exculpate---that is, it tends to prove innocence

<!-- -->

- Me:

<!-- -->

- If you're cherry-picking, as in disjoined, does it really make it easier to pin culpability?
- Couldn't you use a broad time frame, but only pick out the exculpatory events?

## Actus Reus  (Omissions) : Model Penal Code {#slide-15}

MPC § 2.01

(1) A person is not guilty of an offense unless his liability is based on conduct which includes a voluntary act or the  omission  to perform an act of which he is physically capable.

(3) Liability for the commission of an offense may not be based on an omission unaccompanied by action unless:

	(a) the omission is expressly made sufficient by the law defining the offense; or 

	(b) a duty to perform the omitted act is otherwise imposed by law. 

NOTE:  The 2.01(3)(b) duty of care can arise from tort, contract, something in between, etc. ( Jones ). The failure to meet that legal duty must directly result in some criminalized result/conduct

## Jones v. U.S.  (D.C. Cir. 1962) {#slide-16}

Facts :  Defendant was convicted of involuntary manslaughter because of failure to provide for a friend's infant child. Unclear whether D agreed to take care of the baby or was compensated. D nonetheless had the financial means to provide food and medical care. 

Rule :  "The duty neglected must be a legal duty, and not a mere moral obligation. It must be a duty imposed by law or by contract, and the omission to perform the duty must be the immediate and direct cause of death." ( Beardsley )

Holding :  Lower court's failure to instruct the jury on neglect of legal duty as a critical element of the crime is plain error. Reversed and remanded.

- Note the 4 situations that can result in criminal breach of duty.

## Mens Rea:  Model Penal Code {#slide-17}

MPC § 1.13

- (12) intent = purpose
- (16) reasonable belief ≠ reckless or negligent

<!-- -->

- The bar for "reasonable belief" is at least as high as that for "knowingly."

MPC § 2.02(2)

- (a) Purposely
- (b) Knowingly
- (c) Recklessly
- (d) Negligently

## Mens Rea:  Model Penal Code {#slide-18}

MPC § 2.02(3)

Default mens rea is recklessness.

This is because (1) a prosecutor wouldn't go for the higher mens rea and make it unnecessarily harder for her case; and (2) a jury wouldn't need a higher mens rea to convict.

MPC § 2.02(4)

Unless there is a clearly contrary purpose, the mens rea that attaches to the actus reus attaches to the other elements of the crime.

MPC § 2.02(5)

Proving one mens rea also proves every mens rea "below" the proven level of culpability.

## Regina v. Cunningham  (UK 1957) {#slide-20}

Facts :  Defendant tore gas meter from wall to get \$ and in so doing caused a gas leak leading to the partial asphyxiation of his future mother-in-law. He was convicted of maliciously administering a noxious thing after the trial judge instructed the jury that malicious meant wicked.

Statute :  "Whosoever shall unlawfully and maliciously administer to or cause to be administered to or taken by any other person any poison or other destructive or noxious thing, so as thereby to endanger the life of such person, or so as thereby to inflict upon such person any grievous bodily harm, shall be guilty of felony . . . ."

Actus reus: administer; OR cause to be administered/taken \[poison/destructive/noxious thing\] 

Mens rea: maliciously

Attendant circumstance: any other person

Result: endanger the life of such person; OR inflict grievous bodily harm

## Regina v. Cunningham  (UK 1957) (cont'd) {#slide-21}

Issue :  Whether the trial judge erred in instructing jury that malice meant wickedness

Holding :  Yes, the trial court erred. Malice requires more than just wickedness; the defendant must have foreseen and recklessly disregarded the harm.

What is wickedness, anyway?

Takeaway :  Negligence is insufficient for a showing of malice.

See  MPC 2.02(2)

## Regina v. Faulkner  (UK 1877) {#slide-22}

Facts :  Defendant was trying to steal rum from a ship, lit a match and accidentally set ship on fire, destroying it. He was charged with violating the Malicious Damage Act by "maliciously" setting fire to the ship. Trial judge instructed jury that if they found him guilty of theft and believed fire took place during theft, he should be liable for the fire.

Statute :  "feloniously, unlawfully, and maliciously" set fire to the ship

Issue :  If the defendant, in the commission of a felony, accidentally commits a collateral act that would be a felony if committed intentionally, should be found guilty of that second felony as well.

## Regina v. Faulkner  (UK 1877) (cont'd) {#slide-23}

Holding :  No. The defendant can't be convicted for an act that is the unintended and unforeseeable consequence of a lesser offense. In order to maliciously set fire to the ship, defendant must have acted intentionally and willfully.

Takeaway :  Malice requires that the defendant foresaw the disputed consequences.

## State v. Hazelwood  (AK 1997) {#slide-24}

Facts :  Defendant, captain of an oil tanker, ran his ship into a reef. The crash resulted in 11 million gallons of oil spilling into the water.

Statute :  It is a misdemeanor to negligently "discharge, cause to be discharged, or permit the discharge of petroleum . . . upon the waters or land of the state." 

Actus reus: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Mens rea: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Attendant circumstance: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Issue :  Whether ordinary civil negligence can be applied in a criminal case.

## State v. Hazelwood  (AK 1997) (cont'd) {#slide-25}

Holding :  Yes. Ordinary negligence can be applicable.

Criminal negligence requires a risk so great that failing to perceive it constitutes a  gross  deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the situation.

A court can apply either standard depending on the reasonableness of the expectation of individual conformity to the standard of care.

Reasoning :  Either standard will reasonably deter the criminal behavior.

But would a conviction and consequent sentence be proportionate to the differing levels of culpability?

## Santillanes v. New Mexico  (NM 1993) {#slide-26}

Facts :  Defendant cut his 7-year-old nephew's neck with a knife during an altercation. At trial, the judge instructed the jury that civil negligence applied. He was convicted of child abuse.

Statute :  Child abuse is "negligently causing a child to be placed in a situation that may endanger the child's life or health."

Actus reus: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Mens rea: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Attendant circumstance: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Rule :  Civil negligence is "one which a reasonably prudent person would foresee as involving an unreasonable risk of injury to himself or to another and which such a person, in the exercise of ordinary care, would not do."

## Santillanes v. New Mexico  (NM 1993) (cont'd) {#slide-27}

Issue :  Whether the court can apply civil negligence in a criminal case.

Holding :  No. The requisite culpability for a criminal act is higher than that of a civil tort.

Reasoning :  When moral condemnation and social opprobrium attach to a conviction of a crime, the crime should reflect a mental state warranting such contempt.

The culpability should reflect the seriousness of the crime.

## Mens Rea:  Distinguishing  Hazelwood  from  Santillanes {#slide-28}

Statutory language shows two crimes of varying degrees of seriousness.

Hazelwood

Petroleum discharge can be legal with a permit/license.

Typical criminal actors might be experts/experienced and thus can be held to a higher standard of care (lower bar for criminality =  less leeway in deviation from care = higher standard)

Santillanes

Child abuse carries with it a lot of moral baggage. Can you ever get a child abuse permit?

Despite the moral baggage, "endangering the child's life or health" without more specificity would cover a lot of conduct. Do we want to criminalize every negligent act that endangers a child?

## Elonis v. United States  (2015) {#slide-29}

Facts :  Defendant was convicted of communicating online threats through Facebook posts, which contained violent rap lyrics.

Statute :  It is a crime to transmit in interstate commerce "any communication containing any threat . . .  t o injure the person of another." 18 U.S.C. § 875(c).

Issue :  Whether the defendant needed to be aware of the threatening nature of the communication.

## Elonis v. United States  (2015) (cont'd) {#slide-30}

Holding :  Yes. There must be a mens rea attached to the wrongful conduct.

Reasoning :  Just because no mens rea is listed in the statute doesn't mean that there is none. Criminality requires a minimum of negligence. 

Wrongdoing must be conscious to be criminal. 

A guilty mind is a necessary element in the indictment and proof of every crime.

Takeaway :  When there is no (clear) mens rea, use the statutory text to interpret one into the statute. 

If one cannot be read into the statute, apply the default rules of the jurisdiction---recklessness in MPC-land.

Note: Court suggests that you shouldn't apply negligence when possible.
