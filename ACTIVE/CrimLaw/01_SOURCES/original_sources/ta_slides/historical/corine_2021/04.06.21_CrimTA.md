## Insanity:  Model Penal Code {#slide-2}

MPC § 4.01

(1) A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct as a result of mental disease or defect he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality/wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law. 

(2) "mental disease or defect" does not include an abnormality manifested only by repeated criminal or otherwise anti-social conduct

MPC § 4.02

(1) Evidence of mental disease or defect is admissible if it is relevant to prove that the defendant did or didn't have a state of mind that is an element of the offense.

## Insanity:  Model Penal Code {#slide-3}

MPC § 4.03

(1) Mental disease of defect excluding responsibility is an affirmative defense.

MPC § 4.04

No one who lacks the capacity to understand the proceedings against him or to assist the defense attorney shall be tried, convicted or sentenced so long as he suffers the mental disease or defect.

## Insanity:  Burden of Proof {#slide-4}

Burden of Proof/Persuasion

About 75% states place burden on defendants (usually by preponderance of the evidence)

Should be significantly easier to prove than "beyond a reasonable doubt."

Florida and the U.S. require "clear and convincing evidence."

Washington requires "to a reasonable certainty."

## Insanity:  Case Law {#slide-5}

M'Naghten's  Case  (U.K. 1843)

Rule :  It must be clearly proved that, at the time of commission of the act, that the defendant suffered from a mental disease which makes him unable to know the nature and quality of the criminal conduct or the wrongfulness of the act.

Whether the accused at the time of doing the act knew the difference between right and wrong

Harcourt:  Cognition test---whether your brain understands what you're doing or right/wrong.

## Insanity:  Case Law {#slide-6}

Yates v. State  (Tex. Ct. App. 2005)

Facts :  Defendant drowned her 5 children, trying to "save them from Satan." There was evidence of severe depression and attempted suicide. She received psychiatric help, to whom she told about visions and voices. Yates also suffered from catatonia (physical/behavioral symptoms associated with schizophrenia). Jury rejected her insanity defense.

Holding :  Reversed.

The lone expert testimony stating she may have gotten the story from Law & Order was false.

Takeaway :  This case shows the potential for injustice in a criminal trial that turns on a battle of the experts. 

This also illustrates how unpredictably a jury will find on an insanity defense. 

## Insanity:  Case Law {#slide-7}

Blake v. U.S.  (5th Cir. 1969)

Facts :  Defendant was convicted of bank robbery. He presented evidence showing that he required psychiatric treatment for at least 20 years. Expert testimony said he was schizophrenic, which often manifested in psychotic episodes. Blake was also a heavy drinker and drug user. 

Issue :  Whether the jury instruction should have used the MPC standard or  Davis .

Holding :  The lower court should have used a "substantial capacity" standard like in the MPC.

We know that Blake suffered some mental illness under modern understandings, but  Davis  is too prohibitive/narrow.

Davis  would disallow the defense whenever a person was not unconscious, incapable of distinguishing right and wrong, nor completely robbed of his free will.

## Insanity:  Case Law {#slide-8}

U.S. v. Lyons  (5th Cir. 1984) ( en  banc)

Facts :  Defendant was convicted of several drug crimes, which required mens  reas  of "knowingly and intentionally." Lyons wanted to admit evidence pointing to his insanity, but the trial court excluded it. 

Holding :  Court should've admitted evidence of brain and psychological damage.

We overturn  Blake 's volitional prong (lack of capacity to conform one's conduct to the requirements of the law).

Rule :  A person is not responsible for criminal conduct on the grounds of insanity only if at the time of that conduct, as a result of a mental disease or defect, he is unable to appreciate the wrongfulness of that conduct.

## Insanity:  Case Law {#slide-9}

Kahler v. Kansas  (2020)

Issue :  Whether Kansas' statute(which abrogates the  M'Naghten  rule of moral cognition) violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments

Holding :  No. Due process doesn't require states to adopt an insanity defense that turns on a defendant's ability to recognize moral wrongfulness of the criminal conduct.

Mens rea is always a requirement, and there remains a defense of being mentally incapable of forming the requisite mens rea.

Thus, there functionally remains an insanity-like defense.

SCOTUS won't adopt one version of the insanity defense over others; the states can choose.

Harcourt: Seems quite disconnected with the times. Going back to English definitions and Blackstone but should be contextualized for the history we face today. Harcourt calls Kagan's opinion a gross indifference to contemporary reality of mental health.

## Attempt:  Model Penal Code {#slide-12}

MPC § 5.01

(1) A person is guilty of attempt if, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for commission of the crime, he:

(a) purposely engages in conduct which would constitute the crime if the attendant circumstances were as he believes them to be;

(b) when causing a particular result is an element of the crime, does or omits to do anything with the purpose of causing or with the belief that it will cause such result without further conduct on his part; OR

(c) purposely does or omits to do anything which, under the circumstances as he believes them to be, is an act or omission constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in his commission of the crime.

## Attempt:  Model Penal Code {#slide-13}

MPC § 5.01

(2) Substantial step under (1)(c) requires "strongly corroborative of the actor's criminal purpose." The following may prove a substantial step:

(a) lying in waiting, searching for, or following the contemplated victim

(b) enticing or seeking to entice the contemplated victim of the crime to go to the place contemplated for its commission

(c) reconnoitering the place contemplated for the commission of the crime

(d) possession of materials to be used for committing the crime, which are specially designed for such use or which serve no lawful purpose under the circumstances

(e) possession, collection, or fabrication of materials to be used in the crime, at or near contemplated place of crime, where such possession, collection, or fabrication serves no lawful purpose under the circumstances

(f) soliciting an innocent agent to engage in conduct constituting an element of crime

## Attempt:  Model Penal Code {#slide-14}

MPC § 5.01

(3) Engaging in conduct that would render you complicit under MPC § 2.06 if the crime were committed, is guilty of attempt, even though the crime is not committed or attempted by the principal criminal actor.

(4) It is an affirmative defense that the actor abandoned the criminal effort or otherwise prevented its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose. This defense doesn't affect the liability of an accomplice who didn't join in abandonment or prevention.

## Attempt:  Case Law {#slide-15}

Smallwood v. State  (Md. Ct. App. 1996)

Facts :  Smallwood was convicted of assault with intent to murder three rape victims. Evidence showed he knew about the dangers of HIV contraction and raped his victims nonetheless. The prosecution analogized the defendant carrying HIV to carrying a deadly weapon and deploying it through unprotected sex.

Holding :  This is not intent to kill.

Reasoning :  The risk of death by AIDS is too far removed, relative to firing a gun at the head of a victim, as in  Raines . You need more evidence.

Actively conceal HIV-positive status and refuse request to wear condom, and said he would spread to others ( Hinkhouse )

Jabbing with a syringe, shouting "I'll give you AIDS." ( Caine )

Takeaway :  To convict only on the risk of death, death must be the natural and probable result of the act. Otherwise, you need specific intent to kill.

## Attempt:  Case Law {#slide-16}

People v. Rizzo  (N.Y. 1927)

Facts :  Defendant was with a group planning to rob Charles Rao while on his way to cash his paycheck. Rizzo and the crew drove around looking for their target, but they never found him. Police arrested them before they could rob Rao. 

Issue :  Whether the steps taken by the defendant constitute attempt to commit robbery 

Holding :  This is not attempt to commit robbery, merely preparation.

The law doesn't recognize mere preparation tending towards the commission of a crime.

The acts tending towards the commission of a crime must be so near to its accomplishment that in all reasonable probability the crime itself would've been committed, but for timely interference.

There must be dangerous proximity to success ( Hyde ).

## Attempt:  Case Law {#slide-17}

McQuirter v. State  (Ala. Ct. App. 1953)

Facts :  A Black man was found guilty of attempted assault with intent to rape. Allegedly, he followed a white woman with her children into a white neighborhood. When he approached her, she told her children to run and get Simmons. McQuirter left after seeing Simmons. The police chief testified that McQuirter confessed to an intent to rape the first woman to pass his truck. McQuirter testified that he was simply sitting in the area where the woman was.

Holding :  There was sufficient evidence to submit to the jury the question of the defendant's guilt.

Intent is a jury question to be adduced at trial. 

You can admit inferential evidence to determine the defendant's intent.

Recall only direct evidence of intent came from sheriff's testimony

The jury may consider social conditions and customs founded on racial differences.
