## Sexual Assault:  Model Penal Code {#slide-2}

MPC § 213.1

(1) A male who has sexual intercourse with a female not his wife is guilty of rape if:

He compels her to submit by force or by threat of imminent death, serious bodily injury, extreme pain or kidnapping, to be inflicted on anyone; or

He has substantially impaired her power to appraise or control her conduct by administering or employing without her knowledge drugs, intoxicants or other means for the purpose of preventing resistance; or

The female is unconscious; or

The female is less than 10 years old.

## Sexual Assault:  Model Penal Code {#slide-3}

MPC § 213

The MPC falls back on the default mens rea of recklessness.

Assumes---erroneously---that even forcible sex between husband and wife is always consented to by the fact of marriage.

Rape is a second-degree felony unless:

The defendant inflicts serious bodily injury during commission of rape; or

The victim (1) was not a voluntary social companion and (2) had not previously permitted him sexual liberties.

## Sexual Assault:  Common Law {#slide-4}

Actus reus: Vaginal intercourse

Attendant circumstance #1: Woman

Attendant circumstance #2: Force

What would indicate force beyond fact of rape (unauthorized penetration)?

Attendant circumstance #3: Against her will

Mens rea: No explicit mens rea, but the law extracted intent from the fact of a woman resisting his forcible penetration.

Often framed as "utmost resistance"

## Sexual Assault:  Common Law \[Progressive\] {#slide-5}

Actus reus: Penetration

Attendant circumstance #1: Any person

Attendant circumstance #2: No additional force (beyond penetration)

Attendant circumstance #3: Lack of affirmative consent

Mens rea: Strict liability or negligence

Proof of mens rea: No resistance requirement

## Sexual Assault:  Elements of the Crime {#slide-6}

Actus Reus

Proof of force is an essential prerequisite for criminal liability.

Force + non-consent

Distinguishing between force and non-consent means that force requires actions beyond the fact of unauthorized/non-consensual penetration.

Force requirement

Majority rule: Defendant's force and victim's non-consent  before  act of penetration is required to be a felony

Force is  not  inherent in sexual penetration. Force must cause victim to be sexually penetrated against their will, evidenced most clearly by some form of struggle.

Victim's resistance can indicate both the force exerted by the defendant and the victim's non-consent.

Threat of force

Examine if victim's fear arising from threat was genuine (subjective) and reasonable (objective) ( Rusk ).

Actus Reus

- Resistance Requirement

<!-- -->

- Meant to show that force was being used, especially when force was only moderate force

<!-- -->

- Resistance requirement mostly implied today

<!-- -->

- (some statutes expressly require it)

<!-- -->

- Even in states where resistance is not required, it is still highly probative of questions on whether

<!-- -->

- intercourse was forcible, non-consensual, and what D's mens rea was

## Sexual Assault:  Case Law {#slide-11}

State v. Rusk  (Md. Ct. App. 1981)

Facts :  Victim refused to go to defendant's apartment. The defendant takes her car keys and goes inside. Victim goes into defendant's apartment and has sex with the defendant. Victim repeatedly told the defendant "no." There was light choking of the neck prior to penetration.

Issue :  Whether the elements of the rape statute could be established and whether "force or threat of force" was satisfied, given the lack of the resistance.

Turns on victim's fear, which must be subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable

Holding :  Defendant's conviction is upheld.

Subjectively genuine: easy to prove

Objectively reasonable: light choking is evidence of physical force

Takeaway :  Physical force, even a "light" amount of force, can prove the reasonableness of a victim's fear.

 

## Sexual Assault:  Case Law {#slide-12}

State v.  DiPetrillo   (R.I. 2007)

Facts :  Victim was an employee at the defendant's business. Defendant asked victim to work late, called her into his office, grabbed her, pulled her onto his lap, and kissed her. Victim repeatedly told defendant to stop, but defendant proceeded to penetrate her with his finger. Defendant was found guilty of 1 st  and 2 nd  degree sexual assault.

Statute :  1 st  degree (Rhode Island's equivalent of rape) requires proof of sexual penetration by force or coercion. 2 nd  degree requires proof of sexual contact by force or coercion.

Issue :  Whether these facts prove force or coercion

Holding :  Conviction reversed; not clearly implied threat of physical force.

## Sexual Assault:  Case Law {#slide-13}

State in the Interest of M.T.S.  (N.J. 1992)

Facts :  17-year-old defendant engaged in consensual kissing and sexual contact with the 15-year-old victim. In a second encounter, he engaged in sexual penetration while she was asleep. No "unusual or extra" force or threats of force.

Statute :  Sexual assault is the commission of sexual penetration with another person with the use of physical force or coercion. 

"Sexual penetration" and "physical force or coercion" are separate elements.

Issue :  Whether fact of non-consensual sexual penetration constitutes force

Holding :  Penetration alone constitutes force.

Court analogizes to assault and battery, where any unauthorized touch is assault and battery. Thus, any unauthorized penetration is rape/sexual assault.

Force = penetration in the absence of freely given permission

Takeaway : Lack of affirmative consent is non-consent and evidence of force

## Sexual Assault:  Case Law {#slide-14}

State in the Interest of M.T.S.  (N.J. 1992)

More Takeaways : 

Default presumption of non-consent

Court imputes affirmative consent into the statute through battery. Any unauthorized touching is battery, so any unauthorized penetration is rape.

Shifts focus to victim's conduct and words

Prosecution meets burden of proof by showing an absence of affirmative consent, which is easily satisfied through an absence of evidence.

The burden is effectively the defendant's from the beginning, which trends towards strict liability.

Force is satisfied by the act of penetration. Court interprets force in statute to mean "no additional force beyond penetration"

## Sexual Assault:  Case Law {#slide-15}

Commonwealth v. Sherry  (Mass. 1982)

Facts :  A nurse and 3 doctors were at a party. All left together and went to a house. Victim said "no" but felt physically numb and couldn't fight back. Each defendant had sex with her.

Issue :  Whether defendants were entitled to an instruction of a good faith mistake defense (requiring actual knowledge to defeat the defense).

Holding :  The fact of the victim's clear "no" makes this potential defense inapplicable.

Takeaway :  Open question as to whether the mens rea is negligence or strict liability.

Harcourt thinks the court is trending towards strict liability, based solely on the fact of the victim's "no" and independent of the defendant's intent or awareness.

## Sexual Assault:  Case Law {#slide-16}

Commonwealth v. Fischer  (Pa. Super. 1998)

Facts :  There were 2 sexual encounters between college classmates. Defendant argued both were consensual. Victim argued "no" in the 2 nd  encounter. Victim claimed that defendant raped her by forcible oral sex, restraining her, and preventing her from leaving despite verbal refusals. Defendant asked for instruction for defense of mistake based on previous sexual interactions.

Holding :  The defendant isn't entitled to this defense.

Under  Williams , the court can't create a mistake of fact defense for consent.

The legislature must create the defense via statute.
