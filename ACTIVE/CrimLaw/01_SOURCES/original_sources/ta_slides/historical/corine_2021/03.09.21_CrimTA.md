## Capital Punishment : Cases Continued {#slide-3}

McCleskey v. Kemp  (1987) 

Facts : McCleskey was convicted of death-eligible murder. The jury recommended death, and the judge sentenced him accordingly. The Baldus study showed that the DP in GA was imposed in a racially discriminatory manner against Black defendants, with particularly great frequency when the murder victim was white. 

Issue : Whether the Baldus study shows that Georgia's capital-sentencing process violates the 8 th  and 14 th  Amendments. 

Holding : No, the study does not demonstrate a constitutionally significant risk of racial bias in GA's capital-sentencing process. 

## Capital Punishment : Cases Continued {#slide-4}

McCleskey v. Kemp  (1987) 

Reasoning : (1) There is no evidence of discriminatory intent by the jury or the legislature. (2) Don't want to see too many of these challenges in federal court. (3) Problem better addressed to the legislature.

Takeaway : Prime example of the inadequacies of justice under  law .

If you take Powell's argument at face value, the (purely) constitutional argument, as framed, makes sense. You need evidence of discriminatory/invidious intent of the jury or the legislature.

No evidence submitted indicating jury bias.

The statute itself does not extend special protection to one class of people to the targeted detriment to another. No legislative history supporting such a contention.

But, is this really justice? 

Are you convinced that the political/legislative process in GA in 1987 would adequately correct this problem in the state's capital-sentencing process?

## Capital Punishment:  Theory {#slide-5}

Steiker  &  Steiker ,  Sober Second Thoughts

Court\'s death penalty jurisprudence fall into two diametrically opposed camps.

Critics claim court has turned its back on issues that gave rise to constitutionalizing of death penalty in the first place

The death penalty is, perversely, both over- and under- regulated.

Court has avoided outcome regulation and super due process of death penalty

Court's actions have  legitimated  the death penalty

Article tries to suggest that rules about the death penalty (individualized sentencing,  Atkins , complicated jurisprudence) never had the effect of reducing or containing the death penalty, but made it seem that we were checking the death penalty fairly and were legitimating it (Gramscian/legitimation theory). 

(1) Makes us feel better about the American legal system

(2) Makes us feel better about the capital punishment system in general.

(3) Outcome in any particular case justified b/c of this.

Lawrence,  The Id, the Ego and Equal Protection

We are all racist. And most of us are unaware of our racism. In other words, a large part of the behavior that produces racial discrimination is influenced by unconscious racial motivation.

There are two explanations for this: (1) Freudian theory: the human mind defends itself against the discomfort of guilt; (2) cognitive psychology states that culture transmits certain beliefs and preference. 

Where the goal is to eradicate invidious racial discrimination, equal protection must find a way to come to grips with unconscious racism. 

Suggests a test instead of the one adopted in  Washington v. Davis  (1976): Evaluate government conduct to determine whether it conveys a symbolic message to which the culture attaches racial significance. 

Focusing on unconscious beliefs of actors rather than overt motives because racism continues to be aided by self-conscious bigots and well-meaning liberals alike. This can help balance that

Bright,  Counsel for the Poor

See outline of the article posted on CW.

The  Strickland  Standard

To prevail on ineffective counsel, a defendant must overcome

A "strong presumption that counsel's conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance," Show that the attorney's representation "fell below an objective standard of reasonableness," and Establish "prejudice," which is defined as a reasonable probability that counsel's errors affected the outcome.

Basically impossible. Lawyers were found "effective" even after evidence showed that attended trials drunk, put on no mitigating evidence, were asleep, etc. 

All justified as reasonable trial strategy or in fear of telling a lawyer how to operate their case load. 

Thoughts? How to move past this?
