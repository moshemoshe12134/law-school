## Self-Defense:  Model Penal Code {#slide-3}

MPC § 3.04

(1) Subject to (2), (3), and MPC § 3.09, the use of force is justifiable when the actor believes that such force is immediately necessary to protect himself against use of unlawful force.

(2) Limitations of justified use of force

(a) Not justified

( i ) Resisting arrest which the actors knows is being made by a peace officer

(ii) Resisting force by person claiming right of her property (with exceptions)

(b) Deadly force not justified unless actor  believes  force is necessary to protect himself against death, serious bodily harm, kidnapping, or rape. Also not justifiable if:

Actor provoked, with purpose of causing death or serious bodily harm, the use of force

Actor knows he can avoid necessity of deadly force by retreating, surrendering property, or complying

## Self-Defense:  Model Penal Code {#slide-4}

MPC § 3.04

(2) Limitations of justified use of force

(c) Standard of review is force necessary under the circumstances as the actor believes them to be when the force is used

No reasonableness requirement, but limited by MPC 3.09

MPC § 3.09

(1) Self-defense justification not available when the actor's belief as to the unlawfulness of the force being used against him (or unlawfulness of the arrest) is erroneous AND his error is due to ignorance or mistake as to the provisions of the MPC, any other provision of the criminal law, OR the law governing search and arrest.

## Self-Defense:  Model Penal Code {#slide-5}

MPC § 3.09

(2) When the actor is  reckless  or  negligent  in forming his belief regarding the necessity of force, the justification is unavailable for offenses involving a mens rea of  recklessness  or  negligence .

Imperfect self-defense

The law expects you to be intentional or knowledgeable about your use of force.

(3) When the actor is justified in use of force but recklessly or negligently  injures  or  creates a risk of injury  to innocent people, the justification is unavailable in a prosecution for such recklessness or negligence to innocent people.

## Self-Defense:  Model Penal Code {#slide-6}

MPC § 3.11 

(1) "unlawful force" is force, including confinement, which is employed without the person's consent and would constitute an offense or a tort.

(2) "deadly force" is force which the actor uses with the purpose of causing or which he knows to create a substantial risk of causing death or seriously bodily harm.

Purposely firing a gun in the direction of another person or at a vehicle in which another person is believed to be in constitutes deadly force.

A threat of deadly force is not deadly force so long as the actor's purpose is limited to creating an apprehension of deadly force.

You need some affirmative act that creates the substantial risk of death or serious bodily harm.

## Self-Defense:  Case Law {#slide-7}

U.S. v. Peterson  (D.C. Cir. 1973)

Conditions for using deadly use of force (in self-defense):

(1) There must have been a threat, actual or apparent, of the use of deadly force against the actor;

(2) Threat must have been unlawful and immediate;

(3) Actor must have  believed  he was in imminent peril of death or serious bodily harm, and that his response was necessary to save himself; AND

(4) These beliefs must have been  honestly entertained  and  objectively reasonable  in light of the circumstances

Takeaway :  Self-defense justified when the actor's belief is reasonable.

 

## Self-Defense:  Case Law {#slide-8}

People v. Goetz  (N.Y. 1986)

Facts :  Four youths were in a subway car with defendant, who held a concealed gun. He began carrying this gun after a mugging a few years prior. One of the youths walked up to defendant and demanded \$5 from him. No evidence that the kids were armed, though some had screwdrivers in their coats. Defendant shot each of the kids, shooting twice at one whom he missed initially. He admitted to the shootings and told police he would've shot more had he had more bullets.

Procedural History :  Grand jury indicted on attempted murder, assault, and other charges. Lower courts dismissed the charges on the ground that the prosecutor's explanation of "reasonably believes" to was erroneous.

Whether the defendant's conduct was that of a reasonable man in the defendant's situation.

 

## Self-Defense:  Case Law {#slide-9}

People v. Goetz  (N.Y. 1986)

NYPL § 35.15(1) A person may use physical force when and to the extent he  reasonably believes  such to be necessary to defend himself or a third person from what he  reasonably believes  to be the use or imminent use of unlawful physical force by such other person.

NYPL § 35.15(2) A person may not use deadly physical force unless he (a)  reasonably believes  that such other person is using or about to use deadly physical force, or (b)  reasonably  believes that such person is committing or attempting to commit a kidnapping, forcible rape, or robbery.

 

## Self-Defense:  Case Law {#slide-10}

People v. Goetz  (N.Y. 1986)

Holding :  This court reinstates all counts of the indictment.

Reasoning :  NYPL requires reasonableness.

NY adopted much of the MPC but crucially added "reasonably" before "believes." 

Interpreting the statute to say "reasonable to him" would render "reasonably" meaningless and would allow subjective views to completely exonerate him.

Lower courts' interpretation would allow citizens to set their own standards for permissible use of force.

Reasonableness inquiry happens with regard to the actual circumstances of the particular incident, including past experiences of the defendant.

Takeaway :  "Reasonably" must be interpreted objectively and can't be solely based on defendant's own subjective interpretation. The objectivity of defendant's belief may be informed by circumstances of the case, e.g., past defendant's past experiences.  Cf.  Kellman .

 

## Self-Defense:  Battered Woman/Spouse Syndrome {#slide-11}

State v. Norman  (N.C. 1989)

Facts :  Norman was badly abused during 25-year marriage. She shot her husband while he was asleep and was charged with first-degree murder. At trial, she presented evidence of suffering from battered wife syndrome as proof of a perfect self-defense. Jury convicted of voluntary manslaughter.

Holding :  Self-defense is available only for imminent harm, not future harm.

Seems like a pretty narrow time frame.  Cf. Goetz ;  Kellman .

Reasoning :  Necessity defense only where defendant killed victim due to reasonable belief that death/great bodily harm was imminent

Evidence here doesn't show Norman reasonable believed she was confronted by threat of imminent death/great bodily harm.

There was ample time to resort to other means to prevent further abuse.

No action underway by decedent from which jury could've found reasonable grounds to believe an imminent danger.

## Self-Defense:  Duty to Retreat {#slide-12}

Traditional View

English common law imposed strict duty to retreat. A person could use deadly force in self-defense only after exhausting every chance to flee, when his back was against the wall.

Late 1800s View

The law will not permit the taking of a human life to repel mere trespass, but a true man who is without fault is not obliged to fly from an assailant.  See   Erwin v. State  (Ohio 1876).

Modern View

The "true man" doctrine (originating in  Erwin ) is rejected in some jurisdictions (e.g. Ohio) and accepted in others (e.g. Tennessee).

True man/no retreat/stand your ground rule considered the majority approach.

MPC adopts a version of this rule with some exceptions.

## Self-Defense:  Duty to Retreat {#slide-13}

Castle Exception

In all jurisdictions requiring retreat before using deadly force, an exception is made when the defendant is attacked in her own home by an intruder.  See People v. Tomlin  (N.Y. 1914).

Gets tricky with guests and co-occupants

Only a few states require retreat from an attacking guest.  See  Carpenter,  Of the Enemy Within, the Castle Doctrine, and Self-Defense .

A father threatened by his son could kill the son rather than retreat.  See   Tomlin ;  State v. Jones    (S.C. 2016); MPC § 3.04(2)(b)(ii)(1).

Some courts require homeowner to flee if possible from a co-occupant attacker.  See State v.  Gartland  (N.J. 1997).
