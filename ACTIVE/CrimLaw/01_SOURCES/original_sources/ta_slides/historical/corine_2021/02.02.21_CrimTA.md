## Homicide: Model Penal Code {#slide-2}

MPC §  210

(1) human being: born and alive

The MPC distinguishes between homicide and feticide.

(3) serious bodily injury: substantial risk of death, permanent disfigurement, or protracted loss/impairment of the function of any body part/organ

(4) deadly weapon: firearm; or any other thing that is used or is intended to be used to cause death or serious bodily injury

Basically, no object is off the table as a deadly weapon so long as the intent is there.

## Homicide: Model Penal Code {#slide-3}

MPC § 210.2 Murder

(a) committed purposely or knowingly; or

(b) committed recklessly + circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life

Mens rea is presumed if the defendant was in the commission of some of the listed felonies.

MPC § 210.3 Manslaughter

(a) committed recklessly; or

(b) murder + extreme mental or emotional disturbance for which there is a reasonable explanation/excuse

Reasonableness from perspective of a person in the defendant's situation under the circumstances as he believes them to be.

This is a very subjective standard, which can be more defendant friendly.

 

## Homicide: Model Penal Code {#slide-4}

MPC § 210.4 Negligent Homicide

(1) committed negligently

MPC § 210.5 Causing or Aiding Suicide

(1)  Causing Suicide as Criminal Homicide.  Purposely causes suicide by force, duress, or deception

(2)  Aiding or Soliciting Suicide as an Independent Offense.  Conduct causes suicide or attempted suicide + some other misdemeanor.

## Homicide: Common Law {#slide-5}

Common Law (Blackstone) Murder

Killing of a human being by another human being with malice aforethought

Aforethought is relevant when there's a distinction of premeditation or spur-of-the-moment.

Common Law First Degree Murder (PA)

Willful, deliberate, and premeditated

Willful = intent to kill

Deliberate = no excitement or passion, i.e., not excused 

Premeditated = gray area; debated in  Carroll  and  Guthrie

## Intended Killings: Premeditation {#slide-7}

Commonwealth v. Carroll  (PA 1963)

Facts :  After an argument, defendant shot his wife in the back of the head (2x) while they were laying in bed. She allegedly harmed their children, and it is disputed whether she suffered from a mental disorder. The gun was placed in the bedroom for the wife's safety. Testified that he didn't "know positively" if he intended to murder his wife

Statue :  First degree murder is a willful, deliberate, and premeditated killing.

Issue :  Whether the defendant's actions constitute a premeditated killing.

Holding :  This is a premeditated killing.

Premeditation can occur just in the moments before a killing.

Length of time and a general lack of planning doesn't preclude a finding of premeditation.

## Intended Killings: Premeditation {#slide-8}

State v. Guthrie  (WV 1995)

Facts :  After being subjected to heckling by the victim, the defendant grabbed a knife and stabbed the victim. The defendant had identifiable mental disorders and was particularly sensitive about his nose, which the victim flicked prior to the stabbing. Defendant testified to having a panic attack before killing.

Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life.

The jury was instructed with no meaningful distinction between first- and second-degree murders.

Issue :  Whether the trial court erred in its jury instruction on premeditation.

Holding :  The trial court erred. Premeditation requires  some  time to contemplate the decision to kill, though there isn't any set time.

There must be evidence indicating that the defendant weighed and considered his decision to kill.

## Harcourt Foreword: The Law of Homicide  {#slide-9}

Takeaways:

Foucault's approach to understanding discourse (applying the historical/ archaeological/ genealogical analysis to social practices and behaviors) can be used to understand premeditation and the different ways courts treat abnormal behavior with respect to whether or not the crime in question was consciously done

In Carroll, what role does sexuality play in the defense's argument? Any implicit or explicit assumptions those theories re their relationship are based on?

Same questions in Guthrie but from the perspective of mental health 

## Homicide: Voluntary Manslaughter {#slide-10}

Murder + provocation = voluntary manslaughter

Murder may be mitigated to "voluntary manslaughter" where there was a (1) "provocation" that (2) caused defendant to act in the "heat of passion."

Provocation is therefore an excuse or affirmative defense.

Why do we think that people who are "provoked" to kill are less culpable? 

Is it fairer to essentially pin some of the blame on the provoker? 

Do reasonable people react in this way, even to severe provocation?

If reasonable people don't, then does voluntary manslaughter culpability track this difference?

Two views on what is adequate provocation:

Girouard  represents the common law approach.

Maher  represents a minority view that some jurisdictions follow.

Casassa  represents the MPC approach---some states have adopted fully; others have revised it.

## Intended Killings: Provocation {#slide-11}

Girouard v. State  (Md. Ct. App. 1991)

Facts :  Defendant and his wife got into an argument. She told him she wanted a divorce and asked, "What are you going to do \[about it\]?" He grabbed a knife hidden behind a pillow and stabbed her 19(!) times.

Holding :  The victim did not provoke the defendant.

Words alone are inadequate to constitute provocation. 

Girouard couldn't have feared for bodily harm, because his was wife was much smaller than him.

Takeaway :  Words are sufficient only if the words are both:

(1) calculated to inflame the passion of a reasonable man and tend to cause him to act for the moment from passion rather than reason; and 

(2) accompanied by conduct indicating a present intention and ability to cause the defendant bodily harm.

## Intended Killings: Provocation {#slide-12}

Maher v. People  (Mich. 1862)

Facts :  Defendant suspected his wife of cheating on him. He followed her and the paramour and saw they disappeared into the woods. Defendant shot the paramour but didn't kill him. He was charged with assault with intent to murder.

Holding :  Evidence of provocation should've been admitted at the trial level.

It would've been within the jury's competence to find whether the conduct was committed as a result of provocation. 

Takeaway :  In a  Maher  jurisdiction, you don't need fear of bodily harm. Provocation is a jury question.

Per Harcourt, this is an arcane understanding of provocation motivated by patriarchal conceptions of a man's "right" to his woman. Look at the year this case was decided.

This view of provocation is the minority approach.

## Intended Killings: Provocation {#slide-13}

People v.  Casassa   (NY Ct. App. 1980)

Facts :  Defendant's girlfriend broke up with him, and he began stalking her. On the night of the killing, he broke into her home to offer her gifts. When she refused them, he stabbed her several times.

Statute :  Under NY law, it is an affirmative defense to second degree murder that the defendant acted under EED for which there is a reasonable explanation/excuse. 

Defendant's burden of proof

Holding :  Defendant's (E)ED does not have a reasonable explanation/excuse.

Subjective: Yes, the defendant was clearly emotionally distressed.

Objective( ish ): His emotional distress was not reasonably justified from the viewpoint of a person in the defendant's circumstances.
