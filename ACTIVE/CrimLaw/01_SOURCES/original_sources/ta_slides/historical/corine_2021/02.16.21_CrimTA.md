## Causation {#slide-2}

Problem:  Where a particular result is a necessary element of the crime charged, a problem can arise as to whether the defendant's act or culpable omission caused the result. 

Intervening cause questions. 

Burden:  The prosecutor must prove the causal link beyond a reasonable doubt. 

## Causation: Model Penal Code {#slide-3}

MPC § 2.03(1)

Conduct is the cause of a result when:

(1) it is an antecedent but for which the result in question would not have occurred;

(2) the relationship between the conduct and result satisfies any additional causal requirements imposed by the Code or by the law defining the offense.

The MPC automatically requires factual or "but for" cause.

Proximate cause comes into play according to the statute or jurisdiction.

Note

Issues of causation usually arise in (1) unintended killings or (2) intended killings that occur in an unintended manner.

## Causation: Unintended Homicide {#slide-4}

People v. Acosta  (Cal. Ct. App. 1991)

Facts :  Acosta led police officers on a 48-mile car chase after he was spotted in a stolen car. During the chase, Acosta ran stop signs and red lights and drove on the wrong side of streets, causing incoming traffic to scatter or swerve. While monitoring the chase, two police helicopters (one from Costa Mesa, one from Newport Beach) crashed, and three people in the Costa Mesa helicopter died. A retired FAA investigator testified that the pilots violated several FAA regulations. .

Issue :  Whether the deaths were foreseeable (and not highly extraordinary).

 

## Causation: Unintended Homicide {#slide-5}

People v. Acosta  (Cal. Ct. App. 1991)

Holding :   Acosta's conduct was the proximate cause of  the  deaths.

Reasoning :  But for Acosta's conduct of fleeing the police, the helicopters would never have been in a position to crash. The deaths were not highly extraordinary and reasonably might have been contemplated.

A foreseeability inquiry considers whether or not the result---here, death---was highly extraordinary.

Pretty low bar for foreseeability., honestly. 

 

## Causation: Unintended Homicide {#slide-6}

People v.  Arzon   (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1978)

Facts :  Defendant started a fire on the fifth floor of an abandoned building to keep warm, and firefighters responded to fight the fire. Meanwhile, another fire started independently on the second floor trapped the firefighters. Overcome by smoke from the first and second fires, one firefighter sustained life-taking injuries.

Holding :  Arzon's  arson caused the firefighter's death.

I don't actually know if he was charged with arson. Couldn't resist the pun.

 

## Causation: Unintended Homicide {#slide-7}

People v.  Arzon   (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1978)

Reasoning :  In all likelihood, the firefighter wouldn't have died had someone else not set the second-story fire. Nonetheless,  Arzon's  fire satisfies the "but-for" requirement.

If the defendant had not set the chain of events in motion, the firefighter would not have died. 

Moreover, the court can point to  Arzon's  conduct -- starting the fire -- as one component of the forces that caused the firefighter's death.

Takeaway :  Concurrent causation is fine.

 

## Why Do We Punish? {#slide-8}

Bernard Harcourt, "Post-Modern Meditations on Punishment"

Punishment is not "rational" but is culturally determined and biased

Even empirical studies import biases and social/cultural assumptions

Mass incarceration is a tool to maintain white (economic) supremacy

Solution: Randomization of sentencing

Michel Foucault, "Discipline and Punish"

Thesis: We no longer punish people for their acts, but for who they are

Critique on deterrence

Historical analysis of how prisons developed 

Transformation of petty crimes into moral wrongs: birth of the  penitentiary

Moralization of behavior keeps people from questioning the system

 

## Theories of Punishment:  Utilitarianism  {#slide-9}

Deterrence

Benefit of crime (to D)   \>  probability of  punishment  x  severity of  punishment

Ineffective deterrent

Benefit of crime   (to D)  \<  probability of  punishment  x  severity of  punishment

Effective deterrent

General deterrence : D's punishment is meant to deter the general community 

Specific deterrence : D's punishment is meant to deter specifically D's future misconduct 

Essentially forward-looking : looks to  consequences  of punishment

Jeremy Bentham : Punishment should only be used in order to "exclude some greater evil" 

Deterrence assumes the evil of  punishment and is  only valuable to the extent it produces some socially valuable result, i.e. less crime.

## Theories of Punishment:  Utilitarianism  {#slide-10}

Incapacitation

D's imprisonment physically prevents him from committing crime ( Zimring ;  Dilulio )  

Rehabilitation

D's punishment prevents crime by social conditioning and moral instruction

Militarization in punishment (Foucault); straightening of a crooked tree

Makes them safer for society upon reintegration

Vitiello : "\[M\]oral imperative to offer the offender a chance at  moral transformation"

## Is Rehabilitation really all that "moral?" {#slide-11}

## Theories of Punishment:  Retribution  {#slide-12}

Essentially "backward-looking" to D's past conduct 

Punishment is justified to the extent the criminal deserves it

- Lex talionis : "Eye for an eye"

Kant:  Crimes are  moral wrongs  because they violate  categorical imperatives  (the penal law)

Touchstone is  moral blameworthiness

Hegel : By committing a crime, the criminal authorizes/assumes  like  treatment to annul the crime 

But what sentence is equal to rape? Murder? Conspiracy?

Moore : Retribution is the view that punishment is justified by the moral culpability of those who receive it. 

Morris : Criminals violate the social contract, so it is fair to punish them.
