## Introduction to homicide {#slide-5}

Early common law

The killing of a human being by a human being 

(what's the problem here?)

Later common law

The killing of a human being by another human being

N.Y. Penal Law (2011)

Conduct which causes the death of a person under circumstances constituting murder, manslaughter in the first degree, manslaughter in the second degree, or criminally negligent homicide

## Introduction to homicide (cont'd) {#slide-6}

Common law definition of murder (Blackstone): the killing of a human being by another human being with malice aforethought

"Aforethought" has always been superfluous to the definition of murder in American law. Unless a statute modifies the common law by requiring proof of premeditation, a spur-of-the-moment killing may constitute murder

A person acts with "malice" (express or implied) if he has one of the four states of mind:

Intent to cause death

Intent to inflict serious bodily harm

Extreme recklessness and indifference to life

Felony-murder: during the course of a felony

## MPC § 2.10 {#slide-7}

Criminal Homicide

Purposely, knowingly, recklessly, or negligently causing the death of another human being -- either murder, manslaughter, or negligent homicide

Murder

Homicide committed purposely or knowingly (analog to intent)

Homicide committed recklessly under the circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life (analog to depraved heart)

Presumed if engaged in or an accomplice to a violent felony (robbery, forcible sex, arson, burglary, kidnapping, or escape) but rebuttable (analog to felony-murder rule)

Manslaughter

Homicide committed recklessly (but see above)

Homicide which would otherwise be murder, but which is committed under extreme mental or emotional disturbance for which there is a reasonable explanation or excuse

Reasonableness determined from the viewpoint of a person in the actor's situation under the circumstances as he believes them to be

Negligent Homicide

Homicide committed negligently

## MPC § 2.10 (cont'd) {#slide-8}

(1) human being: born and alive

The MPC distinguishes between homicide and feticide.

(3) serious bodily injury: substantial risk of death, permanent disfigurement, or protracted loss/impairment of the function of any body part/organ

(4) deadly weapon: firearm; or any other thing that is used or is intended to be used to cause death or serious bodily injury

Basically, no object is off the table as a deadly weapon so long as the intent is there.

## Foucault {#slide-9}

The norms of our culture are represented in criminal law

What constitutes provocation? The answers to this question reflect culture that is characterized by patriarchy and monogamy. 

These norms shape  and influence us. 

## Napoleonic Penal Code of 1810 {#slide-10}

Influential on the subsequent development of criminal codes

Value judgments

Among the "worst" types of homicide is patricide

Why is that? What does this say about society? What assumptions are baked in here?

## Commonwealth v. Carroll  (Pennsylvania 1963) {#slide-11}

Facts

Defendant shot his wife in the back of the head while they were lying in bed after an argument & disposed of body. She allegedly hurt their children, but it was seemingly due to a mental disorder. The gun had been placed in the bedroom for the wife's safety.

Procedural History

Carroll pleaded guilty to an indictment charging him with the murder of his wife. He was found guilty of first-degree murder ("willful, deliberate, and premeditated") and sentenced to life imprisonment.

Issue

(1) Does the evidence sustain a conviction higher than second-degree murder? (2) Should the evidence of defendant's good character and evidence that the homicide was not premeditated or intentional require the court to fix the degree of guilt no higher than second-degree murder?

Holding

This was clearly willful, deliberate, and premeditated murder. Judgment and sentence for first-degree murder affirmed.

Takeaway

Answers the question "What is premeditated?"

Premeditation can occur just in the moments before a killing.

Length of time and a general lack of planning doesn't preclude a finding of premeditation

## State v. Guthrie  (W.V. 1995) {#slide-12}

Facts

D pulled a knife from his pocket and stabbed his coworker in the neck. D and decedent were joking around during their work as dishwashers; decedent snapped defendant with a dishtowel several times. After decedent flipped D on the nose with the towel, D removed his gloves and stabbed decedent. D had many mental disorders, including an obsession with his nose. He also testified that he suffered a panic attack just before the stabbing.

Procedural History

Defendant was found guilty of first-degree murder ("willful, deliberate, and premeditated") and sentenced to life imprisonment. Jury instructions said premeditation means intent to kill & need exist "only for an instant."

Issue

Whether jury instructions on the premeditation component of murder are wrong and confusing because they suggest that the intention to kill does not need to exist for any length of time before the killing.

Holding

The instructions are wrong. Premeditation must include some time to contemplate the decision to kill. 

Takeaway

Shows a split in jurisdictions with  Carroll . In jurisdictions where premeditation must have actual reflection, think about what kind of evidence supports this finding. Here, look at "planning" behavior, motive (relationship?), manner of killing, etc.

There must be evidence indicating that the defendant weighed and considered his decision to kill.

## Intended killings --  voluntary manslaughter {#slide-13}

Murder + provocation = voluntary manslaughter

Why do we think that people who are "provoked" to kill are less culpable? 

Two views on what is adequate provocation:

Girouard  represents the common law approach

Maher  represents a minority view that some jurisdictions follow

Casassa  represents the MPC approach---some states have adopted fully, others have made revisions

## Heat of passion {#slide-14}

Murder may be  mitigated to "voluntary manslaughter" where there was a 

(1) "provocation" that (2) caused defendant to act in the "heat of passion." 

Provocation is therefore an excuse or affirmative defense.

## Girouard v. State  (Maryland 1991) {#slide-15}

Facts

Girouard and wife got into argument. Wife told Girouard she wanted a divorce and she had filed charges against him for abuse. She asked, "What are you going to do?" and Girouard took out a knife he had hidden behind pillow and stabbed her 19 times.

Holding

Here there was not adequate provocation to reduce murder to manslaughter because "words alone are not adequate provocation" and Girouard could not have reasonably feared bodily harm.

Rule

Words are regarded as sufficient provocation if they are both:

Calculated to inflame the passion of a reasonable man and tend to cause him to act for the moment from passion rather than reason

And accompanied by conduct indicating a present intention and ability to cause the defendant bodily harm.

Takeaway

Words alone are not adequate provocation.

## Maher v. People  (Michigan 1862) {#slide-16}

Facts

Maher suspected his wife was having an affair w/ Hunt, saw them disappear into the woods together. When they reappeared, Maher followed Hunt to a saloon and shot Hunt (but non-fatal wound). Maher was charged w/ assault w/ intent to commit murder.

Holding

Evidence of provocation should have been admitted here because it would have been "competent of a jury to find that the action was committed in consequence of the passion excited by the provocation."

Takeaway

Softens the "words alone are not enough" rule and holds that provocation is a jury question. (But recall this is minority view.)

## People v.  Casassa   (N.Y. Ct. App. 1980) {#slide-17}

Facts

Casassa's  girlfriend broke up with him and he stalked her. He brought her gifts and when she rejected them, he stabbed her several times in the throat.

Statute

NYPL based on MPC provides it is an affirmative defense to the crime of second-degree murder where D acted under extreme emotional distress for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse. Because this is affirmative defense in statute, burden of proof is on D.

Holding

Excuse of extreme emotional distress was not reasonable here.

Reasoning

First question is subjective: Was this particular defendant in some emotional distress? Answer is yes.

Second question is objective/subjective: Was the fact that he was in extreme emotional distress reasonably justifiable by looking at the situation from the defendant's viewpoint? Answer is no. This wasn't reasonable.
