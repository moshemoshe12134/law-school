## Felony murder {#slide-3}

Common law

Causing death in the course of perpetrating another felony. 

A strict liability offense in the sense that it doesn't require a distinct  mens  rea to kill; rather, the intent to commit felony substitutes for the  mens  rea that resulted in the death of victim. 

MPC § 210.2

The MPC doesn't have felony murder per se, but kind of includes it in the case of some crimes which create a presumption of recklessness. 

(1) Except as provided in Section 210.3(1)(b), criminal homicide constitutes murder when:

(a) it is committed purposely or knowingly; or

(b) it is committed  recklessly  under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life. Such recklessness and indifference are  presumed  if the actor is  engaged or is an accomplice in the commission  of, or an attempt to commit, or flight after committing or attempting to commit robbery, rape or deviate sexual intercourse by force or threat of force, arson, burglary, kidnapping or felonious escape.

## Felony murder (cont'd) {#slide-4}

Agency theory -- majority rule

Liability attaches when felon or felon's agents kill. 

Focus is on the actor. 

Proximate cause theory -- minority rule

Liability attaches for any death proximately resulting from the unlawful activity.

Most often applied in states that follow the "enumerated felonies that are inherently dangerous to life" approach to felony murder. 

i.e., foreseeable that death could result from felonies that involve weapon. 

## Regina v.  Serné  (1887) {#slide-5}

Facts

Leon  Serné  and his family were in severe debt, living in house above a store in London.  Serné  had taken out a life insurance policy on his son  Sjaak  (an imbecile), and insured store inventory, furniture, and rent. Within a month the store and house burned down and both his sons died. At trial, prosecution introduced evidence that  Serné  and Goldfinch had been seen together in the shop shortly before the fire started. It was alleged they willfully set fire and were indicted for  Sjaak's  murder.

Holding

Only an action taken with intent to commit a felony that is  known to create a danger  to human life can constitute felony-murder.

Takeaway

Felony-murder is homicide caused by an action that is (1) dangerous in and of itself, (2) likely to result in the death of another, and (3) taken by a defendant with the intent to commit a felony.

## People v. Stamp  (Cal. 1969) {#slide-6}

Facts

Defendant burglarized  Honeyman's  store, robbed him at gunpoint. After,  Honeyman  (60-year-old with history of heart disease) died of a heart attack. Doctors testified that the fright from the robbery was too much of a shock to  Honeyman's  system.

Holding

First-degree murder conviction is upheld.

Felony-murder doctrine not limited to foreseeable deaths; a felon is instead held strictly liable for all killings committed by him / his accomplices in the course of the felony.

As long as the homicide is the direct causal result of the robbery the felony-murder rule applies whether or not the death was a natural / probable consequence of the robbery.

The robber takes his victim as he finds him.

## State v. Canola  (N.J. 1977) {#slide-7}

Facts

Jewelry store owner resisted an attempted armed robbery by defendant (Canola) and his accomplices. One accomplice and the store owner exchanged gunfire, both died. Defendant and two accomplices indicted on one count of robbery and two counts of murder (store owner and co-felon). Defendant found guilty on both murder counts and sentenced to two concurrent terms of life imprisonment.

Issue

Under NJ law, can a defendant be found guilty of felony-murder when during his robbery of a store one of the robbery victims shoots one of the defendant's accomplices?

Holding

No, under NJ law, a defendant cannot be found guilty of the killing of an accomplice by the armed robbery victim

Takeaway

Felony-murder requires that the murder occur in furtherance of the felony

## Unintended killing {#slide-8}

Accused does not intend to kill her victim, but malice is implied because the defendant's conduct demonstrates extreme recklessness or indifference to human life.

Under the MPC, what is known as depraved heart murder at common law is collapsed under what the MPC  defines as "reckless murder," which requires a  mens  rea of recklessness. 

## Commonwealth v. Malone  (Penn. 1946) -- extreme recklessness {#slide-9}

Facts

A 17-year-old killed his 13-year-old friend while playing Russian Roulette.

Rule

When an individual commits an act of gross recklessness for which he must reasonably anticipate that death to another is likely to result, he exhibits that "wickedness of disposition, hardness of heart, cruelty, recklessness of consequences, and a mind regardless of social duty" which proves that malice was present.

Issue

Did defendant's actions constitute malice?

Holding

Yes

Malice here is evidenced by defendant's "doing of an uncalled-for act in callous disregard of its likely harmful effects on others." (Statistical consequences -- 20% vs. 60%?)

Lack of motive is not dispositive.

Takeaway

Example of "depraved heart" at common law

This is later folded into recklessness

## Commonwealth v.  Welansky   (Mass. 1944) -- recklessness {#slide-10}

Facts

Defendant, owner of a night club in Boston, was charged with involuntary manslaughter for the death of hundreds of patrons at his club as a result of a fire. As owner of club, defendant had a legal duty to his invitees to use reasonable care in keeping the premises safe for their use and preventing (un)known dangers.

Statute

Involuntary manslaughter requires wanton or reckless conduct.

Holding

Proper conviction of involuntary manslaughter. 

(1) He was aware that venue was not in compliance w/ local safety regulation; and 

(2) He knew that construction plans for new part of lounge precluded the possibility of installing the doors necessary to comply w/ safety regulations.

Takeaway

Wanton / reckless conduct = intentional conduct, by commission or omission, that has a high likelihood of substantial harm

Negligence is not enough

## People v. Hall  (Colo. 2000) -- reckless {#slide-11}

Facts

While skiing, defendant collided with victim who was on the slope below. Victim died as a result. Defendant was charged with reckless manslaughter.

Statute

Reckless manslaughter requires that a person "recklessly cause the death of another person."

Conduct is reckless when the actor consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that death may result. MPC § 2.02.

Issue

What's a substantial and unjustifiable risk?

Holding

A risk of death that has less than a 50% chance of occurring can still be substantial. 

Here, it was a substantial risk given how reckless D was being.

Takeaway

Substantial risk is one that a reasonably prudent person would identify 

## State v. Williams  (Wash. Ct. App. 1971) -- negligence {#slide-12}

Facts

Native American mother and stepfather of baby were convicted of manslaughter for negligently failing to take their baby to a doctor when he had an abscessed tooth that became infected and developed gangrene .

Statute

In Washington, involuntary manslaughter is committed if the death of the victim is the proximate result of simple/ordinary/civil negligence .

Holding

The failure so to do in this case is ordinary or simple negligence, and such negligence is sufficient to support a conviction of statutory manslaughter .

D efendant  was sufficiently put on notice concerning the symptoms of the baby's illness and lack of improvement in the baby's apparent condition in the period from September 1 to September 5, 1968 to have required them to have obtained medical care for the child .

Here, it was a substantial risk given how reckless defendant was being.

Takeaway

Ordinary  (civil) negligence  resulting in death = involuntary manslaughter 

Statute later changed to require criminal negligence

## Kant, Metaphysics of Morals {#slide-13}

Theory of punishment -- retribution

looks to defendant's conduct; punishment is justified because defendant deserves it, is blameworthy.

Akin to "an eye for an eye"

Crimes are wrongs because they violate categorical imperatives (penal law)

Criticism of Utilitarianism

Can't treat people as goods

Theoretically, an innocent man's conviction might be "good" for overall maximum utility
