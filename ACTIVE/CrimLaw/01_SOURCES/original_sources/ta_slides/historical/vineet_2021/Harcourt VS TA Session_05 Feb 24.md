## Gregg v. Georgia  (1976) {#slide-3}

Facts

Gregg convicted of death-eligible homicides. The jury imposed the death penalty pursuant to statutory guidelines.

Issue

Whether the death sentence of murder is a per se violation of the Eight (cruel and unusual punishment) and Fourteenth (equal protection/due process) Amendment.

Holding

The Georgia  statutory system  under which Gregg was sentenced to death does not violate the Constitution.

Under Furman, the imposition of the death penalty cannot be arbitrary or capricious.

Here, we have a carefully drafted statute that ensures the sentencing authority has enough information and guidance.

Georgia's statute (described on pp. 570--572) is adequately particularized to the defendant's circumstances

Takeaway

"\[T\]he concerns expressed in  Furman  that the penalty of death not be imposed in an arbitrary or capricious manner can be met by a carefully drafted statute that ensures that the sentencing authority is given adequate information and guidance."

Furman  concerns allayed by carefully drafted statute that gives sentencing authority adequate information and guidance 

## Post- Gregg  death penalty statutes {#slide-4}

Pyramid

need to have all elements below to reach death sentence

Weighing

aggravating and mitigating circumstances, weigh them (can't be a consideration of the number of circumstances)

Special questions

(TX), adds a 4th question that essentially includes weighing mitigating circumstances

## Atkins v. Virginia  (2002) {#slide-5}

Facts

Atkins was convicted of a death-eligible murder. An expert witness testified that he was "mildly mentally retarded." Evidence showed he had an IQ of only 59. Atkins was sentenced to death.

Issue

Whether the Eighth Amendment prohibits death sentences for mentally retarded \[intellectually handicapped / disabled\] defendants.

Holding

Yes, it is a cruel and unusual punishment.

It is consensus that intellectually handicapped people are less culpable for their conduct than those with "normal" intellectual capacities. Administering like punishment for unequal culpability offends retributive notions.

They are also less deterred because of their lesser ability to process information, control impulses, etc., which offends notions of deterrence.

They are also less capable of providing meaningful assistance to counsel to defend their cases.

Takeaway

Intellectually handicapped individuals cannot be sentenced to death. 

Death doesn't serve purpose of punishment, can't show mitigation, higher risk of wrongful execution  

## Steiker ,  Sober Second Thoughts {#slide-6}

The death penalty is inherently unfair because the guidelines are not objective.

The Court backtracked after  Furman , where it looked like the death penalty was on its way out.

Invalidated 39 states' capital statutes.

Gregg  essentially rubber-stamped 35 states' reworded statutes.

Death penalty is not per se cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment.

Court is now in the business of determining which states' capital punishment schemes are constitutionally acceptable.

Applauds "clear and objective standards"

But there aren't enough guidelines. Whatever guidelines/standards there are, aren't adequately objective.

## Steiker ,  Sober Second Thoughts  (cont'd) {#slide-7}

Narrowing hasn't worked.

Study showed that 86% of murder convicts over 5-year period were death-eligible.

Courts have been hesitant to narrow death-eligible cases on grounds that death is disproportionate to the crime committed

Gregg  invoked need for heightened reliability, but procedural protections aren't adequately robust.

Ineffective assistance of counsel receives no special review compared to crime involving a far lesser sentence.

Court-appointed capital lawyers are notoriously bad ( cf.  Bright).

Discusses the "hegemony" of (capital) punishment

Idea that current modes of punishment are unassailable features of criminal justice.

We can't divorce imprisonment, fines, death sentences, probation, etc. from our conceptions of criminal justice.

## Interlude {#slide-8}

Why did Harcourt make us read these articles?

Society often thinks of the criminal law as upholding moral values more so than other areas of the law. We often think of murder, rape, etc. as offending some moral sense of inherent or God-given human dignity (Kant). It's an area of the law where law students have built-in conceptions of right and wrong, more so than when we first studied the merits of the Statute of Frauds.

But modern criminal law is still very much rooted in a tradition dominated by the elite White men that wrote the MPC. The contours of the criminal law are no differently established than the UCC or Restatement of Torts. The MPC, the UCC, and the Restatement all just showed best practices within their respective areas of the law. They made no claim as to what was formalistically right or good.

So why do we emphasize the need for the criminal law to uphold some sense justice external to the criminal law itself and how do we justify our intuitions of what the criminal law should be? 

That's where law & economics and critical theory come in. They fill in the gaps left by a purely procedural or "reasonable" understanding of the law.

## Capital punishment {#slide-9}

Stats

Before Trump, there were 3  federal  executions since 1988

2003--2020, 0 executions

2019 Gallup poll -- 60% of Americans support life in prison over death penalty for first time since 1990 (beginning of poll)

2020--2021, 13 executions

35 states have the death penalty

As of Jan. 2016, approx. 2,943 people were on death row

1/3 of those have no prior felony convictions
