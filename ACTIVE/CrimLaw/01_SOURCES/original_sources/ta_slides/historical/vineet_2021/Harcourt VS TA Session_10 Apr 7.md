Insanity

Attempt

## Insanity {#slide-3}

MPC § 4.01

(1) A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct as a result of mental disease or defect he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality/wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law. 

(2) "mental disease or defect" does not include an abnormality manifested only by repeated criminal or otherwise anti-social conduct

 Burden of proof

75% of states place the burden on the defendant (preponderance of evidence)

Florida and the U.S. require clear and convincing evidence

## M'Naghten's  Case {#slide-4}

This is the old rule:

It must be clearly proved that, at the time of the committing of the act, that the defendant suffered from a mental disease which makes him unable to know the nature and quality of the criminal conduct or the wrongfulness of the act.

Takeaway:

Insanity comes into play if the defendant doesn't know nature and quality of what they're doing or doesn't know what they're doing is wrong 

Cognition rule -- did defendant know what they did was wrong?

## Yates v. State  (Tex. Ct. App. 2005) {#slide-5}

Facts

Defendant drowned her 5 children, trying to "save them from Satan." There was evidence of severe depression and attempted suicide. She received psychiatric help, to whom she told about visions and voices. Yates also suffered from catatonia (physical/behavioral symptoms associated with schizophrenia). Jury rejected her insanity defense.

Holding

Reversed -- the lone expert testimony stating she may have gotten the story from Law & Order was false.

Takeaway

This case shows the potential for injustice in a criminal trial that turns on a battle of the experts. 

This also illustrates how unpredictably a jury will find on an insanity defense. 

## Blake v. US  (5th Cir. 1969) {#slide-6}

Facts

Defendant was convicted of bank robbery. He presented evidence showing that he required psychiatric treatment for at least 20 years. Expert testimony said he was schizophrenic, which often manifested in psychotic episodes. Blake was also a heavy drinker and drug user. 

Issue

Whether the jury instruction should have used the MPC standard or  Davis .

Davis  -- cognition + volitional

Holding

The lower court should have used a "substantial capacity" standard like in the MPC.

Reasoning

We know that Blake suffered some mental illness under modern understandings, but  Davis  is too prohibitive/narrow.

Davis  would disallow the defense whenever a person was not unconscious, incapable of distinguishing right and wrong, nor completely robbed of his free will.

Takeaway

Insanity defense is available if the defendant lacks capacity to appreciate wrongfulness or to conform to requirements of law

## US v. Lyons  (5 th  Cir. 1984) ( en  banc) {#slide-7}

Facts

Defendant was convicted of several drug crimes, which required  mens   reas  of "knowingly and intentionally." Lyons wanted to admit evidence pointing to his insanity, but the trial court excluded it. 

Holding

Court should've admitted evidence of brain and psychological damage.

Takeaway

A person is not responsible for criminal conduct on the grounds of insanity only if at the time of that conduct, as a result of a mental disease or defect, he is unable to appreciate the wrongfulness of that conduct.

A general shift away from the MPC approach

## Kahler v. Kansas  (2020) {#slide-8}

Facts

Defendant was charged with murdering 4 members of his family. The defense argued insanity via depression and OCD. Kahler received psychiatric help and was on medication. Expert testimony on both sides corroborated the insanity defense. The jury convicted and recommended death. 

Statute

Under KS law, a jury can only consider mental disease or defect as a defense insofar as it shows that the defendant lacked the  mens  rea required as an element to the crime. 

Mental disease or defect is otherwise unavailable for an insanity defense.

Issue

Whether Kansas' insanity defense (which abrogates the  M'Naghten  rule of moral cognition) violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments

Holding

No. Due process doesn't require states adopt an insanity defense that turns on a defendant's ability to recognize the moral wrongfulness of the criminal conduct. 

Reasoning

Mens  rea is always a requirement, and there remains a defense of being mentally incapable of forming the requisite  mens  rea.

Thus, there functionally remains an insanity-like defense.

SCOTUS won't adopt one version of the insanity defense over others; the states can choose.

## Attempt -- MPC § 5.01 {#slide-9}

(1) A person is guilty of attempt if, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for commission of the crime, he:

(a) purposely engages in conduct which would constitute the crime if the attendant circumstances were as he believes them to be;

(b) when causing a particular result is an element of the crime, does or omits to do anything with the purpose of causing or with the belief that it will cause such result without further conduct on his part; OR

(c) purposely does or omits to do anything which, under the circumstances as he believes them to be, is an act or omission constituting a  substantial step  in a course of conduct planned to culminate in his commission of the crime.

## Attempt -- MPC § 5.01 (cont'd) {#slide-10}

(2) Substantial step under (1)(c) requires "strongly corroborative of the actor's criminal purpose." The following may prove a substantial step:

(a) lying in waiting, searching for, or following the contemplated victim

(b) enticing or seeking to entice the contemplated victim of the crime to go to the place contemplated for its commission

(c) reconnoitering the place contemplated for the commission of the crime

(d) possession of materials to be used for committing the crime, which are specially designed for such use or which serve no lawful purpose under the circumstances

(e) possession, collection, or fabrication of materials to be used in the crime, at or near contemplated place of crime, where such possession, collection, or fabrication serves no lawful purpose under the circumstances

(f) soliciting an innocent agent to engage in conduct constituting an element of crime

## Attempt -- MPC § 5.01 (cont'd) {#slide-11}

(3) Engaging in conduct that would render you complicit under MPC § 2.06 if the crime were committed, is guilty of attempt, even though the crime is not committed or attempted by the principal criminal actor.

(4) It is an affirmative defense that the actor abandoned the criminal effort or otherwise prevented its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose. This defense doesn't affect the liability of an accomplice who didn't join in abandonment or prevention.

## Smallwood v. State  (Md. Ct. App. 1996) {#slide-12}

Facts

Smallwood was convicted of assault with intent to murder three rape victims. Evidence showed he knew about the dangers of HIV contraction and raped his victims nonetheless. The prosecution analogized the defendant carrying HIV to carrying a deadly weapon and deploying it through unprotected sex.

Holding

No intent to kill. 

Reasoning

The risk of death by AIDS is too far removed, relative to firing a gun at the head of a victim, as in  Raines . You need more evidence.

Actively conceal HIV-positive status and refuse request to wear condom ( Hinkhouse )

Jabbing with a syringe, shouting "I'll give you AIDS." ( Caine )

Takeaway

To convict only on the risk of death, death must be the natural and probable result of the act. Otherwise, you need specific intent to kill (intent must be evident in act)

## People v. Rizzo  (N.Y. 1927) {#slide-13}

Facts

Defendant was with a group planning to rob Charles Rao while on his way to cash his paycheck. Rizzo and the crew drove around looking for their target, but they never found him. Police arrested them before they could rob Rao. 

Issue

Whether the steps taken by the defendant constitute attempt to commit robbery 

Holding

This is not attempt to commit robbery, merely preparation.

Reasoning

The law doesn't recognize mere preparation tending towards the commission of a crime.

The acts tending towards the commission of a crime must be so near to its accomplishment that in all reasonable probability the crime itself would've been committed, but for timely interference.

There must be dangerous proximity to success ( Hyde ).

Takeaway

Defendant friendly, need something more than mere preparation?

## McQuirter v. State  (Ala. Ct. App. 1953) {#slide-14}

Facts

Norman was badly abused during 25-year marriage. She shot her husband while he was asleep and was charged with first-degree murder. At trial, she presented evidence of suffering from battered wife syndrome as proof of a perfect self-defense. Jury convicted of voluntary manslaughter. Norman was sentenced to six years in prison. 

Holding

There was sufficient evidence to submit to the jury the question of the defendant's guilt.

Reasoning

Intent is a jury question to be adduced at trial. 

You can admit inferential evidence to determine the defendant's intent.

Takeaway

The jury may consider social conditions and customs founded on racial differences.
