## Complicity:  Model Penal Code {#slide-3}

MPC § 2.06

(1) A person is guilty of an offense if, it is committed by his own conduct or by the conduct of another person for which he is legally accountable, or both.

(2) A person is legally accountable for the conduct of another person when:

(a) acting with the requisite mens rea for the offense, he causes an innocent or irresponsible person to engage in such conduct; OR

(b) he is made accountable for the conduct of such other person by the Code or the law defining the offense; OR

(c) he is an accomplice of such other person in the commission of the offense.

## Complicity:  Model Penal Code {#slide-4}

MPC § 2.06

(3) A person is an accomplice if:

(a) with the purpose of promoting or facilitating the commission of the offense, he:

( i ) solicits such other person to commit it; OR

(ii) aids, or agrees or attempts to aid such other person in planning or committing it; OR

(iii) having a legal duty to prevent the commission of the offense, fails to make proper effort so to do; OR

(b) his conduct is expressly declared by law to establish his complicity

## Complicity:  Model Penal Code {#slide-5}

Comment to MPC § 2.06 

There is deliberate ambiguity as to whether the purpose requirement extends to circumstance elements of the contemplated offense or whether, as in the case of attempts, the policy of the substantive offense on this point should control. The result, therefore, is that the actor must have a purpose with respect to the proscribed conduct, with his attitude towards the circumstances to be left to resolution by the courts.

## Complicity:  Model Penal Code {#slide-6}

Comment to MPC § 2.06(3)(a)

Subsection (3)(a) requires that the actor have the purpose of promoting or facilitating the commission of the offense. . . . This does not mean, of course, that the precise means used in the commission of the crime must have been fixed or contemplated or, when they have been, that liability is limited to their employment. One who solicits an end, or aids or agrees to aid in its achievement, is an accomplice in whatever means may be employed, insofar as  they constitute an offense fairly envisaged in the purposes of the association . But when a wholly different crime has been committed, thus involving conduct  not within the conscious objectives of the accomplice , he is  not  liable for it. . . . \[I\]t is submitted that the liability of an accomplice ought not to be extended beyond the purposes that he shares. Probabilities have an important evidential bearing on these issues; to make them independently sufficient is to predicate the liability on negligence when, for good reason, more is normally required before liability is found.

## Complicity :  Model Penal Code {#slide-7}

MPC § 2.06

(4) If causing a result is an element of the offense, an accomplice to that crime is guilty if he acts with the requisite mens rea, if any, with respect to that result that is sufficient for the commission of the offense.

(5) A person who is legally incapable of committing a particular offense may be guilty if it is committed by the conduct of another for which he is legally accountable, unless such liability is inconsistent with the purpose of the provision establishing incapacity.

## Complicity:  Model Penal Code {#slide-8}

MPC § 2.06

(6) A person is NOT an accomplice if :

(a) he is a victim of the offense; OR

(b) the offense is so defined that his conduct is inevitably incident to its commission; OR

(c) he terminates his complicity prior to the commission of the offense and

( i ) wholly deprives it of effectiveness in the commission of the offense; OR

(ii) gives timely warning to law enforcement or otherwise makes proper effort to prevent the commission of the offense

(7) Accomplice liability is available independent of the actual liability of the principal. 

## Complicity:  Cases {#slide-9}

State v. Gladstone  (Wash. 1970)

Facts :  Defendants were all students. Police hired Thompson as an informant to buy pot from Gladstone, but he didn't have any. Gladstone gave him Kent's information. No evidence of communication between Gladstone and Kent concerning the sale of pot.

Holding :  A defendant can't be guilty of aiding and abetting where there is no connection/association with the principal to accomplish the crime.

Gladstone may have helped Thompson purchase weed, but he didn't help Kent sell it.

You need some sort of association with the venture, participation in the conduct, and intent for the criminal conduct to succeed.

Mere communication to the effect that someone might commit a crime is insufficient.

## Complicity:  Cases {#slide-10}

State v.  McVay   (R.I. 1926)

Facts :  Kelley instructed Captain  McVay  and an engineer of a passenger ship to depart. The boiler exploded, killing three.  McVay  and Grant were indicted as principals for manslaughter. Kelley was indicted as an accessory before the fact.

Holding :  The indictment against Kelley can stand.

Kelley need not have intended the result of death, only that he intentionally directed and counseled the grossly negligence act, which the indictment charges resulted in the crime.

Takeaway :  The mens rea required for accessory in a result-based crime is only the intent to act, not the intent to cause the result.

Kelley was charged with counseling and procuring the principals to disregard their duties and negligently create steam.

## Complicity:  Cases {#slide-11}

Commonwealth v. Roebuck  (Pa. 2011)

Facts :  Defendants participated in luring the victim into an apartment complex, where the victim was ambushed and fatally shot. Roebuck didn't shoot. He was convicted as an accomplice to third-degree murder. Roebuck argued that intending to aid an unintentional act is logically impossible.

Holding :  Conviction stands; accomplice liability doesn't require that the defendant had the conscious objective to help cause a particular result. 

The defendant only needs to intend to aid the conduct, which unfortunately, results in death.

With respect to the result (death), the defendant still needs to be reckless (or whatever other mens rea).

## Complicity:  Cases {#slide-12}

People v.  Luparello   (Cal. Ct. App. 1987)

Facts :  Defendant was distraught after his ex left and married another. He thought he could discover her whereabouts from Martin.  Luparello  called on his friends to find Martin and get info about her whereabouts at any cost. Friends visited Martin, who wouldn't say anything. The next night, the friends ambushed Martin and killed him. Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder on a theory of accomplice liability.

Holding :  A person can be liable for the unplanned and unintended acts of co-conspirators that are the natural, probable, and foreseeable consequences of his assistance.

Similar to the proximate cause inquiry (reasonably foreseeable).

The fact that the accomplice or co-conspirator intended to facilitate some less serious criminal act doesn't render the foreseeable consequence doctrine inapplicable.

## Conspiracy -- MPC § 5.03 {#slide-13}

(1) A person is guilty of conspiracy with another person or persons to commit a crime if with the purpose of promoting or facilitating its commission he:

(a) agrees with such other person or persons that they or one or more of them will engage in conduct which constitutes such crime or an attempt or solicitation to commit such crime; OR

(b) agrees to aid such other person or persons in the planning or commission of such crime or of an attempt or solicitation to commit such crime.

## Conspiracy -- MPC § 5.03 (cont'd) {#slide-14}

(2) If a person guilty of conspiracy, as defined by (1), knows that a person with whom he conspires to commit a crime has conspired with another person or persons to commit the same crime, he is guilty of conspiring with such other person or persons, whether or not he knows their identity, to commit such crime.

(3) If a person conspires to commit a number of crimes, he is guilty of only one conspiracy so long as such multiple crimes are the object of the same agreement or continuous conspiratorial relationship.

(5) No person may be convicted of conspiracy to commit a crime, other than a felony of the first or second degree, unless an overt act in pursuance of such conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by him or by a person with whom he conspired.

(6) It is an affirmative defense that the actor, after conspiring to commit a crime, thwarted the success of the conspiracy, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.

## Conspiracy -- MPC § 5.03 (cont'd) {#slide-15}

(7) Duration of the conspiracy

(a) conspiracy is a continuing course of conduct which terminates when the crime or crimes which are its object are committed or the agreement that they be committed is abandoned by the defendant and by those with whom he conspired; AND

(b) such abandonment is presumed if neither the defendant nor anyone with whom he conspired does any overt act in pursuance of the conspiracy during the applicable period of limitation; AND

(c) if an individual abandons the agreement, the conspiracy is terminated as to him only if and when he advises those with whom he conspired of his abandonment or he informs the law enforcement authorities of the existence of the conspiracy and of his participation therein.

## Krulewitch  v. US  (1949) {#slide-16}

Rule

A conspiracy is considered so vagrant as to have been committed in any district where any one of the conspirators did any of the acts, however, innocent, intended to accomplish its object.

Once the trial begins, the defendant is bombarded with evidence of acts of others he may not have authorized, intended, or known about, all of which is admissible to the existence of a conspiracy.

If the defendant is silent, he is taken to admit the conspiracy and if co-defendants turn on each other, they convict each other.

Takeaway

Conspiracy cases provide the prosecution with leverage - confusing judges and defendants, and allowing the prosecution to stage trials in remote locations in which a single conspirator performed an act alleged to further the conspiracy 

## Interstate Circuit v. US  (1939) {#slide-17}

Facts

 Two movie theaters entered into an agreement to fix prices with each of eight film distributors. The contracts were individual to each distributor. There was no evidence of any agreement between distributors.

Holding

There was a conspiracy among all eight film distributors.

Takeaway

The court can infer an agreement based on the circumstances. 

## People v.  Lauria   (Cal. Dist. Ct. App. 1967) {#slide-18}

Facts

Lauria  operated a telephone answering services for prostitutes to be connected with clients. Law enforcement was investigating the prostitutes and also went for the telephone service. Defendant knew some of his customers were prostitutes. Prosecutors wanted to prove knowledge of the prostitution.

Holding

Lauria  is not guilty of conspiracy because his knowledge/involvement didn't rise to the level of intent to participate in a criminal conspiracy.

## People v.  Lauria   (Cal. Dist. Ct. App. 1967) (cont'd) {#slide-19}

Reasoning

We do not believe an inference of intent drawn from knowledge of criminal use properly applies to the less serious crimes classified as misdemeanors.

Positive knowledge of the supplier that his products or services are being used for criminal purposes does not alone establish an intent of the supplier to participate in the misdemeanors.

Takeaway

Mere knowledge is not enough to find conspiracy

Factors to consider as to whether goods may be used illegally

"1. Intent may be inferred from knowledge, when the purveyor of legal goods for illegal use has acquired a stake in the venture."

2. Intent may be inferred from knowledge, when no legitimate use for the goods or services exists."

3. Intent may be inferred from knowledge, when the volume of business with the buyer is grossly disproportionate to any legitimate demand, or when sales for illegal use amount to a high proportion of the seller's total business."

## Pinkerton v. US  (1946) {#slide-20}

Facts

Pinkerton brothers live on a farm. They were indicted for tax-related violations. The indictment contains 10 substantive counts and 1 conspiracy count.

Holding

There was enough evidence to submit to the jury the question of Daniel's participation in the conspiracy.

Reasoning

You don't need direct evidence of participation in the criminal conduct, as long as there's a continuous conspiracy. 

Acts of one conspirator may be attributed to the act of all.

Pinkerton Rule

You are liable for the substantive offense committed by a co-conspirator if:

The act was in furtherance of the conspiracy;

The act was within the scope of the unlawful project; AND

The act was foreseeable as a necessary and natural consequence of the agreement

## State v. Bridges  (N.J. 1993) {#slide-21}

Facts

Defendant got into an argument with a party guest. He left to recruit two friends to help him fight the guy. They picked up guns on the way. At the party, Bridges got into a fight. A friend was struck in the tussle, and the friends began firing into the crowd, killing someone.

Issue

Can Bridges can be guilty of accessory to murder due to his involvement in the conspiracy?

Holding

Yes -- A co-conspirator is liable for the commission of substantive criminal acts that aren't within the scope of the conspiracy if they are reasonably foreseeable as the necessary or natural consequences of the conspiracy.

Takeaway

A co-conspirator can be held liable for criminal acts not within scope of conspiracy but which are reasonably foreseeable

## US v. Alvarez  (11 th  Cir. 1985) {#slide-22}

Facts

Undercover agents were in a motel room posing as buyers of a large quantity of cocaine. A shoot-out ensued, and one agent was killed. All the dealers were convicted of drug-related conspiracy. Three defendants were convicted of second-degree murder based on Pinkerton liability.

Holding

Although the murder convictions of the three appellants may represent an unprecedented application of Pinkerton, such an application is not improper.

Reasoning

There is sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that the murder was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the drug conspiracy.

Takeaway

Further emphasizes  Bridges  and  Pinkerton

Pinkerton  liability can get you far

## Conclusion {#slide-23}

What is justice?

The courts in Clarissa and Wyatt reversed the convictions of two slaves, which seems progressive for that time and place. But are those cases "wins" for justice?

Should the criminal law confront issues of race, gender, class, etc.? 

If the criminal law is a proper vehicle for social justice, how could it best address larger social issues that lead to mass, disproportionate incarceration?

Reading cases in class, we have the benefit of hindsight. How do we sift through the unjust decisions from the just ones in real-time?

Do your intuitions of justice remain true to the legal doctrines and theories that animate the criminal law?
