Michael Brown

Grand jury didn't indict Officer Wilson in the shooting death of Michael Brown

In New York, almost all felony indictments result from a grand jury process

New York grand juries are tasked with the decision of whether there is sufficient evidence---probable cause---to charge a person of a crime

## Law enforcement  use of lethal force (cont'd) {#slide-5}

Saheed   Vessell

Brooklyn resident with bipolar/trauma, known to local police, neighborhood. Quirky/erratic, but never violent. Episode one day where he used a silver pipe to point at people like gun (same image from our session last week.) Some people called cops. Non-local cops showed up. None had fired shots before. Took them 5-10 seconds after they pulled up to shoot him -- total 10 shots between 3 officers. 

NYPL § 35.30(1)

A police officer or a peace officer, in the course of effecting or attempting to effect an arrest, or of preventing or attempting to prevent the escape from custody, of a person whom he or she reasonably believes to have committed an offense, may use physical force when and to the extent he or she reasonably believes such to be necessary to effect the arrest, or to prevent the escape from custody, or in self-defense or to defend a third person from what he or she reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of physical force; except that deadly physical force may be used for such purposes only when he or she reasonably believes that:

(a) The offense committed by such person was:

( i ) a felony or an attempt to commit a felony involving the use or attempted use or threatened imminent use of physical force against a person; or

(ii) kidnapping, arson, escape in the first degree, burglary in the first degree or any attempt to commit such a crime; or

(b) The offense committed or attempted by such person was a felony and that, in the course of resisting arrest therefor or attempting to escape from custody, such person is armed with a firearm or deadly weapon; or

(c) Regardless of the particular offense which is the subject of the arrest or attempted escape, the use of deadly physical force is necessary to defend the police officer or peace officer or another person from what the officer reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of deadly physical force.

## Intro:  Regina v. Dudley and Stephens {#slide-6}

Facts

Sailors were shipwrecked out at sea, 1,600 miles from the Cape of Good Hope. A handful of crewmembers and the captain were stranded on a smaller boat. Dudley and Stephens killed a boy for food, to the captain's and the boy's dissent. The seamen were later saved.

Issue

Is the killing of one stranded seaman to save the others a killing of necessity, such that the killing is justified?

Holding

No necessity defense is available to preserve your own life.

"Absolute divorce of law from morality would be of fatal consequence"

"It is not correct, to say that there is any absolute or unqualified necessity to preserve one's life"

Reasoning

While self-defense is a form of necessity, the "temptation" of starvation while adrift, while clearly dire, is not enough to make a deliberate and willful killing lawful. In that case, a court should not say it is a man's duty to take another life in order to sustain his own, but to sacrifice himself. 

The court questions the practicality or moral standard of such a rule: If everyone is weak and dying, as happened in this case, who is to be killed and who is the killer? Who should decide?

This feels clearly retributive. There's no indication they'd ever do this again, and this doesn't represent deterrence. But it was also a test case, so perhaps there's some ex ante utilitarianism in there somewhere.

Takeaway

Choice of evils must be between two crimes. 

## Necessity {#slide-7}

Necessity is a justification

Defendant violated a criminal prohibition, but considering the circumstances, it was good that he did, because doing so was the lesser evil

Common law

A threat of imminent injury to the person or property,

What's imminent? 

Traditionally natural causes like a blizzard

No (reasonable) alternatives except the commission of the crime,

An objective standard independent of the defendant's beliefs

The defendant's otherwise criminal conduct would prevent an equal or more serious harm, AND

Choice of evils: Use the same or less harm/evil/force or suffer the threat of injury

The defendant hasn't created the conditions of his own dilemma.

For example, the defendant couldn't have provoked the incoming harm.

## Necessity (cont'd) {#slide-8}

MPC § 3.02

(1) Conduct which the actor believes to be necessary to avoid a harm or evil to himself or to another is justifiable, provided that:

(a) the harm or evil sought to be avoided is greater than that sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense charged;

(b) neither the Code nor other law defining the offense provides exceptions or defenses dealing with the specific situation involved; AND

(c) a legislative purpose to exclude the justification claimed does not plainly appear

(2) When the actor was reckless or negligent in bringing about the situation requiring a choice of harms or evils, the necessity defense is unavailable for conduct involving the   mens  rea  of recklessness or negligence. 

## People v. Unger  (Ill. 1977) {#slide-9}

Facts

Defendant was an inmate a state prison who was subjected to threats of sexual violence and actual sexual violence. Defendant sought help but escaped after he received death threats. He claimed that he planned to return once he could find help.

Holding

Unger is entitled to raise the necessity defense for jury consideration.

Reasoning

This isn't about duress, which requires deprivation of free will.  Lovercamp  factors for prison escape are instructive, but not controlling. Prisoners are entitled to the same necessity defense as free folk. 

Specific, immediate threat of death, forcible sexual attack, or substantial bodily harm

No time for a complaint to authorities or a history of futile complaints

No time to resort to courts

No evidence of force or violence towards prison staff or other innocent people in the escape

Prisoner immediately reports to the proper authorities when he is a safe place 

Takeaway

When a defendant reasonably believes that an offense is justifiable because he would escape greater injury, he is entitled to a defense of necessity. While the  Lovercamp  factors are relevant to deciding whether a defense of necessity is proper for an escaped prisoner, they are not controlling, and the prisoner is allowed the same defense under the statute as anyone else.

## U.S. v. Schoon  (9 th  Cir. 1992) {#slide-10}

Facts

The defendants barged into the IRS and protested the federal government's involvement in El Salvador. They caused a ruckus inside the building and were arrested. Defendants claimed necessity.

Holding

Defendants are not entitled to the necessity defense.

Reasoning

Four necessary elements to prove necessity:

Faced with a choice of evils and choose the lesser evil

Acted to prevent imminent harm

Reasonably anticipated a direct causal relationship between their conduct and the harm to be avoided

No legal alternatives to violating the law

Takeaway

Four elements

## Duress	 {#slide-11}

Duress is an excuse

Defendant is accorded a defense not because it was good to violate the law, but because the circumstances were so compelling that normally law-abiding people might well have done the same

Common law

\](1) A well-founded fear, generated by (2) a threat from a human being of (3) an imminent (or immediate) (4) serious bodily harm or death (5) to himself (or sometimes to a near relative) (6) not of his own doing

Fear must be reasonable 

Common law mostly limited duress to cases where D personally was threatened, but most states now allow the claim of duress when any person's life or bodily harm is threatened by the  duressor

At common law, D could not claim duress if he killed a victim. Instead, he was required to sacrifice himself to the  duressor .

Once the threat has ceased, D must cease his criminality.

MPC § 2.09

## Duress	 (cont'd) {#slide-12}

MPC § 2.09

(1) It is an affirmative defense that the actor was coerced to do so by the use of, or a threat to use, unlawful force against his person or third person, which a person of reasonable firmness in his situation would've been unable to resist

(2) This defense is unavailable if the actor recklessly placed himself in a situation in which it was probable that he would be subjected to duress. The defense is also unavailable if he was negligent in placing himself in such a situation, whenever negligence suffices to convict.

(3) It is not a defense that a woman acted on the command of her husband, unless she acted under coercion under (1).

(4) When the conduct of the actor would otherwise be justifiable under MPC 3.02, this section doesn't preclude a defense. 

## State v. Toscano  (N.J. 1977) {#slide-13}

Facts

The defendant was involved in insurance scheme. He testified that one of the ringleaders of the conspiracy called him and threatened him and his wife. The trial judge refused to instruct the jury on the defense of duress, stating that it was applicable only when an act was committed in response to a threat of present, imminent, or impending death or serious bodily harm. 

Holding

Toscano is entitled to a duress jury instruction.

Reasoning

New Jersey doesn't have a duress statute, so we use common law principles.

The threat of harm must be "present, imminent and pending" and "of such a nature as to induce a well-grounded apprehension of death or serious bodily harm if the act is not done."

To excuse a crime, the threatened injury must induce "such a fear as a man of ordinary fortitude and courage might justly yield to."

Loss of job, denial of food rations, economic need, and prospect of financial ruin are inadequate.

Takeaway

Duress is an objective standard -- a situation inducing fear such that a man of ordinary fortitude and courage would yield

## U.S. v. Fleming {#slide-14}

Facts

Defendant was court martialed for collaborating with Korean combatants when he was held captive. The alleged collaboration occurred after forced marches, physical abuse, and threats of being left for dead in a cave. The military judge instructed that duress available only if he had a well-grounded apprehension of immediate and impending death or of immediate serious bodily harm. Fleming was convicted.

Holding

Defendant is not entitled to the duress defense.

Reasoning

Fleming's resistance had not brought him to the last ditch; the danger of death or serious bodily harm was not immediate.

If being a POW doesn't present a (constant) threat of immediate harm, I don't know what will.

Takeaway

Danger too remote and unknown cannot give rise to the successful duress defense
