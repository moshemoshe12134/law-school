## Actus Reus {#slide-8}

The act requirement, or actus reus, stands for the proposition that just punishment necessitates that punishment be for past, voluntary, wrongful, or potentially harmful conduct that is specified in advanced by statute. 

For criminal liability to attach, there must be a commission or omission. 

And criminal conduct must be voluntary (often called the "volition requirement"). 

What is not voluntary behavior? Reflexes, convulsion, bodily movements during unconsciousness or sleep. (MPC § 2.01)

## Actus Reus -- MPC § 1.13 {#slide-9}

In this Code, unless a different meaning plainly is required: 

(2) "act" or "action" means a bodily movement whether voluntary or involuntary;

(9) "element of an offense" means 

( i ) such conduct or 

(ii) such attendant circumstances or 

(iii) such a result of conduct as 

(a) is included in the description of the forbidden conduct in the definition of the offense; or

(b) establishes the required kind of culpability; or

(c) negatives an excuse or justification for such conduct; or

(d) negatives a defense under the statute of limitations; or

(e) establishes jurisdiction or venue;

## Actus Reus -- MPC § 2.01 {#slide-10}

A person is not guilty of an offense unless his liability is based on conduct which includes a  voluntary act  or the  omission  to perform an act of which he is physically capable.

The following are not voluntary acts within the meaning of this Section: 

(a) a reflex or convulsion; 

(b) a bodily movement during unconsciousness or sleep; 

(c) conduct during hypnosis or resulting from hypnotic suggestion; 

(d) a bodily movement that otherwise is not a product of the effort or determination of the actor, either conscious or habitual.

## Kellman ,  Interpretive Construction in the Substantive Criminal Law {#slide-11}

Look to  Kellman  to frame your arguments for the prosecution or defense. 

What's the time frame? 

Broad (usu. exculpating defendant) vs. narrow (usu. easier to pin culpability)

What did the defendant intend?

Broad (pull the trigger) vs. narrow (kill)

How much of the defendant's history do you consider? Account of the action:

Disjointed (usu. prosecution) vs. unified (usu. defendant's argument)

Looking at the defendant broadly forces the court to make societal judgments

Would a reasonable person act like the defendant? Would a reasonable person who has lived through the defendant's past / experiences act like this?

## Martin v. State  (Ala. Ct. App. 1994) {#slide-12}

Facts

Police officers had arrested him at his house and brought him onto the highway, where he used loud and profane language. Defendant was convicted of being drunk on a public highway and appealed. 

Statute

"Any person who, while intoxicated or drunk, appears in any public place where one or more persons are present, . . . and manifests a drunken condition by boisterous or indecent conduct, or loud and profane discourse, shall, on conviction, be fined."

Holding

Conviction under the statute overturned.

Reasoning

One cannot be accused of public drunkenness if he was involuntarily brought to a public place by an arresting officer.

Theory: think of  Kellman , time framing. Defendant was drunk before taken involuntarily into public.

## People v. Newton  (Cal. Ct. App. 1970) {#slide-13}

Facts

Huey Newton (Black Panthers co-founder) was pulled over by Officer Frey. In the ensuing struggle over a gun (unclear if it was Newton's or Frey's), Frey was fatally shot, and Newton was shot in the abdomen and ended up in the hospital. Newton testified that he had carried no gun and that he had been blacked out (unconscious/semiconscious -- that is, not conscious of his actions) between getting shot and ending up in the hospital. Originally convicted of voluntary manslaughter (we'll get into homicide charges later.)

Holding

Conviction overturned. The trial court committed reversible error when it failed to instruct the jury as to defendant\'s involuntary, unconscious state due to a profound reflex shock reaction.

Rule

"Where not self-induced, as by voluntary intoxication or by the equivalent (of which there is no evidence here), unconsciousness is a complete defense to a charge of criminal homicide."

## People v.  Decina   (N.Y. 1956) {#slide-14}

Facts

Defendant was indicted for driving despite knowing that he was prone to epileptic attacks that caused him to lose consciousness. He lost consciousness while driving and killed four people. 

Statute: "A person who operates or drives any vehicle of any kind in a reckless or culpably negligent manner, whereby a human being is killed is guilty of criminal negligence in the operation of a vehicle resulting in death."

Holding

This was culpable negligence within the meaning of the statute.

Reasoning

The earlier voluntary act of getting into the car and driving it satisfies the voluntary act element of the crime. One may be criminally culpable for involuntary acts caused by a condition if the individual knows of the condition and disregards the possible consequences.

Rule

As long as there is one voluntary act in the defendant's course of conduct, he may be criminally responsible.

## Jones v. U.S.  (D.C. Cir. 1962) {#slide-15}

Facts

Defendant was convicted of involuntary manslaughter because of failure to provide for a friend's infant child. Unclear whether D agreed to take care of the baby or was compensated. D nonetheless had the financial means to provide food and medical care. 

Holding 

Lower court's failure to instruct the jury on neglect of legal duty as a critical element of the crime is plain error. Reversed and remanded.

Rule

"The duty neglected must be a legal duty, and not a mere moral obligation. It must be a duty imposed by law or by contract, and the omission to perform the duty must be the immediate and direct cause of death." (Beardsley)

Note the 4 situations that can result in criminal breach of duty.

## Mens  Rea -- MPC § 2.02 {#slide-16}

Material elements---MPC 1.13(9): conduct, attendant circumstance, and result

Four mental states:

Purposely

Knowingly

Recklessly

Negligently

MPC § 2.02(3) -- default  mens  rea is recklessness

Appears to require awareness for all factors: that there is a risk, the risk is substantial, and the risk is unjustifiable

This is because (1) a prosecutor wouldn't go for the higher  mens  rea and make it unnecessarily harder for her case; and (2) a jury wouldn't need a higher  mens  rea to convict.

Essentially forbids formal strict negligence

## Mens  Rea -- MPC § 2.02 (cont'd) {#slide-17}

MPC § 2.02(4)

Unless there is a clearly contrary purpose, the  mens  rea that attaches to the actus reus attaches to the other elements of the crime.

MPC § 2.02(5)

Proving one  mens  rea also proves every  mens  rea "below" the proven level of culpability.

## Balkin , The  Crystalline Structure of Legal Thought {#slide-19}

Rule choices -- dyadic (2 options)

Individualism vs. Communalism

De-emphasize or minimize responsibilities and duties of individuals to each other, vs. 

Emphasize and extend responsibilities that individuals owe each other

Legal thought / argumentation boils down to essentially this dichotomy

## Regina v. Cunningham {#slide-20}

Facts

Defendant tore gas meter from wall to get \$\$ and in so doing caused a gas leak leading to the partial asphyxiation of his future mother-in-law. He was convicted of maliciously administering a noxious thing after the trial judge instructed the jury that malicious meant wicked.

Statute

\"Whosoever shall unlawfully and maliciously administer to or cause to be administered to or taken by any other person any poison or other destructive or noxious thing, so as thereby to endanger the life of such person, or so as thereby to inflict upon such person any grievous bodily harm, shall be guilty of felony\..."

Issue

Whether the trial judge erred in instructing jury that malice meant wickedness.

Holding

Yes, the trial judge erred. Malice requires not merely wickedness; it requires that D foresaw and recklessly disregarded the harm caused by his actions. (I.e. malicious = reckless.)

Rule

Mere negligence not enough to satisfy the  mens  rea of malice. Prevailing approach in CL.

## Regina v. Faulkner {#slide-21}

Facts

Defendant was trying to steal rum from ship, lit a match and accidentally set ship on fire, destroying it. He was charged with violating the Malicious Damage Act by "maliciously" setting fire to the ship. Trial judge instructed jury that if they found him guilty of theft and believed fire took place during theft, he should be liable for the fire.

Statute

"feloniously, unlawfully, and maliciously" set fire to the ship.

Issue

If, while a person is engaging in a felony, they accidentally do some collateral act, that if done intentionally would be unlawful, should they be found guilty.

Holding

No, can't be convicted for an act that is the unintended and unforeseeable consequence of a lesser offense. In order to have maliciously set fire to the ship, D must have acted intentionally and willfully. Trial judge gave erroneous jury instructions by not requiring malice.

Takeaway

Maliciousness must be intentional and  wilfull

## State v. Hazelwood (Alaska 1997) {#slide-22}

Facts

Defendant, captain of the oil tanker Exxon Valdez, ran his ship aground on a reef, with the result that 11 million gallons of oil spilled.

Statute

It is illegal to "discharge, cause to be discharged, or permit the discharge of petroleum . . . upon the waters or land of the state" when done so "negligently"

Issue

Whether ordinary civil negligence can be applied in a criminal case.

Holding

Yes. The ordinary negligence standard can be applied to the criminal statute, even though criminal negligence would have posed a higher burden for prosecution (criminal negligence requires a more culpable mental state than ordinary negligence because it involves a gross deviation from the standard of care).

## Santillanes  v. New Mexico  (N.M. 1993) {#slide-23}

Facts

Defendant cut his seven-year-old nephew's neck with a knife during an altercation and was convicted of child abuse under a statute defining the offense as "negligently causing a child to be placed in a situation that may endanger the child's life or health." Trial judge gave the jury a standard civil definition of negligence: A negligent act is "one which a reasonably prudent person would foresee as involving an unreasonable risk of injury to himself or to another and which such a person, in the exercise of ordinary care, would not do."

Issue

Whether the court can apple civil negligence in a criminal case.

Holding 

No, the requisite culpability for a criminal act is higher than that of a civil tort. 

Reasoning

"When moral condemnation  and social opprobrium attach to a conviction of a crime, the crime should reflect a mental state warranting such contempt." 

The culpability should reflect the seriousness of the crime, negligence is criminal negligence. 

## Elonis v. United States  (2015) {#slide-24}

Facts

Defendant was convicted of communicating online threats to ex-wife & Kindergarten class through Facebook posts, which contained violent rap lyrics.

Statute

18 U.S.C. § 875(c) makes it a crime to transmit in interstate commerce "any communication containing any threat to . . . injure the person of another."

Issue

Whether defendant needed to be aware of the threatening nature of the communication.

Holding

Yes. A  mens  rea is required; in this case, a finding of at least negligence, if not recklessness, was required to convict.

Reasoning

There is no  mens  rea requirement in the statute. But the Court generally reads into criminal statutes a  mens  rea requirement, even if a statute does not contain one. Criminality requires a minimum of negligence. A guilty mind is a necessary element in the indictment and proof of every crime.

Takeaway

When there is no clear  mens  rea, use the statutory text to interpret one into the statute. If one cannot be read into the statute, apply the default rules of the jurisdiction.
