## Causation {#slide-3}

What's the deal with causation?

In order to be convicted, a defendant's act or culpable omission must have caused the result. Was there an intervening cause that renders the defendant not liable?

The prosecutor must prove the causal link  beyond a reasonable doubt

MPC § 2.03 closely follows the common law approach to causation -- causation is met when results are expected by the "author" or doer. 

## Causation (cont'd) {#slide-4}

MPC § 2.03

(1) Conduct is the cause of a result when:

(a) it is an antecedent  but for  which the result in question would not have occurred;  and

(b) the relationship between the conduct and result satisfies any additional causal requirements imposed by the Code or by the law defining the offense.

(2) When  purposely  or  knowingly  causing a particular result is an element of an offense, the element is not established if the actual result is not within the purpose or the contemplation of the actor unless:

(a) the actual result differs from that designed or contemplated, as the case may be, only in the respect that a different person or different property is injured or affected or that the injury or harm designed or contemplated would have been more serious or more extensive than that caused;  or

(b) the actual result involves the same kind of injury or harm as that designed or contemplated and is not too remote or accidental in its occurrence to have a \[just\] bearing on the actor\'s liability or on the gravity of his offense.

(3) When  recklessly  or  negligently  causing a particular result is an element of an offense, the element is not established if the actual result is not within the risk of which the actor is aware or, in the case of negligence, of which he should be aware unless:

(a) the actual result differs from the probable result only in the respect that a different person or different property is injured or affected or that the probable injury or harm would have been more serious or more extensive than that caused;  or

(b) the actual result involves the same kind of injury or harm as the probable result and is not too remote or accidental in its occurrence to have a \[just\] bearing on the actor\'s liability or on the gravity of his offense.

(4) When causing a particular result is a material element of an offense for which absolute liability is imposed by law, the element is not established unless the actual result is a probable consequence of the actor\'s conduct.

## People v. Acosta  (Ca. 1991) {#slide-5}

Facts

2 police helicopters monitoring the high-speed pursuit of the defendant collide, resulting in 3 deaths. Testimony that pilot of helicopter in which all occupants died had not been following certain FAA regulations.

Issue

Can the defendant be found liable for the deaths?

Holding

Yes, the defendant is liable. 

Analysis

Defendant is liable because the collision was "within the realm of likelihood" to occur and he could have foreseen it. \[But really?\]

Reflects the idea that defendants who create peril to human life should not be surprised if harm occurs as a result of what they did. 

Consequently, an actor will be held responsible even if another person, including the victim, a would-be rescuer, or a police officer, actually brings about the harm. 

Takeaway

Proximate cause is met with but-for causation and foreseeability

Foreseeability inquiry -- was the result highly extraordinary? (But what about FAA violations?)

Acosta  represents a low bar for foreseeability

## People v.  Arzon   (1978) {#slide-6}

Facts

Defendant started a fire on the fifth floor of an abandoned building to keep warm. Firefighters responded to fight the fire. Meanwhile, another fire started independently by X on the second floor trapped the firefighters. Overcome by smoke from the first and second fires, a firefighter sustained injuries from which he died. 

Issue

Has the defendant cause the death of the firefighter?

Holding

Yes. 

Analysis

In all likelihood, the firefighter would not have died had X not set the second-story fire. The defendant's fire, however, satisfied the "but-for" requirement. Had the defendant not set the fifth-floor fire, the firefighter would not have died. 

Takeaway

Defendant's conduct need not be the sole and exclusive factor in death (concurrent causation)

But how far attenuated can you get?

## People v. Campbell  (1983) {#slide-7}

Facts

Campbell and  Basnaw  were drinking together. Campbell knew that his wife and  Basnaw  had slept together. Campbell told  Basnaw  to kill himself and gave him a gun.  Basnaw  killed himself. 

Issue

Is furnishing the means for suicide murder?

Holding

No

Analysis

Suicide, by definition, excludes homicide. Just because the furnisher hopes the recipient commits suicide doesn't mean that the furnisher committed murder. 

Takeaway

Suicide vs. homicide

## People v. Kevorkian  (Mich. 1994) {#slide-8}

Facts

Defendant Kevorkian assisted two women in committing suicide who were suffering from conditions causing great pain or severe disabling. The women were the "last ones in the chain" to actually bring about the deaths.

Issue

Can  Kervorkian  be convicted of murder when he intentionally provided the means for suicide?

Holding

Nope.

Analysis / Takeaway

A conviction of murder is proper if a defendant participates in the final overt act that causes death, but not where a defendant is involved merely "in the events leading up to the commission of the final overt act, such as furnishing the means"

In other words, an act is murder if defendant participates in  final act , but not if defendant is involved in events leading up to final act

## Theories of punishment {#slide-9}

Why are we talking about these?

Utilitarianism -- maximize social utility, prevent crime in the future, focus on consequences (think econ)

Deterrence -- Bentham -- punishment should be used to "exclude some greater evil"

general deterrence -- punishment deters other members of community

specific deterrence -- punishment deters defendant's future misconduct

Incapacitation -- prevent defendant from committing crime; can't predict accurately whether individuals will reoffend

Rehabilitation -- requires accepting that punishment alters / can alter defendant's behavior

Vitiello  -- it is a moral imperative to offer the offender a chance at moral transformation

## Theories of punishment (cont'd) {#slide-10}

Retribution -- looks to the defendant's conduct; punishment is justified because defendant deserves it, is blameworthy. 

Kant -- eye for an eye, crimes are moral wrongs because they violate categorical imperatives

Hegel -- by committing a crime, the criminal authorizes equivalent treatment to annul the crime. \[Difficult to apply to certain crimes, conspiracy? Murder? Sexual assault?\]

Moore -- punishment is justified by the moral culpability of those who receive it

Morris -- those who break the law violate the social contract, so it is reasonable and just to punish them. 

## Foucault,  Discipline and Punish {#slide-11}

Crime has come to be defined as a moral wrong. 

We used to punish people for their acts. Now, we punish people for who they are. \[What does this mean for deterrence? Can we deter?\]

The development of prisons

Framing crime as a moral failure of the criminal keeps people from questioning and criticizing the penitentiary system and the larger criminal justice system. 

## Harcourt,  Post-Modern Meditations on Punishment {#slide-12}

Harcourt suggests punishment is culturally determined and biased. The carceral state cites empirical studies, but these still inject biases and social / cultural assumptions into the criminal justice system. Mass incarceration is a tool to maintain white (economic) supremacy. 

The carceral state and its tactics (racial policing, maintaining order) are justified as being rational solutions

But , the assumption and predictive tools underlying the carceral state are not reliable, are biased. How can the overarching system claim to be rational if its theoretical support is unreliable?

The solution is randomizing punishment within relative bands of potential punishment (e.g., robbery has a lower band than homicide). 

## Hypo {#slide-13}

As you read a hypo...

What cases that we've read jump out at you?

What issues that we've read about jump out at you?

Big questions

Intent?

What  mens  rea  can we argue for / against here?
