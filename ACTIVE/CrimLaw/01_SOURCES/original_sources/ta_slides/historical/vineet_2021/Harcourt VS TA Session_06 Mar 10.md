Race and the death penalty

Feedback

## McCleskey v. Kemp  (1987) {#slide-3}

Facts

McCleskey was convicted of death-eligible murder. The jury recommended death, and the judge sentenced him accordingly. The Baldus study showed that the death penalty in Georgia was imposed in a racially discriminatory manner against Black defendants, with particularly great frequency when the murder victim was White.

Issue

Whether the Baldus study showed that Georgia's capital-sentencing process violated the Eighth (cruel and unusual) and Fourteenth (due process) Amendments

Holding

No, the study does not demonstrate a constitutionally-significant risk of racial bias in Georgia's capital-sentencing process

Reasoning

No evidence of discriminatory intent on the part of the jury or the legislature. 

Slippery slope -- can't have people bringing up studies challenging these systems in federal court

Institutionally competency -- the problem is one that legislatures, not courts, can address

Takeaway

If you take Powell's argument at face value, the (purely) constitutional argument, as framed, makes sense. You need evidence of discriminatory/invidious intent of the jury or the legislature.

No evidence submitted indicating jury bias.

The statute itself does not extend special protection to one class of people to the targeted detriment to another. No legislative history supporting such a contention.

Is this really justice? 

Are you convinced that the political/legislative process in GA in 1987 would adequately correct this problem in the state's capital-sentencing process?

## McCleskey v. Kemp  (cont'd) {#slide-4}

Takeaway

A statistical argument, by itself, is a losing argument

Statistics alone will not suffice to demonstrate constitutionally-significant risk of racial bias

Need evidence of discriminatory intent

## Lawrence,  The Id, the Ego, and Equal Protection {#slide-5}

Death penalty is racially biased, is unfair

Lawrence attacks the  Washington v. Davis  decision

Laws that have a racial discriminatory effect but were not promulgated with discriminatory intent are fine

Focusing only on discriminatory intent on the part of the jury or legislature is futile

It is difficult to find sufficient evidence to prove discriminatory intent

## Steven Bright and Representation {#slide-6}

Top line: the death penalty is unfair for those unable to pay

Often, in states that still use death penalty, the indigent defendants are not given good defense counsel

Public defenders in general are over-worked, under-paid, and under-funded

When it's  a question of deprivation of your life, money should never be a factor in whether death penalty is imposed

Having good counsel should not be question of how much state gives to public defender's office

Poor defendants are deprived of actual trial/actual adversarial process

Useful for policy question on the death penalty -- way to attack death penalty by asking whether death penalty is going to end up killing more poor people
