## MPC § 213.1 {#slide-4}

(1) A male who has sexual intercourse with a female not his wife is guilty of rape if:

He compels her to submit by force or by threat of imminent death, serious bodily injury, extreme pain or kidnapping, to be inflicted on anyone; or

He has substantially impaired her power to appraise or control her conduct by administering or employing without her knowledge drugs, intoxicants or other means for the purpose of preventing resistance; or

The female is unconscious; or

The female is less than 10 years old

The MPC has been adopted by very few states

It is outdated

## New York Penal Law § 130 {#slide-5}

(1) A male who has sexual intercourse with a female not his wife is guilty of rape if:

He compels her to submit by force or by threat of imminent death, serious bodily injury, extreme pain or kidnapping, to be inflicted on anyone; or

He has substantially impaired her power to appraise or control her conduct by administering or employing without her knowledge drugs, intoxicants or other means for the purpose of preventing resistance; or

The female is unconscious; or

The female is less than 10 years old

The MPC has been adopted by very few states

It is outdated

## Comparing sexual assault law {#slide-6}

Traditional common law

Actus reus  -- vaginal intercourse

Attendant circumstances

Woman

Force

Against will

Mens  rea  -- none, but show some intent (examples of physical restraint may suffice)

Proof -- "utmost resistance"

Most progressive common law states

Actus reus  -- penetration

Attendant circumstances

Any person

No additional force required

Lack of affirmative consent

Mens  rea  -- strict liability or negligence

Proof -- No resistance requirement

## State v. Rusk  (Md. Ct. App. 1981) {#slide-7}

Facts

Victim refused to go to defendant's apartment. The defendant takes her car keys and goes inside. Victim goes into defendant's apartment and has sex with the defendant. Victim repeatedly told the defendant "no." There was light choking of the neck prior to penetration.

Issue

Whether the elements of the rape statute could be established and whether "force or threat of force" was satisfied, given the lack of the resistance.

Holding

Conviction upheld. 

Reasoning

Victim's fear must have been subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable -- this suffices to establish actual force or physical resistance

Light choking was seen as reasonable cause of fear and as evidence of physical forced

The latter establishes objective reasonableness

Takeaway

Physical force, even a "light" amount, can prove the reasonableness of a victim's fear

## State v.  DiPetrillo   (R.I. 2007) {#slide-8}

Facts

Victim was a 19-year-old employee at the 30-year-old D's business. D asked V to work late, called her into his office, and grabbed her by the wrist, pulled her onto his lap, and kissed her. V said several times "we have to stop," but D persisted and penetrated her vagina with one of his fingers. D found guilty of 1st + 2nd degree sexual assault (both of which require proof of force or coercion)

Statute

1st-degree sexual assault (Rhode Island's statutory equivalent of rape) requires proof of sexual penetration by "force or coercion," and 2nd-degree sexual assault requires proof of sexual contact by "force or coercion."

Issue

Whether the statutory requirement of "force or coercion" has been met. Lower court opinion rested on a "psychological pressure-on-a-vulnerable-victim" analysis of the force/coercion standard.

Holding

Not clear that there was an implied threat of physical force. Reversed. 

"\[W\]e are left with uncertainty about whether defendant was convicted based on a finding of force and coercion by physical force."

## State in the Interest of M.T.S.  (N.J. 1992) {#slide-9}

Facts

17-year-old defendant engaged in consensual kissing and sexual contact with the 15-year-old victim. In a second encounter, he engaged in sexual penetration while she was asleep. No "unusual or extra" force or threats of force.

Statute

N.J. statute defines "sexual assault" as the commission "of sexual penetration" "with another person" with the use of "physical force or coercion." Both the act of "sexual penetration" and the use of "physical force or coercion" are separate and distinct elements of the offense.

Issue

What constitutes force under the NJ statute? Is the element of "physical force" met simply by an act of non-consensual penetration involving no more force than necessary to accomplish that result?

Holding

Penetration (without consent) itself constitutes force. The actus reus of penetration exists, and it was not authorized.

Reasoning

Legislature gave no indication of what force means, so it's entirely up to the N.J. Supreme Court to decide what the force requirement is in New Jersey

Analogize to assault and battery, where any touch that is unauthorized is assault and battery. Thus, any penetration that is unauthorized is rape.

Force = penetration in the absence of freely given permission

"A person's failure to protest or resist cannot be considered or used as a justification for bodily invasion"

Takeaway

Lack of affirmative consent is non-consent; force = force inherent in sex (very V friendly) 

## State in the Interest of M.T.S.  (cont'd) {#slide-10}

More takeaways 

Default presumption of non-consent

Court imputes affirmative consent into the statute through battery. Any unauthorized touching is battery, so any unauthorized penetration is rape.

Shifts focus to victim's conduct and words

Prosecution meets burden of proof by showing an absence of affirmative consent, which is easily satisfied through an absence of evidence.

The burden is effectively the defendant's from the beginning, which trends towards strict liability.

Force is satisfied by the fact of penetration.

## Commonwealth v. Sherry  (Mass. 1982) {#slide-11}

Facts

A nurse and three doctors left a party together and went to a house. The victim did not consent, felt physically numb and so could not fight back. Each defendant had sex with victim. 

Issue

Is the  mens  rea  here knowledge? (Were defendants entitled to a jury instruction on good faith mistake defense?)

Holding

No, defendants' knowledge is irrelevant -- good faith mistake defense is inapplicable

Reasoning

Victim said no -- any implication other than non-consent in the defendant's mind is irrelevant

Takeaway

Is the  mens  rea  negligence or strict liability? Harcourt thinks courts are trending toward strict liability. 

## Commonwealth v. Fischer  (Pa. Super. 1998) {#slide-12}

Facts

There were 2 sexual encounters between college classmates. 

Defendant argued both were consensual. 

Victim argued "no" in the 2nd encounter. Victim claimed that defendant raped her by forcible oral sex, restraining her, and preventing her from leaving despite verbal refusals. 

Defendant asked for instruction for defense of mistake based on previous sexual interactions.

Defendant says he thought victim was consenting based on previous sexual interactions. 

Holding

Court refused to grant defense. 

Under Williams, the court can't create a mistake of fact defense for consent.

The legislature must create the defense via statute.

## Policy Hypo {#slide-14}

Manslaughter

MPC § 2.10

Homicide committed recklessly 

Homicide which would otherwise be murder, but which is committed under extreme mental or emotional disturbance for which there is a reasonable explanation or excuse

Reasonableness determined from the viewpoint of a person in the actor's situation under the circumstances as he believes them to be

Also think of heat of passion (homicide + provocation = voluntary manslaughter)

Manslaughter cases

Welansky  -- night club fire

Hall  -- skier

Williams  -- infant, ordinary negligence suffices (outlier, Washington said negligence sufficed for involuntary manslaughter)

Theories

Retribution -- looks to DEF's conduct; punishment is justified because DEF deserves it, is blameworthy. 

Kant -- eye for an eye, crimes are moral wrongs because they violate categorical imperatives

Moore -- punishment is justified by the moral culpability of those who receive it

Morris -- those who break the law violate the social contract, so it is reasonable and just to punish them. 

Utilitarianism -- maximize social utility, prevent crime in the future, focus on consequences

Deterrence -- Bentham -- punishment should be used to "exclude some greater evil"

general deterrence -- punishment deters other members of community

specific deterrence -- punishment deters DEF's future misconduct

Incapacitation -- prevent DEF from committing crime; can't predict accurately whether individuals will reoffend

Rehabilitation -- punishment alters DEF's behavior

Vitiello  -- it is a moral imperative to offer the offender a chance at moral transformation
