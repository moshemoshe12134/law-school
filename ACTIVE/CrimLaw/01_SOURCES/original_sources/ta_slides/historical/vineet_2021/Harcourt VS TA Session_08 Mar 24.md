## Background {#slide-3}

Consider the role of the grand jury -- are you comfortable with the role they play?

Think of how involved the prosecutor is and how complicated (and poorly written) statutes are. Are grand juries actually independent?

## Justifications and excuses {#slide-4}

Justifications and defenses negate liability even when all elements of the offense are present. 

Justifications assert that what the accused did was a good thing / that society is better of based on the action (e.g., self-defense). 

Excuses assert that while the conduct was harmful, the defendant cannot be expected to do otherwise (e.g., due to duress, mental disorder). 

Responsibility

A justification means you accept responsibility for the action, whereas you do not do so under an excuse. 

## Self-defense {#slide-5}

MPC § 3.04

(1) -- force upon another person is justifiable when the actor believes that such force is immediately necessary for the purpose of protecting himself against the use of unlawful force by such other person

(2)b -- (1) the use of deadly force is justifiable  only  when the actor believes that force is necessary to protect himself against death, bodily harm, kidnapping, or sexual intercourse compelled by force or threat.  

Not justifiable if the actor provoked the use of force with the purpose of causing death or serious bodily injury (3.04 (2)(b)( i )).

MPC § 3.09

## Self-defense (cont'd) {#slide-6}

MPC § 3.09

(1) -- Justification for self-defense not available when the actor's belief as to the unlawfulness of the force being used against him (or the lawfulness of an arrest) is erroneous AND his error is due to ignorance or mistake as to the provisions of the Code, any other provision of the criminal law, OR the law governing the legality of an arrest or search.

(2) -- When the actor is reckless or negligent in forming his belief regarding the necessity of force, the justification is unavailable for offenses involving a  mens  rea  of recklessness or negligence.

(1)  This is proxy for establishing gradation. If prosecutor wants to charge Bob with murder, and Bob argues self-defense but was reckless or negligent in using self-defense, prosecutor can bring manslaughter charge instead, because Bob cannot use his self-defense justification for that.

(3) -- When the actor is justified in use of force but recklessly or negligently injures or creates a risk of injury to innocent people, the justification is unavailable in a prosecution for such recklessness or negligence to innocent people.

## U.S. v. Peterson  (D.C. Cir. 1973) {#slide-7}

Conditions for using deadly use of force (in self-defense):

(1) There must have been a threat, actual or apparent, of the use of deadly force against the actor;

(2) Threat must have been unlawful and immediate;

(3) Actor must have believed he was in imminent peril of death or serious bodily harm, and that his response was necessary to save himself; AND

(4) These beliefs must have been honestly entertained and objectively reasonable in light of the circumstances

Takeaway

Self-defense is justified when the actor  reasonable believes  that defense force is necessary

Subjective -- did actor have belief?

Objective -- was the belief reasonable?

## People v. Goetz  (N.Y. 1986) {#slide-8}

Facts

Four youths were in the subway car with defendant Goetz, who had a concealed handgun, which he began carrying after a mugging a few years back. One of the youths walked up to Goetz and said "give me five dollars." There is no evidence that any of the youths displayed weapons, although two had screwdrivers in their coats, which they said were for breaking into the coin boxes of video machines. Goetz pulled out his gun and shot each of the youths, shooting twice at one whom he had missed initially. He admitted to the shootings and told the police that he would have shot them more times had he had more bullets.  All of the victims survived, although one is paralyzed and has some brain damage. 

Procedural History

A grand jury indicted defendant on attempted murder, assault, and other charges. The lower courts dismissed the charges on the ground that the prosecutor's explanation of "reasonably believes" to the grand jury was erroneous.

## People v. Goetz  (cont'd) {#slide-9}

Statute

Penal Law § 35.15(1): "A person may use physical force upon another person when and to the extent he reasonably believes such to be necessary to defend himself or a third person from what he reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of unlawful physical force by such other person."

Penal Law § 35.15(2): "A person may not use deadly physical force upon another person under circumstances specified in subdivision one unless (a) he reasonably believes that such other person is using or about to use deadly physical force or (b) he reasonably believes that such person is committing or attempting to commit a kidnapping, forcible rape, forcible sodomy or robbery."

Holding

Court reinstates all counts of the indictment.

## People v. Goetz  (cont'd) {#slide-10}

Reasoning

NY adopted much of the MPC but crucially added "reasonably" before "believes." 

Interpreting the statute to say "reasonable to him" would render "reasonably" meaningless and would allow subjective views to completely exonerate him.

Lower courts' interpretation would allow citizens to set their own standards for permissible use of force.

Reasonableness inquiry happens with regard to the actual circumstances of the particular incident, including past experiences of the defendant.

Takeaway

"Reasonably" must be interpreted objectively. Can't be solely based on the defendant's own subjective interpretation, or else anyone could get away with a self-defense justification by just saying that they believed they were justified. However, this "objective" standard can still be informed by the specific circumstances of the case (e.g., D's past experiences). 

## Self-defense (cont'd) {#slide-11}

Self-defense and race

Is it reasonable for a white man on a dark street to believe a Black man walking the other way posed a threat?

Maybe not objectively reasonable, but should the court credit that  he  believed it? How far do we go down the line of acknowledging racially-based personal motivations for actions?

If Trayvon Martin had been a white teenager, similarly "muscular," would the grand jury have credited Zimmerman's belief?

## Battered woman syndrome {#slide-12}

Think of  Kellman  and time-framing

This is specific subset of the self-defense justification

## State v. Norman  (N.C. 1989) {#slide-13}

Facts

Norman was badly abused during 25-year marriage. She shot her husband while he was asleep and was charged with first-degree murder. At trial, she presented evidence of suffering from battered wife syndrome as proof of a perfect self-defense. Jury convicted of voluntary manslaughter. Norman was sentenced to six years in prison. 

Holding

Self-defense is only available for imminent harm. Self-defense is not justified to protect oneself against threat of future harm. 

Narrow time-frame -- think  Goetz  and  Kellman

Reasoning

Necessity defense is available  only where defendant killed victim due to reasonable belief that death / great bodily harm was imminent

Here, evidence did not show that Norman reasonably believed she was confronted with threat of imminent death / harm

There was amble time to resort to other means to prevent further abuse

No evidence of decedent's actions prior to death that would indicate a reasonable belief on the part of Norman that there was an imminent danger

Takeaway

It will be difficult to argue an ongoing, consistent threat of abuse. The threat must be something you can point to as concrete and material at the time of the act of self-defense. 

## Duty to Retreat {#slide-14}

Traditional View

English common law imposed strict duty to retreat. A person could use deadly force in self-defense only after exhausting every chance to flee, when his back was against the wall.

Late 1800s View

The law will not permit the taking of a human life to repel mere trespass, but a true man who is without fault is not obliged to fly from an assailant.  Erwin v. State  (Ohio 1876).

Modern View

The "true man" doctrine (originating in  Erwin ) is rejected in some jurisdictions (e.g. Ohio) and accepted in others (e.g. Tennessee).

True man / no retreat / stand your ground rule considered the majority approach.

MPC adopts a version of this rule with some exceptions.

## Castle exception {#slide-15}

In all jurisdictions requiring retreat before using deadly force, an exception is made when the defendant is attacked in her own home by an intruder.  People v. Tomlin  (N.Y. 1914).

Gets tricky with guests and co-occupants

Only a few states require retreat from an attacking guest. Carpenter,  Of the Enemy Within, the Castle Doctrine, and Self-Defense .

A father threatened by his son could kill the son rather than retreat.  Tomlin ;  State v. Jones    (S.C. 2016); MPC § 3.04(2)(b)(ii)(1).

Some courts require homeowner to flee if possible from a co-occupant attacker.  State v.  Gartland   (N.J. 1997).

## Stand your ground {#slide-16}

Even if you could retreat, you can stay and use force

Erodes the necessity requirement for self-defense

If someone says that they were standing their own ground, law enforcement can't arrest unless you can show probable cause that the force used was unlawful

Highly controversial 

The burden shift makes it difficult to demonstrate that the individual standing their ground was doing so unlawfully
