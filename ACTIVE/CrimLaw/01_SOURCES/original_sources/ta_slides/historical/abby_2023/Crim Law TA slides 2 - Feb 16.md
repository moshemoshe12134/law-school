## MPC Definitions of Homicide (MPC § 2.10) {#slide-6}

- Criminal Homicide (§ 210.1)

<!-- -->

- Purposely, knowingly, recklessly, or negligently causing the death of another human being 

<!-- -->

- Another human being = born and alive

<!-- -->

- Envelops the following 3 categories

<!-- -->

- Murder   (§ 210.2)

<!-- -->

- Homicide committed  purposely or knowingly  (analog to intentional killing)
- Homicide committed  recklessly  under the circumstances manifesting  extreme indifference to the value of human life   (analog to depraved heart)

<!-- -->

- Would have been manslaughter but elevated to murder - merges felony murder into recklessness

<!-- -->

- Presumed if engaged in or an accomplice to a violent felony (robbery, forcible sex, arson, burglary, kidnapping, or escape) but rebuttable                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                

<!-- -->

- Manslaughter   (§ 210.3)

<!-- -->

- Homicide committed  recklessly  (but see above if also showing extreme indifference)  OR
- Homicide which would otherwise be murder, but which is committed under  extreme mental or emotional disturbance  for which there is a  reasonable explanation or excuse

<!-- -->

- Reasonableness determined from the viewpoint of a person in the actor's situation under the circumstances as he believes them to be

<!-- -->

- Negligent Homicide   (§ 210.4)

<!-- -->

- Homicide committed  negligently

## Common Law  Definitions of Homicide {#slide-7}

Common Law  (note this my chart is from a different prof's class, not Harcourt's)

- Murder is homicide with  malice aforethought

<!-- -->

- Distinction between first and second degree is  premeditation

<!-- -->

- Anderson factors: planning, motive, manner
- First degree = premeditated 
- Second degree = intent to cause death

<!-- -->

- Manslaughter is homicide without malice aforethought

<!-- -->

- Voluntary - intent to kill but in  heat of passion  / with  legally adequate provocation
- Involuntary - recklessness or negligence

<!-- -->

- Felony murder

<!-- -->

- First degree - death results during course of enumerated felony
- Second degree - death results during commission or attempted commision of a (not enumerated) felony

- Mens reas:

<!-- -->

- 1. premeditated 
- 2. intent to cause death 
- 3. intent to inflict serious bodily harm 
- 4. extreme recklessness and indifference to life 
- 5. felony-murder (no intent to kill, but intent to commit felony)

Intent to Kill

No I ntent to Kill

## Intentional Killings   {#slide-8}

- Voluntary manslaughter = what would otherwise be considered murder + legally adequate provocation

<!-- -->

- What is an adequate provocation?

<!-- -->

- Common law approach shown in  Girouard : "For provocation to be adequate, it must be calculated to inflame the passion of a reasonable man and tend to cause him to act for the moment from passion rather than reason"- "Words can constitute adequate provocation if they are accompanied by conduct indicating a present intention and ability to cause the defendant bodily harm."

<!-- -->

- Minority view represented in  Maher : case-by-case

<!-- -->

- MPC approach shown in  Casassa : particular defendant "acted under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance" for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse" - reasonableness determined from viewpoint of person in defendant's situation under circumstances as defendant understood them

<!-- -->

- Cooling time?

<!-- -->

- Common law: significant lapse of time between provocation and killing renders provocation inadequate

<!-- -->

- But some states recognize "rekindling" 
- But maybe "long-smoldering" provocation

<!-- -->

- MPC: allows for more "simmering" than common law (Casassa)

<!-- -->

- Provocation that causes defendant to act in the heat of passion acts as an excuse / affirmative defense

<!-- -->

- Some jurisdictions use provocation as a partial excuse / justification
- Legally adequate provocations are an example of where the norms of our cultures are enforced in criminal law (i.e., patriarchy, monogamy, men feeling ownership over women → violence, homophobia, transphobia)
- Why do we think people who are provoked are less culpable?

## Premeditation {#slide-9}

Note: premeditation is required for murder; since voluntary manslaughter = murder + provocation, premeditation is also relevant to voluntary manslaughter cases

Commonwealth v. Carroll

- Takeaway: premeditation can occur in the moments before a homicide; short length of time and general lack of planning doesn't preclude finding premeditation
- Facts: Defendant shot his wife in the back of the head while they were lying in bed after an argument & disposed of body
- Procedural posture: pled guilty to first-degree murder ("willful, deliberate, premeditated")
- Issue: Should the evidence of defendant's good character and evidence that the homicide was not premeditated or intentional require the court to fix the degree of guilt no higher than second-degree murder?
- Holding: This was clearly willful, deliberate, and premeditated murder. Judgment and sentence for first-degree murder affirmed.

## Premeditation {#slide-10}

State v. Guthrie

- Takeaway: premeditation requires weighing / considering /  reflecting on  the decision to kill - look at behavior, motive (including relationship), and manner of killing

<!-- -->

- Shows jurisdictional split with Carroll (that was in PA and this was in WV)

<!-- -->

- Facts: D pulled a knife from his pocket and stabbed his coworker in the neck. D and decedent were joking around during their work as dishwashers; decedent snapped defendant with a dishtowel several times. After decedent flipped D on the nose with the towel, D removed his gloves and stabbed decedent. D had many mental disorders, including an obsession with his nose. He also testified that he suffered a panic attack just before the stabbing.
- Procedural posture: Defendant was found guilty of first-degree murder ("willful, deliberate, and premeditated") and sentenced to life imprisonment. Jury instructions said premeditation means intent to kill & need exist "only for an instant."
- Issue: Whether jury instructions on the premeditation component of murder are wrong and confusing because they suggest that the intention to kill does not need to exist for any length of time before the killing.
- Holding: premeditation must include some time to contemplate the decision to kill, which requires more than an instant
- Something to think about: how are "mental disorders" invoked in criminal law?

## Heat of Passion {#slide-11}

Girouard v. State

- Takeaway: as a matter of law, words alone are never adequate provocation for heat of passion defense / excuse

<!-- -->

- Common law approach

<!-- -->

- Facts: Girouard and wife got into argument. Wife told Girouard she wanted a divorce and she had filed charges against him for abuse. She asked, "What are you going to do?" and Girouard took out a knife he had hidden behind pillow and stabbed her 19 times.
- Issue: what types of provocation are sufficient to mitigate the crime of murder to manslaughter - should it be decided case by case? Are words alone enough to mitigate a second-degree murder conviction to manslaughter?
- Procedural posture: convicted of second-degree murder
- Rule: 

<!-- -->

- Words are sufficient provocation if they are both:

<!-- -->

- Calculated to inflame the passion of a reasonable man and tend to cause him to act for the moment from passion rather than reason AND
- Accompanied by conduct indicating a present intention and ability to cause the defendant bodily harm.

<!-- -->

- Reasoning: Girouard could not have reasonably feared bodily harm - he was a foot taller and 85 pounds heavier
- Holding: not adequate provocation to reduce murder to manslaughter because "words alone are not adequate provocation" and Girouard could not have reasonably feared bodily harm.

## Heat of Passion {#slide-12}

Maher v. People (1862)

- Takeaway: provocation is a jury question

<!-- -->

- Minority view

<!-- -->

- Facts: Maher suspected his wife was having an affair w/ Hunt, saw them disappear into the woods together. When they reappeared, Maher followed Hunt to a saloon and shot Hunt (but non-fatal wound). Maher was charged w/ assault w/ intent to commit murder.
- Issue: should evidence of "adulterous intercourse" have been admitted to show provocation? 

<!-- -->

- Rule: if it would have mitigated the killing, had death ensued, from murder to manslaughter, then yes

<!-- -->

- Reasoning: 

<!-- -->

- Murder usually requires "some degree of coolness and deliberation" -- if the act of killing was committed "in heat of blood" "and before a reasonable time has elapsed for the blood to cool and reason to resume its habitual control," that can mitigate from murder to manslaughter
- What amount of time is needed to cool down depends on the circumstances of the provocation → leave it to the jury

<!-- -->

- Holding: Evidence of provocation should have been admitted here because it would have been "competent of a jury to find that the action was committed in consequence of the passion excited by the provocation." → new trial granted

<!-- -->

- Think about: would they have found it "competent" if a woman claimed the same provocation? Maybe less socially expected -- would that be enough to find her legally liable where a man may not be? 

## Heat of Passion {#slide-13}

People v. Casassa

- Takeaway: analysis for heat of passion combines subjective and objective → (1) was this particular defendant in some emotional distress? (2) was the fact that the defendant was in emotional distress reasonably justifiable by looking at the situation from the defendant's point of view?

<!-- -->

- MPC approach - this statute was based on the MPC
- Note: because this is an affirmative defense in the NY statute, the burden of proof is on defendant in this case

<!-- -->

- Facts: Casassa's girlfriend broke up with him and he stalked her. He brought her gifts and when she rejected them, he stabbed her several times in the throat.
- Reasoning: Lower court found " the excuse offered by defendant was so peculiar to him that it was unworthy of mitigation" → " concluded that the murder in this case was the result of defendant's malevolence rather than an understandable human response deserving of mercy. We cannot say, as a matter of law, that the court erred in so concluding"
- Holding: excuse of extreme emotional distress was not reasonable here → affirm conviction

## Felony Murder {#slide-14}

- Common law

<!-- -->

- Causing death in the course of perpetrating another felony. 
- A strict liability offense in the sense that it doesn't require a distinct mens rea to kill; rather, the intent to commit felony substitutes for the mens rea that resulted in the death of victim. 

<!-- -->

- The MPC doesn't have felony murder per se, but establishes a presumption of recklessness / extreme indifference to human life where an actor is "engaged, or is an accomplice in the commission of, or attempt to commit, or flight after committing or attempting to commit 

<!-- -->

- Robbery
- Rape or deviate sexual intercourse by force or threat of force
- Arson
- Burglary
- Kidnapping OR
- Felonious escape"
- (MPC Section 210.2)
- Effect: still gets something that would otherwise be manslaughter into the murder category, as felony murder would

## Felony Murder {#slide-15}

- Agency theory

<!-- -->

- Liability attaches when the person committing the felony / their agent kill

<!-- -->

- So defendant is responsible if the person committing the felony with them kills anyone during the course of the felony

<!-- -->

- Proximate cause theory

<!-- -->

- Liability attaches for any death proximately resulting from the unlawful activity.

Proximate Cause Analysis

## Felony Murder {#slide-17}

Regina v. Serné

- Facts: Leon Serné and his family were in severe debt, living in house above a store in London. Serné had taken out a life insurance policy on his son Sjaak, and insured store inventory, furniture, and rent. Within a month the store and house burned down and Sjaak died. At trial, prosecution introduced evidence that Serné and Goldfinch had been seen together in the shop shortly before the fire started. It was alleged they willfully set fire and were indicted for Sjaak's murder.
- Rule: any act known to be dangerous to life and likely in itself to cause death, done for the purpose of committing a felony which causes death, is felony murder
- Reasoning: unknown, jury decided it
- Holding: not guilty
- Coke footnote: felony murder vs. non-culpable homicide = if the act is is unlawful and a death occurs, murder; if the act is lawful and a death occurs, not murder

<!-- -->

- Intertwining property and criminal law
- Here unlawful means "an underlying crime"
- Judge Stephens rejects / limits this -- narrows it when stating the rule to the jury

## Felony Murder {#slide-18}

People v. Stamp

- Takeaway: felony murder doctrine not limited to foreseeable deaths; "a felon is instead held strictly liable for all killings committed by him or his accomplices in the course of the felony"

<!-- -->

- As long as the homicide is the direct causal result of the robbery the felony-murder rule applies whether or not the death was a natural / probable consequence of the robbery.
- Stamp takes his victim as he finds him - unforeseeable extent of injury doesn't matter
- Very harsh version of felony murder rule

<!-- -->

- Facts: defendant burglarized Honeyman's store, robbed him at gunpoint. After, Honeyman (60-year-old with history of heart disease) died of a heart attack. Doctors testified that the fright from the robbery was too much of a shock to Honeyman's system.
- Reasoning: homicide was the direct causal result of the robbery
- Holding: uphold first-degree murder conviction

## Felony Murder {#slide-19}

State v. Canola

- Takeaway: felony murder (in this state) requires that the murder occur in furtherance of the felony; court ascribes to agency theory

<!-- -->

- Reduces extent of felony murder (less harsh than Serne and Stamp)

<!-- -->

- Facts: Jewelry store owner resisted an attempted armed robbery by defendant (Canola) and his accomplices. One accomplice and the store owner exchanged gunfire, both died. Defendant and two accomplices indicted on one count of robbery and two counts of murder (store owner and co-felon). Defendant found guilty on both murder counts and sentenced to two concurrent terms of life imprisonment.
- Issue: Under NJ law, can a defendant be found guilty of felony-murder when during his robbery of a store one of the robbery victims shoots one of the defendant's accomplices?
- Holding: New Jersey law does not permit finding a defendant is guilty of felony murder when their accomplice was killed by the victim of the felony

## Unintended Homicide {#slide-20}

- Degree of disregard for standard of care can swing you from civil negligence all the way to murder
- MPC 

<!-- -->

- Civil negligence → no liability
- Reasonable person should have been aware → criminal negligence
- Recklessness (conscious disregard) → manslaughter
- Manifesting extreme indifference to value of human life / gross recklessness → murder

<!-- -->

- Common law

<!-- -->

- Negligent homicide
- Involuntary manslaughter
- Murder (extreme recklessness)

## Extreme Recklessness  {#slide-21}

Commonwealth v. Malone

- Takeaway: what may otherwise be manslaughter is raised to murder when there's gross recklessness for which actor must reasonably anticipate that death to another is likely to result
- Facts: 17-year-old killed his 13-year-old friend while playing Russian Roulette; did not think the gun would go off
- Issue: did Malone's actions constitute malice?
- Rule: malice is present where an individual commits an act of gross recklessness for which they must reasonably anticipate that death to another is likely to result, showing reckless and wanton disregard for the consequences
- Reasoning: lack of motive to kill is not dispositive; 60% chance of shooting his friend was gross recklessness → "uncalled-for act in callous disregard of its likely harmful effects on others"

<!-- -->

- Intentional act = pulling the trigger
- Mens rea = reckless and  wanton  disregard for the consequences 

<!-- -->

- Holding: yes, malice was present → murder conviction stands

## Recklessness  {#slide-22}

Commonwealth v. Welansky

- Takeaway: subjective AND objective standard 

<!-- -->

- Note: different from depraved heart murder ( Malone ) because involuntary manslaughter requires mens rea of recklessness, not gross recklessness, and a risk of harm, not of death

<!-- -->

- Facts: night club's owner was in the hospital when a fire at his club resulted in the death of hundreds of patrons at his club as a result of a fire. 
- Rule: recklessness is present where defendant was  aware of but disregarded a grave risk to others  OR  where a  person  didn't know  they were disregarding a risk  but an ordinary normal man under the same circumstances would have  realized the gravity of the danger

<!-- -->

- Different from MPC definition of reckless which requires awareness - Massachusetts seems to include MPC negligence in recklessness

<!-- -->

- Reasoning:

<!-- -->

- Actus reus = omission caused death

<!-- -->

- As owner of club, defendant had a legal duty to his invitees to use reasonable care in keeping the premises safe for their use and preventing known dangers.
- "was enough to prove that death resulted from his wanton or reckless disregard" of safety protocols

<!-- -->

- Action / omission needs to be willful / knowing, but recklessness doesn't need to be

<!-- -->

- Holding: affirm conviction of involuntary manslaughter

## Recklessness {#slide-23}

People v. Hall

- Takeaway:  a risk of death that has less than a 50% chance of occurring can still be substantial, and thus, disregarding it can still be reckless
- Facts: While skiing, defendant collided with victim who was on the slope below. Victim died as a result. Defendant was charged with reckless manslaughter.
- Statute: Reckless manslaughter requires that a person "recklessly cause the death of another person." 

<!-- -->

- Conduct is reckless when the actor  consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk  that death may result. MPC § 2.02.

<!-- -->

- Issue: what's a substantial and unjustifiable risk?
- Procedural posture: not a substantial risk because not "more likely than not" to occur
- Reasoning: a reasonably prudent person could have concluded that Hall created a substantial, unjustifiable risk,  despite  it having less than a 50% chance of occurring

<!-- -->

- Standard of review: "reasonable juror" would have concluded that Hall created a substantial, unjustifiable risk 

<!-- -->

- Holding: this was a substantial and unjustifiable risk → affirm conviction of reckless manslaughter (MPC)

## Negligence {#slide-24}

State v. Williams

- Takeaway: civil / tort negligence resulting in death can be the basis for involuntary manslaughter

<!-- -->

- Note: this statute was later changed to require criminal negligence

<!-- -->

- Facts: mother and stepfather of baby were convicted of manslaughter for negligently failing to take their baby to a doctor when he had an abscessed tooth that became infected and developed gangrene
- Statute: In Washington, involuntary manslaughter is committed if the death of the victim is the proximate result of simple negligence 

<!-- -->

- Court applies reasonable person standard to negligence

<!-- -->

- Holding: this wa s simple negligence, and such negligence is sufficient to support a conviction of negligent manslaughter.
