## Criminal Law & Morality {#slide-2}

## Background: Debates About Role of Morality in Criminal Law {#slide-3}

- John Stuart Mill "On Liberty"

<!-- -->

- Addressed: When can the government regulate something? Which liberties shouldn't be regulated?
- Propositions: we should be entitled to certain kinds of freedom

<!-- -->

- Shouldn't be any interference with anyone's liberty  unless  society is trying to  protect  itself (protect social order / community)
- Harm principle: you should not in any way limit someone unless they are going to  cause harm  to someone else
- Certain interests ought to be considered as rights and shouldn't be infringed upon

<!-- -->

- Lord James Fitzjames Stephen 

<!-- -->

- Thesis: Criminal law doesn't need to just look at harm, it can enforce morality (always has and always will -- that's what it's about)
- " \[T\]here are acts of wickedness so gross and outrageous that,  self-protection apart , they must be prevented as far as possible at any cost to the offender, and punished, if they occur, with exemplary severity"

<!-- -->

- Hart: cosigns simplest version of Mill's harm principle
- Lord Patrick Devlin  "Morals and the Criminal Law"

<!-- -->

- "the law must base itself on Christian morals. . . . \[W\]ithout the help of Christian teaching the law will fail"
- "the law exists for the protection of society" / institutions so people can live together
- Tolerate maximum  individual freedom but express majority opprobrium in the criminal law - not mere offense

<!-- -->

- Hart-Devlin Debates

<!-- -->

- Hart/Mill:  Harm principle  = "the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to  prevent harm to others "
- Devlin/Stephen:  Legal moralism  = the criminal law is always based on moral principles and serves to  uphold a moral order

<!-- -->

- "Immoral" activities should be criminalized because they are immoral

## Debates cont. {#slide-4}

- Discussion: What would a reasonable legal moralist say about changing morals in society? Should the criminal law reflect that?

<!-- -->

- Key question: would reflecting that change serve the health / integrity of society? → Important to change the law because if law doesn't reflect people's moral norms, there will be chaos / uprising
- But maybe a change in the law helps push a change in moral norms? (i.e., abolishing death penalty spurred decrease in support for death penalty)

<!-- -->

- Arguments about legal moralism transformed into arguments about harm → collapse of harm principle

<!-- -->

- Now most people think harm principle prevails so it's inappropriate to just enforce morality (Hart won)
- So now legal moralists have to fit their argument about prohibiting "immorality" into ideas of harm, not morality = collapse

<!-- -->

- i.e., shift from drugs as victimless crimes but just immoral to "this is your brain on drugs"

<!-- -->

- But then in response to this, drug legalizers say "your war on drugs causes more harm" so now drug conversation focuses on "harm reduction" language (would reduce overall harm of these substances to make them legal) 
- SO  NOW harm principle doesn't help distinguish what to regulate, we're just measuring and balancing harms

<!-- -->

- i .e., regulate pornography / sex work because it causes harm to those involved, contributes to rape culture

## Griswold v. Connecticut (1965) {#slide-5}

- Harm/morality conflicts with constitutional rights
- How we define the right matters:

<!-- -->

- Broad: right of privacy (located in penumbras)
- Narrow: right of families to obtain contraception after consulting their doctor
- Why does what we name something matter?

<!-- -->

- When you find a fundamental right (essential to concepts of ordered liberty + protected throughout history) you get strict scrutiny (like race in EPC context)

<!-- -->

- Strict scrutiny:  there needs to be a compelling state interest + narrowly tailored to justify infringement on that right

<!-- -->

- If not fundamental right, rational basis review

<!-- -->

- In Bowers they found that morality was a sufficient basis to satisfy rational basis review
- Harcourt says this is where the Hart-Devlin debate is situated today -- this is where you argue whether morality justifies this infringement 

<!-- -->

- Holding: criminal statute passes rational basis review 
- Blackmun dissent: this violates the right to be let alone

## Bowers v. Hardwick  (1986) {#slide-6}

- Under pure harm principle, we would say that we  more than just a claim that the moral order will unravel to criminalize conduct → sodomy shouldn't be criminalized
- Under pure legal moralism, if this is beyond level of tolerance → should be criminalized
- Holding: majority fails to find "right" of queer people "to engage in sodomy" → can be criminalized

## Lawrence v. Texas (2003) {#slide-7}

- Issue: were petitioners  "free as adults to engage in the private conduct in the exercise of their liberty under the Due Process Clause"?
- Holding: morality is not a  sufficient  basis to criminalize this conduct (adopted harm principle)

<!-- -->

- Harcourt said that this was the first time SCOTUS rejected Devlin

## Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Org (2022) {#slide-8}

- Majority fails to find  "the right to obtain an abortion," "the right to privacy," "the freedom to make intimate personal choices" that are "central to personal dignity and autonomy" in the constitution

<!-- -->

- Note: Roe fit fight to abortion in privacy and in autonomy

<!-- -->

- Reasoning:

<!-- -->

- History of criminalization → against finding fundamental right
- Countervailing interest in life of the fetus (morality / harm principle come in here) → passes rational basis 

<!-- -->

- This is how Alito distinguishes this case from other cases involving right to autonomy
- Is the resolution of whether fetus has an interest / can be harmed a moral question? If answering that question requires a moral determination, then criminal law is enforcing morality 

<!-- -->

- Thomas concurrence: substantive due process doesn't exist

<!-- -->

- \*screaming internally\*

## Justifications and Excuses {#slide-9}

## Slide 10

![](ppt/media/image1.png "Google Shape;180;p22")

Note: MPC jurisdictions don't really use these distinctions anymore

- Excuses are partial justifications - excusable, but don't want to encourage it. Might excuse liability completely or partially.
- Fair warning matters more for justification (more clearly spelled out)
- Burden is on prosecution to say something isn't justified but on defendant to say they should be excused.
- Extending justifications to  third parties makes more sense that extending excuses 

## MPC: Self Defense {#slide-11}

- 3.04

<!-- -->

- (1) Subject to (2), (3), and MPC § 3.09, the use of force is justifiable when the actor  believes  that such force is immediately  necessary  to protect himself against use of unlawful force.
- (2) Limitations of justified use of force

<!-- -->

- (a) Not justified

<!-- -->

- (i) Resisting arrest which the actors knows is being made by a peace officer
- (ii) Resisting force by person claiming right of her property (with exceptions)

<!-- -->

- (b) Deadly force is not justified unless actor  believes  force is  necessary  to protect himself against death, serious bodily harm, kidnapping, or rape.  BUT NOT JUSTIFIABLE IF:

<!-- -->

- Actor provoked, with purpose of causing death or serious bodily harm, the use of force or
- Actor knows he can avoid necessity of deadly force by retreating, surrendering property, or complying

<!-- -->

- Except from home work

<!-- -->

- Unless initial aggressor

<!-- -->

- Except a police officer who's using force in their duty

<!-- -->

- (c) Except as required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Subsection, a person employing protective force may  estimate the necessity thereof under the circumstances as he believes them to be  when the force is used, without retreating, surrendering possession, doing any other act which he has no legal duty to do or abstaining from any lawful action.

## NY : Self Defense  (in  Goetz ) {#slide-12}

- NYPL § 35.15(1) A person may use physical force when and  to the extent he  reasonably  believes  such to be  necessary   to defend himself or a third person from what he  reasonably believes  to be the use or  imminent  use  of unlawful physical force by such other person.
- NYPL § 35.15(2) A person may not use deadly physical force unless he (a)  reasonably believes  that such other person is using or about to use deadly physical force, OR (b)  reasonably believes  that such person is committing or attempting to commit a kidnapping, forcible rape, or robbery.

<!-- -->

- Aka: can use deadly physical force if they reasonably believe person is attempting to commit kidnapping, forcible rape, robbery

<!-- -->

- Deadly force in self defense can be justified by reasonable fear of being "maimed" / great bodily harm (even if that harm isn't life-threatening)

What does "reasonably believes" mean? "Whether the defendant's conduct was that of a reasonable man in the defendant's situation"

Compared to MPC: addition of "reasonable" before "believes"

## Florida : Self Defense  (in  Zimmerman ) {#slide-13}

- 776.012:  person is justified in using force,  except deadly force , against another  when and to the extent that the person  reasonably  believes that such conduct is  necessary  to defend  himself or herself or another against the other\'s  imminent  use  of unlawful force. 

<!-- -->

- However, a person is justified in the use of deadly force and does not have a duty to retreat if:

<!-- -->

- (1 ) He or she  reasonably believes  that such force is  necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the imminent commission of a forcible felony ; OR

<!-- -->

- \[see other section for forcible felony definition\] 

<!-- -->

- (2) Under those circumstances permitted pursuant to s.776.013 \[home protection\]

<!-- -->

- 776.041: The justification described in the preceding sections of this chapter is not available to a person who:

<!-- -->

- (1 ) Is attempting to commit, committing, or escaping after the commission of, a forcible felony; or

<!-- -->

- \[Zimmerman would not be able to claim self defense if jury found he was engaged in a forcible felony\]

<!-- -->

- (2)  Initially provokes the use of force  against himself or herself, UNLESS:

<!-- -->

- (a) Such force is so great that the person reasonably believes that he or she is in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm AND that  he or she has exhausted every reasonable means to escape such danger  other than the use of force which is likely to cause death or great bodily harm to the assailant; OR

<!-- -->

- \[If jury found Zimmerman provoked, jury must find he exhausted every other reasonable means to escape to justify his use of deadly force\]

<!-- -->

- (b) ln good faith, the person withdraws from physical contact with the assailant and indicates clearly to the assailant that he or she desires to withdraw and terminate the use of force, but the assailant continues or resumes the use of force.

## Self Defense {#slide-14}

United States v.  Peterson  (D.C., 1973)

- Conditions for using deadly use of force (in self-defense):

<!-- -->

- (1) There must have been a threat, actual or apparent, of the use of deadly force against the actor;
- (2) Threat must have been unlawful and immediate;
- (3) Actor must have  believed  he was in imminent peril of death or serious bodily harm, and that his response was necessary to save himself; AND
- (4) These beliefs must have been  honestly  entertained and  objectively reasonable in light of the circumstances

<!-- -->

- Takeaway: Self defense is available as a justification when actor reasonably believes defensive force is necessary

<!-- -->

- Justification vs. excuse

<!-- -->

- "Necessity is the pervasive theme of the well-defined conditions which the law imposes on the right to kill or maim in self defense"

Questions of fact

Purely subjective

Purely objective

## Self Defense {#slide-15}

People v. Goetz

- Takeaway: "Reasonably" must be interpreted objectively and can't be solely based on defendant's own subjective interpretation. The objectivity of defendant's belief may be informed by circumstances of the case, e.g., past defendant's past experiences.

<!-- -->

- Maybe defendant's past allows for introduction of subjectivity

<!-- -->

- Facts: Four juveniles were in a subway car with defendant, who held a concealed gun. He began carrying this gun after a mugging a few years prior. One of the kids walked up to defendant and demanded \$5 from him. No evidence that the kids were armed, though some had screwdrivers in their coats. Defendant shot each of the kids, shooting twice at one whom he missed initially. He admitted to the shootings and told police he would have shot them more had he had more bullets.
- Procedural posture: dismissed the indictment because of subjective reasonableness (reasonable to him)
- Reasoning:

<!-- -->

- NY adopted much of the MPC but crucially added "reasonably" before "believes." 
- Interpreting the statute to say "reasonable to him" would render "reasonably" meaningless and would allow subjective views to completely exonerate him.
- Lower courts' interpretations would allow citizens to set their own standards for permissible use of force.
- Reasonableness inquiry happens with regard to the actual circumstances of the particular incident, including past experiences of the defendant.

<!-- -->

- Holding: Indictment reinstated

<!-- -->

- Note: this doesn't mean he's guilty -- this just means the case will keep being tried

## Battered Woman Syndrome {#slide-16}

State v. Norman  (North Carolina)

- Takeaway: to claim battered woman syndrome as a perfect self-defense, the threat must be something concrete and material at the time of the use of force, not an ongoing, consistent threat of abuse

<!-- -->

- Note: does this fit the reality of victims' abuse?
- Self defense remains rooted in necessity

<!-- -->

- Facts: Norman was badly abused during 25-year marriage. She shot her husband while he was asleep and was charged with first-degree murder. At trial, she presented evidence of suffering from battered wife syndrome as proof of a perfect self-defense. Jury convicted of voluntary manslaughter.

<!-- -->

- Note:the day before she killed her husband, he beat her really badly and she tried to kill herself -- she was clearly feeling like she was out of options

<!-- -->

- Procedural posture: convicted of voluntary manslaughter; defendant appealed; court of appeals found that jury could reasonably have found that she killed her husband in self defense
- Rule: self defense can be a perfect or imperfect 

<!-- -->

- Perfect: evidence, viewed in light most favorable to defendant, tends to show that at the time of the killing it appeared to the defendant and she reasonably believed it to be necessary to kill her husband to save herself from imminent death or great bodily harm
- Imperfect: when defendant is the initial aggressor, but without intent to kill / seriously injure, and decedent escalates confrontation where defendant reasonably believes there's  imminent  threat of death / great bodily harm → reduced liability

<!-- -->

- Reasoning: couldn't be reasonably believed to be under imminent threat of great bodily harm -- defendant's husband was asleep
- Holding: jury could not have reasonably found she killed her husband in self defense; defendant in present case was not entitled to jury instruction on either perfect or imperfect self-defense → no new trial

\*People who aren't women can also experience this but this is the phrase the case uses

## Duty to Retreat {#slide-17}

State v. Zimmerman

- Facts: 

<!-- -->

- Trayvon Martin was walking at night with a hoodie on 
- Zimmerman thought Trayvon looked "real suspicious," "Black," and "like he was on drugs or something" so called 911, wanting officers to come fast because "these assholes, they always get away" 
- Zimmerman followed Trayvon, though the dispatcher said "we don't need you to do that"
- Zimmerman claims Trayvon punched him in the nose when Zimmerman approached him

<!-- -->

- Charges:

<!-- -->

- 2nd  degree  murder: death caused by act done with depraved mind (knowing, purposeful, or reckless)
- Manslaughter: death caused by intentional act -- not clear whether negligence is enough to convict

<!-- -->

- Procedural posture: Stand Your Ground delayed arrest -- Zimmerman waived his right to immunity hearing (776.032)

<!-- -->

- Zimmerman could have had immunity - "justified and is immune . . . unless force is used against law enforcement officer" UNLESS probable cause (a big hurdle in stand your ground jurisdiction) that force they used was unlawful

<!-- -->

- Rule: Chapter 776: Justifiable Use of Force

<!-- -->

- 776.012
- 776.041: Provocation

<!-- -->

- Zimmerman's defense: he had a reasonable belief that deadly force was necessary to prevent great bodily harm
- Holding: acquitted b/c self-defense

<!-- -->

- What did the jury have to find to make this decision?

<!-- -->

- That Zimmerman reasonably believed there was an imminent risk
- If Zimmerman was the instigator: that he exhausted all other means to escape such danger

## Duty to Retreat {#slide-18}

- Traditional view: Only use deadly force when you've exhausted every chance to flee -- "back to the wall"

<!-- -->

- Some jurisdictions still use this to an extent but have exception for intruder in your home (castle exception)

<!-- -->

- Stand your Ground Statutes: permit actor to meet force with deadly force even in public spaces where retreat is possible

<!-- -->

- Discussion: State v. Smiley (Florida, 2006) - pg. 922 of 10th edition

<!-- -->

- Smiley, a cab driver, gave a ride home to someone who exited the vehicle and then pulled a knife on him; Smiley shot the man even though he could have driven away.
- Florida common law required retreat at this time
- Should the law require retreat in this case?
