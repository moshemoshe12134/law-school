## Law Enforcement  Use of Deadly Force {#slide-2}

Trigger Warning

Please reach out if you need help digesting the doctrine while avoiding retraumatization.

## Law Enforcement Use of Deadly Force {#slide-3}

Bradley Blackshire 

- Facts: 

<!-- -->

- Background: Bradley had experienced prior trauma with gun violence
- Bradley borrowing his friend's car; parked; officer pulled up and pointed gun in Bradley's face, ordered Bradley out of the car - Bradley asked "why," slowly started to drive away and lightly brushed officer; officer leaned into car and shot Bradley 14 times

<!-- -->

- Professor Shukur recovered relief through civil litigation

<!-- -->

- State offered to settle case for \$300,000

<!-- -->

- Had to dismiss charges against officer 

<!-- -->

- Advocated for monetary and nonmonetary (re training for high risk traffic stops + showing mother's video) relief
- Counts against officer (Prof Shukur errs on side on adding lots of counts in)

<!-- -->

- 4th Amendment violation - excessive force
- Monell liability (municipality): municipality's practice / policies / customs played causal role in Bradley's death -- failure to train officers in a way to prevent such incidents (requires smoking gun)

<!-- -->

- Note: officer involved was criminally investigated but state prosecutor didn't prosecute / bring charges because he suspected that officer would escape liability through law enforcement use of lethal force and didn't suspect jury would find against officer

## Hurdles to Recovery {#slide-4}

- Civil: 

<!-- -->

- Bradley's death left behind five children who need monetary resources; individual police officer doesn't have funds; hard to get money from municipalities unless they indemnify officer

<!-- -->

- Criminal:

<!-- -->

- Grand juries predominantly serve to protect officers

<!-- -->

- Prosecutors lead grand juries
- Note: grand jury of murder of Michael Brown was especially problematic in way state's witnesses were presented / questioned - used to give impression there had been a verdict

<!-- -->

- Defense of lawful use of lethal force

<!-- -->

- Constraints on use of lethal force

<!-- -->

- Statutory

<!-- -->

- NYPL 125
- NYPL 35.30.1
- MPC 3.07

<!-- -->

- Constitutional

<!-- -->

- (Give rise to civil litigation)
- 4th Amendment: right not to be seized without reasonable suspicion / probable cause

<!-- -->

- Use of force is a seizure of one's body

## Constitutional Limits on Law Enforcement Use of  Force {#slide-5}

Tennessee v. Garner (1985)

- Facts: person suspected of a felony attempted to flee; shot by police
- Rule: police can't use  deadly force  unless officer has probable cause (reasonable suspicion) to believe the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical harm (or committed a crime involving infliction / threatened infliction thereof) to the officer or others and it's necessary to prevent escape

Graham v. Connor (1989)

- Police can't use  non-deadly force  unless objective  reasonable  police officer  on the scene, under all the circumstances, including severity of the suspected crime, but not the subjective motive of the police officer

<!-- -->

- Objective standard 

Scott v. Harris (2007)

- Re police  ramming cars  

## NY Penal Law {#slide-6}

- 35.30.1

<!-- -->

- A police officer or a peace officer,  in the course of effecting or attempting to effect an arrest, or of preventing or attempting to  prevent the escape from custody , of a person whom he or she  reasonably believes  to have committed an offense, may use physical force when and  to the extent he or she  reasonably believes  such to be  necessary   to effect the arrest, or to prevent  the  escape  from  custody, or in self-defense or to defend a third person from what he or she  reasonably believes  to be the use or  imminent  use of physical force; 

<!-- -->

- EXCEPT that  deadly physical force may be used for such purposes  ONLY   when the officer  reasonably believes  that:

<!-- -->

- (a) The offense committed by such person was:

<!-- -->

- (i) a felony or an attempt to commit a felony involving the use or attempted use or threatened imminent use of physical force against a person; OR
- (ii) kidnapping, arson, escape in the first degree, burglary in the first degree or any attempt to commit such a crime; OR

<!-- -->

- (b) The offense committed or attempted by such person was a felony and that, in the course of resisting arrest therefore or attempting to escape from custody, such person is  armed with a firearm or deadly weapon ; OR
- (c) Regardless of the particular offense which is the subject of the arrest or attempted  escape, the  use of deadly  physical force is necessary to defend the police officer or peace officer or another person  from what the officer   reasonably believes  to be the use or imminent use of deadly physical force.

## MPC {#slide-7}

- 3.07

<!-- -->

- (1) use of force upon or toward the person of another is justifiable when the actor is  making or assisting in making an arrest  AND the actor  believes  that such force is  immediately necessary  to effect a lawful arrest.

<!-- -->

- LIMITED by 3.09

<!-- -->

- (2) 

<!-- -->

- (a) use of force is NOT justifiable under this Section unless:

<!-- -->

- (i) the actor makes known the purpose of the arrest or believes that it is otherwise known by or cannot reasonably be made known to the person to be arrested;  and
- (ii) when the arrest is made under a warrant, the warrant is valid or believed by the actor to be valid.

<!-- -->

- (b)  The use of deadly force is NOT justifiable under this Section unless :

<!-- -->

- (i) the arrest is for a felony;  AND
- (ii) the person effecting the arrest is authorized to act as a peace officer or is assisting a person whom he believes to be authorized to act as a peace officer;  AND
- (iii) the actor believes that the force employed creates no substantial risk of injury to innocent persons;  AND
- (iv) the actor believes that:

<!-- -->

- (1) the crime for which the arrest is made involved conduct including the use or threatened use of deadly force;  OR
- (2) there is a substantial risk that the person to be arrested will cause death or serious bodily harm if his apprehension is delayed;

<!-- -->

- (3) use of force  to prevent the escape of an arrested person from custod y is justifiable when the force could justifiably have been employed to effect the arrest under which the person is in custody, except that a guard or other person authorized to act as a peace officer is justified in using any force, INCLUDING DEADLY FORCE, which he  believes  to be  immediately necessary  to prevent the escape of a person from a jail, prison, or other institution for the detention of persons charged with or convicted of a crime.

## Law Enforcement Use of Deadly Force {#slide-8}

Saheed  Vassell

- Facts: 

<!-- -->

- Mr. Vassell was known by community and local police to be struggling with his mental health
- People called 911 and some said he was pointing a gun
- Police who weren't familiar with him showed up on the scene and claimed they believed Mr. Vassell was pointing a gun at them -- shot and killed Mr. Vassell

<!-- -->

- No charges filed against officers

<!-- -->

- Discussion: if charges had been filed, NY PL 35.30.1(c) may have applied 

<!-- -->

- Turns on police officer's reasonable belief that use of deadly physical force is necessary to defend the police officer or peace officer or another person from what the officer reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of deadly physical force

<!-- -->

- Not different from typical self defense case (reasonable belief, imminence, necessity)

<!-- -->

- Discussion: application of MPC had charges been filed

<!-- -->

- Differing witness statements on whether statements were made to Mr. Vassell to drop the weapon

<!-- -->

- NY  AG recommended changes to police process:

<!-- -->

- Re  911 calls / what dispatchers told officers: different training for dispatchers
- Reform public information policies

## Grand Jury Process {#slide-9}

- In New York state, almost all felony indictments result from a grand jury process

<!-- -->

- Unless superior court information after preliminary hearing in State Supreme Court
- Not required in all states - depends on state constitution; guaranteed in felony cases by Fifth Amendment

<!-- -->

- 23 people drawn from jury pool (in federal and NY: differs in states)
- Requires bare majority to indict 

<!-- -->

- "True bill"
- If don't indict, "no true bill"

<!-- -->

- Legal standard: probable cause

<!-- -->

- Not a high bar
- Grand juries generally just act as a rubber stamp

<!-- -->

- Indictment - charging instrument
- Closed to public and media and defense

## Compulsion Defenses {#slide-10}

## Necessity / Lesser of Two Evils / Duress {#slide-11}

- States choose between necessity, choice of lesser evils, duress

<!-- -->

- States that choose necessity often frame it as an excuse

<!-- -->

- i .e., natural disaster
- Focus on subjective feeling of having no choice

<!-- -->

- States that choose choice of lesser evils often frame it as a justification - social welfare is increased by choosing the lesser evil

<!-- -->

- Focus on objective / welfare maximizing

<!-- -->

- States that choose duress

<!-- -->

- Closer to necessity because subjective belief
- Threat is "do this act or else"
- i .e., someone has a gun to your head and you have no choice

## Statutory Definitions of  Necessity / Lesser of Evils {#slide-12}

MPC Section 3.02

- Actor believe s " the harm or evil sought to be avoided by such conduct is greater than that sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense charged"

<!-- -->

- "Believes" = subjective
- "Greater" = objective

<!-- -->

- Comment says it's not enough that defendant believes it to be greater (pg. 949)

<!-- -->

- Feeling of necessity and lesser of evils

NY PL 35.05

- "Such conduct is necessary as an emergency measure to avoid an imminent public or private injury which is about to occur through no fault of the actor."

<!-- -->

- No feeling of "greater than" / lesser of evils, just necessity
- Compared to IL and MPC: "no fault of the actor" added

<!-- -->

- "Clean hands"

Also consider those in Unger

Other note: some jurisdictions limit applicability of necessity defense to harm threatened by natural events

## Necessity {#slide-13}

Regina v. Dudley (Cannibalism case)

- Facts: 3 men stranded and their cabin boy were stranded 

<!-- -->

- Dudley (age 31, sailing master), Stephens (age 37, lots of sailing experience), Brooks 
- Parker was the cabin boy - little sailing experience and fell ill
- Brooks did not consent to drawing lots or to killing Parker

<!-- -->

- Parker was not consulted, but was killed

<!-- -->

- Parker killed - all three of the rest fed on Parker
- 3 men saved several days later

<!-- -->

- Charge: Dudley and Stephens charged with murder of Parker

<!-- -->

- Third man, Brooks, was prosecution witness

<!-- -->

- Reasoning:

<!-- -->

- There is a doctrine of self defense (pg. 91) but that doesn't apply here
- No necessity defense in England at this time (pg. 92)

<!-- -->

- "there was in this case no such excuse, unless the killing was justified by what has been called "necessity." But the temptation to the act which existed here was not what the law has ever called necessity"

<!-- -->

- Immoral -- we should follow example of Christ and be willing to sacrifice ourselves for other people

<!-- -->

- Discussion: would have been better / more Christian to draw lots and randomize or for captain to sacrifice himself 

<!-- -->

- Holding: death sentence (oh the irony)

<!-- -->

- Harcourt says law and morality are coextensive but only the king can give mercy
- Note: later commuted, not executed

## Necessity {#slide-14}

Regina v. Dudley (cont.)

- Discussion: other ways to resolve this case? Moving away from Christianity

<!-- -->

- Choice of lesser evils: utilitarianism

<!-- -->

- Parker was a less experienced sailor, wouldn't be able to help them get to safety
- Parker doesn't have family, so less of a loss
- Parker has more life ahead of him

<!-- -->

- Discussion: any deterrence value from sentencing the defendants to death here?

<!-- -->

- Unlikely people in this circumstance in the future would, under threat of starvation, be deterred because of threat of later potentially being sentenced to death

<!-- -->

- Harcourt says: maybe social welfare maximizing could be a defense (choice of two evils) if the metric to choose was morally right

## Necessity {#slide-15}

People v. Unger

- Facts: Unger escaped prison 
- Charged with escape

<!-- -->

- Unger's defense: he was being threatened and sexually assaulted by other incarcerated people so he needed to escape to save his life
- Jury instructed not to consider reasons for alleged escape as justification or excuse

<!-- -->

- Issue: was it error for jury to be instructed it must disregard Unger's reasons for escape?
- Legal standard for necessity in Illinois (IL Ch. 38):  the accused was  without blame in occasioning or developing the situation  and reasonably believed such conduct was necessary to avoid a public or private  injury  greater than the injury which might reasonably result from their own conduct

<!-- -->

- This sounds in lesser of two evils: "injury greater than the injury that might reasonably result from his own conduct"
- This also sounds in necessity: "reasonably believed such conduct was  necessary  to prevent"

<!-- -->

- Lovercamp standard: entitled to necessity jury instruction if the following are met

<!-- -->

- (1) Prisoner is faced with specific threat of death, forcible sexual attack or substantial bodily injury in the immediate future
- (2) No time for complaint or history to the authorities or there exists a history of futile complaints
- (3) No time or opportunity to resort to the courts
- (4) No evidence of force or violence used towards prison personnel or other "innocent" persons in the escape AND
- (5) Immediately alerts proper authorities when they have attained a position of safety from the immediate threat

<!-- -->

- Note: Unger didn't do this -- never informed authorities

<!-- -->

- Holding: not adopting Lovercamp - relevant but not required; a ffirm remand for new trial where jury is allowed to consider Unger's reasons for escape
- Dissent: unless narrowly circumscribed, this defense will lead to future escapes and lead to injury to police, etc.

## Necessity {#slide-16}

People v. Unger  (cont.)

- Court's calculus of harms according to Harcourt

<!-- -->

- Imminence of harm to be avoided
- Likelihood that illegality will avoid harm
- Mitigating harms of illegality
- Other alternatives to avoid harm

Note: In  United States v. Bailey  (1980), the Supreme Court held, contrary to  Unger  but in accord with Lovercamp, that a prerequisite for invoking the necessity defense in a federal prosecution for prison escape is that the defendant make a bona fide effort to surrender or return "as soon as the duress or necessity had lost its coercive force."

## Necessity {#slide-17}

US v. Schoon

- Facts: civil disobedience challenging govt raising funds for war in El Salvador

<!-- -->

- Indirect civil disobedience - not getting at war itself (by comparison, Unger would be direct)

<!-- -->

- Reasoning: necessity defense is a utilitarian defense to maximize social benefits

<!-- -->

- "Petitioning Congress to change a policy is always a legal alternative in such cases, regardless of the likelihood of the plea's success" so committing a crime isn't necessary
- Protested harm is never imminent
- The law / policy being protested is legal, so it's not a harm 
- Not a nexus between action and harm sought to be prevented

<!-- -->

- Holding: necessity defense is never applicable to cases involving indirect civil disobedience

## Statutory Definition of Duress {#slide-18}

MPC 2.09(1)

- Affirmative defense 
- Actor "was coerced to do so by the use of, or a threat to use, unlawful force against his person or the person of another, which a person of reasonable firmness in his situation would have been unable to resist."

<!-- -->

- Has a necessity component -- unable to resist
- More direct coercion (from another person) than necessity 

Also see that in Toscano

## Duress {#slide-19}

State v. Toscano

- Facts: chiropractor charged with false insurance claims

<!-- -->

- Defense: under duress - Leonardo had threatened his life and his wife's life
- Admits to having committed the crime

<!-- -->

- Rule:

<!-- -->

- No statutory duress defense before this case
- Turn to common law to establish a duress defense

<!-- -->

- Rule adopted:  "d efendant engaged in conduct because he was coerced to do so by the use of, or threat to use, unlawful force against his person or the person of another, which a person of reasonable firmness in his situation would have been unable to resist. "

<!-- -->

- Compared to MPC: same re "reasonable firmness"

<!-- -->

- But section 2 says unavailable if reckless or negligent in putting themself in this situation - imposing mens rea to question of getting oneself into that situation

<!-- -->

- Clean hands
- Different treatment compared to gradations 

<!-- -->

- Mixed subjective / objective test 

<!-- -->

- Holding: reversed and remanded for new trail so he can present a duress defense

<!-- -->

- Habib and Chris should still be having their sessions next week so I can find out what rooms those are happening in if you'd like to go to one of theirs / feel free to reach out to them
- I'll still answer questions via email of course (please ask them sooner than later)

<!-- -->

- Keep in mind - your exam is May 8 at 10am

<!-- -->

- I think I'll need to take a break from answering questions since I have 2 exams and 2 papers due from April 26 - May 3 but then can start answering your questions again from (tentatively) May 4-7
