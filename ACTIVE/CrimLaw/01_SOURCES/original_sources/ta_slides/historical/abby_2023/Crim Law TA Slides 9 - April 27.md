## Criminal Law {#slide-1}

TA Session #9

April 27, 2023

## Complicity / Accomplice {#slide-2}

## Complicity {#slide-3}

- A theory of liability that makes someone fully liable for the crime they aided and abetted (you're charged with  murder  NOT  aiding and abetting murder )
- Compared to conspiracy: 

<!-- -->

- Usually liability through complicity could be a conspiracy since two people worked together BUT the difference is that the charge of complicity merges into substantive offense where for conspiracy they stay separate

<!-- -->

- Requirements:

<!-- -->

- Mens rea: different states attach different mens reas (intent, purpose, knowledge) to different objects (the principal's mens rea, the underlying crime)
- Actus reus: can be aiding and abetting, soliciting, etc.

## Statutory Definition of Complicity {#slide-4}

MPC 2.06

- (2)(c) A person is legally accountable for conduct of another person if he is an accomplice of such other person in the commission of the offense.

<!-- -->

- (3) A person is an accomplice of another person in the commission of an offense if:

<!-- -->

- (a) with the  purpose  of promoting or facilitating the commission of the offense, he

<!-- -->

- (i) solicits such other person to commit it; OR
- (ii) aids or agrees OR  attempts  to aid such other person in planning or committing it; OR having a legal duty to prevent the commission of the offense, fails to make proper effort so to do; OR

<!-- -->

- (b) his conduct is expressly declared by law to establish his complicity.

NYPL 20.00

- "When one person engages in conduct which constitutes an offense, another person is criminally liable for such conduct when,  acting with the mental culpability required for the commission thereof , he solicits, requests, commands, importunes, or  intentionally aids  such person to engage in such conduct." 

## Statutory Definition of Complicity {#slide-5}

Illinois 720 ILCS 5/5-2

- "A person is legally accountable for the conduct of another when either before or during the commission of an offense, and with the  intent to promote or facilitate such commission , he solicits, aids, abets, agrees or attempts to aid, such other person in the planning or commission of the offense"

California (Jury Instructions)

- "Those who,  with knowledge of the unlawful purpose of the one who does directly and actively commit or attempt to commit the crime , aid and abet in its commission or who, whether present or not at the commission or attempted commission of the crime, advise and encourage its commission"
- "A person aids and abets the commission of a crime if,  with knowledge of the unlawful purpose of the perpetrator of the crime , he aids, promotes, encourages or instigates by act or advice the commission of such a crime"

## Complicity {#slide-6}

State v. Gladstone

- Facts: Thompson (police informant) sought marijuana from Gladstone; Gladstone referred Thompson to Kent by drawing a map; Thompson went to Kent and bought marijuana

<!-- -->

- For accomplice liability, it doesn't matter that Gladstone didn't sell / buy 

<!-- -->

- He becomes responsible for Kent's sale through accomplice liability
- He becomes responsible for Thompson's purchase through accomplice liability

<!-- -->

- Gladstone aiding Thompson's purchase becomes  "attempt" because Thompson was an informant (which Gladstone didn't know)

<!-- -->

- Charge: selling marijuana
- Holding: conviction reversed;  no evidence that Gladstone did anything to aid or assist Kent in selling marijuana to Thompson

## Complicity {#slide-7}

Commonwealth v. Roebuck

- Takeaway: accomplice need not always intend the result of the underlying crime 
- Facts: Principal convicted of 3rd degree murder. Defendant here did not directly commit the murder.
- Rule (Pennsylvania)

<!-- -->

- 3rd degree Murder mens rea: extreme recklessness
- Manslaughter mens rea: recklessness

<!-- -->

- Defendant's claim: can't be held to intentionally aid something that doesn't require intent

<!-- -->

- Note: a similar claim arises in the attempt context where the underlying crime requires only recklessness

<!-- -->

- Reasoning: if Roebuck intended to engage in the conduct that led to the death, it doesn't matter that he didn't intend the death / to shoot IF he was extremely reckless as to the result

<!-- -->

- MPC 2.06(4): "when causing a particular result is an element of the offense \[homicide  is a result crime\], an accomplice in the conduct \[ambush, lure, shoot, etc.\] causing such result \[death\] is an accomplice in the commission of that offense,  if he acts with the kind of culpability, if any, with respect to that result that is sufficient for the commission of the offense ."

<!-- -->

- If Roebuck was an accomplice to the conduct that caused the death, he is an accomplice to the homicide IF he was extremely reckless 
- Reads MPC 2.06(3)(c) "offense" to mean "conduct"

<!-- -->

- No logical inconsistency -- no intention to be extremely reckless required

<!-- -->

- Holding: conviction affirmed 

## Complicity {#slide-8}

People v. Luparello

"Luparello court found murder liability under its expansive doctrine of accomplice liability because the killing of Martin was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of Luparello's conceded offense of assault."

## Conspiracy {#slide-9}

## Three types of liability {#slide-10}

- (1)  Conspiracy : a separate crime / "crime to itself" that attaches to the underlying substantive offenses that are part of the conspiracy 

<!-- -->

- Substantive acts don't need to be completed to be charged with conspiracy (Harcourt says it's a bit of an inchoate crime)
- One charge for conspiring to engage in criminal activity and one for the criminal activity you conspired to commit - defendant can be charged with / convicted of both if the substantive acts you agreed to do were completed

<!-- -->

- (2) Liability for the substantive crimes
- (3) Conspiracy can create accomplice liability - substantive liability for crimes your conspirators committed

<!-- -->

- Can be held substantively liable for someone else's crime because you were a conspirator even though you might not necessarily have participated in that crime / if that crime wasn't an explicit part of the conspiracy (Pinkerton)

<!-- -->

- BUT here it merges: charge would be for the substantive offense (liable under a conspiracy theory)

## How to find conspiracy  {#slide-11}

- Actus Reus

<!-- -->

- There must be an agreement

<!-- -->

- Does it have to be explicit or inferred? ( Interstate Circuit )

<!-- -->

- Often (but not always) requirement of "overt act" towards to commission of the conspiracy

<!-- -->

- Some exception for most heinous felony
- Earlier common law didn't require this - fact of agreement was enough

<!-- -->

- Mens Rea

<!-- -->

- Knowledge of nature of activity
- Intent / inferred intent ( Lauria )

But! Renunciation defense (MPC 5.03(6)) 

## Statutory Definitions of Conspiracy {#slide-12}

MPC 5.03(1)

- "A person is guilty of conspiracy with another person or persons to commit a crime if with the  purpose  of promoting or facilitating its commission he:

<!-- -->

- (a) agrees with such other person or persons that they or one or more of them will engage in conduct which constitutes such crime or an attempt or solicitation to commit such crime;  OR
- (b) agrees to aid such other person or persons in the planning or commission of such crime or of an attempt or solicitation to commit such crime."

## Benefits to the State {#slide-13}

- MPC 5.03(4)(a) joinder → all conspirators can face a joint trial

<!-- -->

- Evidence against one person can influence the jury's perception of guilt of another person -- easier to  convince them that the prosecutor has met their burden

<!-- -->

- MPC 5.03(4)(b) venue → prosecutor has more choice over venue (where jury or judge is most receptive / punitive)

<!-- -->

- Wherever there was an agreement or overt act

<!-- -->

- MPC 5.03(7) statute of limitations → prosecution has longer to bring action
- Pinkerton rule - expanded scope of liability

## Conspiracy {#slide-14}

Interstate Circuit v. United States

- Takeaway: agreement needed for conspiracy can be implied / inferred from the circumstantial evidence -- there doesn't need to be direct evidence of simultaneous agreement

<!-- -->

- "It is elementary that an unlawful conspiracy may be, and often is, formed without simultaneous action or agreement on the part of the conspirators"

<!-- -->

- Interstate and Consolidated are movie theaters; 8 contractors provide the reels 

<!-- -->

- Interstate had independent contract with each contractor provided they ensure that

<!-- -->

- for any second run, the theater the contractor works with has to charge at least \$0.25 per ticket
- first run films can't be shown on "double bill"

<!-- -->

- Reasoning:

<!-- -->

- Though the contractors  / distributors didn't communicate with each other about this plan, they all knew that the others were listed on the letter so  agreement is implied (because each distributor had to know others were doing the same thing)
- Without Interstate listing all the distributors on that letter, prosecutor would have had to prove otherwise that all distributors knew about this deal 

<!-- -->

- Holding: affirm conviction

<!-- -->

- Each party can be charged with conspiracy and antitrust violations

## Conspiracy {#slide-15}

People v. Lauria

- Takeaway: intent can sometimes be inferred from knowledge

<!-- -->

- BUT with respect to misdemeanors, knowledge that his  products  are being used for criminal purpose does not, without more, constitute intent to participate in the substantive crime (leaves it open re felonies)

<!-- -->

- Facts: sex workers allegedly used Lauria's phone service to do their work

<!-- -->

- Lauria knows the sex workers are engaged in commercial sex -- prosecution says the fact of his continued service with this knowledge constitutes intent to assist

<!-- -->

- When can one infer intent from knowledge?

<!-- -->

- Special interest would permit inferred intent (none of these really apply here)

<!-- -->

- Stake in the venture 
- No other legitimate use for service 
- Volume of business is unusual 

<!-- -->

- "we do not believe an inference of intent drawn from knowledge of criminal use properly applies to the less serious crimes classified as misdemeanors"

<!-- -->

- Affirmative duty to "dissociate" is stronger in felony cases because of shared duty to society to prevent dangerous activities

<!-- -->

- Holding: this offense is a misdemeanor, so we can't infer intent from knowledge absent a special interest

## Conspiracy {#slide-16}

Pinkerton v. U.S.

- Takeaway: expanding the scope of conspiracy liability

<!-- -->

- (1) you are liable for the acts of a co-conspirator regardless of whether those acts were part of the agreed upon conspiracy (conspiratorial complicity)

<!-- -->

- If those acts were part of the agreed upon conspiracy, you wouldn't even need to go to Pinkerton liability

<!-- -->

- (2) broad scope + duration: conspiracy extends even though Daniel is incarcerated 

<!-- -->

- Court says "We have here a continuous conspiracy" because Daniel didn't withdraw (though incarcerated)
- Highlights other ways prosecutor in jurisdictions that reject Pinkerton can get Pinkerton-like liability (Alvarez reasonable  foreseeability )

<!-- -->

- Facts: one of the brothers (Daniel) was incarcerated; agreed to sell alcohol together
- Charged with: IRS violation for bootlegging
- Holding: sufficient evidence against Daniel to send the issue to a jury / maintain conviction

## Conspiracy {#slide-17}

State v. Bridges

- " Accordingly, we conclude, and now hold, that a co-conspirator may be liable for the commission of substantive criminal acts that are not within the scope of the conspiracy i f they are reasonably foreseeable as the necessary or natural consequences of the conspiracy.  . . .
- "The conspiracy \[here\] did not have as its objective the purposeful killing of another person. Nevertheless, the evidence discloses that the conspiratorial plan contemplated bringing loaded guns to keep a large contingent of young hostile partygoers back from a beating of one of their friends, and that it  could be anticipated that the weapon might be fired at the crowd ."
- Holding: co-conspirator can be held liable for the probable / natural / foreseeable consequences of the original agreement

## Conspiracy {#slide-18}

State v. Alvarez

- Alvarez expanded Pinkerton liability: Pinkerton liability attaches for the reasonably foreseeable (within scope of agreement, though originally unintended) consequence of the conspiracy: drugs, guns, violence go together
- In Alvarez, the evidence that supports the idea that murder was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the conspiracy" is:

<!-- -->

- (1) substantial amount of drugs and money
- (2) jury can infer that where there's lots of drugs and money, a co-conspirator is likely to carry weapons that could be used for deadly force

## Seditious Conspiracy {#slide-19}

Oath Keepers Case: Stewart Rhodes

- 5 counts against Rhodes, including: 

<!-- -->

- (1) Seditious conspiracy (18 USC 2384) 

<!-- -->

- Elements

<!-- -->

- Multiple people
- Conspire to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of laws (transfer of presidential power)

<!-- -->

- Mens rea re agreement: intent

<!-- -->

- By force

<!-- -->

- Can be very broad ("means what they want it to mean" - Tom Durkin)

<!-- -->

- (2)  Conspiracy  to obstruct an official proceeding (18 USC 1512(k))
- (3) Obstruction of an official proceeding - aiding and abetting (18 USC 1512(c)(2))
- (4) Conspiracy to prevent an officer from discharging any duties (18 USC 372)
- (9) Tampering with documents or proceedings  (18 USC 1512(c)(1))

## H ow the criminal law constructs and maintains the social order that we live in {#slide-20}

Trigger warning: violence against enslaved people

## Slide 21

Clarissa (an enslaved person)  v. State

- Takeaway: 

<!-- -->

- impossibility of fact re attempt - prosecutor must prove the weed is a poison and that must be  alleged in the indictment
- Awareness of social conditions

<!-- -->

- Allegation: Clarissa attempted poisoning the overseer and her enslaver by putting Jamestown weed in their coffee over the course of several days
- Issue on appeal: 

<!-- -->

- Propriety of the indictment

<!-- -->

- Indictment was inadequate: no allegation that Jamestown weed was a poison →  defective indictment (that the substance was poisonous needs to be alleged in indictment and prosecutor will have to prove it)

<!-- -->

- Re law of attempt: the weed would have to be a poison for the act to be attempt; belief that it is poison and intent to murder is not sufficient if this act will never actually poison someone

<!-- -->

- Note: same intent / blameworthiness 

<!-- -->

- Re grand jury: defense is moving for ability to ask grand jurors about their biases / preformed ideas of guilt

<!-- -->

- Court says no, if there was bias, it'd have to be shown later

## Slide 22

Clarissa (an enslaved person) v. State cont.

- Confessions:

<!-- -->

- Clarissa's mother confesses under torture
- Clarissa then also confesses under torture - not admitted at trial
- Confession at issue : Clarissa then is asked why she did it - she says she doesn't know unless the devil made her do it

<!-- -->

- Court finds this inadmissible --  because  of social relationship, can Clarissa ever freely confess? 
- Deceit tactics show need for further protections for defendants 

<!-- -->

- Court decides they  need to be even more careful in the case of an enslaved person because of the relations of power

<!-- -->

- "The humane policy of our law"  cautions against including this evidence in the case of a white defendant and the case for exclusion is even stronger here

## Slide 23

Wyatt  (an enslaved person) v. State

- Facts: Wyatt wants to speak to his enslaver after he is accused of burning down the gin house; Wyatt is tortured and told that his denials will only make matters worse - he confesses; in front of the justice of peace, Wyatt also confesses
- Procedural posture: conviction and sentenced to death
- Issue on appeal: admissibility of confession to the justice of the peace while his enslaver is present
- Reasoning:

<!-- -->

- Clarissa
- Rules of interrogation 
- Alpion's digest - ask general / open-ended questions to aid truth-seeking 

<!-- -->

- Held: inadmissible - fear of punishment by enslaver if Wyatt recanted, since enslaver was in the room; plus, judge did not tell Wyatt that he was under no obligation to confess; TAINTED confession, no longer voluntary because still under looming threat of violence

## Slide 24

Chariot race

- Takeaway: the race was about displaying / reinforcing the social order NOT figuring out who was faster BUT through his act of avowal he then reifies that order (shows internalization of social order, which may be stronger than the chiefs imposing it on him)

<!-- -->

- The same thing was happening in the cases of Clarissa and Wyatt -- upholding a system through legal rules
- As we have learned the law, we have often ignored the political economy of mass incarceration - Antilicus doesn't see how he's implicating himself in the social order; everything we do in the law is directly related to the social order -- underneath it all are relations of power

<!-- -->

- LAW IS ABOUT RELATIONS OF POWER
- We implicate ourselves in how we lawyer
