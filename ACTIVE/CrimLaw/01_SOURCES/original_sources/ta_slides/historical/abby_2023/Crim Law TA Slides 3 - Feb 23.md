## Causation {#slide-3}

## Causation {#slide-4}

- There doesn't always need to be a causal relationship between the injury and harm .  BUT , when the statute defines a crime with a cause element , that element must be found by the factfinder beyond a reasonable doubt (BARD).
- Vocab

<!-- -->

- Factual / actual / "but for" causation

<!-- -->

- Question of fact
- Necessary, but not necessarily sufficient, cause

<!-- -->

- Legal / proximate causation

<!-- -->

- Question of law - legal conclusion
- Assigned based on ideas of fairness and justice 

<!-- -->

- Loaded with ideas of foreseeability - if it was so extraordinary that you wouldn't think it would happen, probably not proximate cause
- Not too remote or accidental

<!-- -->

- "a possible consequence which reasonably might have been contemplated" (Acosta)
- "should have been foreseen as being reasonably related to his acts" (Arzon)

<!-- -->

- Intervening cause

<!-- -->

- Interrupts the chain of causation
- May  render defendant not liable

## Causation {#slide-5}

MPC 2.03

- (1) Conduct is the cause of a result when:

<!-- -->

- (a) it is an antecedent  but for  which the result in question would not have occurred;  and
- (b) the relationship between the conduct and result satisfies any additional causal requirements imposed by the Code or by the law defining the offense.

<!-- -->

- (2) When purposely or knowingly causing a particular result is an element of an offense, the element is not established if the  actual result is not within the purpose or the contemplation of the actor  UNLESS:

<!-- -->

- (a) the actual result differs from that designed or contemplated, as the case may be,  ONLY  in the respect that  a different person  or different property is injured or affected or that the injury or harm designed or contemplated would have been more serious or more extensive than that caused;  OR
- (b) the actual result involves the same kind of injury or harm as that designed or contemplated and is  not too remote or accidental  in its occurrence to have a \[just\] bearing on the actor\'s liability or on the gravity of his offense.

<!-- -->

- (3) When recklessly or negligently causing a particular result is an element of an offense, the element is not established if the  actual result is not within the purpose or the contemplation of the actor  UNLESS:

<!-- -->

- (a) the actual result differs from that designed or contemplated, as the case may be,  ONLY  in the respect that  a different person  or different property is injured or affected or that the injury or harm designed or contemplated would have been more serious or more extensive than that caused;  OR
- (b) the actual result involves the same kind of injury or harm as that designed or contemplated and is  not too remote or accidental  in its occurrence to have a \[just\] bearing on the actor\'s liability or on the gravity of his offense.

<!-- -->

- (4) When causing a particular result is a material element of an offense for which absolute liability is imposed by law, the element is not established unless the actual result is a  probable consequence  of the actor\'s conduct.

## Causation Analysis {#slide-6}

![](ppt/media/image1.png "Google Shape;158;p18")

## Causation {#slide-7}

People v. Acosta

- Takeaway: can hold a defendant criminally liable when the result was not highly extraordinary (low bar)

<!-- -->

- Opinion notes that there's not a uniform test for when something is the proximate cause

<!-- -->

- Facts: police helicopters crash during the police chase of Acosta → 3 people died
- Issue: did Acosta cause the deaths? Can awareness of the dangers on the ground be imputed to dangers in the air?

<!-- -->

- Was the helicopter pilot's illegal maneuver an intervening cause that disrupts the causal chain that justifies holding Acosta responsible?

<!-- -->

- Reasoning: 

<!-- -->

- Re actual cause (threshold question): but for Acosta's conduct, helicopters would not have been in the position to crash
- Re proximate cause: this result was foreseeable and not highly extraordinary

<!-- -->

- "Appreciable probability that one of the pursuers, in the heat of the chase, may act negligently or recklessly"
- It hasn't happened before because of flying skill, not because it's highly extraordinary

<!-- -->

- Holding: yes, Acosta was the factual and proximate cause of the deaths 

<!-- -->

- Note: but conviction still reduced from murder to manslaughter because no malice / mens rea

## Causation {#slide-8}

People v. Arzon

- Takeaway: independent intervening cause doesn't absolve Arzon because his act put fireman in a position where he was "particularly vulnerable to the separate and independent force"
- Facts: defendant set fire to a couch; the hazardous conditions and the smoke from an  independently  set fire resulted in a fireman dying
- Defendant's argument: no causal link between underlying crime and death → can't be convicted
- Rule: "an individual is criminally liable if his conduct was a sufficiently direct cause of the death, and the ultimate harm is something which  should have been foreseen  as being reasonably related to his acts"

<!-- -->

- Need not be "the sole and exclusive" cause

<!-- -->

- Reasoning: foreseeable that firefighters would respond to the fire; fire set by defendant was an "indispensable link in the chain of events that resulted in death" / added to the problem

<!-- -->

- Irrelevant that the other fire contributed to the hazardous conditions
- Compares to facts of  Kibbe

<!-- -->

- Holding: motion to dismiss murder counts of indictment is denied

<!-- -->

- Note: seems like he's only been indicted so far - this doesn't necessarily mean he'll be convicted

## Theories of Punishment {#slide-9}

## Overview {#slide-10}

- How to use this on the exam: explain how a particular punishment would / wouldn't advance certain societal interests

<!-- -->

- Can apply if you're criticizing a statute
- Can apply if you're asked to analyze a particular fact pattern

<!-- -->

- Various theories are at odds with each other
- Nietzsche: we've lost touch of what we're really doing with punishment -- we're imposing meaning on the practice
- What sort of social order are we trying to make through our forms of punishment?

<!-- -->

- Foucault:forms of punishment change over time

<!-- -->

- 19th Century / Industrialization: turn towards disciplining the body
- Panopticon: internalization
- Practices reproduce social hierarchies / regularization in service of political economy

## Utilitarianism {#slide-11}

- Goal: maximize social welfare
- Deterrence = prevent future crimes

<!-- -->

- Specific deterrence: deter this specific individual / defendant from reoffending
- General deterrence: deter others from acting like this defendant did by showing what punishment they'd receive if they did
- Bentham: Cost benefit analysis will shape individual's and other people's conduct

<!-- -->

- Punishment should only be used in order to "exclude some greater evil" 
- But are people rational? James Key Wilson: People are impulsive, irrational, don't do these calculations so can't think of them 

<!-- -->

- Incapacitation = keep a dangerous person off the street

<!-- -->

- Physically prevent someone from committing a crime
- James Key Wilson: certain people commit lots of the crimes → selective incapacitation

<!-- -->

- Rehabilitation = teach a person how to function in society to prepare them for reintegration

<!-- -->

- But do we ever see this happen? Think about difficulty incarcerated people have with reentry after being cut off from their families + collateral consequences (losing your job, effects on immigration status, loss of relationships, trauma, etc.)

<!-- -->

- Challenge: don't treat people as a means (punish to accomplish something about other people), treat that person as an end in themselves (individualized punishment just for them) (Kant)

## Retribution {#slide-12}

- Think about revenge, legally sanctioned expression of society's anger at the defendant

<!-- -->

- Punish them for violating the social contract

<!-- -->

- Goal: align punishment with blameworthiness / moral culpability

<!-- -->

- "Never use punishment for other purposes than to address the moral wrong"
- Punishment is justified to the extent the criminal deserves it

<!-- -->

- Challenge: see Marshall dissent in  Gregg  - retribution is not a valid purpose for punishment; it cannot justify murdering someone

## Capital Punishment {#slide-13}

## Process {#slide-14}

- Process today

<!-- -->

- Bifurcated proceeding: guilt and penalty

<!-- -->

- In guilt phase, jury decides whether defendant is guilty of capital murder
- Penalty phase can be determined by judge or jury or both (different in different states)

<!-- -->

- Until very recently, judge could override jury's mercy (judicial override)

<!-- -->

- Individualized sentencing consideration: defendant can raise ANYTHING they think is mitigating (Lockett)
- Appellate review (sometimes automatic)
- Collateral review / post conviction review: requires evidence from outside the record to prove

<!-- -->

- Federal habeas corpus = has already been convicted and sentenced to death, went through appeals based on the record, brought IAC claims,  Brady  claims

<!-- -->

- Remember Mr. Wilson's comment on the phone call: "it's on us to catch the mistakes" -- read more about Harcourt's efforts here:  https://cccct.law.columbia.edu/content/david-wilson-vs-jefferson-s-dunn  

<!-- -->

- If you want to learn more about IAC claims, Brady claims, Batson claims, etc., take criminal adjudication
- If you want to learn more about hearsay, admissibility of evidence, impeaching witnesses, etc., take evidence 

## Background  {#slide-15}

After  guilt has been decided, how do courts / juries decide who gets the death penalty?

Antebellum period

Comes from England

Automatic death penalty for most murders; not much jury discretion EXCEPT  jury nullification

Mid-19th Century -- 1960s

Complete jury discretion -- "matter solely and wholly within your discretion;" "it is entirely up to you folks" 

Constitutional challenges:

McGautha v. California (1971) --  due process  violation? no

Furman v. Georgia (1972) --  eighth amendment  violation? yes -- but result was unclear at first

Key reasoning: random, arbitrary, "wanton and freakish" application of death penalty

Guided discretion (post-Gregg)

Statutes upheld 

Pyramid statutes (Gregg v. Georgia)

Weighing statutes (Alabama; Florida)

Special questions statutes (Texas)

Statutes not permitted

Mandatory death statutes (North Carolina)

This is where we are

## Unconstitutional as Administered {#slide-16}

Furman v. Georgia  (1972)

- Concurrences

<!-- -->

- Stewart: randomness
- Douglas: concern with discriminatory admissibility
- White: infrequent → doesn't promote public purpose
- Marshall & Brennan: all death penalties are unconstitutional

<!-- -->

- Marshall: average citizens would reject this if fully informed of its excessiveness related to purported purposes
- Brennan: doesn't comport with human dignity

<!-- -->

- Dissent

<!-- -->

- Burger, Blackmun, Powell, Rehnquist
- "Long tradition and continued acceptance"
- Leave it to the legislature

## Current Doctrine: Guided Discretion {#slide-17}

Gregg  v. Georgia  (1976)

- Takeaway #1: death penalty does not per se constitute "cruel and unusual punishment"  in violation of 8th and 14th Amendments

<!-- -->

- Standard

<!-- -->

- Evolving standards of decency (Trop v. Dulles)
- Excessiveness = unnecessary / wanton infliction of pain AND grossly out of proportion to the severity of the crime

<!-- -->

- "We might not act as judges as we might as legislators" -- assume validity of death penalty because it was selected by a democratically elected legislature

<!-- -->

- Takeaway #2: death penalty for crime of murder does not per se constitute  "cruel and unusual punishment" in violation of 8th and 14th Amendments

<!-- -->

- Not rejected by evolving standards of decency

<!-- -->

- History and precedent (accepted by framers)
- Public support

<!-- -->

- Relative infrequency doesn't indicate rejection, just that it's reserved for "extreme cases"

<!-- -->

- Is not so without penological justification that it results in the gratuitous infliction of suffering

<!-- -->

- Retribution is essential to an ordered society (prevents "self help")
- Leave deterrent value for legislature to consider

<!-- -->

- Not disproportionate (eye for an eye)

<!-- -->

- Takeaway #3: address previous problems with juries (arbitrary and capricious administration) by guiding discretion
- Marshall dissent: reminds us of dignity of wrongdoer; the purported justifications for the death penalty are insufficient

## Permissible Statutes {#slide-18}

- Pyramid statutes

<!-- -->

- An aggravating factor raises the killing to first degree murder; then only those where the jury finds aggravating circumstance can be death eligible; then left to discretion

<!-- -->

- Gradual narrowing

<!-- -->

- Weighing statutes

<!-- -->

- There has to be an enumerated aggravating circumstance found by jury to put someone to death
- Mitigating circumstances must be considered
- Not tallying mitigating and aggravating - must weigh the circumstances in individuality

<!-- -->

- Special questions statutes

<!-- -->

- If you answer three questions in a certain way, you HAVE to sentence person to death

<!-- -->

- Penry  added a question that gave more flexibility re intellectual disability

<!-- -->

- Note: though aggravating circumstances are limited to those in the statute, mitigating circumstances cannot be so limited ( Lockett v. Ohio )
- Guided discretion allowed; mandatory sentencing not allowed

<!-- -->

- TENSION / dialectic: we want consistency but individualized sentencing

<!-- -->

- How to reconcile categories with individualization?  Gregg  compared to  Atkins / Roper
- Middleground of narrowing / channeling juror's discretion so there are patterns
- Scalia / Thomas: individualized sentencing is not required by constitution 
- Blackmun: because of fundamental inconsistency, just abolish the death penalty -- you can't have a fair, constitutional imposition of the death penalty → "no longer tinker with the machinery of death" 

## Modern Jurisprudence {#slide-19}

Atkins v. Virginia

- Takeaway: violates 8th Amendment to sentence mentally disabled people to death

<!-- -->

- Example of categorical decision, also seen in  Roper

<!-- -->

- Facts: during penalty phase, expert testified that Atkins was severely mentally disabled 
- Issue: does imposing the death penalty on people with mental disabilities violate the 8th Amendment?
- Reasoning: evolving standards of decency + "our own judgment will be brought to bear"

<!-- -->

- General movement away from doing this among the states and other countries + popular opinion + medical experts are opposed to this = evolving standard of moral decency is moving away from executing people with mental disability
- Di minished purposes of punishment because less morally culpable
- Independent evaluation: agree that death is not a suitable punishment in this case

<!-- -->

- Holding: yes, violates 8th Amendment -- excessive and disproportionate

<!-- -->

- Note : 8th Amendment is incorporated against the states by the 14th Amendment 

<!-- -->

- Scalia dissent: just because it's unusual (people don't do it much), it doesn't per se violate 8th Amendment; originalist = this isn't what cruel and unusual meant / was intended when it was written; you're just imposing your opinion

## Legal Principles after 1970s {#slide-20}

- Evolving decency: reflect out moral values
- Guide the jury
- Consistency: narrow class of murderers
- Individual dignity: individualized sentencing
- Woodson: no mandatory death sentences

## Slide 21

Steiker & Steiker "Sober Second Thoughts"

- The crutch of law allows lawyers and jurors to feel more comfortable executing people

<!-- -->

- Rules and jury instructions make us feel driven by the law / less like we're making the choice ourselves

<!-- -->

- Harcourt note: Chief Justice Emmanuel Shaw in Massachusetts was an abolitionist, but still applied the fugitive slave laws -- putting aside his conscience to follow the law / avoid their own morality

<!-- -->

- A key defense method: empower the jury to say "no, let's not kill this defendant"

<!-- -->

- Think: Marshall said in dissent in  Gregg  that if the public were better informed, they would surely rebuke the death penalty -- maybe they need to know more how these rules are failing and accept discomfort with executions
