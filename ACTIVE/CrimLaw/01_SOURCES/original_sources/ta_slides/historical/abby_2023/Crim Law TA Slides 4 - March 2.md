## Capital Punishment cont. {#slide-3}

## Race and the Death Penalty {#slide-4}

- Origins of capital punishment:

<!-- -->

- Race of perpetrator and victim affected what conduct was considered criminal

<!-- -->

- Common law not intended to protect enslaved Black people because not considered citizens (i.e., Dred Scott)

<!-- -->

- Post Civil War:

<!-- -->

- 14th & 15th amendment extended equal protection of the laws to Black people
- Strong federal legislation was critical to force states to recognize Black people as people and citizens and because Black people couldn't go to state courts for redress for racial terrorism

<!-- -->

- KKK Act of 1871 =  provided relief against state officials who violated  constitutional rights → Section 1983

<!-- -->

- Note: qualified immunity is an affirmative defense to this liability

<!-- -->

- Tool of re-enslavement of Black Americans

<!-- -->

- Black Codes - some were racially explicit and some were neutral on their face (but prosecutorial discretion, etc. still overcriminalized Black people)
- Convict leasing, sharecropping, and peonage
- Corresponded with shift from primarily white people in prisons to primarily Black people

<!-- -->

- Criminal law replacing property law as creator / enforcer of racial hierarchy -- CRIME AND PUNISHMENT AREN'T OBJECTIVE; instead, they reimpose slavery through ideas of individual responsibility

<!-- -->

- Law allows discretionary prosecution

## Slide 5

- Attacks on arbitrariness of death penalty

<!-- -->

- Relies on  8th Amendment which protects against excessive bail, excessive fines, cruel and unusual punishment, and arbitrariness
- Furman  /  Georgia  line of cases (see last TA session's slides)
- Current argument: it fails to punish the "worst of the worst" crimes, relies largely on irrelevant factors like quality of counsel (Stephen Bright), geography, and race of victim and/or defendant

<!-- -->

- Where does racism come in?

<!-- -->

- Professor Fagan: law enforcement officials have a higher murder clearance rate when the murder victim is white → dictates which cases are prosecuted
- Statutory aggravating circumstances provide grey area / discretion where bias and prejudice creep in 

<!-- -->

- i.e., "heinous, atrocious, and cruel" - what does this mean? 

<!-- -->

- Jury selection: relying on voter registration to call people for jury duty affects who's summoned from the start; and then use of peremptory challenges can be discriminatory
- DAs use racially coded dehumanized language to refer to defendant which helps jury justify sentencing defendant to death

<!-- -->

- Central park five: called children "wolfpack," "savage," "vicious"
- Rejon Taylor: "hunting," "stalking," "circling the victim," "wolf" -- have to "protect the sheep from the wolf"

<!-- -->

- The driving force of success in appeals process is race
- "Looking Deathworthy" effects of looking phenotypically Black most pronounced where victim was white (though all the facts of the cases where white)
- Glen Bates v. Ohio (2020) - woman who thought Black people were more inherently violent was on jury that sentenced Bates to death; IAC claim (counsel should have removed that juror) → new trial

## Race and the Death Penalty {#slide-6}

McCleskey v. Kemp  (SCOTUS, 1987)

- Procedural posture: federal habeas 
- Baldus study 

<!-- -->

- Differences in who is sentenced to death and who prosecutors seek death against based on race of defendant and victim
- Death penalty was most likely to be sought and inflicted when the defendant was Black and victim was white
- Isolated and eliminated other most likely reasons for this disparity

<!-- -->

- EPC 

<!-- -->

- Challenge

<!-- -->

- Different treatment for Black defendant than white defendant
- DIfferent exercise of prosecutorial discretion (choice to prosecute a capital charge) due to race of victim

<!-- -->

- Most disparity happened where there was most grey area / room for discretion

<!-- -->

- Standard: intent requirement; purposeful discrimination

<!-- -->

- Note: studies show disparate impact

<!-- -->

- Reasoning: intent too diffused, can't pinpoint a specific discriminatory decision

<!-- -->

- 8th Amendment

<!-- -->

- Challenge: cruel and unusual
- Reasoning: assumes validity of study, but finds the risk of discrimination is not constitutionally unacceptable 

<!-- -->

- Powell holding:

<!-- -->

- Re EPC clause:  not a violation because not purposeful / intentional
- Re 8th Amendment: not a violation 
- Baldus study is better handled by the  legislature
- Racism pervades the entire justice system

<!-- -->

- Brennan dissent: majority is afraid of too much justice

## Race and the Death Penalty {#slide-7}

- Suggestions for improvement post- McCleskey

<!-- -->

- (1) how could we have rewritten  McCleskey ? Barnes fake opinion

<!-- -->

- Instead of requiring proof of actual intent, look at the big picture / totality (Baldus study, historical background \[Black codes\], etc.)

<!-- -->

- (2) abolition
- (3) rethink intent 

<!-- -->

- Charles Lawrence - implicit intent because of unconscious racism

<!-- -->

- (4) litigate race under  McCleskey  to find the smoking guns 

<!-- -->

- At the local level: NAACP LDF, southern center for human rights

<!-- -->

- (5)  Batson v. Kentucky  model

<!-- -->

- Use a  three prong test to challenge the disparity and require a race-neutral reason from prosecutor

<!-- -->

- (6) Black on Black representation

<!-- -->

- Expand the 6th Amendment  right  to  counsel  of choice to indigent defendants to specifically benefit Black defendants

<!-- -->

- "Empowering indigent Black people to select,  should  they  desire,  Black  and/or  culturally  competent  public  defenders  has the  potential  to  offer  a  range  of  benefits,  including  mitigating  anti-Black  racism  in the  criminal  legal  system"

## Race and the Death Penalty {#slide-8}

- Where does  McCleskey  stand today? According to Stephen Bright

<!-- -->

- Court seems to think racial discrimination in the administration of the death penalty is inevitable
- State of Washington v. Gregory  - state courts can acknowledge racial discrimination claims; get more protection out of state constitutions than out of federal constitution as interpreted by SCOTUS
- Jury selection

<!-- -->

- Some states don't have peremptory strikes
- Batson lets us bring claims of racial discrimination in jury selection (as long as the facts are specific to our case)

## Representation of Counsel {#slide-9}

Gideon v. Wainwright  (SCOTUS, 1963):  6th Amendment is fully incorporated to apply to the states

- For felony crimes, the right to counsel applies in every case 

IAC claim must be brought in post-conviction / collateral review because it can't be decided just on the record (new evidence needs to be brought in).

Strickland v. Washington  (SCOTUS, 1984): ineffective assistance of counsel standard

performance was deficient - fell below objective standard of reasonableness as measured under prevailing professional norms AND

Presumption of effectiveness, or of tactical decision

that deficiency prejudiced the defense (did it make a difference)

Judge retrying the case without all the evidence

Possibility of harmless error

- Not fleshed out until 2001 - found to relate to lack of presentation of mitigation evidence at penalty phase, but court has been retreating from finding IAC lately
- Deference given to last state court to decide this issue (AEDPA)
- According to Prof. Harcourt, right to  effective  assistance of counsel is a pretty toothless right

<!-- -->

- Mr. Bright says instead we should focus on building good public defense offices to effectuate right to counsel

## Representation of Counsel {#slide-10}

As lawyers,  "Our lives are not our own. They belong to those who need us desperately." 

- Stephen Bright

## Sexual Assault {#slide-11}

## Introduction / Early Law {#slide-12}

- History is related to history of misogyny and racism

<!-- -->

- Law funneled sex into the patriarchal, heterosexual marital relationship and allowed it to be unregulated there

<!-- -->

- Demonstrated by rape statutes historically excluding spousal rape ("Rape of a woman not the spouse . . . ")

<!-- -->

- Wrongful prosecutions of Black boys and men of any behavior that infringed on racial hierarchy

<!-- -->

- Even just for being too close to a white woman

<!-- -->

- Told jury they can make inferences of intent based on "social relations" / that the defendant was a Black man and the victim was a white woman (Louis v. State)

<!-- -->

- Two lines come together when we think about the rampant sexual assault of enslaved people by enslavers

## Introduction / Early Law {#slide-13}

- Definition at common law did not focus on mens rea of the defendant

<!-- -->

- Focus on utmost resistance instead, which was demonstrated by "force" and "against her will" and in turn serves as a proxy for mens rea

![](ppt/media/image1.png "Google Shape;199;p25")

## Introduction / Early Law {#slide-14}

State v. Rusk  (Maryland, 1981)

- Facts: Pat agreed to drive Rusk home and testified that she repeatedly told him she didn't want to have sex; when she parked, Rusk reached over and took her car keys; Rusk testified that the sex was consensual
- Procedural posture: state appealed intermediate court's decision that there was insufficient evidence to convict

<!-- -->

- Standard of review for appeal of insufficient evidence: de novo in the light most favorable to the state 

<!-- -->

- Standard for finding lack of consent / that threat of force overrode consent: genuine AND victim's fear was reasonably grounded (objective) to remove need for proof of actual force / resistance

<!-- -->

- Court finds objective reasonable grounding / threat of force → lack of consent  in: taking of car keys; light choking; "you can't leave unless you come up to the house" 

<!-- -->

- Discussion: did the court need to cite more than taking of the car keys?

<!-- -->

- Statute (second degree rape): 

<!-- -->

- Conduct: vaginal intercourse
- Att circ: force / threat of force; against will and without consent
- Mens rea: none are explicit; adds requirement that threat of force provide reasonably grounded fear which serves as implicit mens rea (somewhere between negligence and strict liability - doesn't matter what Rusk was aware of / thought)

<!-- -->

- Holding: jury could rationally find that the essential elements of second degree rape had been established

<!-- -->

- " reasonableness of Pat's apprehension of fear was plainly a question of fact for the jury to determine" -- intermediate appellate court substituted their judgment for that of jury

<!-- -->

- Dissent: defendant's conduct under the circumstances was reasonably calculated to give rise to victim's fear; imposing "purposely"/intent mens requirement

## Introduction / Early Law {#slide-15}

State v. DiPetrillo  (Rhode Island, 2007)

- Facts: 19-year-old victim; 30-year-old defendant was the victim's boss
- Statute (first degree sexual assault):

<!-- -->

- Att circ: 

<!-- -->

- Use of force or coercion
- Any person

<!-- -->

- Actus reus: sexual penetration 

<!-- -->

- Note: second degree sexual assault in this state required "sexual contact"

<!-- -->

- Mens rea? No discussion that DiPetrillo needed to know / intend coercion or even be reckless about that

<!-- -->

- Issue: whether force and coercion can include psychological coercion
- Holding: can't use psychological coercion to prove force; must be physical force → remand for court to decide whether there was enough physical force alone to justify finding "force and coercion"

## MPC {#slide-16}

- Still includes spousal rape exception 
- Very quickly became out of date re sexual assault provisions

<!-- -->

- DIdn't envision subtle coercion / implicit threats or acquaintance rape

## Contemporary Law {#slide-17}

- Traditional rape law required force and "against the will;" reform focused on force to eliminate burden placed on victim to prove they hadn't consented

<!-- -->

- Harcourt says today and in the ALI video, we've seen a refocusing on consent

## Contemporary Law {#slide-18}

State in the Interest of MTS

- Takeaway: in process of trying to not interrogate into victim's mental state, they're putting consent back on the table with an objective / negligence standard
- Note: this is in delinquency adjudication but the court is interpreting the criminal law statute
- Facts:

<!-- -->

- CG said MTS sexually assaulted her while she was asleep
- MTS said they engaged in foreplay and then when she told him to stop, he did 
- District court found that victim had consented to foreplay but not to penetration

<!-- -->

- NJ definition of 2nd degree sexual assault: act of sexual penetration using physical force or coercion

<!-- -->

- Doesn't mention consent, requirement of resistance, or mens rea

<!-- -->

- Reasoning: 

<!-- -->

- Force is inherently satisfied by penetration -- lack of consent makes it sexual assault

<!-- -->

- Court rewrites statute: effectively  eliminates force requirement and requires authorization in addition (takes model from assault and battery; presumption that the contact was unauthorized); affirmative consent meets authorization requirement
- Reasonable person standard applies to lack of affirmative consent; no knowledge / intent requirement

<!-- -->

- Words and actions in light of surrounding circumstances constitute affirmative consent

<!-- -->

- Holding: 

<!-- -->

- any act without affirmative and freely given permission to the specific act is sexual assault 

## Contemporary Law {#slide-19}

Commonwealth v. Sherry

- Facts: victim alleged she was forcibly brought to one of the defendant's homes and forced to engage in sexual intercourse; doctors alleged she had consented to travel and have sex
- MA definition of sexual assault: sexual intercourse by force and against the will of the victim
- Defendants' claim: trial court erred in failing to give jury instruction that sexual assault required actual knowledge of victim's lack of consent and that caused prejudicial error

<!-- -->

- Note: this is in conflict with MTS's holding

<!-- -->

- Reasoning:

<!-- -->

- Won't subjectively inquire into defendant's knowledge / intent

<!-- -->

- Holding: won't entertain mistake of fact

<!-- -->

- If jury finds there was a statement of non-consent by the victim, defendant would be strictly liable
- Harcourt note: seems court misinterpreted defendants' claim as mistake of fact 

## Contemporary Law {#slide-20}

Commonwealth v. Fischer

- Facts: victim alleged defendant locked her in the room and forced her to engage in sex; defendant interpreted victim's "no" to mean yes / thought she was consenting based on prior encounters (mistake of fact)
- PA's definition of involuntary deviant sexual intercourse: lack of consent; forcible compulsion
- Defendant claim: IAC because lawyer failed to request jury instruction for defense of mistake of fact
- Reasoning

<!-- -->

- Commonwealth v.  Williams : defendant's belief (mistake of fact) isn't a defense 

<!-- -->

- Legislature must create the defense via statute

<!-- -->

- Since  Williams , legislature amended sexual assault statute: c ompulsion can be physical, intellectual,  moral, emotional, psychological, etc. and can be express or implied

<!-- -->

- Defendant argues we must consider defendant's mens rea to prove the crime so we must allow that for defenses as well

<!-- -->

- Defendant's lawyer's failure to argue for a change in the law is not a proper basis for IAC claims b/c not inadequate to fail to foresee court would change a law

<!-- -->

- Holding: defendant is not entitled to this defense

## NY Penal Law Section 130 {#slide-21}

130.05: Consent

- " Whether  or  not  specifically  stated, it is an element of every offense defined in this  article  that  the  sexual act was committed without consent of the victim."
- Lays out when there is a lack of consent

<!-- -->

- Under certain situations, there can never be consent (age, intellectual disability, in certain relationships, etc.)

130.25:  A person is guilty of rape in the third degree when:

- 1. If victim is incapable of consent for reason other than age;
- 2. If victim is incapable of consent because of age and actor is over 21; or
- 3. If victim did not consent for some reason other than their incapacity to consent

## Coming Up {#slide-22}
