## Questions About What Charges a Prosecutor Would Bring {#slide-3}

## Slide 4

- Criminal Homicide (§ 210.1)

<!-- -->

- Purposely, knowingly, recklessly, or negligently causing the death of another human being 

<!-- -->

- Another human being = born and alive

<!-- -->

- Envelops the following 3 categories

<!-- -->

- Murder  (§ 210.2)

<!-- -->

- Homicide committed  purposely or knowingly  (analog to intentional killing)
- Homicide committed  recklessly  under the circumstances manifesting  extreme indifference to the value of human life   (analog to depraved heart)

<!-- -->

- Would have been manslaughter but elevated to murder - merges felony murder into recklessness

<!-- -->

- Presumed if engaged in or an accomplice to a violent felony (robbery, forcible sex, arson, burglary, kidnapping, or escape) but rebuttable                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                

<!-- -->

- Manslaughter  (§ 210.3)

<!-- -->

- Homicide committed  recklessly  (but see above if also showing extreme indifference)  OR
- Homicide which would otherwise be murder, but which is committed under  extreme mental or emotional disturbance  for which there is a  reasonable explanation or excuse

<!-- -->

- Reasonableness determined from the viewpoint of a person in the actor's situation under the circumstances as he believes them to be

<!-- -->

- Negligent Homicide  (§ 210.4)

<!-- -->

- Homicide committed  negligently

## Spring  2003 Question #2 {#slide-5}

- Sorry, I was wrong, we can't do this one yet --  can return to this once you've learned conspiracy 
- Look at "student answer 2" for this one on courseworks to see a good example of how to lay out this type of answer 

## Spring 2006 Question #1 {#slide-6}

- What definitions are you using?
- Which character(s) should you address?
- What would you charge each person with? 

<!-- -->

- Start with: topic sentence saying what you'd charge with 
- Actus reus

<!-- -->

- What did they do to put them under this statute? What attendant circumstances were present, if any?
- Was there an omission? Why are we able to hold them accountable for an omission?
- Any  causation  issues to address? (is causation an element of the statute?)

<!-- -->

- But for 

<!-- -->

- Mens rea

<!-- -->

- How would a prosecutor reasonably characterize their mens rea? 

<!-- -->

- What did they know / what were they conscious of? What would a reasonable person have known?

<!-- -->

- What evidence can you point to to prove this?

<!-- -->

- What arguments might the defendant make to say they didn't have the mens rea / had a lesser mens rea?

<!-- -->

- Knowledge?

<!-- -->

- Who is likely to win this point?

<!-- -->

- Consider relevant case law on the point
- What are the deciding facts?

<!-- -->

- Is there a higher charge you arguably could charge but don't think the case for it as as strong? Explain.

## Sample a nswers {#slide-7}

- Kyles (principal owner)

<!-- -->

- Charge: manslaughter? Murder? Sample answers use both

<!-- -->

- Omission (cite MPC provision: failure to implement safety measures / correct violations

<!-- -->

- Defense: could not have been predicted, no  requisite  mens rea, no but for causation

<!-- -->

- Deal with the city

<!-- -->

- Response: still but for cause even if city acted negligently in making the deal 

<!-- -->

- Hollins Jr. (silent partner)

<!-- -->

- Charge: negligent  homicide

<!-- -->

- Less culpable than Kyles
- Omission: failure to investigate

<!-- -->

- Defense: reasonable investor doesn't investigate club's safety
- Response: general deterrence? Up to the jury to decide what is reasonable

MPC DEFINITIONS

- Braxton and Johnson:

<!-- -->

- Charge: negligent homicide? Manslaughter (recklessness)? Murder (reckless indifference to human life)? Sample answers give all
- Defense: stampede may not have been because of the pepper spray but because of shouts of terror attack, which couldn't have been predicted

<!-- -->

- Note: we'll talk more about defense of necessity after break

<!-- -->

- Response: knowledge of dangers of pepper spray can be assumed by their experience

## Sample answers cont. {#slide-8}

- Flores

<!-- -->

- Charge: negligent homicide

<!-- -->

- Allowed too many people in the club

<!-- -->

- Defense: wasn't responsible for the situation on the ground
- Response: he had responsibility over security guards, was negligent in his responsibility

<!-- -->

- McMannon and Jones

<!-- -->

- Charge: manslaughter? Negligent homicide? Sample answers give both

<!-- -->

- Because of fight, deaths occurred

<!-- -->

- Defense: no negligence because couldn't have known the risk-- damage caused is completely different from the harm they intended by their actions
- Response: 

<!-- -->

- Charges against firefighters? CIty? Corporations?

## Questions on Statutory Design {#slide-9}

## Winter 2013 Question #2 {#slide-10}

You  are  a  legislative  aide  to  a  state  senator  who  is  drafting  a  new  sexual  assault  statute  for your state and trying to compare existing statutes and case law. The senator has asked you  to  read  through  the  facts  presented  in  the  New  Jersey  Supreme  Court  decision  in  State  in  the  Interest  of  M.T.S.  (see  Criminal  Law  and  Its  Processes,  9th  edition  at  363-367; 8th edition at 318-322).  The senator would like the behavior that occurred in M.T.S. to  give  rise  to  some  kind  of  criminal  responsibility.   The  senator  asks  you  a  series  of  questions. Please answer to the best of your ability. 

1. If we enacted the approach taken in Maryland reflected in the court's decision in State v. Rusk  (9th  edition  p.  343;  8th  edition  p.  302),  would  the  behavior  in  question (i.e. the behavior that occurred in M.T.S.) be subject to criminal liability? 

2. If  we  enacted  the  approach  taken  in  the  MPC  Sec.  213.1(2)  for  "gross  sexual  imposition"  (discussed,  for  instance,  at  9th  edition  p.  358;  8th  edition  p.  315),  would the behavior in question be subject to criminal liability? 

3. Is there any state statute or court decision that you are aware of, other than those from  New  Jersey,  where  the  behavior  in  question  would  subject  the  accused  to  criminal  liability?  If  so,  what  is  the  language  exactly  that  would  criminalize  the  behavior in question? 

4. What  in  your  opinion  would  be  the  best  way  to  write  statutory  language  that  would criminalize the behavior in question without too great a risk of criminalizing innocent behavior?

## Slide 11

MPC 213.1(2)

2.  Gross Sexual Imposition .  A male who has sexual intercourse with a female not his wife commits a felony of the third degree if:

(a) he compels her to submit by any threat that would prevent resistance by a woman of ordinary resolution; or

(b) he knows that she suffers from a mental disease or defect which renders her incapable of appraising the nature of her conduct; or

(c) he knows that she is unaware that a sexual act is being committed upon her or that she submits because she mistakenly supposes that he is her husband.

## Answer  {#slide-12}

Because no evidence of force / threat of force beyond penetration, statute in Rusk wouldn't cover acts in MTS

How does this differ from holding in MTS?

Does it differ based on which witness's account we believe?

If the court believed she was sleeping when MTS had sex with her,  (c) might be met -- no evidence that (b) or (a) were met; no evidence she mistakenly thought he was her husband

court in MTS concluded the victim was not sleeping at the time of the penetration, meaning that MPC 2.13(2) would not be applicable.

What statutes have we read? What other cases include statutes that could cover this behavior?

Consider whether different states allow for mistake of fact defense

\"Penetration without consent is an offense. Consent to penetration cannot be inferred from consent to kissing or non-pentrative sexual acts alone.\" Criminalize \"Sexual contact or penetration without the affirmative consent of the victim, either express or implied\" with no mention of force.
