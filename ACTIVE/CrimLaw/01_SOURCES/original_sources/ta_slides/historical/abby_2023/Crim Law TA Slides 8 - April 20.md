- Your Exam: May 8

## Insanity {#slide-3}

## Insanity {#slide-4}

Yates v. State

- Takeaway: what sort of evidence can prove insanity? What role do experts play?
- Postpartum psychosis: form of extreme post-partum depression that can involve mania, etc.

<!-- -->

- Note: defenses depend on having medical history, which are generally more available for wealthy, white people -- therefore, disparity in how successful this defense is 

<!-- -->

- Facts: Defendant drowned her 5 children, trying to "save them from Satan." There was evidence of severe depression and attempted suicide. She received psychiatric help, to whom she told about visions and voices. Yates also suffered from catatonia (physical/behavioral symptoms associated with schizophrenia).
- Rule: Texas Sec. 8.01 

<!-- -->

- (a) It is an affirmative defense to prosecution that, at the time of the conduct charged, the actor, as a result of severe mental disease or defect, did not know that his conduct was wrong.
- (b) The term \"mental disease or defect\" does not include an abnormality manifested only by repeated criminal or otherwise antisocial conduct.

<!-- -->

- Complication for defense: Mrs. Yates said certain things that showing knowledge of what she was doing and that they'd be perceived as morally wrong

<!-- -->

- Harcourt says she doesn't seem to have been able to stop herself

<!-- -->

- Result: convicted; retrial; defense succeeded (expert testimony was false)

## Insanity {#slide-5}

M'Naghten's Case

- Defendant is presumed sane unless proven otherwise
- Burden of proof for defendant 

<!-- -->

- (1) at the time of the act defendant was laboring under such a defect of reason,  from disease of the mind , as not to  know  the  nature and quality  of the act they were doing OR
- (2) if they did  know  the nature and quality of the act,  that  they didn't know  it was wrong

<!-- -->

- Note: a mental health disorder is a precondition ("from a disease of the mind") - also brings in a causation question

## Insanity: Response to M'Naghten {#slide-6}

- M'Naghten rule was too focused on cognition (knowing) and not on whether they could control themselves. Even if a defendant knew what they were doing was wrong, maybe they couldn't help it. (Too narrow)
- Irresistibl e Impulse:  if the defendant is unable to adhere to doing the right thing  as a result of irresistible impulse

<!-- -->

- an inability to adhere does not exist unless the act is committed under an irresistible impulse which  completely deprives  the defendant of the power of choice or volition (high bar)

<!-- -->

- Durham Test:  the defendant's conduct was the product of mental disease or mental defect
- Davis Test: person incapable of distinction between right and wrong, or unconscious at the time of the act, or though conscious and able to distinguish between right and wrong his will has been otherwise than voluntarily so completely destroyed  that his actions are not subject to it but are beyond his control

## Statutory Definitions of Insanity {#slide-7}

MPC 4.01

- (1)  A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if  at the time  of such conduct   as a result  of mental disease or defect  he lacks  substantial capacity  either to appreciate the criminality/wrongfulness of his conduct OR to conform his conduct to the requirements of law

<!-- -->

- Considers both understanding and willfulness/control
- Does criminality mean moral wrongness or criminal wrongness? States differ
- Burden of proof: most states put the burden on defendant (preponderance of the evidence

<!-- -->

- Criticism of MPC approach after  Hinckley ; many jurisdictions went back to M'Naghten
- Federal Insanity Defense Reform Act of 1984 - M'Naghten type focused on cognition

<!-- -->

- It is an affirmative defense to a prosecution under any Federal statute that, at the time of the commission of the acts constituting the offense, the defendant, as a result of a severe mental disease or defect, was unable to appreciate the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of his acts. Mental disease or defect does not otherwise constitute a defense.

<!-- -->

- 22 states still have MPC definition

Texas Sec. 8.01 

- (a) It is an affirmative defense to prosecution that, at the time of the conduct charged, the actor, as a result of severe mental disease or defect, did not know that his conduct was wrong.
- (b) The term \"mental disease or defect\" does not include an abnormality manifested only by repeated criminal or otherwise antisocial conduct.

NYPL 40.15

- In any prosecution for an offense, it is an affirmative defense that when the defendant engaged in the proscribed conduct, he lacked criminal responsibility by reason of mental disease or defect. Such lack of criminal responsibility means that at the time of such conduct, as a result of mental disease or defect, he lacked substantial capacity to know or appreciate either: 1. The nature and consequences of such conduct; or 2. That such conduct was wrong.

## Insanity {#slide-8}

Blake v. United States

- Facts / Posture: Blake was convicted of bank robbery. He presented evidence showing that he required psychiatric treatment for at least 20 years. Expert testimony said he was had severe schizophrenia, which often manifested in psychotic episodes. 
- Issue: whether the jury instruction should have used the MPC standard or Davis?
- Reasoning: "substantiality type standard" chosen, under which Davis might have prevailed -- Blake would not have succeeded under Davis

<!-- -->

- We know that Blake suffered some mental illness under modern understandings, but Davis is too prohibitive/narrow.

<!-- -->

- Rule : insanity defense is available if the defendant lacks capacity to appreciate wrongfulness or to conform to requirements of law
- Holding: the lower court should have used a "substantial capacity" standard like in the MPC.

## Insanity {#slide-9}

United States v. Lyons

- Takeaway: more punitive towards defendants with evidence of "insanity" after Hinckley acquittal 
- Facts / Posture: Lyons was convicted of several drug crimes, which required mens reas of "knowingly and intentionally;" trial court excluded evidence of insanity (expert witnesses as to lacking substantial capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law)
- Rule: a person is not responsible for criminal conduct on the grounds of insanity only if at the time of that conduct, as a result of a mental disease or defect, he is unable to appreciate the wrongfulness of that conduct.

<!-- -->

- A general shift away from the MPC approach that includes willfulness
- "the volitional prong of the insanity defense---ma lack of capacity to conform one's conduct to the requirements of the law---does not comport with current medical and scientific knowledge"

<!-- -->

- Scientists can't measure it
- Risk of fabrication is greater

<!-- -->

- Holding: no more  Blake  rule

## Insanity {#slide-10}

Kahler v. Kansas

- Takeaway: due process doesn't require states to have an  insanity  defense (other than defense of not having the mens rea, which isn't exactly the same thing)
- Facts: Kahler was charged with murdering 4 members of his family. Kahler received psychiatric help and was on medication. Expert testimony on both sides corroborated the insanity defense. The jury convicted and recommended death.
- Statute: Under Kansas law, a jury can only consider mental disease or defect as a defense insofar as it shows that the defendant lacked the mens rea required as an element to the crime.

<!-- -->

- Mental disease or defect is otherwise unavailable for an insanity defense

<!-- -->

- Issue: whether Kansas' insanity defense (which abrogates the M'Naghten rule of moral cognition) violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments
- Reasoning

<!-- -->

- Mens rea is always a requirement, and there remains a defense of being mentally incapable of forming the requisite mens rea. Thus, there functionally remains an insanity-like defense (Can introduce mental health mitigating your liability in other ways)
- SCOTUS won't adopt one version of the insanity defense over others; the states can choose

<!-- -->

- Holding: no; due process doesn't require states adopt an insanity defense that turns on a defendant's ability to recognize the moral wrongfulness of the criminal conduct

## EXPANDING LIABILITY: Attempt {#slide-11}

## Intro to Attempt {#slide-12}

- A way of charging someone for an inchoate crime (did not lead to it's result)
- Issue re mens rea: did you have to intend to commit  the crime  OR to engage in  conduct that would have resulted in a crime  had you succeeded?
- Issue re actus reus: how far along must you have been? What must you have done?

<!-- -->

- Threat not enough

## Statutory Definitions of Attempt {#slide-13}

MPC 5.01

- (1) "A person is guilty of attempt  if, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for commission of the crime, the defendant:

<!-- -->

- \[Compared to NYPL: if same kind of mens rea, can be held liable\]
- "(a)    purposely  engages in conduct  that would constitute the crime if the attendant circumstances were as he  believes  them to be; OR

<!-- -->

- \[conduct crime\]

<!-- -->

- "(b)    when  causing a particular result  is an element of the crime, does or omits to do anything with the  purpose  of causing OR with the  belief  that it will cause such result without further conduct on his part; OR

<!-- -->

- \[result crime, like murder under MPC\]
- \[mens reas: purpose or knowledge\]

<!-- -->

- "(c)    purposely does or omits to do anything which,  under the circumstances as he believes them to be , is an act or omission constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in his commission of the crime."

<!-- -->

- \[about doing something that would possibly culminate in a result or conduct crime\]\]
- See 5.01(2) for what constitutes a substantial step that is "strongly corroborative of the actor's criminal purpose"

<!-- -->

- (3) Can be liable for attempt to be complicit under MPC 2.06
- (4) Defense of abandonment: affirmative defense, complete and voluntary renunciation of criminal purpose

## Statutory Definitions of Attempt cont. {#slide-14}

NYPL 110.00

- "A person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime when, with intent to commit a crime, he engages in conduct which tends to effect the commission of such crime."

<!-- -->

- Probably "such crime" = "a crime"
- Compared to MPC: specific intent requirement here - had to specifically intend the crime to be held liable under it for attempt

California 664

- "Every person who attempts to commit any crime, but fails, or is prevented or intercepted in its perpetration, shall be punished."

<!-- -->

- Interpretation depends on whether courts read an intent requirement into the statute (i.e., "intends to commit a crime"

Illinois 5/8-4(a)

"A person commits the offense of attempt when, with intent to commit a specific offense, he or she does any act that constitutes a substantial step toward the commission of that offense"

- Similar to NYPL - clearer than NYPL re "such crime / a crime"

## Attempt {#slide-15}

People v. Rizzo

- Takeaway: "c lose proximity " -- should cops have waited longer to arrest (if their goal is conviction)?
- Facts: four men drove to the bank looking  for  Rao, but were stopped by police officers before they found / saw Rao
- Issue: were the steps the defendant took before police stopped him enough to comprise an attempt to commit robbery in the first degree? (what does "tending but failing to effect \[a crime's\] commission" mean?\]
- Reasoning:

<!-- -->

- Clearly had intent to commit robbery
- Statutory interpretation of "tending"
- " law must be practical, and therefore considers those acts only as tending to the commission of the crime which are so near to its accomplishment that in all reasonable probability the crime itself would have been committed, but for timely interference" -- "There must be a dangerous proximity to success"

<!-- -->

- Analogies: "Men would not be guilty of an attempt at burglary if they had planned to break into a building and were arrested while they were hunting about the streets for the building not knowing where it was"

<!-- -->

- Holding: not guilty
- Notes case: Commonwealth v. Bell

## Attempt {#slide-16}

McQuirter v. State (1953)

- Prof Harcourt says this case shows pattern of racial discrimination against Black men who have engaged with white women → false confessions 

<!-- -->

- Note: this the the background of the criminal procedure revolution (need more protections for defendants so impose that from the federal level - can't trust states)
- Think also of the Groveland four (posthumously exonerated following coerced confessions) -  TW : re anti-Black violence

<!-- -->

- Facts: Mrs. Allen says Mr. McQuirter followed her 
- Rule: 

<!-- -->

- "to justify a conviction for an attempt to commit an assault with intent to rape the jury must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant  intended  to have sexual intercourse with prosecutrix against her will, by force or by putting her in fear"
- Kelley v. State (1911) - "In determining the question of intention the jury may consider social conditions and customs founded upon racial differences"

<!-- -->

- Jury allowed to use racial difference to draw conclusions about whether assault happened (doctrine based in different body of criminal law for enslaved folks than for white folks but still has effects up to at least 1953) - shows how the law enshrines racism / makes it legal

<!-- -->

- Holding: conviction affirmed

TW: anti-Blackness

## Why criminalize attempt? {#slide-17}

- South Dakota held no such thing as attempted reckless homicide, but some jurisdictions allow that.

<!-- -->

- Can't logically intend something that's reckless - but criminal law doesn't need to be logical, can be administration of categories based on beliefs about culpability.

<!-- -->

- Justification for attempt liability for attempted reckless homicide: equally culpable, just moral luck as to result / whether someone dies

<!-- -->

- Attempt liability criminalizes actions that would have been criminal had they killed someone, but same actions lead to different outcomes where punishment is different (but MPC says punishment at same level as commission).

<!-- -->

- Note: this discussion draws on ideas of moral blameworthiness, culpability, and moral luck and the accompanying gradations we've discussed throughout the semester
- Law and economics: marginal deterrence / incentive to not commit the crime supports argument that attempt liability should be punished less than completed crimes
