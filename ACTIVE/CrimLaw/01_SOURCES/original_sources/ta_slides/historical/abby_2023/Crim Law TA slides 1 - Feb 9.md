## Advice on for Preparing for Class {#slide-4}

- Identify the statute in each case -- note it just as you would note the holding, issue, etc. in other classes. 

<!-- -->

- Break the statute into actus reus, mens rea, attendant circumstances, etc.

<!-- -->

- Which facts does the decision turn on? What would change the holding?
- Do you agree with the holding?
- How does the case define key concepts? (i.e., common law mens reas)
- Pay close attention to where the MPC departs from what the states do in the cases
- Pay attention to the discussions in class regarding the elements of the crimes, the arguments for the prosecution and defense, and the nuances of the MPC/statutes in the cases  

## Other things to keep in mind {#slide-5}

- Your tentative exam date is May 8

<!-- -->

- Aim to take some practice exams before then - we won't have a midterm
- Exam format will be like the past ones (uploaded to courseworks)
- There should be plenty of Harcourt outlines in outline banks, but ask if you can't find them
- Your exam schedule will likely be more condensed this semester than it was last semester, so ask questions early!

## Elements of Criminal Law {#slide-6}

## Actus Reus {#slide-7}

- Policy: a  just punishment necessitates that it be for a voluntary, wrongful, or potentially harmful conduct that is specified in advanced by a statute
- Common law  requirements :

<!-- -->

- For criminal liability to attach, there must be a voluntary act or an omission (Martin v. State)
- Criminal conduct must be voluntary

<!-- -->

- Note from class slides: not voluntary if reflex, sleep, unconscious, hypnosis

<!-- -->

- MPC requirements:

<!-- -->

- Section 2.01 

<!-- -->

- (2) Involuntary acts:

<!-- -->

- (a) a reflex or convulsion; 
- (b) a bodily movement during unconsciousness or sleep; 
- (c) conduct during hypnosis or resulting from hypnotic suggestion; 
- (d) a bodily movement that otherwise is not a product of the effort or determination of the actor, either conscious or habitual.

<!-- -->

- (3) Omissions

<!-- -->

- (1) A person is not guilty of an offense unless his liability is based on conduct which includes a voluntary act or the omission to perform an act of which he is physically capable.
- (3) Liability for the commission of an offense may not be based on an omission unaccompanied by action unless:

<!-- -->

- (a) the omission is expressly made sufficient by the law defining the offense; or 
- (b) a duty to perform the omitted act is otherwise imposed by law 

<!-- -->

- Note: including tort law 

## Actus Reus: Voluntariness {#slide-8}

Martin v. State

- Takeaway: Criminal liability may only be imposed when the unlawful conduct is committed  voluntarily.
- Facts: Martin was convicted of being drunk on a public highway, but was arrested at home and taken out onto highway by officer.
- Statute: "Any person who, while intoxicated or drunk, appears in any public place where one  or more persons are present...and manifests a drunken condition by boisterous or indecent  conduct, or loud and profane discourse, shall, on conviction, be fined"
- Holding: reversed Martin's conviction b/c "appear\[ing\] in . . . public" needs to be voluntary to support conviction
- Policy: See Kelman,  Interpretive Construction  Article -- thinks this court took a too narrow time frame and Martin should've been convicted when considering his voluntary acts at T1  (intoxication and wife beating inside his home) 

<!-- -->

- Narrow time frame: "appears" as conduct 🡪 D wins 
- Broad time frame: "appears" as attendant circumstance 🡪 prosecution wins

<!-- -->

- Notes cases: State v. Low is distinguished because he could have avoided bringing drugs into the police station by disposing of them beforehand, though he was not voluntarily present at police station; see also State v. Barnes, State v. Eaton, Jones v. City of Los Angeles, United States v. Macias, United States v. Ambriz-Ambriz

## Actus Reus: Voluntariness {#slide-9}

People v. Newton

- Takeaway: If someone is unconscious (either mentally or physically), their acts are not  voluntary to satisfy actus reus requirement.
- Facts/Posture: D was convicted of voluntary manslaughter for shooting a police officer. He testified that he  had no gun during the altercation, but that he had been shot and was "unconscious or  semiconscious" until he arrived at the hospital. Medical expert confirmed that he could have  had a profound reflex shock reaction. 
- Rule: Where not self-induced, as by voluntary intoxication or the equivalent, unconsciousness is a complete defense to a charge of criminal homicide (Pen. Code §26(5)). 

<!-- -->

- Unconsciousness can  exist where the subject physically acts in fact but is not, at the time, conscious of acting.  

<!-- -->

- Holding: 

<!-- -->

- Prejudicial error to not instruct jury on unconsciousness defense when evidence of  such involuntary unconsciousness has been produced.

## Actus Reus: Voluntariness {#slide-10}

People v. Decina

- Takeaway:  Not all acts have to be voluntary for D to be liable. Here,  although action that immediately led to the accident was a result of involuntary activity (seizure), D voluntarily chose to  drive knowing his condition so he is liable.
- Facts: D drove car knowing he had had epileptic attacks that caused him to lose consciousness; suffered an attack while driving and killed 4  people. 
- Statute: "A person who operates or drives any vehicle of any kind in a reckless or culpably negligent manner, whereby a human being is killed is guilty of criminal negligence in the operation of a vehicle resulting in death."
- Rule: A criminal defendant who disregards the consequences that can result from driving a  vehicle with knowledge of a health condition that can produce involuntary actions may be  found guilty of vehicular homicide. 
- Reasoning: The earlier voluntary act of getting into the car and driving it satisfies the "voluntary act" element of the crime.
- Holding: Ds awareness of his condition and decision to still drive render him liable for culpable  negligence. 

<!-- -->

- Court draws distinction b/w foreseeability from known condition and unexpected  heart attack (no liability).

## Actus Reus: Omissions {#slide-11}

Jones v. United States

- Takeaway: In order for a D to be convicted of an omission, the prosecution must prove that the D  was under a legal duty to act.
- Facts: Jones, family friend, found guilty of involuntary manslaughter through failure to provide for  10-month old baby of Shirley Green. Conflicting evidence as to how long Green lived w/D, whether she had agreed to care for the baby,  and whether D was paid for taking care of baby. Uncontested that D had financial means to care for the child.
- Rule: "The duty neglected must be a legal duty, and not a mere moral obligation. It must be a duty imposed by law or by contract, and the omission to perform the duty must be the immediate and direct cause of death." (Beardsley)
- Holding: reversed and remanded conviction b/c trial court failed to provide jury instruction on  necessity for finding legal duty of care despite factual inconsistencies

<!-- -->

- Where is a failure to act a breach of a legal duty?

<!-- -->

- (1) statute -- imposes duty to care for another 
- (2) status -- one stands in certain status relationship to another (parent to child) 
- (3) contractual duty to care for another 
- (4) seclusion -- voluntarily assumed care and prevent others from rendering aid

<!-- -->

- Notes cases: Commonwealth v. Pestinikas - conviction upheld after agreeing to feed someone but then letting him starve

## MPC  Mens Rea {#slide-12}

![](ppt/media/image2.png "Google Shape;197;p24")

## MPC Mens Rea {#slide-13}

- MPC § 2.02(1) 

<!-- -->

- Criminal statutes must have a mens rea

<!-- -->

- MPC § 2.02(3)

<!-- -->

- Default mens rea is recklessness.
- This is because (1) a prosecutor wouldn't go for the higher mens rea and make it unnecessarily harder for her case; and (2) a jury wouldn't need a higher mens rea to convict.

<!-- -->

- MPC § 2.02(4)

<!-- -->

- Unless there is a clearly contrary purpose, the mens rea that attaches to the actus reus attaches to the other elements of the crime (generalizability)

<!-- -->

- MPC § 2.02(5)

<!-- -->

- Proving one mens rea also proves every mens rea "below" the proven level of culpability.

<!-- -->

- MPC § 2.02(7)

<!-- -->

- Knowledge is satisfied when the person is aware of a high probability unless the person believes otherwise.

<!-- -->

- MPC § 2.02(9)

<!-- -->

- Knowledge of the law that defines an offense is not an element of the offense, unless otherwise stated. Ignorance is no defense.

## MPC  Mens Rea {#slide-14}

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

- Knowledge of the law that defines an offense is not an element of the offense, unless otherwise stated. Ignorance is no defense.

## Note on Common Law Mens Rea Vocab {#slide-15}

- C ite a specific case / use that definition since there's not a single, generally accepted meaning of a lot of these words (not codified like MPC) 
- Specific intent: intend the actions with a further objective

<!-- -->

- I.e., burglarizing - intent to break and enter with the further intent of committing a felony inside

<!-- -->

- General intent: intent to do an act without any further purpose

## Mens Rea {#slide-16}

Regina v. Cunningham

- Takeaway: mens rea of malice/maliciousness requires at least recklessness
- Facts: Cunningham tore a gas meter from the gas pipes and stole it. He did not turn off the gas, which caused a great volume of gas to escape and partially asphyxiate Mrs. Wade (his prospective mother-in-law) who lived next door.
- Charged with "unlawfully and maliciously caus\[ing\] to be taken"
- "Maliciously" is either (1) an intention  to do particular harm or (2) recklessness of doing an action when harm is  foreseeable. 

<!-- -->

- Defendant is liable because he was reckless, though he didn't intend harm
- Negligence is not enough to satisfy mens rea of malice

<!-- -->

- Holding: trial court erred in jury instructions by saying malice meant wickedness

## Mens Rea {#slide-17}

Regina v. Faulkner

- Takeaway: maliciousness requires being intentional and  wilful ; can't transfer intent from lesser primary  felony  to the collateral felony
- Issue: If, while a person is engaging in a felony, they accidentally do some collateral act, that if done intentionally would be unlawful, should they be found guilty?
- If another felony occurs accidentally (burning down ship) during the course of your primary felony (stealing bottles of rum on a ship), court must engage in mens rea (malice) inquiry for  each felony separately. Cannot convict D of collateral felony just for having sufficient mens rea for the first. No transferred intent or proximate cause even if one felony was a consequence of the other.
- Holding: defendant can't be convicted for an act that is the unintended and unforeseeable consequence of a lesser offense. In order to maliciously set fire to the ship, defendant must have acted intentionally and willfully.

## Mens Rea {#slide-18}

State v. Hazelwood

- Takeaway:  sometimes civil negligence can be sufficient to satisfy mens rea of criminal negligence  

<!-- -->

- Utilitarian approach: criminal penalties will only be imposed when conduct is something society can deter

<!-- -->

- Key to deciding what level of intent is the minimum for a particular offense 🡪 when an  expectation of individual conformity is reasonable

<!-- -->

- Facts: oil tanker captain ran his ship aground on a reef → 11 million gallons of oil spilled
- Statute: offense for any person to "discharge, cause to be discharged, or permit the discharge of  petroleum... upon waters or land of the state" when done "negligently"  
- Holding: ordinary negligence standard can be applied to the criminal statute, even though criminal negligence would have posed a higher burden for prosecution

Santillanes v. New Mexico

- Takeaway: sometimes c riminal negligence must be found to find a negligence mens rea

<!-- -->

- Retributivist approach: statute is meant to punish conduct that is morally culpable.  

<!-- -->

- Facts / Posture: Defendant cut his seven-year-old nephew's neck with a knife during an altercation; trial judge gave the jury a standard civil definition of negligence
- Statute: defined child abuse as "negligently causing a child to be placed in a situation that may endanger the child's life or health"
- Reasoning: mens rea should be higher than the civil one to justify accompanying "social opprobrium" 
- Holding: civil negligence can't be used

What type of negligence is required for negligence mens rea?

## Mens Rea {#slide-19}

Elonis v. United States (2015)

- Takeaway: When there is no clear mens rea, use the statutory text to interpret one into the statute. If one cannot be read into the statute, apply the default rules of the jurisdiction.

<!-- -->

- MPC says that default in those jurisdictions is recklessness

<!-- -->

- Facts / Posture: Defendant was convicted of communicating online threats to ex-wife & Kindergarten class through Facebook posts, which contained violent rap lyrics
- Statute: 18 U.S.C. § 875(c) makes it a crime to transmit in interstate commerce "any communication containing any threat to . . . injure the person of another."
- Reasoning: There is no mens rea requirement in the statute. But the Court generally reads into criminal statutes a mens rea requirement, even if a statute does not contain one. Criminality requires a minimum of negligence. A guilty mind is a necessary element in the indictment and proof of every crime.
- Holding: mens rea is required; in this case, a finding of at least negligence, if not recklessness, was required to convict

## Constitutional Limits on Punishment {#slide-20}

## Legality {#slide-21}

There must be fair warning / notice of the nature of the conduct that constitutes an offense - Due Process (14th Amendment)

Keeler v. Superior Court

- Takeaway: due process requires fair warning, which limits unforeseeable judicial expansion of statutory interpretation
- Facts: man assaulted pregnant wife → premature delivery of child; unintentionally caused death of child 
- Statute at issue: California penal code section 187: murder is unlawful killing of human being with malice aforethought

<!-- -->

- Mens rea: malice aforethought (no one knows what that means but sounds like intentional)
- Actus reus: unlawful killing of a human being

<!-- -->

- Jurisdictional problem: all crimes in CA must be defined in the statute -- is a fetus a human?
- Constitutional problem: can't be punished unless there's fair warning, which needs to be specific to this act / crime
- Holding: nothing in this statute to suggest feticide could constitute homicide so that's something for legislature to decide and amend later; violates 14th Amendment due process
- Notes cases: People v. Davis, Bei Bei Shuai v. State

## Legality {#slide-22}

Rogers v. Tennessee

- Takeaway: Judiciary can change common law rules and apply to case at bar if change was not (1) unexpected or (2) unjustified/indefensible.  No fair warning issue as long as prior 2 requirements  are satisfied.

<!-- -->

- Change from  Keeler  - this is a SCOTUS case / came after  Keeler  so it rules → consider scientific advancements

<!-- -->

- Facts: Tennessee decided to abolish the "1 year & a  day" rule (only murder if V dies w/in that time) b/c original justifications for rule were no longer applicable due to medical advancements
- Holding: no due process violation
- Scalia dissent: no fair warning; retroactive change was not predictable
- Notes cases: State v. Picotte, Ex parte Key, People v. LaRosa, Miller v. State

## Legality {#slide-23}

Tomlin v. Hetzel brief

- Takeaway: unforeseeable and indefensible retroactive change between commission of crime and trial  violates due process right to fair notice
- Facts: Tomlin sentenced to life imprisonment w/out possibility of parole.
- Issue: does LWOP violate due process right to fair notice ( Bouie v. City of Columbia )?
- Bouie / Rogers rule: when  a  "judicial  construction  of  a  criminal statute  is  unexpected  and  indefensible  by  reference  to  the  law  which  had been  expressed  prior  to  the  conduct  in  issue,  \[the  construction\]  must  not  be given  retroactive  effect."
- Reasoning : 1975 Alabama Death Penalty Act requires a finding of one or more aggravating circumstances from Sec. 6 to have death penalty sentence (Sec. 6 does not include double intentional murder). No aggravating circumstances in Tomlin's case, thus court "depart\[ing\] downward" from death penalty sentence is an improper retroactive application of Beck, Kyzer, Hays, or Stephens (which were decided between commission of crime and final trial), which  were unforeseeable and indefensible in 1977-78 (when the crime was committed)
- Holding: yes, violates due process right to fair notice

## Vagueness {#slide-24}

Problem with vagueness: too much discretion and too little notice (Due Process - 14th Amendment) → "void for vagueness"

Morales v. Chicago

- Takeaway: An ordinance violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment if it is so vague  that it fails to provide sufficient notice to citizens regarding the type of conduct prohibited and  fails to provide adequate guidelines for law enforcement officers.
- Statute:  Gang Congregation Ordinance prohibits "criminal street gang members" from "loitering" with  one another in public places. Four predicates: (1) police officer must reasonably believe at least  one person in "public place" is a "criminal street gang member;" (2) persons must be "loitering"  ("remaining in any one place with no apparent purpose"); (3) officer must order all persons to  disperse from the area; (4) person must disobey, and whether gang member or not, violates  ordinance if disobeys

<!-- -->

- What are the vague portions? "to remain in any one place with no apparent purpose" + "shall order all  such persons to disperse and remove themselves from the area"

<!-- -->

- Holding: ordinance violates 14th Am DP Clause for vagueness b/c affords absolute  discretion to police  and too little notice to citizens.

<!-- -->

- if ordinance had second specific element in addition to loitering, would probably  be constitutional

<!-- -->

- Dissent:(Thomas, CJ, Scalia): Order to disperse is not vague and what constitutes loitering is  common sense.

## Vagueness {#slide-25}

Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville

- Takeaway: reflects value of clearly defined laws to limit police's  moment-to-moment decisions and protect people's freedom 
- Issue: violation of 14th amendment due process clause?
- Reasoning: failure to give notice + too much discretion; "makes criminal activities which by modern standards are normally innocent" / reflect a sort of freedom we value as a country
- Holding: statute is void for vagueness / violates 14 amendment due process
- Note: statute was changed too "It is unlawful for any person to loiter or prowl in a place, at a time or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals, under circumstances that warrant a justifiable and reasonable alarm or immediate concern for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity"
- Notes cases: Cox v. Louisiana, Johnson v. Athens-Clarke County, State v. Showens, Silvar v. District Court, State v. Mello, Nash v. United States, United States v. Ragen, State v. Pomianek, Johnson v. United States, State v. Stanko, Terry v. Ohio, Floyd v. City of New York, 

## Status Crimes {#slide-26}

Problems with status crimes: no actus reus; creates continual criminal liability; punishment based on unchangeable characteristic

Robinson v. California

- Takeaway: criminalizing addiction alone violates 8th and 14th Amendment
- Facts: Robinson convicted of being addicted to narcotics
- Reasoning: addiction is an illness; defendant didn't use narcotics in the state (no actus reus)
- Holding: violates 8th and 14th Amendment 
- Harlan concurrence: does not agree that it's cruel and unusual but disagrees with jury instruction that "bare desire" to use narcotics was enough to convict (no actus reus)

## Status Crimes {#slide-27}

P owell v. Texas

- Takeaway: punishment for an act - even as a result of an addiction - is not per se unconstitutional 
- Facts: expert testified that defendant knew difference b/w right and wrong when sober and that first drink was voluntary w/qualification that voluntary exercise was influenced by "compulsion" of alcohol.
- Statute: Texas Penal Code Art. 477, "Whoever shall get drunk or be found in a state of  intoxication in any public place, or at any private house except his own, shall be fined not  exceeding one hundred dollars."
- Reasoning: The punishment of conduct that is symptomatic of chronic alcoholism is not in violation of  the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments' proscription against cruel and unusual punishment.
- Holding: does not violate cruel and unusual punishment - not enough facts to find alcoholism a disease + took act of drinking in public
- Dissent: defendant is being punished for a state he is not in control over + could not prevent himself from appearing in public places

## NEXT TIME {#slide-28}

- We'll pick up with homicide and maybe get to next week's class material
- We'll meet in this same room / same time
- LET ME KNOW if there's something you want to see in these sessions / a better way I can structure them to  help you

- NOTE: we'll be covering sexual assault in a couple of weeks -- please let me know if you need support during classes and we can figure something out + feel free to step out of class if needed
