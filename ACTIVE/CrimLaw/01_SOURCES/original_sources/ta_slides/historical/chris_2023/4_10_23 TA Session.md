## Law Enforcement Use of Lethal Force {#slide-2}

New York Penal Law § 35.30.1

A police officer or a peace officer, in the course of effecting or attempting to effect an arrest, or of preventing or attempting to prevent the escape from custody, of a person whom he or she reasonably believes to have committed an offense, may use physical force when and to the extent he or she  reasonably  believes such to be  necessary  to  effect the arrest , or  to prevent the escape from custody , or  in self-defense  or to defend a third person from what he or she  reasonably  believes to be the use or imminent use of physical force;  except that deadly physical force may be used for such purposes only when he or she  reasonably  believes that:  . . . 

## Law Enforcement Use of Lethal Force {#slide-3}

New York Penal Law § 35.30.1

- (a) The offense committed by such person was:

<!-- -->

- (i) a felony or an attempt to commit a felony involving the use or attempted use or threatened imminent use of physical force against a person;  or
- (ii) kidnapping, arson, escape in the first degree, burglary in the first degree or any attempt to commit such a crime;  or

<!-- -->

- (b) The offense committed or attempted by such person was a felony and that, in the course of resisting arrest therefor or attempting to escape from custody, such person is armed with a firearm or deadly weapon;  or
- (c) Regardless of the particular offense which is the subject of the arrest or attempted escape, the use of deadly physical force is necessary to defend the police officer or peace officer or another person from what the officer reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of deadly physical force.

## Law Enforcement Use of Lethal Force {#slide-4}

New York Penal Law § 35.30.1 (Summary)

For law enforcement use of lethal force, officers need to have a  "reasonable belief" that the force is necessary to do one of three things:

- Make an arrest
- Prevent an escape
- Defend self or another

For arrests or preventing escapes, this must be for:

- a specific felony, or any felony involving force or the threat of force, 
- or, during the arrest or escape, the person is armed with a deadly weapon

Saheed Vassell

- Facts

<!-- -->

- Brooklyn resident with bipolar/trauma, known to local police, neighborhood. 
- Quirky/erratic, but never violent. 
- Episode one day where he used a silver pipe to point at people like gun.
- Some people called cops. 
- Non-local cops showed up. None had fired shots before. 
- Took them 5-10 seconds after they pulled up to shoot him.
- Total 10 shots fired between 3 officers. 

<!-- -->

- Questions / Application of NYPL § 35.30.1

<!-- -->

- Did pointing a pipe count as a felony? 

<!-- -->

- If it were a gun, probably. 
- Was there a reasonable belief that he was engaging in assault with a deadly weapon.

<!-- -->

- Were they attempting to effect an arrest? Or preventing the escape from custody?
- Does the self-defense provision apply?

- OAG Report on the killing: " Based on a review of all of the evidence, the OAG finds that, pursuant to . . . 35.30, the NYPD officers who shot Mr. Vassell were legally justified in their actions. PL Section 35.30 (1)(c) provides that deadly physical force may be used by police officers when, 'regardless of the particular offense which is the subject of the arrest . . . , the use of deadly physical force is necessary to defend the police officer or peace officer or another person from what the officer reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of deadly physical force.'"

## Necessity {#slide-10}

Common law requires:

- a threat (usually from a natural source) of
- imminent injury to the person or property
- for which there are no (reasonable) alternatives except the commission of the crime, where
- the defendant's acts prevent an equal or more serious harm, and
- the defendant has not created the conditions of his own dilemma. 

## Necessity {#slide-11}

MPC 3.02 Justification Generally: Choice of Evils.

- (1) Conduct which the actor  believes  to be  necessary  to  avoid  a  harm  or evil to  himself  or to  another  is justifiable, provided that:

<!-- -->

- (a) the  harm  or evil sought to be  avoided  by such conduct is  greater  than that sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense charged; and
- (b) neither the Code nor other law defining the offense provides exceptions or defenses dealing with the specific situation involved; and
- (c) a legislative purpose to exclude the justification claimed does not otherwise plainly appear.

<!-- -->

- (2) When the actor was  reckless  or  negligent  in bringing about the situation requiring a choice of harms or evils or in appraising the necessity for his conduct, the justification afforded by this Section is unavailable in a prosecution for any offense for which recklessness or negligence, as the case may be, suffices to establish culpability.

## Necessity {#slide-12}

MPC 3.02

- This is choice of evils provision

<!-- -->

- D must believe his conduct is necessary to avoid harm to himself or others and that the harm inflicted by committing a "criminal" act is less serious than that sought to be avoided by the criminal law

<!-- -->

- Code rejects most common law restrictions on the claim of necessity:

<!-- -->

- Does not require that the actual infliction of harm be imminent
- Does not distinguish between threats from human versus nonhuman forces
- Does not restrict the claim to instances involving a threat of death or serious bodily harm
- Does not preclude the defense in a homicide

<!-- -->

- If D has been reckless or negligent in creating the conditions requiring the defense, he may still raise the claim in all instances where he is charged with a purposeful or knowing crime. He may still be prosecuted for a reckless or negligent crime. 

## Necessity {#slide-13}

Regina v. Dudley & Stephens (1884)

- Issue:

<!-- -->

- Is the killing of one stranded seaman to save the others a killing of necessity such that the other seamen cannot be charged with murder?

<!-- -->

- Court's conclusion:

<!-- -->

- While self-defense is a form of necessity, the "temptation" of starvation while adrift, while clearly dire, is not enough to make a deliberate and willful killing lawful. In that case, a court should not say it is a man's duty to take another life in order to sustain his own, but to sacrifice himself. 
- The court questions the practicality or moral standard of such a rule: If everyone is weak and dying, as happened in this case, who is to be killed and who is the killer? Who should decide?

<!-- -->

- Additional thoughts:

<!-- -->

- This feels clearly retributive. There's no indication they'd ever do this again, and this doesn't represent deterrence. But it was also a test case, so perhaps there's some ex ante utilitarianism in there somewhere.
- Why not a choice of two evils? Death is the same evil -- but also starving to death isn't a crime. The choice of evils must be two crimes. 

## Necessity {#slide-14}

People v. Unger (Ill. 1977)

- Facts: A man in prison for auto theft escapes. 

<!-- -->

- Says he received threats that he would be molested, assaulted, and killed. 
- Had reasons to believe the threats are valid. 
- Still in jail clothes when found 2 days later on his way to Canada.

<!-- -->

- State's argument: The State argues for applying a more stringent necessity test under  Lovercamp  for prisoners with five factors: 

<!-- -->

- 1) specific threat of violence; 
- 2) no time to complain to authorities; 
- 3) no time to resort to the courts; 
- 4) no evidence of force or violence used toward prison personnel; 
- 5) the prisoner immediately reports to the authorities from a place of safety. 

## Necessity {#slide-15}

People v. Unger (Ill. 1977)

- Holding: 

<!-- -->

- The court allows that these factors are relevant, but argues that they are not controlling, and the fact that the defendant did not immediately report to the authorities does not mean he is not entitled to a defense of necessity.

<!-- -->

- Rule: 

<!-- -->

- When a defendant reasonably believes that an offense is justifiable because he would escape greater injury, he is entitled to a defense of necessity. While the  Lovercamp  factors are relevant to deciding whether a defense of necessity is proper for an escaped prisoner, they are not controlling, and the prisoner is allowed the same defense under the statute as anyone else.

## Necessity {#slide-16}

U.S. v. Schoon (9th Cir. 1992)

- Facts:

<!-- -->

- T hirty people entered an IRS office in Tucson, Arizona, where they chanted \"keep America\'s tax dollars out of El Salvador,\" splashed simulated blood on the counters, walls, and carpeting, and generally obstructed the office\'s operation. They wouldn't disperse so were arrested. 
- They argued that their acts in protest of American involvement in El Salvador were necessary to avoid further bloodshed in that country.

<!-- -->

- Holding: Necessity does not apply to indirect civil disobedience 
- Reasoning: 

<!-- -->

- There are legal alternatives like lobbying
- There is no requisite immediacy 

<!-- -->

- (although some protests and civil disobedience can be in regard to immediate pressing harm, civil disobedience is still not allowed) 
- Court said that the El Salvador policy was not a legally cognizable harm in general

<!-- -->

- The action taken is not likely to solve the evil

## Duress {#slide-17}

Common law requirements: 

- (1) A well-founded fear, generated by (2) a threat from a human being of (3) an imminent (or immediate) (4) serious bodily harm or death (5) to himself (or sometimes to a near relative) (6) not of his own doing

<!-- -->

- Fear must be reasonable 
- Common law mostly limited duress to cases where D personally was threatened, but most states now allow the claim of duress when any person's life or bodily harm is threatened by the duressor.
- At common law, D could not claim duress if he killed a victim. Instead, he was required to sacrifice himself to the duressor.
- Once the threat has ceased, D must cease his criminality.

## Duress {#slide-18}

MPC 2.09

- (1) It is an  affirmative defense  that the actor engaged in the conduct charged to constitute an offense because he was coerced to do so by the use of, or a threat to use, unlawful force against his person or the person of another, which a person of  reasonable  firmness in his situation would have been unable to resist.
- (2) The defense provided by this Section is  unavailable if the actor recklessly placed himself  in a situation in which it was probable that he would be subjected to duress.  The defense is also unavailable if he was  negligent  in placing himself in such a situation, whenever negligence suffices to establish culpability for the offense charged.
- (3) It is not a defense that a woman acted on the command of her husband, unless she acted under such coercion as would establish a defense under this Section.  \[The presumption that a woman, acting in the presence of her husband, is coerced is abolished.\]
- (4) When the conduct of the actor would otherwise be justifiable under Section 3.02, this Section does not preclude such defense.

## Duress {#slide-19}

MPC 2.09

- Retains the common law requirement that the threat be one of personal injury rather than property damage, but allows a threat of "unlawful force" to support duress, thus allowing the threat of physical minor harm
- Subtly varies the common law's requirement of reasonableness by requiring that the threat involved would have similarly affected a "person of reasonable firmness in the defendant's situation" 
- Rejects most of the specific limitations imposed by the common law:

<!-- -->

- Duress is a valid claim in all prosecutions, including homicide
- There is no restriction to "imminent harm"
- The threat may be to any person, not solely a relative, or even an acquaintance, of the defendant

<!-- -->

- Like the common law, disallows the defense if the defendant recklessly placed himself in the position where he could be duressed.

## Duress {#slide-20}

State v. Toscano (N.J. 1977)

- Facts:

<!-- -->

- The defendant was involved in insurance scheme. He testified that one of the ringleaders of the conspiracy called him and threatened him and his wife. 
- The trial judge refused to instruct the jury on the defense of duress, stating that it was applicable only when an act was committed in response to a threat of present, imminent, or impending death or serious bodily harm. 

<!-- -->

- Holding:

<!-- -->

- On review, court said that D was entitled to jury instruction of duress. 

<!-- -->

- Court rules that factors should be given evidential weight and failure to satisfy one or more conditions would NOT justify withholding the defense from jury. 

<!-- -->

- The court modified the common law duress defense in NJ. 

<!-- -->

- Moves NJ to standard that defense to a crime other than murder if the defendant engaged in a conduct because he was coerced to do so by the use of or threat to use unlawful force against his person or the person of another which a person of reasonable firmness in his situation might have been unable to resist.

<!-- -->

- Objective standard -- normal members of the community. 

## Duress {#slide-21}

U.S. v. Fleming (1957)

- Facts: 

<!-- -->

- D was a POW subjected to interrogations, forced marches, abuse. Was threatened with being put in a "hole" and never coming out, going on a long and potentially life-threatening march.
- D was a court-martialed army officer who was charged with collaborating with enemy by helping prepare propaganda designed to promote disaffection among troops. 

<!-- -->

- Holding: 

<!-- -->

- It was not at all certain at the time the threat was made that walking north to Pyktong would cause death at all, much less immediately. If he had started on it and it became evident he would not survive, then the defense of duress would arise. Here, the danger was remote. 

<!-- -->

- Takeaway: 

<!-- -->

- Prisoner of war not entitled to duress defense in charges of aiding the enemy because the threats of being sent to caves or forced to walk barefoot were not immediate threats of death and too remote.

## Insanity {#slide-22}

M'Naghten Rule (Guiding standard until at least beginning of 20th Century)

- Facts: 

<!-- -->

- D murdered secretary to the prime minister, Drummond, thinking it was the prime minister (Peel). 
- Thought that "the Tories" followed and persecuted him wherever he went and had entirely destroyed his peace of mind, had delusions and acute insanity
- Charged with murder, but found not guilty by jury. 

<!-- -->

- Rule:

<!-- -->

- "The jurors ought to be told in all cases that every man is to be presumed to be sane, and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes, until the contrary be proved to their satisfaction; and that to establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was laboring under such a defect of reason,  from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or if he did know it, he did not know what he was doing was wrong."

## Insanity {#slide-23}

MPC § 4.01 - Mental Disease or Defect Excluding Responsibility (Insanity)

- (1) A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct as a result of mental disease or defect he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality \[wrongfulness\] of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.
- (2) As used in this Article, the terms "mental disease or defect" do not include an abnormality manifested only by repeated criminal or otherwise antisocial conduct.
- Model Penal Code and Commentaries

<!-- -->

- Insanity defense is about drawing the line between condemning and committing -- between moral blameworthiness (thus requiring or at least allowing retribution) and lack of control. Requiring a "knowledge" standard like  M'Naghten  places those who might cognitively know but may not be able to control their behavior as criminals rather than the ill. Therefore unless the defendant had the "substantial capacity" to control his conduct as a result of a mental illness he should not be convicted.

## Insanity {#slide-24}

Additional History

- Historically, we have shifted from a mental health paradigm to an incapacitation paradigm

<!-- -->

- As mental institution rates go down, the proportion of nonwhite populations went up

<!-- -->

- Under M'Naughten Standard: All about knowledge of act, or knowledge that act was wrong

<!-- -->

- Doesn't take account of the volition issue -- not about whether you can control your conduct, but whether you understand your conduct

<!-- -->

- Irresistible impulse test: committed under an impulse which completely deprives the defendant of the power of choice or volition. 🡨 this test was often used to augment the M'Naughten Rule

Blake v. United States  (5th Cir. 1968)

- Facts: Blake was a diagnosed schizophrenic who robbed a bank.
- Issue: Was the judge incorrect to instruct the jury according to M'Naghten's rule (the  Davis  standard)?
- Holding: Yes

<!-- -->

- The court holds that an MPC "substantiality" standard is called for, because the  Davis  standard allows for someone like Blake, with schizophrenic tendencies, to be convicted because while they may not have been entirely in control of their faculties, the voluntariness of their state of mind has not been completely destroyed under the Davis standard.

<!-- -->

- Rule: The standard of insanity should be the MPC's "voluntariness" standard

<!-- -->

- "A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at such time of such conduct as a result of mental disease or defect he lacks a substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality (wrongfulness) of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law."

United State v. Lyons (5th Cir. 1984)

- Facts: 

<!-- -->

- Lyons became addicted to narcotics after using them under a prescription.
- Argues that his drug addiction affected his brain both physiologically and psychologically  → lacked substantial capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law

<!-- -->

- Question: 

<!-- -->

- Whether a person responsible for criminal conduct on the grounds of insanity only if at the time of the conduct, as a result of a mental disease or defect, the person is unable to appreciate the wrongfulness of the conduct?

<!-- -->

- Holding: court reverses Blake

<!-- -->

- No more volitional defense

## Insanity {#slide-29}

United State v. Lyons  (5th Cir. 1984)

- Reasoning:

<!-- -->

- 1) Psychiatrists cannot adequately measure "substantial capacity" under the MPC standard; it is impossible to distinguish between "the undeterrable and the merely undeterred." 
- 2) It is like to produce mistakes and confusion for juries who are unable to differentiate between the inability to understand and the ability to control one's behavior.
- 3) There is a great overlap between control/cognition such that the distinction is inapplicable
- 4) It's all but an impossible task to require the prosecutor to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was able to entirely control his faculties.

<!-- -->

- Dissent: 

<!-- -->

- Mens rea requires free choice. A defendant need not be on another planet mentally to not have the adequate mens rea for moral blameworthiness to attach. 
- Under a wider insanity definition, the "guilty" do not go free -- and under a narrower definition, many of the not guilty will end up being punished.

Andrea  Yates 

- Likely example of postpartum psychosis

<!-- -->

- Form of extreme postpartum depression

<!-- -->

- Mania, depression; hallucinations, paranoia, delusions; 4-6 weeks after childbirth

<!-- -->

- Occurs in 1 or 2 in 1000 deliveries
- Relationship to race and poverty:

<!-- -->

- "A necessary though often insufficient condition for an insanity defense may well be that you are wealthy enough to have a documented mental-health record: you talked to doctors about it---you had the resources to seek treatment. This may be why most people who successfully exonerated themselves on grounds of postpartum  psychosis  have been white and affluent."

- Texas Code: "the actor, as a result of severe mental disease or defect,  didn't know his conduct was wrong. " 

<!-- -->

- A M'Naghten regime -- cognition test

<!-- -->

- Defense: 

<!-- -->

- Need to establish a mental disorder; if she thought she was saving them from Satan, she might not have thought what she was doing was morally wrong
- BUT: Transcript seemed like she knew that murder is wrong, but that she listened to the voices and did what she was told.

<!-- -->

- Result:

<!-- -->

- Originally found guilty
- Overturned on appeal because of bad expert testimony
- Retried and found not guilty by reason of insanity

- Facts: 

<!-- -->

- Kahler became abusive towards wife after her affair. 
- Killed wife, two daughters, and wife's grandmother. 

<!-- -->

- Trial: 

<!-- -->

- Sentenced to death. 
- Experts testified he had OCD, depression, BPD, paranoia, and narcissism, said he did not make rational choice during killings, had "lost control."

<!-- -->

- Kansas Law: 

<!-- -->

- Jury cannot consider mental disease/defect as defense to crime except to show D lacked sufficient MR. 
- Not relevant whether D knew nature & quality of actions or wrongness.

## Insanity {#slide-33}

Kahler v. Kansas (2020)

- Question: 

<!-- -->

- Can a state abolish the insanity defense? (8A/14A Q)

<!-- -->

- SCOTUS: (Conservatives + Kagan) 

<!-- -->

- Y es. The provision about sufficient MR is enough. There is no one insanity defense statute.

<!-- -->

- Dissent: (Breyer, RBG, Sotomayor) 

<!-- -->

- No, that destroys the insanity defense, a "fundamental precept of our criminal law," ergo, unconstitutional.
