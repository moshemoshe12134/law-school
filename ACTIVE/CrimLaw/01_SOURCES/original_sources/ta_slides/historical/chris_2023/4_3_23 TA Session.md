## Capital Punishment: Stephen Bright Readings {#slide-2}

"Fifty Years of Defiance and Resistance After  Gideon v. Wainwright"

- "The U.S. criminal system is not truly adversarial because prosecutors possess broad, unchecked power and therefore determine results in criminal cases with little or no input from the defense. Governments have failed to adequately fund defense systems, many judges tolerate or welcome inadequate representation, and the Supreme Court has refused to require competent representation, instead adopting a standard of 'effective counsel' that hides and perpetuates deficient representation. In this system, poverty, not justice, dictates outcomes."

## Capital Punishment: Stephen Bright Readings {#slide-3}

"Counsel for the Poor: The Death Sentence Not for the Worst Crime But for the Worst Lawyer"

- "\[T\]he Supreme Court has not been vigilant in enforcing the promise of Powell v. Alabama and Gideon v. Wainwright. Its acceptance of the current quality of representation in capital cases as inevitable or even acceptable demeans the Sixth Amendment. . . . No poor person accused of any crime should receive the sort of representation that is found acceptable in the criminal courts of this nation today, but it is particularly indefensible in cases where life is at stake. . . ."
- "So long as juries and judges are deprived of critical information and the Bill of Rights is ignored in the most emotionally and politically charged cases due to deficient legal representation, the courts should not be authorized to impose the extreme and irrevocable penalty of death. Otherwise, the death penalty will continue to be imposed, not upon those who commit the worst crimes, but upon those who have the misfortune to be assigned the worst lawyers."

## Capital Punishment: Stephen Bright Readings {#slide-4}

Takeaway: The death penalty is particularly unfair to poor people

- Think of this as a useful reference for policy questions about the death penalty
- Often, in states that still use death penalty, indigent defendants are guaranteed practically no defense against ineffective counsel
- Public defenders in general are over-worked, under-paid, and under-funded
- When stakes are even higher, and it's a question of deprivation of your life, money should never be a factor in whether death penalty is imposed
- Having good counsel should not be question of how much \$ the state gives to public defender's offices
- Poor defendants are deprived of an actual trial and the adversarial process more generally

## What We Criminalize: Criminal Law & Morality {#slide-5}

This is a new topic for this course. First year to discuss the criminalization of abortion.

- Keep in mind as a potential topic for the final. 
- How might restrictions on abortion access such as criminalization of the distribution of abortion medication impact constitutional protections?

<!-- -->

- Think back to the discussions from earlier this semester and the constitutional implications you learned about in ConLaw.
- Consult earlier TA slides

<!-- -->

- How might it be a reflection of the Hart-Devlin debate about moralism vs harm considerations?

## What We Criminalize: Criminal Law & Morality {#slide-6}

Hart-Devlin Debate

John Stuart Mill & H.L.A. Hart  -  The Harm Principle : The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.

- Mill: It is indispensable to not injure "the interests of one another, or rather certain interests which, either by express legal provision or by tacit understanding, out to be considered as rights."

Lord James Stephen & Lord Patrick Devlin  -  Legal Moralism : The criminal law is always based on moral principles and serves to uphold a moral order.

- Devlin: "the law must base itself on Christian morals and . . . enforce them, not simply because they are the morals of most of us, . . . but for the compelling reason that without the help of Christian teaching the law will fail."

## What We Criminalize: Criminal Law & Morality {#slide-7}

Griswold v. Connecticut (1965)

- Case about procuring contraception without consulting a doctor
- Court inferred a right to privacy for married couples from the 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 9th amendments
- Held Connecticut statute unconstitutional

Bowers v. Hardwick (1986)

- Case about GA law criminalizing "sodomy"
- Court said there was no "right of homosexuals to engage in sodomy" so they wouldn't need to apply strict scrutiny

<!-- -->

- They held that the statute survived rational basis review because following morality was a good enough reason

## What We Criminalize: Criminal Law & Morality {#slide-8}

Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003)

- Texas statute criminalized homosexual sex.
- Court found that intimate relations are a form of liberty protected by Due Process

<!-- -->

- Reframed the right discussed in Bowers
- Overruled Bowers

Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, 597 U.S. \_\_\_ (2022)

- You know this one. 
- Court held that there is no right to obtain an abortion (and implies problems with all privacy cases)
- Thomas concurrence says all fundamental rights cases at risk

Bernard E. Harcourt , The Collapse of the Harm Principle

- Harm principle proponents basically won the debate, but proponents of moralism just shifted their rhetoric to argue for the same things under the harm principle framework
- For example, proponents of drug laws were originally moralists against those who framed it as a victimless crime. They switched to emphasizing the harms of drug use.
- Became a battle of "harm reduction" with both sides arguing about harms
- But now there's no easy way to reject laws originally framed under moralism lens as being outside the scope of the purpose of law

## Justifications & Excuses {#slide-11}

Justifications & excuses don't seek to refute any element of the prosecution's case. They suggest considerations that negate culpability even when all the elements of the offense are present.  

- Justification: Act-focused. The act was justified because it is not wrong/blameworthy or if it has positive effects. Justifies entire classes of behavior.

<!-- -->

- D accepts responsibility, but denies that it was bad.     

<!-- -->

- Excuse: Defendant-focused. The act is excused because the defendant did not act entirely voluntarily. Excuses only the behavior of the specific defendant. 
- D admits that the behavior was bad, but does not accept responsibility. 

Is self-defense an excuse or justification?

## Justifications & Excuses: Self-Defense {#slide-12}

U.S. v. Peterson  (D.C., 1973)

- No facts in the case book for some reason . . . 
- Self defense is a "law of  necessity " 🡪 Arises "only when the necessity begins, and equally ends with the necessity." 
- There must be:

<!-- -->

- a threat, actual or apparent, of the use of  deadly  force against the defender; 
- the threat must have been  unlawful  and  immediate ; 
- the defender must have  believed  that he was in imminent peril of  death  or  serious bodily harm , and that his response was  necessary  to save himself therefrom. 

<!-- -->

- These beliefs must not only have been  honestly  entertained, but also  objectively reasonable  in light of the circumstances. 
- This is the widely accepted view

## Justifications & Excuses: Self-Defense {#slide-13}

People v. Goetz  (N.Y., 1986)

- Facts: Goetz said he was approached by youths on subway who asked for \$5. Two of them had screwdrivers, but neither were displayed to Goetz. Goetz shot all four, rendering one paralyzed and brain damaged.
- Goetz's defense:  Self-defense  because he was  afraid  of being "maimed" and robbed.  
- P.L. § 35.15(1): "A person may . . . use physical force upon another person when and to the extent  he reasonably believes  such to be  necessary  to defend himself or a third person from what  he reasonably believes  to be the use or  imminent  use of unlawful physical force by such other person."
- P.L. § 35.15(2): A person may not use deadly physical force unless (a)  he reasonably believes  that such other person is using or about to use  deadly physical force  or (b) he  reasonably believes  that such other person is commmitting or attempting to commit a kidnapping, forcible rape, forcible sodomy, or  robbery . 

## Justifications & Excuses: Self-Defense {#slide-14}

People v. Goetz  (N.Y., 1986)

- Question: What does "reasonably believes" mean under the NY PL? 

<!-- -->

- Subjective or objective standard? 

<!-- -->

- Holding: "Reasonably" must be interpreted objectively. Can't be solely based on the defendant's own subjective interpretation, or else anyone could get away with a self-defense justification by just saying that they believed they were justified. 

<!-- -->

- Court reinstated all courts of the indictment.

<!-- -->

- However, this "objective" standard can still be informed by the specific circumstances of the case (e.g., D's past experiences). 

## Justifications & Excuses: Self-Defense {#slide-15}

MPC § 3.04(1): The use of force upon or toward another person is  justifiable  when  the actor believes  that such force is  immediately necessary  for the purpose of protecting himself against the use of unlawful force by such other person on the present occasion.  

MPC § 3.04(2): Exceptions 

MPC § 3.09(1):  Justification of  self defense is not available if : (a) the actor's  belief  in the unlawfulness of the force or conduct against which he employs protective force or his  belief  in the lawfulness of an arrest which he endeavors to effect by force  is erroneous ; and (b) his error is due to ignorance or mistake as to the law. 

MPC §3.09(2): When he actor believes that the use of force upon or toward the person of another is necessary for any of the purposes for which such belief would establish a justification under Sections 3.03 to 3.08 but  the actor is reckless or negligent in having such a belief , the  justification  afforded by those section is  unavailable  in a prosecution for an offense for which r ecklessness or negligence suffices to establish culpability .

## Justifications & Excuses:  Battered Women Syndrome {#slide-17}

State v. Norman  (N.C., 1989)

- Facts: D's husband was badly abusive throughout their 25-year marriage. After multiple futile attempts to leave, husband beat her, refused to let her eat, and made her sleep on the floor. D brought grandchild to mother's home, returned with pistol, and shot husband while he was sleeping. 

<!-- -->

- At trial, presented evidence that she suffered from battered wife syndrome as proof of perfect self-defense. 
- Jury convicted her of voluntary manslaughter; she was sentenced to six years in prison.

<!-- -->

- N.C. Law: "Only where a D has killed due to a  reasonable belief  that death or great bodily harm was imminent can the justification for homicide remain clearly and firmly rooted in necessity."

## Justifications & Excuses:  Battered Women Syndrome {#slide-18}

State v. Norman  (N.C., 1989)

- Question: Should the court have instructed the jury on the self-defense justification where there was evidence of BWS? 
- Holding: No, D was not entitled to self-defense instruction based on BWS because the threat was not  imminent  enough since husband was asleep. Testimony about indefinite fears concerning what her sleeping husband might do at some time in the future did not tend to establish a fear of  imminent death or bodily harm  at the time of the killing. 

## Justifications & Excuses:  Duty to Retreat {#slide-19}

Self-defense and Race

- Trayvon Martin - why were Zimmerman's suspicions aroused in the first place?
- Racial Profiling

<!-- -->

- Aga Gruber - Internalized biases and stereotypes
- ABA - internalized biases result in more force used against Black people
- Jody Armour

<!-- -->

- Internalized racism is typical, but it isn't reasonable
- Race only exists statistically as a proxy for socio economic disparity

<!-- -->

- Solutions?

<!-- -->

- Jody Armour - race-based evidence is too prejudicial to justify
- Jonathan Markovitz - Goetz's legal team took full advantage of racially charged imagery and code words without appealing to racial stereotypes explicitly. The same thing happened in the Zimmerman case.

## Justifications & Excuses:  Duty to Retreat {#slide-20}

- Traditional view

<!-- -->

- English common law imposed strict duty to retreat. A person could use deadly force in self-defense only after exhausting every chance to flee, when his back was against the wall.

<!-- -->

- Late 1800s view

<!-- -->

- The law will not permit the taking of a human life to repel mere trespass, but a true man who is without fault is not obliged to fly from an assailant.  See Erwin v. State  (Ohio, 1876).

<!-- -->

- Modern View

<!-- -->

- The "true man" doctrine (originating in  Erwin ) is rejected in some jurisdictions (e.g., Ohio) and accepted in others (e.g., Tennessee)
- True man/no retreat/stand your ground rule considered the majority approach.
- MPC adopts a version of this rule with some exceptions.

<!-- -->

- Castle Exception

<!-- -->

- In all jurisdictions requiring retreat before using deadly force, an exception is made when the defendant is attacked in their own home by an intruder.  See People v. Tomlin  (N.Y., 1914).
- Different states require different things when involving guests or co-occupants.

## Justifications & Excuses:  Duty to Retreat {#slide-21}

George Zimmerman Case

- Although there was a stand-your-ground law in FL, it was not raised as a defense in by Zimmerman. Basic self-defense justification. 
- Jury instruction: "If George Zimmerman was not engaged in an unlawful activity and was attacked in any place where he had a right to be, he had no duty to retreat and had the right to stand his ground and meet force with force." 
- "A person is justified in using deadly force if he reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself." 
- "\[T\]he appearance of danger must have been so real that a reasonably cautious and prudent person under the same circumstances would have believed that the danger could be avoided only through the use of force."
- "George Zimmerman must have actually believed that the danger was real."

## Justifications & Excuses:  Duty to Retreat {#slide-22}

George Zimmerman Case

- FL 2nd Degree Murder: Jury needed to find that: 

<!-- -->

- Trayvon Martin is dead.
- The death was caused by the criminal act of George Zimmerman.
- There was an unlawful killing of Trayvon Martin by an act imminently dangerous to another and demonstrating a  depraved mind without regard for human life .

<!-- -->

- Mens rea here (depraved mind) mostly depends on whether or not it was a legitimate self-defense
- Stand your ground law - no duty to retreat

<!-- -->

- But exception for when defender initially provoked the use of force against himself. This requires the defender to exhaust every reasonable means to escape. 
- Did Zimmerman do this?

<!-- -->

- The six woman jury finds George Zimmerman not guilty. 

<!-- -->

- They had three choices: to find Zimmerman guilty of second-degree murder; to find him guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter; or to find him not guilty.

## Grand Juries {#slide-24}

Constitutionally guaranteed protection from the Federal government.

- Most states also use grand juries.
- For felonies, not misdemeanors and violations.
- Generally 24 jurors who sit and hear a bunch of cases in quick succession.
- More or less controlled by the prosecutor.

<!-- -->

- No defense (defense counsel or defendant) or judge. 
- Closed to public and media.
- The prosecutor instructs the grand jury on the law.

<!-- -->

- Grand juries will issue indictments in most cases.

<!-- -->

- Standard for indictment is probable cause: Requires only the kind of fair probability on which reasonable and prudent people, not legal technicians, act.

<!-- -->

- In controversial cases, state law will often allow the appointment of a special or independent prosecutor.
- A grand Jury decision  is  not a verdict.
