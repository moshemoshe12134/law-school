## Criminal Law {#slide-1}

Expanding Liability

## Expanding Liability {#slide-2}

Expanding Liability:

- Attempt
- Complicity
- Conspiracy
- Seditious Conspiracy

Issues to consider:

- What mens rea will apply? What did you need to intend to do?
- Can you withdraw?
- What punishment should apply?

## Attempt {#slide-3}

Attempt - a crime not yet committed, but where steps have been taken toward the completion of the act.

2 main kinds of attempt:

- Not yet reached the final stage (MPC 5.01(1)(c))
- A failed attempt (MPC 5.01(1)(a)-(b))

At common law:

- A ttempts were originally classified as misdemeanors.
- Today, the usual punishment for attempt is a reduced factor of the punishment for the completed crime.

## Attempt {#slide-4}

Defenses:

- Abandonment = usually not a defense

<!-- -->

- For states that allow the defense, it typically requires that the abandonment occur "under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete renunciation of \[the\] criminal purpose."

<!-- -->

- Impossibility

<!-- -->

- Factual impossibility = not a defense

<!-- -->

- the inability to complete a crime due to a non-existent factual circumstance

<!-- -->

- Legal impossibility = a valid defense

<!-- -->

- the belief that one's actions are a crime when they actually are not

## Attempt {#slide-5}

MPC 5.01(1) - Definition of Attempt

-  A person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, acting with  the kind of culpability otherwise required for commission of the crime , he:

<!-- -->

- (a)  purposely engages in conduct  which would constitute the crime if the attendant circumstances were as he  believes  them to be;  or
- (b) when causing a particular  result  is an element of the crime, does or omits to do anything with the  purpose  of causing or with the  belief  that it will cause such  result  without further conduct on his part;  or
- (c)  purposely  does or omits to do anything which, under the circumstances as he believes them to be, is an act or omission  constituting a substantial step  in a course of conduct planned to culminate in his commission of the crime.

<!-- -->

- Details for this in 5.01(2).

## Attempt {#slide-6}

MPC 5.01(3) - Attempted complicity

- Engaging in conduct that would render you complicit under MPC § 2.06 if the crime were committed, is guilty of attempt, even though the crime is not committed or attempted by the principal criminal actor.

MPC 5.01(4) - Renunciation

- It is an affirmative defense that the actor abandoned the criminal effort or otherwise prevented its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose. 
- This defense doesn't affect the liability of an accomplice who didn't join in abandonment or prevention.

## Attempt {#slide-7}

Smallwood  v. State  (Md. Ct. App. 1996)

- Facts: Smallwood was convicted of assault with intent to murder three rape victims.

<!-- -->

- Evidence showed he knew about the dangers of HIV contraction and raped his victims nonetheless.
- The prosecution analogized the defendant carrying HIV to carrying a deadly weapon and deploying it through unprotected sex.

<!-- -->

- Holding: This is not intent to kill.

<!-- -->

- The risk of death by AIDS is too far removed, relative to firing a gun at the head of a victim.

<!-- -->

- Takeaway: To convict only on the risk of death, death must be the natural and probably result of the act. Otherwise, you need specific intent to kill.

## Attempt {#slide-8}

People v. Rizzo  (N.Y. 1927)

- Facts: Defendant was with a group planning to rob Charles Rao while on his way to cash his paycheck. Rizzo and the crew drove around looking for their target, but they never found him. Police arrested them before they could rob Rao.
- Issue: Whether the steps taken by the defendant constitute attempt to commit robbery
- Holding: This is not attempt to commit robbery, merely preparation.

<!-- -->

- The law doesn't recognize mere preparation tending toward the commission of a crime.
- The acts tending toward the commission of a crime must be so near to its accomplishment that in all reasonable probability the crime itself would've been committed, but for timely interference.
- There must be dangerous proximity to success.

## Attempt {#slide-9}

McQuirter v. State  (Ala. Ct. App. 1953)

- Facts: A Black man was found guilty of attempted assault with intent to rape.

<!-- -->

- He allegedly followed a white woman with her children into a white neighborhood. When he approached her, she told her children to run and get Simmons. McQuirter left after seeing Simmons. The police chief testified that McQuirter confessed to an intent to rape the first woman to pass his truck. McQuirter testified tha the was simply sitting in the area where the woman was.

<!-- -->

- Holding: There was sufficient evidence to submit to the jury the question of the defendant's guilt.

<!-- -->

- Intent is a jury question to be adduced at trial.
- You can admit inferential evidence to determine the defendant's intent.

<!-- -->

- Recall that the only direct evidence of intent came from the sheriff's testimony.

<!-- -->

- The jury may consider social conditions and customs founded on racial differences.

## Complicity {#slide-10}

Complicity = accomplice liability

- E xtends criminal responsibility to individuals who because they purposefully aided and abetted criminal acts should be held responsible for those actions
- Complicity is not a separate offense. Instead, the defendant is charged with the underlying crime.

<!-- -->

- This is unlike attempt or conspiracy, which are separate charges.

<!-- -->

- No distinction today between principals 1st degree, principals 2nd degree or accessories before the fact

<!-- -->

- Accessories after the fact is still something else like harboring

## Complicity {#slide-11}

MPC 2.06

- (1) A person is guilty of an offense if, it is committed by  his own conduct or by the conduct of another person  for which he is  legally accountable , or both.
- (2) A person is legally accountable for the conduct of another person when:

<!-- -->

- (a) acting with the  requisite mens rea for the offense , he causes an innocent or irresponsible person to engage in such conduct; OR
- (b) he is made accountable for the conduct of such other person by the Code or the law defining the offense; OR
- (c) he is an  accomplice  of such other person in the  commission  of the offense.

<!-- -->

- (3) A person is an  accomplice  if: 

<!-- -->

- (a) with the  purpose  of promoting or facilitating the commission of the offense, he:

<!-- -->

- (i) solicits  such other person to commit it; OR
- (ii) aids, or agrees or  attempts to aid  such other person in planning or committing it; OR
- (iii) having a legal duty to prevent the commission of the offense, fails to make proper efforts so to do; OR

<!-- -->

- (b) his conduct is expressly declared by law to establish his complicity

## Complicity {#slide-12}

MPC 2.06

- (4) if causing a  result  is an element of the offense, an  accomplice  to that crime is guilty if he acts with the  requisite mens rea , if any, with respect to that  result  that is sufficient for the commission of the offense.
- (5) A person who is legally incapable of committing a particular offense may be guilty if it is committed by the conduct of  another  for which he is legally accountable, unless such liability is inconsistent with  the  purpose of the provision establishing incapacity.

## Complicity {#slide-13}

Comment to MPC S 2.06(3)(a) 

- Subsection (3) (a) requires that the actor have the purpose of promoting or facilitating the commission of the offense\.... This does not mean, of course, that the precise means used in the commission of the crime must have been fixed or contemplated or, when they have been, that liability is limited to their employment. One who solicits an end, or aids or agrees to aid in its achievement, is an accomplice in whatever means may be employed, insofar as  they constitute an offense fairly envisaged in the purposes of the association . But when a wholly different crime has been committed, thus involving conduct  not within the conscious objectives of the accomplice , he is  not  liable for it\.... \[l\]t is submitted that the liability of an accomplice ought not to be extended beyond the purposes that he shares. Probabilities have an important evidential bearing on these issues; to make them independently sufficient is to predicate the liability on negligence when, for good reason, more is normally required before liability is found.

## Complicity {#slide-14}

Comment to MPC S 2.06 

- There is deliberate ambiguity as to whether the purpose requirement extends to circumstance elements of the contemplated offense or whether, as in the case of attempts, the policy of the substantive offense on this point should control. The result, therefore, is that the actor must have a purpose with respect to the proscribed conduct, with his attitude towards the circumstances to be left to resolution by the courts. 

## Complicity {#slide-15}

Hicks v. U.S.  (1893)

- Facts: 

<!-- -->

- Defendant was jointly indicted with Rowe for the murder of Colvard. 
- Witnesses said that during the incident, Hicks laughed, telling Colvard to take his hat off and \"die like a man.\" 
- Rowe shot Colvard. Rowe and Hicks rode off together. 
- Hicks testified that he didn\'t intend to encourage Rowe to kill Colvard. 

<!-- -->

- Issue: Whether a person can be an accomplice to murder for uttering words that had the effect of encouraging murder, even though the defendant didn\'t intend it 
- Holding: No, the defendant needed to intend to aid in/encourage the murder. 

<!-- -->

- No evidence that Hicks would\'ve committed the crime had Rowe not been there, so presence is insufficient to establish intent. 
- If your only evidence is words, you need intent to aid/encourage the crime or some facts pointing to conspiracy

## Complicity {#slide-16}

State v. Gladstone  (Wash. 1970)

- Facts: 

<!-- -->

- Defendants were all students. 
- Police hired Thompson as an informant to buy pot from Gladstone, but he didn\'t have any. Gladstone gave him Kent\'s information. 
- No evidence of communication between Gladstone and Kent concerning the sale of pot. 

<!-- -->

- Holding: A defendant can\'t be guilty of aiding and abetting where there is no connection/association with the principal to accomplish the crime. 

<!-- -->

- Gladstone may have helped Thompson purchase weed, but he didn\'t help Kent sell it. 
- You need some sort of association with the venture, participation in the conduct, and intent for the criminal conduct to succeed. 
- Mere communication to the effect that someone might commit a crime is insufficient.

## Complicity {#slide-17}

State v. McVay  (R.I. 1926)

- Facts: 

<!-- -->

- Kelley instructed Captain McVay and an engineer of a passenger ship to depart. 
- The boiler exploded, killing three. 
- McVay and Grant were indicted as principals for manslaughter. 
- Kelley was indicted as an accessory before the fact. 

<!-- -->

- Holding: The indictment against Kelley can stand. 

<!-- -->

- Kelley need not have intended the result of death, only that he intentionally directed and counseled the grossly negligence act, which the indictment charges resulted in the crime. 

<!-- -->

- Takeaway: The mens rea required for accessory in a result-based crime is only the intent to act, not the intent to cause the result. 

<!-- -->

- Kelley was charged with counseling and procuring the principals to disregard their duties and negligently create steam.

## Complicity {#slide-18}

Commonwealth v. Roebuck  (Pa. 2011)

- Facts: 

<!-- -->

- Defendants participated in luring the victim into an apartment complex, where the victim was ambushed and fatally shot. 
- Roebuck didn\'t shoot. He was convicted as an accomplice to third-degree murder. 
- Roebuck argued that intending to aid an unintentional act is logically impossible. 

<!-- -->

- Holding: Conviction stands; accomplice liability doesn\'t require that the defendant had the conscious objective to help cause a particular result. 

<!-- -->

- The defendant only needs to intend to aid the conduct, which unfortunately, results in death. 
- With respect to the result (death), the defendant still needs to be reckless (or whatever other mens rea). 

## Complicity {#slide-19}

People v. Luparello  (Cal. Ct. App. 1987)

- Facts: 

<!-- -->

- Defendant was distraught after his ex left and married another. 
- He thought he could discover her whereabouts from Martin. Luparello called on his friends to find Martin and get info about her whereabouts at any cost. 
- Friends visited Martin, who wouldn\'t say anything. 
- The next night, the friends ambushed Martin and killed him. 
- Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder on a theory of accomplice liability. 

<!-- -->

- Holding: A person can be liable for the unplanned and unintended acts of co-conspirators that are the natural, probable, and foreseeable consequences of his assistance. 

<!-- -->

- Similar to the proximate cause inquiry (reasonably foreseeable).
- The fact that the accomplice or co-conspirator intended to facilitate some less serious criminal act doesn\'t render the foreseeable consequence doctrine inapplicable.

## Complicity {#slide-20}

Roy v. U.S.  (D.C. 1995)

- Facts: 

<!-- -->

- Miller, a confidential informant approached Roy to buy a handgun. Roy referred Miller to Ross. 
- The gun and money exchanged hands, but Ross ended up just robbing Miller of the money and taking the gun. 
- Trial court instructed jury that Roy could be liable for armed robbery if the robbery was the natural and probable consequence of the illegal attempt to sell a handgun. 

<!-- -->

- Holding: Reversed; insufficient evidence to show intent to participate in robbery

<!-- -->

- Roy intended an illegal sale, not a robbery. 
- This would expand liability too much, as Roy would go from a misdemeanor to felony punishable by life imprisonment. 
- It is not enough to show that the accomplice knew or should\'ve known that the principal might conceivably commit the offense the accomplice is charged with aiding and abetting. 
- Natural and probable in the ordinary course of things presupposes an outcome within a reasonably predictable range.

## Complicity {#slide-21}

![](ppt/media/image1.png "Google Shape;266;p35")

## Conspiracy {#slide-22}

MPC 5.03

- (1) A person is guilty of conspiracy with another person or persons to commit a crime if with the  purpose  of promoting or facilitating its commission he: 

<!-- -->

- (a) agrees with such other person or persons that they or one or more of them will engage in  conduct  which constitutes such crime or an  attempt  or  solicitation  to commit such crime; OR 
- (b) agrees to  aid  such other person or persons in the  planning  or  commission  of such crime or of an  attempt  or solicitation to commit such crime. 

<!-- -->

- (2) If a person guilty of conspiracy, as defined by (1), knows that a person with whom he conspires to commit a crime has conspired with another person or persons to commit the same crime, he is guilty of conspiring with such other person or persons, whether or not he knows their identity, to commit such crime. 
- (3) If a person conspires to commit a number of crimes, he is guilty of only one conspiracy so long as such multiple crimes are the object of the same agreement or continuous conspiratorial relationship.

## Conspiracy {#slide-23}

MPC 5.03

- (5) No person may be convicted of conspiracy to commit a crime, other than a felony of the first or second degree, unless an overt act in pursuance of such conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by him or by a person with whom he conspired. 
- (6) It is an  affirmative defense  that the actor, after conspiring to commit a crime, thwarted the success of the conspiracy, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose. 
- (7) Duration of the conspiracy 

<!-- -->

- (a) conspiracy is a continuing course of conduct which terminates when the crime or crimes which are its object are committed or the agreement that they be committed is abandoned by the defendant and by those with whom he conspired; AND 
- (b) such abandonment is presumed if neither the defendant nor anyone with whom he conspired does any overt act in pursuance of the conspiracy during the applicable period of limitation; AND
- (c) if an individual abandons the agreement, the conspiracy is terminated as to him only if and when he advises those with whom he conspired of his abandonment or he informs the law enforcement authorities of the existence of the conspiracy and of his participation therein.

## Conspiracy {#slide-24}

Krulewitch v. U.S.  (1949)

- Rule: A conspiracy is considered so vagrant as to have been committed in any district where any one of the conspirators did any of the acts, however innocent, intended to accomplish its object. 

<!-- -->

- Once the trial begins, the defendant is bombarded with evidence of acts of others he may not have authorized, intended, or known about, all of which is admissible to the existence of a conspiracy. 
- If the defendant is silent, he is taken to admit the conspiracy and if co-defendants turn on each other, they convict each other. 

<!-- -->

- Takeaway: Krulewitch demonstrates the procedural advantages for the government when bringing a conspiracy charge.

## Conspiracy {#slide-25}

Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. U.S.  (1939)

- Facts: 

<!-- -->

- Two movie theaters entered into an agreement to fix prices with each of eight film distributors. 
- The contracts were individual to each distributor. 
- There was no evidence of any agreement between distributors. 

<!-- -->

- Holding: There was a conspiracy among all eight movie distributors. 
- Takeaway: The Court may infer an agreement based on the circumstances. 

## Conspiracy {#slide-26}

People v. Lauria  (Cal. Dist. Ct. App. 1967)

- Facts: 

<!-- -->

- Lauria operated a telephone answering services for prostitutes to be connected with clients. 
- Law enforcement was investigating the prostitutes and also went for the telephone service. 
- Defendant knew some of his customers were prostitutes. Prosecutors wanted to prove knowledge of the prostitution. 

<!-- -->

- Rule: The People need show no more than a tacit, mutual understanding between co-conspirators to accomplish an unlawful act. 
- Holding: Lauria is not guilty of conspiracy because his knowledge/involvement didn\'t rise to the level of  intent  to participate in a criminal conspiracy. 

<!-- -->

- We do not believe an inference of intent drawn from knowledge of criminal use properly applies to the less serious crimes classified as misdemeanors. 
- Positive knowledge of the supplier that his products or services are being used for criminal purposes does not alone establish an intent of the supplier to participate in the misdemeanors. 

## Conspiracy {#slide-27}

Pinkerton v. U.S.  (1946)

- Facts: 

<!-- -->

- Pinkerton brothers live on a farm. They were indicted for tax-related violations. The indictment contains 10 substantive counts and 1 conspiracy count. 

<!-- -->

- Holding: There was enough evidence to submit to the jury the question of Daniel\'s participation in the conspiracy. 

<!-- -->

- You don\'t need direct evidence of participation in the criminal conduct, as long as there\'s a continuous conspiracy. 
- Acts of one conspirator may be attributed to the act of all. 

<!-- -->

- Pinkerton Rule: You are liable for the substantive offense committed by a co-conspirator if: 

<!-- -->

- The act was in furtherance of the conspiracy; 
- The act was within the scope of the unlawful project; AND 
- The act was foreseeable as a necessary and natural consequence of the agreement

## Conspiracy {#slide-28}

State v. Bridges  (N.J. 1993)

- Facts: 

<!-- -->

- Defendant got into an argument with a party guest. He left to recruit two friends to help him fight the guy. They picked up guns on the way. 
- At the party, Bridges got into a fight. A friend was struck in the tussle, and the friends began firing into the crowd, killing someone. 

<!-- -->

- Issue: Whether Bridges can be guilty of accessory to murder due to his involvement in the conspiracy 
- Holding: Yes. A co-conspirator is liable for the commission of substantive criminal acts that aren\'t within the scope of the conspiracy if they are  reasonably foreseeable  as the necessary or natural consequences of the conspiracy. 

<!-- -->

- They brought loaded guns to a fight with several young, hostile partygoers from a beating of one of their friends. 

## Conspiracy {#slide-29}

U.S. v. Alvarez  (11th Cir. 1985)

- Facts: 

<!-- -->

- Undercover agents were in a motel room posing as buyers of a large quantity of cocaine. 
- A shoot-out ensued, and one agent was killed. 
- All the dealers were convicted of drug-related conspiracy. 
- Three defendants were convicted of second-degree murder based on Pinkerton liability. 

<!-- -->

- Holding: Although the murder convictions of the three appellants may represent an unprecedented application of Pinkerton, such an application is not improper. 

<!-- -->

- There is plenty of evidence for a jury to conclude that the murder was a  reasonably foreseeable  consequence of the drug conspiracy. 

<!-- -->

- Takeaway: Pinkerton can lead to  a lot  of liability.
