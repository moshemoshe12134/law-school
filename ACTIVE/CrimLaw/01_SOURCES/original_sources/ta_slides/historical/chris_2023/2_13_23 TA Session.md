## Exam Format {#slide-3}

Fact-pattern question(s)

- What charges would you file against which individuals?
- What defenses or issues would you raise on behalf of the individuals charged?
- Who would likely have the better of the argument, the prosecution or the defense? 
- Law that governs → Might be MPC/amended MPC/new statute  

Policy question(s)

- Should a specific statute/provision be revised?
- How would you draft a new statute/policy?
- Examine this quote from Foucault in light of one of the topics/themes from class.  

## How to prepare for class and the exam {#slide-4}

Identify the statute in each case -- note it just as you would note the holding, issue, etc. in other classes. 

Determine the part of the statute that the case turns on -- and elements of the facts that the court hinges its decision on, if any. 

Pay close attention to where the MPC departs from what the states do in the cases.

Pay attention to the discussions in class regarding the elements of the crimes, the arguments for the prosecution and defense, and the nuances of the MPC/statutes in the cases.

## Elements of Criminal Law {#slide-7}

T he structure of crimes. These must be proved for a jury to find someone "guilty"

Actus Reus (MPC 1.13)

- Conduct
- Attendant Circumstance
- Result of Conduct

Mens Rea (MPC 2.02)

- Purposely
- Knowingly
- Recklessly
- Negligently

## Actus Reus {#slide-8}

MPC § 1.13 General Definitions

- (2) "act" or "action" means a bodily movement whether voluntary or involuntary
- (9) "element of an offense" means (i) such  conduct   or (ii) such  attendant circumstances  or (iii) such a  result of conduct  as . . . 

MPC § 2.01 Requirement of  Voluntary Act ;  Omission  as Basis of Liability; Possession as an Act

- (1) A person is not guilty of an offense unless his liability is based on  conduct which includes a voluntary act  or the  omission  to perform an act of which he is physically capable.
- (2) The following are  not voluntary acts  within the meaning of this Section:

<!-- -->

- (a) a reflex or convulsion; (b) a bodily movement during unconsciousness or sleep; (c) conduct during hypnosis or resulting from hypnotic suggestion; (d) a bodily movement that otherwise is not a product of the effort or determination of the actor, either conscious or habitual.

<!-- -->

- (3) Liability for the commission of an offense may not be based on an  omission  unaccompanied by action unless:

<!-- -->

- (a) the omission is expressly made sufficient by the law defining the offense; or (b) a duty to perform the omitted act is otherwise imposed by law.

<!-- -->

- (4)  Possession  is an act, within the meaning of this Section, if the possessor knowingly procured or received the thing possessed or was aware of his control thereof for a sufficient period to have been able to terminate his possession.

## Actus Reus {#slide-9}

Martin v. State  (1994)

- Rule: For conduct to be criminal, it must be voluntary (the volition requirement)
- Facts: D appealed a conviction of being drunk on a public highway after officers forced him outside where he committed the acts. Code 1940, title 14, Section 120: "Any person who, while intoxicated or drunk, appears in any public place where one or more persons are present...and manifests a drunken condition by loud and boisterous or indecent conduct, or loud and profane discourse, shall, conviction, be fined."
- Held: A voluntary appearance is presupposed in the statute's text. Thus, an accusation of drunkenness in a public place cannot be established. D chose to engage in some conduct, but had no choice about what made it criminal.

## Actus Reus {#slide-10}

People v. Newton  (1970)

- Rule: Where not self-induced, unconsciousness is a complete defense to a charge of criminal homicide. Unconsciousness can exist where the subject physically acts in fact but is not, at the time, conscious of acting. 
- Facts: D was convicted of voluntary manslaughter for shooting a police officer. He testified that he had no gun during the altercation, but that he had been shot and was "unconscious or semiconscious" until he arrived at the hospital. Medical expert confirmed that he could have had a profound reflex shock reaction. 

## Actus Reus {#slide-11}

People v. Decina  (1956)

- Rule: As long as there is  one voluntary act  in the defendant's course of conduct, he  may  be criminally responsible.
- Facts: D, knowing he was subject to epileptic seizures, nonetheless voluntarily drove a car and subsequently killed four people when he lost control of the car during an epileptic seizure. He was convicted of negligent vehicular homicide even though the actual "act" that killed was itself "involuntary" because it occurred during a seizure. The earlier voluntary act of getting into the car and driving it satisfies the voluntary act element of the crime. One may be criminally culpable for involuntary acts caused by a condition if the individual knows of the condition, and disregards the possible consequences.

## Actus Reus {#slide-12}

Jones v. U.S.  (1962)

- Rule: In order for a defendant to be convicted of a crime for the failure to act, the prosecution must prove that the defendant was under a legal duty to act.
- 4 Situations where a failure to act is a breach of duty:

<!-- -->

- (1) the defendant was under a statutory obligation to care for the victim, 
- (2) the defendant was in a sufficiently close relationship with the victim, 
- (3) the defendant contractually agreed to provide care for the victim, or 
- (4) the defendant voluntarily took on the care of the victim, such that the victim was secluded from others who might have helped him. 

## Mens Rea {#slide-13}

MPC § 2.02: General Requirements of Culpability

- (1) Except as provided in §2.05 (violations) a person is not guilty of an offense unless he acted  purposefully, knowingly, recklessly, or negligently , as the law may require,  with respect to each material element of the offense . 
- (3) When the culpability sufficient to establish a material element of an offense is not prescribed by law, such element is established if a person acts  purposely, knowingly or recklessly  with respect thereto.
- (4) When the law defining an offense prescribes the kind of culpability that is sufficient for the commission of an offense, without distinguishing among the material elements thereof,  such provision shall apply to all the material elements of the offense , unless a contrary purpose plainly appears.

## Mens Rea {#slide-14}

MPC § 2.02: General Requirements of Culpability

- (5) When the law provides that negligence suffices to establish an element of an offense, such element also is established if a person acts purposely, knowingly or recklessly. When recklessness suffices to establish an element, such element also is established if a person acts purposely or knowingly. When acting knowingly suffices to establish an element, such element also is established if a person acts purposely.
- (7) When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge is established if a person is aware of a high probability of its existence, unless he actually believes that it does not exist.
- (8) A requirement that an offense be committed willfully is satisfied if a person acts knowingly with respect to the material ele­ments of the offense, unless a purpose to impose further requirements appears.

  Recklessly             A gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a law-abiding person would observe in the actor's situation   Consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material ele­ment exists or will result from his conduct   
  Negligently            A gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the actor's situation.      He should be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct    

## Mens Rea {#slide-16}

Regina v. Cunningham  (1957)

- Rule: Malice requires that the defendant foresaw, and recklessly disregarded, the harm caused by his actions.

<!-- -->

- Malice = intent or reckless disregard

<!-- -->

- Facts: Appellant tore gas meter from wall to get \$\$ and in so doing caused a gas leak leading to the partial asphyxiation of his mother in law. He is charged with maliciously administering a noxious thing. Trial judge instructed jury that malicious meant wicked.

## Mens Rea {#slide-17}

Regina v. Faulkner  (1877)

- Rule: A defendant cannot be convicted for an act that is the unintended and unforeseeable consequence of a lesser offense.
- Facts: D was trying to steal rum from ship, lit a match and accidentally set ship on fire, destroying it. Convicted of both arson and theft by lower court w/ instruction that if jury found him guilty of theft and believed fire took place during theft, he should be found guilty of both.

## Mens Rea {#slide-18}

State v. Hazelwood  (1997)

- Rule: A n ordinary (civil) negligence standard is constitutionally sufficient to impose criminal punishment for conduct that society seeks to deter.
- Facts:  D ran his oil tanker into reef, causing huge oil spill, statute said if this was done negligently he could get jail time. Trial judge said negligence meant failure to perceive a risk that is of the degree that such failure constitutes a deviation from the reasonable "standard of care".

Santillanes v. New Mexico  (1993)

- Rule: The mens rea element of negligence in the state's child abuse statute requires a showing of criminal negligence, not ordinary civil negligence.
- Facts: D cut his 7 y.o. nephew's neck during altercation. Convicted of child abuse which had a mens rea of negligence; trial court gave ordinary negligence jury instruction.

## Mens Rea {#slide-20}

Elonis v. United States  (2015)

- Rule:  Criminal statutes generally include a requirement that a person is aware that he or she is committing a crime, even if the statute does not explicitly contain such a mens rea requirement.
- Facts: D  posted violent language directed at his estranged wife online. U.S. charged D with making interstate threats in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 875(c). Section 875(c) did not contain any required mens rea.

  In-Class Example: being eighteen years old or more with intent to cause physical injury to a person less than eleven years old, the defendant recklessly engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of serious physical injury to such person, and thereby causes the death of such person.

## The Constitutional Limits of Punishment {#slide-24}

The Requirement of Legality

No Vagueness

Ban on Status Crimes

## The Requirement of Legality {#slide-25}

Prohibition on retroactive criminal lawmaking

- A person may not be punished unless their conduct was defined as criminal  before  they acted

Keeler v. Superior Court  (1970)

- Rule: Due process requires fair warning that the behavior is criminal.
- Facts: Man purposely kicked ex-wife in abdomen and fetus was stillborn.

## The Requirement of Legality {#slide-26}

Rogers v. Tennessee  (2001)

- Rule: Courts may engage in "incremental and reasoned development" of precedent, as long as a court's decision is not "unexpected and indefensible." Abolished the year and a day rule.
- Facts: Rogers stabbed victim, who died 15 months later due to the stabbing. An old common law rule (the year and a day rule) was that a victim must die within one year and one day of the act for it to constitute murder.

## No Vagueness {#slide-27}

City of Chicago v. Morales  (1999)

- Rule: "A law fails to meet the requirements of the Due Process Clause if it is so vague and standardless that it leaves the public uncertain as to the conduct is prohibits." The ordinance's definition of loitering as "to remain in any one place with no apparent purpose" does not provide adequate notice of what is permitted and prohibited. 
- Facts: Morales was arrested and found guilty under an Illinois ordinance after ignoring police orders to disperse. 

Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville  (1972)

- Jacksonville's vagrancy ordinance declared unconstitutionally vague. Established rule that laws must be clearly defined.

## Ban on Status Crimes {#slide-28}

Robinson v. California  (1962)

- Rule: It would be cruel and unusual punishment to punish a person based solely on status, rather than criminal acts.
- Facts: D convicted under CA statute for being addicted to narcotics.

## Homicide {#slide-29}

Old Common Law Categories

- Murder - homicide with "malice aforethought"

<!-- -->

- Premeditated - formed a plan ahead of time
- The intention to kill a human being
- The intention to inflict grievous bodily injury on another
- "Depraved heart" - an extremely reckless disregard for the value of human life
- The intention to commit a felony during the commission or attempted commission to which a death results

<!-- -->

- Manslaughter - homicide without malice

<!-- -->

- Voluntary

<!-- -->

- "Sudden heat"
- Imperfect self defense

<!-- -->

- Involuntary

<!-- -->

- "Unlawful manner and without due caution and circumspection"

## Slide 30

## Homicide {#slide-31}

MPC § 210

- 210.2 Murder

<!-- -->

- Homicide with a mens rea of purpose, knowing, or recklessness with extreme  indifference to human life
- Felony murder - extreme indifference recklessness is presumed if engaged in robbery, rape, arson, burglary, kidnapping, or felonious escape

<!-- -->

- 210.3 Manslaughter

<!-- -->

- Homicide with recklessness (without extreme indifference)
- Murder if done under extreme mental or emotional disturbance with a subjectively reasonable explanation or excuse

<!-- -->

- 210.4 Negligent Homicide

<!-- -->

- Homicide with negligence

## Intended Killings {#slide-32}

Commonwealth v. Carroll  (1963)

- Facts: D shot wife in head twice during the course of an argument & disposed of body. He pled guilty to murder and was tried by judge w/o jury, court found guilty of first degree murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment. 
- Statute: PA murder statute divided the crime into 2 degrees- 1st degree murder is killing that is "willful, deliberate, and premeditated", a specific intent to kill 
- Issue: Does the evidence only sustain a conviction of murder in the second degree because it shows the homicide was not premeditated or intentional?
- Holding / Rule: No, 1st degree appropriate here, premeditation doesn't have a specific temporal dimension & psychiatrist's testimony about his rage & panic is not dispositive

## Intended Killings {#slide-33}

State v. Guthrie  (1995)

- Facts : D got into argument w/co worker and stabbed him in the neck and and arm. D has a lot of psych issues and is convicted of 1st degree murder (which included any willful, deliberate, and premeditated killing). Jury instructions said premeditation means intent to kill need exist 'only for an instant' 
- Issue: Does the jury instruction give enough information to distinguish between first and second degree killing?
- Holding / Rule: No, premeditation requires some period between the formation of the intent to kill & actual killing which indicates some reflection

## Intended Killings - Heat of Passion {#slide-34}

Girouard v. State  (1991)

- Facts: Girouard and wife got into argument. Wife told Girouard she wanted a divorce and she had filed charges against him for abuse. She asked, "What are you going to do?" and Girouard took out a knife he had hidden behind pillow and stabbed her 19 times
- Holding: Here there was not adequate provocation to reduce murder to manslaughter because "words alone are not adequate provocation" and Girouard could not have reasonably feared bodily harm
- Rule: Words are regarded sufficient provocation if they are both:

<!-- -->

- Calculated to inflame the passion of a reasonable man and tend to cause him to act for the moment from passion rather than reason
- And accompanied by conduct indicating a present intention and ability to cause the defendant bodily harm

## Intended Killings - Heat of Passion {#slide-35}

Maher v. People  (1862)

- Facts: Maher suspected his wife was having an affair w/ Hunt, saw them disappear into the woods together. When they reappeared, Maher followed Hunt to a saloon and shot Hunt (but non-fatal wound). Maher was charged w/ assault w/ intent to commit murder
- Holding: Evidence of provocation should have been admitted here because it would have been "competent of a jury to find that the action was committed in consequence of the passion excited by the provocation"
- Rule: Softens the "words alone are not enough" rule and holds that provocation is a jury question (This is minority view)

## Intended Killings - Heat of Passion {#slide-36}

People v. Casassa  (1980)

- Facts: Casassa's girlfriend broke up with him and he stalked her. He brought her gifts and when she rejected them he stabbed her several times in the throat.
- Statute: NYPL based on MPC provides it is an affirmative defense to the crime of second-degree murder where D acted under EED for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse. Because this is affirmative defense in statute, burden of proof is on D.
- Holding: Excuse of EED was not reasonable here.
- Reasoning:

<!-- -->

- First question is subjective: Was this particular defendant in some emotional distress? Answer is yes.
- Second question is objective/subjective: Was the fact that he was in EED reasonably justifiable by looking at the situation from the defendant's viewpoint? Answer is no. This wasn't reasonable.

## Felony Murder {#slide-37}

Common Law

- Causing death in the course of perpetrating another felony. Doesn't require a distinct mens rea to kill; the intent to commit felony accounts for the mens rea that resulted in the death of victim.

MPC 201.2

- No standalone felony murder provision. But creates a presumption of recklessness +extreme indifference when a homicide occurs during the commission of certain felonies. 
- MPC doesn't like the felony murder rule, but most states nonetheless retain some form of the rule.

Causal Limitations on Felony Murder

- Agency theory: Imposes liability only when the killing is by the felon or one of his agents. Majority rule.
- Proximate cause theory: Liability attaches for any death proximately resulting from the unlawful activity. Minority rule.
