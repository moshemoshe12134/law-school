## Criminal Law {#slide-1}

(Most of) Weeks 4 - 6 (IV.C - VI.B)

## Unintended Killings {#slide-2}

MPC

- Unintended homicide can still fall into three categories under the MPC: Murder, Manslaughter, or Negligent Homicide
- Unintentional Murder: Committed "recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life." § 210.2(1)(b)

<!-- -->

- Similar to common law concept of depraved heart murder

<!-- -->

- Manslaughter: Committed "recklessly."

<!-- -->

- But not extreme recklessness?

<!-- -->

- Negligent Homicide: Committed "negligently."

Common Law

- Often distinguished between murder and other killings by the presence of "malice"

## Unintended Killings {#slide-3}

Commonwealth v. Malone  (Penn. 1946)

- Facts: 17-year-old killed 13-year-old while playing "Russian poker"
- Issue: Was there malice?
- Holding: Yes. Murder!
- Reasoning:

<!-- -->

- "When an individual commits an act of gross recklessness for which he must reasonably anticipate that death to another is likely to result, he exhibits that 'wickedness of disposition, hardness of heart, cruelty, recklessness of consequences, and a mind regardless of social duty' which proves that malice was present.
- Malice here is evidenced by defendant's "doing of an uncalled-for act in callous disregard of its likely harmful effects on others."
- The lack of motive is not dispositive.

## Unintended Killings {#slide-4}

Commonwealth v. Welansky  (Mass. 1944)

- Facts: D, owner of a night club in Boston, was charged with involuntary manslaughter for the death of hundreds of patrons at his club as a result of a fire. As owner of club, D had a legal duty to his invitees to use reasonable care in keeping the premises safe for their use and preventing both known and unknown dangers.
- Statute: Involuntary manslaughter through wanton or reckless conduct
- Holding: Conviction upheld. D's intentional omission was reckless because (1) he was aware that venue was not in compliance w/ local safety regulations and (2) he knew that construction plans for new part of lounge precluded the possibility of installing the doors necessary to comply w/ safety regulations.
- Takeaway: Wanton/reckless conduct = Intentional conduct, either by commission or omission that has a high likelihood that substantial harm will result. Goes beyond civil liability negligence.

## Unintended Killings {#slide-5}

People v. Hall  (Colo. 2000)

- Facts: While skiing, defendant collided with victim who was on the slope below. Victim died as a result. Defendant was charged with felony reckless manslaughter.
- Statute: Reckless manslaughter requires that a person "recklessly cause the death of another person."  

<!-- -->

- Conduct is reckless when the actor consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that death may result.

<!-- -->

- Issue: What constitutes substantial risk?
- Holding: A risk of death that has less than a 50% chance of occurring can still be substantial. Here, it was a substantial risk given how reckless D was being. A reasonably prudent person could have concluded that D created a substantial, unjustifiable risk.

## Unintended Killings {#slide-6}

State v. Williams  (Wash. Ct. App. 1971)

- Facts: Native American mother and stepfather of baby were convicted of manslaughter for negligently failing to take their baby to a doctor when he had an abscessed tooth that became infected and developed gangrene. 
- Statute: In Washington, involuntary manslaughter is committed if the death of the victim is the proximate result of simple/ordinary/civil negligence.
- Issue: Is ordinary negligence enough to find D guilty of involuntary manslaughter?
- Holding: "\[ O\]rdinary caution , i.e., the caution exercisable by  a man of reasonable prudence under the same or similar conditions , defendants were sufficiently put on notice concerning the symptoms of the baby's illness and lack of improvement . . . to have required them to have obtained medical care for the child. The  failure so to do  in this case is  ordinary or simple negligence,  and such negligence is sufficient to support a conviction of statutory manslaughter."

## Issues of Causation {#slide-7}

For result elements, the defendant's act or culpable omission MUST CAUSE THE RESULT.

- The prosecutor must prove the causal link beyond a reasonable doubt
- A problem can arise as to whether the defendant's act or culpable omission caused the result. (i.e., in homicide, when the intended death occurs in a way not intended or the unintended death occurs in an unlikely way). Intervening cause questions.

MPC

- Conduct is the cause of a result when it is an antecedent  but for which  the result in question would not have occurred (or it meets some causal requirement imposed by the code or law. § 2.03(1).
- MPC tracks the common law approach to causation for criminal liability, in which causation requirement is met when results are expected by author. 

## Issues of Causation {#slide-8}

People v. Acosta  (Cal Ct. App. 1991)

- Facts: 

<!-- -->

- Acosta led police officers on a 48-mile car chase after he was spotted in a stolen car. During the chase, Acosta ran stop signs and red lights and drove on the wrong side of streets, causing incoming traffic to scatter or swerve. 
- While monitoring the chase, two police helicopters crashed, and three people died. 
- A retired FAA investigator testified that the one of the pilots violated an FAA regulation prohibiting careless and reckless operation of an aircraft by failing to properly clear the area, not maintaining communication with the other helicopter, failing to keep the other aircraft in view at all times, and not changing his altitude. He also testified that the pilot violated another FAA regulation prohibiting operation of one aircraft so close to another as to create a collision hazard.

## Issues of Causation {#slide-9}

People v. Acosta  (Cal Ct. App. 1991)

- Holding:  Acosta's act was a proximate cause of the helicopter crash b/c there was but for causation and the result was foreseeable.  
- Reasoning:

<!-- -->

- Rule:  "The threshold question in examining causation is whether the defendant's act was an 'actual cause' of the victim's injury. It is a sine qua non test: But for the defendant's act would the injury have occurred? Unless an act is an actual cause of the injury, it will not be considered proximate cause.
- Application: "Here, but for Acosta's conduct of fleeing the police, the helicopters would never have been in position for the crash." Moreover, "\[t\]he result was not highly extraordinary. Although a two-helicopter collision was unknown to expert witness Turner and no reported cases describe one, it was 'a possible consequence which reasonably might have been contemplated.'"

## Issues of Causation {#slide-10}

People v. Acosta  (Cal Ct. App. 1991) - long version of the test

- To determine proximate causation, the court must first determine whether the defendant\'s conduct was the actual cause of the injury. 

<!-- -->

- If it was not, then there is no proximate causation. 

<!-- -->

- But if it was, then the court must go on to examine whether the result was an intended consequence of the defendant\'s conduct.

<!-- -->

- If it was, then there is proximate causation. 

<!-- -->

- If it was not, the court must then examine whether the defendant\'s conduct was a substantial factor in the harm.

<!-- -->

- If it was not, there is no proximate causation. 

<!-- -->

- But if it was, then proximate causation is established unless the result was highly extraordinary under the circumstances.

## Issues of Causation {#slide-11}

People v. Arzon  (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1978)

- Facts: 

<!-- -->

- D started a fire on the fifth floor of an abandoned building to keep warm. Firefighters responded to fight the fire. 
- Meanwhile, another fire started independently on the second floor trapped the firefighters. Overcome by smoke from the first and second fires, V, a firefighter, sustained injuries from which he died.

<!-- -->

- Issue: Did D cause V's death?
- Holding: Yes. D caused V's death.

## Issues of Causation {#slide-12}

People v. Arzon  (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1978)

- Reasoning: In all likelihood, V would not have died had someone else not set the second-story fire. Nonetheless, D's fire satisfies the "but-for" requirement: 

<!-- -->

- If D had not set the chain of events in motion, V would not have died. 
- Moreover, the court can point to D's conduct -- starting the fire -- as one component of the forces that caused the firefighter's death.
- "At the very least, the defendant's act . . . placed the deceased in a position where he was particularly vulnerable to the separate and independent force, in this instance, the fire on the second floor."
- Also, V's death could have reasonably been foreseen as being related to Arzon's act of intentionally setting a fire

<!-- -->

- Takeaway: "The defendant's conduct need not be the sole and exclusive factor in the victim's death." → Concurrent causation okay

## Why do we punish? {#slide-13}

Broadly speaking, the justifications for punishment fall into two large cat­egories,  retributive  and  utilitarian . 

- "\[A\] retributivist claims that punishment is justified because people deserve it; a utilitarian believes that justification lies in the useful purposes that punishment serves (the latter approach is sometimes referred to as 'consequentialist,' or 'instrumentalist')."

Retribution

- Punish for past conduct deserving of punishment

Utilitarianism

- Attempt to maximize utility (minimize suffering broadly)
- Deterrence, Incapacitation, and Rehabilitation

## Why do we punish? - Retribution {#slide-14}

Punishment is justified to the extent the criminal deserves it

- Lex talionis:  "eye for an eye"
- Backwards looking

Kant : Crimes are  moral wrongs  because they violate  categorical imperatives  (the penal law)

- The touchstone is  moral blameworthiness

Hegel : By committing a crime, the criminal authorizes/assumes  like  treatment to annul the crime

- But what sentence is equal to rape? Murder? Conspiracy?

Moore : Retribution is the view that punishment is justified by the moral culpability of those who receive it.

Morris : Criminals violate the social contract, so it is fair to punish them.

## Why do we punish? - Utilitarianism {#slide-15}

Deterrence

- Benefit of crime to D \> probability of punishment x severity of punishment

<!-- -->

- Ineffective deterrent

<!-- -->

- Benefit of crime to D \< probability of punishment x severity of punishment

<!-- -->

- Effective deterrent

<!-- -->

- General deterrence : D's punishment is meant to deter the general community

<!-- -->

- "Make an example of him"

<!-- -->

- Specific deterrence : D's punishment is meant to deter specifically D's future misconduct
- Forward-looking: looks to  consequences  of punishment
- Jeremy Bentham:  Punishment should only be used in order to "exclude some greater evil"
- Deterrence assumes the evil of punishment and is only valuable to the extent it produces some socially valuable result, i.e., less crime.

## Why do we punish? - Utilitarianism {#slide-16}

Incapacitation

- D's imprisonment physically prevents him from committing crime ( Zimring ;  Dilulio )

Rehabilitation

- D's punishment prevents crime by social conditioning and moral instruction

<!-- -->

- Militarization in punishment ( Foucault ); straightening of a cooked tree

<!-- -->

- Makes them safer for society upon reintegration
- Vitiello:  "Moral imperative to offer the offenders  chance at  moral transformation "

## Slide 17

  Retribution           Blameworthiness; Backward looking                            Moral standards of blameworthiness are not necessarily tied to utility What then is the standard for blame; what is the deontological principle? Does it necessarily conflict with utilitarianism? How then should we decide how much to punish?

## Capital Punishment {#slide-21}

MPC 210.6

- (1) Circumstances that exclude imposition of the death penalty
- (2) Procedural requirements for a death sentence, namely a separate proceeding
- (3) Aggravating circumstances

<!-- -->

- Committed by convict under sentence of imprisonment

- Knowingly created a great risk of death to many persons
- Committed while engaging in a violent felony
- Committed for the purpose of avoiding or preventing a lawful arrest or effecting an escape from lawful custody
- Committed for pecuniary gain
- Especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel, manifesting exceptional depravity

## Capital Punishment {#slide-22}

MPC 210.6

- (4) Mitigating circumstances

<!-- -->

- No  significant history of prior criminal activity
- Committed while Dwas under influence of extreme emotional disturbance
- Victim was participant in D's homicidal conduct or consented to homicidal act
- Committed under circumstances  D believed provided moral justification or extenuation for conduct
- Accomplice in a murder committed by another person and his participation was relatively minor
- Acted under duress or under the domination of another person
- At time of murder, capacity of D to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to requirements of law was impaired by mental disease or intoxication
- Youth of the defendant at time of murder

## Capital Punishment {#slide-23}

Gregg v. Georgia  (1976)

- Issue: Whether the death sentence for murder is a per se violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.
- Holding: The statutory system under which Gregg was sentenced to death does not violate the Constitution.
- Reasoning: "\[T\]he concerns expressed in  Furman  that the penalty of death not be imposed in an arbitrary or capricious manner can be met by a carefully drafted statute that ensures that the sentencing authority is given adequate information and guidance."

## Capital Punishment {#slide-24}

Atkins v. Virginia  (2002)

- Holding: Intellectually disabled (then termed "mentally retarted") defendants cannot be sentenced to death.
- Reasoning

<!-- -->

- DP doesn't serve the purposes for punishment (deterrence, retribution, etc.)
- Lesser capacity to show mitigation
- Special risk of wrongful execution

## Capital Punishment {#slide-25}

Steiker & Steiker,  Sober Second Thoughts

- A critique of the Court's treatment of the death penalty

<!-- -->

- As we have moved further from Furman, we haven't taken seriously the calls the Court made for state legislatures to impose objective standard by which we are deciding whether people should be put to death.

<!-- -->

- There should be more guidelines for the death penalty. Processes in states are still not sufficient.

<!-- -->

- Gregg court invoked need for "heightened reliability" in death penalty cases, but the reality is that the procedural protections in death penalty cases are not that robust

<!-- -->

- Numerous contexts in which death penalty cases receive no additional safeguards such as inadequate representation

## Capital Punishment {#slide-26}

Steiker & Steiker,  Sober Second Thoughts

- Perceptions of death penalty jurisprudence

<!-- -->

- S ome critics claim that the Court\'s work has burdened the administration of capital punishment with an overly complex, absurdly arcane, and minutely detailed body of constitutional law that obstructs, delays, and defeats the administration of CP
- Some claim that SCOTUS has turned its back on regulating the death penalty and no longer even attempts to meet the concerns about the arbitrary and discriminatory imposition of death that animated its \"constitutionalization\" of capital punishment in Furman
- Both sets of criticisms of the Court\'s work are substantially correct:

<!-- -->

- The death penalty is, perversely, both over- and under-regulated. 
- The body of doctrine produced by the Court is enormously complex and its applicability to specific cases difficult to discern; yet, it remains unresponsive to the central animating concerns that inspired the Court to embark on its regulatory regime in the first place.

## Capital Punishment {#slide-27}

Steiker & Steiker,  Sober Second Thoughts

- Legitimation theory - normative legitimation - to show or affirm to be justified: 3 basic levels:

<!-- -->

- Internal legitimation - the extent to which legal discourse and doctrine affect the way actors within the legal system perceive the system and their role within it
- Particular external legitimation - extent to which legal discourse and doctrine affect the way people in general view a specific social practice
- General external legitimation - extent to which legal discourse and doctrine affect the way people in general view the social structure writ large.

<!-- -->

- My takeaway: CP reforms haven't accomplished much beyond more-or-less tricking the public and even practitioners within the law to believe CP is a seriously regulated, and therefore legitimate, practice.

## Capital Punishment {#slide-28}

McCleskey v. Kemp  (1987)

- Facts: Baldus study data showed  a racial disparity in the imposition of death sentences. McCleskey, a black man convicted of killing a white police officer, challenges his death sentence on the basis that the Baldus study demonstrates that the Georgia capital sentencing process is administered in a racially discriminatory manner in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.
- Holding: no constitutional issues here
- 14th amendment reasoning

<!-- -->

- "We would demand exceptionally clear proof" of purposeful discrimination and the Baldus study doesn't show that

<!-- -->

- 8th amendment Holding

<!-- -->

- At what point is the risk of prejudice influencing a jury's decision in a criminal case constitutionally unacceptable?
- The Baldus study does not demonstrate a constitutionally significant risk of racial bias affected the Georgia capital-sentencing process.

## Capital Punishment {#slide-29}

McCleskey v. Kemp  (1987)

- Other concerns for the court:

<!-- -->

- The Court needs evidence of discriminatory intent
- Accepting McCleskey's claim that racial bias has impermissibly tainted capital sentencing would open the floodgates for the court to soon face similar claims as to other types of penalties.
- McCleskey's arguments are best left to the legislature. 

## Capital Punishment {#slide-30}

Lawrence,  The Id, the Ego, and Equal Protection

- Attacking Washington v. Davis decision saying that what matters is  discriminatory intent.

<!-- -->

- If just looking at discriminatory intent, makes it really hard to show facts to say, for the same crime, more black people are getting the death penalty. This entrenches racism in system that is systematically putting people to death. 

<!-- -->

- Suggested new test: 	Evaluate governmental conduct to determine whether it conveys a symbolic message to which the culture attaches racial significance. A finding that the culture thinks of an allegedly discriminatory governmental action in racial terms would also constitute a finding regarding the beliefs and motivations of the governmental actors...Therefore, the court would apply strict scrutiny.
