## Key Death Penalty Concepts {#slide-3}

The Death Penalty is adminsitered in an overwhelmingly discriminatory way, along racial and class lines.

Many different stages of review (9 boxes), but very  difficult  via standards of review and  procedural  barriers to overturn a death penalty sentence.

 Key Supreme Court Cases:  Furman v. Georgia  (1972);  McCleskey v. Kemp  (1987) ,  Adkins v. Virginia  (2002)

Only  some  murders are death-penalty eligible, and there must be a sentencing hearing for mitigating/aggravating evidence.

Different "narrowing statutes" e.g. pyramid statutes, weighing statutes

## CW//Lynching as a Precursor to Capital Punishment {#slide-5}

Between Civil War and WWII, white people lynched 1000s of Black people.

Similar reign of terror in US/Mexico border states

Public acts of violence & torture that tramuatized whole communities

## Gregg v. Georgia  (1976) {#slide-6}

- Facts :  Gregg convicted of death-eligible homicides. The jury imposed the death penalty pursuant to statutory guidelines.
- Issue :  Whether the death sentence of murder is a per se violation of the Eight (cruel and unusual punishment) and Fourteenth (equal protection/due process) Amendments
- Holding :  No, and Georgia's death penalty statute does not violate the Constitution.

<!-- -->

- Under  Furman , the imposition of the death penalty cannot be arbitrary or capricious.
- Here, we have a carefully drafted statute that ensures the sentencing authority has enough information and guidance.
- Georgia's statute (described on pp. 570--572) is adequately particularized to the defendant's circumstances

## McCleskey v. Kemp   ( 1987 ) {#slide-7}

- Facts : McCleskey convicted of murder in the course of a robbery in Georgia (intentional felony-murder); sentencing jury finds aggravating circumstances of i) felony-murder, ii) murder of a police officer. No mitigating evidence. Jury recommends death.
- Issue : Whether a statistical study (Baldus) indicating a risk that racial considerations enter into capital sentencing determinations violates the Eighth Amendment. 
- Baldus study introduced in Habeaus Corpus patient (Box 9) shows disparate impact of death penalty imposition based on the race of the victim. → Defendants charged with killing white victims 4.3 times more likely to receive a death sentence.
- Legal Claims: 1) Equal protection; 2) Eighth Amendment cruel and unusual claim.
- Holding: Court finds McCleskey cannot prove the intent to discriminate requirement in the Equal protection claim. Court finds that the legal system requires discretion and that ultimately 4.3 times risk is not constitutionally sufficient bias.

## Atkins v. Virginia (2002) {#slide-8}

- Facts :  Atkins was convicted of a death-eligible murder. An expert witness testified that he was "mildly mentally retarded." Evidence showed he had an IQ of only 59. Atkins was sentenced to death.
- Issue :  Whether the Eighth Amendment prohibits death sentences for mentally retarded defendants.
- Holding :  Yes, it is a cruel and unusual punishment.

<!-- -->

- It is consensus that mentally retarded/intellectually handicapped people are less culpable for their conduct than those with "normal" intellectual capacities. Administering like punishment for unequal culpability offends  retributive  notions.
- They are also less deterred because of their lesser ability to process information, control impulses, etc., which offends notions of  deterrence .
- Also less capable of providing meaningful assistance to counsel to defend their cases.

MPC § 210.6

- Committed while engaging in a violent felony
- Committed for the purpose of avoiding or preventing a lawful arrest or effecting an escape from lawful custody
- Committed for pecuniary gain
- Especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel, manifesting exceptional depravity 

## Capital Punishment: Model Penal Code {#slide-10}

MPC § 210.6 

- (4) Mitigating circumstances

<!-- -->

- No significant history of prior criminal activity
- Committed while defendant was influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance
- Victim was participant in defendant's homicidal conduct or consented to homicidal act
- Committed under circumstances which the defendant believed to provide a moral justification or extenuation for his conduct
- Accomplice in a murder committed by another person and his participation was relatively minor
- Acted under duress or under the domination of another person
- At time of murder, capacity of defendant to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to requirements of law was impaired by mental disease or intoxication
- Youth of the defendant at time of murder

## Causation {#slide-12}

MPC § 2.03(1)

Conduct is the cause of a result when:

- (1) it is an antecedent but for which the result in question would not have occurred;
- (2) the relationship between the conduct and result satisfies any additional causal requirements imposed by the Code or by the law defining the offense.

<!-- -->

- The MPC automatically requires factual or "but for" cause.
- Proximate cause comes into play according to the statute or jurisdiction.

Note

Issues of causation usually arise in (1) unintended killings or (2) intended killings that occur in an unintended manner.
