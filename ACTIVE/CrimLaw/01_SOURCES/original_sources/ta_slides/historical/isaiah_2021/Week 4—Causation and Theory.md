## Causation---MPC {#slide-3}

MPC § 2.03(1)

Conduct is the cause of a result when:

(1) it is an antecedent but for which the result in question would not have occurred;

(2) the relationship between the conduct and result satisfies any additional causal requirements imposed by the Code or by the law defining the offense.

The MPC automatically requires factual or "but for" cause.

Proximate cause comes into play according to the statute or jurisdiction.

Note

Issues of causation usually arise in (1) unintended killings or (2) intended killings that occur in an unintended manner.

## Causation:  Unintended Homicide {#slide-4}

People v. Acosta  (Cal. Ct. App. 1991)

Facts :  Acosta led police officers on a 48-mile car chase after he was spotted in a stolen car. During the chase, Acosta ran stop signs and red lights and drove on the wrong side of streets, causing incoming traffic to scatter or swerve. While monitoring the chase, two police helicopters (one from Costa Mesa, one from Newport Beach) crashed, and three people in the Costa Mesa helicopter died. A retired FAA investigator testified that the pilots violated several FAA regulations..

Issue :  Whether the deaths were foreseeable (and not highly extraordinary).

## Causation:  Unintended Homicide {#slide-5}

People v. Acosta  (Cal. Ct. App. 1991)

Holding :  Acosta's conduct was the proximate cause of the deaths.

Reasoning :  But for Acosta's conduct of fleeing the police, the helicopters would never have been in a position to crash. The deaths were not highly extraordinary and reasonably might have been contemplated.

A foreseeability inquiry considers whether or not the result---here, death---was highly extraordinary.

Pretty low bar for foreseeability., honestly. 

## Theories of punishment---Why we Punish {#slide-6}

- Retribution (Kant/Moore/Morris)

Punishment is justified because offenders deserve it. 

-   Utilitarianism

Deterrence (Bentham)

Punishment should be geared at deterring crime and undesirable conduct

Incapacitation ( Dilulio )

Punishment is about holding "dangerous" individuals 

Rehabilitation ( Vitiello /Moore)

Punishment is intended to fix/heal individuals society deemed to be "abnormal" in some way.

## Theoretical Interlude {#slide-7}

Some Takeaways

Society often thinks of the criminal law as upholding moral values more so than other areas of the law. We often think of murder, rape, etc. as offending some moral sense of inherent or God-given human dignity (Kant). It's an area of the law where law students have built-in conceptions of right and wrong, more so than when we first studied the merits of the Statute of Frauds.

But modern criminal law is still very much rooted in a tradition dominated by the elite White men that wrote the MPC. The contours of the criminal law are no differently established than the UCC or Restatement of Torts. The MPC, the UCC, and the Restatement all just showed best practices within their respective areas of the law. They made no claim as to what was formalistically right or good.

So why do we emphasize the need for the criminal law to uphold some sense justice external to the criminal law itself and how do we justify our intuitions of what the criminal law should be? 

That's where law & economics and critical theory come in. They fill in the gaps left by a purely procedural or "reasonable" understanding of the law.
