## Insanity and Attempt Liability {#slide-1}

Week 10---April 1, 2021

## Mental Health and Criminal Law   {#slide-2}

- Rates of Institutionalization have remained steady

<!-- -->

- Mental hospital rate was much higher in years past 
- Recently a sharp increase  in prison and jail populations in tandem with falling mental hospital rates.

<!-- -->

- Similar trends across countries

<!-- -->

- Different Demographic Distribution

## Insanity Defense Standards  {#slide-3}

M'Naghten Rule ---Looks at cognition, someone's ability to understand what they are doing.

Volitional prong ---Expanding insanity defense; an actor understands right from wrong, but cannot stop themself.

Trial of John Hinkley. Found not guilty by way of insanity for an assinsaiton attempt. 

## Requirements and Timing {#slide-4}

## Insanity Defense Standards {#slide-5}

- Actor is incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong;  or
- Unconscious at the time of the act;  or 
- Can distinguish right and wrong but actions are beyond their control
- Blake v. United States  (1969)

<!-- -->

- Everyone is presumed to be sane.
- Cognition rule---Must prove---at the time of the criminal act---that actor did not  know  the nature and quality of what they were doing  or  did not know what they were doing was wrong by way of mental disease/defect.

<!-- -->

- Act is committed under an irresistible impulse which completely deprives the defendant of the power of choice or  volition .
- Someone who understands what they are doing is wrong, but can't contain themself.

<!-- -->

- "As a result of mental disease or defect, defendant lacks  substantial capacity  either to appreciate the  criminality  \[wrongfulness\] of his conduct  or  to  conform his conduct  to the requirements of the law."

## Andrea Yates Case {#slide-6}

-  M'Naghten rule

<!-- -->

- Some evidence suggests that because she knows she will be punished, so she must have known that it was wrong legally. Whether Yates knew that it was  morally  wrong is less clear.

<!-- -->

- Irresistible Impulse

<!-- -->

- The interview suggest she thought the only thing she could do was drown her children. However, it's based off a cognition that seems irrational.

<!-- -->

- Davis Standard

<!-- -->

- Doesn't add anything new to the analysis.

<!-- -->

- MPC

<!-- -->

- Substantial appreciation lowers the standard, seemingly easier to meet than M'Naghten rule. So although it's still unclear whether she knew right v. wrong, the MPC standard would seem to benefit her. 

<!-- -->

- Durham Test

<!-- -->

- Could go either way, but ultimately it would turn on whether this was the product of her disease, which would help Yates.

- Homicide charge: Mother Andrea Yates was suffering from postpartum psychosis and drowned her five kids.
- Evidence

<!-- -->

- Interview with detectives where she admits to drowning the kids because she felt that she needed to be punished for being a bad mother. 
- In her jail cell she talked about visions of Satan after being  put on medication. 
- Interview with psychiatrist---knew it was wrong, but felt she had to.
- Texas Law---Cognition (similar to M'Naghten rule)

<!-- -->

- Found not guilty by way of insanity

Standards 

## Post-Hinkley {#slide-7}

- Federal Insanity Defense Reform Act (1984)

<!-- -->

- ALI prong 1---cognition

<!-- -->

- M'Naghten Rule (21 states)
- Minority of states retain MPC (22 states) 

<!-- -->

- NY Penal code §40.15 similar to MPC

<!-- -->

- Complete abolition of insanity defense in some states

<!-- -->

- Affirmed as constitutional in  Kahler v. Kansas  (2020)
- Go back to mens rea

## Attempt: MPC  {#slide-9}

MPC § 5.01

(1)  A person is guilty of attempt if, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for commission of the crime, he:

- (a) purposely engages in conduct which would constitute the crime if the attendant circumstances were as he believes them to be;
- (b) when causing a particular result is an element of the crime, does or omits to do anything with the purpose of causing or with the belief that it will cause such result without further conduct on his part; OR
- (c) purposely does or omits to do anything which, under the circumstances as he believes them to be, is an act or omission constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in his commission of the crime.

## Attempt: MPC  {#slide-10}

MPC § 5.01

(2) Substantial step under (1)(c) requires "strongly corroborative of the actor's criminal purpose." The following may prove a substantial step:

- (a) lying in waiting, searching for, or following the contemplated victim
- (b) enticing or seeking to entice the contemplated victim of the crime to go to the place contemplated for its commission
- (c) reconnoitering the place contemplated for the commission of the crime
- (d) possession of materials to be used for committing the crime, which are specially designed for such use or which serve no lawful purpose under the circumstances
- (e) possession, collection, or fabrication of materials to be used in the crime, at or near contemplated place of crime, where such possession, collection, or fabrication serves no lawful purpose under the circumstances
- (f) soliciting an innocent agent to engage in conduct constituting an element of crime

## People v. Rizzo  (N.Y. 1927) {#slide-11}

- Facts :  Defendant was with a group planning to rob Charles Rao while on his way to cash his paycheck. Rizzo and the crew drove around looking for their target, but they never found him. Police arrested them before they could rob Rao. 
- Issue :  Whether the steps taken by the defendant constitute attempt to commit robbery 
- Holding :  This is not attempt to commit robbery, merely preparation.

<!-- -->

- The law doesn't recognized mere preparation tending towards the commission of a crime.
- The acts tending towards the commission of a crime must be so near to its accomplishment that in all reasonable probability the crime itself would've been committed, but for timely interference.
- There must be dangerous proximity to success ( Hyde ).
