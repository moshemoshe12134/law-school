## Unintended killings: Felony-Murder {#slide-4}

Regina v.  Serne  (England 1887)

Facts:  Leon  Serné  and his family were in severe debt, living in house above a store in London.  Serné  had taken out a life insurance policy on his son  Sjaak  (an "imbecile"), and insured store inventory, furniture, and rent. Within a month the store and house burned down and both his sons died. At trial, prosecution introduced evidence that  Serné  and Goldfinch had been seen together in the shop shortly before the fire started. It was alleged they willfully set fire and were indicted for  Sjaak's  murder.

Holding:  Only an action taken w/ intent to commit a felony that is known to create a danger to human life can constitute felony murder.

Takeaway:  Serné  Jury Instruction:

- Malice   doesn't mean anything by itself, but is merely a legal vehicle that we use to create law. 
- Harcourt:  "There is no natural relationship between the language we use and what we are trying to describe."

Rule:  When one does an act known to be dangerous to life, for the purpose of committing a felony, the act is chargeable as murder.

## Unintended killings: Felony-Murder {#slide-5}

State v. Canola  (N.J. 1977) --- Agency Theory

Facts:  Jewelry store owner resisted an attempted armed robbery by defendant (Canola) and his accomplices. One accomplice and the store owner exchanged gunfire, both died. Defendant and two accomplices indicted on one count of robbery and two counts of murder (store owner and co-felon). Defendant found guilty on both murder counts and sentenced to two concurrent terms of life imprisonment.

Issue:  Under NJ law, can a defendant be found guilty of felony murder when during his robbery of a store one of the robbery victims shoots one of the defendant's accomplices?

Holding:  No, under NJ law, a defendant cannot be found guilty of the killing of an accomplice by the armed robbery victim.

## MPC---Homicide {#slide-7}

MPC 210.2

Homicide is murder when 

A) committed purposely or knowingly; or

B) it is committed recklessly under circumstances manifesting  extreme indifference  to the value of human life. Such recklessness and indifference are presumed if the actor is engaged in the commission of a \[violent\] felony.

MPC 2.02

C) Recklessly. A person acts recklessly with respect to a material element of an offense when he  consciously  disregards a  substantial and unjustifiable risk  that the material element exists or will result from his conduct. The risk must be of such nature and degree . . . Its disregard involves a gross deviation from the standard of care

## Unintended killings: Depraved heart murder {#slide-9}

Commonwealth v. Malone  (PA 1946)

- Facts:  17-year-old killed 13-year-old while playing "Russian roulette."
- Issue:  Whether malice was present.
- Holding:  The charge of murder was correct.
- Reasoning:
- "When an individual commits an act of gross recklessness for which he must reasonably anticipate that death to another is  likely  to result, he exhibits that 'wickedness of disposition, hardness of heart, cruelty, recklessness of consequences, and a mind regardless of social duty' which proves that malice was present.
- Malice here is evidenced by defendant's "doing of an uncalled-for act in callous disregard of its likely harmful effects on others."
- Intentional Act   pulling the trigger
- Mens  Rea  Reckless and wanton disregard for the consequences of the act

## Unintended Killings: Involuntary manslaughter {#slide-10}

Commonwealth v.  Welansky  (MA 1944)

- Facts:  D, owner of a night club in Boston, was charged with involuntary manslaughter for the death of hundreds of patrons at his club as a result of a fire. As owner of club, D had a legal duty to his invitees to use reasonable care in keeping the premises safe for their use and preventing both known and unknown dangers.
- Statute:  Involuntary manslaughter through wanton or reckless conduct
- Holding:  Conviction upheld. D's intentional omission was reckless because (1) he was aware that venue was not in compliance w/ local safety regulations and (2) he knew that construction plans for new part of lounge precluded the possibility of installing the doors necessary to comply w/ safety regulations.
- Takeaway:  Wanton/reckless conduct = Intentional conduct, either by commission or omission that has a high likelihood that substantial harm will result. Goes beyond civil liability negligence.

## Unintended killings {#slide-11}

People v. Hall 

Facts :  While skiing, D collided with V who was on the slope below. V died as a result. D was charged with felony reckless manslaughter. 

Under Colorado  statute: reckless manslaughter requires that a person "recklessly cause the death of another person" by consciously disregarding a substantial and unjustifiable risk.

Case turned on what a "substantial risk" is. Lower court dismissed because the risk was not "more likely than not" to occur. 

Holding : A risk of death that has less than a 50% chance of occurring can still be substantial. Here, it was a substantial risk given how reckless D was being. A  reasonably prudent person  could have concluded that D created a substantial, unjustifiable risk. 

State v. Williams  : Statute allowed conviction of parents for negligent homicide on the basis of mere   "civil"   negligence.  Statute later amended by the WA state legislature to require at least "criminal" negligence.
