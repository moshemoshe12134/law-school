## Extending Accomplice and Conspiracy  Liability {#slide-1}

Week 11---April 12, 2021

## Slide 2

Extending criminal responsibility to individuals who  purposefully  aided and  abetted  a criminal act.

Accomplice/Complicity

Liability

## Complicity: Big Picture {#slide-3}

Can be charged with attempt along with accomplice liability

Can be convicted of  complicity  even if the principal is not convicted.

Principal can be  acquitted  and accomplice can still be convicted

Theory of liability, rather than a  separate  crime 

Punished at the same level as the  principal .

Mens rea

Two levels: i) mens rea itself; and 2) object of the mens rea

## State v.  Gladstone , Supreme Court of Washington (1970) {#slide-4}

- Facts: Thompson (informant) is hired to purchase marijuanana from Gladstone. Gladstone does not have enough to sell but he suggests he buy some from Kent, giving him an address and map to Kent's house. 
- PP: Gladstone is charged with aiding and abetting the  sale .  
- Court: Has to be associated with the principal. If  anything, Gladstone was assisting the purchase, but in this case the purchaser was an undercover cop, it's not a crime. The distinction is that Gladstone is really trying to help Thompson buys the drugs, rather than help Kent sell the drugs (Harcourt). 
- Conduct crime → MPC § 2.06(3): Gladstone might not be charge b/c he lacked the purpose of promoting the sale. 

<!-- -->

- Prosecutor would argue §2.06(3)(a)(ii)\--\> aids or attempted to aid Kent in the sale of marijuana. 

## MPC § 2.06 {#slide-5}

MPC 2.06(3))

With  the   purpose  (mens rea) of promoting or  facilitating  (actus reus) the  commission  of the offense, he:

- Solicits  such other person to com mit it; or
- Aids or attempts to aid such other p erson in planning or committing it; or
- Having a  legal  duty to prevent the commission of the  offense , fails to make proper efforts to do so

<!-- -->

- 

MPC 2.06(4)

An accomplice in the conduct causing such result is an  accomplice  in the  commission  of that offense, if he acts with the  kind  of culpability, if any, with respect to that result that is sufficient (mens rea for the underlying offense)) for the commission of that offense. 

Conduct Crime

Results Crime

## Commonwealth v. Roebuck , Supreme Court of Pennsylvania (2011) {#slide-6}

- Facts: Victim is lured to an apartment, then ambushed and shot. The defendant  participated   in the crime but did not shoot the victim. The defendant was charged with third-degree murder (mens rea recklessness)
- Court: It's a result crime, so we got to §2.06(4), where liability is imputed if the mens rea matches that of the underlying offense. The court finds that if the defendant was reckless, then they can be found guilty.
- Holding:  Defendant  can be held guilty for reckless murder without particpating in the actual killing or actually shooting a victim.

## People v. Luparello {#slide-7}

- Facts: D heartbroken after girlfriend left, married another. D thought he could discover her whereabouts from Martin (good friend of the husband). D called on his friends to find Martin and get info about her whereabouts "at any cost." The friends visited Martin, who wouldn\'t tell. Next night, the friends (w/out D present) ambushed Martin and killed him
- Procedural History: D charged and convicted of first-degree murder based on accomplice liability
- Holding: Person can be held liable for the unplanned and unintended acts of co-conspirators that are the natural, probable, and foreseeable consequences of his assistance. (Natural probable  consequences   doctrine)

<!-- -->

- Minority Rule
- MPC rejects this  interpretation→when a wholly different crime has been committed, defendant is not liable. 

## People v. Luparello {#slide-8}

- Facts: D heartbroken after girlfriend left, married another. D thought he could discover her whereabouts from Martin (good friend of the husband). D called on his friends to find Martin and get info about her whereabouts "at any cost." The friends visited Martin, who wouldn\'t tell. Next night, the friends (w/out D present) ambushed Martin and killed him
- Procedural History: D charged and convicted of first-degree murder based on accomplice liability
- Holding: Person can be held liable for the unplanned and unintended acts of co-conspirators that are the natural, probable, and foreseeable consequences of his assistance. (Natural probable consequences doctrine)

<!-- -->

- Minority Rule
- MPC rejects this interpretation→when a wholly different crime has been committed, defendant is not liable. 

## Conspiracy {#slide-9}

## Conspiracy : Big Picture {#slide-10}

A  separate  crime: working with others to commit crime

Crime intended need not be completed ( inchoate  crimes)

Does  not  merge into completed crime

Separate  count in an indictment

A possible theory of substantive  responsibility for others act.

Actus Reus

Agreement - See  Interstate Circuit

Plus an overt Act - MPC §5.03(5) (sometimes)	

Mens rea 

Knowledge 

Plus intent or inferred intent

Conspiratorial accomplice liability -  Pinkerton  (minority rule)

Benefits to the prosecution

E.g. hearsay evidence, statute of limitations.

## Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. U.S.  (1939) {#slide-11}

- Facts :  Two movie theaters entered into an agreement to fix prices with each of eight film distributors. The contracts were individual to each distributor. There was no evidence of any agreement between distributors.
- Holding :  There was a conspiracy among all eight movie distributors.
- Takeaway :  The Court may infer an agreement based on the circumstances.

## People v. Lauria  (Cal. Dist. Ct. App. 1967) {#slide-12}

- Facts :  Lauria operated a telephone answering services for prostitutes to be connected with clients. Law enforcement was investigating the prostitutes and also went for the telephone service. Defendant knew some of his customers were prostitutes. Prosecutors wanted to prove knowledge of the prostitution.
- Rule :  The People need show more than a tacit, mutual understanding between co-conspirators to accomplish an unlawful act, some level of intent to participate in the conspiracy 
- Holding :  Lauria is not guilty of conspiracy because his knowledge/involvement didn't rise to the level of intent to participate in a criminal conspiracy.

<!-- -->

- We do not believe an inference of intent drawn from knowledge of criminal use properly applies to the less serious crimes classified as misdemeanors.
- Positive knowledge of the supplier that his products or services are being used for criminal purposes does not alone establish an intent of the supplier to participate in the misdemeanors.

## Pinkerton v. U.S.  (1946) {#slide-13}

- Facts :  Pinkerton brothers live on a farm. They were indicted for tax-related violations. The indictment contains 10 substantive counts and 1 conspiracy count.
- Holding :  There was enough evidence to submit to the jury the question of Daniel's participation in the conspiracy.

<!-- -->

- You don't need direct evidence of participation in the criminal conduct, as long as there's a continuous conspiracy. 
- Acts of one conspirator may be attributed to the act of all.

<!-- -->

- Pinkerton  Rule :  You are liable for the substantive offense committed by a co-conspirator if:

<!-- -->

- The act was in furtherance of the conspiracy;
- The act was within the scope of the unlawful project; AND
- The act was foreseeable as a necessary and natural consequence of the agreement
