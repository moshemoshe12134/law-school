Story in three parts:

- Ancien regime : period of brutal punishments in which sovereign power marks the body (torture & mutilation as a public spectacle)
- 18 th  century : softer punishment 
- 19th century:  movement towards modern punishment/carceral system

<!-- -->

- Disappearance of spectacle
- Elimination of physical pain (punishment of the  soul )

Some takeaways:

- Examination of punishment from  ancien régime  onward

<!-- -->

- move from the spectacle to prisons/surveillance; from the amphitheater to the panopticon  

<!-- -->

- Punishment of people for  who they are -  transformation of petty crimes into moral wrongs: birth of the  penitentiary

<!-- -->

- Framing crime as a moral failure of the criminal keeps people from questioning and criticizing the penitentiary system and the larger criminal justice system

<!-- -->

- Elimination of physical pain (punishment is not about the body, but the soul). We moved from a period that was viewed as barbaric to one where we "punish better."
- Orthopedics of power (every tree can be straightened; every person can be made a docile subject by way of discipline

## Foucault, Discipline & Punish  {#slide-3}

- Discipline & Punish  underscores the inextricable link between power and knowledge ("power-knowledge") 

<!-- -->

- Power is constituted through accepted forms of knowledge, scientific understanding and "truth"
- Norms are imposed and institutionalized, and effectively become part of our "common sense"

<!-- -->

- What we know and believe to be true is actually a product of the social order in which we live
- Modern mass punishment & criminal law are a tool for the preservation of this social order ( Clarissa ,  Wyatt )

## Why Punish? (Bentham) {#slide-4}

- Utilitarianism: Punishment is justified because it can be used to achieve something  

<!-- -->

- Deterrence  (of the offender and others)

<!-- -->

- general deterrence -- punishment deters other members of community
- specific deterrence -- punishment deters defendant's future misconduct

<!-- -->

-   Incapacitation  of the offender

<!-- -->

- prevent defendant from committing crime (but can't predict accurately whether individuals will reoffend)

<!-- -->

- Rehabilitation  of the offender

<!-- -->

- requires accepting that punishment alters / can alter defendant's behavior

Bentham 

- "The general object which all laws have, or ought to have, in common, is to augment the total happiness of the community."
- "All punishment is mischief;  all punishment in itself is evil . Upon the principle of utility, if it ought at all to be admitted, it ought only to be admitted in as far as it promises to exclude some greater evil." (97)

<!-- -->

- Punishment = evil // must be justified by social welfare calculus

 

## Why Punish? (Kant) {#slide-5}

- Kant represents the classic view of  retribution : crime & punishment are incredibly linked 

<!-- -->

- In other words, punishment is the natural consequence of the commission of a wrong (crime)

<!-- -->

- Crimes are universal, not culturally determined, because of the  categorical imperative . 

<!-- -->

- Cf. Foucault

Lex talionis  (i.e., an eye for an eye)

- Kant "asserts that the hurt done to the criminal should  equal  the hurt the criminal did to others, both in amount and in kind"

Rejects utilitarianism

- Utilitarianism treats criminals as a mere means to another's good (contrary to Categorical Imperative)
-   Utilitarianism could theoretically justify the punishment of an innocent person because of the good it might bring to society. To Kant, this sort of injustice is intolerable.

 

##     Harcourt, Post-Modern Meditations on Punishment {#slide-6}

-  Bernard Harcourt, "Post-Modern Meditations on Punishment"
- Punishment is not "rational" but is culturally determined and biased. 
- Even the empirical studies on which the carceral state relies import biases and social/cultural assumptions
- Although we profess to be following science/reason, we are taking leaps of faith. These are not rational solutions
- Solution: Randomization of sentencing

<!-- -->

- " Where our social scientific theories run out, where our principles run dry, we should leave the decision making to chance. We should no longer take that leap of faith, but turn instead to... randomization and chance."
- "Judges could impose sentences, following conviction, based on a draw from within a legislatively prescribed sentencing range; the range could easily be determined, for instance, by felony classifications."

The Function of Criminal Law

State v. Clarissa  (Ala., 1847) 

- Facts:  Clarissa was accused of poisoning enslaver by putting Jamestown weed in coffee she made. Clarissa's enslaver whipped her severely, inducing her confession. Later, she confesses again when she has been moved from the home to the fields and is asked where she wanted to work and then why she poisoned him. 

<!-- -->

- On appeal, the issue is the propriety of the indictment. 

<!-- -->

- Challenge of the indictment  -- it is defective because Jamestown weed had not been previously established to be a poison. 

- Holding:  A confession made by a slave as result of torture/coercion is not admissible evidence. 

<!-- -->

- Court ends the decision   noting that " the humane policy of our law  would excuse such evidence coming from a white person, and the evidence is much stronger in the case of a slave."
- Lower judgment reversed.

The Function of Criminal Law

Wyatt v. The State  (Ala., 1854) 

- Facts:  Wyatt ran away from enslaver. That night, gin house burned down. Wyatt was captured and left overnight tied up. In the morning, the master showed up and found he had cut himself trying to escape. The master told him: "Boy, these denials only make the matter worse" and Wyatt responded that he burnt the gin house. Wyatt then confessed to a justice of the peace, with enslaver present. He was sentenced to death; case appealed. 
- Holding:  The confession to the enslaver and the justice must be excluded under the rule of  Clarissa . The second confession is inadmissible because even though it was before a magistrate, it was tainted by the fact that the enslaver was present, assuming his guilt and demanding he confess.

\*\*\*

Takeaways from both cases:

- The courts in Clarissa and Wyatt reversed the convictions of two enslaved persons, which may seem contemporaneously "progressive." But these cases helped to perpetuate an unjust hierarchy & inhumane system of slavery.

The Function of Criminal Law

Michel Foucault,  Wrong-Doing, Truth-Telling: The Function of Avowal in Justice

Homeric story on games of Achilles: 

- Setting:  Chariot race involving  Diomedes, Eumelus, Menelaus, Antilochus, Meriones (natural order)
- Problem:  Antilochus refuses to cede a narrow passage to Menelaus, resulting in Antilochus beating him. 

<!-- -->

- In other words, Antilochus fails to respect the social order 

<!-- -->

- As a result, Menelaus proposes a trial, but then changes his mind and challenges Antilochus to swear to Zeus (powerful god) that he is better than Menelaus. Antilochus caves, avowing that his youth got the better of his wisdom (i.e., "I was wrong to challenge the social order"). 
- By beating Menelaus in the race, Antilochus upset the social order. Through his avowal, he voluntarily re-establishes it.

  Some broad takeaways:

- Foucault emphasizes that the order of "truth" -- the social hierarchy -- is not simply imposed on Antilochus by means of a traditional conception of power, namely of someone "more" powerful imposing a regime on another who would be "subject" to that power. 

<!-- -->

- Rather Antilochus implicates himself in the production and legitimation of the social order through a seemingly voluntary quasi-avowal

<!-- -->

- Put broadly: individuals, through their own voluntary acts, reinforce the social order
- Even today, forms of avowal are seen as constituting "justice" (and simultaneously reconstituting the subject)

The Function of Criminal Law

Robert Cover,  Prelude: Of Creon & Captain Vere

- Describes the (fictional) actions of Creon ( Antigone ) and Captain Vere ( Billy Budd ) 

<!-- -->

- Both characters privilege positivist/formal legal order over what may be morally right

<!-- -->

- Captain Vere: "however pitilessly that law may operate in any instances, we nevertheless adhere to it and administer it" 

<!-- -->

- Book discusses abolitionist judges' upholding of the Fugitive Slave Act

<!-- -->

- Acting "out of impersonal duty," they played a "legitimating role in determining what the law \[would\] become"

<!-- -->

- Takeaways

<!-- -->

- The law is not value-neutral or rational; it is tool for the establishment of a hierarchical social order
- We must be attentive to the "phenomenon of complicity in oppressive legal systems"
- We must inquire into the internal forces that produce an almost uniform response of role fidelity
