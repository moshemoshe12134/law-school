## Criminal Law                Session 6 {#slide-1}

## Capital Punishment: Background {#slide-2}

After guilt has been decided, how do courts / juries decide who gets the death penalty?

Antebellum period

- Comes from England
- Automatic death penalty for most murders; not much jury discretion EXCEPT jury nullification

Mid-19th Century -- 1960s

- Complete jury discretion -- "matter solely and wholly within your discretion;" "it is entirely up to you folks"
- Constitutional challenges: i) McGautha v. California (1971) asked due process violation? Court said no. ii) Furman v. Georgia (1972) asked eighth amendment violation? Court said yes, but unclear at first. 1. Key reasoning: random, arbitrary, "wanton and freakish" application of death penalty.

3. Guided discretion (post-Gregg)

- Statutes upheld

Pyramid statutes (Gregg v. Georgia)

Weighing statutes (Alabama; Florida)

Special questions statutes (Texas)

i. Mandatory death statutes (North Carolina)

## Capital Punishment: Process {#slide-3}

Process  today ○ Bifurcated proceeding: guilt and penalty

- In guilt phase, jury decides whether defendant is guilty of capital murder
- Penalty phase can be determined by judge or jury or both (different in different states)

● Until very recently, judge could override jury's mercy (judicial override)

○  Individualized sentencing consideration: defendant can raise ANYTHING they think is mitigating (Lockett)

○  Appellate review (sometimes automatic)

○  Collateral review / post conviction review: requires evidence from outside the record to prove

■  Federal habeas corpus =  an independent review of constitutional claims previously litigated in state court by a federal court. Has already been convicted and sentenced to death, went through appeals based on the record, brought IAC claims,  Brady  claims

## Current Doctrine: Guided Discretion {#slide-4}

Gregg v. Georgia  (1976) 

●  Takeaway #1:  death penalty does  not  per se  constitute "cruel and unusual punishment" in violation of 8th and  14th Amendments 

○ Standard 

■ Not rejected by  evolving standards of decency  ( Trop v. Dulles ) 

■ History and precedent (accepted by framers) serve purposes of deterrence and retribution

■ Public support 

■ NO Excessiveness = unnecessary / wanton infliction of pain  AND  grossly out of proportion to the severity of the crime 

○  "We might not act as judges as we might as legislators"  -- assumes validity of death penalty because it was selected by a democratically elected legislature 

○  Relative infrequency doesn't indicate rejection, just that it's reserved for "extreme cases" 

○ Is not so without penological justification that it results in the gratuitous infliction of suffering 

■ Retribution is essential to an ordered society (prevents "self help") 

■ Leave deterrent value for legislature to consider 

○ Not disproportionate (eye for an eye) 

          ● Takeaway #2:  Address previous problems with juries ("arbitrary and capricious" administration) by guiding jury discretion 

          ● Marshall dissent: reminds us of dignity of wrongdoer; the purported justifications for the death penalty are insufficient

## Permissible Statutes {#slide-5}

●   Pyramid statutes  

○ An aggravating factor raises the killing to first degree murder; then only those where the jury finds   aggravating circumstance  can be death eligible; then left to judicial discretion 

■  Gradual narrowing of death eligible defendants

●  Weighing statutes  

○ There has to be an enumerated aggravating circumstance found by jury to put someone to death 

○  Mitigating  circumstances  must  be considered 

○  Not  tallying mitigating and aggravating - must weigh the circumstances in individuality 

●  Special questions statutes  

○ If you answer three questions in a certain way, you HAVE to sentence person to death 

■  Penry  added a question that gave more flexibility re intellectual disability 

● Note: though aggravating circumstances are limited to those in the statute, mitigating circumstances  cannot be so limited ( Lockett v. Ohio ) 

● Guided discretion allowed; mandatory sentencing not allowed 

○ TENSION / dialectic: we want consistency but individualized sentencing 

■  How to reconcile categories with individualization?  Gregg  compared to  Atkins / Roper 

■  Middleground of narrowing / channeling juror's discretion so there are patterns 

■  Scalia / Thomas: individualized sentencing is not required by constitution  

■  Blackmun: because of fundamental inconsistency, just abolish the death penalty -- you can't have a  fair, constitutional imposition of the death penalty → "no longer tinker with the machinery of death" 

## Modern Jurisprudence {#slide-6}

Atkins v. Virginia (2002)

●  Takeaway: violates 8th Amendment to sentence mentally disabled people to death 

○ Example of categorical decision, also seen in  Roper 

● Facts: during penalty phase, expert testified that Atkins was severely mentally disabled  

● Issue: does imposing the death penalty on people with mental disabilities violate the 8th  Amendment? 

● Holding: yes, violates 8th Amendment -- excessive and disproportionate 

          ○ Note: 8th Amendment is incorporated against the states by the 14th Amendment  

● Reasoning: evolving standards of decency + "our own judgment will be brought to bear" 

○ General movement away from doing this among the states and other countries +  popular opinion + medical experts are opposed to this = evolving standard of moral  decency is moving away from executing people with mental disability 

○ Diminished purposes of punishment because less morally culpable 

○ Independent evaluation: agree that death is not a suitable punishment in this case 

## Principles after the 1970s {#slide-7}

- " Evolving standards of decency": reflect our moral values  (Atkins/Gregg)
- Guide the jury 
- Consistency: narrow class of murderers 
- Individual dignity: individualized sentencing 
- Woodson: no mandatory death sentences 

<!-- -->

- Woodson, an accomplice in a robbery/murder, had been convicted of first-degree murder. Under North Carolina law, he received a mandatory death sentence. Following  Furman  v.  Georgia  (1972), North Carolina had replaced its discretionary sentencing system with a mandatory death sentence for first-degree murder. This case, decided on the same day as  Gregg  v.  Georgia  (1976), reversed the lower court\'s approval of mandatory sentencing on Eighth Amendment grounds.

## Capital Punishment in the MPC {#slide-8}

MPC 210.6

- (1) Circumstances that exclude imposition of the death penalty
- (2) Procedural requirements for a death sentence, namely a separate proceeding
- (3) Aggravating circumstances

<!-- -->

- Committed by convict under sentence of imprisonment
- Previously convicted of another murder
- Committed another murder at the same time
- Knowingly created a great risk of death to many persons
- Committed while engaging in a violent felony
- Committed for the purpose of avoiding or preventing a lawful arrest or effecting an escape from lawful custody
- Committed for pecuniary gain
- Especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel, manifesting exceptional depravity

## Capital Punishment in the MPC Cont. {#slide-9}

MPC 210.6

- (4) Mitigating circumstances

<!-- -->

- No significant history of prior criminal activity
- Committed while Dwas under influence of extreme emotional disturbance
- Victim was participant in D's homicidal conduct or consented to homicidal act
- Committed under circumstances D believed provided moral justification or extenuation for conduct
- Accomplice in a murder committed by another person and his participation was relatively minor
- Acted under duress or under the domination of another person
- At time of murder, capacity of D to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to requirements of law was impaired by mental disease or intoxication
- Youth of the defendant at time of murder

## Steiker and Steiker,  "Sober Second Thoughts'' {#slide-10}

- A critique of the Court's treatment of the death penalty

<!-- -->

- As we have moved further from Furman, we haven't taken seriously the calls the Court made for state legislatures to impose objective standard by which we are deciding whether people should be put to death.

<!-- -->

- There should be more guidelines for the death penalty. Processes in states are still not sufficient.

<!-- -->

- Gregg court invoked need for "heightened reliability" in death penalty cases, but the reality is that the procedural protections in death penalty cases are not that robust

<!-- -->

- Numerous contexts in which death penalty cases receive no additional safeguards such as inadequate representation

<!-- -->

- Perceptions of death penalty jurisprudence

<!-- -->

- Some critics claim that the Court\'s work has burdened the administration of capital punishment with an overly complex, absurdly arcane, and minutely detailed body of constitutional law that obstructs, delays, and defeats the administration of capital punishment
- Some claim that SCOTUS has turned its back on regulating the death penalty and no longer even attempts to meet the concerns about the arbitrary and discriminatory imposition of death that animated its \"constitutionalization\" of capital punishment in Furman
- Both sets of criticisms of the Court\'s work are substantially correct:

<!-- -->

- The death penalty is, perversely, both over- and under-regulated. 
- The body of doctrine produced by the Court is enormously complex and its applicability to specific cases difficult to discern; yet, it remains unresponsive to the central animating concerns that inspired the Court to embark on its regulatory regime in the first place.

## Steiker and Steiker,  "Sober Second Thoughts'' {#slide-11}

- Legitimation theory - normative legitimation - to show or affirm to be justified: 3 basic levels:

<!-- -->

- Internal legitimation - the extent to which legal discourse and doctrine affect the way actors within the legal system perceive the system and their role within it
- Particular external legitimation - extent to which legal discourse and doctrine affect the way people in general view a specific social practice
- General external legitimation - extent to which legal discourse and doctrine affect the way people in general view the social structure writ large.

<!-- -->

- Our takeaway: CP reforms haven't accomplished much beyond more-or-less tricking the public and even practitioners within the law to believe CP is a seriously regulated, and therefore legitimate, practice.

## McCleskey v. Kemp {#slide-12}

Facts:   McCleskey, a Black man, was convicted of aggravated murder  wi th aggravating circumstances & was sentenced to death. 

- Baldus study \[disparate impact evidence\]: "purports to show a disparity in the imposition of the death sentence in Georgia based on the race of the murder victim and, to a lesser extent, the race of the defendant" especially in intermediate cases where there is room for jury discretion, such as this case. 

Issue:   Was the law of Georgia properly applied and was the application in violation of the 14 th  and 8 th  amendments?

Holding/Reasoning:   Yes, it was properly applied and there is no violation of the 14 th  and 8 th  amendments.

- 14th Amendment: To prevail under the Equal Protection Clause, the defendant must prove the decision-makers in his case acted with discriminatory purpose. McCluskey failed to do so.

<!-- -->

- McCleskey would have to prove that Georgia legislature enacted or maintained the death penalty  because of  an anticipated racially discriminatory effect → no evidence to show they enacted this statute to further a racially discriminatory purpose

<!-- -->

- Equal protection has an intent requirement: "a defendant who alleges an equal protection violation has the burden of proving "the existence of purposeful discrimination." But McCleskey showed no evidence specific to his own case, or any evidence that GA legislature had discriminatory intent.  

## McCleskey v. Kemp {#slide-13}

- 8th  amendment challenge: Court says the Baldus study does not demonstrate a  con stitutionally significant risk of racial bias   affecting the Georgia capital sentencing process.
- Yes, there is some risk of racial prejudice influencing a jury, but discretion is really important and the risk \[that a killer of white victim is 4.4x as likely to get death penalty compared to killer of black victim\] isn't "constitutionally significant."

<!-- -->

- Institutional competency argument: McCleskey's arguments are for the legislature -   not Court's responsibility or right to determine the appropriate punishment for particular crimes
- Slippery slope argument: Court says if they accept McCleskey's disparate impact argument, that would apply to the whole justice system w/ regard to all kinds of bias

<!-- -->

- Harcourt: isn't that the point? It  should  apply to the whole justice system

<!-- -->

- Brennan dissent:  Majority is afraid of "too much justice"

## Race and the Death Penalty {#slide-14}

- How might we find ways around the constitutional holding in McCleskey in order to properly address racial discrimination in the criminal legal ordeal?

<!-- -->

- Possible ideas: 

<!-- -->

- State/federal statute that allows defendant to use disparate impact evidence to challenge prosecution/sentencing (e.g., Kentucky Racial Justice Act)
- Court could allow Ds to make burden-shifting prima facie case of discrimination based on disparate impact (McCleskey, Blackmun dissenting)
- Maybe courts could broaden intent to discriminate from acts (designing policy to have disparate impact) to include omissions (not taking steps to ensure policy does not have disparate impact)
- Maybe court could hold that under evolving standards of human decency, what was not a constitutionally-significant disparate impact in 1987 is in 2025

## Race and the Death Penalty {#slide-15}

More suggestions for improvement post-McCleskey 

(1) how could we have rewritten McCleskey?

- Instead of requiring proof of actual intent, look at the big picture / totality (Baldus study,  historical background \[Black codes\], etc.) 

(2) abolition 

(3) rethink intent  

- Charles Lawrence - implicit intent because of unconscious racism 

(4) litigate race under McCleskey to find the smoking guns

- At the local level: NAACP LDF, southern center for human rights 

(5 ) on Black representation 

-  Expand the 6th Amendment right to counsel of choice to indigent defendants to specifically  benefit Black  defendants 
- "Empowering indigent Black people to select, should they desire, Black and/or culturally competent public defenders has the potential to offer a range of benefits,  including mitigating anti-Black racism in the criminal legal system"
