## Criminal Law                Session 10 {#slide-1}

## Regina v. Dudley & Stephens  {#slide-2}

Facts:  3 men and their cabin boy were stranded \[Dudley (sailing master), Stephens (lots of sailing experience), Brooks, Parker (cabin boy who fell ill)\]. Brooks did not consent to drawing lots or to killing Parker, but the Dudley & Stephens proceeded to kill Parker nonetheless. All three fed on him. 3 days later, the men were saved.

Charge:  Dudley and Stephens charged with murder of Parker

- Third man, Brooks, was prosecution witness

Reasoning:  There is a doctrine of self defense (pg. 91), but that doesn't apply here (no necessity defense in England at this time (pg. 92)). 

- "there was in this case no such excuse, unless the killing was justified by what has been called "necessity." But the temptation to the act which existed here was not what the law has ever called necessity"
- Immoral -- we should follow example of Christ and be willing to sacrifice ourselves for other people

Holding : death sentence (oh the irony)

○ Note: sentences later commuted, and defendants not executed

## Regina v. Dudley & Stephens (cont.) {#slide-3}

Discussion: 

Other non-Christian ways to resolve this case? Alternatively,  w ould it have been "better" or "more Christian" to draw lots and randomize or for captain to sacrifice himself? 

- Choice of lesser evils:  utilitarianism

<!-- -->

- Parker was a less experienced sailor, wouldn't be able to help them get to safety
- Parker doesn't have family, so less of a loss
- Parker has more life ahead of him

Any deterrence value from sentencing the defendants to death here?

- It is unlikely that people in this circumstance in the future would, under threat of starvation, be deterred because of threat of later potentially being sentenced to death

## People v. Unger {#slide-4}

Facts : Unger escaped prison, was charged with escape.

- Unger's defense: he was being threatened and sexually assaulted by other incarcerated people so he needed to escape to save his life
- Jury was instructed not to consider reasons for alleged escape as justification or excuse

Issue : was it error for jury to be instructed it must disregard Unger's reasons for escape?

- Legal standard for necessity in Illinois (IL Ch. 38): the accused was without blame in occasioning or developing the situation and reasonably believed such conduct was necessary to avoid a public or private injury greater than the injury which might reasonably result from their own conduct

<!-- -->

- This sounds in lesser of two evils: "injury greater than the injury that might reasonably result from his own conduct"
- This also sounds in necessity: "reasonably believed such conduct was necessary to prevent"

## People v. Unger {#slide-5}

Lovercamp standard: entitled to necessity jury instruction if the following are met

 Prisoner is faced with specific threat of death, forcible sexual attack or substantial bodily injury in the immediate future

No time for complaint or history to the authorities or there exists a history of futile complaints

No time or opportunity to resort to the courts

No evidence of force or violence used towards prison personnel or other "innocent" persons in the escape AND

Immediately alerts proper authorities when they have attained a position of safety from the immediate threat

- Note: Unger didn't do this -- never informed authorities

Holding : not adopting Lovercamp - relevant but not required; affirm remand for new trial where jury is allowed to consider Unger's reasons for escape

Dissent : unless narrowly circumscribed, this defense will lead to future escapes and lead to injury to police, etc.

 

## U.S. v. Schoon {#slide-6}

Facts:  Protestors occupied IRS building to protest US involvement in El Salvador, obstructing the office's operation.

Reasoning:  Court distinguishes between direct and indirect civil disobedience 

- "Petitioning Congress to change a policy is always a legal alternative in such cases, regardless of the likelihood of the plea's success" so committing a crime isn't necessary

<!-- -->

- Direct : "involves protesting the existence of a law by breaking that law or by preventing the execution of that law in a specific instance in which a particularized harm would otherwise follow."
- Indirect : "involves violating a law or interfering with a government policy that is not, itself, the object of protest."

<!-- -->

- "To invoke the necessity defense, therefore, the defendants colorably must have shown that: 1) they were faced with a choice of evils and chose the lesser evil;  2) they acted to prevent imminent harm \[contra MPC, Unger\]; 3) they reasonably anticipated a direct causal relationship between their conduct and the harm to be averted; and 4) they had no legal alternatives to violating the law." 

Holding:  Necessity is per se inapplicable to cases of indirect civil disobedience because: (1) existence of law or policy is not a legally cognizable harm; because the act is indirect, it is unlikely to abate the evil; and (3) there are legal alternatives available (e.g., petition Cong.)

## State v. Toscano {#slide-7}

Facts:  Toscano participated in a scheme to defraud insurance companies by providing false medical reports. He "maintained he agreed to take part because ringleader threatened him and his wife with physical harm otherwise.

Holding:  "Henceforth, duress shall be a defense to a crime other than murder if the defendant engaged in conduct because he was  coerced  to do so by the use of, or threat to use,  unlawful force against his person or the person of another , which a person of  reasonable firmness in his situation  would have been unable to resist."

- The defendant was entitled to a defense of duress since the requisite elements of the defense \[as synthesized by the court\] were established.

Takeaway : Duress is an  objective standard  -- a situation inducing fear such that a man of ordinary fortitude & courage would yield

## US v. Fleming {#slide-8}

Facts:  Defendant was POW charged w/ helping North Korea produce propaganda. Δ refused to aid captors, but they threatened to force him to march barefoot in midwinter 200 miles or to stick him in a cave. Either threat was tantamount to death.

Issue:  Does duress require fear of  immediate  death?

Reasoning:  Fleming's resistance had not brought him to the  last ditch ; the danger of death or serious bodily harm was not  immediate .

Holding:  Court upheld conviction--- defendant cooperated with his captors upon the mere assertion of the threats... It was not at all certain at the time the threat was made that walking north would cause death at all, much less immediately... Here the  danger of death was problematical and remote ."

## Law & Economics {#slide-9}

Richard A. Posner, "An Economic Theory of the Criminal Law"

Major function of criminal law in a capitalist society is to prevent people from bypassing the system of voluntary, compensated exchange (the "market"). Market bypassing in such situations is inefficient (in terms of wealth maximization).

Much of this market bypassing cannot be deterred by tort law (privately enforced damage suits). The optimal damages that would be required for deterrence would so frequently exceed the offender\'s ability to pay that public enforcement and nonmonetary sanctions such as imprisonment are required. 

Such sanctions are extremely costly for a variety of reasons, and this, together with the socially worthless character of most of the sanctioned conduct, has a number of implications for efficient criminal law doctrine, such as that unsuccessful attempts should be punished in order to economize on costlier punishments for completed crimes. 

- Thus, the main differences between substantive criminal law and substantive tort law can be derived from the differences in (1) the social costs of criminal and tort sanctions and (2) the social benefits of the underlying conduct regulated by these two bodies of law. 
- Most of the distinctive doctrines of the criminal law can be explained as if the objective of that law were to promote economic efficiency.

## Law & Economics (cont.) {#slide-10}

Gary Becker, "Crime and Punishment: An Economic Approach"

- Formulates a measure of "social loss" from offenses and finds those expenditures of resources and punishments that minimize this loss. The general criterion of social loss is shown to incorporate as special cases, valid under special assumptions, the criteria of vengeance, deterrence, compensation, and rehabilitation that historically have figured so prominently in practice and criminological literature.
- The optimal amount of enforcement is shown to depend on,  inter alia , the cost of catching and convicting offenders, the nature of punishments (i.e. whether they are fines or prison terms -- and the responses of offenders to changes in enforcement)

  General takeaways

- L&E attempts to ground criminal punishment policy in "scientific"/"objective" efficiency & utility-based justifications, and is predicated on the seeming belief that economic modeling/rational choice theory can be applied universally
- L&E seeks to model legal rules so as to maximize efficiency and social welfare 
- L&E framework is inaccurate & in any case impracticable (we're in law school because we're bad at math)

## M'Naghten Rule {#slide-11}

- First legal test for criminal insanity

- Cognition:  "that every man is to be presumed to be sane, and \... that to establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was  labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to  know  the  nature and quality of the   act  he was doing; OR if he did know it, that he did not  know  he was doing what was  wrong ."

<!-- -->

- In other words: defendant presumed sane unless proven otherwise
- High standard because there is no volition prong, only cognition prong. MPC is friendlier to defs.

- Burden of proof for defendant:

<!-- -->

- (1) at the time of the act defendant was laboring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act they were doing OR
- (2) if they did know the nature and quality of the act, that they didn't know it was wrong

## M'Naghten Rule (cont.) {#slide-12}

Responses:

- M'Naghten rule was too focused on cognition (knowing) and not on whether they could control themselves. Even if a defendant knew what they were doing was wrong, maybe they couldn't help it. (too narrow)
- Irresistible Impulse: if the defendant is unable to adhere to doing the right thing as a result of irresistible impulse

<!-- -->

- an inability to adhere does not exist unless the act is committed under an irresistible impulse which completely deprives the defendant of the power of choice or volition (high bar)

<!-- -->

- Durham  Test: the defendant's conduct was the product of mental disease or mental defect
- Davis  Test: person incapable of distinction between right and wrong, or unconscious at the time of the act, or though conscious and able to distinguish between right and wrong his will has been otherwise than voluntarily so completely destroyed that his actions are not subject to it but are beyond his control

## MPC 4.01 {#slide-13}

MPC 4.01

-  (1)  A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct as a result of mental disease or defect he lacks  substantial capacit y either to appreciate the criminality/wrongfulness of his conduct  or  to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.  // conform conduct:  volitional   prong. Lacks substantial capacity:  cognition  prong.

<!-- -->

- Considers both understanding and willfulness/control
- Does criminality mean moral wrongness or criminal wrongness? States differ
- Burden of proof: most states put the burden on defendant (preponderance of the evidence)

<!-- -->

- Criticism of MPC approach after Hinckley; many jurisdictions went back to M'Naghten
- Federal Insanity Defense Reform Act of 1984 - M'Naghten type focused on cognition

<!-- -->

- It is an affirmative defense to a prosecution under any Federal statute that, at the time of the commission of the acts constituting the offense, the defendant, as a result of a severe mental disease or defect, was unable to appreciate the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of his acts. Mental disease or defect does not otherwise constitute a defense.

● 22 states still have MPC definition

NYPL 40.15

- In any prosecution for an offense, it is an affirmative defense that when the defendant engaged in the proscribed conduct, he lacked criminal responsibility by reason of mental disease or defect. Such lack of criminal responsibility means that at the time of such conduct, as a result of mental disease or defect, he lacked substantial capacity to know or appreciate either: 1. The nature and consequences of such conduct; or 2. That such conduct was wrong.

## MPC 4.01 cont. {#slide-14}

- MPC is nicer to ∆ than M'Naghten  bc you could know what you're doing is wrong but say you couldn't help yourself. 

<!-- -->

- Expands the kinds of psychological impairments that can excuse D, including volitional and cognitive disabilities
- Does NOT require total impairment, standard is  "lacks substantial capacity"  → may require factfinder to make a value judgment about meaning of "substantial" 
- Expands scope of relevant testimony by mental health professionals 
- "Appreciate" rather than "know" suggests that D's must have deeper understanding of the wrongfulness; broader than simple cognition // you can know but not appreciate gravity of it aka not emotionally appreciate 

## Blake v. U.S. {#slide-15}

Facts : Blake was convicted of bank robbery. He presented evidence showing that he required psychiatric treatment for at least 20 years. Expert testimony said he was had severe schizophrenia, which often manifested in psychotic episodes.

Issue:  whether the jury instruction should have used the MPC standard or Davis?

Reasoning:  Court considers Davis standard (see previous slide) (under which defendant could not prevail) & MPC (under which he might)

Holding : A substantial lack of capacity standard (to appreciate wrongfulness or conform to law) is called for in light of current knowledge regarding mental illness. (MPC Standard) 

Note : Overruled by  Lyons 

## U.S. v. Lyons {#slide-16}

Facts:  Defendant was indicted for drug possession. "He also offered to present expert witnesses who would testify that his drug addiction affected his brain both physiologically and psychologically and that as a result he lacked  substantial capacity  to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law."

Holding:  "Reexamining the  Blake  standard today, we conclude that the  volitional prong  of the insanity defense --  a lack of capacity to conform one\'s conduct to the requirements of the law  -- does not comport with current medical and scientific knowledge, which has retreated from its earlier, sanguine expectations. Consequently, we now hold that a person is not responsible for criminal conduct on the grounds of insanity only if at the time of that conduct, as a result of a mental disease or defect, he is unable to appreciate the wrongfulness of that conduct."

Dissent:  An adjudication of guilt is a judgement of  moral blameworthiness . Even if science cannot determine the issue of capacity to conform conduct, courts must nonetheless try in order to avoid imposing liability on a defendant who is not morally responsible.

Takeaways : Overturned  Blake;  general shift away from the MPC approach

 

## Kahler v. Kansas {#slide-17}

Facts:  Defendant was charged with murdering 4 members of his family. The defense argued insanity. Evidence & expert testimony on both sides corroborated the insanity defense. The jury convicted and recommended death.

Statute : Under KS law, a jury can only consider mental disease or defect as a defense insofar as it shows that the defendant lacked the  mens rea  required as an element to the crime ( M'Naghten  abrogated).

Holding : Due process doesn't require states adopt an insanity defense that turns on a defendant's ability to recognize the moral wrongfulness of the criminal conduct.

Takeaway : SCOTUS won't adopt one version of the insanity defense over others; the states can choose.

 

##  The Crystalline Structure of Legal Thought (Recap) {#slide-18}

-   Jack M. Balkin suggests that  legal thought can be compared to a crystalline structure . The idea is to understand law as a dynamic system of rules, principles, and concepts that evolve and adapt over time. Just as a crystal can take on various forms while maintaining its underlying structure, legal thought can adapt to changing social and cultural contexts while retaining its fundamental principles.
- Balkin\'s crystalline structure metaphor emphasizes the flexibility and adaptability of legal systems. It suggests that legal concepts can undergo transformation and reinterpretation without losing their coherence. This perspective allows for an understanding of how legal ideas interact with and respond to societal changes, technological advancements, and cultural shifts.  

![](ppt/media/image2.jpg "Google Shape;202;p42")

Balkan uses these diagrams, termed "dyads" to demonstrate that many, if not most, of the issues brought before courts and legislatures may be understood in terms of dyadic rule choices that could be similarly diagrammed.
