The Exam

- 3 hours; open book; 2 questions; 2,500 words
- Fact-pattern (50%): analyzing the best arguments for each side and producing a just result under law

<!-- -->

- What charges would you file against whom and why?
- What defenses or issues would you raise on behalf of the individuals charged and why?
- Who would likely have the better of the argument---the prosecution or the defense---and why? 
- Law that governs → Might be MPC/amended MPC/new statute  

<!-- -->

- Policy question (50%): arguing for a change in law or legal theory that would produce more just results 

<!-- -->

- How would you critique (or support) a legal/critical theory?
- How does a particular theory apply to a given context?
- Should a specific statute/provision be revised?
- How would you have decided a specific case (or cases) differently?

<!-- -->

- See  past exams, sample answers, and some memoranda on Courseworks   

## Slide 3

![](ppt/media/image5.png "Google Shape;159;p39")

Advice on Preparing for Class (Cases)

- Identify the statute in each case -- note it just as you would note the holding, issue, etc. in other classes.
- Break the statute into  actus reus ,  mens rea , attendant circumstances, etc.
- Which facts does the decision turn on? What would change the holding?
- Do you agree with the holding?
- How does the case define key concepts? (i.e., common law mens reas)
- Pay close attention to where the MPC departs from what the states do in the cases
- Pay attention to the discussions in class regarding the elements of the crimes, the arguments for the prosecution and defense, and the nuances of the MPC/statutes in the cases

## Slide 4

![](ppt/media/image5.png "Google Shape;167;p40")

Advice on Preparing for Class (Theory)

- Take a step back from black-letter law and put on your critical thinking caps!
- Consider how theory, however abstract, can apply to our criminal justice system and the social arrangements or structures of power on which this system depends. 
- Look at the reading's placement in the syllabus and ask yourself why it was assigned at a particular time. 
- Think about theoretical readings' relationship to one another. 

<!-- -->

- You'll likely want to invoke numerous readings in your policy essay.
- What are the key takeaways from each?
- Which theories/positions are alike? Which ones conflict?

The Function of Criminal Law

Michel Foucault,  Discipline & Punish

 

![](ppt/media/image8.png "Google Shape;179;p41")

![](ppt/media/image1.png "Google Shape;181;p41")

Story in three parts:

- Ancien regime : period of brutal punishments in which sovereign power marks the body (torture & mutilation as a public spectacle)
- 18 th  century : softer punishment 
- 19th century:  movement towards modern punishment/carceral system

<!-- -->

- Disappearance of spectacle
- Elimination of physical pain (punishment of the  soul )

Some takeaways:

- Discipline & Punish  underscores the inextricable link between power and knowledge ("power-knowledge") 

<!-- -->

- Power is constituted through accepted forms of knowledge, scientific understanding and "truth"
- Norms are imposed and institutionalized, and effectively become part of our "common sense"

<!-- -->

- What we know and believe to be true is actually a product of the social order in which we live
- Modern mass punishment & criminal law are a tool for the preservation of this social order

## Slide 8

![](ppt/media/image5.png "Google Shape;205;p44")

Elements of Criminal Law 

Common Law Requirements: Actus Reus

- The act requirement, or  actus reus , stands for the proposition that just punishment necessitates that punishment be for past, voluntary, wrongful, or potentially harmful conduct that is specified and advanced by statute. 

- For criminal liability to attach, there must be a voluntary act or an omission.  And criminal conduct must be voluntary (often called the volition requirement).

- What is not voluntary behavior? Reflexes, convulsion, bodily movements during unconsciousness or sleep. 

## Slide 9

![](ppt/media/image5.png "Google Shape;213;p45")

Elements of Criminal Law 

Model Penal Code: Actus Reus

 MPC § 1.13

- In this Code, unless a different meaning plainly is required: 
- (2) "act" or "action" means a bodily movement whether voluntary or involuntary;
- (9) "element of an offense" means 

<!-- -->

- (i) such conduct or 
- (ii) such attendant circumstances or 
- (iii) such a result of conduct as 

<!-- -->

- (a) is included in the description of the forbidden conduct in the definition of the offense; or
- (b) establishes the required kind of culpability; or
- (c) negatives an excuse or justification for such conduct; or
- (d) negatives a defense under the statute of limitations; or
- (e) establishes jurisdiction or venue;

## Slide 10

![](ppt/media/image5.png "Google Shape;221;p46")

Elements of Criminal Law 

Model Penal Code: Actus Reus

 MPC § 2.01

- (1) A person is not guilty of an offense unless his liability is based on conduct which includes a voluntary act or the omission to perform an act of which he is physically capable.

- (2) The following are not voluntary acts within the meaning of this Section: 

<!-- -->

- (a) a reflex or convulsion; 
- (b) a bodily movement during unconsciousness or sleep; 
- (c) conduct during hypnosis or resulting from hypnotic suggestion; 
- (d) a bodily movement that otherwise is not a product of the effort or determination of the actor, either conscious or habitual.

## Slide 11

![](ppt/media/image5.png "Google Shape;229;p47")

Elements of Criminal Law 

Martin v. State  (Ala. Ct. App. 1994) 

- Facts :  Police officers had arrested him at his house and brought him onto the highway, where he began yelling profanities, indicating a drunken condition. Defendant was convicted of being drunk on a public highway and appealed. 
- Statute :  "Any person who, while intoxicated or drunk, appears in any public place where one or more persons are present, . . . and manifests a drunken condition by boisterous or indecent conduct, or loud and profane discourse, shall, on conviction, be fined."

<!-- -->

- Holding :  Conviction under the statute overturned.
- Reasoning :  One cannot be convicted of public drunkenness if he was involuntarily brought to a public place by an arresting officer.

<!-- -->

- When does voluntariness have to start? Question of time framing.

<!-- -->

- Could argue if act that led to arrest was voluntary, getting arrested and being taken into public was defendant's fault→ broad time framing 

<!-- -->

- Should there be different results depending on what caused him to get arrested?

## Slide 12

![](ppt/media/image5.png "Google Shape;237;p48")

Elements of Criminal Law 

People v. Newton  (N.Y. 1956) 

- Facts :  Newton (Black Panthers co-founder) was pulled over by Officer Frey. In the ensuing struggle over a gun (whose gun is disputed), Frey was fatally shot, and Newton was shot in the abdomen and ended up in the hospital. Newton testified that he had carried no gun and that he had been unconscious between getting shot and ending up in the hospital.  

<!-- -->

- The defense's expert witness testified that a gunshot wound to the abdomen is very likely to produce a "profound reflex shock reaction... and it is not at all uncommon for a person shot in the abdomen to lose consciousness..."

<!-- -->

- Holding :  Reversed. The trial court committed reversible error when it failed to instruct the jury on the unconsciousness defense.
- Rule :  "Where not self-induced, as by voluntary intoxication or by the equivalent (of which there is no evidence here), unconsciousness is a complete defense to a charge of criminal homicide." (Cal. Pen. Code)

<!-- -->

- Does it matter who shot whom first? What if Newton wasn't shot at all?

## Slide 13

![](ppt/media/image5.png "Google Shape;245;p49")

Elements of Criminal Law 

People v. Decina  (Cal. Ct. App. 1970) 

- Facts :  Defendant was indicted for driving despite knowing that he was prone to epileptic attacks that caused him to lose consciousness. He lost consciousness while driving and killed four people. 
- Statute :  "A person who operates or drives any vehicle of any kind in a reckless or culpably negligent manner, whereby a human being is killed is guilty of criminal negligence in the operation of a vehicle resulting in death."

<!-- -->

- Actus reus: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
- Mens rea: reckless or culpably negligent

<!-- -->

- Holding :  This was criminal negligence within the meaning of the statute.

## Slide 14

![](ppt/media/image5.png "Google Shape;253;p50")

Elements of Criminal Law 

People v. Decina  (Cal. Ct. App. 1970) (cont.) 

- Reasoning :  The earlier voluntary act of getting into the car and driving it satisfies the "voluntary act" element of the crime. One may be criminally culpable for involuntary acts caused by a condition if the individual knows of the condition and disregards the possible consequences.

<!-- -->

- Is the court's analogy of epilepsy to drunk driving convincing? 
- Reconciling  Decina  and  Martin : What's the difference between saying Decina shouldn't have been driving and saying Martin shouldn't have been drinking?
- Would this qualify as a reflex or convulsion under MPC § 2.01(2)(a)?
- Is this even an actus reus case? The court talks about decision to drive with epilepsy and "knowledge" and "culpably negligent."

- Rule :  As long as there is one voluntary act in the defendant's course of conduct, he may be criminally responsible.

## Slide 15

![](ppt/media/image5.png "Google Shape;261;p51")

Kellman, Interpretive Construction in the Substantive Criminal Law

 

- Two interpretive questions

<!-- -->

- First question (time framing): Are we going to consider a broader history of the defendant?
- Next question (disjoined/unified accounts): Which pieces of the broader history do we connect to the crime?
- Whether broad or narrow, disjoined or unified, the choice is " arational ."
- Once the choice is made, "the question of criminal culpability is forever biased."

<!-- -->

- Broad and narrow views of intent

<!-- -->

- Tension between defendant's will/intent and what the intended conduct actually results in
- Example: What are we saying someone intended to do? Intending to pull trigger or intending to kill? 

<!-- -->

- Broad and narrow views of defendant

<!-- -->

- Looking at defendant broadly forces court to make societal judgments
- Reasonable Person: Looking at D's conduct/intent in that moment versus across time 
- Would a reasonable person in that moment act like that? Or would a reasonable person who has lived through property and had these experiences act like this?

## Slide 16

![](ppt/media/image5.png "Google Shape;269;p52")

Kellman, Interpretive Construction in the Substantive Criminal Law

 

- Narrow time framing

<!-- -->

- "Generally speaking, narrow time frames buttress the traditionally asserted intentionalism of the criminal justice system."
- Translation: Narrow time frames tend to make it easier to pin culpability by excluding all the potentially explanatory background data.

<!-- -->

- Broad time framing

<!-- -->

- "Broad time frame construction is most often used when deterministic discourse supplants the usual intentionalism."
- Translation: Broad time frames are usually used to undercut a defendant's culpability by incorporating potentially explanatory background data (duress, insanity, addiction) → certain blameworthy acts are blameless because rooted in or determined by factors that preceded the criminal incident

## Mens Rea in the Model Penal Code {#slide-17}

MPC § 2.02(1) ○ Criminal statutes must have a mens rea

●  MPC § 2.02(3) ○ Default mens rea is recklessness. ○ This is because (1) a prosecutor wouldn't go for the higher mens rea and make it unnecessarily harder for her case; and (2) a jury wouldn't need a higher mens rea to convict.

●  MPC § 2.02(4)

○ Unless there is a clearly contrary purpose, the mens rea that attaches to the actus reus attaches to the other elements of the crime (generalizability)

● MPC § 2.02(5) ○ Proving one mens rea also proves every mens rea "below" the proven level of culpability. ● MPC § 2.02(7)

○ Knowledge is satisfied when the person is aware of a high probability unless the person believes otherwise.

● MPC § 2.02(9) ○ Knowledge of the law that defines an offense is not an element of the offense, unless otherwise stated. Ignorance is no defense.

- 

## Mens Rea in the Model Penal Code Cont. {#slide-18}

![](ppt/media/image7.png "Google Shape;284;p54")

## Regina v. Cunningham {#slide-19}

   Takeaway: mens rea of malice/maliciousness requires at least recklessness

●  Facts: Cunningham tore a gas meter from the gas pipes and stole it. He did not turn off the gas, which caused a great volume of gas to escape and partially asphyxiate Mrs. Wade (his prospective mother-in-law) who lived next door.

●  Charged with "unlawfully and maliciously caus\[ing\] to be taken"

●  "Maliciously" is either (1) an intention to do particular harm or (2) recklessness of doing an action when harm is foreseeable. ○ Defendant is liable because he was reckless, though he didn't intend harm ○ Negligence is not enough to satisfy mens rea of malice

●  Holding: trial court erred in jury instructions by saying malice meant wickedness.

## Regina v. Faulkner {#slide-20}

Takeaway: maliciousness requires being intentional and wilful; can't transfer intent from lesser primary felony to the collateral felony

●  Issue: If, while a person is engaging in a felony, they accidentally do some collateral act -- that if done intentionally would be unlawful -- should they be found guilty?

●  If another felony occurs accidentally (burning down ship) during the course of your primary felony (stealing bottles of rum on a ship), court must engage in mens rea (malice) inquiry for each felony separately. Cannot convict D of collateral felony just for having sufficient mens rea for the first. No transferred intent or proximate cause even if one felony was a consequence of the other.

●  Holding: defendant can't be convicted for an act that is the unintended and unforeseeable consequence of a lesser offense. In order to maliciously set fire to the ship, defendant must have acted intentionally and wilfully.

## State v. Hazelwood {#slide-21}

●  Takeaway: sometimes civil negligence can be sufficient to satisfy mens rea of criminal negligence

○ Utilitarian approach: criminal penalties will only be imposed when conduct is something society can deter ■ Key to deciding what level of intent is the minimum for a particular offense when an expectation of individual conformity is reasonable

●  Facts: oil tanker captain ran his ship aground on a reef → 11 million gallons of oil spilled. Jury was instructed on an ordinary civil negligence standard (failure to perceive substantial risk) rather to impose criminal liability

●  Statute: offense for any person to "discharge, cause to be discharged, or permit the discharge of petroleum\...upon waters or land of the state" when done "negligently"

●  Holding: mens rea requirement in prosecution can be satisfied by an ordinary negligence standard which can be applied to the criminal statute, even though criminal negligence would have posed a higher burden for prosecution

## Santillanes v. New Mexico {#slide-22}

●   Takeaway: sometimes criminal negligence must be found to find a negligence mens rea ○ Retributivist approach: statute is meant to punish conduct that is morally culpable.

●  Facts / Posture: Defendant cut his seven-year-old nephew's neck with a knife during an altercation; trial judge gave the jury a standard civil definition of negligence

●  Statute: defined child abuse as "negligently causing a child to be placed in a situation that may endanger the child's life or health"

●  Reasoning: mens rea should be higher than the civil one to justify accompanying "social opprobrium." 

●  Holding: civil negligence can't be used here. The statute requires a showing of criminal negligence.  

## Distinguishing  Hazelwood  from  Santilles {#slide-23}

- Statutory language shows two crimes of varying degrees of seriousness.
- Hazelwood

<!-- -->

- Petroleum discharge can be legal with a permit/license.
- Typical criminal actors might be experts/experienced and thus can be held to a higher standard of care (lower bar for criminality = less leeway in deviation from care = higher standard)

<!-- -->

- Santillanes

<!-- -->

- Child abuse is far more morally heinous than handling petroleum.
- However, "endangering the child's life or health" without more specificity would cover a lot of conduct. Do we want to criminalize every negligent act that endangers a child? 

## Elonis v. United States {#slide-24}

●   Takeaway: When there is no clear mens rea, use the statutory text to interpret one into the statute. If one cannot be read into the statute, apply the default rules of the jurisdiction.

- MPC has a default standard of recklessness. MPC § 2.02(3)

●  Facts / Posture:  Defendant was convicted of communicating online threats to ex-wife & Kindergarten class through Facebook posts, which contained violent rap lyrics

●   Statute:  18 U.S.C. § 875(c) makes it a crime to transmit in interstate commerce "any communication containing any threat to . . . injure the person of another."

●   Reasoning:  There is no mens rea requirement in the statute. But the Court generally reads into criminal statutes a mens rea requirement, even if a statute does not contain one. Criminality requires negligence at minimum. A guilty mind is a necessary element in the indictment and proof of every crime.

●   Holding : Mens rea is required; in this case, a finding of at least negligence, if not recklessness, was required to convict 

## Papachristou  & Vagueness {#slide-25}

- Facts:  Papachristou & others were arrested and charged with vagrancy. FL's vagrancy ordinance prohibited several general activities, including loafing, wandering or strolling without any lawful purpose
- Issue:  violation of 14th amendment due process clause?
- Reasoning:  failure to give notice + too much discretion: "makes criminal activities which by modern standards are normally innocent" / reflect a sort of freedom we value as a country
- Holding : statute is void-for-vagueness / violates 14th Amendment due process
- Note:  statute was changed to "it is unlawful for any person to loiter or prowl in a place, at a time or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals, under circumstances that warrant a justifiable and reasonable alarm or immediate concern for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity."
- Takeaway: reflects value of clearly defined laws to limit police's moment-to-moment decisions and protect people's freedom

## Balkin's Crystalline Structure  {#slide-26}

- Jack M. Balkin suggests that  legal thought can be compared to a crystalline structure . The idea is to understand law as a dynamic system of rules, principles, and concepts that evolve and adapt over time. Just as a crystal can take on various forms while maintaining its underlying structure, legal thought can adapt to changing social and cultural contexts while retaining its fundamental principles.
- Balkin\'s crystalline structure metaphor emphasizes the flexibility and adaptability of legal systems. It suggests that legal concepts can undergo transformation and reinterpretation without losing their coherence. This perspective allows for an understanding of how legal ideas interact with and respond to societal changes, technological advancements, and cultural shifts.  

Balkin uses these diagrams, termed "dyads" to demonstrate that many, if not most, of the issues brought before courts and legislatures may be understood in terms of dyadic rule choices that could be similarly diagrammed.
