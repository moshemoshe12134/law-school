Actus Reus

- "Criminal liability always requires an 'actus reus,' that is, the  commission of some voluntary act that is prohibited by law."  See  MPC §1.13 and 2.01

<!-- -->

- For criminal liability to attach, there must be a commission or omission. (MPC §2.01)
- Criminal conduct must be voluntary ("volition requirement") (MPC §2.01(2))

<!-- -->

- What is not voluntary behavior ? Reflexes, convulsion, bodily movements during unconsciousness or sleep. 

<!-- -->

- Recall : 

<!-- -->

- Voluntariness can depend on time-framing ( Martin )

<!-- -->

- Voluntary acts combined with involuntary acts can give rise to criminal responsibility ( Decina )

<!-- -->

- Unconsciousness is a valid defense ( Newton )

## Mid-Semester Overview {#slide-4}

Mens Rea

- Criminal statutes must have a mens rea. MPC § 2.02(1). 										
- The default mens rea is recklessness §2.02(3). This is because (1) a prosecutor wouldn't go for the higher mens rea and make it unnecessarily harder for her case; and (2) a jury wouldn't need a higher mens rea to convict.																	
- Proving one mens rea also proves every mens rea "below" the proven level of culpability.  MPC § 2.02(5)  

  Recall

- Sometimes (but sometimes not), a demonstration of civil negligence can satisfy a  criminal  negligence mens rea standard. ( Hazelwood / Santillanes)
- When there is no clear mens rea, use the statutory text to interpret one into the statute. If one cannot be read into the statute, apply the default rules of the jurisdiction. ( Elonis )

Intentional Killings

§ 210.1. Criminal Homicide.

- (1) A person is guilty of criminal homicide if he purposely, knowingly, recklessly or negligently causes the death of another human being.
- (2) Criminal homicide is murder, manslaughter or negligent homicide.

§ 210.2. Murder.

Except as provided in Section 210.3(1)(b), criminal homicide constitutes murder when:

it is committed purposely or knowingly; or

it is committed recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life. Such recklessness and indifference are presumed if the actor is engaged or is an accomplice in the commission of, or an attempt to commit, or flight after committing or attempting to commit robbery, rape or deviate sexual intercourse by force or threat of force, arson, burglary, kidnapping or felonious escape.

 Murder is a felony of  the first degree  \[but a person convicted of murder may be sentenced to death, as provided in Section 210.6\].

- (a) mens rea: purposely or knowingly 
- (b) is essentially felony -murder rule -- presumes sort of heightened recklessness and indifference but allows for rebuttal (though this rebuttal isn't as protective as we might expect)

<!-- -->

- If defense, you would argue against this presumption saying it wasn't a heightened standard of recklessness and such recklessness shouldn't be presumed

## Mid-Semester Overview {#slide-7}

Intentional Killings (cont.)

§ 210.3. Manslaughter.

Criminal homicide constitutes manslaughter when:

(a) it is committed recklessly; or

(b) a homicide which would otherwise be murder is committed under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance for which there is reasonable explanation or excuse. The reasonableness of such explanation or excuse shall be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the actor\'s situation under the circumstances  as he believes them to be . \[subjective standard → defendant friendly\]

- Manslaughter is a felony of the   second degree .

§ 210.4. Negligent Homicide. 

Criminal homicide constitutes negligent homicide when it is committed negligently.

- Negligent homicide is a felony of the  third degree .

Reminder : Mitigation down from murder to manslaughter can happen in cases of EED and aggravation up from manslaughter to murder can happen in cases of felony/extreme recklessness 

## Mid-Semester Overview {#slide-8}

Unintentional Killings

- Unintended killings have a "lower" mens rea.  Can be negligent homicide, manslaughter, or reckless murder .  

<!-- -->

- Negligent homicide (§210.4); Manslaughter (§210.3); Reckless murder (§210.2(1)(b))

<!-- -->

- Recall  Malone  (extreme recklessness);  Canola  (felony murder);  Williams  (negligent manslaughter);  Hall, Welansky  (reckless manslaughter)

Unintentional Killings (cont.)

Note on Felony Murder

- MPC § 201.2   has no standalone felony-murder provision. Doesn't make felony-murder a strict liability offense but creates a presumption of recklessness (a conscious appreciation and disregard as to risk of death) when a homicide occurs during the commission of certain felonies. MPC doesn't like the felony-murder rule, but most states nonetheless retain some form of the rule ( see Stamp ,  Serné ,  Canola ) 

## Mid-Semester Overview {#slide-10}

The Death Penalty - Current Doctrine

Gregg v. Georgia  (1976) 

- Takeaway #1: death penalty does not per se constitute "cruel and unusual punishment" in violation of 8th and  14th Amendments 
-  Takeaway #2: death penalty for crime of murder does not per se constitute "cruel and unusual punishment" in violation of 8th and 14th Amendments 
- Takeaway #3: address previous problems with juries (arbitrary and capricious administration) by guiding discretion 

Atkins v. Virginia  (2002) 

- Takeaway #1:  violates 8th Amendment to sentence mentally disabled people to death

Note: ALI has withdrawn capital punishment section of the MPC, finding that preconditions for an adequately administered regime of capital punishment do not currently exist and cannot reasonably be expected to be achieved

## The Exam {#slide-11}

- 3 hours; open book; 2 questions; 2,500--3,000 words
- Fact-pattern (50%): analyzing the best arguments for each side and producing a just result under law

<!-- -->

- What charges would you file against whom and why?
- What defenses or issues would you raise on behalf of the individuals charged and why?
- Who would likely have the better of the argument---the prosecution or the defense---and why? 
- Law that governs → Might be MPC/amended MPC/new statute  

<!-- -->

- Policy question (50%): arguing for a change in law or legal theory that would produce more just results 

<!-- -->

- How would you critique (or support) a legal/critical theory?
- How does a particular theory apply to a given context?
- Should a specific statute/provision be revised?
- How would you have decided a specific case (or cases) differently?

<!-- -->

- See  past exams, sample answers, and some memoranda on Courseworks
