## Criminal Law                Session 8 {#slide-1}

## The   Hart/Devlin Debate   {#slide-2}

John Stuart Mill "On Liberty"

- Addressed : When can the government regulate something? Which liberties shouldn't be regulated?
- Propositions : we should be entitled to certain kinds of freedom

<!-- -->

- Shouldn't be any interference with anyone's liberty unless society is trying to protect itself (protect social order / community)
- Certain interests ought to be considered as rights and shouldn't be infringed upon
- Harm principle:  you should not in any way limit someone unless they are going to cause harm to someone else

 

Lord James Fitzjames Stephen

-  Thesis: Criminal law doesn't need to just look at harm, it can enforce morality (always has and always will -- that's what it's about)

<!-- -->

- "\[T\]here are acts of wickedness so gross and outrageous that, self-protection apart, they must be prevented as far as possible at any cost to the offender, and punished, if they occur, with exemplary severity"

 

HLA Hart:  cosigns simplest version of Mill's harm principle

Lord Patrick Devlin  "Morals and the Criminal Law"

- "the law must base itself on Christian morals. . . . \[W\]ithout the help of Christian teaching the law will fail"

<!-- -->

- "the law exists for the protection of society" / institutions so people can live together
-  Tolerate maximum individual freedom but express majority opprobrium in the criminal law  

Hart-Devlin Debates

- Hart/Mill:  Harm principle  = "the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others"
- Devlin/Stephen:  Legal moralism  = the criminal law is always based on moral principles and serves to  uphold a moral order

<!-- -->

- "Immoral" activities should be criminalized because they are immoral

## The Collapse of the Harm Principle  {#slide-3}

- Discussion:  What would a reasonable legal moralist say about changing morals in society? Should the criminal law

reflect that?

- Key question:  would reflecting that change serve the health / integrity of society? → Important to change the law because if law doesn't reflect people's moral norms, there will be chaos / uprising
- But maybe a change in the law helps push a change in moral norms? (i.e., abolishing death penalty spurred decrease in support for death penalty)

 

- Arguments about legal moralism transformed into arguments about harm → collapse of harm principle

<!-- -->

- Now most people think harm principle prevails so it's inappropriate to just enforce morality (Hart won)
- So now legal moralists have to fit their argument about prohibiting "immorality" into ideas of harm, not morality = collapse

<!-- -->

- i.e., shift from drugs as victimless (and just immoral) crimes to "this is your brain on drugs"
- But then in response to this, drug legalizers say "your war on drugs causes more harm" so now drug conversation focuses on "harm reduction" language (would reduce overall harm of these substances to make them legal)
- SO NOW harm principle doesn't help distinguish what to regulate, we're just measuring and balancing harms

<!-- -->

-  i.e., regulate pornography / sex work because it causes harm to those involved and contributes to rape culture.

## Bowers v. Hardwick {#slide-4}

Bowers v. Hardwick (1986)

- Facts : A Georgia statute criminalized oral and anal sex. Hardwick, and adult male, was charged with violating the statute with another adult male in Hardwick's home. The District Attorney decided not to pursue the matter before a grand jury. Hardwick challenged the statute's constitutionality in federal district court, arguing that as a homosexual he was at risk of being arrested under the statute again in the future. The district court dismissed the suit for failing to state a claim. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, finding that Hardwick's homosexual activities were private and could not be regulated by state law under the Ninth Amendment and the Due Process Clause, and that the Georgia statute therefore violated Hardwick's fundamental rights.
- Issue : Does the U.S. Constitution provide a fundamental right to engage in homosexual sodomy?

<!-- -->

- Under pure harm principle, we would say that, to criminalize conduct, we need more than just a claim that the moral order will unravel → sodomy shouldn't be criminalized 
- Under pure legal moralism, if this is beyond level of tolerance → should be criminalized

- Holding: majority fails to find "right" of queer people "to engage in sodomy" → can be criminalized

## Lawrence v. Texas  {#slide-5}

 

Lawrence v. Texas (2003)

- Facts :  Police officers were dispatched to the home of John Lawrence (defendant) in response to a report of a weapons disturbance. When the police went into the home, the police observed Lawrence and Tyron Garner (defendant) engaged in a sexual act. The State of Texas (plaintiff) charged Lawrence and Garner with engaging in deviate sexual intercourse with a person of the same sex. Lawrence and Garner were convicted by a Justice of the Peace and exercised their right to a new trial in criminal court. Lawrence and Garner argued that the statute was a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. The criminal court rejected the arguments, and Lawrence and Garner entered a plea of nolo contendere. The court of appeals confirmed the convictions, and Lawrence and Garner petitioned the United States Supreme Court for review.
- Issue : were petitioners "free as adults to engage in the private conduct in the exercise of their liberty under the Due Process Clause?"
- Holding : morality is not a sufficient basis to criminalize this conduct (adopted harm principle)

○ Harcourt: this was the first time SCOTUS rejected "Devlin"

## Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Org (2022) {#slide-6}

Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Org (2022)

- In 1973,  Roe v. Wade  guaranteed the constitutional right to obtain an abortion until the point of fetal viability. In 1992,  Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey  held that states could not impose an undue burden on the right to obtain an abortion. In 2018, Mississippi enacted the Gestational Age Act, which generally prohibited abortion of fetuses with a gestational age of more than 15 weeks. In enacting the statute, the Mississippi legislature asserted a state interest in protecting unborn life. Mississippi abortion clinic Jackson Women's Health Organization and one of its doctors (collectively, Jackson) (plaintiffs) brought an action in federal district court against state health officer Thomas Dobbs (defendant), arguing that the statute unconstitutionally limited the right to abortion. The district court granted summary judgment in Jackson's favor and permanently enjoined the statute's enforcement, holding that a state has a constitutionally adequate interest in banning non therapeutic abortions only at the point of fetal viability, and 15 weeks was pre-viability. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, and the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari. Mississippi and 25 other states asked the Court to overrule  Roe  and  Casey  and return regulation of abortion to the individual states. Jackson and the United States Solicitor General asked the Court to reaffirm  Roe  and  Casey  and find the Mississippi statute unconstitutional.
- Majority fails to find "the right to obtain an abortion," "the right to privacy," "the freedom to make intimate personal choices" that are "central to personal dignity and autonomy" in the constitution
- Reasoning: ○ History of criminalization → against finding fundamental right ○ Countervailing interest in life of the fetus (morality / harm principle come in here) → passes rational basis

## Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Org (2022) {#slide-7}

Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Org (2022) - Harm Principle Arguments

The Dobbs decision reflects the proliferation of harm arguments and the turn to harm by social conservatives.

Alito (Majority)

- Abortion presents a profound  moral  issue on which Americans hold sharply conflicting views.
- The Court usurped the power to address a question of profound moral and social importance that the Constitution unequivocally leaves for the people

Thomas (concurrence):  "Substantive due process conflicts with that textual command and has  harmed  our country in many ways. Accordingly, we should eliminate it from our jurisprudence at the earliest opportunity...the harm caused by this Court's forays into substantive due process remains immeasurable"

- Kavanaugh:  Roe  caused significant harm to what Roe itself recognized as the State's "important and legitimate interest" in protecting fetal life. "

## Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Org (2022) {#slide-8}

Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Org (2022) - Harm Principle Arguments

 

Dissent (Breyer, joined by Sotomayor, Kagan)

- "Across a vast array of circumstances, a State will be able to impose its moral choice on a woman and coerce her to give birth to a child."
- "\[Some women\] will try an unsafe method of abortion, and come to physical harm, or even die."
- "for some women, as Roe recognized, abortions are medically necessary to prevent harm."
- "It forces her to carry out the State's will, whatever the circumstances and whatever the harm it will wreak on her and her family. In the Fourteenth Amendment's terms, it takes away her liberty."
- "The standards Roe and Casey set out are perfectly workable. No changes in either law or fact have eroded the two decisions. And tens of millions of American women have relied, and continue to rely, on the right to choose.  So under traditional stare decisis principles, the majority has no special justification for the harm it causes.

## Self-Defense in the MPC  {#slide-9}

§  3.04. Use of Force in Self-Protection.

 (1)  Use of Force Justifiable for Protection of the Person.   Subject to the provisions of this Section and of Section 3.09, the use of force upon or toward another person is justifiable when the actor believes that such force is immediately necessary for the purpose of protecting himself against the use of unlawful force by such other person on the present occasion.

(2)  Limitations on Justifying Necessity for Use of Force.  

(a) The use of force is not justifiable under this Section:

(i) to resist an arrest that the actor knows is being made by a peace officer, although the arrest is unlawful;  or

(ii) to resist force used by the occupier or possessor of property or by another person on his behalf, where the actor knows that the person using the force is doing so under a claim of right to protect the property, except that this limitation shall not apply if:

(A) the actor is a public officer acting in the performance of his duties or a person lawfully assisting him therein or a person making or assisting in a lawful arrest;  or

(B) the actor has been unlawfully dispossessed of the property and is making a re-entry or recaption justified by Section 3.06;  or

(C) the actor believes that such force is necessary to protect himself against death or serious bodily injury.

of crime.

 

## MPC §3.04 Cont. {#slide-10}

b) The use of deadly force is  not justifiable  under this Section unless the actor believes that such force is necessary to protect himself against death, serious bodily injury, kidnapping or sexual intercourse compelled by force or threat;  nor is it justifiable if:

(i) the actor, with the purpose of causing death or serious bodily injury, provoked the use of force against himself in the same encounter;  or

(ii) the actor knows that he can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety by retreating or by surrendering possession of a thing to a person asserting a claim of right thereto or by complying with a demand that he abstain from any action that he has no duty to take, except that:

(A) the actor is not obliged to retreat from his dwelling or place of work, unless he was the initial aggressor or is assailed in his place of work by another person whose place of work the actor knows it to be;  and

(B) a public officer justified in using force in the performance of his duties or a person justified in using force in his assistance or a person justified in using force in making an arrest or preventing an escape is not obliged to desist from efforts to perform such duty, effect such arrest or prevent such escape because of resistance or threatened resistance by or on behalf of the person against whom such action is directed.

(c) Except as required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Subsection, a person employing protective force may estimate the necessity thereof under the circumstances as he believes them to be when the force is used, without retreating, surrendering possession, doing any other act that he has no legal duty to do or abstaining from any lawful action.

(3)  Use of Confinement as Protective Force.   The justification afforded by this Section extends to the use of confinement as protective force only if the actor takes all reasonable measures to terminate the confinement as soon as he knows that he safely can, unless the person confined has been arrested on a charge of crime.

 

## Self-defense in the MPC Cont. {#slide-11}

§  3.09.  Mistake of Law as to Unlawfulness of Force or Legality of Arrest;  Reckless or Negligent Use of Otherwise Justifiable Force;  Reckless or Negligent Injury or Risk of Injury to Innocent Persons.

 

 (1) The justification afforded by Sections 3.04 to 3.07, inclusive, is unavailable when:

 

(a) the actor\'s belief in the unlawfulness of the force or conduct against which he employs protective force or his belief in the lawfulness of an arrest that he endeavors to effect by force is erroneous;  and

 

(b) his error is due to ignorance or mistake as to the provisions of the Code, any other provision of the criminal law or the law governing the legality of an arrest or search.

 

(2) When the actor believes that the use of force upon or toward the person of another is necessary for any of the purposes for which such belief would establish a justification under Sections 3.03 to 3.08 but the actor is reckless or negligent in having such belief or in acquiring or failing to acquire any knowledge or belief that is material to the justifiability of his use of force, the justification afforded by those Sections is unavailable in a prosecution for an offense for which recklessness or negligence, as the case may be, suffices to establish culpability.

 

(3) When the actor is justified under Sections 3.03 to 3.08 in using force upon or toward the person of another but he recklessly or negligently injures or creates a risk of injury to innocent persons, the justification afforded by those Sections is unavailable in a prosecution for such recklessness or negligence towards innocent persons.

 

## United States v. Peterson {#slide-12}

United States v. Peterson (D.C., 1973)

Facts:  Bennie Peterson (defendant) came out of his house and discovered Charles Keitt stealing windshield wipers from his car, which was parked in the alley behind Peterson's property. Peterson argued with Keitt, then went back inside and got a gun. When Peterson returned, Keitt was about to drive off. Peterson threatened to kill Keitt. Keitt got out of the car, grabbed a lug wrench, and walked toward Peterson with the wrench in the air. Peterson told Keitt not to come closer. Keitt advanced, though he was still in the alleyway, and Peterson shot and killed him. Peterson was standing in his yard at the time. Peterson was indicted for second-degree murder. At trial, Peterson sought a judgment of acquittal based on insufficient evidence, which was denied. The judge instructed the jury on self-defense. The judge said that self-defense generally does not excuse a killing if the defendant provoked the altercation, though words alone did not constitute provocation. The judge also told the jury that even if Peterson started the fight, self-defense was available if he withdrew from the conflict in good faith and let Keitt know by words or acts. The judge instructed the jury that Peterson was under no duty to retreat but it could consider whether he could have safely retreated in deciding whether his actions were justified. Peterson was found guilty of manslaughter. Peterson appealed, arguing that the judge wrongly instructed the jury. - Verdict was ultimately affirmed because the following conditions were not present:

● Conditions for using deadly use of force (in self-defense):

(1) There must have been a threat, actual or apparent, of the use of deadly force against the actor;

(2) Threat must have been unlawful and immediate;

(3) Actor must have believed he was in imminent peril of death or serious bodily harm, and that his response was necessary to save himself; AND

(4) These beliefs must have been honestly entertained and objectively reasonable in light of the circumstances

● Takeaway: Self defense is available as a justification when actor reasonably believes defensive force is necessary

● "Necessity is the pervasive theme of the well-defined conditions which the law imposes on the right to kill or maim in self defense.

## People v. Goetz {#slide-13}

 People v. Goetz

● Takeaway: "Reasonably" must be interpreted objectively and can't be solely based on defendant's own

subjective interpretation. The objectivity of defendant's belief may be informed by circumstances of the case,

e.g., past defendant's past experiences.

- Maybe defendant's past allows for introduction of subjectivity

● Facts: Four juveniles were in a subway car with defendant, who held a concealed gun. He began carrying this

gun after a mugging a few years prior. One of the kids walked up to defendant and demanded \$5 from him.

No evidence that the kids were armed, though some had screwdrivers in their coats. Defendant shot each of

the kids, shooting twice at one whom he missed initially. He admitted to the shootings and told police he

would have shot them more had he had more bullets.

● Procedural posture: dismissed the indictment because of subjective reasonableness (reasonable to him)

● Reasoning:

- NY adopted much of the MPC but crucially added "reasonably" before "believes."
- Interpreting the statute to say "reasonable to him" would render "reasonably" meaningless and would allow subjective
- views to completely exonerate him.
- Lower courts' interpretations would allow citizens to set their own standards for permissible use of force.
- Reasonableness inquiry happens with regard to the actual circumstances of the particular incident, including past
- experiences of the defendant.

●  Holding: Indictment reinstated. 

- Note: this doesn't mean he's guilty -- this just means the case will keep being tried
- Eventually was acquitted. 

## Battered Women Syndrome - State v. Norman  {#slide-14}

State v. Norman (North Carolina)

● Takeaway: to claim battered woman syndrome as a perfect self-defense, the threat must be something concrete and material at the time of the use of force, not an ongoing, consistent threat of abuse

- Note: does this fit the reality of victims' abuse?
- Self defense remains rooted in necessity

● Facts: Norman was badly abused during 25-year marriage. She shot her husband while he was asleep and was charged with first-degree murder. At trial, she presented evidence of suffering from battered wife syndrome as proof of a perfect self-defense. Jury convicted her of voluntary manslaughter.

- Note: the day before she killed her husband, he beat her really badly and she tried to kill herself -- she was clearly feeling like she was out of options

● Procedural posture: convicted of voluntary manslaughter; defendant appealed; court of appeals found that jury could reasonably have found that she killed her husband in self defense

● Rule: self defense can be perfect or imperfect

- Perfect: evidence, viewed in light most favorable to defendant, tends to show that at the time of the killing it appeared to the defendant and she reasonably believed it to be necessary to kill her husband to save herself from imminent death or great bodily harm
- Imperfect: when defendant is the initial aggressor, but without intent to kill / seriously injure, and decedent escalates confrontation
- Where defendant reasonably believes there's imminent threat of death / great bodily harm → reduced liability

● Reasoning: couldn't be reasonably believed to be under imminent threat of great bodily harm -- defendant's husband was asleep

● Holding: jury could not have reasonably found she killed her husband in self defense; defendant in present case was not entitled to jury instruction on either perfect or imperfect self-defense → no new trial
