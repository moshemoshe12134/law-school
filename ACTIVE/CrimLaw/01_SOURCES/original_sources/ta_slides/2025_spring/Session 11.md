## Attempt MPC §5.01 {#slide-2}

Section 5.01.  Criminal Attempt

(1)   Definition of Attempt.  A person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if,  acting with the kind of culpability otherwise  required for commission  of the crime,  he:   

(a)  purposely engages in  conduct  which would constitute the crime if the attendant circumstances were as he believes them to be;  OR   

(b)  when causing a particular result is an element of the crime, does or omits to do anything with the purpose of causing or with the belief that it will cause  such result  without further conduct on his part;  OR  

(c)  purposely does or omits to do anything which, under the circumstances as he believes them to be, is an act or omission constituting a  substantial step  in a course of conduct planned to culminate in his commission of the crime.  

\*\*\*

(2)  Conduct Which May Be Held  Substantial Step  Under Subsection (1)(c). Conduct shall not be held to constitute a substantial step under Subsection (1)(c) of this Section unless it is strongly corroborative of the actor\'s criminal purpose.  Without negativing the sufficiency of other conduct, the following, if strongly corroborative of the actor\'s criminal purpose, shall not be held insufficient as a matter of law:  

(a)  lying in wait, searching for or following the contemplated victim of the crime;

(b)  enticing or seeking to entice the contemplated victim of the crime to go to the place contemplated for its commission; 

                                       

## Attempt MPC §5.01 {#slide-3}

Section 5.01.  Criminal Attempt  (cont'd)

(2)  Conduct Which May Be Held  Substantial Step  Under Subsection (1)(c). Conduct shall not be held to constitute a substantial step under Subsection (1)(c) of this Section unless it is strongly corroborative of the actor\'s criminal purpose.  Without negativing the sufficiency of other conduct, the following, if strongly corroborative of the actor\'s criminal purpose, shall not be held insufficient as a matter of law:  

(a)  lying in wait, searching for or following the contemplated victim of the crime;

(b)  enticing or seeking to entice the contemplated victim of the crime to go to the place contemplated for its commission; 

 	 (c)  reconnoitering the place contemplated for the commission of the crime; 

(d)  unlawful entry of a structure, vehicle or enclosure in which it is contemplated that the crime will be committed; 

(e)  possession of materials to be employed in the commission of the crime, which are specially designed for such unlawful use or which can serve no lawful purpose of the actor under the circumstances; 

(f)  possession, collection or fabrication of materials to be employed in the commission of the crime, at or near the place contemplated for its commission, where such possession, collection or fabrication serves no lawful purpose of the actor under the circumstances; 

(g)  soliciting an innocent agent to engage in conduct constituting an element of the crime.  

                              

## MPC §5.01 Cont. {#slide-4}

Section 5.01.  Criminal Attempt  (cont'd)

(3)   Conduct Designed to Aid Another in Commission of a Crime.   A person who engages in cond uct designed to  aid another  to commit a crime which would establish his complicity under Section 2.06 if the crime were committed by such other person, is  guilty of an attempt to commit  the crime, although the crime is not committed or attempted by such other person.  

(4)   Renunciation of Criminal Purpose.   When the actor\'s conduct would otherwise constitute an attempt under Subsection (1)(b) or (1)(c) of this Section, it is an affirmative defense that he abandoned his effort to commit the crime or otherwise prevented its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.  The establishment of such defense does not, however, affect the liability of an accomplice who did not join in such abandonment or prevention. Within the meaning of this Article, renunciation of criminal purpose is not voluntary if it is motivated, in whole or in part, by circumstances, not present or apparent at the inception of the actor\'s course of conduct, which increase the probability of detection or apprehension or which make more difficult the accomplishment of the criminal purpose.  Renunciation is not complete if it is motivated by a decision to postpone the criminal conduct until a more advantageous time or to transfer the criminal effort to another but similar objective or victim. \[ Affirmative defense of abandonment \] 

## People v. Rizzo {#slide-5}

Facts:

- Charles Rizzo and three others planned to rob Charles Rao of a \$1,200 payroll.
- Rizzo was to identify Rao while the others would carry out the robbery.
- Armed with guns, they searched for Rao in town and at locations linked to his payroll pickup.
- Police suspicion led to a chase, during which Rizzo fled into a building, resulting in the arrest of all four men.
- Rao was never found, and no one with a payroll was located at the searched locations.

Issue:

- Can a defendant be convicted of attempt if they haven\'t performed an act so close to completing the crime that it would likely have happened without interference?

Holding:

- No. Attempt requires an intentional act so near to the crime\'s completion that it would probably succeed if not for interference.
- Merely preparing for a crime isn\'t enough; the act must have a \"dangerous proximity\" to success.

Takeaway:

- Intent alone isn\'t sufficient for an attempt conviction; the act must be close to completing the crime.
- In this case, despite intent, the defendants\' actions were too remote from the crime to support an attempt conviction.

## McQuirter v. State {#slide-6}

Facts:

- Mrs. Allen, a white woman, walked home with her children when McQuirter, a black man, made unintelligible remarks and followed her.
- McQuirter later stated he intended to assault and possibly rape the first woman he encountered.
- He followed Allen to the end of a street, leaned against a stop sign, then returned to his truck after about 30 minutes.
- McQuirter denied any harmful intent, claiming he was searching for a colleague.

Issue:

- Is intent a matter for the jury to determine based on trial evidence, including social conditions and customs influenced by racial differences?

Holding:

- Yes. Intent for the crime of attempt to commit assault with intent to rape is a jury determination.
- Jury must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intended to engage in non-consensual intercourse through force or fear.
- Social factors, including racial differences between the defendant and victim, can be considered. (Tip: Recall Foucault)
- Sufficient evidence existed to submit McQuirter\'s guilt to the jury, so his conviction was affirmed.

## Complicity MPC §2.06 {#slide-7}

(1)  A person is guilty of an offense if it is committed by his own conduct or by the conduct of another person  for which he is legally accountable ,  or both.  

(2)  A person is  legally accountable  for the conduct of another person when:  

(a)  acting with the kind of  mens rea  that is sufficient for the commission of the offense, he  causes  an innocent or irresponsible person to engage in such conduct;  OR  

(b)  he is made  accountable for the conduct of such other person  by the Code or by the law defining the offense;  OR   

(c)  he is an  accomplice  of such other person in the commission of the offense.\*  

(3)  \*A person is an  accomplice  of another person in the commission of an offense if:  

(a)   with the purpose  of promoting or facilitating the commission of the offense, he 

(i)  solicits such other person to commit it;  OR 

(ii)  aids or agrees or   attempts  to aid such other person in  planning or committing  it;  OR

(iii)  having a legal duty to prevent the commission of the offense, fails to  make proper effort so to do;  OR   

(b)  his conduct is expressly declared by law to establish his complicity.  

## MPC §2.06 Cont. {#slide-8}

(4)  When causing a particular result is an element of an offense, an accomplice in the conduct causing such result is an accomplice in the commission of that offense, if he acts with the kind of culpability, if any, with respect to that result that is sufficient for the commission of the offense. 

(5)  A person who is legally incapable of committing a particular offense himself may be guilty thereof if it is committed by the conduct of another person for which he is legally accountable, unless such liability is inconsistent with the purpose of the provision establishing his incapacity.  

(6)  Unless otherwise provided by the Code or by the law defining the offense, a person is not an accomplice in an offense committed by another person if:  

(a)  he is a victim of that offense;  OR   

(b)  the offense is so defined that his conduct is inevitably incident to its commission;  OR   

(c)  he terminates his complicity prior to the commission of the offense  AND  

(i)  wholly deprives it of effectiveness in the commission of the offense;  OR 

(ii)  gives timely warning to the law enforcement authorities or otherwise makes proper effort to prevent the commission of the offense.  

(7)  An accomplice may be convicted on proof of the commission of the offense and of his complicity therein, though the person claimed to have committed the offense has not been prosecuted or convicted or has been convicted of a different offense or degree of offense or has an immunity to prosecution or conviction or has been acquitted.

## State v. Gladstone {#slide-9}

Facts:

- Thompson, a police agent, tried to buy marijuana from Gladstone but was directed to Kent instead.
- Gladstone provided Thompson with Kent\'s address and a map to his residence.
- Thompson successfully bought marijuana from Kent, but there was no evidence of communication between Gladstone and Kent.

Issue:

- Does mere communication suggesting another might commit a crime amount to aiding and abetting if the crime is committed?

Holding:

- No. To be guilty of aiding and abetting, one must associate with the criminal venture and actively contribute to its success.
- There must be evidence of counseling, encouragement, hiring, commanding, inducing, or procuring the crime.
- In this case, there was no communication or action by Gladstone to assist Kent in selling marijuana to Thompson.
- Therefore, Gladstone\'s conviction for aiding and abetting was reversed.

## State v. McVay {#slide-10}

Facts:

- McVay, captain of the steamer ship Mackinac, and Grant, the ship\'s engineer, were aware that the boiler producing steam was unsafe but continued the voyage from Pawtucket to Newport.
- The boiler exploded during the voyage, resulting in the deaths of three passengers.
- Kelley was charged as an accessory before the fact for aiding and abetting McVay and Grant in causing the deaths.

Issue:

- Can an individual be charged as an accessory before the fact to manslaughter, even if manslaughter is  sudden and unpremeditated ?

Holding:

- YES! While manslaughter is often sudden and unpremeditated, it can also result from gross negligence. A person who aids and abets another in such  gross negligence  \[ mens rea \] can be guilty as an accessory before the fact.
- In this case, Kelley intentionally directed and counseled the grossly negligent act that led to the deaths.

<!-- -->

- The negligent act was choosing to create steam beyond the boiler\'s safe capacity, which McVay and Grant knowingly pursued.
- Kelley\'s actions, if proven true, show  reckless and willful  advising, counseling, and commanding,  leading to the deaths.

<!-- -->

- So, Kelley can be charged as an accessory before the fact to manslaughter.

## Commonwealth v. Roebuck {#slide-11}

Facts:

- Roebuck and others lured a man into an apartment complex, where they ambushed and shot him, resulting in his death.
- While Roebuck helped plan the ambush, he did not directly shoot the victim.
- Roebuck was convicted of third-degree murder as an accomplice.

Issue:

- Can a defendant be convicted as an accomplice to third-degree murder?

Holding:

- YES! Accomplice liability is based on aiding the principal actor with the required mental state, not necessarily the result of the principal act.  Thus, Roebuck\'s conviction as an accomplice to third-degree murder is  affirmed .
- The culpability requirement for accomplice liability may differ from that of the principal actor.
- It is sufficient for a  defendant to act with the culpable mental state  required of the principal actor and intentionally  aid  in the commission of the crime. \[IT DOES NOT MATTER IF DEF. DID NOT  INTEND  RESULT!\] 

<!-- -->

- Third-degree murder, often involving unintentional killing, requires recklessness, which is not tied to the result but to the defendant\'s conduct.
- Roebuck\'s reckless conduct and aid to the principal actor in the murder satisfy the criteria for accomplice liability.

## People v. Luparello {#slide-12}

Facts:

- Luparello enlisted friends to locate his former girlfriend \"at any cost\" from Mark Martin.
- Armed with weapons, the friends lured Martin outside, and one of them shot and killed him.
- Luparello was charged with murder under an aiding-and-abetting theory.

Issue:

- Can a defendant only be found guilty as an aider and abettor or co-conspirator of a crime he intended to facilitate or encourage?

Holding:

- No. While the perpetrator must manifest the required intent, an aider and abettor can be held equally liable based on accomplice liability.
- Accomplice liability requires intentional encouragement, assistance, or influence in the illegal act.
- Liability extends to the actual crime committed, not just the planned or intended crime, based on the principle that aiders and abettors are responsible for foreseeable criminal harms.
- Luparello could be found guilty of first-degree murder under an aiding-and-abetting theory, as he intentionally encouraged, assisted, or influenced the illegal act.
- The trial court properly instructed the jury, and Luparello\'s conviction is affirmed.
