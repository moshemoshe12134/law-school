## Conspiracy MPC §5.03 {#slide-2}

(1)   Definition of Conspiracy.   A person is guilty of conspiracy with another person or persons to commit a crime if with the purpose of promoting or facilitating its commission he:  

(a)  agrees with such other person or persons that they or one or more of them will engage in conduct which constitutes such crime or an attempt or solicitation to commit such crime; or  

(b)  agrees to aid such other person or persons in the planning or commission of such crime or of an attempt or solicitation to commit such crime.  

(2)   Scope of Conspiratorial Relationship.   If a person guilty of conspiracy, as defined by Subsection (1) of this Section, knows that a person with whom he conspires to commit a crime has conspired with another person or persons to commit the same crime, he is guilty of conspiring with such other person or persons, whether or not he knows their identity, to commit such crime.  

(3)   Conspiracy With Multiple Criminal Objectives.   If a person conspires to commit a number of crimes, he is guilty of only one conspiracy so long as such multiple crimes are the object of the same agreement or continuous conspiratorial relationship.  

(4)   Joinder and Venue in Conspiracy Prosecutions.  

(a)  Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this Subsection, two or more persons charged with criminal conspiracy may be prosecuted jointly if: 

(i)  they are charged with conspiring with one another; or 

(ii)  the conspiracies alleged, whether they have the same or different  parties, are so related that they constitute different aspects of a scheme of  organized criminal conduct.  

## MPC §5.03 Cont. mpc §5.03 mp {#slide-3}

(b)  In any joint prosecution under paragraph (a) of this Subsection: 

(i)  no defendant shall be charged with a conspiracy in any county \[parish or  district\] other than one in which he entered into such conspiracy or in which an overt act pursuant to such conspiracy was done by him or by a person with whom he conspired; and 

(ii)  neither the liability of any defendant nor the admissibility against him of evidence of acts or declarations of another shall be enlarged by such joinder; and 

(iii)  the Court shall order a severance or take a special verdict as to any defendant who so requests, if it deems it necessary or appropriate to promote the fair determination of his guilt or innocence, and shall take any other proper measures to protect the fairness of the trial.  

(5)   Overt Act.   No person may be convicted of conspiracy to commit a crime, other than a felony of the first or second degree, unless an overt act in pursuance of such conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by him or by a person with whom he conspired.  

(6)   Renunciation of Criminal Purpose.   It is an affirmative defense that the actor, after conspiring to commit a crime, thwarted the success of the conspiracy, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.  

(7)   Duration of Conspiracy.   For purposes of Section 1.06(4):  

(a)  conspiracy is a continuing course of conduct which terminates when the crime or crimes which are its object are committed or the agreement that they be committed is abandoned by the defendant and by those with whom he conspired; and  

(b)  such abandonment is presumed if neither the defendant nor anyone with whom he conspired does any overt act in pursuance of the conspiracy during the applicable period of limitation; and  

(c)  if an individual abandons the agreement, the conspiracy is terminated as to him only if and when he advises those with whom he conspired of his abandonment or he informs the law enforcement authorities of the existence of the conspiracy and of his participation therein.

## Krulewitch v. United States  K {#slide-4}

Facts:

- Krulewitch and another person were charged with conspiring to violate and actually violating the Mann Act, which prohibited interstate transportation for prostitution.
- The government argued that the conspiracy continued even after the transportation was completed.
- The continuation of the conspiracy was crucial because statements made during the conspiracy could be admitted at trial against all co-conspirators.

Issue:

- Does the conspiracy cease after the purpose or object of the conspiracy concludes?

Holding:

- Yes. After the purpose or object of the conspiracy concludes, the conspiracy ceases.
- The modern crime of conspiracy is predominantly mental and requires a meeting of minds and intent to commit an act.
- The conspiracy doctrine, while flexible, poses inherent dangers, such as incriminating individuals on the fringe of an offense and blurring the line between civil and criminal proceedings.
- The Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury may be compromised, as accused conspirators can be tried in any district where any co-conspirator committed an act related to the conspiracy.
- Conspiracy should be proved with clear evidence of a meeting of the minds and intent to accomplish the object of the conspiracy, rather than relying on implied or constructive conspiracy.

## Interstate Circuit v. United States In {#slide-5}

Facts:

- Interstate Circuit, Inc. (Interstate) and Texas Consolidated Theaters (Consolidated) dominated the movie-theater market in various Texas cities.
- They entered agreements with eight independent film distributors, specifying terms for showing films in their theaters.
- Interstate\'s manager, O'Donnell, sent letters to the distributors, making demands as conditions for showing their films, which each distributor agreed to.
- The trial court found that the distributors conspired to take uniform action regarding O'Donnell's demands, violating § 1 of the Sherman Act.

Issue:

- Can an agreement to participate in a conspiracy be inferred from the course of conduct of alleged co-conspirators under § 1 of the Sherman Act?

Holding:

- Yes. Direct evidence of co-conspirators\' agreement is often unavailable.
- Under § 1 of the Sherman Act, an agreement to participate in a conspiracy can be inferred from the course of conduct.
- Each distributor knew about O'Donnell's demands and that other distributors were considering them, creating a motive for concerted action.
- Knowledge of the plan, adherence to it, and participation in it are sufficient for an unlawful conspiracy.
- Cooperation among the distributors was essential for the plan\'s success, and they knew it would result in a restraint of commerce violating the Sherman Act.
- Therefore, the judgment is affirmed.

## People v. Lauria {#slide-6}

Facts:

- Lauria\'s telephone answering service was used by three known prostitutes for business purposes.
- A police officer, posing as a prostitute, signed up with Lauria\'s service and periodically complained about lost calls and messages for \"tricks.\"
- Lauria defended his service, emphasizing it was for taking messages.
- Lauria and the three prostitutes were arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit prostitution.

Issue:

- Must the prosecution show that a supplier of goods or services had knowledge of the illegal use and intent to further that illegal use to make them a participant in a criminal conspiracy?

Holding:

- Yes. To establish a conspiracy, the prosecution must show an agreement to further an illegal act.
- Knowledge of another\'s criminal activity alone is not enough to constitute a conspiracy.
- Intent to further the illegal activity and a stake in the venture are necessary elements.
- In cases like United States v. Falcone and Direct Sales Co. v. United States, mere knowledge of illegal activity did not constitute conspiracy without intent and a stake in the venture.
- Intent may be inferred when the supplier has a stake in the illegal venture, no legitimate use for the goods or services exists, or the sales for illegal use account for a high proportion of the supplier\'s total business.
- Lauria did not have a financial gain from the illegal activity, and there was no evidence of unusual volume in his business.
- Without evidence of direct action to further the prostitution activities or a special interest in the outcome, Lauria cannot be held criminally culpable in the conspiracy.
- The order dismissing the indictment is affirmed.

## Conspiracy as Complicity: Pinkerton v. U.S. {#slide-7}

Facts:

- Brothers Walter and Daniel Pinkerton were indicted for violations of the Internal Revenue Code involving possession, transportation, and sale of whiskey.
- Both were found guilty on substantive counts and conspiracy charges, even though only Walter committed the substantive offenses.
- The jury found that Daniel could be convicted of Walter\'s substantive offenses if they were done in furtherance of the conspiracy.

Issue:

- Is a defendant who conspires with another person criminally liable for all substantive offenses committed by the coconspirator in furtherance of the conspiracy, even if the defendant did not know about the coconspirator\'s acts and did not assist him in any manner?

Holding:

- Yes. When individuals conspire to commit illegal acts, the criminal intent to commit substantive offenses is achieved, regardless of who commits them.
- The conspiracy continues until a coconspirator affirmatively withdraws from it.
- All coconspirators are responsible for acts done in furtherance of the conspiracy until one intentionally removes themselves.
- Daniel, though not directly participating in the substantive offenses, was part of the conspiracy with Walter.
- Acts committed by one conspirator in furtherance of the conspiracy are attributable to all members.
- Daniel\'s conviction on substantive offenses committed by Walter is upheld as they were done in execution of the conspiracy.
- The judgments of conviction are affirmed.

## State v. Bridges  State {#slide-8}

Facts:

- Bennie Bridges attended a birthday party where he got into an argument and left, promising to return with his \"boys.\"
- Bridges found two acquaintances, Bing and Rolle, and asked them to come back to the party with him, which they agreed to.
- Bing and Rolle retrieved guns to intimidate others at the party.
- Returning to the party, a street fight erupted between Bridges and another guest, during which Bing and Rolle fired their guns, resulting in a death and injury.
- Bridges was convicted of conspiracy and multiple substantive crimes, including murder, but appealed, arguing that specific intent was required for conviction of substantive crimes.

Issue: 

- May a coconspirator be held criminally liable for substantive crimes occurring during the conspiracy if those crimes are reasonably foreseeable as necessary or natural consequences of the conspiracy?

Holding and Reasoning (Handler, J.):

- Yes. A coconspirator can be held criminally liable for substantive crimes if they are reasonably foreseeable as necessary or natural consequences of the conspiracy.
- The state legislature did not change the common law regarding coconspirator liability, indicating an intent to impose vicarious criminal liability on coconspirators for substantive crimes.
- While specific intent may be required for certain crimes, the analysis depends on a causal connection between the crimes and the conspiracy, not on specific intent.
- The jury instruction during trial did not adequately present this standard, but the evidence showed that the substantive crimes were a foreseeable consequence of the conspiracy.
- Bridges knew Bing and Rolle had guns to intimidate, foreseeing escalation and gunfire during the altercation.
- Therefore, the judgment of the appeals court is affirmed in part and reversed in part, remanding the case.

## U.S. v. Alvarez StateU.D {#slide-9}

Facts:

- Defendants were involved in a conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute.
- During a meeting with undercover agents, one of the agents was shot and killed.
- Defendants were charged with conspiracy and murder.
- Defendants appealed, arguing that the murder conviction was based on an inappropriate expansion of liability under the Pinkerton doctrine.

Issue:

-  Under the Pinkerton doctrine, can a co-conspirator be liable for another coconspirator's crime that was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the conspiracy, even if the crime was outside the scope of the originally intended agreement?

Holding and Reasoning (Kravitch, J.):

- Yes. Under the Pinkerton doctrine, a coconspirator can be held liable for another coconspirator's crime if it was reasonably foreseeable and within the scope of the conspiracy.
- Each coconspirator is responsible for crimes committed by others in furtherance of the conspiracy, even if their participation was minor.
- In this case, the significant amount of money involved indicated that weapons might be present, and deadly force could be used if necessary.
- Statements made by one of the coconspirators indicated a willingness to use deadly force to avoid capture.
- The murder was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the drug conspiracy, justifying the application of the Pinkerton doctrine.
- Even though the murder was not within the initial scope of the conspiracy, the defendants played significant roles in it.
- Therefore, the convictions are affirmed.
