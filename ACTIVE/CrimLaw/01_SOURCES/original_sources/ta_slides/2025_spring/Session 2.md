## Criminal Law              Session 2 {#slide-1}

## Constitutional Limits of Punishment {#slide-2}

3 considerations:

Legality: you cannot be punished for anything unless there is a law telling you that you can't do it.

Raises questions of vagueness and due process

Culpability

Proportionality

Really only relevant re: death penalty.

 Under these 3 umbrellas there is:

Fair warning

Void for vagueness

Equal protection

Retroactivity

## Legality {#slide-3}

KEELER V. SUPERIOR COURT (CA, 1970) -- MAN ASSAULTS PREGNANT EX-WIFE, CAUSES DEATH OF FETUS (QUESTION OF DUE PROCESS/FAIR WARNING)

Takeaway : Due process requires fair warning, which limits unforeseeable judicial expansion of statutory interpretation and the creation of a new offense must be sufficiently explicit to inform those who are subject to it what conduct on their part will render them liable to its penalties.

 

Facts : Man assaults ex-wife, says he's going to "stomp" the fetus out of her and shoves knee into her abdomen. Fetus was a stillborn.

 

Statute:  Penal code section 187: Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought. Mens rea: malice aforethought. Actus reus: unlawful killing of a human being.

 

Holding/Rationale:  Keeler cannot be charged with murder because a fetus is not a "human being" in the meaning of the statute. Judicial enlargement of section 187 to include feticide would not have been foreseeable and its adoption would deny defendant of due process of law.

●	187 says that no act or omission accomplished after the code has taken effect is criminal or punishable due process concern of creating a new offense.

●	Constitutional prohibition against the enactment of ex post facto laws

                                                         

Harcourt: The reasoning for fair warning requirement is that there a re some areas of badness that are worse than others, so there needs to be some gradation between homicide and feticide.

## Legality {#slide-4}

ROGERS V. TENNESSEE  (SC, 2000) --  RETROACTIVE APPLICATION OF  LAW  (QUESTION OF DUE PROCESS/FAIR WARNING)

Facts : Rogers stabbed someone who went into cardiac arrest and subsequently a coma. Died from related complications 15 months later.

Statute : Defendant could not be convicted of murder if his victim did not die within a year and a day following the defendant's act.

Holding/Rationale:  Murder conviction sustained despite common law rule that a homicide could be prosecuted as murder only if victim had died with 1 year and 1 day of defendant's acts.

- 1 year 1 day rule was viewed as an outdated relic, so it was not unexpected.
- No due process violation.

Rule : Judiciary can change common law rules and apply to case at bar if change was not 1) unexpected or 2) unjustified/indefensible. No fair issue warning if prior 2 requirements are satisfied.

•	Took medical advances into account, contra Keeler.

## Vagueness {#slide-5}

CITY OF CHICAGO V. MORALES (SC, 1999) --(QUESTION OF DUE PROCESS)

 

Facts : Chicago passed ordinance criminalized loitering. Morales was convinced under the ordinance.

Statute : Ordinance "prohibited criminal street gang members from loitering with one another or with other persons in any public space".

Cop must reasonably believe that at least 1 of the 2 or more persons present in a public place is a criminal street gang member.

Person must be loitering defined as remaining in one place with no apparent reason.

Officer must order all persons to disperse from area.

Person must disobey.

Holding/Rationale:  The ordinance violates the 14th  amendment DP clause for vagueness because it affords absolute discretion to police and too little notice to citizens of what is permitted and what is prohibited.

- Constitution does not permit legislature to set a net large enough to catch all possible offenders and leave it to the courts to step inside and say who could be rightfully detained.
-  Concern that ordinance will legitimize racial profiling-- cops trying to do something that has racial implications through a statute that seems "neutral."

Rule : Vagueness may invalidate a criminal law for 2 reasons: 1) lack of notice and 2) arbitrary enforcement

## Harcourt, The Illusion of Order {#slide-6}

- Broken windows theory-- idea that effective control of major crime requires police to enforce quality of life laws vigorously.

- Proponents of broken windows policing argue that order in the community may influence the behavior of neighborhood residents and outsiders. Policing quality of life laws may improve the quality of life/decrease serious criminal activity.

<!-- -->

- Popular position

- High misdemeanor arresting approach does not work. Data suggesting that it does is bad/poorly gathered.

## Status Crimes {#slide-7}

ROBINSON  V.  CALIFORNIA  (SC,  1962)--  STATUTE  CRIMINALIZING ADDICT  STATUS

Facts : Robinson convicted of being addicted to narcotics. Judge instructed jury they could convict solely because he was addicted to drugs.

Statute : CA statute made it illegal for someone to be addicted to drugs.

Holding/Rationale:  Statute violates 8th  amendment. Defendant did not use narcotics in the state (no actus reus)

- Criminalizing someone for being an addict is cruel and unusual  addiction calls for treatment not punishment.

Rule : Criminalizing addiction alone violates the 8th amendment.

 

Harcourt's thoughts: Maybe there was a jurisdictional issue-- unclear if this person even used drugs in CA, so in that case there would no act in CA.

- Or there was no voluntary act.
- Problems with status crimes: no actus reus; creates continual criminal liability; punishment based on unchangeable characteristic.

## Status Crimes {#slide-8}

POWELL V. TEXAS (SC, 1968)

Facts : Powell, an alcoholic, was arrested for public intoxication.

Statute : "Whoever shall get drunk or be found in a state of intoxication in any public place, or at any private house except his own, shall be fined not exceeding one hundred dollars."

Holding/Rationale:  Statute/conviction does not violate 8th  amendment. is not being punished for being an alcoholic, he is being punished for breaking the law.

- Allowing alcoholism to relieve defendant of guilt would create a new defense to criminal culpability.
- Dissent: Defendant is being punished for a state he is not in control over + could not prevent himself from appearing in public places

## Status Crimes {#slide-9}

CITY OF GRANTS PASS V. JOHNSON (SC, 2024)

- Anti-camping ordinances and the consequences of their violation does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. 
- Anti-camping ordinances are interpreted as neutrally applied and thereby does not run counter to  Robinson v. California . 
- Anti-camping ordinances are upheld regardless of its connection with homelessness as  Powell v. Texas  allows acts strongly associated with a status to be criminalized.
- Necessity defense would be more appropriate for the homeless to contest prosecution under anti-camping ordinances.
- Following  Kahler v. Kansas , whether the homeless possess the  mens  rea to violate anti-camping ordinances should be left for the government to determine.
