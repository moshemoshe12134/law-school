## Criminal Law                Session 9 {#slide-1}

## Duty to Retreat {#slide-2}

Common law	

- English common law: "strict duty to retreat; a person could use deadly force in self-defense only after exhausting every chance to flee."
- American law: "In the 19th c., American courts began rejecting the English doctrine... by the late 19th or early 20th c., the majority had adopted the 'true man' or no-retreat rule." 

Recent case law

- No retreat/SYG rule considered the majority approach.
- MPC adopts a version of this rule with some exceptions. 
- "In decisions based on common-law principles, there has been a distinct tendency to favor a requirement of retreat in settings outside the home... recently, however, many judicial decisions reaffirming the retreat requirement have been nullified by legislation." (CB)

## Duty to Retreat {#slide-3}

The castle exception	

- "In jurisdictions requiring retreat before deadly force may be used, an exception is invariably made when the defendant is attacked in his own home by an intruder." E.g., People v. Tomlins (NY CoA, 1914)
- "The great majority permit the homeowner to kill \[a guest\] in self-defense" without having a duty to retreat.
- Co-occupants: Most recent decisions support right of homeowner to kill co-occupant in self-defense without having a duty to retreat 

## Stand Your Ground Laws {#slide-4}

Basic idea:  

- Even if you can retreat, you've no duty to do so. You can stay and meet force w/ force (even deadly force)
- Erodes the necessity requirement for self-defense

Other features:

- Presumption that a person using deadly force while in her home or vehicle had a reasonable fear of imminent death
- Immunity from both civil & criminal liability if killer was justified  

Procedural consequences: 

- Police cannot arrest killer unless they determine there is probable cause the force used as unlawful
- The burden shift makes it difficult to demonstrate that defendant stood ground unlawfully

## Critique of Stand Your Ground Laws {#slide-5}

- Increases homicide rate by excusing unnecessary killings; will increase vigilantism; will increase danger of fatal mistakes (often prompted by racial prejudice)
- ABA report (2015):  SYG laws "have no deterrent effect on violent crimes... Rather the evidence tells a story of mounting problems with the implementation of these laws and unintended, negative implications for racial and ethnic minorities, law enforcement, the criminal justice system, and public safety."
- Great potential for racial bias (see above)

## State v. Zimmerman {#slide-6}

Facts:

- Trayvon Martin was walking at night with a hoodie on
- Zimmerman thought Trayvon looked "real suspicious," "Black," and "like he was on drugs or something" so called 911, wanting officers to come fast because "these assholes, they always get away"
- Zimmerman followed Trayvon, though the dispatcher said "we don't need you to do that"
- Zimmerman claims Trayvon punched him in the nose when Zimmerman approached him

Charges:

- 2nd degree murder: death caused by act done with depraved mind (knowing, purposeful, or reckless)
- Manslaughter: death caused by intentional act -- not clear whether negligence is enough to convict

Procedural posture:  Stand Your Ground delayed arrest -- Zimmerman waived his right to immunity hearing (776.032)

- Zimmerman could have had immunity - "justified and is immune . . . unless force is used against law enforcement officer" UNLESS probable cause (a big hurdle in stand your ground jurisdiction) that force they used was unlawful

Rules used: Chapter 776: Justifiable Use of Force

- 776.012
- 776.041: Provocation

## Self Defense Provisions used in Zimmerman {#slide-7}

- 776.012:\... A person is justified in the use of deadly force and does not have a duty to retreat if:

<!-- -->

- (1) He or she  reasonably believes  that such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the imminent commission of a forcible felony; OR

<!-- -->

- 776.041: The justification described in the preceding sections of this chapter is not available to a person who:

<!-- -->

- (1)  Is attempting to commit, committing, or escaping after the commission of, a forcible felony; or

<!-- -->

- \[Zimmerman would not be able to claim self defense if jury found he was engaged in a forcible felony\]

<!-- -->

- (2)  Initially provokes the use of force  against himself or herself,  UNLESS :

<!-- -->

- (a) Such force is so great that the person reasonably believes that he or she is in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm AND that he or she has exhausted every reasonable means to escape such danger other than the use of force which is likely to cause death or great bodily harm to the assailant; OR

<!-- -->

- \[If jury found Zimmerman provoked, jury must find he exhausted every other reasonable means to escape to justify his use of deadly force\]

<!-- -->

- (b) ln good faith, the person withdraws from physical contact with the assailant and indicates clearly to the assailant that he or she desires to withdraw and terminate the use of force, but the assailant continues or resumes the use of force.

## Zimmerman cont. {#slide-8}

- Zimmerman's defense: he had a reasonable belief that deadly force was necessary to prevent great bodily harm
- Holding: acquitted b/c self-defense

<!-- -->

- What did the jury have to find to make this decision?

<!-- -->

- That Zimmerman reasonably believed there was an imminent risk
- If Zimmerman was the instigator: that he exhausted all other means to escape such danger

## Law Enforcement Use of Lethal Force {#slide-9}

Section 3.07. Use of Force in Law Enforcement.

  (1) Use of Force Justifiable to Effect an Arrest.  Subject to the provisions of this Section and of Section 3.09, the use of force upon or toward the person of another is justifiable when the actor is making or assisting in making an arrest and the actor  believes  that such force is immediately necessary to effect a lawful arrest.

  (2) Limitations on the Use of Force.

    (a) The use of force is not justifiable under this Section unless:

      (i) the actor makes known the purpose of the arrest or believes that it is otherwise known by or cannot reasonably be made known to the person to be arrested;  and

      (ii) when the arrest is made under a warrant, the warrant is valid or believed by the actor to be valid.

    (b) The use of deadly force is not justifiable under this Section unless:

      (i) the arrest is for a felony;  and

      (ii) the person effecting the arrest is authorized to act as a peace officer or is assisting a person whom he believes to be authorized to act as a peace officer; 

- Subjective standard 

## Mistake of Lethal Force {#slide-10}

Section 3.09. Mistake of Law as to Unlawfulness of Force or Legality of Arrest;  Reckless or Negligent Use of Otherwise Justifiable Force;  Reckless or Negligent Injury or Risk of Injury to Innocent Persons.

  (1) The justification afforded by Sections 3.04 to 3.07, inclusive, is unavailable when:

    (a) the actor\'s belief in the unlawfulness of the force or conduct against which he employs protective force or his belief in the lawfulness of an arrest which he endeavors to effect by force is  erroneous ;  and

    (b) his error is  due to ignorance or mistake  as to the provisions of the Code, any other provision of the criminal law or the law governing the legality of an arrest or search.

- If defendant satisfies (a) and (b),  they can't claim self defense  
- 3.09(1) is for law enforcement, 3.09(2) is for any defendant 

## Section 3.09 Cont. {#slide-11}

   (2) When the actor believes that the use of force upon or toward the person of another is necessary for any of the purposes for which such belief would establish a justification under Sections 3.03 to 3.08 but the actor is reckless or negligent in having such belief or in acquiring or failing to acquire any knowledge or belief which is material to the justifiability of his use of force, the justification afforded by those Sections is unavailable in a prosecution for an offense for which recklessness or negligence, as the case may be, suffices to establish culpability.

- If reckless/negligent in forming belief that you need force for self-defense, then you can be prosecuted for an offense for which recklessness/negligence satisfies requisite  mens rea  

  (3) When the actor is justified under Sections 3.03 to 3.08 in using force upon or toward the person of another but he recklessly or negligently injures or creates a risk of injury to innocent persons, the justification afforded by those Sections is unavailable in a prosecution for such recklessness or negligence towards innocent persons.

- Use 3.09 when you want to challenge use of force (reckless/negligent belief)
- While 3.04 is purely subjective, 3.09 brings in objectivity with reckless/negligent language 
- Focus on time framing to determine when reasonableness ends (when lethal force is no longer necessary i.e. Goetz case → he could have stopped shooting is what the prosecution will say)

## NY Penal Law 35.30.1  {#slide-12}

Difference between MPC 3.07? Adds objectivity with "reasonably believes" language 

- A police officer or a peace officer,  in the course of effecting or attempting to effect an arrest, or of preventing or attempting to  prevent the escape from custody , of a person whom he or she  reasonably believes  to have committed an offense, may use physical force when and  to the extent he or she  reasonably believes  such to be  necessary   to effect the arrest, or to prevent  the  escape  from  custody, or in self-defense or to defend a third person from what he or she  reasonably believes  to be the use or  imminent  use of physical force;

<!-- -->

- EXCEPT that  deadly physical force may be used for such purposes  ONLY   when the officer  reasonably believes  that:

<!-- -->

- (a) The offense committed by such person was:

<!-- -->

- (i) a felony or an attempt to commit a felony involving the use or attempted use or threatened imminent use of physical force against a person; OR
- (ii) kidnapping, arson, escape in the first degree, burglary in the first degree or any attempt to commit such a crime; OR

<!-- -->

- (b) The offense committed or attempted by such person was a felony and that, in the course of resisting arrest therefore or attempting to escape from custody, such person is  armed with a firearm or deadly weapon ; OR
- (c) Regardless of the particular offense which is the subject of the arrest or attempted  escape, the  use of deadly  physical force is necessary to defend the police officer or peace officer or another person  from what the officer   reasonably believes  to be the use or imminent use of deadly physical force.
