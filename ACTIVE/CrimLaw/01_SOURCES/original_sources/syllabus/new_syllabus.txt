COURSE OUTLINE

This course explores major problems of the criminal law and of its administration. The
definitions of crimes and defenses will be considered in light of the purposes of punishment, the
functions of the criminal justice system, and the role of the criminal sanction in modern society.
Special attention will be paid to the intersection of criminal law with criminology, jurisprudence,
and social theory.
This course focuses on the substantive rather than the procedural rules of criminal law. We
will study the structure of the criminal justice system, the statutory definitions of crimes, as well
as defenses and justifications, and the rules of complicity, conspiracy, and attempt. More
specifically, in terms of the substantive rules of criminal law, we will explore the distinctions
between the constitutional and statutory dimensions of the criminal law, discuss the general

Syllabus: Criminal Law (Harcourt)

requirements for criminal conduct, and cover the law of specific crimes (homicide and rape). We
will also learn about theories of justification and excuse, such as self-defense, duress, necessity,
and the insanity defense. We will explore how criminal liability can be expanded beyond the actual
commission of a crime to include attempts, accomplice liability, and conspiracies. We will also
explore criminal law and punishment theory and criminology. We will read and discuss some of
the major theoretical contributions in the area of criminal law, from critical theory, law &
economics, and other traditions. We will also learn about actual practice— from both the
prosecution and defense sides.
Criminal law is distinct from criminal procedure, whether constitutional (e.g., Fourth, Fifth,
Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteen Amendments) or statutory (e.g., Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure).
Thus, we will not be covering the legal rules concerning the investigation of crimes—searches and
seizures, interrogations, right to counsel—nor the rules concerning pretrial and trial procedures.
Those are covered in later courses called “Criminal Procedure.” Naturally, at various junctures,
we will explore the relationship between substantive criminal law and criminal procedure. But our
focus will be on the statutory law of crimes: what are the elements of homicide or rape? How do
capital sentencing statutes work? This course will provide the necessary foundation for more
advanced research in federal criminal law, white collar crime, sentencing, or capital punishment.
ASSIGNMENTS
There will be daily reading assignments.
The casebook for the course is Kadish, Schulhofer & Barkow, Criminal Law and Its
Processes. You may use either the 9th edition from 2012, or the 10th edition from 2017, or the
11th edition from 2022. Any edition is fine! The older ones are cheaper. I will provide page numbers
for all of them. So please buy or rent or steal the least expensive one.
The Model Penal Code is reprinted in the Appendix of the book; read carefully any Model
Penal Code sections referred to in the reading assignments.
I would also like you to please read Bryan Stevenson’s Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and
Redemption (New York: Spiegel & Grau, 2014) and Michel Foucault’s Discipline and Punish:
The Birth of the Prison (New York: Vintage Books, 1977). The books are on reserve in the Law
Library and available at Book Culture and other book stores.
I will also make available supplementary materials (“Supp.”) on Courseworks and via links
on the Internet, some of which are required course readings and some of which are optional.

GETTING READY FOR FIRST CLASS
During the winter break before the semester starts, I would like to ask you to read two
books in preparation for our Criminal Law class. It would be wonderful if you started over the
winter break so that it is not too overwhelming when the semester gets going.
The first book is Bryan Stevenson’s Just Mercy. A Story of Justice and Redemption (New
York: Spiegel & Grau, 2014). Stevenson’s book will give you some context about the field that
we will be studying: the criminal legal ordeal. Please pay attention to the story of Walter McMillian
of course, who was wrongfully convicted and sentenced to death. (He was actually placed on death
row at Holman Prison in Atmore, Alabama, as a form of pre-trial detention, if you can possibly
believe that). But also, please pay attention to the other chapters that are dedicated to other issues
such as the punishment of children, the treatment of women and mothers, and other chronic
problems with our legal process. Please read Just Mercy in time for our first class on Tuesday
morning.
The second book is Michel Foucault’s Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison (New
York: Vintage Books, 1977). We will be reading Foucault’s book over the course of the semester,
but it would be good if you got a head start. The book is actually very straightforward, although
people always say it is dense. It is a book about three periods: a before (the brutal corporal
punishments and ordeals of the 17th and 18th centuries, like the execution of Damiens), a transition
(the penal reformers of the Enlightenment who thought up theatres of punishment), and an after,
the modern period (the birth of the prison and disciplinary mechanisms of punishment, like
juvenile detention centers and penitentiaries, and the routinized timetables and orderings of
modernity). The book is about the birth of that third style of punishing, disciplinary punishment,
and it ends in 1840 with the opening of a famous juvenile home called Mettray. This book will be
a point of reference throughout the course because it reveals the function of punishment: what we
do and achieve, as a society, through the criminal legal process. For those of you who are
unfamiliar with Foucault’s work or feel intimidated, you might want to listen to this lecture I
delivered to explain the book to instructors in the Core program here at Columbia who teach it to
all our undergraduates: https://youtu.be/-QJ-xMd9XsY?si=AvnMlx1SODs2J7in
I would also like to ask you to familiarize yourself with a death penalty case that I am
working on. It involves a young man named David Wilson. You can read about his case and read
the pleadings in his case here: https://cccct.law.columbia.edu/content/david-wilson-vs-jeffersons-dunn. We will be discussing David Wilson’s case at various points during the semester, so it
would be good for you to familiarize yourself with it ahead of time.
One final thing. If you are in New York City between now and when class starts, I would
highly recommend going down to the Manhattan Criminal Courthouse at 100 Centre Street. (Yes,
you know that courthouse, it is the one where President Donald Trump was tried and convicted of
3

Syllabus: Criminal Law (Harcourt)
…………………………………………………………………………………………………..
Spring 2026
34 felony counts, with the marble walls and cavernous look in the news.) You can actually head
down there any day of the week, even weekends, enter as a member of the public, and go watch
arraignments on the first floor (after the metal detectors, it’s the AR rooms to the right in the back;
arraignments are 9am to 1pm and 2pm to 5pm; there are also arraignments at night till 1 am, but
during those day times there will definitely be arraignments you can watch). Or, you can head up
to the Clerk’s Office on the 10th Floor of the courthouse, and there you will find a whiteboard with
all the day’s trials listed on it. You can then proceed to the courtroom, silence your cellphone, and
watch a trial. I highly recommend this. It is a true learning experience and eye opener.
REQUIREMENTS
Students are expected to read each day’s assigned material prior to class and should be
prepared to be called upon to answer questions and/or offer comments to facilitate class discussion.
If a student is unable to attend, that student should e-mail my assistant, Ricardo Orlando Lombera
(rl3343@columbia.edu), by 8:00 a.m. of the class day.
The reading assignments on this syllabus are meant to take roughly (but only roughly) one
day of class time to complete. We will occasionally run over, but if you prepare one assignment
for each class day, you will never fall behind.
The final exam will be an in-class, open-book, no-Internet, three-hour examination.
Professor Harcourt will hold office hours on Thursdays from 1:30 – 3:00 p.m. Please
contact his assistant, Ricardo Orlando Lombera (rl3343@columbia.edu), to schedule an
appointment. Office hours are by appointment only.
GOING TO COURT
As noted earlier, it is possible to go watch trials in criminal court. I
would encourage you to do that if you have a free moment. If you are
interested and have the time, you should head downtown to the New
York County (that’s Manhattan) criminal courthouse at 100 Centre
Street, near Foley Square, go through the metal detectors and security
downstairs, and head up to the Clerk's Office on the 10th Floor of the
courthouse. There, you will find a whiteboard with all the day’s trials
listed on it. You can then proceed to the courtroom and silence your
cellphone. I attach a photo of the white board in the clerk’s office here
so you get an idea of what it looks like.

SCHEDULE
Most every week, we will only meet on the regular Tuesday and Thursday slots. The Friday
slots are for make-ups. HOWEVER, on three occasions we will meet on the Friday slot (so three
times, on January 23, January 30, and February 13, 2026) so that we get a little intense start on
criminal law and also so that we will not have any class the week of March 23, 2026. So effectively,
you will have 2 weeks off for Spring Break.
Please do keep an eye on the day/date on the syllabus so you follow all this. Thanks!
STATEMENT REGARDING ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
Each student in this course is expected to abide by the Columbia University Code of
Academic Integrity. Any work submitted by a student in this course for academic credit must be
the student’s own work. The complete Faculty Statement on Academic Integrity can be found at:
https://faculty-resources.law.columbia.edu/content/academic-integrity
STATEMENT REGARDING ACADEMIC FREEDOM
The classroom is a space of academic freedom where every student should feel free to
explore ideas and research with an open mind and without any constraints. There will be no
censoring of ideas or research in our classroom or course readings, although everyone should be
attentive not to emotionally harm, injure, or trigger any of our classmates in our discussions. I will
not be modifying my course in any way that would restrict our free exchange of ideas. In order to
create a free space for ideas and research, no student is allowed to tape or video other persons in
the classroom and no one is allowed to share our classroom discussions outside of the classroom
or on social media. Students may not share AV recordings made by CLS for purposes of
accommodations with anyone. Any violations of this will be considered a violation of the honor
code and will be enforced.
CREATING A POSITIVE THINKING SPACE
Please be mindful of helping to create a positive thinking and working environment to
make sure that everyone can contribute. If you are the kind of person who doesn’t talk much,
please do speak up because it’s good training for life. If you are the kind of person who speaks
often, try to create a space for others to share. There are usually a lot of dynamics that you should
be aware of by now that play out in the classroom. Let’s work together to minimize their negative
impact. This means especially being aware of the impact you are having on others’ ability to
contribute.

POLICY STATEMENT ABOUT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
The final exam is closed to the internet and to any search engines. You will be allowed to
use your laptop, but there will be exam software that will not allow you to search the internet. As
a result, you will not be using artificial intelligence for the examination, and are not allowed to.
Given that, I recommend that you do not use artificial intelligence to summarize or digest
your readings, or to prepare outlines. I sincerely believe you will be better prepared for the final
examination if you do all your own work independently of artificial intelligence.
DISABILITY STATEMENT
Columbia Law School is committed to the full inclusion of students with disabilities in the
life of the University. In accordance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments
Act (ADAAA), CLS provides accommodations and supports to students with documented
disabilities on an individual, case-by-case basis. To request disability accommodations for this
course, students must first be registered with Disability Services (DS).
Detailed information is available online (https://health.columbia.edu/content/disabilityservices) regarding the registration process, drop-in hours schedule, documentation requirements
and important deadlines. Please allow for at least three weeks to complete the DS registration
process. If you have already registered with DS, please contact the CLS DS liaison: Lauren Levy,
Associate Director of Academic Counseling and Student Support, ll3686@columbia.edu.
BASIC NEEDS AND SECURITY
Any student who faces challenges securing their basic needs and security that may affect their
performance in this course is encouraged to contact me if you are comfortable doing so, and we
can work with the Dean of Students to assist you in accessing resources. We are here for you.

READING ASSIGNMENTS
I.

INTRODUCTION

Criminal law, more than any other field in your legal education, will make you confront the
political dimension of the law and the many forms of injustice in contemporary American society.
In Black Reconstruction in America, W.E.B. Du Bois documented how the criminal law and its
enforcement was used, after the abolition of slavery, as the main device to recreate a social order
of racial domination. Du Bois described convict leasing and plantation prisons as a new form of
slavery. The history and development of the criminal law in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries
is best understood through that lens. We will begin to explore this in the introduction to the course.
A. Criminal Law and Justice

[#1 – TUESDAY, JANUARY 20, 2026]

How do we define justice for purpose of “criminal justice”? How do you define “justice”? In our
first class, we will ask ourselves this question and, hopefully, each one of you will come up with
a definition of justice that will guide your learning of the criminal law this semester.
Readings:
Bryan Stevenson, Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption (New York:
Penguin, 2014)
Supp. Peter Applebome, “Alabama Releases Man Held on Death Row for Six
Years,” New York Times, March 3, 1993
Optional: Please feel free to view the 60-Minutes segment on Walter McMillian’s
case that is available on the EJI website here: https://eji.org/walter-mcmillian
B. Overview of the Criminal Justice Process
We will also take an overview the criminal legal process, including arraignments, grand juries,
through the trial and appeal.

“The Criminal Trial Process in New York State”

As you read Just Mercy, please think about these questions:
1. What is the fact or phenomenon in Just Mercy that you find the most unjust of all the
injustices? What was the moment, reading the book, that you felt most upset by what
was happening?
2. What is the idea of “just mercy” that you think Bryan Stevenson is trying to
communicate in his book? Is it about “mercy”? Is it about “justice”? Does the “just” in
the expression “just mercy” mean “simply” or is it connected to the idea of justice?
3. What would be your greatest criticism of the book, Just Mercy? Is there anything about
it that you found problematic or that you would want to resist?
4. How would you define “justice”? Has this book helped you to define justice for
yourself? Please write down your own definition of justice in one sentence. I will ask
you to come back to that definition over the course of the semester.
II.

THE ELEMENTS OF CRIMINAL LAW

In this first part, we will learn the basic elements—the building blocks—of the criminal law: the
act requirement (actus reus) and the requirement regarding a mental state (mens rea). These
elements are essential to defining crimes and they generally represent the core elements that a jury
must find in order to return a conviction of guilt. Understanding how to mix and match elements
is a basic tool for criminal lawyers. It is also what makes the criminal law so malleable—despite
the universal character of “crimes.”
Some of you may work better with visuals and graphics, others with narrative, others with laundry
lists. Whatever works best for you, can you find a way to model how these elements go together
in a manner that would allow you to communicate best to a jury what elements they need to find
in order to convict or acquit? Try using a chart, a list, a drawing, words, or a paragraph—whatever
works best for you—to start mapping out what elements are required to convict or acquit.
Critical Legal Studies (“CLS”) was a movement in the 1970s that has been absorbed for the most
part in ordinary legal reasoning today. It was a reiteration of American Legal Realism (19201930s), in response to a revival of positivism in law (for instance, in the Law and Economics
movement of the 1960s). Today, most practicing lawyers are “crits,” even if they do not know
what that means. Most lawyers, in fact all practicing lawyers worth their salt, will ply the law in
their client’s direction. We will read excerpts from two CLS articles as a way to better understand
how lawyers can play with the elements of criminal law. This is what creates the utter flexibility
in the criminal law.

Please read Supp. Jack Balkin, “The Crystalline Structure of Legal Thought,” 39
Rutgers Law Review 1 (1986), pages 2 to 13 (and quickly peruse the rest).
As you read these materials, please think about these questions:
1. How would you best model the elements requirements and how they interact? In
other words, how the various act requirements in a statute interact with the mens
rea requirement and attendant circumstances? Can you come up with a system to
clearly model the requirements of a statute?
2. How do the Model Penal Code provisions you read provide some guidance on
how to interpret criminal statutes when there are gaps, silences, or ambiguities?
3. When you read these cases, can you find the most compelling ways to argue for
both sides? Do any of these relate to Kelman’s notion of frames or interpretive
constructs?
4. As you read the arguments in these cases, can you start making a list of the
recurring arguments? Does Balkin help to create an exhaustive catalogue of
typical legal arguments? What does “typical legal arguments” mean?
III.

THE LAW OF HOMICIDE
The law of homicide is all about the gradation of culpability and blameworthiness. Homicide
itself is easily defined: causing someone’s death. The intricacy, then, is all in the gradations
and levels of culpability. Also in the defenses (justifications or excuses) to causing death, but
we will discuss those later in the course, when we get to legal defenses (such as self-defense
or police use of lethal force).
In this part of the course, we will be focusing on how a criminal behavior (taking someone’s
life) can be treated differently based on gradations that reflect moral judgments about the
blameworthiness of a person, judgments that are unique to our culture and times.
Throughout our discussion of the law of homicide, we will be navigating between the
following categories, and so it will be helpful if you keep this schema in mind as we do. As
you will see, the borders and movement between them speak loudly about our culture and
relations of power in society:

As you read these materials on homicide, I would like you to be thinking about them at two
levels. The first is the technical, legal level of mapping out the elements of homicide in each
of these cases and in each of the statutes. Ask yourself:
•
•
•
•

What are the element requirements necessary to convict?
How do the mens rea elements attach to the different act requirements?
Can you map this out in a way that will let you easily write the jury instructions?
Write a jury instruction for any of these cases.

The second is the theoretical level regarding the judgments that are hidden in these different
rules and gradations. Here I would like you to ask yourself:
•
•
•

What does it mean for a legal code to reveal something about our culture?
What do these cases and codes actually expose about our moral judgements?
How are those moral judgements hidden in these cases and codes? Are they?

By way of update on the case involving Mr. Sandik Baxter:
Mr. Baxter, represented by Attorneys David Gillis (The Law Offices of David J. Gillis)
and Krista Dolan (Southern Poverty Law Center), filed a separate motion for postconviction relief in Florida state court based on newly-discovered evidence. In October
2025, in connection with that proceeding, Mr. Baxter accepted a negotiated plea agreement
with the State of Florida that vacated his first-degree felony-murder convictions and
mandatory life-without-parole sentences. In exchange, Mr. Baxter agreed to withdraw his
federal appeal and plead no contest to second-degree murder with a term-of-years sentence
that sets his release for 2029. This outcome represents a significant and transformative
victory, as it ensures that Mr. Baxter—originally sentenced to die in prison—will now be
reunited with his family and loved ones at age 42.

1. What are the dimensions along which the cases always seem to resolve? Is there
something about the awareness by the defendant? Something about the level of risk?
Something about the amount of care demonstrated?

and whether they make sense, or whether you would propose a different system?

need to determine in order to decide on likely guilt or innocence?
3. What do you think is really going on with causation and how might it relate to the cultural
interpretation of criminal law?

THE CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITS OF PUNISHMENT

In addition to statutory requirements, which are of course really important because Criminal Law
is one of your only mainly statutory fields, there are also constitutional limitations on what can
be defined and prosecuted as a crime. In this part, we will explore the constitutional limits on
punishment.

SEXUAL ASSAULT

This week, we will read and discuss the law of sexual assault. It is an area of the law that is
extremely important, but may be difficult for some of you because of your personal experiences. I
try to keep the discussion as legal and professional as possible to avoid the possibility of triggering.
18

Syllabus: Criminal Law (Harcourt)
…………………………………………………………………………………………………..
Spring 2026
I tend to focus on the legal elements of a sexual assault charge to show the way in which changes
over time regarding one element (for example, consent) will cause changes regarding other
elements (for instance, mens rea), in order to show how elements of a charge are interrelated and
can change over time. Sexual assault law is unique in this respect and therefore allows for a
demonstration of how law evolves and elements change over time. I use a table of possible
definitions of elements, which I will refer to throughout our discussion, and which I attach here as
well:

Notes on Absence of Consent

New York Penal Law, especially §130.05 on consent and §130.25; see here:
http://ypdcrime.com/penal.law/article130.htm#p130.05
http://ypdcrime.com/penal.law/article130.htm#p130.05
As noted above, I try to stay focused on the legal doctrine so as to avoid triggering anyone.
Sometimes that feels as if I am focusing too much on the legal elements, actus reus and mens rea
for instance, and not using the materials sufficiently to discuss critical issues of consent discourse,
issues of closure, redress, healing, issues of gender and race, and broader issues of the legal
framework that allows rape culture to thrive.

Syllabus: Criminal Law (Harcourt)
…………………………………………………………………………………………………..
Spring 2026
So as you read and as we discuss the legal issues, I hope that you will also be thinking about, and
that we might address during the class time, the following issues:
1. Has the evolution of sexual assault law moved the legal framework in a positive
direction, even if not fully? In other words, has legal transformation been helpful at all?
2. Does the legal framework shape the cultural framework, or the other way around, and if
the latter, then how should we approach the law and legal transformation?
3. Do you think that the law is the right vehicle to provide closure, protection, redress, or
healing to victims, especially those who have been victimized more, such as LGBTQ
persons, women, persons of color, and other minorities?
4. Is the law and legal practice a part of challenging the cultural framework within which
sexual assault continues to thrive?

VIII. CONCLUSION TO PART I
What We Criminalize: Criminal Law and Morality

[#18 – TUESDAY, MARCH 10, 2026]

How do we decide what to criminalize? Does it rest on our moral principles? Can we criminalize
behaviors because they offend our moral principles? Is there contingency in what we punish?

MPC 3.04 and 3.09
We will be focusing on the Bernie Goetz case. One of the main issues is where to
place the self-defense standard on the spectrum from objective (reasonable belief
in the need to defend oneself) to subjective (subjective belief in the need to defend
oneself); and how that relates to racial justice.
