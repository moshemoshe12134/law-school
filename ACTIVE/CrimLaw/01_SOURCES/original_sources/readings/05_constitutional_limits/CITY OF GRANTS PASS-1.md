*CITY OF GRANTS PASS v. JOHNSON*---Decided June 28, 2024

JUSTICE GORSUCH delivered the opinion of the Court.

Many cities across the American West face a homelessness crisis. . . .

I A

. . . According to the federal government, homelessness in this country
has reached its highest levels since the government began reporting data
on the subject in 2007. . . .

As the number of homeless individuals has grown, the number of homeless
encampments across the country has increased as well, "in numbers not
seen in almost a century." Ibid. The unsheltered may coalesce in these
encampments for a range of reasons. Some value the "freedom" encampment
living provides compared with submitting to the rules shelters impose.
\[Citations omitted here and below.\] Others report that encampments
offer a "sense of community." And still others may seek them out for
"dependable access to illegal drugs." . . . As the number and size of
these encampments have grown, so have the challenges they can pose for
the homeless and others. We are told, for example, that the "exponential
increase in . . . encampments in recent years has resulted in an
increase in crimes both against the homeless and by the homeless." . . .

. . . The . . . unsheltered sometimes reject offers of assistance \[for
reasons that are\] many and complex. . . .

Rather than focus on a single policy to meet the challenges associated
with homelessness, many States and cities have pursued a range of
policies and programs \[including \] expanding shelter and affordable
housing opportunities, . . reinvest\[ing\] in mental-health and
substance-abuse treatment programs . . . train\[ing\] employees in
outreach tactics \[and\] pair\[ing\] these efforts with the enforcement
of laws that restrict camping in public places, like parks, streets, and
sidewalks. . . . By one count, "a majority of cities have laws
restricting camping in public spaces," and nearly forty percent "have
one or more laws prohibiting camping citywide.". . . .

Five years ago, the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit took
one of those tools off the table. In Martin v. Boise, 920 F. 3d 584
(2019), that court considered a public-camping ordinance in Boise,
Idaho, that made it a misdemeanor to use "streets, sidewalks, parks, or
public places" for "camping." Id., at 603 (internal quotation marks
omitted). According to the Ninth Circuit, the Eighth Amendment's Cruel
and Unusual Punishments Clause barred Boise from enforcing its
public-camping ordinance against homeless individuals who lacked "access
to alternative shelter." Id., at 615. That "access" was lacking, the
court said, whenever "'there is a greater number of homeless individuals
in a jurisdiction than the number of available beds in shelters.'" Id.,
at 617 (alterations omitted). . . .

No other circuit has followed Martin's lead with respect to
public-camping laws. . . .

Many cities . . . report that, rather than help alleviate the
homelessness crisis, *Martin* injunctions have inadvertently contributed
to it. The numbers of "\[u\]nsheltered homelessness," they represent,
have "increased dramatically in the Ninth Circuit since *Martin*." And,
they say, *Martin* injunctions have contributed to this trend by
"weaken\[ing\]" the ability of public officials "to persuade persons
experiencing homelessness to accept shelter beds and \[other\]
services." . . .

Like many American cities, Grants Pass has laws restricting camping in
public spaces. Three are relevant here. The first prohibits sleeping "on
public sidewalks, streets, or alleyways." The second prohibits
"\[c\]amping" on public property. Camping is defined as "set\[ting\] up
. . . or remain\[ing\] in or at a campsite," and a "\[c\]ampsite" is
defined as "any place where bedding, sleeping bag\[s\], or other
material used for bedding purposes, or any stove or fire is placed . . .
for the purpose of maintaining a temporary place to live." The third
prohibits "\[c\]amping" and "\[o\]vernight parking" in the city's parks.
Penalties for violating these ordinances escalate stepwise. An initial
violation may trigger a fine. Those who receive multiple citations may
be subject to an order barring them from city parks for 30 days. And, in
turn, violations of those orders can constitute criminal trespass,
punishable by a maximum of 30 days in prison and a \$1,250 fine. . . .

\[S\]hortly after the panel decision in *Martin*, two homeless
individuals, Gloria Johnson and John Logan, filed suit challenging the
city's public-camping laws claim\[ing\], among other things, that the
city's ordinances violated the Eighth Amendment's Cruel and Unusual
Punishments Clause. . . .

The district court . . . found \[that\] everyone without shelter in
Grants Pass was "involuntarily homeless" because the city's total
homeless population outnumbered its "'practically available'" shelter
beds. . . .

A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed in relevant part. 72 F.
4th, at 874--896. . . .

.

[\[T\]he Eighth Amendment's prohibition against "cruel and unusual
punishments" . . . \[is\] directed at the method or kind of punishment"
a government may "impos\[e\] for the violation of criminal statutes."
Powell v. Texas, 392 U. S. 514, 531--532 (1968) (plurality
opinion).]{.mark}

[. . . In the 18th century, English law still "formally tolerated"
certain barbaric punishments like "disemboweling, quartering, public
dissection, and burning alive," even though those practices had by then
"fallen into disuse." Bucklew v. Precythe, 587 U. S. 119, 130 (2019)
(citing 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 370 (1769)
(Blackstone)). The Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause was adopted to
ensure that the new Nation would never resort to any of those
punishments or others like them. Punishments like those were "cruel"
because they were calculated to "'superad\[d\]'" "'terror, pain, or
disgrace.'" 587 U. S., at 130 (quoting 4 Blackstone 370). And they were
"unusual" because, by the time of the Amendment's adoption, they had
"long fallen out of use." 587 U. S., at 130. . . . *\[NOTE: This passage
seems innocuous but has important implications for the meaning of the
Eighth Amendment that are addressed in Justice Thomas' concurring
opinion below*. *We* *will discuss the issue later in the semester in
connection with the death penalty.\]*]{.mark}

All that would seem to make the Eighth Amendment a poor foundation on
which to rest the kind of decree the plaintiffs seek in this case and
the Ninth Circuit has endorsed since *Martin*. The Cruel and Unusual
Punishments Clause focuses on the question what "method or kind of
punishment" a government may impose after a criminal conviction, not on
the question whether a government may criminalize particular behavior in
the first place or how it may go about securing a conviction for that
offense. . . . Nor, focusing on the criminal punishments Grant Pass
imposes \[fines, orders banning camping in public, and 30 days in jail
and a larger fine for repeat offenders who violate such a ban\] can we
say they qualify as cruel and unusual. . . . punishment'". . . .

In Robinson v. California, 370 U. S. 660 (1962), the plaintiffs and the
dissent observe, this Court addressed a challenge to a criminal
conviction under a California statute providing that "'\[n\]o person
shall . . . be addicted to the use of narcotics.'". In response to that
challenge, the Court invoked the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause to
hold that California could not enforce its law making "the 'status' of
narcotic addiction a criminal offense." The Court recognized that
"imprisonment for ninety days is not, in the abstract, a punishment
which is either cruel or unusual." But, the Court reasoned, when
punishing "'status,'" "\[e\]ven one day in prison would be . . . cruel
and unusual."

In doing so, the Court stressed the limits of its decision. It would
have ruled differently, the Court said, if California had sought to
convict the defendant for, say, the knowing or intentional "use of
narcotics, for their purchase, sale, or possession, or for antisocial or
disorderly behavior resulting from their administration." . . . The only
problem, as the Court saw it, was that California's law . . . made the
mere status of being an addict a crime. . . . .

. . . . \[T\]he Court . . . read\[\] the Cruel and Unusual Punishments
Clause to impose a limit not just on what punishments may follow a
criminal conviction but what a State may criminalize to begin with. . .
. In dissent, Justice White lamented that the majority had embraced an
"application of 'cruel and unusual punishment' so novel that" it could
not possibly be "ascribe\[d\] to the Framers of the Constitution." 370
U. S., at 689. Nor, in the 62 years since *Robinson*, has this Court
once invoked it as authority to decline the enforcement of any criminal
law, leaving the Eighth Amendment instead to perform its traditional
function of addressing the punishments that follow a criminal
conviction.

Still, no one has asked us to reconsider *Robinson*. Nor do we see any
need to do so today. Whatever its persuasive force as an interpretation
of the Eighth Amendment, it cannot sustain the Ninth Circuit's course
since *Martin*. In *Robinson*, the Court expressly recognized the "broad
power" States enjoy over the substance of their criminal laws, stressing
that they may criminalize knowing or intentional drug use even by those
suffering from addiction. 370 U. S., at 664, 666. The Court held only
that a State may not criminalize the "'status'" of being an addict. . .
.

Public camping ordinances like those before us are nothing like the law
at issue in Robinson. Rather than criminalize mere status, Grants Pass
forbids actions like "occupy\[ing\] a campsite" on public property "for
the purpose of maintaining a temporary place to live." Grants Pass
Municipal Code §§5.61.030, 5.61.010; App. to Pet. for Cert. 221a--222a.
Under the city's laws, it makes no difference whether the charged
defendant is homeless, a backpacker on vacation passing through town, or
a student who abandons his dorm room to camp out in protest on the lawn
of a municipal building. . . .

If *Robinson* does not control this case, the plaintiffs and the dissent
argue, we should extend it so that it does. Perhaps a person does not
violate ordinances like Grants Pass's simply by being homeless but only
by engaging in certain acts with certain mental states. Still, the
plaintiffs and the dissent insist, laws like these seek to regulate
actions that are in some sense "involuntary," for some homeless persons
cannot help but do what the law forbids. And, the plaintiffs and the
dissent continue, we should extend *Robinson* to prohibit the
enforcement of laws that operate this way--- laws that don't proscribe
status as such but that proscribe acts, even acts undertaken with some
required mental state, the defendant cannot help but undertake. To rule
otherwise, the argument goes, would "'effectively'" allow cities to
punish a person because of his status. . . .

The problem is, this Court has already rejected that view. In Powell v.
Texas, 392 U. S. 514 (1968), the Court confronted a defendant who had
been convicted under a Texas statute making it a crime to "'get drunk or
be found in a state of intoxication in any public place.'" Id., at 517
(plurality opinion). Like the plaintiffs here, Mr. Powell argued that
his drunkenness was an "'involuntary'" byproduct of his status as an
alcoholic. Yes, the statute required proof of an act (becoming drunk or
intoxicated and then proceeding into public), and perhaps some
associated mental state (for presumably the defendant knew he was
drinking and maybe even knew he made his way to a public place). Still,
Mr. Powell contended, Texas's law effectively criminalized his status as
an alcoholic because he could not help but doing as he did. Justice
Fortas embraced that view, but only in dissent: He would have extended
Robinson to cover conduct that flows from any "condition \[the
defendant\] is powerless to change." 392 U. S., at 567 (Fortas, J.,
dissenting).

The Court did not agree. Writing for a plurality, Justice Marshall
observed that *Robinson* had authorized "a very small" intrusion by
courts "into the substantive criminal law" "under the aegis of the Cruel
and Unusual Punishment\[s\] Clause." That small intrusion, Justice
Marshall said, prevents States only from enforcing laws that criminalize
"a mere status." It does nothing to curtail a State's authority to
secure a conviction when "the accused has committed some act . . .
society has an interest in preventing." That remains true, Justice
Marshall continued, regardless whether the defendant's act "in some
sense" might be described as "'involuntary' or 'occasioned by'" a
particular status. . . . .[^1] *\[NOTE: This footnote is important;
please read it.\]*

This case is no different from *Powell*. Just as there, the plaintiffs
here seek to expand *Robinson's* "small" intrusion "into the substantive
criminal law." . . . . And, just as in *Powell*, we discern nothing in
the Eighth Amendment that might provide us with lawful authority to
extend *Robinson* beyond its narrow holding.

To be sure, and once more, a variety of other legal doctrines and
constitutional provisions work to protect those in our criminal justice
system from a conviction \[including the possibility in certain
circumstances of "a 'necessity' defense" or "\[i\]nsanity, diminished
capacity, and duress defense"\]. . . .

The judgment below is reversed, and the case is remanded for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.

[JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring. I join the Court's opinion in full . . .
\[but\] write separately to make \[an\] additional observation\[\] . . .
.]{.mark}

[\[T\]he precedent that the respondents primarily rely upon, Robinson v.
California, 370 U. S. 660 (1962), was wrongly decided. . . . The
*Robinson* Court observed that "in the light of contemporary human
knowledge, a law which made a criminal offense of . . . a disease \[such
as narcotics addiction\] would doubtless be universally thought to be an
infliction of cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth
and Fourteenth Amendments." Modern public opinion is not an appropriate
metric for interpreting the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause--- or
any provision of the Constitution for that matter." *\[NOTE: If adopted,
this argument would invalidate over 100 Supreme Court decisions
interpreting the Eighth Amendment to evaluate the constitutionality of
punishments based on the "evolving standards of decency that mark the
progress of a maturing society." Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 101
(1958) (plurality opinion). We will discuss this challenge to the
longstanding interpretation of the Eighth Amendment when we discuss the
death penalty later in the class.\]*]{.mark}

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE KAGAN and JUSTICE JACKSON join,
dissenting.

Sleep is a biological necessity, not a crime. For some people, sleeping
outside is their only option. The City of Grants Pass jails and fines
those people for sleeping anywhere in public at any time, including in
their cars, if they use as little as a blanket to keep warm or a
rolled-up shirt as a pillow. For people with no access to shelter, that
punishes them for being homeless. That is unconscionable and
unconstitutional. Punishing people for their status is "cruel and
unusual" under the Eighth Amendment. See Robinson v. California, 370 U.
S. 660 (1962). . . .

The majority . . . spars with a strawman in its discussion of *Powell v.
Texas*. The Court in *Powell* considered the distinction between status
and conduct but could not agree on a controlling rationale. Four
Justices concluded that *Robinson* covered any "condition \[the
defendant\] is powerless to change," 392 U. S., at 567 (Fortas, J.,
dissenting), and four Justices rejected that view. Justice White,
casting the decisive fifth vote, left the question open because the
defendant had "made no showing that he was unable to stay off the
streets on the night in question." Id., at 554 (opinion concurring in
judgment). So, in his view, it was "unnecessary to pursue at this point
the further definition of the circumstances or the state of intoxication
which might bar conviction of a chronic alcoholic for being drunk in a
public place." Id., at 553.

This case similarly called for a straightforward application of
*Robinson*. The majority finds it telling that this dissent "barely
mentions" Justice Marshall's opinion in *Powell*. The majority
completely misses the point. Even Justice Marshall's plurality opinion
in *Powell* agreed that *Robinson* prohibited enforcing laws
criminalizing "a mere status." 392 U. S., at 532. The *Powell* Court
considered a statute that criminalized voluntary conduct (getting drunk)
that could be rendered involuntary by a status (alcoholism) \[but, as
Justice White noted, there was insufficient proof of such
involuntariness in *Powell*\]; here, the Ordinances criminalize conduct
(sleeping outside) that defines a particular status (homelessness). So
unlike the debate in *Powell*, this case does not turn on whether the
criminalized actions are "'involuntary' or 'occasioned by'" a particular
status. Id., at 533 (Marshall, J., dissenting). . . \[T\]hese Ordinances
criminalize status and are thus unconstitutional under any of the
opinions in *Powell*. . . .

This Court . . . has a role to play in faithfully enforcing the
Constitution to prohibit punishing the very existence of those without
shelter. I remain hopeful that someday in the near future, this Court
will play its role in safeguarding constitutional liberties for the most
vulnerable among us. Because the Court today abdicates that role, I
respectfully dissent.

[^1]: Justice White, who cast the fifth vote upholding the conviction,
    concurred in the result. Writing only for himself, Justice White
    expressed some sympathy for Justice Fortas's theory, but ultimately
    deemed that "novel construction" of the Eighth Amendment
    "unnecessary to pursue" because the defendant hadn't proven that his
    alcoholism made him "unable to stay off the streets on the night in
    question." 392 U. S., at 552, n. 4, 553--554 (White, J., concurring
    in result). \[The Court declines to follow White's opinion, choosing
    to "rely on" Justice Marshall's 4-person plurality opinion.\]
