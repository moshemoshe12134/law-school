* Abolition of punishment and prisons.

  He studies how punishment sustains racial and economic hierarchies. He works with abolitionist thinkers and movements to imagine a world without punishment.**the1313.law.columbia**+1
* Critical legal and social theory as praxis.

  He reconstructs critical theory so it does not stay in the seminar room. He insists that critique must guide concrete political action and legal struggle.**papers.ssrn**+1
* Cooperation as an alternative to punishment and markets.

  His recent book *Cooperation: A Political, Economic, and Social Theory* proposes a cooperative society based on co-ops, mutual aid, and guaranteed income.**munkschool.utoronto**+2

  He contrasts this with neoliberal penality and market “natural order,” extending arguments from  *The Illusion of Free Markets* .[[scholar.google](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MpuJh98AAAAJ&hl=en)]
* Punishment, capital punishment, and “human experimentation.”

  He focuses on new execution methods like nitrogen hypoxia. He argues these are experimental forms of state killing that expose the illegitimacy of capital punishment.**illinoislawreview**+2
* Surveillance, security, and digital capitalism.

  His earlier work *Exposed* theorized the “expository society,” where people willingly expose themselves to platforms and the state.[[scholar.google](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MpuJh98AAAAJ&hl=en)]

  He continues to link surveillance, predictive policing, and security governance to contemporary authoritarianism.[[cccct.law.columbia](https://cccct.law.columbia.edu/content/digital-initiatives)]

* Core doctrinal and institutional areas.

  His faculty profile highlights contemporary critical thought, penal law and procedure, capital punishment, and surveillance and security as primary fields.[[law.columbia](https://www.law.columbia.edu/faculty/bernard-e-harcourt)]

Prompt 3 – Harcourt on AI, algorithms, and criminal justice, 2023–2025

Short sentences. Note: key writings are earlier, but they shape 2023–2025 debates.

There appears to be no new stand‑alone Harcourt article devoted specifically to AI and criminal justice in 2023–2025. His earlier work on algorithms and prediction is, however, central to current discussions and is heavily cited in recent AI–criminal justice reports and scholarship.**lpbr**+6

Key writings and arguments (still driving 2023–2025 debates):

* *Against Prediction: Profiling, Policing, and Punishing in an Actuarial Age* (book).

  Argues actuarial policing and sentencing (using group risk statistics) can increase crime rather than reduce it, because offenders adapt and crime is displaced.[[lpbr](http://www.lpbr.net/2007/07/against-prediction-profiling-policing.html)]

  Claims actuarial methods shift policing toward “high‑risk” groups, intensifying surveillance and punishment of marginalized communities.[[lpbr](http://www.lpbr.net/2007/07/against-prediction-profiling-policing.html)]

  Warns that risk scores give a false aura of scientific neutrality, masking political and moral choices.[[lpbr](http://www.lpbr.net/2007/07/against-prediction-profiling-policing.html)]
* “Risk as a Proxy for Race: The Dangers of Risk Assessment” (article).

  Shows how “risk” variables (such as neighborhood, prior arrests, employment) function as racial proxies.

  Argues that risk assessment tools, even without explicit race, can reproduce and entrench racial disparities.**dash.harvard**+1

  Emphasizes that the problem is structural and cannot be fixed by technical tweaks alone.
* Exposed and related surveillance work.

  Describes a shift from Bentham’s panopticon to an “expository society,” where individuals expose themselves to data collection.[[scholar.google](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MpuJh98AAAAJ&hl=en)]

  Links ubiquitous data collection to new forms of governance, including predictive policing and algorithmic decision‑making.

How these arguments are used in 2023–2025 AI debates:

* Policy and academic reports on AI in criminal justice repeatedly cite his critique of actuarial methods and “risk as proxy for race.”**cyber.harvard**+4

  His work is used to argue that AI risk scores and predictive policing tools are not neutral and often amplify existing racialized policing patterns.
* His framework is invoked to challenge “fixes” that focus only on accuracy or transparency.

  The takeaway is that one must question why prediction is being used at all, what counts as “risk,” and whose liberty is sacrificed for putative safety.**scholar.google**+1
* In current discourse on “ethical AI” in criminal law, his work underpins abolitionist and critical positions.

  These positions argue that algorithmic reforms cannot solve injustice in a fundamentally carceral and racialized system, and may entrench it instead.**ohrc**+1

Prompt 4 – Recent work on policing, surveillance, prison abolition; new frameworks

Short sentences. Focus on 2023–2025 but including key ongoing frameworks.

* *Cooperation: A Political, Economic, and Social Theory* (2023; widely discussed 2024).

  Offers “cooperation” as a new overarching framework for social order.**journals.sagepub**+2

  Rejects the “crime and punishment” couple as the natural way to secure safety.

  Proposes cooperative institutions (worker and consumer co‑ops, mutual aid, guaranteed income) as alternatives to punitive and carceral responses.**munkschool.utoronto**+1
* Abolition Democracy 13/13 and “Human Experimentation in Alabama.”

  “Human Experimentation in Alabama” describes nitrogen hypoxia execution as a live experiment on a human being.**the1313.law.columbia**+1

  It reframes the death penalty as experimental state violence rather than retribution or deterrence.

  This supports an abolitionist framework that sees capital punishment as incompatible with human dignity and democratic self‑rule.**the1313.law.columbia**+1
* Marx 2/13 and 3/13 essays: new abolitionist reading of law.

  Marx 2/13 essay shows how petty “wood thefts” laws criminalized survival practices to protect emerging capitalist property regimes.[[the1313.law.columbia](https://the1313.law.columbia.edu/2024/10/21/bernard-e-harcourt-introduction-to-marx-2-13-on-marxs-1842-articles-on-thefts-of-wood-and-foucaults-lectures-on-the-punitive-society/)]

  It argues that crime and punishment are constructed to serve profit and class interest, not to respond to intrinsic wrongs.[[the1313.law.columbia](https://the1313.law.columbia.edu/2024/10/21/bernard-e-harcourt-introduction-to-marx-2-13-on-marxs-1842-articles-on-thefts-of-wood-and-foucaults-lectures-on-the-punitive-society/)]

  Marx 3/13 essay extends this, reading Marx’s critique of Hegel and liberal rights to show how law and rights can legitimize domination.[[the1313.law.columbia](https://the1313.law.columbia.edu/2024/11/08/bernard-e-harcourt-introduction-to-marx-3-13-marxs-1844-articles-on-the-critique-of-hegel-and-the-jewish-question-claude-lefort-on-human-rights-and-politics-with-jean-louise-cohen/)]

  Together, these essays help articulate an abolitionist horizon: breaking the conceptual link between crime and punishment and replacing it with cooperation and social transformation.**the1313.law.columbia**+1
* Continued work on policing and surveillance.

  His broader oeuvre critiques proactive and “broken windows” policing, arguing that these strategies expand surveillance and criminalization of everyday life.[[scholar.google](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MpuJh98AAAAJ&hl=en)]

  *Exposed* adds the idea that contemporary surveillance is participatory and digital, complicating classical panopticon models.[[scholar.google](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MpuJh98AAAAJ&hl=en)]

  Current digital initiatives at Columbia’s Center for Contemporary Critical Thought continue to explore how digital surveillance, policing, and security interact.[[cccct.law.columbia](https://cccct.law.columbia.edu/content/digital-initiatives)]
* Foucault and the carceral state.

  Harcourt continues to edit, translate, and interpret Foucault’s lectures on penal institutions and the “punitive society,” and a 2025 updated reading of Foucault’s work reflects this ongoing project.[[papers.ssrn](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/6044574.pdf?abstractid=6044574&mirid=1)]

  This work deepens the genealogy of policing, prison, and security, and informs abolitionist critiques of contemporary carceral regimes.

New or reinforced frameworks across this recent work:

* “Cooperation” vs. “crime and punishment.”

  Moves from minimalist or reformist visions of criminal law toward replacing punishment with cooperative social and economic structures.**journals.sagepub**+2
* Punishment as experiment and spectacle.

  Frames new execution methods and high‑tech punishment as experimental, expository practices that reveal the violence of the state, not its legitimacy.**illinoislawreview**+2
* Abolitionist genealogy of law.

  Uses Marx, Du Bois, Foucault, and contemporary feminist abolitionists to show that “crime,” “law,” and “punishment” are historically contingent tools of domination, opening space for abolition and non‑punitive responses.**the1313.law.columbia**+2

# The Architecture of Counterrevolution and the Praxis of Cooperation: A Critical Synthesis of the Recent Scholarship and Jurisprudence of Bernard E. Harcourt (2023–2025)

## 1. Introduction: The Juridical and Theoretical Crisis of the Mid-2020s

The intellectual and legal trajectory of Bernard E. Harcourt during the critical years of 2023 through early 2025 represents a profound deepening of his dual engagement as a critical theorist and a practicing capital defense attorney. Confronting what he diagnoses as a "modern counterrevolution" in Western liberal democracies—a phenomenon characterized by the weaponization of executive power, the dismantling of the administrative state, and the resurgence of right-wing populism—Harcourt’s work has shifted from the deconstructive critiques of the penal state that defined his earlier scholarship ( *The Illusion of Free Markets* ,  *Exposed* ) toward a reconstructive, "concretely utopian" political theory known as  **Coöperism** .

This report provides an exhaustive analysis of Harcourt’s output during this period, synthesizing his monographs, academic articles, opinion pieces, blog posts, public seminars, and active litigation filings. The analysis reveals that Harcourt’s work is not merely a reaction to contemporary events but a rigorous genealogical project that traces the DNA of the current political crisis back to the logics of colonial counterinsurgency warfare, 19th-century German idealism, and the actuarial rationalities of the digital age.

The period in question, 2023–2025, is marked by a distinctive "offensive" turn in Harcourt’s praxis. No longer content with "defensive" legal strategies that seek merely to mitigate the harms of the carceral state, Harcourt has articulated a new model of "radical legal praxis" aimed at exposing the fundamental illegitimacy of the "punitive society." This report examines this shift across four primary domains: the theoretical anatomy of the  **Modern Counterrevolution** ; the articulation of **Cooperation** as a successor paradigm to punishment; the critique of the **Expository Society** and algorithmic injustice; and the pedagogical and litigative mobilization of  **Abolition Democracy** .

---

## 2. The Anatomy of the Modern Counterrevolution (2024–2025)

In late 2024 and throughout 2025, Harcourt crystallized a theoretical framework to explain the global resurgence of authoritarianism. He terms this phenomenon the "Modern Counterrevolution." This framework moves beyond standard political science definitions of "populism" or "backsliding" to identify a specific, militarized logic of governance that has been imported from the battlefield to the domestic sphere.

### 2.1 The Genealogical Roots: From Algiers to the Administrative State

Harcourt’s central thesis, elaborated in his seminal May 2025 essay "A Modern Counterrevolution" for  *The Ideas Letter* , is that the political strategies of the contemporary American right are derived directly from the logic of "guerre moderne" (modern warfare) developed by French and American military strategists in the mid-20th century.^^ ** **

Harcourt explicitly links the governing philosophy of the "Trump II" era to the counterinsurgency (COIN) doctrines of David Galula, a French officer and theorist who operated in Algeria. Galula’s "Maoist" understanding of society—which views the population not as a democratic citizenry but as a terrain of warfare—has been appropriated for domestic political control. Harcourt dissects this logic into a tripartite structure that now governs American domestic politics:

1. **The Active Insurgent:** The counterrevolutionary state identifies a small minority of "radicals" or "internal enemies." In the 1950s, these were anti-colonial guerillas; in 2025, they are rebranded as "the woke," "DEI advocates," "gender ideology" proponents, or "cultural Marxists." The labeling of these groups serves to isolate them from the body politic.^^ ** **
2. **The Neutral Majority:** This is the large, passive mass of the population whose allegiance is up for grabs. The goal of the counterrevolution is not necessarily to radicalize this majority, but to ensure their passivity or tacit consent by demonstrating that the "insurgents" pose a threat to their stability.^^ ** **
3. **The Active Counter-Insurgent Minority:** The loyalist base (the MAGA movement, in the US context) that must be mobilized to neutralize the insurgents and sway the majority. This minority is deputized, often through rhetoric and policy, to enforce the new order.^^ ** **

Harcourt observes that this militarized logic transforms the nature of governance. The "Modern Counterrevolution" is an *offensive* strategy. It treats domestic political opponents not as legitimate adversaries in a democratic contest, but as existential threats to be eradicated. This Schmittian distinction between friend and enemy undergirds the aggressive use of executive power to purge the civil service, attack universities, and dismantle regulatory agencies—a process Harcourt categorizes as the "demolition phase" of the counterrevolution.^^ ** **

### 2.2 Hegel, the Heritage Foundation, and Project 2025

A distinctive feature of Harcourt’s 2025 analysis is his rigorous philosophical mapping of the American conservative movement, specifically the Heritage Foundation’s "Project 2025," onto the systematic thought of G.W.F. Hegel. In his essay "Hegel and the Heritage Foundation," Harcourt identifies deep "family resemblances" between the structure of Hegel’s *Philosophy of Right* and the policy blueprints of the modern right.^^ ** **

Harcourt argues that both Hegel’s idealism and the Heritage Foundation’s policy agenda share an identical starting point: the "moral imperative" of the traditional nuclear family and the sanctity of private property. He notes that Project 2025 seeks to "restore the family as the centerpiece of American life," a goal that mirrors Hegel’s placement of the family as the immediate, ethical root of the state.^^ ** **

This comparison is not merely academic; it reveals the *strategic function* of the family in authoritarian politics. Harcourt explains that Project 2025 uses the "natural" status of the traditional family to delegitimize non-normative identities (LGBTQ+ individuals, non-traditional households) and to justify the "walling off" of civil society from the state.

**Table 1: The Hegelian Structure of the Modern Counterrevolution**

| Hegelian Concept        | Traditional Hegelian Function                                           | Application in Project 2025 / Modern Counterrevolution                                                         | Strategic Implication (Harcourt's Analysis)                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **The Family**    | The immediate ethical substance; the foundation of social life.         | The "moral imperative"; the traditional nuclear unit (man/woman/child) is the only legitimate social root.^^   | Delegitimizes LGBTQ+ rights; frames gender-affirming care as an attack on the "natural" order; justifies state intervention to "protect" the family. |
| **Civil Society** | The realm of economic interdependence and mediation.                    | A sphere to be "walled off" from the State; private institutions (churches) replace public welfare.^^          | Privatization of social services; dismantling of public education; erosion of the social safety net in favor of "charity."                           |
| **The State**     | The realization of the ethical idea; the actuality of concrete freedom. | Re-imagined as a tool for "dismantling the administrative state" while strengthening executive/police power.^^ | The "State" becomes a weapon of demolition against the bureaucracy (the "Deep State") while simultaneously expanding its police and military powers. |

  Harcourt’s insight here is crucial: the modern counterrevolution uses the *grounding* of family and property not to build a universal welfare state (as Hegel might have envisioned in certain readings), but to justify an autocratic executive that protects these foundations by destroying the "bureaucratic" mechanisms of the administrative state. The "State" in this modern formation becomes a "lean police state," focused solely on military power, border enforcement, and the protection of traditional hierarchies, while abdicating its responsibilities for public health, education, and economic equity.^^ ** **

### 2.3 The Marxian Lens: Spectacle and the "Daily Coup"

Complementing the Hegelian structural analysis, Harcourt employs a Marxian analytical framework to dissect the *tactics* of the counterrevolutionary leadership. Drawing heavily on Karl Marx’s *The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte* during his *Marx 13/13* seminar series (2024–2025), Harcourt draws parallels between the rise of Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte and contemporary populist leaders like Donald Trump.^^ ** **

Harcourt emphasizes Marx’s observation that history is driven by social forces and class relations, not merely by "great men," even when those men appear to dominate the stage. He characterizes the current political leadership as "grotesque mediocrities" who are nonetheless enabled by specific "circumstances and relationships"—namely, the extreme wealth inequality and the hollowing out of the middle class—to play the hero’s part.^^ ** **

Furthermore, Harcourt appropriates the concept of "coups d’état en miniature" (daily miniature coups) to describe the governing style of the modern counterrevolution. Just as Louis-Napoléon kept the French public in a state of constant agitation, the Trump II administration (in Harcourt's analysis of the 2025 landscape) utilizes a barrage of executive orders, social media spectacles, and shocks to the system to "mesmerize" the public.^^ ** **

This "illusionist" strategy serves a dual purpose:

1. **Base Mobilization:** It energizes the "active counter-insurgent minority" through entertainment and vindication. The spectacle of "owning the libs" or purging "internal enemies" becomes a source of libidinal satisfaction for the base.^^ ** **
2. **Distraction:** It distracts the "neutral majority" from the structural dismantling of the state. While the public consumes the daily drama of the "coups en miniature," the administration quietly executes the "demolition phase," dismantling environmental regulations, labor protections, and civil rights enforcement.^^ ** **

### 2.4 The Constitutional Crisis and the "Apex" of Counterrevolution

In his "Life During a Constitutional Crisis" lecture (2025), Harcourt contextualizes these dynamics within the broader sweep of American history. He argues that the US moves in a "sinusoidal pattern" of revolution and counterrevolution. However, the current moment represents an "apex" (peak) of the counterrevolutionary cycle, distinct from the McCarthy era or the Nixon years because of the convergence of three factors:

* **Technological Acceleration:** The rise of AI and surveillance capitalism (discussed in Section 4).
* **Economic Globalization:** The hyper-mobility of capital and the crushing of labor.
* **Democratic Downgrade:** The shifting of the US from a "full democracy" to a "flawed democracy" (as categorized by indices), where the democratic process is no longer the "only game in town".^^ ** **

Harcourt warns that this apex brings the risk of "autocratic legalism," where the forms of law are preserved but hollowed out to serve authoritarian ends. He specifically critiques the Supreme Court’s role in this, noting its shift toward validating capital punishment and dismantling federal regulatory power, effectively serving as the judicial arm of the counterrevolution.^^ ** **

---

## 3. Coöperism: The Reconstructive Paradigm (2023–2025)

If the "Modern Counterrevolution" constitutes Harcourt’s diagnosis of the current pathology, **Coöperism** represents the cure. Following the publication of *Cooperation: A Political, Economic, and Social Theory* (Columbia University Press, 2023), Harcourt has spent 2024 and 2025 elaborating this framework as a necessary successor to the "punishment paradigm" that has dominated Western governance for centuries.

### 3.1 Beyond the Punishment Paradigm

Harcourt argues that the defining feature of the current social order is its reliance on punishment as the primary mechanism for social cohesion. He posits that concepts like "deterrence," "retribution," and even "rehabilitation" are ideological masks that conceal the system’s true function: the maintenance of racial and economic hierarchies.^^ ** **

In his 2024–2025 lectures and writings, Harcourt contends that the "punishment paradigm" operates *ex post* (after the fact), addressing social harms only after they have occurred and often exacerbating them through carceral violence. This reactive model is inherently flawed because it does not address the root causes of harm (poverty, alienation, lack of resources). Instead, it manages the fallout of these structural failures through incarceration and police violence.

Harcourt proposes "Coöperism" as an *ex ante* framework, organizing society to prevent harm through structural interdependence.^^ He argues that a society built on cooperative principles would naturally reduce the friction and desperation that lead to social harm, thereby rendering the penal state obsolete. ** **

### 3.2 The Three Pillars of Coöperism

Harcourt’s theory of Coöperism is not merely an economic proposal; it is a total social theory that addresses the political, economic, and social dimensions of existence. He structures the theory around three pillars:

#### 3.2.1 Political Coöperism: Cooperation Democracy

Harcourt rejects the "autocracy" of the modern workplace and the limited democracy of the ballot box. He argues that true democracy cannot exist if it is confined to the political sphere while the economic sphere remains dictatorial (with bosses and shareholders holding absolute power).

* **Key Argument:** "Cooperation Democracy" extends participatory principles into all spheres of life. It demands that institutions—from schools to workplaces to housing—be governed democratically by their members.^^ ** **
* **Contrast with Liberal Democracy:** While liberal democracy focuses on rights and elections, cooperation democracy focuses on *agency* and *participation* in daily life.

#### 3.2.2 Economic Coöperism: Ending the Economic Plague

Harcourt identifies "coöperism" as an "end to the economic plague" of neoliberal capitalism.^^ He champions forms of economic organization that prioritize member welfare over shareholder profit. ** **

* **Mechanisms:** He highlights existing models such as credit unions, worker cooperatives, mutual insurance companies, and community land trusts. He argues that these forms already exist "in the shadows" of the capitalist economy and must be scaled up to replace the extractive logic of the current system.^^ ** **
* **The Theory of Wealth:** Unlike capitalism, which concentrates wealth, or communism, which centralizes it in the state, coöperism *distributes* wealth broadly among the participants (co-operators), ensuring that the surplus value generated by labor is returned to the laborers.^^ ** **

#### 3.2.3 Social Coöperism: Abolition as Creation

This is the most radical pillar, directly linking Coöperism to the project of prison abolition. Harcourt argues that a society based on cooperation would naturally render the punitive state obsolete.

* **The Logic:** By replacing the logic of "crime and punishment" with "harm and repair" (facilitated by cooperative structures), the need for the carceral apparatus withers away. Abolition, in this framework, is not just the *negative* act of closing prisons, but the *positive* act of building the cooperative social infrastructure that makes prisons unnecessary.^^ ** **

**Table 2: The Paradigm Shift – Punishment vs. Cooperation**

| Feature                          | The Punishment Paradigm                          | The Cooperation Paradigm                         |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Primary Mechanism**      | Coercion, Incarceration, Deterrence              | Cooperation, Mutual Aid, Interdependence         |
| **Timing of Intervention** | *Ex Post*(Reactive to harm)                    | *Ex Ante*(Preventative through structure)      |
| **Economic Basis**         | Competition, Extraction, Profit Maximization     | Distribution, Equity, Member Welfare             |
| **Political Form**         | Liberal Democracy (limited); Workplace Autocracy | Cooperation Democracy (ubiquitous participation) |
| **Role of the State**      | The "Night Watchman" / The Punisher              | The Facilitator / The Coordinator                |
| **Goal**                   | Order Maintenance / Social Control               | Human Flourishing / Collective Agency            |

### 3.3 Coöperism as Counter-Counterrevolution

In his recent public appearances, including the *Coöperism 13/13* seminar (2023–2024) and subsequent lectures in 2025, Harcourt frames Coöperism not just as a utopian project but as a strategic necessity to combat the rising fascism of the modern counterrevolution.^^ ** **

He argues that the liberal defense of the status quo is "impotent" against right-wing populism because neoliberalism has failed to deliver economic security.^^ The "neutral majority" is susceptible to the siren song of the counterrevolution because they are economically precarious and socially alienated. Coöperism offers a "concretely utopian" alternative that addresses the material anxieties driving the populace toward authoritarianism, thereby draining the "swamp" of resentment that fuels the counterrevolution.^^ By giving people actual ownership and agency in their economic lives, Coöperism inoculates society against the appeal of the strongman. ** **

## 4. The Expository Society and the Algorithmic State (2023–2025)

Harcourt’s engagement with technology in 2024–2025 builds upon his seminal critique in *Against Prediction* (2007) and *Exposed* (2015). However, his recent work adapts these earlier theories to the era of generative AI, ubiquitous biometric surveillance, and the "prediction society." He argues that the digital landscape has fundamentally altered the terrain of struggle, creating new vulnerabilities for civil liberty and new tools for the counterrevolutionary state.

### 4.1 The Expository Society: Surveillance through Voluntary Disclosure

Harcourt introduces the concept of the "Expository Society" to describe the current regime of digital power. He distinguishes this from Foucault’s *disciplinary society* (based on confinement) and Deleuze’s *society of control* (based on continuous monitoring). The expository society relies on the *voluntary* disclosure of personal information.^^ ** **

* **The Mechanism:** Harcourt argues that individuals now expose their most intimate data—location, desires, political affiliations, biometrics—on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and BlueSky. We do this for "libidinal" satisfaction, seeking recognition, validation, and connection.
* **The Consequence:** This shift has rendered traditional state surveillance methods (wiretaps, spies) largely redundant. The state no longer needs to infiltrate movements; it simply needs to scrape the data that activists voluntarily provide.
* **Weaponization:** The "modern counterrevolution" capitalizes on this by mining open-source data to track, monitor, and repress social movements without needing to overcome the legal hurdles of traditional warrants. Harcourt warns that this transparency is increasingly "instrumentalized against social movements," creating a dynamic where the tools of liberation (social media) become the tools of capture.^^ ** **

### 4.2 Artificial Intelligence and the "Ratchet Effect"

In his 2023–2025 analysis of AI in criminal justice, Harcourt revisits the central thesis of  *Against Prediction* : that actuarial methods distort justice. He applies this to modern AI-driven policing and risk assessment tools (like COMPAS and newer predictive algorithms).^^ ** **

Harcourt’s primary argument against AI in this context remains the **"Ratchet Effect."** He explains that predictive algorithms are trained on historical crime data. However, this data is not a record of *crime* (which is unknown), but a record of *arrests* and  *police activity* . Because police historically patrol marginalized and minority communities more heavily, the data reflects this bias.

1. **The Loop:** When AI uses this "dirty data" to predict future crime, it directs police back to those same neighborhoods.
2. **The Validation:** Police find crime there (because they are looking for it), generating more arrests.
3. **The Ratchet:** This new data is fed back into the algorithm, "validating" the initial prediction and justifying even more intense policing in the future. The bias is thus "ratcheted up" with each cycle, all under the guise of mathematical objectivity.^^ ** **

### 4.3 The Unfalsifiability Problem and the "Prediction Society"

Harcourt (and interlocutors citing his work in 2024–2025) argues that algorithmic predictions in criminal justice are often  **unfalsifiable** .

* **The Problem:** If an algorithm predicts a defendant is "high risk" and the judge detains them, we never learn if they *would have* committed a crime had they been released. The prediction creates the condition (detention) that prevents the outcome, making it impossible to prove the algorithm wrong.^^ ** **
* **The Prediction Society:** He warns that the ubiquity of algorithmic decision-making (in bail, sentencing, employment, and credit) is creating a "Prediction Society." In this order, individuals lose their autonomy to author their own futures. The "virtual self" (the data profile) becomes more important than the actual self. We are judged not on what we have done, but on what an algorithm predicts we *might* do, based on the statistical aggregate of others.^^ ** **

Harcourt critiques the "techno-solutionism" that believes "de-biasing" algorithms can solve these problems. He maintains that the issue is not just *bad data* but the  *actuarial logic itself* , which fundamentally conflicts with the principles of individualized justice and human potential.^^ ** **

## 5. Radical Legal Praxis: Offensive Litigation and Abolition (2024–2025)

Harcourt distinguishes himself from many critical theorists by maintaining an active, high-stakes litigation practice. His work in 2024–2025 demonstrates a seamless integration of his theoretical commitments (abolition, anti-counterrevolution) with courtroom advocacy. This section details his "offensive" turn in legal strategy.

### 5.1 "J'Accuse": The Shift to Offensive Praxis

In his major lecture "J'Accuse: A Critical Theory of Radical Legal Praxis" (delivered as the Moffett Lecture at Princeton in September 2024), Harcourt articulated a pivotal shift in his approach to legal advocacy. He argues that the era of the "modern counterrevolution" demands that lawyers move from a "defensive posture" (merely protecting clients from state violence) to an "offensive strategy" that challenges the legitimacy of the system itself.^^ ** **

Using the historical example of Émile Zola’s intervention in the Dreyfus Affair, Harcourt calls for a form of advocacy that "turns the tables" on oppressors. This involves:

* **The Strategy:** Not just winning individual cases, but using litigation to expose the corruption, racism, and cruelty of the state machinery.
* **The Goal:** To put the State on trial. Harcourt argues that in an era of "autocratic legalism," playing by the rules of the court is insufficient because the rules themselves are rigged. The lawyer must therefore use the courtroom as a platform for a broader political indictment.^^ ** **

### 5.2 Litigating the Death Penalty: The Nitrogen Gas Cases

Harcourt’s current legal docket exemplifies this offensive strategy, particularly in his representation of death row inmates in Alabama.

* **Context:** Following the botched execution attempt of his client Doyle Lee Hamm (who survived a lethal injection attempt in 2018 due to collapsed veins), Alabama sought to introduce **nitrogen hypoxia** (gassing) as a new method of execution.^^ ** **
* **The Litigation:** In 2023–2025, Harcourt has been at the forefront of challenging this new method (e.g., in  *Miller v. Hamm* ,  *Smith v. Hamm* ). He describes the state’s pursuit of this method as a "ghoulish pursuit" and a form of human experimentation.^^ ** **
* **Theoretical Dimension:** Harcourt frames these cases within the context of  **biopolitics** . He argues that the State is engaged in a "sovereign display of public torment," echoing Foucault’s analysis in  *Discipline and Punish* . The State’s insistence on executing a terminally ill or compromised inmate (like Hamm) reveals that the purpose of the death penalty is not justice or deterrence, but the assertion of absolute power over the biological life of the subject. Harcourt uses these filings to expose the "madness" of the American death penalty machinery.^^ ** **

### 5.3 Guantánamo Bay and the "Internal Enemy"

Harcourt continues to litigate on behalf of detainees at Guantánamo Bay, achieving significant victories such as the repatriation of **Abdul Latif Nasser** (released in 2021, but the legal and political ramifications continued into his 2023-2025 work).

* **The Argument:** Harcourt frames Guantánamo as the ultimate "state of exception," where the government suspends the rule of law to create a class of "internal enemies" stripped of rights.
* **The Link to Counterrevolution:** In his 2025 writings, he explicitly links the treatment of Guantánamo detainees to the "Modern Counterrevolution’s" treatment of domestic immigrants and protestors. The logic used to hold Nasser without charge for nearly two decades is the same logic now being deployed to detain undocumented immigrants and threaten political dissidents.^^ ** **

### 5.4 Civil Rights and Policing: *Andrew Smith v. City of New York*

In the realm of policing, Harcourt represents plaintiffs in  *Andrew Smith v. City of New York* , a civil rights class action challenging the NYPD’s racialized policing strategies.

* **The Framework:** This litigation directly applies Harcourt’s theoretical critiques of "Broken Windows" policing. He argues that the police strategy was "always racist" and designed to control minority populations rather than reduce crime.^^ ** **
* **The Offensive Turn:** Rather than just seeking damages, the litigation seeks to expose the systemic nature of the abuse, using discovery to uncover the data and policies that drive the "ratchet effect" of discriminatory policing.^^ ** **

## 6. Pedagogical Interventions: The 13/13 Seminars (2023–2025)

Harcourt’s work is also defined by his commitment to public pedagogy. His **13/13 Seminar Series** at Columbia University functions as a critical "public sphere" intervention, bridging the academy and the broader public to democratize critical theory.

### 6.1 Marx 13/13 (2024–2025)

The 2024–2025 seminar series, titled  **Marx 13/13** , was explicitly designed to address the current political crisis. Subtitled "A Counterrevolution without a Revolution," the series read Marx’s 13 critical texts (paired with 13 modern interpretations) to understand the global right-wing turn.^^ ** **

* **Theme:** The seminar used Marx’s analysis of the 1848 revolutions and the subsequent counterrevolutions to interpret the "Trump II" phenomenon.
* **Key Insight:** The series explored how "counterrevolution" can occur even in the absence of a preceding revolution, driven by the anxieties of the ruling class and the "passive revolution" of the state.^^ ** **

### 6.2 Coöperism 13/13 (2023–2024)

Preceding the Marx seminar, the **Coöperism 13/13** series focused on the reconstructive aspect of Harcourt’s work.

* **Focus:** This series brought together scholars, activists, and practitioners to explore the history and future of cooperative movements. It served as a laboratory for the ideas presented in his book  *Cooperation* , testing the viability of "cooperation democracy" as a political strategy.^^ ** **

### 6.3 Upcoming: Hegel 13/13 (2025–2026)

Looking ahead, Harcourt has announced **Hegel 13/13** for the 2025–2026 academic year. This series aims to return to Hegel’s texts to understand the "confrontations" that shape world history, continuing the project of analyzing the deep structure of Western political thought and its appropriation by the Right.^^ ** **

## 7. Conclusion: The Harcourtian Moment

The scholarship and advocacy of Bernard E. Harcourt from 2023 through 2025 represent a vital intervention in a time of "Catastrophic Age." By synthesizing the military logic of counterinsurgency, the philosophical structures of German idealism, and the actuarial dangers of AI, Harcourt provides a lucid map of the  **Modern Counterrevolution** . He reveals that the chaos of contemporary politics is not random, but a structured, "offensive" demolition of the democratic state.

Yet, Harcourt’s work refuses to remain in the realm of critique. Through the framework of  **Coöperism** , he offers a pragmatic, materialist alternative to the "punishment paradigm." By identifying the "Expository Society" and the "Prediction Society" as the technological enablers of authoritarianism, he points to the sites where resistance is most necessary.

Ultimately, Harcourt’s "offensive" turn in legal praxis—exemplified by the "J'Accuse" lecture and his litigation against the death penalty—demonstrates that critical theory must be lived as well as written. In the face of an "apex" of counterrevolutionary power, Harcourt offers a rigorous, combative, and hopeful vision of a society organized not around the sovereign power to punish, but around the collective power to cooperate.

### Key Takeaways

* **The Modern Counterrevolution** is a strategic, militarized offensive that uses "counterinsurgency" logic (identifying internal enemies, swaying the neutral majority) to dismantle the administrative state.
* **Project 2025** is structurally "Hegelian," using the "moral imperative" of the nuclear family and private property to justify an autocratic executive and the demolition of civil society protections.
* **Coöperism** is the necessary successor to the "Punishment Paradigm." It proposes a society based on *ex ante* interdependence (political, economic, and social) to render the carceral state obsolete.
* **The Expository Society** relies on voluntary data disclosure, which the state weaponizes to monitor dissent. This fuels the  **Algorithmic State** , where "unfalsifiable" predictions and the "ratchet effect" of dirty data reinforce racial hierarchies.
* **Radical Praxis** requires a shift from "defense" to "offense." Lawyers and theorists must "turn the tables" (J'Accuse), putting the State on trial for its biopolitical violence and systemic corruption.
