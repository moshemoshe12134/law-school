Answer-to-Question-_1_

Judge Watkins,

This case centers on a federal habeas corpus appeal for David Wilson’s involvement in the death of
Dewey Walker. Wilson’s counsel is arguing that there was a Brady violation because Corley’s confession
letter was not admitted into evidence by the Alabama AG, and Corley did not testify at Wilson’s trial. This
evidence would likely impact how a reasonable juror would evaluate the evidence that Wilson intentionally
caused Walker’s death, which is what made him eligible for death penalty, so I recommend the court

mandate inclusion of such evidence.

Wilson’s Counsel

As you are aware, a Brady violation is the argument that prosecutors failed to disclose material
exculpatory evidence to the defense. This is a collateral argument, in that Wilson’s counsel is putting forth
evidence not already in the record. Wilson’s counsel will likely argue that Corley’s statement would impact
how a reasonable juror would view the evidence, so failure to provide such evidence constitutes a Brady
violation. Because Corley submitted her confession pre-trial, Wilson’s counsel will argue that she would

have told the same chronology if called to trial, likely influencing the jury to give Wilson a lesser sentence.

Wilson’s counsel will assert that a reasonable jury could interpret Corley’s letter to suggest that
Wilson was not the proximate cause of the death, because taking a narrow time frame (Kelman), Walker
did not fall when Wilson strangled him with the extension cord, but rather when Corley hit him with the
baseball bat. Wilson’s act (MPC 1.13(2)) therefore did not cause Walker’s death. Corley’s acts are what
explain the “multiple skull fractures and three separate lacerations” that the forensic pathologist found on

Walker’s head.

Assuming arguendo that the jury still believes Wilson was a proximate cause of Walker’s death,
Wilson’s counsel will likely argue that the inclusion of Corley’s letter means Wilson is no longer eligible
for the death penalty under Section 13A-5-40, as 13A-5-40(b) defines eligible murder as when the
defendant had “intent to cause the death of another person.” As per Corley, Wilson only put the cord
around Walker’s neck to destabilize him long enough to allow Corley to escape before Walker called the
cops. The standard of “intent” is incredibly difficult to meet, and a reasonable juror will likely hold that

this was not met. However, the defense cannot lower Walker’s conviction by too much, given he was

clearly in the course of committing a robbery when the incident occurred. The defense will likely argue
that Wilson be held for murder (MPC 210.2(1)(b)) for his reckless behavior manifesting extreme
indifference to human life (presumed in a robbery), which is still a felony of the first degree, but without

the option to sentence Wilson to death.

Wilson’s lawyers will argue that Corley should be seen as the proximate cause of Walker’s death,
yet only receive a sentence of manslaughter. As per her own testimony, she was engaging in the robbery
when the death happened (or at the very least was part of a conspiracy to rob under Wilson’s testimony).
However, she has a strong case under the insanity defense - she had mental health issues that she was not
being treated for at the time of the crime. She lacked “substantial capacity” to conform her conduct to the
requirements of the law (MPC 4.01) and therefore her sentence (which normally should be murder, as she
was engaged in a robbery when the homicide occurred) should be reduced to manslaughter due to her

extreme mental disturbance (MPC 210.3(1)(b)).

Alabama AG

The Alabama AG will likely assert that the Corley’s letter would make no difference to a reasonable
juror, so need not be included. There were ample opportunities for Wilson’s sentence to be reduced with
the evidence that he did provide - Wilson asserted that his intent was not murder, but rather “an attempt to
make Walker drop the knife.” This was corroborated by the fact that Walker was breathing when Wilson
left. Wilson also testified that Corley was alone with Walker for multiple minutes, and though he did not
hear any commotion, Corley easily could have hit Walker to the extent that the forensic pathologist
suggested (ex. “eight broken ribs and a fractured sternum”). However, the jury received all of this evidence
and STILL held that Wilson had intent to cause death (13A-5-40(b) in the course of a robbery, making him
punishable by death under 13A-5-40(a)(6). The jury then sentenced him to death in the next phase of the
trial. There is no reason why Corley’s letter would push a reasonable juror over the edge to now support

Wilson’s version of the story.

Further, the AG will argue that Wilson was a proximate cause of Walker’s death even given
Corley’s letter, because even if he did not hit Walker with the bat, meaning he was not the “actual cause”
of the injury, he was a “substantial factor” in the harm - without Wilson holding Walker, Corley likely

would not have been able to hit Walker as many times as she did, resulting in Walker’s death.

Thus, the Alabama AG will likely argue that the appropriate level of homicide for Wilson is what he

received now, namely capital murder punishable by death.

The Alabama AG will also likely argue that Corley’s letter should not be included because of its
lack of clarity. The letter is full of inconsistencies - she says that she needed medications back then but
regardless “it was Dewey’s time to go,” and she claimed that the “story on other side is also true” even
though Wilson’s account of the affairs conflicts with her own testimony. This may be evidence that Corley

was not aware of what she was writing, and making statements that were untrue.

If the letter is included, then the Alabama AG will likely argue that the appropriate level of criminal
culpability for Corley is the same as for Wilson, namely capital murder punishable by death. The AG will
likely argue that the insanity defense does not hold for “repeated criminal or otherwise anti-social conduct”
(MPC 4.01(2)), so unless a specific mental illness is pointed to, Corley does not have strong grounds for
her insanity defense. If clearer evidence is provided on the specific mental health issues Corley faces, the
AG will not advocate for the death penalty (deemed excessive under the 8th Amendment when applied to a
mentally disabled offender-Atkins), so will likely advocate for a lower level culpability of murder or

perhaps even agree with Wilson’s counsel on manslaughter.

Recommendation to Court

I recommend that the court require Corley’s letter to be introduced as evidence, given Wilson’s
counsel makes strong arguments for why Wilson is no longer eligible for the death penalty. A reasonable
jury could be swayed by this evidence, given Corley essentially admits to causing Walker’s death herself,
so it is important to give the jury a chance to weigh the evidence and decide for itself whether Wilson

intended to cause Walker’s death, and whether his actions “justified” the death penalty.

Validity

This ruling halts the death sentence meted to Wilson by the state trial court, as crucial evidence that

ought to have been included was not. A subsequent jury could again rule that Wilson be sentenced to death.
