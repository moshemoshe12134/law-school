1:19-CV-284-WKW | Memo

Dear Judge Watkins:

(1) Defense

(1-a)
The strongest argument Wilson’s defense counsel can make regarding Wilson’s culpability is that
no reasonable juror could find Wilson guilty of capital murder under the Alabama statute (13A-5-40)

-- let alone find Wilson guilty of capital murder beyond a reasonable doubt.

Even disregarding Corley’s alleged involvement, the requisite mens rea under the Alabama
capital murder statute is “intent to cause the death of another person” (actus reus: murder). The
defense will argue that the record lacks any evidence suggesting that Wilson manifested the requisite

intent to murder Dewey.

In consideration of the Corley letter, the Defense’s case is only strengthened. Corley admits to
beating Dewey with a bat after Wilson was unable to incapacitate him with the cord. Corley’s
admission -- and Wilson’s absolution -- is further bolstered by the coroner’s findings that Dewey died in a
manner inconsistent with how Wilson allegedly killed him, but aligned with what Corley described in her

letter (i.e. Corley beating Dewey with a bat).

Ultimately, the defense will likely try to make a self defense argument for Wilson’s attempt to
incapacitate Dewey under MPC.3.04. The defense will emphasize that Wilson believed the use of force
was “immediately necessary” for purposes of protecting himself from Dewey, since Dewey was harmed
with a knife. The defense will probably rebut any assertions that Wilson’s self-defense claim is limited by
MPC.3.04(2)(a)(ii) because Wilson believed his use of force to be necessary to protect himself “against
death or immediate bodily harm” - MPC.3.04(2)(a)(ii)(3).

The defense might also emphasize the fact that Wilson has Asperger’s syndrome, which might be
considered an intellectual disability that reduces Wilson’s culpability (especially from a deterrence/general

policy standpoint), and also renders him unable to be sentenced to death under Atkins (if Asperger’s is

considered an intellectual disability).

(1-b)

I do not think the defense will argue that Wilson should be liable for murder at all, given the
admission of the Corley letter and significant lack of evidence as to whether Wilson actually did anything
more than incapacitate Dewey with a cord. For argument’s sake, however, I would expect the Defense
to argue that Wilson is culpable under a significantly ratcheted-down murder standard: felony

murder - MPC.2.10(b).

Wilson engaged in the burglary of Dewey’s home and had the requisite mens rea for committing
the burglary. Regardless of whether Wilson actually killed Dewey himself (or if Corley was the one to do

so), Wilson was an accomplice in the burglary that led to Dewey’s death.

The Defense might attempt to posit that Wilson’s recklessness in being an accomplice in the
burglary should not be ratcheted up to the presumption under MPC.2.10(b), but I do not expect them
to have much evidence on this argument, aside from potentially emphasizing Wilson’s Asperger’s disease

as something affecting his mens rea.

(1-c)

Corley’s defense counsel will probably also argue that Corley is culpable on the basis of felony
murder under MPC.2.10(b). Corley admitted in her letter that she is now heavily medicated and that she
“needed” to be medicated at the time of the alleged offense, so Corley’s defense might attempt to issue an
insanity defense for her under MPC.4.01. (she lacked “substantial capacity” to “conform [her] conduct to
the requirements of the law.”’). This might be a difficult hurdle for Corley’s defense attorneys to overcome,

given that the burden will be on them to prove that Corley can posit that defense.

(2) Prosecution

(2-a, 2-b)

The prosecution will likely try to maintain their position that Wilson is guilty of capital murder
under the Alabama statute: 13A-5-40(a)(c), regarding murder “during a burglary or an attempt
thereof committed by the defendant.” As noted above, the prosecution will need to prove both that
Wilson had the requisite mens rea (specific intent to murder) and actus reus (actually did the murdering).

It appears uncontested that this incident occurred during a burglary.

Extegrity Exam4 > 22.10.31.1 Section All Page 4 of 8

On the mens rea issue, the prosecution will probably emphasize the fact that Wilson brought a bat
with him to Dewey’s house (though allegedly due to fear of Dewey’s dog) and Wilson attempted to
strangle Dewey twice - per Wilson’s own testimony - including one bout of strangling for six minutes (a

long time).

The prosecution will also emphasize that Wilson did not need to attack Dewey - especially with
deadly force - given that Wilson likely could have retreated, MPC.3.04(2)(b)(ii). If Wilson had simply
run away while Dewey’s back was turned, Wilson would not have needed to immediately fear for his life.
Not only was Dewey unlikely to physically overpower Wilson given his age, but Dewey was also only
holding a knife -- not a gun. It’s not as though Dewey could’ve stood still and hit Wilson with a bullet --
Dewey would’ve needed to catch, and then stab, Wilson to be an “immediate threat.” Accordingly, the
prosecution will denounce any attempts of Wilson’s defense counsel to claim that Wilson’s actions

were done in self-defense.

The prosecution will also probably try to downplay the Corley letter altogether (like the Alabama
Attorney General). By Corley’s own admission, regardless of whether she was suffering from mental
illness at the time of the offense, Corley is currently suffering from significant mental illness requiring
her to be strongly medicated (could probably be corroborated by her doctor). Corley is therefore not

exactly a reliable narrator for the defense to rest an entire case of Wilson’s non-culpability on.

Additionally, the prosecution will probably try to highlight that, even though Dewey’s cause of
death appeared to be trauma from a baseball bat (rather than via strangulation), there’s no reason to
believe that Wilson did not beat Dewey with a baseball bat, other than his and Corley’s testimony. If
the prosecution argues that Corley is an unreliable witness, then Wilson is a plausible, if not the best,
candidate for the one who actually killed Dewey. Likewise, Wilson was the one to bring the bat to

Dewey’s house, thereby adding an additional reason to believe it was he who used it.

Finally, the prosecution might try to posit liability for Wilson under MPC.2.01(3) regarding his
omission to seek medical assistance for Dewey after he allegedly hit and strangled him. Wilson was
aware that Dewey was unconscious and bleeding when Wilson fled the scene. Since Wilson was the reason
for Dewey’s injuries -- even if he didn’t beat him with the bat -- Wilson had a duty to seek medical help for
Wilson. The prosecution may emphasize this to diminish Wilson’s character and make him less

favorable to a jury.

As a last point on Wilson’s character, the prosecution might emphasize that Wilson knew Dewey,

which could make Wilson’s actions seem even worse.

(2-c)

The prosecution will likely continue to focus on Wilson as the person who murdered Dewey, and
they therefore will likely charge Corley under the felony murder standard -- MPC.2.10(2). However, if
the prosecution shifts focus to Corley, due to her letter, the prosecution might attempt to charge her under

the Alabama capital murder statute like Wilson was - 13A-5-40(a)(6).

(3) The court should side with the defense.

No reasonable juror would find sufficient evidence in the initial record to convict Wilson of capital
murder, and this is only strengthened by the admission of Corley’s letter. Wilson’s Asperger’s syndrome is
also an important factor to consider on public policy grounds -- I am not presently certain whether
Asperger’s syndrome is considered an intellectual disability, but it is a condition that impacts the way
people think. We should avoid violating the Supreme Court’s precedent in Atkins and consider how
advancements in science and psychiatry allow us to understand conditions like Aspberger’s in the years
since Atkins. Ultimately, between the coroner’s finding that Dewey was beaten to death after being
strangled, and Corley’s testimony that she was the one who beat Atkins to death, it seems unjust to uphold

Wilson’s death sentence under 13A-5-40.

(4) Wilson’s death sentence should be overturned and he should be granted a new trial --

especially in light of the issues at his initial trial regarding ineffective assistance of counsel, erroneous jury
instructions, prosecutorial misconduct, and the lack of consideration of Wilson’s Asperger’s syndrome.
(Notwithstanding the fact that we must defer to the state court on ineffective assistance of counsel issues

per AEDPA).
The facts of the case cannot be understood as set in stone from the state court phase given our

knowledge that the Corley letter -- a monumental piece of discovery -- was withheld at the time in

violation of Brady.
