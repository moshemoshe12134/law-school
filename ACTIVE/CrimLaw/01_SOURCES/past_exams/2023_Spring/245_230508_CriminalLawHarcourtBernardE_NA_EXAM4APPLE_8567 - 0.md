Answer-to-Question-_2_

The ultimate goal of criminal law should be justice, and that justice relies on creating a generation of
lawyers who can go out and combat injustice across the spectrum of the criminal system. However, much
as I wish otherwise, 1Ls are not Myrmidons to stride fully-formed into the battle; most of us have little
enough exposure to the criminal law and those of us who have seen its workings have often only seen a
small part of it. Thus, even though I appreciate and fully support this class' heavy emphasis on calling out
the myriad injustices of our system, I would respectfully favor a strategy that places emphasis on doctrinal
concerns and uses theoretical readings and discussions to supplement and expand upon them. This is not to
say that the theoretical aspects are to be removed; indeed, some are excellent for creating a well-prepared
and thoughtful student. However, I would strongly advocate against removing doctrine for the sake of
theory in this class, as it risks leaving us unprepared to serve as effective advocates for real change in the

long term.

One might look as an example to the doctrine of vagueness. This doctrine is a vital part of challenging
violations of human rights by people in positions of authority; it is for a reason that those wishing to
suppress the views and ideas of others make the laws designed to do so as broad and nonspecific as
possible, so as to allow them to pick and choose who to punish. Training students in this doctrine and
providing the example of Morales v. Chicago does more to create an informed group of future advocates
than any amount of theoretical reading, since it teaches us both what to look out for and what arguments to
use to defeat it. A malicious law may hide its vagueness and its true intent, but analyzing vagueness

doctrine allows us to spot it when we might otherwise have missed the danger.

But how, we might ask, are we to frame a challenge to such a law? The Collapse of the Harm Principle
helps answer this question and provides an example of a theoretical argument that is incorporated into the
idea of creating a well-prepared 1L. This article helped prepare us for how to argue an idea both inside and
outside of the classroom by demonstrating the paradigm shift of punishment justification to comparisons of
harm, rather than morality for its own sake. I, for one, was not specifically aware of this idea before the

reading, but now that I am I see it throughout the criminal system. This is the new language of justification,

both for limiting and expanding punishments, and teaching us to speak it effectively was a valuable part of

the course.

The inclusion of discussions on police use of force marked another example of doctrine and theory striking
an effective balance when used concurrently. By analyzing doctrinal examples like the New York Penal
Law and the MPC, we went beyond the moral discussions around the issue to engage with how to
effectively hold officers who violate their oaths accountable, and how to think legally around how force is
and can be justified by the state. When challenging a force as entrenched and influential as the state itself,
those seeking reform need to be able to take it on through the use of its own tools, rather than purely from
the outside. The theoretical underpinnings of state violence do not necessarily provide the tools to

challenge it, and that is where this course plays a vital role in preparing students to do so.

However, again, theories of justice can and should be employed to expand on the doctrinal ideas. Hearing
from Omavi Shukur and discussing how he struck a balance between his principles and the desire of his
client for justice within the criminal system was one of the most engaging discussions in the class, and
while not technically a reading I certainly would consider it as a perfect example of the sort of theoretical
engagement that brings the doctrine to life. The theoretical quandry of attempting to hold police
accountable within a system designed to protect them is one that we will continue to grapple with for the
foreseeable future, and thus a theoretical discussion of how to do that while maintaining one's principles is
vital. Many of the future lawyers in our course have views that will conflict with those of their clients, or
even of the systems in which they are required to operate. Discussing how to strike the balance between the
necessity to operate within the criminal system and the need to advance principles of reform and change is

exactly what we need to engage with so that we can emulate it in our own careers.

A final example is the effective interplay between discussing doctrines around the death penalty and the
theoretical questions around the same. Engaging with the MPC and other statutes specifying how people
can be put to death gave many of us, myself included, their first in-depth look at precisely how courts mete
out the ultimate punishment. Reading cases like Gregg, Atkins, and McCleskey allowed us to watch how
the Supreme Court has addressed and either restricted or defended the death penalty over the years. For
many in this class seeking to eliminate the death penalty, but particularly those hoping to enter capital

defense, beginning their foray into criminal law with the statutes and cases themselves is vital to allowing

them to effectively argue their points to a public that still clings to the idea that death is necessary.

With this context, Sober Second Thoughts offered an effective explanation for why the death penalty

persists, and how its proponents make it palatable to the general public. Without the case law and the
doctrinal discussions, analysis of the types of legitimation which the death penalty relies on would be either
unhelpful or incomprehensible. Knowing how people are sentenced to death, and what arguments might be
used to stop it, is rather more useful in my mind than knowing why the death penalty is legitimized, at least
in a 1L course. When paired with practical discussions of the law, articles like Sober Second Thoughts are

highly valuable, but we must first have the basic knowledge to understand and engage with them.

Ultimately, I am unable to say exactly what the balance between doctrine and theory should be, but I do
firmly believe that minimizing doctrine in favor of theory would not be an effective way to train us to
make a real difference. Regrettably, the world into which my class will graduate is one in which political
divisions turn nearly every theoretical issue, especially issues around combatting injustice in our legal
system, into something which large portions of the country will disagree with almost instinctively. If we
are to maintain the legitimacy necessary to make change in spite of this ingrained and instinctive
resistance, we must be able to engage opponents on a field that they choose to believe is legitimate, namely
in a discussion of the law itself and an application of that law to our principles. Thus, the course should
continue to place a priority on the sort of doctrinal curriculum that will allow us to prevail on this field,
while using theoretical readings and discussions to supplement and enhance our knowledge and creativity

as we engage with these deep-seated legal issues.
