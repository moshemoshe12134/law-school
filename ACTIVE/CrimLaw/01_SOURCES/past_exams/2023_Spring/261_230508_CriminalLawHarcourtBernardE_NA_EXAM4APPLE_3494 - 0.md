Answer-to-Question-_1_

Question 1:

A reasonable jury could find that Corley's confession is more credible than Wilson's statement,
especially in light of the fact that the numerous injuries described by the forensic pathologist more closely
resemble the result of the multiple strikes Corley describes than the single strike described by Wilson. In
this situation, from the forensic pathologist's description, it seems that Corley's strikes to the head would
have caused the death. The case then becomes a question of accomplice liability. As per MPC §2.06, if
Wilson satisfies the same mens rea requirement as the underlying crime while assisting in its commission,
he is liable. In this case, defense can argue that he demonstrated no specific intent to kill, and should thus
not be liable for capital murder under the Alabama statute. However, Wilson does appear to meet the mens
rea standard for felony murder under MPC §210.2(1)(b). If a reasonable jury might find Corley's
confession credible, she could be directly culpable for the killing of Walker. If not for capital murder under
the Alabama statute, at least for felony murder as per MPC §210.2(1)(b), which states that criminal
homicide constitutes murder when it is, among other possibilities, "committed recklessly under
circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life" and that "such recklessness and
indifference are presumed if the actor is engaged or is an accomplice in the commission of, or an attempt to
commit ... robbery ... [or] burglary." Both requirements appear to be satisfied here. Her defense might
attempt to argue incompetence under §4.04 depending on what her medications and mental illnesses are,
but at a glance Corley does not appear to "lack capacity to understand the proceedings against [her]," at

least not any more than the average person without a legal background.

The Alabama Attorney General could argue that Corley's confession is outside the realm of what a juror
could reasonably believe. It conflicts with her own prior testimony, describes the split of assets as
occurring between three individuals rather than the four known conspirators, and is light on detail
regarding where the killing took place. If Wilson's telling of events is taken to be more accurate aside from
underselling the extent to which he beat Walker, there is a solid case for capital murder under the Alabama
statute. It is fairly clear cut that the offense took place during a burglary as defined in MPC §221.1. Wilson
entered the residence with intent to commit a crime therein, in this case stealing a laptop. Defense might
argue that he enjoyed license or privilege to enter based on his previous visit, but given that he broke in via
enlarging a hole in the wall of the home's storage area, this is a weak argument. What is critical for the
Attorney General is that the specific intent of causing death be proved, while the defense would argue mere

recklessness. Given the sheer number of head wounds caused with a metal baseball bat, one could argue

Extegrity Exam4 > 23.0.2.64 Section All Page 3 of 6

death was virtually certain absent assistance, which Wilson chose not to seek. People do survive being
clubbed over the head with metal implements, but people also survive gunshot wounds. If the Attorney
General fails to convincingly argue ths, it would be a lesser crime, murder under MPC §210.2. Ifa
reasonable jury would not find Corley's confession credible, and instead takes Wilson's statement as closer
to the truth, Corley's involvement in Walker's death was much more remote. In this instance, she would be
part of a conspiracy to commit burglary and theft, which perhaps involved discussion of "knocking
[Walker] out," but murder was not the offense she intended to facilitatate. Neither was she present or a
participant when it occurred. As per the MPC, she would not be held liable for the homicide in these

circumstances.

The defense's argument appears somewhat stronger. While Corley's testimony does have some oddities,
it is not beyond the realm of what a reasonable juror could find credible. However Wilson does appear to
satisfy the demands of accomplice liability, though the intent involved appears to fall short of the standard
demanded by the Alabama statute, which requires specific intent to cause death. Defense arguments for
mitigating the severity of this defense to manslaughter appear weak, however. As such, standard MPC

§210.2 murder seems the most appropriate level of homicide for Wilson.

As per MPC §210.6, an individual guilty of murder under the MPC may not be sentenced to death if
"although the evidence suffices to sustain the verdict, it does not foreclose all doubt respecting the
defendant's guilt." In this case the nature of Wilson's guilt, if not the guilt itself, does not appear perfectly
clear cut. More pertinently, the law requires an aggravating circumstance to be present. here, the sole
aggravating circumstance which fits the bill is that the killing occurred while Wilson was engaged in a
burglary or robbery. Given that this aggravating circumstance is identical to that which is included in the
Alabama statute but with a lower mens rea standard, it seems against the legislature's intent to treat the
death penalty as valid here. If not, the standard in the capital murder statute would be set at the lower level
represented in MPC §210.2(1)(b). There are also mitigating circumstances present: Wilson is not stated to
have a significant history of prior criminal activity, and his description of emotional disturbance appears
credible. It is unlikely that this emotional disturbance, caused by fear that Walker was armed and aware of
his presence, would mitigate the crime down to manslaughter. After all, while interpretation of the
mitigation provision is intended to be from the viewpoint of a reasonable person in the actor's situation,
courts are intended to avoid idiosyncratic moral values which would not arouse sympathy in the ordinary
citizen. However, it may be sufficient to argue for leniency in regards to the death penalty. In light of these

factors, the death sentence meted out by the trial court does not appear valid.

Answer-to-Question-_2_

Question 2:

Is it necessary to know criminal law doctrine to make or rebut abolitionist arguments? Perhaps not. Is it
useful? Absolutely. Abolitionist critique is not predicated upon a legal education, but as individuals
undergoing such an education we are well suited to make those critiques which are. Some might argue that
a significant portion of the class will never engage with abolition to any extent, while criminal law doctrine
will be important to pass the bar. As such, they might say, the class should be more doctrinal. I firmly
disagree with this notion, as it inappropriately cements the idea of the criminal law as correct and

unassailable. The course should, as it has, focus on doctrine but temper it with abolitionist theory.

It is something of a cliché to reference Sun Tzu, but there is truth to his maxim of knowing one's enemy.
It is difficult to argue that substantial knowledge of criminal law cannot be useful in understanding its
injustices. However, to portray this as strictly necessary denies the validity and significance of abolitionist
arguments made by those without a legal education. This is both factually and morally incorrect,
discounting the contribution of those with significant lived experiences, among others. Many strong
arguments for abolition do not revolve around minutiae of legal doctrine, but concepts anyone can
understand. While Hoag-Fordjour's "Valuing Black Lives" is undoubtedly legal scholarship, the
fundamental basis of its argument is the "dehumanization, violence, and racial degradation" inherent to the
death penalty. More specific legal knowledge factors in to Hoag-Fordjour's argument against "tinkering
with the machinery of death," serving as empirical evidence to support the claim that no mere alteration
would solve things, but it is not required to make the central point. It does not require an education in
criminal law doctrine to realize that Black lives are systematically undervalued, whether they are victims of
crime or individuals facing the prospect of state violence. However, doctrine provides one useful angle of
approach, one that we as law students and lawyers are best equipped to make use of. A lawyer with
knowledge of death penalty doctrine knows to discuss McCleskey, can point to post-Furman failure to

meaningfully enforce the death penalty without gross racial inequity, and can best identify where criminal

Extegrity Exam4 > 23.0.2.64 Section All Page 5 of 6

statutes might be vulnerable to Constitutional or other arguments. As such, people in general might not
need to know doctrine and can certainly take other approaches to abolition, but we specifically should if we

aim to make effective use of our skillset and position.

However, an excessive focus on criminal law doctrine bears the risk that students will take it as
axiomatically correct. It is easy to fall into the trap of accepting the lie that criminal law is some objective
and dispassionate system, divorced from worldly political power, which strips away the subjective and
false in order to reveal perfect truth and impose proper consequence. Foucault's critique on knowledge and
power in his lecture on "Truth and Juridical Forms" is important reading, well-suited to puncturing this
idea. Foucault convincingly argues that knowledge and power are inextricably linked, and that this does
not merely take the form of obvious outside impositions by the "powerful." Rather, what we believe to be
"true" is determined by the complex web of power relationships which comprise the social order we
inhabit, a social order whose shape and assumptions may be difficult to fully comprehend from the inside.
This is something which we do not instinctively examine; why critique what feels axiomatic? Looking at
the evolution of criminal law doctrine, and some of its present injustices, shows us why this theory is so
important. The manner in which the criminal law has treated women is especially illustrative here: In
earlier times, few discussing the law would even consider that the denial of marital rape's existence, or the
assertion that a "reasonable man" (a construction which carries substantial unstated assumptions) might kill
his wife if she commits adultery, were a means of enforcing and sustaining a power structure in which
women are subservient to men. Though most if not all of us might find this repugnant today, they would
simply see these ideas and the accompanying criminal law doctrines as the natural truth, failing to view
them as the product of power structures and therefore potentially unjust. To deny that current doctrines
might be the product of a similar myopia is transparent hubris. A clear example lies in current doctrine
which enables police use of deadly force. The machine of the criminal justice system produces evidence,
conducts a trial, and more often than not declares a police killing lawful based on a social context which
accepts this as a correct means of dealing with the "suspected criminal" othered class of person. This
becomes "truth", a "truth" which conveniently legitimizes the disproportionate killing of Black men and the
preservation of a white-dominated social order. In doing so, the lie that power and truth are separate has
shut down discussions which should have been had, and actions which should have been taken. In a similar
vein, Robert Cover's essay on the inescapable but oft-denied or simply unseen and unacknowledged
connection between legal interpretation and violence, pain, fear, and death, is the sort of thing a student
focusing entirely on doctrine might never consider. The disparate experience of those imposing state
violence versus those having said violence inflicted upon them by legal interpretation, are something a

student might see as simply "the way things work" that nobody is responsible for, rather than a choice or


261 261

Extegrity Exam4 > 23.0.2.64 Section All Page 6 of 6

result of choices. This is especially dangerous given how much of our legal education seems geared
towards priming us to instinctively shift as much responsibility as possible away from ourselves or those
we represent and onto others. It is all too easy to retreat into the idea that legal interpretation is
dispassionate and peaceful rather than, in many cases, a choice to perform violence. For these reasons, it is
important to include substantial readings on abolition and similar thought. Preferably this would occur
relatively early in the class, as it did for us. Frontloading this reading, before taking cases' holdings as
truthful without examination becomes habit, provides less opportunity for the meme of criminal law's

objectivity to take hold and for our social order to be mistaken for the "natural order."

I hesitate to answer this variety of question with "Yes, keep up the good work," because it strikes me as
substantially less useful than critique. However, here | believe that your intuition, that the focus of an
introductory criminal law course should be primarily doctrinal but contain substantial abolition and
abolition-adjacent readings, is correct. It may be possible to quibble about the exact proportions or timings,
to argue for one more reading or one less at one time or another, but the approach itself is sound. Through
it, we gain the requisite knowledge to pass the bar and go on with our lives as lawyers, but also the tools to
best use our skillset and qualifications to abolitionist ends. Most importantly it forces us to acknowledge
the choices being made in the furtherance of our justice system are indeed choices, not truth. Even if this
amounts to little in the lives of some students, it is better for the inhabitants of Le Guin's Omelas to be
aware of the suffering their society enables and is enabled by in turn. We deserve the opportunity to choose

to walk away from Omelas or, better yet, to stay and fight it.
