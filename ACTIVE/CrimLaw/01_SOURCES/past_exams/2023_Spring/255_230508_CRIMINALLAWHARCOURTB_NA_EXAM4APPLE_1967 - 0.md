Corley

The prosecution will likely not want to lend too much weight to the Corley letter, and in turn will
limit charges to the other evidence. They will likely face difficulty charging her with conspiracy to murder
as they did not know he was home (no reckless homicide under MPC), but should be able to charge for

theft (and potential necrophilia charges).

Conclusion

While Petitioner generally has the stronger arguments here as a matter of fact, they do not change
the ultimate outcome as a matter of law. A reasonable jury could have found each of the requisite elements
here beyond a reasonable doubt, and there is not sufficient evidence to demonstrate they relied on evidence

that should have been excluded. Accordingly, the court should deny Wilson’s challenge.

That being said, you should strongly urge future trial courts to use special questions: had the jury

been asked what evidence had been used, this case could have been resolved differently

Answer-to-Question-_2__

Good lawyering requires not just an appeal to black-letter law and doctrine, but also a knowledge
of how to connect your case to the public interest and the potential impact of a decision on a client. As a
future public defender, I found that the class struck the proper balance between theories of punishment and
doctrine. On one hand, | found the discussion of legal theory informative for crafting future arguments. On
the other, learning about the doctrines informed my understanding of how public defenders can play a role

in the broader movement for criminal justice. To this effect, the balance between theory and doctrine was

effective as it helped me better understand the relationship between the “law on the books” and the “law in

practice.”

Critical Theory: Helping Craft Legal Arguments

Our discussion of Kelman informed my approach to developing narratives for clients. While the
bulk of my law school experience thus far has focused on what the law “says” or the proper outcome on the
books, our critical theory readings suggested that this might not be the best way for a defense counsel to
approach a case. Looking to the law first and working backwards to assess how a client’s fact pattern
comports with the law involves the use of unconscious interpretive constructs which will inevitably change

our ultimate conception of the legal outcome.

Recognizing the role that these constructs impact decisions permits lawyers to actually identify
how they might better use said constructs to the benefit of a client. Consider Kelman’s example of time
framing. Identifying the importance of time framing for legal analysis permits a deeper insight into how
doctrines that involve immediacy or provocation might be understood by a jury. Indeed, the battle in a case
might actually come down on what time frame is accepted by the court. While narrow or broad time frames
are not universally helpful for defense counsel, identifying the role of this interpretive construct early in
practice and then shaping the contours of the case accordingly should provide a clear advantage to the
client. Limiting the time period to restrict discussions of precipitation may prove vital in minimizing
homicide charges, while the opposite may be the case for a defendant who kills when a doctrine requires

immediacy.

To this effect, the volition doctrine is illustrative. Consider a vehicular homicide case of a diabetic
driver with a seizure brought on by their medicine. Whether there was any volition necessary for an actus
reus depends first and foremost on the boundaries of the time. As Martin v. State demonstrates, narrowing
the permissible time for discussion is helpful for a defense here. By limiting the timeline, defense can
restrict the discussion of volitive elements to the car. And yet, Decina illustrates that the alternative is
likely fatal: bringing in the medicine and the decision to drive permits the prosecution to identify a

volitional act.

In turn, the Kelman reading instructs lawyers how to look past the black letter “law on the books”
and identify which key interpretive constructs might be determinative in a case — an undoubtedly helpful

approach.

Steiker & Steiker: Recognizing the Impact of Procedural Victories

Steiker & Steiker’s (S&S) analysis also complemented the general doctrinal approach by urging
lawyers to recognize the potential impacts of doctrines and decisions that appear facially helpful to clients.
In my experience at law school thus far, the vast majority of my classes champion the procedural approach
employed largely by the Warren Court (whether that be the Charles Reich-ian New Property Due Process
approach to distributive justice or Gideon-style criminal procedure safeguards). They often paint these
procedural rights as sufficient bulwarks against tyranny and generally discuss them uncritically in their

formal doctrinal context.

And yet, S&S’s research speaks to the fact that procedural safeguards (and indeed the very focus
on procedure) might over-proceduralize material issues to the detriment of clients. As S&S note, the
regulatory procedure approach lends itself to legitimation. In other words, the singular approach on formal
defensive rights “on the books” may actually lead to material harms in practice. These same critiques
extend beyond the death penalty, and should be considered for other criminal procedural safeguards like

the right to counsel.

I found this discussion informative when discussing the insanity defense. By looking at the
insanity defense solely through its formal doctrinal application, the Kahler court was able to effectively gut
the core of the doctrine. By all means, the law on the books in Kansas appears to include some insanity
defense. And yet, no one actually argues that the M ’Naghten test is the necessary regulatory element here:
it’s the complete destruction of the moral culpability principle through the collapsed mens rea. The
contours of this doctrine go to show the impact of focusing on procedural regulatory safeguards: they may

normalize and legitimate otherwise unfathomable normative concepts.

In practice, the S&S reading speaks to the need for lawyers to consider the value of procedural
victories. While these formal safeguards are no doubt important, they may project an illusion of justice that
may either be unhelpful more broadly or even denied in practice. Public defenders should avoid over-
reliance on these doctrines and help clients understand how these safeguards may actually work to their

detriment.

Even more so, the Steikers’ critique of procedure is informative of the insufficiency of defensive

safeguards for broader justice and speaks to the need for defensive lawyers to recognize their necessary but

insufficient role in the broader movement context.

Foucault: Informing Broader Understanding of Contemporary Justice

While I cannot tell whether Discipline & Punish is normative, Foucault’s analysis on broader
punishment speaks to the extent that the system is designed to harm indigent clients. By unraveling the
image of society’s neutrality and recognizing the extent to which the modern state improves upon the
control mechanisms of the Ancien Regime, Foucault demonstrates the extent to which the system currently

punishes people for their identities.

As structures of discipline and punishment are employed to shape human beings and reinforce
social structures, defensive lawyering cannot be sufficient for legal agents attempting to bring about fair
enforcement of the law and better outcomes for marginalized groups. To this effect, Foucault’s takeaway

about the nature of these structures goes in tandem with Steiker’s — substantive structural change is needed.

However, identifying how even purportedly neutral laws serve horrid class control functions
permits lawyers to identify how defensive lawyering can ultimately serve movement needs. I found this
was complemented by our discussion of the felony murder rule. Reading about cases like Adnan Khan
demonstrated how the rule is employed to incarcerate folks as a means of class control. Learning the
doctrine here thus served a different purpose: teaching me how I might challenging the rule in the future.
Indeed, recognizing the lack of mens rea (outside of the MPC) or causation needed provides an avenue for

potentially impactful future challenges.

Conclusion

Though the focus on theory may have taken us away from doctrine at times, I have no doubt that
learning about the theories of punishment will be helpful for my practice. Not only has it provided me with
a better understanding of how to approach a case, but it also will inform my assessment of how to approach
legal change. Ultimately, the balance struck in class has helped me put the “law on the books” in important

context which will certainly improve my public defense practice in the future.
