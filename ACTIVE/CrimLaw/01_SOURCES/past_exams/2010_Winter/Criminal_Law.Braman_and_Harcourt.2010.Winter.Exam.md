CRIMINAL LAW
PROFESSORS DON BRAMAN AND BERNARD HARCOURT
FALL 2009 AND WINTER 2010
FINAL EXAMINATION

This is an open-book, three hour, in-class examination. You may refer to any materials you like,
including books, treatises, notes, and on-line materials, but you may not talk to or confer with
anyone else.

This examination consists of __6_ pages total (including this cover sheet).

This examination consists of two parts that will be graded evenly (50% and 50%). The first part
corresponds to the first quarter taught by Don Braman. The second part corresponds to the second
quarter taught by Bernard Harcourt. You should spend 90 minutes on each part since they will be
weighed equally toward the final grade.

Don Braman’s part consists of 2 questions that will be graded evenly (50% and 50%). Bernard
Harcourt’s part consists of two questions that will also be graded evenly (50% and 50%). So you
should spend 45 minutes on each question.

You may answer the questions in any order that suits you. Please begin the answer to each
question on a new page, noting clearly the question that you are responding to. Each exam answer
page should include a header containing your student exam number, the name of the examination,
and the pagination, specifying the last page (e.g. “Student 3547, Criminal Law, page 3 of 12”).

Please double space your answers with one-inch margins and use a 12 point New Times Roman
font.

Your answers should be specifically tailored to the questions. You should not cut and paste any
materials from your notes or from anywhere else. In fact, if you feel tempted to cut and paste
materials from your notes, you should immediately think to yourself that the materials are not
sufficiently tailored to the question that we are asking.

If you think you need more information to answer a question, or if you think something is
ambiguous, please explain what you need or what is ambiguous, and then make whatever
assumptions you need to make in order to answer the question.

Good luck on the exam and have a great break.

Don Braman and Bernard Harcourt


Harcourt Question |

You just got to the office and found the following case file on your desk. It concerns a
defendant named Stan Smith who has been charged by the state with (1) conspiracy to tamper
with a witness; (2) attempted tampering with a witness; (3) tampering with a witness; (4)
solicitation to tamper with a witness, and (5) attempted manslaughter (under an accomplice
liability theory).

Your jurisdiction has just adopted the Model Penal Code with only one change regarding
the provision on witness tampering. On that provision, your jurisdiction adopted the following
statute:

Witness Tampering. Whoever kills or attempts to kill another person, or uses physical
force or the threat of physical force against any person, or attempts to do so, with the
intent to or knowing that his actions will influence or prevent the testimony of any person
in a judicial or official proceeding, shall be guilty of tampering with a witness. A person
can only be found guilty of this offense if they acted knowingly or willfully with the intent
to influence the testimony of a witness. A conviction for witness tampering will be
considered a felony in the case of a homicide or attempted homicide or the use of physical
force; it shall be a misdemeanor in the case of the threatened us of physical force or an
attempt.

Your jurisdiction does not have any case law under its new code, so the courts will have to
interpret the new code from scratch. (Being somewhat insecure, the local courts tend to be
impressed by decisions from any other court from any other jurisdiction).

The facts are as follows. Stan Smith was involved in a car accident at 3 a.m. on
Woodlawn and 58" Street. Smith ran through the stop sign in front of Booth Chicago and collided
into Harvey Jackson’s car. Smith was intoxicated and when he got out of his car, he apologized
profusely to Jackson, telling him that he was really sorry and had had one drink too many. When
the University of Chicago police arrived, they wrote up the accident, but before they could fully
interview Smith or Jackson, they got called to a frat house on a 911 emergency.

The following day, Smith contacted a friend, Joe Montgomery, and told him about the
accident. Montgomery said he actually knew Jackson (he’d had a run-in with him over a bet on a
World Series game a few days earlier) and intimated that he might be able to get him to keep quiet
about the fact that Smith had told him he was drunk. Smith said to Montgomery “that would be
really cool.” The following day, Montgomery tracked down Jackson and found him at Jimmy’s on
55" Street. They were both at the bar. Montgomery asked Jackson “Do you know Stan Smith?
Well, he asked me to tell you to try and forget what he said after the accident. He said it
would be better for you.” Jackson was aggravated by the tone of Montgomery’s comment and
told Montgomery to come outside with him.

When they got onto the sidewalk, Jackson immediately punched Montgomery real
hard in the stomach. Montgomery fell to the sidewalk and stumbled into the street. He then
sprang up and jabbed Jackson in the face, knocking him over into the building. Jackson
reached into the inside pocket of his jacket and started pulling out something shiny that
glittered in the sunlight. As he was doing that, Montgomery grabbed a broken piece of piping
that was lying next to the lamppost and swung it hard into Jackson’s head, who immediately
fell to the ground, blood splattering all over the place.


By this time, the firemen from the station next door were running to the scene, and
Montgomery ran off, yelling at Jackson that he’d get him if he said anything about anything to
anyone. The firemen took Jackson to the station and drove him in an ambulance to the
University of Chicago Emergency Room. Jackson was in critical condition, but survived the
incident.

Your boss wants to know what the best arguments are for the prosecution and for Smith’s
defense, and what the likely outcome will be in the case. She wants a quick memo. Specifically,
she wants to know three things:

(1) What defenses you think Smith could raise;

(2) How will the prosecution respond to those defenses; and

(3) Whether you think the defense or the prosecution would have the better of the
argument and why.

Please write a memo addressing these questions. Please be specific about the defense(s)
and the response(s) and discuss the relevant facts.

Harcourt Question 2

Carol Steiker and Jordan Steiker conclude their article, Sober Second Thoughts (1995, p. 438),
on the following note: “It is deeply ironic that the impulse to abolish and reform the death penalty has
produced a body of law that contributes substantially to the stabilization and perpetuation of capital
punishment as a social practice. We are left with the worst of all possible worlds: the Supreme Court’s
detailed attention to death penalty law has generated negligible improvements over the pre-Furman
era, but has helped people to accept without second thoughts—much less ‘sober’ ones—our
profoundly failed system of capital punishment.”

How would the following theorists react to this claim: (1) Gary Becker or Richard Posner; (2)
Robert Hale or Mark Kelman; (3) Don Braman, Duncan Kennedy, Ronald Dworkin, or Robert
Ellickson. Please pick one theorist from each of the three groups and discuss.

The best way to address this question is for you to make an argument of your own that weaves
in these other three views. Please make sure to weigh in yourself and make an argument.


Each question is worth 25% of your final grade.
Braman Question 3.

You’re boss, Senator Sartorial, calls you into her office. She says, “take a look at this
proposed revision of the rape law that Senator Margolis just introduced. It looks like she’s
trying to simplify the law.” She hands you a slip of paper. The proposed law is extremely
short, reading: Rape in the first degree is sexual intercourse with another person without his
or her consent accompanied by physical injury to that person. Rape in the second degree is
sexual intercourse with another person without his or her consent. Children and anyone
whose cognitive capacities are substantially limited or impaired (either permanently or by
intoxication), by law, shall not be deemed capable of consenting to sexual intercourse.
There’s a ‘Romeo and Juliet’ exception as well. “But,” Sartorial asks you, “is it really
possible to make rape law that simple? Should there be a force requirement? What about
mistakes about consent? Would cases you know about come out differently under this
statute? What would the pros and cons of adopting this law be?” Cite relevant cases and
materials from the readings.

Braman Question 4:

Your boss, Eric Holder, calls you into his office. "We have a serious problem on our hands.
Sit down and read this." He hands you the following statute:

TITLE 42 - CHAPTER 21D - DETAINEE TREATMENT - Sec. 2000dd-1. Protection of
United States Government personnel engaged in authorized interrogations

(a) In any civil action or criminal prosecution against an officer, employee, member of
the Armed Forces, or other agent of the United States Government who is a United
States person, arising out of the officer, employee, member of the Armed Forces,
or other agent's engaging in specific operational practices, that involve detention
and interrogation of aliens who the President or his designees have determined are
believed to be engaged in or associated with international terrorist activity that
poses a serious, continuing threat to the United States, its interests, or its allies, and
that were officially authorized and determined to be lawful at the time that they
were conducted, it shall be a defense that such officer, employee, member of the
Armed Forces, or other agent did not know that the practices were unlawful and a
person of ordinary sense and understanding would not know the practices were
unlawful. Good faith reliance on advice of counsel should be an important factor,
among others, to consider in assessing whether a person of ordinary sense and
understanding would have known the practices to be unlawful. Nothing in this
section shall be construed to limit or extinguish any defense or protection
otherwise available to any person or entity from suit, civil or criminal liability, or
damages, or to provide immunity from prosecution for any criminal offense by the
proper authorities.

[this provision is retroactive]

“As you know,” Holder continues, “John Yoo wrote a memo dated 8/1/2002 authorizing
waterboarding while he was at OLC. He clearly hadn’t done a Lexis search when he wrote it.


Nevertheless, we’ve since found that his memo, while wrong on the law, did not violate our
code of professional conduct. Well, that would have been the end of it except that we just
found a taped conversation dated one month prior to the date of the memo. Have a listen and
read along on the transcript.”

[begin transcript]

VP Cheney: Addy. We have a &$%$&@!!$ of a problem. We're this close to finding bin
Laden, but our agents are refusing to waterboard suspects with intelligence because they're
afraid of criminal prosecution. They think waterboarding is torture and the surrender
monkeys are waving federal anti-torture statutes like the color-guard in a high school parade.
What can we do to give these invertebrates some spine?

David Addington (VP Cheney’s Chief of Staff): The Executive can use all necessary means
to defend the nation. I believe the President can legally order them to torture suspects if you
believe it necessary to protect the nation. Not only did Congress authorize it, but the
Constitution clearly states ...[cut off]

Cheney: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Great. Like POTUS is going to sign off on waterboarding. Some
times I think he’s as spineless as our lawyers. Look, I need a legal opinion that says
waterboarding is not torture. Apparently no one can be prosecuted if they’re relying on a
legal opinion — something about the way the statute is written. Can you find me someone we
can trust to do the right thing here?

Addington: I’ve got just the man for you. He’s over at the OLC [Office of the Legal Counsel] .
Cheny: OK, but don’t have him talk to anyone else —1 want him to give the memo directly to
you. The rest of the lawyers over at OLC would have a field day with this if they caught wind
of it. They couldn ’t be trusted to do the right thing if al Queda blew up their office.

[end of transcript]

Holder then says to you: “Look, that’s all the evidence we have. I need you to figure out
whether there is a case that can be made against any of the parties in case we have to. Other
people are working on issue of whether waterboarding is torture and illegal. For your part,
just assume it is torture and that it is a felony. The question I want you to think about is who
will be liable and how the memo, recording, and Sec 200dd-1 fit in. There are four cases for
you to evaluate — so give the strengths and weaknesses and any possible defenses they might
raise.

CIA officer Bonald Hraman waterboarded a suspect in July of 2002 (before the OLC Memo
was written) and in June of 2004 (after the OLC Memo was written). He claims that in both
instances Addington told him it was legal and that in the second instance Addington gave him
the memo. Apparently he also recruited a civilian trained in anti-terrorism interrogation
techniques, Dernard Barcourt, to assist in the interrogations. Barcourt claims that officer
Hraman said he was authorized by the White House to perform the waterboarding and, in the
latter instance, showed him the OLC memo. Hraman and Barcorut further stated that, in the
former case, he was told by Addington (and subsequently told Barcourt) that “an imminent



attack on US soil was likely if we didn’t obtain certain information from the suspect in timely
manner.”

In addition to Hraman and Barcourt, I want you to evaluate Cheney and Addington as
possible accomplices or co-conspirators to Hraman and Barcourt. [For the purposes of this
question, assume that federal law follows the MPC on accomplice liability and conspiracy in
all relevant particulars.] Again, I want the strongest arguments on both sides of each charge
and possible defenses they might raise. Also raise any policy arguments you think are
relevant.
