Criminal Law: Braman and Harcourt

Harcourt Q. 1:

I will now analyze each charge.

(1) Conspiracy to tamper with a witness

Defense: Conspiracy involves an agreement to commit a crime (although it can be
interpreted broadly). Smith would naturally try to obtain as narrow an interpretation as
possible. He would argue that he and Montgomery never agreed to “tamper with the
witness.” The tampering with a witness provision involves the use of some sort of threat
of physical violence, and Montomgery simply stated that he could get Jackson to “keep
quiet” without being specific. Smith would contend that Montgomery could have carried
out his task in any number of non-violent ways, e.g. offering Jackson money or
convincing Jackson that it would be nice for Smith to “owe” Jackson. In conclusion,
Smith would contend that he had no knowledge of Montgomery’s intended actions, and
therefore he lacked the requisite mens rea. Even though he may have behaved
negligently by not inquiring into Montgomery’s methods, he could cite the fact that the
negligence standard is not spelled out as the criteria for conspiracy in the MPC. Finally,
Smith might cite cases such as Krulewitch (even though they are not controlling in this
situation) for arguments against an expansive application of conspiracy law; McDermott,
where the court required some level of knowledge, would provide another example.
Prosecution Response: The prosecution would respond by pressing for a broad
interpretation of conspiracy. They might cite Anderson, where the defendant knew that
the party with which the defendant allegedly conspired was in the business of providing
abortions. Perhaps, on a similar note, Smith should have known that Montgomery was

“in the business” of intimidation. By showing that Smith anticipated Montgomery’s


Exam #2 Winter 2010 Page 2 of 20
Criminal Law: Braman and Harcourt

actions, the prosecution could show that the knowledge requirement existed. The
prosecution would probably try to find evidence that Smith knew about Montgomery’s
violent tendencies. It would also help the prosecution case if it could demonstrate that
Smith knew that Montgomery’s past interaction with Jackson had involved a bitter “run-
in.”

Conclusion: Unless the prosecution produces some strong evidence (as I’ve suggested
above) in support of their conspiracy argument, they will probably fail.

(2) Attempted tampering with a witness

Defense: Attempt requires that an individual act with the kind of culpability otherwise
required for the crime. The defense would argue in response to this standard that Smith
lacked the mens rea required for witness tampering, which requires “intent or
knowledge.” Indeed, courts have found that it is not possible to “attempt” something
through negligence (see case with trucker shooting at girls). The arguments would be
quite similar to those cited in the conspiracy case: Smith may have been negligent in
encouraging Montgomery to try to keep Jackson silent in some manner, but Smith
certainly didn’t know that Montgomery would act violently. Finally, without even
considering the rest of the MPC, the defense could draw on the plain text of the witness
tampering provision, which seems to assume that the actor charged with the crime is
actually the one performing the physical threat/violence. In case the witness tampering is
interpreted as a result crime (the “tampering” with the witness is the result), the mens rea
requirement would be slightly different, but a knowledge minimal standard would still

exist in essence—therefore, the defense would use the same arguments.


Exam #2 Winter 2010 Page 3 of 20
Criminal Law: Braman and Harcourt

Prosecution: The prosecution could use the same arguments that I cited for the previous
charge: they could show that Smith effectively knew that Montgomery would behave
violently, in which case Smith was clearly “attempting” (or at least knowingly
consenting) to the crime. The prosecution might also try to shift the framework of
analysis by arguing that the “attempt” mens rea should apply only to Smith’s desire to
keep Jackson “quiet.”

Conclusion: As mentioned earlier, the prosecution would have a stronger case if they
could present evidence that Smith actually knew about Montgomery’s violent plans (or at
least his tendencies, although this would shift the mens rea into recklessness, allowing yet
another defense). Short of such evidence, the defense will probably prevail. The
prosecution’s framework-shifting argument would not work under the MPC, because the
MPC requires (unless otherwise stated) that the requisite mens rea must apply to the
attendant circumstances as well as the actus reas.

(3) Tampering with a witness

Defense: The defense would likely cite the arguments above to good effect—if Smith
cannot even be held liable of attempt to tamper with a witness, he could not be held liable
for actually tampering with a witness. In this case, they would also emphasize (probably
to a greater effect than for (2)) the plain text of the provision, which seems to require that
the charged individual be the actual, physical actor.

Prosecution: The prosecution would respond much as it did above for the corresponding

rg 66,

defense arguments. In response to the defense’s “plain text” argument, they would
probably point out that one can have vicarious liability (although this would more

properly fall under one of the other charges).


Exam #2 Winter 2010 Page 4 of 20
Criminal Law: Braman and Harcourt

Conclusion: If the prosecution is likely to fail on the attempt charge (as I concluded
above), they are even more likely to fail on the charge itself.

(4) Solicitation

Defense: The defense would emphasize the MPC’s solicitation provision which requires
a “purpose of promoting or facilitating its commission.” Purpose is the highest mens rea
requirement under the MPC standard, and so the defense would strongly emphasize that
Smith absolutely did not act with a purpose of having Jackson “tampered” with in a
manner violating the witness tampering provision. He merely expressed satisfaction with
Montgomery’s suggestion that Montgomery might be able to keep Jackson quiet. The
defense would also attempt to show (per the prosecution argument below) that Smith
does not have any accomplice liability through any of the possible means of establishing
accomplice liability. The solicitation provision in the MPC for complicity would be
circular, (solicitation established by complicity established by solicitation), while Smith
had no legal liability for Montgomery; nor did Smith aid Montgomery in the commission
of the offense.

Prosecution: The prosecution would emphasize not the apparent “purpose” mens rea, but
rather the rest of the MPC provision, which mentions not only a command but
encouragement. Smith’s statement was certainly encouragement. They may also point
out that, as an alternative requirement, the prosecution must establish a mens rea that
would establish Smith’s complicity (his role as an accomplish). Although I will discuss
accomplice liability in the context of manslaughter below, they might emphasize that

Smith’s encouragement could be seen as a kind of aid. They would also cite cases such


Exam #2 Winter 2010 Page 5 of 20
Criminal Law: Braman and Harcourt

as Luparello, which hold that accomplice liability does not require that all defendants
exhibit the same mens rea (this might justify lowering the mens rea standard for Smith).
Conclusion: The prosecution would have a better chance of winning this argument than
some of the others, simply because courts have tended to interpret accomplice liability
broadly. Nevertheless, Luparello is not controlling in this jurisdiction, and Smith does
seem to have a stronger argument based on the plain text of the relevant material.
Ultimately, courts will probably base their decision on any number of criteria beyond the
text, such as a desire to condemn Smith’s actions (and they are timid, so other courts’
actions are influential, and therefore they are slightly more likely than not to accept
conviction (indeed, this may be up to the jury reflecting community norms). However,
Smith still has a strong chance.

(5) Accomplice liability for attempted manslaughter

Defense: As noted above, the defense would try to undermine any sort of accomplice
liability. They would repeat many of their above arguments. However, there is a
complication—manslaughter, unlike the tampering provision, only requires a reckless
mens rea (alternatively, it requires a higher mens rea but under extreme emotional
distress). But the defense would respond (again citing the trucker case) that it doesn’t
make sense to charge someone with an attempt to act recklessly. The defense might also
try to demonstrate that Montgomery himself was not guilty of attempted manslaughter—
Jackson started the physical fight, and Montgomery didn’t use a “deadly weapon”
(broken piping) or otherwise act in a manner sufficient to establish manslaughter until
after he was threatened with what appeared to be a deadly weapon (knife maybe?) by

Jackson. Finally, in response to Luparello, the defense would argue that (1) Luparello is


Exam #2 Winter 2010 Page 6 of 20
Criminal Law: Braman and Harcourt

not controlling, and (2) as the Luparello concurrence contends, the majority decision
(based on a California Supreme Court decision) isn’t sensible.

Prosecution: The prosecution would surely cite Luparello on accomplice liability. As
seen in Luparello, courts have interpreted accomplice liability very broadly—indeed, the
facts seem similar, where the alleged accomplice was not seen to specifically anticipate
the deadly results of his “encouragement.”

Conclusion: As mentioned in (4), the prosecution—notwithstanding the text-based
arguments against accomplice liability—would probably establish the basis for some sort
of accomplice liability. However, they might have some difficulty establishing that the
principle actor (Montgomery) was attempting manslaughter, especially considering that
Jackson started the physical violence and he may have been the one to escalate the fight
into a “deadly” one through possibly producing the “knife”-like item. Because they
would only have a narrow advantage on the accomplice liability to begin with and they
would have to demonstrate manslaughter as well (which would be difficult), they would

probably not secure a conviction on this point.

Harcourt Q. 2.

Steiker and Steiker argue that attempts at regulation of the death penalty through
the formal mechanisms of the law—rather than recognition of underlying, systemic
problems and injustices—will often result in failure of true reform. Indeed, the attempts
may actually compound the problems by providing a kind of muddled “cover” or
legitimation for a flawed system. They declare that the Supreme Court’s attempts at
regulation have been a “disaster, an enormous regulatory effort with almost no
rationalizing effect,” and any improvements have been negligible. Although I lack access
to all the data that the Steikers drew on for their claims, I consider their arguments highly
persuasive.

Mark Kelman’s critical theories provide perhaps the most direct support for the
Steiker position. Kelman demonstrates that the law cannot be applied in a mechanical,
formalist, consistent manner. Any attempt to do so would be illusory—there are too
many important decisions that must be made in any attempt at interpretation, and each
decision may produce a substantially different outcome. For example, the schemes that
attempt to “regulate” the death penalty, whether they use pyramids or checklists, always
require a high level of personal culpability—a culpability worthy of the ultimate social
condemnation. But individual culpability hinges upon theories of individual agency, and,
as Kelman points out, that there is no straightforward way to make this establishment.
How, for example, do we view the relevant timeframes? Do we unify the accounts?
These questions will all play into a determinism vs. agency debate. Courts, prosecutors,
and juries will all make decisions that reflect some sort of political bias, often

unconsciously, in a manner that does not seem to promote equity—for example, courts


Exam #2 Winter 2010 Page 8 of 20
Criminal Law: Braman and Harcourt

routinely reject the “rough background” defenses that apply primarily to the lower classes
by shifting the backgrounds out of the analysis timeframes. Rough backgrounds,
however, will inevitably relate to the question of agency. In addition to pointing out the
flaws with the status quo, Kelman and other critical theorists argue that attempts to lend
an appearance of formalism or apolitical mechanical nature to penal law are dishonest
and ultimately unjustly legitimate a flawed system.

Although Don Braman’s work on value-laden decision-making and perception of
facts does not directly fall within the critical theoretical framework of Kelman, I believe
that it reinforces some of the principles that Kelman (and in the case of the death penalty,
Steiker) recognize. The Kelman/Braman study finds that individuals resolve factual
ambiguities in a manner that corresponds to their values or worldviews. This more
indirect approach to expressing political values means that partisanship occurs even when
individuals conscientiously try to judge a defense (or any other position) in a non-biased
way. If perception of a situation or issue—in this case self-defense claims—hinges on
variables such as worldviews (hierarchical/egalitarian being the most significant), we can
see that Kelman’s suspicion of formalist, objective law is very well founded. While
Braman’s study focuses on perception of facts, consider that the same biases must
influence our means of constructing an analysis as described by Kelman, e.g. the
timeframe and agency questions. Juries who often impose the death penalty will not be
acting in an objective manner, regardless of how the Supreme Court orders their
decisions to be “structured.” Trial judges and prosecutors, who are also ordinary people
susceptible to various influences, play an equally important role, and Braman’s research

suggests that they will also act subconsciously (or perhaps consciously—see the judge in


Exam #2 Winter 2010 Page 9 of 20
Criminal Law: Braman and Harcourt

State v. Chaney, a case from Braman’s quarter) in a manner that is susceptible to
political/worldview biases.

A single theme has appeared through Steiker, Kelman, and Braman—individuals
may openly or consciously think that they are doing one thing (regulating the death
penalty, establishing mechanical legal principles, objectively discerning facts and
applying law apolitically), but in fact their conscious or stated aims are illusory. But it is
important to consider the Steiker critique through other perspectives, perhaps mainstream
theories. Gary Becker, a law and economics theorist, views crime as a growing social
problem. He views the issue as a question of costs to society. While Becker may be
expected to be at odds with theorists such as Kelman (indeed, Kelman specifically
opposes the mainstream law and economics approach), his analysis is not necessarily
inconsistent with Steiker’s conclusion. As we know from class, the death penalty is a
costly, drawn-out process involving numerous appeals and an expensive state apparatus.
Perhaps more importantly, as any economist would concede, the error cost is extremely
high even if the probability of error is low—assuming that we place at least a modestly
high value on human life. Finally, evidence regarding the deterrent effect of the death
penalty is inconclusive at best. Kelman is not interested in establishing the lowest
possible level of crime. Rather, he suggests that society should simply seek to minimize
the cost of crime, which takes into account “social cost” associated with both crime and
enforcement. Therefore, his utilitarian approach does not in this case necessarily
contradict (and probably, albeit for different reasons, takes the same position as) the

deontological arguments and the critical theory aimed at the death penalty.


Exam #2 Winter 2010 Page 10 of 20
Criminal Law: Braman and Harcourt

I believe that the above-mentioned arguments strongly support my position,
which I share with Steiker. However, there are a few possible responses from the “‘pro-
status quo” side. Defenders of the Supreme Court’s approach may argue that all
regulation is imperfect yet necessary. After all, courts must decide cases one way or
another—ignoring an issue at a higher appellate level (by denying cert) simply shifts the
burden of regulation to lower courts or other branches of the government. But I believe
that a critical theorist or any other critic of the established legal approach would respond
in two ways. First, with certain issues—such as the death penalty—there is a
straightforward solution that circumvents the need for the hazy line-drawing that Steiker
et.al criticize: abolition. This approach, advocated by Brennan and eventually
Blackmun in death penalty cases, would be easy to implement, cheaper than the status
quo (to Becker’s approval), and far more honest than muddling through regulatory
schemes. Second, even with issues that have no such “easy solution,” it may still be
useful for courts and especially scholars to speak in honest, straightforward terms rather
than cloaking their value-laden decisions in the sacerdotal language of the law.

As a final (perhaps last-ditch) argument, a defender of the death penalty approach
would also say that the critiques apply to all criminal law rather than just the death
penalty. While there is some truth to this contention (e.g. Kelman’s critiques are hardly
limited to the death penalty), it still seems that we should differentiate between the
ultimate penalty, which is unnecessary (see most of the developed world) and prohibits
any future reversal, and other forms of criminal sanction that are regretfully a necessary

evil.

In conclusion, I embrace the Steiker critique of the death penalty. In purely
practical terms, it seems perverse that Georgia’s per capita sentencing rate for capital
punishment is actually higher “post-reform,” and this is only one example. Ona
theoretical level, legitimation of a flawed institution through dubious attempts at
regulation is probably worse than no regulation at all (per Scalia’s preference). However,
I conclude that the best solution is abolition. Like Justice Blackmun in his Callins v.
Collins dissent, I believe that the Supreme Court has failed to devise proper rules, and so

it should “no logner tinker with the machinery of death.”

Braman Q. 3.

The absence of a force requirement is troubling—presumably the “without
consent” aspects of the second-degree provision would encompass any situation that
involved force or threat of force but no injury. However, it seems problematic to lump all
degrees of force that do not involve injury into one category. For example, in Sherry, the
courts considered the force requirement as a part of their analysis. The victim was not
injured, however, and so the outcome would inevitably be second-degree rape. As
another example, the Rusk case would have been very straightforward—the intermediate
court held that there was not a sufficient force standard (although they were reversed by
the Supreme Court), but this proposal seems to focus exclusively on consent, which may
have influenced the outcome of the Rusk case.

Perhaps the simplistic approach to the force requirement is desirable—after all, an
individual applying force will not “get off’ as a result of the new law considering that he
clearly acted without the victim’s free consent. Furthermore, the new approach may be
seen to (desirably) eliminate debatably archaic standards such as the basic force
requirement that courts apply (see Rusk intermediate appellate court). But is this really
true? Despite the absence of an explicit force requirement in the text of the statute, courts
may still interpret the “consent” provision as requiring some sort of showing of force, at
least as an evidentiary standard. Therefore, the usefulness of simplification is
questionable—it simply places more power in the hands of the courts. Reformers who
wish to eliminate archaic requirements, therefore, should not be too excited by the
proposal unless they have confidence in the reformist nature of the judiciary.

Furthermore, the express condemnation and just desert theories of punishment seem to


Exam #2 Winter 2010 Page 13 of 20
Criminal Law: Braman and Harcourt

suggest that there should be some distinction between cases where no force is applied
(perhaps the controversial “no means no” acquaintance rape cases) and stranger rape
cases where the rapist threatens deadly force or even kidnaps the victim. This wouldn’t
necessarily require inserting “force” as a requirement for second-degree and eliminating
the simple “no-consent” crime. However, it would seem to justify adding an additional
degree of punishment or in some other way incorporating force, kidnapping, etc. Such an
outcome would be useful for the sake of jury verdicts—jurors, judges, and prosecutors, as
we know from class and especially the Kahan and Braman/Kahan studies tend to bring
their own worldviews, and the absence of differentiation that fits with social values may
result in a situation where prosecutors simply do not prosecute some cases, or some cases
result in acquittals, for reasons that we would not prefer.

The absence of a mens rea requirement is also somewhat troublesome. The plain
text suggests that strict liability would apply—“without her consent” is not qualified by
any terms such as “with the actor’s knowledge.” Some jurisdictions, e.g. Wisconsin and
New Jersey, seem to have imposed strict liability, at least after there is any indication of
dissent on the victim’s part (although, as we know from the discussion of
prosecutor/judge/juror biases, there is always “wiggle-room” in practice). The model
penal code provides for a reckless mens rea; under such an interpretation of the new
statute, many cases would come out differently, with acquittals, especially those that
involve statutory rape (e.g. Prince, Jadowski), but perhaps also those that seem to involve
a negligence standard (e.g. Fischer, although it is difficult to tell the difference here
between negligence and recklessness). Most likely, the courts will interpret a negligence

standard notwithstanding the text, which seems to be the approach for most jurisdictions.


Exam #2 Winter 2010 Page 14 of 20
Criminal Law: Braman and Harcourt

The pros and cons of this statute as it relates to mens rea, therefore, almost
entirely reflects one’s level of confidence in the judicially-imposed outcome of any
disputes. It may be seen as problematic for a statute to leave so much discretion in the
hands of courts, and there is also a problem of notification—how would an individual
know what standard to expect before there is a body of case law? This may encourage
the courts to be generous with defendants (per lenity), which may simply prompt more
legislative action. Altogether, the lack of a mens rea provision will probably simply end
up costing the legislature more time. However, the absence of mens rea requirement is
not necessarily a tremendous problem from a reformist perspective. Consider, for
example, that New Jersey moved toward a strict liability standard largely through judicial
action rather than statute (as seen in Wisconsin).

Aside from the lack of mention of force and mens rea, there are certain
improvements sound in this rape law vis-a-vis other approaches. For example, I believe
that the distinction between spousal relationships and other relationships, which is
reflected in many jurisdictions (including the MPC, or at least the version that we
studied), is obsolete and should be eliminated, as this new code does. But such
improvements do not seem to make up for the law’s inherent vagueness. In conclusion,
Senator, your support for or opposition to this proposal should largely depend on your
confidence in the law-making ability of the courts. The legislature cannot simply leave
out essential elements such as mens rea and expect them to remain “absent” from the
law—judges (and to some degree prosecutors and juries) will fill in the gaps through both

formal and informal mechanisms. Bear in mind, of course, that any regardless of the


Exam #2 Winter 2010 Page 15 of 20
Criminal Law: Braman and Harcourt

statute, social norms and worldviews are probably the most important factors in the realm

of rape law (see Kahan).

Braman Q. 4.

I will analyze the two low-level individuals together, considering that their
defenses will be similar. I will start by analyzing only Hraman, and then assume that the
same applies to Barcourt, with the exception of a few differences that will be noted.
Hraman Prosecution:

Hraman Defense: The CIA officer would cite the defense of “ignorance or mistake as to
a matter of law” seen in MPC 2.04. He could claim that he acted in reliance on “an
official interpretation” of an officer “charged by law with responsibility for the
interpretation . . . of the law defining the offense,” in this case, Addington. The absence
of the memo in this case would not be problematic if Addington is seen as a relevant
authority. He might also cite MPC 2.10, which uses blunt terms to provide an affirmative
defense for military personnel acting under orders from “his superior in the armed.
services” provided that he doesn’t know the order is unlawful. Although the interrogators
in question were CIA agents rather than uniformed military personnel, a CIA interrogator
participating in the “war on terror” may forcefully claim that the provision applies.

These two MPC provisions provide defense for Hraman even without the statute, but the
statute makes his case stronger (especially considering that the MPC provisions may not
apply to the relevant federal law). He would argue that he clearly qualifies for the
protection in the statute: he is an “agent” of the United States government who
performed practices against individuals deemed as terrorists, and the actions would not be
understood as unlawful by a person “of ordinary sense.” Considering that there is no
overwhelming consensus of public opinion that waterboarding is obviously torture (he

may want to cite statistics), he would seem to fall under this provision. Furthermore, he


Exam #2 Winter 2010 Page 17 of 20
Criminal Law: Braman and Harcourt

may claim to have relied on counsel (in the form of the memo), although he wouldn’t
place too much emphasis on this argument because it doesn’t apply to the first instance of
waterboarding.

Hraman Prosecution: The prosecution would have a difficult time overcoming Hraman’s
defenses. At least they could take comfort in the fact that this issue does not involve
collateral law. They could probably defeat his “military orders” defense by showing that
he is not a military officer, but that was only his weakest defense. They might also try to
defeat his “reliance” argument by charging that the Vice President’s Chief of Staff is not
a public officer under the definition of the MPC. While they might be technically correct
on this point (neither the Vice President nor his Chief of Staff occupy a position on the
formal chain of command for the CIA), a sympathetic jury may very well believe that
such a powerful individual (we all know about Cheney’s effective power and that of the
people around him) should count as a “public officer” for the purposes of the law.
Finally, the prosecution could only defeat his claim under the statute by showing that a
reasonable person would know that the action was illegal. Unless they can demonstrate a
general public consensus on the illegality of waterboarding (which seems unlikely
considering that other people in the department are working on this very issue, indicating
that there is at least some controversy), the prosecution will not overcome the statutory
defense.

Barcourt Defense and Prosecution: Barcourt will almost certainly try to claim the same
defenses as Hrmanan. His position as a civilian contractor may make his position more
difficult, however. He would have to establish as much as possible an interpretation of

his role as “official.” The prosecution, in contrast, would try to make him seem like a


Exam #2 Winter 2010 Page 18 of 20
Criminal Law: Braman and Harcourt

contractor falling outside the scope of “United States employee.” Barcourt would almost
certainly lose the military order argument because his position was even further removed
from a military-like structure than Hraman’s. However, could add Hraman to his list of
officials for the purposes of “reliance” under the MPC. A jury would likely be
sympathetic to this claam—wouldn’t one expect a civilian contractor to differ to the
superior knowledge of government insiders? Finally, Barcourt’s defense under the
statute would be a toss-up. The statute protects officers, employees, members of the
Armed Forces, and other agents. The outcome on this defense would hinge on whether
or not Barcourt qualifies as an employee (which may dip over into Contracts or Tort
liability law, e.g. the difference between a contractor and an employee, which falls
beyond the scope of this class). I believe that most likely the jury and/or court will
sympathize with Barcourt’s position and allow him the statutory defense.
Policy: Although Hraman and Barcourt seem to have fairly strong legal defenses, one
could make a policy argument that even an unsuccessful prosecution of them would have
a “chilling effect” on the intelligence community. Agents would no longer trust their
superiors, which might cause serious problems for national security. On the other hand,
one could argue from a policy perspective that a prosecution would send a signal to the
world that the United States rejects torture and accepts no excuses. Finally, it would
express social express condemnation of torture, which could be a good thing (even if
failing on the fairness just desert account for the individual agents in this instance).

Next I will examine Cheney and Addington as accomplices and co-conspirators.

Because their roles are very similar, I will examine them together.


Exam #2 Winter 2010 Page 19 of 20
Criminal Law: Braman and Harcourt

Defense: The two high-ranking officials may first attempt to claim “reliance” on legal
counsel. It seems silly that they could negligently (or I would say recklessly) obtain
questionable legal counsel and then use it to claim a mistake of law. However, they
would still probably attempt the argument. They might also try to defeat accomplice
claims by arguing that they lacked the requisite mens rea. They did not necessarily
intend to have any particular technique applied—they simply sought legal counsel and
then passed that advice along to the agents on the ground. On the conspiracy charge,
Cheney and Addington would simply contend that there was no agreement to commit a
crime. Perhaps they could present their exchange of words as a simple attempt to get a
legal memo, which in turn caused the agents to commit the crime—but Cheney and
Addington were focused only on the advice, and there can be no crime in seeking an
opinion.

Prosecution of Cheney and Addington: The prosecution would respond to the mistake of
law based on counsel argument by demonstrating that reliance on counsel must be in
good faith (see Long v. State). The prosecution would proceed to charge Cheney and
Addington with accomplice liability. They lack the defenses cited by the agents on the
ground, and they clearly “solicited” those agents to act with some degree of purpose or at
least knowledge that waterboarding (which we assume is torture) would result. Any
claims of negligence or recklessness would only apply to mistake of law—clearly Cheney
and Addington had a sufficient mens rea for liability in performing the waterboarding
itself. Even if this is not seen to be the case, however, the prosecution may still fall back
on some courts’ rather broad interpretation of accomplice liability: see Luparello

(Harcourt reading—accomplice liability does not require that all defendants exhibited the


Exam #2 Winter 2010 Page 20 of 20
Criminal Law: Braman and Harcourt

same mens rea.) Finally, the prosecution will make a strong case for conspiracy. The
MPC’s conspiracy requirements state that a conspirator must “agrees with such other
person or persons that they or one or more of them will engage in conduct that constitutes
such crime.” It focuses on conspiracy to commit the conduct, and so it does not seem to
allow a mistake of law defense. In response to Cheney and Addington’s claim that they
were simply seeking an opinion, not the underlying act, the prosecution would probably
respond that there is a clear link between obtaining the opinion and the act itself—
furthermore, Addington clearly made the instructions to the defendant junior agents.
Policy Considerations: Despite the prosecution’s likely strong case against Cheney and
Addington, prosecution of former high-rakning officials, especially the former VP, would
be extremely unlikely for political reasons. Defenders of Cheney would charge a “witch-
hunt” by the Obama administration, and Republicans would tend to be furious. For these

reasons alone, Obama and Holder would probably not press ahead with prosecutions.
