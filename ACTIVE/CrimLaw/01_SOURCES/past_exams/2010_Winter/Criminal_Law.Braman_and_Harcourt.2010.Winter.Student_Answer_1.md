Harcourt Question 1
Conspiracy

The MPC defines conspiracy as agreeing with others they or one or more of them will
engage in conduct that constitutes such crime or an attempt or solicitation to commit such crime
or of an attempt or solicitation to commit such crime.

Smith’s first defense was that he does not meet this definition because he never agreed to
commit any crime. The witness tampering statute that he supposedly conspired to violate
requires the use of physical force or threat thereof. Smith would argue that his agreement with
Montgomery should not be perceived as intent to kill or harm. The MPC requires more specific
intent and rejects the common law doctrine of natural and probably consequences, meaning that
the natural consequences of his agreement with Montgomery which ended in his fight with
Jackson is immaterial to the conspiracy charge. The MPC rejects the Pinkerton doctrine, and
Smith cannot be liable for the conduct of Montgomery simply because he conspired with him to
commit an offense. The MPC requires more specific intent.

Smith might also argue that he did not have an overt act, and that the agreement to talk to
Jackson was not sufficient to constitute such an act. In order for this defense to be valid he would
have to argue that Montgomery only threatened physical force, that he did not attempt to kill
Montgomery, that Montgomery acted in self-defense when he subjectively thought Jackson was
pulling a weapon (the shiny thing) and he was in immediate danger of death or serious bodily
harm.

The Prosecution would respond first that the authorization of force (required by the

tampering statute) was implicit in the agreement because Smith understood the incident about the


Student 1 Winter 2010 Crriminal Law Exam, Professors Braman & Harcourt, March 2010
page 2 of 16

world-series to mean that Montgomery and Jackson had an acrimonious relationship, and by get
him to keep quiet, Montgomery meant to threaten him with violence.

On the defense regarding the overt act, the Prosecution can easily defeat this because the
MPC does not require an overt act for felonies, and witness tampering, under the statute is a
felony when the actor attempts homicide. The prosecution will argue that Montgomery attempted
homicide rather than acted self-defense because he occasioned the situation leading to the fight
and is therefore barred from the offense.

The prosecution has the better argument. The fact finder will probably find that the
agreement between Montgomery and Smith, if carried out, would result in witness tampering
meeting its requirement of force because they are more likely to believe the prosecution’s
narrative that the agreement, while vague, implicitly involved the requisite bodily harm or threat
of bodily harm in the statute, and that Montgomery attempted homicide because hitting someone
with a broken pipe in the head would probably result in their death or serious enough bodily
harm. Under the MPC, homicide includes manslaughter, so Montgomery’s provocation does not
negate the homicide bump-up to felony status in the witness tampering statute.

Attempted tampering

First Smith will argue that he cannot be charged with two inchoate crimes under the
Verive rule, and that conspiracy is an inchoate crime.

Second he will argue that he did not have the appropriate mens rea, that he did not
believe he did not actually engage in the conduct himself, and that conduct is necessary to be
convicted of attempt.

The prosecution will probably respond the first defense by choosing whatever charge is

stronger.


Student 1 Winter 2010 Crriminal Law Exam, Professors Braman & Harcourt, March 2010
page 3 of 16

The prosecution will respond to the second defense by pointing out that under MPC
5.0 1aii, all that is required is that witness tampering is a result crime (the result being the witness
is reluctant to testify) and he engaged in conduct with the purpose of causing that result.

Here Smith has the better argument. Witness tampering under the statute is not a result
crime because it is not required that the witness actually be reluctant to testify, but criminalized
the conduct where the purpose is to accomplish that end.

Tampering

Smith will argue he cannot be charge with tampering because he did not kill or attempt to
kill or use physical force, etc, and that an act is required for tampering (as it is required for all
crimes). The statute requires he acted willfully or knowingly. Smith will argue he did not act at
all.

The prosecution will respond that his use of Montgomery to accomplish these ends is the
same thing as acting.

Smith has the better argument here. If the P wants to charge him with tampering, they
should doing it using accomplice liability or attempt, which carries the same punishment and is
easier to prove with regard to Smith.

Solicitation
Attempted manslaughter (accomplice liability)

Smith will argue that the model penal code requires specific intent to commit

manslaughter and he did not cause (2.06) Montgomery to engage in such conduct, and that the

fight between Jackson and Montgomery was too far removed from him and his intent.


Student 1 Winter 2010 Crriminal Law Exam, Professors Braman & Harcourt, March 2010
page 4 of 16

The prosecution will argue that manslaugher is a result crime, subjecting it to 2.06(4)
negligent or reckless accomplice liability and that the conversation between Smith and
Montgomery was reckless conduct (implicit threat of violence) that cause the result.

Here the P has the better argument. Assuming the fact finder can draw the inference that
the conversation was reckless in that it encouraged violence and av iolation of the statute and that
the result was that Montgomery attempted to kill Jackson by hitting him over the head with a

pipe, they can easily find that Smith’s conduct caused that result.

Harcourt Question 2
Posner

Richard Posner would probably be the most critical of the Steiker thesis. He would
probably agree with the criticism posed by David McCord, which provides a different behavioral
analysis more similar to Posner’s conception of the human being as a rational actor.

The Steiker’s thesis is predicated on the idea that the population as a whole is somewhat
Stanley Milgram-esque — meaning they are capable of being unreasonably and grotesquely
cruel to their fellow human beings on the basis of a behavioral response to authority that is
particularly immutable. This has an inherent tension with the Posner embrace of “homo-
economicus.” Implicit in his writing on criminal law and in his response to the Jolls, et al
“Behavioral” critique, Posner’s analysis assumes that if a person does something, then it is
rational, not the other way around. Therefore his objections would probably be two-fold: first
that there is error in imputing an attitude to a population, rather than focusing on the individual
(methodology), and second he would dispute the accuracy of their findings through cost-benefit
analysis.

On the first point, Posner would be concerned with an aggregate analysis of behavior. He
would point out that juries, not opinion polls sentence in capital cases, and that such individuals
are rational and have an incentive to understand the consequences of their actions in that jurors
are held particularly morally responsible for the verdicts they render in a way the general
population is not. See the juries in OJ Simpson and the jurors who acquitted the LAPD officers
in Rodney King.

On the second point, Posner would probably compare the post-Furman era with the pre-

Furman era, skeptical that jurisprudence has not made much progress. Posner believes, as was


Student 1 Winter 2010 Crriminal Law Exam, Professors Braman & Harcourt, March 2010
page 6 of 16

cited in the casebook, that the death penalty is necessary, particularly for the “worst” offenders
and that if we are to maximize social welfare the best means is to optimize the tradeoff of error
and discriminatory application of the death penalty to its social benefits, namely incapacitation
and perhaps deterrence (or marginal deterrence). The restricted use of the death penalty to the
most heinous of offenders is consistent with a theory of marginal deterrence in that while the
death penalty might not deter generally, it might be successful in creating an incentive for
criminals to substitute lesser crimes, which, overall, is welfare enhancing. (Otherwise you might
as well go all-out if you’re going to get the chair anyway.). Overall he would contend that the
status-quo is preferable to the pre-Furman era, passing the threshold of a positive cost-benefit
analysis. He could look to how the raised stakes of the continuation and strict judicial scrutiny
contributed to the creation of innocence projects, a stream of jurisprudence that is increasingly
careful (e.g. categorical unavailability of the death penalty for juveniles and the mentally
retarded), state abolition (e.g. New Mexico), and moratoria (e.g. Illinois).

McCord’s analysis is consistent with this theory. He contends that post-Furman
jurisprudence has been success in mitigating what the Court sees as capital punishment’s primary
vice, overinclusion. He further contends that the collection of malefactors on death row has
become “worse.”

Kelman

I think Kelman would be particularly receptive to the legitimation theory conception of
the instutional criminal justice system. He argues fact is filtered through perception first, and
then applied in a way that feigns a legitimate, fair outcome. He might argue that the Steikers
have a satisfactory narrative that strips the issue of intellectual acrobatics. Perhaps simply put, if

people knew what they were doing when they sentenced someone to death (or embraced capital


Student 1 Winter 2010 Crriminal Law Exam, Professors Braman & Harcourt, March 2010
page 7 of 16

punishment at the polls), they simply would not do it. The Court in this instance provides the
intellectual acrobatics. He would argue, like both Blackmun (or was it Stevens — drawing a
blank) and Scalia that death penalty jurisprudence is incoherent; that guided discretion does not
mean anything.

He might also look to support from the Baldus study to merge his theory with the
Steikers’. Here we have painstakingly researched facts, accepted by the Court, that
comprehensively prove the criminal justice system applies the death penalty in a way that is
undeniably racially discriminatory. Despite having acknowledged this as being a reality, the
Court, through formalistic, legalistic jurisprudence continues to require intent to discriminate.
Kelman would probably argue that this is indicative of precisely what he contends: that the Court
hides behind complexity in order to frame the question of discrimination in a way that leads to
the outcomes he wants.

Braman

I think Braman would be both sympathetic and skeptical of the Steiker thesis. Social-
cognition theory posits that people either accept or reject fact based upon group commitments,
making him more amenable to the Milgram conception of the population because one could tell a
narrative that status competition among “decent law-abiding citizens” have a cognitive incentive
to enhance their own status by otherwising those deviants who would e eligible for the death
penalty. In order to maintain that conception, and remain capable of maintaining moral
culpability, they would have to look to and accept evidence that the application of the death
penalty was fair. The guided-discretion era does indeed provide the perhaps dubious impression
that the safe-guards of the appeals process and “guided discretion” indeed render this outcome.

Capital punishment is ripe with opportunities for cognitive dissonance, and I believe Braman


Student 1 Winter 2010 Crriminal Law Exam, Professors Braman & Harcourt, March 2010
page 8 of 16

could point out how world-view shapes the way people perceive the process of the capital
punishment and its outcomes. Overall, I think he would be receptive to the Steiker
hypothesis/narrative.

I think Braman’s skepticism (if he has any) would come from his background as an
empiricist. The Steiker thesis is theoretical, and they explicitly do not provide any empirical
analysis to back their attitudinal analysis. Braman would probably be more comfortable if the
Steikers had a formal model and a regression or two.

Braman consistently contends that as a matter of principle, people are neither stupid nor
evil in forming their beliefs, and it is not conducive to good norm-formation to impute bad faith
on the other side. Braman might approach the question more carefully and with more deference
to popular conceptions of the death penalty than the Steikers. Assuming that Braman is an

re 6,

abolitionist (something I don’t know), he might be more receptive to Kahan’s “sticky norms”
approach and would maybe suggest that an academic imposition of what the proper
conceptualization of the death penalty is might be counter-productive. He would likely want to
foster more dialogue and compromise between in the sides in order to hopefully move toward a
more acceptable and moral norm. In a way, the Court’s post-Furman jurisprudence allows for
nudges a la categorical abolition for juveniles and the mentally ill under the 8" amendment and a
compromise between advocates and abolitionists. Regardless, Braman would still probably

accept the central tenant of legitimation theory notwithstanding these normative concers and

empirical skepticism.

Braman Question |
Can rape law be so simple?

Rape law can be this simple. This statute is substantially similar to the statute adopted in
Wisconsin. Because it is not riddled with exceptions (e.g. marriage, restriction to vaginal
intercourse), we can apply the same law to the same types of offense, and it will be predictable to
potential defendants they will be liable if they have sex with someone with out their consent
regardless of the circumstances or loopholes. The seemingly more complex laws are the ones
that prove to be more problematic at providing notice or uniformity/equal application. The
danger on the other side is overinclusion. The broader language of this statute expands liability
by not requiring force or injury or a duty to resist. This will mean more defendants, many of

whom will not have committed the same crimes often charged in the same cateogory.

Should there be a force requirement?

The modern movement is away from a focus on the conduct/aggression of the male and
toward the sexual autonomy of the victim. In few other crimes would the victim have some sort
of duty to mitigate, to stop his or her assailant or to endure violence before the law provides a
remedy. Tying force to consent obfuscates the actual violation, and rape victims may not want to
distinguish between the two or be obligated to risk more injury by provided resistance or forcing
their assailant to force them before the law calls this violation rape. This statute does recognize
that injury and the use of force are more heinous than rape without those elements while still
maintaining other degrees to encompass non-consensual sex without violence as rape, which

sends a powerful social message that the behavior is intolerable.

What about mistakes of fact?

Justice Brown in Lefkowitz observes that after a woman says no, any further action is
unwarranted and the actor proceeds at his peril. I think the central insight here is to take the onus
off of the woman to demonstrate non-consent and simply shift it to the actor to affirmatively
obtain consent.

This question is more complicated because the facts do not state what jurisdiction this is,
and some places the “no means yes” norm is still very strong. If women, as a matter of custom,
provide token resistance, it would be impossible for a potential rapist to be able to discern the
actual factual circumstances and whether she actually consented.

The above argument is not particularly convincing because this is an element of burden
shifting moreso than mistake. The cost of making assurances or desisting in sexual intercourse at
any sign of resistance is nill compared to the horror of rape. The public policy concern of chilling
sexual intercourse in this situation does not outweigh the risk of rape and a violation of sexual
autonomy that is risked if the law continues to embrace the “no means yes” norm.

If the fear is that shame will lead more victims to falsely and in retrospect claim non-
consent notwithstanding force, I think this issue is better resolved by the jury to determine what
happened rather than to be barred entirely by law. It is not the case that a victim would always or
even often be successful at raising false claims. In fact, the horror of rape makes very few
women want to relieve the ordeal on the witness stand, and women with reputational concerns
are the most at danger of such opportunistic behavior, where a jury trial about the details would

hopefully deter meritless claims.

What cases would come out differently?


Student 1 Winter 2010 Crriminal Law Exam, Professors Braman & Harcourt, March 2010
page 11 of 16

The major cases that would come out differently were the cases we read about
acquaintance rape. Under the new statute, the victim in Berkowitz would not have to demonstrate
force in order to maintain the charge against Berkowitz. Fischer was similar in this respect.

While the Morgan defendants were convicted on a hightened standard of an honest and

reasonable belief, their case would have turned out the same way under a strict liability standard.

What would be the pros and cons of this law?

The pros of the law would be the policy move away from male aggression, sexism in the
statutes, the requirement of vaginal intercourse, the marriage exception, and the statute would
bring the focus of rape law to the violation of sexual autonomy rather than the force exerted by
the male. It would no longer obligate a woman to risk injury by resisting, and it would shift the
burden where it is approrpriately placed — on the assailant.

The cons are two fold. This law is challenged by overinclusion and sticky norm. In terms
of overinclusion, it would appear that any two people who have sex while intoxicated could not
be capable of consent. I think this is unreasonable and the threshold for incompetence should be
appropriately set beyond mere intoxication. In fact, I think a lot percentage of the population
would be criminalized if they could not consent to have sex while intoxicated. Also what if both
persons are intoxicated and neither was capable of consent? What if both were intoxicated but
one actor forced himself on a victim? Could he have not consented to the sex he forced by reason
of incompetence? Who raped whom? More definition is needed as to what constitutes consent
which goes undefined in the statute, yet is central to the determination of whether a crime

occurred.


Student 1 Winter 2010 Crriminal Law Exam, Professors Braman & Harcourt, March 2010
page 12 of 16

The second problem is one that of sticky norms. The “no means yes” and the honorable
women put up a fight norms are deeply entrenched and juries may filter the facts to conform with
these norms not withstanding the law. If juries are given the opportunity to do this, it will take
the credibility and legitimacy out of the law if it is not enforced as written and it could be
counterproductive to its own goals. The passage suggests (but doesn’t actually say in any detail)
that the new law is a great departure from existing law, perhaps making it particularly susceptible
to the sticky norms problem and a more iterative approach might be more conducive to a strict

liability regime in the long run.

Braman Question 2
Hraman

First it does not necessarily matter that Hraman relied on the memo in the second
instance and Addington’s assurances in the first. There is no “magic” memo provision in the
statute. The question of relying on “counsel” is not entirely dispositive in either case.

Instead the most relevant issue is whether Hraman met the standard of a person of
ordinary sense and understanding who would have known the practices to be unlawful.

In analyzing this, the statute provides some guidance, namely that reliance on the
authority of counsel would be an important factor among others. First, the president’s designees
had determined that the suspects Hraman waterboarded indeed posed a serious/continuing threat
to the United States as evidenced by their assertion that an attack on US soil was imminent.
(Presumably Addington is indeed a designee of POTUS.) If not it is possible to infer that the
relevant designess was Cheney, notwithstanding the fact that he did not give the instruction as
this is not required by the statute, just that the determination of the requisite danger has been
determined by POTUS or his designee.

It can be reasonably argued that Hraman, in good faith, relied on the advice of counsel.
This is clear on its face when he relied on the Yoo memo, but perhaps only implicit in relying on
Addington’s assurances. It is unclear if Addington would meet the defintion of counsel under the
statute? Is counsel required to be a lawyer? Is Addington a lawyer? Is counsel supposed to be
giving dispassionate legal advice?

It is likely that a determination of what constitutes counsel may not be necessary as

reliance on counsel’s advice is not dispositive, suggesting the reliance on authority which a


Student 1 Winter 2010 Crriminal Law Exam, Professors Braman & Harcourt, March 2010
page 14 of 16

reasonable person would view as counsel may be sufficient to meet the threshold of being a
factor.

Hraman might have a prima facie problem in being a reasonable person. It is not clear
that a reasonable person would believe torture to be lawful. However if we presume Cheney,
Addington, and perhaps a large number of Americans are reasonable people. Hraman probably
meets this standard and is heavily aided by the advice of counsel provision (though not
conclusive).

Barcourt

It is hard to determine how the law should be applied to Barcourt. He faces many of the
same issues at Hraman, but the most relevant issue is perhaps whether the statute applies to him
as a civilian. Two things work in Barcourt’s favor. First he claims to be under the direction of the
White House, which would probably make him an agent of the United States which would be
sufficient to be covered by the statute.

He might also be distinguished from Hraman in that it is not as clear he relied necessarily
on the advice provided by Addington and Yoo (but perhaps inferable). He states that he was
shown the OLC memo, but the facts are silent on whether he relied upon it or whether he
believed it to be accurate, only that it was shown to him. However, it is neither necessary nor
necessarily indemnifying if he had relied on counsel if he meets the standard of a reasonable,

ordinary person who believed waterboarding to be lawful.

Cheney
Cheney may face the most credible threat of criminal liability. Despite being an agent of

the US, he will probably not meet the reasonable/ordinary person standard if he wants the


Student 1 Winter 2010 Crriminal Law Exam, Professors Braman & Harcourt, March 2010
page 15 of 16

defense under the statute. He specifically directed that a memo be provided that state the law was
what he said it was. Presumably this would demonstrate that he might have known the practice to
be unlawful.

Cheney might be able to raise a necessity defense. While political necessity defense are
often ineffective, this was not your garden-variety IRS paint/abortion clinic protest. Cheney
seems to honestly (if not reasonably, but honest is the standard in the MPC for this defense)
believed that harm to innocent persons was imminent and greater than the harm of torture
(Choice of Evils is the MPC necessity defense which uses this calculus). Moreover, because
Cheney wanted a legal memo on stating such torture was legal, this might actually demonstrate
an honest belief the legislature did not mean to include waterboarding as unlawful torture
meeting all the requirement of the LofE defense.

Unlike Addington, however, it will be harder to convict him under an expanded liability
theory like conspiracy or complicity because he farther removed from the chain of events leading
to the torture. However, he would seemingly be legally accountable for agents acting under him
as per the MPC for complicity. This might indeed constitute solicitation, and since torture is a

felony, we do not need to inquire about the overt act requirement

Addington

Addington has a better shot than Cheney of using the statute as a defense because he
honestly believed torture to be constitutionally legal as can be inferred from the transcript of his
conversation with Cheney. He would be subject to the same analysis about ordinary or

reasonable sensibility about the lawfulness of torture, but he would not have the benefit of


Student 1 Winter 2010 Crriminal Law Exam, Professors Braman & Harcourt, March 2010
page 16 of 16

having relied on counsel unless Cheney is counsel and he relied on Cheney, neither of which
seems plausible in the facts.

He might also be able to raise necessity similar to Cheney’s. If Hraman or Barcourt
indeed violated the law, under the same analsysis he could be said to have aided and abetted or
conspiring has he had agreed to authorize the torture with Cheney and induced an innocent (if
either Hraman and Barcourt are innocents) to commit a crime. Hraman and Barcourt do not need
to be convicted necessarily for this outcome to happen.

the best policy arguments here are either to grant indemnity to government officials os as
not to chill them from trying to protect the countery from terrorism or alternatively to hold them
strictly accountable to provide a strong incentive for government officials to act humanely and to

follow the law and not substitute their own judgment. I think the latter is stronger.
