The strongest point of this statute is the elimination of the force requirement. Sexual
intercourse is criminalized if it is without the consent of the victim. The force requirement is
problematic for a number of reasons. First, it seems to accommodate the no means yes norm in
acquaintance rape scenarios, such as in Berkowitz. In Berkowitz, the victim said no repeatedly,
but did not physically resist. The defendant locked the door to the room from the inside, but not
in a way that prevented the victim from leaving. The court interpreted this as the absence of
force, and did not convict for rape despite the victim’s explicit denial of consent (though the
court did affirm a conviction for indecent assault). A force requirement would change the
outcome of this case by insuring that an expression of non-consent was sufficient to criminalize
unwanted sexual intercourse. There are a number of reasons that a rape victim might not resist
despite the absence of force, not the least of which is that victims who resist are more likely to be
injured. Therefore, a simple “no” should be sufficient. Though community norms may be to the
contrary in some cases, the court in Lefkowitz was right to say that after “no” a man proceeds at
his own peril, because even if he suspects because of community norms that the victim meant

yes, he can’t be sure, and should be held legally responsible in the event that he is incorrect.

The purpose of the force requirement is two-fold, but both purposes are archaic, and thus
a goal of rape reform should be to eliminate the requirement. As suggested in Rusk, one of the
purposes of requiring force is as evidence of non-consent. Of course, force can still provide
evidence of non-consent under the proposed statute, but it is no longer necessary to prove non-
consent. The reasons force was traditionally required as evidence of non-consent is the
longstanding bias that victims of rape are more likely to lie about consent than other types of

victims (MTS). One of the purposes of rape reform is to normalize rape law and make it more


Exam #3 W’10 Criminal Law/Braman and Harcourt (3/10/2010) Page 2 of 20

consistent with other laws, including by eliminating this ungrounded assumption. Therefore, the
force requirement is not necessary as a form of evidence, and the court should be able to rely on
the victim’s assertion of “no.” Though, under traditional rape statutes, the court can mitigate the
evidentiary harm of the force requirement by allowing an exception when the victim fails to
resist due to reasonable fear (see Rusk), this has two problems. First, the court in Rusk fails to
decide on whether a similar exception should be made when the victim fails to resist due to
unreasonable fear. There may be cases where the victim expresses her non-consent orally but for
whatever reason fears that she will be harmed if she resists. If the court finds her fear to be
unreasonable under the circumstances, it effectively grants license to the offender to proceed
despite the victim’s assertions of non-consent. Thus, though Rusk would come out the same way
under the proposed statute, scenarios where the court finds that the victim failed to resist due to
unreasonable fear may come out with more appropriate results. Second, assessing the
reasonableness of the victim’s fear amount to putting the victim on trial, which has chilling effect
on the willingness of the victim to bring forth claims, and has the expressive effect of casting
blame and suspicion on the victim. Of course, replacing consent with force takes the victim off
the stand by placing the emphasis of the acts of the offender rather than the acts of the victim, but
it does so at the expense of sanctioning a great deal of non-consensual sexual contact. Under the
proposed statute, the court can inquire about consent, but can still avoid placing the victim on

trial by limiting admissible evidence about the victim’s character through rape shield laws.

The second purpose of the force requirement is that reflects the archaic notion that force
or violence is what makes rape a particularly heinous crime. In contrast, rape reformed like
Estrich emphasize that rape is also a crime against the personal integrity of the victim. Rape

denies the autonomy of the victim to choose what sexual contact to engage in. By eliminating


Exam #3 W’10 Criminal Law/Braman and Harcourt (3/10/2010) Page 3 of 20

the force requirement, the proposed statute expresses the progressive view that rape is not only a
crime of violence, but an offense against the personal integrity of the victim. Nonetheless, by
using a grade approach like the WI statute to distinguish rape accompanied by physical injury
from other forms of rape, the court acknowledges that violence can contribute to the harm done
by rape, even if it is not the only source of harm. In addition, this has the effect of creating
effective marginal deterrence — if the penalty for rape accompanied by physical injury were the
same as that for rape without such injury, an offender who purposely rapes his victim, especially

in a stranger rape scenario, would have no incentive to avoid causing injury.

One potentially problematic area of the statute is that it is silent on the mens rea
requirement. It is unclear whether mistake of fact about the victim’s consent is a defense, as it
traditionally is. In American jurisdictions, the mens rea of rape typically involves a choice
between negligence and strict liability. Negligence, the traditional standard, allows a defense for
honest and reasonable mistake of fact about the victim’s consent. Strict liability, as proposed by
reformers and adopted in Simock and Lefkowitz, allows no such defense. The purpose of the
negligence standard again is to accommodate the no means yes norm. If community norms are
such that victims who mean yes often feel obliged to feign non-consent to protect their image as
sexually pure, a strict liability standard risks chilling some desired sexual behavior or punishing
offenders who really believed that their victims meant to consent. However, the alternative,
negligence, risks effectively condoning some non-consensual sexual contact, which is ultimately
a greater risk since at least under a strict liability standard, potential offenders can avoid liability
by not proceeding after no. Again, as stated in Lefkowitz, under a strict liability standard, after
“no,” a potential offender proceeds at his own risk. Moreover, as MacKinnon and Estrich note,

any assessment of “reasonableness” for a negligence standard must be made from a particular


Exam #3 W’10 Criminal Law/Braman and Harcourt (3/10/2010) Page 4 of 20

perspective. What seems reasonable to men, for example, might be unreasonable to women, and
certainly will seem unreasonable to at least a small class of potential victims. By allowing juries
to evaluate the “reasonableness” of sexual behavior from their own perspective, they risk

undermining the ability of women to deny consent verbally.

If the silence of the statute on mens reas is interpreted as an indication of strict liability,
then the statute may be effective. Nonetheless, we should keep in mind that the statute will be
interpret by institutional actors who may themselves harbor the same biases about rape that are
expressed by traditional statutes. The court in Reynolds, for example, effectively read
recklessness into an Alaska rape reform law, undoing much of the effort to require consent. The
vagueness of the statute facilitates similar consequences here — a judge coming from a traditional
perspective could easily read in a mens rea of negligence. Moreover, even under a strict liability
interpretation, it’s not entirely clear what is meant by consent. The most progressive statutes,
like WI’s, require affirmative evidence of consent. It is not enough that the victim did not say
“no,” unless there is evidence that the victim said or meant to say “yes.” The idea of affirmative
consent corresponds to a “yes means yes” norm which is even stronger than the “no means no”
norm. It is an effort at culture change, trying to encourage people to take affirmative steps to
insure the consent of their sexual partners, while limiting the power of juries to nullify by finding
consent in cases where a victim was clearly reluctant but did not say no (see, e.g., Berkowitz).
Still, even the WI statute allows affirmative consent to be inferred from words or overt actions.
This checks the risk of overcriminalization. If the proposed statute were more explicit about

requiring affirmative consent or at least strict liability for “no means no,” it would be stronger.

A few additional things come to attention in reading this statute. First, the actus reus of

the state is sexual intercourse. Because sexual intercourse is not defined, it is unclear whether


Exam #3 W’10 Criminal Law/Braman and Harcourt (3/10/2010) Page 5 of 20

the statute is limited to vaginal intercourse, as in the MPC and the MD and NY statutes, or is
more like the more progressive WI statute in criminalizing a broader range of unwanted sexual
contact, including anal and oral sex. If sexual intercourse is narrowly defined, the statute is too
limited in its scope and should be revised or supplemented by a separate statute criminalizing
other forms of unwanted sexual contact. Second, the statute deliberately avoids gendered
language, referring to the victim’s consent using the pronouns “his or her,” and avoiding the use
of gendered pronouns in describing the offender. This is progressive in that it expressively
acknowledges and creates liability for a broader class of victims and offenders. Third, the statute
limits on who can consent are an improvement on, for example the statute used in MTS, since it
would effectively protect sleeping victims unable to consent. The Romeo and Juliet exception
limits the risk of over-criminalizing consensual sex between minors of the same age, while still
protecting minors. Finally, an additional weakness of the statute is that, although it has some
gradations for different offenses, there is not enough guidance for sentencing. The statute lacks
distinctions between different age groups of children and different levels of violence or different
mistakes about consent. The danger, in short, is that some offenders may be punished

excessively or insufficiently, or that punishment may be somewhat arbitrary.

In short, the statute is an improvement over traditional statutes because it eliminates the
force requirement, de-genders rape law, and protects victims unable to consent. It’s weaknesses
are that it lacks sufficient gradation, isn’t sufficiently broad in covering types of unwanted sexual

contact, and is too vague about the mens rea requirement.

Question 4

BH

The section of the code prescribes a defense when several elements are met. First, D must an
officer, employee, member of the Armed Forces, or other agent of the US government. A CIA
officer is an agent of the executive branch of the government, so BH meets this element. Second
the charge must arise out of the agent’s engaging in specific operational practices that involve
detention and interrogation of aliens. Here, BH’s waterboarding of suspects was clearly
undertaken as part of his official CIA duties. Most likely, the victim was an alien, but if he was a
citizen, this will eliminate BH’s defense under the statute. Next, the alien must be determined by
the President or his designees to be engaged in or associated with international terrorist activity
that poses a serious threat to the US. In this case, Cheney has made such a determination, and he

is clearly a designee of the president, so the element is met.

The key challenge for BH will be the last requirement, that the activities were officially
authorized and determined to be lawful at the time that they were conducted, or, in the
alternative, that BH did not know the practices were unlawful and a person of ordinary sense and
understanding would not know either. Since the activities were not determine to be legal by the
courts, the highest authority on the subject (see Albertini), BH cannot claim a mistake of law
defense outside of the statute based on reasonable reliance on an official statement of the law
(see, e.g., MPC 2.04(3)(b)). This should weaken his claim that his activities were officially

authorized. Nonetheless, he may still argue under the statute that he did not know that the


Exam #3 W’10 Criminal Law/Braman and Harcourt (3/10/2010) Page 7 of 20

activity was illegal and an ordinary person would not know. This is weakened by Cheney’s
statement that CIA agents were refusing to waterboard because they think waterboarding is
torture. If this statement includes BH (which is a question of fact which will require more
evidence), it suggests that he did in fact know that the activity was illegal and is not entitled to
the defense. Otherwise, the question will turn on whether a person of ordinary sense and

understanding would know that the practices were unlawful.

On the one hand, the prosecution will argue that absent evidence about BH’s actual knowledge,
it should be common sense that torture, including waterboarding, might be illegal, and an
ordinary person would be expected at the very least to precede with extreme caution and
presume the activity was illegal in the absence of a strong authority to the contrary. Torture is a
malum in se activity, so for the purposes of deterrence and expressive condemnation, we should

be very hesitant to excuse it unless the letter of the law absolutely requires the excuse.

The defense will respond by suggesting that the prosecution is incorrect about the presumption—
torture is not inherently bad if it is used for the purpose of national security, and we should
presume that an agent engaging in a borderline activity such as waterboarding as part of his
official duties is acting in the interest of the country, in the absence of evidence to the contrary.
This is further supported by the notions of legality and lenity, i.e. the notion that we should
presume against punishing people who lack sufficient notice of the criminality of their activities,
and should interpret statutes accordingly. This principle could easily be extended to the

availability of a defense.


Exam #3 W’10 Criminal Law/Braman and Harcourt (3/10/2010) Page 8 of 20

Moreover, the defense will point to the language in the provision to the effect that “good faith
reliance on advice of counsel should be an important factor” in assessing whether a person of
ordinary sense and understanding would have known the practice to be unlawful. The defense
will have a stronger argument that this defense applies to the second instance in which BH
participated in waterboarding. In this second instance, BH relied on an official memo issued by
white house counsel, the highest authority in the executive branch, and should be entitled to do
so, especially because we don’t want to have a chilling effect of CIA agents’ lawful adherence to

the orders of their superiors.

The prosecution will respond by disputing the good faith of BH’s reliance on the memo. BH
knew that the law was unclear about waterboarding, even if he didn’t know it was illegal. He
knew the Bush administration had an incentive to conduct biased legal research, and thus should
have been suspicious of the White House counsel’s advice absent evidence from the highest
authority on the subject, namely the courts. Since part of the purpose of torture prohibitions is to
limit the power of the executive branch to engage in illegal activity, it would defeat the purpose
of the prohibitions if we allowed officials in the executive branch to count as authorities for the
purpose of authorizing torture. Finally, the prosecution will point out that reliance on advice of
counsel is only one factor among others under the statute, and might be counterbalanced by

things like common sense — the intuitive moral knowledge that torture is wrong.

In defending against the first instance of waterboarding, BH will face all of the above arguments,

plus the additional challenge of proving that Addington’s advice qualifies as the advice of


Exam #3 W’10 Criminal Law/Braman and Harcourt (3/10/2010) Page 9 of 20

counsel. Since Addington was speaking as Cheney’s Chief of Staff and not as an attorney, this is
a difficult argument to make. Even without good faith reliance on counsel, the defense can still
claim that a reasonable person would not have known that waterboarding was unlawful after

Addingon told him otherwise, based on the arguments above, but his case will be much weaker.

DB

DB is a civilian, and therefore will have a harder time proving that he meets the first element of
the defense, namely that he be an officer, employee, member of the Armed Forces, or other agent
of the US government. If DB was paid by BH, can claim he was an employee, and since he was
acting in the name of the US government, he can claim that he was an agent, but the prosecution
will argue that these terms should be interpreted narrowly for policy reasons — the provision was
intended primarily to protect officially authorized activities by carefully screened and selected
government employees. Absent such protections, there is a risk that torture may be outsourced

or carried out too broadly.

If DB does not qualify for a defense under the statute, he can also try a common law mistake of
law defense based on reliance on an official statement of the law. As noted above, the highest
authority on the definition of torture is the courts, so this is a tough argument to make. With
regards to the first instance of torture, DB’s mistake of law defense is unlikely to hold up. This
is similar to the US v. Baker, in which one CIA agent acted in reliance on the legal advice of
another. The court found reliance on the statements of a CIA agent to be unreasonable, so it will
probably draw the same conclusion in this case. DB has a stronger defense in the second
instance, where he relied on the memo, but the same arguments as above apply with regards to

the lack of highest authority in the land. Mistake of fact due to reliance on counsel alone is not a


Exam #3 W’10 Criminal Law/Braman and Harcourt (3/10/2010) Page 10 of 20

defense under common law. In Long the court did hold that a mistake of law based on a good
faith reliance on the results of a bona-fide, diligent effort to ascertain the law is a defense, but
this only applies to collateral law, and DB is trying to make a defense about the interpretation of

the law that he is accused of violating (the law prohibiting torture).

Cheney and Addington

Torture is an act crime under the MPC. In order to be charged with complicity, C and A must be
shown to have acted with the purpose of promoting or facilitating the illegal conduct (MPC
§2.06(3)(a)). They must also be shown to have solicited, aided, or attempted to aid in the
commission of that crime. With regards to purpose, the prosecution has a strong case. Cheney
and Addington clearly want the conduct to occur. Their only defense is a mistake of law defense
to the effect that they did not want the crime of torture to occur, they just wanted waterboarding
to occur, which they did not believe to be illegal. Nonetheless, Cheney’s language suggests they
both knew that torture might be illegal — he asks for a legal opinion with a particular conclusion
because he knows that other lawyers might come to a different conclusion. Addington’s assent
indicating that he shares the same knowledge. With regards to soliciting, aiding, or attempting to
aid, C and A can argue that this should be interpreted narrowly to exclude the authoring of legal
memos in order to protect attorneys acting in good faith. However, the arguments above about
preventing the executive branch from using the law as a ruse to bypass prohibitions against
torture suggest that the law should be interpreted broadly, and that making an effort to ensure
that the legal memo answers the question a particular way is a way of aiding the CIA agents in

covering up their conduct.

1.

Question 1

Conspiracy to tamper with a witness

The defense will first argue that SS lacked the agreement required for a conspiracy
charge. Under the MPC, SS must have agree to commit or solicited criminal conduct
(MPC §5.03(1)(a)) or aided in the planning or commission of the act (MPC §5.03(1)(b)),
and he clearly did not do the latter. SS will argue that when he agreed that JM should
help keep HJ quiet, he did not know that JM intended to do so by committing a crime.
After all, JM said he knew HJ, so maybe he was just going to talk to him nicely. The
mens rea for conspiracy under the MPC is purpose (of promoting or facilitating the
crime), so unless they can argue that SS wanted JM to act violently, the prosecution will
have a hard time. They will respond with an alternate interpretation of what SS agreed
to. After all, SS had a great deal of incentive to encourage JM to commit a crime to
prevent HJ from talking, and he didn’t exactly go out of his way to tell JM not to commit
violence. JM was SS’s friend, so he probably knew him well enough to guess that JM
would make a threat. To support this interpretation, the prosecution will cite Lauria,
according to which the mens rea of conspiracy can be inferred when the defendant has a
stake in the illegal venture. If the court adopts Lauria, the prosecution is likely to defeat

SS’s argument, because SS did have a clear stake in JM threatening HJ.

Moreover, SS will argue that even if he did agree, JM did not actually tamper with a
witness, so there is no crime. The prosecution will refute the conclusion that JM did not

tamper with a witness (see below), and will also point out that conspiracy is an inchoate


Exam #3 W’10 Criminal Law/Braman and Harcourt (3/10/2010) Page 12 of 20

crime, so it is not necessary that the offense be carried out, as long as there is an overt act
taken towards in completion (MPC §5.03(5)). The overt act requirement is easily met,

and will likely be satisfied by JM’s discussion with HJ.

Unless SS can provide some direct evidence in support of his claim that he didn’t know

or intend for JM to threaten HJ, the prosecution has the stronger argument here.

2. Attempted tampering with a witness —SS cannot be charged for tampering or attempting
tampering directly since he did not kill, attempt to kill, use physical force, or threaten
physical force himself. He will have to be charged under an accomplice liability theory.
SS’s first argument will be similar to that above — he will argue that he did not intend for
JM to threaten violence. Tampering with a witness is an act crime under the MPC. The
MPC requires that a defendant solicit (MPC §2.06(3)(a)(i)) or aid or attempt to aid (MPC
§2.06(3)(a)(ii)) in the commission of the offense, and must do so with the purpose of
promoting or facilitating the act. The defense will argue that SS had no such purpose.
The prosecution’s response will be similar to the above argument, except that they will be
unable to cite Lauria to support an inference of purpose from SS’s stake in the venture.
They can still argue that the inference should be drawn since it is logical, but they will
have a harder burden of proof absent direct evidence that SS intend for JM to threaten HJ.

Absent such evidence, SS will likely prevail here.

The second question will involve whether JM committed the underlying offense.

Unlikely conspiracy, which is an inchoate crime, SS cannot be convicted of complicity


Exam #3 W’10 Criminal Law/Braman and Harcourt (3/10/2010) Page 13 of 20

for attempted tampering unless such tampering actually occurred. SS will argue that JM
did not intend to threaten physical force against HJ when he said “it would be better for

you” — he merely meant that it would save HJ a lot of trouble going to court, and maybe
SS would volunteer to make it easier for HJ to recover damages for the accident if HJ

kept the drunk driving charge off of SS’s record.

The prosecution will respond that JM can be charged with attempt under a last step
theory. According to such a theory, it is sufficient that JM acted with the belief that the
act would cause an illegal result without further conduct on his part. Thus, it would be
sufficient that JM believed HJ would feel threatened. While JM was carefully to avoid an
explicit threat, his intention to threaten is transparent, and it is likely that a jury will be
convinced. As Smallwood notes, specific intent can be inferred from an intentional act if
the natural and probable consequences of that act is to cause the criminal result. JM’s
intentional act was speaking the words he spoke. The natural and probable consequences
of those words was to make HJ feel threatened, so the court can reasonably infer intent.
The prosecution has a strong case on this argument, but will still likely have trouble

proving SS’s intent, absent direct evidence.

Tampering with a witness — SS’s complicity argument, stated above, will apply again,

and once again the prosecution will have trouble winning absent direct evidence of SS’s
intentions. However, if they have such evidence, they have a shot. The defense will still
dispute whether the underlying offense took place, however. They will argue that the

statute requires a stronger level of intent than the attempt statute. D must intentionally


Exam #3 W’10 Criminal Law/Braman and Harcourt (3/10/2010) Page 14 of 20

threaten physical force, and must do so knowingly and willfully with the intent to

influence the testimony of a witness

The prosecution will have no trouble proving JM’s intent to influence HJ’s testimony —
he agreed to do exactly that, and he directly told HJ to forget the very facts he would be
testifying about. They will also note that the mens rea for “threatening physical force” is
recklessness, since under the MPC, if no mens rea is specified for an element of a crime,
the court should read in recklessness (MPC §2.02(3)). Thus, JM need only recklessly
threaten physical force as long as he intends to influence HJ’s testimony. This is an
easier standard to meet even than attempt, as above. Even if JM didn’t know that his
words would be interpreted as a threat, it is almost certain that he disregarded a
substantial and unjustifiable risk that they would be interpreted that way, and that this
would be a gross deviation from a law-abiding person’s behavior (MPC §2.02(2)(c)).
Still, as with the attempt charge, the prosecution will have trouble prosecution SS for
complicity.

4. Solicitation to tamper with a witness — since it was noted above that SS can only be

charged for tampering or attempted tampering under a theory of complicity, this charge is
essentially equivalent to the charge of tampering with a witness as discussed above. See

the arguments SS’s lack of intent at the start of the discussion of attempted tampering.

5. Attempted manslaughter — SS has two key defenses. The first is to dispute his liability

for JM’s actions. Manslaughter is a result crime, so under MPC §2.06(4), SS is only

liable if he has the complicity sufficient for the underlying offense. The mens rea for


Exam #3 W’10 Criminal Law/Braman and Harcourt (3/10/2010) Page 15 of 20

manslaughter is recklessness, so the prosecution must prove that SS consciously
disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk of HJ’s death when he agreed that JM
should talk to HJ. It will be nearly impossible to prove this absent evidence that JM said
he was going to kill HJ. There was a risk, yes, that JM’s confrontation with HJ might
result in violence, but it certainly was not substantial. SS will likely be spared conviction

under a complicity theory.

Even if SS does have the requisite complicity, complicity is not an inchoate crime, so JM
must still be found guilty of attempted manslaughter. The defense will dispute this on
two grounds. First, it will argue that JM was acting in self-defense because HJ was
pulling something shiny out of his pocket that JM believed to be a knife. The use of
deadly force in self defense requires that the defendant be responding to a threat of death
or serious bodily harm (MPC §3.04(2)), so the prosecution will respond that the object
was not a knife, and that there was no such threat. However, the defense will note that
this is based on a belief standard. The prosecution will respond that, under MPC
§3.09(2), for crimes like manslaughter with a mens rea of recklessness, it is not a defense
if the belief was formed recklessly. The prosecution will argue that JM was reckless in
concluding that a shiny object was necessarily a knife. This will come down to a jury’s
subjective assessment of the probability that the object was a knife. It will help SS’s case

if the object was in fact a knife.

The prosecution will also refute the self-defense charge on the grounds that deadly force
is not available if a defendant was provoked. The defense will respond that HJ provoked

the altercation when he punched JM in the stomach. However, the prosecution will


Exam #3 W’10 Criminal Law/Braman and Harcourt (3/10/2010) Page 16 of 20

respond convincingly that JM provoked the punch by threatening HJ. The self-defense

claim will likely fail, therefore

Finally, the defenses will dispute whether Jackson had an intent sufficient to the charge
of manslaughter. Citing Lyerla, they will argue that it is impossible to intend to
recklessly murder someone. This is consistent with MPC §5.01(1)(b). Unless the
prosecution can prove that JM intended his actions to result in JM’s death, they will fail
to prove attempt, and thus fail to get SS under an accomplice liability theory. SS will

likely prevail on this count, therefore.


Exam #3 W’10 Criminal Law/Braman and Harcourt (3/10/2010) Page 17 of 20

Question 2
Becker, Kelman, and Braman would all agree that the legitimation effect has been a
major effect of death penalty reform, and would likely conclude based on this

analysis that the reform has been ineffective.

Gary Becker argues that the purpose of the criminal justice system should be to
minimize the social costs of crime. He would thus assess the death penalty in terms
of the costs of implementation as compared to the reduction in the social harms of
crimes that it generates. Steiker and Steiker’s observe that death penalty reform has
created a burdensome system of regulations, including a long and costly appellate
process. Becker would see this as a contribution to the cost of implementing the
death penalty. However, as Steiker and Steiker note, the reform has generated
negligible improvements over the pre-Furman era. Therefore, Becker would note that
reform has done little to effect the social costs of crime. If the death penalty were
ever a cost-effective means of deterring crime or reducing other social costs such as
the risk of “blood feuds” for retribution, then Becker might be concerned if death
penalty reform reduced the incidence of the death penalty. However, as the dissent in
Gregg notes, the death penalty achieves neither of these aims. Moreover, it results in
the taking of a life that might be productive to society, even while still in prison (ex.
making license plates?). Thus, the death penalty increases the social costs of crime,
and Becker should support its abolition. If the reform merely succeeds in legitimating
the death penalty for actors within the system (what S & S call “internal

legitimation’’) and for the public at large (what S & S call “particular external


Exam #3 W’10 Criminal Law/Braman and Harcourt (3/10/2010) Page 18 of 20

legitimation), then Becker would be concerned that it merely entrenches an inefficient
practice. However, Becker might see one form of legitimation, namely “general
external legitimation” of the criminal justice system as a whole, as beneficial because
it encourages voluntary compliance with the law, reducing the cost of law

enforcement in areas unrelated to the death penalty.

Don Braman would note that the critique of death penalty reform discussed by S & S
is made from two different political perspectives. On the one hand, those that favor
the death penalty believe that post-Furman reform has simply made the death penalty
more difficult to administer. On the other hand, those the oppose the death penalty
believe that the regulations have not done enough to eliminate the penalty. Braman
would account for the differences between the conclusions of these two parties based
on differences in interpretation of the facts. Rather than reaching conclusions about
the facts in an ideologically motivated way to support pre-formed, ideological
commitments, these people will simply assess the facts differently based on their
cultural perspective. Thus, people who support the death penalty might be more
likely to assume that people on death row are actually guilty, while people who
oppose it might pay more attention to evidence such as the Baldus study suggesting
that the death penalty is administered in racially biased an inconsistent ways. The
effect of death penalty reform as legitimation is to superficially undercut the
arguments of this latter group. Even though the Baldus study shows that the death
penalty is still disproportionately administered post-Furman, its easier to dismiss this

evidence or conclude that it is the product of an alternate cause in the face of evidence


Exam #3 W’10 Criminal Law/Braman and Harcourt (3/10/2010) Page 19 of 20

that the death penalty is carefully regulated. Since, Braman notes, people are not
consciously distorting the facts to support their conclusions, their interpretations of
the facts may still be susceptible to influence from arguments that the death penalty is
carefully regulated — if people formed their conclusions in a purely ideological way in
advance of the facts, legitimation would have no effect. Braman would thus suggest
that the best way to oppose the death penalty would be to present evidence to the
public at large that it is still carried out in a racially biased way. People might still
interpret this additional evidence in a way that supported their cultural perceptions,

but at the very least, they might be influenced.

Kelman believes that law is rhetoric, a series of devices for framing and resolving
cases. He would see the legitimation effect as an effect of framing as well — the
reason more people are willing to accept the death penalty is that they see it in the
context of a system of regulations that supposedly provides checks on inappropriate
executions. For example, the system of regulations might make the difference
between a broad or narrow view of the defendant, similar to the two ideological polls
discussed above in relation to Braman’s response. Some people might view
defendants broadly as “people on death row,” a class of people who has been put
through a rigorous system; others might look more closely at their individual
characteristics and the characteristics of their particular convictions, and thus be less
