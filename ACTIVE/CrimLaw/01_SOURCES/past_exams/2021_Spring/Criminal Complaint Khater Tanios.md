STATEMENT OF FACTS

On January 6, 2021, your affiant, Riley Palmertree, was on duty and performing my official
duties as a Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”). I have been a Special
Agent since 2017 and, in additional to my regular duties, | am currently also tasked with
investigating criminal activity that occurred in and around the Capitol grounds on January 6, 2021.
As a Special Agent, I am authorized by law or by a Government agency to engage in or supervise
the prevention, investigation, or prosecution of a violation of Federal criminal laws.

The information contained in this affidavit is based on my knowledge of the investigation
and information provided by other law enforcement officers. Because this statement of facts is
being submitted for the limited purpose of establishing facts sufficient for the charges in the
complaint, I have not included each and every fact known to me concerning this investigation. I
have set forth only the facts that I believe are necessary to establish probable cause to believe that
evidence exists of violations of the following statutes: 18 U.S.C. §§ 111 (a) and (b) (Assaulting an
Officer of the United States with a deadly or dangerous weapon); 18 U.S.C. § 372 (Conspiracy to
injure an officer); 18 U.S.C. § 231 (Civil Disorder); 18 U.S.C. § 1512(c)(2) (Obstruction of an
Official Proceeding); 18 U.S.C. § 1752(a) and (b) (Physical violence on restricted grounds, while
carrying dangerous weapon, and resulting in significant bodily injury); 40 U.S.C. § 5104(e)(2)(f)
(Violent Entry, Disorderly Conduct and act of physical violence on Capitol Grounds); and 18
U.S.C. 2 (Aiding and Abetting).

1. Background

The U.S. Capitol is secured 24 hours a day by U.S. Capitol Police. Restrictions around the
U.S. Capitol include permanent and temporary security barriers and posts manned by U.S. Capitol
Police. Only authorized people with appropriate identification are allowed access inside the U.S.
Capitol. On January 6, 2021, the exterior plaza of the U.S. Capitol was also closed to members of
the public.

On January 6, 2021, a joint session of the United States Congress convened at the United
States Capitol, which is located at First Street, SE, in Washington, D.C. During the joint session,
elected members of the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate were
meeting in separate chambers of the United States Capitol to certify the vote count of the Electoral
College of the 2020 Presidential Election, which had taken place on November 3, 2020. The joint
session began at approximately 1:00 p.m. Shortly thereafter, by approximately 1:30 p.m., the
House and Senate adjourned to separate chambers to resolve a particular objection. Vice President
Mike Pence was present and presiding, first in the joint session, and then in the Senate chamber.

As the proceedings continued in both the House and the Senate, and with Vice President
Mike Pence present and presiding over the Senate, a large crowd gathered outside the U.S. Capitol.
As noted above, temporary and permanent barricades were in place around the exterior of the U.S.
Capitol building, and U.S. Capitol Police were present and attempting to keep the crowd away
from the Capitol building and the proceedings underway inside.


At such time, the certification proceedings were still underway and the exterior doors and
windows of the U.S. Capitol were locked or otherwise secured. Members of the U.S. Capitol Police
attempted to maintain order and keep the crowd from entering the Capitol; however, shortly around
2:00 p.m., individuals in the crowd forced entry into the U.S. Capitol, including by breaking
windows and by assaulting members of the U.S. Capitol Police, as others in the crowd encouraged
and assisted those acts.

Shortly thereafter, at approximately 2:20 p.m. members of the United States House of
Representatives and United States Senate, including the President of the Senate, Vice President
Mike Pence, were instructed to—and did—evacuate the chambers. Accordingly, the joint session
of the United States Congress was effectively suspended until shortly after 8:00 p.m. Vice
President Pence remained in the United States Capitol from the time he was evacuated from the
Senate Chamber until the sessions resumed.

During national news coverage of the aforementioned events, video footage which
appeared to be captured on mobile devices of persons present on the scene depicted evidence of
violations of local and federal law, including scores of individuals inside the U.S. Capitol building
without authority to be there.

2. Defendants’ Assault on Federal Officers

At approximately 1:00 p.m., a crowd of violent rioters had assembled on the Lower West
Terrace. U. S. Capitol Police had formed a line of bike racks extending from the North end of the
Lower West Terrace to the South end, to act as a barrier against the crowd. Officers were standing
watch behind this line and fending off repeated attempts by the rioters to pull on the bike racks,
either with their hands or with ropes and straps.

In reviewing surveillance footage of this incident, your affiant observed the defendants,
JULIAN ELIE KHATER and GEORGE PIERRE TANIOS, working together to assault law
enforcement officers with an unknown chemical substance by spraying officers directly in the face
and eyes. Your affiant further observed these defendants appeared to time the deployment of
chemical substances to coincide with other rioters’ efforts to forcibly remove the bike rack barriers
that were preventing the rioters from moving closer to the Capitol building.

Surveillance footage shows that at 2:09 p.m., TANIOS can be seen walking from the south
grassy area toward the Lower West Terrace. KHATER can be seen walking behind TANIOS.
KHATER is wearing a beanie with a pom-pom on top, a dark jacket, and has a beard. TANIOS is
wearing a red hat, black backpack, dark hooded sweatshirt, and has a beard. At 2:14 p.m., TANIOS
and KHATER can be seen engaging each other in animated conversation while they are standing
together.

During the investigation, law enforcement discovered open source media video of the
incident from January 6, 2021. On the video, KHATER is seen making his way towards TANIOS.
KHATER then states, “Give me that bear shit,” and reaches into the backpack on TANIOS’ back.
TANIOS then states, “Hold on, hold on, not yet, not yet... its still early.” KHATER is then seen


emphatically telling TANIOS, “They just fucking sprayed me,” and KHATER is seen holding a
white can with a black top that appears to be a can of chemical spray. See Figure One, below.

Figure One

This verbal exchange between KHATER and TANIOS, together with KHATER’s
retrieval of the spray can from TANIOS, reveals that the two were working in concert and had a
plan to use the toxic spray against law enforcement.

On the video, KHATER continues to talk animatedly with TANIOS. At approximately
2:20 p.m., KHATER walks through the crowd to within a few steps of the bike rack barrier.
KHATER is standing directly across from a line of law enforcement officers to include U.S.
Capitol Police (“USCP”) Officers B. Sicknick and C. Edwards, and Metropolitan Police
Department (“MPD”) Officer D. Chapman, who was equipped with a functioning body worn
camera (“BWC”) device.

Officer Chapman’s BWC shows that at 2:23 p.m., the rioters begin pulling on a bike rack
to Chapman’s left, using ropes and their hands to pull the rack away. Seconds later, KHATER is
observed with his right arm up high in the air, appearing to be holding a canister in his right hand
and aiming it in the officers’ direction while moving his right arm from side to side. Officer
Chapman’s BWC confirms that KHATER was standing only five to eight feet away from the
officers. See Figure Two, below.

Figure Two

In reviewing the surveillance footage and BWC video, your affiant observes that Officers
Sicknick, Edwards and Chapman, who are standing within a few feet of KHATER, all react, one
by one, to something striking them in the face. The officers immediately retreat from the line, bring
their hands to their faces and rush to find water to wash out their eyes, as described in further detail
below and as captured in the following screen shots. See Figures Three and Four, below.

Figure Four

At 2:23 p.m., on the surveillance footage, KHATER is again observed raising his arm and
continues to spray in the direction of law enforcement officers. MPD Lt. Bagshaw notices these
actions and approaches KHATER. At 2:23 p.m., Lt. Bagshaw then sprays KHATER, as observed
on both surveillance footage and Lt. Bagshaw’s BWC. See Figure Five, below.

3. Injuries to Officers

Officers Sicknick, Edwards, and Chapman suffered injuries as a result of being sprayed in
the face with an unknown substance by KHATER. The officers were temporary blinded by the
substance, were temporary disabled from performing their duties and needed medical attention and
assistance from fellow officers. They were initially treated with water in an effort to wash out the
unknown substance from their eyes and on their face. All three officers were incapacitated and
unable to perform their duties for at least 20 minutes or longer while they recovered from the spray.
Officer Edwards reported lasting injuries underneath her eyes, including scabbing that remained
on her face for weeks. Officers Edwards and Chapman also described the spray to their face as a
substance as strong as, if not stronger than, any version of pepper spray they had been exposed to
during their training as law enforcement officers. Officer Sicknick reported to his supervisors and
colleagues that he had been sprayed in the face with a substance.

4. Identification of the Defendants

Based on the above surveillance footage, law enforcement prepared flyers with
photographs of KHATER and TANIOS, which were published along with other individuals
involved in the violence at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. Defendant KHATER was listed
as subject number 190. Defendant TANIOS was listed as subject number 254. A tipster to the FBI
provided information that TANIOS and KHATER knew each other and grew up together in New
Jersey. ‘

Identification of JULIAN KHATER

During the investigation, law enforcement received information from a tipster regarding
subject 190. The tipster relayed that the subject was the same person who owned a Linkedin page
belonging to JULIAN KHATER.

Based on a review of this Linkedin page, law enforcement identified and spoke by
telephone to W-1. W-1 stated IT was a former work colleague of KHATER. Your affiant provided
W-1 an image of subject 190, and W-1 positively identified the individual as “Julian” and stated
IT was “100% sure” the individual was “Julian,” whom IT knew from working together at a food
establishment in State College, Pennsylvania. W-1 saw KHATER approximately three to four
times per week from July 2019 to November 2019, and last saw KHATER in November 2019. W-
1 did not immediately remember KHATER’s last name, but looked up an old work document that
listed Julian’s last name as KHATER.

Identification of GEORGE TANIOS

During the investigation, law enforcement received two tips that included a photo posted
on social media of TANIOS at the Capitol on January 6, 2021. See Figure Six, below.

The tipsters stated that the photo was from a Facebook page belonging to an individual
named “GEORGE PIERRE TANIOS” and confirmed that TANIOS was wearing clothing with the
insignia of “Sandwich University” in both his profile picture and his picture at the Capitol. Your
affiant notes that the hooded sweatshirt that TANIOS is wearing in the Capitol picture appears
identical to the sweatshirt worn by TANIOS in the surveillance video, as seen below in Figure
Seven:

Figure Seven

Another tipster reported to law enforcement that BOLO 254 looked “very close” to George
Pierre Tanios from New Jersey, and that TANIOS had bragged about going to the insurrection at
the Capitol on Facebook. The tipster also indicated that TANIOS owns the “Fat Sandwich”
restaurant.


Utilizing a public records database, law enforcement located a GEORGE PIERRE
TANIOS, born in New Brunswick, NJ, and found the below photograph (Figure Eight) of TANIOS
at his business in Morgantown, West Virginia.

Figure Eight

TANIOS is wearing a shirt with a Sandwich University logo identical to the clothing seen
in both his social media post and the Capitol surveillance footage. A search of social media also
revealed a profile of an individual named “George Pierre Tanios,” with the username
“kingofthefatsandwich.”

Law enforcement interviewed W-2 and provided two images of TANIOS for W-2 to
review. Upon viewing the two images of TANIOS, W-2 positively identified the individual in the
photos as TANIOS. W-2 stated that IT was “100%” sure the individual in one photo was TANIOS,
and “pretty sure” the individual in the second photo was TANIOS. W-2 has known TANIOS for
15 years, and they are former business partners. W-2 reported that IT was in a legal dispute with
TANIOS where TANIOS reportedly embezzled $435,000 from their former business.
