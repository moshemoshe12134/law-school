Exam #2 Criminal Law, Professor Harcourt -l-

Question 1
Defendant 1: Calvin Hollins II (“C3”)

Charge 1: Manslaughter

The first person I would charge as the county prosecutor would be C3, the manager of the
club, and the first charge would be manslaughter. I would not bring a charge of murder because
that would require a mens rea of extreme recklessness manifesting extreme indifference to
human life under MPC §210.2. Though I could argue that allowing 1,000 people into the club
with a capacity of 240 could be extremely reckless, it hardly seems to arise to the types of
conducts under which recklessness would be presumed, such as a robbery or rape. Hence, to
maintain credibility in front of a jury, the first charge I would bring is manslaughter under 210.3.
This would require a mens rea of recklessness which I would argue is fulfilled because C3 was in
charge of the day to day operations of the club and would have known of the risks that
overcrowding created. I would point specifically to the contract which allowed for 500 people
even though the capacity (if the club was even allowed to be open) was 240. I would also argue
that the safety code violations serve as evidence of recklessness, similar to the Welansky case.
The deaths would fulfill the actus reus requirement. C3’s attorney could make two defenses.
First, the attorney could contend that C3 was not knowledgeable of the risk and hence did not
have the relevant mens rea. This would be because the fire violations that the building was cited
for did not lead to the harm in the case and because C3 thought the club could be open, but only
that the upstairs portion of the club had to be closed. C3’s attorney could also argue that the
causation requirement of the MPC (§2.03) had not been met because there was an intervening
cause so that the harm was not within the risk as required by §2.03 subsection 3 when the mens
rea of the crime is recklessness. C3’s attorney could contend that there was an intervening cause,
that of the bouncers. I would respond first that there were numerous warnings that C3 would
have been aware of with the risks the club posed. As but two examples, the community
organization letter that was sent would have indicated to C3 that the club posed a danger and the
fact that the club’s capacity was only 240 should have been sufficient to illustrate to C3 that
filling the club to 5 times capacity would be dangerous. C3 was also the one who most likely
entered into the contract which provided for nearly two times the clubs capacity and that would
show he know of the risk of overcrowding and consciously avoided it. As for the causation
elements, I would argue that the very reason you have capacity requirements is because
overcapacity creates dangers of people not being able to get out. Whether this is due to fires or
fights is irrelevant, the danger is created by having too many people in the building. Again I
would analogize to Wellansky in which the prosecution did not have to show that Wellansky had
actually caused the specific harm, because the general harm posed by the lack of clear fire exits
was enough.
Defendant 2: Dwain Kyles

Charge: Manslaughter

I would also charge Dwain Kyles with manslaughter. The mens rea would be fulfilled
because he was the principal owner and frequented the club so would have been aware of the risk
and disregarded it. Kyles’s defense attorney would likely submit the same arguments that C3
would, that is, he didn’t have the requisite mens rea and that the possible safety violations were
not the proximate cause of the deaths. Kyles could add additional support to the lack of mens rea
argument by claiming he was not in charge of the day to day operations of the club. I would
respond that he had frequented the club regularly and this shows the requisite knowledge and


Exam #2 Criminal Law, Professor Harcourt -2-

disregard to prove the mens rea of recklessness. Moreover, he was the principle owner and likely
communicated with C3 regularly, though we would have to investigate this.
Defendant 3: Calvin Hollins (CH)

Charge: Negligent Homicide

I would charge CH with negligent homicide under MPC 210.4, rather than manslaughter
because CH was a silent partner and had not visited the club, so I would have a difficult time
arguing that he was actually aware of the danger. However, negligent homicide only requires that
he should have been aware. I would argue that as the owner of a night club, especially one that
you put your son in charge of, should maintain some interest in seeing that it is kept safe (if we
investigate further and find that his son regularly communicated to him about the business and its
operations then I would charge him with manslaughter and the discussion would be similar to
that of Kyles). A reasonable person would keep track of his investments and hence should have
known of the risks the club posed from the safety violations and repeated overcrowding. CH’s
defense lawyer could argue he shouldn’t have known because he had trusted his partner and his
son to keep him updated and they may have failed to do so. Perhaps CH is a large investor and
then might not be expected to keep track of all his properties. I would respond that we should not
let an owner off for feigned ignorance, otherwise all investors could avoid responsibility simply
by staying away from their investments.
Defendant 4: Le Mirage All Night Studios (LM)

Charge: Manslaughter

The next charge I would bring would be LM as a corporation under §2.07. 1 would argue
that the offense of keeping the club open against the court order and in light of the fire safety
violations provides the requisite actus reus under 1(a) and 1(b). Additionally, based on the proof
given for the charges against the partners discussed supra, I would argue that the offense was
recklessly tolerated by the board/high managerial agents. Thus, I would be ultimately charging
the corporation with manslaughter similar to McIlwain school bus lines, though under the MPC
this might be harder if a fine could not be imposed. For this charge I would point out that
operating the club in light of the safety violations was clearly in the scope of employment. LM’s
defense attorney could argue that the club had not violated any safety provisions first, because
the court order to stay closed did not apply to the club as a whole, and second that the blocked
exits did not contribute to the deaths. I would respond that even if this were true (and I would
contest that the club was allowed to be open), the club was still over capacity. LM could try and
argue that this wasn’t their responsibility, because they had rented the claim out to another
promoter. However, the contract that LM entered into still allowed for too many people and LM
was helping with security the night that over 1,000 people were let in. Similar to Hilton, we
should not absolve the company unless it exercised due diligence, which didn’t happen here. (For
this entire discussion I assumed LM was incorporated. I am not sure if a charge under 2.07 can
be brought against a partnership).
Defendant Marco Flores (MF)

Charge: Manslaughter

The next charge I would bring would be for manslaughter against MF. I would argue that
MF was on the seen and so knew of the risk from overcrowding, meaning he was reckless
because he was in charge of the security that had let too many people in. MF could argue that he
was not aware that the exits were not wide enough because he was not the club owner.
Additionally, he could argue that he was not aware that his security guards would use mace,
which seemed to set off the stampede. I would respond that MF was in charge of the entire


Ww

Exam #2 Criminal Law, Professor Harcourt -

operation, including the security guards who were acting in the scope of their employment. Like
the discussion of LM, he should not be absolved of liability if he did not exercise due diligence
in controlling the crowd and his security guards. Moreover, he let more people in then even the
contract allowed for and it was his promotions that lead to this catastrophe, so recklessness is
appropriate because he would have been aware of how many people were attending the party.
Defendant: Envy Entertainment (EE)

Charge: Corporate Liability/Manslaughter

(Again, I am unsure if Envy Entertainment is a corporation, but I will go forward
assuming that it is). 1 would charge EE with liability for the acts of MF. MF was clearly working
in the scope of his employment and I would claim EE authorized that performance by entering
into the contract with the club that said the amount of people that could be in the club was
greater than the club’s capacity. EE’s defense counsel could argue that they were not aware of
the dangers posed by the club nor that the club may not have been open because these things
were the responsibility of the club owners. I would respond that, again similar to Hilton, EE
should not be able to escape liability simply because they did not exercise enough care in
examining the venue. Additionally, it was EE security guards that helped let too many people
through the door. This would be good for EE because it would mean more cover charges would
be paid, hence it would be in the scope of employment.
Defendant Joe Braxton (JB)

Charge 1: Assault

The first charge I would bring against Joe Braxton would be assault under §211.1 for the
use of the mace which would have caused bodily injury to the women it was used on. JB’s
defense attorney can respond that he was not the one who used the mace, but it was Johnson. He
could also argue that he was threatened by the women in the fight. My response to the first
charge would require more investigation, my response to the second would be that the force
could not have been immediately necessary, as these were two women and if JB is a bouncer my
guess is he is a fairly large man. I would argue that a mistake of law defense could not apply
because JB is trained as a bouncer and so would be negligent in not realizing that he should not
have used spray, but only restrained the women or called for more help from other bouncers. JB
could argue that spray is normally used in clubs, but I would argue that this night was unique
because of the overcrowding and JB should have known he needed to exercise additional care.

Charge 2: Manslaughter

The next charge I would bring against JB would be for manslaughter. As a bouncer, I
would argue that JB should have been aware of the risk that spraying mace or pepper spray in an
extremely crowded club would create. His decision to still use the spray in light of this danger
would constitute the appropriate mens rea under §210.3 and the deaths would constitute the actus
reus. JB could assert the same self defense claim already discussed, and my answer would be the
same. The stronger argument JB’s defense attorney can make is that the prosecution can’t prove
the necessary causation elements required by §2.03. This case is similar to Regina v. Martin
Dyos in that we can’t isolate an exact cause. It is possible that JB was not a but for cause because
Tracey Johnson could also have used the spray. Additionally, the crowd incited the stampede, so
JB’s attorney could argue that the harm was not within the risk that he should have foreseen in
using spray. My response would be that JB is a trained bouncer and should have foreseen the risk
because it is to be expected in a crowded club that if you start spraying a dangerous chemical
people might flee.

Charge 3: Reckless Endangerment


Exam #2 Criminal Law, Professor Harcourt -4-

If I thought the manslaughter charges were not strong enough after further investigation, I
would still bring a charge against JB of reckless endangerment. This would reduce my burden as
a prosecutor of proving the deaths were within the risk. I would argue that JB was guilty because
the use of spray would endanger others in the club, even if he couldn’t foresee that death would
result. The defenses and my response would mirror the discussion supra.

Defendant Tracey Johnson (TJ)
Charges: Assault and Manslaughter (and possibly Reckless Endangerment)
These discussions would be the exact same as the discussion for JB.

Defendant Jane McMannon (JM)

Charge: Assault

I would charge JM with assault based on the fight which would show the relevant actus
reus and mens rea because she would have caused bodily harm to Terri Jones. The defenses and
charges here would require more information however, because she could have been acting in
self-defense (we would need to know who the aggressor was).

Charge: Negligent Homicide

I would also charge JM with negligent homicide for her involvement in the fight. 1 would
argue that the mens rea is established because she should have been aware that fighting in a
crowded club could lead to a stampede. JM’s defense attorney could argue that it was not a
proximate cause because the use of pepper spray was an intervening cause, similar to what we
saw in the Kevorkian case. I would argue that JM should have known that the bouncers would
respond in some way and that this way could have entailed the use of a spray considering it was
a common occurrence at the clubs such as this one.

Additionally, JM may be able to assert a claim of self defense. To evaluate this claim
would require more knowledge about the fight, such as who was the initiator.

Defendant: Terri Jones

Charges: Assault and Negligent Homicide

These charges would mirror those discussed supra involving JM.
Defendant: Chicago Fire Department/J ames J oyce/Larry Langford
(collectively, “The fire department)

Charge: Manslaughter

I am not sure I would bring this charge, because I believe as a public official and public
office the fire department would be immune (the only thing I could find was §3.03 the Execution
of Public Duty which only applies to cases where a public officer uses force, which doesn’t seem
applicable here). However, if that were not the case I would charge the fire department with
manslaughter because of their failure to inspect the upstairs club when they visited the
downstairs restaurant and their failure to call for backup immediately after receiving 9-1-1 calls.
The inspection should have taken place because if the fire department knew of the order to keep
the club closed the bare minimum they could have done is checked at the club entrance. It is
likely that the club would have had promotional material out that would be inconsistent with the
fire department’s believe that the club was closed. Additionally, once the fire department
received 9-1-1 calls they should have called for backup. The 9-1-1 calls provide the requisite
knowledge and they also told the fire department that there were thousands of people in the club
who were choking. The fire department can claim that the appropriate mens rea was not present
because of the court order to keep the club closed. Additionally, they can claim that there was no
reason for them to immediately call for backup after receiving the 9-1-1 calls because standard
procedure was to contact the firemen on the scene and calls from a nightclub don’t give a reason


Exam #2 Criminal Law, Professor Harcourt -5-

to justify deviating from that procedure (the people most likely sounded drunk, it could have
sounded like a party, etc). Once the fire department dispatch could not reach the firemen on the
scene, they did call for backup. My response would be that the fire department should have
known the meaning of the court order and any possible side deals the club owners would have
cut with the city, as it is their duty to inspect these buildings. Moreover, when you can hear
choking on the phone you shouldn’t disregard it and as soon as the fire department couldn’t
reach the men on the scene they should have called for backup.

Question 2

There is always a difficulty in attempting to create a grand unifying theory of literature as
diverse as that which we read in this course because inevitably there will be outliers. In the
following essay I will attempt to generate some overall themes that categorize the differences
between module II and the theories of punishment/textbook readings and then I will examine
how the “outliers” to those themes help refine our understanding. My ultimate conclusion will be
that the textbook readings are constrained to only two views of punishment and never examine
how to make a choice between those two views, whereas the module II readings expand the
lenses through which we can view punishment and, more importantly, examine why we would
make a choice between these competing views. Ultimately then, the module II readings and the
textbook/theories of punishment readings are complimentary because they expand both our
options for and understanding of criminal punishment.

Examining the theories of punishment readings first, I found that an underlying theme of
these readings was that there was hardly any evaluation of how we make choices between
different theories of punishment. Instead, these readings would argue that one theory was more
apt and would then tell us how to achieve that theory, but never examined why or how we would
be more likely to make that choice. As an example, Beccaria’s On Crimes and Punishments
outlines a utilitarian philosophy and then explains why that philosophy would be self-limiting
because you would never seek out to punish beyond what would marginally deter. The Wilson
article than examines how we can achieve that goal, perhaps through selective incapacitation.
The Brathwaite article does the same, asking when shaming can be more or less beneficial to
society. The running theme of these articles is that punishment is taken as a given, and the
question is what punishment should achieve and how. At most, there is only a facial examination
of how different lenses through which we could view punishment alter what punishments we
decide to give. For example, the Beccaria, utilitarian paper is contrasted with the Kant,
retributive paper. The two theories are set in opposition and each is critiqued, but how and why
we would make a choice between the two theories is never fully explicated.

In stark contrast, a vast majority of the module two articles ask not how to achieve certain
ends, but how the very choice of what end to achieve is made. For example, Balkin examines the
dyadic rule choices that characterize legal thought. In so doing, he attempts to map the way legal
choices are made. At the top of Balkin’s pyramid is the choice between communitarianism and
individualism. This can easily be mapped onto the choice between utilitarianism, which is
socially focused, and retributivism, which is individually focused. These two aims of punishment
were the principle focus of the textbook section on why we punish. Thus, Balkin can be seen as
categorizing how we make the choice between retributivism and utilitarianism, rather than
simply what the implications of each choice are. This is differentiated from the textbook which
asks which choice we should make, but never really examines how or why we make that choice.
Foucault would be another module two example that is explicit in its examination of why choices


Exam #2 Criminal Law, Professor Harcourt -6-

are made, rather than an evaluation of those individual choices. While I would hesitate to place
Balkin and Foucault in the same box for other reasons, they are emblematic of the theme that
module two examines how we make choices, versus what the difference between those choices
would be. The Coombs article is also emblematic of this trend. In Putting Women First Coombs
essentially argues that the criminal law should be viewed through a female lens (on a sidenote, I
apologize for bastardizing a lot of these summaries. Such is the nature of a short exam I guess,
but I am trying to stay away from long winded summaries as best I can, though I fear it does the
authors an injustice). As such, Coombs is evaluating how we would make choices between
competing alternatives if we viewed them through different lenses. This two can be mapped onto
the textbook articles. For example, in her discussion Coombs explains that if we use a male
perspective certain characteristics of individual males, such as family connections, can be
overlooked. This would map onto a retributive perspective of punishment easily, because
essentially Coombs would be arguing that a male perspective leads to a punishment that the male
criminal might not deserve. But rather than evaluating retributivism vs. utilitarianism, Coombs is
analyzing what lens should guide that choice. The implications of the lens are only relevant
insofar as they support the lens she recommends choosing. The Thornhill article also fits within
this greater theme, as he asks how we should categorize the decision to rape, arguing ultimately
that it has a basis in evolutionary biology. Viewing rape discussions through this lens then,
according to Thornhill, would imply that we should discuss rape as sex, rather than something
else (such as issues of power or control). Again, like with Coombs and Balkin, the implication is
that it is the lens that we make our choices through that implicates what choices we will
ultimately make.

That is not to say that the two sets of readings are somehow entirely divorced. The
Thornhill and Coombs articles ultimately lead to specific policy implications that can easily be
placed within the textbook readings. As already discussed, Coombs seems to be arguing that
without a female point of view punishment can be unjust, perhaps placing her in the retributive
family. And the ultimate implication of Thornhill’s article seems to be that rape laws that don’t
take into account rape as sex will not be effective at coping with rape, perhaps placing him in the
utilitarian camp. The key point is the lense they use to arrive at these decisions however. They
don’t just ask will rape laws achieve a specific end, but how we should examine rape laws in the
first place. In this way, the differentiation between module two and the textbook readings still
holds true.

There are many articles we have read, however, that do not fit into this theme however.
For example, the Meares and Kahan piece seems to analyze how policing can be made more
effective, ultimately concluding that bottom up policing (“broken windows”) may be more
effective. This seems to take as given the choice to try and prevent more crime, mapping well
onto the utilitarian perspective. Though, one could argue, that because the actions of vagrants
would lead to more disorder under the Meares rubric, they might be more deserving of
punishment. Regardless of how you classify the piece, it doesn’t seem to map on well to our
earlier discussion, as it seems more about how we achieve a specific goal rather than how we
make a choice to achieve that goal. Thus, it would seem the Meares piece could be placed in the
textbook and no one would be the wiser. The pieces we read on moral poverty would seem to
also qualify considering they examine how crime can be more effectively prevented.

However, these pieces cannot be taken in isolation. After we read Meares we advanced to
the Ilusion of Order and the Foucault piece. Each of these is either explicitly or implicitly
critical of the approach taken by Meares as well as the other types of pieces referenced in the


Exam #2 Criminal Law, Professor Harcourt -7-

prior paragraph. Though Illusion and Order does tell us that the Meares’ empirical claims are
simply false, seeming to fall into the textbook rubric, it proceeds to examine why the choice to
condemn the disorderly would be made, in the same way Foucault questions why the criminal
system would move to a focus on rehabilitation. Thus, the Meares piece can be viewed as simply
setting the table for a module II analysis of why and how we make particular choices of criminal
punishment. The seeming outlier that is the Meares piece can now be reconciled with the general
theme.

The pieces by Becker and Levitt would also seem, facially at least, to be outliers to the
theme. Both pieces tell us how criminal enforcement can be made more efficient and would thus
seem to ignore how we make the initial choice of whether or not to punish and how to punish,
but instead map directly onto the utilitarian perspective outlined in the book. Admittedly, these
pieces are difficult to reconcile. However, the very fact that they make use of economic analysis
to analyze crime is another lens that we can view criminal policy through. Similar to Coombs
and whether or not we should adopt a female perspective, the economics papers ask whether we
should adopt a perspective that assumes criminals are rational actors. While this can be used to
further the theoretical positions outlined in the casebook, that doesn’t imply it still doesn’t
implicate the choice of the lens we use through which to view punishment.

In conclusion then, the textbook/theories of punishment readings seem to focus on a very
constrained choice between utilitarianism and retribution. The Beccaria piece is emblematic of
the utilitarian perspective, and Kant is emblematic of the retributive perspective. Though each of
these could provide a different lens through which to view punishment, the readings of these
section are constrained to only these two views and they never examine what would lead us to
adopt either view. In contrast, the module two papers offer us substantially greater choices of
how we should view punishment. For example, the biological perspective offered by Thornhill,
the feminist perspective offered by Coombs, and the economic perspective offered by Levitt. Not
only does Module II expand our choices, but it is also examines how and why we would make a
choice between these different views of punishment. The Harcourt and Foucault piece are
emblematic of this trend. Thus, the two modules actually compliment one another in expanding
our understanding not only of the options of punishment, but how we choose amongst those
options.

Question 3

Though the Jim Epstein talk and the Tony D’ Angelo, Jim Mutchnik speeches were
arguably my favorite parts of class (not that I didn’t love the professor, but I really enjoyed
getting outside perspectives of people practicing in the field), the final impression of the criminal
justice I was left after their speeches was not a favorable one. This was due to four factors. First,
the inability of the agents working on the case to reconcile their own perceptions of Mark
Whitacre and the objective facts given to us by The Informant. Second, that even though the
individuals working on the case seemed competent, the massive bureaucracy that stood in their
path undermined many of their efforts. Third, that the people the speakers thought were most
deserving of punishment received the least. And fourth, Jim Mutchnik’s decision to enter private
practice. Analyzing each of these in turn will illustrate why the ADM case as a whole
undermined my faith in the ability of the criminal justice system to actually provide for justice.

First, the faith that each speaker showed in Mark Whitacre’s genius undermined my
perception of their ability in the field. Every speaker we heard mentioned how smart Mark
Whitacre was and how well he presented himself. Mutchnik specifically told us how much


Exam #2 Criminal Law, Professor Harcourt -8-

smarter Whitacre was than agent Sheppard. Yet, the facts of the ADM case seem to indicate
otherwise. As but one example, Whitacre fell for the Nigerian money scam. Even well pulling in
a very large salary, Whitacre was willing to send off hundreds of thousands of dollars to an
unsolicited and unknown contact. I get these types of emails constantly, and even before I heard
they were officially they were scams, I was never gullible enough to send off any money.
Instances like this one undermine my faith in Whitacre’s genius and instead lead me to believe
he was a common swindler. Admittedly, the FBI agents did not know of these dealings until later
in the case. However, even now, D’ Angelo still professed to Whitacre’s intelligence. The
impression I took away was that the majority of the people working on the case were swindled
by a smooth talker. The fact the impression Whitacre has on these men today has not drastically
changed, doesn’t make me very confident in their ability to objectively analyze facts divorced
from the people they know in the future. Jim Epstein was the only one who seemed to express
doubt over Whitacre’s ability, and he was working as the defense counsel. The implication I took
from this was that the defense counsel seemed to be more intelligent and able to manipulate the
emotional connections of the agents working on the case.

The second aspect of the speeches that undermined my faith in the criminal justice
system was the massive bureaucracy that stood in the way of an effective investigation. Though
Jim Mutchnik came across as very intelligent and D’ Angelo came across as very dedicated to his
job, they both spoke of how the wall that was put up between the two investigations hurt the
investigation as a whole. The most striking moment was when D’ Angelo explained that because
of the mistakes that lead to Sheppard having to sit outside the trial, D’ Angelo and Sheppard still
have not talked to this day. The constant infighting and jockeying for position that The Informant
outlined occurred within the federal government was confirmed by the D’ Angelo/Mutchnik
presentation. This greatly undermined my faith in the government’s ability to carry out its duty
because it implied that even though I would have complete faith in Jim Mutchnik if he still
worked for the government (I would be hesitant to assign D’ Angelo to a case that involved a
large amount of personal interaction with the suspect for the reasons discussed supra), that
wouldn’t mean he could necessarily be effective in his job. The structure of the criminal
enforcement bureaucracy seems to undermine its effectiveness when compared to private
practice, further undermining my faith in the system.

The third aspect that undermined my faith in the system was that all three speakers said
they though Mark Whitacre was the least deserving of punishment, and yet at the time of the
speeches at least, he had incurred the most. Admittedly, the impression I got from the Epstein
talk and the book was that Mark contributed a lot to his own demise by firing Epstein as his
defense counsel and continuing to develop crazy theories of the conspiracy against him.
However, that wouldn’t seem to be enough of a reason to justify why Mick Andreas and Terry
Wilson got far less punishment than Mark Whitacre, at least based on what I read in The
Informant. While I read the book I was shocked to learn that such backroom deals went on to
essentially divide up the world (let’s just say law school has made me a lot less naive). These
dealings were controlled by Andreas and Wilson since Mark worked under them. These dealings,
along with the other price fixing schemes, had the potential to impact negatively millions of
farmers and farm workers around the world. And yet, the men most responsible received very
small punishments whereas the underling was thrown to the wolves, primarily because the
government had botched their handling of him. Though ADM did receive a large fine, I find it
hard to believe that the culture of these companies changes drastically when the people everyone
knows are responsible walk away with so little punishment. As such, my faith in the criminal


Exam #2 Criminal Law, Professor Harcourt -9-

justice system is understandably lower as a result of the outcome of the case and the speakers
firsthand impression of who deserved the most punishment.

The fourth factor that undermined my faith in the criminal justice system was Jim
Mutchnik’s decision to leave the public sector and go work for Kirkland & Ellis. To clarify, I do
not begrudge Mutchnik that decision. He explained to us that he has children that he wants to
provide a certain lifestyle for and that is a justifiable reason for his change of jobs. However, the
decision still undermines my faith in the criminal justice system for two reasons. First, the fact
that Mutchnik is now working for the defense side is worrisome because he has such vast
amounts of inside knowledge to exploit in defending his clients. Both Mutchnik and Epstein
struck me as very intelligent and now both work for the defendants. The government not only
botches investigations because of the vast amounts of bureaucracy involved, but they are going
up against defense counsel that appear to be more intelligent and know the inner workings of the
government system. Second, the prospect of working for the defendants was not enough to offset
the greater amount of pay Mutchnik would receive. Even though I don’t begrudge the decision, I
still can’t deny that his actions speak volumes about how rewarding work within the government
is. Mutchnik’s decision indicates that the benefits of working to prosecute criminals don’t
outweigh, at least for him, the pay the defense can offer. The impression I was left with was that
the government had made Mutchnik jaded because of how they had handled prior cases he had
worked on. This was illustrated by his impression that the ADM case had resulted in too little
punishment for the guiltiest men. In turn, because he was jaded the thought of working to convict
men he knew were guilty was less attractive, at least once the pay was factored in, than trying to
defend these same men. Any visions I had prior of working as a prosecutor suddenly seemed to
lose their luster once I heard of Mutchnik’s decision.

All of this was not to say that my ultimate impression of the class was that the criminal
justice system will always fail or that there is not any good I can do as an attorney. The 60
minutes piece we watched regarding an erroneous conviction was very uplifting about the good
you can do as an attorney. But, the moral I took from that piece was that the good one can do
comes from the defense side of the practice, not the prosecutorial side. The prosecutor in the case
profiled came across as an ignorant bigot, to put it lightly, and coupled with the impressions the
speakers gave, I suddenly find it understandable why 90% or so of my classmates will go into
private practice. In the ADM case the only man who could defend Mark Whitacre, the man who
both speakers working for the government was unjustly punished, was Jim Epstein, also in
private practice. Epstein also came across as the happiest of the group, as he is able to spend time
with his daughter (he brought her to the speech) and seemed to genuinely enjoy his work and the
diverse opportunities it gave him. Maybe I was swindled by Epstein, but based on all this it
should hardly be surprising that the final impression I was left with by the ADM speakers was
that I can still have an impact as a lawyer, it just won’t come from working for the state.
