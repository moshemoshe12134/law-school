I.

What a mess. Let’s start with the people on the ground, and then work our way up to the
owners and managers. (Various defenses and charges will be implied once initially made
and responded to in order to avoid needless repetition.)

Joe Braxton and Tracey Johnson (considered together):

1) Charge of causing or risking catastrophe.

Prosecution: It is alleged that one or both of them released the mace, which can be
considered “poison gas” or “other harmful or destructive force or substance,”
which could have caused widespread injury or damage. They did so knowingly,
insofar as it was their purpose to release the mace within the crowded club.
Barring that, they did so knowingly, because they did so knowing that the
resultant mayhem was substantially certain to arise. Barring that, they did so
recklessly, insofar as they disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the
material elements will result from their conduct.

Defense: This was done out of necessity, in response to a fight between patrons. The
harm to be avoided was imminent and serious, the harm they created was less
serious than alternative, they did so to avoid greater harm, no better alternative
existed. They also did so out of duress. They were responding to an immediate
threat from a human source, that is to say the damage that could have resulted
from the fight. They did so out of self-defense, as they were concerned that the
fight could have injured themselves or other patrons. The patrons who were
affected by the mace (but not the stampede), implicitly consented to the spraying
because mace-spraying is “not tremendously uncommon.” Lastly, there was a
lack of causality between the spraying of the mace and the melee.

Prosecution Rebuttal: Not necessity, because the spraying of the mace and the trampling
of 21 people was demonstrably not a lesser harm than people getting punched or
knocked over in the fight. There were also 28 guards in the club that night, and
it’s inconceivable that these two needed to resort to spraying chemicals in a
crowded space rather than just calling a few more folks over. Duress isn’t an
excuse, because there was a reasonable escape from the threat — cabining in the
fight through the use of more personnel. Self-defense is not an excuse because
there is no evidence that the guards or other people were in imminent harm from
the threat and there was a manifest lack of proportionality in the response. The
mere knowledge of pepper spray in the club does not create consent. The patrons
neither consented to the use of chemicals, nor is it a viable argument to say that
the customers should have known. The damage is also too serious for a consent
defense. The charge is causing catastrophe, and it’s absurd to assert that
customers would consent to that. Lastly, there is a manifest causation between
the spraying and the trampling.

2) Murder.

P: The guards didn’t act purposely, but they acted knowingly that the melee could ensue.
They also showed a reckless indifference to human life when their actions caused
the deaths.

D: Lack of mens rea — they didn’t know that the people would be killed because the use
of pepper spray is common, and they were acting out of the protection of people,



Student #3 — Harcourt, Crim Law — Page 2 of 10

which invalidates the notion of reckless disregard for human life. The necessity,
&c. defenses in charge | will likely be repeated, followed by the same responses
from the prosecutors.

PR: As they work in the industry, they must have known that people don’t sit around
blissfully inhaling after the discharge of mace, and knowledge can be assumed.
They may have been acting out of concern for the fighters and those around them,
but again, they work in the industry, and the fact that people will probably flee a
crowded club amounts to am extreme indifference to human life.

3) Criminal homicide.

P: They acted recklessly when they caused the deaths.

D: Mens rea problem — no evidence that they consciously disregarded the substantial and
unjustified risk.

PR: This can be presumed from the circumstances, using largely the same arguments
above (they work as security guards, people don’t like pepper spray, &c.).

4) Negligent homicide.

P: The guards should have recognized that their actions could have cause severe damage
to human life.

D: It’s not established that people would respond this way. There was no way to
anticipate the terrorism buzz, and it’s more reasonable and foreseeable that people
would just retreat to the bar or the bathroom when pepper spray gets used in the
inside of the club. The guards could have in no way foreseen the mass exodus
and the trampling.

PR: This was indeed foreseeable. Pepper spray in the air gets blown around, so the
patrons wouldn’t have just gone to a different part of the club. It’s reasonable and
expected that they would want to get the hell out, which is what they did and what
the guards should have been expecting them to do.

5) Reckless endangerment.

P: The guards recklessly engaged in conduct that put other people in danger of death or
serious bodily injury through the release of the mace in the crowded club.

D: Will probably make the arguments made above. Lack of foreseeability, necessity, no
mens rea, &c.

PR: Will probably employ the arguments they used against the defenses arguments
above.

Jane McMannon and Terri Jones (considered together):

1) Reckless endangerment.

P: They got into a fight in a crowded club, and this precipitated the use of the mace and
the tragic evacuation. They knowingly disregarded a palpable risk that other
people would be seriously injured by their conduct.

D: No mens rea to recklessly endanger — they were just hitting each other; they couldn’t
have possibly anticipated the release of the gas and hence didn’t have the reckless
mens rea. They were also acting out of necessity and self-defense in response to
the attacks by the others. Lastly, the release of the gas and the stampede was
definitely unforeseeable, and couldn’t have been anticipated. Fights in bars aren’t
uncommon, deadly stampedes are. The causality between the throwing of blows
and the trampling of the weak is too attenuated to be maintained.



Student #3 — Harcourt, Crim Law — Page 3 of 10

PR: The mens rea was indeed established. To fight in a crowded club is to invite security
guards, and if the two were frequent clubgoers then they might have witnessed the
use of pepper spray from previous outings. There was a substantial and justifiable
risk that they should have recognized, and they chose to ignore it. The necessity
and self-def arguments can’t be maintained, because if the foreseeability can be
established, it’s absurd to suggest that the release of pepper spray and a
bloodsoaked stampede is a proper and proportional response to fists coming at
face. The causality also can be maintained — the risk was within the harm and the
fight was a but-for cause of the tragedy. Had the two not exchanged blows, the
night would have in all likelihood ended peacefully.

2) Manslaughter

P: Repeat recklessness arguments from the endangerment charge, and apply it to the
taking of human life through their actions.

D: They didn’t act recklessly. They acted out of extreme duress. They couldn’t have
foreseen the accident.

PR: Prosecutors will repeat the recklessness argument, and add that duress is never a
defense to homicide. The accident was eminently foreseeable.

3) Negligent homicide.

P: They absolutely should have recognized that the actions they were taking could have
resulted in great damage to human life, and hence they acted negligently. The
damage caused may have been greater in scope than they intended, but it was still
of the same quality and nature and this can’t be forgiven.

D: Again no negligence because there was no way they could have known that the risk
was presented. The damage they intended wasn’t merely different in intensity, it
was qualitatively different. They just meant to punch one another, not to cause a
mass killing — it’s simply beyond nonsense to assert that these are merely
different degrees of the same harm.

PR: Harm to people nearby — however grave — is a result of the negligent disregard of the
risk they were posing by fighting. The fact that people were trampled instead of
merely being pushed over shows that we’re talking about different degrees of the
same thing.

4) Assault (both aggravated and simple)

P: They purposely caused bodily injury to one another (presumptively from the fact that it
took pepper spray to separate them), and if no harm was actually done, they
attempted by physical menace to put each other in fear of imminent serious bodily
injury. These offenses are aggravated because they did so under circumstances
manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life (fighting in a crowded
club is different than fighting in the soccer fields on the midway).

D: There’s no evidence that they caused bodily injury to one another, and they didn’t try
to use physical menace to cause fear of injury — they were merely having a
disagreement and the guards overreacted. The “extreme indifference to human
life” mentioned in MPC §211.1(2)(a) refers to indifference to the life of the
assaultee, not the people around them, and they did not demonstrate indifference
to each other’s lives.


Student #3 — Harcourt, Crim Law — Page 4 of 10

PR: Not so, they were involved in a heated physical altercation that required the use of
chemical agents. The textual argument made from the MPC is without basis —
where does it say that the life to which the A is indifferent needs to be the victim?

Kyles:

1) Murder.

P: The deaths were caused by his overt act — the maintenance of the club over capacity
and with the exits blocked — that manifested an extreme indifference to human
life. Kyles’ situation is basically that of Welansky.

D: Lack of knowledge — how was he to know that the club was over capacity and that the
exits were blocked? The requisite mens rea is absent here. Furthermore, his
actions didn’t cause the stampede. Talk to the guards — the offending guards were
supplied by Flores anyway. The codes also weren’t violated because they had an
agreement with the city officials.

PR: Sudden evacuation in a crowded building — especially one that is on notice for code
violations — is always a present danger and one that can’t be ignored. He was on
notice because of the note from the community group. He had a responsibility to
see that everything was fine in the club and he didn’t — hence the extreme
indifference to the possibility of death. Also, it was his omissions that
substantially contributed to the offence, so there’s no getting off on account of
that. Also, because this was the result of lack of compliance from a regulatory
scheme, the men rea might be irrelevant on account of strict liability. The fact
that they were Flores’ guards is irrelevant because K’s act prevented the exit no
matter who sprayed the mace. The agreement with the city can’t be maintained.
The fire commissioner was of the opinion that the club should have been closed
by court order, and it appears that he is the official who orchestrates the
investigations.

2) Manslaughter

P: The fact that he consciously ignored the risk that led to the deaths of the patrons
constitutes recklessness.

D: Lack of mens rea — no way to show that he consciously ignored.

PR: This can be presumed from the fact that he had a statutory duty to provide
architectural plans and to keep the exits safe and he didn’t.

3) Negligent homicide

P: Recycling a lot of the arguments found above — his actions were negligent because he
should have been aware of the substantial risk but instead did nothing.

D: There was no way he could have foreseen the stampede — it’s just too remote from the
fact that he didn’t follow a bureaucratic fiat and the fact that doors were blocked
that no one tried to use anyway.

PR: This doesn’t follow. The fact that the duty was imposed by statute shows that he was
definitely on notice that the layout of the building and the quality of the exits was
something taken seriously by the powers that be, and it was irrelevant that no one
tried to use the doors because they were inaccessible in violation of the code
anyway. Again, regulatory offense that lessens importance of mens rea.

4) Reckless endangerment.

P: Placed his customers in a situation where they were in danger of death or bodily
injury.


Student #3 — Harcourt, Crim Law — Page 5 of 10

D: Didn’t know — also, Envy Entertainment had rented out the club at the time, so he
can’t be held responsible.

PR: It’s his club, he’s responsible. Envy may have taken some of the responsibility, but
he still provided some of the security, &c., and it was his omission from a duty
imposed by statute that could have prevented the deaths. The fact that the people
all surged for one exit is irrelevant. Had they gone to the others, they would have
found them locked or blocked by laundry.

5) Felonious restraint

P: Through his failure to comply with the codes, he unlawfully restrained his patrons in
circumstances exposing them to risk of serious bodily injury.

D: This is a stretch of the text. There was an available exit, and people were free to come
and go as they wished. There is also no indication that the patrons were exposed
to serious bodily injury absent the highly unusual events that took place at the
club that night.

PR: There was one available exit, there is some indication that the guards were
preventing people from leaving, and it’s foreseeable that people would be trapped
inside the club. As stated above, the risk of serious bodily injury was present the
entire time.

6) Conspiracy.

P: It can be assumed that Kyles, Hollins, and Hollin III conspired to recklessly endanger
their patrons and hold them in a state of felonious restraint.

D: There’s just no evidence of this. The prosecution can’t show that they agreed to
commit these offenses, and there was no overt act on the part of Kyles.

PR: The agreement can be implied from the circumstances, as in Griffin. Clubs do not
run themselves, as multitudes of failed businesspeople can attest. The act of
continuing to run the club was both an overt act and the result of highly
coordinated behavior.

Hollins:

1) Conspiracy

P: Same charge as made against Kyles.

D: He was a silent partner and only provided the capital — he didn’t have anything to do
with the running of the club on a day-to-day basis. Also no evidence.

PR: Not relevant. He is still responsible for the compliance with building codes and can
be held responsible when thing go awry. There is ample evidence of conspiracy
to violate the statutes, which resulted in a situation of reckless endangerment and
felonious restraint.

2,3) Felonious restraint and reckless endangerment

The prosecution and the defense will make largely the same arguments in the conspiracy
charge, as well as the restraint and endangerment charges made against Kyles.

4) Complicity

P: He is an accomplice because he agreed to and aided the commission of the offenses
charged against Kyles. He also had a legal duty to prevent the commission of the
offense and did nothing.

D: Again, he was a silent partner, and there is also no evidence that he agreed to or aided
anything. His legal duty was delegated to the non-silent partners.


Student #3 — Harcourt, Crim Law — Page 6 of 10

PR: As a silent partner, he provided the $$ to run the club (aid) and he also couldn’t have
delegated the responsibility as he is the co-owner.

Hollins HI:

1,2,3) Restraint, endangerment, conspiracy

P: Same as charges made above.

D: He was under no responsibility to make sure the code was complied with, as he was
merely the manager of Le Mirage. He also lacks the requisite mens rea.

PR: The distribution of responsibility for following building codes is not the business of
the prosecution. As manager (and someone on the scene), he was if anything in a
better position to see that the codes were complied with, and he omitted to check
to make sure the emergency exits were unlocked and unencumbered.

4) Complicity

P: He is an accomplice because he agreed to and aided the commission of the offenses
charged against Kyles. He also had a legal duty to prevent the commission of the
offense and did nothing.

D: He wasn’t the owner, he was merely the manager. He had no legal duty and there’s no
evidence he agreed or aided.

PR: He did agree or aid because he was on the scene directing things. He also can’t
escape the legal duty that led to his omission because he was there and should
have made sure everything was fine.

Flores:

1,2,3) Felonious restraint, endangerment, complicity

P: He rented out the club for the night, so he was complicit in the felonious restraint and
the endangerment, also complicit in the acts of Kyles and the Hollinses..

D: He was in no way responsible for the situation created by the guards and by Kyles and
the Hollinses. As a patron of the club himself, he had no legal duty to make sure
the codes were complied with.

PR: He had no legal duty to check up on the codes, but he aided the other As by paying
for the space in a place that was in violation of code. He also provided his own
guards, which shows that he had a degree of control over the situation on the
ground.

Le Mirage, E2, Envy Entertainment:

1) Corporate liability for the above-listed offenses (it’s unclear if they were incorporated
— I’m assuming they are)

P: All the entities involved recklessly tolerated and encouraged criminal behavior by
corporate officials (Kyles, Flores, the Hollinses), who were acting within the
scope of their employment and in furtherance of company goals.

D: The defenses to criminal behavior above show that there was no criminal activity, and
clearly the violation of the codes and subsequent prosecution isn’t in furtherance
of company goals.

PR: It’s not a defense that the company was caught and held responsible — the
mainentance of the club for business was a company goal and those involved
were acting within the scope of their employment. If the above offenses are
proven, the corporations can be held liable.

There are a number of grounds on which an “acoustic separation” can be asserted,
but it will be helpful to first get a working definition of the term. | interpret acoustic
separation as dealing with the contours of sound — while the authors may all be
addressing the issue of crime and legal remedies, the texts differ dramatically in their
timbre and tone. The vibrations of sound also differ in their depth and breadth, and in the
way they echo possible solutions to the problems presented by the authors of the articles.

First of all, there is the issue of depth versus surface solutions. The first three
articles analyze crime from the perspective of the policymaker and enforcer, the latter
look deeper into social and conceptual reasons for crime and the messy foundation of the
law. For instance, Beccaria posits a straightforward calculus for the determination of
punishments. He declares that there must be a sense of proportion between crimes and
punishments, and that punishment must be carefully calculated to prevent actors from
choosing crime over lawfulness. Furthermore, Wilson gives us a highly formulaic
proposal that we just incapacitate those who are most likely to commit the most crime,
and a good deal of lawbreaking can be prevented by the incarceration of just a few
people. Lastly, Braithwaite tells us that we should be promoting more shame-centric
policies as to make criminal behavior less attractive. What these theories all share is their
proposal of simple, (somewhat) easily implementable surface solutions. It wouldn’t take
a great deal of effort to calculate punishments to deter or infuse the law with a little more
shame, or find the people who are really causing the harm and throw the little bastards in
jail. These are remedies that can be imposed by policymakers and don’t really implicate
much of society.

The latter three articles, on the other hand, seem to situate solutions in much
deeper conceptions of how people behave. Balking, while not really addressing the
criminal law, gives us a model of legal argument as choices between two dyads, which
amount to a political choice between individualism and communitarianism. What is
startling about his article is how easily these choices can be maintained within the
formalities of the law. The takeaway from this is that judges and lawyers may be
infusing the law with these arguments that make a choice between two fundamentally
divergent outlooks on human society. Balkin doesn’t give us a suggestion for preventing
crime — in fact, crime hardly comes up in the article at all. But he shows that the legal
framework within which policymakers must work is much more complex and ingrained
than the first three authors would have us believe. Thornhill takes it a step further.
Instead of rooting the analysis in political decisions, this author looks to human evolution
to explain the prevalence of rape. The article explains that rape is evolutionarily chosen
for by promoting forced and nonconsensual sex when both rapist and victim are at their
most fertile, and this helps to explain the rape epidemic faced by numerous societies.
Unlike Balkin, Thornhill does provide a solution — that both men and women should be
thoroughly educated about this. Men should be taught that they will feel the impulse to
rape and should be well informed of the consequences; women should be taught that they
are “designed” to be rape victims, and should know techniques for resistance. Coombs
also addresses the role of women, and roots her analysis in the fact that the law doesn’t
incorporate the norms of women to the extent it should, especially considering the fact
that there are massive disparities in the level of offending between men and women. She
proposes that the male-centered approach to criminology should be supplanted by one


Student #3 — Harcourt, Crim Law — Page 8 of 10

that pays more attention to women’s norms, roles in sentencing, and place in the criminal
justice system.

The chasm between the first three articles and the latter three could not be wider.
While Beccaria, Wilson, and Braithwaite propose relatively simplistic policies to address
their concerns, Balkin, Thornhill, and Coombs show that the issues about which they’re
concerned might be much more deeply rooted. Their solutions (Balkin’s can perhaps be
presumed) involves less the construction of a facile policy and more a push toward re-
excavating the moral, political, and social topography of human society. Thornhill, for
example, proposes a solution that can scarcely be categorized as one, and that analysis
makes a stark acknowledgement that the solutions may not prevent crime, but can only
serve as a sort of tourniquet for larger (in this case, evolutionary) differences.

This leads to another major difference in the tenor of the articles — their focus or
lack of focus on difference and deeply rooted social conflict. Beccaria gives scant
attention to the differences between people and how they might act out of an insanely
complex web of motivations instead of fear of punishment and interest calculation. His
hypothetical offender will look at how much she gets from crime, and how much she
might have to pay, and then make her decision. Braithwaite, too, fails to adequately
address this. He notes a large difference between communities that shame and those that
do it less, but he declines (at least in our brief excerpt) to analyze why, what, and how
cultures shame. Wilson does get into differences, but only to the extent that he points out
that some people commit a lot of crime and some people do not. The explanatory heft of
this assertion is, to say the least, lacking. All these theorists also address social conflict
to some extent, but don’t go much deeper than the conflict between people who commit
crime and those who don’t much care for crime, thank you all the same (or may be
victims). This one-dimensional view of human relations doesn’t exactly pull one in,
hence the simple solutions.

The other three theorists do adequately address difference and social conflict.
These theories all have their serious flaws, but they can’t be faulted for not looking
beyond the veneer of crime. Balkin situates conflict in a political manner. Some people
prefer policies that promote individualist values; some prefer communalist values. The
Rutgers Law Review isn’t exactly known for its fiery rhetoric, but political battles
between those who think the individual is the basic unit of society and those who think
the individual is a nexus of social relations and identifications with larger groups is a
major source of conflict in our society and many others. Similarly, Thornhill situates
conflict in gender and sexual relations, and the result is not uplifting. That article argues
that men are hard-wired to rape, and women are carefully contoured to be rape victims —
a starker example of social conflict can scarcely be imagined. This conflict cannot be
undone, either, as it’s not as if one can simply cast off all the evolutionary baggage that
causes a human being to be what he or she is. Lastly, Coombs touches on difference and
vested conflict, also in the sphere of gender relations. She realizes that the law can be
“gendered” — that it can implicitly have the outlook of a particular gender and not the
other. This difference implies conflict — presumably men will want to instantiate their
norms in the law, and Coombs’ article can be considered a kind of fixed-bayonet charge
for women trying to infuse the law with their own concerns, norms, and explanations.
These articles, unlike the first three, recognize sources of social conflict that are
precedent to policymaking and criminal law.


Student #3 — Harcourt, Crim Law — Page 9 of 10

This all isn’t to say that the latter three are intrinsically deeper than the former.
There’s really something to be said for easily implementable policies and also that the
sources of conflict described by Balkin, Coombs, and especially Thornhill might be
seriously misguided. However, the acoustic separation between the articles can be
attributed to the depth of their analysis and solutions, and their acknowledgment or lack
thereof of social difference, political conflict, the causes of crime, and ultimately what is
wrong with the way the law is implemented, practiced and argued.

I had a mixed reaction to the speakers. It’s difficult to abstract two presentations
to the criminal justice system as a whole, but the selection of speakers — one former US
Atty, on FBI agent, and one defense attorney — may serve as a sort of microcosmic
representation of the legal players in the Informant and in the criminal justice system as a
whole.

Unfortunately, I can’t say much about D’Angelo. He seemed like a pleasant
fellow, but he took a bit of a backseat to Mutchnik when the two came to speak to us, so
my insights into the role of the FBI will be more limited than the other two presenters. I
was pleased to see his evident professionalism (there was clearly something going on
with the Swiss prosecutor, but his lips were sealed), and his willingness to take his job
seriously. The relationship between the FBI and the US Atty’s office is a complex one,
so I was a bit surprised to see that he and Mutchnik were so chummy with one another
(the faux “Bill and Ted” overhead that we didn’t really get to see spoke volumes).
Investigators and prosecutors are on the same side, but their interests can vary
dramatically, and their perceptions of various events may carry drastically different
meaning. The Informant contains a scene where the FBI investigators have painstakingly
prepped Whitacre (no small task) and gathered the lamp-camera tape from the first
meeting. Robin Mann is unimpressed, and the FBI agents are disappointed. The same
thing happens after the Japan meeting where the FBI feel that they have conclusive
evidence of illegality, but the prosecutors again don’t feel that it’s enough. I don’t know
how penetrating these insights are into the criminal justice system, but they seem to
highlight the different worlds of info-gatherers and attorneys. D’Angelo’s view of Brian
Shepard also surprised me somewhat, as he and Mutchnik didn’t seem to have a
tremendous amount of sympathy for him, despite his evident difficulties. This may
illustrate that whatever their differences, the FBI and the US Attys have a symbiotic
relationship, and any figure that can be perceived as not being up to the job might be a
liability. From what little I know, I would trust D’ Angelo and allow him to pursue the
ADM case as well as others similar to it. He seems like an asset to the FBI.

Mutchnik said a number of things in class that troubled me, specifically with
reference to the role of the government in antitrust prosecutions. First of all, he fully
acknowledged that antitrust penalties may have little to no effect on price-fixing
corporations. He clearly realizes that efficient price fixers can purchase their penalties
and as long as those are less than the profit they are making from playing the market like
a puppet master, the show can go on. If we’ve learned one thing from this class, it’s that
law is a complicated phenomenon with a great deal of political and social content, and to
see someone who knows that his job is ultimately irrelevant but doesn’t do much about it
didn’t quite sit well. Of course, he’s not a policy maker and he can’t single-handedly


Student #3 — Harcourt, Crim Law — Page 10 of 10

rewrite the antitrust laws, but he was a bit too comfortable with his situation. Secondly,
he mentioned that he supports antitrust prosecutions because “they keep him in a job.” I
see a larger problem here, that in which lawyers are just a species of professional
mercenary, and that doesn’t sit well with me. Lawyers don’t have to commit themselves
personally to anything, and I suppose it was jarring to see someone who has spent
tremendous quantities of time and effort working in antitrust not to have strong
convictions about the rightness of his cause. Of course, this could all be first-year law
student naiveté, but the fact that Mutchnik moved from the antitrust dept in the US atty’s
office to a private practice that included antitrust created the impression that he was
merely a wing-tipped warrior without a lot of stake in what he does. It’s true that he
could have had a road-to-Damascus style revelation when working for the prosecution
and realized that companies need defense, too, but I didn’t get that from the short
presentation. I wouldn’t want Mutchnik to work as an antitrust prosecutor. I wouldn’t
have demoted him, but his time could be better spent working in other areas. I suppose
that seeing him in action served to undermine my confidence in the criminal justice
system to a considerable extent.

Jim Epstein was fantastic. He’s without question a committed, thoughtful,
intelligent, and fierce advocate. In contrast to Mutchnik, he looked beyond the borders of
his job to the broader picture, and he wasn’t shy about sharing it with us. First of all, his
concern for Whitacre clearly goes beyond the attorney/client relationship — though the
two clearly have a complicated one. He dealt with Whitacre when it was difficult for
anyone to do so, and he made sure that Whitacre got in to see Dr. Miller after his suicide
attempt. Epstein discussed (somewhat) the lies Whitacre told, and the fact that he told
him that he would quit the case if Whitacre spoke with the media. His comment that he
felt sorry for Whitacre seemed to infuse a bit of humanity into a notoriously difficult job.
Furthermore, Epstein was clearly thinking about the motivations of all the players, and
not merely himself. He mentioned in class that he thought the fraud division was staffed
by “zealots” who simply wanted to impose the maximum sentence, and that he thought
skimming off the top was a widespread ADM practice, not limited to Whitacre. He also
candidly discussed his distaste for the federal sentencing guidelines, and the disparities
they cause (e.g. between Whitacre and the other ADM officials), despite his professional
status. His candor, honesty, nuance, and concern for his difficult client bolstered my
confidence in the criminal justice system. I would have promoted Epstein, and,
especially after hearing him speak to us, I felt even more that Whitacre made an
enormous tactical blunder by replacing Epstein as his lawyer. Of course, we only saw
three out of a long cast of characters, but I felt that he was one of the more honorable
figures in the ADM debacle.

The three presentations were interesting, but each left me feeling differently about
the criminal justice system. I didn’t get much from D’ Angelo, Mutchnik didn’t exactly
inspire my confidence in attorneys, and Epstein was a much better model of what a
zealous attorney should be. Again, I’m not quite sure how representative these three
individuals are of the criminal justice system as a whole, but it demonstrates the variety
of motivations and goals harbored by those who stand behind our system of justice.
