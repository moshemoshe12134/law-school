1.

Dwain Kyles

Charges: This case is very similar to Commonwealth v. Welansky. As the principal club owner,
Kyles may be responsible for the deaths of the patrons who died in the stampede. I would bring
a manslaughter charge against him for committing reckless homicide by failing to fulfill a
number of legal duties: failing to provide enough staircases leading outside, failing to
conveniently locate exits, and failing to obey the court order to close operations after his club
was found dangerous. The MPC allows for omissions to lead to liability (2.01(3)(b)), so long as
they are imposed by law (e.g., tort duties). These actions were a but for cause of the patrons’
deaths, because it was the fact that the exits were not conveniently located and the club was
overcrowded that the stampede was caused. Kyles certainly had the requisite mens rea
(recklessness) because he consciously disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk. He knew
of the court order and deliberately chose to risk his patrons’ safety by keeping the club open,
even despite the fact that crowd control was also a problem (the facts tell us that crowd control
had been a problem at the club before) and knew this combination could be catastrophic (he had
received the letter from Bringing About Reform, in which the community voiced its concerns).
Defenses: Kyles did not have the requisite mens rea to be convicted of manslaughter. This was
a tragic accident that he could in no way have predicted or prevented. Kyles did not fail to fulfill
a legal duty by keeping the club open. He had made a deal with the city which stipulated that the
club could remain open, and he had no reason to doubt it. If the city reneged on its deal, Kyles
was not aware of it, nor should he have been. Furthermore, because the city agreed to keep the
club open, Kyles did not nor should he have known about the danger his club presented. Lastly,
there was no but for causation of the faulty design of the exits. The fire commissioner said that
people generally exit out of the door from which they entered, as was the case here. Even though
the other exits were blocked, this was not the cause of the patrons’ deaths—they would have
gone out that exit anyway and the same tragedy would have occurred.

Response: There was but for causation here. The reason for the court order to close may have
been because the exits were not conveniently located and there were not enough signs indicating
the way out, in which case, the layout would be a but for cause, even despite the fact that the
patrons had used the entrance to exit. If the exits were more conveniently located, patrons
probably would have used them and the stampede would have been prevented. The facts tell us
that the club failed to submit architectural plans and engineering reports, which may have
indicated that the Kyles knew that they would be rejected. Even if the city did make a deal with
Kyles to keep the club open (which there is no evidence of, and in fact, there is evidence to the
contrary), the club had 11 alleged building code violations and the fact remains that the club was
aware of the possible danger they presented for overcrowding. The fact that the city may have
been negligent in striking the deal does not relieve Kyles of his duty to ensure his club is safe,
and he is nevertheless reckless for failing to heed to that risk for financial profit.

Calvin Hollins, Jr.

Charges: I would bring a charge of negligent homicide under MPC 210.4 against Hollins. He is
less culpable than his partner, who had made trips to the club and knew of its potential dangers,
but still bears some culpability because he failed to investigate a business which his money was
helping to sustain. Negligent homicide merely requires that a defendant have committed
homicide negligently: he need not have knowledge of the risk, but it requires that he should have


Criminal Law Exam Professor Harcourt
Exam #1 Spring 2006

known of the risk. Calvin omitted a legal duty to ensure the club he was funding was a safe
place for patrons to attend.

Defenses:

My client lacks the requisite mens rea to be charged with this crime. A reasonable person in
Hollins’ position would not have investigated the club’s safety. He had every reason to believe
that the safety was being overlooked by his partner, who made frequent trips to the club and by
the operator. Kyles had made several trips to the club in the last month. There is no evidence
that Hollins was ever even at the club, that he knew of the clubs’ safety violations. He was just
an investor!

Response: This comes down to what the jury believes a reasonable investor would do. Hollins
(presumably) was 50% of the reason this club was operating. If you are helping to sustain a
business, you should inquire as to what you are helping to sustain and whether it is detrimental to
the public. Furthermore, this argument is a slippery slope. If every investor decided not to check
up on his business, no one would, and that would be a dangerous thing.

Joe Braxton and Tracy Johnson

Charges: I would bring a negligent homicide charge against Joe and Tracy. The facts do not
indicate they knew of the risk their use of pepper spray and mace imposed, but a reasonable
person would not have used such an acrid substance in a confined space with over a thousand
patrons packed in.

Defenses: My clients lacked the mens rea necessary for this crime. A reasonable person would
have done exactly the same thing. The facts tell us it is not uncommon for security guards to use
this substance to break up fights inside of a club. Furthermore, the prosecution cannot prove the
pepper spray came from Joe and Tracy. Some witnesses say it may have come from them, but
this us an unsure testimony and unreliable, given the panic of the situation and the crowded
space. Also, the shouts of a terrorist attack may have triggered the stampede, not the pepper
spray (this sounds much more likely). IN addition, my clients plead an affirmative defense of
use of force for the protection of others. The use of the pepper spray was what Joe and Tracy
believed was necessary for the immediate protection from bodily harm of the other patrons not
engaged in the fight. Nor were they negligent in believing this under MPC 3.09: no reasonable
person could have predicted the patrons’ reaction to the spray, given that it has been used in
clubs before and that in a crowded club, people using physical violence is much more threatening
to safety, especially if it escalates.

Response: Tracy and Joe’s use of pepper spray was not reasonable, not even given the fact that
the physical violence was encroaching on patrons’ safety. There were much more reasonable
reactions to the fight, for example, escorting the two women out of the club. Use of pepper spray
put a greater number of people at risk, and is probably only used when multiple patrons engage
in violent behavior. The fact that this defense of others was negligent will not excuse Tracy and
Joe from their charges of negligent homicide (3.09 says defendants are still to be held
responsible for negligent crimes if their belief that their act was necessary was negligently held).
Calvin Hollins II

Charges: Manslaughter. Similarly to Kyles, Hollins knew of the risk the building design posed
and decided to run the risk anyway, recklessly endangering lives of patrons, for a profit. The
facts tell us that he told Flores of Envy Entertainment that the space had a maximum capacity of
500 even though the club had a maximum capacity of 250. It was because of overcrowding that
the stampede proved to be so deadly.


Criminal Law Exam Professor Harcourt
Exam #1 Spring 2006

Defenses: The facts do not tell us that my client knew the true capacity of the club, nor that he
intentionally wrote in the contract that it had a capacity of 500. This may have been a mistake,
and thus, he did not have the requisite mens rea for the crime, it was negligence at most.
Furthermore, we do not know if the stampede would have occurred if there were only 500 people
in the club. Flores let in twice that number of people, and thus there is no way to show that
Hollins III’s error was a but for cause of the harm. Lastly, there were so many intervening
causes of the stampede (the mace/pepper spray, the terrorist attack shouting), that the harm was
not proximately caused either.

Response: These intervening causes and the possible harm that could result when they combined
with overcrowding should have been foreseen, especially given the faulty design of the club.
Hollins should have known the max capacity of the club given he was the operator, and the fact
that he did not check that his contract conveyed correct safety information shows that he was
reckless. Willful blindness is just as bad as actually knowing of the risk that your conduct poses
(US v. Jewell).

Marco Flores

Charges: Flores should be charged with negligent homicide, because he allowed too many
people (1000) to enter the club, five times the amount permitted, twice the amount he was told
was permitted. Though we do not know if he actually knew of how many people the security
guards let in, he should have been keeping an eye on this. He may have even told the bouncers
that it was permissible to let in that many people. If he hadn’t let so many people in, the
stampede would not have occurred.

Defenses: Flores was not in charge of letting people in. There is no evidence that he
misinformed the security guards, and he had every reason to believe they would listen to his
orders.

Response: As promoter, and in charge of most of the security guards on the premises, he should
have made sure there were not too many people in the club.

Le Mirage, E2, Envy Entertainment

Charges: corporate homicide (manslaughter, manslaughter, negligent homicide, respecitvely) for
each of them. In all these cases, the agent (Hollins, Kyles, and Flores respectively), was acting
within the course and scope of his employment, and was acting in furtherance of the
corporation’s business interests. Given that the agents were the mangagement of each of the
corporations, it was certainly ratified by a high managerial agent under 2.07.

Defenses: Statute does not provide for suitable punishment for corporations (fines), and this
shows a lack of legislative intent to impose homicide charges on corporations.

Response: This did not matter in Commonwealth v. McIlwain School Bus Lines.

Jane McMannon and Terri Jones

Charges: Manslaughter. Jane and Terri should knew of the risk their behavior posed for the
safety of the other patrons and decided to engage in the fight anyway. It is because of this fight
that the whole incident started.

Defense: The harm was not within the scope of the risk, and there were too many intervening
causes. The conceivable risk of their conduct is that someone would get physically punished or
injured, not that it would trigger a stampede caused by terrorist threats or mace, pepper spray.
Thus, MPC 2.03 is not satisfied.

Response: There was a conceivable risk that people could get hurt trying to get away from the
fight. The injury here was the same kind of probably injury, and is not too accidental in its


Criminal Law Exam Professor Harcourt

occurrence, given that Jane and Terri saw how crowded the club was before they decided to
engage in their fight.

2.

There is a definite separation between the two sets of theory readings we did these past
two quarters. The last part of our course (Chapter | of Kaplan) discussed how and why we
should punish, and the Module II readings discussed why crime is committed. However, they
come together in that the Module II readings inform our studies of how and why we punish, and
vice versa.

For example, Braithwaite suggests that we should punish in order to express reintrigrative
shaming of the criminal, to express disapproval of the crime without rejection of the criminal.
This, he says, leads to conscience building, and a greater likelihood of abstaining from criminal
behavior and promotion of positive behaviors that will lead to the criminal becoming a
functioning member of his community. Though this is a theory that is centered on how we
should punish, it also informs us of a theory of why crime is committed: criminals are created
when people are cut off from their communities and thus lose two important impositions of
morality: a showing of what is right and wrong as expressed externally by the community, and
the ability to self-impose morality through ones conscience and thus attraction to criminal
subcultures. This piece would thus be a good compliment for the moral poverty theories, which
similarly stipulate that crime is committed because of a dearth of positive moral influences on a
child’s life. Similarly, the moral poverty theories would inform Braithwaite’s work. For
example, moral poverty theories could be combined with Braithewaite’s policy suggestions to
stipulate that community shaming of morally reprehensible acts should come at an early age,
even before a criminal act is committed.

Similarly, Beccaria tells us that we should punish in order to deter people from
committing crimes, but only so much punishment that the are proportional to the injury caused
by the crime to society (classical utilitarianism with a bit of proportionality thrown into the mix).
Becarria rejected the idea that punishment should be in retribution for the wrong, and the
malefactor’s intentions, but said that its purpose was to sufficiently deter people from
committing injury to others. Beccaria says, “if an equal punishment be ordained for two crimes
that injure society in different degrees, there is nothing to deter men from committing the greater
as often as it is attended with greater advantage.” This is the marginal deterrence that we saw in
our economic analysis of crime readings from Module II. Beccaria’s theory of why we punish
(to deter crime) was the bud of economic analyses of the law we read by authors such as Levitt
and Becker. Economic analysis started from the deterrence approach of punishment taken by
Becarria and others such as Bentham, and proposed why people commit crimes (for they could
not be deterred until we figured out what motivated them). They commit crimes, because the
benefits of the crime exceed the costs of the crime (the severity and likelihood of punishment).
In turn, these discoveries about why people commit crimes also contributes to the how we should
punish (Becarria’s turf): increase the likelihood and severity of punishment in a way that will
least harm the rest of society (e.g., Becker’s suggestion that fines be used whenever possible
because, if high enough, they deter the criminal from committing a crime again, and pose the
least costs on society —in fact, they benefit society).

James Q. Wilson suggests that we punish by selectively incapacitating the criminals who
are most likely to “do it again.” He said that incapacitation is a desirable theory because it does
not require us to make assumptions about human nature, like the other theories such as


Criminal Law Exam Professor Harcourt
Exam #1 Spring 2006

deterrence and rehabilitation, and because our goal should not be merely to punish, but to
prevent crimes from occurring again. We do this not by showing the individual the wrong of his
ways, or showing him that his ways impose too high a cost on him, but by locking him up. This
theory of how we should and why we should punish in turn informs theorists of why crime is
committed. To me, incapacitation is most naturally associated with the biological theories of
crime, which tell us that people commit crime because it is programmed into us. Under this
theory in its pure form, people cannot be changed by any external factors, such as imposing costs
or moral teaching, and thus the only way to punish them is to segregate them from the rest of
society. In particular, those who have presented certain risk factors for likelihood to be a repeat
offender should be locked up (selective incapacitation). Thus, studies of incapacitation and
biological theories of crime inform each other and compliment the policy suggestions made by
each. Note that I do not include Randall Thornhill’s approach to why rape is committed in this
“pure” biological theory group (I think this is a misconception of his theory). To me, his theory
is a mixed nature/nurture theory, which is also informed by a theory of deterrence. He says all
men have genes which can lead to raping behavior (nature), but ONLY if they are combined with
the correct environmental stimuli (e.g., no male parental figure, limited resources) (nurture).
Thus, the solution is not necessarily to incapacitate, but to change the environmental stimuli that
these boys are exposed to, and to increase the costs of rape (because under his theory, people still
have free will—they are not programmed by their genes to act only in one way). Thus, his
theory is informed not only by incapacitation theorists, but by deterrence theorists such as
Becarria and Bentham.

I think that there is a further separation between these two sets of readings (Kaplan
chapter 1: how and why we punish, and module II readings discussing why crime is committed)
and a third set of readings, those Module II readings we did that tell us what all these theories
and how we conceive of crime and punishment tell us about ourselves. I think this is set of
readings includes both Balkin and Coombs. Balkin maintains that all legal theories are just
rhetoric we use to mask our ideology, which is the thing that is really driving our policy
suggestions. Thus, when we make arguments for deterrence as the rationale for punishment, or
for a corresponding economic model of crime, these rationales and models are merely window
dressing for what we truly believe about crime and are fluff for the heart of the matter: our policy
suggestions. Balkin’s theory of what these theories tell us about ourselves inform our theories.
Although it isn’t quite clear what he is he is advocating (e.g, leaving all our arguments behind
and just being transparent about our ideology, or just simply being aware of the fact that our
ideology is driving our theories and rationales), it certainly helps us to better understand our
arguments and advocate them more responsibly. I view Coombs and the feminist theorists as
also being in this group, which tell us that our theories and how we conceive of crime tell us
about ourselves and further illuminate the way in which we rationalize crime and punishment.
Coombs shows us how our gender stereotypes are implicated in our theorizing about crime and
punishment. She advocates for recognizing this stereotype, and to combat it, use a woman-
normed approach to sentencing and conceiving of crime. She also advocates for a more
comprehensive articulation of sentencing decisions to ensure that gender role stereotypes are not
affecting how judges conceive of the correct punishment. A feminist approach informs our
theorizing of why crime is committed by ensuring that our theory takes into account the
discrepancy between male and female crime rates.

Thus, I would propose more of a three tiered separation, each of which bidirectionally
inform the other levels of separation. Theories about how and why we punish both inform and


Criminal Law Exam Professor Harcourt
Exam #1 Spring 2006

are informed by theories of why crime is committed, which in turn both inform and are informed
by theories of why we believe those reasons for crime and rationales for punishment.

For me, these tiers of analysis of crime and punishment always seemed to provoke a
fourth tier of the analysis (which we have not yet read a piece about): how our conceptions of
criminal behavior and punishment affect criminal behavior itself. For instance, many of our
readings view people as problems to be managed, rather than resources to be developed for the
sustenance of the community (e.g., economic theory view of people as bound to be criminals if
benefits of crime exceed the costs, biological theory view of people as bound to be criminals by
virtue of their DNA unless an intervention is staged, moral poverty theories, which view
adolescents, especially adolescents with few moral inputs like religion, as “superpredators”). We
can imagine this sort of theoretical outlook, as well as the policy suggestions that go along with
it, as creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. Perhaps if people are expected to be bad, and are told
that they will be bad unless deterred from their path of criminality, especially those from a
certain contingency of the populations (e.g., people in poverty), they will be bad, because the
possibilities for positive behavior are restricted. It would be interesting to read a piece which
tells us about whether our theories and the nature of the policies we propose (i.e., whether they
are aimed at discouraging people from crime or whether they are aimed at promoting people to
success) actually impact criminal behavior. If this is so, perhaps we should reorganize our
theories and policy suggestions to emphasize the potential of human beings to be contributing
members of society, and ways to promote this potential, rather than ways to repress the
criminality of humans.

I never considered being a criminal defense attorney (I came to law school hoping to
have a career in health law), but Jim Epstein certainly inspired me to think about the field. His
experience attempting to defend Mark Whitacre was definitely one marred with frustration and
empathy for Mark’s psychological problems. However, it was also one which proved that a
good attorney can make a huge difference in the punishment his client receives. The fact that
Epstein was so close to getting him a good plea (only three years!) is certainly testament to the
power of good legal argument to evoke the sympathies and rational basis of the Justice
Department. Had Whitacre not fouled up his own chances, Epstein’s argument probably would
have prevailed and his client would be serving a third of the sentence he is actually serving.
There is much power and responsibility that goes along with being a criminal defense attorney.
It is not just people’s money and possessions you are protecting, but also their freedom and lives.
While this power and responsibility is challenging, important, and exciting, it is also a bit
frightening and threatens to impact the lawyer’s non-professional life. Jim did confirm that he
struggled with trying to separate his personal life and his defense of Whitacre (it seemed to have
been quite an emotional experience for him). I cannot imagine being able to undertake other
activities knowing that what I do at work would so certainly impact the life of another person,
and could possibly be the difference between their life and death.

In law school, we learn about legal argument and policy. I don’t know much about the
second and third year legal curriculum, but I don’t think we take a course about how to interact
with a client (aside from ethics). However, in Jim Epstein’s case, ability to communicate with
and understand his client was the key to the case (perhaps my undergrad degree in psychology
actually be useful for my career!). Though Epstein’s predicament was a unique one (I don’t
think there are many defendants who are quite so troublesome and self-destructive as Whitacre),


Criminal Law Exam Professor Harcourt
Exam #1 Spring 2006

it shows that there are many, many facets to being a good lawyer and to best representing the
interests of another person.

In my opinion, Epstein did all he could to help Whitacre. He recognized that he had done
wrong, but also recognized the injustice of a long punishment, after all the assistance Whitacre
had provided the government. Mutchnik and D’ Angelo seemed also to have recognized the
unique situation Whitacre was in, and tried to balance the interests of the government in
punishing criminal activity, trying not to discourage whistleblowing, and being sensitive to the
psychological pitfalls and precarious position of their informant. However, Whitacre’s lies,
crimes, and self-destructive behavior overpowered their effectiveness, and justice was not
ultimately served: Whitacre got more time than the ADM officials combined. I believe our
guest speakers did all they could to prevent this outcome (Epstein only stopped his assistance
because he was fired!), but Whitacre was his own worst enemy: justice was not served because
he would not allow it to be served. It is easy to conceive of justice as being fixed: you do a
certain crime, you pay a certain price, mitigating or aggravating factors taken into account. But
this course shows that justice is a dynamic entity: it changes depending on lawyers’ presentation
of a case, by the sympathies and reason of the court receiving the presentation, and by the actions
of the defendant himself. While it may seem unfair, and perhaps it is, it is also a strong call for
people like myself to become Jim Epsteins— because such a huge impact can be made on the
lives of the people we represent, and is a determining factor in whether justice is served.
