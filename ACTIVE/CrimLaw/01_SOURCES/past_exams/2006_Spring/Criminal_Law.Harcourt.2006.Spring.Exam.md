This examination consists of 8 pages total (including the cover sheets). You may refer
to any materials you like, but you may not talk to or confer with anyone else. You may not
speak or consujt in any way with any other person during the exam. If you quote or
paraphrase from an article, book or other person’s work or ideas, you must give a reference
(e.g., Kaplan 568 or Levitt 239).

There are three questions and you must respond to all three questions. The
examination will be graded 1/3 on each question, so I would recommend spending equal time
on each question.

You may answer the questions in any order that suits you. Please begin the answers to
each question on a new page, noting clearly the question that you are responding to. Each
exam answer page should include a header containing your student exam number, the name of
the examination, and the pagination, specifying the last page (e.g. “Page 3 of __”). Please
double space your answers with one-inch margins and use a 12 point New Times Roman font.

Your answers should be specifically tailored to my questions. You should not cut and
paste any materials from your notes. In fact, if you feel tempted to cut and paste materials
from your notes, you should immediately think to yourself that the materials are not
sufficiently tailored to the question that Iam asking. I am not interested in unnecessary or
irrelevant background information.

Please work on your organization, structure, argumentation and presentation. I have
tried to provide you with a possible structure for your responses. Please either use that

proposed structure or a better one.

Good luck on the exam and have a great summer when you're done with exams.

Question #1:

The following account has been prepared for you by the lead investigator in your office,
drawing on news accounts, interviews, and 2,000 pages of documents. The file includes news
clippings, 911 transcripts, interviews and reports. You rummage through the file and notice the
following:

On Monday, February 17, 2003, at approximately 3:00 a.m., 21 people were killed ina
stampede in a Chicago nightclub, the E2 Club. Hundreds of people who were packed into the E2
club on the city’s South Side rushed down a stairwell after bouncers broke up a fight and
someone sprayed Mace or pepper spray.

A witness at the club suggested someone might have shouted a warning about a terrorist
attack. Many witnesses have stated that the use of Mace or pepper spray by security guards was
the event that set this all off. According to informants who go to clubs frequently, it is not
tremendously uncommon for pepper spray to be used inside of a club. According to witnesses,
some people who didn't see the incident that triggered the use of Mace apparently thought there
was some sort of terrorist attack. Some of them shouted “poison gas.” Someone made the
reference “I'll bet it's bin Laden.” This may have made the panic worse. When some patrons
began to vomit or pass out—apparently from chemical fumes—the crowd scrambled to get down
the club's single open staircase leading outside. In the panic, the clubbers were squashed in the
stairway and flattened against the doors. Twenty-one people died and 57 were injured.

Police superintendent Terry Hillard said investigators were trying to sort out conflicting
stories about the source of the Mace or pepper spray. Witnesses said the spray may have come
from two security guards (Joe Braxton and Tracey Johnson) trying to break up a fight between
two women (Jane McMannon and Terri Jones).

The club was located on the second floor of a building, over a restaurant called Epitome
on the first floor. According to police superintendent Terry Hillard, the club had been ordered to
close its operations in July after investigators found 11 alleged building code violations, ranging
from failure to submit architectural plans and engineering reports, to failure to provide enough
exits. But a lawyer for the operator of the club, Le Mirage AJI-Night Studio, said a deal was
reached in October under which the club would remain open. Another hearing was scheduled for
next month, he said. “The city is 100 per cent aware of it and in fact, Le Mirage had asked the
city consistently and repeatedly to assist with crowd control,” the lawyer for Le Mirage told an
investigator.

There exist tapes of dozens of 911 calls made from the E2 nightclub on the night of the
stampede. “I'm calling the police from E2 nightclub. There's a fight going on. There's a lot of
people. They're spraying mace and there's too many people to get out,” one caller tells the 911
operator.

“People in there are falling out due to pepper spray being sprayed in here. People are
having seizures and we need some help,” says another caller.

“Ok, ma'am. Firemen are outside. Can you go outside and talk to them?” asks the
operator in response.

“They won't let anybody out the door,” the caller said.

“They won't let you out the door?” repeats the operator.

“There's about a thousand people in here choking and falling out,” said the caller.
“Ma'am, we're there already.”

“Ok,” replied the caller. Someone choking is overheard in the background.

At the time the calls started coming in about the problem in the second floor nightclub, a
fire engine truck and ambulance were already in the first floor restaurant helping a pregnant
woman. It's typical procedure that a fire engine on the scene would make a decision about asking
for backup, but the units did not respond to three radio calls from the 911 Center. As those calls
increased for help, a 911 operator actually called the club to clarify what was going on. Then
backup was called by the fire engine on the scene.

One witness described the scene: “The smaller women were getting pushed and stamped
on because the bigger guys were really trying to make headway to get out the door, but once they
came to the main entrance, it just kind of like got stuck.”

The Chicago fire commissioner, James Joyce, told an investigator that Le Mirage had
been ordered to shut down the club by court order because of safety violations, including failure
to provide enough exits. Joyce contends that “The operator of this business is well aware of the
court order” that had been entered prior to the incidence. “The operator knows well that he is
not to open that second-floor facility.” According to experts at the Fire Department, the
maximum capacity for the club was 240.

The principal club owner, Dwain Kyles, stated that Le Mirage had a deal with the city to
keep the club open while there was continuing investigation into the safety violations. Dwain
Kyles is a Chicago businessman, and he owns the E2 club with a silent partner, Calvin Hollins,
Jr. Though Kyles had been to the club on many occasions, including several times in the past
month, his silent partner, Calvin Hollins Jr., had never been there and was simply an investor in

the E2 Partnership. The club was managed and operated by Le Mirage All-Night Studio, a small
company that operates different clubs in Chicago and that is run by Calvin Hollins, Jr.’s son,
Calvin Hollins III.

Calvin Hollins IH said the club had been rented to a private promoter for the night—a
firm he identified as Envy Entertainment, run by Marco Flores. Flores was on sight the evening
of the tragic stampede. Envy Entertainment had provided 18 security guards of their own in
addition to the ten supplied by Le Mirage. Flores had posted two of the security guards outside to
keep out additional people who wanted to go into the club. The two security guards that
apparently used the spray inside the club were provided by Flores. According to written
documents, the rental contract between Le Mirage and Envy Entertainment provided that the
space had a maximum capacity of 500.

A clerk for the city claims that a court order from last July banned the club from
operating on the second floor of the building. But Calvin Hollins UI said the “second floor”
discussed in the order referred to an elevated skybox area within the club, not the second floor of
the building.

There is a copy of a letter addressed to “The E2 Club” at the club’s mailing address
dating from two months earlier (December 12, 2002) from leaders of a local community
organization called “Bringing About Reform” complaining about “extreme overcrowding” in E2
and warning it might be “catastrophic.”

Larry Langford, a fire department inspector, said one back exit door was locked and
another back exit door was blocked by laundry bags from the ground-floor restaurant Epitome.
While that would be in violation of city fire codes, it apparently did not contribute to the deaths,
as fire fighters reported that the panicking crowd had surged down a single front exit. According
to Fire Department experts, in most cases like this, people trying to exit use the door that they
used to come in. .

According to some witness estimates, there were around 1,000 people in the club
moments before the stampede.

Mr. Joyce said that fire department inspectors had visited the ground-floor restaurant in
October, but did not visit the E2 nightclub on the second floor because they had no reason to
suspect it was open.

The club has been advertised on the internet and featured in current nightlife listings
during the preceding month. Envy Entertainment had publicized the party in newspapers and
community listings.

Question #2:

There seems to be an acoustic separation between the readings in our textbook on theories of
punishment (Chapter 1 of Kaplan on the “Purposes and Limits of Punishment”) and the
supplemental readings that we did in criminal law theory (Module II readings). I often get the
feeling that these are two very different types of texts that do not speak the same language. All of
these texts, though, really focus on the same issue: crime and punishment.

Please write an essay that helps make sense of any acoustic separation. How are the two
discourses (theories of punishment and Module II readings) related to each other?

Please use the following three excerpts from the theory of punishment readings and the
following three readings from different subparts of Module II to discuss your answer:

1. Beccaria’s On Crimes and Punishments, chapters 1, 2, 6,7, and 12

2. James Q. Wilson’s Thinking About Crime 145-58 (in Kaplan 45—48)

3. John Braithwaite, Crime, Shame, and Reintegration 62, 101-02 (in Kaplan 68—69)

4. Jack Balkin, The Crystalline Structure of Legal Thought, Rutgers Law Review (1986)

5. Randall Thornhill, 4 Natural History of Rape (2000)

6. Mary Coombs, Crime and Punishment: Putting Women First, Michigan Law Review (1995)
Feel free to discuss other readings if related to your argument, but please make sure to cover

these listed readings well.

Please do not paste in summaries of any of the readings or already prepared materials on
these readings.

I really want you to write an original essay with original material that offers an original
argument trying to make sense of the relationship between these two bodies of literature.

Question #3:

Three participants in the ADM case came to our class to discuss their work in connection
with the investigation and prosecution of ADM and Mark Whitacre.

What impression did they, individually and collectively, make on you? Did any one (or two,
or three) of them inspire confidence in the criminal justice system or undermine your confidence in
the system? If you had been their supervising attorney, senior partner, or bureau chief, would you
have promoted them for their work on the case? Would you have assigned them to similar cases in
the future or pulled them off this case? Would you have demoted them? Do you feel more or less
reassured from their presentations and their actions in this case that the ultimate outcome in the
ADM criminal litigation served the interests of justice?

Please write a thoughtful essay about our three speakers that explores the insights that you
learned from them about being a good lawyer or participant in our justice system.
