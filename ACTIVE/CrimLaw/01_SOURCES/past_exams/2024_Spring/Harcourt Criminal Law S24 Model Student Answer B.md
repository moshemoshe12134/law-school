Answer-to-Question- 2 _

Selected Passage:

“Hence that double system of protection that justice has set up between itself
and the punishment it imposes. Those who carry out the penalty tend to
become an autonomous sector; justice is relieved of responsibility for it by a
bureaucratic concealment of the penalty itself... And beyond this distribution
of roles operates a theoretical disavowal: do not imagine that the sentences
that we judges pass are activated by a desire to punish; they are intended to
correct, reclaim, ‘cure’; a technique of improvement represses, in the
penalty, the strict expiation of evil doing, and relieves the magistrates of the

demeaning task of punishing.”

I was particularly stuck by the passage above, in its insights on 1) the
legitimating power of the legal system, 2) its criticism of the utilitarian
Justification of the law, and 3) its reference to the voluntary aquiesence that
the legal system relies on to propagate the social order. Of all the passages in
discipline and punish, I chose this one because I felt that it most illustrates
the pitfalls that I myself might fall into as I enter into the legal profession, in
a system so entrenched in punishment. And I hope that I might reflect on it


in the coming decades to inform my actions and decisions, to remember that

the societal and personal justifications for contributing to punishment are not

always as clear as they seem from within the system itself.

First, the passage criticizes the way in which our “double system” insulates
legal practitioners from the punishment they impose. This insulation
manifests everywhere in the process, but particularly in legitimation in death
penalty cases. As we discussed through the Steiker readings, the over-
legislation in death penalty cases, and the separation between the individual
and the punishment involved, have allowed for decisions such as that in
McKleskey. Despite the overwhelming statistical evidence that black
individuals are discriminatorily impacted by the death penalty, the court
allowed the sentencing. As Foucault expresses in the passage above, this
legitimization is encouraged by the separation between those who impose
the penalty and the penalty itself. Jurors can justify their decision by telling
themselves that they are just following the jury instructions, judges can
Justify by telling themselves they are just following the law. The continued
regulation of the death penalty, narrowing and specifying to provide
legitimation, grows and grows the cushion of separation, furthering

injustice.

Second, the passage invokes the utilitarian justifications for punishment,
reminding us that judges can claim that punishment “corrects, reclaims,

cures.” But it presents this justification as a false comfort that allows judges


to impose the punishment. This is an incredibly prevalent issue in our

criminal justice system, which shows that the comfort of rehabilitation is an
illusion, use to legitimate the continued system of punishment.

As we discussed in class, rehabilitation is an often cited theory of
punishment. We claim that mass incarceration somehow functions to
rehabilitate people who are convicted of crimes. But, this is a false comfort
for those who impose the punishments. The system as it stands does not
serve to rehabilitate. The sheer statistics of re-entry in the context of mass
incarceration indicate that our system of punishment sets people up to fail.
And I was particularly struck by our class discussion regarding Professor
Harcourt friend, who, upon leaving Rikers, was put in the absolute best
available care for people suffering from addition, but every person in the
facility was actively using drugs. This was the best care available and yet it
served to put a man, who already has the stigma of incarceration and the
social impact of removal from society, in the worst possible situation to
come out of the process rehabilitated. Clearly, our system does not serve to
rehabilitate, and yet we persist in punishment and tell ourselves that it is for

the greater good.

Third (and relatedly), the passage as a whole evokes the idea of our own
voluntary acquiescence to the system of punishment. We use tools like
legitimation and rehabilitation to justify our actions within the system of
power. Both of these legitimizing techniques allow individuals to bend to

the social order, judges and juries that pass the sentences conform to the


social order. Like abolitionist judges who ruled against abolitionist causes,

or Antilochus voluntarily submitting to Menaleus’s superiority, or even, or
(the situation that most struck me over the course of this class), Ian
Manuel’s experience trying to escape the hell of solitary confinement. In our
very first class, I could not comprehend how the judges at every step of the
process continued to punish him, when Debbie herself was advocating for
his release. It seemed like a such an obvious injustice, and yet even when the
supreme court rules in his favor, the individual judges still fought to keep
him behind bars. Foucault’s writing on the strength of the social order, and
its overpowering ability to force individuals to subscribe helped me to

understand how we got here.

Overall, I found this passage particularly profound, because it gave me
insight into the levers of power that allow the legal system to operate as it
does. When I arrived at law school, I did not expect to be forced to consider
whether punishment itself was justified. But this passage, and the concepts it
explores, forced me to confront my own biases and assumptions. I had not
thought of myself as a cog in the machine, blinded by legitimation and
consistently bending to the social order. I truly (and naively) believed that I
could distinguish a just course of action and choose the night path in my
legal career. Now, I feel that I am instead primed to consider how these
factors have affected by believes, and whether my decisions and actions are

truly voluntary, or a product of the system we operate in.
