CRIMINAL LAW — SPRING 2024
PROFESSOR BERNARD E. HARCOURT

Final Examination

This year has been exceptionally difficult. I know it has been extremely difficult
for most of you. It has been difficult for me too. Following the campus protests over the
war in Gaza and the militarized NYPD presence and arrests on campus, the university has
made all examinations remote. That presents a threat to the integrity of the examination
process. However, we are all under an honor code that prohibits cheating, and you are my
students after all. If there is anything I hope to have taught you this year, it is the importance
of being an ethical lawyer with a sense of justice.

So I count on you all to take this remote examination with total integrity. I have
written this examination in such a way as to engage directly our classroom discussions. I
do not believe it would help, but in any event please do not use artificial intelligence to
seek answers to these questions. Please do not consult with anyone at any time about your
answers to these questions. I ask that you rely only on yourselves to take this final exam. I
trust that you will, and I thank you for that in advance.

This is now an open-book, three (3) hour, remote examination. It is open-book so
you may refer to your notes, your computer files, and the casebook. Because we are remote
this year, you can also access on-line resources. Do not use any artificial intelligence (AI)
technology. Do not talk to or confer with anyone else. To repeat, you may not speak or
consult in any way with any other human being during the exam and you are asked not to
discuss the exam with anyone at any time.

This examination consists of 7 pages total (including the cover sheet).

This examination consists of two questions that will be graded evenly (50% and
50%). You should spend 90 minutes on each question since they will be weighed equally
toward the final grade.

It is anticipated that you can respond to each question with no more than 1,250
words, for a total of 2,500 words on the exam. You may not exceed 2,500 words for the
total exam. I will not read past the word limit.

You may answer the questions in any order that suits you. Please note clearly the
question that you are responding to and leave several carriage spaces between your answers
to the two questions.

Good luck on the exam and have a great summer when you are done with exams.

Question 1

You are my research assistant. I need to write an amicus brief in a case. I would
like you to work with me on this case.

You will remember that we spoke in class about Robinson v. California, 370 U.S.
660 (1962), and we discussed in class how the holding in that case could be interpreted in
different ways. We also touched quickly in class on the case of Powell v. Texas, 392 U.S.
514 (1968), and I mentioned that it would be important to figure out the possible resolution
of that case by following through on the different possible interpretations of Robinson.
Similarly, we looked closely at the vote count in City of Chicago v. Morales, 527 U.S. 41
(1999) to determine which specific interpretations of the Constitution received 3 versus 6
votes, which were majority holdings and which were minority dissents.

I would like you to use our classroom discussions of Robinson, Powell, and Morales
in the same way here to help me figure out how to argue this case I am working on. Here
are some specifics about the situation.

The City Council of New York City passed an ordinance that punishes “camping
on public property.” § 23-401. According to the City Council, the purpose of the ordinance
is to “prohibit camping in public spaces.” It seems, though, that the way the ordinance is
being enforced by the NYPD against homeless people on the street is to punish them for
sleeping or resting anywhere on public property at any time regardless of whether they
have anywhere else to go.

The exorbitant cost of housing in New York City has thrown many residents into
homelessness, especially as a result of the high inflation and rising rents in 2023-2024. In
November 2023 alone, there were 92,879 homeless people in NYC, including 33,399
homeless children, trying to find shelter each night in New York City’s municipal shelter
system. On many days, off and on, there are no more shelter beds available for homeless
people. In part, Mayor Adams is attributing the shelter crisis for homeless persons to the
immigration crisis and, in his words, to the “influx of immigrants from Texas and Arizona
who are taking up all the city’s housing availability.”

Mayor Adams is defending the enforcement, claiming that the NYPD are merely
exercising authority to regulate unsanitary encampments, fires, illegal drug use, violent
behavior, refusal of shelter options, and obstructed sidewalks and streets.

Homelessness advocates claim that they have witnesses who will attest to the fact
that Mayor Adams told his Police Commissioner that he wanted the NYPD to enforce the
new ordinance in order to “make it uncomfortable enough for the homeless people in our
city so they will want to move out of the city.”

In the new ordinance, “camping” is defined as whenever a person “occupies a place
where bedding, sleeping bag, or other material used for bedding purposes is placed,
established, or maintained for the purpose of maintaining a temporary place to live, whether
or not such place incorporates the use of any tent or any other structure.” § 23-404. The
prohibition on “camping” extends to all “publicly-owned property at all times.” § 23-405.

Under the ordinance, any violation of the “camping” prohibition triggers a
presumptive $500 fine, which increases to $1,000.00 if unpaid. After two citations, the
police may issue an exclusion order that renders the person guilty of criminal trespass if
they remain on public property. Each count of criminal trespass is punishable with up to
30 days in jail and a $2,000 fine. These punishments can accumulate within the course of
a single day. § 23-406.

As a result of the NYPD enforcement measures, homeless individuals sleeping on
the streets are awakened by police officers on a daily and nightly basis; first offenders are
threatened with punishment and told to move along; repeat offenders are given a ticket for
resting or sleeping outside; and some are arrested and being prosecuted for criminal
trespass in violation of the city ordinance and sent to Rikers.

Another provision of the NYC ordinance also makes clear that “camping is
prohibited in public parks,” and it also prohibits “camping in a vehicle parked on the street
overnight.” § 23-402. Elsewhere, the ordinance adds that it is unlawful to “sleep on public
benches.” § 23-403.

Two homeless persons who have been arrested and sent to Rikers for repeated
violation of the ordinance, supported by a homelessness coalition, have filed a motion in
their criminal case challenging the New York City ordinance and the NYPD enforcement
measures, claiming that they violate the Eighth Amendment and Due Process Clause of the
United States Constitution.

I have agreed to write an amicus brief in the litigation. I would like you to please
draft a research memo for me, professional in tone, addressing the strongest arguments on
both sides of the litigation. This really matters to me, so please focus on what is truly
important.

More specifically, I would like you to use the specific framework of our classroom
discussions on how to interpret the principles of the cases of Robinson, Powell, and
Morales to guide me in formulating my best arguments. To do that, please start by using
the framework of our classroom discussions to make the strongest case for the homeless
defendants who are challenging the ordinance: what constitutional claims would Robinson,
Powell, and Morales allow them to bring on the basis of which specific interpretation of
those cases as we discussed in class? Then do the same to make out the strongest case for
the prosecution. Please then evaluate the arguments and tell me who you think has the
strongest arguments and why.

Notice, and let me emphasize, that I am not asking you to write my brief or to draft
the legal arguments in my brief. That would be too easy and, of course, there are many
such briefs online in homelessness litigation over the years and those do not interest me. I
am asking you to continue our classroom discussions, using the ways that we interpreted
the legal principles in Robinson, Powell, and Morales, to guide me in my analysis of this
particular case. Thank you!

Question 2

This year in our Criminal Law course, we read Michel Foucault’s Discipline and
Punish (1975). On several occasions, we discussed how passages of the book related to
particular themes we developed in classroom discussion. At times in class we read specific
passages of the book together and related them to themes we were returning to often in the
classroom. By themes, I do not mean a legal doctrine (such as the battered wife syndrome
defense and how it has evolved over time), but a more general theory about the criminal
law (such as the theme that law is all about relations of power).

To give an illustration, we stopped on a passage on pages 81-82 of Foucault’s book
where he writes: “Throughout the eighteenth century, inside and outside the legal
apparatus, in both everyday penal practice and the criticism of institutions, one sees the
emergence of a new strategy for the exercise of the power to punish [...]: not to punish
less, but to punish better; to punish with an attenuated severity perhaps, but in order to
punish with more universality and necessity; to insert the power to punish more deeply into
the social order.” (81-82) We then discussed how that related to the theme that the law,
especially the criminal law, is all about relations of power and how it helped construct the
social and racial order of antebellum slavery, through the regulation of slavery in cases like
Clarissa (a slave) v. State, as well as the postbellum period, through practices of convict
leasing and plantation prisons that reestablished forms of slavery.

For this exam essay, I would like you to pick a different passage from Foucault’s
book Discipline and Punish (more than three lines, less than eight lines, say) and explain
to the reader how it relates to three themes that we developed in the classroom (different
than the one in the illustration above). As you discuss those themes, you are welcome (it is
a good idea) to flesh them out by discussing legal doctrines and cases (as I would have with
the Clarissa case above, for example).

Feel free to structure your essay as you like, but I would suggest, as a template, that
you structure your essay along the following lines:

First, you could place the passage from Discipline and Punish that you have
identified as the epigraph to your essay.

Second, in an introductory paragraph, you could summarize the thesis of your
essay, quickly explaining the meaning of the passage you have identified, and explaining
how it relates to the three themes you will develop. Typically, I write this paragraph last.

Third, in the first section of your essay, you could discuss and explain the passage
from Discipline and Punish and tell the reader how you interpret the passage and its
Page 6 of 7

importance. You will have chosen a very important passage to you, I assume, please
explain why it is so important to you and what it means.

Fourth, in the next, larger section of your essay, you could identify and discuss the
three themes that we developed in our classroom discussions that are clarified by the
passage you choose from Discipline and Punish. You may want to address each of the three
themes as subparts of this section of your essay, with different subheaders. You may want
to give each theme a concise, sentence-like title or name, so that the reader understands
very clearly what the theme is. In discussing the theme, you may want to refer the reader
to cases or areas of criminal law doctrine that help flesh out the theme itself and make it
concrete.

In a final paragraph, you could articulate the biggest insight you have from your
work on this essay and then point to further questions that it opens.

Please write a well-structured, well-written, engaged, and interesting essay in
response to this prompt. I really care about this, as you know, so please share with me as
much insight as possible. Please do not recycle the passage and ideas that I have presented
as an illustration in this prompt. I look forward to reading your essays!

Please have a great summer when you are done!!!
