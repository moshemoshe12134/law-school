Answer-to-Question- 2 _

"By solemnly inscribing offences in the field of objects susceptible of
scientific knowledge, they provide the mechanisms of legal punishment with
a justifiable hold not only on offences, but on individuals; not only on what
they do, but also on what they are, will be, may be....We must first rid
ourselves of the illusion that penality is above all (if not exclusively) a
means of reducing crime..." (18;24).

Foucault identifies that the great shift in punishment came from no longer
seeking to punish acts but rather to punish individuals--to target the soul and
typify its character and content across temporal bounds, defining the
individual behind the instantaneous criminal act as being so typified not just
in that moment but rather for all his future existence as well. In this way,
punishment evolved to operate on the individual as a means of
"rehabilitation," leveraging punishment to straighten what was crooked and
reinforce the society-wide orientation toward discipline. Consequently, the
purpose of punishment is not to reduce crime but rather to legitimize the
social order, to "otherize" the criminal as inherently wicked and different
from the rest of society. This moralizing and legitimizing instinct arose in
each class but can be seen most prominently in the deconstruction of what it

means to "be" a criminal, how the law cloaks the criminal-legal-ordeal in an


illusion of legitimacy, and how neither truth nor justice are criminal

adjudication's objects.

People are punished based off of who they are, not what they do. Foucault
identifies that social values inform perceptions of culpability and attendant
punishments. In Williams, the race of the defendant Native American
parents was held up as being rightfully instructive of their level of
culpability. After around the fifth day of their child's tooth decay, no
medical intervention could have saved the child, but the odor that would
have alerted the parents to the severity of the condition would have only
been present during the final ten days of the child's life, making the relevant
time period during which intervention could have changed the outcome only
the earliest days of the child's illness. It was reasonable that parents of
Indigenous descent would fear their child's being taken away (at the time,
about 35% of all Native American children were). Further, most parents
would not respond to a child's development of symptoms by immediately
tushing to doctors. Nevertheless, the court purposefully engaged in a narrow
time-framing to ignore the defendant's socioeconomic status, limited
education, and welfare-department concerns but invoked their race to reach
the desired conclusion of a simple-negligence mens rea to warrant criminal
hability. In McQuirter, too, the court invoked the defendant's race (Black) in
light of the purported victim's race (white) to satisfy proving the required
mens rea of intent to rape for criminal attempt liability, playing off racial
stereotypes that trace their genealogy directly to slave law. In both cases,

race was the conclusion: punishment was a means of targeting the individual


for the fact of being a particular race, and "proof" of mens rea was merely a

way of getting there. Likewise, as Bright identifies, conviction is largely
determined not by guilt but by access to effective counsel--the death penalty
is reserved for the poor.

Law's function is to cloak the criminal-legal-ordeal in an illusion of
legitimacy. Law is a ceremony. The trial is a spectacle. The various motions
that can be made, the appeals processes, and so on are but a means of
making punishment scientific: they anesthetize society to what criminal law
is really doing by making it seem like the exclusive means for seeking,
preserving, and upholding that purified, rarefied truth. Indeed, the
constitutionalization of death-penalty law serves as a case-in-point. As
Steiker and Steiker identify, the many layers of capital adjudication--the
prosecutor's decision to seek it, the jury's knowledge that any decision will
be reviewed, the reviewing judges' ability to point to "the People" as binding
their hands--all create a self-reinforcing system of internal and external
legitimation. Despite the fact that only ten jurors sought the death penalty
for Wilson, the judge had no trouble imposing it. Indeed, actors are
comfortable with their decisions because they feel they are inevitable down-
stream effects of a fair system that allows for (too!) much review, diffusing
moral responsibility, just is as seen in Cover's discussion of Shaw's
unflinching upholding of the Fugitive Slave Act out of a sense of legal duty.

The criminal-legal-ordeal neither has as its object nor culminates in
Justice. Rather, the purpose of the criminal-legal ordeal is to make society

internalize and auto-enforce the status quo. Penality is not a means of


reducing crime but rather collecting and using bodies to foster panopticism,

to make individuals internalize the gaze of the powerful. The heat-of-
passion doctrine and battered-women-syndrome cases make this clear.
Indeed, as in Maher, the subjective-approach allowed for the defendant's
charge to be downgraded as he felt provoked by suspicions of adultery,
upholding a patriarchal conception of a man's "right" to a woman in spite of
the long duration during which he could've "cooled-off." Contrastingly, in
Norman, the defendant had been subjected to decades of vile torture at the
hands of her husband and killed her abuser in self-defense, having been
threatened death after seeking support services. Nevertheless, since he was
asleep, the threat was superficially not "imminent" (contra Goetz). Such
arational time-framing used to reach desired conclusions lays bare the naked
motivated reasoning employed to uphold a self-serving (for those in power)
regime in the name of justice and at the expense of the marginalized.

It is in this way that the passage holds particular meaning to me, since it
serves as emblematic of opening my eyes to things I didn't want to see. I'm
ashamed to type that Criminal Law was a course I so badly didn't want to
take that I considered not attending law school simply to avoid it. Foucault
and this class have taught me how important it is to confront what is not just
standing right in front of you but rather is enmeshed in the fabric of society
around you: the carceral state, the disciplining apparatus is not just a part of
society--it defines our society. To understand anything, one must understand
this. As Stevenson explains, we are all more than the worst thing we have

done. "Criminals" are not "criminals," they are humans who committed a


crime; the criminal-justice-system does not do justice, it catches a train of

endured violence at its end.

This essay brought me to ask: so then, what is justice? It's certainly not
what I thought at the beginning of the semester. I think, now, that it is being
willing to open your eyes, being critical of the world around you and
yourself, and then questioning how you can challenge unjustified

hierarchies. Justice begs the question: what more am I to do?
