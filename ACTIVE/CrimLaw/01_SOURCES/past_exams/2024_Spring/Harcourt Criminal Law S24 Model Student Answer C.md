Answer-to-Question-_1_

A

In Robinson, the Court struck down a state law that criminalized addiction to
narcotics. In class we discussed several different reasonings behind the
decision: (1) the lack of an actus reus element in the crime; (2) the problem
of the state’s jurisdiction, because there is no proof that the defendant
actually did anything in California; (3) the defendant did not do anything
voluntarily (addiction limits his free will); (4) punishing addition is cruel
and unusual, and society should focus on treatment for an illness rather than

criminalization; and (5) the state had insufficient evidence to make its case.

In Morales, the Court struck down an anti-loitering statute as a violation of
the 14th Amendment. Again, in class we discussed several lines of
reasoning. First, the law was too vague to satisfy the Constitution’s due
process requirement, so it failed to provide clear notice to citizens, who
could not know what conduct was actually prohibited. Second, the law

encouraged arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement that violated the equal

protection requirement.

In Powell, the Court affirmed a conviction of public drunkenness as a valid
criminalization of an act, not a status. The Court did not accept the argument

that alcoholism removed the element of voluntariness from the defendant’s


conduct, though Justice Fortas’s dissent seemed sympathetic to that view,

writing: “Criminal penalties may not be inflicted on a person for being in a

condition he is powerless to change.”

The arguments against NYC’s anti-camping law should rely on (3) and (4)
in the Robinson analysis above. The defendants arrested for “camping” on
public property under the statute can point to the fact that one some nights

there are no shelter beds available as well as the high (and ever-growing)

cost of shelter on the market to argue that they are not voluntarily engaging
in the prohibited conduct; they simply have no other choice than to sleep on
the sidewalk or in a public park. In fact, it may be more accurate to say that
it was the city itself (by disinvesting in public housing, e.g.) who should
most fairly be considered the “cause” of the prohibited conduct. This aligns
with the dissent in Powell: if the law is prohibiting the condition of

homelessness rather than any actual voluntary act, then the defendant

Additionally, the punishment should be struck down as cruel and unusual: in
a Just society (and a rich one, as NYC surely is!), the problem of
homelessness calls for investment in social services and treatment, not
criminalization. The fact that the punishment for this “crime” involves fines
when clearly the people convicted have no money is a sign that the city’s

punishment sufficiently violates our “standards of decency” (per 8th


Amendment jurisprudence from the death penalty context) so as to be

considered cruel and unusual.

We can also draw on the arbitrariness/discrimination argument from

Morales, especially when considering the city’s enforcement of the statute.
When there are nearly 100,000 homeless people in the city, police
enforcement of the statute is sure to be somewhat arbitrary: on any given
night, why arrest these defendants rather than thousands of others? How
does the city coherently separate the conduct of a person “camping” in a
public space from another New Yorker merely “resting” in a park with a
blanket (which surely counts as “bedding”’)? Can the NYPD show that its
decisions about who to arrest and prosecute are not motivated by punishing

immigrants as a class, for example, when even the mayor seems to be

suggesting that is part of his plan?

The city in trying to uphold the law could counter the voluntariness
argument by using a broader time-frame (per Belkin): although a defendant
might not appear to have the ability to make a choice about whether to sleep
on the street on that particular night, he did make a voluntary decision at
some point earlier in time that led to his current situation. Also, the city
should point to available options (shelter beds or leaving the city) other than

public sidewalks/benches to show that the accused campers did make a


voluntary choice to engage in prohibited conduct.

The city should also point to the majority opinion in Powell, which allowed
for a conviction of public drunkenness as distinguished from the “status
crime” of addiction at issue in Robinson. Here, the conduct prohibited is
public camping: there is a more definite actus reus there than the status of
being homeless, despite what the anti-camping arguments will try to
suggest. In Powell, the majority was not willing to rely on psychological
studies contesting the “free will” of addicted defendants, and the city will
argue that the accused campers at issue here have the ability to either (a)

stay in shelters or (b) leave the city.

Additionally, there is no problem of jurisdiction here, unlike in Robinson,
because the statute plainly prohibits conduct that must take place in certain
public places in the city. And there is no evidence problem: again, because
camping is a more definite act than “being addicted,” the prosecution will be

able to prove the prohibited conduct occurred.

In my opinion, this city ordinance steps over the Constitutional limits of the
criminal law mainly because of problems with a lack of voluntariness of the

prohibited conduct and the arbitrariness of enforcing the statute.


Without stretching the time-frame past reason, the inability of the accused to

change their position seems obvious to me. A person cannot not sleep, after
all. And if there are no other beds, he will eventually stop wherever he is for
some rest. And just like in the anti-loitering statute at issue in Morales, the
conduct defined as “camping” prohibited here seems so vague that the

police will be unable to enforce it in any non-arbitrary manner.

Another main problem is that the city’s goal here seems to be to make
people leave. This seems like a clear 14th Amendment problem: even the
watered-down version of substantive due process that remains in 2024
surely includes the liberty of every person in America to choose where they

want to live.
(... However, after Dobbs, I wouldn’t be too confident in the current Court’s

willingness to strike down the law if it came to that. After all, the USA has a

long “history and tradition” of criminalizing poverty.)
