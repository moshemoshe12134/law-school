Answer-to-Question-_1_

Dear Professor Harcourt,

I believe that the best argument for the defendants is that sleeping outside is
essentially involuntary, so the ordinance actually criminalizes the status of
being homeless. The prosecution will likely argue that the ordinance does
criminalize specific acts rather than a status, and the specificity of the

ordinance precludes it from being applied arbitrarily.

Arguments for the Defendants

The defense can use the Supreme Court decisions in Robinson and Powell to
argue that this ordinance criminalizes the status of being homeless rather
than the act of camping in a public place. Furthermore, homeless residents
can use the decisions in Papachristou and Morales to argue that this

ordinance allows for arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.

In Robinson, the Supreme Court rejected a California statute that
criminalized being an addict in the state. The case provided several potential
rationales for the prohibition on status crimes. For one, it was possible that
Robinson didn’t commit any act in California, and thus the state had no
Jurisdiction or an actus reus for the crime with which Robinson was

charged. Another potential interpretaion was that, as a result of his


addiction, Robinson’s consumption of narcotics was essentially involuntary.

Finally, one could argue that the statute was improper because someone

struggling with addiction should recieve treatment rather than punishment.

Powell upheld a conviction for public intoxication, using Robinson to
determine that such a statute prohibited the act of being intoxicated in public
rather than the status of being an alcoholic. In doing so, the Court rejected
two of the possible rationales for the decision in Robinson. With regard to
the argument the Powell’s public intoxication was involuntary because once
he began drinking he couldn’t stop, the Court determined the fact that
Powell voluntarily took the first drink to be dispositive. Because the chain of
events began with a voluntary act, Powell could be found blameworthy for
his public drunkeness. With regard to the argument that addicts should
recieve treatment rather than punishment, the Court argued that sentencing
Powell to treatment came with the dual risk of institutionalizing Powell
indefinitely and making the medical system a mere extenion of the legal
system. Robinson was thus interpreted to constitutionalize only the act

requirement.

Finally, in Morales, the Court stuck down a city loitering ordinance on two
bases. First, the ordinance encompassed such a wide swath of behavior that
it allowed police to apply the law in an arbitrary, and often discriminatory,

fashion. Second, the ordinance failed to give proper notice to city residents

as to how they should comport their behavior to avoid sanction. Only the


former rationale recieved six votes, the latter was a minority view. The issue

of discriminatory enforcement was also raised in Papachristou, which struck
down a vagabond law, a legacy of slavery and Jim Crow, which were often

applied by law enforcement based on their personal prejudices.

Homeless residents of New York city can use Robinson and Powell to argue
that they lack any actus reus for sleeping outside. Rather, they have been
forced to do so by the lack of shelter beds, an element that is completely
outside of their control. This argument was effective in California, where a
court determined that homeless residents were not sleeping outside due to
their own volition, but because they had been forced to do so by the lack of
adequate shelter, and thus could not be charged with a crime. Furthermore,
unlike Powell, the proponents of this ordinance will not be able to point to a
voluntary act that began the chain of events that led homeless residents to
sleeping outside. For most residents who spend their days trying to find a
place to sleep, the impetus for sleeping outside will have been being turned

away from a shelter.

Furthermore, homeless residents could raise the argument made in Robinson
that their situation requires government assistance, not punishment. While
the Court rejected this argument in Powell, providing more housing does not
come with the same drawbacks as institutionalizing an alcoholic. It wasn’t
clear when Robinson came down that its interpretation should be as limited

as it was in Powell. I believe that the defense has a strong case to argue that


Robinson stands for the proposition that the City has a responsibility to care

for its homeless residents, not punish them.

Finally, the defense can use the holding in Morales to argue that these
ordinances provide police broad leeway to apply the law in an arbitrary and
discriminatory fashion. While many New Yorkers may doze off on public
benches or in their cars, it is clear from the Mayor Adams’s staement that
police are only supposed to use the ordinance to harrass homeless people
until they leave New York City. The ordinance will thus only be applied
against those seen as dangerous or undesirable, which comes with the risk of
serious racial discrimination in enforcement. A useful analogy would be the
application of New York’s Stop and Frisk policy, where 97% of those

stopped were Black or Latinx New Yorkers.

While it is the minority view, it may still be useful for the defense to raise
the issue of notice from Morales. Phrases like “purpose of maintaining a
temporary place to live” or the fact that one can be threatened for “resting”
outside make it difficult for a homeless person to comport their behavior
with the law. Is someone laying down on a picnic blanket in Central Park
creating a temporary place to live? The inclusion of this phrase also bolsters
the argument that this ordinance serves to criminalize a status rather than an
act. While a homeless person or a non-homeless person can lay down on a

blanket in the park, only one might need a temporary place to live.


Arguments for the City

Using Robinson, Powell, and Morales, the proponents of the law will likely
argue that the ordinance criminalizes a voluntary act rather than the status of
being homeless. Furthermore, the City will argue that the camping statute is
sufficiently narrow to both provide proper notice and preclude the ordinance

from being applied in an arbitrary manner.

The City will likely argue for a narrow reading of Robinson and Powell. Just
because a criminal sanction, like public intoxication, disproportionately falls
on alcohlics, does not mean that it criminalizes being an alcoholic. In the
same sense, just because an ordinance that bans camping in public parks
disproportionately falls on homeless residents the ordinance does not
criminalize the status of being homeless. The City will also likely try to
point to a “voluntary act” that set off the chain of events that led to homeless
residents sleeping outside. For immigrants, this act will be coming to New

York City.

Furthermore, the city will argue that the camping ordinance is much more
narrow than the anti-loitering ordinance at issue in Morales. The anti-gang
ordinance allowed for the sanction of anyone gathered for “no apparent
purpose” - a quality which is obviously impossible to determine prima facie.
The anti-camping ordinance, on the other hand, provides specific criteria for

arrest, and looks more like the revised anti-loitering statute passed in


Chicago after the Morales decision. The ordinance provides certain

prohibited acts, like laying down bedding, sleeping in one’s car, or sleeping
on a public bench. This specificity limits officers’ discretion in enforcement.
Furthermore, the City can address the issue of notice by pointing out the fact
that this specificity also gives clear instructions to homeless residents as to

how they can comport themselves to avoid sanction.
