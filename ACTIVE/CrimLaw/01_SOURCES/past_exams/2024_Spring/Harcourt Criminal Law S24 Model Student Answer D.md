Answer-to-Question-_2_

"__.In short, it is not the activity of the subject of knowledge that produces a
corpus of knowledge, useful or resistant to power, but power-knowledge, the
processes and struggles that traverse it and of which it is made up, that

determines the forms and possible domains of knowledge." (P.28)

I believe the meaning of this passage is that knowledge does not exist
objectively and independently, being useful to defend against the
oppressions of power. In fact, knowledge is defined and created by power. I
will discuss in this essay why this understanding is important to me, and
how it relates to three themes I have learned in class: Interpretive
Constructs, Statistics and Discrimination, and the implications of Antilochus

and the Social Order.

This passage and Foucault's elaboration throughout the book made me


rethink the fundamental beliefs I have long held in life. I have always been a

fan of the famous quote from Bacon "Knowledge is Power." I have been
taught by society that the accumulation of knowledge broaden one's horizon
and gives an individual more access to power, and thus knowledge is the
basis of power. Foucault taught me that although it's not entirely false that
knowledge unlocks more access to power at an individual level, the causal
relationship is often misunderstood. With the readings and class discussions
throughout the semester, I gradually realized that the meaning of knowledge
is defined by power relations. Knowledge is not a weapon used to challenge
the power structure; instead, it is defined by the power structure to maintain
the social order. In the parts below, I will elaborate on three themes of this

class and how it relates to the power-knowledge relationship.

Law, Interpretive Constructs, and Biases

The Kelman and Balkin articles at the start of the semester introduced me to
thinking deeper about the fundamental logic (or lack thereof) of the law.
Legal doctrines are a prime example of something people would define as
knowledge. It is complicated, highly detailed, and requires a lot of learning
to master. On its face, it also serves as an example of how the accumulation
of such knowledge creates power. However, Kelman's core concept is that
legal argument can only be made after a fact pattern is characterized by

interpretive constructs.


Take time-framing for example. Martin v. State held that criminal liability
may only apply to voluntary acts. However, whether an act is voluntary is a
normative judgment. In Martin, if we take a broader time frame, we could
argue that his voluntary actions of getting drunk led to his arrest, which later
led to his public intoxication charges. Although legal doctrines appears to be
objective, how it is applied is shaped by how society defines the
blameworthiness of certain actions. How the society defines
blameworthiness is then shaped by power relations. As described by
Foucault, we have all been disciplined by the social order to conform to
different requirement, from how to write to how to sit during the French era,
to the general notions of what being a good citizen is today. This taught me
how knowledge is not "objective" as I used to believe, but subjectively

defined by the relationship of power.

Race, Statistics, and Discrimination

McCleskey v. Kemp really struck me when I read the case. The Court
ignored the glaring evidence of racial discrimination presented by the
Baldus study and focused on the concerns of drawing a limiting principle,
fearing that allowing McCleskey to win would open floodgates to litigations
challenging criminal convictions based on discrimination illustrated in
statistical studies. Perhaps this fear only exists because the social order is

built upon racial discrimination. Everyone who is willing to pay attention


would be able to acquire the "knowledge" that there is a problem of

discrimination. But whether this knowledge is legitimized in the social order
depends of power. The Court defines the rules of the land in a supposedly
unbiased and impassioned way, and that is the "knowledge" that lawyers

acquire and operate under.

On the other hand, the use of statistical evidence in certain ways, especially
to those that are unfamiliar with the methodology, may seem like an
objective usage of knowledge. For example, broken window policing is
based on statistical studies that suggest enforcing certain misdeamenor laws
would lower crime. This legitimizes the policing efforts of minority
neighborhoods throughout the country. However, the methodology behind
the study is dubious (Harcourt, "The Illusion of Order"). In fact, statistical
studies are not immune to bias. Models require subjective selections of
variables and assumptions, which is defined by our conscious or
unconscious biases. The biases are formed through power relations that

shapes our understanding or race, class, and crime.

Antilochus and the Social Order

We started and ended the semester with Antilocus. I was confused about
what it meant at the start, but appreciated it at the end. The point of
Antilochus is to show how the system is designed to maintain social order,

and how we implicate ourselves into the order. The social order is what


defines knowledge. As defined by Foucault, this is achieved through the

microphysics of power.

The Bernie Goetz case is a great example. His claim of self-defense is
completely unsound as a matter of law. However, a jury of ordinary New
Yorkers still acquitted him of murder. If we say that a trial is for the purpose
of searching for the truth ("knowledge"), this further illustrates how
"knowledge" is defined by the social order. Bernie Goetz is the Menelaus of
this story. He must win because any outcome other than his victory would
result in risking the collapse of the established social order. This order is the
America of extreme racism we live in. The way power shaped knowledge is
not through coercion. It is not like a dictator ordered Bernie Goetz to be
acquitted. The decision was made by a jury of ordinary citizens. However,
the microphysics of power was significant in shaping the decision. For
example, how the media portrays the New York subway to be extremely
dangerous likely influenced how the jury looked at the case. Also, the racial
stereotype that Black people are more likely to be criminals definitely
played a role. It is almost impossible to imagine this case's outcome to be the
same if the victims were four white teenagers, and the defendant was a
Black man. This shows that een without the express utilization of power, the
microphysics of power shapes knowledge. Ordinary citizens implicate
themselves into the social order without consciously noticing what they are
upholding. We have been disciplined by the Orthopedic power like the tree
that is being "disciplined" to grow straight. The knowledge of understanding


what the legal doctrine of self-defense is does not lead to power. The power

of the social order defines what self-defense is in this country.

Conclusion:

This has had a profound impact on how I think about the law. I have always
been highly interested in exploring legal doctrines in a logical and almost
mathematical way, but this passage and the semester as a whole have trained
me to think deeper about "why" the doctrine exists, and how it relates to the
power structure of society. There is almost always a deeper answer behind

simple logic.
