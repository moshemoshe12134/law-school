MEMORANDUM
TO: Criminal Law Students
RE: Criminal Law Final Exam (Spring 2016)

DATE: June 7, 2016

Here are some thoughts on how to address the two questions in the final exam.
1. Question #1 (On the Akai Gurley case):

It is important to understand the procedural posture of the case in the question. The jury
has returned a verdict. The case is now on a motion to set aside that verdict. This is not a
question about what charges the prosecution should bring. They have been brought! And there
was a verdict. The question is whether the judge should set aside the jury verdict, in which case
he could only lower the grade of the conviction.

I will not take points off for answers that propose a higher grade of conviction, but that is
not really what the question is about.

From the question, it is clear that the jury found Liang reckless. That’s what
manslaughter in the 2" degree amounts to: recklessness. The jury effectively acquitted on any
higher charge.

The judge has just made findings after the verdict. Those are the findings he gave you It
seems like the judge is finding him negligent only—based on those findings. If you read them
closely, it looks like negligence at most.

That would push the conviction down to negligent homicide.

The main question, then, is whether this is reckless or negligent behavior. This hypo also
presents the possibility of a defense for law enforcement use of force, if it is the latter (negligent


behavior). The main issue, then, and what the answers should focus on is negligence versus
recklessness, and that is key to whether there is a defense of law enforcement use of force.

The use of force defense allows for use of deadly force in course of official business,
regardless of whether there is an arrest. (This has been modified from NYPL; I rewrote the
statute in appendix.)

There are three limits on law enforcement us of force, though:

First, use of physical force only “when and to the extent he or she reasonably believes
such to be necessary to ensure the safety of others or himself, or to defend a third person from

what he or she reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of physical force.”
Question: did Liang think it reasonably necessary for his safety? Possibly.

Second, “The use of deadly physical force is necessary to defend the police officer or
peace officer or another person from what the officer believes to be the use or imminent use of
serious physical force likely to cause great bodily injury.” [Subjective standard of belief]

Note: Here there is subjective standard; so if he was negligent, still available.

Third, it does not allow for use of force when it is reckless. That is part (2). But that
would allow for defense if it were negligence.

Everything then turns on (1) whether the officer was negligent or reckless:

° if negligent, part (2) does not preclude and the subjective standard means that he
can avail himself of the defense, possibly.

° If reckless, part (2) precludes the defense.

So if reckless, no defense and reckless homicide. If negligent, defense if the other factors
are found, in which case no liability. But if they are not, then negligent homicide.

I did make some changes to the rest of the homicide statute that could have altered a
higher charge—although the judge here would not have been in a position to go above the jury’s
verdict of 24 degree manslaughter. (I won’t penalize anyone for suggesting higher sentences).
So, I changed the manslaughter in the first degree to knowledge; there is a possibility that this
was satisfied here. I also changed the murder in the second degree to indifference; it is possible
there was indifference here. But these are beside the point really.


Note: there is also the question of whether the shooting of the gun was involuntary
because some kind of reflex. Perhaps it was reckless or negligent for the police officer to draw
the gun and have his finger on the trigger; but it may have been involuntary. So that should be
discussed as well.

Final Note/Bonus: the statute regarding use of force, as modified, is probably
unconstitutional and below the threshold, so could be challenged by defense counsel. This is
pure bonus if anyone makes the argument.

2. On Question #2 (Consent in the sexual assault context):
Here, it would be helpful to discuss:
a. Difference between disciplinary and criminal proceedings

b. CU is flexible affirmative consent; ALI does not require affirmative consent.
That is important difference. ALI is essentially creating new standard of
“contextual consent.”

c. The ALI new offense is important—sexual penetration without consent. As a
felony. This is worth discussing.

d. The fact of the history of a relationship being relevant to consent is important
under the ALI. The CU seems to go the other way here, saying that previous
relationship “is not consent so sexual activity.” Although not opposite, it seems to
indicate difference valence.

e. Discuss mens rea of reckelessness on ALI 213.2
f. Discuss question of silence or passivity: “does not demonstrate consent” (CU)
and may be okay (ALI).

Most important here is to have a thesis that is comprehensive and has several elements to

Have a great summer, warm regards,
