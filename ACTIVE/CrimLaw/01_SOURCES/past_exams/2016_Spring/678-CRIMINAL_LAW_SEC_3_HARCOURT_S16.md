Question 1:

I first focus on whether L was reckless. Then I discuss how the court should not hide behind pure
legal analysis, and take this opportunity to confront larger, social issues of racial profiling.
Ambitious as it sounds, I'll try my best.

To reach the verdict, the jury must have decided that L recklessly caused Gurley ("G")'s death,
because there is no question that L intentaionlly caused _ the death, and the only other provision
under 125.15 to find manslaughter in the second degree is 125.15-1. So, the key issue is whether the
conduct of Liang ("L") does not constitute recklessness, but only constittues negligence, because
Article 35 doesn't constitute a defense for reckless conduct.

First, what's the relevant actus reus we are examining here? The defendant will want to argue for a
broad, general framing and argue that the relevant conduct we should be examining is whether L's
taking out a gun as he was patrolling the area, where many crimes have occurred in the past, as this
framing could have effect of diluting L's culpability, if any. However, the prosecution can
successfully argue that the relevant conduct to be examined is L's firing a shot as he entered the door
after taking his service weapon out of the holster with his left hand, while taking a flashlight out with
his right hand (not holding the gun with both hands, which might increase possibility of mistakenly
pulling the trigger), and after he heared a "quick sound". This more specific framing of actus reus
seems much more intuitively correct and would allow the court and jury to make the right decision on
this issue.

On the other hand, the defendant could argue for an even narrower scope and argue that since he shot
a fire when he was "frightened" by a "quick sound" as he entered, L's conduct was involuntary. It may
be a factual matter whether it was his body reflex that made him shoot, or he actually made the
decision to shoot (perhaps not to kill but to threaten or in self-defense). But, the prosecution can
again successfully argue for the framing above because this is nothing like (Newton) where the
defendant was getting fired at and lost consciousness in which case we might deem the relevant act
involuntary. In the end, the relevant conduct the court examines should be the one suggested in the
previous pargraph by the prosecution.

Now, having framed the relevant conduct to be examined, the key issue is whether L consciously
disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk that constitutes a gross deviation from what a
reasonable person (or police officer, more on this point later) would have done under the
circumstance as he believed to be. First, was there a substantial risk? The defendant can argue that
there was no substantial risk because it very unlikely that G would enter the door on the seventh floor
almost at the same time as L did. But the prosecution would have the better argument here because
use of a deadly force, whether one actually intends to fire a shot or not, would constitute a substnatial
risk to human life (Carroll).

The more importtant question would be whether there was an unjustifiable risk in L's conduct. The
prosecution would argue that it was unjustifiable because L's patrol was primarily to deter or arrest
criminals dealing drugs in stairs and minimal deterrence effect it would have does not justify a
potential death of a peson. But the defendant can argue that it was not an unjustifiable risk because
potential criminals there likely use violence and L must protect himself and allowing use of a weapon
to threaten potential crminals facilitates effective law enforcement efforts. I think this is a close case.
From a utilitarian perspective, the court might decide that it was not unjustiable risk in order to give
police officers more discretion and autonomy to faciliate effective law enforcement. On the other
hand, one might argue on the same utilitarian ground that potential deaths of human life are worth

much more than deterring and possibly arresting drug dealers who may not cause immediate violence.

In the end, I think that the prosecution would have the better argument here because it seems to be that
L did not have ground to think that violence was awaiting him on the other side of the door. I am not
sure what the NYPD conduct regulations suggest, but based on limited facts we're given, it seems to
be that L's particular situation did not warrant his taking out the gun, although in many similar
circumstances where police officers have probable cause to think that danger awiats on the other side
of the door, it may be a justifiable risk (to protect police officers, and to faciliate law enforcement in
general).

The most important question, I think, is whether he consciously disregard the risk at that time. We
know that there is no evidence that L knew that there were people in the stairwell when he fired the
shot. The only evidence we have is from the defendant that he heard a "quick sound" and was
frightened. We already established that the defendant will not succeed in arguging that the conduct
was involuntary. I think it's a similar question, but here it's more about his awareness of what we've
discussed above regarding the risk at that time. The prosecution can argue that since he's a trained
police officer, he should be held to a higher standard (Hall), and conclude he must have been aware
of such risk (it's safe to assume that he must have learned about these risks in using the force). The
defendant would argue that he wasn't aware because he was only a rookie and was only his second
time working in Pink Houses. This a quasi-factual matter because it's unlikely that L actually would
remember correctly what was happening, and we have to find a kind of constructive awareness.
Rather, it'd be a matter of what evidence will be allowed and how they will be argued at trial. If we
have more evidence to show that he must have been aware, then he'd be reckless and the verdict
should stand. If we have more evidence to show otherwise, verdict should be set aside (and the
appropriate charge will likely be criminal negligence, but Article 35 would provide defense, so L
won't be convicted).

Now, with limited evidence we have, my recommendation to the court is that it should let the verdict
stand. Although the court could engage in some technical intepretation battles over particular
languages of Article 35 and over admissibility of evidence, I suggest that the court more candidly
look at the social contexts and dynamics in which this legal analysis is supposed to be embedded. As
Kelman suggests, court's technical legal analysis would likely result in a decision that only affirms
the majoritarian values, and so, in our motion, our perceptions may be affected by the fact that the
victim was a black man and the neighborhood, populated dominatnly by blacks, was "dangerous".
With these perceptions, we might err and incorrectly overturn the verdict, especially when there's
scant of evidence and we have to rely on technicality.

Here, in our case, it will be racial profiling of police officers. In our class, we discussed in many
situations where the court hid behind legal formalism instead of confronting important and urgent
issue of society. (Clarissa, Wyatt, Williams). I don't suggest that this court's decision here would
resolve issues of racial profiling, but this case presens a great, rare opportunity (rare because not
every case gets its deserved publicity - See Doyle Hamm case) where the court can address such
issues and send a message to the society. As we saw in (Eric Garner) case, it seems to be that police
officers have tendency to use more deadly force when they're patrolling an area where blacks are
predominant population. Also, since they patrol such areas more frequently/heavily, it's much more
likely that incidents like our case at hand and (Garner) happen to black men who are innocent. So the
court must address these issues and examine how these facts were relevant to L's conduct. Had he
been in a "safer" neighborhood populated mostly by whites, would L have acted the same? Such
questions should not go unnoticed. As we saw in (Scott), what appeared to be a very unreasonable
runaway made more sense, as we discussed how Scott might have felt fear because of how police has
treated blacks in the area, and also how the police who chased him might have believed he needed to
use deadly force because of his racial profiling (presumptively concluding that a black man who runs
away must be a crimninal). To prevent more of these situations, the court should take this opportutnity
to examine invidious effects of racial profiling and hold L liable (barring any introduction of more

conclusive evidence to show that L was not reckless).
