Prosecution

The prosecution would charge Liang with manslaughter in the second degree (125.15(1)). The
main arguments between the prosecution and the defense will be between whether Liang was
reckless or negligent in the killing of Gurley, whether Liang committed a voluntary act, whether
Liang's actions were justified under Article 35, and whether MPC 3.09 applies in this jurisdiction.
Both sides will agree that the element of causation existed in this case. There was actual case
because but for Liang firing his weapon, the death of Gurley would not have happened and it was
reasonably foreseeable that firing a gun into a room could cause death.

The mens rea of recklessness, needed to convict Liang of manslaughter in the second degree, is
defined in MPC 2.03. A person is reckless when he consciously disregards a substantial and
unjustifiable risk that the death of a person would resulf from his conduct. The risk must be of such a
nature that considering the circumstances, the defendant grossly deviated from the standard of care a
law-abiding person would observe in his situation. Liang clearly acted recklessly when he put
himself in a situation where he fired a gun when there was no threat against him. When firing a gun
into the stairwell, he disregarded the risk that someone was in the room and that his bullet could hit
someone. The record states that he fired the weapon almost immediately after opening the door to the
stairwell. He therefore would not have had time to accurately assess the situation in the room and
there was no reason for him to be discharging his weapon. Liang was more than negligent because he
would have been aware that firing his weapon into a room had a risk of hitting someone and he
disregarded that risk.

Liang's actions were not justified under Article 35. Liang's best argument would be that his use
of deadly force was justified under section (1)(c) because it was necessary to defend the police
officer from what the officer believes to be a threat of deadly force against himself. The statute
requires the officer reasonably believes that he deadly force is necessary to defend the police officer.
Later the statute provides subjective standard: whether the officer believes someone is about to use
deadly force against him. Admittedly, the statute seems to use two contradictory standards of review.
The prosecution will argue that the statute requires an objective standard of review from the words
"reasonably believes." When he opened the door, he immediately fired a shot. There simply was not
enough time to see and comprehend such a threat. Therefore he did not reasonably believe that firing
his weapon was necessary and disregarded a serious risk that there was a person in the dark room
who he did not see. The defense will argue that there is a subjective determination of mens rea with
regard to whether he believes a person was using deadly force against him (see below). Even if the
court uses the subjective standard and even if he did actually believe that there was a threat of death
or serious harm, the defense would not be available to him under section 2. Under Section 2, this is
not a justification if the officer conducted himself recklessly. He was reckless in his formation of his
belief that he was under the threat of serious harm and therefore cannot use the defense.

Even if the court finds that Liang did not act recklessly and rather acted negligently, the
prosecution will argue that he can still be held liable for criminally negligent homicide. Prosecution
would argue that MPC 3.09 applies in this case. This provision does not allow the justification of
self-defense if the defendant negligently or recklessly formed the belief to whether it was necessary
to act in self defense when negligence or recklessness is sufficient for prosecution for the underlying
defense.

Defense
The defense counsel would try to argue that Liang did not commit a crime at all because for
two different reasons: he did not commit any voluntary act and his actions were justified under
Article 35(1)(c). In the alternative, he would argue that he only acted negligently and could not be
held liable because MPC 3.09 does not apply because it contradicts Article 35.
There was no voluntary act because Liang's firing of the gun was a result of an involuntary reflex.
Under MPC 2.01(1), a person cannot be held liable for a crime unless it is based on conduct which

inclues a voluntary act. As an inexperienced police officer, Liang was not yet completely
comfortable on the job. Additionally this was only his second time patrolling the Pink Houses and
did not know what to expect. We can assume that the reason Liang was in this complex in the first
place because there was some level of expected crime being performed there. Wherever there is
crime, there is a danger to police officers because many criminals will do anything to avoid being
caught. Therefore Liang was justifiably jumpy naturally reacted to hearing a noise to his left in the
pitch dark stairwell. Without a voluntary act, Liang would be completely absolved of liability.

Assuming the court find that the actus reus requirement was fulfilled, the defense will argue that
Liang was only negligent and therefore the proper charge would be criminally negligent homicide
(125.10) at most. The negligence is defined in MPC 2.03. The main difference between negligence
and recklessness is that recklessness requires that the defendant consciously disregard a risk while
negligence requiress that the defendant should have been aware of the risk. The defense will argue
that Liang was not aware of the risk that there would be a person in the pitch black stairwell. It is
strange that someone would be in a pitch black stairwell.

The defense would argue that Liang should be completely absolved of liability by Article 35.
In paragraph (c) of Section (1), the statute uses a subjective standard to whether a person was using
or imminently using serious physical pforce likely to cause great bodily injury. Therefore if the
defendant believed that there was a serious threat, that threat should be considered in the analysis of
whether the officer "reasonably believes. . . the use of deadly physical force is necessary. . .."
Defense would argue that Liang believed that Gurley was about to use deadly force against him.
Liang could argue that he believed that Gurley was waiting to ambush him from the darkness as soon
Liang went into the stairwell. So as long as it is established that Liang believed that he was under the
threat of deadly force, it should be easy to prove that he reasonably believed that it was necessary for
him to use deadly force.

Depending on whether the jury found Liang negligent or reckless, the defense would argue that
MPC 3.09(2) would not apply in this case because it would contradict Article 35. They could argue
under the NYPC and the MPC, it would be impossible to charge officer Liang of criminally negligent
homicide in this case. Therefore if the court finds Liang to be only negligent in his actions, he would
be absolved of liability. Article 35 does not allow the defense to be used if Liang acted recklessly.
Under the statute interpretation method inclusio unius, that this provision cannot be applied if he
acted negligently. Because MPC 3.09 includes disallows both negligently and recklessly formed
beliefs, defense would argue that it and Article 35 could not stand together. By choosing to disallow
the defense for recklessness only, the NY Legislature consciously decided to not include 3.09 in NY
law.

Officer Liang had no duty to retreat under section 3.04(b)(ii) because he is a police officer.
Conclusion

Ultimately, the court would likely find Liang guilty of criminally negligent homicide. The court
would take a wider time-framing view of the actus reus requirement (Becker). It would find that all
of Liang's actions leading up to him discharging his weapon contributed to him firing the gun
reflexively. I think it would be difficult to find that he had the mens rea of recklessness because he
likely did believe that there was some danger to him. Ultimately, being a police officer is a
dangerous job and the officers can make bad decisions. The jury would not find that he acted
recklessly, but rather negligently. He should not have fired his weapon because there was no serious
threat to him. He should have been in a better, clearer frame of mind in order to fully appreciate the
risk that discharging his weapon would have. He was likely not fully aware of the risk. He did not
reasonably believe that the use of deadly force was necessary even if he did subjectively believe that
he was being attacked by deadly force. The court will likely find that MPC 3.09 does apply and he
can be charged with criminally negligent homicde.
