Question #2

I believe that both Columbia and the ALI have taken important steps towards educating and protecting
individuals and society by adopting more modern and comprehensive policies regarding sexual
assault and rape. Though the Columbia Gender-Based Misconduct Policy for Students and the MPC
approach the issue from different points of view - the former is Communalistic and the later
Individualistic; the former creates rules while the involves standards; and the former focuses on a
short-time frame while the later uses a larger contextual time-framing rule; both rules represent a
significant improvement from historical policies and laws concerning sexual assault and rape. In
particular, they both move away from the heteronormative patriarchal language that has populated
statutes and guidelines concerning sexual offenses for most of history.

The Columbia Policy explicitly places responsibility for for ensuring consent on the "defendant." It
states that if there is any "confusion or ambiguity, participants in sexual activity need to stop and
verbally clarify each person's willingness to participate" and stressed the importance of not making
assumptions about the other's willingness to start or continue sexual contact or activity (R4). This
policy places a large amount of responsibility on the individual - it is a Communalist approach in that
it seems to "emphasize and extend the responsibilities and duties individuals owe to others" (Balkin,
The Crystalline Structure of Legal Thought). This rule therefore creates greater responsibility, and
lesser excuse for, an individual's actions in the context of sexual activity. In contrast, the MPC
approach is more Individualist. The Comment to 213.0 states "the Code treats consent as something a
person does, not something the person feels. It therefore defines consent not as "willingness," as
subjective emotion, but as an observable behavior that communicates willingness."This kind of rule
fits the Individualist position more closely because it stems from a desire to de-emphasize or
minimize the responsibilities and duties of individuals in society. The idea motivating the need for
consent to be observable and communicated fits right into a Individualist Criminal Law Argument -
"No liability without fair warning." Though these approaches differ, it is perhaps appropriate that
Columbia, a relatively insular and self-selecting community, places a higher burden on its members
to behave in a socially beneficial manner, while the MPC, which applies to everyone in the US,
creates a rule that is less demanding for the individual. Furthermore, the consequences for violating
the Columbia Policy are expulsion at worst, while the consequences for the crime of rape could be a
lifetime behind bars. Therefore, since the punishment in the MPC is far harsher, it makes sense, from
a retributivist point of view, that society would only want to impose such a punishment on someone
whose behavior was similarly "more serious."

Another marked difference between the Columbia Policy and the ALI's provisions is the manner
which they view a sexual interaction which could involve assault or rape. The Columbia Policy is
presented as a set of strict rules - consent "can" or "cannot" be given in particular ways, and
ambiguity of any sort requires resolution through verbal clarification. In contrast, the ALI allows
consent to be "inferred from a person's behavior" and assessed "in the context of all the
circumstances" (213.0(3)(d)). The ALI's conception is more akin to a standard. Both these
approaches fall victim to the classic issues plaguing rules and standards respectively: the rules "are
capable of uniform and unprejudicial application, but will inevitably be over and under inclusive" -
this case perhaps overinclusive given the Columbia's Communalist approach. Furthermore, a "bright-
line, automatic rule" may be implausible given "the complexities of dating relationships" (Schulofer,
Unwanted Sex, 73). In contrast, standards alleviate such problems but "may be difficult to administer
and may be enforced in biased, unequal, and uncertain fashions" (Kelman, Interpretive Constructs).
As a result, a situation that would be considered consensual under the ALI's provision may not be
under Columbia's policy. This gap is addressed by the additional consideration of Section 213.3,
which criminalizes sexual penetration without consent "if he or she engages in an act of sexual
penetration and knows, or consciously disregards a substantial risk, that the other person has not
given consent to that act." This provision, though it only applies to sexual penetration and not other
sexual acts, places a slightly heightened duty upon the individual than 213.0 does - but nevertheless ,
this is a knowledge standard, which is relatively favorable to defendants. In contrast, the Columbia

Policy rules are far more reminiscent of a strict liability standard. Personally, I would suggest that
the ALI adopted something closer to a recklessness or criminal (gross) negligence standard, under
which someone "who should be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk" that he or she has not
obtained consent and is therefore committing an offense, would be liable. This kind of mens rea
requirement would eliminate a risk of "defining non-consensual intercourse on the basis of the
subjective view of the more aggressive individual in a sexual encounter" (Commonwealth v. Sherry).

The final distinction between the Columbia Policy and the ALI's proposed provisions are that when
assessing liability the Columbia Policy uses a very narrow interpretive timeframe which the ALI
employs a broader time frame that takes into account context. The Columbia Policy's focus on
individual moments - ie. "one form of sexual activity does not imply consent to other forms;" "consent
can be initially given but withdrawn at any time." This disjoined way of viewing a sexual encounter,
in which prior interactions have no bearing on whether consent is or is not present, means the focus is
on a single very narrow moment during which consent is or is not given. In contrast, the ALI proposes
a unified account of an encounter "in context of all the circumstances" (R5). Once again, both
approaches have their drawbacks and advantages - the latter is particularly problematic because it
may be used to legitimate sexual assault or rape within a relationship or marriage because the pre-
existing relationship or course of conduct provides context favorable to the defendant.

In sum, both the Columbia Policy and the ALI's proposed provisions attempt to create sexual assault
policies and laws that are more favorable to victims. This is critical given the law's long history of
distrust of rape victims (Estrich Real Rape), which has manifested in various despicable ways,
including the "utmost resistance" requirement and exclusion of marital rape; and the MPC's current
tule allowing a victim's "promiscuity" to be entered into the record as evidence for defense. Both
statutes acknowledge the indispensability of the "no means no," as the bare minimum of any statute
addressing sexual assault (Schulhofer, Unwanted Sex) and have gone beyond that requirement. The
fact that Columbia and the ALI differ in their approaches is not necessarily a problem, since they are
functioning in different capacities and within different environments.
