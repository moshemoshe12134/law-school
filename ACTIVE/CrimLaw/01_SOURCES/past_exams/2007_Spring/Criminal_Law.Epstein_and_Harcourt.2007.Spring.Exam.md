Final Examination

This is an open-book, three-and-a-half hour, in-class examination. You may
refer to your casebook and notes, but you may not use either treatises or other
casebooks during the examination, nor have access to any online materials, nor may
you talk to or confer with anyone else. You may not speak or consult in any way
with any other person during the exam.

This examination consists of 9 pages total (including the cover sheet). There
are four questions, and you must respond to all four questions. The examination will
be graded 1/4 on each question, so we would recommend spending equal time on
each question.

You may answer the questions in any order that suits you. Please begin the
answer to each question on a new page, noting clearly the question to which you are
responding. Each exam answer page should include a header containing your
student exam number, the name of the examination, and the pagination, specifying
the last page (e.g., “Page 3 of __”). Please double space your answers with 1-inch
margins and use a 12-point New Times Roman font.

Your answers should be specifically tailored to the questions. You should not
cut and paste any materials from your notes. In fact, if you feel tempted to cut and
paste materials from your notes, you should immediately think to yourself that the
materials are not sufficiently tailored to the question that we are asking.

The two halves of this course are not hermetically sealed, and you should feel
free to use any material from any part of the course in answer to any question. We

have indicated next to each question which professor has prepared and will grade it.

Good luck on the exam and have a great summer when you are done with
exams.

Just last week, the Louisiana Supreme Court affirmed a sentence of death in a
case involving a man accused of aggravated rape of his eight-year-old step-daughter.
According to the victim, she awoke on the morning of the incident with her naked step-
father on top of her, covering her eyes with his hands, and engaged in vaginal sexual
intercourse. The victim suffered serious physical injury, including profuse bleeding and
internal tearing, and required surgery.

In affirming the sentence of death, the Louisiana court rejected a challenge to the
constitutionality of the aggravated rape statute. The statute provides, in pertinent part:

Aggravated rape

A. Aggravated rape is a rape committed upon a person sixty-five years of age or
older or where the anal, oral, or vaginal sexual intercourse is deemed to be
without lawful consent of the victim because it is committed under any one or
more of the following circumstances:

... (4) When the victim is under the age of thirteen years. Lack of knowledge of
the victim's age shall not be a defense.

D. (1) Whoever commits the crime of aggravated rape shall be punished by life
imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of
sentence.

(2) However, if the victim was under the age of thirteen years, as provided by
Paragraph (A)(4) of this Section:

(a) And if the district attorney seeks a capital verdict, the offender shall be
punished by death or life imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of parole,
probation, or suspension of sentence, in accordance with the determination of the
jury.

(b) And if the district attorney does not seek a capital verdict, the offender shall
be punished by life imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of parole,
probation, or suspension of sentence.

The Christian Science Monitor reports that “Missouri, in 1964, was the last state
to execute someone for rape. Many states had such laws on the books until 1977 when
the US Supreme Court ruled that the death penalty could not be imposed in the rape of an
adult woman.” According to the Monitor, “Louisiana drafted its child-rape law in 1995
and is the only state with such a specific law. Florida and Montana have capital-rape laws
on their books, but prosecutors don’t make use of them.” The New York Times adds that
“no one has been executed for a crime that did not involve a killing since the Supreme
Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976.” However, the Times notes that, since 1995,
“four other states have joined Louisiana in allowing capital punishment for child rapists.
Three of them -- Montana, Oklahoma and South Carolina -- enacted somewhat narrower

2 of 9


laws, in that they require multiple convictions. Georgia’s law allows the death penalty for
those who rape children less than 10 years old. On Friday, the Texas Legislature
approved a bill allowing the death penalty for those convicted of multiple rapes of
children under 14. Krista Moody, a spokeswoman for Gov. Rick Perry, said he favored
the bill and was inclined to sign it.”

Question: What constitutional arguments would you make for and against Louisiana’s

aggravated rape capital statute? Please draft two memoranda of law, one challenging the
constitutionality of the statute and one supporting the constitutionality of the statute.

Question 2

The following account has been prepared for you by the lead investigator in your
office, drawing on news accounts, interviews, and 2,000 pages of documents. The file
includes news clippings, interviews, and reports. You rummage through the file and read
the following:

Deborah Dumont sat through the testimony of her fourteen-year-old daughter,
Virginia, in the trial of her second husband—accused of sexually assaulting her
daughter, Virginia, when she was eight years old—and she became physically and
emotionally ill. Deborah had to leave the courtroom, the testimony was upsetting
her so much. That night, after abusing her prescription drugs, she decided to take
the law in her hands. She hatched a plan to secret her LadySmith handgun into the
courtroom and shoot her second husband at the first opportunity. She told no one,
having decided to do this on her own.

The following morning, after continuing to abuse her prescription drugs,
Deborah managed to get her revolver through the metal detector at the courthouse
and, as soon as her husband had sat down at defense table, his back to the
audience, she pulled out her gun and fired off three shots in his direction, barely
missing him, but accidentally hitting the defense counsel in the leg—causing a
non-fatal gun wound to his upper thigh. While she was discharging the three
shots, two marshals, Mike Macon and Nick Norris, pulled out their semi-
automatic weapons and lunged at Deborah. Virginia, who had been walking to the
witness stand to resume her testimony and had not seen who had fired, saw the
marshals lunging at her mother and instinctively ran to protect her, getting into a
physical struggle with one of the marshals, Mike Macon. Virginia grasped that
marshal’s guns while the second marshal subdued Deborah.

Virginia and the first marshal, Mike Macon, were struggling over his weapon.
Macon was pleading with Virginia to desist, explaining that he was simply trying
to subdue an assailant. Virginia thought for a moment about shooting her step-
father in all the chaos and began to struggle for the gun more aggressively, when
all of a sudden Virginia’s hand and arm swung off to the side with Macon’s gun.
Virginia’s hand, holding the semi-automatic, hit the bar as she fell to the floor,
and the gun discharged in the direction of the second marshal, Nick Norris,
striking him in the chest. Four other marshals had entered the courtroom by this
time and, guns drawn on Deborah and Virginia, physically detained and arrested
them both.

Paramedics arrived to take Norris to the hospital. On the way, the ambulance
driver, Arthur Anders, who had a blood-alcohol level above the legal limit,

4 0f 9


collided with a negligent driver who had swerved off the road to avoid the
ambulance, throwing the wounded marshal, Nick Norris, out of his gurney and
against the front separating wall of the ambulance. Norris snapped his neck
against the ambulance wall, severely injuring his spinal cord. Norris was then
taken, by means of a second ambulance, to the hospital. He died the following day
from complications arising from the surgery to remove the bullet from his chest
cavity and repair his spinal cord. The medical examiner determined that the cause
of death was the compound effect of the gunshot and spinal injury from the
accident.

Question: Assume that the jurisdiction has adopted all the provisions of the Model Penal
Code with the single exception of the homicide provisions, which were adopted from the
New York Penal Code (1999 & Supp. 2003) (reproduced at pages 301 to 304 of our
Kaplan textbook). In other words, in this jurisdiction, the MPC applies with the exception
of Article 210, which has been replaced by New York Penal Code Article 125.

1. You are the county prosecutor. You want to prosecute this case fully and
fairly. What are the charges that you would bring?

2. If you were the public defender, how would you defend against those
charges?
3. As the prosecutor (again), how would you reply to these defenses?

Question 3

Michael Murphy worked in Chicago for many years as a technician for the firm
OnGard, which specialized in installing security systems for the rich. In October 2006, he
was let go by the firm because he had engaged in extensive gambling in contravention of
company rules. Following his dismissal, Murphy continued to gamble and incurred heavy
debts to a small-time loan shark, Tommie Tuff. On May 21, 2007, Tuff warned Murphy
that his $100,000 debt “had to be paid in full, no excuses, or you will have to pay in
blood.” Then, in a more helpful mood he added, “You gotta know some place to hit given
all your work in that security biz.” He further added gruffly that Murphy had better not
try to leave town because he would be hunted down by Tuff’s goons.

Quite by chance, on May 22, 2007, Murphy read in the obituaries that one Brenda
Blanchard, a wealthy and reclusive banker who resided at 465 Astor Street, had just died.
One year earlier, Murphy had installed a safe and a security system in Blanchard’s house,
befriending her on the job. Blanchard, who lived alone, had told him “in confidence” that
the safe was to store substantial sums of cash and valuable jewels, to keep them hidden
from the prying eyes of her nephews and nieces. She also told him that, as a memory aid,
she planned to use in sequence the first eight digits of OnGard’s billing number for the
safe’s combination of four two-digit numbers.

Murphy was confident that if he could find out the billing number, he could get
the cash and jewels. That afternoon, he returned to OnGard and sidled over to Sarah
Sweetheart, a file clerk in the office whom he had previously dated, and innocently asked
her for a look at the Blanchard file because he was doing a private job at the house.
Sweetheart had been repeatedly told by the firm’s owner that company policy forbade her
from giving anyone access to files without cause. But when Murphy said that he needed
to look at the file for only a moment “for old times sake,” Sweetheart let him, after
removing the floor plan to Blanchard’s house. Murphy jotted down the billing number
from the invoice. As he left, he whispered “Shhhh!” He also put a $20 bill on
Sweetheart’s desk, which she promptly put into a collection tin for Chicago City
Charities.

That evening Murphy telephoned one of his old high school buddies, Bobby
Blackmark, at his Gary, Indiana, home and spoke of the expected large stash of money
and jewelry in an empty house. He stressed to Blackmark that there was to be “no rough
stuff on this job.” He also asked Blackmark to recruit a trusted friend to help. Shortly
thereafter, Murphy received a voicemail message from Tuff saying, “I’m watching. Hurry
up or else!”

The next evening, May 23, 2007, Murphy and Blackmark met outside the Astor
Street house. Blackmark had brought with him Jason Jackal, a surly fellow who,
unbeknownst to either Blackmark or Murphy, had served time in prison for armed
robbery. Time was short, and Murphy decided to get on with the job quickly. He didn’t

6 of 9


ask Jackal any questions about his background and just cautioned him that there was to
be “no rough stuff.”

Murphy had Blackmark stand guard outside, to communicate by cell phone if
anything suspicious happened. Murphy and Jackal then forced open the front door to
Blanchard’s house and ran quickly upstairs to the hidden safe. Murphy was prepared to
try the billing code combination—which was in fact correct—only to discover that the
safe was already unlocked. The safe contained neither cash nor jewels but did hold a
small envelope filled with papers, which Murphy hurriedly stashed into his pocket. At
that instant, Blackmark phoned Murphy to say that someone was checking out the front
door. Thoroughly panicked, Blackmark decided that he wanted out of the scheme and
tried, without success, to get through to 911 before he fled. Meanwhile, that “someone”
was William Wilson, an off-duty police officer in plain clothes who was moonlighting for
the Astor Street Protective Association. Wilson entered the unlocked door on the ground
floor, pistol drawn. Murphy and Jackal heard his footsteps. Jackal pulled out a gun and
started downstairs. Murphy hissed to him, “I told you, no guns and no rough stuff!
You’re on your own!” But Murphy did nothing to stop Jackal. Moments later, Murphy
heard a loud shot down below, as Jackal killed Wilson. As these events transpired, Tuff
was waiting on the corner in order to relieve Murphy and his pals of their loot as they left
the house. Tuff ran away when he heard the shot.

Shortly after this incident, some efficient police work tracked down all the parties
involved in this case: Blackmark, Jackal, Murphy, Sweetheart, and Tuff. The recovered
envelope contained a bunch of cancelled checks and old receipts that were left when the
executors cleaned out the safe the previous day.

The Illinois state prosecutor has asked you to write a memo indicating all the
possible crimes, state or federal, that might be charged against these five persons, as well
as any possible crimes by OnGard. He also would like to know the strength of the case
and possible defenses that could be raised. He realizes that there is little time and asks
you to write the memo right away.

Question 4

The Ogden Street Park is in a congested area on the South Side of Chicago. The
park is of medium size, and the neighborhood teenagers often gathered there to play
softball, even though they knew that balls were regularly hit out of the park. The balls
often landed in the yards of nearby houses and occasionally broke windows that
overlooked the park. A sign posted in the park read, “No ball playing allowed: violators
subject to fine.” The sign was regularly ignored by the teens, who left the park only on
the rare occasions when asked to do so by the police. On April 20, 2007, a particularly
spirited game ensued in which Rosie Redmond, a notorious free swinger, hit a
tremendous clout off Kyle Kramden, which went straight through the plate glass living
room window of Dorian Dean’s house. The softball in question was owned by Laura
Lockwood, who had participated in the informal game. As the other kids scattered,
Lockwood immediately ran home and spoke to her mother Susan, pleading with her to go
over to the houses. Susan said that she would have “nothing to do with that creep Dean,”
but then asked her brother, Laura’s uncle Ned Norwood, to go over to Dean’s house and
“to do what it takes” to recover her ball, warning him to be “prepared for trouble.”
Norwood was a strapping 35-year-old six-footer with a couple of beers under his belt,
who was known to be willing to mix it up. He knocked loudly on the door of Dean’s
house and demanded the return of the ball. Dean, who was no shrimp himself, yelled
back, saying, “I don’t care whose damn ball this is, I’m going to keep it as a down
payment for all the damage caused by that infernal gang of kids!” Dean then slammed the
door, at which point Norwood picked up the tin lid from the trash can and started banging
angrily on the porch, denting some boards and threatening loudly to break the furniture
unless the softball was promptly returned.

Dean then headed to the back of his house to get a baseball bat in order to frighten
Norwood away, screaming to himself, “No one is going to take advantage of me if it’s the
last thing I do!” These words were heard by Hector Hapless, Dean’s 20-year-old nephew
who had recently come to stay with Dean, who had been warned by social workers that
Hapless needed a quiet and stable environment. Hapless had from childhood a serious
mental illness that had resulted in his being shuttled in and out of institutions and foster
care and back and forth among family members, who quickly tired of his quirky and
threatening behavior. A chronic loner who alternated between bizarre behavior, sudden
outbursts and quiet passivity, Hapless had been treated by a psychiatrist who diagnosed
his condition as paranoia. When Hapless was 18 years old, he attempted to assault his
neighbor for no apparent reason; the neighbor was able to scramble to safety, and no
charges were brought. For the 2 years before he came to Dean’s house, he had exhibited
odd but not dangerous behavior. When Hapless heard the commotion, he tensed up.
Instantly, he grabbed a large knife out of the kitchen drawer and bolted to the front door.
Norwood, who was preoccupied with banging the garbage cans, did not see Hapless
lunge toward him. Before he could do anything to defend himself, he was stabbed twice
by Hapless, who screamed, “Go away you bad man from my house!” at the top of his

8 of 9


lungs. Fortunately, two bystanders who had been attracted by the melee were able to
subdue Hapless before he killed Norwood.

When the police arrived, they took Norwood, Dean, and Hapless into custody.
Hapless calmed down and explained with clinical detachment the events that led him to
attack Norwood “‘in self-defense, like I was always taught.” While in custody he was able
to take care of himself in normal fashion, although he continued to exhibit odd behavior
and nervous ticks, which could be controlled, however, by standard medications. Dr.
Mary Maroney, psychiatrist for the defense, is prepared to testify that Hapless’s paranoia
is highly selective and that, like most paranoid schizophrenics, he is subject what are
known as “encapsulated delusions,” which means that, while paranoid schizophrenics can
look “pretty normal” in most circumstances, they can snap the moment “somebody asks
them a question or makes a movement that they regard as threatening—suddenly, bizarre
thinking takes over, and they react in ways that are both irrational and unexpected.” Dr.
Peter Parker is prepared to testify for the state that Hapless’s ability to articulate the
appropriate standards for the use of force indicates that he was sane for all legal purposes.

The folder of the entire case has been submitted to you for evaluation by the Cook
County prosecutor’s office, which wants an analysis of all the possible crimes and
defenses that arise out of this unfortunate situation, some estimation of the strength and
weaknesses of the opposing claim’s various legal issues, and the likely outcome at trial.
The office wants you to take into account the rules set out in the Model Penal Code but
also consider other possible approaches, if appropriate, to the various issues.
