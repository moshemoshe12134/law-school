Question 1
Against

This statute violates the United States Constitution in three distinct ways. First, it
violates the 8" Amendment as incorporated against the states by the 14"" Amendment
because it is cruel and unusual punishment. Second, it violates the equal protection clause
of the 14"" Amendment of the Constitution. Third, it violates the due process clause of the
14° Amendment because it does not properly channel jury discretion.

In looking at whether a punishment is cruel or unusual under the 8"" Amendment
the Supreme Court has looked at the evolving standards of decency that marks the
progress of an evolving society. Here there is a clear societal standard away from such a
statute as no one has been executed for rape since 1964, which is 43 years ago, and the
Supreme Court in 1977 held the death penalty could not be imposed for the rape of an
adult woman. This evolution shows a clear movement of the standard away from
allowing rape to be a capital offense and it would be inappropriate for this Court to allow
such a conviction to move forward when such a clear and long-standing national
consensus on an issue exists.

The statutes since 1995 do not speak to a national consensus on this issue moving
in the other direction. First, only four states have moved in the same direction as
Louisiana while fourty-four have stayed on the sidelines. This does not indicate a national
consensus or an emerging national consensus against the 40-year trend, but instead the
fact that in any large group there will be a few rogue outliers. Secondly, most of these
statutes do not allow the wanton application of the death penalty for such a large swath of

crimes as this statute does. They require multiple convictions on such charges before the


#1, Spring 2007 = Criminal Law — Harcourt & Epstein (06/07/2007) Page 2 of 20

death penalty is allowed. This does not speak to a national consensus that as soon as a
child is raped we should be able to pursue the death penalty, especially in light of the
solid national consensus against capital punishment for non-murder offenses.

Furthermore, no one has been executed for a crime other than murder since the
death penalty was reinstated and this once again marks a progression away from crimes
other than murder being punished capitally. There is therefore a strong national
consensus around a categorical limit on the death penalty to only crimes involving
murder.

Furthermore, the punishment is cruel and unusual because it exceeds the just
desert from the crime and therefore is not a proper retributive purpose. A person who
rapes a child has done a heinous act, but that act is not on par with those deserving capital
punishment and is therefore disproportionate. In Tison, the Supreme Court held that a
person cannot be sentenced to death where they were a participant in a murder under the
felony-murder rule unless they were a major participant in the crime and showed a
reckless disregard for human life. If certain murder convictions are not worthy of death
how can rape be such a crime? In particular, the court in Tison held the reckless disregard
was a critical element of the offense. Here we have no reckless disregard for human life
as there were no threats of death or attempts to kill the victim. It therefore does not meet
the 8" amendment standards laid out by the court.

Additionally, it violates Equal Protection because it subjects clients such as this
one to an increased penalty that other similarly situated offenders would not be guilty of a
lesser offense purely based on the status of their victim. Nor is there any rational

connection between the differences in this case as the crime is of the same violent and


#1, Spring 2007 = Criminal Law — Harcourt & Epstein (06/07/2007) Page 3 of 20

violative nature whether the person is 8 or 15 or 27. This is therefore every much a
violation of equal protection as marital rape exceptions from cases such as Liberta, but a
court in this situation has no choice but to deem the law unconstitutional because
equalizing downward is not an option with the Supreme Court holding that rape is not a
capital offense when committed on an adult.

Finally, the sentencing is unconstitutional under Supreme Court precedents as the
decision not properly channeled within the required constitutional bounds. Instead, the
determination of whether the death penalty should be imposed or not is left to the
complete discretion of the jury under 2(a) of the statute without giving any indications of
how the jury is supposed to make that decision or whether the decision is even required to
be made in a bifurcated proceeding where guilt is established first and then a penalty

phase results. This is therefore a violation of the Due Process clause of the Constitution.

For

This statute is not unconstitutional because it does comply with the requirements
of the 8" and 14" Amendments of the Constitution. First, looking at an evolving standard
of decency from a 40-year time frame is the incorrect perspective as it masks the trend
that has been emerging amongst the several states in the last 12 years in enacting child
rape statutes with three states enacting fairly similar statutes, Georgia enacting an almost
identical statute, and Texas appearing to be interested in joining the trend as well. In that
same time period no state has repealed a child rape law or from the record before us
attempted and failed to establish such a law. This shows the emerging trend is not against

child rape laws, but it is instead is towards the establishment of such laws. This trend is


#1, Spring 2007 = Criminal Law — Harcourt & Epstein (06/07/2007) Page 4 of 20

further supported by the growth of other increased sanctions against sexual predators,
especially against children such as Megan’s Law.

Furthermore, this court should not hold that a national consensus has emerged
only because no one has been executed for a non-murder defense in the last several years.
This only points to the fact that no states have tried such an approach, but silence
amongst the states should not be taken as an emerging trend. Indeed, a central tenant of
our federalist system is to allow experimentation, and therefore to hold that the first
mover in a certain direction is automatically against a national consensus would go
against the structure of the Constitution and precedent in cases such as Ewing where
states were allowed to choose a deterrence rather than a retributivist method of
punishment, which may mete out harsher sentences. Indeed, from a deterrence
perspective this harsher penalty for child rape is required because the likelihood of
detection is lower due to the weakness of children and there manipulability by an adult.
Given the evolving standard and the justification for this law on deterrence grounds it
does not violate the 8"" Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.

It also does not violate the equal protection clause of the Constitution because it
does treat similarly situated individuals similarly. Anyone who rapes a young child is
guilty of a rape-based offense that is subject to capital murder and thus the defendant in
this case is not treated any differently from other similarly situated individuals. If anyone
has an equal protection argument it is the adult women who are raped and have no
recourse to the same capital murder punishment for their rapists much like the Supreme
Court’s holding in McCleskey where it was not the assailant who was the victim of equal

protection violations but instead the black victims who were not getting the similar rates


#1, Spring 2007 = Criminal Law — Harcourt & Epstein (06/07/2007) Page 5 of 20

of death penalty convictions against their murderers. Simply because a state decides to
make a crime more aggravated because it includes certain additional elements should not
render the punishment against the Equal Protection clause. Indeed, one of the core tenants
of allowed capital punishment jurisprudence is that establishing aggravating factors that
qualify an individual for the death penalty is critical to a Constitutional administration of
the death penalty. Here, Louisiana has simply established that the rape of a young child is
an aggravating circumstance.

Finally, the statute does not fall as unconstitutional because it allows unchanneled
discretion in determining whether to mete our the death penalty or not. To adopt such a
view would require that post-Furman/Gregg the only form of guided discretion allowed
would be a weighing statute that clearly laid out aggravating circumstances and required
a balancing of mitigating circumstances. However, the Supreme Court has also approved
of special question channeling and pyramid channeling of discretion in death penalty
cases. The Louisiana statute lays out a pyramid method of channeling discretion. It first
takes all of the cases that are rape, and then it channels that down to a special category of
rape involving a young child which serves as the finding of an aggravating circumstance.
The jury is then allowed complete discretion at the final phase, but this only occurs after
the required channeling has already occurred to such an extent that Due Proces concerns
should no longer factor in; it is not a free-for-all where any felony or any rape charge can

lead to the death penalty at the jury’s sole discretion.

Question 2

Deborah
Attempted Manslaughter

I would first charge Deborah for attempted manslaughter in the first degree based
on the attempt she made to take her husband’s life in the court room. I did not believe a
murder charge was appropriate because she did have the intent to cause the death of
another person, but she was acting under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance
at the time of the crime and therefore a murder conviction would not stick.

The defense will likely argue she did not have the actus reus for the crime at the
time she fired the shots due to the heavily abused prescriptions she was using at the time
and that as such the act can not be considered voluntary which is a requirement for actus
reus under the MPC. By choosing Manslaughter the prosecution has effectively cut off
the other defenses she may have available.

The prosecution will respond that even if she were not acting voluntarily at the
time she took the drugs she was acting voluntarily at the time she chose to abuse the
drugs and therefore as the court stated in Grant that voluntary act can satisfy the
voluntary act requirement and make her liable.

Murder in the Second Degree

As a prosecutor I would also charge Deborah with murder in the second degree
based upon the death of Norris. The charge would be brought under (2) of the NY statute
which requires only requires a depraved indifference to human life and recklessly

engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of death to another person with death


#1, Spring 2007 = Criminal Law — Harcourt & Epstein (06/07/2007) Page 7 of 20

resulting. Entering a courtroom with a loaded gun and opening fire with the hope to kill
would indicate a depraved indifference to human life.

The defense will have three strong claims. First there is a very strong causation
argument as her conduct appears to be very remote from that engaged in and does not
appear to be the natural consequence of her behavior. Second, NY case law on depraved
indifference seems to require more than the depravity of an ordinary individual who
commits murder and here it looks like Deborah is no more depraved than the common
murderer. Third, she was acting under extreme emotional duress due to the trial and thus
should be entitled to a heat of passion defense. Finally, there is a causation problem like
we had in Martin Dyos as it isn’t clear she was the cause of death.

Prosecution will respond that the causation is not a problem under the MPC as she
brought about the same kind of result that she recklessly brought about and there
shouldn’t be any problem with the result being too remote as the ambulance accident
hastened the death and proximate cause does not require that Deborah’s conduct be the
only one leading to death, only an efficient cause and here the combination of the wound
and the spinal injury were both factors in the death so causation is established. Also heat
of passion does not appear to be a defense to (2) and she had depraved indifference by
indiscriminately firing a gun in the court room.

Disorderly Conduct

Virginia

Assault


#1, Spring 2007 = Criminal Law — Harcourt & Epstein (06/07/2007) Page 8 of 20

I would first charge Virginia with assault as she knowingly caused bodily injury
to the officers through her action — and likely purposefully — when she instigated a
physical struggle with them. I would grade it as a misdemeanor.

Virginia would argue she had a justification in the circumstances because she
thought her mother was being assaulted and acted on that assumption.

Prosecution would respond that at best she has only an imperfect excuse and try to
establish that she acted recklessly with a conscious disregard of the substantial risk she
was created as normally police officers do not restrain people in court without good
cause. This would still qualify for assault under even an imperfect defense. Would also
argue that no defense should be available as she resorted to excessive force during the
struggle for the weapon and continued the struggle beyond the time period needed to
protect her mom.

Murder in the Second Degree

I would also charge Virginia with murder in the second degree for the death of
Norris based on (1) of the statute which requires an intent to cause the death of another
person which causes the death of that person or of a third person.

Defense would respond that she lacked the mens rea as she did not have the intent
to kill Norris and at best behaved in a reckless manner by engaging in the struggle for the
gun and that there is no clear indication that she wanted to kill her father so she should
not be liable for an intention on that basis either — we do not want to punish thought
crimes. Further argue there was no intent ala Franklin as the gun went off accidentally
not purposefully. Defense would also want to argue causation was lacking as well

because Anders was an intervening cause of death through the ambulance accident and


#1, Spring 2007 = Criminal Law — Harcourt & Epstein (06/07/2007) Page 9 of 20

that was too remote a consequence to have a bearing on her culpability and it cannot be
established she was the cause of the accident since the death was not from the gunshot
alone.

Prosecution will respond that she did have the mens rea to kill her father as
manifested by her more aggressive struggle to get the gun once she thought about
shooting him in the case, just like in Franklin you could infer the shooting was
intentional when a second shot was fired. It is true she didn’t actually intend to pull the
trigger at the moment she fired the gun, but just because the gun fired earlier than she
desired does not negate causation as it brought about the intended death and was not too
remote or unforeseen. Further, it doesn’t matter that she didn’t intend to kill Norris as
under the statute wanting to kill her father and actually killing Norris is enough. On the
issue of causation the argument will be that the ambulance accident was not an
intervening cause of the death as the death resulted from both the gunshot wound and the
spinal injury and thus Anders just hastened the time of death which is not enough to cut
off causation and thus not an unforeseen result. As for the Martin Dyos problem, this is
not a case where it isn’t clear what caused the death, it is instead a case where there were
too causes of death interacting with each other to hasten the demise and thus there is no

Martin Dyos problem.

Arthur
Vehicular Manslaughter

I would also charge Arthur with vehicular manslaughter in the death of Norris.


#1, Spring 2007 = Criminal Law — Harcourt & Epstein (06/07/2007) Page 10 of 20

Defense will argue that vehicular manslaughter requires criminal negligence and that
Arthur did not act with criminal negligence as he did not grossly deviate from the proper
standard of care. Will also make the same causation arguments that have been made
several times. Also possibly a qualified immunity defense, but don’t know enough about
the law to really assess it.

Prosecution will respond that he did have the requisite mens rea as driving drunk,
particularly when that driving involves an ambulance which is likely to have to proceed
at high speeds. Furthremore, statute explicitly says causing the death of another by
violation of drunk-driving provision of the traffic law is sufficient to constitute vehicular
manslaughter and that is exactly what happened here. Causation argument responses will

be the same as were made for the other two defendants.

Macon

A really aggressive prosecutor may also attempt to charge Macon with reckless
endangerment for his behavior in continuing to struggle for the gun. However, I would be
unlikely to bring such charges since normally an officer should be justified in struggling
to keep his gun, especially where he cannot reason with an assailant as normally that
would be the lesser-evils choice. If there were a statute charging an officer for negligence
in carrying out his duties by protecting his gun, etc., however I would certainly charge for

that.


#1, Spring 2007 = Criminal Law — Harcourt & Epstein (06/07/2007) Page 11 of 20

Question 3

The first offense committed was the conspiracy entered into by Murphy,
Blackmark, Jackal, and Tuff. Sweethart would not be charged as she was not part of the
agreement. There is clearly an agreement between Murphy and Tuff and between
Murphy, Blackmark, and Jackal which satisfies the requirement of an agreement between
the parties as required by both common law and the MPC. The overt act requirement is
also satisfied as the parties broke into the house and committed the crimes as they had a
mutual understanding of what their goal was. Tuff will argue he is only in a conspiracy
with Murphy because he did not know that Murphy was seeking out conspiracy with
others, although a jury may reasonably infer that when you ask someone to commit a
larceny of this sort they will seek out other conspirators so you are in conspiracy whether
you know their identity or not (MPC 5.05(2)). Murphy will also attempt to defend by
arguing duress although his opportunities to escape, the lack of an imminent harm, and
his potentially reckless behavior in getting him into the situation will all work against him
— discussed more in next paragraph.

The second offense that appears to have been committed is an attempted larceny by
Murphy and Jackal. Larceny at common law required concurrent trespassory taking and
carrying away of property from the possession of the other with the intent to permanently
deprive the owner of the property. Establishing that both of these men acted with that
purpose is clearly established by their conduct. They would also be charged under MPC
223.2(1) of theft by unlawful taking if they had been successful. To establish attempt
liability this specific intent for the crime is required. MPC also requires they purposely do

anything that would be a substantial step as a mens rea element, but as discussed below


#1, Spring 2007 = Criminal Law — Harcourt & Epstein (06/07/2007) Page 12 of 20

this is clearly satisfied. They would also meet the requirements of attempt at both
common law under the last act standard and the MPC’s substantial step standard as they
had undertaken the last possible step they could to perfect the crime, but because the
goods had in fact been moved they were thwarted in this attempt by intervention of
circumstances beyond their control. Murphy will attempt to defend himself by claiming
he was acting under Duress. Federal law requires an imminent threat and no reasonable
opportunity to escape, however, but he waited three days while he was not monitored to
make his move which seems to vitiate these requirements of duress, but ultimately it will
be a jury question because of the conflicting precedent of Contento-Pachon which seems
to say in similar circumstances duress is appropriate. Under the MPC, all that is required
is a reasonable man of ordinary firmness would be unable to resist, which is a jury
question. As is the question of whether the defense is even available under MPC 2.09(2)
as he potentially recklessly placed himself in the dangerous situation by racking up the
gambling debts.

Blackmark can also be charged with attempted larceny under the MPC 5.01(3)
because he engaged in conduct designed to aid Murphy and Jackal commit the crime
even if they ultimately were not successful. He had the necessary mens rea for complicity
because he purposefully gave aid by acting as the lookout and also shared the
perpretrator’s intention of carrying out the crime with its result which is enough under
both the MPC and most other statutory schemes. Furthermore, his intended aid did act to
the help of the design as thanks to his lookout abilities they were able to escape from the

scene of their attempted robbery.


#1, Spring 2007 = Criminal Law — Harcourt & Epstein (06/07/2007) Page 13 of 20

A prosecutor could also charge Sweetheart with complicity in the offense on the
same grounds as Blackmark, but it is unlikely to be successful and not worth the effort.
Her behavior appears even weaker than that of the defendant in Beeman. She knew she
was giving information to Murphy, but she did not know it would have a facilitative
effect in carrying out the crime — although she was criminally negligent for sure.
Furthermore, she did not share the intent of the perpetrators in carrying out the offense.

Both Murphy and Tuff could also be charged with solicitation at common law as
they both convinced individuals to engage in crimes with the intent that they engage in
such crimes. Tuff’s was through command while Murphy’s was through persuasion but
that does not make a difference under either the MPC or the cases we studied. They
would both thus be liable for the same grade as if the larceny had been successful due to
our concerns about gains through trade. Murphy will once again make a duress defense
claim, but it is very unlikely to succeed for the reasons already discussed above.

Murphy and Jackal would also be guilty of burglary there was a breaking and
entering into a house at night, with the intent to commit a felony therein when they forced
the door open. The felony was larceny which does not run into the Colvin problems
because larceny does not double-count as both the necessary illegal entry and the
independent crime element. At federal law, all of the co-conspirators would be guilty as
well under Pinkerton as breaking and entering into a dwelling was a natural and
foreseeable consequence of the particular conspiracy entered into in this case.

This brings us to the killing of Wilson by Jackal which I will classify as murder
under the MPC as it was done purposefully. Jackal is clearly guilty and his only defenses

would be to somehow argue his behavior was reckless rather than purposeful and get the


#1, Spring 2007 = Criminal Law — Harcourt & Epstein (06/07/2007) Page 14 of 20

charged knocked down to manslaughter. Under federal law, all of the co-conspirators
would be in trouble via the Pinkerton rule because the act was done in furtherance of the
conspiracy and feds are very generous in finding the reasonable nexus. The only
argument they would have is that the goals of the conspiracy had been completed when
the larceny failed and thus the conspiracy ceased to exist, however since they were in the
process of escaping and still communicating with one another I think it is a loser. They
could also argue it was not foreseeable due to the repeated requests for no rough stuff by
Murphy, but the court in A/varez seemed to think the nature of the crime made it obvious
a firearm would be brought and the same would apply to this case. Blackmark could also
try to defend himself by stating he removed himself from the conspiracy and withdrew.
However, he did not inform his co-conspirators of the withdrawal or actually inform law
enforcement of the conspiracy before the murder, plus it seems unlikely we should give
him credit for withdrawal when he only did so because apprehension was imminent.
Under the MPC everyone in the conspiracy would be able to get off of any criminal
charges because the MPC requires they share the mens rea for the act done in furtherance
of the conspiracy, and here there is no evidence establishing they did, and Murphy
certainly did not. Tuff will also try to defend by saying he was only in a conspiracy with
Murphy and thus could not be liable for Jackal’s conduct, but I do not find the argument
persuasive as he had to know others would be brought in to pull off the heist.

Finally there is the liability for OnGard. Under the MPC they are clearly not liable
for any crimes as they had a policy that was repeatedly drilled into employees that they
were not to give anyone else access to the files. And MPC 2.07(1)© requires the offense

be authorized, requested, commanded, performed or recklessly tolerated by the board of


#1, Spring 2007 = Criminal Law — Harcourt & Epstein (06/07/2007) Page 15 of 20

directors or high managerial agent which is not the case here, nor is there any statute that
would make them liable under any other provision of 2.07. A court that followed the
standard of Hilton would be more likely to find them guilty as there was not actual
oversight, but it still seems unlikely as there is no real way to twist this into being
motivated by profits.

If a court does buy the duress defense of Murphy, it will not transfer to any of his
co-conspirators and act as a defense for them as it is a personal excuse which does not
transfer for complicity or conspiracy. Finally, Murphy seems to be guilty of bribery for
leaving the $20 on the desk, although I am not so certain about the law of bribery as to
have a real good assessment of its likelihood of success. Tuff would then be guilty as part
of the conspiracy since it was an act in furtherance — although it is dicier under the MPC
because of its enhanced mens rea requirements — but Blackmark and Jackal would not as
it was an act conducted before they joined the conspiracy.

Tuff also appears guilty of MPC 212.5 criminal coercion for his solicitation behavior.


#1, Spring 2007 = Criminal Law — Harcourt & Epstein (06/07/2007) Page 16 of 20

Question 4

The most substantial and important crime committed is the aggravated assault
engaged in by Hapless when he repeatedly stabbed Norwood. He clearly meets the actus
reus requirement and appears to possess the mens rea as well since he admitted that he
was acting in self-defense which one should only admit to once the actus reus and mens
rea are present — of course he is mentally ill so maybe we shouldn’t hold that against him.
Hapless’ first defense will be that he did act in self-defense. However, this is a very weak
claim since he acted pre-emptively before there was any threat to him since Norwood did
not even know he was present. In most jurisdictions this would mean no such defense
instruction should be given as we saw in the Goetz case because the behavior was not
reasonable under the circumstances. However, the MPC allows an imperfect justification
such that Norwood could be convicted based on his negligent or reckless mens rea. I
would tend to classify his behavior as reckless as it seems to show a conscious disregard
for the unnecessary risk, but it is ultimately a jury question; if reckless he is still
convicted. He was certainly reckless in continuing the attack after Norwood was subdued
by several wounds and therefore not entitled to a justification on that basis as the use of
deadly force was not warranted.

His second defense will be that he is NGI, which would only be established after
the guilt phase. The MPC standard is one where the person can lack volitional control or
the ability to tell the difference between right-and-wrong without being held liable,
although federal law and many states have gone back to M’Naghten which does not allow

NGI except where the person does not understand the criminality or wrongfulness of their


#1, Spring 2007 = Criminal Law — Harcourt & Epstein (06/07/2007) Page 17 of 20

acts. Under this higher standard it is unlikely Hapless could get off as he seemed to know
his act was wrong and we have no evidence he thought his behavior was ‘right’.

We therefore turn to the MPC standard which as a pre-requisite requires an
organic basis for the defect, which we have in this case because he has been diagnosed
with paranoia. The argument between the prosecution and defense witnesses is the
standard arguments we hear in cases such as this, especially the defense argument that he
just snaps like we saw in the ‘Whoosh Whoosh’ case; I’m surprised they didn’t mention
means rational but ends crazy argument as that is another defense favorite. However, in
this case the evidence seems to support a NGI finding due to his past history of outbreaks
which fit the pattern we see in this case, particularly the assault of the neighbor, as well
as his diagnosis prior to this outburst. This all makes about as strong of a volitional case
for NGI as one will find, although obviously the ultimate decision will be up to the jury.
One potential complication is medication which can apparently control his behavior.
Much like an epileptic who drives a car or a person who knows they are violent when
drunk a court may find that NGI cannot be a valid defense because he was liable for the
crime since he did not take his medication; however this seems extremely harsh. A
defense of tangible property is also unavailable due to the excessive nature of the attack
and that the MPC requires possession it appears, which Norwood did not have.

There is also a charge of criminal mischief that could be levied against Norwood
under the MPC for his behavior in attempting to get into the house. Norwood would
defend himself under MPC 3.06 by claiming he was justified in attempting to retake
tangible movable property since he believes he is acting on behalf of one who was

unlawfully disposed of the property. However, this defense is likely to fail because it was


#1, Spring 2007 = Criminal Law — Harcourt & Epstein (06/07/2007) Page 18 of 20

not done immediately or on fresh pursuit after such dispossession and the damage to the
property appears to be excessive damage to the property especially considering the
relative value of the property.

Dean can also be charged under MPC 223.5 for theft of lost, mislaid, etc. property
because he appears to have the purpose of depriving the owner of the property of it and is
certainly not taking reasonable measures to restore the property to the person entitled to it
thanks to his refusal open the door and his attempt to get a baseball bat. He doesn’t
appear to have good defenses as damage to my property doesn’t entitle me to theft of
yours.

Dean could also be charged with solicitation under the MPC for his screaming as
it is conceivable he was encourgaging Hapless to assist him in making such a declaration,
which would qualify under the MPC. However, this appears to be a weak claim as he
doesn’t appear to have the mens rea of solicitation which is with the purpose of doing so,
although he certainly has the mens rea for the substantive crime. A better charge would
therefore be reckless endangerment as he yelled the statement in the presence of an
individual who he knew was mentally unstable — he cannot be excused even if Hapless is
as excuses such as insanity due not transfer — and had a history of assault. This would
seem to meet the requirements of reckless behavior which places the person in danger of
death or serious bodily injury.

Under the MPC Dean could also be charged with aggravated assault as all it
requires it attempting to cause or purposefully or knowingly causing bodily injury to
another with a deadly weapon. The MPC also requires a substantial step which it defines

as something strongly corroborative of the criminal intent. Here the statements followed


#1, Spring 2007 = Criminal Law — Harcourt & Epstein (06/07/2007) Page 19 of 20

up by the seeking out of a baseball bat appear to be strongly corroborative of an intent to
inflict bodily harm with a dangerous weapon, which would seem to constitute an attempt
which would therefore qualify for aggravated assault. However, under the common law
which had the last act requirement this would not be okay as this is clearly not the last act
so the charge could not stand.

Dean may argue he is justified in attempting to protect his property due to the
conduct being engaged in by Norwood. However it will fail as he made no request for
Norwood to desist and deadly force for property is only justified if Dean thinks Norwood
attempts to burglarize his property through deadly force or substantial bodily injury,
which appears to be wholly lacking in this case.

Finally, there is Susan who could be charged with solicitation of Norwood to
engage in the criminal acts through her statement that he should do whatever it takes,
which likely would include breaking the door down. Her main defense would be that she
didn’t solicit a specific crime and thus it would be difficult to find what to charge her
with soliciting other than getting her daughter’s possessions back through even some
rough-and-tumble means.

This is a problem, but that is why the MPC includes complicity as well. She
certainly seems to be an accomplice under 2.06 because she seemed to act with the
purpose of promoting or facilitating Norwood’s behavior and criminal mischief only
requires conscious disregard of a substantial risk that there would be damage to property,
which she seems to have established as what else could you expect from someone using
whatever it takes to get property back that is on another’s land? This will ultimately be a

jury question as recklessness is based on a subjective standard and she say that while an


#1, Spring 2007 = Criminal Law — Harcourt & Epstein (06/07/2007) Page 20 of 20

ordinary person would understand the risk they are creating she did not given her
circumstances — perhaps the family is very mild mannered and whatever it takes means

swearing?

There may also be a potential attempted burglary charge against Norwood because he
seems to have with the purpose of committing burglary tried to break into the house, but
was unsuccessful due to the attack. Defense is that he didn’t intend to commit any illegal
act on the inside, although his threat to break down the furniture seems to hurt this

defense. He couldn’t be convicted at common law as crime was not attempted at night.
