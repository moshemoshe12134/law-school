la. Memorandum opposed to the statute.

The 8" amendment of the Constitution requires that the government impose no cruel and
unusual punishments. This has been incorporated to the states through the 14"
amendment. In Coker v. Georgia the Supreme Court held that there could be no death
penalty for the rape of an adult woman. This is based on the belief that the 8"
amendment requires proportionality between the offense and the punishment. In Solem v.
Helm the court held that proportionality is tested by three things: a balancing of the
gravity of the offense with the harshness of the penalty, punishment of other criminals in
the state, and punishment of similar criminals in other states. No one has been executed
for rape since the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. This Louisiana
law is one of two laws being applied in the country, which allows for execution on a
single count of rape. This statute expands on that law by increasing the victims age from
10 to 13. This indicates that other jurisdictions do not believe that the death penalty is
proportionate to a single count of rape regardless of the victim. This is disproportionate
compared to other states and therefore unconstitutional under the 8" amendment. Also,
recidivist history is a consideration for the courts in proportionality (Ewing). This statute
allows for the death penalty on the first rape conviction and does take into consideration
past conduct good or bad. This is an important consideration in the proportionality of a
sentence based on both retributionist ideas (punishing bad people) and ideas of
incapacitation (keeping bad people off the streets).

This statute also violates the defendants 14" amendment rights under the due process
clause. Due process in part requires specificity in a statute so that the defendant can
know how to conduct himself to avoid the forbidden conduct. This statute contains no
mens rea. This statute only requires the actus reus of intercourse with the attendant
circumstance that there was no consent solely based on age of the victim or other
circumstances. There is not even a requirement of force, which, accompanied by non
consent, might indicate implied intent. In this case, the statute implies a strict liability
offense with regard to non consent. There is not even a negligence requirement put into
the statute. If a reasonable person would think that this person was older and consenting,
the defendant would still be punished with life imprisonment at hard labor or death. This
does not allow the defendant to adjust his conduct to avoid violating the statute. We must
look at the requirements of specificity ex ante before the violation. This defendant
clearly knew the age of the victim. However, this statute may ensnare another defendant
who reasonably believes the victim is of the proper age and is consenting. The MPC 2.05
states that when the State imposes even partial strict liability the criminal offense may
only be punished as a violation. Far from being only a fine, this statute provides for
lifetime hard labor or death. The court in Morissett v. United States looked to the
common law to discover the mens rea for the attendant circumstance that the casings
were government property. The common law required force plus lack of consent and
often some level of resistance as an evidentiary matter. The mens rea used in most cases
was at least negligence (Fisher) and sometimes intent (Brown). This statute should meet
at least the mens rea of negligence, which is quite a step down from the common law.
This is because a strict liability offense provides no notice of violation. This statute also

violates the 14"" amendment in that it gives no guidance for juries to determine whether
hard labor or death is the proper penalty, allowing arbitrariness which Furman struck
down. Due process forbids arbitrary application of laws.

1b. Memorandum in favor of the statute.

Justices Thomas and Scalia have held that the 8"" amendment does not require a
proportionality review. Therefore, under this idea the statute need not establish a penalty
proportionate to the crime. However, even if it does need to be proportionate, this statute
meets that requirement. It only allows a fixed sentence of hard labor or death for rape of
victims who are children. Society considers these crimes especially heinous, and the
balancing of the offense with the penalty shows they are comparable. Other states
including Montana, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Georgia have recognized that the
rape of children is a more serious penalty for which death might be appropriate.

This statute does allow the defendant to conform his conduct to avoid violating the law
and is therefore not against due process. This statute requires a voluntary act of sexual
intercourse in order to be guilty. The fact that mistaking the age of the victim is no
excuse is not grounds for striking down the law. In Dillard, the court held that offenses
designed to protect public safety are punishable despite the absence of culpability or
criminal intent. This encourages defendants to be more careful when doing certain acts.
In Dillard, that was carrying a gun; in this case the government wants to protect children
by encouraging people to be more cautious before engaging in sexual intercourse. The
fact that this statute has no requirement of force or explicit mens rea is not problematic.
In Smith, the court affirmed a defendant’s conviction when there was no force or specific
intent. It held that intent to perform the physical acts plus non-consent is sufficient for a
rape conviction. In .7.S., the court held that the only force required was penetration
and that in the absence of affirmative consent, this was enough to constitute rape. In
neither of these cases was the lack of specific mens rea for the defendant a problem.
Consent was the main issue. This Louisiana statute allows a defendant to conform his
behavior by avoiding intercourse unless he knows the age of the victim. It provides
sufficient notice to the defendant and does not violate the 14" amendment. Also, the lack
of guidance for the jury may not be problematic. This statute does not prohibit the judge
from issuing instructions that the jurors should balance aggravating and mitigating
circumstances. This is not a mandatory death sentence and the jury can be guided by the
judge. Therefore, it is not arbitrary in its administration.

2.1) As the prosecutor I would charge Deborah with attempted murder in the second
degree under NYPC sect. 125.25. It is clear that she had the intent to cause the death of
her ex-husband. I could not prosecute under NYPC sect. 125.27 (v) because while the
victim was a witness to a crime, she was not killing him to prevent his testimony. I
would also prosecute her with assault under MPC 211.1 (1b) She negligently caused
bodily injury to the defense counsel with a deadly weapon. I would also charge her
reckless endangerment under MPC 211.2 because she recklessly endangered those in the
court room by firing her gun.

I would charge Virginia with attempted second degree murder for her attempt to kill her
step-father. She intended to kill him and took the substantial step of struggling for the
gun. In the alternative, I might charge her with attempted voluntary manslaughter. She
was possibly under extreme emotional disturbance based on the trial of her step-father
and the belief that the marshals were attacking her mother. I would also charge her with
manslaughter in the first degree for the death of Nick Norris (NYPC 125.20). She was
intending to cause serious physical injury do her step-father when she caused the death of
a third person, Nick, under the emotional distress of the struggle. In the alternative, I
might charge her with manslaughter in the second degree (NYPC 125.15) because
struggling for a gun is reckless behavior which caused the death of Nick Norris (at least
in combination with the car accident). I could not charge her with murder in the first
degree under NYPC 125.27 (ii) because while she shot a peace officer, he was not her
intended victim.

I would charge Arthur with vehicular manslaughter in the Second Degree (NYPC
125.12). He was criminally negligent in driving an ambulance drunk which a reasonable
person would not do. By operating the vehicle drunk, he caused Nick’s death (at least in
combination with the gun shot wound.)

I would also charge the negligent driver with criminally negligent homicide (NYPC
125.10) as his negligent driving cause Nick’s death.

(2) As the public defender for Deborah I would argue that she was under extreme
emotional distress at the time because she had been listening to vivid descriptions of her
ex-husband’s rape of her daughter. A reasonable person in her situation would suffer a
similar disturbance. In Berry, the court established that, at least under their jurisdiction’s
law, the extreme emotional disturbance defense is available when the disturbance has
been ongoing even if it may not be particularly intense at that moment. Similarly, the
trial of the rape has assumedly been ongoing and severely disturbing. This would lower
attempted second degree murder to attempted voluntary manslaughter. I would also
argue her addiction to prescription drugs made the act non-voluntary. Voluntariness is
required by MPC 2.01.

Defending Virginia I would argue that she abandoned her attempt immediately after
considering the idea and was struggling with the gun to protect herself in self-defense. I

would also argue for extreme emotional disturbance to make sure that the charge of
second degree murder was lowered to manslaughter in the first degree. Her self-defense
argument (MPC 3.04 & 3.05) would also counter the charge of manslaughter in the
second degree as she did not act recklessly in struggling for the gun. She was attempting
to defend herself and her mother. Also, I would argue that there is not sufficient
causation in the death of Nick Norris. The medical examiner stated that the cause of
death was the compound effect of the two injuries. In Regina v. Martin Dyos, the court
held that because there was a second likely cause of the death they could not establish
causation to convict MD. In this case, there are two causes of the death, the gun shot and
the broken neck. Even under the simple preponderance of evidence rule used in torts,
neither of these causes are necessarily more than fifty percent responsible. I would argue
as the defense that there is not sufficient causation and she should be acquitted on any
charges for Nick’s death.

I would use the same argument for Arthur and the negligent driver that causation has not
been established. Also, defending Arthur I would argue that his operating the vehicle
drunk was not the cause of Nick’s death in another way. There was a negligent driver in
the road who caused Arthur to swerve causing the accident. Thus, under NYPC 125.12
he is not responsible.

(3) Responding to Deborah’s defenses I would argue that the model penal code should
not be interpreted to go against the common law unnecessarily. The common law
required immediate provocation. This seems like a reasonable interpretation of extreme
emotional disturbance. The term extreme points to an immediate effect. Also, even if the
disturbance does not need to be immediate, the emotional distress does not necessarily
meet a reasonability requirement even under the more subjective standard of the MPC.
This is particularly true because she formed the plan after abusing prescription drugs and
continued using them before committing the act. Drug abuse is not considered in the
reasonable person calculus, and it seems that this was a major part of her decision.
Therefore, her actions may not be considered reasonable. Also, the fact that she planned
the event the night before cuts against her argument of extreme emotional distress. She
had time to come up with a plan and deliberate (Watson). Finally, drug abuse is not a
defense to the voluntary requirement because courts have held that the voluntary aspect is
the drug abuse (Powell v. Texas).This is not a status problem because it criminalizes the
act of shooting not the addiction that caused it.

Responding to Virginia’s defenses, I would first argue that she had never abandoned the
attempt because she continued to struggle for the gun. Second, I would argue against the
self-defense claim because she struggled with the marshal and heard him tell her that he
was a marshal trying to subdue a suspect. MPC 3.04 does allow for resisting an arrest,
whether or not valid. This seems to preclude tackling a marshal to keep him from your
mother. Also, this cuts against extreme emotional disturbance claims because she had the
time to hear his explanation and deliberate on what to do (Watson). Also, against her
self-defense claim, she was reckless in thinking this was valid self-defense after hearing

Epstein & Harcourt

he was a marshal. Thus, any crime requiring only recklessness (e.g. second degree
manslaughter) are still applicable as she mistakenly formed her belief in self-defense.
Finally, on the issue of causation between the gun shot and the accident, I would argue
that either injury was a but-for cause. Without either injury he would not have died. This
may seem to cut against charging them, but either one could foreseeably cause death. We
do not want to allow defendants to collude and act together to avoid prosecution. It may
seem that neither one would have killed him according to the report, but this is unclear
since both occurred. I would argue but for causation and foreseeability establish the
necessary causation to charge them. If not, I would charge Virginia with assault and
Arthur with drunk driving and reckless endangerment.

Responding to Arthur’s other defense I would argue that his drunk driving, while not the
sole cause of the accident, was the efficient cause under Rhoades. If he had been sober,
he could have avoided the accident and not injured Nick fatally. Also, he had an extra
duty as an ambulance driver not to drink while on the job. This might be a contractual
duty with the hospital or a voluntary assumption of duty which prevents other from
bringing him to the hospital (Jones).

3. I could charge Sweetheart with complicity. She did give aid to Murphy in his
attempted theft. This seems like a very weak case because theft requires purpose (MPC
233.2). Attempt requires two different mens reas: the requisite mens rea of the crime and
intent to aid the person in committing the crime. Sweetheart may have intended to give
the file to Murphy but she was at best negligent in bringing about the crime. She had no
knowledge, and only perhaps was unreasonable in handing the form to a known gambler,
which does not meet the requisite attempt for theft.

I would charge Tuff with extortion. He threatened bodily injury to Murphy if he did not
pay money (MPC 223.4). Tuff might argue that he was rightfully owed the money for a
loan. However, under MPC 223.4 this is not available as an affirmative defense if the
defendant threatened bodily injury. This seems like a very strong case. I would also
prosecute Tuff for solicitation because he was the one who suggested that Murphy steal
from one of his security clients. MPC 5.02 defines solicitation as commanding
encouraging or requesting that another person commit a crime. This seems like a very
strong case as well.

Based on the extortion, Murphy may try to argue he was justified in all of his offenses
based on duress. However, the MPC 2.09 does not allow this defense if the actor
“recklessly placed himself in a situation in which is was probable that he would be
subjected to duress. This was upheld in Willams v. State where the defendant owed drug
dealers money and robbed someone to pay them back. Murphy gambled and got money
from a loan shark who then threatened him for the money. This is a clear example of
recklessly placing yourself in that position.

I could charge Murphy, Jackal, and Blackmark with conspiracy to commit theft (MPC
5.03). They all agreed to aid each other in committing the crime. They also performed
an overt act by driving to the house. The conspiracy to commit theft charge seems likely
to win. Two important questions come up with this charge. First, was Tuff a part of the
conspiracy? Griffin v. State established that a conspiracy may be inferred from a
development and a choreography of circumstances. In this case, Tuff was standing
outside the house when they were stealing from the safe. This makes it appear that he
was a part of the conspiracy despite the fact that the testimony does not seem to indicate
that he was in the agreement. Under Lauria, Tuff meets the requirements of mens rea for
conspiracy as he clearly had knowledge of the conspiracy based on his threatening call
and he had a stake in the venture. Based on these reasons the charge against Tuff for
conspiracy to commit theft seems likely to win. Tuff did not abandon the conspiracy
based on leaving the house because it was not a voluntary abandonment; it was based on
the presence of the police. Second, did Blackmark sufficiently abandon the conspiracy to
not be charged? Blackmark attempted to call 911 and thus attempted to thwart the
conspiracy (MPC 5.03 (6)), but he failed to do so. Normally, defendants cannot get out
of a conduct that they already put into motion. It seems that here Blackmark cannot
avoid liability for the attempted theft based on a failed call to 911. However, his


Criminal Law
Epstein & Harcourt

abandonment of criminal purpose will excuse him from any charges of conspiracy or
complicity to kill a police officer.

Jackal can certainly be charged with murder of a police officer, which is a strict liability
offense in regards to the identity of the victim (Feola). He would be held responsible for
killing a police officer regardless of the fact that the officer was in plain clothes. There is
a question as to whether Murphy can be charged with conspiracy to commit murder of a
police officer. Under the common law Pinkerton rule the members of a conspiracy can
be held responsible for any additional offense that was reasonable foreseeable. The
model penal code does away with this rule and only holds a conspirator responsible for
the offenses to which he agreed. If Illinois follows the MPC on this, we cannot charge
Murphy with this conspiracy. If it follows the Pinkerton rule, murder seems to be
possibly foreseeable in a situation of breaking and entering. Murphy can argue that he
did not know that anyone had a gun. I could instead charge Murphy under the felony
murder rule MPC 210.2(2b). This murder was committed in the commission of burglary
which allows a presumption of recklessness. Felony murder uses a foreseeable standard.
If the murder was foreseeable the felons are responsible (People v. Stamp).

I would charge all those involved in the conspiracy to commit theft with attempted theft.
State v. Verive established that attempt and conspiracy need not merge if there is a
substantial step for an attempt that is different from the over act required for conspiracy.
I could define their overt act for conspiracy as driving to the house and the substantial
step in attempted theft as breaking into the safe in order to charge them with both
conspiracy and attempted theft. Under the MPC’s substantial step requirement, opening
the safe certainly meets the requirement (MPC 5.01(2)). Under the common law last act
requirement, they also would be guilty because they took the papers out of the safe. It
was pure bad luck that the papers contained no money. Because their acts meet the
requirements of both doctrines, it is a strong case for attempted theft.

I could also charge Murphy, Blackman, and Jackal with complicity to commit theft.
They all had the mens rea for theft of purpose and acted to aid each other. However,
charging them with this in addition to conspiracy and attempted theft would be overkill
and might be unsuccessful as the evidence required for the other two might preclude a
charge of complicity.

I would also charge all those involved in the conspiracy with burglary. Burglary is
defined as breaking into a building with the purpose of committing a felony. This seems
likely to be very successful.

In prosecuting OnGard, we could not charge them under MPC 2.07 for the acts of
Sweetheart in giving the form to Murphy. Sweetheart is not a high managerial agent nor
does the theft statute assumedly mention corporate liability. However, under common
law a corporation can be liable for the actions of its agents acting within the scope of
their employment. To be within the scope of their employment it must be, at least in part,


Criminal Law
Epstein & Harcourt
#2, Spring 2007

in furtherance of the corporations business interests (Christy Pontiac-GMC, Inc.) This
can even be the case when the corporations specifically tells the agent not to do such
conduct (Hilton Hotels Corp.), which OnGard did when it told Sweetheart not to give
anyone access to files without cause. This seems like a weak case against OnGard
regardless because giving files to an ex-employee could not possibly be interpreted as
being in furtherance of their interests, and they specifically opposed it. OnGard cannot
be charged with gambling because that is a personal aberration of an employee not done
in their furtherance (Christy Pontiac-GMC, Inc.). Nor could they be charged with
attempted theft and burglary for the actions of an ex-employee.

4. I would probably only charge the teenagers the fine for playing ball in a restricted
area. I might charge Rosie with criminal mischief MPS 220.03 for recklessly tampering
with tangible property and endangering property. The kids knew that balls tended to
break windows and thus hitting a homerun was reckless behavior. The kids could argue
that they did not directly tamper with tangible property of the victim and this does not
therefore fit criminal mischief. This requires statutory interpretation, which it seems
would indicate that breaking windows is tampering with property. Also, they could argue
they did not consciously disregard the risks to other houses. Given the history of broken
windows and the sign outside, an argument that it was not reckless would be weak. It
seems that the criminal mischief claim is likely to win.

I might charge Susan with solicitation of assault and battery because she asked Ned to
“do what it takes” to get the ball back and to be “prepared for trouble.” The MPC 3.06
does not allow deadly force to regain property. It also encourages people to turn to the
courts first, if possible. Using force outside of these circumstances would be assault and
battery, and she asked him to do what it takes. This might include force above and
beyond the allowances. Susan can argue that she did not solicit a crime and it could not
be reasonably interpreted as asking him to commit assault and battery. Solicitation need
not be precise because criminals tend to be secretive. However, this seems like probably
a weak case for the prosecution, as she did mention any physical harm whatsoever.

Ned could certainly be charged with criminal mischief for banging the tin lid on the
porch and causing damage to the property. He purposely caused property damage, and
this seems like a sure winner. I could also charge him with terroristic threats MPC 211.3,
which defines the offence as threatening to commit any act of violence with the intent to
terrorize another. Ned could counter that damaging furniture is not a crime of violence.
This would require statutory interpretation, and it seems likely that Ned will win this as it
is probably a statute aimed at physical violence towards persons.

I might try to charge Dean with attempted assault and battery when he went to get the bat
to frighten Ned. Dean can argue that walking towards the bat was simply preparation and
not a substantial step and therefore he could not be held liable. Also, he may have only
intended to frighten him and not to harm him. In that case perhaps I could charge him
with attempted terroristic threats. Again, there is the substantial step problem, so I will
probably lose.

The main charges would be for Hapless. I would want to charge him with attempted
murder or attempted voluntary manslaughter. This depends on whether there was
extreme emotional disturbance at the time. Hapless will counter two things. One, he will
argue self-defense. He heard banging outside of his house, saw his uncle in a rage and
ran outside with a knife. He said that he believed he needed to defend himself. Hapless
was mistaken in his belief and therefore if he was reckless or negligent in forming that
belief he could be charged with reckless or negligent offenses. However, as established
in Lyerla, you can not attempt a crime that is done recklessly or negligently. Thus, if he


Criminal Law
Epstein & Harcourt
#2, Spring 2007
Page 10 of 10

genuinely believed he needed to defend himself he might be able to get off for these
charges. In which case I would charge him with assault. Assault can be committed
recklessly and negligently with a deadly weapon under MPC 211.1.

Hapless’s attorney will also argue that he is mentally insane. There have been different
standards of insanity throughout the development of criminal law. The old standard, the
M’Naughten rule allowed an insanity defense if the person (1) did not know the nature
and quality of the act or (2) did not know right from wrong. This rule was broadened to
include the irresistible impulse rule, which allowed a defense if the person acted from an
irresistible and uncontrollable impulse, lost the power to choose between right and
wrong, and her will had been involuntarily destroyed. This sort of defense would be used
when someone “just snapped.” The Durham rule allowed an insanity defense if the
action was a product of a mental disease or defect. Finally, the MPC has developed the
form of the ALI rule which allows the defense if the person cannot appreciate right from
wrong or is unable to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law as a result of a
mental disease or defect.

Hapless was diagnosed with paranoia. He alternated between bizarre behavior, outbursts,
and passivity. He assaulted a neighbor two years prior. Hapless went into a sudden
outbursts at the time he stabbed Ned. However, shortly after at the station, he acted calm
and explained his actions as self-defense. There is conflicting testimony about whether
Hapless is sane or not. It seems that Peter Parker is testifying that his ability to articulate
proper self-defense is meant to point out that he understands right from wrong and
therefore does not get the protection of the M’Naughten rule or the cognitive part of the
MPC. He is also arguing that Hapless’s understanding of self-defense indicates that he
can control his behavior. Doctor Maroney is testifying that Hapless has something like a
psychotic break when he perceives something as threatening. Hapless’s case seems
similar to the case of Andrew Goldstein, a very intelligent man, who could explain his
behavior afterwards, but described it as something like blanking out. Goldstein would be
considered insane under the MPC because he was unable to conform his behavior and
under the irresistible test based on his blanking out periods. Similarly, it seems that
Hapless is unable to conform his behavior during his periods even if he can describe them
afterwards. He may have sounded clear at the station, but at the time of the assault he
sounded very childish, saying, “Go away you bad man from my house.” This indicated a
break in his mentality between the two periods. It may be tempting to say that he is
falsifying these breaks in the same way that Dr. Rader testified that Smith was pretending
in Smith v. State. Two other psychologists argued that Smith could not conform his
behavior. This conclusion seems more reasonable for both Smith and Hapless based on
their diagnoses and very bizarre behavior. Given that there is an organic cause
(diagnosed paranoia), Hapless seems to genuinely be losing his ability to control his
behavior. His clarity at times does not negate his insanity which has twice manifested
itself as physical harm to others. Under the MPC and the irresistible impulse test Hapless
will probably be found insane and be sent to a mental institution instead of prison.
