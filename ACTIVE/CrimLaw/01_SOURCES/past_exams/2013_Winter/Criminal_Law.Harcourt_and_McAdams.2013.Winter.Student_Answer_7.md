(a) Homicide

I will first address how I think a utilitarian - one favoring deterrence, incapacitation, or
rehabilitation - would like to redefine homicide. Then, I will discuss a retributivists view. I will
assume throughout that the premise of more reliable data really will provide much better

information than existed in the 20th century and ever before.

The modern trend in homicide statutes has been in the direction the MPC has taken; simplifying
the levels of gradation and leaving most of the relevant questions of provocation and mens rea to
the trier of fact. This age of cognition, though, and the reams of data available may make it ideal
to take some perview away from the trier of fact and leaving it to the algorithms and data. The
information could tell us how stable, violent, and cautious a person is. Therefore, the actus reus
of murder would be defined the same. The few gradations that are left, however, would be
eliminated, along with the mens rea gradations. Data can give us much more accurate
information on how likely it was that a person was negligently or recklessly creating a risk or

how likely it was that a person had the "purpose" of murdering in similar circumstances.

For example, we could know that a person claiming extreme emotional disturbance actually was
always predisposed to violence and angry outbursts. In this age of cognition, a utilitarian would
want to change section 210.3(b) of the MPC to say that the reasonableness of their excuse should

not be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the actor's situation under the circumstnaces


as he believes them to be. Instead, a utilitarian would want to change it so say that the
reasonableness of the excuse should be fixed by the algorithms and data that tell us how likely it
was that a person would fly into a homicidal rage at that time, and how likely it is that a person
will fly into a homicidal rage in the future. The higher the probability, the greater the

punishment, or rehabilitative effort (if possible).

Such a change is better for two reasons: first, the current definition is really just a crude way of
approximating the probability that the person was behaving as average person would. A jury is
going to base their information off of testimony and expert witnesses and then they are going to
have to try and determine what they think, given all of their biases and limited information. The
data can be much more precise. And, in a Benthamite's view we want enough punishment to be
as precise as possible in order to 1) adequately deter similar people for general deterrence and 2)
get as much specific deterrence as possible to deter the person in the future. All of the data can
tell us exactly how much punishment is necessary to to deter that person specifically and others
like him, given their income, tastes, and other preferences. And from an incapacitative
standpoint, we will have a much better idea of how much longer a person is likely to reoffend.
Additionally more accurate punishment is also more economic punishment. A utilitarian thinks

that punishment is a harm to society itself, so excessive punishment is undesirable.

Second, the old formulation was a concession to technological limitations, and not utilitarian
principles. A utilitarian does not care if an average person put in a similar situation would have

been provoked; rather, a utilitarian like Bentham wants to know if there is an amount of


punishment that will deter that person and future persons in like circumstances. Whether or not a
reasonable person with a similar background would have been provoked is a dynamic question
depending on the law itself. Data and algorithms in the age of cognition would do a much better
job of "dynamically scoring" whether or not a similar person could or should have been deterred.
Or, for incapacitative and rehabilitative purposes, a more relevant question is the liklichood that

this person will be provoked to murder again.

A retributivist, on the other hand would be more cautious about accepting the use of this data. A
retributivist would want to keep the various mens rea elements of gradation, because they are, if
anything, just as important as the actus reus; they are important findings of fact that express how
morally wrong we think someone was, and how much punishment they deserve. The data can be
relevant, though, in providing information to fix the mens rea. A retributivist would similarly
allow the data to inform how predisposed someone was to violence, but not for the purpose of
increasing deterrence; instead, for determining how morally reprehensible it was that a person
was provoked by the cirumstances. The greater the probability of provocation, the lower the

moral blameworthiness.

Kant may not take such a view, given that he thinks that the moral imperative is derived by a
prior rational beings who are all the same; but such a view is irrelevant in the age of cognition.
Less extreme retributivists would probably deem this data to be relevant given that it could
eliminate jury biases or limitations in assessing how much remorse a person feels, or how

morally justifiable their crime might have been.


Lastly, some marxists or other critical theorists would be happy with this data because the
actuarial age tended to rely on qualities like gender, race, and income, all of which disadvantage
minorities, the poor, and women. The cognitive age may create a more egalitarian use of

information.

The biggest difference is that a retributivist would refuse to use the data prospectively, and

instead would insist on only using it to examine the crime itself.

(b) Rape

The trend in rape laws has been to model rape and sexual assault laws more like battery than the
traditional and limited definition of forcible rape. The age of cognition would encourage and
hasten this trend by making it more feasible to eliminate the force requirement for convictions of

sexual assault or rape.

Currently, a majority of jurisdictions still require force or the threat of force, including the
MPC.A major reason for this is that, without the force requirement, an accurate finding of fact
for non-consent is impossible; instead, it hinges on the believability/sympathy that a jury and
prosecutor feels for the victim versus the defendant. The age of cognition, though, can give us
reams of data involving the liklichood of consent and the liklichood of sexual predation.

Therefore, for all of the reasons articulated above, a utilitarian would do away with the force


requirement and instead look at the probability that the sex was non-consentual given the
information we have for both parties. Force would still be relevant, but the question would

instead be how likely is it that a person would use force again.

Such an approach would do away with some disturbing gaps in the law, such as in State v.
DiPetrillo, where a supervisor forcing himself upon an employee was not sexual assault because
the amount of force was insufficient. The age of cognition would allow us to take such

psychological pressure into account.

Furthermore, the question of whether or not the defendant's actions were calculated to instill
fear, or whether or not the victim's fear of force was reasonable could be informed by the data we
now have. Rather than ask the question in that archaic light, as in State v. Rusk, a utilitarian

would argue that the law should do away with those questions and instead look to the data.

Furthermore, about half of current jurisdictions require some reasonable resistance in order to
prove that the force was meant to forcibly rape. For the same reasons articulated above, a
utiltiarian would do away with this requirement, which would benefit victims who do not have to

further increase the risk of danger to themselves.

Age limits/statutory rape statutes would also probably be deemed irrelevant, since those laws

are typically crude ways of getting at consent.


Similar to above, a retributivst would take mostly the same approach, but would insit on only
using the data to look at the actus reus and fixing the mens rea gradation. A retributivist would
prefer to include explicit mens reas in rape and sexual assault statutes, which in many cases are
not present because of the force requirement. As explained above, convicting someone of a
specific mens rea has an expressive purpose that could be accomplished better in the age of

cognition.

It should be noted that a utilitarian might go so far as to do away with actus reus altogether, and
simply look prospectively at the liklichood of both crimes. Such an approach, though, seems

extreme, although could be justifiable in a utilitarian's viewpoint if the data is accurate enough.
