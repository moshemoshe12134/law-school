In considering how the information age should inform our definitions of crimes, the
relevant question is what does increased information do for us? The claim seems to be that it
allows us to determine two essential factors with greater certainty than ever before: that
information about an individual will tell us 1) about their particular moral blameworthiness, and
2) their potential for and liklihood of recidivism. If the new age gives us no information on
either of these points, then it becomes irrelevant to the definition of offenses. However, if it can
help us more accurately answer these questions and further the related penological goals of
retribution and utilitarianism, respectively, then new information could potentially allow us to

completely rewrite the mens rea requirement for homicide and the actus reus of rape.

New information about offenders potentially allows for a more subjective, individualized
form of justice. Currently the mens reas for homicide is defined by various statutes as knowing
or intending, recklessness exhibiting depraved indifference to the value of human life, or with
malice aforethought for murder, and under eextreme emotional disturbance, in the heat of
passion, or with provocation for manslaughter. What are these really trying to get at? The ask
1) whether the person is morally culpable, and 2) whether they pose a threat to society. Intent,
knowledge, recklessness, malice--these are all ways of asking that same question. If we can
genuinely know everything about a person, then we could potentially eliminate the mens rea
aspect of homicide altogether and simly ask, is this person morally culpable, and are they a
danger to society? The two questions, while getting at different penological goals, go

hand-in-hand: one who is morally culpable for their acts but committed them anyway is likely


more dangerous than one who acted without such culpability. However, the weight given to the

two considerations would depend on the goals of a state/statute.

Rape is somewhat different in that mens rea is not traditionally defined in the offense, and
instead the variations in formulation center more on the actus reus and the question of force and
the of consent. Some states focus on the aggressor's use of force, while others focus more on
the victim's consent (or lack thereof). No matter what the formulation, though, the goal is the
same as it is in homicide: these different tests are just different ways at trying to get at whether
the defendant is morally blameworthy, and whether they are a danger to society. There are of
course exceptions in which we hold actor's strictly liable for their actions (such as rape of young
children), but most rape questions get at these two key points. If we knew everything one could
possibly know about an actor, we could side-step the indirect questions and get straight to the

point we want to know: can this person be blamed, and are they dangerous?

This approach may seem to fail to satisfy the major utilitarian goal of deterrence. Whether or
not highly individualized justice would adequately deter actors would depend upon the public's
awareness of the methods in place. on the one hand, an actor could look at a defendant who is
acquited of a charge and think, "well, they got away with it, so I can." However, if actors were
fully aware of the certainty of punishment in their case because they would be morally
blameworthy and/or be evaluated as posing a threat, whereas the acquitted actor did not, then
deterrence would be served. In otherwords, the deterrence would stem from the certainty in

punishment.


Another concern with such revisions would be one of fairness and equal protection under the
laws, since defendants who commit the same act could be given opposite verdicts based on this
new formulation of offenses. However, the question then would be why we care about fairness
and equal protection. If it is because we ibherently believe that like acts need like punishments,
then extremely individualized justice conflicts with that. However, if fairness and equal
protection are simply means of trying to insure that punishment is furthering our penological
goals and is not being meted out arbitrarily, then these new formulations would not be
concerning: they would theoretically provide greater consistency and fairness in so far as
punishment would match culpability and the need for incapacitation. The question is whether

we want like acts consistently punished, or like goals consistently met.

I do not believe we will ever have such information on individuals that we can completely
accurately determine their moral blameworthiness or their potential for further harm without
using their apparent mens rea (for homicide) or the formulation of actus reus (for rape) into
account as a proxy. However, the availability of new information allows for interesting thought
experiments on what we would do if we had such perfect information of individuals, and it helps

to clarify what goals the current system advances.
