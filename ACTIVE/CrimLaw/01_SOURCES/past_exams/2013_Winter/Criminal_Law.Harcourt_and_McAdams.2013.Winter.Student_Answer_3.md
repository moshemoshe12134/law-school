All plausible incidents; All plausible defenses

A

1, Attempted Extortion

AR: Extortion requires both conduct (threats) and result (obtaining property). A engaged in
threats (to inflict bodily injury-death- on C&D). A did not successfully obtain property as a
result -- so may be incomplete attempt, which requires a substantial step strongly corroborative
of the actor's criminal purpose. Soliciting B to kidnap C&D is a substantial step strongly
corroborative of criminal purpose -- as is actually calling to make the ransom demands to their
families.

MR for attempt is "purposely." A's communications with B and with family of C&D indicate
clear purpose to extort.

Defenses: MPC denies impossibility defenses, so irrelevant that C&D's family would not have

paid the ransom (so impossible for A to fulfill result element of extortion AR).

2. Attempted Murder

AR: Murder requires causing death. A did not kill B, so incomplete attempt -- because A took a
substantial step strongly corroborative of criminal purpsoe by firing a gun in the direction of B
(use of a deadly weapon is strongly corroborative of intent to kill).

MR: Likely had purpose to kill, but under MPC recklessness is sufficient for murder, and A
clearly reckless because fired gun wihtout visibiility.

Defenses: Self defense- A may be justified in using deadly force against B because A has


reasonable belief that B will inflict serious bodily harm because B is attempting to strike A on

the head with a pipe.

B

1. Kidnapping (MPC)

AR: B unlawfully (because he did so with threats, pulling a pistol on them) removed C&D from
their home and confined them for a substantial period in a place of isolation.

MR: B has the purpose to hold them for ransom -- until A successfully obtains money from
C&D's family.

Defense: B may argue that he has a duress defense. He may argue that he was coerced to
kidnap C&D by the use of (or threat to use) unlawful force by A against B. A did not
apaprnetly use any force against B-- he just told him of the plan and that he required B's
contribution. However, B may argue that the incidents from 30 years of physical force by A
against B constiute an ongoing threat of force -- somewhat like the Battered Women (could
follow James precedent: abusive relationships may involve very non-explicit threats). Even if
there are threats, they must be such that a "person of resonable firmness in his situation would
have been unable to resist.". MPC Commentary indicates that his situation should include

"tnagible factors... like his strength, age, or health." B is smaller, weaker and less skilled fighter
than A, which suggests that it is probably reasonable for him to conclude that A can
kill/seriously injure him if he wants. Moreover, although MPC does not have an imminence

requirement, the reasonable would likely consider whether it is possible to escape the threat/force

and go to the authorities. B has a strong case that a reasonable person in his situation would


conclude that law enforcement will not intervene to help him (given his past experience w/ the
authorities) and A's explicit threat that if B ever involves the police again A will killB. The
MPC allows duress as a complete excuse even to homicide -- so it seems that B has a strong case
that a reasonable person would kidnap C&D in such a circumstance, given that he (and A) had
no intention to kill them.

The MPC does not preclude B from also arguing necessity defense, so that is a possibility --
though it is probably less likely to succeed than the "reasonable person" standard from duress
because it requires that the harm B would have faced would have been greater than the harm
from kidnpapping, etc. to C&D, and B may not be able to convince the jury that A would have

killed him had he not complied (possibly just that he would have faced some bodily harm).

2. Conspiracy

AR: B agreed with A that they would engage in conduct that constituted crimes (at least
kidnapping, extortion). Both engaged in "overt acts" in pursuance of the conspiracy -- B
actually taking C&D from their home, to an isolated location; A actually calling C&D's family
and demanding money/threatening to kill (and much less substantial steps than those would have
been sufficient).

MR: B did agree, apparently, with the "purpose" of "facilitating" the crime of extortion. He was
clearly doing these acts to help A get the money from the couple.

Defenses: Again, though B can argue that his agreement was done under duress-- under the
implied threats (based on past experience), and the explicit threat that if he were to go to the

police for help he would be killed. See above. The necessity defense may be stronger than


above because the agreement itself does little harm.

B may also argue that he has an affirmative defense because he thwarted the success of the
conspiracy. That is true, but he must have done so "under circumstances manifesting a
complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose" -- and if those are interpreted like
"complete and voluntary reununciation" under attempt, then the MPC may not allow the defense
because it was not necessarily voluntary if B thwarted just because the crime would be more
difficult to successfully compelte -- which here is true given that C&D obtained his weapon,

knew his identity, and threatened to turn him into the police.

B also agreed with C&D to attack Antonio, and he took an overt act to do so (using the pipe on
A), and he may argue that it was done under dures -- but there was no threat of unlawful force,

given that D handed B back the gun and the threat was merely to turn him into the police.

3. Attempted Murder

B took a substantial step toward causing the death of A (AR) by using a weapon (pipe- can be
deadly) against a vital part of A's head. From those facts , he at /east had a reckless MR
because there was likely aware of the risk of death and did so anyway. He again may argue that
he was under duress from C&D but that is unliekly to succeed. He may argue self-defense after
A fired at him, but he clearly provoked this particular incident with A. He may argue that he
was doing so in defense of himself because of A's ongoing abusive relationship (ongoing use of
force), but that seems unliekly to succeed, given that indefinite threats are not usually sufficient

even for battered wives.


B may have complicitly L for D's attempted murder of Eddie. He clearly was aiding C&D -
providing them with material aid (the weapon, attacking A), as well as encouraging them by
agreeing to help. For results crimes like murder, the MPC requires only the kind of culpability
that is sufficient for the commission of the offense -- and here, there is likely reckless MR
because he knew that C or D had the Baretta and that they were planning to fire at Eddie. It is
irrelevant that C has an excuse defense for the attempted murder because complicitly L under

MPC is not dependent on convicting the primary actor.

4. Assault
Clearly assaulted A because attempted to cause bodily injury. May also be L under complicity

for D's assault of F (see below).

Cc

1. Conspiracy

C agreed w/ D (and later B) to assault A and fire (attempt murder/serious injury) atE. That AR
is sufficient, as they did engage in multiple overt acts toward that commission. However, the
acts must be criminal -- which is where their defense would come in. They may argue that these
acts (assault, attempted murder) were actually lawful in this instance because they were justified
under self defense because under the MPC C can use deadly force in protecting himself against

kidnapping (which was the ongoing at the time they agreed).


2. Attempted Murder

MPC has no derivative liability for conspiracy, but C may be guilty under accomplice L for D's
attempted murder of E. He encouraged her (by agreeing that they shoudl fire at E) and provided
her wit hthe Baretta. However, there may be a justification based on self defense- the ongoing
kidnapping (see above). If no justification for C, then it is irrelevant that D has an excuse
defense for the attempted murder because complicitly L under MPC is not dependent on

convicting the primary actor.

3. Assault - of B
C is likely guilty of assault because he attmpted by physical menace (AR) -- lunging at B,
pinning and kicking him, to put B in fear of serious bodily injury -- including by taking his gun.

This, however, is justified use of force under the MPC because of the ongoing kidnapping.

Assault - of F

C may also be guilty under accomplice L (see above- aided, encouraged D) for D's assault of F,
because D negligently caused bodily injury to F with a deadly weapon. It could be argue that
she assumed only A & E were present, so there was no risk to others (especially a child such as
F) because it was such an isolated location. It depens on whether a reasonable person would ahve

though that there were others in the area in which D was firing her weapon.

4. Extortion

Were not trying to obtain PROPERTY when threatened B with turning him to police, so no theft


by extortion in threatening him so that he would help with their plan to assault A, shoot at E, etc.
