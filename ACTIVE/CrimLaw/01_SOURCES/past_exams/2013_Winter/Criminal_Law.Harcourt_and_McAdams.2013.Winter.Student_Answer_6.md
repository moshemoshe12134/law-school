Part 1

The central holding in MTS was that for rape, no additional force was required beyond the act
of sexual penetration itself. If the state enacted the approach taken by Maryland in Rusk the acts
in MTS would not give rise to criminal liability. In Rusk, the court held that force or a threat of
force are a necessary element of rape. In that case there was a finding of actual force (pressure on
the neck), but also of a threat of force. The threat of force used need only be reasonable from the
perspective of the victim, and implicitly a reasonable person would need to be able to recognize

that fear.

In MTS, the incident occurred without any actual force other than penetration. Even assuming
the victim's account there was no threat of force either. As such there is not even a need to
consider the mens rea or reasonableness of the views of either party regarding force - there

simply was none under the definition put forward in Rusk.

Part 2

Enacting MPC Section 213.1(2) might give rise to criminal liability, though it would depend on
the exact facts of the encounter. As there was no threat which would cause a woman of ordinary
resolution to submit (2.12(2)(a)) in MTS, the only way section 2.13.1 could apply is by using
subsection c for sexual intercourse where the woman is unaware a sexual act is being committed

upon her.


In MTS, the victim claimed that she was asleep when the penetration began, which would make
2.13.1(2)(c) applicable and a defendant liable. However, the court in MTS concluded the victim
was not sleeping at the time of the penetration, meaning that MPC 2.13(2) would not be
applicable. MPC 2.13(2) does not even mention force, meaning that even with the definition of

force used in MTS MPC 2.13(2) could not possibly give rise to liability.

Part 3

There are at least two statutes which would criminalize the conduct in MTS as lesser degrees of
sexual offenses. In New York, the conduct in MTS would be Rape in the Third Degree under
Penal Law Section 130.25(3). That law criminalizes sexual intercourse when engaged in without
the consent of the victim for some other reason than incapacity to consent. There was no consent

or incapacity in MTS, rendering that section applicable to the facts as found by the court.

The acts might also be criminal under New York Section 130.20 as sexual misconduct,

specifically as sexual intercourse without consent.

The Wisconsin Sexual Assault statutes would also criminalize the conduct in MTS as Third
Degree Sexual Assault in Section 940.225(3). That section criminalizes sexual intercourse with a

person without the consent of that person, where consent is defined as words or actions by a


person competent to give consent. There was no consent in MTS, either affirmatively through
words or implied by the actions of the victim. In Wisconsin the events of MTS might actually
rise to first-degree sexual assault under 940.225 if there was no consent, and some resulting

injury or psychological damage.

Wisconsin section 948.02 on Sexual Assault of a Child might also apply, as the victim was only
15 at the time of the incident. Statutory rape statutes from other states might likewise apply.
However, as the perpetrator in MTS was only 17 at the time of the incident, the applicability of
the Wisconsin section would depend on whether it excepts intercourse within a certain age range
or when the defendant is also a minor. The same issue could potentially apply to all statutory

rape statutes.

Similarly, Florida has criminalized non-consensual penetration without use of force as a felony,

with penetration itself satisfying the force requirement.

There is no state case outside of New Jersey of which I am aware directly treating force as does
the court in MTS, though some decisions on consent seem to apply similar principles.
Specifically, State v. Sherry in Massachusetts seemed to apply the idea that where there is a clear
communication of a lack of consent, actual physical force or threat of force need not be used for
the acts to constitute rape (victim too numbed to resist, goes along). The only force which can be

potentially read into the scenario is the penetration itself, meaning that Sherry might be adopting


the MTS standard even though focusing more clearly on the issue of consent.

Part 4

Any statute seeking to criminalize the behavior in MTS without criminalizing innocent behavior
must be carefully crafted. First, it is important to note a statutory rape statute is not likely to
accomplish these aims, as it would also criminalize consensual sexual intercourse amongst

teenagers.

To criminalize the specific conduct in MTS, a formulation like the one used in Wisconsin
would perhaps be best. To get at the conduct in MTS, the statute should criminalize "Sexual
contact or penetration without the affirmative consent of the victim, either express or implied."
To avoid confusing questions of statutory interpretation, there should be no separate mention of

force (why include it if it is implied in penetration?).

To avoid criminalizing innocent conduct, I would recommend that the statute require a mens rea
of recklessness as to the lack of consent when no force or threat of force beyond penetration is
used (Hess). There could also be a rebuttable presumption of recklessness if there was no
affirmative verbal consent. The additional check on consent (making proof harder) would
balance out the elimination of the requirement of force beyond penetration, allowing us to be

relatively sure that only culpable conduct is criminalized.


Recklessness would likely cover the events of MTS, as the court there found that consent for
sexual contact was not affirmatively communicated either verbally or implicitly. Even if there
was implicit communication, the rebuttable presumption discussed above would probably not

have been overcome by the defendant in MTS, meaning liability would still apply.
