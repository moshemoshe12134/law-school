Harcourt Question #2

1. Rusk required actual force or threat of force, satisfied by reasonably grounded fear. It would
not produce culpability for M.T.S. because the victim claimed to be asleep and the only force
was penetration. The Court also found that the victim consented to kissing, but did not consent
to penetration. There was no evidence of force or threat of force, which is why the prosecution
had to argue that penetration alone was sufficient force as required by the statute. Penetration

alone was not sufficient in Rusk.

2. M.T.S. would not likely be culpable under s. 213.1(2). As required, he is male, he had sexual
intercourse (per 213.0(2) includes any penetration) with a female victim, who is (presumptively)
not his wife. However, while the victim claimed to be sleeping, thus allowing the possibility of
the court to find (c) that she was unaware that a sexual act was being committed upon her and
that he knew this, the Court actually found that she did consent to kissing, but not to sex. Thus
disbelieving her sleeping testimony, making her aware. There is also no evidence of a threat (a),

or mental disease or defect of the victim (b), or a mistaken belief that M.T.S. was her husband

(c).

3. He would be criminally liable under Wis. Stat 940.225 of third-degree sexual assault "sexual
intercourse with a person without the consent of that person," where consent is "words or actions

by a person who is competent to give informed consent indicating a freely given agreement to


have seuxal intercourse". Or under 948.02 "whoever has sexual contact or sexual intercourse
with a person who has not attained the age of 16 years", as the victim was 15 and the defendant
was 17. Also under Florida's nonconsensual penetration law enacted in 1992 Fla. Ch. 92-135 for
second-degree felony which doesn't "require any force or violence beyond the force and violence
that is inherent in the accomplishment of 'penetration', presuming that it lacked an mistaken
belief in consent defense. Although it defines consent as "intelligent, knowing, and voluntary"
which "does not include coerced submission". Also potentially under New York 130.20 sexual
misconduct "sexual intercourse with another person without such person's consent... is a class A
misdemeanor", or rape in the third degree 130.25(3) "...sexual intercouse with another person
without such person's consent..." with consent under 130.05(d)"where the offense is rape ...under
130.25(3)...circumstances under which, at the time of the act of intercourse...the victim clearly
expressed that he or she did not consent to engage in such act, and a reasonable person in the
actor's situation would have understood such person's words and acts as an expression of lack of
consent to such act under all the circumstances", which appears similar to the ultimate decision
in M.T.S. Fisher, could also hold him liable as Pennsylvania's court rejected the mistake of fact
defense, however, as there was actual force in that case (since the prior consented to sex was
rough his mistaken belief was forceful consensual sex), that is potentially distinguishable. In
Reynolds, the court also found that the Alaska statute required no resistance from the victim and
that the defendant must have acted recklessly regarding the victim's lack of consent, which could
potentially convict MTS. Similarly, in Tyson, the court refused to give a reasonable mistake

defense to the jury when the accused was saying actual consent, as he was in MTS.


4. "Penetration without consent is an offense. Consent to penetration cannot be inferred from
consent to kissing or non-pentrative sexual acts alone."

This is as narrow as possible to fit the Senator's specific request of criminalizing M.T.S. without
risking criminalizing innocent behavior. It specifically requires penetration rather than force and
specifically identifies the lesser sexual conduct, without criminalizing innocent behavior by
requiring specific affirmative actions by the "victim" or "offender". Thus avoiding the potential
problem of the M.T.S. decision that defined consent as words or actions in all the circumstances
that show affirmative and freely given authority for specific act of sexual penetration, and then
deciding whether the defendant's belief that the "victim" freely gave affirmative permission was
reasonable, which could be interpreted to require more affirmative action by the victim than my
limited scope definition, which just states that the exact situation of M.T.S. - inferring consent

from kissing alone (as the facts were found by the court) is not enough.
