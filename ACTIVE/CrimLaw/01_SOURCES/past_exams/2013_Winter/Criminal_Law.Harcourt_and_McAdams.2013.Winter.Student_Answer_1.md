Antonio

Attempted Theft by Extortion:

Antonio threatened force against Deb and Clay with the intent to obtain the property of another,
and even though he did not complete the crime, his capturing them, calling for ransom, and
recruiting henchman were substantial steps strongly corroborative of this criminal purpose
(5.01). Ergo he meets all the requirements for attempted theft by extortion. Antonio might argue
that he didn't threaten those from whom he was demanding money (only their family members
Clay and Deb), but this defense wouldn't work since the MPC criminalizes use of threats against

"anyone" to obtain the property of another.

Attempted Murder:

Attempted murder requires that the actor take a step strongly corroborative of the purpose to kill
another. Murder itself does not require purpose, but attempted murder does (though some would

say 5.01 also allows for knowledge liability).

First, prosecution might argue that Antonio is guilty of attempted murder of Deb and Clay.
Antonio did lock them up and threaten to kill them, but he probably lacks the mens rea since it

was not his purpose to kill them (see Bern's testimony) but rather to get money and he also didn't


know that he would need to do so, since even though we learned after the fact that money wasn't
coming (and thus that he might have followed through on this threats) this wasn't known at the

time.

Second, Antonio might be guilty of attempted murder of Bern. He fired at Bern with the
purpose (MR) of inflicting death or serious bodily injury (AR), and the shot was a substantial
step strongly corroborating this intent. Antonio will argue self-defense under 3.04. It is true that
he faced a threat of death or serious bodily injury from Bern's Pipe, and he may not have had or
had actual knowledge of having any ability to retreat. It may have also been immediately
necessary. His self-defense claim might be vitiated under 3.04(2)(b)(i), which bars use of deadly
force in self-defense if the actor provoked the deadly threat against himself "in the same
encounter" so that he could then "justifiably" cause death or serious bodily injury in turn. That
said his defense should survive this section; even though he was possibly willing to cause serious
bodily injury to Bern in that encounter, it certainly wasn't his purpose to do so, and it wasn't his
purpose to provoke Bern. Giving him a defense seems unjust, but it points to the strictness of the

MPC's self-defense fault clause.

Bern

Kidnapping:


Bern removed Clay and Deb from their home and kept them in a place of isolation (AR). He
might argue that he lacks the mens rea because the statute requires "purpose" and that his only
purpose was to get Antonio off his back. Yet the statute also allows for "purpose" to "facilitate
the commission of any felony or flight thereafter", and Bern's purpose to get rid of Antonio fits
into commissioning his flight. Bern will argue duress, saying that a person of reasonable
firmness in his situation would have given in to what he would argue was an implied threat from
Anthony ("require your cooperation"), especially because his "situation" under the statute
includes past experiences with Anthony. But this probably isn't true: Bern's cooperation likely
wasn't reasonable. The MPC doesn't require that the threat be imminent or immediate, but the

fact that it wasn't imminent does bear against a finding of reasonableness.

Conspiracy:

Bern agreed to commit a crime with Anthony (AR) with the purpose of seeing it done (MR) , so
he is probably guilty of conspiracy. Bern may argue that he lacks the mens rea; Conspiracy under
the MPC requires purpose, and he'd say that his purpose was only to get rid of Anthony.
However, 2.02 specifies that higher motives beyond the purpose for the crime do not negate a
purposeful mens rea. Additionally, the fact that Bern had a stake in the venture (getting rid of
Anthony) also may support a finding of purpose (Lauria). Additionally, he may be guilty of

making conspiracy to commit crimes with Deb and Clay assuming those weren't privileged.


Attempted Murder:

Bern purposely swung his pipe at Anthony with the intent to cause serious bodily harm or death,
and therefore might be guilty of attempted murder. Bern might argue that attempt charges require
specific intent as to result elements (death in the case of murder) and that he only intended to
wound or incapacitate Anthony. The fact that he didn't hit him again after he was unconscious
may support that he didn't have the purpose to kill (though then again perhaps he did on the
original swing, which is all that is needed). Additionally Bern may raise several defenses. First,
duress, saying that was acting under threat from Clay. However, this threat wasn't reasonable,
given that Clay's threat was only to go to law enforcement (ie, a person of reasonable firmness
does not fear law enforcement). Bern might also raise a necessity justification defense, saying
that this was the best choice amongst evils (preventing a crime, saving the Clay and Deb etc.).

Whether or not he reasonably made the correct lesser-evil choice seems unclear.

Additionally, since Bern was now on Clay/Deb's side and would thus be subject to Antonio's
wrath, he was acting in self-defense from what he believed was an "immediate" threat of deadly
force. He might lose if the law doesn't term Anthony's threat "immediate" (he hadn't raised a
weapon yet), but this would not mean guilt of attempted murder. Rather the MPC allows for
self-defense even if beliefs about the immediacy/deadliness of a threat are unreasonable. All that
is required is a subjective belief in the necessity and immediacy of self-defense. Bern could be
guilty of reckless/negligent crimes stemming from a reckless/negligent (respectively) belief in

the need for self-defense (3.09(2)), but attempted murder requires purpose and ergo even this


imperfect defense would bar an attempted murder charge. Additionally Bern might argue that he
was using deadly force to prevent a threat of deadly force to others (Clay/Deb) and so is justified
under 3.05. Finally Bern could also argue that it was necessary to stop a kidnapping (which

justifies deadly force under 3.04(2)(b)).

Simple Assault:

Bern is probably not guilty of simple assault towards Felix. One try attempt to hold him liable
on a theory of vicarious liability through accomplice liability (aid/encouragement Deb's conduct
fighting Eddie), but Deb herself probably did not have the requisite mens rea for simple assault
on Felix since simple assault with a deadly weapon requires a negligence mens rea and a
reasonable person probably would not have expected there to be an occupant of the car. That said
if Deb was negligent then Bern would probably be guilty since even though Deb has an insanity
defense, the MPC does not require that the principle actor actually be guilty in order to find
accomplice liability. Rather it focuses on "conduct" and Deb's conduct, shooting a running man,
probably has no other justification or excuse. That said Bern could still argue that he had the
purpose only to aid justified conduct (self-defense from Eddie's attack) and so couldn't be guilty

of Deb's excesses. After all the MPC lacks a Luparello-type doctrine.

Clay


Conspiracy:

Clay agreed to conduct which might otherwise consitute a crime (fighting Edwin and Antonio),
with the purpose of accomplishing that conduct, but that conduct was probably justified and ergo
he probaly lacks the actus reus for conspiracy, because conspiracy requires an agreement to
commit crime, not an agreement to commit justified behavior. Clay would argue that agreeing to
fight Edwin and Antonio was justified on the grounds of self-defense, since he subjectively
believed that it was necessary to prevent a kidnapping, and he this belief probably wasn't
reckless or negligent under 3.09(2) (and thus there wasn't even a reckless or negligent crime).
Prosecution could argue that Clay didn't agree to "prevent" but rather to "stop" a kidnapping, but
this argument probably parses words too closely. The court would be willing to interpret
"ongoing" kidnapping into the statute. Prosecution might argue that the agreed-upon use of force
wasn't necessary since they could have all walked out of there, but the dangers of cold (with no
shoes) may make this unreasonable. Additionally Clay might argue that he agreed with Deb and
Clay out of self-defense and that this force was necessary. Prosecution could argue that lack of
immediacy makes it not necessary, but immediacy isn't actually required in all cases by the
statute, so what Clay agreed to may still have been justified. Clay might also argue choice of
evils/necessity, saying that his agreement was the less-evil choice compared to remaining

kidnapped even if the actions they agreed upon weren't entirely justified.

Prosecution could argue that Clay had an implied agreement with Deb and thus conspiracy with


her in her threats and pointing of the gun at Bernie. However, what might ordinarily be blackmail

is again probably justified here by the need to stop an ongoing kidnapping.

Attempted Murder:

Clay is probably not guilty of attempted murder. He could be termed an accomplice to Bernie's
actions against Antonio since by agreement he aided or encouraged them, and he probably had
the purpose that Bernie use force capable of causing deadly harm against Antonio. But given the
partial or full justifications for this force, Bernie probably isn't guilty of attempted murder and
neither is Clay here. It's true that the MPC refers to aiding/encouraging "conduct" and that ergo
Clay could be guilty even if Bernie has a personal defense, those same all or partial justifications
apply to Clay. Subjectively honest but wrong an reckless or negligent belief about the need for
that force could get Clay with a reckless or negligent crime (3.09), but not a purposeful one like

attempted murder.

Additionally Clay probably isn't guilty of attempted murder through Deb's shots at Edwin
because there isn't evidence that he had the purpose for her to shoot to kill when it clearly wasn't
necessary. The MPC requires that accomplices to unjustified actions have a purpose for each of
those actions, so even if Deb's excess was foreseeable Clay wouldn't be guilty of vicarious

liability through her.

Simple Assault of Bernie


Clay probably implicitly encouraged Deb to menace Bern with a gun and probably had the
purpose that she do so, so in other circumstances he would be guilty of assault through
accomplice liabilty (2.06). But again his and Deb's actions here were probably justified by
necessity; threatening Bern appears to be a lesser evil than passively remaining kidnapped; or
justified by self-defense (since they probably had a subjective belief that they faced death or
serious bodily injury otherwise), or possibly even excused by duress (by the man-made not
natural threats of Antonio if one can term their being trapped by winter cold in a man-made

shelter to be a man-made threat).

Simple Assault of Felix

Clay like Bernie probably is not liable for simple assault of Felix. Even though he encouraged
Deb (by agreement if nothing else) to fight Eddie, he probably did not have the purpose that she

continue shooting after he was running, and ergo lacks the mens rea for accomplice liability.

Theft by Extortion:

Clay obtained Bern's gun by threat of exposing a secret and accusing him of a criminal offense
and had purpose when he did so, so in other circumstances he would be guilty of theft by
extortion under 223.4. But again Clay's act was probably justified by necessity (he had no other

means of escape from the ongoing kidnapping which was a greater evil), and so he probably is


not guilty. Even if Clay caused the necessity by first returning the gun, he did so out of

neccessity to avoid leaving in the cold (which wasn't a viable option).
