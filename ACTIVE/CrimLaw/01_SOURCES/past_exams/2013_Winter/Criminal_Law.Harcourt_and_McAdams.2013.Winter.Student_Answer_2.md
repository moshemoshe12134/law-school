McAdams Question

Part A

1. Antonio is guilty of attempted theft by extortion. He purposely tried to obtain property (223.4)
by sending the ransom letter and threatening to (223.4(1)) inflict bodily injury on anyone. He
purposely 5.01(1)(a) threatened to kill C and D in his ransom letter to their family and 5.01(1)(b)
purposely or knowingly took a (c) substantial step that (2) strongly corroborates his criminal

purpose by sending the letter and doing the kidnapping.

2. Attempted murder requires purpose to kill (Smallwood, Raines, Thacker). As in Smallwood,
if his purpose can be explained by other intentions, in that case the intent to rape, and in this case
the attempt to extort money from C/D's family, then he would likely not have the requisite mens
rea. He intends to get ransom money. Killing C/D would likely frustrate rather than advance his
purpose.

Blind firing at Bern after being hit on the head could also be attempted murder. But
self-defense would likely apply, since attempted murder requires purpose reckless/negligent use

of force couldn't negate it (3.09)

Part B
1. Bern is guilty of kidnapping. He unlawfully (gunpoint threat) removed C/D from their home,

and unlawfully confines them for a substantial period, at least 3 days, in an isolated country


house. He has the required mens rea of purpose to (a) hold them for ransom or reward. He
potentially has a defense of voluntarily releasing C/D alive and in a safe place prior to trial,
making it a second degree felony. However, since he does so by C/D's force initially and then
by threats to tell the police about his full name, later when he joins their plan, this wouldn't likely
be successful. He may argue duress, claiming that he was fearful of Antonio, like he tells C/D.
However, since it had been 2 years since the last attack and threat from Antonio, other than the
minimal slapping and shoving, a person of reasonable firmness in Bern's situation wouldn't likely
be unable to resist, although duress does apply to greater evils (2.09(1)). Additionally, since the
threat is just general bullying, it doesn't not appear to be the do it or else type situation typical of
duress. However, like Toscano, Bern was not benefitting from this plan. Imminence is also
just a factor, not a requirement under the MPC. However, in Toscano there was an implicit
threat specifically related to filling out the fraudulent forms, whereas here there is just the
general fear of Antonio and a prior, but unrelated threat to kill. He would also likely fail a
necessity claim under 3.02(1)(a) because the harm of kidnapping and extorting would not seem
to be the lesser evil as compared to being bullied. Also, threatening to kill 2 people is a greater

harm than threatening to kill one person, and necessity counts innocents.

2. Under MPC 5.03 Bern would be guilty of conspiracy.

First, he conspired Antonio. Antonio tells Bern of the plan and Bern does it, this should at least
be an implicit agreement under James/Interstate/5.03(1)(a). Bern does the actual kidnapping,
clearly meeting the overt act requirement 5.03(5), although not required as kidnapping is a first

or second degree felony. He might claim renunciation under 5.03(6) but since C/D use force to


cause Bern to let them go and give them his gun, this isn't likely voluntary, neither would his
later joining of C/D's plan to attack Antonio, and thus thwart the success of his initial conspiracy
with Antonio, be voluntary as it was done by threat of reporting him to the police.

Second, he might be guilty of conspiring with C/D when he agrees to join their plan to attack
Antonio,but he might claim duress because of their reporting threats, if this was deemed the
lesser evil he might also claim necessity. However, isn't likely the lesser evil, as required to shoot
someone than to be reported for your crime. He could also be refused a defense of necessity for
negligent or reckless offenses as he would likely be seen as recklessly placing himself in the
situation that caused the necessity - based on the risk of kidnapees rebellion or a RP's assessment
thereof - and thus couldn't use necessity for any reckless or negligent mens rea crimes against
Antonio(3.02(2)). Similarly, recklessness would preclude duress for any crime, and negligence

for negligence mens rea crimes (2.09(2)).

3. All of the attempted murder mens rea requirements above similarly apply here - intent to kill.
Raines found that intent to kill can be found from using a deadly weapon against a vital body
part. Swinging a metal pipe at someone's head should be found to be a deadly weapon against a
vital body part. This is also clearly a substantial step strongly corroborating his criminal
purpose, as he was lying in wait, stangind in the open doorway to greet Antonio, while holding a
metal pipe behind his back (5.01(2)(a)). | Further indicating his intent to kill rather than to just
knock him down etc, Bern hits Antonio on the head again, knocking him unconscious.

However, the fact that he then stops and does not ensure that Antonio is actually dead, etc might

weigh against intent to kill, showing an alternative purpose, similar to Smallwood, that he just


wanted to incapacitate Antonio and not actually kill him (or like Smallwood that he was only
reckless in whether or not Antonio died which was not sufficient for purpose). The availability of
duress and necessity would apply similarly as above, except the harm of killing would have to be

weighed expressly against necessity.

4. Deb could likely be guilty of simple assault of Felix under 211.1(1)(a) under recklessly if
when she fired the gun at the window she consciously disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that he would injure someone (2.02(2)(c)). Because causing an injury can be established if
the actual result only differs because it is a different person injured (2.03(3)(a)) and she was
shooting and at least reckless in hitting Eddie, either with the bullet or the glass, this would
transfer the intent to Felix. Bern could only be guilty if he is Deb's accomplice, depending on
whether he agreed with Deb/Clay becuase of duress/necessity discussed above, he could be
found to have agreed to do the offense. When causing a result is the element, which it is for
simple assault, Bern is guilty if he had the same mens rea required for the offense - recklessness
at least. Since part of their plan was for Deb to be firing at Eddie, this would encompas the
recklessness transferred intent discussed above. As MPC does not allow deriviative liability for

conspiracy, he could not be liable for Deb's conduct via conspiracy.

Part C
1. Clay is guilty of conspiracy with Deb (at least) becuase he agrees with her to attack Antonio
with a gun - purpose and conduct (5.03(1)). It is also immaterial to Clay's liability that Deb has

an insanity defense 5.04(1). As Deb takes the overt act of shooting at Eddie that requirement


would be satisfied, although it would not be required for any first or second degree felonies
(5.03(5)). Because they using, potentially deadly force(3.11(2) firing a weapon at a person or
vehicle is presumptively deadly force), to escape kidnapping, they could have a self-defense
claim under 3.04(2)(b), because the kidnapping is ongoing. Since they did try to escape without
using deadly force, by looking for shoes/phone/etc they would have an argument against the

requirement that they knew that they could retreat with complete safety (3.04(2)(b)(1i)).

2. Clay is also Deb and Bern's accomplice as he purposely solicits (2.06(3)(a)(i)) Bern to attack
Antonio and aids Deb and Bern in planning (at least) the attack (2.06(3)(a)(ii)). As per B-3
above, if Bern is guilty of attempted murder Clay would be as well, he purposely told Bern to
knock Antonio in the head - which implies intent to kill. Similarly, he and Deb planned that she
would shoot at Eddie - per Raines also implying intent to kill. While Smallwood might remove
the specific intent to kill substituting only his intent to escape, especially since he tends to

everyone's wounds afterwards, there is a fairly strong case for attempted murder.

3. As Deb's accomplice, Clay would likely be guilty of simple assault on Felix, by the same
transferred intent of 2.03(3)(a) and that the intended harm to the intended victim would have
been more serious (getting shot is more serious than getting hitwith some flying glass). It could
potentially be remote, but since the likelihood of Eddie getting hit with a bullet or glass was very
high, the transferred intent to a different victim under recklessness should still fit for Felix.
Because complicity requires the result mens rea to be the same as the substantive offense -

recklessness, as discussed above (2.06(4)). Clay agreed with Deb to the gun attack on Eddie,


which included the reckless shooting. Clay could be guilty of simple assault on Bern under (c)
when hesays "now you're giving us a reason to want to kill you" because his accomplice Deb has
a gun and that could be a physical menace that puts Bern in fear of imminent serious bodily

injury - being shot.

4. Clay could be charged with theft by extortion because he gets the gun (Bern's property
(233.4)) from Bern by threatening to (233.4(2)) accuse him of a criminal offense (kidnapping).
However, since Bern did actually kidnap Clay and Deb, Clay could have an affirmative defense
to threatening to report him, if the escape plan was deemed restitution or indemnification for the
harm of the kidnapping. This would at least be arguable, as escape seems like a reasonable

"restitution" from kidnapping.
