CRIMINAL LAW
PROFESSORS HARCOURT & MCADAMS
FALL 2012 — WINTER 2013

Final Examination

This is an open-book, three hour, in-class examination. It is open book so you
may refer to any materials you have that are printed or on an electronic file, but you
should not consult the web and you may not talk to or confer with anyone else. To
repeat, you may not speak or consult in any way with any other person during the exam.

This examination consists of seven (7) pages total (including this cover sheet).

This examination consists of two parts that will be graded evenly (50% and 50%).
The first part (Part I) corresponds to the first quarter taught by Professor Harcourt. The
second part (Part II) corresponds to the second quarter taught by Professor McAdams.
You will probably want to spend 90 minutes on each part since they will be weighed
equally toward the final grade.

Professor Harcourt’s part (Part I) consists of 2 questions, that will each represent
50% of the Part I grade; so you will probably want to spend 45 minutes on each question.
Professor McAdams’ part (Part II) consists of 1 question that will be graded 100% of the
Part II grade, so you should probably want to spend 90 minutes on that question.

It is anticipated that you can respond to each question in Part I with no more than
1,000 words, so please do not exceed 2,000 words total on Part I. Please do not exceed
2,000 words on Part II, but 1500 should be sufficient.

Good luck on the exam and have a great spring.

Bernard Harcourt and Richard McAdams


Part I: Harcourt Quarter

Part I of this Criminal Law examination is worth half of the final grade. Therefore, you
should spend half your total time, or 90 minutes, on Part I. Part I consists of two
questions. Each question is worth half of the Part I grade, therefore you should spend 45
minutes on each question. It is anticipated that you can answer these questions without
exceeding 1,000 words for each question, or a total of 2,000 words on Part I.

Harcourt Question #1
(45 minutes)

We discussed in class the actuarial shift in criminal law over the course of the twentieth
century: the shift from an earlier model of criminal law that was based more on moral
notions of blameworthiness and culpability toward a contemporary system that is based
more on criminal propensities and the prediction of future dangerousness. This shift has
important implications for the definition of the elements of crimes like homicide and
rape.

But it seems in fact that we have entered a new age, one that goes far beyond the
actuarial. It is an age where we no longer need to use background traits of the accused
(age, family status, educational level, employment, etc.) to predict the likelihood of
someone violating the criminal law. Instead, we can mine all the data that we have about
an individual and, in a much deeper way, “know them.” We can collect data using credit
card and frequent-buyer purchases, internet searches, texts and tweets, etc., and learn
about every little thing that they have bought, consumed, read, thought, and done during
their entire lives; and, using advanced algorithms (very similar to what Amazon or
Google use to offer them products they will want to buy), we can know almost exactly
what they have done and would do. We have moved beyond the actuarial age into one of
a perfectly accurate virtual reality—the age of cognition—in which we can know
everything about the individual.

This new age of cognition may interact in interesting ways with the different
theories of punishment that we studied in the course. Relatedly, it might also have
significant implications for the way in which we define the elements of a crime. In an
essay, please tell me what you think the implications of this new age of cognition are for
the way that we should define the principal elements of the crimes of (a) homicide and
(b) rape.


Harcourt Question #2

(45 minutes)

You are a legislative aide to a state senator who is drafting a new sexual assault statute
for your state and trying to compare existing statutes and case law. The senator has asked
you to read through the facts presented in the New Jersey Supreme Court decision in
State in the Interest of M.T.S. (see Criminal Law and Its Processes, 9" edition at 363-
367; 8" edition at 318-322). The senator would like the behavior that occurred in M.T.S.
to give rise to some kind of criminal responsibility. The senator asks you a series of

questions. Please answer to the best of your ability.

1.

If we enacted the approach taken in Maryland reflected in the court’s decision in
State v. Rusk (9" edition p. 343; 8" edition p. 302), would the behavior in
question (i.e. the behavior that occurred in M.T.S.) be subject to criminal liability?

If we enacted the approach taken in the MPC Sec. 213.1(2) for “gross sexual
imposition” (discussed, for instance, at 9" edition p. 358; 8" edition p. 315),
would the behavior in question be subject to criminal liability?

Is there any state statute or court decision that you are aware of, other than those
from New Jersey, where the behavior in question would subject the accused to
criminal liability? If so, what is the language exactly that would criminalize the
behavior in question?

What in your opinion would be the best way to write statutory language that
would criminalize the behavior in question without too great a risk of
criminalizing innocent behavior?

Part II: McAdams Quarter

Part II of this Criminal Law examination consists of one question worth half of the final
grade. We therefore recommend that you spend half your total time, or 90 minutes, on
this Part. Do not exceed 2,000 words in your answer; 1500 is likely to be sufficient.

From childhood, Antonio has physically bullied Bern, slapping him, shoving
him, employing “submission holds” to make him beg for mercy, and occasionally
punching him. Antonio is larger, stronger, and a more skilled fighter than Bern. On one
occasion, when both men are in their mid-30s, Bern fights back and Antonio gives Bern a
beating that puts him in the hospital. Bern reports the incident to the police, but the only
other witness gives a false account favoring Antonio’s claim of self-defense, so police
never make an arrest. Antonio later tells Bern that if he ever involves the police again, “TI
will kill you.” There is not another incident like this one, but Antonio returns to his
occasional less serious assaults of Bern.

Two years after the hospitalization, Antonio tells Bern “I am engaged in some
retirement planning and require your contribution.” Antonio describes how he wants to
abduct a wealthy couple, Clay and Deb, to hold them for ransom. He supplies Bern with
a loaded Baretta pistol. As Antonio instructs, Bern goes (by himself) to the home of Clay
and Deb. At the door, Bern pulls the pistol and threatens to use it if they don’t do exactly
what he says. As he demands, they get into his van and place manacles there on their
hands and feet. Bern blindfolds Clay and Deb and drives them to an isolated country
house. He forces them into the basement, behind a metal door. The basement is well
heated and he takes their shoes and clothing except, for each, a T-shirt and pair of shorts.

Antonio makes ransom demands of the family of Clay and Deb, threatening to kill
them if he is not paid. He waits for the money to be wired to an untraceable account.
During this time, Bern brings food and water to the basement twice a day, making Clay
and Deb stand back from the door before he steps in with the supplies. On the third day,
during one of these visits, Clay and Deb sense Bern’s reluctance to be involved in the
kidnapping. They engage him in conversation and discover that he is afraid of Antonio
and is acting on his orders. They try to reason with him, to get him to let them go. Bern
says “Sorry, but I’m more afraid of Antonio than a prison sentence.” Clay says: “When
Antonio goes away for life, you won’t ever have to worry about him again.” Deb adds:
“Tt’s time to stand up to the bully.” At this point, Bern sighs heavily, leans against the
wall with his hand on his forehead, and says: “God, ve always wanted to.” Seeing an
opportunity, Clay and Deb lunge at him. In the ensuing struggle, Clay pins Bern to the


ground and Deb kicks Bern in the ribs twice before he gives up. Clay grabs the Baretta
from Bern’s holster and hands it to Deb.

Clay and Deb then lock Bern into the basement and look to leave. They discover
that escape is going to be more difficult than they had imagined. There is no car. The
temperature is well below freezing outside and it is snowing. To get to another building
or person, they estimate that they would have to walk several miles over snow in their
shorts and without shoes. They remember that even Bern had been wearing only shorts
and no shoes when he came to the basement, so they can’t take his. Apparently Antonio
left Clay and Deb in this shoeless situation just in case they got past Bern. They find no
good substitutes for shoes in the house. They can find no phone.

Clay and Deb return to the basement. Pointing the gun at Bern, Deb threatens to
kill him if he does not tell them how to escape, by identifying some hidden stash of shoes
or a cell phone. Bern denies knowing anything useful. Deb pushes the gun against Bern’s
temple and says “Ask God to forgive you; you’ll see him in 10 seconds.” She counts
down: “ten, nine, eight . . .” Bern is terrified, pleads for his life, and begins
hyperventilating. But he says nothing useful to escape. When Deb gets to “zero,” she
does not pull the trigger but says to Clay: “I believe him.”

After a pause, Clay and Deb resume questioning Bern, who says that he expects
Antonio to return at Spm that day, that he will be armed, and that he will have one other
armed man with him, Eddie, a chauffer/bodyguard who knows nothing about the
kidnapping, but provides violent assistance when Antonio needs it. If Bern does not open
the front door and wait for them in plain view, they will know that something is wrong,
flank the building, and attack from separate entrances. Clay and Deb ask Bern if Antonio
plans to kill them after he gets paid the ransom and Bern says no. “He has picked out a
country without an extradition treaty with the U.S. He’s been talking for years about
making one big score and retiring there. He’s not above killing, but he is rational about
this and it doesn’t make sense to kill you. After he gets paid, he will leave the country
and I will make an anonymous call to tell the police where to find you.” Bern says he will
not receive a share of the ransom money. When Clay and Deb express the unfairness of
that result, he says that he will be happy to be rid of Antonio. “Besides,” he says, “I can
disappear. You don’t know my last name and I have no criminal record. Just give me the
gun and go back to the basement and everyone will get out of this alive.”

Clay responds: “The day before you kidnapped us, we saw you snooping around.
Obviously, we didn’t figure out what you were up to, but we did learn that your name is
Bernard Beauregard.” Bern is stunned; that is his full name. Clay continues: “Help us
attack Antonio and Eddie and we will never tell the police who you are. We will let you


walk. If you are caught, we will put in a good word with the D.A. But if you don’t help,
we tell the police that Bernard Beauregard kidnapped us.” Bern says: “Now you're giving
us a reason to want to kill you!” Deb hands Bern the pistol and says: “Go ahead. I don’t
think you can.” Bern holds the pistol and eventually says: “I’m not shooting anyone.”
Clay says: “I didn’t think so. Give us the gun and join our plan to attack Antonio or we
will tell the police you kidnapped us.” Bern complies. Clay and Deb describe a plan to
lure Antonio in the building, knock him in the head, and take his gun, while firing at
Eddie. Bern agrees to participate in the plan.

At 5pm, Antonio drives up with Eddie. Eddie stands next to the car and Antonio
walks to the house. Bern stands in the open doorway to greet Antonio, as he normally
does. Behind his back, however, Bern holds a metal pipe. As Antonio enters, Bern steps
back, shuts the door and, following the plan, swings the pipe at Antonio’s head. Antonio
sees the blow coming and ducks, so he absorbs only a glancing blow near the eyes. Still,
he screams in pain and falls to his knees. Eddie, hearing the shout, runs towards the
house. Antonio can’t see because of blood, but pulls out his gun and fires blindly at Bern.
Antonio misses and Bern hits him again on the head, knocking him unconscious.

Meanwhile, Eddie runs toward the house. As he approaches, Deb peers out a
second story window with the Baretta. Eddie is not looking up. She waits until he is
almost directly under her before firing. Her first shot misses and Eddie looks up. Her
second shot misses and he turns and runs back toward the car. Deb’s third shot misses
Eddie and hits the car, breaking the side window. A flying glass shard hits a concealed
occupant, Eddie’s 8-year old son Felix, and he sustains a serious wound. Deb’s fourth
shot hits Eddie in the back and he goes down. Clay runs outside (bearing the cold), takes
Eddie’s gun and cell phone, and hears Felix crying in pain. Clay calls 911, tends to
everyone’s wounds, and allows Bern to flee on foot (wearing Antonio’s shoes and coat).
Everyone survives and is arrested. Clay and Deb learn that their family members had no
intention of ever paying the ransom. The prosecutor agrees with psychiatrists that Deb,
who did two tours in Iraq, was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder during these
events and has an insanity defense to any charge. Neither Bern nor Clay suspected this
fact. No one else has any basis for an insanity claim.

The prosecutor pieces together the above facts from successful interrogations of
all the involved parties, corroborated where possible by forensic investigation. The
prosecutor might want to exercise discretion by deciding not to prosecute all offenses.
But the first step and your only concern is to identify some of the plausible charges.
Assume that these events occur in a jurisdiction that has adopted verbatim the MPC, as
reproduced in the appendix to your casebook. Answer the following questions, identifying
arguments in the alternative for and against liability:


Part A: Antonio
(1) Is Antonio guilty of attempted theft by extortion?
(2) Is Antonio guilty of attempted murder?

Part B: Bern

(1) Is Bern guilty of kidnapping (§ 212.1)?

(2) Is Bern guilty of conspiracy?

(3) Is Bern guilty of attempted murder?

(4) Is Bern guilty of simple assault of Felix (§ 211.1(1))?

Part C: Clay

(1) Is Clay guilty of conspiracy?

(2) Is Clay guilty of attempted murder?

(3) Is Clay guilty of simple assault of Bern or Felix (§ 211.1(1))?
(4) Is Clay guilty of theft by extortion?

If there is more than one plausible theory for giving an affirmative answer to any
question, as for example, where the defendant has plausibly committed the named crime
more than once, then you should specify all plausible theories. If there is more than one
plausible defense to a charge, where no one defense is a definite winner, then specify all
plausible defenses. You should assume without discussion that §§ 3.03, 3.06, 3.07, and
3.08 do not apply to any issues raised by this question. Do not answer questions other
than the ones posed. Instead of repeating parts of your answer, you can refer back to
previous analysis.

At the end of your answer, state the number of words it contains.
