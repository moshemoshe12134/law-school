RE: Criminal Law Final Exam (Spring 2019)

DATE: May 18, 2018

Here are some thoughts on how to address the first question in the final exam. The
second question was very personal, given that it revolved around your definition of justice, so no
recommendations here.

Question #1 The Case against Bryan Thomas

This case involves a homicide (Jamonta Miles) and a non-fatal shooting (Ijah Baptiste).
The real issue is self-defense under 3.04 and 3.09. That should be the major part of your
discussion, up front and mostly about justification. You need to look at the exceptions to those
justification provisions for possible felony (stolen gun), possible aggressor, and the reckless
forming of belief (3.09). One of those probably applies, so the state can probably charge Thomas
with some level of murder for Miles’ death; alternatively, manslaughter if the belief was formed
recklessly. On the other hand, the attempt charge does not look promising because it would be
recklessness (probably), and 5.01 requires mostly purpose.

You should jump right into the justification issues, after quickly suggesting that for the
homicide of Jamonta Miles, the initial level of homicide could easily be first or second degree
murder, or 3. There is no need to spend much time on this initial question of mens rea, it is easy
and the real issue is self-defense. Thomas says he feared for his life and shot to defend himself.
He was shooting a 9mm multiple times, at least twice, in the direction of the youths. So there
would likely be either “knowledge that his actions may cause death” or “intent to cause death.”
This could raise the homicide to murder in the first or second degree pursuant to MPC § 210.26
(2™4 degree) or § 210.27 (1“ degree). It could also be argued that this rises to the level of third
degree murder (reckless with indifference to human life) or a type of manslaughter (first or
second degree). But it is worth analyzing first with higher level of culpability, since the excuse
may bring it down to these anyways.


I. Justifiable Use of Force: the bulk of your answer.

Thomas subjectively believed that his life was in danger, so the provisions of MPC §
3.04.012 on Justifiable Use of Force apply. This raises a number of issues:

1. Possibly forcible felony:

There is an allegation that the gun Thomas used may have been stolen. If so, the
discharging of the gun would be unlawful and amount to a “forcible felony” under §
3.04.08, and Thomas would not be entitled to the justification under § 3.04.041(1)
because he would be committing a forcible felony.

Under these circumstances, Thomas could be arrested and charged with first or second-
degree murder. Immunity (below) would not apply.

2. Possible aggressor:

There is an allegation that “Thomas began insulting” the youths after they approached
him to buy marijuana.

There is also an allegation that Thomas was “minding his own business before the
encounter” and that the youths “stopped” him.

It is not yet clear, but if the fact develop that Thomas “initially provoke[d] the use of
force against himself” (i.e. initially provoked the threatened force by the youths that
made him feel he had to defend himself), then under MPC § 3.04.041 the justification is
not available to Thomas unless he “has exhausted every reasonable means to escape such
danger.”

On the one hand the youths “initially” approached Thomas, on the other hand Thomas
“began insulting” them, so it is difficult to know, but possible that Thomas is the initial
aggressor and if so, he likely did not exhaust every reasonable means when he shot at a
car that was essentially fleeing. The car had already driven a short distance and the
youths were fleeing, Thomas could even have simply fired in air.

Under these circumstances, it is possible that Thomas could be considered the aggressor
and did not exhaust his duty, in which case he would be arrested and charged with first or
second degree murder.

3. Negligent, Reckless or Unreasonable Formation of Belief

Under MPC § 3.09, Thomas would not be entitled to use § 3.04 as a justification against a
homicide charge if he formed his subjective belief in a negligent or reckless manner.

MPC § 3.09 specifically states that ... It is applicable because all of the MPC provisions
other than the two modified provisions apply. MPC § 3.09 was not amended or repealed.

The key question then is whether he formed his belief recklessly or negligently. The facts
to discuss include:

For the prosecution:

i. the youths were driving away
ii. the car had driven a short distance already
iii. the youths did not have a gun


iv. the youths were not gang members according to parents

v. they were asking to buy marijuana, so not drug dealers

For the defense:

i. there were 7 youths

ii. the SUV doors were still open

iii. the youths were terrorizing people at random
iv. the youths are allegedly gang members

v. the youths had a Taser gun

Overall, my intuition is that it may have been reckless or negligent to form the
belief that his life was in danger. If so, Thomas would be arrested, investigated
and charged with

4. Immunity from criminal prosecution

Under MPC § 3.04.032, Thomas cannot be arrested, detained, charged or prosecuted if he

used force justifiably.

That would obviate arrest and prosecution if “prima facie claim of self-defense
immunity” is raised and upheld. If it is raised, then burden is on prosecution by clear and
convincing evidence. May as well assume prosecution has this burden. Given above discussion,
should be able to meet it.

Il. Attempted homicide of Ijah Baptiste

Thomas also fired a shot at Ijah Baptiste, who was struck in the elbow but survived. This
could amount to an attempted homicide.

All of the homicide analysis would be the same for Baptiste as for Miles.

The additional issue here is attempt then. If the prosecution properly moves forward on
first or second degree murder, there is no problem with attempted murder here.

The central question is whether there can be an attempted manslaughter under the MPC:
does the MPC provision on attempt allow a charge where the mens rea is recklessness or
negligence? Under MPC § 5.01(1)(b) requires purpose or specific intent to attempt. Attempted
murder requires a purpose to kill, by contrast to a minority of states.

Ill. Miscellaneous

The facts do not indicate whether any other shots were fired, so it does not seem
appropriate to pursue attempted murder charges against any other of the youths.


Also, this case does not raise EED or insanity, so do not waste any time on those.

Have a great summer, warm regards,

Bernard E. Harcourt
