Question 1

You are a clerk to the trial judge who has just been assigned this case. The judge
has asked you to pull together everything that is known about the homicide, and to draft a
memo. Here is what you have been able to find out about the homicide, drawing from
newspaper and police reports:

On May 11, 2019, at 11:25pm, near Grant Street and Broadway, 21-year-old
Bryan Thomas shot and killed 15-year-old Jamonta Miles.

The police authorities initially said that Miles, an eighth-grader at Oliver Holmes
Middle School, was in a gang called “The Crew,” and that seven gang members,
including Miles, squeezed into a GMC Yukon to hunt down an enemy but ended
up terrorizing people at random.

Armed with a Taser and a padlock, according to police reports, they argued with a
man who was identified as Thomas. Thomas fired several shots at the teenagers
with a 9mm pistol after they were driving away in the SUV. One bullet struck
Miles in the head, killing him.

The police booked everybody who was with Miles that night on gang and drug
charges. They have not yet arrested Thomas.

According to the police, the incident began as a Facebook feud between The
Crew, which included Miles, and local residents. The seven young men’s parents
deny that they were part of a gang. They say the teens were merely neighborhood
friends.

Miles was with six other teens the night he was killed. All six — Ijah Baptiste, 17,
Damian Dyer, 18, Jeremy Carcisse, 18, Donvon McPherson, 17, Devonte
Robertson, 17, and Damien Wagner, 18, — now face gang-activity and drug
charges. Several of them are free on bail; all are scheduled for arraignments this
week.

According to police reports, Miles and the teens threatened three people,
including Thomas, the night of the shooting.

Police found illegal fireworks, a padlock, and a Taser in the SUV the teens were

in, but they are not sure if they were used during the threats. Police first reported
that the teens had a gun, but further investigation determined that wasn’t true.

The teens allegedly stopped Thomas first to try to buy marijuana from him,
according to the police. Thomas began insulting them and they then got into an
argument. Thomas fired several shots from a 9 mm pistol he was carrying, the
police report said. Thomas said that he felt his life was in danger.

One bullet hit Miles in the head and another struck Baptiste, who survived, in the
elbow. Thomas fled, and the teens called the police. The police are investigating
whether the firearm used by Thomas was a stolen gun.

Thomas “was indeed minding his own business before the encounter,” a police
spokesperson said. “He then had to protect himself.”

The spokesperson said that the SUV doors were still open as the teens fled by car,
and they had only driven a short distance when Thomas shot them. They added
that Thomas’s fear was likely heightened because of the number of people who
approached him, the late hour, and the fact that he did not know them.

“As far as Mr. Thomas knows, they’re going to stop in 5 feet and jump out with a
gun,” the police chief told reporters.

“This case is a senseless tragedy that has taken the life of a young person who,
along with his peers, engaged in some foolish behaviors that escalated into an
unforeseen tragedy,” the police chief said. “They were pretending to be a gang,
making challenges on Facebook and trying to establish a street ‘rep.’ ... I don’t
think any of these young men in their wildest imaginations thought that their
criminal activity would lead to the death of their friend. It illustrates how these
things can escalate.”

Your judge has asked you to determine, based on the facts you collected, whether
there is a case against Bryan Thomas and if so, what is the proper level of criminal
responsibility and how to proceed. The judge has asked you to write a memo explaining
the situation fully and discussing the most important points. Please make sure, as you
present the situation to the judge, that you cover the strongest arguments for both sides and
that you indicate how you think the judge should proceed with the case.

Question 2

Please begin your essay by copying down and reproducing, as an epigraph* to your
essay, the original definition of justice that you came up with on the first day of class when
I asked you to write into your notebook what you thought justice meant.

Then begin your essay by telling me whether that definition of justice you came up
with helped you during the course of our Criminal Law class, whether you would stick
with it by the end of the course, whether and how (if so) you would modify it, and whether
it made any difference at all to you during your semester.

Then, please use two or three cases that we studied during the semester to analyze
whether, and if so how, your principle of justice would help you resolve the case. Would
it help deal with the legal issues in the case? Would it give you direction in how to think
about the case? Would it offer you a way to reach a legal holding? Or is it irrelevant to the
legal determination? Are there other principles or policies that should apply instead, and
how do they relate to justice?

Please write a well-structured, well-written, engaged, and interesting essay in
response to this prompt.

“ An epigraph is a short quotation placed at the beginning of an essay or book. It is usually
indented and single-spaced, and sometimes italicized. It is usually used to give meaning to
an essay or to capture the theme of a writing. Here, it is intended to express your original
idea of justice on the first day of class.

constituting murder, manslaughter, or criminally negligent homicide.

§ 210.10 Criminally negligent homicide.

A person is guilty of criminally negligent homicide when, with criminal negligence, he
causes the death of another person. Criminal negligence is more demanding than the civil
standard for negligence. Criminally negligent homicide is a class E felony.

§ 210.15 Manslaughter in the second degree.

A person is guilty of manslaughter in the second degree when he recklessly causes the
death of another person. Manslaughter in the second degree is a class C felony.

§ 210.20 Manslaughter in the first degree.
A person is guilty of manslaughter in the first degree when:

1. Knowing that he may cause serious physical injury to another person, he causes the
death of such person or of a third person; or

2. With intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or
of a third person under circumstances which do not constitute murder because he acts under
the influence of extreme emotional disturbance, as defined in subdivision one of section
210.25.

Manslaughter in the first degree is a class B felony.

§ 210.25 Murder in the third degree.
A person is guilty of murder in the third degree when:

1. With intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or
of a third person and the defendant acted under the influence of extreme emotional
disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse, the reasonableness of
which is to be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the defendant’s situation under
the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be; or

2. Under circumstances evincing indifference to human life, he recklessly engages in
conduct which creates a grave risk of death to another person, and thereby causes the death
of another person. Such indifference shall be presumed if, acting either alone or with one
or more other persons, he commits or attempts to commit robbery, burglary, kidnapping,
arson, sexual assault, drug trafficking, or escape, and, in the course of and in furtherance
of such crime or of immediate flight therefrom, he, or an agent of his, if there be any, causes
the death of a person other than one of the participants to the underlying crime; except that
in any prosecution under this subdivision, in which the defendant was not the only
participant in the underlying crime, it is an affirmative defense that the defendant:

(a) Did not commit the homicidal act or in any way solicit, request, command, importune,
cause or aid the commission thereof; and (b) Was not armed with a deadly weapon, or any
instrument, article or substance readily capable of causing death or serious physical injury
and of a sort not ordinarily carried in public places by law-abiding persons; and (c) Had no
reasonable ground to believe that any other participant intended to engage in conduct likely
to result in death or serious physical injury.

Murder in the third degree is a class A-III felony.

§ 210.26 Murder in the second degree.
A person is guilty of murder in the second degree when:

of a third person.

2. In any prosecution under subdivision one, it is an affirmative defense that:

(a) The defendant acted under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which
there was a reasonable explanation or excuse, the reasonableness of which is to be
determined from the viewpoint of a person in the defendant's situation under the
circumstances as the defendant believed them to be. Nothing contained in this paragraph
shall constitute a defense to a prosecution for, or preclude a conviction of, manslaughter in
the first degree or any other crime except murder in the third degree; or

(b) The defendant's conduct consisted of causing or aiding, without the use of duress or
deception, another person to commit suicide.

unlawful force. A person who uses or threatens to use force in accordance with the law
does not have a duty to retreat before using or threatening to use such force.

(2) A person is justified in using or threatening to use deadly force if he or she believes
that using or threatening to use such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great
bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the imminent commission of a
forcible felony. A person who uses or threatens to use deadly force in accordance with
the law does not have a duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground if the
person using or threatening to use the deadly force is not engaged in a criminal activity
and is in a place where he or she has a right to be.

fear of death or great bodily harm.

(1) A person who is in a dwelling or residence in which the person has a right to be has
no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and use or threaten to use:

(a) Nondeadly force against another when and to the extent that the person believes that
such conduct is necessary to defend himself or herself or another against the other’s
imminent use of unlawful force; or

(b) Deadly force if he or she believes that using or threatening to use such force is
necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another
or to prevent the imminent commission of a forcible felony.

(2) A person is presumed to have held a reasonable fear of imminent peril of death or
great bodily harm to himself or herself or another when using or threatening to use
defensive force that is intended or likely to cause death or great bodily harm to another if:

(a) The person against whom the defensive force was used or threatened was in the
process of unlawfully and forcefully entering, or had unlawfully and forcibly entered, a
dwelling, residence, or occupied vehicle, or if that person had removed or was attempting

Page 9 of 12


L6108-004

Criminal Law
Bernard E. Harcourt

to remove another against that person’s will from the dwelling, residence, or occupied
vehicle; and

(b) The person who uses or threatens to use defensive force knew or had reason to
believe that an unlawful and forcible entry or unlawful and forcible act was occurring or
had occurred.

3.04.031 Use or threatened use of force in defense of property.

(1) A person is justified in using or threatening to use force, except deadly force,
against another when and to the extent that the person believes that such conduct is
necessary to prevent or terminate the other’s trespass on, or other tortious or criminal
interference with, either real property other than a dwelling or personal property, lawfully
in his or her possession or in the possession of another who is a member of his or her
immediate family or household or of a person whose property he or she has a legal duty
to protect. A person who uses or threatens to use force in accordance with this subsection
does not have a duty to retreat before using or threatening to use such force.

(2) A person is justified in using or threatening to use deadly force only if he or she
believes that such conduct is necessary to prevent the imminent commission of a forcible
felony. A person who uses or threatens to use deadly force in accordance with this
subsection does not have a duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground if
the person using or threatening to use the deadly force is not engaged in a criminal
activity and is in a place where he or she has a right to be.

3.04.032 Immunity from criminal prosecution and civil action for justifiable use or
threatened use of force.

(1) A person who uses or threatens to use force as permitted by law is justified in such
conduct and is immune from criminal prosecution and civil action for the use or
threatened use of such force by the person, personal representative, or heirs of the person
against whom the force was used or threatened, unless the person against whom force
was used or threatened is a law enforcement officer, who was acting in the performance
of his or her official duties and the officer identified himself or herself in accordance with
any applicable law or the person using or threatening to use force knew or reasonably
should have known that the person was a law enforcement officer. As used here, the term
“criminal prosecution” includes arresting, detaining in custody, and charging or
prosecuting the defendant.

(2) A law enforcement agency may use standard procedures for investigating the use or
threatened use of force as described in subsection (1), but the agency may not arrest the

cause that the force that was used or threatened was unlawful.

(3) The court shall award reasonable attorney’s fees, court costs, compensation for loss
of income, and all expenses incurred by the defendant in defense of any civil action
brought by a plaintiff if the court finds that the defendant is immune from prosecution as
provided in subsection (1).

(4) Inacriminal prosecution, once a prima facie claim of self-defense immunity from
criminal prosecution has been raised by the defendant at a pretrial immunity hearing, the
burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence is on the party seeking to overcome the
immunity from criminal prosecution provided by law.

3.04.041 Use or threatened use of force by aggressor. The justification described
here is not available to a person who:

(1) Is attempting to commit, committing, or escaping after the commission of, a forcible
felony; or

(2) Initially provokes the use or threatened use of force against himself or herself,
unless:

(a) Such force or threat of force is so great that the person believes that he or she is in
imminent danger of death or great bodily harm and that he or she has exhausted every
reasonable means to escape such danger other than the use or threatened use of force
which is likely to cause death or great bodily harm to the assailant; or

(b) In good faith, the person withdraws from physical contact with the assailant and
indicates clearly to the assailant that he or she desires to withdraw and terminate the use
or threatened use of force, but the assailant continues or resumes the use or threatened use
of force.

3.04.08 Forcible felony. “Forcible felony” means treason; murder; manslaughter;
sexual battery; carjacking; home-invasion robbery; robbery; burglary; arson; kidnapping;
aggravated assault; aggravated battery; aggravated stalking; aircraft piracy; unlawful

3.04.085 Defense to civil action for damages; party convicted of forcible or
attempted forcible felony.

(1) It shall be a defense to any action for damages for personal injury or wrongful
death, or for injury to property, that such action arose from injury sustained by a
participant during the commission or attempted commission of a forcible felony. The
defense authorized by this section shall be established by evidence that the participant has
been convicted of such forcible felony or attempted forcible felony, or by proof of the
commission of such crime or attempted crime by a preponderance of the evidence.

(2) For the purposes of this section, the term “forcible felony” shall have the same
meaning as in section 3.04.08.

(3) Any civil action in which the defense recognized by this section is raised shall be

3.04.09 Retention of records pertaining to persons found to be acting in lawful self-
defense; expunction of criminal history records.

(1) Whenever the state attorney or statewide prosecutor dismisses an information,
indictment, or other charging document, or decides not to file an information, indictment,
or other charging document because of a finding that the person accused acted in lawful
self-defense pursuant to the provisions related to the justifiable use of force in this
chapter, that finding shall be documented in writing and retained in the files of the state
attorney or statewide prosecutor.

(2) Whenever a court dismisses an information, indictment, or other charging document
because of a finding that the person accused acted in lawful self-defense pursuant to the
provisions related to the justifiable use of force in this chapter, that finding shall be
