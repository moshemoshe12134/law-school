PART 1

This case is all about justifications of the use of force. The prosecution will probably charge Thomas with
manslaughter in the second degree for killing Miles, with the mens rea of recklessness, as the prosecution will
try to apply MPC 3.09 to negate Thomas' self-defense claim. It will be hard for the prosecution to establish a
higher mens rea, such as intent to kill (moving this to manslaughter in the first degree) given the subjective self-

defense available.
Defense

Thomas' defense will first argue that he should not be culpable at all. Thomas may first try disclaim the actus
reus and argue this result crime was not voluntary. According to MPC 2.02, a person is not guilty of an offense
unless the conduct includes a voluntary act. The defense can argue that a narrow time frame should be used
(Kelman) and that in the moment, as in Zimmerman's case, Thomas just feared for his life and pulled the trigger
involuntarily or under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance. MPC 3.04 does not even require the
defendant to retreat, so he had a duty to stand his ground in fear for his life. Assuming arguendo this defense
fails (given the multiple bullets fired), the defense will try to argue for a lesser culpability like criminally negligent
homicide. They will say Thomas should have been aware of the risk of death but that this was not in his

conscious mental state at the moment because he was merely fending for his life.

Their strongest defense is MPC 3.04.012(2), which says one is justified in using deadly force if he BELIEVES
that using such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself. This is a subjective
standard and thus, is very favorable to the defense. The defense will point to the sheer number of teens (7),
who carried themselves as gang, as evidence of Thomas' fear. The police reports show that the teens
threatened Thomas both on Facebook and in person (even calling the teens' behavior "foolish"). The teens
possessed illegal fireworks, a padlock, and a Taser--all of which potentially could have enhanced their threats.
Thomas could have believed the Taser was a gun--especially given the late hour of the night and darkness--in
fact, the police first reported the teens had a gun and Thomas said he feared his life was in danger. The defense
will also argue the teens stopped Thomas and tried to buy marijuana from him, which shows that the teens
were trying to engage in unlawful activity. There is no evidence that Thomas had pot on him. 3.04.012 allows
one to use deadly force if he believes he is trying to prevent the imminent commission of a forcible felony, too,
and given the subjective standard, the defense can argue that even if buying marijuana is not a forcible felony as
defined in 3.04.08, Thomas may not have known that and could've believed they were trying to commit other
felonies. Given the insults, the defense may also claim provocation as the police said Thomas had been
"minding his own business before the encounter." This defense will likely fail given that it is only usually used in

the common law as a heat-of-passion defense (ie witnessing adultery). Finally, the defense may try to argue

that the teens should be responsible for the death of a participant and that this was a felony-murder situation,
but this again seems far-fetched given that attempting to buy pot is probably not a felony.

Prosecution

The prosecution will first argue the culpability of Thomas was recklessness. Under MPC 2.04, recklessness
requires consciously disregarding a substantial and unjustifiable risk--a disregard which involves a gross
deviation from the standard of conduct of a law-abiding person in that situation. The prosecution will first argue
that a law-abiding person would not have shot in a situation where the teens were already FLEEING from the
altercation as was the case here when he shot. The doors were open, meaning that a reasonable person would
have known that shooting multiple bullets in their direction could have resulted in death. The prosecution will
next turn to the self-defense provisions. Under 3.04.012(2), a person who uses deadly force does not have a
duty to retreat UNLESS he is is engaged in criminal activity. If the prosecution can prove that the defendant
did indeed have pot on him, he may have had a duty to retreat and the self-defense provision would not be
available at all. Likewise, if Thomas’ gun was in fact proven to be "stolen," this too could establish criminal
activity.

In addition, this self-defense provision requires that the person believes the force was necessary to prevent
IMMINENT death/great bodily harm. Here, the prosecution will argue there is no imminence. They will use a
wider time frame to show that at the moment Thomas fired one bullet--let alone multiple bullets--he could not
have believed his life was imminently in danger because the teens were already in the SUV fleeing. Under MPC
3.09, if the actor is reckless or negligent in having a belief or in failing to acquire knowledge, 3.04's self-defense
does not stand. The prosecution has a very strong argument here. Although the self-defense provision in
3.04.012(2) is very subjective, the prosecution would do well to argue that Thomas was reckless in having this
belief in the imminency, just as was found in the case of State v. Norman (even though there was a "reasonable
belief" standard there). The teens were fleeing and did not even have a gun on them; the parents say the teens
were not even in a real gang but were "neighborhood friends." Miles was only in eighth-grade, whereas
Thomas was 21 years old and probably had more physical strength. Thomas could have clarified the situation
by asking the teens if they had a gun or what their plans were. The nail in the coffin (pun intended) for the
prosecution's argument is 3.04.041. First, the prosecution will use (2) to argue Thomas provoked the situation
by insulting the teens (which would also negate a defense of necessity/duress). The defense will counter that the
teens were the ones that provoked via their Facebook threats and will try to use (2)(a) to say the threatened
force was great. In response, the prosecution will say that Thomas did not exhaust "every reasonable means to
escape" the danger as he could have started fleeing after the teens drove away. He also does not fall under (b)

as he did not withdraw from physical contact with the assailant--rather, the opposite is true.

Conclusion

CRIMINAL_LAW_HARCOURT_S19 ID: 675

Given 3.09 and 3.04.041, the prosecution likely has the strongest argument to establish second-degree
manslaughter. They can argue Thomas was reckless in having a belief in the imminency of the teens' threats and
can say that Thomas provoked force against him by insulting the teens. Still, given the subjective nature of
3.04's belief requirement, Thomas may evade liability, especially if someone like Zimmerman could get off
when there was an even more objective requirement in place there of a reasonable belief, although that case

was fraught with racial tensions.

PART 2

"Justice means treating everyone the same under the law, regardless of their circumstances, so that our law

provides as much fairness to every individual as possible."

This was my definition of justice on the first day of class, and I will argue that the course of our Criminal Law
class showed how wrong this definition was. My main argument will be that the definition of justice I originally
promoted was flawed because it was based on equality, which assumes that every individual starts life on the
same playing field. I will use the main cases of McClesky, McQuirter/Zimmerman, and State v. Norman to
argue for a new definition based on equity, instead--one that generally takes a wider time frame (in the refrain
of Kelman) to examine larger structural forces at play, such as racism and sexism, that impede justice and
necessitate taking individual life circumstances into account. I would change my definition to say, "Justice does
not mean treating everyone equally, for that is impossible in a society that is not structured equally from the
start. Rather, justice takes into account our background/identities in the context of structural power, for only

then can fairness truly be achieved."

McCklesky v. Kemp was the first case that opened my eyes to the need to change my definition of justice, and
the death penalty jurisprudence in general shows how wrong my original definition was. The central tensions of
the death penalty are a debate between individualized sentencing (to maximize dignity) versus consistency,
which would demand mandatory sentencing. McClesky exemplifies this tension. I would use my new definition
of justice to argue his racial background needs to be taken into account, which would push me toward
individualized sentencing or really , toward the eradication of the death penalty as a whole given the infeasibility
of this. The case discussed the Baldus study, which was a statistical study that showed defendants who were
charged with killing white victims were 4.3 times as likely to receive a death sentence as defendants charged
with killing black people, and that black defendants with white victims have the greatest likelihood of the death
penalty. McClesky was a black man charged with killing a white police officer, so all the evidence suggests that
he would be more likely than others to receive the death penalty. My original definition of justice would have
probably reinforced the outcome of the case, which was that there was no constitutional violation in

McClesky's sentence, because my first definition was predicated on the idea that everyone should be treated.

equally, which probably would have excluded taking racial considerations into account. However, after reading
Brennan's dissent, which contextualized the case by pointing to the courts' historical role in segregation, I began
to realize that my definition ignored the history undergirding the oppression of black and brown people. My
new definition of justice would thus change the outcome of the case by saying that the statistical study needs to
be taken into account to prove the unconstitutionality of the sentence. Opponents would dispute this and argue
that race should not be taken into account because a jury, for instance, is not looking at 200 years of slavery
when making their case but is rather, judging the individual on the facts of the case, as it should be. Instead,
they would say we should just push for more diverse juries then. However, as Lawrence explains in the "Id, the
Ego, and Equal Protection," racism is not just done by individuals, but it is structural. Even if we used the voir
dire process to exclude "racist" jurors, we would not be doing an accurate job because it is really difficult to
prove discriminatory intent not just in our laws, but in our own selves. Even a racially-mixed jury then could
dole out a death sentence for a black man on a higher basis (subconsciously, perhaps), which "legitimizes the
continued existence of racially and economically discriminatory conditions" (Lawrence). To remedy this, justice
thus needs us to look at structural disparities because the death penalty is yes, like a strike of lighting, yet that
strike of lighting happens to strike black men more frequently...and there is an insidious reason for that.

The cases of McQuirter and Zimmerman similarly call for my renewed definition of justice that takes structural
power into account, although McQuirter would, at first glance, seem to undermine my definition of equity and
previous example. In that case, McQuirter was accused of attempting to assault/rape a white woman and AL
law said that intent was a jury question that allowed for an inquiry into social conditions to be taken into
account, meaning that the jury was allowed to take racial differences into account (such as the fact that here, a
black man was in physical proximity to a white woman). These jury instructions though actually rebut against
my new definition because they were used to reinforce the social order as it was and had been; the case even
cited antebellum slave cases like Kelly v. State and Lewis v. State. My old definition of justice would have
disallowed these racist instructions, but my new definition actually does a better job of doing so because it
requires taking structural power into account rather than the perspective of narrow-minded jurors on an
individual level. My new definition would call for an examination into AL social conditions but only to show the
dark history of black men being falsely accused of raping white women. Subsequently, perhaps this would call
for a higher burden of proof/level of scrutiny to be used to ensure that McQuirter was treated fairly because
again, it is hard to prove invidious racial intent otherwise. Zimmerman's case is another stark example of this.
My new definition would have called for a higher level of examination to question the reasonableness of his fear
of Martin, a black man. Although an objective belief standard was used, we need to look into structural power
to see what forces are really at play, acknowledging that Martin started his life on an unequal playing field

because of his skin color.

Finally, the battered women cases show the need for equitable, rather than equal, justice. My old definition
would have treated the female defendants like male defendants; in Norman, it would have reinforced the

CRIMINAL_LAW_HARCOURT_S19 ID: 675

outcome that killing someone in their sleep does not lend itself to a "reasonable belief" in imminent harm. My
new definition would have examined the structural power of men in their relationship to women to show that the
defendant WAS reasonable in her belief. Studies show just how often women who leave their abusers are

killed and how difficult it is to escape the cycle of abuse.

As Bryan Stevenson articulated in Just Mercy, "the opposite of poverty is not wealth, it's justice." To truly fix

our broken criminal justice system, we need a definition of justice that focuses on a broader understanding of

forces underlying our social order so we can avoid the current veridiction and reinforcement of the antebellum
social order (Foucault). This would maximize utilitarianism by avoiding incarcerating individuals who could be
productive members of society but for their gender/race, and provide better guidance to assess moral

culpability under a retributivist theory.
