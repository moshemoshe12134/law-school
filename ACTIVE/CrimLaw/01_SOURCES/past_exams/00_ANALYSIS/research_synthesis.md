## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive analysis of Harcourt's publications from 2023-2025, several key themes have emerged that are likely to appear on the Spring 2026 Criminal Law exam. This synthesis extracts those themes and maps them to potential exam scenarios.

## Key Theoretical Frameworks (Recent Emphasis)

### 1. Coöperism (2023-2025)
**Source:** *Cooperation: A Political, Economic, and Social Theory* (2023), Coöperism 13/13 seminar

**Core Concepts:**
- "Cooperation" as successor paradigm to "punishment"
- Ex ante structural interdependence vs. ex post punishment
- Three pillars: Political (cooperation democracy), Economic (worker co-ops), Social (abolition as creation)

**Exam Relevance:**
- Could appear as policy essay question
- Connects to abolition themes in past exams
- Offers alternative to standard punishment theory analysis

### 2. The Modern Counterrevolution (2024-2025)
**Source:** "A Modern Counterrevolution" (The Ideas Letter, May 2025), "Hegel and the Heritage Foundation"

**Core Concepts:**
- Counterinsurgency (COIN) logic applied to domestic politics
- Tripartite structure: Active Insurgent, Neutral Majority, Active Counter-Insurgent Minority
- "Daily miniature coups" as governing style
- Project 2025 mapped onto Hegel's *Philosophy of Right*

**Exam Relevance:**
- May inform how Harcourt frames current events in exam fact patterns
- Could connect to policing/protest scenarios
- "Internal enemies" concept relates to status crimes analysis

### 3. Expository Society (2024-2025)
**Source:** Continuation of *Exposed* (2015) framework applied to AI era

**Core Concepts:**
- Voluntary data disclosure replaces state surveillance
- Algorithmic "ratchet effect" in policing
- "Prediction Society" - virtual self matters more than actual self

**Exam Relevance:**
- Could appear in fact patterns involving digital surveillance
- Connects to predictive policing themes
- May inform questions about actuarial risk assessment

### 4. Punishment as Human Experimentation (2023-2025)
**Source:** "Human Experimentation in Alabama" (Jan 2024), nitrogen hypoxia litigation

**Core Concepts:**
- New execution methods as experimental state violence
- Biopolitics - sovereign display of public torment
- Death penalty as assertion of power, not justice

**Exam Relevance:**
- Connects to Eighth Amendment/cruel and unusual punishment
- May inform death penalty questions
- Links to Foucault's spectacle of punishment

---

## Recurring Classroom Themes That May Appear

### From Marx 13/13 (2024-2025):
- Crime as constructed to protect property/hierarchy (Marx's "thefts of wood")
- Punishment as enforcing property relations, not crime control
- Law as tool of domination masked as neutral

### From Foucault (ongoing):
- Disciplinary power and microphysics of power
- Punishment as spectacle (public executions -> prison -> digital surveillance)
- Knowledge produced by power relations, not objective truth

## Predicted Exam Scenarios Based on Research

### Scenario A: Policing/Protest + Counterrevolution Framework
**Likelihood:** HIGH
**Format:** Issue-spotter memo
**Possible Facts:** Protesters arrested, charged with disorderly conduct or obstruction
**Issues:**
- Vagueness/arbitrary enforcement (Morales framework)
- Status of being a protester as target
- Free speech vs. criminal law

### Scenario B: AI/Predictive Policing + Expository Society
**Likelihood:** MEDIUM-HIGH
**Format:** Issue-spotter or policy essay
**Possible Facts:** Risk assessment tool used for bail/sentencing
**Issues:**
- Algorithmic discrimination (McCleskey + AI)
- "Risk" as proxy for race (Harcourt's *Against Prediction* arguments)
- Due process challenges to black-box algorithms

### Scenario C: Housing/Homelessness + Coöperism
**Likelihood:** MEDIUM
**Format:** Issue-spotter (similar to 2024 but evolved)
**Possible Facts:** Criminalization of homelessness continues, but maybe with "cooperative" solution offered
**Issues:**
- Robinson v. California status crime analysis
- Eighth Amendment (cruel and unusual to punish poverty)
- Coöperism as alternative paradigm (policy essay connection)

### Scenario D: Death Penalty + Human Experimentation
**Likelihood:** MEDIUM
**Format:** Policy essay or issue-spotter
**Possible Facts:** New execution method or botched execution
**Issues:**
- Eighth Amendment evolving standards of decency
- Punishment as spectacle (Foucault)
- Biopolitics and sovereign power

## Policy Essay Predictions

### Most Likely Topics:
1. **Foucault + Digital Surveillance** - Expository society, voluntary disclosure, carceral expansion through technology
2. **Coöperism vs. Punishment Paradigm** - Ex ante prevention through cooperation vs. ex post punishment
3. **Abolition as Creation** - Not just closing prisons but building cooperative structures
4. **Counterinsurgency Policing** - How COIN logic imported to domestic law enforcement

### Less Likely But Possible:
- Marx and the genealogy of crime (property protection)
- Hegel and the family (Project 2025 connections)
- Prediction society and loss of autonomy

---

## Connection to Past Exams

### 2024 Q1 (Homelessness Ordinance):
- Robinson/Powell/Morales framework remains relevant
- Status crimes analysis continues to be central
- Foucault's "relations of power" directly applicable

### 2024 Q2 (Foucault Essay):
- Foucault remains central to policy essays
- Themes of legitimation, spectacle, power-knowledge continue
- Students comfortable using Foucault passages

### 2025 Q2 (Crystalline Structure):
- Connects to Kelman time-framing, Balkin dyads
- Harcourt's interest in how law constructs reality
- Links to newer "cooperation" framework

## Office Hours Questions Based on Research

### For Status Crimes (Robinson/Powell):
"Professor, when we apply Robinson today, should we understand it through the lens of your recent work on how crime is constructed to protect property relations? Does this change how we think about the line between status and act?"

### For Foucault/Power:
"Professor, in your work on the expository society, you describe how voluntary disclosure replaces state surveillance. How does this change Foucault's analysis of disciplinary power? Are we still in a disciplinary society or something new?"

### For Abolition:
"Professor, in Coöperism, you frame abolition as creation rather than just destruction. How should we apply this framework to traditional criminal law reform questions about sentencing or policing?"

### For AI/Algorithms:
"Professor, your 'risk as proxy for race' argument from *Against Prediction* seems even more relevant with AI. Should we understand algorithmic bias as just a technical fix problem, or does it reveal something deeper about punishment itself?"
