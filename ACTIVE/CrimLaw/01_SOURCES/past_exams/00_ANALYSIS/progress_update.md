## What You Should Do Now

### 1. Read the Perfected Answers
Start with the 2024 and 2025 perfected answers. As you read:
- Notice the structure (IRAC for issue-spotters, clear sections for essays)
- Pay attention to how cases are used (not cited, but integrated)
- Note the balance of doctrine vs. policy
- Read the "Answer Breakdown" sections for learning tips

### 2. Take a Practice Exam (Optional but Recommended)
Try answering either 2024 Q1 or 2025 Q1 under timed conditions (90 minutes), then compare your answer to the perfected version. Look for:
- Did you identify all the issues?
- Was your rule statement complete?
- Did you address counterarguments?
- How was your structure compared to the perfected answer?

### 3. Review Office Hours Questions
The `research_synthesis.md` contains office hours questions you can ask Professor Harcourt based on his current research. These demonstrate deep engagement with the material.

## What Comes Next

Based on the approved plan, the next phases are:

**Phase 2 (Week 2):** Process more priority tier exams (2019, 2016, 2015)

**Phase 3 (Week 3):** Create office hours questions database, topic frequency matrix

**Phase 4 (Week 4+):** Process pattern tier exams (2013, 2010, 2009, etc.)

**Phase 5 (Week 8+):** Generate predicted scenarios with prewritten answers

## Key Insights from 2024-2025 Analysis

### What Harcourt Tests

**Issue-Spotters (Q1):**
- Constitutional challenges (Eighth Amendment status crimes, Fourteenth Amendment due process)
- Omission liability with duty of care analysis
- "But for" causation in unusual contexts
- Time-framing as doctrinal tool (Kelman)

**Policy Essays (Q2):**
- Foucault's Discipline and Punish (power-knowledge, legitimation, spectacle)
- Balkin's crystalline structure (individualism vs. communalism dyads)
- Connection of theory to specific cases/doctrine
- Personal reflection on what law means

### Writing Style That Gets Rewarded

- **Immediate jump to core issues** - No wasted intro paragraphs
- **Professional memo format when specified** - TO/FROM/SUBJECT headers
- **Both prosecution and defense addressed** - Counterarguments required
- **Cases integrated, not cited** - "As held in Robinson..." with holding stated
- **Policy in doctrine questions** - Even issue-spotters need policy analysis
- **No bullet points** - Narrative form only
- **Word count discipline** - Stay within limits

## Next Time We Meet

When you're ready to continue, I can:
1. Process 2019, 2016, 2015 exams into perfected answers
2. Create the topic frequency matrix across all years
3. Build the office hours questions database
4. Generate predicted exam scenarios with prewritten answers

For now, focus on reading and understanding these 4 perfected answers. They represent the most recent exams and the clearest guidance from the professor (especially 2025, where he provided the memo as the "sample answer").
