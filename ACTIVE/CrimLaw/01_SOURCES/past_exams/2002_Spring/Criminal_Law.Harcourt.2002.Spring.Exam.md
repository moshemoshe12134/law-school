Question 1

In his recent book titled Unwanted Sex: The Culture of Intimidation and the Failure of Law,
Professor Stephen J. Schulhofer criticizes the existing law of rape and offers the following proposed

model statute:

SECTION 201. SEXUAL ASSAULT

(a)

(b)

(©)

An actor is guilty of sexual assault, a felony of the second degree, if he uses physical
force to compel another person to submit to an act of sexual penetration.

An actor is guilty of sexual assault, a felony of the second degree, if he commits an
act of sexual penetration with another person, when he knows that the victim is less
than thirteen years old.

An actor is guilty of aggravated sexual assault, a felony of the first degree, if he
violates subsection (a) of this section while using a weapon or if he violates
subsection (a) of this section and causes serious bodily harm to the victim.

SECTION 202. SEXUAL ABUSE

(a)

(b)

(©)

An actor is guilty of sexual abuse, a felony of the third degree, if he commits an act
of sexual penetration with another person, when he knows that he does not have the
consent of the other person.

Consent, for purposes of this section, means that at the time of the act of sexual
penetration there are words or conduct indicating affirmative, freely given permission
to the act of sexual penetration.

Consent is not freely given, for purposes of this section, whenever:

qd) the victim is physically helpless or mentally incapacitated; or

(2) the victim is at least thirteen years old but less than sixteen years old and the
actor is at least four years older than the victim; or

(3) the victim is at least sixteen years old but less than eighteen years old and the
actor is a parent, foster parent, guardian, or other person with supervisory or
disciplinary authority over the victim; or

(4) the actor obtains the victim’s consent by threatening to:
(i) inflict bodily injury on a person other than the victim or commit any

other criminal offense; or

Law School of Harvard University / 2001 - 2002

(ii) expose any secret tending to subject any person to hatred, contempt,
or ridicule, or to impair the credit or business repute of any person; or
(iii) violate any other right of the victim or inflict any other harm that
would not benefit the actor; or
(5) the actor obtains the victim’s consent by leading the victim to believe that he
is a person with whom the victim has been sexually intimate, or by
representing that the victim is in danger of physical injury or illness.

SECTION 203. CULPABILITY

(a) Recklessness. Whenever knowledge of a fact is required to convict an actor of
violating any provision of sections 201 or 202, the requirement of knowledge can be
met by proof that, at the time of his conduct, the actor was consciously aware of a
substantial and unjustifiable risk that the fact in question existed.

(b) Criminal Negligence. If the actor was not consciously aware of such a risk, he can
nonetheless be convicted of violating the provision in question, provided that the
prosecution proves that his failure to appreciate that risk involved a gross deviation
from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the actor’s
situation. If an actor is convicted of violating Article 201 on the basis of criminal
negligence, the offense shall be graded as a felony of the third degree. If an actor is
convicted of violating Article 202 on the basis of criminal negligence, the offense
shall be graded as a felony of the fourth degree.

Kk

Please write an essay that responds to the following four questions:

1. How does this statute compare to the rape statutes that we studied in class this
semester? How would you describe it along the dimensions of actus reus and mens
rea?

2. What are the strengths of the proposed statute?

3. What are the weaknesses of the proposed statute?

4. Would you support the proposed statute if you had the authority to decide what the

law of rape should be in your jurisdiction? Ifnot, are there manageable amendments
that you would propose? Or is the statute too defective overall to gain your support?

Question 2

During the second part of our class, I spent a lot of time trying to map out, by means of a
graph, the relationship between three different constitutional challenges to the admissibility of a
defendant’s statement to law enforcement—namely, the voluntariness challenge, the right to counsel
challenge, and the privilege against self-incrimination challenge.

In an essay, please set me straight. Please address the following set of questions:
Overall, was the graph useful in conveying information or was it misleading?

If it was misleading, what were the errors in the graphic representation? Were there any
dimensions that were missing from the graph? Were the two dimensions (the x and y axes)
inappropriate? If you feel that the graph was lacking, do you have an alternative two-dimensional
graph that you would propose?

If it was useful, what was successfully conveyed by the graph?

In thinking about this question, you will probably want to identify the key differences and
similarities between the three constitutional claims, and explore whether the graph is able to
communicate those key differences and similarities.

Question 3

On February 1, 2002, police officer John Lang of the Tallahassee Police Department Drug
Interdiction Program received an anonymous call in which the caller indicated that “tomorrow, on
the 12:45 p.m. Greyhound headed to Indianapolis, there will be a drug courier carrying drugs and
a gun in his clothes. He’s black and will be wearing baggy pants. He’ ll be carrying a blue duffle bag
carry-on. The drugs and gun, though, are on his person.”

On February 2, 2002, Jeff Drayton and Clinton Brown were passengers on a Greyhound bus
traveling from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to Indianapolis. Neither had any checked luggage. They
were traveling together. They were both African-American, in their early 20s. They bought their
bus tickets with cash. Brown had a crimson carry-on duffle bag. Drayton had no carry-on luggage.
They were both wearing baggy pants and large jackets. At about noon, the bus made a scheduled
stop at the Greyhound bus terminal in Tallahassee, Florida. Drayton and Brown and other passengers
were required to exit the bus.

Law School of Harvard University / 2001 - 2002

The Tallahassee Police Department Drug Interdiction Team generally goes to the bus station
twice daily, at 5:00 a.m. and noon, to intercept buses arriving from South Florida. On this date,
officer Lang and two other police officers, Blackburn, and Hoover, arrived before noon and watched
passengers deboard the arriving buses. The officers had a drug dog with them, who was sniffing the
passengers, but the dog did not react as any of the passengers deboarded.

As Drayton and Brown reboarded, the driver collected their tickets, while the officers
observed. There were approximately 25-30 passengers on the 47-passenger bus. Once passengers
were seated, the driver left to complete the departure process. The driver turned the bus over to the
three officers, saying "It's all yours."

The bus was scheduled to depart at 12:45 p.m. At approximately 12:40 p.m., after passengers
were seated, the three officers boarded the bus for the purpose of obtaining consent to search
luggage. They did not have a warrant. Lang and the two other officers were wearing badges on
chains around their necks. They were wearing plain clothes. All wore guns in side holsters and
handcuffs. Hoover boarded the bus first and knelt in the driver's seat looking over the plexiglass
back to watch passengers' reactions. Blackburn and Lang then entered behind Hoover and walked
to the back of the bus. The officers did not make any general announcement identifying themselves
or explaining what they were doing on the bus. Nor did the officers at any time inform passengers
they had a right to refuse to talk to the officers, to have their bags searched, or to be frisked.

At the back of the bus, Blackburn and Lang worked forward as a team. While Lang observed,
Blackburn spoke to the passenger in the very rear seat, a young white man in his 20s. Blackburn
identified himself and obtaining consent to check his luggage. That passenger's carry-on bag was
searched, but no contraband was found. Lang then began working forward, with Blackburn
observing and assisting. Lang talked with the passenger in the next seat forward, a young black
woman in her 20s, but decided he did not need to check her. Lang moved to the passenger across
the aisle, a young black man in his 30s. Lang identified himself, asked for consent and was given
consent to check his luggage. That passenger's bag was searched, but no contraband was found.

Lang then approached Drayton and Brown. They were seated on the driver's side of the bus.
Drayton was in the aisle seat, and Brown by the window. Lang observed that they were black and
wearing baggy pants. Lang stood with his back to the front of the bus and facing the back of the bus
and approaching them from in front of Drayton's right shoulder. An overhead luggage rack extended
over both seats, requiring the inside passenger to duck his head to stand up or get out. Lang's face
was 12 to 18 inches from Drayton's and a couple of feet over from Brown.

Lang held up his badge to show that he was a police officer and announced, addressing

Brown and Drayton: “I'm Investigator Lang out of the Tallahassee Police Department. We're
conducting bus interdiction to make sure there's no weapons or drugs on the bus. We would like for

Law School of Harvard University / 2001 - 2002

your cooperation. Do you have any luggage on the bus?”

Lang never asked, as a question, whether they would cooperate. Both Drayton and Brown
pointed to the crimson carry-on. Lang turned to them and said, "I’Il check it if you don’t mind.”
Brown said, "Go ahead."

Lang retrieved the bag and handed it to Blackburn, who searched it. No contraband was
found. Lang, who had noticed that Brown and Drayton were both wearing large jackets and baggy
pants, recalled the anonymous tip. He also found it kind of odd because the weather was relatively
warm. He also found their style of dress significant because people had been known to carry
weapons or narcotics on their person. (Lang's report states: "This is a known area to conceal drugs
while traveling on the bus"). The weather that day in Tallahassee was 63 degrees, and in
Indianapolis 35 degrees.

Lang then asked Brown, "I’d like to check your person for weapons. Okay?" Brown
responded, "Sure." Brown then leaned up, took a cell phone out of his pocket, and held open his
jacket. Lang's report states: "I checked the coat and then the waist area of Brown. I proceeded to
check his groin area and touched an unknown object in that area." Lang first patted down Brown's
jacket, then asked Brown to lean forward and frisked behind him, and then frisked Brown from his
waist to his thighs, including the groin or upper part of the legs. According to his report, Lang felt
“hard objects that were not part of his anatomy.” Lang asked Brown "did he mind standing up," and
Brown stepped past Drayton into the aisle. Lang signaled for Hoover to come to the back. Hoover
escorted Brown off the bus.

Lang then turned his focus to Drayton and asked, ""Mind if I check you?" Drayton lifted his
hands about eight inches off his legs. Lang then searched Drayton and, in the groin area,"felt the
same thing with him." (Lang Report) Lang asked Drayton to stand, and escorted him off the bus.
Lang also retrieved Brown’s carry-on from the bus.

Drayton and Brown were escorted to an adjacent parking lot and read their Miranda rights.
The officers then unbuttoned their pants. Brown was wearing several pairs of boxer shorts with
bundles of cocaine taped between layers. Brown had three packages containing 483 grams of
cocaine. In addition, Brown had a small, .22 caliber semi-automatic pistol taped to his boxers.
[According to a ballistics expert, the .22 caliber pistol had been modified to hold six rounds of
ammunition, had no safety lock, and would fire a shot each time you pulled the trigger, with anormal
trigger pull]. Drayton was found to have a cell phone in his front pant pockets.

Lang pulled the gun off Brown’s boxers, and as he did so, Brown grabbed his hand and began

to struggle. Hoover grabbed his gun out of his holster. As Lang and Brown fell to the ground,
Brown grabbed the pistol from Lang’s hand, placing his hand around the gun and the trigger. The

gun fired two shots. The first shot hit Drayton in the foot. Drayton fell to the floor in front of
Hoover. The second shot hit Hoover on his hand, throwing Hoover’s gun to the floor. Hoover’s gun
went off, hitting Drayton in the chest. Blackburn then tackled Brown and handcuffed him.

Hoover then lunged toward Brown in a fit of rage, yelling at Brown: “You’re one sick dude
and you’re going down.” Lang restrained Hoover, pushing him away. Visibly upset at the sight of
Drayton bleeding, Brown then said to Hoover, “Look buddy, I’d have gotten you if I had had the
chance.” Blackburn then smacked Brown on the back of the head with the grip of his gun. As
Brown lay on the floor bleeding, Lang read Brown his Miranda rights, and cuffed him. Brown said
“Yeah, and I want that lawyer.” Lang then called an ambulance. Drayton was placed in the
ambulance when it arrived, but died on the way to the hospital. Brown was treated for head injuries
with twenty stitches.

Lang visited Brown in the hospital three days later. After Mirandizing Brown, he began
asking him questions. Brown told him “Listen, it was an accident. I didn’t mean to shoot anyone.
The gun went off by accident. Drayton was my best friend.” Lang told Brown they would prosecute
him to the full extent of the law.

KOK

Please answer the following questions. Assume you are in Florida and there is a state felony
statute prohibiting the knowing possession of cocaine in excess of 100 grams. The Florida state
homicide statute is attached as Appendix A.

1. The District Attorney wants to charge Brown under the Florida homicide statute and
the possession of cocaine statute. She turns to you, the Assistant District Attomey,
to prosecute the case. What charge(s) will you bring against Brown? What evidence
will you try to introduce at trial in support of the charge(s)?

2. If you were appointed to represent Brown, how would you defend against the
charge(s)?

3. As the Assistant District Attorney (again), how would you respond to the defense
challenges?

If you decide to charge Brown with more than one offense, I would suggest that you treat
each charge separately, i.e. that you answer the three questions for each offense before moving on
to the next offense. That should make your presentation more organized. Also, if you need to repeat
a point you have already made, you may refer me to your earlier discussion.
