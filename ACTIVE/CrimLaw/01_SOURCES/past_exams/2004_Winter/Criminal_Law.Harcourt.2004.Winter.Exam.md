CRIMINAL LAW — CourRSsE No. 30301
PROFESSOR BERNARD E. HARCOURT

FALL 2003 — WINTER 2004

Final Examination

This is an open-book, three-hour, in-class examination. This examination consists of
9 pages (including this cover sheet). You may refer to written materials, but you may not
confer with anyone else. In other words, I’m expecting you to rely on your genius alone. You
may not speak or consult in any way with any other person during the exam.

There are three questions and you must respond to all three questions. The
examination will be graded 1/3 on each question, so 1 would recommend spending one hour
on each question.

You may answer the questions in any order that suits you. Please begin the answers
to each question on a new page, noting clearly the question that you are responding to. Each
exam answer page should include a header containing your student exam number, the name
of the examination, and the pagination, specifying the last page (e.g. “Page 3 of 8"). Please
double space your answers with one inch margins and use a 12 point New Times Roman font.

Your answers should be specifically tailored to my questions. You should not cut and
paste any materials from your notes. In fact, if you feel tempted to cut and paste materials
from your notes, you should immediately think to yourself that the materials are not
sufficiently tailored to the question that I am asking. I am not interested in unnecessary or
irrelevant background information.

Please work on your organization, structure, argumentation and presentation. In each
question, I have provided you with a possible structure for your response. Please either use
that structure or a better one.

Thank you. Have a great break when you’re done with exams!

Question #1:

The French Penal Code of 1810 was the last of the Napoleonic code series, and, surprisingly,
lasted with relatively minor revisions until 1992 when a new Penal Code was adopted in France. The
Penal Code of 1810 was crafted at the height of Napoleon’s regime. It reflected the movement
toward penal reform that swept through parts of Europe and the United States. In fact, as one
commentator writes, “for more than half of the 19" Century, it stood as the most frequently followed
model of criminal codification.”

This is from an English translation of the French Penal Code of 1810, as amended 1959, in
effect in the year 1960. The following provisions from Title Il (Felonies and Misdemeanors against
Private persons), Chapter 1 (Felonies and Misdemeanors against the Person) relate to homicide:

Article 295: Willful homicide is murder

Article 296: Every murder committed with premeditation or by lying in wait is an assassination.
Article 297: Premeditation consists of an aforethought decision to make a homicidal attack on a
certain person or anyone encountered, regardless of any circumstances or conditions on which the

act may be dependent.

Article 298: Lying in wait consists of waiting for whatever length of time in one or several places
for a person either to kill, or to inflict violence upon, him.

Article 299: The murder of a father or a mother, either legitimate, natural or by adoption, or any
other legitimate ancestor, is parricide.

Article 300: The murder or assassination of a newly born child is an infanticide.

Article 301: Any attempt against the life of a person by substances capable of causing death more
or less quickly, however the substances are applied or administered, and whatever their effect, is
poisoning.

Article 302: Any person guilty of assassination, parricide or poisoning, shali be punished by death.
However, the mother, be she the principal or the accessory to the assassination or murder of her
newly born child, shall be punished by hard labor for a limited time, provided that this provision is
not applicable to her co-principal or accessory.

Professor Bernard E. Harcourt: Criminal Law March 12, 2004

Article 303: Any perpetrators who in committing a felony employ torture or cruelty shall be
punished as for assassination.

Article 304: Murder, preceded, accompanied or followed by another felony, shall be punished by
death. Murder shall also be punished by death when its purpose is either to prepare, facilitate or
commit a misdemeanor, or to further the escape, or to bring about the impunity of principals or
accessories to the misdemeanor. In all other cases, the person guilty of murder shall be punished by
hard labor for life.

Article 309: Any person who intentionally wounds or strikes, or commits any other violence or
assault resulting in the impairment of the physical well-being. . . shall be punished by hard labor for
a limited time when the violence or wound, intentionally inflicted, resulted in an unintended death.

Article 310: In the case of premeditation or lying in wait, the punishment shall be hard labor for life,
if death results. . .

Article 319: Any person who by lack of skill, imprudence, carelessness, negligence or failure to
observe regulations, involuntarily commits or brings about a homicide, shall be punished by jailing
from three months to two years and by fine of 100,000 to 2,000,000 francs.

Article 321: Murder, wounding or striking are excusable if provoked by serious strikes or violence
against the person.

Article 323: Parricide is never excusable.

Article 324: Murder of one’s spouse is not excusable if the life of the spouse who commits the
murder was not endangered at the very moment of the murder. However, in cases of adultery, the
murder of one’s spouse, as well as of the accessory, at the very moment of discovery in the very act

in the matrimonial home, is excusable.

Article 325: The felony of castration if committed immediately and actually in response to a violent
indecent assault, shall be regarded as excusable murder or wounding.

Article 326: After factual proof of the excuse: in cases of felony subject to a punishment of death,
hard labor for life or transportation, the punishment shall be reduced to jailing from one to five years;

Page 3 of 9


The University of Chicago Law School
Professor Bernard E. Harcourt: Criminal Law March 12, 2004

in case of any other felony, the punishment shall be reduced to jailing from six months to two years.

Article 328: When the homicide, wounding or striking was compelled by the immediate and actual
necessity to defend oneself or another, no felony or misdemeanor has been committed.

Article 329: The circumstances of immediate and actual necessity include the following: 1.
Homicide, wounding or striking, committed, at night time, in repelling a person scaling or breaking
down fences, walls or entrances of inhabited dwelling-houses or apartments, or of their curtilage.
2. Acts committed in defending oneself or another against violent burglars or pillagers.

Please write an essay that responds to the following questions:

1. How does the Penal Code of 1810 compare to the modern American statutory approach to
homicide that we studied in class this year taken as a whole? In other words, if you view the
modern (post-1950s) murder and justification/excuse statutes and cases that we read in class
(including naturally the Model Penal Code) as representative of modern American homicide
law, how does the French Penal Code of 1810 resemble and/or differ from the modern
American approach?

2. Now, taking the statutory approaches that we studied in class more individually, which
statutory approach does the Penal Code of 1810 resemble the most? Which statutory
approach does it resemble the least?

3. What are the strengths of the Penal Code of 1810?

4. What are the weaknesses of the Penal Code of 1810?

5. If you were given the authority to enact a new homicide and justification/excuse statute in
your jurisdiction, would you model it on any portions of the Penal Code of 1810? Which

portions of the Penal Code of 1810 would you find acceptable? Which portions of the Penal
Code of 1810 would not be acceptable? Please explain.

Question #2:

The following account has been prepared for you by the lead investigator of a joint FB/SEC
investigative team looking into the sale of ImClone Systems stock in December 2001.

ok ok

On January 2, 2002, this FBI/SEC task force began conducting an official investigatory
proceeding into the sale of any and all shares of ImClone Systems, a biotechnology company, within
the week preceding December 28, 2001. On December 28, 2001, Samuel D. Waksal, CEO of
ImClone Systems, announced disappointing news regarding the company—an adverse ruling for its
cancer drug Erbitux—that made the ImClone share price plunge. Dr. Waksal has pleaded guilty to
several federal crimes for orchestrating sales of ImClone stock by his relatives just prior to his public
announcement and is serving a seven-year prison sentence.

Martha Stewart, 62, founder of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, with a net worth at the
time of over a billion dollars, sold 3,928 shares of ImClone Systems on December 27, 2001, for
approximately $228,000. The stock sale netted her about $45,000. Martha Stewart is a close friend
of Dr. Waksal. Peter E. Bacanovic, 41, is a Merrill Lynch stock broker and is both Martha Stewart’s
and Dr. Waksal’s broker. From 1990 to 1992, Mr. Bacanovic worked at ImClone in various areas
of business development and marketing. Mr. Bacanovic became a broker at Merrill Lynch in 1993
and became one of the firm's top-producing brokers. Mr. Bacanovic met Ms. Stewart through her
daughter, Alexis, while the two were college students. Mr. Bacanovic also received a reference for
Martha Stewart’s business from Ms. Stewart’s friend, Dr. Waksal. At Merrill Lynch, Mr. Bacanovic
was also helped by a good word from his brother, Paul Bacanovic, who was an investment banker
at Merrill Lynch.

The Stewart and Waksal sales of ImClone immediately caught the attention of compliance
officers at Merrill Lynch, who on December 31, 2001 asked Mr. Bacanovic about it. Mr. Bacanovic
said it had something to do with tax-loss selling. Unsatisfied with Bacanovic's account, Merrill
Lynch reported the activity to the SEC, which opened this investigation.

Martha Stewart's assistant, Ann E. Armstrong, has told federal investigators that she took a
telephone message on her computer about ImClone from Mr. Bacanovic’s office on Dec. 27, 2001.
The message said,"Peter Bacanovic thinks ImClone is going to start trading downward." Ms.
Armstrong also told investigators that on January 31, 2002, Ms. Stewart partly erased the message
on Ms. Armstrong’s computer after a telephone conversation with her lawyer. “She highlighted to
the end of Peter's name, and then she started typing over that,” Armstrong said. “She was sitting at
my desk, and I was watching behind her.” She said Ms. Stewart had a visible reaction to seeing the

The University of Chicago Law School
Professor Bernard E. Harcourt: Criminal Law March 12, 2004

message on the screen, and added, “The abruptness with which she reacted to it indicates
something.” Ms. Armstrong said that within moments of altering the message, Ms. Stewart asked
her to “put it back the way it was.” The message typed into the office phone log by Ms. Armstrong
on the morning of Dec. 27, 2001, read, "Peter Bacanovic thinks ImClone is going to start trading
downward." On Jan. 31, 2002, Ms. Stewart rewrote it to read: "Peter Bacanovic re imclone," Ms.
Armstrong said. After Ms. Stewart asked her to restore the message to its original form, Ms.
Armstrong said, she could not at first find the original message, and simply cleaned up the
punctuation in what Ms. Stewart had typed, capitalizing ImClone, for instance. Eventually she came
across an old file that held the original text, she said, and made paper copies of what she found. Ms.
Armstrong also said that Ms. Stewart called her to see if she had been able to recover the deleted part
of the message. "She said, ‘Were you able to get it back?’" Armstrong said. "I said no. I didn't say,
not yet. I didn't know at that point if I'd be able to get it back.”

Peter Bacanovic’s assistant, Douglas Faneuil, told federal investigators that he handled Ms.
Stewart's trade and that Mr. Bacanovic told him to tell her on December 27, 2001, that members of
the Waksal family were selling their stock. According to Faneuil, on December 26, 2001, Dr.
Waksal got wind that the FDA was going to reject his company's application to move forward with
its drug. The Waksal family sent word to Peter Bacanovic, their broker, through Faneuil, and tried
to sell $ 7.3 million of ImClone stock. Peter Bacanovic was on vacation in Florida on Dec. 27, 2001,
but Douglas Faneuil, his assistant, relayed the message from Dr. Waksal to him, prompting
Bacanovic, according to Faneuil, to exclaim, “Oh, my God, get Martha on the phone!” Martha
Stewart was traveling to a resort in Mexico with her friend Mariana Pasternak. But through a series
of phone calls with Faneuil, she learned what Waksal was up to. She called Faneuil, who told her
Bacanovic thought she might like to act on the information, which she did, asking Faneuil to sell her
shares. Mr. Faneuil indicated to agents that he had a later conversation with Mr. Bacanovic in which
Mr. Bacanovic “encouraged me (Douglas Faneuil) to refrain from disclosing that I had informed
Martha Stewart on Dec. 27, 2001, of the sale and attempted sale of the Waksal shares.”

Mariana Pasternak, a longtime friend of Ms. Stewart who was traveling with her to Mexico
on the day Ms. Stewart sold her ImClone shares, has told federal agents that Ms. Stewart told her that
members of the Waksal family were selling their shares. Ms. Pasternak said that she believed she
also heard Ms. Stewart say, "Isn't it nice to have brokers who tell you these things?" a few days later.
According to subpoenaed telephone records, Martha Stewart telephoned Dr. Waksal after she made
her trade, leaving a message that read "Something is going on with ImClone and she wants to know
what?"

Ms. Stewart and Mr. Bacanovic maintain, in separate interviews with federal agents, that they

had an existing agreement to sell her ImClone shares if the price fell below $60 a share. There was
no automatic sell order entered into Merrill Lynch computers, and no record of any other kind of

Page 6 of 9



The University of Chicago Law School
Professor Bernard E. Harcourt: Criminal Law March 12, 2004

formal agreement. They both maintain that it was an informal agreement and that Bacanovic would
watch the stock to see when it dipped below $60.

In interviews with investigators from the SEC on January 7" and 13", 2002, Mr. Bacanovic
said he had tried hard to persuade Ms. Stewart to sell the stock prior to December 2001, and she
reluctantly agreed on the $60 price. Of course, she never thought it would, he said in the interview,
which was tape-recorded.

In interviews with federal agents at a meeting on February 4", 2002, and another meeting on
April 10°, 2002, Martha Stewart maintained that she did not receive information concerning Waksal
family stock sales. When investigators asked her on Feb. 4, 2002, whether a phone message that Mr.
Bacanovic left for her on the day of her ImClone trade was recorded, she said "I do not know." An
investigator for the SEC describes interviewing Ms. Stewart about her stock trade, citing that phone
message in particular. “She was asked whether there was a written record of the message Peter
Bacanovic had left for her, and she said she didn't know," the investigator, Helene Glotzer, said. “She
said she barely recalled Ms. Armstrong telling her that Mr. Bacanovic had called and wanted to
speak to her before the end of the day.”

Ms. DeLuca, who is Ms. Stewart's business manager, told federal investigators that Martha
Stewart and Mr. Bacanovic discussed setting a $60 or $61 price target for Ms. Stewart's ImClone
stock in November 2001, and Ms. DeLuca produced a document to support that. The document is
a work sheet listing Ms. Stewart's stock holdings, with "@60" next to ImClone and written in ink
that experts report is different from the ink used for other notations on that page.

A prosecution and conviction against Ms. Stewart would be a terrible blow to her. She rose
from humble working-class roots in Nutley, N.J., to create a catering company that has come to
embody her clean-cut, vaguely patrician style. She turned that into a conglomerate of publishing,
television and merchandising businesses, all of them bearing her name and, usually, her photograph
as well. She took her company public in 1999, as the Internet excitement peaked, and overnight
became a billionaire, at least on paper. All that could be jeopardized with a guilty verdict, at least
as far as Ms. Stewart's signature control is concerned. She would almost certainly be required to step
down as an officer and director of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, although she could continue
to hold the majority of the voting shares, as she does now.

As for Mr. Bacanovic, it does seem that he conveyed information to Martha Stewart about
Waskal family sales because Ms. Stewart was a prime client. Friends of Mr. Bacanovic describe him
as obsessed with pleasing his friends and doing the right thing for clients. He hired Mr. Faneuil as
his assistant, in fact, at the bidding of aclose friend. From conversations with other brokers, putting
the customer first is a mantra that is repeated at all the major brokerage houses, including Mernill

Lynch. Mr. Bacanovic seems to have taken this dictum too much to heart, advising her that ImClone
Systems stock was falling and, in the process, breaking confidentiality rules at Merrill Lynch and
possibly sharing inside information. According to industry experts, it’s the kind of call that only top
clients get. "You want to do the right thing for the client, but not break the law," says Robert J.
Ostrowski, a former stock broker at Merrill Lynch. "I remember our chief executive always saying,
‘the customer's interest always comes first.’ I think if Bacanovic had to do it again, though, he would
let that stock go down the drain."

Assume this is a federal case being brought in federal court, and that the federal criminal
statutes that we studied in class apply. For purposes of any substantive offense (such as homicide,
rape, theft, etc.) and for purposes of attempt, general conspiracy, complicity, and justification and
excuses, assume that the federal government has adopted the Model Penal Code.

1. You are the United States Attorney. You want to prosecute this case fully and fairly.
What charge(s) will you bring against which individual(s)?

2. If you were the Federal Defender in the district, how would you defend against the
charge(s)?

3. As the United States Attorney (again), how would you respond to the defense
challenges?

As an organizational matter, please structure your responses in the following manner:
I. With regard to Defendant X:

A. Charge #1:
qd) U.S. Attorney position
(2) Federal Defender position
(3) US. Attorney position

B. Charge #2:
qd) U.S. Attorney position

(2) Federal Defender position
(3) USS. Attorney position

Question #3:

You will recall that we started the year reading a somewhat lengthy excerpt from an article
by Deborah Denno called Crime and Consciousness: Science and Involuntary Acts. In the article,
Denno argues that new scientific discoveries have eroded the clear line that divides consciousness
from unconsciousness, and she calls for anew legal approach to the issue of voluntariness of actions
in the criminal law.

We also discussed, later during the year, the different theories of punishment that have been
advanced to justify punishing persons convicted of criminal offenses.

Does Denno’s proposal for legal reform depend on any particular theory of punishment? In
other words, does her argument stand or fall depending on what theory of punishment we adopt?
Would the theory of punishment change or alter the standard that we should impose on the
voluntariness of actions in the criminal law context?

In an essay, please address this specific question. Please identify clearly the argument that
Denno develops and its relationship to theories of punishment, and please explain precisely how
theories of punishment should affect the way we think about Denno’s argument. Please also tell me
what you think: which theory of punishment makes the most sense to you, and how does it affect
your opinion of Denno’s legal reform project?
