**MEMORANDUM**

**TO:** Professor Harcourt
**FROM:** Research Assistant
**DATE:** [Spring 2024]
**RE:** Constitutional Analysis of NYC Anti-Camping Ordinance

### Introduction

The strongest arguments against the NYC anti-camping ordinance rest on two foundations: (1) the ordinance criminalizes the status of homelessness in violation of the Eighth Amendment, and (2) it permits arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The City's strongest counterarguments draw on Powell's distinction between status and act, and on the ordinance's textual specificity. On balance, the defendants have the stronger position, primarily because the voluntariness requirement cannot be satisfied when no shelter beds are available.

### Arguments for the Homeless Defendants

#### 1. Eighth Amendment: The Ordinance Criminalizes Status

**Robinson v. California** held that California could not make it a crime to "be addicted to the use of narcotics." The Court provided several possible rationales. First, the statute may have lacked an actus reus element—Robinson may not have committed any voluntary act in California. Second, the addiction itself may have been involuntary, undermining blameworthiness. Third, the Court may have believed that addiction demands medical treatment rather than criminal punishment. Fourth, punishment for status alone may be cruel and unusual.

The NYC ordinance criminalizes "camping on public property," defined as occupying a place where bedding is placed "for the purpose of maintaining a temporary place to live." When enforcement punishes homeless people for sleeping outside because no shelter beds are available, the ordinance effectively criminalizes the status of homelessness rather than any voluntary act.

This case is distinguishable from **Powell v. Texas**, which upheld a public intoxication conviction. In Powell, the Court narrowed Robinson to the actus reus rationale, holding that Powell "committed" the act of appearing in public drunk. The Court rejected arguments that Powell's alcoholism rendered his conduct involuntary, emphasizing that he voluntarily took the first drink. The Court also rejected the argument that alcoholics deserve treatment rather than punishment, citing concerns about indefinite institutionalization.

Here, unlike Powell, the City cannot identify a voluntary act that began the chain of events leading to sleeping outside. The homeless defendants sleep outside because shelter beds are unavailable—a circumstance entirely outside their control. TheMayor's own statements acknowledge the shelter crisis, with 92,879 homeless people competing for insufficient beds. When a person is turned away from shelter and has no private alternative, sleeping outside is not the product of voluntary choice.

The Kelman time-framing analysis strengthens this point. Under a narrow time-frame, the moment of falling asleep on a sidewalk may appear voluntary. But a broader frame reveals that the City itself—through disinvestment in public housing, failure to provide adequate shelter, and policies that drive up housing costs—created the conditions that make sleeping outside necessary. As we discussed in class, time-framing is not neutral; it reflects normative judgments about where responsibility should be located.

Additionally, the punishment for violating the ordinance—a $500 fine rising to $1,000, plus potential jail time for trespass—violates evolving standards of decency. Fining people who lack money serves no penological purpose and underscores that the ordinance punishes poverty itself. This aligns with the Robinson rationale that certain statuses warrant assistance rather than punishment.

#### 2. Fourteenth Amendment: Arbitrary and Discriminatory Enforcement

**City of Chicago v. Morales** invalidated a gang-loitering ordinance on two grounds. First, the ordinance failed to give adequate notice of what conduct was prohibited. Second, it encouraged arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. Only the second rationale received six votes; the vagueness rationale garnered only three.

The NYC ordinance suffers from the same arbitrariness problem. "Camping" is defined to include any place where bedding is placed "for the purpose of maintaining a temporary place to live." This definition captures a wide range of conduct—picnicking with a blanket in Central Park, napping on a bench during a lunch break, resting in a car. Police have nearly unfettered discretion to decide who is "camping" versus who is merely "resting."

That discretion will be exercised discriminatorily. Mayor Adams has stated he wants enforcement to "make it uncomfortable enough for the homeless people in our city so they will want to move out." This explicit targeting reveals that enforcement will focus on homeless people, not similarly situated non-homeless New Yorkers who engage in identical conduct. As in **Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville**, which struck down a vagrancy ordinance as a relic of Jim Crow, this law will be enforced based on police perceptions of who belongs.

The racial dimensions cannot be ignored. Given that 97% of those stopped under NYPD's stop-and-frisk were Black or Latinx, there is every reason to expect discriminatory enforcement here as well. The ordinance provides no objective standards to constrain this discretion.

The ordinance also raises notice concerns under Morales's minority rationale. Terms like "purpose of maintaining a temporary place to live" are sufficiently vague that a person cannot determine what conduct is prohibited. Is lying on a blanket in Central Park "maintaining a temporary place to live"? The lack of clarity forces homeless residents to guess at the line between legal and illegal conduct.

### Arguments for the City

#### 1. The Ordinance Criminalizes Conduct, Not Status

The City will argue that Powell controls. Just as public intoxication is an act that may disproportionately affect alcoholics but does not criminalize alcoholism, "camping on public property" is an act that may disproportionately affect homeless people but does not criminalize homelessness. The ordinance targets specific conduct—placing bedding, sleeping in a vehicle, sleeping on a bench—not the status of being homeless.

The City can also identify voluntary acts that led to the defendants' situation. For immigrant defendants, the act of coming to New York City began the chain of events. More broadly, the City can argue that defendants make daily choices about where to sleep, including accepting shelter beds when available or leaving the city.

Using a broad time-frame, the City can contend that somewhere in the causal chain, each defendant made voluntary choices that led to their current circumstances. This mirrors Powell's rejection of the argument that involuntary addiction negated the voluntariness of public intoxication.

#### 2. The Ordinance Is Sufficiently Narrow

Unlike the Morales ordinance, which prohibited "remaining in any one place with no apparent purpose," the NYC ordinance provides specific criteria: placement of bedding, sleeping in a vehicle, sleeping on a bench. This specificity limits police discretion and provides adequate notice. It resembles Chicago's revised post-Morales loitering ordinance, which the Court has permitted.

The City can also argue that legitimate government interests—public sanitation, fire safety, preventing obstruction of sidewalks—justify the ordinance. These are traditional police powers, and the ordinance is narrowly tailored to serve them.

### Evaluation

The defendants have the stronger arguments, primarily on voluntariness and arbitrary enforcement.

On voluntariness, the Powell analogy fails. Unlike Powell, who voluntarily consumed alcohol, these defendants have no comparable voluntary act that led to sleeping outside. Being turned away from a full shelter is not a voluntary choice. The City's effort to identify remote voluntary acts stretches time-framing beyond reason—Kelman's framework should be used to reveal, not conceal, normative judgments about responsibility.

The arbitrariness problem is equally serious. The Mayor's statements make clear that enforcement targets homeless people specifically, not conduct. When police may arrest a homeless person for "camping" while ignoring a non-homeless person napping on a blanket, the ordinance operates as a status crime regardless of its neutral text.

The City has responses—textual specificity, the Powell precedent, the availability of shelter or leaving the city. But these responses cannot overcome the reality that sleeping is a biological necessity and that the City has created a situation where thousands have no place to sleep. Punishing people for that reality violates both the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on status crimes and the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of equal protection.
