## Epigraph

> "Throughout the eighteenth century, inside and outside the legal apparatus, in both everyday penal practice and the criticism of institutions, one sees the emergence of a new strategy for the exercise of the power to punish [...]: not to punish less, but to punish better; to punish with an attenuated severity perhaps, but in order to punish with more universality and necessity; to insert the power to punish more deeply into the social order." (Discipline and Punish 81-82)

### Introduction

Foucault's passage captures the birth of the modern punitive order: the shift from spectacular punishment to disciplinary power, and the insertion of carceral logic into the very fabric of social life. The "new strategy" he identifies is not a reduction in punishment but its intensification and dispersion—punishment becomes more universal, more necessary, more deeply embedded. This passage illuminates three central themes from our classroom: (1) law as an instrument of racial and economic hierarchy, (2) the microphysics of power that disciplines us all, and (3) the legitimation rituals that mask punishment's true function.

### The Passage and Its Meaning

Foucault locates in the eighteenth century a transformation in the logic of punishment. Under the ancien régime, punishment was spectacular—public executions intended to demonstrate the sovereign's power. But this "economy of the power to punish" was inefficient. Crime was too visible; punishment was too intermittent; power was too concentrated in moments of violent display.

The "new strategy" emerged gradually: punish with "attenuated severity" (less torture, more prisons) but with "more universality and necessity" (more people under carceral supervision, more reasons to punish). The goal was not to abolish punishment but to insert it "more deeply into the social order"—to make it a routine, invisible, indispensable part of how we live.

This passage matters because it reveals that our current system is not the product of a gradual march toward enlightenment or justice. It is the product of a deliberate strategy to extend the reach of punishment, to make it more pervasive, to weave it into everyday life. The prison was only the most visible institution. Schools, factories, hospitals, military barracks—all adopted the same disciplinary techniques: surveillance, examination, normalizing judgment, and the corrective training of bodies.

### Theme One: Law as an Instrument of Racial and Economic Hierarchy

Foucault's insight that punishment serves to organize the social order helps us understand the racial and economic dimensions of criminal law. Law is not neutral arbiter but active participant in constructing and maintaining hierarchy.

We saw this in the regulation of slavery. In **State v. Clarissa**, the court treated a slave who killed her master as a "monster" deserving death, not because retribution demanded it but because the social order of slavery depended on it. The law constructed Clarissa as subhuman to justify executing a woman who killed the man who owned her. Punishment here was not about desert but about terror—demonstrating to all enslaved people that resistance meant death.

The same logic animated postbellum convict leasing. After the Civil War, Southern states criminalized Black behavior—vagrancy, "offensive language," failure to show deference to whites—and then leased Black convicts to private companies. The punishment regime of slavery was reconstituted through criminal law. Foucault's passage helps us see this not as a perversion of criminal law but as its true function: organizing social order through the management of bodies.

Today, mass incarceration continues this project. The War on Drugs, three-strikes laws, mandatory minimums—these are mechanisms for inserting punishment "more deeply into the social order" of poor communities of color. As Bryan Stevenson documents, we effectively have a caste system in this country, marked by criminal records that restrict employment, housing, voting rights. Punishment organizes hierarchy.

Even the death penalty serves this function. In **McCleskey v. Kemp**, the Court acknowledged overwhelming statistical evidence that race determines who lives and dies in Georgia's death chamber. But the Court refused to provide relief, warning that recognizing racial discrimination would open floodgates to challenges throughout the criminal system. This admission is extraordinary: the system cannot function without racial discrimination. Foucault helps us understand why—punishment is not an unfortunate side effect of the system; it is the system's purpose.

### Theme Two: The Microphysics of Power

Foucault's emphasis on inserting punishment "more deeply into the social order" anticipates his concept of the "microphysics of power"—the idea that power operates not top-down through sovereign decrees but horizontally through everyday practices and institutions that discipline us all.

We are not just punished by prisons; we are disciplined by schools, workplaces, doctors, therapists. All employ the same techniques: constant surveillance, record-keeping, examination, normalization. We learn to internalize the gaze, to discipline ourselves, to conform to standards of normality. The carceral society is not one with more prisons; it is one where prison logic has spread throughout the social body.

The **battered woman syndrome** cases reveal this microphysics at work. Consider **State v. Norman**, where a woman killed her husband after twenty years of brutal abuse. The court denied her self-defense claim because the threat was not "imminent"—he was asleep when she shot him. The court demanded that Norma respond like a reasonable person, ignoring that twenty years of torture had reconstructed her as something other than what the law considers reasonable.

Contrast this with **State v. Norman**'s treatment of battered witnesses or the **Maher** case on heat-of-passion. When a man kills after discovering his wife's infidelity, the law invites us to understand his provocation as reasonable, even when he had hours to "cool off." The law disciplines women to endure abuse while disciplining men to defend their "honor."

What makes this a microphysics of power is that it is not orchestrated by any single authority. Judges, lawyers, jurors—all participate in reproducing gendered expectations about what counts as reasonable fear, what counts as provocation, what counts as a credible victim. The discipline is diffuse, embedded in legal categories that appear neutral but encode social norms.

We see the same dynamic in **People v. Goetz**, the white subway shooter who wounded four Black teenagers. Goetz claimed self-defense, though the teenagers were unarmed and his fear was based on racial stereotypes. A jury acquitted him of murder, convicting only on minor gun charges. The microphysics of white supremacy operated through jurors' "common sense" about who is dangerous, who is credible, whose fear deserves respect.

### Theme Three: Legitimation Rituals and the "Bureaucratic Concealment" of Punishment

Foucault writes of a "double system of protection" that insulates legal actors from the punishment they impose. Judges do not punish; they "correct, reclaim, cure." This legitimation function—masking punishment as rehabilitation or treatment—makes the system more palatable, more difficult to challenge.

We saw this in the death penalty litigation we studied. In **Furman v. Georgia**, the Court struck down death penalty statutes as arbitrary and capricious. States responded not by abolishing the death penalty but by "refining" it—creating guided discretion statutes, bifurcated proceedings, proportionality review. Each reform was presented as making the death penalty more fair, more rational. In reality, it made the system more complex, more bureaucratic, more resistant to challenge.

The **Steiker and Steiker** readings illustrate this. As the Supreme Court has "regulated" the death penalty—requiring separate sentencing phases, enumerating aggravating factors, allowing extensive appeals—it has created multiple layers of legitimation. Prosecutors can say they seek death only in the "worst of the worst." Judges can say they follow "guidelines." Juries can say they found specific aggravating circumstances. Everyone can displace responsibility onto the system.

But the result is not more justice; it is more efficient execution. The death penalty persists—with all its racial disparities, its arbitrariness, its risk of executing the innocent—because it is buffered by layers of bureaucratic procedure. Foucault saw this coming: the "bureaucratic concealment of the penalty" allows the system to operate while participants deny they are doing violence.

This legitimation operates in less extreme contexts too. We call prisons "correctional facilities" though they rarely correct. We require "treatment" for drug offenders though we provide none. We impose fines on people who cannot pay, then jail them for nonpayment, pretending this is about "compliance" not poverty. The language of rehabilitation justifies expansion.

### Conclusion

What this passage and semester have taught me is that criminal law is not a failed attempt to achieve justice. It is a successful attempt to achieve something else: the management of populations, the discipline of bodies, the maintenance of hierarchy. Punishment has not declined; it has been dispersed, inserted more deeply into schools, workplaces, hospitals, streets. We all live in the carceral society now.

The question this leaves me with is: what does it mean to be a lawyer in this system? If law is not about justice but about ordering society through violence—softened, disguised, bureaucratized violence—then what are my obligations? I cannot pretend that participating in this system is neutral. Every motion I file, every argument I make, every plea I negotiate inserts punishment "more deeply into the social order."

Foucault does not offer easy answers. But he offers clarity: we cannot reform this system into something it was never designed to be. The question is not how to make punishment fairer but whether we should punish at all.
