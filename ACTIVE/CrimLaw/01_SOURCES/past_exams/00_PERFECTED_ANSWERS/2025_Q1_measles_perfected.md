## Learning Metadata

**What this tests:**
- Omission liability and duty of care (4 circumstances)
- "But for" causation in unusual context (97% efficacy)
- Mens rea (negligence vs. recklessness)
- Mitigation (State v. Williams comparison)
- Policy questions about criminalizing parents

**Common mistakes:**
- Spending time on parties without duty (minister, RFK) when no duty exists
- Missing the main "but for" causation obstacle
- Not comparing to State v. Williams for mitigation
- Getting distracted by constitutional issues not covered in class

**Professor's emphasis:**
- Focus on the main obstacle: "but for" causation
- Only parents have duty - no one else
- Compare to Williams for mitigation discussion

**TO:** Judge Therwhanger
**FROM:** Law Clerk
**DATE:** [Spring 2025]
**RE:** Criminal Liability Analysis for Kris Jordan Death

### Executive Summary

The investigation into Kris Jordan's death is unlikely to result in criminal charges. The main obstacle is "but for" causation—the measles vaccine is approximately 97% effective, meaning there is a reasonable possibility Kris would have died even if vaccinated. Beyond this, only the parents have a duty of care that could support omission liability, and while they might satisfy the mens rea for negligent homicide, policy considerations weigh against prosecution.

---

### Duty of Care: Only the Parents

Omission liability requires a duty to act. Such a duty arises in only four circumstances: (1) by statute, (2) by contract, (3) by secluding a helpless person, or (4) by assuming the care of a helpless person and so secluding them as to prevent others from rendering aid. A parental relationship independently creates a duty of care.

Here, only Mary and Peter Jordan, Kris's parents, had a duty to act. The parental relationship imposes an affirmative duty to provide necessary medical care. No duty exists for the Mennonite minister who may have advocated against vaccines, nor for the Secretary of Health, nor for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. None of the other three duty bases are present, and these parties had no parental relationship.

---

### The Main Obstacle: "But For" Causation

"But for" causation is rarely an issue in criminal cases, but here it presents a significant barrier to prosecution. The State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that but for the parents' failure to vaccinate, Kris Jordan would not have died.

The MMR vaccine prevents more than 97% of measles infections, but it is not 100% effective. Vaccinated children have died from measles-related illnesses in rare cases. Given this 3% failure rate, the defense could compellingly argue that even with vaccination, Kris might have contracted measles and died. It is likely Kris would be alive today if vaccinated, but "likely" does not meet the beyond a reasonable doubt standard.

This causation problem distinguishes this case from most omission liability prosecutions. In a typical case—where a parent fails to feed a child, or fails to obtain medical treatment for an obvious injury—the causation is clear: but for the parent's inaction, the harm would not have occurred. Here, the causal chain is disrupted by the vaccine's imperfect efficacy.

---

### Proximate Cause and Policy Considerations

Even if "but for" causation could be established, proximate cause presents additional difficulties. National vaccination rates have fallen to roughly 93%, below the 95% threshold needed for herd immunity against measles. Outbreaks are now occurring nationwide. Given this epidemiological context, measles deaths are statistically likely to happen somewhere. Placing criminal homicide liability on parents whose children die in these outbreaks may represent an overextension of criminal law into what is fundamentally a public health tragedy.

Policy questions also cut against prosecution. The deterrent effect of prosecuting grieving parents is questionable. Would anti-vaccine parents be deterred by the prospect of criminal liability? Or would such prosecutions be seen as punitive rather than preventive, driving anti-vaccine communities further underground? More fundamentally, criminalizing parental medical mistakes raises deep questions about the role of punishment in a society.

---

### Mens Rea: Negligence and Recklessness

If causation were not an obstacle, the parents would likely satisfy the mens rea requirements for negligent homicide under Texas law (which adopts the Model Penal Code).

Under MPC § 2.02(2)(d), a person acts negligently when she should be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that a material element exists or will result from her conduct. The risk must be a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe. Given the well-known effectiveness of the MMR vaccine and the well-known risks of measles, a reasonable juror would likely find that failing to vaccinate a child constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care.

The recklessness standard under MPC § 2.02(2)(c) requires subjective awareness of the substantial risk and conscious disregard of it. Whether the parents were subjectively aware of the risk is a factual question. If they knew about measles outbreaks and consciously rejected vaccination based on misinformation, recklessness might apply. But negligence is the more straightforward fit.

### Comparison to State v. Williams

The closest analogous case is State v. Williams, where Washington State courts convicted parents of negligent homicide after their child died from a tooth infection that could have been treated with antibiotics. The parents waited too long to seek medical care, believing the condition was minor. The court applied a civil negligence standard and found the parents' failure unreasonable.

The cases are similar in addressing parental medical decision-making under omission liability. Both involve situations where parents failed to obtain standard medical care for their children.

They differ in an important way. The Williams parents had legitimate reasons for distrust—the shameful history of Native American child separation created a context in which avoiding medical authorities was understandable, even if unreasonable. The Williams court nonetheless found them liable, but the mitigating circumstances were noted.

Here, by contrast, there are fewer apparent mitigations. The Mennonite community's vaccine refusal appears based on ideology rather than historical trauma targeted specifically at them. One could argue this makes the Jordans more culpable than the Williams parents, not less. If so, they would be more likely to be found responsible under a negligent homicide theory.

But the causation obstacle that exists here did not exist in Williams. In Williams, timely medical care almost certainly would have saved the child. Here, vaccination almost certainly would have protected Kris—but "almost" is not enough for beyond a reasonable doubt.

---

### Hypothetical Comparison Cases

Consider a different fact pattern: Parents who fail to put their child in a car seat, and the child dies in an accident. Car seats are not 100% effective either—but they are sufficiently effective that "but for" causation would be satisfied. If the child had been properly restrained, she almost certainly would have survived. That case would be prosecutable.

Or consider parents who refuse a blood transfusion for their child on religious grounds. If the child dies as a result, causation is clear—the transfusion would almost certainly have saved the child. That case would be prosecutable, though courts have sometimes accommodated religious objections.

What makes the measles case different is the probabilistic nature of the vaccine's protection. The 3% failure rate creates reasonable doubt about causation.

---

### Recommendation

The investigation is unlikely to result in criminal charges. The main obstacle is "but for" causation, which cannot be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt given the vaccine's 97% efficacy rate. While the parents had a duty and likely satisfied the negligence standard, the causation gap is fatal to any homicide prosecution.

The judge may wish to consider whether alternative responses are more appropriate. This is fundamentally a public health challenge, not a criminal justice problem. Criminal prosecution would not bring Kris back, would not deter other anti-vaccine parents in a meaningful way, and would subject grieving parents to the trauma of criminal proceedings.

The better path forward is through public health education, vaccination campaigns, and community engagement—not the criminal law.

Key points professor emphasized:
- Main obstacle is "but for" causation
- Only parents have duty - minister, RFK no duty
- Williams comparison for mitigation
- Hypothetical comparisons helpful (car seat)
- Policy/theories of punishment relevant
- No need to discuss constitutional issues or reckless endangerment (not studied)
