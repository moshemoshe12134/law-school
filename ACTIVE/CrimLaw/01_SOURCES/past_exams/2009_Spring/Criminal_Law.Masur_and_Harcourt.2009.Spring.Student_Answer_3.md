Question 1.

Purchase/Selling of Cocaine

Avon, Stringer, and Wee-Bey

Avon, Stringer, and Wee-Bey were all involved in the purchase of 100 kilograms of
cocaine. Purchasing more than 10 kilograms of cocaine is a felony and we can charge all three
with the felony purchase of cocaine under ILCC §1.2. (Since it appears that Wee-Bey was shot
prior to the culmination of the deal, aside from the minor complication of him being dead, we
might only be able to charge him w/ attempted purchase of more than 10 kilograms of cocaine as

he was ultimately unable to complete his criminal purpose b/c of facts beyond his control.)

Vondas
Vondas sold more than 10 kilograms of cocaine (sold 100 kilograms) and can also be

charged with the felony of selling cocaine under ILCC §1.2.

Wee-Bey’s (WB) Shooting
Avon

Avon shot Wee-Bey and should be charged w/ Murder (or Felony Murder under analysis
similar to what follows for other participants, but w/o the complication of foreseeability- but-
even if we were somehow prevented from convicting for felony murder, Avon can definitely still
be charged w/ murder). He might try to argue that he did not act w/ the purpose of killing Wee-
Bey and was indifferent as to what happened when he shot the gun behind his back. He might
also try to argue that shooting behind his back proves that he could not had the purpose of killing

WB, he might even say that he couldn’t know w/ practical certainty that WB was likely to die.


Exam #3 Spring 09 June 10", 2009
Criminal Law, Prof. Masur & Prof. Harcourt Page 2 of 24

This shouldn’t be a problem. Under the MPC, §210.2, a defendant is guilty of murder if he kills
another human being purposefully, knowingly, or recklessly under circumstances manifesting an
extreme indifference to the value of human life. Avon shooting behind his back is arguably
“knowingly”, since he was a good shot and shot in the direction of WB and it could be argued
“knew” there was a practical certainty that he would kill or inflict serious bodily injury on WB.
However, we don’t even need to go that far. Certainly, firing a gun in someone’s direction,
without looking, constitutes recklessness (aware of risk and does anyway) and an extreme
indifference to the value of human life. Avon was fine w/ the possibility of shooting WB and
took a substantial, unjustified risk, despite awareness of the risk. He should easily be convicted

of WB’s murder.

Stringer, Vondas

Stringer and Vondas were co-felons w/ Avon. (They were on opposite sides of the
transaction, but all were engaging in the felony together.) Our felony murder statute, ILCC §1.6
says that “‘a person is guilty of murder if, in the course of the commission of a felony or an
attempt to commit a felony, any person causes the death of any other individual in a manner that
facilitates the commission of the felony or attempt to commit it.” Before being certain about the
strength of felony murder charges against Stringer and Vondas, I’d want to look more into how
the IL courts have interpreted this statute. But, based on my preliminary analysis I believe we
should charge them w/ felony murder stemming from Avon’s shooting of WB.

To start with the language “‘a person is guilty of murder if... any person causes the death”
seems to indicate legislative intent to hold a person engaged in a felony responsible for deaths

caused by “any person,” not just deaths they cause themselves. The statute does not say that the


Exam #3 Spring 09 June 10", 2009
Criminal Law, Prof. Masur & Prof. Harcourt Page 3 of 24

deaths of co-felons do not count, so, assuming a co-felon qualifies as “any other individual,”
WB’s death should count. (Some jurisdictions do not count the death of a co-felon as eligible for
felony-murder- Williams; Others count the life of the co-felon the same as the life of an innocent
party- Martinez.) The bigger question, the one I’d want to do more research on, is what
constitutes “in a manner that facilitates the commission of the felony or attempt to commit it.” If
the IL courts read this statute narrowly, we might face problems if Stringer and Vondas argue
that Avon’s shooting of WB did not further/facilitate their drug sales, but was rather- an isolated
event, Avon’s own criminal lark (as in Heinlein). However, since Avon shot WB b/c he was
angry that WB was talking too loudly on the phone and making it difficult for the deal to be
discussed, if the IL courts read the statute broadly (as in Cabaltero) the shooting should count as
something in furtherance of/facilitating the commission of the felony. Stringer and Vondas’s best
argument is likely related to the foreseeability of this action as part of the commission of their
felony, but this seems to not be a very strong argument. Courts are likely to find that, even if not
planned for, the possibility of violence during a serious drug deal is in fact foreseeable. Even
though the actual exchange of drugs and money did not take place at this meeting, they were
meeting to finalize arrangements for the sale/purchase of cocaine and the commission of a felony

begins w/ preparations. Their meeting occurred “during” a felony.

Guns at a Drug Transaction

Avon & ILCC §1.4
Avon should be charged w/ the felony of possessing a handgun during a voluntary drug
transaction. (Again- even though drugs aren’t actually exchanged at the meeting- we can easily

argue that this is part of the transaction.)


Exam #3 Spring 09 June 10", 2009
Criminal Law, Prof. Masur & Prof. Harcourt Page 4 of 24

Stringer & ILCC §14

It seems that ILCC §1 4 could be read as a strict liability offense. If it has been
interpreted as a strict liability offense by IL courts, then Stringer is liable for having a gun at a
drug transaction, even if he did so unknowingly. (There would be reasons to consider something
like this a strict liability offense, despite the fact that strict liability offenses are disfavored
(Staples), in certain situations, we see little societal value to an activity and a great risk and
choose, in favor of public welfare, to impose strict liability (Freed).) However, the MPC
disfavors strict liability offenses (unless they are merely violations) and says that a criminal
statute w/o a mens rea requirement written in should be read to require at least recklessness.
Here, since Stringer did not know that he had a gun, it’d be difficult for us to establish
recklessness. There is a possibility though... the fact that someone else may have placed the gun
there works against us, but- if Stringer knew that he usually kept a gun in his briefcase and,
aware that he usually kept a gun in his briefcase and that he was going to a drug deal, failed to
check to make sure that he did not have a gun... we may be able to succeed in the argument that

he recklessly brought a gun to a drug transaction and violated the statute.

Stringer’s Killing of D’Angelo

Stringer purposefully killed D’ Angelo and can (except for the fact that he’s dead) be
charged with Murder under the MPC. His comment “he was a danger to us,” after the fact
doesn’t implicate anyone else in his death. There is no reason to believe that his death took place
as part of a felony or would involve any felony-murder prosecutions. His comment “he was a
danger to us” does indicate willful premeditation on his part and it is likely that we could charge

him w/ aggravated murder under ILCC §1.1, where he would be subject to higher penalties. (“I


Exam #3 Spring 09 June 10", 2009
Criminal Law, Prof. Masur & Prof. Harcourt Page 5 of 24

had D’ Angelo killed indicates he may have paid/ordered someone else to do it- we can still

charge him w/ murder.)

Avon’s Killing of Stringer

We can charge Avon w/ Murder under the MPC (purposefully killed Stringer), even
aggravated murder under ILCC §1.1 (premeditation indicated by getting gun, driving to S’s
house, and the way he shot him twice in the head).

However, Avon is likely to allege that he was suffering from an Extreme Mental or
Emotional Disturbance (MPC §210.3(1)(b)) and argue for mitigation down to manslaughter.
(Under the MPC, if EMED is shown, then what would usually be murder constitutes
manslaughter instead.) Under the MPC EMED standards, defendants are not as restricted as they
were under the common law’s provocation standards. All Avon will need to convince a jury of is
that he was in fact suffering from an extreme mental or emotional disturbance (this disturbance
prevented him from thinking rationally/common law- heat of passion) and that there was a
“reasonable explanation or excuse” for the EMED. The evaluation of EMED is both objective
and subjective. It must be reasonable, but its reasonableness is determined from the viewpoint of
a person in the actor’s situation. Under the MPC, there is no need to prove specific provocation
or specifically discuss whether or not there was cooling time/inflammation of passion/etc. Avon
will have a strong argument for EMED b/c he just heard that this person had shot his nephew. A
jury could believe that he wasn’t acting rationally and was acting “in the heat of the moment.”

We can argue against EMED by attempting to show that, even though this might be

something that could cause EMED, in Avon’s case it did not. We can discuss common law ideas


Exam #3 Spring 09 June 10", 2009
Criminal Law, Prof. Masur & Prof. Harcourt Page 6 of 24

about cooling time and argue that Avon’s killing of Stringer was not from EMED, but from a

calm, cool, rational, calculated desire to take revenge.

Omar attempted robbery of Namond and Marlo

Omar attempted to rob Namond and Marlo when he tried to take their drugs and money at
gunpoint. (ILCC §1.3 and MPC §5.01). Since both victims had separate stacks of bills, I’m
assuming we can charge Omar with two attempted robberies- one of Namond and one of Marlo.
In both cases, Omar will try to argue that he abandoned his attempt and so shouldn’t be charged.
However, according to MPC §5.01(4), this defense is only allowed if the circumstances of
renunciation manifest a complete and voluntary renunciation of criminal purpose.

In the robbery of Namond, Omar’s argument is strongest- Namond just said that he really
wanted to save the money for college and this apparently convinced Omar to abandon the
robbery. (Similar to Ross analysis where victim convinced perp to abandon, but court found perp
abandoned of own free will; BUT, see- McNeal- where court chose to view argument of victim
as resistance/force that was unanticipated by perp and perp’s changing mind in light of did not
constitute renunciation.) I think we can conceivably argue that Omar’s abandonment of his
robbery of Namond does not give him a renunciation excuse because: (1) the case should be
thought of the way the McNeal court thought of that case, (2) Namond had a “small” stack of
bills and this might have influenced Omar’s abandonment (as in Johnston), (3) there was no
renunciation of criminal purpose, just a decision to wait/direct his criminal purpose elsewhere on
different victims, and (4) because the robbery was being done at the same time as the robbery of

Marlo- Marlo’s threats of violence also influenced Omar’s decision to back out of the robbery of


Exam #3 Spring 09 June 10", 2009
Criminal Law, Prof. Masur & Prof. Harcourt Page 7 of 24

Namond. With all four of these arguments on our side, I think we would be able to disprove an
attempt by Omar to avoid a charge of attempted robbery of Namond b/c of renunciation.

Omar could also argue that he renounced his attempt to rob Marlo and w/in the language
of the MPC- it was not motivated by a change in the circumstances that made the crime more
difficult or increased his probability of detection. (More likely to be killed by a mafia boss isn’t
the “detection/apprehension” the MPC seems to have in mind- presumably by authorities.)
However, his argument of renunciation in this case will likely fail because it seems unlikely a
jury would believe that it was done “under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his criminal purpose.” The threat by a mafia boss to kill you if you take his
money would seem to cause most people to abandon efforts not because they are voluntarily
renouncing their criminal purpose, but simply because they don’t want the mafia boss to kill
them. It seems we have a strong case against Omar for the attempted robbery of Marlo and the

attempted robbery of Namond.

Omar’s Death

Prez

There is nothing to indicate that Prez was negligent or reckless. He seems to have been
going the speed limit, driving soberly, etc and, even when he swerved and hit Omar- Omar was
in the street and, at the point of impact, Prez had just swerved in the street (if Prez had been
killed on the sidewalk, there’d be a stronger argument that, while Prez may have instinctually
swerved, swerving onto the sidewalk negligently risked the lives of bystander, but swerving

towards the curb, in the street, seems not to be as “negligent” of a choice). We could argue that


Exam #3 Spring 09 June 10", 2009
Criminal Law, Prof. Masur & Prof. Harcourt Page 8 of 24

he was negligent in not reacting sooner to McNulty’s oncoming vehicle and charge him w/
Negligent Homicide (MPC §210.4) This is our best charge against Prez, but I’m not sure it’s one
we should make. It seems entirely within reason to assume that an oncoming care that has moved
into the wrong lane (maybe b/c of a pothole, etc) will move back into its proper lane and it’s not
clear what he would have been the more prudent course of action (stopping and leaving vehicle,

going in to the wrong lane himself? these seem to pose risks of their own...).

McNulty

I think we should charge him with Omar’s murder, under the theory that his drunk
driving was recklessness under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to human life.
Under the MPC- intoxication only serves as a defense in so far as it negates material elements of
a crime. (§2.08(1)) Since we are not alleging he purposefully or knowingly created a situation
where Omar would be killed, but rather- did so recklessly (and w/ extreme indifference), his
intoxication will not be a defense, even if it meant that he was subjectively cognizant of the risk
that he was creating at the moment he created it because of his intoxication (MPC §2.08(2) re:
reckless and Dufield re: “circumstances manifesting extreme indifference’). It is conceivable that
a jury would find being twice the legal limit and driving a car drunk down the street, on the
wrong side, is gross recklessness and manifests and extreme indifference to the value of human
life. (We may even be able to play on the fact that he is a cop and is particularly aware of the
dangers of driving while intoxicated.)

We will have to convince the jury that McNulty’s drunk driving was both the “but-for”
and “proximate” cause of Omar’s death. (Since Prez killed him and McNulty’s vehicle did not,

this will create more of a need for a strong argument re: proximate cause.) Since we’re in a MPC


Exam #3 Spring 09 June 10", 2009
Criminal Law, Prof. Masur & Prof. Harcourt Page 9 of 24

jurisdiction, we’ll be considering the language “not too remote or accidental to have a just
bearing on the actor’s liability” when considering proximate cause. | think “‘zone-of-danger” and
“foreseeability” arguments all will lead us to the conclusion that Omar’s death when Prez
swerved to avoid McNulty is not “too remote or accidental” for him to be held responsible and is
a sufficiently “direct” cause of Omar’s death. People in the street and on the sidewalk- in cars or
pedestrians were all arguably in the “zone of danger” of McNulty’s drunk driving. It is also
entirely foreseeable that, when driving drunk, down the wrong side of the road, other cars might
have to suddenly swerve and, in suddenly swerving, might be unable to avoid pedestrians-
consequently hitting and killing them. (Acosta- w/ in reasonable contemplation; Arzon- doesn’t
have to be sole factor- as long as sufficiently direct cause and the harm that happens could be
reasonably foreseen; Kibbe- other actor’s (car hitting) doesn’t impact causation b/c was
foreseeable that it would happen).

McNulty’s best defense would be involuntary intoxication... but there is nothing in the

fact pattern to suggest that this is the case.

Marlo, Chris, and Snoop- Murder

They all acted purposefully to kill Omar (Marlo hiring Chris&Snoop and setting up the
arrangement, Chris & Snoop firing directly at him.) True, they did not succeed in shooting him-
but they were ultimately a “but-for” cause of his death when he dove out the window (reasonable
to anticipate a victim trying to escape) and he was hit by a car in the street. The trickier issue
related to causation will be proving that they were a proximate cause of his death and that his
death being hit by Prez was not “too remote or accidental” to hold Marlo, Chris, and Snoop

liable. We will have to prove proximate cause and that may be a difficult argument to make.


Exam #3 Spring 09 June 10", 2009
Criminal Law, Prof. Masur & Prof. Harcourt Page 10 of 24

While it would be an easier argument to make if Omar was simply struck by a car after jumping
out the window into the street (Kern) in his effort to save his life, the fact that Prez appears to
have hit Omar only b/c of having to swerve to avoid McNulty while McNulty was driving drunk
does raise questions about whether or not Omar’s death in this manner was “foreseeable” or,
instead, “too remote or accidental” to justly bear on the actor’s culpability. The defense will
make these arguments, but we should prosecute anyway and attempt to convince the jury that the
best way of looking at Omar’s death in the street is that his death from any risk posed by being a
pedestrian in the street was a foreseeable result and a direct consequence of him running for his
life when Chris and Snoop attacked him (like Kern or Kibbe), and that however that happened.
does not put it beyond the realm of foreseeability that he would be exposed to the risk of being
struck by a vehicle when he landed in the street while trying to escape.

The fact that we’re also charging McNulty in Omar’s death shouldn’t impact our ability
to charge these gentlemen. They can be viewed as concurrent causes of his death and, as long as

all of the elements are met in each case, should all be held responsible.

Marlo, Chris, and Snoop- Attempted Murder

If we fail in our charges of murder, we should bring attempted murder charges.

Omar shooting at Chris and Snoop
Not attempted murder- wasn’t planning on hitting them. (Could argue had purpose of hitting
them/hope of hitting them... but that seems to be a stretch... and- it is obviously self-defense-

although we are not discussing that.)


Exam #3 Spring 09 June 10", 2009
Criminal Law, Prof. Masur & Prof. Harcourt Page 11 of 24

Attempted Robbery of Chris and Snoop by Omar

It’s harsh, after he was shot at and run over by a car, but Omar was planning on robbing
Chris and Snoop and showed up to do it. The fact that it did not work out and that circumstances
weren’t what he believed them to be does not excuse his attempt. (The MPC does not recognize
the excuse of impossibility only allowing for mitigation or dismissal under §5.05 where desired
crime is highly unlikely to result in criminal activity or pose a danger to anyone- which is
obviously not the case w/ this attempted robbery. And, while the MPC does recognize mistake of
fact if it negates the necessary mens rea for the crime, it’s not allowed if the defendant would
have been guilty of another offense if the situation was as he supposed. Here- Omar planned on
robbing Chris and Snoop- the fact that it was an ambush of him instead doesn’t relieve him of his
responsibility for his criminal purposes/attempt.) Omar arguably met the MPC standard of taking
a substantial step corroborating his criminal purposes (§5.01(2)) when he entered the house to

commit the robbery (and was armed).

Prez’s Death

Marlo, Chris, and Snoop

It doesn’t seem that Omar’s presence in the street was even a but-for cause of Prez’s death, so we
should not charge Marlo, Chris, and Snoop in Prez’s death. (And certainly not Omar- who wasn’t

even there of his own volition.)

McNulty


Exam #3 Spring 09 June 10", 2009
Criminal Law, Prof. Masur & Prof. Harcourt Page 12 of 24

Applying the same analysis as we did to McNulty’s guilt in Omar’s death, but without the
proximate cause issues, we have a strong possibility of succeeding on a murder charge against

McNulty for Prez’s death.

Wallace’s Death

When Bodie took Wallace’s money while pointing a gun at him, even if it wasn’t loaded,
this was felony robbery under ILCC 1.3 b/c he took Wallace’s property using the threat of force.
Since this is a felony, refer back to my earlier discussion of questions that arise in relation to this
statute and felony-murder prosecutions, those same issues and the same analysis applies here.
Here, though, there would be much more difficulty in trying to prove that the shooting of
Wallace was in facilitation of the felony (the robbery), since the robbery really wasn’t even the
purpose/goal/objective of the activity of that point. (If we could prove death was in facilitation of
a felony then Bodie and Poot could be charged w/ felony murder.) Without felony murder, Bodie
could still be charged w/ murder (under a recklessness w/ extreme indifference to human life
standard- even though he thought he had removed the bullets he was, arguably, still aware of the
possibility of missing a bullet by accident and the risk of shooting the gun in someone’s
direction) although his defense team would have a relatively strong argument against a murder
charge related to whether or not we could really prove that level of recklessness. We have a
stronger case for manslaughter, and an even stronger case for negligent homicide.

Without felony murder, it is questionable whether we can charge Poot in Wallace’s death.
Arguably, we could say he helped to create the danger and had, as a result, a duty to do what he

could to save Wallace. However, Poot has strong arguments that he did not create the specific


Exam #3 Spring 09 June 10", 2009
Criminal Law, Prof. Masur & Prof. Harcourt Page 13 of 24

danger Wallace ended up facing and, outside of if he was responsible for creating the danger

Wallace faced, does not have any special relationship to Wallace that mandates that he help him.

Bodie’s Death
We should charge Poot w/ the murder (purposeful killing) of Bodie. However, we should be
prepared for Poot’s defense team to argue that the charge should be mitigated down to

manslaughter because of EMED.

Question 2.

Thinking of the manslaughter doctrine (provocation defense in the common law) as
resting on the blameworthiness of the victim and the blameworthiness of the victim acting as a
justification for why we are willing to consider a defendant’s killing of the victim as less wrong
and deserving of less punishment can find justifications in both retributivist and utilitarian
theory. Both theories can also be used to provide arguments against this way of looking at the

manslaughter rule.

Retributivist
Thinking of punishment and criminal law from a retributionist standpoint- we could argue in
favor of the manslaughter rule because:

(a) the victim is blameworthy and, as a result deserves punishment so that there is
repayment for the wrong (allowing the person wronged to punish the victim seems to
allow repayment for a personal wrong on a level that punishment by law enforcement
does not allow) and annulment of the wrong, the defendant is simply providing that
punishment that ought to be provided anyway, and-

(b) the defendant may have taken the law into their own hands and to a certain extent
violated the social pact, committed a wrong; but they did not commit as much of a
wrong as if they had attacked a innocent victim because the victim they chose was
deserving of punishment anyway—so, while we may still punish the defendant for
violating the social pact by taking enforcement into his or her own hands, if we’re
concerned about proportional retribution- the defendant who kills a blameworthy
victim is deserving of less punishment

We could argue against the manslaughter rule because:

(a) if we are concerned about proportionality of retribution- then, in most cases, the
killing of the victim is grossly disproportionate to whatever wrong he or she
committed prior to death and so isn’t, arguably, justified under a retribution theory,

(b) we might be retributivist, but believe that retribution is only to be enforced by the
state and, no matter how deserving of punishment a victim is, the state is the only one

justified in doling out that punishment,


Exam #3 Spring 09 June 10", 2009
Criminal Law, Prof. Masur & Prof. Harcourt Page 15 of 24
(c) and we might view the defendant’s violation of the social pact by taking justice into
his or her hands as an element that is itself deserving of retribution- not a reason to

allow less punishment of the individual.

Utilitarian
Utilitarian arguments in favor of the manslaughter rule:

(a) we want to make sure that, in terms of deterrence, people are punished more heavily
for unprovoked murders than provoked, so that we can ensure that people really
understand how terrible we feel unprovoked murders are,

(b) crimes resulting from provocation or the wrong of the victim are less likely to be
rational and less likely to be deterred, allowing more punishment would not decrease
the number of these crimes that are committed,

(c) for some wrongs where the manslaughter rule is invoked, the defendant has actually
done the state a favor and saved the state an enormous amount of money/trouble in
the trial, appeals, and incarceration of a dangerous criminal (if the defendant’s

prosecution ,etc. is cheaper than the victim’s prosecution,etc. would have been)

Utilitarian arguments against the manslaughter rule:

(a) despite the victim’s wrong, the taking of their life might be a horrible wrong/loss to
society and the defendant’s crime takes more value from society than it adds to it or
than would have been taken if the government had been allowed to correct for the
wrong that the victim had done

(b) giving people a reduced sentence for reacting in the heat of the moment or extracting
revenge has the exact opposite effect of what we should be striving for- it does not
encourage them to consider their actions or be deterred and acts as a tacit approval of
people extracting revenge

(c) the most efficient way of ensuring a well-running, orderly society is allowing the state
to remedy criminal wrongs, bypassing the system decreases efficiency and should be

punished harshly to deter people from choosing to do so

Question 3.

Santiago-homicide-death of Officer Edwards

Defenses

Self-Defense: Santiago’s attorney can argue that Santiago shot Edwards in self-defense. To make
out this claim under §3.04 of the MPC, he’ll have to show that Santiago believed that such force
was immediately necessary for the purpose of protecting himself against the use of unlawful
force by Officer Ewards. Because he used deadly force, he’1l have to show that he believed he
was protecting himself from the threat of death or serious bodily harm. It seems that he can show
this- Edwards was pointing a gun at him and seemed to be about to fire. While the other officers
had just announced that they were officers, there is nothing to suggest that Santiago had reason
to believe they could protect him (they had been disarmed) or that Edwards was an officer and
wouldn’t fire if Santiago put his gun down (Santiago seems to have still been under the
impression that Edwards was not an officer, but an assailant). The MPC judges only whether or
not the person had an honest and reasonable belief under the circumstances, as he believed them

to be. Here, it seems Santiago has a strong case for self-defense.

Insanity: He’d have to prove, under MPC§4.01, that at the time of shooting Edwards, as a result
of a mental disease or defect, he lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his
conduct or conform his conduct to the requirements of law. It seems doubtful that he actually
was suffering from a mental disease or defect, but it’s possibly something the defense could

bring up.


Exam #3 Spring 09 June 10", 2009
Criminal Law, Prof. Masur & Prof. Harcourt Page 17 of 24

Prosecution Response

Self-Defense: There are two exceptions to the ability to use force to defend one’s self that are
relevant here. 3.04(2)(a)(i) doesn’t help the prosecution much UNLESS Santiago knew that
Edwards was a police officer and was trying to make an arrest. Based on the facts, that seems
unlikely, but- after doing more research, we might discover otherwise- in which case, if Santiago
knew Edwards was a police officer making an arrest, even if it was an unlawful one, Santiago
would not be justified in using force against him. The prosecution could also respond that
according to 3.04(2)(b)(i) the actor cannot use force if the actor provoked the use of force against
himself in the same encounter. They could argue that he could have left the scene initially, rather
than picking up Edwards gun and that his pointing Edwards gun at the other officers provoked
Edward’s use of force, making it so Santiago does not have a legitimate claim to use self-
defense. However, the facts don’t seem to support this. It seems that when Santiago grabbed the
gun, he was already acting either in self-defense or defense of others. Also, he was not

threatening Edwards w/ the gun when Edwards took aim at him.

Insanity: The prosecution would respond that there doesn’t seem to be anything in the evidence

that suggests that Santiago was suffering from a mental disease or defect.

Strongest Argument

Self-Defense: Based on the facts in front of me, Santiago’s defense attorney has a lot to work w/
and the Prosecution does not have as much. The strongest argument for the prosecution seems to
be the fact that there were cops present (the other three officers) and Santiago should have let

them protect him (but- since it doesn’t seem that he knew Edwards was an officer and he had


Exam #3 Spring 09 June 10", 2009
Criminal Law, Prof. Masur & Prof. Harcourt Page 18 of 24

taken the guns from the other three cops before discovering they were cops- it doesn’t seem
realistic that he could expect them to prevent Edwards from shooting him) or that Santiago could
have left the scene, instead of choosing to stay, pick up a gun, and involve himself and provoke
Edwards into pulling his gun (but here too- it seems Santiago may have been motivated by
confusion and a desire to protect himself and the others in the area from whoever the people in
the car w/ guns were- not knowing them to be police officers.) Overall, I think the defense has a
stronger case, short of any information that would help the prosecution that we don’t have in

front of us at the moment.

Insanity: Without more information, it’s hard to say. There could be a case of insanity or at least

temporary incapacitation... but I’d have to know more.

Estrada-attempted homicide-shooting Santiago

Defenses

Defense of others: MPC §3.05 allows for the defense of others to essentially the same extent as
§3.04 allows for the defense of one’s own person. Furthermore, the MPC does not require that
the person taking the action be correct, only that they reasonably belief, based on their
assessment of the situation, that such action is necessary. Estrada can argue that he reasonably

believed Santiago was about to shoot Ortega and acted to save Ortega.

Prosecution Response

The prosecution will have to argue that there was not evidence to support Estrada’s view, even

his subjective viewpoint, that Santiago was about to shoot Ortega. This seems difficult to do.


Exam #3 Spring 09 June 10", 2009
Criminal Law, Prof. Masur & Prof. Harcourt Page 19 of 24

There response would have to point to any preexisting relationship between Santiago and
Estrada/Ortega that might make it unlikely he’d kill them, the fact that Santiago seemed to be

trying to protect them, etc.

Strongest Argument

The defense has the strongest argument here. The MPC examines the reasonableness of the
mistake from the actor’s point of view if the circumstances are what he believes them to be, he
doesn’t have to be correct in his assessment of the situation. Here, Estrada could have reasonably

believed that Santiago was about to shoot Ortega and needed to be shot to save Ortega.

Estrada-attempted homicide-Silvio and assault against Sandra for the stray bullets
Defenses

Didn’t act w/ the required level of culpability: b/c he was acting in defense of Ortega and the
bullets that hit Silvio and Sandra were not purposefully or knowingly fired at them, Estrada can
argue that he lacked the necessary mens rea to be convicted of the attempted homicide of Silvio
or the assault against Sandra. He can argue that he was justified in his use of force and should be
excused for the impact on any innocent victims that he unintentionally involved.

Prosecution Response

Under the MPC, if Estrada was negligent or reckless in assuming that he had the right to defend
Ortega by firing at Santiago, Estrada cannot use his response as a defense against charges that
only require a mens rea of negligence or recklessness. Furthermore, even if he was acting
correctly to defend Ortega, he could use too much force or utilize it negligently or recklessly and

still be prosecuted for harm to others resulting from his negligence or recklessness. Arguably,

spraying 6 bullets towards Santiago when other people were in the area was negligent or
reckless.

Strongest Argument

It is difficult, but possible in certain jurisdictions, to get a conviction for attempted
manslaughter/negl homicide that rests on negligence/recklessness. That might be possible here In
the Santaigo case, if our jurisdiction allows prosecution for these sort of attempt crimes. If not,
the prosecution could drop the charge related to Silvio to assault, as with Sandra. The
prosecution seems to have the strongest argument when it comes to reckless/negligent use of
force in regards to firing 6 times. However, it’s no home-run. A panicked person, perhaps
unfamiliar w/ a gun, could conceivably react this way and a jury could find that she or he had not

behaved negligently/recklessly.

Anzelino & Musante-accomplices-homicide-death of Officer Edwards

Defenses

There conviction as accomplices does not turn on whether or not Dunton is convicted. However,
the same arguments that point against Dunton being convicted, also point against them being
convicted. That said, Anzelino and Musante’s best to a homicide conviction based on accomplice
liability is that they were not accomplices. In order to be accomplices, they must have the mens
rea of helping the crime to succeed and the actus reus of encouraging/assisting in its commission
in some way. They were simply present. They did arguably, after stopping the car, did nothing to
encourage/assist Dunton and, they can argue, they certainly didn’t have the purpose of helping an

illegal act to succeed.

Prosecution Response

The prosecution can argue that they didn’t have to have the purpose for a crime to happen and
that, if the homicide charge is based on recklessness or negligence, not purposefulness or
knowledge, they only have to have the purpose to assist Dunton and be negligent in the way they
do so. The prosecution can argue that their driving up to the scene and getting out of the car was
encouraging Dunton and that Anzelino and Musante were negligent in not themselves revealing

to Edwards that they were officers (since all were in plain clothes, unmarked vehicle).

Strongest Argument

The prosecution probably has the strongest argument in regards to negligence on the part of
Anzelino, Musante (and Dunton) in not revealing themselves to be officers. However, the
defense may have a slightly stronger argument than the prosecution in regards to whether or nto

A or M really did anything to assist/encourage Dunton.

Dunton-homicide-death of Officer Edwards

Defenses

He can argue the lawful use of self-defense because Edwards turned towards him with a gun
drawn after Dunton had told Edwards to drop the gun and Dunton had no reason to know that

Edwards was an officer.

Prosecution Response

The prosecution can argue that while, in theory the self-defense argument is correct, where it

falls apart is Dunton’s negligence in failing to reveal himself to be a police officer. Because he

failed to reveal himself to be a police officer, he was essentially the aggressor/provoker and
should not be able to claim self-defense when someone else responds to his threat of deadly

force.

Strongest Argument

The prosecution has an incredibly strong case against Dunton for negligent/reckless homicide
(either negligent homicide or a form of manslaughter) because he failed to reveal that he was an
officer. While Edwards didn’t reveal that he was an officer either, this doesn’t excuse Dunton’s

failure to disclose that he was an officer.

Question 4.

In so many situations, including self-defense, sentencing decisions, mistake of fact
related to consent in rape situations, and provocation/Extreme Mental or Emotional disturbance
arguments, we see the law struggle with objective and subjective standards for evaluating
people’s conduct as we try, through law, to develop rules or standards that we can use to apply to
a variety of situations and achieve just outcomes. In so many of these instances, including self-
defense, as you pointed out in class, the courts and legal system end up determining whether to
apply a subjective, objective, or hybrid standard based on decisions about what facts the
decision-maker in the case should be allowed to consider in reaching a judgment. This is the
underlying basis for the choice of what standard (objective/subjective/or hybrid) to apply to any
given situation.

As the capital punishment discussion highlighted- there are often real, compelling
tensions between subjective versus objective standards, w/ both objectivity and subjectivity
pushing in the direction of justice, yet inherently contradicting and pushing against each other.
The judge, the legislator, the legal system are forced, in all of these instances (throughout
criminal law and procedure) to choose the standard or hybrid that they feel will result in the
“most” justice, even though they choose one standard and the justice it provides at the expense of
another and the justice it provides. As the Kahan article on self-defense discussed- underlying
values impact the way we view situations and facts and, no doubt, underlying values surely
impact the way decision-makers (the judge, the legislator, the legal system) make decsisions
about which standards are best and should be utilized in which situations. Critical legal theory

scholars would point out that wrapped into this are inherently discriminatory policies, since

Criminal Law, Prof. Masur & Prof. Harcourt Page 24 of 24

decisisions will be made by people of the power/privilege who will be influenced in the
decisions they make by their own values, tainted by their one-sided view of life/the world/etc.
Their view of what ultimately achieves justice, when choosing between competing claims,
competing standards, obj v. subj, might not be in fact what achieves justice and is, at the very
least, one-sided.

The Kelman argument about interpretative construction in substantive criminal law points
out how all of our legal arguments are made only after fact patterns are characterized by
interpretive constructs- interpretive constructs that are chosen- for better or for worse- by people
in an attempt

The Posner articles could also be considered when examining the choices we make
between subjective v. objective standards in terms of trying to make those choices to ultimately
result in the most utility and the most efficient system that encourages the most market

participation and least market bypassing.
