Question 1

Cocaine purchase

The first crime that occurs here is the purchase of cocaine. Avon, Stringer, WeeBey, and Vondas
are in finalizing their agreement. I am not clear whether or not the purchase/sale of the drugs
actually took place at this time or if it took place later, but I would assume that finalizing the
agreement would be considered “in the course of” the felony and that these four could be
charged. There is no mens rea in the statute making purchase of cocaine a felony, but even if
there were, all four parties intend to purchase the drugs or are at least aware that this is their

purpose for the meeting.

Additionally, it is a felony to possess a handgun in the course of a voluntary drug transaction in
IL. Both Avon and Stringer had guns, so they could both potentially be charged here. The
statute does not contain a mens rea requirement, it only requires possession. However, strict
liability is only found when a legislative purpose to impose absolute liability for such offenses
plainly appears. 2.05(1)(b). Furthermore, strict liability is usually limited to public welfare
offenses, which means that it typically would only apply to violations that do not carry prison
sentences. In Staples, the court refused to find a strict liability offense for possession of an
automatic firearm when the crime was felony carrying a penalty of 10 years. If the court here
felt similarly (and they can apply mens rea when they feel it is “consistent with effective
enforcement of the law 2.05(1)(a)), then this would not be an SL offense and mens rea of
purposely, knowingly, or recklessly would be required. 2.02(3). Avon clearly knew he possessed

the gun, because he killed someone with it. Stringer is a different case. He only realized later


Student #1 Spring 09
Crim Final — 6/10/2009 — Masur/Harcourt
Page 2 of 22
that he was carrying a pistol and is not even sure how it got there. In that case, I think his mens
rea is most likely just negligence, since he was not aware that the gun was there, but perhaps

should have been. Assuming that the court reads mens rea into the offense (and it is possible

they wouldn’t want to in the case of a drug crime), then Stringer can probably not be charged.

Death of Wee-Boy

What we can charge Avon with depends, as above, on whether the finalizing of the agreement
constitutes part of the felony, or if the felony is the actual exchange, which occurred later. If
their conduct at this point is part of the felony, then Avon may be able to be charged with felony
murder under the IL crim code. The code requires that Avon cause the death “in a manner that
facilitates the commission of the felony” however, and it is not clear that shooting Weeboy just
to shut him up would be in furtherance of the felony. On the other hand, he was making it
difficult for Avon, Stringer, and Vondas to complete the transaction, so arguably by killing him
Avon facilitated the transaction. If Avon is guilty of felony murder, than Vondas and Stringer
would be as well, because they are also in the course of the felony, and the statute only requires

that “any person” causes the death of another.

If Avon cannot be charged with felony murder, than he could be charged with regular murder or
manslaughter. We could argue that his mens rea was knowledge. Intent can be inferred by use
of a deadly weapon (see Carroll), but Avon will argue that he was only reckless, because it was
not “practically certain” that his conduct would result in a death. However, using a gun in such a
manner suggests extreme indifference to the value of human life, as does the fact that he is

(potentially) engaged in the course of a felony. The IL statute may supersede MPC 210.2(1)(b)


Student #1 Spring 09
Crim Final — 6/10/2009 — Masur/Harcourt
Page 3 of 22
with regard to the presumption while in the course of a felony, but if it does not, then we can
presume that Avon was behaving with extreme indifference, and he will have to present evidence
that he was not. Considering that he simply shrugged his shoulders upon seeing that he killed
Avon, it seems likely he truly is indifferent. If he is just plain reckless (and he may want to
argue extreme emotional disturbance because he is agitated by WeeBoy, although there is no

way ajury would find this to be a “reasonable explanation”) then we can at the least convict him

for manslaughter.

D'Angelo and Stringer

Stringer would obviously be guilty of murder for the death of D’Angelo. The more complicated
question here is what to charge Avon with. We could charge him with aggravated murder,
because he spent hours stewing over Stringer’s confession before driving over to Stringer’s
house to kill him. This certainly suggests planning (thought + driving to the house makes it hard
to argue an intent was not formed). Avon, however, will argue that he should only be charged
with manslaughter because he was under extreme emotional disturbance upon hearing of the
death of his nephew. Under 210.3(b) Avon would have to show that there was a reasonable
explanation for the disturbance, and the reasonableness is determined from the viewpoint of a
person in the actor’s situation under the circumstances as he believes them to be. The shock of
finding out a family member has been killed would certainly be provocation, and the MPC does
not have cooling off period requirements, so the fact that he “premeditated” would not count
against him in making this defense (and he could argue, as in Berry, that it only made him more
disturbed). Shock and extreme grief are part of the actor’s external situation, so they would be

taken into consideration by the jury here. Furthermore, the victim’s blameworthiness is high in


Student #1 Spring 09
Crim Final — 6/10/2009 — Masur/Harcourt
Page 4 of 22

this case (he’s a murderer), so this seems like an even better case for manslaughter than it does

for aggravated murder.

Attempted Robbery

Omar can be charged with attempted robbery of Namond and Marlo. Under the MPC, Omar is
guilty of an attempt if he purposely does anything which is an act constituting a substantial step
in the couse of conduct planned to culminate in the commission of the crime. 5.01(1)(c). Omar
took a substantial step just by staking out the location (5.01(2)(c)), plus the fact that he actually
entered the dwelling and threatened people with his gun. Omar’s defense will be that he
renounced his plan when he decided to “forget about it.” For a renunciation to provide a
defense, it must be complete and voluntary. In this case, Marlo’s threatens to hunt him down and
destroy him. Rather than being a voluntary renunciation as to Marlo, this seems more likely that
he abandoned his attempt because he realized it would be more difficult that he thought it would
be. This is not a voluntary attempt. MPC 5.01(4). The situation with Namond is a little bit
trickier. Namond pleads with him and attempts to appeal to his conscience by saying that he’s
trying to save up money for college. When Omar says “‘you’re both right” it’s as if he realizes it
would be wrong to take money from Namond. In his decision not to rob Namond, then, it is a
better case for renunciation “of his criminal purpose.” This case is very much like McNeal and
Ross. In both cases, a rape was prevented when the victim convinced the perpetrator not to
proceed. The court found in one case that this was unexpected resistance that made the
abandonment involuntary, but in the other, the court found that the victim had persuaded the
defendant to abandon the attempt, but had not prevented him from succeeding. This could turn

on the very same type of distinction, and there is no real way to tell how the case would come


Student #1 Spring 09
Crim Final — 6/10/2009 — Masur/Harcourt
Page 5 of 22

out. If the court did find that he was merely persuaded to abandon his attempt then he would

only be guilty of attempted robbery of Marlo.

Death of Omar

Note: although dead, Omar did return fire, so he could be charged with attempted murder or
manslaughter. He didn’t have any real hope of hitting them, so he may have just been reckless
since he couldn’t have known with “practical certainty” that they would connect (and they
didn’t) with anyone. He could also argue that he was provoked (under extreme emotional

disturbance) and the victims are certainly blameworthy here (although he is as well).

Marlo has decided, apparently, that ne needs to avenge his honor and decides to kill Omar.
Although Marlo was not at the scene of the crime from what it looks like, he can still be
convicted of attempted murder for committing a substantial step. Luring Omar to the location

26

falls under 5.01(2)(b) and is strongly corroborative of Marlo’s “criminal purpose” so this should
satisfy the attempt requirement. Furthermore, you are guilty of attempt if you engage in conduct

designed to aid another, even though the crime is not committed or attempted by the other.

5.01(3). Even if his minions cannot be convicted, Marlo should still be guilty.

What can Chris and Snoop be charged with? Well, if they cannot be charged with murder (more
below) they should be charged with attempted murder, since they took a substantial step in that
direction by open firing on Omar and they acted with purpose. However, I think we should first
try to charge them with murder, although there will be causation challenges. First, Omar
jumping out the window should not prevent them from being guilty, because at this point Omar

really had no other option. This is similar to the Kern case, in that they were chasing and


Student #1 Spring 09
Crim Final — 6/10/2009 — Masur/Harcourt
Page 6 of 22

attempting to kill him, forcing Omar to make a choice under duress. What Chris and Snoop will

argue is that they should not be responsible for what happened on the street.

Whether or not they can be held responsible depends on whether it would be “just” to find them
the proximate cause of Omar’s death. First, they are both but for causes as required by 2.03(1).
Had they not been shooting at him, he would not have jumped out the window. Had he not
jumped out the window, he would not have been hit, etc. Because they were acting with the
intent to kill, whether or not they are proximate causes falls under 2.03(2). One issue here would
be how we frame the “result.” If we state it as “the death of Omar” then this was “within the
purpose or contemplation” of both actors and they should be guilty. However, if it is framed as
“death by long fall and subsequently being run over” then this was not in the contemplation of
Chris and Snoop when they started open firing at Omar in the house. In that case, they can only
be the proximate cause if the actual result is not too remote or accidental in its occurrence to
have a just bearing on their liability. 2.03(2)(b). To determine whether or not the harm is too
remote or accidental, it might be helpful to consider the common law tests of zone of danger and
reasonable foreseeability. Under the zone of danger test, both the geographic vicinity and the
type of harm should be considered. Falling to the street (and not even the sidewalk) seems to
place Omar outside of the expected vicinity (although perhaps when engaging in a gun battle you
would expect an attempted escape), and the type of harm (car accident) was also not the type of
harm that would have been expected to cause his death. Under the foreseeability test, Chris and
Snoop can be convicted if the result was intended or reasonably related and foreseeable. This,
too, seems like a framing issue. They did intend his death, just not the manner in which it

happened. It doesn’t really seem foreseeable that the course of events would have unfolded as it


Student #1 Spring 09
Crim Final — 6/10/2009 — Masur/Harcourt
Page 7 of 22

did, so the foreseeability test would seem to exculpate them as well. Still, I think that this will

turn on how broadly you can frame the issue of the result they were expecting.

Next, what is McNulty’s culpability here? He was driving drunk down the wrong side of the
street. This suggests either recklessness or negligence. While he is not quite engaging in the
egregious conduct of Fleming, by driving on the wrong side of the street with a BAC at twice the
legal limit, I think recklessness is at least arguable. McNulty would argue that he was not aware
of the risk, but this is immaterial if the lack of awareness stems from drunkenness. This may
only be negligence — he wasn’t speeding, and you hear of higher BACs all the time — but I think
that driving on the wrong side of the road is particularly problematic and creates recklessness
here. It certainly seems like a gross deviation from what a law abiding person would do,
although maybe he could argue it was not a “substantial and unjustifiable risk” because it would
be unlikely that people could not avoid him and mitigate the harm he would cause. I wouldn’t
want to be making this argument in court (especially considering someone did die). If he is
reckless, he can be charged with manslaughter if he is also the cause (if he’s merely negligent, it
will be negligent homicide). There is an intervening actor. Prez saw McNulty’s car but
“figured” that he would straighten his car out. His culpability would either be recklessness or
negligence. First, is this a “substantial and unjustifiable risk”? It is not really clear how big of a
risk he took by not stopping, and it seems reasonable to expect that another person would not
continue to drive on the wrong side of the road when faced with oncoming traffic. On the other
hand, he knew that the car was on the wrong side of the road, so he “consciously disregarded” the
risk that an accident could take place when he did nothing about it. This would turn on what the

jury thinks a reasonable or law abiding person would do, and then judge whether it was a gross


Student #1 Spring 09
Crim Final — 6/10/2009 — Masur/Harcourt
Page 8 of 22

deviation from that. He can be charged with either manslaughter (recklessness) or negligent

homicide for the death of Omar.

Death of Prez

McNulty is the best candidate for liability here, as it was his recklessness/negligence that caused
Prez to swerve, so he could be charged with manslaughter or criminal negligence. He could
argue that he was not the cause but that it was Prez’s shock at running over Omar, but I think that
because McNulty would still be a but for cause of that incident and because he was committing a
crime by drunk driving, it was foreseeable and not too remote that he would cause an accident
and the death of another, so he should be charged. I do not think that Chris and Snoop could be
charged here, because it really was not in there contemplation at all, and they hardly could have

foreseen the drunken police officer.

Bodie, Poot, Wallace

Lastly, the small time drug dealers sent to scare Wallace. This is not a voluntary drug
transaction or a purchase of cocaine, so there shouldn’t be any felony charges for possession
here. Bodie can be charged with murder for recklessness plus extreme indifference. In the
roulette cases we read (Malone, Roe), the defendants were convicted of murder, even though in
the latter case the boy expressed anguish at the result, just as Bodie does here. On the other
hand, this case is a bit different because Bodie doesn’t think there are any bullets in the gun. In
that case, he can argue that he was not extremely indifferent and possibly not even reckless,

because he had no intention of endangering anyone, he simply wanted to scare Wallace. I think


Student #1 Spring 09
Crim Final — 6/10/2009 — Masur/Harcourt
Page 9 of 22

that this will be at least recklessness though, because even if you think you took out the bullets, it

is a dangerous weapon and there is always a risk a mistake could be made.

Poot can be charged with the murder of Bodie. He could possibly be charged with murder, since
some jurisdictions find that no amount of time is too short for premeditation. Carroll. On the
other hand, he could argue extreme emotional disturbance because he just witnessed “poor
Wallace” get shot. His victim was blameworthy, but as was the case for some of the other
criminals here who may want to argue this, they are equally blameworthy, and I’m not sure a
jury will be sympathetic (or find it a reasonable explanation). At the least, he can be charged
with manslaughter, but I think we are likely to get murder here. He had to know with “practical

certainty” that the death would result by shooting Bodie in the head. 2.02(2)(b).

Question 2

The manslaughter rule can be defended from both a utilitarian and retributivist perspective.
From a retributivist perspective, people are punished because they deserve it for their
wrongdoing. When a victim is blameworthy, the wrongdoing may be “less” because the person
you’ve killed is also a wrongdoer. The traditional categories described in Girouard for allowing
mitigation include extreme assault/battery, mutual combat, and abuse of a loved one. When the
“victim” of the crime a person commits has also committed a crime, then the fact that one is
provoked to murder them says more about the situation the person found themselves in than it

does about the depravity or personality of the person who committed the murder.

A prerequisite to punishment from a utilitarian perspective is that people are rational calculators.
In the context of provocation, the person who commits the crime may not be rational because of
the actions of the victim. In Maher, the court found that it was a jury question whether or not the
circumstances might naturally cause a reasonable person in the passion of the moment to lose
control and kill. Victim blameworthiness is relevant here because there is a loss of control, and
the actor murdered because he was made irrational by the conduct of the victim. Furthermore,
one of the main goals of utilitarianism is deterrence. While one could argue that killing is bad
even when provoked and should be deterred, in this situation the best person to prevent the crime
was the victim. Furthermore, if the actor has in fact become inflamed by passion due to the
provocation, it is possible that no threat of punishment would be able to deter him in that
moment. This would be a theoretical rather than empirical observation — a study might show
that, for this reason, we should inflict even harsher penalties to generate deterrence in situations

like these.


Student #1 Spring 09
Crim Final — 6/10/2009 — Masur/Harcourt
Page 11 of 22
On the other hand, neither theory completely supports the use of victim blameworthiness.
For one thing, there may be something distasteful about using a victim’s immoral conduct to
mitigate another’s crime, as though suggesting that their life is somehow less deserving of
protection because they have done a wrong. From a retributivist perspective, where punishments
stem from a need to enforce the social contract, it may be problematic to allow people to claim
that because someone else did a bad thing, they should be able to escape from the burdens of the
societal contract. If the victim has done something truly blameworthy, than both parties should
be punished to the extent of their culpability. Where punishment serves as a communication to
the perpetrator that their rights are not more important than their victims, allowing the bad actor
to get away with the crime suggests that they are allowed to break the rules, which could have
floodgate effects that are undesirable. We really don’t want people to “breach the contract” for

any reason, and not allowing mitigation would be one way to stress the importance of adhering

to society’s rules.

From a utilitarian perspective, there is cause for concern that people will begin resorting
to “self-help” rather than the law. If the goal is to increase social welfare, this would hardly be
achieved by an increase in vigilante behavior. The world is probably a better place when people
can put their faith in the law to protect them, even if they have behaved badly. In a culture where
fear of crime is already very high, allowing people to take the law into their own hands (and I
know that this isn’t entirely accurate — the actors are still guilty of manslaughter) does not seem
desirable. An additional problem would be that by convicting less people of murder, you will
create less deterrence, both on general and specific level. Because certainty of conviction is

greater deterrent than severity, seeing less people convicted of murders might create less


Student #1 Spring 09
Crim Final — 6/10/2009 — Masur/Harcourt
Page 12 of 22

deterrence in the general public and for criminals, who will think they are less likely to be

convicted.

On the whole, though, I think that victim blameworthiness is a good indicator of whether or not
the crime should be murder or manslaughter, because we don’t, ultimately, want to convict
people for crimes that we ourselves would have been unable to resist or that we can at least
sympathize with and understand. Although arguably a reasonable person would never give in
and would always find it hard to commit murder, there may be circumstances where we do view
the bad actor a little bit more favorably, and where the victim has contributed to their own

demise this seems most likely to be the case.

Question 3

(1) Death of Officer Edwards — Santiago

Mr. Santiago’s first defense would be self-defense. Use of force is justified when the
actor believes it is immediately necessary for the purpose of protecting himself against death or
serious bodily injury. 3.04(2(b). Here, Officer Edwards is pointing a pistol in his direction, and
it is not clear at this point whether anyone has even realized that Officer Edwards is an off-duty
police officer. Furthermore, the officer manual requires that an off-duty officer yield to on duty
officers in making an arrest, so he should not have been pointing a gun in the first place. This
makes Santiago’s self-defense claim a bit stronger. (On the other hand, Edwards may not have
been acting in an official capacity at this point, but was simply trying to defend himself against
Santiago.) He could also present an insanity defense based on the fact that he began trembling as
if having a seizure and then lunged at Officer Edwards. This suggests an irresistible impulse (if
that test is used in this jurisdiction), and Santiago can argue that he was completely deprived of

the power of choice or volition at the time he lunged at Officer Edwards.

Santiago has two problems here. First, the use of force is not justifiable to resist an arrest
(3.04(2)(a)(i)) nor is deadly force justifiable if the actor provoked the use of force against himself
or if he can avoid the use of force by retreating (b)(i)-(ii). In this case, even if Santiago did not
know that Edwards was a police officer, he did know that the police had cornered him and were
telling him to drop his weapon. If this is the case, he should not be able to use self-defense. In

terms of the insanity defense, trembling does not suggest an irresistible impulse of the level


Student #1 Spring 09
Crim Final — 6/10/2009 — Masur/Harcourt
Page 14 of 22

required to be insane. Without any other evidence that Santiago suffers from a mental illness,

this should not exculpate Santiago’s conduct.

How good Santiago’s defenses are depends in part on what he was doing with regard to
Edward’s car. If he was behaving innocently and then Edwards began chasing him, then his self-
defense claim would be much stronger. If he was in fact planning to steal the car, then he likely
would be considered to have provoked the use of force against himself, in addition to recklessly
placing himself in the situation, making his use of force unjustifiable under 3.09. How broadly
the time frame is defined will also make a difference. If the fact that he was being chased by an
armed man (not known to be an officer) is included, then his self-defense claim is stronger. If
time stops once he is surrounded by the police officers and knows there police officers, his use of

force is not justified and he will be guilty.

Attempted homicide of Santiago — Mr. Estrada

Mr. Estrada’s defense should be defense of others under 3.05, because he was trying to
protect Edwards from Santiago. He can also argue duress under 2.09 because he was ordered to
go get the officers’ weapons by Santiago who was carrying a gun. A better defense might be
necessity for this particular crime, because he wasn’t forced to shoot Santiago by coercion, but

he was certainly afraid and confused at the time.

The prosecution’s best argument here is that the force was not justified because he
recklessly or negligently injured an innocent person. MPC 3.09(3). This makes his conduct

unjustifiable. Furthermore, although he may have been trying to defend Estrada, his intent here


Student #1 Spring 09
Crim Final — 6/10/2009 — Masur/Harcourt
Page 15 of 22

is not entirely clear, and he was not in any particular danger himself, so he cannot claim self-

defense.

Mr. Estrada should have a good claim to necessity here. Necessity is a more subjective
standard than the choice of evils MPC approach, and so the jury would not be required to find
that the harm he sought to avoid was greater than the harm he committed. In the situation he was
in, it seems reasonable that a person of “reasonable firmness” might react on instinct and believe
that force was needed, even if that belief later turned out to be erroneous (see MPC 3.04(2)(c) —
an actor may estimate the necessity of force). The biggest problem though is that he created a
risk to innocent people. He could argue that this was not reckless or negligent, because the risk
to the people on the street was so great, and that even a reasonable person should not have been

aware objectively that a bullet might wound someone through a window.

Attempted homicide of Silvio Bordengo — Mr. Estrada

Estrada’s defenses here would be similar to the ones above — necessity/duress. This
victim is different because he is a known police officer and because Estrada had no intent to aim

for him.

The prosecution would probably present the same arguments here as well. This was an
unjustifiable risk that innocent people would be harmed. While Estrada can claim duress for

removing the officers of their guns, perhaps, he cannot extend the claim to the use of the gun.

Estrada should be convicted of both these crimes or neither, although this crime seems
more accidental. One issue in Estrada’s favor is that he potentially doesn’t speak English. If that

is the case, then he may not realize that any of the parties involved are police officers. This


Student #1 Spring 09
Crim Final — 6/10/2009 — Masur/Harcourt
Page 16 of 22
would make his case for necessity even stronger, because he wouldn’t even realize that the
adverse parties were attempting to arrest Santiago and prevent harm. Instead he would view
them as aggressors. I’m not sure if lack of knowledge of English is a defense that can be raised
for a person living in an English speaking country, but if he can raise it, he should, because it

would certainly support his belief that force was immediately necessary and would make his

conduct more justifiable.

(4) Assault of Harding — Mr. Estrada

Mr. Estrada can argue similar offense to those above — duress, necessity, choice of evils,
etc. The prosecution will be similar in pointing to 3.09 and arguing that this was reckless
endangerment of innocent people. Certainly Sandra had nothing to do with the crime on the

street.

Mr. Estrada’s best chance here would be that the harm was too remote and so he should
not be considered the proximate cause. What he should argue is that the geographic vicinity he
needed to be concerned with was only the street. Perhaps there was no one else on the street and
so there was no reason to think that anyone would be harmed by his actions. Whether or not
nearby stores would be included in a reasonable person’s assessment of the risk involved in
shooting a gun on the street would be left to the jury. Another fact in his favor would be that it
was very late at night, so even an objectively reasonable person might not expect to have to

account for risks to people that would be shopping, since most stores are closed by this time.

(5) Accomplice liability — officers Anzelino and Musante


Student #1 Spring 09
Crim Final — 6/10/2009 — Masur/Harcourt
Page 17 of 22
A party is liable as an accomplice if with the purpose of promoting or facilitating its
commission he aids or attempts to aid another person in the crime. 2.06(3). Without having
fired any shots themselves, their liability would be tough to prove. The defense can argue, first,
that they didn’t have purpose. Second, the defense should argue that there was no crime here
because the force was justified under 3.07. Force is justifiable under that section if the actor
believes it is immediately necessary to effect a lawful arrest or to prevent a crime. At the time
that Officer Dunton fired, all the officers knew about him was that he was an armed man

pointing his gun in their direction. In that case, the use of force was justified by Officer Dunton,

and there is no crime to charge them as accomplices to.

The prosecution’s best argument here turns on the factual circumstances, which seem to
negate the immediately necessary requirement for the use of force. First of all, the officers are
15 feet away and are hiding behind their car. There is no real need at this point to fire, even if a
gun is being pointed in their direction. They could have done something different, such as
announce that they were police officers, but they chose not to. Furthermore, if they were
attempting to arrest him and not just prevent him from committing crimes, then they would have

to make known that they were arresting him, which they did not do. 3.07(2)(a).

These officers should have a fairly good chance of escaping conviction because they did
not actually do the firing, and didn’t even really aid Officer Dunton in his shooting of Edwards.

The better case for liability for this incident is Dunton.

(6) Edwards’s homicide — Dunton


Student #1 Spring 09
Crim Final — 6/10/2009 — Masur/Harcourt
Page 18 of 22

Dunton’s defenses would be use of force as law enforcement under 3.07 and self-defense

under 3.04. Considering the discussion above, even if Dunton was not justified in using force as
a police officer (failure to warn — although he did order him to drop his weapon, potentially not a
felony arrest, did not make known he was a police officer) he can still claim self-defense. A gun
was being pointed at him, and so deadly force was threatened. He “believed” it was necessary to

protect himself so he was justified in using force in this instance. Furthermore, he has no duty to

retreat because he is a public officer in the performance of his duties. 3.04( 2)(b)(ii)(2).

The fact is, force was not immediately necessary here. Although the situation was
chaotic and there was a lot of shooting, all of the harm could have been prevented if Officer
Dunton has simply chosen another course of action. He should have announced he was an
officer, but he didn’t. He just fired. This was an unproportional response to the actions of

Officer Edwards.

Dunton’s likelihood of success is average. A police officer making a judgment call in the
line of duty is entitled to some deference, but where there were other, less harmful options, it
seems as though he was unjustified in the amount of force he took and should face criminal
liability (although homicide may be a little strong considering the other people involved in

bringing about this death).

Question 4

The objective-subjective spectrum is useful as a starting point in understanding what
types of evidence a jury should, in theory, consider based on the subjectivity of the belief, but it
is limited by the fact that the language of a particular self-defense statute’s belief requirement
will not necessarily map on to the actual evidence admitted or the jury’s interpretation of the

facts in any particular case.

In a trial, a prosecutor would want the most objective standard — a reasonable person
belief standard. The defense would want the most subjective standard — the actor believes. In
theory, the standard used should limit what evidence can be considered by the jury in
determining whether or not self-defense was justified in any particular context. In theory, this

should also affect jury/trial outcomes.

In reality, though, is evidence really excluded based on the statutory language?
Furthermore, does a jury really understand (or care) what that language says? First, regardless of
the standard, whether or not evidence should be admitted can always be manipulated. For
instance, in the battered spouse syndrome context, if there is a purely objective “reasonable
person” standard, the prosecution would argue for the exclusion of any evidence of past abuse.
However, the defense attorney can always argue that there is no way to understand a reasonable
person’s belief other than to consider a reasonable person who has been abused for seven years.
The CLS articles we read suggest that law is rhetoric, and that no matter what you try to argue,
there will be equally good arguments on both sides. In this case, advocacy would be the

determinative factor in what evidence the jury gets to hear, not whether or not the statute says

“believes and is reasonable” or “ reasonable person would believe.” What seems to be partially
driving both CLS and the Hohfieldan system of rights we looked at in the euthanasia context is
the fact that words and language are indeterminate and that, in the legal context, words can be
used to disguise what are really just legal conclusions or determinism. In the case of battered

women, what evidence is let in will not necessarily be determined by the language, but by the

arguments made about the language and the conclusions drawn from those arguments.

Furthermore, regardless of the standard, a jury may not decide the case any differently.
In the Goetz case, the defendant’s standard was changed from “believes and is reasonable to
him” and “reasonably believes” a somewhat more objective standard. The jury still acquitted
him of the charges. Regardless of the amount of objectivity placed in a statute or the limitations
placed on the evidence, according to Kahan, a jury will still interpret the facts based on their
ideology and worldview. Kahan’s theory is that certain orientations toward the worl —
individualist, hierarchical, communitarian, egalitarian — cause people to derive what the facts are.
If juries are relying on worldviews to derive facts and form their theory of the case, it should not
be that important whether they are supposed to view it from a subjective or objective standard.
A juror will determine whether the actor was justified based on their belief-system, not on a

statute.

This is similar to the Szasz argument that, in the insanity context, juries are supposed to
be deciding insanity as a matter of fact, but that they actually form theories as to why the
defendant committed the crime and then determine whether it was insane. In the context of self-

defense, I think a jury is more likely to develop their theory of why the defendant acted as he did

and only then determine whether or not it was justified. The subjectivity or objectivity of the

standard of belief is not going to be particularly persuasive.

Another reason why the continuum is good only in theory is that beliefs about what
occurred are formed based on unconscious constructs (see Kelman). While arguably a more
objective standard narrows the time frame that will be considered, unconscious constructs are
used to affirm worldviews. If this is mapped onto Kahan’s arguments, this would mean that if a
worldview leads one to believe that Goetz, for example, was justified in using self-defense, they
will then view time frame, intent, and the defendant in a light that will affirm this belief. In this
particular case that could mean stopping the time frame at the time Goetz was approached in the
car. Regardless of what is included or excluded about the past, if a jury stops the time frame
here, Goetz seems more justified than he would if you considered the events from the time he
realized they weren’t armed, or from the time he’d shot the first three of the youths. The thrust
of Kelman’s argument, which fits nicely with the Szasz theory above, is that people only make
legal arguments after characterizing a situation nonrationally. In this case, the jury will
characterize the situation and then apply the standard. The standard, which is intended to be
used in part to characterize the situation, has very little work to do once the jury has already done

that through unconscious constructs.

I think that ultimately, the continuum is very helpful in considering the range of
objectivity and subjectivity that could be included in a statute. In reality, though, what evidence
can be admitted and what the jury ultimately decides may come down to what “seems right” or
fair or justified. If a woman has been severely beaten by her husband for seven years, then it

seems fair to allow her to present that evidence to mitigate her own actions. If a man who has

been subjected to urban violence in the past, reacts more intensely to a subsequent threat of
violence, it may be fair to allow this evidence as well. In truth, it is not necessarily a bad thing
that a court or a jury would make judgment calls based on what’s right, rather than on what is in
the statute. While people may be concerned about fair notice of what sort of conduct is expected
of them if judges and juries are making decisions based on their own internal scale of justice, as
Kelman and others have pointed out, law is indeterminate. Statutes, no matter how specific, are
always open to interpretation. A good advocate should argue for the evidence they need
admitted or excluded, but a determination of what an actor believes is less likely to rest on what
the statute says or even what the evidence says, but on what the decisionmaker is capable of
understanding. A jury is more likely to be cognizant of facts that confirm their worldviews, and
understanding how to work within the preexisting ideologies brought to courtroom is the best
way to create a justification for self-defense, rather than looking at subjectivity of objectivity of

belief in a statute.
