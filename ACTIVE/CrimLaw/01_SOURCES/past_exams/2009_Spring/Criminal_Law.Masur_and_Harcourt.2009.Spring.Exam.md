PROFESSORS JONATHAN MASUR AND
BERNARD HARCOURT

WINTER — SPRING 2009
Final Examination

This is an open-book, three hour, in-class examination. You may refer to any
materials you like, but you may not talk to or confer with anyone else.

This examination consists of 10 pages total (including this cover sheet).

This examination consists of two parts that will be graded evenly (50% and 50%).
The first part corresponds to the first quarter taught by Professor Masur. The second part
corresponds to the second quarter taught by Professor Harcourt. You should spend 90
minutes on each part since they will be weighed equally toward the final grade.

Professor Masur’s part consists of 2 questions. The first question is worth 75% of
the total for that part; the second question is worth 25%. Professor Harcourt’s part
consists of two questions that will be graded evenly (50% and 50%), so you should spend
45 minutes on each question.

You may answer the questions in any order that suits you. Please begin the
answer to each question on a new page, noting clearly the question that you are
responding to. Each exam answer page should include a header containing your student
exam number, the name of the examination, and the pagination, specifying the last page
(e.g. “Student 3547, Criminal Law, page 3 of 12”).

Please double space your answers with one-inch margins and use a 12 point New
Times Roman font.

Your answers should be specifically tailored to the questions. You should not cut
and paste any materials from your notes. In fact, if you feel tempted to cut and paste
materials from your notes, you should immediately think to yourself that the materials are
not sufficiently tailored to the question that we are asking.

If you think you need more information to answer a question, or if you think
something is ambiguous, please explain what you need or what is ambiguous, and then
make whatever assumptions you need to make in order to answer the question.

Good luck on the exam and have a great summer.

PART I—- MASUR
Masur Question |

Avon and Stringer are leaders of a drug ring in west Chicago, and Wee-Bey is one
of their top henchmen. One day, Avon, Stringer, and Wee-Bey were in the process of
arranging the purchase of a large quantity (approximately 100 kilograms) of cocaine from
their supplier, Vondas. (Purchasing or selling more than 10 kilograms of cocaine is a
felony.) At a meeting to finalize the deal, Stringer and Avon were sitting and talking
with Vondas at a table while Wee-Bey stood in the background, talking on his cell phone.
Wee-Bey was talking fairly loudly, however, and it was hard for Avon, Stringer, and
Vondas to make themselves heard over the racket he was causing. On a couple of
occasions, Stringer turned around to Wee-Bey and told him to shut up, but each time
Wee-Bey ignored the instructions. Finally, an exasperated Avon, fed up with Wee-Bey’s
interruptions, yelled at Wee-Bey to be quiet, drew his gun, and without turning around
from the table (Wee-Bey was behind him) pointed the gun behind his back and fired a
shot in Wee-Bey’s direction. Avon’s aim was impeccable—maybe too good. The bullet
struck Wee-Bey square in the chest, and he died instantly. At this point Avon turned
around and glanced at Wee-Bey, saw that he was dead, and shrugged his shoulders.

Avon, Stringer, and Vondas concluded their conversation, finalized the deal, and
then departed. (The drugs were later exchanged successfully.) As they were walking
away from the meeting, Stringer realized that he had been carrying a pistol in his
briefcase the whole time. He hadn’t meant to bring it with him—he didn’t think that he
would need it—but someone, perhaps Avon, must have slipped it into his briefcase for
him. Or perhaps it was left over in the briefcase from when he had taken the briefcase to
a prior, potentially more violent, meeting; Stringer wasn’t certain.

Several weeks later, Stringer and Avon were talking about the recent, mysterious
death of Avon’s nephew D’Angelo. “There’s something I have to tell you,” Stringer
explained to Avon. “I had D’Angelo killed. I had to. He was a danger to us, and that
was not about to change.” Avon looked at Stringer in shock. He felt all of the blood rush
to his head, and a ringing sounded in his ears as his eyesight began to go blurry. The
shock in his eyes turned to hatred. “If you think about this for a while, you’ll see I did
the right thing,” Stringer explained. He walked away, leaving Avon standing speechless.
Avon did think about it, and the more he thought, the angrier he grew. What right did
Stringer have to do this, to make this decision without consulting him? After a couple of
hours of pacing and thinking, Avon could no longer take it, and he grew resolute.
Stringer was going to have to pay for this. Avon grabbed his gun, drove to Stringer’s
apartment, and shot him twice in the head, killing him.

Omar is an armed robber in west Chicago who makes his living by stealing
money and drugs from drug dealers. He likes to rob only serious dealers, people he
thinks have done bad things and made the streets less safe. One day, after staking out a
known drug safe house, Omar burst in through the front door of the safe house, shotgun
drawn. Inside he found two dealers: Namond, a young, small-time street dealer, and
Marlo, the head of a major crime organization and perhaps the most powerful man in
west Chicago. “Hand over your drugs and money!” he demanded. “Please don’t make
me do this,” Namond pleaded, pulling his small stack of bills close to himself. “I’m
trying to save up money for college.” “You’d better not take my money, either,” Marlo
growled, keeping a firm grip on his extremely large stack of bills. “If you rob me, I will
hunt you down and destroy you.” Omar glanced back and forth between the two people
and considered the situation. “You know,” he said, “you’re both right. Forget about it.”
With that, he turned around and walked out.

Marlo hardly gave up on Omar, however. He arranged to lure Omar into a trap—
Omar would be induced to try to rob another one of Marlo’s safe houses, where Marlo’s
associates Chris and Snoop would be waiting for him. The minute Omar entered the
second floor of the house in search of drugs or money to steal, Chris and Snoop opened
fire on him, Omar fired a few shots at Chris in return (though without any real hope of
hitting him), and then dove behind a couch to escape the hail of bullets from the two
assailants. Omar realized quickly that he would never be able to shoot his way out of the
house; he was going to have to make a run for it. He sprang up and dashed towards a
large picture window, Chris and Snoop firing behind him (but failing to connect). Omar
leapt at the window, crashed through it, and fell down to the street below, landing in the
gutter. (The gutter is part of the street; Omar went through the window at such a high
rate of speed that he managed to clear the sidewalk entirely.)

A one-story fall like this would not normally have been too dangerous to a young,
athletic person such as Omar, but here the fall was not the only peril Omar faced.
Despite the fact that it was the middle of the afternoon, a police detective named
McNulty was driving drunk down the wrong side of the street, which happened to be the
side where Omar had just landed. (McNulty’s blood-alcohol content was 0.16, twice the
legal limit.) Heading towards him in a separate car was Prez, another police detective
(who was sober). Prez saw McNulty’s police car approaching on the wrong side of the
street from a block away, but he figured that McNulty would straighten his car out and
did nothing. Only when McNulty was a mere 50 feet from Prez’s bumper (and closing
fast) did Prez realize that there was a genuine danger of a crash, and he swerved to his
right (towards the curb) to avoid McNulty. Unfortunately for everyone involved, Omar
had just landed in the gutter, directly in Prez’s path. Prez struck Omar directly, killing
him instantly. Prez was so shocked by this collision that he then lost control of his car.

Prez’s car hopped the curb and smashed into a telephone pole on the sidewalk, killing
Prez immediately as well. McNulty continued blithely up the street, oblivious to the
wreckage behind him.

Bodie, Poot, and Wallace are three small-time drug dealers who work for Avon.
One day Avon heard that Wallace was considering quitting the business of drug dealing
and “going straight.” Avon worried that Wallace might be tempted to snitch to the police
if he were no longer involved in the drug trade, and so he sent Bodie and Poot to scare
Wallace and make sure he knew that he couldn’t leave the life of crime so easily. In
order to show Wallace that they meant business, Bodie brought along a gun, but before
heading off he emptied the bullets out of the clip and loaded it with blanks. Bodie then
joined up with Poot, and together they confronted Wallace. Bodie pulled out his gun and
pointed it at Wallace. “I know you’re thinking about going straight,” he snarled, “and
that’s plain stupid. First of all, give me your money as a tax on being stupid.” Wallace
handed over a small wad of bills. “You know what happens to stupid people, don’t you?”
Bodie inquired nastily, and fired a “shot” (actually a blank) at Wallace. Wallace jumped
in terror and began to shake out of fright. “How do you feel about trying to get out
now?” Bodie snarled again, and fired three more shots (also blanks) at Wallace, who by
this point was struck dumb with fear. Finally, Bodie yelled, “I don’t ever want to hear
anything about you leaving our organization again!” He fired one last shot directly at
Wallace. This time, however, it was a live round, not a blank. When Bodie had unloaded
the bullets from his gun, he thought he had been careful to get all of them out, but he had
obviously missed one at the bottom of the clip. The bullet struck Wallace in the chest,
and he collapsed in a heap on the ground.

Horrified, Bodie himself fell to his knees, crying and distraught over what he had
done. “You idiot!” screamed Poot. “How could you do that to poor Wallace!?! You
weren’t supposed to actually hurt him!” Poot pulled out his own gun and shot Bodie in
the head, killing him. Fearing that he might himself be arrested, Poot then fled the scene,
leaving Wallace bleeding on the ground. Wallace died of his injury ten hours later.

You work for the State’s Attorney of the State of Illinois, where these events took
place. Illinois has adopted the MPC in its entirety, and has adopted the following
criminal statutes as well:

Ill. Crim. Code § 1.1 — Murder committed after willful premeditation is considered
aggravated murder and is subject to [higher criminal penalties].

Ill. Crim. Code § 1.2 — It is a felony to purchase or sell more than 10 kilograms of
cocaine.

Ill. Crim. Code § 1.3 — It is a felony to take any property belonging to any other person
using force or the threat of force. [This crime is referred to as “robbery”; if the force or
threat of force involves the use of a weapon, the crime is known as “armed robbery.”
There are also the crimes of attempted robbery and attempted armed robbery, which
adhere to the usual rules of attempt set forth in the MPC.]

Ill. Crim. Code § 1.4 — It is a felony to possess a handgun in the course of a consensual
(voluntary) drug transaction.

Ill. Crim. Code § 1.5 — A person who is guilty of a completed crime is not also guilty of
attempt to commit that crime.

Ill. Crim. Code § 1.6 — A person is guilty of murder if, in the course of the commission of
a felony or an attempt to commit a felony, any person causes the death of any other
individual in a manner that facilitates the commission of the felony or attempt to commit
it.

The State’s Attorney is interested in charging the people mentioned above with
any crimes that they may have committed. (He even wishes to charge people who may
already be dead.) Please prepare a memo explaining who is guilty of what crimes and
why, and outlining what problems or issues there might be in prosecuting them. If one of
these people is plausibly guilty of a crime (even if you don’t believe that the person is
actually guilty of the crime), please describe and analyze that case as well.

You should confine your analysis of the crimes and potential hurdles or
defenses to the material from the first quarter of the class. In particular, you should
limit your discussion to the crimes of homicide and those listed in the Illinois
statutes above. For instance, you should not discuss any other possible property crimes
beyond those listed above, or any conspiracy charges, or any possibility of self-defense as
a defense to any crime.

Masur Question 2

In class we described the manslaughter doctrine as resting on the blameworthiness
of the victim: we mitigate the defendant’s crime down from murder to manslaughter
(with its lesser penalties) when the victim has done something judged to be wrong.

Can the manslaughter rule be defended on a utilitarian or a retributive basis? Both?
Neither? Using the manslaughter cases we read to provide examples (if necessary),
analyze the doctrine of manslaughter according to both theories and explain why
utilitarian and retributivist thinkers would or would not support the manslaughter rule.

PART II - HARCOURT
Harcourt Question 1

It’s May 28, 2009, late at night. You just got woken up by a call from your office
and they need you. On the way in, you read the following bulletin on your i-Phone:

Officer Edwards, 25, assigned to the NYC Housing Bureau’s Impact Response
Team, left work shortly before 10:30 p.m., about four hours early. He was no
longer in uniform, but carried his service revolver. He walked out a back entrance
on East 124th Street and toward his car, a Nissan, parked on Second Avenue.

A surveillance camera from a construction site captured Edwards running;
investigators believe Edwards may have seen a man — later identified as Miguel
Santiago, 42, unemployed, without papers, who recently entered the country
illegally — peering into the window of Edwards’ car, and may have believed he
was going to break into the car.

The video showed part of a struggle between the two and a group of people
watching from outside a bodega (little store nearby). One of the men at the
bodega reported that, prior to the fight, Officer Edwards used a racial epithet
against Mr. Santiago. The video then showed Mr. Santiago wriggling out of his
black outer shirt, running north toward 125th Street and turning right.

Officer Edwards, trailing 20 feet behind, had his Smith & Wesson 9-millimeter
out, and was running with it. Mr. Santiago later told the police that he ran when
Edwards pulled out the weapon.

At the same time, an unmarked police car — with Officer Paulo Musante at the
wheel; Officer Dunton to his right; and Sgt. Tom Anzelino in the back seat, all of
whom were in plain clothes and were operating undercover as part of an anti-
crime unit — turned onto 125th Street from First Avenue. At midblock they saw
an armed man chasing an unarmed man.

The three officers noticed that one of the two, the one who was chasing, had a
silver gun in his hand. As the officers pulled the car to a stop, the two men ran in
front of them, with Mr. Santiago passing them and running toward First Avenue.
At that moment, Officer Edwards was in front of the car.

Mr. Santiago said he saw three men get out of the car, and said he heard one of
them, who had a gun, say, “Drop it!” Sergeant Anzelino and Officer Musante said
they heard Officer Dunton yell, “Stop, drop the gun, drop the gun!”

Masur-Harcourt Criminal Law Exam 2009

Officer Edwards turned, and the nose of his Smith & Wesson pistol turned with
him, toward Officer Dunton. From behind the unmarked car’s door, where he had
taken cover, Officer Dunton fired his gun from a distance of 15 feet. He fired his
gun four times. One shot hit Officer Edwards in the abdomen. Edwards falls to the
floor and his gun discharged, hitting Samuel Ortega in the leg. Mr. Ortega had
been standing in front of the bodega watching the chase with his friends.

Mr. Santiago grabs Officer Edwards’ gun and runs over to where Mr. Ortega fell
and where two of the other men (Raphael Estrada and Silvio Bordengo) remain,
crouched, tending to Ortega. Santiago points his gun at the three undercover
police officers — Anzelino, Musante and Dunton — and orders them to drop their
weapons, which they do. Still pointing his gun at the three officers, Mr. Santiago
then tells Mr. Estrada in Spanish to go get their weapons. Estrada is confused and
scared and does not know what is going on, but, hearing what he thinks is an
order from Santiago, he complies and goes to get the three guns of the undercover
police officers.

During all of this, Officer Edwards is screaming in pain, writhing on the floor.
Clutching his abdomen with his left arm, Edwards then reaches into his jacket
with his right arm and pulls out a small pistol (what is referred to as a “throw
away’’) and points it at Santiago.

While all this is happening, Sergeant Anzelino screams, “We are the police! Drop
your gun!”

Hearing Officer Edwards screaming and in pain, seeing Officer Edwards point the
small pistol in his direction, and hearing Sergeant Anzelino, Mr. Santiago starts
trembling as if he is about to have a seizure, lunges at Officer Edwards and shoots
towards Edwards twice, with one bullet entering Edwards’ abdomen. Mr.
Santiago then turns toward Ortega, who is also on the ground, writhing in pain
and screaming for help.

When Mr. Estrada sees this, Estrada immediately fires six shots in the direction of
Mr. Santiago: one shot hits Silvio Bordengo; one shot hits Santiago; the other
four shots go through the window of the bodega and wound a customer, Sandra
Harding, who was hiding in the store.

In a daze, Mr. Estrada drops his gun and falls to the floor. At that point about
twenty police cruisers swarm the area and take control of the situation. It’s about
10:33 p.m. when all the guns are recovered.

Officer Edwards was taken to Harlem Hospital Center, where he died at 11:55
p.m. Mr. Santiago is taken into custody and taken to Mount Sinai Hospital, where
he is tended to and is in non-critical condition. Silvio Bordengo is taken by
ambulance to Mount Sinai, where he too is tended to. He is in critical condition
in the ICU. Sandra Harding is taken to Mount Sinai and taken care of. She is not
in critical condition.

Investigators from the Internal Affairs Bureau are conducting formal interviews
— known in police parlance as GO-15, for the old Patrol Guide provision that
governs such sessions. They talked to Sergeant Anzelino and Officer Musante.
The department’s policy manual — the Patrol Guide — is specific in putting the
responsibility on the off-duty officer in situations of conflict. In one section, titled
“confrontation situations,” it says that if an off-duty officer is trying to make an
arrest and is confronted by an on-duty officer, the off-duty officer must abandon
the arrest effort and comply with the on-duty officer’s orders.

In response to questions about whether race was involved in the shooting, the
NYPD reported that Officer Edwards was black; Officer Dunton and the two
other police officers at the scene were white; Mr. Santiago, Mr. Ortega, Mr.
Estrada and Mr. Bordengo, are Hispanic. Sandra Harding is white. Dunton,
Anzelino and Musante are immediately placed on administrative duty pending
further investigation.

When you get to the office, there is a bunch of paperwork on your desk amidst the
dirty coffee cups. Your boss tells you that it looks like the following charges are likely:

1. Mr. Santiago will probably be charged with homicide for the death of Officer
Edwards.

2. Mr. Estrada will probably be charged with attempted homicide for the
shooting of Mr. Santiago.

3. Mr. Estrada will probably be charged with attempted homicide for the
shooting of Silvio Bordengo.

4. Mr. Estrada will probably be charged with assault for the injury to Sandra
Harding.

5. Police Officers Anzelino and Musante will probably be charged, under
accomplice liability, for the death of Officer Edwards.

6. Police officer Dunton will probably be charged with homicide for the death of
Officer Edwards.

Masur-Harcourt Criminal Law Exam 2009

Your boss wants you to give her the real deal on these possible prosecutions. She
wants a quick memo. Specifically, she wants to know three things:

(1) What defenses you think each of these potential defendants could raise (based
on the curriculum and kind of defenses we studied in the Spring and using the
MPC and/or any other cases we studied during the quarter);

(2) How will the prosecution respond to those defenses (using the MPC and/or
any other cases we studied during the quarter); and

(3) Whether you think the defense or the prosecution would have the better of the
argument and why.

Please write a memo responding to these three questions. Please be specific about
the defense(s) and the response(s) and discuss the relevant facts. Please structure your
memo so that you discuss your answers to these three questions defendant by defendant
(i.e. Mr. Santiago would have this/these defense(s), the prosecution would respond in this
way, and x has the better of the argument for reason(s) y, z, etc.; next, Mr. Estrada....)

Harcourt Question 2

Each time we addressed issues of subjective versus objective standards in class,
and especially in the context of self-defense, I argued that the distinctions along the
subjective-objective spectrum really boil down to deciding which facts to allow the
decision-maker to consider when reaching judgment. In an essay, please set me straight.
Please address the following set of questions:

(1) Overall, is my argument correct and useful, or a misleading way to think
about the subjective-objective spectrum of standards?

(2) If it was misleading, what would be a better way of approaching the issue?
Do you have a better way of thinking about the spectrum? Alternatively, if
you think it was correct and useful, why is it successful and what does it shed
light on?

(3) Do any of the theoretical readings that we read during the quarter shed any
light on this question? Do you think that any of the articles we read help in
addressing this question, suggest that the argument is correct or misleading, or
otherwise help you to think about this particular matter?
