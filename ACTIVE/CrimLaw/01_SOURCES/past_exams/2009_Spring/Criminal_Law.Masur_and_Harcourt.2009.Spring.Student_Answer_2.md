Let’s go body by body.

First there’s WB. Avon is pretty clearly guilty of felony murder of WB. They
were in the middle of a drug transaction that is a felony under IL law, and he shot WB,
causing his death. Normally this would probably be manslaughter for recklessness (as he
knew there was a risk that the bullet would hit WB, but consciously disregarded it) or
possibly murder under recklessness plus (depraved indifference) but because of the
felony it’s certainly felony murder under the MPC and the IL “proximate cause” style
felony murder. Likewise, under the proximate cause style felony murder, we could
arguably charge S and V with felony murder, as they were involved in the drug felony
and S was armed during the transaction, which is also a felony. They potentially have a
defense under the IL code that the killing was not in furtherance of the felony, as it’s not
clear how killing an annoying sidekick facilitates the selling of the drugs and it wasn’t
totally foreseeable that A would kill WB in response (as in Heinlein). Still, one could
argue that where WB was making it hard to hear the deal, the killing was in furtherance;
moreover, it’s not unreasonably foreseeable that someone would be killed in the course of
a large drug deal, so I think they may be on the hook. Stringer could argue that there was
a mistake of fact involved in his carrying the handgun, but that doesn’t seem to have any
legs; he was involved in the transaction and so was committing a felony anyway. In any
case, under the proximate cause theory, one could argue that it was foreseeable and that
the death would not have happened if they had not engaged in the drug deal, and so

they’re probably in for felony murder.

Next there’s the killing of S by A. This is a tough case. On the one hand, A
clearly thought about whether or not to kill S for several hours, more than enough time to
ask “Shall I kill him? Yes I shall.” This seems to suffice for premeditation under the IL
code; particularly where many courts hold that “no time is too short,” (Carroll) several
hours seems like enough. This would lead to aggravated murder. But, he was clearly
acting under a provocation. Under the MPC, it would be easy to argue that he was acting
under the influence of an extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable
excuse—he just found out that S had his nephew killed. From A’s point of view, as the
MPC requires, this seems like a reasonable explanation for his action. The MPC doesn’t
seem to import the cooling time used at common law, so the fact that several hours
elapsed isn’t clearly an issue. As long as he was acting under extreme emotional distress
that was reasonable from his standpoint (which I think it was) then I think we can get him
on manslaughter under the MPC, mitigated from murder.

Next there’s the bizarre Omar episode. I would think that we could charge him
(though dead, apparently) with attempted murder, though the case is thin. I would think
generally that we probably could not get attempted felony murder, despite the fact that he
was committing a felony, as I believe only Arkansas has attempted felony murder. Under
the MPC, O only had to commit a purposeful act that he intended to cause or believed
would cause the result, taking substantial step toward committing the crime. The obvious
problem is that, while O pointed the gun at them, he didn’t fire, and couldn’t have
believed that he was going to kill them; where he withdrew, we couldn’t claim that
intended to cause a death. So, the attempted murder charge probably wouldn’t stick.

Attempted armed robbery, however, probably would stick under the MPC rules; he

Masur/Harcourt 2009

clearly took a substantial step toward completing the crime and abandoned it at the last
moment, probably due to the fact that the commission was going to be more dangerous to
him as opposed to any moral qualm, which would vitiate any defense under 5.01(4). He
could maybe argue that he abandoned the robbing of N because of the thing about paying
for college, which would be the kind of moral abandonment that the law is looking for to
exculpate, but I don’t think in this situation you can separate reasons for the two
individuals as it’s all part of one situation where he clearly abandoned beucase M was
going to kill him.

Then there’s O’s death. This is much like the Stephenson and Kern situations
where the victim was left with a terrible choice and the question is proximate cause. I
would think that we would be able to charge C and S with murder here, as they clearly
had the mens rea to kill O intentionally as they were lying in wait for him and
immediately began firing at him when he came through the door. I think they proximately
caused his death in the same was as in Kern—his choice was to die by their hands or to
take a leap into traffic; they robbed him of the choice and so proximately caused his
death. (It was certainly foreseeable, too, that O would die in the situation—that’s what
they were going for.) We could possibly get aggravated murder as well since this was
clearly a planned trap and thus qualifies as premeditated.

Even with the intervening acts of M and P, I think that the murder charge sticks
on C and S, though it certainly complicates things. I think it’s reasonably foreseeable that
he would try to escape through the window and could potentially land in the street. This
reminds me of the Kibbe case; while the exact mode of his death might not have been

foreseen, it seems to be a sufficiently direct cause. I think we could also charge P with


Exam #2 Spring 2009
Masur/Harcourt 2009
4 of 16

O’s death and maybe M as well. P we could charge with negligent homicide, though it’s
not clear that this negligence is gross negligence. It doesn’t seem entirely unreasonable to
expect someone to move over onto the correct side of the road; still, perhaps it’s
unreasonable to not take some precaution sooner than when the other car is fifty feet from
your bumper traveling at a high rate of speed. At that point, it might cross into gross
negligence, but I think this is a close case and could come out either way. With McNulty,
we can probably get manslaughter under reckless or maybe recklessness plus (though that
seems like a stretch) as we can assume recklessness under the MPC when we’re talking
about voluntary intoxication. It’s reasonably foreseeable that reckless drunk driving could
cause another car to swerve and kill someone, and so I think we’re sufficient on
proximate cause. Likewise, we could get M on P’s death for manslaughter for
recklessness or possibly again murder with recklessness plus, where M was so drunk that
he didn’t even realize that he had just caused the deaths of two people. (That seems to
evince depraved indifference.) He could try to argue that P losing control of his car was
somehow an intervening cause, but it seems reasonable to lose control after the shock of
hitting someone and killing them, and either way, contributory negligence is never a
defense in criminal law.

Finally, we have Bodie’s brilliant plan and W’s resulting death. Here I would
think that we can get B and P on felony murder, as they were technically involved in an
armed robbery against W at the time he was killed. Normally I would say that B’s plan
would be manslaughter under recklessness or murder under recklessness plus extreme
indifference, but where he genuinely believed that there were no live bullets in the gun

I’m not sure we could get extreme indifference to stick. I think plain recklessness would

Masur/Harcourt 2009

stick, as pointing a gun at someone and pulling the trigger, regardless of whether you
believe it to be loaded, carries the risk that there’s a shell lodged inside or something that
could fire. The problem here might be the individualization of recklessness under the
MPC—perhaps the risk was “justifiable” from B’s point of view as he didn’t want W to
go to the police. Still, I think that would fall on unsympathetic ears in court. Either way,
thanks to the felony of “armed” robbery (having a gun seems to be enough—I’m not sure
it matters that it’s loaded since the threat of using it alone will do), the killing could be
felony murder. B could argue a mistake of fact in that he genuinely thought that he had
emptied the gun of live rounds and that seems to vitiate any mens rea of intentionality,
knowing, or recklessness, as he didn’t think there was any danger of W being killed.
While the MPC doesn’t seem to require that the mistake be reasonable, I would think that
a court would find this mistake unreasonable as a matter of policy—this isn’t someone
who should walk due to a mistake. Likewise, the fact that it took W ten hours to die
doesn’t seem to affect B’s culpability, as he died from his wounds inflicted by B.

P also has some culpability in W’s death. For one, he was part of the armed
robbery, so felony murder seems to apply to him as well. He could argue that this killing
wasn’t in furtherance and wasn’t reasonably foreseeable, and he would seem to have a
pretty good case (again, I’m thinking of Heinlein). Judging by P’s reaction, it seems that
the murder was clearly not in his contemplation, though it seems reasonably foreseeable
that someone might die under the kind of situation they cooked up, and so I think we
could still have a case under the proximate cause theory. Also I don’t think it matters that
the killing happened “after” the felony, as we saw several cases like Gillis where the

killing was still considered a part of it. Even if we can’t get P on felony murder, I think


Exam #2 Spring 2009
Masur/Harcourt 2009
6 of 16
we could get him on manslaughter by recklessness, as he arguably had a duty to seek help
for W, as (1) he assisted in creating the peril that W suffered from and (2) he was
secluded from any other help. Ten hours to bleed to death is a long time. There’s clearly
the conscious disregard of the risk that Wallace would die from his wounds, and it seems
to be a gross deviation from what a law abiding person would do. Still, P might have
though (reasonably) that W was already dead, so he could get a mistake of fact defense
potentially, except that for the mistake to be reasonable, I would think he would have had
to at least check on W’s vitals before high-tailing it for Canada or Mexico to avoid being
arrested.
Finally there’s P’s killing of B. Here again, what would normally be intentional
murder I think is mitigated to manslaughter under the MPC, as P was clearly very
emotionally disturbed by what happened (and reasonably so, from his point of view) and

acting on the emotional disturbance. (We know he was extremely emotionally disturbed

because his dialogue ends in “!?!””). That seems like a pretty clear case.

I think the mitigation to manslaughter can be defended well on either the
utilitarian or the retributivist basis. I'l] begin with retributivism.

Retributivists, as we saw, are most concerned with just deserts—the criminal
deserves punishment for his wrong and should get it proportionally (Moore). As Hart
noted, the strict retributivists don’t seem to case much about any of the utilitarian
justifications—they’re a sort of zealous bunch that is only interested in moral payback
(though the modern retributivists are more moderate in this respect). In a mitigation
circumstance, the blameworthiness of the actor seems to decrease in proportion to the
blameworthiness of the victim; it seems rational under the retributivist model to decrease
the punishment accordingly, as culpability is lessened. The victim shares some of the
culpability for his own death and thus lessens the share of culpability of the killer; the
killer is himself wronged in the transaction if he’s laboring under some reasonable
emotional disturbance caused by the victim such that we mitigate, and so it seems
morally correct that his punishment should be lesser under the retributivist mode. One
could argue from the retributive perspective that we should take the act in isolation—he
caused a death and so should pay accordingly—but I think that contradicts the
fundamental proportional aspect of the retributivist thinking. The problem with this
argument is that our cases from class didn’t present too many sympathetic characters.
Maher, given the mores of his time and the public nature of his act, could be considered
less culpable under a retributivist theory where his wife did something (or appeared to do
something) which, at that time, was outrageous. Thus wronged and provoked, he did an

act he might not have normally done—this seems to call for a lesser punishment.

From the utilitarian perspective, the mitigation also seems to make sense.
Utilitarians want to deter and incapacitate and possibly reform criminals—none of these
purposes are served by punishing as murderers the kind of killers for whom we mitigate.
For one, it isn’t clear that deterrence is even a relevant consideration when we’re talking
about someone acting under an extreme emotional disturbance—they aren’t thinking
about what punishment they’ll get and how severe, they’re acting in a rage or a deep
sorrow. (Robinson and Darley might argue that no one is really deterred by threat of
punishment where one of their three factors in reality is often missing.) Locking them
away longer or putting them to death only costs the state more money without increasing
the deterrent effect probably an iota. Girouard is a perfect example of this—he grabbed a
knife in a rage and killed his wife after being taunted and learning that she may have been
unfaithful. It’s not clear that his knowing that he’d be punished for murder would have
deterred that impulsive act.

Then there’s the incapacitation issue. We incapacitate to protect society from
dangerous people, as Zimring and Hawkins stress—it’s what our system, our jails, are
designed to do primarily, and all else is ancillary. The oft-cited baby eating example in
class begs the question—is the mother who kills someone who eats her baby really a
danger to society such that we need her to be incapacitated as a murderer for life or
possibly executed? The clear answer appears to be no. People that kill under reasonable
emotional distress seem generally not to be the type of career, dangerous criminal that we
want to incapacitate, but rather are otherwise innocent people whose actions escape them

in a moment of passion. Just as there’s no benefit to trying to deter this with high


Exam #2 Spring 2009
Masur/Harcourt 2009
9 of 16
penalties, it doesn’t seem that there’s any benefit to incapacitating people put in
extraordinarily stressful and emotional situations who then act out violently.

Finally, there’s the reformist streak of the utilitarians (criticized by Moore). We
want to reeducate criminals and release them back into society as productive members.
Here again, it’s not clear that this justification for increased punishment applies in the
mitigation setting—it’s a waste of resources. Someone who acts under the influence of an
extreme emotional disturbance that is required to be reasonable in their circumstances
isn’t really someone who needs to be re-educated (unless of course it’s part of a larger
pattern of behavior). They are not some malformed citizen that needs reforming but a
typical human being in an extreme situation that causes them (reasonably) to lose control
and do something violent. What can we teach such people in prison? Not to get angry
when someone eats your baby? Not to kill the driver who just killed your daughter, as in
the Scriva case? We’d have to teach them not to be human, susceptible, fallible,
emotional. This seems impossible, and thus not a good justification for imprisoning some
such killer for a longer period of time. Rather it would be a waste of society’s resources,

which a utilitarian cannot stomach.

We’ll begin with S’s charge for the death of Edwards. It seems like S has a
reasonable case for self defense, though it’s complicated by E’s status as a police officer.
The MPC only requires that the party believe that deadly force is necessary to protect
himself against death or serious bodily harm; the standard is totally subjective. In this
situation, it doesn’t seem like it would be difficult to show that S believed that he needed
to shoot E to save his own life, where E was pointing a pistol at him. Though not
required, this understanding of the situation doesn’t seem unreasonable. For one, it’s not
clear that E ever identified himself as a police officer; Santiago had no reason to think
that E was trying to arrest him as he was not in uniform.

The prosecution will likely respond that, under the MPC, self defense cannot be
asserted against an officer justified in using the threat of deadly force to make an arrest.
The question, of course, then becomes whether E was justified in using deadly force in
making an arrest, or if he was even trying to make an arrest when he pulls out the
throwaway. For one, to begin with, while I believe stealing a car is a felony, there was
clearly no force involved on the part of S—he was merely looking in the window—and it
doesn’t seem like S would cause serious harm if his arrest is delayed, the two possibilities
under the MPC. So, the use of deadly force to subdue him doesn’t seem proper in the first
place. Moreover, as previously mentioned, he never identified himself as a police officer
as required by the MPC and announced an intention to arrest, unless that’s implied by the
facts in a way that I didn’t catch. That would seem to indicate that he either didn’t intend
to arrest S, but rather intended to scare him and maybe beat him up, or that he failed to

inform S as required. Either way, here the self defense claim seems to be pretty strong.

Next there’s Estrada’s attempted homicide of S. This seems like a situation where
he was using force for the protection of another, and again, under the MPC the standard is
merely belief, subjective. Estrada fired when he saw S shoot Edwards and then turns
toward Ortega. In that situation, it seems reasonable to believe that Estrada believed he
needed to use deadly force (a gun) to prevent the use of deadly force against another, here
either Edwards or Ortega. I’m not sure what the prosecution would argue in response to
that; if I were them I would consider some kind of plea bargain, because given the fact
that S had already shot and killed Edwards, it doesn’t seem like an unreasonable thing in
the situation for Estrada to try and use deadly force to stop S. It just doesn’t seem to be
worth the resources and from a moral perspective, it’s not clear that the guy is culpable in
a way that deserves punishment.

As for his wounding of Bordegno, I think the best defense here is again that E was
justified in using force in defense of himself or others, and he accidentally harmed a
bystander. If the homicide charge is based on recklessness or negligence in the firing then
the defense is not available if it was found that he was reckless or negligent in his use of
self defense, but I don’t think that’s the case here. He probably had never fired a gun
before and thought it was necessary for the protection of himself and others, and
accidentally hit another person. I think the prosecution would have a very weak case here
where it seems that Estrada was justified in using force in self defense. The same line of
reasoning seems to apply for the assault charge against Sandra Harding—if he was

justified in using force and did not do so recklessly, I think his self defense claim would

be reasonable.

Estrada could also raise a necessity defense, choice of evils under the MPC,
arguing that he had to fire the gun at S to prevent the harm to O; the only difficulty with
that is that the evil sought to be avoided isn’t much worse than the harm for which he’s
tried, and so the case could be difficult; murder and attempted murder or attempted
murder and attempted murder seem to be rough equivalents. Moreover, the same issue of
whether or not he was negligent in bringing about the conduct could come back to haunt
him again in this scenario if they’re getting him on recklessness or negligence in any of
these cases.

Anzelino and Musante raise interesting questions. Under the MPC, they had to
have acted with the kind of culpability required by the crime, which is probably
intentional murder, when they acted purposefully to help officer Dunton. It isn’t clear, for
one, what they did that was aiding Dunton other than being with him at the time and
perhaps having a legal duty to prevent him from firing. That seems like it would have
been impossible, however, given the split-second nature of Dunton’s decision to fire and
given the situation with an unknown man pointing a gun at the car—it seems reasonable
to fire (though we’ ll get to that). Moreover, they had to act with the intent for the killing
itself, and it isn’t clear that they had any intent with regard to the killing; Dunton fired on
reflex. They didn’t even have time to form any intent regarding the killing. I would say
that accomplice liability here would be pretty hard to get—it would be a stretch to hold
them accountable for their involvement. The prosecution could argue that they had a duty
to identify themselves as police officers before resorting to force and perhaps had a duty
to ensure that Dunton did the same, but that argument seems like a pretty small hook on

which to hang a pretty big hat. I think the defense here would prevail.


Exam #2 Spring 2009
Masur/Harcourt 2009

Finally, there’s Dunton himself. Dunton could argue self defense or that he was
using reasonable force to arrest a fleeing felon. The latter doesn’t seem to work. For one,
he did not seem to identify himself as a police officer and announce intent to arrest as
required by the MPC, so unless he can prove that the defense goes right out the window.
Other than that detail, however, he seems to have a pretty good case for using force to
stop a felon; he sees someone chasing someone else with a gun; he may have believed
this person was committing a felony (armed robbery, etc) and where the gun was drawn
the individual was clearly threatening force and was a danger. The prosecution could
argue that the MPC also requires that the actor believes that there’s no substantial risk of
injury to an innocent person, which there was here. As a subjective standard, we’d have
to have more facts to see how that would come out.

On self defense, the officer seems to be on much more solid ground. He
subjectively believed that he needed to use deadly force to stop Edwards from shooting
into the car. If the standard were an objective one, perhaps a good argument could be
made that his understanding of the situation was unreasonable, and that unless Edwards
did more than turn with the gun, the firing could be unreasonable, particularly where it
was four shots. He could have fired a warning shot, or whatever. Moreover, he could
have also escaped without using deadly force by throwing the car in reverse and getting
the heck out of there. Yet, for all that, the MPC standard appears to be pretty subjective,

and with the gun pointed in his face, I bet he believed that it was immediately necessary

to fire at Edwards to protect himself, and that might be enough.

I think the argument is pretty sound. Essentially what we seem to be getting down
to when we look at these standards is the extent to which one’s individual experiences
and background and subjective beliefs can enter into the equation, and all of these are
essentially fact questions—which facts can we use? The more objective the standard, the
less willing we are to consider the facts of one’s prior experiences, or of one’s mental
illnesses or peculiarities, or even larger relevant circumstances (IE how we’re framing the
event, in the Kelman sense). The more subjective the standard, the more we’re willing to
consider whether one had been mugged before, as in the Goetz case, or whether one’s
mistaken impression in a situation can still be dispositive of guilt rather than imposing the
standard of that odious character, the reasonable man.

Still, I think there is a bit more to the issue of the spectrum than merely what facts
we’re willing to consider (though it seems fair to say that that is what it boils down to).
That might be a symptom of a larger disease, or at least indicative of a larger discussion,
which would be the extent to which we’re willing to individualize our standards, which
can place additional burdens on the courts in terms of adjudication, and which could also
potentially lead to inconsistent outcomes in similar cases. The objective reasonableness
standard has the advantage of being sort of a leveling, however blunt, instrument—
everyone is held up to the same standard regardless of whether they’re even capable of
meeting it. I think the bluntness of this comes at the expense of equity in individual cases
and that’s why you see examples like the Goetz court allowing information about his
circumstances to come into play. But I think the idea is that these choices are reflections

of larger political and economic considerations of how we want to hold people

accountable and what resources we’re willing to expend in exchange for justice—there’s
a larger philosophical debate in play that animates these choices. This was illustrated
quite well by the Kahan and Braman article. One’s political leanings seem to affect how
you believe these choices should be made and whether you think there’s any choice at all.
It’s about where our society is coming from in terms of how we measure one’s
culpability—is it about what the individual did in context and whether that’s
blameworthy given the context, or is it about a very narrow frame of the individual’s act
and whether or not it was reasonable in the Platonic, shadows on the cave wall sense of
reasonable, IE, that there is some true and external standard against which we should
measure ourselves? What we choose to allow the factfinder to consider is merely
evidence of our philosophy in that regard.

One theoretical reading that I thought was particularly interesting and relevant to
this question was the Kelman article, mentioned earlier. What the spectrum and these
choices are really about is how narrow a frame we’re willing to put, or with a completely
objective standard, whether we’re willing to place a frame at all or rather look at some
abstract, external standard (the reasonable man). This is particularly relevant in the self-
defense context, as Kelman discussed in terms of time-framing. If we focus only the
criminal act, or specifically here on the act of self defense, and whether it’s reasonable,
we choose to ignore environmental factors or historical factors with regard to the
individual that may have some bearing on their culpability in the situation. If we do the
former, trials might be less complicated and cheaper, but equity is lacking; if we do the
latter, it comes at a cost to our already overloaded courts, but may better represent the

culpability of the individual. Kelman also discusses this in the fourth interpretive

Masur/Harcourt 2009

construct, which is the broad versus narrow view of the defendant, IE, the defendant as an
individual or as a generic citizen. Kelman seems to argue that we use these different
constructs in order to avoid tough political questions when it’s convenient or just as tools
to make whatever rhetorical argument we wish to make, tying in to the indeterminacy
theme.

So while I think the argument is accurate and useful—in the sense that it helps on
to conceptualize what evidence they should be using or stressing with regard to their
client depending on the wording of the statute or decision law—I think it’s important to
remember the underlying argument about why we make these choices and which should
be made with regard to the facts that reach the fact finder. Ultimately these choices in our
standards reflect policy choices, which themselves reflect larger underlying theories of
punishment and culpability. It’s interesting to think of how the question of the spectrum
seems to bridge the distance between a very practical question of what we can consider

and the very theoretical question of what we should consider and how it changes one’s

responsibilities to society or what those responsibilities should be.
