I do think that the law enforcement use-of-force statute needs to be revised, but only in
minor ways. The larger reforms will have to do with the legal system's understanding of what the
penal code requires.

As a first matter, there is much to be said in favor of the statute. It establishes an
objective reasonableness standard, provides for proportionality ("When and to the extent"), limits
the use of deadly force to certain enumerated categories where it is especially useful, and
abrogates the justified use of force in the case of recklessness. In the Gurley case, the statute
more or less played out as desired: it was quickly obvious that Officer Liang's conduct was at
least negligent and likely reckless, and the grand jury indicted him under Paragraph 2 as was
proper.

The Gurley case notwithstanding, we have repeatedly seen that the law "on the books"
does not always (or even often) match how things play out either on the street, in the grand jury
room, or at trial. There are, then, several ways in which the statute itself can be marginally
improved.

First, the statute could consider prohibiting the use of force (deadly or not) for arrests of
misdemeanors. As it stands now, the statute allows for the use of nondeadly force to affect any
"arrest" or in preventing any "escape from custody." This is too soft a line, and as we have seen
is ripe for abuse. In the Garner case, Officer Pantaleo was preparing to arrest Garner for selling
loose cigarettes, which is almost certainly only a misdemeanor. As the video showed, the two
were arguing about the situation, and Pantaleo interpreted that as justifying the use of force. A
statute that flatly prohibits the use of force for misdemeanors could have avoided this situation.

On the other hand, this reform could problematically incentivize attempts at escape by
people who know they are being arrested for a misdemeanor. Moreover, it could promote
strategic behavior by police officers, by allowing them to after-the-fact rationalize their use of
force by charging arrestees with a felony when they would have otherwise only been charged
with a misdemeanor. (Indeed, we saw lying in reports in the Slager case.)

To combat the negative effects of the above reform, the statute should, second, more
clearly define what "force" and "necessity" mean. Returning to the Garner case and the dispute
over whether Pantaleo used a "chokehold" or some other maneuver, there is an enduring question
over whether Pantaleo was using "force," "deadly force," and when, if ever, either became
"necessary." A revised statute should provide for precise definitions--if necessary, overruling
what is currently permitted by the NYPD--for what is allowed. It would be a legislative question
as to whether tasers (as_ initially used in the Slager case in SC), chokeholds, batons, or other
means would constitute "force" or "deadly force." The statute would clearly have to peg these
various methods to the statutory requirement of proportionality.

One immediate problem with such a requirement is that it assumes the statute's issues can
be fixed with bright line-drawing. After all, as technology develops, policing techniques change,
and society's expectations change, the statute will quickly become regressive and just as
problematic as before. There is something to be said, then, in using a softer, standards-based
approach to the "force" and "necessity" questions. Further, it is clear that the job police officers


do, especially in large cities, is inherently dangerous. Raising the bar of "necessity" will have the
effect of increasing danger to officers. Officers must be given some discretion in their jobs.

Third, even at the risk of bright line-drawing, the statute should more clearly define what
is meant by "reasonably believes," and should specifically explain what is expected of a
"reasonable police officer" (this term does not appear in the statute, but should be included). On
some abstract level, society relies on the ideal of a reasonable police officer in order to function
at all: there has to be faith in the system for people to buy in. To paraphrase Morris, people are
less likely to abide by the restrictive "burdens" that society places upon them if they lose
confidence that police officers will work to ensure the "benefits" they get in return are protected
and maximized. In other words, as we lose faith in police officers, free-riderism (crime) goes up
and, along with it, civil unrest. Indeed, we have seen over the past year's protests that many
people have already done away with the idea of a "reasonable police officer." People recognize
that officers are human, with biases and prejudices that are only augmented by their legally
privileged use of force. As such, a revised statute could consider expressly stating how juries are
to be instructed on the "reasonableness" question. While I am not quite sure of the proper
language, the statute could make it clear that officers, though they hold a special position in
society, are supposed to be held only to the standard as provided by the legislature; not to any
unconsciously higher standard. In other words, such a reform could recalibrate the implicit
thumb on the scale in favor of police action.

Fourth and more radically, the statute could consider cabining prosecutorial discretion in
the case of police violence. It could explicitly include a section that allows the grand jury to
indict for "substantial possibility" of a crime, and then expressly explain that such a line is less
than the normal "probable cause" requirement. As we have seen, prosecutors are deeply hesitant
to indict officers, in part because they are "on the same team," interact with each other
constantly, and rely on each other to make progress on non-police-violence cases. Prosecutors
don't want to risk their relationship with their relevant police departments. This lower bar, then,
would effectively bind the prosecutor's hands, allowing prosecutors to tell angry officers to
"blame the legislature."

Alternatively, and relatedly, the statute could consider something like requiring an
out-of-district prosecutor to handle police violence cases. This could help mitigate the
problematic prosecutor-officer dynamics noted above. In other words: the statute could provide
that each district shall make a bilateral agreement with another in-state district to swap
prosecutors to handle police violence crimes. Indeed, this would seem to be the natural step: we
have seen, in the Garner and Brown cases, what happens when prosecutors refuse to pursue truth
in order to preserve their power. At risk of mis-paraphrasing Foucault, suffice it to say that by
separating prosecutorial conflicts of interest, we can improve legitimacy through truth-telling.

In sum, most changes to the penal code itself will have both positive and negative effects.
As specificity increases, flexibility will decrease, and the inevitable borderline cases will
continue to crop up. Moreover, it is obvious that whatever the text itself provides, lawyers on
both sides can manipulate the language to suit their clients' interests. As we saw in the
Zimmerman case, for example, the defense was able to construe the language narrowly, to focus
the jury on a specific moment in time.

As such, if there is to be real reform in police conduct (and in police-citizen relations), it


will have to come outside the text itself. Proposals such as mandatory body cameras are a start:
the more we can "watch the watchers," the less scope there is for blatant misconduct. They
increase the chance of punishment, and thus increase the "price" of misconduct. Yet even
cameras have their limits. First, they cannot capture certain things, such as when exactly an
officer subjectively felt his life was in danger. Second, there is a blossoming debate over who
seems the camera footage, and when. If officers can view the footage before writing their reports,
does that undermine the whole point of cameras? And if officers can't view the footage, given the
frailties of the human mind in fast-moving and high-pressure situations, will we be condemning
officers whose write-ups do not match the footage?

Additionally, perhaps counterintuitive proposals such as increasing the number of
officers are also welcome. Such a proposal could allow for more officers to return to traditional
"beat" policing, in which officers create more personal relationships with the neighborhoods they
police. This could be a modest start toward repairing the gulf between officers and citizens
(especially the poor, black, and marginalized citizens who are at disproportionate risk of arrest).
