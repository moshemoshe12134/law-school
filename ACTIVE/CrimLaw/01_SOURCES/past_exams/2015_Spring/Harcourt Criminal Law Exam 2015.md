Question 1

You are called to the office. On your desk, you find this report from investigators:

On the night of July 11,2012, Vincent Zanfardino was driving his wife, Samantha
Peters, and a co-worker, Richard Tanguay, back from a wake in Queens in his and
his wife’s Lincoln town car on the New England Thruway.

Ms. Peters had started driving and always drives, but she was upset from the wake
and still crying. She had drunk at the wake and was feeling light headed as well.
So she pulled over at a rest stop and asked someone else to drive. Mr. Tanguay
said he would be willing to drive, but that his driver’s license had been revoked
because of a prior DUI. Ms. Peters asked him to drive anyway, but he refused.
Mr. Zanfardino hesitantly agreed to drive. He went into the rest stop to get some
water and took some oral diabetic medication, and then drove the car.

Ms. Peters was sitting in the passenger seat, Mr. Tanguay in the rear. According
to the immediate statement made by Mr. Tanguay at the scene of the accident, Mr.
Zanfardino became unresponsive at the wheel twenty minutes later and started
speeding the car up to 93 miles per hour. Mr. Tanguay tried to reach for the
wheel, Ms. Peters reached for the brake pedal, but not in time.

Ahead of them, Alfred Reitano was driving a black Acura that belonged to Brynn
Rohlf, who was in the passenger seat. They were returning from a trip to buy
heroin. Mr. Zanfardino’s Lincoln town car crashed into their Accura. “The rear of
Brynn Rohlf’s car was crushed like an accordion,” a police officer at the scene
said. Mr. Tanguay, who had been reaching forward, went through the front
windshield and slammed into Ms. Rohlf’s car.

Mr. Reitano and Mr. Tanguay were both immediately transported to Jacobi
Medical Center. Mr Reitano died the next day from head injuries. Mr. Tanguay’s
spinal cord was severely injured and he will probably not be able to walk again.
The other passengers were also injured, including Mr. Zanfardino, but not
critically.

Mr. Reitano’s mother, Patricia Reitano, said that her son, who went by Freddy,
was a recovering drug addict who was sober at the time of the accident. She said
that he had been laid off from his job as a warehouse manager in Port Chester,
N.Y., and was living with her in New Rochelle, N.Y., to save money to support

his fiancée and a young daughter. “My world as I know it is over,” Ms. Reitano
said. “Freddy was my firstborn son and he was the light of my life. Life will never
be the same without him.”

In terms of his background, Mr. Zanfardino, 53, is a systems specialist at Con
Edison. He suffers from diabetes. Early indications suggest he may have had a
hypoglycemic seizure while driving.

Mr. Zanfardino, who has had diabetes since his 20s, takes insulin medication
regularly, but had experienced hypoglycemic seizures in recent years. A doctor’s
report from June 2012 indicates that Mr. Zanfardino had suffered three seizures in
the previous year, and that the doctor had advised him against driving.

A hypoglycemic seizure may be triggered by injecting too much insulin, or failing
to eat soon enough after using a fast acting insulin; excessive use of alcohol,
skipping meals, or exercising vigorously without adjusting insulin dosages or
eating properly. A seizure may also be triggered by oral diabetes medications that
cause the pancreas to produce more insulin.

The doctor’s report indicated that Mr. Zanfardino had told his doctor that he did
not drive, and instead left the driving to his wife. Mr. Zanfardino also failed to
acknowledge that he had any seizures when he applied to renew his driver’s
license 13 months earlier.

Mr. Zanfardino’s family has stated that while the fatal crash was a tragedy, it was
a civil rather than a criminal matter. “It’s not Vincent Zanfardino’s fault he has
diabetes, and it’s not his fault the state of New York allows people with diabetes
to drive,” the family said.

Diabetes is a serious disease and if blood glucose levels are not regularly
monitored and controlled, multiple complications may occur. A hypoglycemic
seizure is one of these complications. It is triggered by dangerously low blood
sugar levels. This condition may lead to a diabetic seizure. Diabetes affects more
than 24 million people in the United States.

Tom Hopkins, president and chief executive officer for Diabetes Association of
Long Island, a nonprofit organization that provides services to people with
diabetes and other disabilities, said in a telephone interview on Thursday that
while he was not familiar with Mr. Zanfardino’s case, people in his situation are
often faced with the challenge of having to get to work, or shop, or get around in

areas with limited public transportation. “I think that any individual’s right to
drive should be balanced with the need to maintain public safety,” he said.

Mr. Hopkins said that laws covering drivers with seizure disorders vary from state
to state, and typically impose a range of restrictions, like requiring drivers to be
seizure-free for a certain time period before driving — usually from three months
to one year — or requiring a doctor to report a patient with seizures to state motor
vehicle officials. In New York, people with seizure disorders must generally be
seizure-free for the previous 3 months, though exceptions can be made, he said.

Your boss is going to ask you to litigate this case. She tells you that she’ll

supervise, but you are in charge. She suggests that you write a memo for her covering the
following topics:

1.

2.

3.

What charges would you file against which individuals?
What defenses or issues would you raise on behalf of the individuals charged?

Who would likely have the better of the argument, the prosecution or the defense?

This memo will be important for your thinking about the case. Please do not just

write a laundry list of charges or defenses, but develop the issues that are most likely
going to be contested. I would recommend that you identify and discuss in order the most
important charges and associated defenses—focus on what matters.

This case happened and you are located in New York State, but the criminal law

that applies is the Model Penal Code for everything except the homicide provision. The
homicide provision has been amended and is attached as an Appendix. Apart from this
one section on homicide, everything other criminal law issue is governed by the Model
Penal Code. The homicide provision is included in the Appendix to this examination.

Question 2

On December 3, 2014, a Staten Island grand jury decided not to indict NYPD
police officer Daniel Pantaleo for the homicide of Eric Garner.

On February 10, 2015, a Brooklyn grand jury decided to indict NYPD police
officer Peter Liang for the homicide of Akai Gurley.

The New York Penal Code related to law enforcement use of lethal force provides
as follows:

1. A police officer or a peace officer, in the course of effecting or attempting to
effect an arrest, or of preventing or attempting to prevent the escape from custody,
of a person whom he or she reasonably believes to have committed an offense,
may use physical force when and to the extent he or she reasonably believes such
to be necessary to effect the arrest, or to prevent the escape from custody, or in
self-defense or to defend a third person from what he or she reasonably believes
to be the use or imminent use of physical force; except that deadly physical force
may be used for such purposes only when he or she reasonably believes that: (a)
The offense committed by such person was: (i) a felony or an attempt to commit a
felony involving the use or attempted use or threatened imminent use of physical
force against a person; or (ii) kidnapping, arson, escape in the first degree,
burglary in the first degree or any attempt to commit such a crime; or (b) The
offense committed or attempted by such person was a felony and that, in the
course of resisting arrest therefor or attempting to escape from custody, such
person is armed with a firearm or deadly weapon; or (c) Regardless of the
particular offense which is the subject of the arrest or attempted escape, the use of
deadly physical force is necessary to defend the police officer or peace officer or
another person from what the officer reasonably believes to be the use or
imminent use of deadly physical force.

2. The fact that a police officer or a peace officer is justified in using deadly
physical force under circumstances prescribed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of
subdivision one does not constitute justification for reckless conduct by such
police officer or peace officer amounting to an offense against or with respect to
innocent persons whom he or she is not seeking to arrest or retain in custody.

Do you think that the law of the State of New York regarding law enforcement
use of force or deadly force needs to be revised? If not, please explain why, making sure
to discuss the two cases mentioned. If so, please explain why in relation to the two cases
and please suggest reform(s) to the language of the penal code. Please feel free to weave
into your answer any of our theoretical readings if you find them relevant and
convincing; but do not feel the need to artificially insert them into your argument. What
is most important is that you write a persuasive and genuine argument in response to this
important and timely question.

Appendix: Homicide Statute for Question 1

NYHS 230 Murder
A person commits the crime of murder if he or she does any of the following:

(1) With intent to cause the death of another person, he or she causes the death of that
person or of another person; a person acts intentionally with respect to a result or to
conduct when his or her conscious objective is to cause such result or to engage in such
conduct; or

(2) Under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to human life, he or she
recklessly engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of death to a person other than
himself or herself, and thereby causes the death of another person; a person acts
recklessly with respect to a result or to a circumstance when he or she is aware of and
consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such result will occur or
that such circumstance exists. The risk must be of such nature and degree that disregard
thereof constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable
person would observe in the situation. A person who creates such a risk but is unaware
thereof solely by reason of voluntary intoxication also acts recklessly with respect
thereto; or

(3) He or she commits or attempts to commit arson in the first degree, burglary in the first
or second degree, escape in the first degree, kidnapping in the first degree, rape in the
first degree, robbery in any degree, sodomy in the first degree, any other felony clearly
dangerous to human life and, in the course of and in furtherance of the crime that he or

she is committing or attempting to commit, or in immediate flight therefrom, he or she, or
another participant if there be any, causes the death of any person; or

(4) He or she knowingly engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of death to a
person other than himself or herself, and thereby causes the death of another person; a
person acts knowingly with respect to conduct or to a circumstance when he or she is
aware that his or her conduct is of such nature or that such circumstance exists.

Murder is a Class A felony

NYHS 231 Manslaughter
A person commits the crime of manslaughter if:

(1) He or she recklessly causes the death of another person; a person acts recklessly with
respect to a result or to a circumstance when he or she is aware of and consciously
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such result will occur or that such
circumstance exists. The risk must be of such nature and degree that disregard thereof
constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would
observe in the situation. A person who creates such a risk but is unaware thereof solely
by reason of voluntary intoxication also acts recklessly with respect thereto; or

(2) He or she causes the death of another person under circumstances that would
constitute murder under NYHS 230; except, that he or she causes the death due to a
sudden heat of passion caused by provocation recognized by law, and before a reasonable
time for the passion to cool and for reason to reassert itself.

Manslaughter is a Class B felony.

NYHS 232. Criminally Negligent Homicide

A person commits the crime of criminally negligent homicide if he or she causes the
death of another person by criminal negligence. A person acts with criminal negligence
with respect to a result or to a circumstance when he or she fails to perceive a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such result will occur or that such circumstance exists. The risk
must be of such nature and degree that the failure to perceive it constitutes a gross
deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the
situation.
