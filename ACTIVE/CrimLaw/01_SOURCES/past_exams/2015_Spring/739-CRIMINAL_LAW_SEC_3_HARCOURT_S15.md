Zanfardino (Z)

For the death of Reitano (R) I would charge Z with Manslaughter under NYHS 231. We can
argue that Z acted Recklessly when he decided to drive on that day, and that he was aware and
consciously disregarded the large risk of crashing while driving because knew about his history
of seizures, and that this was a gross deviation from what a reasonable person would do in his
situation. First, Z knew he was risking the lives of himself and other when he started to drive. He
and his wife tired to get Tanguay to drive and he hesitated and took his pill before driving the
car. He also knew it was reckless to drive because his doctor told him that he should not and he
told his doctor that he did not drive but that his wife always did the driving. Z had had 3 seizures
in the past year so it was not an irregular occurrence for him to have one. Plus he knew that he
would be driving for a long time, not just a quick trip to the store and back but on a highway at
high speeds. All of these facts tend to show that Z acted recklessly and knew has was
disregarding a large risk by driving. NYHS 231 also requires a reasonable person person
standard, here we can look to the fact that NY requires a 3 month waiting time of no seizures
before allowing a person to drive. It is not clear from the fact whether Z had gone three months
but we can show that he did not act reasonable when he went to renew his license 13 months ago.
These facts can be seen to show that he did not behave like a reasonable person would.

Z will likely say that he did not meet the standard recklessness. He had 3 seizures in the last year
but averaging one every four months but the likelihood of him having one on that day was not
higher than normal. He will also likely say that he tried hard not to drive on that day but he had
no choice because his wife could not and Tanguay could not drive. He can also say that he was
not it is not a "gross" deviation from the standard conduct to drive when one has seizures, even
NY state allows people who have seizures, drive if they have not had them for 3 months. He will
say that he took his pill as a precaution and after having diabetes since his 20s he knows better
than anyone what is reasonable for people with diabetes to do in that situation.

I think that the prosecution wins here. The fact that Z told his doctor that he does not drive so the
doctor would not report it, and that he did not tell the state when he got his license makes shows
that he acted reckless and with a gross deviation from a reasonable person.

I would also charge Z with Reckless endangerment for the injury to Tanguay. The reckless
factors for his mens rea are the same as above, and by driving I think the prosecution can show
he created a substantial risk of serious physical injury to other person. This seems as if it might
be per se substatinal risk when a person with known seizures is driving and causes an accident.
However, we could that by driving on a highway at high speeds for a long period of time, Z was
creating a substantial risk of serious injury forTanguay, his wife and other drivers on the road.

Z will say again that he was not reckless, because based he had a drivers license, and based on
NY state law he possibly could have driven if he had not had a seizure in the last 3 months
(unclear from the facts but it is possible). He will also say that while there may have been a risk


to him driving it does not reach the substantial risk because he had only had 3 seizure in the last
year and he took his pill before driving and knew his limits because he has had diabetes since his
20s.

Here I think once again the prosection will likely win. Driving on the highway at high speeds
with a history of seizures probably does create a substantial risk. It should also be noted that
although Z may claim that taking his pill helps his diabetes it is a known cause of seizures. Also,
he could have been drinking at the wake like his wife, and that is also know to cause seizures.

Ms. Peters

I would charge Peters (P) also with manslaughter through accomplice liability. We can reach P
through accomplice liability throught MPC 2.06 2 a iii. She being the wife of Z had a legal duty
to prevent him from driving and she did not do so. She had knowledge that Z had seizures and in
facts knew that she was counted on to be the driver at all times. We can argue that it was reckless
for her to become drink at the wake to the point that she would become light headed because she
had driven to the wake and knew that she would have to drive back home. She knew that by
allowing her husband to drive she was creating a substantial and unjustified risk. She could have
waited until she felt better then she could have driven the car home. Allowing her husband to
drive when he almost never does was unreasonable for a reasonable person standard. If she states
that she was unaware because she was voluntarily intoxicated, the statutes does not allow that
excuse.

Peters will argue that she was not unaware because she was intoxicated but because of the
emotions of the wake. She will say that she was under extreme emotional distress. She will also
say that she was not reckless by letting her husband drive he had his drives license and the
likelihood of him having another seizure was low because he had only had three in the past year.
She can also say that she tried to have Tanguay drive, and had no knowledge that he did not have
drivers license because of a DUI.

Here, I think the case in weaker for manslaughter than it is for Z. Peters has some mitigating
circumstances like possible EED, and she tried did not know that she would not be able to drive
home after the wake. I do think that the state will be able to charge her through accomplice
complicity because of the legal duty she had as his wife. In the end I think she is not found
guilty.

I would also charge her with Reckless endangerment like her husband Z. I think much of the
analysis is the same. Allowing him to drive on a highway at high speeds knowing that he had
seizures. However, like above I think the fact that she may be mitigating circumstances allows
her to not be convicted.

Rohlf
I would charge Rohlf with possession of a controlled substances, for having heroin in his car. He

could argue that it was not his and that its was Reitano's who was a recovering drug addict.
Based on the fact that the drugs were in his car I think the state would win here.


What I would not charge

I would not charge Tangauy with a crime, he did not seem to know that Z suffered from seizures,
and acted in a responsible way by not driving when he was asked. I would also not charge
Murder to Z or Peters because I think it would be hard based on the facts to prove extreme
indifference to human life or grave risk of death.
