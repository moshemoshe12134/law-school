Question 2

I believe that the New York statutes regarding the use of force by law enforcement are
completely adequate to provide justice in cases of police killings of civilians, as evidenced by the
successful indictment of Peter Liang. The non-indicment of Daniel Pantaleo is not an indictment
against the New York Penal Code, but rather an indictment against a justice system that is
weighted towards police officers and which dehumanizes black men to a degree where a grand
jury, raised in a country where institutionalized racism factors into the mental schema of all
individuals, can easily lose empathy for a black man after analyzing a tape of his death dozens of
times.

The case of Gurley is an example of the justice system working correctly, with the
statutes doing their part. Liang shot Gurley moments after first seeing him during a vertical
patrol. Gurley had not committed any crime, and Liang did not see him for long enough to
reasonably believe that he had committed any crime. The nature of vertical patrols is that drug
dealers will frequent the stairwells, and perhaps there is a high probability that any given
individual in the stairwell is actually committing a crime. But a reasonable police officer would
take a moment to check if Gurley was holding a gun or even doing anything at all before opening
fire. And in order to use deadly physical force, Liang would have to reasonably believe that
Gurley was in the process of committing a felony which threatened imminent harm against
another person, or that the deadly physical force was necessary for Liang to defend himself. To
Liang's credit, he did not try to pretend that any of this was the case, and rather relied upon a
defense that the killing was an accidental slip of the trigger.

However, section 2 of the statute makes clear that even if Liang did think that a criminal
would be on the other side of the door, that belief would not be justification for reckless conduct
with respect to innocent persons, with Gurley as an innocent person. Liang's handling of the gun,
with his finger on the trigger, is against NYPD regulations, and were he behaving according to
code, a slip of the trigger would not be possible. Liang's behavior was reckless, causing the death
of an innocent man, and he is rightfully being charged for the homicide of Akai Gurley as a
result. This is the criminal justice system working as it should.

In Pantaleo's case, the system failed despite the Code seemingly allowing for his
indictment. While Garner was arguing with the police, he did not appear in the New York Daily
News video to be threatening them with violence or approaching them. He did not have a deadly
weapon, nor did any of the police treat him as if he had one, which is justification (b) for deadly
physical force. At 1:24 in the video when Pantaleo puts his arm around Garner's neck, there was
no way a reasonable officer could believe that Garner was in the process of committing a felony
involving the attempted or threatened use of physical force (justification (a)), as Garner was
standing still and just arguing. And justification (c), a reasonable belief that Garner was about to
use deadly force, and that Pantaleo needed to reciprocate in kind to defend himself, is clearly not
in evidence. Again, Garner had no deadly weapon and showed no sign of attempting to use
deadly force with his body. There was no possible justification for deadly physical force within
the statute.

To be charitable to Pantaleo, we can say that perhaps he did not mean to use deadly force,
and that his chokehold and subsequent kneeling on Garner and pushing his head into the ground
was not at all deadly. This is an extremely charitable reading, as the chokehold is expressly
forbidden by NYPD regulations, and Pantaleo continued to choke Garner and then put pressure
on his lungs even after Garner repeatedly said that he couldn't breathe. But for the sake of


argument, let's say that this was not deadly force. Even then, Pantaleo still violated the Code.
There is no way he reasonably believed his actions were all necessary to effect the arrest or to
prevent escape. From the moment the chokehold began, Garner was not trying to escape. He was
only begging the police to let him breathe. No threats were issued. No fists were swung. He
begged. By the time Pantaleo was crushing Garner's chest and head, there was no danger that
Garner would fight back or flee, because Garner was already on the cusp of death. The law is
clear in this instance. Daniel Pantaleo should be found guilty of the homicide of Eric Garner. So
the blame for the lack of the indictment must be sought elsewhere.

It is a well known fact that racism abounds in America today. If overt racism has been
dramatically reduced since Jim Crow, institutional racism lives on. Black people get pulled over
for traffic violations at a disproportionately high rate compared to white people committing the
same offense. Black people receive higher prison sentences than white people who committed
the same crime. The Baldus Study showed us that black people are sentenced to death at a higher
rater than white people and that killing a white person is more likely to result in capital
punishment than killing a black person. These inequalities are built into the system of
prosecution, defense, and sentencing, even when the laws are color-blind.

And juries cannot be relied upon to counteract the institutional racism of the police and
courts. Prosecutors brazenly strike blacks from the juror pool under false pretenses, and this has
been allowed by the Supreme Court of the United States. And although the resulting jury might
consist only of people who don't think that they're racists, racist attitudes are nearly unavoidable
in American society. One study (and I apologize for not knowing the name) has shown that even
babies show a preference for white faces over black ones. Employers are more likely to hire
people with "white-sounding" names than "black-sounding" names. When a white man is on trial
for killing a black man, the deck is stacked in favor of the white man even if the jury genuinely
believes itself to be impartial. Black life has been devalued.

This is not helped by the manner in which the grand jury in the Garner case would have
been exposed to the video of Pantaleo violating the New York Penal Code. When watching the
video of a man begging for breath as he dies, it is almost impossible not to feel empathy for him
and disgust at the police officers involved, who so calmly watch as a man dies. But even
watching the video two or three times in class, constantly pausing and taking notes on the timing
of events, was enough to make the act less potent, to make it more medical and sterile. It became
easier to think about the actions in an almost strategic light, as if this was tape of a football game
that the coach was having us study, as opposed to a man being killed in broad daylight in our
own city. If we were already worried that black lives were being devalued, this manner of
studying the video would be the nail in the coffin. The mechanical way with which the grand
jury would have watched the video would devalue any victim's life, let alone a black victim.
Pantaleo had everything going in his favor, and Garner had no hope.

There is no problem with the law of the State of New York in this instance. I applaud the
state legislature for passing a law which treats the police fairly while still holding them
accountable when they are not justified in their use of force. But the legislature has little to no
power on the ground, and the police have all of it. Change is required if our criminal justice
system is to truly be just, and that change must be cultural. Although body cameras would be
nice in the meantime.
