Question One:

Charges Against Vincent Zarfardino:

For the following reasons, I have chosen to charge VZ with Manslaughter (NYHS 231).

One could reasonably justify a charge of Murder under Subsections 2 or 4, however the
facts of the case do not fully support those charges. To commit murder under NYHS 230(2), the
recklessness involved must manifest an "extreme indifference to human life". Under NYHS
230(4), one can commit murder by "knowingly engaging in conduct which creates a grave risk of
death. While a diabetic driving under these conditions was reckless, I do not believe that I could
prove extreme indifference to human life, or that the activity VZ knowingly engaged in activity
that created a grave risk of death. One could justify a charge of Criminally Negligent Homicide
or vehicular homicide, but VZ was clearly aware of the risk of a diabetic seizure to his ability to
drive. Furthermore, it's not clear that VZ actually violated the Motor Vehicle Law (NYHS 232)
because it's not clear whether he has had a seizure in the past three months (which would
increase the charge to a class C felony under 232).

Proceeding under Manslaughter, we can argue as the prosecution that VZ was aware of
the risk of driving (as shown by the advice from his doctor not to drive) and aware that the
attendant circumstance (his diabetes) exists. He furthermore consciously disregarded that risk by
accepting the keys from his wife and driving on a freeway. He has had three seizures in the past
and his wife always drives their car.

First, the defense will argue that (i.e. Decina) that at the time of the accident, VZ was
having a diabetic seizure and thus his actions were not voluntary (MPC 2.01(2)(d) - actions were
not the "product of the determination of the actor"). This question ultimately comes down to
time-framing. If one looks simply at the moment of the accident, the actions were involutnary
due to the seizure ("became unresponsive at the wheel"). If we expand the time frame to cover
the choice to accept they keys, drive, and take the diabetic medicine that perhaps caused the
accident, VZ appears more culpable. The defense might also assert that VZ was simply not
reckless and had been given a license to drive.

The defense could also raise a Choice of Evils defense (MPC 3.02). Given that his wife
was upset and had been drinking at the wake and that Richard Tanguay's (RT) license had been
revoked, the defense will argue that the choice to drive was the objectively correct choice (from
a utilitarian calculus perspective). As a utilitarian calculus, the defense will assert that diabetes
affects more than 24 million people in the United States and it is inconceivable that none of them
should ever drive. Under a Law and Economics line of argumentation, the defense would argue
that we should compare the risk associated with driving and the benefits of driving and having a
more productive life. As noted by Tom Hopkins, the choice to drive must be a balance between
individual libertiy and public safety. In this instance, given his wife's intoxication and RT's
license issue, VZ will argue that his choice to drive was the lesser of two evils. The defense
might also argue proximate cause - noting that it's not clear that taking the oral medication is


what caused his seizure in the first place (it could have been due to other factors).

In response, the prosecution will argue that we should expand the time frame to include
the choices VZ made that let up to the accident, as the court chose to do in Decina. By expanding
the time frame, the court would consider the choice to drive, the advice from his doctor, the
choice to take oral medication that could have caused the crash. This choice is perhaps an
arational one (Kelman), but it seems likely that given the string of poor choices and knowing his
condition, the prosecution would win this point. The defense's mens rea argument (that VZ was
simply not reckless at all because he had a license) is undercut by the fact that he did not disclose
his condition when he got his license 13 months ago. While he's had three seizures in the past
year, it's not clear how many seizures VZ had before getting his license. However, given his
condition and his doctor's recommendation not to drive at all and his clear awareness and
disregard of the risk, the choice to get behind at all was almost certainly reckless. The
prosecution could successfully argue that such a choice was a gross deviation from the standard
of care of a reasonable person in the situation, especially given the advice of the doctor.

The most interesting disagreement seems to be over whether the choice to drive was truly
the lesser of two evils. From a utilitarian perspective, the defense has a decent case that the loss
in productivity from people who are diabetic no driving outweighs the very small chance of harm
of an accident. However, the defense is perhaps framing this too broadly. The question under
MPC 3.02 is whether in this instance the actor believed (subject to the modification in 3.09) that
it was the lesser of two evils to get behind the wheel. Narrowed to this particular instance, VZ
had other options besides driving. RT, despite his lack of a license, could have driven. They also
could have called a cab. Narrowed to these facts, given the recommendation not to drive by his
doctor and his history of seizures (which seems high for a diabetic), the prosecution has the
stronger case. The final defense on proximate cause appears quite weak. Even if the oral
medication didn't cause the accident, the chocie to drive and the seizure is what caused the
accident and such result was not "too remove or accidental" (MPC 2.03).

Charges Against Samantha Peters:

Prosecution would charge Samantha Peters (SP) with Manslaughter as an accomplce to
VZ under MPC 2.06. The prosecution can argue that all the required elements are met - she aided
VZ by giving him the keys and allowing him to drive. Under the Manslaughter statute, she was
aware of the substantial and unjustifiable risk posed by her husband driving under his condition.
Iam assuming that SP was aware of her husband's diabetes, which seems very likely. Under the
circumstances, it was a gross deviation from what a reasonable person would do under the
circumstances.

The defense makes similar choice of evils defense, arguing that it was not unreasonable
under the circumstances to give her keys away since she was upset/drunk. Given that this charge
is for manslaughter and not murder, SP would not have any need to bring up a provocation
argument, although given that NYHS 231 does not adopt extreme emotional disturbance, she
would have a difficult time fitting her experience into a common law provocation category and
dealing with the cooling off requirement. The defense might argue (incorrectly, as seen below)
that for accomplice liability she must act with purpose that the crime occur and she did not


intend for anyone to get hurt during the accident. She might also argue that she was intoxicated
at the time and thus not reckless.

Any argument related to the voluntary act will come out as above. For the choice of evils
defense, SP's argument is likely prohibited by MPC 3.02(2) because she was negligent/reckless
in bringing about the situation requiring the choice of evils in the first place. Knowing that she
always drives due to her husbands condition, she chose to drink at that party and the prosecution
has a strong argument that her actions were at least negligent because it could lead to this "choice
of evils". Furthermore, under 2.06(4) for accomplice liability, SP only has to have the same mens
rea as the underlying offense because Manslaughter is a result crime. She need only be reckless,
which is borne out by her knowledge of her husband's condition, his three seizures in the past
year, ect. Her final argument about intoxication is precluded by 231, which says that voluntary
intoxication cannot be a defense to not recognizing the risk.

Charges I would not bring:

Despite the fact that AR and BR were coming back from getting heroine, there's no need
to charge them (perhaps under 230(4)) because there's no indication that their actions caused the
accident.

I would also not charge RT with anything because there's no evidence that he was aware
of VZ's condition, a reasoanble person would not perceive the risk (negligent homicide), and he
did not aid VZ. If such evidence of awareness surfaces, he could be charged with negligent
homicide or manslaughter. A 3.02 defense is likely thwarted by his negligence in losing his
license. Any charge for vehicular manslaughter is unlikely because RT was not driving and did
not aid VZ in driving.

Question Two:

Based on the language of the NYPC and the facts of the Garner and Gurley cases, I
would make three substantive changes to the text. First, 1 would add in a requirement that the use
of force by an officer effecting an arrest must be proportional to the necessity of the situation and
not otherwise prohibited by the New York Police Handbook given the underlying offense and the
danger posed to society. Second, I would change the deadly force requirement under subsection
(1)(a)() to include only the attempted or threatened use of deadly force, not simply the use of
any physical force. Third, I would change subsection (2) to state that paragraphs (a) and (b) of
subsection (1) do not constitute a justification for negligent (not reckless) conduct by officers
towards innocent persons. I will address each potential change in order. However, I am not
altogether convinced that the language of the NYPC statute made a substantial difference in
these particular cases, as I will address at the end.

First Change:

The first relevant change would be to Subsection 1, which as currently constituted notes
that an officer my use force "when and to the extent that he or she reasonably believes such to be
necessary to effect the arrest." This language should be changed to read as follows: "The use of


force must be proportional to the reasonable necessity of the situation, the severity of the
underlying offense, and must not be otherwise prohibited by the New York Police Handbook." I
am assuming for the purposes of this section that Officer Pantaleo's use of force was not deadly
physical force. This is likely true despite the fact that an officer putting his/her arm around
somone's neck is dangerous, it likely doesn't arise to deadly physical force. If using a taser is not
deadly physical force (Sanger), the a chokehold is likely not either.

In relation to the Garner case, Officer Pantaleo performed what was termed a
"chokehold" by some and a "takedown manuver" by others (depending on one's personal take of
the case). Pantaleo argued to the grand jury that he reasonably believed that his actions were
necessary to effect the arrest, and it seems plausible from the video that Garner was resisting
arrest when he waved his arms and wouldn't allow Pantaleo to pin his arm behind his back. On
the letter of the law as written, it appears that Pantaleo might be justified in using some force to
effect the arrest. While the statute's language says that the officer may use force "to the extent"
necessary, I do not believe this language fully captures the problem at hand.

Terminology aside, Officer Pantaleo put his arm around Garner's neck, choked him,
pushed his head into the pavement, and stayed on his back all while Garner stated over and over
that he could not breath. Garner died from dyspnea (too much CO? in the blood) as a result.

The dramatic use of force did not line up with the necessity of the situation or the underlying
offense (selling loosies, or untaxed single cigarettes). Not only was the use of force likely well
out of line considering the severity of the offense, it was explicitly prohibited by the New York
Police Handbook, which told officers to stay away from the neck. Under the statute as written,
Pantaleo could make a case that a reasonable officer would use force in this instance to effect the
arrest. However, his choice of means did not line up with the situation at hand. In my view, the
case against Officer Pantaleo (had it ever gotten out of the Grand Jury) should have come down
to the reasonableness of the manuver in this circumstance and the proximate causation issues
associated with Garner's underlying health issues. Instead, the Grand Jury likely focused entirely
on the fact that Garner was technically resisting (albeit slightly) and had medical issues (obesity
and asthma). The statute should force the fact finder to grapple with the disporportionate extent
of the use of force given the NY handbook's directive to stay away from the neck.

Second (Minor) Change:

Secondly, I would change subsection (1)(a)(i) from it's current language. Curretly, it
reads that the officer may use force when the underlying offense was: "(i) a felony or an attempt
to commit a felony involving the use or attempted use or threatened imminent use of physical
force." I would change the language away from the imminent use of physical force, to the
imminent use of "deadly physical force" or "force likely to cause substantial bodily harm." This
change doesn't particularly relate to the cases at hand, given that I have assumed above that
Pantaleo's actions were force (not deadly force) and Officer Liang was not trying to arrest
anyone (much more on this later). However, the normative choice that this statute makes seems
difficult to justify and subject to dispute after the fact.

An illustration will clarify my point. Let's assume that officers respond to a bar fight
between A and B (perhaps a fist-fight). One officer tries to arrest A, and he slips away and is


about to throw another punch at B. Would the office be justified in using shooting A at this
point? The language of the statute seems to suggest so, assuming that assault is a felony and A is
attempting to use of physical force against a person (B). In my view, this outcome is unjust. The
officer should not be permitted to use deadly force unless person A is attmpting to use deadly
physical force or force that would cause substantial bodily harm.

Third Change:

The final change I would make relates to Subsection 2 of the NYPC on use of force by
law enforcement. The language essentially states that an officer may not use the justification
provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) if he/she is reckless in his/her conduct "with respect to
innocent persons whom he or she is not seeking to arrest or retain in custody." I would change
the word "reckless" to "negligent". This maps directly onto the situation in the Gurley case.
There, Officer Liang and his partner were conducting a Vertical Patrol in a public housing unit
(something that happens upwards of 50,000 times per month), whereby they run down the
stairwell to ensure that no one is doing anything illegal. In this instance, Officer Liang took his
gun out of its holster and pushed open the door of the stairwell with his shoulder and somehow
shot a bullet down into the stairwell, persumably by accident. This resulted in the death of Akai
Gurley, who was apparently in the stairwell doing nothing illegal at all. While the officer
claimed that the incident was a tragic accident, the question came down to recklessness.

My issue with the statute is this - it only punishes officers for reckless conduct towards
innocent parties and says nothing about whether the conduct was negligent, presumably letting
negligent officers off scott free. Recklessness and negligence are distinguished primarily thorugh
the subjective awareness of the risk and Officer Liang will likely claim that it was common
practice (custom) for officers to take out their gun before doing these patrols, despite the fact that
the Police Handbook instructed them to keep their guns in the hoster with the strap off. Whether
Officer Pantaleo actually ever read this manual or was trained accordingly is a factual question,
but if he was trained otherwise (i.e. to take his gun out), he has a reasonable claim that he was
simply negligent because he was not subjectively aware of the risk of his activity.

Essentially, the statute as written would provide cover for neligent police officers who
would be liable for negligent homicide without their status as a police officer. From a critical
theorist perspective, we should peel back our assumptions of the level of deference we give to
police officers. This statute is a clear representation of that deference, as officers have cover
from negligent behavior towards innocent civilians they are not attempting to arrest. We should
querry why we feel the need to provide that level of deference towards police officers. Certainly
their jobs are important and dangerous, but why not punish objectively negligent behaivor that
leads to the death of an innocent man? Perhaps Liang was reckless in this instance and the
problem is moot. But the language should not preclude prosecution of negligent officers who kill
innocent people.

Final Point;

These two tragic instances led to the death of two unarmed black men. The changes that I
have suggested, while perhaps helpful in the future, might not actually address the underlying


problem in this case. Even if the laws had been better, more clearly written, Officer Pantaleo
might not have been charged because the DA in Staten Island didn't want to charge him. From a
Law and Society perspective, the laws on the books might not map onto the outcomes in
practice, especially given the power dynamics of police and african-americans.
