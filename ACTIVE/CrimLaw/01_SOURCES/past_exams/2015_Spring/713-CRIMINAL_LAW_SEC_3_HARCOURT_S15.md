Question |

I would charge Vincent Zanfardino (VZ) with manslaughter in relation to the death of Alfred
Reitano (AR).

VZ cannot be charged with murder because he did have the requisite mens rea of intedning to
cause the death of another person (NYHS 230(1)). There is no evidence to show that It was VZ's
conscious objective to kill AR. Similarly, VZ did not engage in conduct which creates a grave
risk of death to another person under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to human
life (NYHS 230(2)). The evidence shows that VZ suffered only three seizures in the previous
year prior to the accident. Thus, while VZ may have been aware of the the risk that he would
have a seizure while driving and he may have been aware that having a seizure while driving
would create a risk of injury or death to others, it did not constitute a grave risk of death or
manifest an extreme indifference to human life. An example of an extreme indifference to human
life that recklessly creates a grave risk of death would be discharging a gun in a crowded room
without the purpose of hitting anyone, not driving a car when the risk of a seizure is miniscule.
Similarly, this conclusion would dismiss a charge based on NYHS 230(4) because the conduct
did not create a great enough risk to be characterized as grave. Finally, VZ was not in the course
of commiting a qualifying felony pursuant to NYHS 230(3).

The only issue then is whether VZ should be charged with manslaughter, criminally negligent
homicide, or vehicular homicide in relation to the death of AR. The real question then is the
mens rea of VZ. Did he act recklessly, negligently, or does only strict liability apply. To act
recklessly with respect to a result, VZ must have been aware of and consciously disregard a
substanital and unjustifiable risk that such result will occur. The risk must be of such nature and
degree that disregard thereof constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a
reasonable person would observe in the situation (NYHS 231(1)). First of all, the risk of seizure
and an accident were not justified in this situation. VZ would argue that because Richard
Tanguay (RT) did not have a valid driver's license and Samantha Peters (SP) was intoxicated and
was feeling light-headed, his decision to drive was justified by the lack of another available
driver. However, this argument ignores the fact that the group could have called a taxi or a friend
to bring them home. The group was under no duress or pressure so there was no reason they
could not have found a safer method of returning home. Thus, the risk was likely not justified.
Second, VZ was aware of and consciously disregarded a substantial risk. The evidence shows
that VZ took oral diabetic medication immediatly prior to driving the car. It can be inferred from
this act that VZ was aware of the risk of having a hypoglycemic seizure or some other
complication related to his condition. Similarly, VZ had suffered seizures before and had been
expressly warned by his doctor against driving. Finally, VZ lied about his seizures when
applying for his driver's license, which shows that he knew his seizures could affect his ability to
drive or to obtain a new license. VZ will argue that the seizures were too rare to raise his
awareness to a level that would allow him to have the requisite mens rea of recklessness. Instead,
he would argue that he simply failed to perceive the risk of a seizure and accident so that only
Criminally negligent homicide is applicable, or that the risk was not of a nature and degree that
failure to perceive it would constitute a gross deviation from the standard of care of a reasonable


person, so that only vehicular homicide is applicable. However, given the evidence of VZ's
doctor and his actiosn of taking medication immediatly prior to driving, he likely was aware of
the risk and he did act recklessly as long as his actions constitute a gross deviation from the
standard of care. VZ will argue that hsi actions did not constitute a gross deviation from the
standard of care because the risk was so minute that a reasonable person would have acted
similarly. However, based on the evidence, there a number of causes of hypoglemic seizures and
if blood glucose levels are not regularly monitored and controlled, there is a substantial risk of
complications, including seizures. Based on this evidence and the fact that VZ was warned by his
doctor about the risk, it seems likely that his actions were a gross deviation from the standard of
care. Thus, it is likely VZ is guilty of manslaughter under NYHS 231(1) as long as there are no
actus reus or causation issues.

There are no causation issues. But for VZ's acts of driving, having a seizure, and losing control
of the car, the accident would not have happened and AR would not have died when and how he
did. There is no intervening cause between VZ's conduct and the social harm, so VZ's conduct
was a proximate cause of the result.

There is an issue, however, of actus reus. The requirement of actus rues is that there must be a
voluntary act (or omission). A voluntary act is one in which a movement of the body follows our
volition. VZ will argue that he was not in control of his movements during the seizure and
accident and thus cannot be charged with a crime. However, the law only requires that the
prosecution show that D's conduct involved a voluntary act. Proper use of the voluntary act
requirement requires a court to focus on the relevant conduct (the conduct performed with the
requisite mens rea) that actually and proximately caused the social harm of the offense charged
(Moore). This is a time framing issue. The relevant mens rea is recklessness, so any action that
VZ performed with recklessness that actually and proximately caused the accident and
subsequent death of AR is sufficient actus rues. Thus, VZ's act of getting in the driver's seat and
beginning to drive with the awareness of the risk isa _ sufficient voluntary act in this case. The
only other issue which VZ can then raise is that his action in beginning to drive was not a
proximate cause of the accident because of the intervening cause of the seizure. However, given
his awareness of the possibility of a seizure, this intervening cause followed rationally from VZ's
voluntary act and was foreseeable under the circumstances. Thus, VZ likely completed a
voluntary act with the requisite mens rea that actually and proximately caused the social harm
(death). Thus, he is likely guilty of manslaughter. If the court decides that he is not guilty of
manslaughter, he is likely guilty of negligent homicide and at the very least, guilty of vehicular
homicide as long as there proximate cause is found.

VZ should be charged with Reckless Endangerment in relation to the injuries of RT, SP, and
Brynn Rohlf (BR)

It has already been been established that VZ likely acted recklessly by engaging in conduct
which created a substantial risk. Was there a substanital risk of serious injury. As discussed
before, yes there was likely a substantial risk. Driving on a highway with awareness of the risk of
a seizure that will cause a loss of control is likely a substantial risk of serious physical injury to
everyone in the car and the surrounding cars, as well as pedestrians. Thus, given the arguments
about mens rea, actus reus, and causation discussed above, VZ is likely guilty of reckless


endangerment.

Charge SP with Reckless Endangerment in relation to the injuries of RT, SP, and BR as well as
manslaughter in relation to the death of AR, and DUI.

The MPC provides that a person is guilty of an offense by his own conduct or the conduct of
another person for which he is legally accountable. A person is legally accountable for the
conduct of another person when he is an accomplice of such other person in the commission of
the offense. The issue is whether SP was an accomplice of VZ. The evidence shows that SP
pulled over at a rest stop and asked someone else to drive. Additionally, she asked RT expressly
to drive, but not VZ. SP will argue that this general questioning does not constitute aid or
solicitation. The prosecution will argue that this constitutes solicitation of VZ to commit the
offenses. However, it would seem the defense has the better argument. The question was directed
at either of the two men, and she specifically asked RT to drive but not VZ. Furthermore, it is
very questionable whether SP has the requisite mens rea of recklessness with respect to the
result. It is not likely that SP had the same level of awareness of the risk of seizure as VZ. Thus,
it is likely SP will not be guilty of any of the crimes unless she is an accomplice under
2.06(3)(a)(iii), in that she has a legal duty to prevent the commission of the offense and she
ommitted to do so. SP has the status relationship of wife to VZ, which does fall under the
common law legal duty. This may be a better argument, because SP failed to prevent VZ from
driving and likely had a legal duty to do so. However, she still liely does not have the requisite
mens rea necessary. Thus, SP will likely not be convicted of Reckless endangerment or
manslaughter but could possibly convicted as an accomplice to Negligent Homicide or Vehicular
homicide, depending on whether her status as an accomplice and her mens rea.

RT cannot be charged as an accomplice because there is no evidence he aided VZ in any way or
that he had a legal duty to prevent VZ from acting.

BR can be charged with any drug related offenses (possession, purchase) that are applicable to
the buying of herion. There is not enough evidence to speculate on the success of the charges
