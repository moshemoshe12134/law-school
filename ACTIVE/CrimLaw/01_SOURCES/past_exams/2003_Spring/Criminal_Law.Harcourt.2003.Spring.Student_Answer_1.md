Question 1

Part 1

The biggest difference between this statute and those we looked at in class is the move

away from the issue of consent. This is in sharp contrast to NY Penal Law § 130.05 which says
“sexual act committed without consent” and later defines what constitutes a lack of consent.
Only in the context of a person knowingly unable to consent is the issue of consent raised in this
‘IL statute. The question of resistance is also not discussed by the statute (in contrast with Brown
y. State and People v. Dorsey). Generally, the victim’s actions are not a factor under this statute.
Instead, this statute focuses on the actions of the defendant. One interesting aspect of the statute
is its mens rea requirement for rape of an underage victim. In most states, even a reasonable
mistake as to the person’s age will not be a defense. However, this statute prescribes negligence
as the mens rea. The actus reus is clearly defines throughout the statute. Almost any contact
between the genitals, reproductive fluid, or other specified area of the body with any part of the
other’s body or object will qualify as sexual conduct. This is a much more detailed part of the
statute than other statutes we looked at. Even the somewhat detailed Texas sodomy law did not
cover as many specific actions as listed in this statute. One other distinct element of this statute
is the mens rea requirement for “Sexual Exploitation of a Child”. The required mens rea is
intent, but the intent is to “achieve sexual arousal or gratification of himself or others”. This is
particularly interesting because it covers those that sell child pornography not because they are
aroused, but because the arousal it provides others creates a marketplace for it. One other

distinct aspect of the statute is the liability it creates from parents that knowingly (note that

negligence is not enough) allow a person to engage in prohibited conduct with their minor child.

Part 2

There are several significant differences between this statute and the one proposed by
Schulhofer. One of the biggest differences is the focus on consent. Over one third of
Shulhofer’s statute is a discussion of consent and a list of situations where consent is not freely
given. Section 202(c)(4) is one example of how the victim’s conduct and state of mind are still a
major part of an inquiry under the Schulhofer statute. That section requires the jury to ask why
consent was given. On the other hand, the proposed IL statute does not seem to arrive at the
question of consent. If a person uses force to get another to have sex with him, then the statute
applies. It does not seem to matter that the person consents or why they consent, if force or the
threat of force was used.

Another major difference is the mens rea requirement for knowedge of the victim’s age.
Under Schulhofer’s statute, the requirement is recklessness. In contrast, the requirement under
the proposed IL statute is negligence. This is a big difference for a defendant claiming not to
have known that the victim was underage.

The grading of the crimes is also different between the two statutes. The only first degree
felony under the Schulhofer statute is where a defendant uses a weapon or causes serious bodily
harm to force another to submit to an act of penetration. In contrast, the proposed IL statute
makes it a first degree felony if the defendant is 17+ and the victim is less than 9 years old.

Also, if it is a first degree felony if the victim is impregnated by the defendant. The bodily harm
first degree felony requirement is reduced in the IL statute to those that threaten death (though

those causing bodily harm are also included).

Perhaps, the most significant difference in the two statutes is that the Schulhofer statute
requires penetration. On the other hand, the IL propoAssed statute only requires contact, even

qualifying it saying “however slight”.

Part 3

The strength of the statute is that it furthers the progress made over the years to bring
rape statutes in line with other areas of criminal law. A person’s consent does not matter in a
robbery case. The conduct of the victim is generally irrelevant in the criminal law (with the
exception of provocation in manslaughter cases and other such situations). This statute shifts the
focus in sex crime cases to the actions and the mens rea of the defendant, rather than the consent
or lack of resistance by the victim.

Another strength of the statute is its inclusions of non-penetration sex crimes. Sexual
contact and conduct is in no way limited to penetration. Statutes that focus solely on penetration
ignore many other sex crimes that need to be addressed. Two particularly significant portion of
this statute are those that prohibit semen transmission onto the body or clothing of a victim and

the prohibition on enticing a minor to get undressed. Neither of these acts involve or require

penetration, and thus could not be prosecuted under a statute requiring penetration.

Part 4

One weakness of the statue is how powerful it is. It casts a very large net, and punishes
those that it catches quite severely. With out a doubt, sex crimes are awful and society should
needs protections against it. However, this statute could end up punishing those it was not

intended to. As discussed above, this statute lumps a large number of acts into the category of a

class 1 felony. Under this law a person could have sex with a girl that is very drunk think that it
is perfectly normal consensual sex. However, because of the intoxication of the victim, she may
fall into the category of being unable to knowingly consent. If the intercourse leads to pregnancy

then the sex becomes a class one felony. Interestingly, the statute also may go to easy on some

people as a large number of rapes will only be Class 1 misdemeanors (1301(4)(e).

Part 5

Given the choice between only this statute and the Schulhofer, I would vote for this
statute. There are two primary reasons for this: (1) the Schulhofer statute does not cover non-
penetration sex crimes (which would seem to be numerous), (2) the Schulhofer statute focuses
two much on the mind and actions of the victim rather than the mens rea and actus reus of the

defendant (not in line with other parts of criminal law).

Question 2
1. With regard to Lane
a. Vandalism
i. She intentionally vandalized the Starbucks. She Satisfies both the mens
rea and actus reus.
ii. The justification for the vandalism was necessity. The world is in trouble.
' Disorder seeks to save it. The vandalism was necessary to make other
aware of the problems of globalization.
iii. The evil is not greater than the harm. It is arguable whether globalization
is even harmful. There is not an immediate danger that necessitates this
, action.
b. Robbery
i. She was an accomplice to a robbery. She aided Roberts by going with
him to the Starbucks and causing mayhem in the Starbucks while the
robbery occurred.
ii. She lacked the mens rea. She did not even have knowledge that there was
going to be arobbery. She may have had the mens rea to commit a crime
(vandalism), but not the crime that was committed (robbery).
iii, I would try to get around the MPC’s rejection of liability for crimes that
are “natural and probable” results of the crime that the accomplice had the
mens rea for.

c. Conspiracy to commit Robbery



rel Law 6/12
Harcourt
Spring 2003

i. She conspired to commit robbery. She made an agreement to go to
Starbucks with Roberts to further the “Disorder”.

ii. The agreement was to vandalism, she explicitly did not agree to be a part
of a robbery.

iii. She was a part of a bigger conspiracy. The money from the robbery was
to benefit the entire conspiracy (connecting the spokes).
d. Murder (accomplice)

i. She aided Roberts by screaming and indicating that he needed to shoot
Berg.

ii. There is no mens rea here. It is established that she hates violence. She
also did nothing to further the murder (if it was murder and not self
defense), the scream was out of fear, not a signal or warning to Roberts.

iii. She also fled the scene with Roberts, she may have helped him get a cab
and get to the airport.
e. Conspiracy to commit counterfeiting, robbery (two armored trucks) (analysis is
the same so I will discuss the two together)

i. Lane was a part of a large wheel conspiracy. Roberts was the center that
connected the spokes. However, there was a wheel that connected the
spokes because Lane was aware of the other members in the conspiracy
(even knew identities), she discussed her actions with them, and the
criminal acts were undertaken to benefit the entire conspiracy (despite the
claim not to have an objective they all agreed to join Disorder with the

purpose of acting against globalization).

Wh2

Lane lacked the mens rea to commit those crimes and did not take part ina
substantial step. Under the MPC, membership alone in a conspiracy is not
generally enough to make a member liable for the actions of other
members. Also, she told the members of the conspiracy of her objection
to violence and unease with the robbery.

It is arguable at best that she renounced her role in the conspiracy
(especially since she fled with Roberts from the scene of the murder).
However, she did not withdraw from the conspiracy because she did

nothing to thwart future criminal actions of the conspiracy.

She was part of an enterprise (Disorder) that was involved in a series of
racketeering activities (robbery, murder).

She still lacks mens rea for any racketeering activity. Vandalism is not
listed in §1961 as a racketeering activity, and that is all that she had the
mens rea for.

She was a part of a large “wheel” type conspiracy that satisfies both the
enterprise requirement and engaged in reackateering activities. She agreed
to join it and did not renounce her membership (only some displeasure).
She did nothing to thwart the actions of others, and actually escaped from

the murder with Roberts rather than going to the police

b. RICO
' i. He was part of an enterprise (Disorder) that was involved in a series of
racketeering activities (robbery, murder).

ii. He was only involved with one racketeering activity and he renounced his
membership in the enterprise.

iii. He helped with the getaway following the murder and did not renounce
until after the racketeering activities occurred.

c. Conspiracy to commit Robbery (Starbucks, Brink’s Ukiah), Counterfieting, and
Murder

‘i. Was a part ofa larger conspiracy of spokes connected through Roberts and
with a connecting wheel that was the funding and awareness raised for the
anti-globalization efforts.

ii. Did not have the mens reas for those crimes and never made an agreement

to do them. Also he left the conspiracy and told the government

everything he knew.

iii. He did not renounce until after the crimes had been committed. Though he
went to the police, he did not thwart (or because of timing) attempt to
thwart the activities.
3. With regard to Green
a. Conspiracy to sell illegal firearms
i. He agreed to sell the illegal firearms and took the substantial step of
obtaining the weapons from Roberts
ii. He feigned agreement, so there was not actually an agreement. He left the
conspiracy by not selling the guns.
iii, He did no feign agreement. He just changed his mind. He did not convey
his removal from the conspiracy to Roberts nor law enforcement. Nor did
he thwart the weapon sales or render them useless, because he gave
Roberts the equivalent money.
b. Conspiracy to launder money
i. He agreed with Roberts to launder money and took the substantial step of
taking the checks.
ii. He feigned agreement. He did not even know how to launder money, so
how could he agree to it. By not cashing them, he thwarted the crime.
iii. He did not feign agreement. Once he had the checks he did not know
what do with them. The crime was not thwarted, because the checks were
not destroyed and could have been given back to Roberts.

c. RICO

iii.

10/12

He was a part of an enterprise that engaged in Rackateering activities
(money laundering, illegal arm sales).

He did not do either of those. Neither rackatering activity ever occurred.
Plus he was not a part of an enterprise (he rejected joining the larger
conspiracy).

A two person partnership is enough for an enterprise (Green and Roberts).

4. With regard to Jacobson

' a. Robbery

i.

iii.

She aided Roberts in robbing the armored car by providing the routes,

crews, and cargos.

. She lacks the mens rea. The MPC requires that an accomplice have the

mens rea for the crime. She was just telling a person she was romantically
involved with about her day.

She knew what she was doing. ‘This is similar to the “a wink and a nod”
problem with corporate criminal liability. She can’t just provide all of the
information for a robbery and claim that she was just talking about her

day.

Question 3

The thesis that Katz develops is that the dominant approach to criminal studies focuses
too much on background and should be shifted to focusing on the foreground of the crime. The
reason why so much of criminal law is focused on issues other than white collar crime is because
of an approach to criminal behavior that points usually to economic troubles as the root or cause
of the illegal behavior. Instead, he suggests that inquiries into criminal behavior (empirical and
theoretical) should look the crimes themselves and their attractiveness. One possible illustration
is a child shoplifting some candy. It is likely that it was the thrill of getting caught, not a need
for gum that instigated the behavior.

The current application of mail and wire fraud statutes seem to strongly support Katz’s
ideas. The first reason the current application of the statutes support Katz is the behavior that is
exhibited in mail and wire fraud cases. The defendants are not economically troubled, but rather
are often wealth or powerful or both. The fact that so many politicians fall into the category of
depriving their constituents of a right to honest services supports the idea that crime is attractive
to people for reasons other than economic need. In many cases the seduction may come from the
lure of greater power. Elected officials tend to have power, money, and respect. Why would
people situated in such a good position commit a crime? Katz theories about the seductions and
attractiveness of crime are exactly the reason.

Another reason why the mail and wire fraud statutes support Katz is found in the Rakoff
quote. Prosecutors use the mail and wire fraud statute because it is simple, adaptable, and
comfortable. This comfort and simplicity is directly linked to the statutes’ vagueness. Katz
provides a reason for this quality of the statutes. The dominant approach to criminal law

approaches criminal behavior in a way that does not adequately address white collar crime.

Because, there is this inadequate and hazy understanding of white-collar crime, the mail and wire
fraud statutes are necessarily vague. Under Katz’s approach, a better understanding of white-
collar crime would be developed and more specific and detailed statutes covering white-collar
crime could be drafted and passed into law.

The mail and wire fraud statutes are used as a catch all over white collar. It is a number
of sentences that vaguely define what crimes it covers. In contrast, there are several pages of the
Model Penal Code that address crimes against property. As Katz suggests, the dominant
‘approach to criminal behavior is one sided and does not adequately delve into the world of
white-collar crime. The mail and wire fraud statutes are used as a catch-alls because there are
not specific statutes addressing those crimes. The lack of statutes specifically discussing

different white-collar crimes points directly to Katz’s argument that the current approach to

criminal activity is flawed in a way that does not adequately address white-collar crime.
