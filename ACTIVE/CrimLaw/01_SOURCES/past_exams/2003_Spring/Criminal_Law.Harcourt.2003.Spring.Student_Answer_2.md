The proposed Sexual Assault statute imposes an actus reus of force, primarily. It also allows for
sexual contact to be defined as rape when consent cannot be given because of the inability of the
victim to “understand the nature of the act” or to knowingly consent. This provision therefore
limits the scope of non-consent in defining the offense. Without force, but when consent is a
possibility because of the victim’s capabilities, an unconsented to sexual contact would not
constitute rape. Further, for situations where the statute does provide for non-consent as a basis
for a rape conviction, the defendant has a knowledge mens rea. The mens rea for the rest of the
\

statute is not given, but if Illinois follows the MPC, there would be a default recklessness
provision. It is appropriate to read a recklessness provision into the statute, since it is hard to
imagine a perpetrator negligently imposing force or threat of force. This is modified somewhat
by the fact that for offenses involving underage victims, there is a negligence mens rea.

F orce in this statute also appears narrowly tailored. The definitions reference that it
‘includes’ confinement or restraint. It is not clear what it else it would include, not specifically
enumerated. Presumably, it would mean any physical action directed at the victim. In cases that
either define rape in terms of force, or in terms of non-consent, there is always some question as
to where the line is. Is force anything more than what is necessary to overcome the lack of
consent on the victim’s part? (Smith). In cases arising from statutes that impose a force
requirement, consent always seems to be lurking as an affirmative defense. Nevertheless, in
cases like Alston, it does make a difference, because nonconsent was not sufficient to justify a

rape conviction when force was deemed too remote.

This statute makes no provision for a mistake of fact defense, explicitly. It is also not
clear that one would work in practice, given that in Fischer, the relevant issue was the presence
or absence of consent.

In relation to the Model Penal Code, this statute defines sexual intercourse much more
broadly, to include any contact, however slight, of the victim’s sex organs, where the MPC limits
sexual intercourse to some penetration. In terms of the actus reus, as well, both contain force
elements, and both make reference to bodily harm. The MPC does not separate force alone from
force involving bodily harm, while the Statute elevates the latter case to a Class 1 felony.

There are no provisions in the statute relating to a marital rape exception, nor a reference
to deviate sexual intercourse, although a common sense understanding of deviance would
include sexual contact with minors.

In contrast with Schulhofer’s proposed statute, in 201(a), refers to physical force to make
the offense into a second degree felony, while not making specific reference to the threat of
force. Further, Schulhofer’s statute includes a non-consent element, which appears as a third
degree felony. The requirement is that the perpetrator have knowledge that he does not have the
consent of the victim. Robinson’s statute does not have the same provision for lack of
affirmative consent as a material element of the statute. However, for purposes of consent, the
threat of force appears in Schulhofer’s statute. Consent is not given when it is obtained by
threatening to inflict harm, among other things. For practical purposes, obtaining sexual contact
by threat of force is therefore a lesser felony, than by force; in Robinson’s statute, they are
coequal. In the nonconsent portion of Schulhofer’s statute, the standard is whether consent was
freely given, by words or conduct. Robinson’s examines whether the victim was able to give

consent, not whether it did take place.

The strengths of the Illinois statute, as proposed, are that it focuses virtually all of the
attention to the behavior of the perpetrator, and not to the victim. The existence of force, or
threat of force, will require testimony by the victim to get a conviction, but it will not be
primarily an examination of her mental state. Such requirements have the potential for too few
prosecutions and too few convictions. Rape is underreported enough that evidentiary obstacles
to bringing cases and gaining convictions should be deterred. It also maintains an objective
element for the actus reus, which is another way of reducing the emphasis on the victim’s mental
state.

This advantage is also a disadvantage, however. By not giving adequate attention to non-
consent it may have the effect of letting too much unwanted sexual conduct not count as rape.
Force may operate in the rape context as what is necessary to overcome nonconsent, but without
a specific provision defining rape in terms of either sexual contact without consent, or sexual
contact without an affirmative expression of consent, prosecutors and juries will probably rely on
the generally accepted definitions of force. This is especially problematic when the statute does
not adequately define ‘force’ as a term of art, merely listing two things it includes.

Another problem with the statute is that it may define too much as sexual assault. In
1301(3)(a), sexual intercourse expands to include in its definition, any contact, however slight
with genitals or objects. We saw cases where little sexual contact was sufficient for rape
convictions, such as Fischer or M.T.S. (where there was limited penetration), but this may prove
too much. The counterbalance to this claim is probably the use of ‘force’ in defining rape. One
may not forcibly touch the genitals of another, but if this is done, not ‘forcefully’ (the term is

vaguely used), it would still not be rape. The concern is that the criminal law may not want to be

involved in controlling how people have sex. It is easy to imagine slight contact with sex

organs, which may be reckless, coming about in the natural course of events. While the
appropriateness of this contact will vary according to specific situations, Katie Roiphe’s main
point is that it is not necessarily rape, and that it infantalizes women to think that it is,
definitionally. However, by only categorizing this type of ‘sexual intercourse’ as rape if done
forcefully or when consent is not a possibiltiy, this concern may not arise.

In choosing between Robinson’s and Schulhofer’s proposed statutes, it needs to be done
in terms of practical effects. The Schulhofer statute is fairly subtle, and it has the advantage of
allowing for different acts, so defined, to be punished with different mens reas. I see its main
advantage as the gradiation of rapes involving force and rapes involving knowing lack of consent
into second and third degree felonies. The implicit assumption, that using force, apparently
defined as more severe than that which is necessary to overcome nonconsent, is worse than
proceeding, presumably gently, without consent, may be appropriate. The overriding concern
appears to be to define the severity in terms of violence against the woman, not the violation of
her sexual autonomy. This balancing does not appear in Robinson’s statute. However, one
troubling element of Schulhofer’s statute is that it provides for a reckless act being more severely
defined than one with knowledge, a higher mens rea. Recklessly using force is a higher felony
than knowingly not obtaining consent. Knowingly not obtaining consent also includes ’
knowingly using a threat of force. I’m not sure that recklessly having rough sex is worse than
knowingly having sex without consent. Katie Roiphe’s concerns about rape laws are pertinent,
here.

In contrast, Robinson’s statute does not really concern itself with the manner in which
sex acts take place. Defining rape in terms of force may allow some sex acts not to be defined as

rape, but, as a practical matter, juries may not see them as rape anyway. That is not to say that

the attitudes are not worth changing, but criminal prosecutions may not be the best way to do
this. While the act requirement is broadly defined, it is tempered by the reference to force.
Force may also mean what is necessary to overcome consent, so even though there is no formal
requirement that rape be in terms of nonconsent, or lack of affirmative consent, in cases where
the perpetrator seems very culpable, it may be possible to cast the act in terms of force, as the
prosecution was able to do in the Barnes case. Prosecutorial discretion appears to be a double-
edged sword, both allowing for over and underinclusiveness.

Neither statute is perfect, but I think that Robinson’s is probably better. As a practical
matter, it may allow for just as many prosecutions, despite being more narrowly drawn, just due
to the inherent nature of some of the offenses. It also does not put the victim on trial, which is
always a concern with defining rape in terms of consent, with the exception of statutes requiring
an affirmative expression (though these run the risk of legislating sexual behavior). However,
what makes it preferable to Schulhofer’s is Schulhofer’s value-laden hierarchies of offenses and

culpabilities, and the problematic distinction he draws between actual force and threats of force.

It does not interpose itself as much into the sexual arena, and does not put the woman on trial.

Question 2:

Green

Charge 1: Conspiracy. Green participated in a number of conspiracies, including to launder
money, commit robbery, and sell firearms. Even though Green declined to carry any of the
crimes out, he nonetheless aggreed that others would do it. He therefore committed conspiracy
to commit robbery, sell firearms, and launder money. The overt act requirement does not arise,
assuming that these are first or second degree felonies. The Defense will argue that he

terminated his participation in the conspiracy by going to law enforcement. This will not be

convincing, as he only terminated his participation after agreeing to do so.

Charge 2: Robbery. Under the Pinkerton rule, a member of a conspiracy can be charged with
any crime committed by another member in furtherance of that conspiracy. Robbing the gun
stores furthered the conspiracy by carrying them out. Therefore, we can charge him wr robbing
the gun stores. The Defense will counter by looking at the scope of ‘in furthereance of.” in
Diaz, the court applied the Pinkerton rule to a crime committed that was not the ultimate
objective of the conspiracy. The charge was for a firearms violation, when the conspiracy

involved drug dealing. This is then not appropriate. The prosecution admits defeat.

Charge 3: Attempted money laundering. While Green was not able to launder the money, he
still accepted the checks. Appling the MPC provision, 5.01(c), for an incomplete result crime,
we can argue that accepting the checks constituted a substantial step, and that he had the
intention to launder the money. The defense will argue that under Murray, he only prepared for

the attempt, and that he took no effort to launder the checks. The prosecution’s rejoinder is that

Murray does not really set out a bright-line rule, merely the proposition that an attempt requires
an act in furthereance of the desired end. Accepting the checks is more significant a step than
Murray’s steps in marrying his niece. Green has already accepted stolen property, for instance,

and under the conspiracy, has agreed to launder it. (We can also charge him with MPC 223.6

receiving of stolen property, for which he is unquestionably guilty.)

Note: Because 5.03 appears to refer to agreements to commit specific crimes, it is not
appropriate to charge him with offenses committed without his knowledge. Even 5.03(2), the
scope of the conspirational relationship, appears to refer hjust to cases where one conspires with
others vicariously, but for known objectives. For Green, these appear limited to the crimes he

knows about.

Jacobson

Charge 1: Complicity in the Armored Car Robbery in Ukiah. Jacobson was an accomplice for

this crime because she aided him, under 2.06(3)(a)(ii). As for her mens rea, the severity of the

offense should be enough for us to infer intent to aid from her knowledge that she was doing so.

Under Beeman, there is also no earthly legitimate use for Roberts to have that information. The ‘
defense will argue that she was merely negligent with respect to her assistance, that she did not

know what his intentions were (mens rea relating to the mens rea of the principal), and further,

that since robbery is a result crime, under 2.06(4), she lacked the culpabiltiy required for the

offense. In MPC 222.1, there is no mens rea, so we assume recklessness. If she had any mens

rea with respect to the offense, it was negligence. The U.S. Attorney will respond by saying that

she may not be believable, given her sympathy with her views. It can also argue that, even if

true, (4) is a separate basis of accomplice liabiltiy, according to principles of statutory
construction. (3) refers to conduct prior to the offense, and (4) seems to refer more to conduct
during the offense — through refrences to words like ‘acting with the kind of culpability.’ In

contrast, (3)(a) involves ‘aids or agrees to aid.’ This allows for accomplice liability prior to the

commission of the offense.

Lane

Charge 1: Destruction of property. This is the easiest charge, since it is undisputed that Lane
intentionally trashed the Spokane Starbucks. The Defense may try to argue that it was justified,
as a means of political expression. The U.S. Attorney will argue, in contrast, under Warshaw,
that there is no emergency, it is not imminent, that there is no requirement that the actor resort to
criminality, and that the injury is more severe than the harm. Under the Warshaw concurrence
and Leno, the prosecution will argue that public policy in favor of globalization prevents the use
of the necessity defense in this situation.

Charge 2: Conspiracy to destroy property, armed robbery. These collapse into one inquiry. She
and Roberts agreed to trash the starbucks. She committed an overt act in the destruction of the
store and in the high level of planning. Under the Pinkerton rule, she is liable for the armed ‘
robbery. The defense will try to argue that the armed robbery was not in furtherance of what she
agreed to, as something incidental, and that she objected. The prosecution can argue that she
took no steps to stop him from carrying the gun.

Charge 3: Conspiracy to commit Rico (1962(d)). The “Disorder” arguably counts as an
enterprise, and has converted the “Local Anarchist” into an enterprise for racketeering activity.

She, herself, did not commit enough predicate offenses for a separate RICO charge, but she did


Te

agree to conduct the “Local Anarchist’s” affairs through racketeering activity. She agreed with
this objective, but perhaps not to certain acts, since she had a distaste for violence. The defense
will argue that she did not agree that 2 predicate acts be committed, only that there be an
‘enterprise’ that would engage in ‘direct action.” The prosecution will argue that, under

Neapolitan, agreeing to the separate acts is not required. All that has to be shown is that she

agrees to violations, in general.

Dudley

Charge 1: Armed Robbery. He and Roberts planned and intentionally robbed the armored truck.
The defense will not have much to say about this.

Charge 2: Conspiracy to Commit RICO. Under MPC 5.03(3), when one conspires to commit
multiple crimes, he is guilty of only one conspiracy, if the same object and agreement are
involved. This contrasts with Green, who had more limited knowledge. This conspiracy can
encompass the agreement to violate RICO, which is the most apt, since the goal in everything
was to promote “the disorder” and its objectives. Crimes in furtherance of it, committed without
Dudley’s direct participation but for which he can be convicted include the robbery of the Ukiah
armored car, the events in the starbucks, and arugably, the murder of Alan Berg. The defense
will argue that some of the crimes should not fall within the scope of the conspiracy. Berg’s
murder may not have been ‘in furtherance of’ the conspiracy. The argument against this is that
the goal of the conspiracy was not pecuniary gain but political motives, and murdering Berg
advanced this agenda.

Charge 3: 1962(c) — In conducting the business of the “Local Anarchist” in a manner to promote

racketeering activity, we can find two predicate acts. The first is that he participated in the


as

armed robbery. He was also complicit in the attempted money laundering of the checks. The

defense will argue that this rests on Green’s own culpability for the checks, but this may not be
the case since giving the checks to Green was a substantial step in having them laundered, which

may be sufficient to inculpate Dudley on this count.

Jack Katz’s argument in “Seductions of Crime,” has the purpose of understanding the
criminal law from a phenomenological point of view. His thesis is that there are common
elements of different types of crimes, across conventional categories, that contrast with the ways
in which we typically understand the different types of criminal laws, and, by extention,
criminals. More specifically, he understands the desire to commit crimes in terms of “sneaky
thrills,” that there is an attraction in the transgressive element of crime. He specifically applies
this analysis to so-called ““White Collar Crime,” where he finds the same element at work in
committing embezzlement as in the example of teenagers stealing pizza from a delivery car. He
also wants to reframe the goal as repulsing deviance.

The Mail Fraud statutes are considered a type of white collar crime, generally. §1341 is
characterized by “adaptive familiarity,” which is partly a function of its vagueness. All that is
required is a “scheme or artifice” to defraud, and that somehow the United States Mail is used.
§1346 expands the understanding of mail fraud to include deprivations of “honest services”
along with deprivations of property. A lot can fall under this heading, just as a lot of crime can
be understood in terms of sneaky thrills. Nevertheless, the Mail Fraud statute does not
necessarily support Katz’s thesis.

There is an element of ‘sneaky thrills,’ in perpetrating any fraud, understandibly.
However, most of the examples of mail fraud look at profit as a goal, primarily, not the joys in
being bad. In addition, in cases where there might be a ‘sneaky thrill,’ the mail fraud statute did
not make it into a violation. In some cases, like the bond scam in Durland, or the kickbacks in
McNally, or even the power to exert control over the board in Lopez-Lukis, there is some

prospect of personal gain that motivates, less so the personal pleasures. Lopez-Lukis is a tougher

case, since she was acting partly out of a desire for power and to benefit her husband, through
means not otherwise available. However, when the prospect of some personal benefit is so great,
it is hard to locate the motivation to break the law in its own, a priori, attractiveness.

By contrast, we can see examples of actions that do not violate the mail fraud, or related
stautes, that clearly constitute sneaky thrills. In Czubinski, the defendant was held not to violate
the wire fraud statute because he did not take anything. What he did, however, was use his
government computer to find out tax information about other Klansmen and his ex-girlfriend.
This is clearly a sneaky thrill. Although not illegal, it was still prohibited by his employer, the
IRS. While the government alleged this was part of a plan to build dossiers on supporters of .
David Duke, the acquittal was on the basis that he did no such thing. It is not crazy to assume,
therefore, that his motivation was in the fact that he could transgress his limits. The LaMacchia
case is also analogous. Acquitted on the technicality that Congress’s grant of copyright did not
constitute property that could be taken through wire fraud, he still undoubtedly derived pleasure
from facilitating the dissemination of copyrighted software. The pleasure was not in breaking
the law, but in exercising a certain amount of power, in doing something clearly unethical, but
not illegal.

These are largely descriptive claims about the relationship between Katz’ thesis and the ‘
applicable statutes. The normative elements are separate. The extent to which people are
attracted to things that are bad, appears to operate independently of the criminal law. This might
be a function of the breadth of the Mail Fraud statute — by looking at ‘any scheme or artifice,”
and the ambiguities of property (yes to honest services, as modified; no to gambling licenses,

copyrighted software, or private tax information), it may not be the type of crime that, by virtue


ies :

of its criminality, attracts people to break it. What will be a violation? To the extent that Katz
addresses the pleasures of badness, it fits.

However, there is a way in which the Katz thesis and the Mail Fraud statutes comport
with one another is the fact that the statutes cover a lot, but the same elements are required to
break them. Bond scams, scams to obtain proprietary business information (Carpenter), and
kickbacks, under the statute fall under the same realm as attempts to gain majority control of a
county board. These are widely disparate in their effects, but similar in what the state of mind is
of the person violating them. The goal is to take advantage of someone, to prey on their
reliances, or their ignorance. A participant in a kickback scheme can pocket the difference
because the end consumer may not know what the payer of kickbacks is willing to give up.
Someone can deprive constituents of honest services because elective office gives acces to
information that may not be available to anyone else. When the opporunities present themselves,
like the young theif stealing a necklace (p.59), the temptation becomes “irresistable,” in the same
way.

Nonetheless, given the ambiguities about ‘property’ and ‘honest services,’ it is the moral
element, not any notion of breaking a law per se that creates the seduction. This does not
severely undermine Katz’ thesis so much as complicate it. Crime appears to have a root in the
harm principle and in some notion of morality. These lines are not very distinct since most
people think most of what harms others is, itself, immoral (murder, rape, even fraud). Both
invite condemnation, although one is social and the other is criminal. Thinking back to
Czubsinski, one argument for not making his conduct a wire fraud violation is that the IRS can
(and will) discipline him. Even in Lopez-Lukis, there was the possibility of electoral

consequences if the public decided that it did not want the project she pressed for, and did not

approve of her conduct in the “videotape incident.” In LaMacchia, the owners of the copyrights
had civil remedies. The question Katz faces is whether there is anything about crime that makes
it attractive, over and against violations of morality, since both serve the same deterrent effect.
What we can conclude is that crime may not best be understood in terms of creating sneaky
thrills, since the criminal law is not necessary to create them. Katz’ goal of using the criminal
law to repulse deviance is a good one, although even here, it may extend beyond the scope of

what we want the criminal law to do — especially in cases like Czubinski, Cleveland, or

LaMacchia where other remedies are available.
