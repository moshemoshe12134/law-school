CRIMINAL LAW — Course NO. 30301
PROFESSOR BERNARD E. HARCOURT

WINTER & SPRING 2003

Final Examination

This is an open-book, three-hour, in-class examination. This examination consists of
11 pages (including this cover sheet). You may refer to written materials, but you may not
confer with anyone else. In other words, I’m expecting you to rely on your genius alone.
You may not speak or consult in any way with any other person during the exam.

There are three questions and you must respond to all three questions. The
examination will be graded 1/3 on each question, so I would recommend spending one hour
on each question.

You may answer the questions in any order that suits you. Please begin the answers
to each question on a new page, noting clearly the question that you are responding to.
Each exam answer page should include a header containing your student exam number,
the name of the examination, and the pagination, specifying the last page (e.g. “Page 3 of
10"). Please double space your answers with one inch margins, and use a 12 point New
Times Roman font.

Your answers should be specifically tailored to my questions. You should not cut
and paste any materials from your notes. In fact, if you feel tempted to cut and paste
materials from your notes, you should immediately think to yourself that the materials are
not sufficiently tailored to the question that I am asking. I am not interested in
unnecessary or irrelevant background information.

Please work on your organization, structure, argumentation and presentation. In
each question, I have provided you with a possible structure for your response. Please

either use that structure or a better one.

Thank you. Have a great summer when you’re done with exams!

Please write an essay that responds to the following five questions:

1,

How does this statute compare to the rape statutes that we studied in class? How
would you describe it along the dimensions of actus reus and mens rea?

How does this statute compare to the model rape statute proposed by Professor
Stephen J. Schulhofer in his book, Unwanted Sex: The Culture of Intimidation
and the Failure of Law, that we studied in class at the end of the Winter Quarter?
What are the strengths of the statute proposed by the Illinois Commission?

What are the weaknesses of the statute proposed by the Illinois Commission?

If you were given the authority to enact a new law of rape for the State of Illinois,
and you were given the choice between this proposed statute and the Schulhofer

proposed statute, which statute would you vote for? Please explain specifically
why you would vote the way you did.

Question #2:

In the fall of 2002, Matthew Roberts conceived the idea of a radical anarchist group
known as “The Disorder.” Roberts was the owner and publisher of a local newspaper in
Portland, Oregon, called the “Local Anarchist.” The newspaper supported itself mostly on
advertising by groups associated with the militia and anti-globalization movements. The paper
had several writers employed, including Nancy Lane and Francis Dudley. Roberts was
convinced that the United States needed to be saved from the “perverting influence” of the
federal government, of the United Nations, and of NATO. He decided to create a direct action .
group dedicated to overthrowing the federal government and liberating the country from the
influence of internationalism. He gathered together a group of like-minded individuals to
establish the organization, including Drew Pierce and Amanda Kemp. Pierce and Kemp had
previously associated themselves with various radical organizations such as the Montana Militia
and the Post-Waco Remembrance Society.

Roberts knew the law pretty well and recognized the vast powers of federal enforcement
agencies, and so he decided to try to avoid conspiratorial and other liability by not making any
agreements about what the “Disorder” would do as a group. Roberts called Lane, Dudley, Pierce
and Kemp for a meeting, and explained that it was time to start taking more direct action.
Roberts said that he would take all responsibility for overseeing the direct action, and would not
let any one of the others be involved in more than one specific act of direct action. Lane and
Dudley did not understand completely how this direct action would differ from their reporting,
but feeling the same sense of urgency at the world developments, agreed to work with the group
called “Disorder.”

Recognizing that the struggle required money, on October 28, 2002, Roberts called Lane
on the phone and worked out the details of a vandalism/robbery of a Starbucks in Spokane,
Washington, though he presented it to Lane as an act of anti-globalization expression. His phone
was tapped, and the F.B.L. transcript of the conversation reveals:

Roberts: This is your one mission — it’s a trashing of a Starbucks. Meet me
tomorrow outside the Starbucks on Washington and Monroe in Spokane at
12:00 p.m. and I'll have everything we need.

Lane: Okay. Just to make sure, though, please don’t bring anything dangerous. I
hate Starbucks and I can’t wait to trash the place, but I don’t want to be
involved in any action that could get anyone hurt. | hate violence even
more—

Page 7 of 11


The University of Chicago Law School
Professor Harcourt: Criminal Law June 9, 2003
Roberts: Sure, no problem. Just don’t worry about it. I'll take care of it all.

On October 29, 2002, Roberts met Lane at the designated corner. He was armed with a 9-
mm semi-automatic assault rifle, which he concealed from Lane. He also had black ski masks
for both of them. Together they went into the Starbucks and trashed the place, smearing red
paint all over the counters, and painting an anarchist symbol on the front glass windows.
According to the video footage from the hidden camera, Roberts also displayed his weapon and
took all the money from the cash register in a brown bag. The robbery yielded very little money,
though. When Lane found out about the robbery element on the TV news that evening, she was
shaken and troubled. She was upset that Roberts had engaged in a robbery during the incident, |
and called Dudley on the telephone to complain about what happened. Dudiey was not very
responsive and told her to “get over it.” [F.B.1. wiretap].

On November 15, 2002, Roberts called Pierce on the telephone and told him about a plan
to engage in counterfeiting. He explained that the “Disorder” needed money badly. Roberts said
he had fake bills, and asked Pierce to deposit them in his bank account. Pierce attempted to do
that, but was arrested for passing fake bills, and later released on personal recognizance.

In December 2002, Roberts convinced Dudley that he needed to segway from writing for
the “Local Anarchist” to engaging in more direct action. Explaining that the “Disorder” needed
money, Roberts convinced Dudley to go with him to Seattle to carry out a robbery of a Brinks
truck. The two meticulously planned the crime and their escape, but delayed execution of the
robbery until March, 2003.

In the interim, Roberts and Kemp robbed several gun stores to raise money for the
“Disorder.” Roberts had asked a sympathizer, Harold Green, who was a stringer for the “Local
Anarchist,” to participate in those robberies, but he declined, saying that he did not want to
engage in any activity where someone could get hurt. Green did, however, agree to sell some of
the stolen firearms. During the month of April, Roberts conveyed to Green thirty-six stolen
weapons, which Green agreed to sell. He stored them in his house, but never ended up selling
any of them. Fearing that Roberts would hurt him or his family, Green handed over $ 3,000 of
his own savings to Roberts claiming that those were gun proceeds.

On March 16, 2003, Roberts and Dudley carried out their earlier plan to rob the armored
truck. They obtained $ 139,000 in cash and $ 9,500 in checks. Roberts called Green on the phone
and asked him to launder the checks. Green agreed to do that, and several days later, he met with
Roberts and took the checks. However, he had no idea how to launder the checks and ultimately
did nothing with them.

Roberts then came in contact with a sympathetic employee of the Brinks Armored Car

Company, one Sheila Jacobson. Roberts and J acobson had a romantic relationship during which
Jacobson supplied Roberts with inside information about the routes, crews, and cargoes of Brinks
armored car routes. Jacobson now claims that she did not know that Roberts was involved in the
armored truck robbery in Seattle, but sympathized with his political views. From the information
that she gave him, the F.B.I. believes it is pretty clear that she must have realized that she was
disclosing highly confidential information. Jacobson claims that most of the information was
revealed while she would tell Roberts about her day.

Based on the Jacobson information, on June 2, 2003, Roberts and Pierce robbed Brinks’
Ukiah, California armored car run. The robbery netted approximately $ 3,600,000 in cash. The |
participants in the robbery received as salary and bonuses $ 40,000 for their part in the crime.
The rest of the money went into the coffers of the “Local Anarchist.” Some of the money was
donated to other radical groups.

Three days later, on June 5, 2003, emboldened by his success, Roberts murdered Alan
Berg, a Denver radio talk show host. Berg, a strong advocate of the United Nations and NATO,
was an outspoken critic of the “Disorder” and other radical groups. On his radio program, Berg
had criticized several radical organizations of which members of the “Disorder” had belonged,
had made fun of the “Local Anarchist” paper, and indicated that he suspected that Roberts might
be behind the “Disorder.” Roberts decided that Berg should be killed for his criticism of the
groups, to make a statement, and also to wipe out someone who was linking him to the crimes
committed by the “Disorder.” Roberts scheduled the incident to coincide with Lane being
interviewed on the radio show, though Roberts told no one about it. When Lane was in the radio
studio, being interviewed, Roberts entered the studio suite armed with the 9-mm semi-automatic
assault rifle hidden under his coat. He was speaking with the sound engineer and delaying to let
Lane finish the interview and leave the studio. Lane saw Berg reach under the radio console for a
black object that looked like a gun, and screamed. When Roberts heard the screams, he looked
over at Berg, saw him pull out a gun, and fired his weapon. Roberts and Lane then ran out of the
building and into a taxi and went off to the airport where they caught a plane. Berg was
pronounced dead at the hospital on arrival. Lane was beyond herself upset and did not know
what to do.

On June 6, 2003, law enforcement agencies began to close in on Roberts and his group.
On June 7, 2003, Roberts was cornered in a Portland motel. Roberts, though wounded, managed
to escape. With the help of Dudley, Kemp and Pierce, he drove to Whidbey Island, Washington.

On June 8, 2003, Green went to the F.B.I. and told them everything he knew about
Roberts and about his involvement in the gun robbery scheme. That same day, federal and state
law enforcement agents tracked Roberts and other members of the group to the Island. Roberts
and Pierce burned to death when the house they occupied caught fire during a gun battle with the

federal agents. Before the gun fight, Dudley ran out to the agents and tumed himself in and
started telling them everything he knew about the “Disorder.” Kemp was fatally injured in the
gun fight, and died on the way to the hospital. During the next hours, everyone else involved in
the case was rounded up.

Question #3:

You will recall that we started the year reading a somewhat lengthy excerpt from a book
by Jack Katz called Seductions of Crime: Moral and Sensual Attractions in Doing Evil (New
York: Basic Books 1988). In the book, Katz traces some of the emotional processes that seduce
people into deviance, and makes a fascinating argument about the proper scope of the criminal
law.

We ended the year by talking about mail and wire fraud, under 18 U.S.C. § 1341 and
1343. Many commentators argue that these statutes are broad and, as a result, can catch
practically any type of deception. As Jed Rakoff noted in our readings, federal prosecutors
“always come home to the virtues of 18 U.S.C. § 1341, with its simplicity, adaptability, and
comfortable familiarity.”

Does your analysis of the mail and wire fraud statutes support or undermine the thesis
that Katz develops in the excerpt that we read from his book? In an essay, please address this

specific question. Please identify the thesis that Katz develops and explain precisely how it is
that the mail and wire fraud statutes either support or undermine the thesis.
