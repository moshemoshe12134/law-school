Question 1:

This statute is significantly broader than many of the statutes that currently exist
regarding rape and particularly those studied in this class. In particular, it is far more specific
about acts that can constitute sexual assault offenses than the Model Penal Code (MPC).
Through its definition of sexual intercourse (Section 1301 (3)), it provides protection for a great
number of sexual activities which are not covered by the MPC definition which only extends to
penetration per os or per anum and not to other forms of sexual intercourse. Moreover, though it
is not entirely gender neutral (typically using the pronoun ‘he’ to signify the perpetrator), it is
significantly more neutral than the MPC both in its definition of punishable sexual acts and in the
way that it refers to the victim without use of the pronoun ‘she.’ This goes a long way towards
alleviating some of the recent complaints by commentators who feel that the old rape laws’ use
of gender terms was misleading and potentially under-inclusive. Even beyond the definitions the
statute provides, it offers more broad coverage by providing much more specific provisions for a
variety of different eventualities. In particular, the sections of this statute dealing with sexual
abuse of children (both the specific parts of sections 1301 and 1302 and all of 1303 and 1305),
are much more clearly thought out and presented than similar crimes are in the MPC which
mixes sexual crimes against children with those against adults more completely. This is a strong
point if the goal of the statute is primarily to allow punishment of sexual predators who target
children, which is something that has not been focused on as much by the MPC or even by
Professor Schulhofer’s proposed statute. While this breadth could be a strength, here it is also a
problem since the statute is so broad on the issue of consent that it seems to make illegal many
forms of consensual sex that the MPC would not because of the element of force necessary under
the MPC, which is not clearly included in this statute. It is not clear how a jury would deal with
the consent issue in these cases since it is mentioned only in section 1301 (1)(c)(1) and is not
clearly defined. This could be a strength, allowing for more prosecution of cases where consent
isn’t present but that fact is hard to prove, but it could also end up being a significant source of
confusion.

Specifically with regard to actus reus, this statute allows for punishment of a much wider
range of nonconsensual behavior. While the MPC only defines sexual intercourse as the
including “intercourse per os or per anum, with some penetration however slight; emission is not
required.” (MPC §213.0 (2)), this statute goes much further, including these activities and many
more in its definition of sexual intercourse. Moreover, it is far more specific in each of its
provisions, providing a separate actus reus for most of them and providing specific details of
what constitutes the act in each situation. Far more activities are clearly embraced by this statute
as punishable sexual offenses, and one of its strengths is that it clearly guides the judge or jury
on what is illegal and therefore what should be punished.

In terms of mens rea, this provision is fairly similar to the MPC in that the necessary
mens rea varies from section to section, but is generally less important than the actual lack of
consent on the part of the victim. Most provisions that specify intent use a knowledge standard
saying, for example that the defendant ‘knows’ the victim is unable to consent or understand
what is going on, or that parents of minors must ‘knowingly’ allow adults to engage in conduct
that is an offense under this statute. However, as in the MPC, the only requirement for statutory
rape is that the person be negligent in ascertaining the age of the victim.

In comparison to the Model Rape Statute composed by Professor Schulhofer, this statute
is most notable for its focus on sexual offenses against minors. Professor Schulhofer’s statute,

while it does mention sexual offenses against minors, does not separate this into a separate
section of the code and is not as specific about those types of crimes as this statute is. However,
Professor Schulhofer’s statute is much more specific about how consent should be considered.
While the proposed Illinois statute barely even mentions consent and does not provide a clear
definition of what should be considered either force or consent, Professor Schulhofer’s law is
clearly quite focused on consent and brings it to the forefront of the discussion in section 202
(c)(1-4) (with a particular emphasis on 4 which discusses various forms of coercion). In this
way, Professor Schulhofer’s statute seems to deal with the concerns addressed by Katie Roiphe
in her piece which worried that rape statutes tend to be paternalistic, much more successfully
than does this new Illinois statute with no clear definition of consent. At the same time, this
Illinois statute is stronger than Professor Schulhofer’s because of the broad range of activities
that it allows punishment for including more than just the penetration acts covered under
Professor Schulhofer’s statute which throughout section 201 says penetration. Another key
distinction between the two provisions is that Professor Schulhofer’s statute uses a recklessness
mens rea and therefore allows for arguably broader enforcement, throughout most of his model
statute. Finally, it is important to note that under certain situations, Professor Schulhofer’s
statute would allow for prosecution for rape within a marriage, whereas the proposed Illinois law
seemingly would not.

Probably the most pronounced strength of this newly proposed Illinois statute is that it
does allow for the inclusion of far more offensive behaviors than either the MPC or Professor
Schulhofer’s statute both of which are limited to penetration. This will allow for a more
complete understanding of rape which is a psychologically traumatic experience regardless of
whether or not the sexual act is penetration. Another potential strength of this statute is its many
provisions for the protection of children. While I worry that Section 1305 may be too broad of a
prohibition on activities, particularly in light of the recent debate over how much a sexual
offender’s lawful activities can be curtailed to prevent further offenses, this statute does go a
long way to increasing specificity so that juries will know when to convict people for offenses
against children. Moreover, by increasing specificity it will hopefully deter future sexual
offenses against children.

At the same time, this statute does have some clear problems. Most particularly in its
unclear dealing with the issue of consent throughout the statute could be problematic since all of
the cases we have read on rape show that consent is typically a hotly contested part of the trial.
Also, perhaps the biggest problem with this statute is that it does not allow for rape within
marriage. While this is also true of the MPC, many states have been moving away from this
approach, either for the reasons cited by the court in People v. Liberta or more generally just
because of its clear ties to antiquated ideas of a husband’s property right in his wife. This is a
major weakness of this provision and one which would hopefully be fixed before adoption since
legal thought certainly seems to be moving away from allowing rape within marriage.

Overall, I think the decision of which way to vote depends on a variety of issues and will
come down to which priority is attached to which aspect of the law. The Illinois law is certainly
strong in its handling of offenses against children, and the Schulhofer statute is strong on issues
of consent and marriage rape among other things. Ultimately, I think I would vote for the
Illinois statute both because of its protection of children and because it defines sexual offenses
more broadly than merely penetration, which seems to be a great advantage to this view. I still
have some concerns about the vague nature of its consent provisions which in some situations
might make for unclear decision based on the law and I think that the lack of a clear provision

for rape within marriage is a large (and anachronistic) problem, but I think the strengths of the
statute outweigh these potential problems. Preferably though, I would vote to work on these
aspects of the statute before adopting the Illinois proposal as well.

Question 2:

First I will consider Nancy Lane. As U.S. Attorney, I would want to charge her with the
vandalism, most obviously, probably under MPC 220.3 Criminal Mischief. If I were the
defendant I might try to argue that she did not appreciate the extent of the damage that would be
done, but this is likely to be a clearly losing argument since the prosecutor will simply produce
the wire taps as evidence that she wanted to trash a Starbucks. A second charge of complicity in
the robbery committed by Roberts under MPC Section 2.06 could also be leveled against Lane.
As a defense attorney I would likely respond to this by saying that she did not have the necessary
mens rea under this section 4 of this provision saying that she clearly did not have the necessary
culpability since she specifically stated she did not want to take part in violence and since she
had no idea the robbery would occur (which is supported by both wire tapped conversations).
The prosecutor could likely respond to this by saying that she should have known that the
robbery was going to occur and at very least that a reasonable defendant would have noticed a
gun being drawn during the commission of the crime and so she should be liable. She could
also be charged with criminal conspiracy (MPC 5.03). As defense attorney I would respond that
she did not conspire in the robbery since she had at most agreed to the vandalism and she had
specifically not agreed to the violent element of the crime. However, under the ruling in Diaz
which applied the Pinkerton rule, it is not clear that it matters and the prosecution would likely
respond that this standard should be adopted in which case she will be liable even though she did
not know about the gun. Lane could also be charged with a RICO violation since the group is at
least arguably an enterprise and she is clearly involved in the robbery but is also involved in the
later activities by not withdrawing from the group actively. Her defense attorney would likely
claim that she only took part in one crime, not a pattern, but Neapolitan supports convicting her
regardless of her actual involvement in multiple crimes, and she did not actively withdraw
despite voicing her uncertainty. If successfully charged with RICO, her liability could run to all
of the group’s activities including both the robberies and the final murder, though her defense
attorney would likely argue that the final murder was the action of only Roberts and that
therefore she and the other members of the group lacked the necessary knowledge of it, and all
mens rea, despite the fact that she was present. Even though she was present at the time of the
murder of Berg, it is not clear that she had any idea of the crime, nor does it seem that she had
agreed to murder as a part of her agreement with the group. Because of this, as prosecutor, I
would probably not charge her with the murder unless new evidence came to light. Since she
was merely taking part in a lawful interview at the time, she would not be liable for the murder
through complicity. Also the prosecution would probably note with respect to all of these
charges that if she had been so upset with the outcome and had truly thought that violence was
wrong, she should have come forward after the fact which she did not. Also note that while a
desperate defense attorney for any of these defendants might claim necessity based on their
political views this will almost certainly fail based both on lack of immediacy and
proportionality and also because of the reasoning adopted in State v. Warshow.

Next I will deal with Dudley’s involvement and which charges should be brought against
him. Dudley can most clearly be charged with the robbery of the armored truck. A defense
attorney would have a hard time arguing with a charge of robbery under MPC 222.1, however, it

is unclear from the fact patter whether Dudley actually had a gun or whether he took part in any
of the force and threats necessary for a robbery conviction, so perhaps his lawyer could argue he
did not. However, it seems clear that he had both the necessary mens rea and the necessary actus
reus, so this is unlikely to succeed. Even if he did not actually threaten or harm anyone, as
prosecutor I would argue that he definitely knew of the violent nature of the crime both because
of the previous crime which he had discussed with Lane and because of their long planning
period. I would therefore also charge him with criminal conspiracy (MPC 5.03) and a RICO
violation since he was a part of the group and had actual knowledge of more than one of their
criminal activities. The defense attorney would likely to argue that he only took part in one
activity, but for the purposes of RICO that is irrelevant. Moreover, the case for conspiracy is
clear cut based on the long-term planning alone not to mention the joint commission of the
crime. Under RICO, Dudley would likely be held liable for all of the crimes committed by the
group if he was found liable under RICO at all, though he might not be under criminal
conspiracy if he did not have the necessary purpose for the other crimes even though he knew of
some of them. Again it is not clear if the murder represented Roberts acting alone or not.
Moreover, Dudley could be charged with helping Roberts to escape after the murder was
committed. He would not have much of a defense against this since he did not seem to have
reason to fear for his well being if he had refused to aid him. He would likely be treated more
leniently because he turned himself in, but he did so too late for it to be considered denouncing
the conspiracy to save him from criminal conspiracy or RICO charges.
Green’s role in all of this is very analogous to that of Fortier in the McVeigh-

Nichols case. He was willing to participate, but only up to a point. Because of this the
prosecutor would likely want to charge him with criminal negligence along with his other crimes
and while his attorney would likely defend on the grounds of lack of knowledge, actus reus and
mens rea as Fortier’s did, the charge would probably stick. He could also be charged with
receiving stolen goods under MPC section 223.6. While as defense attorney I would say that he
had not intention to take the stolen firearms, it seems clear that he did know they were stolen and
at very least it seems a reasonable person in his situation would have known they were stolen, so
this argument is unlikely to succeed. As prosecutor I would probably not charge him with
attempted laundering of the checks since it isn’t clear that he took the necessary first step
towards laundering them. It seems that he did nothing with them because he didn’t know how to
launder checks. He would also likely be charged with complicity in the robbery of the firearms
stores since he sold the stolen goods which would likely amount to aiding under MPC 2.06
section (3)(a)(ii). His defense attorney would likely argue that these are two separate offenses,
but the prosecutor would respond that the fact that he knew that the crime was going to take
place in advance combined with the selling of the firearms amounts to aiding. He would
potentially also be charged under RICO as with the other defendants.

Jacobson would likely be charged with complicity in the robberies of the armored cars.
Her defense attorney would likely claim that she did not know that he was going to use the
information for a crime and that therefore she was not complicit. This would be a strong
argument for her since it seems that she only told him details in passing and did not know of his
plans to rob the truck. While she would probably still be charged with complicity, it would come
down to a factual battle over which outcome should win since she didn’t seem to have the
necessary mens rea if she is telling the truth. This is very closely related to the court’s analysis in
Beeman where they found that a case with similarly uncertain facts was an issue for the jury to
decide.

Since Roberts, Pierce and Kemp were all killed, they would not be charged with any of
their crimes. Though they could all have been charged with criminal conspiracy, RICO
violations, escaping arrest, murder (at least in Roberts’ case) and possibly counterfeiting (at least
for Roberts and Pierce), their deaths would preclude this.

Question 3:

Mail and wire fraud statutes including specifically 18 U.S.C. §1341 and 1343 seem to
complement and uphold Jack Katz’ thesis in Seductions of Crime: Moral and Sensual Attractions
in Doing Evil though it is impossible to say whether he will be empirically borne out without
more analysis of the statutes and more time to see their effects. In his book, Katz argues that
people are seduced into committing crimes by what he calls ‘sneaky thrills’ regardless of age or
social class and that these outside factor such as age, race, class or any other number of factors
merely change the ways in which these desires for a sneaky thrill are manifested. He further
argues that almost everyone has these impulses and it is just a matter of whether or not they act
and also whether or not what they do is considered a crime. Specifically he states, “The
attractions of sneaky thrills may not disappear with age, but instead may migrate from
shoplifting to adultery and embezzlement.” (p. 321). He argues that the reason that white collar
crimes are treated so differently is that so many more people do things that could be considered
crimes but simply aren’t. He also argues that if punishment of certain types of crimes that are
considered white collar or effect those with more political power are enforced too heavily,
political power to change them will grow (p. 318-319).

This argument seems to be supported by the mail and wire fraud statutes. Because of
their breadth, they are allowing prosecutors to prosecute a great number of people that would
otherwise not be viewed as deviants within the legal system. These people are, according to
Katz’ analysis, indulging their desire for a sneaky thrill just as much as a person who shoplifts,
this is just the first time that they are being caught. This can be seen most clearly in some of the
wire fraud cases. U.S. v. Morris seems to be an obvious case of a person who had no real
purpose in his actions. Despite his statements that he wanted to improve network security, it is
unclear that this was actually an outcome of his activities, or that he was particularly concerned
that this be the outcome. Katz would argue that in reality he was merely indulging in a sneaky
thrill and that he is the very kind of so-called deviant who would have previously been invisible.
Thus, the seeming breadth of the wire and mail fraud statutes may be in part because so many
more people are engaging in questionable behavior than we previously would have thought.

It may seem that the mere presence of statutes such as §1341 and §1343 undermine his
thesis since he contends that society will never punish the truly elite because if they did the law
would simply be overturned when the pressure became too great (p. 318-319). However, this
may be too hasty an assumption to make. Rather, the prosecutor’s use of these statutes would
have to first be carefully considered. If they are used primarily too broadly catch people who are
clearly and without a doubt criminal and corrupt individuals, it is not clear this is enough to lead
to the necessary outrage that Katz is discussing. Thus, the prosecution of Lopez-Lukis may not
be enough to bring about a clear desire to change the system if it is clear to all involved that her
conduct is far beyond the boundary of legal behavior. Rather it is the behavior at the margins
which is interesting to his analysis. Crime is how we define it according to Katz and therefore it
is important to consider how it is being defined before any judgment of his position can be made.

The statutes do clearly support at least one aspect of Katz’ argument and that is the fact
that almost all individuals and certainly members of almost all groups are tempted by the desire

Professor Name: Professor Harcourt

to get a ‘sneaky thrill.’ Katz argues against the conception of a criminal class, particularly when
it is directly related to a certain class of society, because in reality criminal desires at very least
pervade the different classes and groups of society. Through its prosecution of people in places
of political power and people more generally outside of the stereotype of a criminal these statutes
seem to somewhat uniquely support this view of crime and criminality. Rather than being
confined to the ‘lower’ elements of society, crime has often merely appeared that way because of
a lack of statutes that allowed for the widespread prosecution of corruption and related crimes
that might be classified as at least closer to the white-collar end of the criminal spectrum.
Because of this former under representation of elite elements in the criminal law system, these
statutes serve to highlight at problem that has, by Katz’s analysis, always been there but has for
the most part lurked in the shadows, not directly dealt with by the criminal law system.

The true test of whether or not Katz’ thesis is correct has arguably not come yet. This
will be determined only if prosecutors conscientiously go after even the most powerful and elite
people who commit violations of the mail fraud statute. This will allow for a test of whether in
these situations it will become apparent that elites strive for ‘sneaky thrills’ just as much as
others. Perhaps more importantly, the political response to this increased prosecution will test
his theory that society will not allow tough prosecution of crimes which it sees as less severe and
more threatening to those with political power. The mere fact that the laws have not yet been
overturned may simply mean that the current methods of prosecution are limited to clear-cut and
egregious violations of the law and therefore do not threaten large enough segments of the
population. Ifthe laws were increasingly enforced over a broader range of situations and
therefore threatened the political elite in the manner that Katz’ believes is necessary, the
outcome, whether it be repealing the law or keeping it, would go a long way towards proving or
disproving, as the case may be, Katz’ arguments.

However, regardless of the ultimate outcome, the mail and wire fraud statutes seem to
support Katz’ argument at least to the extent that they prove that there are more ways to seek
“sneaky thrills’ than those conceptualized as crimes in the past. People engage in a wide variety
of behavior which may not be thought optimal and the wire and mail fraud statutes, by picking
up on certain kinds which were not previously recognized, seem to highlight this fact.
Regardless then of the future outcome of prosecution under these statutes, it seems clear that they
prove at least certain aspects of Katz’ analysis.
