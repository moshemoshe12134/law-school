Answer-to-Question-_ 2 _

In Jack Balkin’s “The Crystalline Structure of Legal Thought,” Balkin argues that “legal
thought and legal argument have a crystalline structure. I mean by this not that legal

doctrines have self-replicating structure, but rather that legal arguments that people make
in defense of legal doctrines share a common structure.” Balkin says that legal arguments

frame doctrine in two opposing ideas: (i) individualism, which deemphasizes the


responsibilities and duties of individuals to others in society, and (ii) communalism,

which extends responsibilities and duties individuals owe to others. Because legal
arguments are framed in this way, the arguments for and against a given rule in doctrine
will be similar, and we saw in class that we can catalog the structures. Furthermore,
Balkin proposes that the crystalline structure of legal arguments is important because it
makes it easier to teach law students/easier for law students to grasp legal
arguments/doctrine and it raises important questions about the law that people use to

reason in their legal arguments.

If you asked me 2 months ago whether this matters, I would have said no. I came into this
class thinking that every legal argument should be tailored to a client’s specific facts and
details of their case. Especially in criminal cases, where the defendant’s liberty is at stake,
I thought it was the lawyer’s responsibility to craft individualized legal arguments. I
viewed this as mutually exclusive with the idea of a crystalline structure because, at first,
I perceived the crystalline structure to be a shortcut to deriving a legal argument. What I
came to realize, though, is that the crystalline structure is highly valuable in (1)
anticipating the opposing side’s arugments/counterarguments, (2) drawing connections
between facts and doctrine to build a stronger argument for your client, and (3)
considering how society views the law to frame the legal arugments in a way that will
convince the judge/jury that finding in favor of your client is a just and fair outcome. I
also found that crystalline structures, especially in conjunction with the idea of time-
framing, have been (4) a helpful framework to my understanding of policy underlying
certain doctrines and legal arguments in my other classes outside of the criminal law

context.

We discussed crystalline structures on numerous occassions in class, but the three
examples I found most helpful to my understanding were (i) premeditation, exemplified
by Guthrieand Carroll; (ii) causation in the context of Arzon and Acosta; (ili) conspiracy,
exemplified by Lauria.

(i)Premeditation

In our discussion of premeditation, we read two cases that illustrate the crystalline


structure: Guthrieand Carroll. Carrollheld that premeditation can be formed in the

moment. Intent to kill can be inferred from intentionally pulling the trigger of a gun, and
this satisfies premeditation. This decision is friendly to the prosecution. Here we see
narrow time-framing: the jury need only consider what the defendant was thinking in the
moment that he pulled the trigger to infer premeditation. Using Balkin’s dyads, this
understanding of premeditation as intent is communalist and emphasizes and expands the
responsibilities that defendant owes to others. Guthrie, on the other hand, held that
premeditation requires time for reflection. This is more friendly to the defense and
employs a broader time-frame, wherein the defendant has to form intent to kill and have a
moment of reflection prior to carrying out the act. Using Balkin’s dyads, this
understanding of premeditation is individualist, as it focuses more on the defendant’s

right to self-determination than on the defendant’s responsibilities to others in society.

Understanding the crystalline structure in the examples of Guthrieand Carrollreveals the
arguments that the defense and prosecution are likely to make. It also enables drawing
connections between an instant case and these cases. These go hand-in-hand. For
example, defense understands that prosecution will be arguing that intent is
premeditation, so defense must employ a broader time frame and argue that, without a
moment of reflection, there is no premeditation. Both sides will root their arguments in
policy underpinnings or reflections of society’s values to convince the judge or jury that
finding in favor of their client is just. For defense, this will mean emphasizing the
defendant’s right to self-determination and minimized moral blameworthiness for a spur-
of-the-moment decision; for prosecution, this will mean emphasizing the defendant’s
responsibility to society. The framework of crystalline structures is crucial for arriving at

these legal arguments and framing them most effectively for each side.

(i1)Causation

In discussing causation, we read Acostaand Arzon. Acostafound but-for and proximate
causation using a broad understanding of causation. The defense could argue that the

helicopter crash was unforeseeable and unimaginable for Acosta when he engaged in the


car chase. Also, the pilot performed a maneuver that was not difficult and not affected by

ground activity, per an expert witness. This seems to be an individualist argument, that
Acosta did not have moral blameworthiness for the pilot’s manuever. However,
prosecution, employing a communalist approach, argued that but for Acosta engaging in a
police chase, the helicopter would never have been in the position to crash, and the crash
was a possible consequence which “might reasonably have been contemplated.” This is
communalism because it emphasizes Acosta’s responsibility to others, namely, the
helicopter pilot by putting the pilot in a dangerous position in the first place. In Arzon, the
court found that the firefighter’s death was a foreseeable consequence of Arzon setting
fire to the building, despite a second, independent fire trapping the firefighter in thick
smoke. Defense argues that the second fire, which Arzon did not set, was the cause, but
prosection argues that, but for Arzon’s fire, firefighters would not have responded to the
scene early and been in a vulnerable position when the second fire started. Prosecution,
once again, employs communalism, emphasizing Arzon’s responsibilities to society,
whereas defense employs individualism, emphasizing that Arzon is not morally
blameworthy for the firefighter’s death because is he was not responsible for the second

fire, which caused the thick smoke and particularly unsafe conditions.

As with the example of premeditation, understanding the crystalline structures in Acosta
and Arzonilluminate the arguments that the opposing side will make, draw connections
between facts of a new case with these legal arguments and doctrines, and ground
arguments in terms that will convince the judge or jury that finding in favor of your side

is a just outcome.

As a matter of my own learning, the crystalline structures helped me better understand the
doctrine of foreseeability as it relates to causation in Palsgraf. Palsgrafis a case we read
in Torts last semester, and it was cited by the dissent in Acostafor the notion that, under
Palsgraf s conception of a foreseeable victim, the helicopter pilot was not a foreseeable
victim for whom Acosta should be criminally liable. Now that I understand the crystalline
structures, I can see how the argument in Pa/sgrafwas rooted in individualism,
deemphasizing the railroad employee’s responsibility to Palsgraf, as she was an
unforeseeable victim standing far down the train tracks. Though there are different

standards between criminal and civil liability, revisiting the outcome in Palsgrafthrough


the lens of crystalline structures helped me anticipate both sides’ arguments in Acostaand

Arzon, draw connections between the facts of those cases and the facts of Palsgrafas it
applies to the doctrines of causation, intervening causes, and foreseeability, and form my
own sense of justice and fairness in the outcome of the cases. (Personally, I find the
individualist argument more compelling in Acostaand the communalist argument more
compelling in Arzonbecause I think the outcome of the firefighter’s death in Arzonwas

foreseeable, but the helicopter crash was not in Acosta.)

(i1i)Conspiracy

In our class discussion of conspiracy, we discussed Lauria, wherein the court found
insufficient proof of the answering service owner’s participation in a conspiracy to further
prostitution. The decision cites two other cases-- Direct Sales v. USand US v. Falcone--
which inform the crystalline structure in Lauria. Direct Salesheld that a drug wholesaler
who provided drugs to a doctor who was overprescribing to addicted patients was liable
as a co-conspirator. This sounds like a communalist argument: the wholesaler has a
responsibility to any potential consumers of their drugs because they are dangerous.
Falconeheld that sugar and yeast wholesalers were not liable as co-conspirators for
providing excessive amounts of sugar and yeast to someone making moonshine because
they did not know/should not have reasonably been expected to know that moonshine
was being made. This sounds like an individualist argument: the providers of sugar and
yeast, because their products are inocuous, should not have a responsibility or assumption
of blameworthiness if their otherwise safe products are used in an unsafe or illegal
manner. Mapping the crystalline structures in Falconeand Direct Salesgives us the
prosection’s and defense’s arguments in Lauria. That is, the prosecution argues that
commercial sex is more like a drug than it is like sugar, and the defense argues that
Lauria is not a purveyor of commercial sex as in a distributor of drugs. Immediately, we
see the individualism and communalism inherent in these arguments by drawing
comparisons between the facts in light of the doctrine and can anticipate the other side’s

arguments. We can frame our arguments in a way that conveys justice and fairness by


emphasizing or distinguishing moral rights from wrongs based on societal beliefs.

Conclusion:These examples demonstrate why, despite my initial hesitation, I’ve come to
appreciate crystalline structures as an important tool for anticipating the other side’s
arguments, building a stronger case for my side, and framing the arguments in a way that
convinces the jury/judge that finding for my side is a fair and just outcome. As Prof
Harcourt told us, crystalline structures can be mapped across all areas of law as a learning
tool, illustrated by my example from Torts.
