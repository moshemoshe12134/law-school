Question 1

A child died of measles in the current Texas/New Mexico outbreak after not being vaccinated. This
raises complicated issues of “but for” causation, duty of care for omission liability, mens rea, and
mitigation.

It is unlikely that the investigation will lead to a criminal prosecution. Your memo should
immediately address these most important issues of “but for” causation, duty of care for omission
liability, wens rea, and mitigation.

Here is an outline of what it should say:

Memo to Judge Therwhanger:
It is unlikely that the investigation into the death of Kris Jordan will lead to any criminal charges.

The main obstacle is “but for” causation, which is rarely ever an issue in criminal cases, but here
surprisingly would likely prevent criminal prosecution of the parents under omission liability. The
measles vaccine is not 100% effective, but about 97% effective in preventing measles. That means
that there is a small chance of catching measles even if vaccinated, and in rare cases vaccinated
children have died from measles-related illnesses. As a result, it is not certain beyond a reasonable
doubt that but for vaccination, Kris Jordan would have died. It is likely, but likely not beyond a
reasonable doubt.

It is also not clear that there is “proximate” or “legal causation,” because the national vaccination
rate is not back at 95% since COVID and therefore, there are likely going to be outbreaks. Although
the Mennonite community in Gaines County, Texas, is bringing the vaccination rate down to 82%,
which is really low, the rest of the nation is not in a much better situation. The facts indicate
that “for every 1,000 children who get measles, one or two will die, according to the C.D.C. The
virus also harms immune defenses, leaving the body vulnerable to other pathogens.” Catching
measles can be dangerous. “About 40 percent of people infected last year were hospitalized,
according to the C.D.C.” It is therefore likely that measles outbreaks are going to happen now that
the rates are below 95% nationally, and it seems excessive to place homicide liability on parents
whose children have died. This would entail policy questions about the deterrent effect of criminal
prosecutions against parents and other theories of punishment.

The only individuals who might be criminally responsible are the parents of Kris Jordan, Mary and
Peter Jordan, because this situation would only give rise only omission liability, and so there needs


to be a duty of care imposed on the accused. A duty of care generally arises under four
citcumstances, one of which is a patental relationship. So the duty exists for the parents, but it
does not exist for theit minister or for the Secretary of Health. As per the Shirley Greene case,
the other three bases for imposing a duty of care—by statute; by contract; or by secluding a
helpless person—are not present. Accordingly, only Mary and Peter Jordan could potentially be
responsible for the death of their child. No need to discuss RFK or ministers because no duty of
care.

In terms of mens tea, the parents would likely satisfy either the ordinary civil negligence standard
(deviation from standard of care) or criminal negligence standard (gross deviation of standard of
cate), and so the level of culpability under the Texas statute (MPC) could be negligent homicide if
there were no “but for” causation problems. Given how effective the MMR vaccine is, it seems that
an ordinary juror would find that it is unreasonable not to vaccinate one’s child.

Whether the parents might satisfy the recklessness standard will turn on whether they were
subjectively aware of the substantial risk that they were taking and consciously decided to disregard
that risk. Here we would need mote factual evidence about their awareness of the risk.

The closest case to these facts that I know of is State v. Williams, which involved the death of a
baby as a result of a gangrenous tooth infection. In that case, the parents were held criminally
responsible under a negligent homicide state in the State of Washington that used a civil negligence
standard. It is useful to compare the two cases.

The two cases are similar insofar as they both address a parent’s medical decision-making in a
situation of omission liability. They are dissimilar insofar as the Wi/iams parents were not refusing
to obtain recommended treatment or vaccines against a serious condition; they thought their child
had a minor condition and failed to bring him to the doctor quickly enough when it escalated.

In Williams, there were serious mitigating circumstances regarding the parents, even though that
did not help them: In Williams, the Native American tribal membership and the shameful history of
child separation for native children helps explain why the couple did not take the baby to the doctor,
even if the court found it was “unreasonable” under the simple negligence standard. Also, in
Williams, the parents’ low-income and low level of education is key to understanding their actions
and to a nuanced discussion of problems with the “reasonableness” standard. Here, there are no
similar issues. As a result, one could argue that there is /ess justification for denying medical
intervention (anti-vaxxers) than in Walliams (child separation). If so, then it seems that the parents
here would be more, not less likely to be found responsible in a negligent homicide by omission
prosecution.

But overall, in conclusion, the main problem is that the issue of “but for” causation plays out
differently here than in Walliams. If the vaccine for measles is only 97% effective, then the defense
could compellingly argue that even with vaccination the child could possibly have caught the disease
and possibly died. Also, the rates of national vaccination are below the 95% threshold necessary to
prevent measles outbreaks, so this could now happen anywhere in the country.

It might be productive to discuss hypothetical comparison cases: What about parents who do not
put their children in a car seat and have an accident? It might also be helpful to discuss theories of
punishment and see how they militate in a case like this against parents.

Note that the case may raise constitutional right to free exercise questions, but we did not study
those, so I set that question aside. Incidentally, Wiliams is sometimes thought of as raising religious


objections and faith healing, but that is based on assumptions about Native families vs. Western
medicine. But that is not what the parents claimed in Walliams.

Similarly, the case may present the situation of endangerment. It is possible that the parents or the
minister could be charged with reckless endangerment of the child. But we did not study that, so I
do not expect students to discuss this.

I did not find that any of the answers written to the exam serve as good models, so I think you
should use this memo as your sample answer

Question #2

I have attached a sample answer for Question #2.
