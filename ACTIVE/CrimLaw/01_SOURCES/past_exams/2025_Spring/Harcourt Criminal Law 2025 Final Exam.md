Final Examination

This is an open-book, off-line, three (3) hour examination. It is open-book so you
may refer to your notes, your computer files, and the casebook. You may not consult the
Internet or artificial intelligence (AI). The exam software will disable the Internet, so you
will not have access to on-line resources. Do not use any artificial intelligence (AI)
technology. You should not talk to or confer with anyone else. To repeat, you may not
speak or consult in any way with any other human being (live or artificial) during the exam
and you must not discuss the exam afterwards with anyone who has not taken it yet.

This examination consists of 6 pages total (including the cover sheet).

This examination consists of two questions that will be graded evenly (50% and
50%). You should spend 90 minutes on each question since they will be weighed equally
toward the final grade.

It is anticipated that you can respond to each question with no more than 1,500
words, for a total of 3,000 words on the exam. You may not exceed 3,000 words for the
total exam.

You may answer the questions in any order that suits you. Please note clearly the
question that you are responding to and leave a page break or several carriage spaces
between your answers to the two questions.

Good luck on the exam and have a great summer when you are done with exams.

Question 1

You are a clerk to the Honorable Taylor Therwhanger of the Gaines County Court
in the State of Texas, located in Seminole, Texas, in the Western part of the state. The judge
just received a call from the District Attorney, Philip Mack Furlow, in which the District
Attorney told them that they were launching an investigation into the death of a child
named Kris Jordan. Judge Therwhanger asks you to find anything you can about the case,
and you have only found this newspaper article in the local paper:

Unvaccinated Child Dies of Measles in Texas Outbreak — Feb. 26, 2025

A child has died of measles in West Texas, the first known death in an outbreak
that is spreading in the region and in neighboring New Mexico, state health officials said
on Wednesday.

The child, Kris Jordan, was an unvaccinated school-age child, according to officials
in Lubbock, Texas, and the Department of State Health Services.

The outbreak comes amid growing concerns among public health experts about
declining vaccination rates and the confirmation of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent
vaccine skeptic, as the nation’s health secretary.

At a meeting of cabinet officials at the White House on Wednesday, Mr. Kennedy
downplayed the news, saying that federal health officials were “watching” the outbreak
and noting that there had been others this year. “So it’s not unusual,” he said. He did not
mention vaccination or describe steps the federal government might be taking to help stop
the outbreak.

In “The Measles Book,” published by Children’s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine
nonprofit he founded, Mr. Kennedy wrote that “measles outbreaks have been fabricated to
create fear,” leading government officials to “inflict unnecessary and risky vaccines on
millions of children for the sole purpose of fattening industry profits.”

As of Feb. 20, there had been three measles outbreaks in the United States this year
and 16 last year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The
outbreaks last year totaled 285 cases; this year’s tally so far is nearly half that.

Some experts objected to describing the outbreak as nothing unusual.

“Every single outbreak, illness, hospitalization and death is a tragedy, because it is

D

entirely preventable with those vaccines,” said Dr. David Higgins, a pediatrician and

preventive medicine expert at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.

“Right now, what we need to be doing as a nation is rebuilding and building
confidence in one of the greatest public health tools ever created,” he said.

Others cautioned against using last year’s outbreaks as a benchmark, noting that
vaccination rates were already eroded then. “This is not normal,” said Dr. Cameron Wolfe,
an infectious-disease expert at Duke University.

At least 124 cases of measles have been identified in Texas since late January,
mostly among children and teenagers who were unvaccinated or whose vaccination status
was unknown, Texas health officials said.

Eighteen have been hospitalized. This measles outbreak is the state’s largest in
more than 30 years, said Katherine Wells, the director of public health in Lubbock, Texas.

Measles is a highly contagious respiratory illness that can be life-threatening to
anyone who is not protected against the virus.

Doctors say the best way to protect against the disease is with two doses of a
vaccine, which is usually administered to children as a combination measles-mumps-
rubella, or M.M.R., vaccine. Two doses of the M.M.R. vaccine prevent more than 97
percent of measles infections.

Most of the cases have been centered in Gaines County, an area on the western edge
of the state. It is home to thousands of Mennonites, an insular Christian group that
historically has had lower vaccination rates. Officials said the child who died Wednesday,
Kris Jordan, had lived in Gaines County with their parents, Mary and Peter Jordan, who
are Mennonites and attend the Sommerfeld Mennonite Church.

Mennonites are part of the wider Anabaptist family of churches, which emerged in
1525 as the radical wing of the Protestant Reformation in Central Europe. Other Anabaptist
branches today include the Amish, Brethren, and Hutterites. Anabaptists believe that a true
biblical church has to follow such principles as non-violence, unconditional forgiveness,
adult baptism, church discipline, and a refusal to bear arms or swear oaths.

Many North American Mennonites trace their roots to immigration directly from
Germany in the 18th and 19th centuries. In contrast, the Seminole area includes a
community of Old Colony Mennonites, which has a much more circuitous history of
migration. Old Colony Mennonites migrated first to the Russian Empire, then to Canada,
then to Mexico, fleeing government pressures to assimilate. As economic conditions

deteriorated in Mexico, some moved to such areas as Gaines County and other
communities in Texas and nearby states in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. All along, they
have preserved their Low German dialect and other cultural distinctions.

The population of Old Colony Mennonites is high in Gaines County because of the
large influx of German settlers from Mexico and Canada. The ministers, known as elders,
in the Mennonite churches in Gaines County, including the New Life Mennonite Church,
the Community Church of Seminole, and the Sommerfeld Mennonite Church, advocate
against vaccines.

Last year, roughly 82 percent of the Gaines County’s population had received the
M.M.R. vaccine. Experts say that at least 95 percent of people in a community need to be
vaccinated in order to stave off outbreaks.

Public health officials believe the outbreak started in this community but has since
fanned out to surrounding counties, where childhood vaccination rates lag significantly
behind federal targets.

The national immunization rate for measles, which fell during the Covid-19
pandemic, has not rebounded to the 95 percent required to stem the spread of measles in a
community.

Just under 93 percent of children in kindergarten had the vaccine for measles,
mumps and rubella in the 2023-24 school year, according to the C.D.C. Anti-vaccine
campaigns have often targeted the M.M.R. vaccine.

“What’s most alarming to me is that we are seeing decreases in measles vaccination
rates, especially in specific communities,” Dr. Higgins said. “And measles is so incredibly
contagious that it spreads like wildfire when it gets into a community with a very low
vaccination rate.”

The measles virus can linger in the air for up to two hours after an infected person
has left the room. Each infected person can spread the virus to as many as 18 others.

The virus spreads when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. Within a
week or two of being exposed, those who are infected may develop a high fever, cough,
runny nose and red, watery eyes.

Within a few days, a telltale rash breaks out as flat, red spots on the face and then

spreads down the neck and torso to the rest of the body.

In most cases, these symptoms resolve in a few weeks. But in rare cases, the virus
causes pneumonia, making it difficult for patients, but especially children, to get oxygen

into their lungs, or brain swelling, which can cause lasting problems, like blindness,
deafness and intellectual disabilities.

For every 1,000 children who get measles, one or two will die, according to the
C.D.C. The virus also harms immune defenses, leaving the body vulnerable to other
pathogens.

A 2015 study estimated that before widespread vaccination, measles may have
accounted for as many as half of all infectious-disease deaths in children. Even now, the
consequences can be serious. About 40 percent of people infected last year were
hospitalized, according to the C.D.C.

Texas health officials have been encouraging people to get the M.M.R. vaccine
with some success. Since Lubbock started holding clinics two weeks ago, health workers
have vaccinated roughly 100 more people than they normally would, though attendance
dwindled in the last two days.

OR OK

Judge Therwhanger has asked you to draft a memo explaining whether any criminal
charges might result from the investigation and if so, who, what, and what likelihood would
a prosecution have of succeeding. Judge Therwhanger would like you to identify who, if
anyone, might be charged with an offense, and what offense that would be. Judge
Therwhanger asks you to identify the strongest arguments for the prosecution and for the
defense, and to indicate who has the strongest argument. Please indicate how you think the
judge would likely want to proceed.

The State of Texas has adopted the Model Penal Code in its entirety.

Question 2

During our classroom discussions, there were many times when I said “This is
another example of the crystalline structure of legal thought.”

Who cares? Why does that matter? Does it matter?

Please write an essay and tell me what you think. You need not take the view that
it does matter, by the way. Either way, tell me why it does or does not matter. And please
try to come up with three strong reasons why it does matter, if you think it does, or it does
not matter, if you do not.

Please include in your answer a discussion of at least three examples of when I said
“This is another example of the crystalline structure of legal thought.” Please use those
three examples to help illustrate your argument.
