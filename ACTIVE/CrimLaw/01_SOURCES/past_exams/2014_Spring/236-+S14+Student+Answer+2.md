Question 1:
1. Charges:

D and J could be charged as being accomplices in murder
in the second degree of Officer Giorgio. They got in the
vehicle with T to escape the scene of the crime, and it
would be hard to prove that they had the mans rea of
directly intending to hurt the officer, as they probably were
just trying to escape the scene. If this intention could be
proven, however, through testimony or otherwise, then
they could be charged with being acomplices in murder in
the first degree. They obviously knew or should've known
that he was a police officer because he was in their pursuit
in uniform. It is also highly likely that a jury will find that
they were getting in the car to escape. Causation is also
clear under the MPC 2.03 because but for them getting in
the vehicle to escape the scene, officer giorgio would not
have been hit and would not have been killed. All of the
elements of this crime are satisfied. They are accomplices
under Rule 2.06 of the MPC bc they werre acting with the
kind of culpability sufficient for commission of the offense
on their own (either of them could've been driving the car
for all intents and purposes).

D and J could also be charged as being accomplices of
murder in the second degree of Migden, Turner, Rosebud
and for attempted murder in the second degree of
Roberts. Although they did not fire any of the shots that


killed these individuals, it could be argued that they
handed the gun to Turner in a way that satisfies the
complicity requirements under MPC 2.06(3). Turner was
shooting with the intent of killing the police officers, so the
mens rea is satisfied and is transfered to them through
complicity. Even if this could not be shown, they would
likely be found to be accomplices under MPC 2.06 (2)(a)
because their drug deal and mutual escape is a form of
offense that cuases innocent or irresponsible person
(Turner) to engage in such conduct (shooting to kill). The
Actus Reas requirement is also satisfied for this offense
because Turner had the intention to kill when he shot. His
defense lawyers could argue that Turner's intention was to
kill the police officers and not M, T or R, which would
bump the mens rea requirement down to recklessness
and could reduce the charge to manslaughter in the
second degree. Causation is clear here under MPC
2.03(1) because the shots are a but-for cause of the
deaths. They could only be charged with attempted
second degree murder for Roberts because the MPC
5.01(b) because they acted with the kind of culpabilty
(recklessness) otherwise required for the purpose of
ending the life of Roberts. They only reason she was not
killed by the bullet is because she was lucky. A bullet
wound is always considered fatal, especially when its in
the back where the central nervous system is and where it
can cause a lot of damage. This is also attempted murder
and not manslaugher because they were in the course of
escaping when this happened.

D and J could also be charges as being accomplices for


aggravated second degree murder of Officer Cornell.
Again, although they did not fire the shot that killed him, it
could be argued that they handed the gun to Turner ina
way that satisfies the complicity requirements under MPC
2.06(3). Even if this was not the case, they would certainly
be found to be accomplices under MPC 2.06(2)(a)
becuase they acted with the kind of culpability sufficient for
commission of the offense and caused irresponsible
person to engage in such conduct. Section MPC 2.06(4)
also applies because this is a result crime. Turner was
shooting with the intent of killing the police officers, so the
mens rea is satisfied and is transfered to them through
complcity under MPC 2.06(4) because if you aid someone
in an escape, and there is a death that happens during
that escape, the mens rea is applied to the result (usually
recklessness). The Actus Reas requirement is also
satisfied for this offense because Turner had the intention
to kill officer Cornell when he shot. He was trying to shoot
all the officers so he could escape. There was clearly an
intent to kill here and that is why this is murder in the
second degree. It becomes aggravated by the fact that the
victim is a police officer. Causation is clear here under
MPC 2.03(1) because the shot is a but-for cause of the
officer's death.

D, J and M could be charged with criminally negligent
homicide for the death of Staples. This is because their
criminally negligent behavior (selling drugs, robbing and
escaping) caused him to come out of his apartment and
fall off his balcony. However, there is a real problem with
causation here under the MPC 2.03(3) rule of causation.


They are going to argue that there is no way that they
could've forseen that a crime reporter lived in the building
next to the dark alley where they ended up. They are going
to argue that his death was not caused by their actions
because it was too remote and accidental. They did not
expect anyone to come out of the safety of their apartment
when the sirens are blasting and a crime is taking place,
much less to put themselves in such a dangerous position
so that they could fall out of their balcony. This only
happened because it was an unforeseeable coincidence
that this man is a crime reporter and happened to live
nearby. They didn't even foresee that there was going to
be a pursuit, much less that they would end up in this dark
alley full of innocent bystanders. However, we can argue
that the risk of innocent bystanders was within the the risk
that they should've been aware of. They were in an urban
residential area being pursued by the police, it would be
unreasonable not to expect bystanders to be around and
even possibly that they would put themelves in danger
because they are nosy.

Joseph and Rosebud: Conspiracy maybe? Expand if |
have time.

Dande and Turner: Conspiracy maybe? Expand if | have
time.

2. Defenses:

T could bring an insanity defense for his severe PTSD. He
would argue that under the MPC 2.09(1) he is not
responsible for criminal conduct because as a result of this


disease (assuming PTSD is found by the court and jury to
be a real disease) he lacks the capacity to appreciate the
criminality of his conduct. Thinking that he was involved in
a combat situation in the Depak Valley in Afghanistan
would perfectly fit this defense. What is odd, however, is
that he was originally buying drugs and punched the other
man in the back of the car, which is an action that would
be hard to argue he was not aware of doing because of
his PTSD. The of his disease such as the diagnoisis and
testimony from the clinical professionals is admissible
under MPC 4.0(1). However, the court has a third option
outside of either finding him guilty or innocent, they can
simply say that he is guilty but mentally ill which would
allow them to retain the same sentencing authority it
would've had with a guilty verdict. Turner is dead though,
so his insanity defense is NOT transferable to the two or
three defendants that are still alive and that will be
responding in court for the multiple deaths discussed
above.

J could also bring an insanity defense similar but perhaps
less convincing than T's. He can argue that under MPC
2.09(1) his mental retardation (or borderline such)
impedes him from 1. recognizing what he was doing and
2. conform his conduct to the requirements of law. This is
a difficult case to make, and depending on the court and
jury it might be convincing or not. Perhaps if the evidence
introduced under MPC 4.0(1) and (2) is convincing
enough, he might be able show that he was unable to
resist acting criminally. This defense might be enhanced if
he is able to also bring up a defense under MPC 2.09 of


duress arguing that R was influencing him with possible
coercion and that because he was cognitively impaired he
could not resist the influence. In order for this to work,
however, he must present evidence of true coercion under
2.09(1) to such a degree that he could not resist.

Duress for Joseph.
3. Outcome:

| believe we have a good chance at convicting D and
maybe M but J will be harder due to his defenses.

Question 2:

Kelman's analysis of the time framing issue is very helpful
when we try to understand how Z was acquitted, not only
legally but also from a political standpoint that can
consider the role that race and class played in the court's
decision to apply one time frame over another.

Following Moore's understanding of what constitutes a
crime, the moment when Z shot TVM was incomplete. The
jury acquitted Z because they found that in the split
second when he pulled the trigger (assuming he pulled the
trigger), he was in the midst of an altercation with TVM
and thus was acting in self defense. In other words, if we
take a very narrow understanding of the time frame, then
the act requirement was satisifed (shooting a gun), the
causation element was satisfied (the shot killed TVM),
BUT the mens rea requirement was NOT satisfied
because Z was not acting purposely, recklessly, knowingly


or negligently (or so the jury found). The court found that
his actions were justified because his mens rea was "| am
in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury and |
am therefore justified in using deadly force to defend
myself." Kelman addresses this very type of situations
where "often, conduct is deemed involuntary (or
determined) rather than freely willed (or intentional)
because we do not consider the defendant's earlier
decisions that may have put him in the position of
apparent choicelessness" (Kelman, 594). By limiting the
time frame to the very moment when the shot occurred,
the court is limiting the jury's ability to find Z liable for
putting himself in that position.

Had the court considered a different, broader, time frame,
perhaps the jury might've been able to see that Z was
liable for creating a dangerous situation that led to the
death of TVM. After all, he did engage in many conducts
that could satisfy the mens rea requirement for homicide,
or at least strongly challenge his argument for self
defense. For example, it was Z who was carrying the gun,
so we could argue that he was thinking about the possibily
(however remote) that he might have to use it at some
point. At least he had the burden to make sure it wasn't
fired negligently to kill someone else. It was Z who began
the altercation by getting out of his car, following TVM, and
walking up to him. All of these actions were taken despite
the fact that the 911 dispatcher had already asked him
NOT to do that. Isn't that negligent? One could argue
those actions were at least reckless, if not probative of a
knowing and purposeful intent. Z was allowed to claim self


defense even though he was the one that created the
situation where the crime took place! This would've been
harder to do under a broader time frame because all of the
aforementioned facts would've given traction to a slew of
arguments in favor of Z's liabiilty.

The court presented their decision to use this narrow time
frame as simply following a natural, unavoidable, logical
and rational rule. A narrow time frame is simply part of
"properly arguinig the case." In other words, they justified
their choice of a narrow time frame as being the most
"relevant" and "appropriate" category to use. But this
assumption is challenged by Kelman who points out that
courts and legal academics/professionals "neither frame
time the same way in all criminal law settings nor do we
ever explain why we use one time frame or another."
(Kelman 593). This suggests that there is something more
to this decision, that it is not simply a proper application of
"the law." What is very powerful about the work of Kelman
and other critical theorists is that they question the
normative assumption of these decisisons' supposed
inherent legitimacy, and expose the myth behind the
notion that using a particular time frame is the only correct
course of action. Kelman would contend (and | would
completely agree) that choosing a time frame is a
deliberate choice between two equally legitimate, valid,
"legal," options. This choice is political; it is an exercise of
power that can greatly influence the outcome of a case.
The result in the Z case is a perfect example of this.

Kelman also delves into how courts make these political


choices in a process called "rational rhetoricism," where
they "present the legal conclusions that result when
interpretive constructs are applied to the facts" (Kelman,
592). According to Kelman, the outcomes of this process
are often driven and determined by concious or
unconcious biases on the part of the courts and juries. |
think this analysis is particularly relevant when we analyze
the role that race played in the outcome of the Z case. In
honor of full disclosure, | must recognize that my own
biases lead me to believe that the court chose a narrow
time frame because it wanted to protect (conciously or
unconciously) the white (or half-white, white-acting,
watever), middle-class, older defendant. The court must've
been aware that this narrow time frame would enable Z to
effectively bring up the self-defense claim and would
silence other facts that could point to his culpability.
Conversely, the narrow time frame tied the hands of the
prosecution, and placed the young, African American
victim at a disadvantage in making his case. He was not
able to effectively argue that he was unarmed, that he was
followed and pestered, and that he was defending himself
against an armed man that came up to harrass him ona
rainy day, feet away from the safety and sanctity of his
own home. Was this because the court was led by a white
judge, with a predominantly white jury in a predominantly
white county? | would argue that it was.

When the verdict came out in the Zimmerman case, a
large portion of the country was outraged, disappointed
and confused (myself included). The case was a sad
representation of how race relations in America often


produce unequal outcomes where racial minorities always
come out at the bottom. At the time | did not understand
how it was possible for a court and a jury to have found Z
"not guilty." The media was not restricted by a "narrow
time frame" and was able to show the bigger picture,
including all of the aforementioned facts that were not
considered in the court's deliberations. As an ignorant
bystander with little knowledge of the "rational rhetoricism"
of the law, there was something that felt visceraly unjust
about the outcome, regardless of the fact that the court
was heralding it as fair and in accordance with due
process. What has been useful (and enlightening) about
reading Kelman's work on time framing, is that it has
provided a tangible example of how bias (and | would
argue in this case racial bias) could permeate the legal
reasoning of a court in ways that determine outcomes one
way or the other.
