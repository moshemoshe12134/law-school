QUESTION |

Charge McNeil, Dander and Joseph with Conspiracy to Commit Drug Trafficking

| would charge the three surviving participants in this incident -- McNeil, Dander and
Joseph -- with conspiracy to commit drug trafficking. Based on Turner's behavior in the
alley -- grabbing the gun from Joseph's or Rosebud's waistband, as if he had conspired
with them -- it is reasonable to charge the intended sellers and buyers of the drugs as
one conspiracy. | bring this charge up first, before any of the charges related to the
dead/wounded victims of the incident, because of the prosecutorial advantages of
conspiracy liability. However, the MPC does not follow the Pinkerton rule, so the
conspiracy won't automatically lead to liability for all actions by co-conspirators (all
discussed below under a traditional accomplice liability theory).

McNeil will likely argue that she was not in a conspiracy because she lacked an
agreement with the others. Joseph and Rosebud were mere acquaintances she had
met the night before and she was not aware of their association with her buyers.
However, the charge is a conspiracy to commit drug trafficking, not to commit theft or
homicide. McNeil had an agreement to sell drugs to T and D, and an agreement that J
and R would help her. Even if McNeil can raise doubts as to her awareness of Joseph's
allegiance with Dander and Turner, that would not eliminate the conspiracy. No overt
act will be required, because drug trafficking is a felony (MPC 5.03(5)), so that would
not be a defense.

Charge Dander and Joseph with First Degree Murder for Cornell's Death

| would charge Dander and Joseph, but not McNeil, with first degree murder on an
accomplice liability theory for Turner's intentionally shooting Officer Cornell. | would not
charge McNeil because | do not think | could prove she was Turner's accomplice. MPC
2.06(4) requires the same mens rea as for the commission of the offense, in this case,
intent (purpose). Since McNeil was not in allegiance with Turner like Dander and
Joseph were with regard to the handoff of the gun, and she did not expect a gunfight, |
do not think | could possibly argue she had the same intent as to shooting cops.

Dander and Joseph will argue that Turner was under the influence of EED at the time of
the shooting, given his PTSD, so the charge should be mitigated to first degree
aggravated manslaughter. The prosecution would counter that the EED was not
reasonable. | think the defense would win based on the language of the statute -- if
Turner believed he was in combat in Afghanistan, then his shooting wildly at the
"enemy" was reasonable.

As an alternative mitigation, Dander and Joseph will argue that Turner did not intend to
kill Cornell, but only to cause him bodily serious harm. But the use of a deadly weapon
against the body can lead to an inference of the intent to kill, so this defense would fail.

Dander and Joseph will argue that like McNeil, they were not accomplices to this crime


because they did not have purpose toward the commission of the offense. | think the
defense will win because the MPC imposes a stricter mens rea standard than Luparello.
Joseph's borderline mental retardation will make his purpose extremely difficult to prove.
Even if mitigated to manslaughter, it would he hard to show he was aware of /
disregarded the risk, so he may be innocent entirely with regard to Cornell's death. For
Dander, unless there is evidence that he harbored a hatred of the police, purpose will
be hard to show. But if the charge were mitigated, the prosecution would be able show
he was reckless as to this potential result, given his involvement with Turner.

Charge Dander and Joseph with Aggravated First Degree Manslaughter for Giorgio's
Death

| would charge D&J, but not M, with aggravated first degree manslaughter on an
accomplice liability theory for Rosebud's running over Officer Giorgio. | would not
charge them with aggravated second degree murder because | do not think | could
prove Rosebud intended to kill Giorgio. | would not charge McNeil because she was not
in the car so could not have had purpose toward the commission of this crime.

Dander and Joseph will argue that Rosebud did not intend to cause bodily harm to
Giorgio, but instead acted recklessly, disregarding the risk of such harm, so the charge
should be mitigated to second degree aggravated manslaughter. The prosecution would
counter that Rosebud intended to escape the alley, and in order to do so, he
purposefully knocked Giorgio out of his way by backing into him. | think the prosecution
would win on this argument.

Dander and Joseph will argue that Rosebud did not "know or reasonably should have
known" that Giorgio was police, as required by S 125.21. If the prosecution can show
that Giorgio was visible to Rosebud and wearing a uniform, it will defeat this defense.

Dander and Joseph will argue that they were not accomplices to this crime because
they did not have the intent/purpose required per MPC 2.06(4). They were not driving
the car, but merely passengers. But the prosecution can counter that by getting into the
car with the intent of escaping with Rosebud, it can be inferred that they intended to
cause harm to Giorgio (and anyone else in the way) in order to escape. This argument
is less likely to be successful with regard to Joseph, given his mental handicap.

Charge All Three with Second Degree Manslaughter for Migden's Death

| would charge all three survivors with second degree manslaughter on an accomplice
liability theory for Turner's accidentally shooting Migden. | think it's fair to say this was
reckless, not just negligent, because Turner was aware of the risk of hitting a bystander
and disregarded that risk. It is fair to charge McNeil in this charge despite her lack of
partnership with Turner because she was aware that a gun was brought by Dander or
Joseph, and thus knew of the risk that it would be used eventually.

Joseph will bring up the same defenses about his lack of awareness given his mental
retardation, to rebut the accomplice liability theory. But he likely understood the danger
that guns posed, and he may have been the one to possess the gun, so | think this


defense would fail. Given their awareness that guns were present and there was a
substantial risk they would be used, Joseph and the others were reckless with regard to
the commission of this offense.

rea

Charges | Would Not Bring

| would not charge any of these three defendants with the death of Staples. | do not
think | could prove that any of these defendants caused his death. This goes beyond
even the Acosta case, where a man who started a police chase was said to have
caused the deaths of two police helicopter pilots who crashed above him. The death of
an onlooker because of a rusty fire escape was a "too remote or accidental" to have a
bearing on these actors' culpability. MPC 2.03(3)(b). However, maybe Staples' landlord
is guilty of criminally negligent homicide -- similar to the Welansky case.

| would not charge anyone with the deaths of their co-participants, Turner and Rosebud,
or for the wounds suffered by McNeil. | think such a charge is foreclosed by 125.25. The
legislature evinced an intent to follow the agency theory from Canola, i.e. a defendant is
not liable when the police kill his co-participant, because the police is not his agent /
acting in furtherance of the felony (here, drug trafficking and maybe escape, depending
on the definition of that crime). | could possibly turn to criminally negligent homicide, and
allege that they all created a situation where they reasonably should have been aware
of the risk that their co-participants could be shot, but | think that with S 125.25, the
legislature intended to foreclose their responsibility for these deaths. Especially given
that they are being charged with so many other crimes, | do not think this charge is
appropriate.

QUESTION 2

While Moore's critique of Kelman's time framing thesis is valid with regard to the
voluntariness and causation elements of crime, it is inapplicable in an area where time
framing plays a crucial role: assessing the reasonableness of a defendant's belief that
self-defense was necessary. In the context of self defense, expanding or narrowing the
time frame does not negate the causation requirement, foreclosing the charge
altogether. Rather, expanding or narrowing the time frame in assessing the
reasonableness of a defendant's belief can play a dispositive role once a jury is tasked
with assessing the defendant's guilt. As a result, the time framing thesis is not only a
useful way to think about criminal law -- it's something that can work furtively against
vulnerable victims or defendants, and is too often ignored.

Though the result of the Zimmerman case did not turn on Florida's "Stand Your Ground"
law, that law is a useful starting point because it engages in narrow time framing. It


states that one has no duty to retreat if one is attacked while engaged in a lawful activity
in a place where one has a right to be. Thus, in assessing the reasonability of the use of
(deadly) force, Florida jurors are told to consider the defendant's beliefs at the very
moment force is used, not the actions that led up to it. In the Zimmerman case, this
meant that even if the jurors felt that Zimmerman's following Trayvon Martin was
unreasonable -- which it appears that they did, based on some interviews after the trial
-- because he was engaged in lawful activity, in a place where he had the right to be, at
the moment Trayvon (allegedly) fought him, the jurors could not consider this lead-up in
assessing the reasonableness of the belief.

This limited time framing with regard to the defendant's acts leading up to the "standoff"
is inherently unfair to victims like Trayvon. While it forecloses consideration of the
defendant's earlier actions that may have brought about the altercation, regardless of
their reasonableness, it does not foreclose consideration of those underlying beliefs that
a defendant may hold before, during and after an altercation. While "reasonably
believes" is textually the most objective standard, usually courts allow for the
introduction of some background information on the defendant, rather than forcing jurors
to assess what an imaginary reasonable man would do in a vacuum. In the Zimmerman
case, this meant that the jurors were informed of prior incidents of (petty) crime in the
neighborhood prior to the Trayvon incident. This played a role in assessing the
reasonableness of Zimmerman's belief that Trayvon was attempting to burglarize a
home in the neighborhood and was a dangerous individual. Also, whether or not they
were shown evidence on the race of the defendants in those earlier incidents, or on the
racial makeup of criminals in the area in general, the jurors (almost all white, with one
Hispanic) were likely operating with the same baseline assumptions as Zimmerman
about how blacks engage in the most crime.

By allowing for (overt and subconscious) consideration of the underlying beliefs and
assumptions that a defendant carries at the moment he decides that force is necessary,
but foreclosing consideration of the acts he unreasonably engaged in before that
moment, the "stand your ground" law and other laws like it work against victims and in
favor of defendants. We saw a very similar thing happen in the Goetz case. There, the
NY high court approved of a jury instruction calling for an assessment of whether
Goetz's actions were "that of a reasonable man in the defendant's situation." While this
is not an explicitly narrow time frame like in the Florida stand your ground law, | believe
a narrowing occurred behind the scenes, based on the outcome of the case. The jury
certainly considered the beliefs and experiences that Goetz carried with him at the
moment of the incident -- the four prior muggings, and the awareness of the high
incidence of crime by blacks on the subway -- but they appear to have ignored his
unreasonableness in the moments leading up to the shooting. He did not bring about
the mugging, of course, but he failed to take any of the actions that could have avoided
the use of deadly force -- brandishing the weapon instead of shooting, for example.

This is not to say that narrow time framing uniformly works against victims. In this way,
Kelman's argument that the choice between broad and narrow time framing is irrational
(and often subconsciously normative) comes to the forefront. In the context of battered


women's syndrome, for example, narrow time framing does the opposite it did in
Zimmerman and Goetz, and works against female defendants, because the imminence
/immediacy requirement in most self defense statutes forecloses a claim. In Norman,
the court interpreted imminence to require extremely narrow time framing to the instant
Norman used the gun, as opposed to a slightly broader time frame including a beating
by her husband earlier that evening. Even in Kelly, where the court reversed the
exclusion of expert testimony on BWS, the judge held that BWS was relevant only to the
defendant's subjective beliefs, not to the reasonableness of those beliefs.

In Zimmerman and these other cases, we see how time-framing plays a dispositive role.
Whether narrow time framing is expressly provided for in the statute, or a "reasonably
believes" standard is simply applied that way, it can foreclose the consideration of acts
(by defendant or victim) that directly speak to the reasonableness of the use of deadly
force. In my opinion, a wider time frame is always better in this context. That does not
mean that every experience or belief of the defendant is relevant to reasonableness of
his or her actions. But in the context of self defense, it makes no sense to foreclose
consideration of the interaction of the defendant and the victim leading up to the
incident, whether those interactions took place over years (as in the BWS context) or
over minutes (as in Zimmerman and Goetz).
