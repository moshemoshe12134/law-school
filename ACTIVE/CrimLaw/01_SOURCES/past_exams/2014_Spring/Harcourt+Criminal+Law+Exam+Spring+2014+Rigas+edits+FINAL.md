Final Examination

This is an open-book, three (3) hour, in-class examination. It is open book so you
may refer to any materials you have that are printed, but you should not talk to or confer
with anyone else. To repeat, you may not speak or consult in any way with any other
person during the exam and you are asked not to discuss the exam with anyone who has
not taken it.

This examination consists of 10 pages total (including the cover sheet).

This examination consists of two questions that will be graded evenly (50% and
50%). You should spend 90 minutes on each question since they will be weighed equally
toward the final grade.

It is anticipated that you can respond to each question with no more than 1,250
words, and I recommend that you do not exceed 2,500 words total. Please include a word
count at the end of your exam.

You may answer the questions in any order that suits you. Please note clearly the
question that you are responding to and leave several carriage spaces between your
answers. If you are writing your exam answers by hand, please write in ink on only one
side of the page, skip lines, and number your exam answer booklets in the format of
“Book 1/3; Book 2/3, etc.”

Good luck on the exam and have a great summer when you are done with exams.

Question 1

You are called to the office. On your desk, you find this report from investigators:

“Vashti McNeil arranged to sell a half pound of marijuana to Richard
Turner and Colby Dander. She drove to a local park to make the exchange,
accompanied by two acquaintances she had met the night before, Ronald Joseph
and Justin Rosebud. One of those men apparently took the front passenger seat
and the other sat in the back. At the designated meeting place, Turner climbed
into the car’s backseat while Dander waited outside. The backseat passenger
allowed Turner to inspect the marijuana. But rather than handing over money,
Turner punched that man in the face and fled with the drugs. As Turner and
Dander ran away, one of the male passengers—but again, which one is
contested—exited the car and fired several shots from a semiautomatic handgun.
The shooter then re-entered the vehicle, and all three would-be drug dealers gave
chase after the buyers-turned robbers. They trapped Turner and Dander in a dead-
end alley, but before the three could get out of their car, a police officer,
responding to a dispatcher’s alert, was on the scene, had his lights flashing and
sirens going, and announced over the car speaker that everyone in the car should
freeze and put their hands up.

As the police officer, Ricardo Giorgio, exited his patrol car, his service
weapon pointed at the car, two high school students who had been tagging the
alley started to signal frantically to the police officer that they were there and
completely innocent. Meanwhile, in the distance, everyone could hear that at least
two or three other patrol cars were on their way, sirens blaring. The three would-
be drug dealers came out of their car, hands over their heads, in close proximity to
the two buyers-turned robbers who had been cornered by their car. One of the two
men with their hands up, Joseph or Rosebud, had the semiautomatic handgun
tucked in the back of his waistband, exposed from the back but not visible from
the front. The two men backed up away from officer Giorgio in the direction of
Turner and Dander.

At that point, all hell broke out. Turner pulled the handgun from the
waistband, and both Joseph and Rosebud immediately dropped to the ground, as if
it had been planned—as if Joseph and Rosebud were handing off the
semiautomatic to Turner. Turner started firing in the direction of Officer Giorgio,
who then started shooting back toward Turner. McNeil had not dropped to the

ground, but was shot in the leg in the cross-fire by a bullet from Giorgio’s gun,
and fell to the floor wounded and paralyzed. Two other patrol cars screeched to a
halt, sirens screaming, and the two police officers jammed their doors open, and,
not knowing who was shooting, opened fire toward the four men—Turner,
Dander, Joseph and Rosebud. In the maelstrom, one of those police officers
mistakenly fired in the direction of the high school kids, wounding one of them,
Talia Roberts, in the back. Roberts fell to the ground paralyzed. Turner misfires
and by accident fatally shoots the other high school student, Al Migden. Turner
then fatally shoots one of the police officers who had just arrived on the scene,
Tobias Cornell. Turner is then directly shot by a police officer and killed.

Meanwhile, at the sound of all the shooting, a resident in the neighboring
building, Derick Staples, a crime reporter for the local newspaper, ran onto a fire
escape overlooking the alley where everything was taking place. In his
excitement, to better see what was going on below and take a photo with his
iPhone, he leaned over the railing, but it was rusty and the railing gave. He fell
five flights to his death.

With that distraction, Dander, Joseph and Rosebud managed to crawl back
into the car, with Rosebud at the wheel. Rosebud backed the car into officer
Giorgio, fatally injuring him, but was shot dead by another police officer, who
then took Dander and Joseph into custody.

Ambulances soon arrived on the scene of the crime and transported the
wounded, McNeil and Roberts, to the hospital; as well as the dead.

On investigation, records reveal that Tumer was a veteran of the War in
Afghanistan suffering from PTSD. He had been diagnosed with a mental disease
or defect which was aggravated by his PTSD. Clinical professionals are prepared
to testify that, during the incident, he believed he was in a combat situation in the
Depak Valley in Afghanistan and did not know that he was involved in an
altercation involving drugs or the police. The clinicians are prepared to testify that
the moment he was shot at by Joseph or Rosebud he flashed back entirely to
Afghanistan.

Investigation has also revealed that Joseph was suffering from a mental
impairment and was diagnosed in the cognitive range of borderline mental
retardation. There is some indication that he may have been under the undue
influence of Rosebud, who was six years older and exerted a great deal of

influence, including possible coercion, over his younger partner. Because of his
cognitive impairment, Joseph was unusually susceptible to pressure and was often
in fear of Rosebud.”

Your boss is going to ask you to litigate this case. She tells you that she’ll
supervise, but you are in charge. She suggests that you write a memo for her covering the
following topics:

1. What charges would you file against which individuals?
2. What defenses or issues would you raise on behalf of the individuals charged?

3. Who would likely have the better of the argument, the prosecution or the defense?

This memo will be important for your thinking about the case. Please do not just
write a laundry list of charges or defenses, but develop the issues that are most likely
going to be contested. I would recommend that you identify and discuss in order the most
important charges and associated defenses—focus on what matters.

The law that applies in your jurisdiction is the Model Penal Code for everything
except the homicide provision. The homicide provision has been amended and is attached
as an Appendix. Apart from this one section on homicide, everything else is governed by
the Model Penal Code. The homicide provision is included in the Appendix to this
examination.

Question 2

We came across the time-framing issue in our discussion of criminal law cases on
several occasions and, at those times, turned to Mark Kelman’s discussion of the
importance of interpretive constructs in the substantive criminal law.

This was certainly the case in our discussion of the George Zimmerman case.

You will recall that Michael Moore strenuously resists the time-framing argument
in an analogous situation involving voluntary acts. In a passage from our casebook,
Moore writes:

If there is any point in time where the act and mens rea requirements are
simultaneously satisfied, and from which the requisite causal relations exist to
some legally prohibited state of affairs, then the defendant is prima facie liable...
(KSSB 216).

Please use the Zimmerman case to develop an argument as to whether Kelman’s
time-framing thesis is a useful way to think about criminal law or a red herring.
