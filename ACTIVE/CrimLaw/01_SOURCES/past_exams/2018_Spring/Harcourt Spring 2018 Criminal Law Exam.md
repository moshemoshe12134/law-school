Question 1

You are a clerk to a Supreme Court judge of the State of New York, Kings
County. The judge has just received a call from the New York Times asking her to
comment on the fact that the Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez stated he would
empanel a grand jury to investigate the shooting death of Saheed Vassell on April 4,
2018. Your judge knows the case is going to come to her, and so she asked you to pull
together everything that is known about the homicide, and to draft a memo.

Here is what you have been able to find out about the homicide, drawing from
newspaper reports:

Saheed Vassell, age 34, was a local resident in Brooklyn suffering from bipolar
disorder. Neighbors and neighborhood police officers knew him as the broom
handler for a local barbershop, an idiosyncratic fixture on the block who was
mentally ill and liked to drink outside. Local patrol officers chatted with him and
sometimes bought him Jamaican food. They had taken him to the nearby hospital
to be treated for mental illness a number of times in recent years.

Mr. Vassell was known as quirky and occasionally erratic, but never violent,
neighbors said. Almost every morning he visited St. Matthew Roman Catholic
Church near Utica Avenue and Eastern Parkway, showing up before 7:30 a.m.
Mass. He would walk in, cross himself and then pace the aisles of the church,
bobbing his head without ever stopping to sit in the pews.

According to neighbors, Mr. Vassell sank into mental illness and started drinking
after a best friend was murdered in front of him around 15 years ago. One friend,
Henry E. Christian, said that when Mr. Vassell was drinking he would sometimes
act out the killing.

Mr. Vassell tried to get help, but haltingly, inquiring just last month about health
insurance options for people with bipolar disorder outside a United Healthcare
office. But while he had taken medication for bipolar disorder in the past, he was
not taking any currently, his father, Eric Vassell, said.

He hoarded artifacts he found on the street and stashed them on the roof of his
apartment building: locks, segments of pipe, a boiler casting, fingernail clippers, a
razor blade, a bicycle chain and a shoe. Among his possessions there were also

soiled latex gloves from his mother’s medical job and an envelope addressed to
his father.

Police officers dealt with Mr. Vassell many times over the years, giving him 120
summonses and classifying him as emotionally disturbed after several calls during
which they took him to a hospital.

On Wednesday April 4, 2018, Mr. Vassell strode up and down a busy Brooklyn
street lunging at passers-by — someone pushing a cart, someone holding a young
child’s hand — with a curved silver pipe resting on his fingers like the barrel of a
gun.

Anonymous callers called 911 telling the dispatcher that a black man with a
brown jacket and blue jeans was pointing at people with something that looked
like a gun.

The first 911 calls came in at 4:40 p.m. In total, the police got three 911 calls
about Mr. Vassell, a spokesman said.

One caller described a man “pointing a silver thing in a lady’s face,” then told a
dispatcher: “I don’t know if it’s a gun, ma’am. It seems like a gun. It’s silver.”

Another caller said a man outside a laundromat had a gun in his hand.

And a third caller told a dispatcher: “He looks like he is crazy, but he’s pointing
something at people that looks like a gun and he’s like popping it like he’s pulling
the trigger. He’s not pulling a trigger, but he’s making a motion as if he is, and
there is something sticking out of his jacket.”

The dispatcher then sent a smartphone alert with this information to all NYPD
officers.

Several plainclothes anti-crime officers from another part of town answered the
smartphone alert. They screeched to a stop at the corner where Mr. Vassell spent
most days and, after he crouched and aimed the pipe at them, almost instantly shot
and killed him.

The three plainclothes officers were not assigned to the incident, but saw an alert
about it in their car and decided to respond. They asked a dispatcher for more
details and reached the scene by 4:42 p.m., the police said.

Because the officers were sent to an intersection rather than a street address, they
lacked information that there had been previous incidents regarding Mr. Vassell.

Three uniformed officers from the Strategic Response Group, which handles
major events and hot spots of crime, happened to be in the area and responded to
the scene, too.

When they all converged on the corner of Montgomery Street and Utica Avenue,
the six officers saw Mr. Vassell assume a shooting stance, the police said. Four of
them — three plainclothes officers and one uniformed officer — rapidly fired a
total of 10 shots. Witnesses said they did not hear the officers say anything.

According to the police, security camera footage shows Mr. Vassell getting into a
shooting stance and raising the pipe before the police shot him. The police said he
was pointing it toward responding officers.

The police said it took 5 to 10 seconds from the moment officers pulled up to the
corner of Montgomery Street and Utica Avenue to the moment they shot Saheed
Vassell.

Several witnesses said they did not hear officers shout a warning or command
before shooting. The police said that the officers repeatedly told the man: “Drop
it.”

The police released the following details about the four officers who fired at Mr.
Vassell, who was black:

The three plain clothed officers were from a plainclothes anti-crime unit in the
71st Precinct: a white officer with four years of experience (Officer Adam); a
white officer with six years of experience (Officer Bruce); and a black officer
with five years of experience (Officer Charles). They fired nine shots between
them.

The fourth was a uniformed officer from the Strategic Response Group, which
handles major events and hot spots of crime. He is Indian, the police said, and has
six years of experience (Office David). He fired once, the police said.

None of the officers had been involved in any previous shootings, the police said.

Another uniformed officer from the Strategic Response Group (Officer Edward)
and a sergeant from the 71st Precinct (Officer Frank) were also at the scene,
though neither fired their weapon.

Police officials maintain it hardly mattered which officers answered the call or
what training they had. Any officers facing what appeared to be a gun aimed at
them would have little choice but to fire, these officials said. Security camera
videos from nearby businesses showed Mr. Vassell just moments before his death,
startling people on the street and jabbing the pipe into one man’s chest.

“Saheed came from a good family and they have no right to shoot him down the
way they did, because Saheed is no gunman,” Mr. Vassell’s mother, Lorna
Vassell, said.

Your judge has asked you to determine, based on the facts you collected, whether
there is a case against the police officers and if so, what is the proper level of criminal
responsibility for the police officers. The judge has asked you to write a memo for her
covering the following topics:

1. What would the prosecution rightfully think would be the proper level of criminal
responsibility on these facts, if any?

2. What would the defense rightfully think would be the proper level, if any?

3. Who would likely have the better of the argument? What should the court find as
a matter of law if presented with these arguments?

For purposes of the applicable law, please use (1) the homicide provision attached
as an Appendix to this exam as Appendix A (directly replacing MPC §210 et seq.); (2)
the use of force in law enforcement attached as an Appendix to this exam as Appendix B
(directly replacing MPC §3.07); and (3) regarding any other issue, the Model Penal Code.
(You will find those two MPC replacement provisions on pages 8 to 11 of this
document).

Question 2

Michel Foucault, in his lecture on “Truth and Juridical Forms” in 1973, made the
following statement:

The West would be dominated by the great myth according to
which truth never belongs to political power: political power is
blind—the real knowledge is that which one possesses when one
is in contact with the gods or when one remembers things, when
one looks at the great eternal Sun or one opens one’s eyes to what
came to pass. With Plato there began a great Western myth: that
there is an antinomy between knowledge and power. If there is
knowledge, it must renounce power. Where knowledge and science
are found in their pure truth, there can no longer be any political
power.

This great myth needs to be dispelled. It is this myth which Nietz-
sche began to demolish by showing, in the numerous texts already
cited, that, behind all knowledge [savoir], behind all attainment of
knowledge [connaissance], what is involved is a struggle for power,
Political power is not absent from knowledge, it is woven together
with it.

See Michel Foucault, Power, ed. James D. Faubion, p. 32 (New York: New Press, 2000).

Please explain to me what Foucault meant by this and how it might help us
understand current criminal law. Please use one topic of criminal law that we studied this
semester in our Criminal Law class to help make sense both of what Foucault is arguing
and of how it might apply to that specific area of Criminal Law.

Please write a well-reasoned and persuasive essay that addresses this question.
Please make sure to include (1) a section explaining what Foucault is saying; (2) a section
explaining how Foucault’s argument could be interpreted in the field of Criminal Law
broadly; and (3) a section illustrating how it can help us analyze one specific area of the
law that we studied in Criminal Law this semester.

1. Knowing that he may cause serious physical injury to another person, he causes the
death of such person or of a third person; or

2. With intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or

A person is guilty of murder in the third degree when:

1. With intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or
of a third person and the defendant acted under the influence of extreme emotional
disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse, the reasonableness
of which is to be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the defendant’s situation
under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be; or

2. Under circumstances evincing indifference to human life, he recklessly engages in
conduct which creates a grave risk of death to another person, and thereby causes the
death of another person. Such indifference shall be presumed if, acting either alone or
with one or more other persons, he commits or attempts to commit robbery, burglary,
kidnapping, arson, sexual assault, drug trafficking, or escape, and, in the course of and in
furtherance of such crime or of immediate flight therefrom, he, or an agent of his, if there
be any, causes the death of a person other than one of the participants to the underlying
crime; except that in any prosecution under this subdivision, in which the defendant was
not the only participant in the underlying crime, it is an affirmative defense that the
defendant:

(a) Did not commit the homicidal act or in any way solicit, request, command,
importune, cause or aid the commission thereof; and (b) Was not armed with a deadly
weapon, or any instrument, article or substance readily capable of causing death or
serious physical injury and of a sort not ordinarily carried in public places by law-abiding
persons; and (c) Had no reasonable ground to believe that any other participant intended
to engage in conduct likely to result in death or serious physical injury.

Murder in the third degree is a class A-III felony.

§ 210.26 Murder in the second degree.

there was a reasonable explanation or excuse, the reasonableness of which is to be
determined from the viewpoint of a person in the defendant's situation under the
circumstances as the defendant believed them to be. Nothing contained in this paragraph
shall constitute a defense to a prosecution for, or preclude a conviction of, manslaughter
in the first degree or any other crime except murder in the third degree; or
