MEMORANDUM

TO: Spring 2018 Criminal Law Students
RE: Spring 2018 Final Examination
DATE: Friday, May 18, 2018

Question | (Fatal Police Shooting of Mr. Vassell)

This case is all about the justification for law enforcement use of lethal force under §3.07
and §3.09. Under the applicable law, only negligent or reckless conduct could possibly be
charged because of the dueling provisions in §3.07 and §3.09. The heart of the matter is whether
these police officers were negligent or reckless in shooting to kill (10 shots) so quickly (and it is
worse for the three plain clothed officers than the one tactical uniformed cop). The discussion
should start there. There is no reason to think that a reasonable prosecutor would start anywhere
higher than the justification defense in this case given that it is so subjective for intent or
knowledge homicides. Any reasonable prosecutor will be deciding whether to go for reckless
homicide (second degree manslaughter) or criminally negligent homicide—or not to proceed. So
there really is not reason to start discussions anywhere else than at the heart of the matter.

As between reckless, negligent or no culpability, that is not an easy matter because Mr.
Vassell was purportedly assuming a crouching position and aiming at them with what appeared
to be a gun. Ultimately, the real substantive discussion has to be about police practices, and
whether these officers were careless in implicating themselves in a situation that neighborhood
cops with more local knowledge would have addressed differently. But that is a very tricky
question.

In terms of the proper homicide charge, the police officers who discharged their weapons
(A, B, C, and D) unquestionably had knowledge that their actions could cause death; and they


probably were shooting with intent to kill. 10 shots rapid fire was sure to kill Mr. Vassell. So in
terms of the homicide charge and mens rea, practically any level of mens rea is arguably present.

Everything then turns on the justification under MPC §3.07 and §3.09. As you know
well, the modified §3.07 that you have, like the original MPC, is a purely subjective standard test
(“believes”); but under §3.09, it does not protect against reckless or negligent conduct in forming
that belief “or failing to acquire any knowledge or belief which is material to the justifiability of
his use of force.”

So, the charge would have to begin at either (1) criminally negligent homicide; or (2)
second degree manslaughter. Those would be the maximum possible charges. The third-degree
murder definition requires more than recklessness, it is gross recklessness and so probably not
applicable under §3.09.

Note that this case does not involve the “extreme emotional disturbance” excuse in
§210.20; it probably does not trigger conspiracy or complicity for the officers who did not shoot;
nor any other possible creative provision in the code, so no need to discuss necessity separately,
or self-defense separately, etc. No need to discuss causation really, nor voluntariness. Those are
all just a waste of the judge’s time. As a result:

1)The prosecutor would at most push for negligent homicide or second degree manslaughter.
Note that, in terms of differentiating defendants, you could argue that officer David, who only
fired once, was less negligent; and that the other three officers, Adam, Bruce, and Charles were
more so because they fired a total of 9 shots. You could argue one shot is to disable, three is
likely to kill.

2) The defense would argue for no liability because the officers were not even negligent. Any
reasonable officer would have fired his or her service weapon under these circumstances.

3) The court will have to decide difficult policy issues here about local knowledge in policing — a
tough question. In doing that, the court will need to take into consideration the context of police
shootings today and the racial dynamics at play in the encounter. It would be worth discussing
and elaborating on those.


Question 2 (The knowledge/power critique in Foucault)

Foucault’s central idea is that knowledge and power are inextricably linked: what we
know and believe to be true is actually a product of the social order in which we find ourselves
and of struggles of power. The idea cuts deep. It’s not just that “knowledge is power” in the
Baconian sense: it is not just that those with knowledge can seek and obtain power. Nor is it just
that the powerful use or shape knowledge: it is not just that the privileged class can determine
what we believe. Rather, it is that what we believe to know is a product of complicated struggles
of power in our society—what we believe is shaped by social relations and the social order we
live in, often in ways that are invisible to us. Power is not something that the rich possess and use
to dominate the poor. Power should be thought instead in terms of relations of power that are
constantly contested, but that form the social context in which we find ourselves. In this sense,
knowledge is never pure or objective; it is always part of the social structure we live in.

Broadly, this has deep implications for criminal law: as we saw in the slave cases from
the antebellum period, what the judges and lawyers believed about how slaves should be treated
in the criminal process was inextricably linked to the social context of chattel slavery. There was
no objectivity to their truth-claims; those were the product of and completely intertwined with
the social order of slavery. The same is true of the way that women have been treated by the law,
whether in the area of excuse and justification, or in the area of sexual assault; or that African-
Americans have been treated, think here of the McQuirter case.

More specifically, it is possible to examine discrete areas of criminal law to trace how
power struggles have shaped legal rules. The best examples would entail evolutions of legal
doctrine that offer a glimpse at how law changes historically as a result of our changing beliefs.
So, for example, the battered wife syndrome defense and how it has evolved over time; or the
evolution of the law of law enforcement justification of the use of lethal force; or the evolution
of the insanity defense; or the evolution of the law of sexual assault. Anywhere where there have
been pendulum swings in the law, there could be a brilliant discussion of how knowledge and
power are inextricably linked.

I have attached some sample answers from students.

Thank you again for a marvelous semester, and for landing with me safely. Have a great
summer.

Sincerely yours,

Question 1
Judge Gonzales,

In this case we face a question of whether the law enforcement use of force is justified.
From the outset, it is worth noting that under MPC 3.07 adopted in this jurisdiction, the
standard applied is completed the subjective. The statute reads that "deadly force may be

used...when he or she believes that:...(c) the use of deadly physical force is necessary to

defend the police officer or peace officer or another person from what the

officer believes to be the use or imminent use of serious force likely to cause great bodily

injury." The use of the word "believes" twice without the modifier reasonable suggests a
completely subjective standard in this case. However, MPC 3.09(2) (also adopted in this
jurisdiction) provides that if the actor is reckless or negligent in having such a belief (or in
failing to acquire knowledge regarding the justifiability of his use of force) the justification
afforded by MPC 3.07 is unavailable in a prosecution for an offense for which
recklessness or negligence suffices to establish culpability. In this case, there is little
doubt that the officers themselves had the subjective belief Vassell was carrying a gun.
The pipe he was holding looked like a gun, all three witnesses who called 911 suspected
the pipe might be a gun, and officers from separate units determined that the pipe looked
enough by a gun to warrant a shooting. Thus, the crux of this case comes down to

whether the officers were reckless, negligent, or justified in drawing this conclusion.
Prosecution:

The prosecutors may choose to make a case that the officers are guilty of second degree
manslaughter for acting recklessly. The shooting officers, all with 4+ years of experience
on the force, knew that they were being sent to an intersection, rather than an address,

and thus the information they received about Vassell from the dispatcher was necessarily

incomplete. Despite this, they made no effort to contact neighborhood police officers for

20f9


CRIMINAL_LAW_SEC_4_HARCOURT_S18 ID: 804

more information or to inquire as to whether neighborhood police officers were available
to take on the case. They, as experienced officers, know information related to a potential
crime at an intersection would be incomplete, and consciously disregarded this risk by
shooting almost immediately upon seeing Vassell (5-10 seconds) and not providing him

an instruction to drop his weapon according to witnesses.

The force used here was additionally unreasonable. The three officers from the plain
clothes unit fired a total of 9 shots; the three officers from the Strategic Response group
only fired 1 shot collectively. This disparity in the number of shots fired between the two
units suggests that the plainclothes unit was acting recklessly. There is no evidence that
the Strategic Response group had any more mitigating information about Vassell than the
plain clothes unit; illustrating the recklessness and disproportionality of the 9 bullets. Two
officers involved in the situation did not fire whatsoever, there is no evidence they even
drew their guns. This suggesting the shooting officer's actions were a gross deviation

from reasonable behavior and their beliefs were recklessly formed.

However, the prosecution is more likely to charge criminal negligence in this case. It will
extremely difficult for the prosecutor to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
officers knew their information about Vassel to be incomplete and consciously
disregarded this risk. Given their experience on the force, the prosecutor has a much
stronger case that the officers should have known their information was incomplete, and
thus are guilty of criminal negligence under 210.10. As stated in in MPC 3.09(2), they we
negligent in failing to acquire knowledge about their use of force. With minimal additional
effort (ex: by contacting the neighborhood officers over the walkie talkie), they could
have learned about 120 additional summons and a classification of emotion disturbance
suggesting deadly force was unnecessary in this case. Therefore, the charge of criminal
negligence -- that the officers should have known the risk but didn't and their behavior

was a gross deviation from the standard -- seems more appropriate to charge in this case.

Defense:

3 of 9


CRIMINAL_LAW_SEC_4_HARCOURT_S18 ID: 804

The defense will argue that the officer's beliefs were completely justified and at most the
officers are guilty for civil negligence; thus, they are completely shielded from culpability
under MPC 3.07. The crime the prosecution charges requires criminal negligence, or a
gross deviation from how reasonable people would act in the given situation. The
defendant's behavior did not reach the level of a gross deviation; therefore they are not
culpable under MPC 3.09 because their mens rea is not sufficient to establish culpability.
There is no evidence the officers from the Strategic Response group contacted the
neighborhood police officers; therefore, their failure to do so is not a gross deviation

from how reasonable officers behave.

The defense will argue that Vassell crouched into a shooting stance and aimed the pipe at
the officers as if it was a gun. They will claim, contrary to witness testimony, that they
repeatedly told Vassell to drop his weapon and he still did not. They will reiterate the
police officials statement that they had no choice but to fire, and based on the
information they received from 911 dispatchers it was reasonable for them to believe the
weapon Vassell was holding was a gun. Had they not shot, and had Vassell had a gun,

lives would have been lost.

The defense will point to the fact that, in all of the officer's years of experience, they had
never been in a shooting before. The jury thus has no reason to doubt that the belief the
pipe was a gun was negligently or recklessly formed. They will point to the fact that an
officer from a different precinct came to the same conclusion. They may additionally
point to the fact that Officer Charles (who is black) also fired on Vassell in an effort to
prove that the officers belief about Vassell's dangerousness were not racially biased and
therefore unreasonable. However, this argument is flawed given it presumes officers of
color are not influenced by the same biases and cultural messages that act on the

population more generally.

The defense may make an argument that their shooting was merely a reflex to seeing
Vassell with a potentially deadly weapon, and therefore their actions do not constitute a

voluntary act under MPC 2.01(2). However, this argument should be swiftly rejected. The

4 of 9


CRIMINAL_LAW_SEC_4_HARCOURT_S18 ID: 804

officers volunteered to take the call from the dispatcher, and had time to prepare for the
situation they were walking into. It took them 5-10 seconds to fire and each officer fired
about 3 bullets, suggesting their goal was to disable the shooter. They have little basis to

argue this act was the result of a mere reflex.
Outcome:

As a matter of law, the court should find that the prosecution has a better argument.
When officers are summoned to an intersection rather than an address, especially officers
with 4-6 years of experience, they should know their information about an individual is
incomplete. The burden of seeking out additional information is extremely low; if
additional information cannot be gained, the officers should at least approach the
situation with more caution -- providing more than mere seconds for the individual to
drop their weapon and providing clear verbal warnings to drop the weapon before
shooting (and ensure that their warnings are somehow acknowledged by the person in
question). The fact that witnesses didn't hear the officers telling Vassell to drop his
weapon illustrates that, even if they did tell V to drop his weapon, they may have been
negligent in telling him to do so at a volume he could not hear. Therefore, the charge of
criminal negligence is appropriate here. The officers used an unnecessary amount of
force against Vassell, didn't make warnings to drop the gun clear enough to be heard if
they made them at all, and waited a mere 5-10 seconds before shooting. This court

should determine this is a gross deviation amounting to criminal negligence.

This ruling makes sense as a matter of policy. Individuals who are homeless as a result of
mental illness do not have an address; therefore, they are particularly vulnerable to law
enforcement use of force. By holding that the officers were grossly negligent in failing to
seek out more information when called to an intersection or non-address, this court
would incentivize officers to consciously appreciate the probability they are confronting a
vulnerable individual. If officers are not required to do so, the benefits of community
policing are lost. Community policing allows police officers to take a broad view of an

individual -- a community police officer would have known that Vassell collects found

CRIMINAL_LAW_SEC_4_HARCOURT_S18 ID: 804

objects, reenacts the shooting of his friend, and has never been violent in the past. If we
tule for the defense as a matter of law, we concede that law enforcement officers are
entitled to take a narrow view regarding a vulnerable population which needs broad time
framing the most. A finding of criminal negligence in this case is therefore appropriate, on
the basis that the officers should be especially aware how vital additional information is to
cases of seemingly erratic, "crazy" as one witness put it, repeated-but-unfulfilled threats
of violence on the street.

Question 1
Dear Judge,

This would be a difficult case for the prosecution. While we have clear causation and
voluntary action, it will be a hard case on prove requisite mens rea. The "Use of Force in
Law Enforcement" statute grants broad discretion to officers, allowing the use of force in
the course "of his official duties," and requiring only a subjective standard. Here, the
officers need only believe that the use of deadly force was necessary to defend
themselves or others from what they believed "to be imminent use of serious physical
force likely to cause great bodily injury." As such, a reasonable belief is not required. It
will not be difficult for the officers to show that they did subjectively believe that serious
physical force was imminent, and as such they subjectively believed it was necessary to
use deadly force to defend themselves and others. Based on the 911 calls, channelled
through the dispatcher, as well as the object's resemblance to a gun when held my Vassell
in the photo, the officers should be able to demonstrate that they subjectively believed

deadly force was necessary, as required under the statute.

However, here we may look to MPC 3.09, because the statute here only replaced S 3.07.
MPC 3.09 imposes limits on the Use of Force, providing a type of imperfect self-defense
whereby the defense is unavailable-for an offense for which recklessness or negligence
suffices to establish culpability-if the actor is negligent or reckless in believing it was
necessary to use physical force, or in acquiring or failing to acquire any knowledge or
belief that is material to the justifiability of his use of force. The question thus becomes
whether any or all of the officers were reckless or negligent in forming or maintaining

there belief as to the necessity of the use of deadly force.

I believe the prosecution can try to make a case for criminally negligent homicide, though

it will be very difficult to win under the circumstances of this case, especially given this

20f 8


CRIMINAL_LAW_SEC_4_HARCOURT_S18 ID: 852

country's history of siding with police officers in prosecutions for wrongful shooting.
The prosecution can argue that the officers were negligent in the formation of their beliefs
of the necessity to use deadly force, or in the need to use that level of deadly force, in
failing to acquire relevant knowledge that would have been material to the justifiability of
the offense. I don't believe the prosecution will charge manslaughter here, because I think
it will be extremely difficult to prove and convict based upon a recklessness mens rea.
Here, however, negligence is a possibility. The officers first call came into the dispatcher
at 4:40 PM, and the officers arrive two minute slater at 4:42 PM. The police state that in
only took 5-10 seconds from the time they pulled up until they began shooting. Saheed
Vassell never stood a chance, because the whole incident proceeded to its conclusion in
a matter of minutes. The officers based all of their information off the what the dispatcher
had told them, without fully comprehending the situation for themselves. All but 1 witness
made it clear that they were unsure of whether the object Vassell had was actually a gun.
They stated that it "looked like" or "seemed like" a gun, but were unsure. Moreover, one

witness states that "he looks like he is crazy," indicating possible mental illness.

The officers who fired shots had a combined 21 years of experience, and averaged over
5 years each. They have almost certainly been trained and experienced first-hand the
effects of mental illness. The should have been aware of the risk of shooting first and
asking questions later. Moreover, the majority of the officers who fired at Vassell were in
plainclothes. They should have recognized that he may not have understood they were
police, and they certainly should have made that clear. Rather, the prosecution can argue
based on witness testimony, that they failed to say anything to Mr. Vassell. The officers
will argue that they did in fact command Mr. Vassell to "drop it," but it is unclear whether
the officers announced themselves as such. (at least for the plainclothes). Granted, the
facts state that the officers "screeched to a halt," and thus may have had their sirens
blaring as they approached. Nevertheless, the prosecution will argue, they should have
recognized the substantial and unjustifiable risk of pulling up to the scene and "instantly"
shooting Saheed Vassell without adequate information, and doing so was certainly a

gross deviation from the standard of care for a reasonable police officer. (this may be

3 of 8


CRIMINAL_LAW_SEC_4_HARCOURT_S18 ID: 852

particularly so for Mr. David, of the Strategic Response Group, because he had special
knowledge, skill and experience under pressure dealing with major events and hot spots,

so he may be held to a higher standard of reasonableness - see Hall).

The defense, however, will argue that the officers were not negligent, but perfectly
justified in forming and maintaining their belief that the use of deadly force was necessary.
Though two of the witness may have been unsure of the existence of a gun, one witness
stated with definitively that Mr. Vassell possessed a gun, and in any event officers must
always assume the worst. Moreover, they will argue Mr. Vassell's mental illness made him
more of a threat, not less of one, and thus they should not be required to confirm. These
officers were "from another part of town" and "lacked information" given that they were
sent to an intersection rather than an address, so they did not know Mr. Vassell or
understand his history- including his friendly relationships with other officers. The
officers will point to the security camera footage with confidence, noting both the
resemblance of the object to a gun when held by Mr. Vassell, as well as his actions in
crouching, pointing, and pretending to shoot as if the object was a gun. As for the time-
frame, the defense may argue that there is never enough time to decide sufficiently
whether to use deadly force, and that officers are put into situations every day in which
they must make split-second decisions. There is also an argument to be made on
constitutional grounds, that the statute does not pass the constitutional threshold because
of the broad discretion in enforcement (this may be a valid challenge, but I will not
address it here - if you wish, I would be happy to do so in another memo). In conclusion,
the defense will assert, the officers were totally justified in using deadly force under the
Use of Force Statute as well as MPC 3.09.

I believe the defense will likely prevail, though the prosecution should do its best to point
of the significance of the incredibly short window of time in which these events unfolded,
and contract it with the volume of force used against Mr. Vassell. In determining what is
and is not "reasonable," the prosecution should acknowledge the gradations of (lethal)

force. The four officers, recognizing that they were all present and that each had their

4 of 8


CRIMINAL_LAW_SEC_4_HARCOURT_S18 ID: 852

guns drawn, all fired a total of 10 shots at Vassell. This is certainly excessive, and should
be pointed out as such. Mr. Vassell may still be alive today if the officers had taken even
a little more time to understand the situation- they could have merely communicated
between themselves as to who would fire, and aimed only to disable and disarm. The
officers will of course argue that the situation did not allow for that, as don't most similar
situations. However, the prosecution would do well to emphasize this disparity to the
grand jury. Though doing so may result in probably cause for an indictment, ultimately I
do not believe the officers will be convicted.

Note: I did not charge the other two officers who did not fire shots because any argument
that they "caused" Mr. Vassell's death would be attenuated. Moreover, I did not charge
recklessness here because I think it will be extremely difficult to prove that the officers
were consciously aware of the risk that they lacked information and Vassell was
harmless. In examining the use of force statute, it is clear the broad discretion granted to
officers exhibits legislative intent toward a policy of deference to officers. As such,
criminally negligent homicide may be a good compromise and may actually result in a
conviction

Question 2

The Knowledge-Power Myth

In his 1973 lecture on "Truth and Juridical Forms," Michel Foucault presents the
pervasive Western myth that knowledge and power are independent. In contrast to
"European societies of the Mediterranean East," where political power and knowledge are
widely acknowledged to go hand-in-hand, the myth of the West is that our societies have
evolved beyond this to a system of governance in which knowledge and power operate in
separate spheres. Foucault 31. According to this myth, power is as blind as Oedipus
Rex, while the shepherds possess the great body of knowledge. Power structures operate
without knowledge, and knowledge is untainted by power.

Foucault explains that what this myth obscures is that knowledge and power are very
much intertwined. Political power and knowledge cannot be cleanly separated, as political
power is "woven together" with knowledge. 32. The insidiousness of this myth is that we
act under the pretense that knowledge and power are separate. The result is that we have
a blind trust of knowledge that is exceptionally dangerous in any system of government

but particularly in a democracy.

Building on Foucault's assertion, I propose three problems that our belief in this myth
presents for the American system. First, we feel that we do not need to question power
structures, because we, as sole possessors of knowledge, are able to counterbalance the
existing power structures with our knowledge. This feeling is enabled by democracy, as
we are lulled into complacency by the belief that our knowledge can serve as a check on
power at the polls. This sense of complacency, however, is problematic in a system
where voting rights are heavily compromised and marginalized groups are systematically

underrepresented.

6 of 10


CRIMINAL_LAW_SEC_4_HARCOURT_S18 ID: 857

Second, we do not question the knowledge that we possess, because we believe it to be
objective truth. What we fail to realize, however, is that all the knowledge that we possess
has been filtered down to us through the power structures above. Our knowledge is
tainted by power, which is extremely problematic if we are unaware and cannot correct

for it.

Finally, we do not question the objectivity of what those in positions of political power
do, because we believe they are blind. It is dangerous that we do not recognize that
political structures are actually wielding knowledge as a tool for entrenching power.
Those in power have knowledge, and they are using it in order to effect their objectives

under the guise of blindness.

Applying the Myth to the Criminal Law

If something is presented to us as knowledge, we assume that it by definition has not
been tainted by political power. After all, "[w]here knowledge and science are found in
their pure truth, there can no longer be any political power." 32. This leads us to the

problems of the criminal justice system.

In no system in American government does knowledge appear more objective than in the
criminal justice system. In the criminal law, we believe that the processes and systems we
have in place lead us to objective answers and dispassionate truths. We accept that once
someone's case has been adjudicated and a punishment meted out, his innocence or guilt
is a truth that can no longer be questioned. Once the criminal justice system has labeled
someone a murderer, we no longer have the prerogative to question whether that is what
he truly is. The criminal justice system, hammered out by our Constitution and finely
wrought in the intervening years, is a system that filters out the subjective so that only the

truth remains at the end.

Lawyers, the very individuals whom those unfortunate enough to be victims of the
criminal justice system rely upon to expose real truth, are indoctrinated early in their

careers with the notion that the fruits of the criminal justice system are truthful. In law

7 of 10


CRIMINAL_LAW_SEC_4_HARCOURT_S18 ID: 857

school, future lawyers are taught to read criminal law cases and repeat their holdings as
truth. Most law students are not instructed to question the truthfulness of those holdings
or the fairness of the laws that are being applied or whether an individual who has been
labeled a murderer actually is one. This prepares criminal lawyers to spend their careers
accepting that the criminal justice system comprises an objective process espousing
objective truths, without questioning the motives that are at play behind every court

decision and every law.

The Knowledge-Power Myth and the Death Penalty

In light of Foucault's knowledge-power myth, the entire system of sentencing should be
under scrutiny, as sentences are handed down as objective truth, but, as Foucault
suggests, this truth cannot be divorced from political power, meaning that what we
accept as truthful is tainted by power structures. This is problematic when individuals’
liberty hangs in the balance. Nowhere can the dangerousness of this myth better be seen

than in the context of the death penalty.

I will analyze the death penalty through the framework of the three problems I set out
above. To reiterate, these are complacency in the face of power, a mistaken belief in the
objectiveness of our knowledge, and a misplaced trust in the objectivity of those in

power.

First, we allow the government, mainly prosecutors and judges, to decide whether to end
the life of an individual, because we believe that our own knowledge provides an
adequate check on this power via the democratic process. We fail to consider that
systematic discrimination in voting rights and the mass disenfranchisement of felons
prevent the very people who need to use their knowledge to speak truth to power are
deprived of the means of doing so. If individuals who have served time in prison are
allowed to vote, they can use their knowledge of the system to vote against those in
power who support harsh sentencing and the death penalty; but when these individuals

are deprived of this right, and their families and communities of color are deprived of this

8 of 10


CRIMINAL_LAW_SEC_4_HARCOURT_S18 ID: 857

right as well, knowledge can serve as no check on power.

Second, we do not question that, when people are sentenced to death, they deserve it.
We accept the truthfulness of a death sentence because we think that the procedures we
have in place, including our Constitution, allow only the objective truth to come out. One
of the myths inherent in the death penalty context is that there are additional procedural
safeguards to protect those whose lives are at stake. We are remiss in not questioning the
fact that our so-called knowledge of who is innocent and who is guilty, who deserves to
live and who deserves to die, has been handed down to us from from systems and rules
that have been created and executed by those with political power. In reality, racist
prosecutors are allowed to exercise discretion to seek the death penalty for a black
defendant but not for a similarly situated white defendant. Black jurors are removed in the
voir dire process, and judges in Alabama, Texas, and Delaware are allowed to remove an
LWOP sentence from the jury and decide that an individual deserves death. We accept
death sentences as reflecting the objective truth arrived at via an objective system, but
self-interested or biased political and judicial actors are behind much of what we believe

to be objectively decided.

Finally, we accept the Supreme Court's decisions as objective truth. We act as though
Supreme Court justices are blind. This notion is reinforced as we see imagery, such as
around federal courthouses, of people wearing a blindfold, to suggest that justice is blind.
This imagery evokes Oedipus and the ideal of the blind, impartial leader. While the
knowledge-power myth would suggest that Supreme Court justices are blind arbiters of
truth, in fact they may, and often do, have political or personal objectives to which the
public is not privy. The issue is when we accept Supreme Court decisions as objective

truth and then fail to question their validity.

This is what Steiker and Steiker suggest has happened in the death penalty context.
Steiker and Steiker argue that, with Gregg, the Supreme Court seemed to validate the
objectivity of the capital punishment structures in the states, and we have accepted these

systems as objective because the impartial Supreme Court has told us that it is so. The

Supreme Court referred to the state regimes' "'clear and objective standards'" and
instilled in the public the false belief that these systems are objective. As Steiker and
Steiker suggest, however, since Gregg, the state capital punishment regimes have moved

"

backward toward the pre-Furman days of "arbitrary and capricious" standards. The
death penalty system is not objective, despite that the Supreme Court, acting as impartial

arbiter, has deemed it to be.

Doyle Hamm's case illustrates the false truthfulness of the death penalty system. Because
Hamm was sentenced to death, judges, the public, and Alabama public officials accept as
objective truth that he deserves to be put to death without questioning the many ways in
which subjectivity, bias, and misinformation masquerading as truth played a role in his

sentence.

Question 1.

The prosecution will bring against the four police officers who shot Vassell the charge of

manslaughter in the second degree or in the alternative, criminally negligent homicide.

This case hinges upon MPC 3.07 and 3.09. The reason the prosecution will not bring the
crime of murder in the first, second, or third degree, or manslaughter in the first degree, is
that the required mens rea for those crimes is intent or knowledge. 3.07 states that the
officer can act to "ensure the safety of" himself. The prosecution will not try to argue the
officers didn't believe they were acting to ensure their safety. It will be too difficult given
that the statute from the subjective standpoint of the officers. 3.07 allows force that he
"believes such to be necessary", not what a reasonable person would think. It also
restricts deadly physical force, but only to what "[he] believes" - another subjective
standard. Finally, 1(C) allows use of deadly force from "what the officer believes" to be
serious physical force. Officers simply have to state that they subjectively believed he had

a gun and posed a risk of using the gun to cause serious force.

However, there is still a case to be brought. 3.09 limits 3.07 by limiting this justification
when (2) that the actor is "reckless or negligent in having such belief or in acquiring or
failing to acquire any knowledge or belief that is material". However, this only limits the
justification for offenses for which recklessness or negligence suffices to establish
culpability! Therefore, the use of "intent" or "knowledge" instead of "negligence" or
"recklessness" in the murder and manslaughter in the first degree statutes means that the
justification in 3.07 is still available in intent or knowledge crimes, even if the knowledge

was negligently or recklessly acquired.

The prosecution will argue that the 4 defendants were reckless or negligent in their belief

or in failing to acquire knowledge that is material. Recklessness requires in 2.02 a

"conscious disregard" of aa "substantial and unjustifiable risk" to the "nature and degree
that" it is a "gross deviation" from the standard of conduct of a law-abiding person.
Negligence also simply requires a "substantial and unjustifiable risk". The modified statute
states that criminal negligence is "more demanding" than the civil standard, however, the
prosecution will state it is still similar to the 2.02 standard of a substantial and unjustifiable
risk - this is much higher than the burden in torts. The prosecution will attempt to turn
some of the facts released by the police (potentially to help their case and influence
public opinion). The fact that the officers were experienced meant that they had the
training and expertise to know police procedure. They consciously disregarded their
knowledge they would have that mentally ill persons are often killed by police, as well as
black individuals. Therefore, they should have given out more warnings and waited until a
threat was truly imminent, for example by taking cover and only firing warning shots to
get Vassell his supposed gun. The prosecution will also use time-framing to argue that
they were reckless in zooming onto the scene while "failing to acquire any knowledge or
belief that is material" under 3.09. The police officers should have attempted to learn
more about the situation beyond simply asking a dispatcher for more information. The
prosecutors will want to learn if the dispatcher responded, and the information that was in

the hands of the police.

The prosecution will attempt to use the current frame about the police in shootings of
black people and mentally ill people by framing Vassell as an innocent man gunned
down by gung-ho cops. According to witnesses, there was no warning . Officers
statement that they told him to "drop it", may be self-serving. The prosecution will
explain that local officers chatted with him, had taken him to the nearby hospital, that he
had 120 summonses, and he had a violent incident of watching his friend die that he
would act out. He was simply a harmless victim of police violence who was shot by
officers who could not take the time to learn the full information . The prosecution may
compare this to cases where white men have been involved in mass killings, yet officers
give warnings and taken them peacefully into custody. The calls will be used to say that

this information was on the smartphone app, and said that they "didn't know if it's a gun"

and while it "looks like a gun" he was not actually "pulling a trigger". A police officer with
their experience, not under threat when they learned the information, should know that
there is a significant chance the victim does not actually have a gun. Therefore, it was
reckless or at best negligent not to warn him, not to acquire new information, and to

shoot him dead with 10 bullets without a warning or disabling attack.

The prosecution could attempt to differentiate the plain-clothes and uniformed, but they
are most likely to succeed by using that evidence altogether. Though the one uniformed
cop had less information, they will argue he still was reckless in shooting without warning.
At worst, they will lower his charge to a charge of negligence as he had less information.
The fact that other officers didn't fire will be used to explain that there was no need to
shoot.

The defense will argue that the subjective nature of 3.07 means we look at it from an
officers perspective. It was not reckless or negligent to have such a belief. The image of
the gun looks clearly dangerous. In addition, four officers fired - showing that a majority
felt immediately threatened and needed to respond with physical force. They will use the
time-framing to argue you only look at the perspective of the officer in the split-second
while he makes the decision to shoot. In that pressure-packed second, it seems that there

is a significant risk of death.

The officers looked at the information given to them, asked for more info from the
dispatcher, and told him repeatedly to "drop it". These are all signs that they were not
reckless or negligent in failing to acquire information material to the issue. The three calls
all stated the word "gun": while there was not total certainty, it was sufficiently likely with
the proliferation of guns that Vassell was armed. Police work is dangerous and requires
ensuring the safety of officers. This was a clear case of responding to potential use of
deadly force, and finding that they were negligent or reckless would make police officers
unable to do their job.

Vassell was in an shooting stance. The officers were experienced and also not white.
While this may not directly bear on the legal standard, it will be used to disrupt the
prosecutions frame and instead state that it was a set of good officers who made a
difficult and tough decision that should not be second-guessed. They had not been
involved in past shootings, and only shot 10 bullets among the 4 of them.

Judge

This is likely a case for the jury to decide whether it was justified, or whether it was
negligence or reckless. Other charges do not fit due to 3.07 It will be difficult for the
prosecution to get convictions, but this is still a matter of disputed facts, for example
about the warnings Therefore, it is a jury question to decide whether it was reckless or
negligent. We are in the tricky position of balancing the ability of the police do their job

effectively, while preventing innocent death.

There is potentially a constitutional issue to consider. 3.07 does not require
reasonableness. This may violate the 4th amendment, as explained by Tennessee/Connor.
While it can be reasonableness with qualifications, it may still be a constitutional issue that

it is purely subjective outside of the 3.09 limitation.

Alternatively, this could be grounds for a broader claim that the police department as a
whole was negligent - by not having their smartphone app display more information, by
having the dispatcher not give out sufficient information to prevent the shooting, and for
not compiling information about those with mental issues that may make them a target of
police activity. However, the constitutional, immunity, and other elements are too outside

the realm of the course to fully discuss them here.

We should clearly not respond to the NYT. We should rule as a matter of law that it is a
question for the jury for negligence or reckless and therefore second degree manslaughter

or criminally negligent homicide. Given how similar police cases have been decided

5 of 10


CRIMINAL_LAW_SEC_4_HARCOURT_S18 ID: 900

across the country, it is likely that the jury at most returns a verdict of criminally negligent
homicide. However, if they do return a verdict of manslaughter in the second degree, that

is also what a reasonable jury could decide, and we should not upset their verdict.

Question 2.

Foucault is arguing that political power and knowledge are not divorced, but are in fact
interwoven and mutually reinforcing. The great myth of a divide between objective truth
and political power is one the the founding myths of Western thought. Fragments of this
myth are found from the beginning of Western political theory, including in the belief by
the Greek's that the most accurate form of truth was found when torturing a slave to
produce truth. Truth could be extracted from where it originated in the slave's body. This
belief in objective external truth as the pinnacle of neutral knowledge helped to build the
foundation of the political order and in theories of justice. As Oedipus had truth revealed
to him by the shepherd, it was believed that truth can be found in the bodies of those

who are subservient. However, it is this same extraction of truth that reinforces the social

6 of 10


CRIMINAL_LAW_SEC_4_HARCOURT_S18 ID: 900

order of slavery, kings and shepherds, and justifiable torture. Therefore, Foucault
attempts to dispel this myth by an examination of how political power and knowledge

work together to maintain the social order.

This thesis is also explained through the analysis of the scientific-juridical model of truth.
The "pure truth" of science has been used to justify institutionalization and punishment,
from early uses of science to institutionalize the "mentally retarded" to the modern use of
data by Palantir and other data firms in attempting to uncover the pure truth through
predictive policing. There is a pernicious failure to acknowledge that we take a leap of
faith beyond reason and beyond objectivity in our punishment decisions. This failure
allows blinders to be put on by the agents of the judicial "system" - the lawyers, judges,
and police officers who run the complex set of punishments that attempts to control the
deviance and violence of the population. The danger of this myth is that it allows these
operators in the law to wash their hands of responsibility and place their trust in the
objective truth as found through the law. The faith in the rule of law allows the violence
and political power inherent in the system to be covered up by a facade of neutrality and
truth.

The belief that political power is blind and separated from knowledge is at the root of
many injustices that help us interpret the field of Criminal Law. The early creation of the
"reasonable man" in Anglo-American jurisprudence is a Trojan horse that smuggled in
patriarchy, racism, and other forms of violence through the vehicle of supposedly
objective truth. For example, the belief that a "reasonable man" may kill his wife in the
heat of passion of discovering adultery was a way of enforcing the political power of men
over their wives through the reduction of penalties for violence and murder. It is not a
coincidence that early opinions describing this rule understood a wife to be the property
of the husband. The political economy of the time required a subservient wife, and the
reduction in sentencing in murdering one's wife for deviation from the social norm of a

faithful and subservient wife allowed the state to uphold the political regime. One might

7 of 10


CRIMINAL_LAW_SEC_4_HARCOURT_S18 ID: 900

argue, wasn't there still a penalty for this killing? In fact, the lowered penalty was part and
parcel of the careful navigation of the equilibrium of violence. Of course the outright
killing of wives could not be sanctioned if the social order was to be seen as serving the
interests of justice, just as the prosecution of slaves in Alabama required a set of
procedures to ensure the equilibrium was not upset. In a similar manner, the wife could
not be raped by the husband as a matter of law, though she could bring a claim for
violent assault. Why? The only allowable truth was that the wife had consented to the
husband in any intercourse through marriage. The claim of truth by the wife in alleging

rape could not be true knowledge if the political regime was to operate smoothly.

This myth is not a relic of the past. Today, Criminal Law still uses acts as though truth is
an objective thing that is distinct from political power. In reality, this belief still allows the
the logic of the social order to imprint itself on Criminal Law. For example, the use of
self-defense by white men against black assailants has been justified for decades through
various legal devices. In Goetz, the "reasonable" standard was supposedly objective, but
allowed the prior experiences to be included into the circumstances. The inclusion of the
"prior circumstances" of a mugging by the black assailants is a much prettier way of
saying what the court said in McQuirter, that the jury may "consider social conditions and
customs founded upon racial differences, such as that the prosecutrix was a white
woman and the defendant a Negro man". Indeed, this reasoning was not only indirectly
founded on the legacy of slavery, it directly cited Antebellum cases. The Goetz jury,
though directed slightly differently, very likely "considered the social conditions founded
upon racial differences." Just recently, the killing by George Zimmerman of Trayvon
Martin was justified on the doctrine of self-defense. Here, time-framing is used to allow
the social order to intrude while maintaining the facade of the objectivity of truth and
knowledge in criminal law. By allowing the action only in the split second of wrestling on
the ground, the law could ignore Zimmerman's previous acts in provoking the
confrontation. In this manner, the operation of political power in the law can be hidden
from view. Finally, today we still believe in a method of producing "pure truth": except

that instead of belief in the pure truth from torture, we instead believe in the pure truth as

8 of 10


CRIMINAL_LAW_SEC_4_HARCOURT_S18 ID: 900

created by the courts. When Doyle Hamm was sentenced in a minuscule amount of time
and further reviews are upheld through a copied "proposed memorandum order", the
"pure truth" of the courts could not be denied, and the killing of Doyle Hamm was only
stopped after a botched attempt.

One specific area of law that this argument can shed light on is the use of force by law
enforcement. The use of the grand jury in the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson
shows how Criminal Law still clings to the myth that truth never belongs to political
power. The official narrative was that evidence was introduced, witnesses were examined,
and out of this machinery came truth! A clean and objective truth that showed that the
killing of Michael Brown was not a violation of the law. This narrative is a facade that
papers over the injustice done. For example, there fact that the grand jury is typically
meant to hear an aggressive case only on the side of the prosecutor normally results in a
tremendously high success rate by prosecutors. Here, that method was shifted, and the
prosecutor acted almost as counsel for both sides, introducing contradictory evidence
and interrogating supposed inconsistencies in witnesses favorable to the prosecution.
Finally, the release of the grand jury proceedings showed not only how political power
intrudes on the production of knowledge, but how the production of knowledge in turn
attempts to maintain the political economy. The "truth" produced by the grand jury was
used to legitimate the political economy of Ferguson, which was based on extraction of

resources from black and brown bodies through fines and discrimination.

Law enforcement use of force is also a good case study for this myth as alters the very
lens in which truth is viewed. Truth of the killing of civilians is viewed through the eyes of
the dominant political order - the eyes of the police officer. The very truth of
reasonableness is created by viewing the killing from the perspective of the officer under
the circumstances, as upheld by the Supreme Court in Tennessee v. Garner and Graham
v. Connor. This allows the social order to be imported wholesale into a supposedly

"objective" standard of "reasonableness". This both takes advantage of the Goetz use of

9 of 10


CRIMINAL_LAW_SEC_4_HARCOURT_S18 ID: 900

the perspective of the person under threat, and the Zimmerman use of time-framing by
allowing the decision to kill to be determined under the split-second decision to kill,

which most juries are hesitant to second-guess.

Foucault's work has given us a chance to self-reflexively critique these myths in Criminal
Law, and to understand the ways in which knowledge and power are woven together.
Students interpreting the use of force in the future should be aware of the ways in which
we can shake the foundations of the social order by interrogating this myth. If we do not,
we may be doomed to repeat the decisions of the Antebellum judges in the north who
upheld convictions against runaway slaves. It is critical to avoid applying a formalist
interpretation of the law because of a misplaced belief in the neutrality of power and
knowledge.
