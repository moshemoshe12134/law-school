QUESTION I
Trial Judge,

In a pretrial immunity hearing, the defense will no doubt argue that Thompson should be
immune from criminal prosecution because his use of deadly force against the teenagers was
justified under 3.04.012(2). As per this section, Thompson “believe[d] that using...such force is
necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself...or another.” From the facts
provided, we know that Thompson allegedly believed that the teenagers’ erratic driving was a
threat to his safety and that of his girlfriend, a belief that was bolstered when he attempted to
leave the highway and the girls allegedly waited for him to rejoin the flow of traffic to continue
their aggression. The defense will argue that, as per 3.09, Thompson’s belief in the imminence
and degree of threat to him and Evers was not negligently or recklessly formed because of the
circumstances (the speed at which they were traveling, the girls’ continuously erratic driving).

In response to this argument, the prosecution will argue that immunity should not be
granted because the use of deadly force was not justified under the circumstances. In support of
this argument, the prosecution will likely lean on 3.09 to argue that Thompson’s belief was
negligently or recklessly formed as well as on 3.04.041, which denies immunity to the aggressor
in the situation. Under this latter section the prosecution is unlikely to have a strong argument,
since the facts do not support a finding that Thompson was the initial aggressor in the situation
(although it is notable that he had the opportunity to pull off the highway and take a different
route; although the 3.04 has a stand your ground provision and therefore there was no duty to
retreat, that he did not take the opportunity to disengage fully from the situation does not reflect

well on Thompson). Under 3.09, the prosecution will likely argue that Thompson’s use of deadly

force reckless because, rather than disengaging from the situation, he consciously disregarded the
risk that engaging would result in the death of one of his supposed aggressors.

While the defense will have a strong argument that, as per the facts, Thompson believed
that the situation required deadly force to defend himself and his girlfriend, his failure to
disengage entirely when he had the chance (although not legally required to)will likely reflect
poorly on him and influence the decision to charge him with criminally negligent homicide or
manslaughter in the second degree (the only homicide charges available, given the self-defense
justification involved). Given that he was in one car shooting at passengers in another car, it is
likely that a charge of manslaughter in the second degree is more appropriate, given that it
involves a conscious disregard of a risk (that is, that shooting a gun at a car would result in the
death of a passenger, given that there were passengers in the car).

In addition, the prosecution may try to charge Thompson with attempted manslaughter
since he fired three shot and therefore arguably evinced a desire to kill or harm all three
passengers. This will be a tricky charge to litigate. As per MPC 5.01 and persuasive precedent
(Smallwood), attempt crimes typically require specific intent for conviction where a specific
result is required (here, death, as per the definition of homicide). Therefore, an attempt
conviction would be governed by MPC 5.01(1)(b), which requires that the defendant does
something with the purpose of causing or with the belief that it will cause the result. Because
Thompson is likely to be charged with manslaughter or, possibly, criminally negligent homicide,
it will be difficult for the prosecution to show that he had the requisite purpose/intent, given that
the two relevant homicide charges are necessarily unintentional. The defense will likely have the
stronger argument that Thompson cannot be charged with attempted manslaughter or criminally

negligent homicide, unless the court is willing to recognize some sort of foreseeability doctrine.

Daphne Evers’ involvement means that she likely liable as an accomplice to Thompson’s
use of deadly force. The prosecution will charge her as an accomplice under MPC 2.06, either
under section (3)(a)(ii) (because she agreed to hold the wheel and therefore agreed to aid/aided
Thompson in the commission of the offense) or (3)(a)(111) (because, as his girlfriend, she had a
legal duty to prevent the commission of the offense).

In response, the defense will probably raise several arguments. First, they will argue that
Evers cannot be held liable as accomplice to a manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide
because it just doesn’t make sense; she did not have the requisite mens rea and did not intend the
result (as per her comments that she never thought Thompson would actually discharge the gun;
cf. Hicks). On this argument, the prosecution will likely prevail in their charge because they can
point to both the MPC and persuasive precedent like McVay, Roebuck, and Luparello, which
show that it is not necessary for Evers to intend the result to be held liable as an accomplice.

The defense will also likely raise a necessity or duress defense in order to do away with
or mitigate Evers’ conviction. It is not clear from the statute provided or from precedent whether
Evers could benefit from a self-defense justification under MPC 3.04; it is unlikely since she was
not the one using the force, but it is possible that Thompson’s liability or lack thereof under it
will bleed over to her benefit. As per MPC 3.02, Evers could argue that she was justified in
taking the wheel because she was choosing between the lesser of two evils: allowing the car to
career out of control (killing her, Thompson, and other drivers) rather than allowing Thompson
to waive his gun and frighten the girls (given that she had the belief that he would not fire). The
prosecution will likely hammer down via 3.02(2) and argue that Evers’ “appraising of the
necessity of [her] conduct” was reckless or negligent because she ignored or should have known

of the risk thatshe was giving Thompson the opportunity to shoot.

That Thompson shouted at her in the car may support the additional defense that Evers
was acting under duress. She may try to argue that his shouting at her was analogous to a “threat
to use” unlawful force against her that she, as a person of reasonable firmness, could not resist.
While the reasonableness standard here is in her favor (traveling at high speeds, being shouted at
by a person with a gun would be scary to anyone), the prosecution has a strong argument that
Thompson’s shouting at her was not equivalent to a “threat to use unlawful force” against her.
Additional fact-finding on whether or not the relationship is an abusive one may sway the
argument one way or another.

Evers’ access to a necessity or duress defense will be further undermined by her egging
on of Thompson, although it is a he said/she said situation. Depending on what the judge/jury is
able to determine, Evers may have a strong argument that she is exempt from accomplice
liability due to necessity (as an accomplice, she may also be held liable for attempted
manslaughter/criminally negligent homicide (if Thompson is charged with it) depending on
whether the court is willing to recognize a foreseeability doctrine).

It is unlikely and unreasonable that the teen girls will be charged with anything, nor

should they or could they be on the hook for any contributory negligence.
