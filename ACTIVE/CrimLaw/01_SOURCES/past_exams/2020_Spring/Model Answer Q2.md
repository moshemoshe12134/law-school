Question 2

The question as to whether statutes that abolish the insanity defense are unconstitutional remains
unanswered. Indeed, five states, now six, have permitted mental disease as a defense solely on
the issue of whether the defendant possessed the mens rea required by the crime charged. Unlike
Kansas and Montana, however, New York has prohibited the consideration of mental disease at
sentencing, which often leads to committing the individual for institutional care. Courts in four
of the five states have rejected constitutional challenges to their revisions of the insanity defense
because they have held its variability indicates it does not possess the historical pedigree needed
to establish itself as a fundamental right under the Due Process Clause. Today, Your Honor, you
have the opportunity to set the record straight. Mental disease is much more than a defense—it is
a fundamental right established by the Constitution’s Due Process Clause.

Mens rea is already part of law—it is highlighted in state statutes and the MPC alike. Thus, it is
always required. To eliminate the insanity defense by means of anything but the mens rea
requirement is essentially to rid of it entirely. The insanity defense as described in NYPL § 40.15
“eliminates the core” of a defense “so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to
be ranked as fundamental.” (Breyer, dissenting in Kahler). Indeed, the provision eliminates both
prongs of the M’Naghten test. The California Supreme Court has rejected due process challenges
that involve statutes which accept only half of the M’Naghten test, therefore defining insanity
solely by whether a defendant knew whether the conduct is wrong. However, this has remained
the lowest bar needed in order to satisfy a defense for a mental disease or defect. By eliminating
both prongs of the M’Naghten test entirely, the NYPL statute effectively strips any due process
from one of the most marginalized groups in history. The Court in Kahler held the existence of a
mental disease defense, similar to the NYPL statute here, provides protection if a defendant did
not form the criminal intent required for the commission of the crime. Since no single version of
the insanity defense has become so ingrained in American law as to be considered fundamental
for purposes of constitutional protection, the insanity defense has been subject to almost full
erasure. Not only does this court have the opportunity to implement a mental disease defense, but
it may define it in the proper way, one that permits those most vulnerable from having their
rights stripped from them any longer. Surely a defense that has been upheld for over a century
can be deemed ingrained in the American jurisprudential system if similar rights, such as a
women’s right to choose or the fundamental right of sexual intimacy, have been discovered over
the last 50 years.

The purpose of redefining protections of the mentally impaired is because it furthers the rationale
underlying criminal law to begin with. Whether it be utilitarian or retributive, the mentally
diseased simply do not contain the same moral blameworthiness as someone who does not suffer
from that disease. Mental disease itself removes culpability from the equation because it
effectively eliminates the voluntariness of any act. Although Professor Wechsler highlights a
parallel between the criterion of responsibility as affected by mental disease and the traditional
mens rea rules, he ultimately argues that sanctions of the law will not be imposed on those unless
the conduct occurred as a product of choice. Essentially, punishing those with mental disease for
their actions which are not entirely up to their own volition is punishing them on account of who
they are, not what they have done (Foucault). Like Norval Morris has argued, criminal sanctions,
to the extent they are meant to serve punitive purposes, have no difference between defenses of

the marginalized and the mentally sick. Should the purposes relate to rehabilitation or treatment,
there is no need for a difference. The way the judicial system treats the mentally diseased is
comparable to how it treats the disadvantaged and marginalized.

Even today, we are punishing people on account of who they are. Just this week, news came out
about District Attorney Jackie Johnson who prevented authorities from arresting the two men
that shot and killed Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old black male running in his own neighborhood.
This court has the opportunity to begin a jurisprudence of protecting those who have been
marginalized and singled out on account of matters of birth—skin color, class, mental ability.

Ultimately, the court must realize the lack of protections for the mentally diseased comes as a
result of narratives by the powerful. Law, power, legal history and reasoning, and sources of
authority all bolster the social order. Indeed, law itself serves to demonstrate relations of power.
The same could be said for the jurisprudence of mental disease. Not only have the powerful
created the rules and revised them by means of enforcing the social order, but these changes have
also come as a result of personal sentiment that has invaded the judiciary’s role. In fact, the shift
in the narrative is most seen due to political reasons. Despite moving in the right direction, the
court switched gears after the Hinckley trial. As a result, Congress and states alike began
revising their legislation to strip protections from the mentally disabled. Rather, the court should
examine the history of criminal law in its totality to determine the right choice here and set aside
potential political or personal biases that have too often crept into constitutional matters.

Prior to the shift after the Hinckley verdict, courts long held the defense of legal insanity to be an
established feature of American law. Indeed, state constitutions themselves found efforts to
abolish it as unconstitutional violations of due process. See, e.g., Sinclair v. State, 132 So. 581
(Miss. 1931); State v. Strasburg, 110 P. 1020 (Wash. 1910). Additionally, states began revising
their criminal law to accept even broader protections afforded by the M’Naghten test. States
favored the MPC approach, the irresistible impulse test, and even the Durham rule. Each of these
three granted additional protections, beyond the inherent requirements of mens rea already
embedded in criminal law.

Even the requirements to execute the mentally diseased afford more than mens rea. In Ford, the
Court held the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of “cruel and unusual punishment” bars
execution of the insane. Yet, it provided no definition of what constitutes insanity. Later, the
Court clarified competence to be executed requires the individual have a “rational
understanding” rather than merely an awareness of the nexus between crime and punishment.
(Panetti). Even killing the mentally diseased requires an more than mens rea. Although the Court
should utilize one of the four tests to protect the mentally disabled, prior jurisprudence
demonstrates that the NYPL, as it stands, is unconstitutional.

Though any of the four approaches (MPC, M’Naghten, Irresistible Impulse, Durham) would
provide for more protections of the mentally diseased, this court should hold the Durham rule
serves as the baseline for insanity defenses. Though broad, the Durham test recognizes law will
never fully understand the intricacies of mental disease. For once, this court can silence the
rumors that the law refuses to grant too much justice. Instead, it can provide some measure of
unmerited grace by breaking “the cycle of victimization and victimhood, retribution and

suffering.” (Stevenson). Perhaps then, the court will “heal the psychic harm and injuries that lead
to aggression and violence, abuse of power [and] mass incarceration.” Id.
