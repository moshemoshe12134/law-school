               KSSB10          413-426         Commonwealth v. Sherry
               [KSSB9          389-401]        Commonwealth v. Fischer
               [KSSB 11        435-447]        Notes following Fischer

               New York Penal Law, especially §130.05 on consent and §130.25; see here:
               http://ypdcrime.com/penal.law/article130.htm#p130.05
               http://ypdcrime.com/penal.law/article130.htm#p130.05
As noted above, I try to stay focused on the legal doctrine so as to avoid triggering anyone.
Sometimes that feels as if I am focusing too much on the legal elements, actus reus and mens rea
for instance, and not using the materials sufficiently to discuss critical issues of consent discourse,
issues of closure, redress, healing, issues of gender and race, and broader issues of the legal
framework that allows rape culture to thrive.
So as you read and as we discuss the legal issues, I hope that you will also be thinking about, and
that we might address during the class time, the following issues:
   1. Has the evolution of sexual assault law moved the legal framework in a positive
      direction, even if not fully? In other words, has legal transformation been helpful at all?
   2. Does the legal framework shape the cultural framework, or the other way around, and if
      the latter, then how should we approach the law and legal transformation?

      3. Do you think that the law is the right vehicle to provide closure, protection, redress, or
         healing to victims, especially those who have been victimized more, such as LGBTQ
         persons, women, persons of color, and other minorities?
      4. Is the law and legal practice a part of challenging the cultural framework within which
         sexual assault continues to thrive?
