## Syllabus Extract (verbatim-ish)

E. The Function of Punishment                     [#11 – Friday, FEBRUARY 13, 2026]
       In this class, we will explore the broader question of how the criminal law constructs and
       maintains the social order that we live in. As you read these materials, please ask yourself
       what work the punishment process is doing.
       Please read:
              Supp. The State v. Clarissa, 11 Ala. 57 (Jan. 1847)
              Supp. Wyatt v. The State, 25 Ala. 9 (June 1854)
              Supp. Robert Cover, “Prelude: Of Creon and Captain Vere,” pp. 1-7, in Justice
              Accused: Antislavery and the Judicial Process (Yale, 1975)
              Supp. Michel Foucault, “Lecture of April 22, 1981 [on Homer],” Wrong-Doing,
              Truth-Telling: The Function of Avowal in Justice, pp. 31-45 (University of Chicago
              2014)

       As you read these cases and the writings of Michel Foucault, please ask yourself these
       questions:
           1. What are the stated purposes in the legal decisions that are rendered?
           2. What do you think is really going on with the legal decisions?
           3. How do we reconcile what is said and what is done?

V.     THE CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITS OF PUNISHMENT
In addition to statutory requirements, which are of course really important because Criminal Law
is one of your only mainly statutory fields, there are also constitutional limitations on what can
be defined and prosecuted as a crime. In this part, we will explore the constitutional limits on
punishment.
