## Syllabus Extract (verbatim-ish)

D. Issues of Causation                       [#8 – THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 2026]

         KSSB10         603-614         Acosta and Arzon
         [KSSB9         571-581]

                 [KSSB11        568-579]
                 MPC § 2.03

As you read these cases, ask yourself:
      1. What is the difference between factual (actual or but-for) causation and legal (proximate)
         causation? What are intervening causes?
      2. Can you construct for yourself a diagram or flow chart to take you through the steps you
         need to determine in order to decide on likely guilt or innocence?
      3. What do you think is really going on with causation and how might it relate to the cultural
         interpretation of criminal law?

IV.      WHY DO WE PUNISH? THEORIES, INSTITUTIONS & PRACTICES
We will discuss the theories of punishment (retribution, deterrence, rehabilitation, and
incapacitation) and the history of thought about punishment.
