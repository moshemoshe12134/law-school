                  Please read Supp. Jack Balkin, “The Crystalline Structure of Legal Thought,” 39
                  Rutgers Law Review 1 (1986), pages 2 to 13 (and quickly peruse the rest).

          As you read these materials, please think about these questions:
              1. How would you best model the elements requirements and how they interact? In
                 other words, how the various act requirements in a statute interact with the mens
                 rea requirement and attendant circumstances? Can you come up with a system to
                 clearly model the requirements of a statute?
              2. How do the Model Penal Code provisions you read provide some guidance on
                 how to interpret criminal statutes when there are gaps, silences, or ambiguities?
              3. When you read these cases, can you find the most compelling ways to argue for
                 both sides? Do any of these relate to Kelman’s notion of frames or interpretive
                 constructs?
              4. As you read the arguments in these cases, can you start making a list of the
                 recurring arguments? Does Balkin help to create an exhaustive catalogue of
                 typical legal arguments? What does “typical legal arguments” mean?

III.      THE LAW OF HOMICIDE

       The law of homicide is all about the gradation of culpability and blameworthiness. Homicide
       itself is easily defined: causing someone’s death. The intricacy, then, is all in the gradations
       and levels of culpability. Also in the defenses (justifications or excuses) to causing death, but
       we will discuss those later in the course, when we get to legal defenses (such as self-defense
       or police use of lethal force).
       In this part of the course, we will be focusing on how a criminal behavior (taking someone’s
       life) can be treated differently based on gradations that reflect moral judgments about the
       blameworthiness of a person, judgments that are unique to our culture and times.
       Throughout our discussion of the law of homicide, we will be navigating between the
       following categories, and so it will be helpful if you keep this schema in mind as we do. As
       you will see, the borders and movement between them speak loudly about our culture and
       relations of power in society:

                                     LAW OF HOMICIDE
                       •   No liability whatsoever
                                    Torts
                       •   Civil liability
                       •   Criminal Negligence                               Welansky, Hall and Williams cases

                       •   Involuntary Manslaughter
                       •   Voluntary Manslaughter
                              Heat of Passion (EED)      Malone case of extreme recklessness (murder)

                                                         Felony-murder doctrine

                       •   Murder

I have organized the readings in such a way as to allow us to navigate between the categories
in the schema.
