## Syllabus Extract (verbatim-ish)

A. Criminal Law and Justice                            [#1 – TUESDAY, JANUARY 20, 2026]
How do we define justice for purpose of “criminal justice”? How do you define “justice”? In our
first class, we will ask ourselves this question and, hopefully, each one of you will come up with
a definition of justice that will guide your learning of the criminal law this semester.
       Readings:
               Bryan Stevenson, Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption (New York:
               Penguin, 2014)
               Supp. Peter Applebome, “Alabama Releases Man Held on Death Row for Six
               Years,” New York Times, March 3, 1993
               Optional: Please feel free to view the 60-Minutes segment on Walter McMillian’s
               case that is available on the EJI website here: https://eji.org/walter-mcmillian

       B. Overview of the Criminal Justice Process
We will also take an overview the criminal legal process, including arraignments, grand juries,
through the trial and appeal.
       Readings:
               KSSB10          1-19    The Structure of the Criminal Justice System
               [KSSB9          1-13]
               [KSSB11         1-8, 67-75]
               Supp.           “Capital Case Review Process Liebman 2000”
               Supp.           “Capital Case Stages”

               Supp.          “The Criminal Trial Process in New York State”

       As you read Just Mercy, please think about these questions:
       1. What is the fact or phenomenon in Just Mercy that you find the most unjust of all the
          injustices? What was the moment, reading the book, that you felt most upset by what
          was happening?
       2. What is the idea of “just mercy” that you think Bryan Stevenson is trying to
          communicate in his book? Is it about “mercy”? Is it about “justice”? Does the “just” in
          the expression “just mercy” mean “simply” or is it connected to the idea of justice?
       3. What would be your greatest criticism of the book, Just Mercy? Is there anything about
          it that you found problematic or that you would want to resist?
       4. How would you define “justice”? Has this book helped you to define justice for
          yourself? Please write down your own definition of justice in one sentence. I will ask
          you to come back to that definition over the course of the semester.

II.    THE ELEMENTS OF CRIMINAL LAW
In this first part, we will learn the basic elements—the building blocks—of the criminal law: the
act requirement (actus reus) and the requirement regarding a mental state (mens rea). These
elements are essential to defining crimes and they generally represent the core elements that a jury
must find in order to return a conviction of guilt. Understanding how to mix and match elements
is a basic tool for criminal lawyers. It is also what makes the criminal law so malleable—despite
the universal character of “crimes.”
Some of you may work better with visuals and graphics, others with narrative, others with laundry
lists. Whatever works best for you, can you find a way to model how these elements go together
in a manner that would allow you to communicate best to a jury what elements they need to find
in order to convict or acquit? Try using a chart, a list, a drawing, words, or a paragraph—whatever
works best for you—to start mapping out what elements are required to convict or acquit.
Critical Legal Studies (“CLS”) was a movement in the 1970s that has been absorbed for the most
part in ordinary legal reasoning today. It was a reiteration of American Legal Realism (1920-
1930s), in response to a revival of positivism in law (for instance, in the Law and Economics
movement of the 1960s). Today, most practicing lawyers are “crits,” even if they do not know
what that means. Most lawyers, in fact all practicing lawyers worth their salt, will ply the law in
their client’s direction. We will read excerpts from two CLS articles as a way to better understand
how lawyers can play with the elements of criminal law. This is what creates the utter flexibility
in the criminal law.
