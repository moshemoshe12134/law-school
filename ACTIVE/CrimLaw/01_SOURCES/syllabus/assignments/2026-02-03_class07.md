  As you read these materials on the different gradations of homicide, please ask yourself:
  1. What are the dimensions along which the cases always seem to resolve? Is there
     something about the awareness by the defendant? Something about the level of risk?
     Something about the amount of care demonstrated?
  2. Ask yourself what are the different dimensions that we are navigating in these cases,
     and whether they make sense, or whether you would propose a different system?
  3. What are the different gradations of homicide here? Think about what purpose it
     serves to be navigating between these gradations, and what it tells us about our
     society.
